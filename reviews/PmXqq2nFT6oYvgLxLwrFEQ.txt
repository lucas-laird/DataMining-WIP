Love even if wasn't counting calories   Hunter Unwhich cherry peppers sprouts onions vinegar oil   Yum!!! <EOR> We love Jimmy John's but location disappointing  live less 3 miles away deliver though two Jimmy John's delivery cars parking lot  being said sandwiches tasted fresh staff friendly  <EOR> I ordered twice now  delivery incredibly fast! only 10minutes moment pressed order button online! easy order online  Both times order exactly ordered sandwiches made well enough ingredients fill sub  ingredients fresh tasty!     bacon great crispy all  lettuce wrap good  But both sandwiches salty kinda ruins taste me      all all definitely try them 3rd time knowing stress no salt  Great priced subs should thy them out!! <EOR> I don't eat Jimmy John's often enough know if food received standard exception  said hey Jimmy John's think could spare few ingredients? Don't stingy   extremely disappointed both QUALITY well quantity  Absolutely terrible  Stale rock hard bread pennants meat  Why pull center bread the best part throw trash? sandwich only meat lettuce? things onion pickles other options consideration? Maybe but knows?  To reader review If considering Jimmy John's intersection don't   yourself favor shwarma house same parking lot   tad more cost but least pay for    Quality food fills tastes great     Overall very disappointed place back  <EOR> I've kinda slacking reviews lately figured why kill two birds stone FTR 100th review!  This Jimmy John's location brand new located SE corner Craig Jones  If you're familiar area shopping center also Panda Express Dunkin' Donuts few other shops  JJ's far east part complex newly renovated building right now only business open building    The inside JJ's quite bit different other locations into  most other stores open kitchen area but JJ's pretty big open dining area well  When walk you'll find few booths your right hand side some community bar style seating your left  coolest things location they've also drive thru!   I've always fan JJ's sandwiches new location just good any other too  prefer thick sliced 7 grain bread over French bread super fresh  meat great flavor love use real bacon even more excited see offer sprouts location  sure but some fresh sprouts really set off sandwich  Other traditional toppings lettuce tomato cucumber all fresh tasty  only big complaint food wise only offer Dijon mustard if prefer yellow mustard you'll getting packets side   I eaten twice since opened both which pickup orders  great offer online ordering if group people want order office really nice group ordering system  first order messed sandwich forget ingredients huge deal but bit bummer  When order everything broken down printed managed mess beyond me  second order perfect though seem doing just fine having only open less then week  definitely repeat customer great location imagine they'll really well here  <EOR> OMG what joke    really hillarious   so go  So first time = DONE A deranged woman works there    She said there's Tasty Sauce tuna sandwich  asked tastes she said she can't tell because can't really taste it  cream based?
