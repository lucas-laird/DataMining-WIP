Well excited try Italian bistro neighborhood    But ever disappointing   Restaurant bar didn't serve drinks bar order yourself   Then long long wait order taken    husband ordered Chicken wings ordered Chicken piccata angel hair pasta salad garlic bread    25 minute wait  salad comes ranch dressing cup but ordered Italian dressing  another 10 minute wait comes huge bowl spaghetti lemon sauce capers   When waitress delivers husbands chicken wings asked if chicken piccata coming?  She back kitchen bowl spaghetti partial eaten piece garlic bread fork   3 minutes later came bowl spaghetti chopped chicken pieces added   wouldn't eat anything more   Don't waste your time   many wonderful places neighborhood  <EOR> What pleasant surprise  around corner house figured I'd give go  Can't $7 99 carry special  didn't expect much but quality pizza    The sauce sweet real Italian pizza crust crispy tastes extremely fresh  don't actually know if own dough but wouldn't surprised if did    The location bar little confused where pizza but bartender turned around area pay pizza  Overall good pizza great price  definitely returning  <EOR> Awful  Never received food even though they're claiming did refused anything it <EOR> Worst service ever whole life! Food decent! person working bartender full house! If want good service place!! <EOR> I'd also give zero stars if could  wife granddaughter wanted give shot headed over  When absolutely no customers staff place  cause concern but still willing give shot  waited hostess someone seat but 10 minutes no such luck  grabbed menu called them inside restaurant  When someone finally answered asked if dining room open unenthusiastic yeah then informed calling inside restaurant waiting  Just okay right   When she finally came first thing she said no under 21 allowed granddaughter 7   understand under 21 rule because attached gambling establishment but closed off glass partition  left  Very disappointing say least  No wonder why nobody place  Bad service model say least  <EOR> White pizza letdown  seasoning? As case  spaghetti  The garlic balls good dough but no flavor  Even adding garlic red peppers every other Italian seasoning home   it disappointing  Overall good place  <EOR> My husband eaten multiple times keep meaning post Yelp but place awesome!!  carryout special $7 99 awesome dough fresh crispy toppings abundant   garlic fries DIE FOR!!!  best thing menu???  extra extra crispy deep fried wings!!  Fresh wings super crispy garlic parmesan flavor amazing   Plus ranch homemade!  Sometimes service takes little longer because tend stay kitchen but just call store when arrive someone come when tell them you're there   saw people complaining won't bring drinks    seriously??  Why looking 5 star service restaurant  bar??  bar far away any seats walk over yourself lazy!!  never skimpy portions toppings sides   just glad there's real place good food instead terrible BBQ place total waste space time money   least now food good! <EOR> I'd give them zero but  option  Friday before Christmas but couldn't service  fetched own menus seated ourselves empty restaurant finally elsewhere 20+ minutes  couple employees did appear 10 minutes but didn't acknowledge all    even standing waving arms around  All say close down actual restaurant occupy space  <EOR> I first want say pizza ordered better ones Las Vegas quite long time  Great crust ingredients fresh really great taste  reason giving establishment star fettuccine Alfredo disgusting made someone no clue properly prepare simple Italian dish  sauce made knowledge just butter cream told  tasted cream based gravy flavored chicken bullion disgusting bottom line  Then top off star rating waitress all but pleasant no way interested providing personal service smile  She mad no effort sure enjoying food if needed any attention  really wished she would come around lot sooner when we're ready check could let know Fettuccine crap would removed bill  When she did finally come around asked fettuccine removed bill she surprised request  She came lame excuse she couldn't only thing she could time pay herself  She explained tried excuse she already entered into system BS  If  system if  way train staff then place needs marked place would rather scam patrons hold servers accountable then need business all  server returned table check abruptly placed table w fettuccine removed imagine that walked away no explanation concern us  wife tried communicate but she just walked away just said wanted said busy  Any long story short NEVER RETURN RESTAURANT RECOMMEND OTHERS PATRONIZE PLACE WHERE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BOTTOM LIST PRIORITIES  <EOR> This only place pizza from  Pizza good price good people friendly  able them breakfast pizza eggs green peppers when most other pizza places laughed assumed high which was but guys did it! <EOR> What disappointment  previously happy first order decided order them again  Placed online order over 2 hrs ago received it!!!!!
