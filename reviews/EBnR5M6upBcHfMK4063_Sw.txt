He made awesome pie SURE again  Thanks whole staff dynamics making pizza loving foodie happy!! pizza taste amazing! Walking other patrons wanted buy order another because looked smelled good!!! <EOR> I stopped use Groupon   ordered pretzel bites spicy teriyaki tenders Al Capone pizza meat lovers    The order ready exact amount time quoted 25 min    The pretzel bites okay but forgettable   tenders slightly overdone but still delicious sauce just right amount heat   pizza definitely star show   crust tasty sauce balanced perfect amount sweetness acidity   toppings plentiful   pizza worth getting just meatballs it   exceptional great garlic flavor   The machine played while sadly great but then no fault bar   would definitely return again  <EOR> As business owner myself know some things control business  initial review mainly Grubhub which never use again  5 stars following in house meal polite response manager  <EOR>
