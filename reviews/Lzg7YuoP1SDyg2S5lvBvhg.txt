Owned married couple Korea  barbecue cooked your table amazing! <EOR> Good Fella knows Korean food! haven't such authentic Korean food Vegas place makes! If you're looking great food place! <EOR> I looking forward giving place another try since under new management  Back when called Mashisoyo felt meat dishes adequate but soondubu tofu soups extremely lacking depth flavor  very stingy amount meat soups   So hoping improvement flavor tofu soups but unfortunately giving them another two chances writing place off entirely  Perhaps under new management but maybe cooks haven't changed     I love soondubu  lot favorite dishes ever  Mr Tofu absolute favorite place but unfortunately changed owners gone totally downhill   But honestly say Mashisoyo Good Fella worst soondubu ever tried  Zero flavor it  Just tastes water soup some chili flakes it  Disappointing since hoping improvement change management   wish something redeeming employees seem nice enough  very few Korean restaurants far Southwest area town  But sadly just worth compromising flavor just convenience   Oh well maybe day give rest menu try  But thing's sure at least     don't bother wasting your money soondubu  <EOR> The people NICE! mom champong jajang myun   both good inexpensive <EOR> I'm korean American its tough finding traditional great tasting korean food  place real deal doesn't use MSG! <EOR> Had tofu soup bf bibimbap both thought food sub par  really any flavor both dishes  Maybe there's no msg added but there's other flavor enhancers salt used just sayin'   Tofu soup tasted someone threw spicy sauce hot water tofu little amounts hard beef   Bibimbap lacked any flavor well  had use LOT red sauce give some life unfortunately    Juns soyo far better imo  sides delicious however very skimped  little overpriced quality food such casual setting  Sorry good fellas fan!   However want add service very hospitable <EOR> They cook homemade like food delicious!
