An overall conclusion would doesn't matter order dingy basement like atmosphere Chapala's   it all tastes same!  I've wanting long finally did which majorly disappointing  ordered chili relleno entree which included rice beans  also ordered tamale side  Accompanied family member she also ordered similar entree side dish  Considering portion size place doesn't disappoint  Everything else? heavily does   There absolutely NO flavor any food  chili relleno ice middle strange taste which implied wasn't made fresh most likely brought frozen  wouldn't argue if other food prepared same way  explains food came quickly wasn't even hot tasted heavily just salty refrigeration   I glanced over other cutomers' plates everything just looked same   uniform flavorless just overall no excitement  Chapala's serves traditional mexican food but worst ways possible  There's nothing fresh no exuberant colors flavors jumping when tasting foods  Just cold old dead  could say same atmosphere well waitress most odd like personality ever encountered restaurant  No greetings smiles even explanations anything let alone talking    This place dead which also explains 44 demerits just recently closed for  feel sick just thinking now  <EOR> Great food great service  chicken enchiladas suiza delicious! <EOR> Been coming since moved Vegas!
