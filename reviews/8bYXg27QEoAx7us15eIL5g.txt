If could give restaurant particular 0 star review would but since can't  just say 1 star way good you'll receive if choose eat here  <EOR> I think if mentally lower your expectations then food decent price  did carside thing first time  smoothly service good which why 3 stars  Food packaged nicely ok warm time destination   Like said food ok but nothing rave about  <EOR> Been location twice both times horrible   Slow servers act if inconvenience serve you  Food both times luke warm  <EOR> Food really good      Great service     crowded awesome kids    would most definitely come back again <EOR> My server great courteous!

Seriously! Its must try  time some reason he put glob cheese middle instead top bread which may add wasn't very fond of  But still da bomb ! ordered usual 8oz steak mashed potatoes broccoli  asked medium but medium well  Also bourbon chicken shrimp  Excellent always  little dry but did heat up  All all sever really sweet would definitely back! <EOR> This worst Applebee's ever to!! Thursday celebrate friends birthday bar server rude! name Tracy  She brought drinks 20 ordered   Then when ordered more she said why didn't u tell when first time  Then she didn't advise kitchen closing soon  Asking if going order anything else  She just came said! Kitchen closed bar closed  your check  friend point very disappointed   birthday dinner going planned  service sucked already   Thennnn top shitty service server said   u done yet because all liquor off tables  she bearly brought drinks 10 mins ago  said well u paid your drink just finish it  Then she said well giving 3mins  When she walked away  manager came asked if leaving yet   Keep mind when Applebee's very welcoming tell take time  But location worst service ever restaurant! WORST! Just cuz restaurant closes certain hour wanted 10 mins later  felt very unwelcome!  Never again Applebee's ! Tracy needs learn customer service works  Specially if she working tips  <EOR> Applebee's long neighborhood bar grill enjoy frequenting because amazing deals 2 $20 share appetizer dessert plus 2 entrees  NOW  price fixe 2fer   Unfortunately time around didn't any specials all ordered off menu costs over $60 w tip!! difference special We decided appetizer some chicken fingers NY steak dinner  fingers good better most bars #Vegas The steak right great piece meat cooked perfectly seasoned well great mushroom garlic add on   The service always outstanding   they always top no matter when busy gets   I know chain place but keep radar cheap + consistent!!! Always happy when leave ALWAYS good neighborhood <EOR> It's your typical Applebee's  Standard American food  A OK quality atmosphere  Let's realistic can't high standards when establishments     Unfortunately particular experience noteworthy negative way  terrible server   Whether servers new if ready floor should more training before they're working own  particular server's ONLY table took way long drinks soup salad meals  She seemed lost kept forgetting things  server bartender almost 14 years now  If capacity take care 1 table time may job you?? Needless say experience frustrating must've nearly 2 hours just grab quick bite   <EOR> Horrible  coworkers stopped work enjoy some lunch Thursday around 2 30  Cesar salad spinach artichoke penne pasta  Didn't taste good all very bland  home take nap being full wake few hours later nauseous crap  started vomiting every 20 minutes 2 hours  then down every hour  Ended going hospital food poisoning gave me  Even other coworkers sick hospital well  all different food  <EOR> Even during busiest dinner rush waitress per 6 tables very rarely around   ordered drinks bus boy apps table tablet before waitress ever said anything us  s o  asked water three times still did refill  Just really slow inattentive service mediocre food  <EOR> I normally large restaurant chains best avoid all costs  Big chains really tourists prices always tend friendly portions served  Also because food just let down  visits Applebees always very rare occasions only occur every few years    However say pleasantly surprised when came lunch other day  friends insisted coming assured would letdown NYC locations  gut instinct say really enjoyed lunch  bourbon chicken shrimp super delish ! Additionally found staff super friendly attentive food arrived nice HOT! liked vibe place staff seemed sense urgency  same can't said ones NYC  staff NYC seem hellbent letting chain bankrupt    I would definitely back future vacation Vegas  Oh waitress beyond excellent! <EOR> Our hostess best part  did sing three year old grandson which nice   food ordered just wasn't good  Two pretzels cheese  cheese looked tasted  gravy made no spices including salt  pretzels gummy textured  asked waiter regular cheese sauce he told emphatically NO OTHER cheese sauce! Then manager walking tables ask if things ok  told cheese gross then he said he would bring some QUESO sauce  Uh      yeah ok  queso sauce really wasn't good either   ordered three app plate  waited quite while before called tell them hadn't delivered apps  When arrived wasn't really hot even though Hot name    server wandered off twice  second time long actually called restaurant sitting ask them find him!  place clean everyone friendly  meh  Probably stick h Friday's now on  <EOR> Two stars rather half because food alright  waited long time acknowledged served just leave when he finally came over  Slow slow service but he did come back check guess  plus  There's lot Applebee's around valley though think you'd better choice going different especially if you're rush  <EOR> Where start??  Came greeted David took drink order  asked draft but he did know draft he look bar area came back  He came back 5 minutes taking drink order because he forgot kind beer ordered  When he brought drinks asked advertisement table which stated if server did offer margarita would free churro  mentioned because he did mention margaritas he claimed he mentioned them??  Hmm seriously? let continued wait food   20 minutes later manager Deb came over told sandwich ordered couldn't brought because didn't enough meat but whatever ordered instead would house  Ok ordered something else waited again   10 minutes later some food arrived  things arrived wasn't ordered 2 other entrees didn't both sides waiting last 2 entrees    The remaining food FINALLY arrived did look appetizing all  told manager complains she defensive told entrees only come 2 sides    But only side missing other one  She did apologize seem care  Customer service all!!  I am very disappointed come again  <EOR> It way cold  cold poor girlfriend freezing butt off wait quite awhile server ask wanted then she more preoccupied other things us  all all service  poor food overpriced <EOR> We literally just left  love eating Applebee's but come on  5 min wait seated no else waiting sat down  Waited 7min order water waited 9min receive water she didn't take order?
