Stuffed pie pizzas did cook well family but deliciously prepared  Takes longer instructions stand oven pizza stone works better baking board provided  Overall very pleased  <EOR> Let start off saying use think place dumb orders uncooked pizza but some friends invited over pizza movie found myself asking where did    Papa Murphy's answer    Fast forward  year open near house  location really nice clean lots parking friendly staff  pizza top notch always taste great  far favorite stuffed chicken bacon drawing blank official nane     You might ask why only 4 stars when clearly love pizza? Well its because take bake honest messed two over cooking damn near set fire  But if remotely good around oven know set timer should fine  Just hint set several timers now   <EOR> This literally silliest place ever seen   stopped night because didn't feel cooking thought I'd try new pizza place block   When placed order shocked quickly handed pizza   I'd say under minute   pizza however frozen!  dumbfounded   cashier instantly saw disbelief assured best pizza world    Well assure isn't   going far compare pizza NYC NJ   even going compare pizza Vegas powerhouses Pizza Rock Novacento   Actually going compare Little Caesar's hot n' ready because 1  Little Caesar's bare minimum pie tastes much better 2  Little Caesar's hot n' ready comes hot ready FROZEN!!  I'm going limb say people order take because don't want cook   If grab food bring home still cook it would sense just pop Digiorno's   which also tastes better Papa Murphy's  <EOR> First time here    weren't busy  cashier super personable advised Tuesday $10 any large pizza  great since better deal coupons had!   made pizza quickly smells amazing haven't Papa Murphy's years impressed cleanliness store friendliness staff also quickly pizza made  great alternative regular 'take out' pizza since take ownership actually 'cooking' semi home cooked meal   I loved vegetarian gourmet ordered! Definitely hit spot! <EOR> If haven't tried Papa Murphy's yet let give piece advice  establishment closes 8p customer service stops 645p   husband experienced any way when interacted Anahi  Apparently interrupted pizza prepping time pestering simple question order  place hasn't open very long your act together Anahi smile your face there's no need mean mug me  All take order  <EOR>
