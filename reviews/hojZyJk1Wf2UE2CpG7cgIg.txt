They open 7 days week 10 30 am 10 11 pm  Give try think happy  <EOR> This place good but great   They lot offer lot potential but could some improvements   cheese burger which good but anything special necessarily  Reminded In n out because also own sauce  If someone wants eat I'd no problem but don't think necessarily back just myself   Something note if go horrible line area   lucky seemed during lull but 3 minutes line incredibly long uncomfortable because people didn't know where stand kind funny   Also WAAAYYY many workers walking around standing idly   made super awkward when family trying eat every few minutes someone asked meal is  not gonna lie but 3 minutes nothing going change answer haha point kind wondering if they're going many workers why don't bring food instead calling numbers it? Just thought  <EOR> We area pleasant surprise  Burgers very tasty reasonable prices  Kids fish liked good flavor filling fries chips     oh try fry sauce good  <EOR> $2 59 five onion rings kinda high since two stuck together gummy middle  side item worth price  Quality lettuce wrapped burger but dripping grease??? What's burger joint  Save your money quality gone down same past  <EOR> The burgers really good good choices  really love custard concretes  store always clean  <EOR> This location seems taken dive downhill  still a ok but sloppier less good    The best part concretes  now specifically ask whip cream only first topping free  last trip didn't even mix up  bunch heath toffee bottom bunch vanilla custard sitting top it  Poor form  But least slew toppings mix ins choose from  custard tasty   The Chicago hot dog fine  tastes hot dog  Nothing special  But safe bet   The fries shoestring fries which enjoyable  usually always cooked just right too   The burgers ok  Kinda meh  ordered double California  toppings poor quality  Wilting lettuce  pickles bad? think bad  Why tomato onion icky? Something wrong here  California burger supposed include 1000 island dressing  absolutely none burger  though two sauce cups some sort bleh ketchup mayo combo  1000 island dressing? fry sauce? both? way rip off   So sum concretes usually worth perhaps now need request mix in mix in?   But non dessert items aren't really worth it  way overpriced  spent $15 combo meal burger fries small drink small concrete  worth it  <EOR> No thank greasy burger   I would much rather drive down street grab hamburger doesn't give stomach ache then block Nielson's 5 star frozen custard!

Small issue when received order chili cheese fries still onions them    Luckily planning devour them Way home able easily back through drive thru  girl very good making brand new order  She insisted keep other order  All all pretty good meal experience    definitely back some drive thru tea! <EOR> Good burger clean restaurant fast excellent service  Heavy appetites should order extra meat  fries crispy tasty but once again those shoestring angel hair french fries  ordered food sat down but within few minutes tidal wave diners came line huge but credit crew line vanished within few minutes routine down! When done someone even came took tray us! prices very reasonable just over $10 both we shared fries   We'll try ice cream shakes next time  Good place good place! <EOR> For being fast food place great   I honestly haven't tried actual food but frozen custard rich delicious   chocolate really chocolatey mix in options great  <EOR> I find am biggest fan steak burgers but Freddy's far the Best frozen custard area  Surprisingly find hawaii inspired concrete amazing!!!! Surprised because Im fan pineapple any sort dairy product    even though pineapple! figure  definite must try book! <EOR> Once again best burger places town  review focused new fish sandwich fish chips  Fish sandwiches all rave right now infant food restaurants  McDonalds started fish sandwich many years ago others followed suit  Without commenting any other fish sandwiches Freddy's fish sandwich among top list  Crispy hot full flavor sandwich two pieces fish fried batter served toasted white bun slice cheese Freddy's sauce tasted 1000 island    On day chose sandwich fish chips  hope two items become part regular menu  Both worth money great addition already amazing menu  If give piece criticism would pricing hot dogs  dogs pretty spendy  Although delicious just no value hot dogs  If you're going eat fast food restaurant skip chain places Freddy's  Simple food done well good pricing some friendliest employees Las Vegas  Keep good work Freddy's  <EOR> Shoestring fries fresh custard shakes fry sauce  Freddy's Fargo's Favorite! <EOR> 3 5 stars   Freddy's Frozen Custard Steakburgers apparently known burgers custard but haven't tried either! first visit only ordered fries because into burgers wasn't hungry  also hit drive thru first visit still wasn't sure Freddy' all since hubby mood burger suggested back try place again  Since Freddy' promotes Chicago dogs outside building fact use vienna all beef hot dogs figured based Chicago  Nope! Freddy' started Wichita KS  burgers fresh never frozen grilled order  Custard churned fresh daily each location  try custard next visit!  This visit though ordered Chili Cheese Dog priced $3 89 Chili Cheese Fries priced $3 59  hot dog all beef topped chili cheese onions  enjoyed it! chili cheese fries much bigger then expected  fries shoestring covered chili cheese onions  liked nacho cheese sauce used love shoestring fries but fries soggy being hearty enough hold all toppings  fan onions rings ordered some priced $2 29 found them pretty good  onion rings weren't thick would but big round wise cooked just right  Hubby ordered double Hatch Green Chili Burger priced $5 49 he enjoyed it    The inside clean employees friendly  <EOR> I know while since last review but finally managed snag some time write guys! some friends surprised close lol   If guys anything probably thought more dessert place because word custard name but assure also sell yummy American food hamburgers hot dogs!  I ordered number 7 combo menu which came burger 2 thin patties bacon 2 slices cheese tomato lettuce onions fries drink  burger alright overall but best part taste patties  buns kind flat flavorless raw onion taste wasn't very appealing me  Also bacon slices all clustered area hard even ratio bacon each burger bite  Honestly think still best burgers but place nice change pace  say fries skinny crispy just delicious  Soggy fries never good thing glad didn't experience here  also fry sauce which guys try but think just basically thousand island sauce lol    I also PBC C sundae which basically vanilla ice cream topped pieces reese's peanut butter cups banana slices whipped cream cherry  thing note your dessert two forms concrete sundae  Concrete basically means blend toppings ice cream which easier eat terms cleanliness  does dessert look kind sad though because just looks used bunch ice cream much toppings  sundae form messier but see TASTE toppings which enjoyed when eating reese's peanut butter cups    Overall I'd say place decent nice try if never here  If really want delicious cheap burgers still place go  <EOR> So am shocked never Freddy's Steakburgers   ended ordering traditional steak burger cheese course  fríes cheese Pepsi wash all down   burger actually really good soft bun burger itself cooked perfect very good  skinny fries which good cheese top since ordered cheese fries made them great   also order traditional Turtle Sunday   super delicious nice just right amount hot fudge caramel nice big walnuts  defiantly return when want good burger fast easy  drive thru  <EOR> Best burgers town   People work very pleasant   clean great service !

Very misleading  Oh way    NEVER EVER PUT RUBBER GLOVES DISMANTLE YOUR PATRONS FOOD FRONT THEM EXPECT THEM EAT AFTERWARD! DISGUSTING! <EOR> We looking forward trying Freddy's  great service but disappointed food  basic steak burger perhaps just don't steak burgers but tough  then ordered custard  good!!!! shared concrete but decided never share again  each want own!

The place clean people friendly very inviting  Way different then other steak burger places Vegas located near Southpoint Casino    I totally back!! <EOR> Ended going because replaced Fazoli's  ordered double California burger  Pretty much nastiest greasiest burger ever had  bottom bun soaked grease take off eat upside down  ended throwing three quarters still feel might vomit  shoestring fries alright but disgusted burger could finish them  husband said double cheeseburger also pretty gross  All all say both very disappointed definitely eat again  <EOR> Overall I'd say place good but over top good! burgers average fries really nothing special  kind tasteless! didn't try frozen custard however but did hear its pretty good!!! staff location sweet! always smile conversation! bumped 2 star rating 3!!! <EOR> Drove thought would check out  mentioned someone else review burger very thin  Mine crunchy  kind noise wanna hear when bite into burger  bun ok  buttered but sesame seed bun would whole lot tastier    The service good  No complaints there  lot people clearing tables delivering food  keep place pretty clean especially all people going while there   For fast burger MUCH better 5 guys  But nearly close n out  <EOR> A decent burger chain nice thing chain good sized dessert menu   variety custards shakes cakes malts   But main thing still burgers   The Freddy's Original double cheese pretty good   thin bigger patties   flavor standard oily nothing special opinion but solid burger   fries thin type which fry seasoning add which nice   The new Philly cheesesteak bit dry taste could use bit more meat   cheese sauce top pretty good helps sandwich     The turtle custard yummy nice way top off meal! <EOR> My Freddy's experiences high school dating  first time awesome  she could no wrong everything good  But second date case visit where quickly learn she's keeper she's some real annoyances glad when she gets car drive away  Freddy's   the hamburgers flavorful service fast but things quite should be  California steakburgers sound good but beyond steakburger itself just lacking flavor  Perhaps changing toppings might help  onion rings time hard chew case didn't seem quite fully cooked if staff rushing orders    But write call concrete failure  When think concrete dessert mind instantly compares America's standardbearers Ted Drewes frozen custard off Historic Route 66 St  Louis Missouri  offer simple test concrete  Turn cup upside down  If stays put legit  If starts run drip pretender  Freddy's cup maybe 120 degrees rotation before failing miserably  while Hawaiian supposed pineapple macadamia nuts other goodies concrete boring  much dumped trash    Will back?
