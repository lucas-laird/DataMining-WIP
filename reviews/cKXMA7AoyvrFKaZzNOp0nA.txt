<EOR> My girl decided since much comp'd cash losing money casino we'd use comp'd money nice steak dinner chose Tuscany Gardens  expecting good did expect this   The ribeye ordered medium perfectly juicy perfectly pink middle perfectly melted mouth  flat shocked awesome steak was  veggies great garlic mashed potatoes pretty good   The filet girl ordered filet medium rare  also perfectly cooked  huge fan filet feel least tasty cut meat but damn her's freakin good too   I rarely give 5 stars restaurant but service very very fast food absolutely slammin ambiance very classy welcoming also comfortable  rarely total experience restaurant felt 5 stars warranted  Anyways highly recommended if you're steak person ribeye  Damn good steak! <EOR> I chicken parm   good but myself husband agree cook home better   breading did adhere chicken very well   trick coating fall off coat flour egg breadcrumbs set fridge 1 2 hour   realize because would take long food customer   marinara sauce bit acidic   husband lasagna  thought terrible   Pasta sheets mushy dish absolutely no texture   Meat sauce good   Overall service excellent   place very large Friday evening 7pm 10 tables occupied  <EOR> Well decor very old looking ready that  food good over all good portion food does take long you  servers take bit when looking through menu depending time come server bad attitude  feel rushing order your food sometime don't listen very well  seating ok booths way go  because next casino smoke smell  Also restaurant open 24 hrs  <EOR> I hate leaving bad reviews but sure place 4 Star review  use yelp frequently travels find decent places eat   I dinner Sunday place empty when walked but then quickly filled up   I ordered filet sole main entree  arrived quickly table  fish smelled very funny  scared eat it  way way over cooked  wasn't pleasant eat  entire time eating praying myself wouldn't sick next day  The potatoes came burnt point looked charcoals   I rarely leave reviews especially bad ones but felt urge warn fellow Yelpers avoid restaurant all costs <EOR> We dined couple times food ok   The restaurant dark gives nice ambience   Waiters nice but most attentive staff  Which back much tip give people   I would say anywhere near best italian food  eaten but least felt ok eating it!

hidden gem Vegas BEST food  return again <EOR> Tuscany Gardens could great experience   but not  First food spectacular   that good   split stuffed mushrooms bruschetta salads all great   would say best chicken parm ever  However 7 00 reservation 9 00 show   entrees arrived prodding waiter past 8 30  ood  so eat could left   hostess said sometimes food arrive late   Every table served before even when arrived earlier   next time just apologize hon  Such shame   because chef knows food but staff needs trained execute properly <EOR> Das Restaurant ist Bestandteil des Tuscany Hotel Casino Komplex es öffnet abendlich ab 17 00 und eine vorab Reservierung ist empfehlenswert   Das Haus bietet vordringlich italienische Küche ebenso werden Alkoholika zum Essen angeboten   Das Ambiente ist aus meiner Sicht sehr angenehm und ruhig der Kontrast zu dem sonst hektischen Treiben Las Vegas ist eine schöne und willkommene Abwechslung   Der Gast wird unter anderem mit Tischdecke und Servietten aus Stoff verwöhnt eine Wohltat um nicht zu sagen ein must für mein Seelenleben im Zusammenhang mit einem genußvollen Restauranterlebnis   Leider gibt es  keinen Dresscode für die Gäste daher tauchen dann auch Gäste im T Shirt auf   Neben dem Gastraum und einer kleinen Bar bietet das Restaurant auch ein paar Tische im freien falls die Wetterlage es zuläßt   Die Speisekarte enthält neben Vorspeisen und Salaten auch entsprechende Nudelgerichte sowie Fleisch und Fisch  Der Service war sehr zuvorkommend und flott die Bedienung kümmerte sich regelmässig um uns sodass keine Wünsche lange offen blieben   Die Preise für Speisen halten sich für Las Vegas Verhältnisse im Rahmen zwischen 12$ und 28$ bewegt sich der Preis für ein Hauptgericht  <EOR> Great Service! Also romantic calm atmosphere   I Involtine di Pollo  Sauce flavorful but chicken quite dry  Though may fluke because all others table liked food   Definitely dessert!!! many options decided most them =] all very good  <EOR> Had great Italian dinner Tuscany Gardens Tuscany Suites Hotel   atmosphere nice cozy noisy smokey food fantastic   A nice break chaos Las Vegas strip   If you're looking great Italian meal without all craziness Vegas strip place be  <EOR> This restaurant mediocre best same generic Italian food found around country mom n pop diners  Bland chicken parmesan over cooked fish  500 better places eat block away  <EOR> This place best!!! thing friends always come 4 99 steak eggs! used $3 99 but hey $4 99 still cheap price amount food get    We usually come wee hours night when all drunk munchies  steak eggs also comes slice toast cut half hashbrowns! steak itself definitely Morton's steakhouse Ruth's Chris standard but such cheap price tastes AMAZING!  I've always great service whenever came but see why sometimes service bit lacking times  no complaints though  Highly recommended your drunk friends!  **TIP Find cab back your hotel might kind hard since off strip  If your hotel walkable distance highly suggest start waving frantically cabs street you're done eating    That's friends  because hotel far but because girls' feet hurt wearing high heels didn't want walk back  hotel actually only 5mins away cab lol   I'm sure there's easier way cab getting hotel call cab if there's none waiting front hotel but guess more interesting if other way haha  definitely better story tell when came back hotel lol <EOR> oOoOooH hit jackpot Vegas!  Not $$$!  4 dollar steak eggs!  dirt cheap delicious also service wonderful Nuff said    <EOR> Do order anything grilled unless enjoy charcoal briquettes   includes 2 portions salmon asparagus 2 chicken breasts   All requiring scraping off burned bits except asparagus completely inedible   Ignore claims being able substitute gluten free   All sauces contain flour   Even mashed potatoes thickened flour     The waiter did introduce himself gruff when asked questions   He told would easy substitute gluten free 14 year old told none first 3 choices could made gluten free started going item item waiter asking dish gluten free he kept offering come back later instead being willing admit wasn't anything gluten free mains    Then waiter snapped just plain grilled chicken breast asparagus  think he startled when said perfect    then asked gluten free noodles he whined Those take 40 minutes  Gee party 3 kids all GF told start never thought they'd want noodles?
