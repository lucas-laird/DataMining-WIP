Service pretty good perhaps due friend being Taiwanese speaking Cantonese!  cart ladies came around often prices seem reasonable but wouldn't know certain because friend treated dinner  Nice what? Cons personally liked broccoli pork dumplings turnip cakes best   found chicken feet greasy lacking texture skin tasted cold sort congealed fat   Same duck while enjoyed flavor actual duck meat accompanying sauce thought skin more limp crisp which detracted overall enjoyment   Nothing horrible but nothing stood stellar   fun evening some friends glad sampled some dim sum again but think check another Asian eatery next time  <EOR> Overall believe restaurant best dim sum valley  serve all day every day but best time most freshly made dim sum Saturday Sunday lunch time  when most busy dim sum  it'll bit wait but when it'll taste best    There many restaurants valley serve dim sum but Orchids Garden in opinion offers widest variety tasty dim sum dishes most authentic dim sum eating atmosphere   Never shy asking ladies pushing food carts have  may hard understand but WANT order stuff them glad show you  brave try things normally wouldn't eat  may surprised some new delicious flavors  <EOR> I chicken feet lot  melts your mouth  place itself great but dimsum good enough but exactly great  <EOR> Had high hopes place  only expensive but disgusting  REAL dim sum Chicago Chinatown YEARS    place flat sucks  Actually left hungry sick soon after  sister even requested all white meat orange chicken lied said  gave her  point difference between white dark meat  Big time disappointed   never back  <EOR> Best dim sum town!

Overall better dim sum San Gabriel Valley but place cheap really isn't bad  <EOR> TL DR Below average dimsum + Chinese restaurant Vegas  Frozen fresh  Decent place fill your dimsum craving but you'll find better places around similar value   So subpar  Dimsum quality would never fly Bay Area   Today surprisingly busy but wait wasn't long  20 minutes table 5 seated   We ordered basic dimsum xiu mai hargao shrimp noodle rolls  xiu mai bit smaller used back Bay but didn't bother much  Flavor impressive but also didn't disappoint  But didn't taste fresh   it looked frozen   Hargao also little bit smaller used to  Flavor actually subpar tasted nothing  Also looked frozen fresh   Shrimp noodle rolls huge disappointment  No flavor rolls despite being soaked soy sauce  Why that? because SHRIMP damn small! sure sign food kitchen frozen fresh   We also ordered other dimsum dishes such shrimp eggplant chicken feet fried crab balls fried meat balls steamed buns  addition hot sour soup honey walnut shrimp ordered   The shrimp eggplant actually decent  some flavor shrimp but eggplant elevated dish just little more   Chicken feet also decent  sauce tossed coated flavorful but chicken average bit dry looked overcooked   Fried crab balls lot flavor them crab claw embedded ball elevated presentation   Fried meat balls average 95% batter 5% actual meat filling  wouldn't suggest getting st any dimsum place ANYWHERE just greasy lacks bunch flavor   The steamed bun ordered actually Chinese sausage bun  Some flavor present but sausage itself dry shouldn't considered sausage anymore  jerky   The hot sour soup your standard hot sour soup Chinese restaurant  Packed spice sure but flavor itself average   The honey walnut shrimp came pleasant surprise me  Each puny shrimp battered deep fried then tossed bath mayo  VERY different honey walnut shrimp used Bay large shrimp tossed lighter bath mayo thank god battered deep fried   Flavor very much absent due batter but mayo made some missing  Walnuts average standard crunch   Chinese broccoli XO sauce subpar  Completely soaked sesame oil which meant missed freshness vegetables  didn't any sauce can't speak much that    Service lack better word slow observed actually crappy  Rude hostess front killed vibe restaurant  $110 5 people ordered economically friendly but better value places Strip  <EOR> This place probably worse Chinese food ever had  menu smelled should walked point but stayed because starving 4hr drive  figured should play safe since never before ordered shrimp fried rice some green beans  rice absolutely disgusting  No taste ever  No salt no flavor all  green beans ok  waitress seemed surprised barely ate didn't want take left overs  next day hair salon all agreed place terrible food  Honestly next time take chances opt gas station food if to  place worse  eat here!! <EOR> 4 19 2016  Dim Sum excellent    Service excellent  Place clean very nice decor seating crowded    Prices reasonable 3 ate bill $75 tried many dishes left full   Some best Crab Shrimp eaten  really liked place plan returning soon    located  Southeast corner Sahara Lindell   Big enough handle large crowds but still personalized attention  <EOR> Just wanted let know food awesome service very good manager very good person  We did enjoy very much Father's Day whole family  I recommend place anyone Chinese food!!!!!!!! <EOR> Let straight  Chinese buffet where bring food you?

Its bit far strip prices decent  size dishes better affordable  only Dim Sum place tried LV know all other ones bit more pricey may good spot locals but if you've any Chinatown before  would only comeback if friends decide comeback otherwise would pass   The only positive able sit 24 people instantly  Which A OK book! <EOR> Very rude service hostess servers  lead service supervisor rude moment entered restaurant  finally smile when she handed check but still very abrasive  <EOR> First Time ever tried dim sum  very interesting  crab claws amazing  first experience eating Oriental food now because them probably try again <EOR> Always satisfied when maybe cause many times know everything want get   Service quick yes ladies aggressive carts but its fun trying say yes no them since cant understand each other  <EOR> Delicious!!!

The lady Saturday lunch time no joke restaurant full!  people shouting whistling carts full wonderful dim sum whizzing around dining area   steam foul sounding  Chinese language everywhere!  Definitely nice see hustle bustle   Gotta your dim sum order before cart runs wait!  After being seated given regular restaurant menu dim sum menu   nice touch prices given categories pictures used various dim sum easier patrons familiar art dumplings   watched dim sum making before damn truly art because gotta patient able put quality dim sum almost no time flat   Oh aching hands!  Orchids Garden dim sum fairly priced   Still bit more dim sum places Cali but bad Vegas standards   All dim sum dishes range around $2 $6 area something just everyone   Me?  love sticking cheap cheap cheap end dim sum spectrum   think all dim sum should cheap!  supposed akin street food!  heck wants pay $6 friggin' Chinese broccoli?  don't   Some faves Steamed chicken feet love it Steamed BBQ pork bun Pan fried daikon cake Baked BBQ pork bun yummy Shrimp har gow Pan fried chives dumpling chive y Beef rice noodle Mushroom shiu mai  The chicken feet fantastic!  Sticky fatty delicious bowl hot white rice   employ multiple orders whenever go   am also big fan chives dumpling since am onion lover   Each dim sum above $2 $4 range each serving   cheap but expensive breaks bank   better dim sum other places but think Las Vegas pretty good   mention dim sum all day?  appeals lot drunk @$$ people here     I've seen restaurant menu but yet try anything off it   But does massive amount choices which good   But now dim sum up   baby!  Verdict?  Orchids Garden good spot some decent dim sum   fast effective your dim sum comes nice steamy   Service OK although some folks say service bit rude   But then again Chinese restaurants aren't always known having best service   next time dim sum craving can't decide where give Orchids Garden try   Just remember off Sahara Spring Mountain! <EOR> I equate Orchid Garden Wal Mart DIm Sum     It large busy open all time all   certainly best dim sum available   However continue frequent due its convenience mass appeal     Prices change depending whether Chinese   certainly annoying     Since generally busy food usually hot    major plus!
