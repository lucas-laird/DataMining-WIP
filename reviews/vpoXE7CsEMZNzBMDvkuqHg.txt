But more later     The food actually came pretty fast which seemed bit unusual  But reading couple reviews guessing probably sitting bit popped into microwave something  picky all tasted fine whatever   So sitting home done eating watching some Breaking Bad finishing tea  take off lid without second thought began munching ice do  Well eventually decide look into cup see there's little black specs  pretty much all ice cubes  shake around bit find bigger piece of  Now fellow Yelpers worked fast food know gross ice machine if properly cleaned one's you  MOLD   And right forfeited all couple stars going give place being adequate  realize probably eaten places don't practice kitchen cleanliness but when bad fucking see mold ice where draw line  Zero stars  <EOR> I fell love Panang Curry!
