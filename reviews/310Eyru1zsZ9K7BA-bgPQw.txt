This third time eaten 3 strikes you're OUT!  The service bad all 3 occasions but XLB always good suffered through service  But tonight while flavor texture if soup dumplings fine half them NO SOUP them time reached table they popped leaked before reached table    What's soup dumpling without soup?  Now back service  Took several minutes noticed seated half empty restaurant   While plain paper copy menu delivered promptly waited nearly 20 minutes them take order   We also served luke warm tea ask fresh hot tea   Ordered three items repeated order twice still managed forget item   Flavors food good but cannot return place just much struggle enjoy meal! <EOR> We used Three Village which upstairs same shopping center  1900 Chinese Cuisine moved downstairs changed name 1900   placed order even though told most dumplings bao's wanted did have   did notice large table 10 people being served everything wanted   proceeded wait wait wait   20 minutes absolutely no attention waitress husband asked order she said coming out   10 more minutes just left   service beyond dreadful   course never back   terrible experience no reason being treated way!!  Nancy PG <EOR> I would rate 4 1 2 stars because am picky but far favorite Chinese restaurant Las Vegas Valley frequent most despite 20+ minute drive   love xiao long bao dumplings filled soup meat everyone brought here   quite good Flushing NY but still excellent   only 6 95 per order    The beef roll pretty standard but good   really liked sweet sour pork which normally don't order but tasted when friend wanted it    also pork belly stew when green onion pancake great if crispy   recently tried Shanghai fried soup buns pretty good well although would order XLB instead if given choice   XLB definitely highlight often only thing order but other stuff if want almost everything least good better     There times service very slow but always because staff rushing around helping other customers  not bad attitude laziness   Usually busy all when gone   staff always friendly even when walked large group including six kids     FYI now closed Thursdays couple months ago  <EOR> A few friends decided check new place few months ago service ok food good  leave bad review but recently returned if place took complete turn around! Upon entry service terrible could only imagine rest went  30mins asking 5 times finally received waters straight sink   Most ordered seemed its reheated   Wouldn't recommend coming late night  Staff doesn't give 100% service <EOR> Beautiful decoration loved food  10 10 recommend! <EOR> As foodie numerous different restaurants all over Vegas must say never experience more horrible experience dining restaurant 1900  restaurant worst service ever! slow Tuesday night  ordered 5 different plates each plate coming 15 minutes apart each other table  waitress never once even refilled water counter ask them fill twice  When time pay asked server check she never returned  Finally fed service took upon myself pay counter where lady counter just totally ignored made wait while she talked co worker   If 1900 could fix service would great restaurant because food actually pretty good  just simply cannot run restaurant just good food care your customers bit  <EOR> My place soup dumplings Vegas   only other place tried China Mama thought XLBs way better here! However last two times XLBs big all stuck together steamer playing XLB jenga try pick piece XLB without breaking skin  any XLB connoisseur would know might well just eat XLB if skin breaks all soup wasted  mentioned server he just said yeah    Because bigger   Well duh    Anyways good while lasted  searching other places satisfy XLB cravings  if can't find any other good places might come back day pray XLBs no longer stuck together  <EOR> Dont order porkbelly!unless raw shit!

But probably still come back because food still good  Maybe owner read Yelp undo changes  <EOR> Just noticed new sign building decided stop check new restaurant   somewhat redecorated inside improvements seating etc  old establishment used there   Service slow the two girls working front seemed overwhelmed chalked place being new but food excellent worth wait   Cucumber mushroom appetizer salad cool refreshing cumin beef spicy delicious   all all very good! <EOR> Funky loft style decor large space welcomed into restaurant but some serious pink walls   purchased groupon $25 multicourse meal 2 shown menu choose plus could pick desserts appetizers some main menu   However restaurant many items some which would liked try   started pot jasmine tea navigated extensive groupon menu order feast   servers very nice throughout but service slow considering slow Saturday night crowd it relatively early    We started off cucumber enoki salad Eric R  xiao long bao he seemed enjoy lot   salad much more flavorful expected   Next beef broccoli Eric's entree choice came the beef quality fine despite some reviews tasted good   broccoli steamed circled beef no sauce hot did bother but Eric wished broccoli hot beef   dish house made tofu mixed mushrooms   server explained tofu made soymilk egg very nice airy texture served top variety mushrooms tasty sauce mushrooms included black trumpet    soups came next enough 3 small bowls!  hot sour soup which labeled seafood but none it nevertheless did need seafood it   tasty but maybe could used more vinegar   Eric R  Western Beef Lake Soup which ended being egg drop beef tofu he liked lot he saved some take home too   Next choice between cold noodle seafood fried rice   If anyone knows Eric he hates cold noodles doesn't but don't worry! seafood fried rice   shrimp scallops very tasty   took most since came towards end meal   dessert 2 orders red bean xiao long bao because full eat them full even Snowflake Shavery across street!  meal covered groupon including tea just left tip took 5 containers us!
