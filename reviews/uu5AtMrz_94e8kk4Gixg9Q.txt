Coming Filipino here's all need know  guys known mainly Fried Chicken Sweet Spaghetti Burgers Hot Dogs desserts  other items well but mentioned mainly see people eating when there  also all sorts breakfast items well but only served during breakfast hours  link complete menu just case wondering  http www jollibeeusa com menu html  Whenever see Jollibee most cases see Chow King Red Ribbon well because all three basically same company  Now Chow King Red Ribbon completely separate reviews lets talk Jollibee   Now why most chains originate other countries just don't same appeal when open locations abroad? always asked myself  Could something Lost translation? LOL    Anyways most common reason people come crispy fried chicken comes mild spicy aptly named Chickenjoy   Now many non Filipinos when order first time surprised comes gravy  Ironically even more surprised tastes good it! think biscuits ham turkey gravy  But chicken? Hay don't knock til try it   As Spaghetti its definitely used to  Filipino style Spaghetti kind sweet style ketchup sliced American hot dog slices ground beef  Again seems weird combination but most cases pleasantly surprised   As prices well last time ordered two 8 piece buckets  spicy other mild  Total came 23 bucks change  11 dollars bucket  Why expensive ask? Beats me  only thing think aren't many Jollibees around fact each piece spicy chicken little spicy flag tells specific person does only all day  person needs paid  LOL   Service? Well pretty much same whatever other fast food chains would patronize  Obviously more packed place longer gotta wait your food  recommend just call ahead order time wait times minimum   Last but least  Desserts  guys its simple  three choices  Halo Halo Pearl Coolers Crispy Deep Fried Pies   Halo Halo translated English Mix Mix Shaved ice evaporated milk mixed certain fruits jelly flan topped scoop Ube Vanilla ice cream    Pearl Coolers basically smoothies boba tapioca pearls  usually several different flavors ranging Ube Avocado   Pies best way describe guys remember when McDonalds used apple pies deep fried golden crisp? Well same set but different flavors  Peach Mango Banana Langka  So overall ok 3 star rating pick because food decent but bit pricey  fact its chain significantly drop 2 but guys decent job trying serve same authenticity its original base Philippines  <EOR> Wasn't really impressed     read many reviews Jollibee west coast some try some Jollibee   I chicken steak patty   don't eat pork famous spaghetti glass noddles question    chicken avenge   oily crust light hot fresh    gravy good well   only thing didn't steak!  mushy room temperate    Over all Popeyes better Jollibee gravy     <EOR> So arrived Vegas crack dawn wanting drive through desert  LA during day where desert heat would just kill you  First order day breakfast Jollibee    MOST breakfast fare just reeking grease  Literally  Plus salt everything just toooo salty period  Jollibee people quite health conscious nowadays start watch eat  please tweak your products little better keep your customers somewhat healthy! <EOR> Worst play too    wer trying charge gravy when didnt even give gravy order expect eat spoon fork kind place u    Bad customoer service give star just sonincan post coz incant post star <EOR> Today December 29 2015 Tuesday 12noon run SPICY chickenjoy  family travelled all way New Mexico it  big disappointment  should gone other location  <EOR> Affordable fast food taste good pretty filling  aren't always consistent crispiness towards last hours closing    What's great Dessert right next door only 10ft ordering  <EOR> My experiences Jollibee Seafood City Regal Village Square mostly disappointing   bought large fries today $3 34 more less 20 french fries   Yes literally count it   satisfy customers' cravings Filipino taste fast food?  complained manager all he said they're just following company's policy measurements food   weighing counting it?
