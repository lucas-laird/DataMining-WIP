I Roy's before at now closed Summerlin location where best sushi roll life  a Town Country featured wagyu beef crab  so ordered Lakanilau which similar ingredients  course butterfish entree lime tart dessert  husband poke bowl sea scallops Japanese cheesecake  also complimentary bowl edamame which served midcourse  Without prix fixe deal food alone would set back $127 but bottle wine pretty handsome tip whole meal only $140  Quite bargain!  But food? standout definitely poke bowl  beautifully presented delicious mix ahi salmon hamachi  would come back alone! Everything else good but nothing really stood although butterfish pretty tasty   guess lofty goals Lakanilau which fine but little disappointing   Overall great meal glad spent birthday there  Mostly because price right but also because found best poke bowl town! <EOR> This Wife's Favorite place eat out  take every time town  lot off menu everything good  taken care every time come    thank you  <EOR> Roy's escape crazy city call Vegas     Not far off strip you'll find Roy's tucked between number other great franchise restaurants Fogo De Chao etc   modern building valet normal parking   Once inside you'll greeted modern hawaiian theme warm tones   restaurant noticeably more quiet other restaurants visited Vegas   didn't love decor atmosphere but refreshing change pace your normal Vegas restaurants   The service best ever experienced restaurant   multiple times even different cities consistently exceeds expectations   If celebrating special occasion let them know you'll treated special evening   friends birthday provided customized menu's birthday note took provided printed picture table   picture framed Roy's birthday paper frame keepsake   The food as well other Roy's visited other cities always delicious   Vegas Salmon hanger steak butterfish macadamia crusted mahi mahi   Again all delicious no complaints any entrees   portions healthy size too   can't wrong   The best thing try Roy's Chocolate Soufflé   best dessert ever had    hands down   basically molten cake raspberry vanilla bean ice cream   even right good damn thing is     even right  <EOR> I stopped restaurant group friends recommended place   restaurant itself dimly lit very romantic classy looking   started off bottle wine service great!  appetizers decent   calamari crisp soggy fried tasting   Someone ordered cut roll California roll? okay   think just wasn't place cut rolls   But when dinner came everything looked yummy   Butterfish seemed big hit   All fish moist tender!  must save room molten lava cake!  agree everyone else   it's good!!

Roy's Oahu Hawaii boyfriend last summer amazing!! Therefore when deciding restaurant New Years Eve boyfriend parents thought Roy's would excellent option  Roy wrong!! Upon arriving table told four course only option night  would've nice know when booked reservation four days advance  party four ended sending 3 dishes back kitchen! typically don't send dishes back because don't want rude but no choice instance  kitchen open restaurant floor constantly managers inspecting each dish personally delivering them each table   why am surprised food good all  Great service but restaurant could greatly benefit menu kitchen staff overhaul! sucked because paid pricey four course meal NYE left disappointed unsatisfied  would've happy pay money quality food but just case  Pros Coconut Frappe signature drink Garlic Prawns appetizer service  Otherwise waste your money  <EOR> 5 stars! Excellent service staff  Good selection food drinks  say place very nice ambiance best chocolate soufflé town! 4x past 2 weeks taking friends east coast  pleasantly surprised first time because said attire casual but service presentation food everything exceeded expectations!

Can't believe he said that  Apparently food good other reviews read but due incredibly crappy service husband refuses set foot again probably never try it  <EOR> Service word     incredible!  We Roys celebrate wife's birthday checked reviews Yelp before Las Vegas feedback Roys pretty nice  When arrived noted reservation through Open Table I noted wife's birthday greeted seated right away  waitress short stack menus looked she way class   When seated opened menu happy birthday page wife's name nice quote  Great touch very personalized! The waiter very helpful without being overbearing know checking every 10 minutes  Rather allowed enjoy meal but recieved attention when gave subtle signals  She ordered surf n turf lobster filet mignon  cooked filet perfection she said everything awesome  I macadamia encrusted mahi mahi delicious   Then brought little birthday plate small fruit little cake  nice but cool part happy birthday date written chocolate plate  Again nice touch  When brought plate waiter took photo then came back photo frame note back  Funny thing wife's eyes shut photo asked if could take again no problem!  We two managers come check towards end meal  seemed generally interested just going through motions   Be prepared tough decisions because many delicious looking items menu!
