Really?  call Strip restaurant?  people embarrassment culinary arts service   Please stop wasting peoples time money    just close    Are your servers trained?  found off street merely pulse?  kid brought food bolted fast couldnt even ask ketchup   What joke    <EOR> Giving English Food bad name  As if English food doesn't bad enough reputation  menu looks very impressive but just didn't deliver advertised  Food We didn't order many items but come fish chips should down  fish good nice batter nice fish but service way fish came just above lukewarm chips even colder  Perhaps because sat under heat lamp long  Hard believe couldn't arrange 2 order fish chips two other dishes prepared same time  skirt steak wife also barely luke warm bread sorry crostini served bigger steak  served Fritos  Fritos   seriously 20$  The half lb prime beef daughter probably best thing saw although 24$ served hard hoagie  Desert Gingerbread frozen sent back  sitting under heat lamp bowl ice cream several minutes  see service   ginger bread hard rock strange flavored ice cream replaced Cheesecake  cheesecake bit clotty but overall hard tell good bad considering drowned berry compote served with  Should renamed ' berry compote w cheesecake    Luckily e waiter decided grab heat lamp waiter busy [chatting]  Service Quite funny watch manager busy minute trying expedite kitchen next minute sitting down 'friends' table stuffing gob getting grub on   Did tell man hungry?

Before she brought drinks server asked if ready order seemed inconvenienced when mentioned would order appetizer  However ordered mussels really delicious  food came before finished appetizer  ordered Lobster Rolls fiance ordered RIbeye  Lobster Rolls delicious  cannot express much loved them  Definitely must try if happen want try place out  fiance's ribeye cooked well however potato wedges came cold soggy  time both waters empty good 15 minutes  Once finally servers attention she annoyed when explained wedges cold  During time table front complaining manager food taking long time manager complete jerk them  Both fiance servers never witnessed worse customer service  manager rude condescending told table lying food taking long time said want it? reason chose speak manager because rude saw being  then asked server seen only 3 times all night box food because just wanted leave    Worst service ever experienced  never back  cannot believe place reputation allows management treat customers badly  fiance friends live Las Vegas travel least once year  food good shame ruin such rude negligent customer service  <EOR> I 3 times 4 day trip yeah liked it  best deal happy hour 3 6pm every day  half price pints them affordable $7 St Bernardus tap!

If opportunity head back some more brews snacks though I'd probably try hit happy hour keep cost contained  <EOR> I ate lunch family Saturday  mediocre best  atmosphere is   pubby obviously which fine    but food blaaahh    ordered roast beef sliders which dry boring  ate 2 3    only because doused them mustard  fries pickles good but expect little more T E  No group claimed meal excellent    If you're new mall you're better off @ Wolfgang Social house lunch   <EOR> Food fish chips great  Sliders good funky beef flavor  Buffalo wings less stellar  Blue cheese wedge just ok    Ambiance decent Vegas vibe slightly boring but lunch time    Service Good seated right away    Prices high but Vegas!   Can't really recommend because many better places eat  <EOR> Good service  Wide range choice menu  Food well prepared delivered promptly  Background music little loud  Overall well priced value money good experience  <EOR> We decided stop some apps beers checking City Center area   beer selection pretty good some local craft brews menu   beers general bit pricey tho $9 Stella $14 Delerium Tremens      We sat bar area atmosphere very open comfortable   Easy hold conversation would nice place take date drinks   apps good   sliders very tasty   However service ended being poor waitress seeemed disappear 20 minutes leaving empty glasses   I would gone three stars but came bathroom the sink area shared both guys gals couple girls giggling fooling around ended making each other    Anytime bar see couple girls play some tonsil hockey each other deserves extra star  <EOR> Two years ago submitted one star review  totally directed manager decision  received very nice apology restaurant via e mail returned many times since then  Enough times many bar staff recognize us  Unfortunately last visit another bad experience  halfway through first beers ordered early dinner  hour later more beer still hadn't received any food  felt couldn't wait any longer closed tab  needed food offset alcohol  sure whose fault was  Again bar staff mostly attentive  understand big turnover lately  New ownership  Anyway   don't know if food still good  Since didn't any    <EOR> Although didn't love happy hour sliders really enjoyed lobster rolls! beer list phenomenal  <EOR> Great happy hour 3 6pm another starts 10  All wine beer champagne glass half off! Pretty much can't wrong any food menu choose however stand lobster rolls  Amazing! <EOR> This review when husband New Year's Eve  don't know if normally is   It's fun atmosphere decorations fun some tables opinion pulling your own beers=pretty cool concept   They also think if chugg beer under 2 mins  pay beer stipulations apply sure but people doing night   The service 2 5 they kind pushy very friendly    And wasn't impressed price  two beers dirty chips  bill 45 dollars  seems unjustifiably  high me    Won't back  many good places try bother returning overpriced mediocre  <EOR> Food average  Place noisy couldn't hear your table without megaphone  sure describe ambiance except say someone's Las Vegas attempt urban something  Really expected more less  <EOR> The star lobster rolls which quite good  rest? walked away both unhappy queasy   Start beer visited PUB right opened left without ordering because first three beer picks  Tonight? Same story  Also could first two mixed drinks husband requested but finally managed vodka tonic   I ordered roast beef sliders  roast beef just ok but bread dry hard cold  also ordered side fries which served dead cold  server did new hot order without argument then brought bottle ketchup which ask because only plebes want ketchup? absolutely crusted old hard ketchup   The last straw drunk guy decided sit table chat  chased off waiter came over commented it  After  Thanks  1 4 full restaurant I'd love little more monitoring staff   I'm sorry didn't take time ask manager complain but really wanted vacation  If you're also vacation choose NobHill MGM Sensei Bellagio even Todd English Olives Caesars MUCH better food same unexciting beer selection eventually discover available PUB  <EOR> This review truly pains write  Todd English absolute favorite restaurants town years however apparently changed chefs management recently turned mine husbands once LOVED dishes into pale comparison former selves    I cannot even tell number visit TE but say never experienced service poor last night    To start off walked ask table 2 outside  She seated 2 top against wall  pretty cramped back asked if could please move 1 bigger empty dirty tables once cleaned off  She said tell your server turned back returned conversation w other hostess  Hmm   Ok let told server he moved us    Now getting sad stuff  9 56pm  According receipt  intentions ordering Happy Hour chicken wings love much appetizer Fried Bologna Sandwich   waiter informed wasn't HH yet  wasn't aware time didn't know mere minutes away agreed order 3 wings  expressed them plain possibly mistake expressing no sauce   when came needed sent back  Upon original arrival though discovered those wings come know love  now double jointed wing which thankfully still tastes same but became change #1!    Next Fried Bologna Sandwich came thought myself WTH this!  once incredible sandwich down graded nothing more deli sandwich any old chain  asked when changed waiter told always way look face said don't know you're talking but  same! decided check if anyone ever posted picture old sandwich Yelp verify going crazy  Thankfully found picture but just let made mental note never order item again   At point because know crazy already seen 2 very significant changes dishes even mentioned menu which btw looks exactly same always decided time ask other changes made if favorite dish lobster rolls same  He said yes same unfortunately blindly trusted employee over gut instinct     My husband ordered usual Prime Beef Carvery which now comes served dissolving paper almost ended mouth because meat now served drenched jus  Another change rendered dish inedible husband   mention beef itself sad substitute large hefty slices he always gotten past!  Onto lobster rolls  Thankfully much other smaller size rolls little much mayo used mix but could 1 batch thing don't hold against them restaurant    When waiter came over asked everything completely honest expressed all displeasure most notably husband's dish gravy sauce whatever dish made inedible turned decorative paper into part meal  waiter again said nothing changed dish but finally agreed ask chef     Well well well know right every single change addressed waiter denied  While respect waiter finally telling truth extremely disappointing took entire displeasing meal pushing so!  He informed everything changed because new chef asked he could us  Unfortunately only thing any better back AMAZING Todd English PUB loved much    I'd also note no point did manager come over express apologies anything!  good  especially when 2 locals would frequently drive strip solely eat your restaurant!  only thing done regrettable meal husband's dish taken off bill    When seated waiter asked if dined before confirmed had  point he should told recent changes menu  I guess maybe would happened he actually known changes  As why decided give 1 star even though some food edible because upon leaving occurred sad reality wasn't just bad night kitchen could rectified     food now permanently  no going back TE  Pub loved  <EOR> Delicious food drinks but WAY overpriced  think Sculpin IPA $14  Ahhh Vegas     <EOR> Fun day Todd English pub quick lunch   great lunch made even more enjoyable bartenders Eleanor Armstrong Laura Berger   Talk outstanding customer service!

Honestly wish would just ordered waffle fries called day  fries delicious albeit no way worth $9 but least would made lunch less pricey overall   ranch way dilly definitely does taste regular ranch  quite disappointed huge restaurant ranch fan   To weekend started boyfriend also ordered beer  Guess much cost? $14 beer! theme review  crazy! fact crazy he only ordered beer sure when last time seen stick beer restaurant    I'd willing offer four stars food if prices weren't high but quality just doesn't match price tag is  Although complimentary popcorn nice touch wasn't worth $70  <EOR> Been several times  must say really love place  Although am currently sobriety fix through August great place throw back several beers amongst best friends or strangers just met    Beer selection VERY good  Lot's great imports craft beers  Also your usual more well known American counterparts PBR  Tuesday nights 9 12am PBR 8oz cups nickel  Think all hijinks would ensure   I've never eaten here  Only drank hungout  Food portions look amazing looks high quality stuff  foodie friends strangers seem really enjoy trust opinions   After all doesn't trust stranger? <EOR> Was impressed place   pastrami reuben meat stringy chewy   better ruebens sports bars half charge here   wife pork belly sliders very fatty very flavorful   fries good but everything else disappointing especially prices  <EOR> What disappointment  hard time awarding PUB even two stars food bad  came 5 minutes 11 told could only order off late night menu starts 11  Okay     Wait let back up  husband wanted sit outside  asked server area if ok if sat ourselves thinking he could just send hostess menus he gave shitty look told no way  Jerk    So back food tried roast beef sliders chicken wings chips  first order sliders received came COLD  Nothing biting into cold beef bun Whiz sauce your stomach turn  hubs wings which kind mushy very mediocre  far best dish chips which ordered curry sauce even though wasn't offered option menu  something would recommend although hard time any pub doesn't regularly offer chips curry even gastropub should right  no HP sauce  mean seriously???!  The beer selection pretty poor pub well  When think pub think selection variety key  variety don't mean Stella PBR    The only reason why award PUB second star because server very sweet quickly replaced cold sliders requested special curry sauce generally tried take care despite lackluster food beverage offerings    Pass PUB  <EOR> I mixed feelings place gave three   Food excellent once right  But fries came cold send them back    Additionally party 5  3 meals brought out  Then 5 minutes later  Then last another 5 minutes  pretty standard restaurants wait until all your meals ready bring them sure if staff new if just unorganized  <EOR> OK first rule when you're sitting bar Throw peanut shells floor bar!

Service slow unattentive  Never again  <EOR> Two words cast beer   Beer conditioned casks naturally carbonated often thicker mouthfeel flavor   casked Black Butte Porter amazing!  Served room temperature very carbonated could taste all fine flavors well crafted porter   bad choice Tomato Onion salad blue cheese dressing but worth it!  The beer choices some best Strip only establishment serving casked beer   probably would settled 3 star review but fact pretty impressive    The food pretty good   only Tomato onion salad which just that   two thick slices yummy tomato two slices onion   more appetizer real salad   probably wouldn't order weird thing again but all friends enjoyed dishes   Most upscale burger sandwich type things   Ah serve popcorn complimentary appetizer  The biggest downside Todd English pricing   steep let's face it   also Strip where overpricing norm Todd's gets pass   fact matter establishment aimed craft beer drinker alone won heart!  Cheers Todd English! <EOR> Awesome place great service  Richard Baldino awesome server  Great beer selection!! <EOR> Went Bloody Mary worth trip! fully loaded entire meal itself  Ordered brunch all needed  Other person party ordered regular Bloody Mary meal  Food ok bar lively service nothing spectacular but fine  Honestly all Bloody Mary!
