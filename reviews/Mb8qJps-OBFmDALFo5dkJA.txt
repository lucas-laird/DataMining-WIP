My fish chips consisted realllllly salty fries mushy tarter sauce large piece fish   wth??  never seen just large piece fish when ordering fish chips   But starving doing snowshoe hike sometimes when you're hungry you'll eat anything then pay price later lol   fish obviously frozen sort gray looking dipped batter separated fish altogether   ick hindsight sums up     After waiting 40 minutes table why sure server sure tell putting 11 orders separate checks vs  check going take LOT longer food checks   Why couldn't he put food order cooks order figure check later??  Sure enough took longer food getting table   appeared kitchen orders done timely matter but food sat served cold everyone table   server kindly explained took longer entering orders   Then he didn't remember anyone ordered   Then he brought soy sauce instead balsomic   mention half table done eating time other half food   Kevin probably finest server staff     As if food server wasn't bad enough place honestly dump   old worn wrinkled carpet taped baseboards duck tape littered food   chair cushions held velcro outdated dirty   Everything thing place musty worn outdated dirty dingy   mention unappealing     Again its very sad see but understandable depressed state operation   predict shut down health department due financial reasons     Don't waste your money fun crowded country lodge top hill instead   NEVER again!! <EOR> Breakfast great!
