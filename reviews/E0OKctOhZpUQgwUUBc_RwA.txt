I don't always salad but realllly don't care burgers  tri tip sandwich which comes sourdough bread  Everything tastes better sourdough  also tempura green beans ranch bomb well  Try strawberry limeade refreshing hot ass summer days   One thing note parking SUCKS  restaurant located super busy shopping center off Blue Diamond Decatur ton surrounding businesses all jam packed into little corner  drive thru but because food made order sitting while  <EOR> The burger remember getting kid   YUMMY!!
