Other requests such extra hot pepper sauce no green onions easily fulfilled but something supposed included incomplete  honestly scared order more two items thinking won't enough rice three four dishes   On another note beef short rib soup heavenly  Tender pieces meat falling off bone simple but rich beef broth flavored daikon mushrooms green onions onions  came noodles once but last night's didn't it    Bibimbap mushrooms lettuce kosari zucchini bean sprouts carrots meat plus fried egg  Comes hot pepper paste sesame oil side  All toppings come warm cold  also came side miso soup which Korean style spicy!

AYCE almost always complete crap as most y'all already know! everyone knows U U PAY FOR! = <EOR> I eaten Honey Pig Henderson 3 different occasions    The first time food excellent services rocky  attributed being new location everyone just getting speed    The second visit three weeks later same quality food but slower service  No big deal still within few months opening! Enjoyable but still service big distraction   Fast forward today    wife father attempted eat but even acknowledged three different servers! all walked past print checks various departing tables   When entered 5 un bussed tables some meat still burning cooktops  twenty minutes passed waiting acknowledged customers before simply walked across street Hot n' Juicy Crawfish    Honey Pig short staffed didn't attempt hide it  simple greeting host some type would least let know interested getting freshly bussed table!  If want would customer service portion your restaurant! want but if don't care why should I? <EOR> This place renewed faith Korean BBQ! All eat deal worth every penny! Standouts bulgolgi seasoned pork belly  kimche placed cooking dish which prefered bc don't cold cabbage  waitresses came essentially turned meat over cooked all table which am glad bc no clue if meat done not    first asked fried rice which serve end meal cook surface where all your delicious meats kimche cooked left little morsels behind giving unbelievable infusion flavor into fried rice definitely save room little gem flavor end your meal   Amazing service though all around! <EOR> Was craving KBBQ especially some bomb ass pork belly last Sunday decided check place out  also location Chinatown    AYCE deal $27 per person  meats pretty good  Pork belly good expected  only sense because pig name  love big ass stone grill no holes them because cooks carmelizes meats evenly  also place kimchi bean sprouts grill which kind neat    Not much variety banchan  also only order kalbi jumulluk per person which kind disappointing   Restaurant clean  Servers nice    Will back? knows considering lot options KBBQ now city  <EOR> What treat!! Finally BBQ place Henderson!! waiting Korean BBQ place honey pig great! excellent service food meat quality awesome!! Love love place!! <EOR> Was craving Korean BBQ pretty close said grand opening figured would try out    The food good service pretty bad    Walk seated pretty fast restaurant wasn't full plenty servers  sat down looked menu which takes 5 10 mins   Now Korean BBQ places give your waters salads macaroni whatever but no came offered even water 30 mins  When you've waiting long water pretty annoyed   So finally water order food AYCE food good   Now another weird thing felt didn't really let cooked own food which whole experience KBBQ  Whenever saw using chopsticks kind move meat around would run over tell no then move themselves   Wasn't happy whole experience hear would honestly rather find somewhere else little more traditional  <EOR> Amazing restaurant!amazing service!The employees friendly!The food beyond expectations!I recommend restaurant all residents tourists all! <EOR> Got some bulgogi delivered they're pretty over priced here  They're fairly new side town   maybe its because that  All better korean bbq places Chinatown which little bit drive  Maybe need actually sit down cook bbq myself because just wasn't impressed cooked selection delivery  updated review soon based solely cooked delivery option  <EOR> I really good lunch here  Food high quality delicious  first glance restaurant seemed very pricey   ordered #3 combo presented enormous array food  Turns probably intended multiple people but menu didn't really specify that  stuffed when came time leave  Service very attentive  Good place overall but next time bringing friends  <EOR> There many Korean bbq place along spring mountain but closest home Hendo   three pork item combo pork belly pork neck marinated pork    comes tofu bean soup fried rice   first place cooks kim chi bean sprouts grill   don't care step   number banchans served meal scarce compared other Korean bbq spots around time     It decent but many other better spots HP  <EOR> Worst service ever! drawn smell outside since said Grand Opening thought would support them  Way expensive is  food great better  Very disappointing  again  <EOR> They charged tip without telling you  surprised check because already put 15% tip inside it  did notice first gave another 15%  took it  Avoid one  Liars  <EOR> First time coming service good but slow don't know when busy 1 star because price wasn't worth get  sides offer almost all just veggies  Really disappointing many other Korean BBQ places rice paper steamed egg etc sides  brisket  any other KBBQ place but pork belly good  2 people cost $85 without dessert  disappointed place even skipped ice cream macaroons  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised many ways! entire staff enthusiastic witty friendly informative  People more comfortable manning own grill without help might coming because staff really hands present through whole meal  restaurant itself nicely decorated clean  looks feels much more updated original location  family shared combo order rather all eat really pleased all included selection  never seen loud talkative grandma quiet because she really chowing down  throw kimchi beansprouts grill which may everyone but family definitely liked it  really convenient having drive across town excellent KBBQ  returning soon more satisfying dinners  <EOR> Excellent traditional Korean BBQ hot pot  food fresh service quick prompt polite! music didn't blare conversation  We'll definitely back! <EOR> What place good cook stone barbecue   may many choices some corporate Korean BBQ places but meat better quality   warn if want cook meats yourself other Korean BBQ places need tell them advance   Otherwise cook you   takes away half fun Korean BBQ opinion but more happy let cook ourselves when asked advance   Again can't say enough cooking stone   really taste difference   come everybody must stone  <EOR> my sister crazy fans Korean culture watch lot dramas wanted experience whole thing When waitress Korean actually could see ajumas cooking We decided all eat special The waitress explained eat first side dishes different meets The Kimchi amazing different other places portions very good too I ask kimchi stew  included all eat menu It really good delicious All meets fresh top quality The waitress cooked  everything grill They Korean beer course soju We request Korean music she played us I definitely recomed place Its little pricey but worth it We coming back sure! <EOR> Went dinner family satisfied  big plus start cooking thingvhad holes oil gets drained each meat doesnt wnd getting oily   very big plus  meats fresh pork belly very tasty well pork neck  spicy pork more sweet spicy taste but everyone else loved it  kimchi good serve hot  AYCE tad pricy next time probably combo which combination meats  Nice neighborhood  <EOR> Early often during first year relationship girlfriend would frequent Honey Pig  She never tried Korean BBQ Honey Pig! became battlecry long weeks major life events celebrate  time passed but restaurant continued celebrate its Grand Opening quality service became schizophrenic unpredictable  Asking food became chore cooking food staff felt unnecessary burdensome  Staff routinely overcooked some items tending heat properly began fighting tongs between rounds   Our disappointment Honey Pig climaxed around holidays  family town girlfriend called ahead reserve table large group  staff accepted reservation showed promptly service  no table staff attempted sit six full grown adults table four  obvious staff just seated group six table intended us  objected four person table proceeded wait thirty minutes second table  Despite reservation frequent visits we're confident recognized us furious last time ate Honey Pig   My biggest concern? entirely sure charge here  once nearly dozen trips Honey Pig owner manager ever greeted us   unacceptable such absent ness beginning show  No ever asked meal  No ever asked feedback  staff careless unobservant other two persons upset debacle around holidays  embarrassed family  abundance great AYCE Korean BBQ alternatives Las Vegas surprised place survived forgiving trip trip trip  No more  <EOR> Our first time left very disappointed  Shocked would serve dried Salmon side dishes limited  Service poor even though almost empty  Better drive elsewhere <EOR> Came back place today husband father law  15 min later told 3 different ppl would take just second   No hi any kind mention long would take table  other clients also left because waiting long  bad  2 other times blast  Food great but time seems did enough people working take care all clients  don't know if come back soon anymore  Very disappointed <EOR> My boyfriend starving no idea where eat drove around came upon Honey Pig  surprised didn't know opened AYCE near us    Anyway place nice overall  table sat oily seats  But no big deal! service bad but wouldn't say great either  try cook but then leave while then tried cook meat because started burnt then  when lady would come table  Majority reason why only giving 3 stars because when time grill change ended putting lemon grill take off char  Uhh if don't want your meat tasting lemon ask whole new grill!! she cleaned off char lemon she continued cooking meat  couldn't finish rest  the taste off appetizing  Other place decent  I'd back but next time saying NO lemon lol  Just change grill give new ones please! Come on! Just all other AYCE places!   So when time change your grill just ask new Oh she didn't charge extra meat couldn't eat  thank goodness! <EOR> Their service really terrible today  sat good 15 minutes no even came table  People came served! wasn't even busy tonight maybe 6 tables filled  sad because really food  Maybe off day but still  the service unacceptable  <EOR> AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants used confined Spring Mountain nice them open place close Henderson   I actually live closer local location Gen but Honey Pig more impressive when tried first Las Vegas location  excited hear coming fun part Eastern Ave many other restaurants friends try work Friday night  south side huge plaza just across alleyway Big 5 Sporting Goods   We seated quickly but despite relative lack customers server took lot time start grill take order  yeah might still kinks training staffing level fortunately weren't hurry  wanted all eat dinner $24 95 all which means spending enough time stuff yourself   The cooking attentive experienced before meats started but necessarily finished so pull meats yourself before overcooked   Still better some places which just bring meats leave all cooking you  meats impressive recall original location pork belly being standout pork neck also impressive  beef brisket fine kalbi beef short rib tender delicious but bulgogi listed marinated roast meat wasn't special slightest  Also wasn't fan spicy chicken boneless rib shrimp which saw prone overcooking but spicy squid nice its texture   As other actual food side salad fresh rather addictive kimchi little sweet side alright but palatable all tablemates bean sprouts fine and interestingly textured when overdone crisp banchan very different Spring Mountain location but still great  eggplant favorite pickled daikon also delicious spicy beans tofu good too  servers quite attentive refilling iced barley tea  should note only salted sesame oil sweet dipping sauce available the original location paste don't recall using often    Despite having varied menu its competitors new location Honey Pig delicious spot stuff your stomach meat  I'd probably back lunch if could $17 95 only shrimp beef short rib excluded meats but dinner would work well  Oh certainly more nicely decorated lit other Honey Pig  <EOR> Wow! first location Spring Mountain several times happy friend noticed having soft opening tonight   many study openings far best experience!   Staff very friendly stayed top grill   even kept iced teas filled! Meats all really good sides   We definitely back! <EOR> I'm going start review stating service deserves 4 5 stars but food    First time H P last  Its great find KBBQ Henderson Gen packed all time! Visited H P because didn't want wait over hour Gen wanted stay close home area Henderson Jun's AYCE lol    I request AYCE menu kind hiding because girl front gave standard large menu  Price AYCE $26 98  ordered large steamed eggs al la carte around $10 SKIP  Taste gross  even sure properly steamed  ran Japjay spell check   clear stir fried noodles   restaurant offers warming kimchee bbq grill wasn't fan  Cold taste way better  bean sprouts didn't taste good  salad okay    After taxes + tip meal wasn't worth $85 2 people  return    Gen Galleria Mall best AYCE KBBQ Hendy  <EOR> While loved vegetarian mushroom option Honey Pig offered disappointed variety quantity banchan served along meal my favorite part Korean BBQ     The vibe inside restaurant fun TVs playing some old school K Pop which interesting watch listen to  employees all very helpful great when passed servers would stop help flip meat veggies currently grill  table round but space between grill edge pretty small making difficult maneuver  especially trying pass any side dishes around etc  <EOR> Great Korean BBQ   Service prompt lunch   prepare grill food all traditional accompaniments included meal   $29 beef combo which stated two people but much food would easily served 3 4  <EOR> Yay! Korean BBQ without having fight Spring Mountain traffic! Honey Pig nice clean! hostess servers friendly  food pretty tasty  When order spicy dish super duper spicy actually comply  best bang your buck going AYCE save room your tummy ahead time  only complaint insist cooking food you  just fan that  interrupts flow conversation  Please give tongs cook meats way want rare medium well done   Overall better Korean BBQ places  <EOR> Mine Codys first visit food Great service very good your taste buds crazy beef player    amazingly delicious    back! <EOR> The meat quality good but unfortunately favorite meat Kalbi short ribs which all eat only let order order per person!  Which only slice!  Very disappointed   If you're Kalbi lover suggest don't AYCE  <EOR> To find KBBQ place Henderson mind blowing when first saw them build restaurant however I'd recommend making drive Chinatown something much better  Setting situated busy parking lot BJs hot n juicy brew tea bar taco y taco lot places dine  Inside decently spaced well ventilated   Service props manager Jihye busting ass while some other servers just taking easy   yourself huge favor cut weak links because destroying your flow   Food quality meats pretty bad  think Asian market pick better pork belly ones here  grills don't filter fats juices well just cooks meat making look steamed caramelized  Also never seen carrots inside bean paste soup  just prepared  soon dae guk which tasted store bought   Overall KBBQ place Henderson especially busy plaza you'd think would well but quality meat lack service other manager rather drive Hobak wait 2 hours there <EOR> We love place   Food rocks   Can't wrong food   Service little hit miss  <EOR> This review take order  ordered bibimbap chicken ginseng soup go  bibimbap items nearly placed piece foil over easy egg top  tiny bit oily settled bibimbap sauce included  amount meat put thing isn't even enough satisfy 2 year old son   chicken ginseng soup literally whole cornish hen which fine   except when take soup container you're left two shot glasses worth soup   free banchan side dishes probably best part sorry meal   Oh did mention didn't give any rice soup clearly says includes rice ?  big deal but did also mention didn't give any freakin rice bibimbap which rice dish Christ sake?? sorry ass meal  give 2 stars because your sides ok  <EOR> The food average but Service lacking   two middle aged Korean servers aloof attitude completely inattentive dining needs   third time dining location live nearby seven hills  severs also spilled water mom's pants she cleared table  type people complain but think place needs better management cuz service horrible!  Overpriced competition eastern ave Henderson place won't last  <EOR> Well 9 year old daughter liked it  ate 1pm Thursday only customers  Good service  wife love Korean BBQ but put bottom list  Everything good      but just great   The restroom awesome! Good location  I traditional iron cooking surface use  I'd only come back if someone else paid  <EOR> Nice clean place  Memorial Day no crowd   the bad    full price AYCE $27 00 bucks The selection banchan side dishes ok taste average  star place pork belly brisket  Try cooking pork belly kimchi extra flavor  ribeye portions small meat little tough  Ordered cold buck wheat noodles   the broth luke warm   it should cold ice authentic Korean experience   bbq some short ribs eat cold noodles    The staff attentive friendly   we only ones there   LOL ! back lunch price during week day located Henderson   no more long drive Spring Mountain area! ! <EOR> I ordered honey pig through UberEATS  really craving some spicy pork husband craving some bulgogi but isn't anywhere around does small portion option settled just seeing UberEATS area  Lo behold Korean place  ordered 2 bento boxes  1 spicy Pork 1 bulgogi husband  excited because bento boxes seemed liked perfect solution  can't really rate service since through UberEATS but food decent  delivered nice disposable bento boxes which liked  kept everything blending  also nice portion sizes  often don't AYCE because don't end ordering enough worth it The bento included meat option fried dumpling miso soup rice table sides  Both spicy pork bulgogi pretty good  Both fried dumplings 4 totally completely burned don't mean slightly past golden either  also wasn't fan kimchi more just pickled cucumbers  Would order bento delivery again? Probably same situation where lazy don't want cook  <EOR> First time Honey Pig very impressed  food tasted great really recommend Seasoned Sirloin    Service very accommodating friendly well  Manager Jina brought food fairly fast gave best recommendations which nice  liked she explained which sides best eat them  feel lot KBBQ places gone kinda just give meat leave   Place also very clean   I just wish steamed egg available everyone but I'd definitely back again! <EOR> Honey Pig best Korean BBQ restaurant ever to  all eat menu phenomenal! <EOR> Finally Korean BBQ restaurant henderson!
