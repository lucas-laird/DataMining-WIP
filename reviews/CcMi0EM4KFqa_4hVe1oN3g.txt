This pizza place intrigued ever since noticed late night hitting 24 Hour Fitness sits same parking lot   The bottom line   it's good but also bad   Pizza Patron franchise strikes being poor knock off Little Caeser's Pizza  operate same business model   offering pizza breadsticks chicken extremely low prices   although would say Little Caeser's offers more way flavor   If asked describe Pepperoni Pizza $4 95 tasted would difficult because almost no taste! didn't even taste bad just didn't taste anything! same breadsticks   they bland neither good nor bad just edible    If place realm pizza chains   I would say step above Cici's Pizza but also few steps below Little Caeser's   definitely worth checking pizza bread   perhaps chicken better   On another note accept Pesos form payment   so if any left over trip Mexico don't feel going bank them exchanged use them here!    5 22 2013   I returned Pizza Patron tried Pollito Chicken well Queso Sticks hooked ever since!   Though pizza very tasty ALL chicken offerings fantastic! Particularly Lime Pepper chicken wings aforementioned Pollito Chicken    The Queso Sticks tasty well! Essentially normal breadsticks cheese them tastes bit garlic  does wonders taste them pretty darn delicious!  Definitely fan! <EOR> Do come here  worth time money service extremely terrible  <EOR> I recently walked into place hour before closing told no pizza  Yes heard NO PIZZA  rather flippant teenager behind counter stated busy day no more pizzas night    This all happened realized am Spanish speaker having greeted Spanish seemed puzzled didn't speak it  all Mexicans speak Spanish! U S A !!   How does pizza place no pizza remain open?   They only other star because when pizza half way decent cheap  <EOR>
