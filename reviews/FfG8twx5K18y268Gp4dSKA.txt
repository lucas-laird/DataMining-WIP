He then rudely asked drivers license because he needed sure he didn't barrow military ID buddy   picture military ID clearly verifies him  found very disrespectful  Although he doing job he could asked different manner  never instance where he asked both IDs verify he fact military   waitress took wing order nice but seemed very confused she doing  wings came within ten minutes tasted okay however did enjoy cajun wings  said before expecting much more location  just stick BWW Wing stop  <EOR> So loyal Hooters customer !! 100's across country over last 23 yrs sad say hooters takes crown worse hooters United States !

After ordered several more rounds all brought 12 oz plastic cups while watched bring 16 oz glasses several tables around us  honestly no idea why occurred but made pretty annoyed    The food okay very fried greasy but exactly would expect Hooters   When bill came charged full pint every 12 oz drink I know because clearly said PINT STELLA whatnot each line receipt   brought waitress acknowledged weren't pints shrugged said she couldn't anything pay full price each drink  only times life left tip under 15% but couldn't reward woman's dismissive rude behavior  <EOR> Unfortunately can't rate any food drinks because good 10 minutes without hello anyone while sat bar near empty Sunday football day  Looking around saw 3 bartenders behind bar 1 phone other 2 chatting others around bar  totally cool them talking guests create experience attempt good tip but steps service require awareness when new guests sit down your bar  As walked mention server leaving because never greeted  She genuinely cared tried save situation asked take care us  She apologized said host new but know less host problem all bars zero attention caused leave  Unfortunately deed done going head competitor instead where currently packed type   <EOR> I love hooters  Aside nice young servers food really affordable  place spacious wings good size  also recommend boneless delicious perfect amount breaking   I heard sauces house DAILY your sauce preference slightly vary each time go   I always same thing breaded wings hot curly fries cheese sauce fried pickles   Definitely favorite wing place  Tuesday wing special everyone should check out  <EOR> I stopped into Hooters usual Friday lunch today plans just split some appetizers beer since none very hungry  hostess quick greet allowed pick where wanted sit grabbed table near bar    Once looked over menus realized splitting appetizers wasn't going work ordered thing fried pickles share picked some drinks  Two people group ordered beers myself other person strawberry lemonade  Little did know comes without vodka both drinks same name    when large plastic cups strawberry lemonade without vodka came confused  Thankfully waitress quick offer new drinks she let sip virgin versions while waited    I decided order 10 piece boneless wings medium heat which mistake looking back medium means none apparently   didn't carrots celery even fries additional charge didn't bother anything other then wings    I don't need attractive waitress wearing short shorts bring food order enjoy it  just need food good  decent    Nothing write home about  think would enjoyed meal lot more if gotten hot wings instead      That said know some people Hooters eyecandy  waitress attractive friendly     she just little slow  sure if fault result slow bartender kitchen staff    I'll probably end back Hooters sooner later but am big rush so  <EOR> The worst service Vegas last two time good luck getting drink some service  said would never back won't now!!!!!
