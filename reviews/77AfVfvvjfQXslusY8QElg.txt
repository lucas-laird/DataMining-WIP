Danced night away would definitely recommend  <EOR> My Vegas guy co worker chatting place work weeks finally random Friday group work friends went   I around 9 00pm ahead others   place pleasantly quiet except few patrons enjoyed chill atmosphere decor room while sipping beer bartender   co workers arrived all starving food point   fact co worker former chef said knew hamburgers well here   staff swapped few stories co workers while chilled bar   ordered cheddar burger did ravenously hungry friend mine   After few minutes chef came metaphorical egg face looks freshly prepped beef patties night   disappointing mistake but meant lot chef could both friendly apologetic cheesy corporate fake way chain restaurants   He offered prep both special chicken sandwich own design some extras avocado  can't ever say avocado!  chicken bacon sandwich creation filled both up   The bartender exchanged few jokes group   He introduced new type rum enjoyed and am PICKY rum too! sample few new drinks experimenting with   Overall?  loved service here   felt genuine fun relaxed  Meals start around 10 dollars didn't stay complete transition night club though left line girls forming join three four already entered  give service five stars  Four stars overall  <EOR> Soooo Wednesday night  We're standing outside aaaaaaaaaaand closed  Your yelp page said open  Thanks wasting time! <EOR> Disappointing!  before ok second time around tho DJ AWFUL no continuity music he playing salsa song reggaeton 3 bachata etc  He people his friends guess around making suggestions   look he random guy playing songs he likes thinks people want  <EOR> This place sux don't  recommend go   expensive far Vegas  strip  Dj sux!   Stay strip find something better  <EOR> To start review yes speak Spanish although am used Banda Norteño also enjoy going salsa bachata club such dj mix pretty good  It interesting mix things but rip off atmosphere terrible experience  First called ahead reservations see options were  told just come any issues   We arrived place via taxi then bouncer announced over radio arrived via taxi red flag already  From everyone ran into seemed want paid  Everyone comment story tipped over tipped which felt really abusive  We tried look place sit but most tables stated reserved      well pissed off since told didn't need reservation and arrived upon opening   So order table asked bottle service waitress looked excited told started $185 which entirely true saw $235 more price she should giving people  read disclaimer bottom menu stated included everything well gratuities thought actually pretty good deal then  She brought bottle two juices bill $295? She then also proceeded tell tip included but mandatory really pushed tip her  found bit confusing misleading  distrust handed $50 cash then never saw again?! bus boys came rarely refill juice but definitely didn't feel bottle service  terrible! But hey guess $350 table sit at   Because such poor experience decided interview front area cashier well bathroom attendant more information gratuities      which costed $20 talk them course  told right straight confidence bottle service already came all inclusive  then told them situation story changed immediately backing coworker instead  very fishy night but least knew band together   Of course end night asked taxi  saw everyone waiting everyone ever front area since trying good host friend  When taxi came while everyone knew waiting outside patiently saw new person just stole ride totally line taxi waited 20 min cold  Granted obvious anger another 15 minutes asked shuttle driver take back hotel  knew much costed club via taxi during traffic hours knew pay more that  When he grabbed front club he seemed polite courteous  When he left club van he started asking optional $40  really don't understand place? guys starving? used drunk people think take advantage of? Lucky drunk recall all well told knew much costed here  then he looked guilty said give felt giving him  terrible place terrible workers   It important write review people enjoy music Latin theme keep your wallet check watch your bill closely  guys thieves  <EOR> Just nj  wanted club prefer Spanish music  club 10 15 min away strip   only locals night  played only Spanish music  really looking place played mix Spanish English music   atmosphere relaxed clean   lot security felt Men $10 00 cover girls free  Good place take date spouse etc    We great time  would again  only reason gave them four stars because off strip  couldn't walk there  <EOR> if looking banda  place it alooottt bachata n cumbia salsa  but service good all good stuff  <EOR> The manager lady didn't let because apparently wasn't ID  Today birthday embarrassing since visiting California  26 years old just back strip  Waste time only wanted listen Spanish music  Trashy ass place! <EOR> Shittiest Club ever f*** rest reviews place garbage no people music keeps turning off fuck place never coming back <EOR> I looking Latin club all weekend  I finally found La Jolla club which someone referee being good Latin club La Jolla club such great time    they best bachata salsa cumbia everything want dance nd great time  Plus very  friendly staff  great drinks open late    the best Latin club Las Vegas definitely back!!! <EOR> I didn't it  told DJ plays Mexican music 3 hrs didn't play no Mexican music  don't recommend club  really disappointed  <EOR> Good place if you're looking big grenade dance with  Lol  If you're into cougars then place you   minus dj plays same shit over over  major plus you'll definitely laid leaving club fat chick   hey     know say 'more cushion pushin' lmao <EOR> We first gone XS nightclub since 4 star review  waited line 2 hours once inside super crowded couldn't even walk breath passing people  left within first 10 minutes there  then looked online found La Jolla  gave try outside doesn't look appealing once walk inside see somewhat small space compare XS nightclub  bar right side dance floor middle   Once first walked ordered drinks shot beer soda $28 somewhat pricy  Then found seats right next dance floor waited couple minutes see music actually liked it  Couple minutes later started dancing DJ played good music lot merengue reguetton bachata  He also played punta which totally new since no club ever ever played punta really enjoyed it  He also played English music slow jams Mexican music Banda corridos but much  If you're into straight Mexican music Banda corridos hear DJ play music much    Overall really enjoyed night didn't leave club until 5AM love clubbing never dance much club before but music good danced all night blast <EOR> Cool place but lot old people if young adult your gonna feel lil weird!!!
