I'd heard good things Hard Rock's atmosphere while mostly disappointed Culinary Dropout fine time  made reservations 9 people Saturday night which completely unnecessary  restaurant half full though part reason huge great casual patio   We immediately free serving Soft Pretzels Provolone Fondue  delicious  a result duplicate order  Great start  mostly drawn impressively diverse if pricey beer menu  Woe me instead embracing diversity ended sticking very delicious Joseph James lager all night  There's some good stuff if you've lost all your money gambling tables there's also paper bag special $3  waitress described Bud Select something ilk stayed away but found cheekily fun   Menu prices quite reasonable getting eye gouged Vegas exchange rate  Meatloaf  my choice exceptionally large quite filling  Ends more little burnt but enjoyed meaty part enjoyed sides  Shaved Prime Rib Dip huge raves waitress excellent all night well fellow diners ordered it  Fish Chips 36 Hour Pork Ribs called decidedly average   It's really great ambiance if Hard Rock more zoo atmosphere promised think night would've even better  short cab ride strip still great time regardless  <EOR> The food amazing! While most people wouldn't complain     portions just big!! waitress suggested soft pretzels cheese sauce  Delicious!

All amazing!  Needless say pretty full time meal came but ordered Fried Chicken delicious!   The run down service great food good atmosphere bit loud whatever reason Moscow Mule doesn't come Copper Mug    I'd definitely back  <EOR> I food comps every week Hard Rock eaten few times but no more   First off things way overpriced   $4 small bowl fried chicken skin $12 pretzel dip over $30 small portion steak fries   didn't care much because always covered comp but when compare value quality elsewhere just doesn't sense   As actual quality food some OK   grizzini breadsticks pretty good recall ribs being decent   Every steak awful though   gotten both korean rib cap steak dolce gorgonzola   Both pre cut usually fatty gristly very small portions   Maybe 6 8 ounces something that   Service always bit slow even though never busy when usually around noon weekday    If sit bar least your drink service bit better but food still takes while come out   On most recent visit girlfriend seated quickly near only other two occupied tables restaurant   Several servers waiters came but never stopped even ask drink orders   server walked past briskly without stopping greeted but all!  bad rep  order simply always tip   girl front even knows usually choose sit bar   least 5 minutes left giving menus girl front told happened   She off yell waiters next door Mr  Lucky's   Let tell Mr  Lucky's amazing compared place   Most casino's 24 hour cafe style restaurants pretty normal but really great food here   prices look tad steep but quality portions great   best casino cafe burgers definitely best casino cafe chicken fingers short stack pancakes great steak eggs best ever yes even better vaunted Ellis Island's    So long story short screw Culinary Dropout   Your food ranges average plain awful your service pits  <EOR> Pretzel bites cheese fondue sauce!!

Any place raw seafood bar win book  Pretty much everyone front house attractive place hums laid back vibe while maintaining posh yet edgy atmosphere  why two star rating?  Everything sounded better menu actually was everything just fell short expectations  service just terrible  worst service all year maybe ever  waited 20 minutes just see server drinks waited even longer water coffee ordered never refill   Even though requested twice  courses weren't paced all soup getting cold while sandwich soggy oysters warm  Service total bust!  Unfortunately food didn't bad service   The cheese fondue which ordered recommendation waiter really glorified Velveeta  soft pretzels good but really they're just mode transportation hot melty cheese which arrived table skin already formed over top  Really appetizing sarcasm   Overall really bland no bite  The white shrimp served shell but cleaned fantastic! Perfectly cooked  Best part meal far! I'd definitely way back cocktail shrimp cocktail if inconvenient  The Kushi oysters which normally favorite sort funk even though apparent shucked order  The French Onion Soup quite possibly worst ever and once unwisely made mistake ordering French Onion Applebees   Bland light colored broth much thyme round tough rye bread topped just little cheese top cooked death  no melty stringy cheesy goodness wrap around spoon maintain little dignity   Just stale crouton witha  crust hard cheese floating bland broth  The warm Italian Grinder also recommendation server nothing special arrived crisp top   But soggy all heck bottom  soggy bottomed sandwich comes hand cut fries side which best part meal   Even though service bad food mediocre really did fall hard menu give another go  feel maybe just maybe ordered wrong items wrong server just wrong day  couldn't even food boxed when did 25 minutes later came back fondue side hand all greasy  worst part all when waiter finally did come back lengthy disappearance immediately starting clearing away plates taking away whole shrimp oyster   $6 worth deliciousness man! Always ask before clearing!  Their specialty cocktail menu sleuth amazingly well thought out libations alone enough bring back  prices very reasonable strip if nothing else drink raw bar antipasto  can't screw Italian cured meats top line slicer hand  <EOR> Such great atmosphere people  servers pesky let enjoy yourself  food exceptional! expecting hotel restaurant  reasonably priced!
