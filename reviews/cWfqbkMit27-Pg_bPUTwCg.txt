Not bad place burger drink but great either   To summarize pros cons experience Cons 1  Sticky tables 2  Dirty looking silver ware 3  Cool beer cold beer   Pros 1  Good Food 2  Nice attentive staff 3  Sports TV 4  Free Wifi  I Roadrunner off Buffalo Washington around 4 10 Saturday 4 6 13  walked sat myself sign instructed promptly greeted Manager duty  He brought water he took order  asked 1 3 lb Angus Burger draft Sam Adams Boston lager  prefer draft instead bottled because draft colder usually   Looking around its would expect local's oriented sport bar  Dim sticky sports TV  table sat pretty sticky silver ware though clean lot water spots looked little gross  Wichita vs Louisiana no volume though which ok because think Charles Barkley's voice annoying  Also didn't captions no idea anyone saying but don't really care much it   About another 3 minutes later brought bottle Sam Adams Boston lager instead draft very kind waitress  Even though ordered draft didn't stink  because hey beer! Taking another look around place clean if antique ish looking cowboy stuff garb place your mecca  cowboy hats western style art nick nacks walls even rusty looking horse shoe light fixtures  Also sign said free WiFi which all ways cool   Now important stuff food beer  beer cold but cold enough I'd honestly say cool  know beer cold when there's condensation bottle good example when bring glass ice water moisture outside glass means its cold inside  say least cool tasted warmer then water therefore crap  Any savvy beer drinker knows especially those prefer Sam Adams good beer temperature between 39 45 degrees mine tasted more low mid 50's  Yuck but still drank because man man never wastes beer  ordered another hoping better but disappointed again   The burger good very slightly pink even though asked well done served perfectly toasted bun much lettuce two slices tomato  half lettuce off burger tasted excellent fries also good just enough seasoning unlike other places pile salt   The price burger two beers $18 32 tax   $4 50 beer $7 95 burger  great but bad Vegas I'd say average around here  If Mon Fri between 11am 3pm burger $5 95  <EOR> Nothing special  quite few TVs great watch games  Happy hour 3p 6p  Other food drinks pricey  Food okay  pool table which also nice  Waitress shorted change check she didn't tip  <EOR> Hostility various cast members towards 11 member group  Does allow Vaping yet smoking section few feet non smoking section smell smoke farthest point non smoking section  watched whole time if criminals  Very very unpleasant experience  Last time come here! <EOR> Amazing food  Chill atmosphere   Lance far coolest bartender ive met very long time  Would recommend sure <EOR> Had great time Roadrunner Denver Broncos game!  place cute inviting  service great!!

Cheers! <EOR> We going Roadrunner while now decided wanted give review  breakfast best oatmeal anywhere starter  Then shared omelet which cooked perfectly  watch football TV ' bar huge being game  restaurant very cozy continue there  <EOR> We treated very poorly server  Lisa  when  Road Runner around 7 00 pm Thursday Oct  10th  She took order said special steak $10 99 fiance ordered 2 specials ordered salmon  She then asked if group on said yes then she started treating very badly terrible attitude! She never refilled waters asked 2 sides vegetables instead rice fiance asked mushrooms instead potatoes  food came 15 mins before fiance's food covered rice when politely told all vegetables she gave attitude took plate back cook  Then fiances plate came potatoes which he specifically said he didn't want potatoes but he didn't complain finally food comes back 15 mins fiances food then she just threw bill table very rudely! When bill $10 99 specials she charged $13 99 added extra fee vegetables supposed included meal! Honestly never treated horribly restaurant entire life! still tipped even unprofessional she acted towards us  Oh then 4 days later looking over bank statements Lisa charged credit card twice! which pursue legally unauthorized credit card charges   Horrible experience!! <EOR> Really bad golf Hot smokey six dollar beers even if gaming place nothing offer <EOR> I am glad ended because pleasantly surprised  10 day stint family east coast practically Indian food everyday   I ready easy all american food   wanted simple steak salad ranch dressing but didn't want spend alot normally would steakhouse   top all off husband wanted watch watch football Monday night   Further wanted try new place neighborhood ended Roadrunner   We walked first off put smokiness but many people given large place doorway decided fine   I tired hungry anyway   Once started look around pleasantly surprised clean establishment cozy outdoor space includes fire pit some TVs   While country southwestern? decor preference still cleanly done didn't seem mind much   Anyway greeted very polite yet casual hostess she let sit where ever liked since only two dining tables occupied time   bit hesitant empty doubting food any good if even edible    Going through menu surprised expanse food menu given saloon    menu items definitely inspired its Southwestern roots although nice twists regular All American bar food   menu something everyone    burritos fish pasta steaks pizzas salads soups burgers sandwiches  Prices hitting all sorts struck gold steak salad!   So ordered steak salad husband ordered burger bacon cheese   also ordered couple drinks   He ordered Guinness but impressed limited wine selection   asked Sauv Blanc   they don't serve it   asked Pinot Grigio usually but all merlot   fine probably should bothered since just labeled house wine which tend pretty crappy just increase profit margins     My salad well done actually taking Mediterranean flair Kalamata olives feta red onions grape tomatoes topped  crispy fried onions bed romaine pan seared strip? steak   steak plentiful perfectly done given asked medium rare  impressive mention tasty since most steak salads offered restaurants seem just use any odds ends steak salad   Whether crinkle cut fries looked bought just cooked   However husband did eat them all without complaint   The diverse menu obviously expresses talent passion chef staff kitchen shame wine offering does compliment that   think Roadrunner underrating its own potential   Saloon names bit offputting but focusing southwestern flair broader appeal  Roadrunner could expanded its target market even showing off its menu   could appeal more nearby Summerlin neighborhood which searching nice casual dining establishments  little more marketing Roadrunner could justice deserves but now little secret  <EOR> This second time visited Road Runner first 5 years ago   husband decided give another chance very late hungry   menu pretty small only bartender late night serve us   And still looked past all order give them second chance   usually don't take much acount into small menus slow service when late night   eggs bacon decent husband's sandwich ok then    later night    kaboom food poisoning   Can't usually blame place but only place eaten together days last meal frozen meal microwave I'd say there's pretty good chance culprit right road runner   if needed excuse back   bad location great  <EOR> The only reason giving 1 star service  bartender attentive server Antonio friendly  9pm Friday night sat lounge ready chow down starving ready good meal couple beers  beer great but food nearly inedible  nachos burned black carne asada beef jerky cheese burned pick off  ordered adult grilled cheese Swiss cheddar grilled onions bacon  single slice cheddar melted between two pieces toast nothing else  sent back remade correctly cook opened same sandwich shoved 2 pieces old cold bacon raw red onions then sent back  server graciously removed bill comped couple beers  unacceptable place used great great food  highly recommend if want good meal made care don't there  paid bill street Steiners bomb home cooked meal great price  <EOR> I don't know if just having bad day something else but place worst service  walk seat myself should  eye contact least two employees no acknowledgement ask if need menu  should just Carl's Jr  across street  <EOR> Nice neighborhood bar  Relaxed atmosphere country kick  Pitcher beer good food reasonable prices  also serve pretty decent breakfast well  Best all    they're Denver Bronco's bar during football season  <EOR> This place fun   if fun  Mediocre waitstaff mediocre food    I some good memories but probably wouldn't recommend anyone    Again bad but tons better options! <EOR> Breakfast experience  4 5 So those don't know probably best breakfast specials town   $1 99 two eggs however want two slices toast or English muffin two slices bacon or sausage home fries   And ALL delicious   ordered couple different combinations some custom requests eggs fried over hard bacon extra crispy home fries extra crispy always comes correct   So why 4 5?  Sometimes service godawful slow mornings    don't mean chef   When you're trying prove challenge   Lunch experience  5 5 5 $5 95 deal offers 1 3 lb burger+fries chicken Caesar salad mini pizza two other things can't remember   burger honestly other reviews didn't really expect much   It's really really tasty   Beats going any fast food joint good price point   Also great service during lunch   guess people working bar 8am simply don't want there    figure  P  I've also tried spinach artichoke dip  absolutely fabulous am picky spinach artichoke dip   friend raves macaroni cheese but yet try out  <EOR> I lived down street Roadrunner 6 years but never ventured until couple days ago having bought Groupon  didn't end using during happy hour dinner Cowboy Poppers Jalapenos stuffed cheese pulled pork Sliders Chicken Wings Bud Light Sprite well under $30 Groupon  food pretty decent  liked filling poppers but breading could use some work  sliders cooked past medium requested but still pretty good  chicken wings chicken wings   Next time think try Southwest fried pickles pulled pork sandwich  think bring parents tab exceeds Groupon  <EOR> So below average    Drinks weak menu uninspired portions small   There nothing special location food disappointing   Texas Dip which your basic french dip    Small roll became soggy quickly even before dip roll issue   beef fine but fries crisp even hot   The service fine good waitress attentive but she could experience better   really bothered while three 8 drinks none them any real kick 3 long island ice teas 5 Alabama Slammers both should stronger   Go just down block Steiners better experience  <EOR> A generous 2 Stars that!

Long Island mix drink forgot name tasty well   The service good waitress checked several times   good service because experience much more enjoyable     The only reason didn't give place 5 stars think prices bit high getting  crazy over priced just few dollars high most food items drinks $2 3 higher other bar places    We back  <EOR> I discovered place because GroupOn reading some Yelp reviews pleasantly surprised  Service excellent food creative tasty reasonably priced  western ambiance fun too  also would give 2 $$ rating versus 3 $$$  Most entrees between $10 15  <EOR> Mediocre food seem remember having *much* better food Centennial location now closed   Jalapeno poppers really tasty  Ordered barbecue platter share chicken overcooked sadly but good flavor  Brisket grey color tough  Pulled pork pretty good  Waitress attentive food pretty quick but again food left much desired  back  <EOR> Just left place paid $14 01 fish chips meal  3 small burnt pieces fish old bucket slaw  really wish could upload picture  say least worth half price  <EOR> Was very bizzy evening Broncos Thursday night football some opportunities but overall great experience   kitchen team amazing pumped much food minimal wait time   Wings sort dry maybe freezer burned   only main downside having listen servers complain side work going since 2 servers cooks eating line realize service station open but believe silverware should polished sight no noise tossing into bins   Great teamwork plenty TV's    management very engaged giving high 5's patrons would back but maybe order wings  <EOR> My favorite neighborhood bar back open!! missed good food friendly bartenders!! <EOR> I give place really bad rap really bad   See when interact lot random people bar just doesn't that   Every time most 10 people hanging having drinks   gave another shot Saturday night midnight still only 10 12 people there   But some food pretty decent bartender pretty friendly helpful drink selection   If don't mind empty bar prefer you'll really bar   There's plenty comfortable couches chairs all food seems pretty decent   Oh serve full menu until 1am least weekends   Good late night find! <EOR> i'm updating review 3 yrs ago place  use any meal day    loved food service    ended having fire closed down    closed almost 9 months re opened december however kitchen still closed  No clue still call themselves Roadrunner Bar Grill via facebook page serve food   am pretty disappointed  <EOR> The fish chips salmon amazing service good well Totally come back <EOR> I only come eat!  usually fish chips Dr  Pepper steak   waitresses always nice friendly   food always good   place filled busy weekends only knows its secrets!  two tv's mounted but always catch whatever sport bar   best but bad either   If you're ever area walk left then look lost they'll happy help out! <EOR> This place amazing  bar very well decorated crowd very personable cheers feel  Corie hands down favorite bartender  single drink she can't she's human roladex knows everyone name!

Keep good work!!! <EOR> I'm regular bar least was  Jenny bartender lost loyal customer  She charged drinks while betting tonight when questioned said well you're leaving more came you're fine  Steiner's Sierra Gold road  <EOR> I love love love Roadrunner Saloon!  Here's why 1  love bar food cowboy food Tex Mex food   Roadrunner Saloon carries all three types food all taste great! tried lot items belly always happy afterwards   Tasty food happy   2  Dr  Pepper Tacos!  Yes heard right!  love Dr  Pepper just smidgeon less hubby kid paper thin difference   when heard tacos investigate   super duper fantastic!  soda meat tender flavorful    fun eat taste great  know #1 but anything regarding Dr  Pepper gets special spot book   3  Great service   Every time location gotten great service   servers always friendly helpful   love good service because your meal much more enjoyable     4  family friendly   Many favorite bar food joints switched 21 over only which means rarely go   Sad   Roadrunner does allow kids families all good meal   daughter loves place because she all cowboy stuff already   5  drinks stiff!  If interested bar service drinks tasty   rarely alcoholic drinks days but if want Roadrunner serves stiff!  The only reason didn't give place 5 stars think prices bit high get   isn't crazy over priced just $1 high most food items $2 3 high drinks   Maybe am just cheap old age but see it   still love place continue just wish bit cheaper  <EOR> This place Denver Bronco fans!  definitely next best thing sitting stadium  waitstaff best enthusiasm second none BUT    value opposed quality quantity food along minuscule selection worst!  owner definitely takes advantage die hard fans serving tiny portions big $$ <EOR> It looked cool place grab bite but looks grunge exterior didn't compensate lack quality meal   For meal average $8 $11  per plate would expect  fresh but instead tastes frozen packaged then baked    For example french fries kind buy big buy oven home    least  looked tasted   Second Pulled Pork's BBQ tasted off     the bun cold coleslaw bun didn't taste any better  The bun should slightly toasted butter mayo but instead cold plain  You Vons buy pack pulled pork feeds 4 people  tastes better then theirs     Unfortunately looking forward eating but greatly disappointed quality food price asking per plate    If catch lunch special ends 3 then suppose would comparable quality but other then would never eat again    The entertainment TVs nice but rather somewhere better food price  <EOR> So Denver Broncos bar loyal Denver Broncos fan 40 years now    loyal game time fans being charged $20 door seat   Now if $20 credit food drinks would different   There's many places town watch game better giveaways!  last week great time food good people great   But $20 in???  even money principle it  <EOR> Bartender rude ordered food cook came drop off asking guy next if he said no cook said don't f***ing know slams down  paid food giving bartender well over amount check he assumed all change ask change  Food good service sucked  <EOR> Not bad locals spot stop video poker bar food  If you're into video poker very large bar area many machines  menu pretty standard bar food such burgers soup fried items  did try grilled cheese tomato bisque soup  good average par bar food  <EOR> Just moved into neighborhood  Love new bar  came some friends loved low key vibe  quesadillas killer TV's gigantic  football heaven  <EOR> The perfectly golden shrimp nestled shrimp tacos beautiful  Seriously visually stunning good  potato soup chili provided nice perch watching some football  couldn't decide if tastiness magic sodium but regardless chowed down   The menu bar food burgers sandwiches pizzas some BBQ grilled items salads  Standard fare took while decide sounded good    Even though majority spot reserved smokers smoke free side room  spot clean nice decor just other Roadrunners town  Service nice but bit spotty times   For price think service should more consistent  example husband originally ordered half chicken waiter came back said chicken frozen would take little longer prepare  asked long he ask chef returned said hour!  Saturday night strikes point concern main entree items ready go  ended skipping chicken   Given value selection service level could only see returning nurse bowl soup chili sip beverage watch some football  wouldn't dinner destination but ok bar spot snacking watching game  <EOR> Typical bar food type place good large gatherings  accommodating fairly large place never busy when work together   Roadrunner Saloon nothing special but bad either  <EOR> We watch Broncos game  definitely active Broncos fan bar  game specials pretty good  really busy sit back area  staff friendly food good bar food  <EOR> The pecan pie die waitress amazing  Those two things reason come here!!

Love it!!  place serves Kokanne specifically Kokanee   This favorite place grab beer but okay pinch  <EOR> When favorite neighborhood bar grill places  Great food atmosphere  Reasonable prices Discount specials available Groupon LivingSocial <EOR> Ive going establishment oops let rephrase   DUMP   for awhile now   Always pretty good service chicken fingers very much  Let explain why am rating 1star After work met friend some late night fingers fries soon sat down some crazy drunk dude falling all over himself escorted found parking lot he took WHIZ right front entrance GROSS   next waitress Kristen brought fingers she immediately said pay bill cause Manager said so!
