From moment walked knew going it   Very nice atmosphere good relaxing dinner   waiter Daniel just awesome   He very helpful paced diner well never rushed us   Daniel told he working Loft only 5 weeks but experience spoke otherwise   would recommend Daniel heartbeat!    We started sharing appetizer shrimp cocktail   plate six very nice sized shrimp interesting sauce   homemade cocktail sauce some hot mustard drizzled top plate   absolutely loved it then again haven't really met shrimp didn't like!  main course husband ordered sea bass since basically carnivore ! prime rib   small cut   husband absolutely loved sea bass size fish very generous portion   prime rib extremely flavorful tender I always order mine medium rare really didn't need knife   side ordered garlic mashed potatoes generous amount garlic them   didn't overpower potatoes all   Then again garlic lover really isn't any such thing much garlic!    Who presume manager came over table   Unfortunately don't remember name but she extremely friendly   told chose Loft because celebrating wedding anniversary   few minutes later Daniel came over complimentary dessert just world!  husband rarely eats chocolate even more rarely dessert ate quite bit which says something   almost death chocolate cake cake itself chocolate inside top covered layers chocolate back side slice shaved chocolate   If wasn't enough drizzled fresh raspberry sauce several fresh raspberries blackberries my personal favorite plate   far hands down best chocolate cake ever eaten     Also dinner husband ordered bottle wine us   Ordering wine little bit challenge he likes sweeter whites lean toward dry reds   compromised ordered bottle Mc Murray Ranch Pinot Noir just wonderful   well both dinners     All all definitely recommend Prime Rib Loft if you're looking quite relaxing top notch dinner   can't say enough Daniel he did outstanding job   When back hopefully he'll because definitely want waiter   Prime Rib Loft very reasonably priced food fresh very flavorful   place really very underrated people truly don't know they're missing     My rating really 4 5   thing bothered while may just personal preference mine wonder if other people bothered well   dress code Loft basically business casual   While saw two different parties party being mostly male walked T shirts baseball caps some turned backwards   Really?

If order prime rib sure horseradish  hot anyone cry! <EOR> Last night second time dining loft  seated balcony area overlooking players table below  Knocking off star only because medium rare prime rib little tough around edges but center delicious  Creamed corn yummy  Shrimp cocktail tasty well  Overall service good food great prices amazing  back    <EOR> I recently visited restaurant first time both pleasantly surprised food quality utterly dismayed over attitude server   restaurant truly loft located upstairs inside Orleans Hotel accessible stairway elevator   running late reservation able accommodate happily adjusting somewhat reservation 15 minutes   however almost where great service stopped   Overall main dining area approximates elegance but many families dining children prices aren't exorbitant   prime rib available several cuts escalating size price   Steaks also available all cooked order   night visited special smallish steak two lobster tails very reasonable price   addition complimentary bread mix also several appetizers available ordered stuffed mushroom caps good but great   The only real negative server   asking fantastic busboy cocktail order directed ask server   restaurant full bar but only wine beer list available table no mention specialty cocktails   When waiter arrived he unshaven dour   When asked if could Bahama Mama a fairly common rum cocktail waiter stared blankly said he'd never heard it   He did inquire able drinks but waiter never once smiled engaged any way other most perfunctory requests required orders   Basically attitude wet blanket otherwise would really fine meal   While eagerly recommend restaurant would also request other seating if guy ever server again  <EOR> Not impressed all   heard restaurant even though located off strip Orleans decided give try knowing wanted prime rib specialty    Unfortunately service ok prime rib underwhelming all tasty     older restaurant but also wasn't expecting anything fancy but guess just expected great prime rib but instead nothing special  <EOR> We searching new steakhouse try friend told Prime Rib Loft  atmosphere very nice murals fit general feel Orleans  Prime rib isn't first choice New York strip  Maybe where wrong  If looking patronizing restaurant would lower your expectations  Think less steakhouse more Applebees  The salad typical house salad watery lettuce few olives  No big deal expected steakhouse  The steak itself very dry  server asked if needed A1  should red flag  good steak should never require any additional seasoning  steak cooked medium appropriate amount coloring  Taste itself pretty bland disappointing  needed some pepper basic seasoning  seemed steak finished cooking before other people's left under heat lamp long  Unacceptable especially price  really love mashed potato cart rare find restaurants still this  Overall would say atmosphere good but quality disappointing  service decent but if busy would worry
