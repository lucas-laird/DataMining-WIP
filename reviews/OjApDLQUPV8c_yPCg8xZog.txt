Strawberry Shortcake Sandwiches sounds pretty straight forward but comes strawberry cream gelato  Again gelato! Kansas City Style Burnt Ends Another staple  But shake sugar raw over top  burnt ends good but sugar made experience unpleasant  Really? put sugar meat shouldn't but can't put your sweet tea?

greens very good   Glad chose those   server Pauly enthusiastic menu food couldn't help but love him   Looking forward going back next week  <EOR> Unfortunately everything husband ordered unsatisfactory  burnt ends extremely dry crab cakes chili terribly bland  brighter note sweet tea delicious  <EOR> I checked place earlier week pleasantly surprised  waiter friendly food excellent  dry rub ribs far best ribs ever had   hard because come south  twice far plan coming again again  <EOR> Meh   impressed   Overpriced fancy bbq   Food decent but ribs forgettable   Portions small  <EOR> We he Memphis dry ribs tender first time rib where meat didn't stuck teeth  bacon steak super good but over priced 2 strips  Burnt Ends if waitress wasn't missing all night would sent them back very chewy worth ordering   took FOREVER food Gorden Ramsey then food came wasn't even busy he restaurant          wouldn't back because feel over priced side dishes good needed salt but again waitress missing    Mac n cheese toasted yams yams would really good if cooked consistent some soft others hard   heart still belongs Rolling Smoke BBQ      spent $72 jaws dropped   friends spend $92  <EOR> Okay let's front American BBQ back several incarnations  Probably most ubiquitous lately mash Asian mostly Korean spices ingredients some traditional urban cooking methods braising pressure cooking etc  decent dose traditional smoking thrown but smoked meats and cheeses popping unexpected venues several years now  many smoke purists stodgy favorite traditions style see much beyond which personally prefer BBQ strikes close hearts many culinarians causing even most professionally objective openly cast aspersions other legitimate styles traditions   That being said let's talk Pot Liquor  decent enough accessible location nicely appointed if bit echoey probably could partitioned space bit more including PDR some custom features nice big bar big plus elbow bender pretty nice beer whiskey selection  Service friendly attentive thorough explaining menu  that bit traditionalist's BBQ temple featuring very high quality sauces KC East Carolina vinegar based some old timey roadhouse favorites comfort food French country bistro the not to be missed boudin noir thrown good measure   As starter chose burnt ends although serviceable didn't exactly impress  Sure smoky bit caramelized crust them but lacked serious bark all pit masters should know produce  bit cold side well  guessing they're using cook and hold method isn't really gittin' 'er done  'cue sauce #2 think though great  Don't wrong smoky brisket itself good but indulgence good burnt ends all tender smokiness fronted seriously crusty bark  serve Pullman Loaf which just white bread traditional mop tomato based BBQ sauce some simply killer pickles   From nice selection items Carolina pulled pork St  Louis ribs baby backs some Boudin Noir brisket  First not great both styles ribs lacked light crust all good ribs should guarding near fall off the bone tenderness which come think also lacked only just bit  Many smoke heads argue ribs should little firm stick bone but found super tender near melting meaty types tend exhibit more depth flavor  aside again KC Texas sauces spot on exemplary these  Speaking Texas brisket  Brisket Texas meat all BBQ chefs judged let's just say if Austin they'd need argue do over  While pink smoke ring apparent meat nicely infused smoke took good doses various sauces and collard greens' pot liquor impart any moisture  Properly smoked brisket still ooze juice but again killer sauces gussied nicely   As good stuff Carolina pork amazing perfectly cooked shredded perfectly matched East Carolina vinegar based 'cue sauce  also delighted letting pot liquor collard greens drip into pile between bites  seriously addictive yummy super yummy stuff  Equal many ways but distinctly different Boudin Noir  came grilled prawns which expertly executed firm but still juicy nice caramelization great celery onion orange slaw  All flavors worked together brilliant culinary composition Boudin Noir exquisite  casing crackles interior flaky crumbly moist  Another example culinary crack  Louisiana hot links very well executed well firm poppy casings moist deliciousness therein   The sides really wowed kale cashew slaw collard greens  slaw actually more slaw kale but perfectly balanced only chopped bits cashew obvious night whole salad redolent faintly sweet nutty legume if dressing infused cashew  collard greens Carolina pulled pork Boudin Noir can't miss  Simmered namesake pot liquor literally drip flavor   Service whole pretty good although point before ordered both bartenders backs side L shaped bar talking couple which fine but all good bartenders' heads should fifteen twenty second swivel   All all given crack addictive nature several menu items most definitely return happily check see if they've made progress brisket rib items  <EOR> Visited place

Highly recommended   hope build Downtown Summerlin well  <EOR> We decided whim VERY GLAD did    They great beer menu 2 taps designated local breweries which awesome  whiskey drinker but whiskey menu seemed pretty extensive    We Sunday offer brunch menu which includes bottomless mimosas Bloody Mary Bellini's  hubby opted chicken fried steak off brunch menu which he LOVED  many places use frozen chicken fried steaks really difficult truly enjoyable CFS but case here  steak fresh biscuits gravy mashed potatoes  first time he enjoyed CFS REALLY long time    I mopped baby back ribs collard greens corn bread  ribs tasty tender but little much rosemary sauce truly love them  collard greens point cornbread FRESH honey butter    My son pulled pork waffle which Belgian waffle big pile pulled pork top it  meat very moist waffle nice crispy    We also crispy pork belly puréed sweet potatoes which DIE FOR!  salty sweet combo excellent  <EOR> I've handful times never really come close 5 star rating me   If you're Town Square shopping bad option but would travel specifically Town Square just eat Pot Liquor     First off pretty big never seen more 1 4 full would seem bode well service but service hit miss   last time server I can't seem remember name pretty cheery but very absent end meal   He said he'd bring drink refill fiancee took 15 minutes another few minutes check   also overcharged side dish but weren't going wait another 10+ minutes fixed   The food all slightly above average but priced bit high   feel everything should cost 25% less really is   I haven't written review yet but really Bell's BBQ Henderson   Good prices big amounts tastes lot better place   If you're northwest side town try Roadkill Grill  also very good reasonably priced well   I probably come back but just because shopping Town Square sometimes people might want some BBQ  <EOR> Like others said food really good  unfortunately others also pointed service REALLY poor    My husband now tried place 5th time since opened because actually really food but yet another frustrating experience sad say going back nor recommending restaurant others any longer    During most recent visit came late lunch  only 3 other tables guests restaurant which attributed mostly being off time day but couldn't help but thinking others may similar experiences ours past decided elsewhere proven packed Yard House passed walk Pot Liquor   Regardless really love food excited give spot another try which soon regretted   We arrived 15 minutes before lunch specials expired at 3pm but impossible any attention employees continually walked right past us  Finally husband walked back hostess stand ask if server assigned area  The place HUGE actually really nice which just lack customer appreciation even sadder   She pointed gal walked passed few times without much hello eye contact said she'd send right over  meantime husband decided order 2 drinks bar himself which made way over time server made 1st appearance  Here's where things FUN    We said knew wanted order right away however when asked Pulled Pork sandwich she informed lunch menu ended 3pm I'd order pulled pork sliders pulled pork dinner since now 3 06pm   pointed we'd waiting quite awhile since ingredients meal ordering same others hoping she could ask kitchen or manager whoever if could exception a 6 minute exception I'd prefer sandwich  She refused said wasn't possible I'd pick something else  husband STARVING point instead walking wanted quickly picked other items dinner menu decided try best it    Unfortunately things only worse sat waiting food empty glasses yummy alcoholic lemonades that easily could sold many more if server bothered come back offer another round since food runner dropped off meals or maybe another server didn't bother ask if needed anything maybe something wash food down husband walked bar yet again ask refill bottle water she left table point decided would spending more dollar place     We didn't see server again until flagged down bring check  walked discussing where should head next few cocktails since Pot Liquor definitely wasn't interested business noticed three other tables restaurant occupied looked restaurant management none whom walked over table other guest table say hello thank coming ask experience even notice 2 tables customers otherwise empty restaurant receiving zero attention  Instead busy chatting laughing working budgets menus some other plans obviously missing main business point needed working = customer satisfaction retention  <EOR> We ordered chicken ribs sweet potatoes corn bread macaroni cheese potato salad  food average lot flavor everything needed more seasoning  service pretty good but stick Rollin smoke! <EOR> Extraordinary customer service  Detail oriented attentive very friendly staff  Food delicious  Great deals happy hour  Owner approachable friendly  Well run establishment  <EOR> They say Authentic Southern Cooking  Let suggest if never eaten Southern Cooking here   you still haven't eaten Southern Cooking    Not food bad   just wasn't southern any stretch imagination  lived south lot years appreciate many varieties southern cooking  any them    The Mac cheese very dry creamy cheesy  chicken good but served barbecue sauce?  chili good but nothing special southern happening either  Pork Sliders very good   nice rolls good slaw but very little barbecue sauce  Nothing compare real North Carolina South Carolina Texas barbecue     All all bad but many great barbecue places choose LV probably won't back  Memphis Bbq John Mulls Lucille's Beef Ribs etc  <EOR> This place amazing!

Give yourself some time truly enjoy great addition Las Vegas food scene  located directly across Yardhouse if feeling need little more whisky beer night then yourself favor check Pot Liquor! <EOR> Let start review saying friends decided BBQ restaurant 4th July   probably where first wrong  all days wanted festive all  Boy oh boy    Pot Liquor tucked corners Town Square  Luckily lots nearby parking  arrived around 6 45 they take reservations over phone online without any issue seated nearly immediately  restaurant time busy all    Our waitress nowhere found quite some time looked little frazzled uninterested when finally met  It's holiday it  Fast forward ordering would nice notice ahead time food would take upwards 30+ minutes arrive 'big take orders' ahead ours  overheard server apologizing other table offering bring some snacks wait  peep end    The food somewhat redeemed experience long wait  shared three apps Brisket Burnt Ends Pulled Pork Nachos Meatballs  portions very small imo  nachos least substantial hit spot tasty    Not sure if would want ever return but admit yes national BBQ holiday you're probably swamped  <EOR> Brisket very dry  Nice smoke ribbon but chewy tasteless  Sides quite pricey  Some interesting items won't find other menus  Still prefer Lucille's Rollin Smoke  Pot Liquor large bar quite expansive whiskey selection listed two chalk boards  <EOR> BBQ amazingness! co worker tried lunch very impressed food customer service  server Matt attentive entertaining great recommendations  restaurant great atmosphere works any occasion such lunch friends co workers date night even seating large groups  pork belly die for  I'm huge bbq sauce person but meat such wonderful smoky flavor couldn't dare smother sauce! ordered variety items all them exceeded expectations  best part all reasonably priced  offer lunch  happy hour specials well extensive drink menu  want thank Exec chef Doug such wonderful dining experience! <EOR> So gift certificate place try it  Very contemporary compared other Bbq places which thought neat  Oh yeah town square    boyfriend opted Lord mercy $65 6 spare ribs 5 baby back ribs 4 hot links 1 2 chicken portion pulled pork also comes 3 sides greens needs more seasoning mac n cheese needs some more salt pepper french fries really good  also give 4 sauces white vinegar based bbq sauce sweet bbq sauce spicy which isn't honestly spicy best off 4 though  also ordered Georgia margarita pretty good! 9 95   Waitress pretty nice but doesn't really check much     ! good GREAT  would eat again but would prefer John mulls long shot  If town square sure would come but did blow water  Good atmosphere nice people decent food drinks  came $86 meal margarita dos equis  <EOR> Excellent food customer service compliments chief recommend chicken pot pie just scrumptious!! Would definitely come back again! <EOR> First off plan give Pot Liquor another shot dinner based all other positive reviews but review Sunday Brunch experience which pretty awful     When walked restaurant almost empty seated right away   However party 2 seated 10 top tall table which odd given abundance open 4 top tables   Right seated manager yelled hostess seating no regard everyone could hear berating her   He sounded ass felt bad told would happy move   He put right next kitchen door far corner   Yes he douche   After seated waited 10 minutes just drink order taken   Then two large parties came seated other corner flag wall    used excuse why waited another 15 minutes food order taken 45 minutes food arrive!  When did arrive cold!    Smoke house hash eggs top hash mix brisket potatos pepperes onions cold mentioned   couldn't eat cold scrambled eggs but hash mix itself tasty enough eat few bites just wish warm   didn't eat cold toast either   Chicken fried steak also cold   did try but told bland tough   We impressed service food all likely returning brunch  <EOR> My young son Easton wife Nikki early Saturday evening provided your card asked feedback regarding dinner experience  Since we'd made point coming Town Square try restaurant thought would follow through few comments   Décor big paned windows dark woods checkered napkins catch your attention Mason jar chandeliers reclaimed wall flag barn boards under bar draw in   big space but feels warm charming cozy inviting  music black white photos throw back simpler time but food culinary statement clearly defined present    Service Your server bus staff knowledgeable menu friendly attentive  city where service often overpromised your staff delivered perfectly   Food wife says cook mean BBQ three smokers own know way around fire smoke  ordered largest combination platters try little everything  WOW!! Everything tasted warm flavorful delicious  particularly liked ribs pulled pork brisket chicken cooked perfection smoked perfectly  All meats tasty tender  wife Florida girl she's familiar most menu offerings but she never heard nor previously tasted Alabama white sauce   great addition other three provided contrasting unique flavor experience  creamy cast iron mac cheese crisp sea salted green beans exceeded expectations  would liked try key lime graham dessert fried pies but just full    Impression Honestly upon sitting down initially surprised pricing which felt little exuberant BBQ  However service portion size quality food presentation quickly squashed first impression  Pot Liquor upscale rustic chic food service experience definitely worth price   We'll definitely back dinner lunch!  Recommendation really only two small suggestions improvement  Again ordered big platter which definitely feeds more two easily could served four  came three sides which awesome! However cornbread side only came two small breads enough share everyone table  Maybe instance when party three four orders big platter choose cornbread side could increase number muffins four just enough around  Everyone wanted biscuit amazing honey butter!   In addition remind your wait staff promote your water giving initiative  really good unique idea deserving attention plus shows you're socially responsible which everyone feel good  didn't know anything until brought hallway  cool idea difference share verbally coaster table tent!

We started Deviled Eggs App devine! Let's just say five plate start Next installment Hunger Games over last one  good y'all!  Between four Carolina Pulled Pork Rack Ribs wow those two order both came two sides each ton food! tad put off prices until saw order food could feed small village  Very very tasty Mac Cheese favorite!  Our server Nancy made sure absolute amazing dinner definitely fans life! <EOR> This restaurant located fairly close airport outdoor shopping plaza    Came early dinner late lunch  Seated fairly quick  Server good food beverage order taken without much delay    Purified water served  better most water Las Vegas area  Food order Tri Tip Sandwich Au Jus Chicken Sandwich  Sandwiches served choice fries  Fries substituted salad sweet potato fries charge  elected regular fries    Tri tip sandwich comes cheese BBQ sauce onions rustic loaf served side au jus  thin sliced tri tip onions cheese rustic bread reminded Philly cheese steak sandwich  Bread little toasted but light BBQ sauce au jus helped give little softness  Sweet BBQ sauce nestling meat good compliment savory salty found through sandwich   Chicken Sandwich lettuce tomatoes onion BBQ sauce slaw  Fried chicken breast huge juicy  Onion sweet crispy  Slaw light sweet savory  Vegetables crisp fresh    French fries okay  Nothing exceptional standout   Good chill place  Execution good  Food okay  <EOR> Quite pricy but long split meals expensive   portions generous   $35 combo platter included pulled pork hot links two kinds ribs two sides enough 2 even leftovers   collard greens pretty good better average   yams OK but nothing special   ribs little dry but couple sauces side   pulled pork really flavorful pretty pulverized greasy   prefer pulled pork little more chunky this   Still only BBQ places Town Square   give A OK three star rating would given 4 star if included any bread platter   Oh could used vegetable sides cornbread but  just good option   BBQ meal should come some bread even if just biscuit roll   Even slice bread would better nothing   couldn't break provide 25 cent roll platter costs over $30      Service good   little slow food but really friendly nice     Weird things bar though sort wonder if escort service operating there   seems pretty blondes hanging bar constantly cell phones never ordering drinks meals   Just hanging coming going whenever phone rings   Someone should look into that  <EOR> Short Review It's all short ribs mac cheese candied sweet potatos   opinion prices bit high especially sides    Longer Review Pot Liquor CAS would 4 stars if all short ribs mac cheese candied sweet potatos   admit short ribs phenominal  pork fan but couldn't resist seconds when girlfriend offered share   short ribs fall off bone literally melts your mouth   But girlfriend's meal   Texas Beef Briskets ordered disappointed   good portion around 8 oz but only thing good it  briskets rubbery no taste dry same time   felt eating ham steak casino buffet beef brisket   Good thing some mac cheese candied sweet potatos wash down     I gave Pot Liquor 3 stars based overall experience   prices bit high especially sides service average  food   just stay away beef briskets unless you're craving ham steak  <EOR> We such high hopes place but alas fell short   brisket fatty underseasoned almost tasteless   sides good great   huge whiskey boubon list turned overinflated 30 kinds   only 2   Waitress very difficult understand   Best thing ate pork rinds   Bummer  <EOR> Zero stars  server twice both times service HORRIBLE     Next time we'll ask moved  Just driveway KS 30 minutes  Terrible <EOR> Surprised mixed reviews here  enjoyed meal friends  dinner plate mopped ribs delicious very tender great smokey flavor too  Kale slaw also very good  only thing wish wet wipes Lucilles has  definitely come back  shame see many folks inside yard house packed  Some sort specials would probably help draw crowds  <EOR> We performed show Baobab stage Friday night  Pot Liquor closing its kitchen but when said some people wanted eat actually kept kitchen open us  nice start experience   The place some nice furniture some weird touches it  There's portrait pig wearing Converse welcomes you  Bar huge plenty seating  sit down tables nice dark wood pretty comfortable seating    We moved some tables fit 20 us  server very nice didn't seemed overwhelmed numbers  She prompt waters everyone  also myself Speakeasy IPA  highly recommend if IPAs aromas tastes IPA less barky taste some IPAs have    For food never going wrong Moinks  bacon wrapped meatballs covered sweet hot barbecue sauce  bacon crispy meatball itself flavored well  pulled pork slider also nice treat if looking some snacks  If win I'd Brisket Burger  $20 gets burger 8 oz angus beef 4 oz brisket  huge  Your heart might ready but your stomach be   I've gotten some great service place  Often overlooked would yourself favor yourself IPA some Moinks here  <EOR> Stopped 8th day soft opening   official opening supposed around 8th 9th October     Sat bar staff very quick drink order   Nice see fresh lemonade free refills   took time perusing menu bartender suggested plate pork rinds while made decision   Tasty warm touch lime salt   Being Filipino prefer little meat pork rinds just skin   But  personal bias won't let influence review   Decided half order dry rubbed ribs green beans cornbread muffins   green beans crisp tender very well seasoned   corn muffins 3 half sized ones good very good honey butter side   The ribs very good here!  Very flavorful dry rub meat falling off bone tender   two 'que sauces served side 1 smoky 2 little more heat   Nice give both always order more   nice touch ribs come table individually sliced   Sometimes don't feel fighting your meat even if knife your hand!    Some reviews complained wait   Can't comment wait 'cause watching football usually lose all track time when watching football     I liked atmosphere here   Cool black white photos unique saxophone chandelier classic rock playing background   staff very attentive owners assistant manager came introduced themselves asked experience     The only gripe dessert   haven't good fried pie long time happy see menu   But    duh  duh  duhhhhhhh      they didn't any   WHAAAAATTTT?!
