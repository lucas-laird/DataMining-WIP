Very cheap yet great quality food  Huevos Rancheros very satisfied!  I totally recommend La Salsa Cantina! <EOR> Went while traveling across country stop Vegas   just left MGM decided hungry late night since coming Ohio where no Mexican restaurants open late go!  Food very average   Overpriced extremely Americanized Mexican food   expecting little bit more La Salsa Cantina but then found best part place yard margarita!  They charging 17 50 well tequila 19 top shelf tequila which chose!  also keep glass which added plus!  don't play around drinks them strong taking care rest night!  I don't know if I'd suggest spending money food but definitely drinks if come well worth especially if start night free drinks while gambling rest night! <EOR> Skip food straight half yard margarita to go  When Vegas take advantage opportunity enjoy your alcoholic beverage street  They're $17 50 19 50 depending choose but trust MORE getting your money's worth   I prefer mine rocks salt  way see and amazed much alcohol they're putting in  somewhat less importantly find frozen ones sweet  <EOR>
