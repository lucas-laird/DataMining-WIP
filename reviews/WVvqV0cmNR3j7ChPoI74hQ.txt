As soon checked Yelp  first time coming said earned 50% off coupon  Right off bat KNEW would try find some way skate letting use first timers Yelp coupon     EXACTLY did   You see 3 eating 'times' Breakfast Lunch Dinner  Lunch ENDS 3 PM  quite naturally should assumed 2 female waitresses ORDERING DINNER arrived 4 PM    whole HOUR 3 pm when lunch supposedly 'ended'  coupon clearly said DINNER see attached photo      exactly time for    DINNER    When pointed Yelp coupon waitress she said Well lunch portion      avoided letting use coupon  Here's problem though  NO POINT did 2 waitresses ask if ordering lunch dinner  shouldn't ask because clearly DURING DINNER HOURS  When asked difference between 'lunch' 'dinner' was    she basically said PORTION SIZE PRICE  Ok  fine    but why God's Green Earth would bring lunch portion when lunch clearly according your own menu OVER MORE HOUR AGO  She then elaborated dinner ordered any time     which begs question anyone working brain If dinner ordered any time then WHY even 'dinner time' ???  So ordered grilled snapper plate   Before actual meal arrived gave sweet cornbread pancake  honestly only surprisingly good thing place  2 sides ordered along 'lunch plate' red beans rice greens   The Grilled Red Snapper portion size incredibly disappointing  thought would getting WHOLE snapper grilled    least WHOLE FILET    NOPE! literally gave 1 4 size fish  little piece fish gave could LITERALLY fit palm hand  onions peppers put top fish bigger then fish itself  finished little piece crap 4 bites!
