Where did go? belly yep   But other sweet potato fries don't know much would rant rave place    I ordered sin city burger tasty  patty itself well flavored  bun soft buttery  egg just well done crispy  But overall solid burger  Bacon strip cut half try cover most burger didn't work well   The regular smash fries suck though  Bland limp major suck age  haystack onions pretty tasty just kinda greasy    I walked away place really enjoying burger but don't know if best burger ever    I crippled poor customer service starting girl didn't know ring ended using wrong groupon   itself experience  am sure felt bad it  made feel crippling them problem  Manager finally came said sorry leave table while cracking knuckles  opinion just professional  Maybe nervous tick but easily misconstrued taken another way   It's fancy dressed burger fast food feel it  Definitely worth trying least once  would return if others wanted just don't know would say place burgers  sweet potato fries yes  <EOR> Excellent customer service  Felt welcome moment husband walked in  Carrie Bella very friendly  Food great excellent quality  Bacon cheeseburger no cheese tomato lettuce  And classic no onion well done garlic fries coke  <EOR>
