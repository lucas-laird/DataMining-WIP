Wrong! chips skinny french fries completely soggy  could find crunchy whole plate  fish batter also very soggy  pleasant eat    Bottom line price tag high mediocre food  Money better spent elsewhere <EOR> First off *appetizer entrées sides all served cold   *manager Todd friendly helpful  *food did arrive timely manner  *steaks cooked preferred temp   So family come around same time year dinner  Previous times excellent food service then but time around  reservations 6 30pm but arrived around 6 15pm  Hostess seemed scatterbrained took while seat us  When seated took another 10 minutes drink order  time ordered appetizers entrèes almost 7 00pm  Now waiter Carlos very friendly could see running around all tables fast he could noticed case many other waiters  Staffing issues maybe?  We waited maybe another 30 minutes COLD appetizers arrive but hungry did mind coldness point  ordered calamari bacon wrapped shrimp  calamari worth price whatsoever  mostly breeding crumbs hardly any actual squid plate    A long wait later finally entrèes except little sister ordered burger off kid's menu  party 10 won't write each order but myself Chef Special Lobster Thermidor  plate cold touch pieces risotto cooked all way still crunch  boyfriend dad steaks really rare when asked medium  long food took arrive surprised even cooked asked for!  Our food hot more borderline cold  time all adults finished food  when little sister burger  server told cooks forgot burger  She waited long she even hungry anymore    At point decided talk manager Todd  uncle pulled over table let know situation but Todd couldn't seemed care less  He did apologize empathize whatsoever  He simply responded Okay  want do? hands hips!! Well apology long way  did end getting discount meal but money issue   If he tried empathize even little bit might returned next year but never again! If hire more staff  especially back house food service may faster hell lot better!! <EOR> Since moving Los Angeles Las Vegas couple years ago wife discovered great steak house easy find but good fish dinner takes bit more effort   Many seafood restaurants Asian New Orleans theme often specialize shellfish   Now knocking Emeril's New Orleans Fish House any means but place serves variety well prepared fish without breaking bank reason take note   If happens mile off Strip Paradise Road version restaurant row much better   nice if don't fight your way through casino crowds every time dinner   I always liked Los Angeles version McCormick Schmick's but Las Vegas version indispensable   most recent dinner consisted lump crab tower avocado mango lobster bisque stuffed halibut   might mistake pick three such rich dishes guess feeling quite full myself having fish rather meat dinner but left just feeling quite full   Still each course very good   service attentive   dining room very comfortable low lighting miracle miracles around unless you're dining Le Cirque someplace comparable no giant screen TV playing the game visible table   All all think great choice seafood dinner   Oh steaks pretty good too  <EOR> You'd think fish restaurant would know cook fish until turns charred lump shit but hey expect Landry's restaurant?
