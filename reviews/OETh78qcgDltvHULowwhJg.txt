Waiters interested unless you're table  Bottom line doesn't worth high price charge <EOR> Worst service ever 60$ steak worth visit steak Taste ok but nothing upscale better try burger joint restaurant going downhill <EOR> Was looking forward great meal very disappointing  restaurant very noisy music very loud  yell friends across table  Food cooked okay however no presentation  first night first time Vegas  following days saw many more interesting restaurants watched beautiful plates pass by   which next time restaurant  <EOR> Not best Steak House strip far fact   two mediocre meals place   Cost 4 approx $600   think money would spent better elsewhere  <EOR> Very disappointed service excellent but steaks below average  just spent week Vegas some fantastic meals  worst far  bone ribeye tough could barely chew it  steak cooked medium requested but very poor cut meat  Another person party Boone New York strip said awful   return  <EOR> AMAZING   Period   food excellent service EXCEPTIONAL   Never treated well given such attention   wait staff amazing above beyond   wife joked must mistaken someone else   waiter Ted best could asked wife even hugged left!lol   happy even felt compelled add already large tip   Seeing Gordon Ramsey himSELF Yes happened! added bonus though overstayed welcome playing paparazzi !!!   experience never forget  <EOR> This place must visit type spot  Just try it  wait over hour in  another hour wait food  nice them show all selections beef  if your looking quick spot  definitely place to  If your wasting time waiting people then good place try out  ONLY if before  steak nothing fancy  could better steak somewhere else  But since Gordon Ramsey's restaurant worth try  walked paying $600 4 people  Which weren't completely satisfied  just took much time enjoy food  Wouldn't come back unless free food no wait  <EOR> This most anticipated restaurant opening Las Vegas  Chef Ramsay stocking Stations Casinos winners Hell's Kitchen but he hadn't opened own yet  loved shows if you're only seeing Hell's Kitchen Kitchen Nightmares you're missing best BBC America  own most cookbooks tried lot meals own but really wanted sample some creations under direction Executive Chef Deric Meininger  weren't disappointed   This where decided wedding anniversary  made reservations month advance sure didn't run into any snags  flowers waiting Brenda table daughter stopped evening bottle wine waiting well  Although reservations still waited few minutes seated  weren't upset considering many people just walking podium getting turned away because didn't reservations   Once table ready walked through large bar area into high ceilinged dining room  first thing noticed when sitting down besides large Union Jack ceiling seemed music playing much louder needed which distracted bit romantic evening  However time food served hardly noticed any more  Because special occasion decided really going splurge meals  really wanted try Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu $145 person but many other good things menu try well decided wait until next time that  While ordering brought selection breads Devonshire butter topped black sea salt  rolls pancetta center fantastic  Brenda really wanted try some sauces listed shellfish platter tiger prawns king crab clams lobster started that  When arrived huge platter knew weren't going leaving hungry  least two each type shellfish sauces especially champagne mignonette really brought flavors much better regular cocktail sauce everywhere else  second course seared Foie Gras  came delicious puree quickly polished off two us   We both knew wanted steak dinner  Your waiter asks ahead time whether you're having steak if wheel large mirrored display various cuts beef serve explain each you  32 ounce Royal Long bone Chop Brenda ordered American Kobe Filet  sides heirloom carrots sautéed spinach caramelized Brussels sprouts fingerling potatoes  I said splurging  While waited food ordered another bottle wine watched wait staff action  exactly you'd expect high end restaurant  attentive polite but never intrusive  When food arrived knew stomachs some trouble  filet probably perfect size 8 ounces but think could beaten someone death long bone chop because large  only steak huge but side dishes well  No spoonful vegetable potatoes whatever  large bowls at least full cup more each one  definitely meant sharing  Both steaks fantastic  Even though chop over inch thick still tender cooked perfect medium rare  filet tender could cut fork  If any disappointment very little would side dishes  Brussels sprouts good but good ones cook home using Chef Ramsay's Christmas Special recipe  liked fingerling potatoes but prefer ones GR Pub Grill bit more  spinach outstanding only thing didn't taken home doggie bag  cap off dinner both cappuccinos ordered some Sticky Toffee Pudding hearing all raves it  don't very big sweet tooth just border for being sweet but worth it  brown butter ice cream came although sounding strange very good perfectly pudding cake  Luckily GR Pub Grill toffee pudding menu well find somewhere without spending much money   Overall outstanding meal service experience  cost bit high side $500 two including two bottles wine tip but well worth every penny  place you're going every month but if special occasion don't mind spending money should your must visit food destinations  <EOR> The restaurant itself located inside Paris casino  Upon arrival greeted hostess confirmed reservation guided inside  She explained types food offered pointed fluorescent lighting fixture center ceiling saying depiction Gordon's hands cooking  just looked random fluorescents me   Anyway seated waiter came over took drink orders  When came time order food cart uncooked steak wheeled table given explanation each cut  ended ordering 32oz porterhouse homemade steak sauce truffle infused macaroni cheese     After 30 minutes food arrived  porterhouse ordered HUGE looked something straight food magazine perfect every way  When took first bite just melted chair  taste pure perfection  Even though full half way through made sure eat rest    The macaroni cheese also very good  could really taste truffle texture spot on  only downside place price  going pay $$$ meal but worth every penny something remember long time  wanted try dessert but absolutely full even attempt few bites  only give 5 stars if experience truly exceptional  establishment exceeded expectations  <EOR> Matthew server he awesome   food great wife anniversary awesome experience  Everything bread

Take miss  <EOR> This probably most disappointing fine dining experiences ever Las Vegas   short extremely stuck very accommodating   Read long version   I've lot fine dining major hotel casinos town   cornerstones fine dining experience opinion accommodate customer   Well case Gordon Ramsey Steak   place snobbish attitude take what's menu it    It special occasion dinner but never asked such   But  okay   sat area apart main dining room so view good  bit more claustrophobic sort felt being segregated away real customers put into cheap seats    arrived hour past opening whatever   Waiter seemed take forever around steak presentation ordering but such delay least problem although hindsight may red flag    Skip ahead food ordering where night downhill   Wife does fish but interested seafood dish menu listed four seafood items which fish   asked waiter if possible switch fish shrimp   immediate response chef doesn't accommodate substitutes  making some comment food costs   without even giving courtesy pretending he ask chef he said couldn't done   He then tried direct other la carte items menu but lack accommodation combined snotty attitude left very poor impression   When ordered steak asked Medium Well and then added Medium Well Plus because often found experiences when ask steak medium well come very much medium because steaks thick  thought would emphasize waiter hopefully cooking staff would sure more medium well side entire steak saying Medium Well Plus   wasn't trying anything more   yet snooty waiter moment said Medium Well Plus gave look said can't really that  seeing wife treated order knowing much pissed off laughed loud when waiter decided double down snooty response request   He away but point contemplated just getting leaving   Spoke management moved different table   New waiter better but wasn't much more waiter damage already done    bright spot complained management did take steps accommodate and also providing better explanation snooty waiter why chef could accommodate request made earlier    clear case poor customer service management part waiter     As food well would expect steak great place called Steak $62 price tag  indeed good steak but would say anymore amazing then encountered many other steak places town   respect just okay   wife's entree consisted single small lobster tail    No sides given almost left ordering entrees understand why chose order any sides point    complimentary bread good but felt took them long bring out   We Sticky Toffee Pudding dessert   probably highlight entire evening   salvaged overall bad experience somewhat but still much conciliation   would recommend management stick ice cream little bit bigger match portion size pudding   I know review isn't going any impact whatsoever people continuing dine Gordon Ramsay  type restaurant type people regardless negative Yelp reviews and probably overshadowed hundreds other glowing reviews diners feel obligated give glowing review such establishments order justify outrageous amount money spent such dining    But wanted least review calls place really  another affront bourgeois snobbery town sadly much around days   many fine dining diners restaurants think amazing dining experience just because ambiance presentation food plate final bill price  say takes more just fancy presentation overpriced entrees restaurant truly fine dining experience  <EOR> After visiting many Gordon Ramsey's restaurants London complete let down  sure much Mr Ramsey associated restaurant but without doubt worst $250 meal two ever had  quality ingredients would expect al carte  drinks best part meal  <EOR> I take annual pilgrimage Vegas friends three nights steak other ways kill ourselves early  decided see Mr  Ramsay us  short review food great but service very good  7 30 reservation showed 7 25  seated until 8 20 no apology any sort acknowledgement wait  Parties two came while party four waited waited  Once seated promptly greeted drink orders taken  drinks took another lifetime arrive  able order food but apps did arrive another 40 minutes  apps fine but just hungry time  meat took even longer arrive but served beautifully  Royal Chop which full flavor did hesitate pick bone find last bits meat  sides well prepared complemented meal quite well  desserts quite good  don't typically care toffee but dessert advertised  didn't leave restaurant until 11 00 7 30 reservation wasn't because taking sweet time  would certainly come back food but left very disappointed service time took  Yes Saturday night but restaurant never full any point  <EOR> While vacationing Vegas visited all 3 Ramsay restaurants   3 worst   extremely loud hard talk   waiter hardly checked no personality  food however good mainly husband could try beef wellington which he enjoyed   Another bummer     offer Hell's Kitchen dining experience but everyone your table order $145 per person   would never able eat all food but husband would have   Gordon's pub grill much better experience  <EOR> One worse experience ever had  food so  food very bland steak overcooked  worst thing wait staff very pretentious  top off birthday  sister only party order dessert  When brought sisters dessert single handle said happy birthday wait staff  Which would nice gesture if wasn't someone else's food  never ever back <EOR> The food all very good but service little shoddy akward  First hostess took reservation didn't enter properly into system when showed tried seat lounge  speak two different hostesses then manager before given table restaurant  Then appetizer ordered seafood platter  two options small large ordered small  waiter asked if wanted any wine said we'd stick beer  food came 10 minutes started eat waiter came back said some bad news accidentally ordered large seafood platter which considerable more expensive but I'd comp bottle wine   he asking pay larger dish which didn't order trouble would give bottle wine which he already knew didn't want  He didn't put much fight when told weren't interested but top tier restaurant something should never ever happen  <EOR> Best food had  Everything service bread cocktails food    AMAZING! left realizing old question would your last meal answered! <EOR> HUGE FAN Sticky Toffee Pudding! lived hype! wish would've able start dessert first  it good! Food portions good size  waiter attentive although when he described meat cut selection wheel your table  he seemed robot  Husband Beef Wellington bone marrow appetizer Chicken dish   both flavorful  come back next time town   even if its Drinks dessert  <EOR> One best meals ever restaurant   beef Wellington signature dish  Melt your mouth beef tender pastry  Divine! Excellent customer service well  even brush off bread crumbs bread service  While waiting your main course bring beef rack where educate different cuts beef cooked  Very educational! Overall excellent food above average customer service  Pricey but worth it  reservation tonight ! <EOR> We did reservations but walked 2 seats bar immediately  ordered pork belly appetizer which tasty but bit underwhelming  server informed Wellington ordered would take 45 mins cook  probably closer hour during dinner rush but well worth wait  wine fantastic pairing complimentary breads fantastic well  catch show bit rush didn't time truly enjoy full dining experience but still wonderful time phenomenal meal! <EOR> Simply divine  Impeccable service delicious food  Beef Wellington superb  Definitely worth every penny  love Gordon Ramsey's shows having seen much he gets other people quality ingredients customer service high expectations  Both Steak restaurant Burgr place definitely live them though  <EOR> We visit LV probable couple times year  Every time would point trying well reviewed restaurant  steak person but hubby decided try Gordon Ramsey Steak Paris Hotel   We arrived time reservation seated right away  We Spago once even reservation made wait over hours  everything just continued better better  stranger fine dining would rate GRS top list  Taste very important but opinion service absolutely essential  Bad service great food tastes sawdust  four course meal menu each us  love every dish  didn't feel rushed wait food   So ratings Service Awesome!

Overall food ok but certainly worth excessive price tag   basically paying extra name hoping food lives reputation   Unfortunately entire experience falls short  <EOR> Best meal ever! did appetizer side dish circuit eat heavy before night life  Last reservation 1015  Pork belly cheese grits foie gras oysters half shell Mac cheese truffles spinach all yummy!

PS also Hell's Kitchen Tasting Experience menu which includes some Chef's famous foods but really price range $145 person    autographed picture menu included experience  <EOR> While food good although certainly best had little taken back when bill 6 included charge $36 00 distilled water!  While customary asked if would distilled sparkling water never charged $9 00 per bottle distilled water    also no way hell six drank total 4 bottles water addition other alcohol soft drinks ordered  Also never saw server open single bottle water bit every time turned around re topping off water glasses even though only sip two drank    I no objection spending $110 00 porterhouse two even $6 00 wife's diet coke     but felt completely ripped off obvious bill padding water!  On positive note service atmosphere exceptional would recommend people visit but warned hidden charges <EOR> My partner restaurants since Gordon Ramsay fans   several restaurants endorsed celebrity chefs such Wolfgang Puck Geoffrey Zakarian   Some restaurants mediocre best   GR Steak however elevates dishes different level   Both partner ordered Hell's Kitchen prix fixe menu wine pairing two words    Instant Love    oh love bf too!

Sadly disappointed won't returning here   Tried reservations week advance but all 10PM later   Considering sometimes passed bed time Vegas depending day drinking goes decided risk opt see if could table lounge right opening time   Well worked!!  able right around 6PM when walked needed table 4     The atmosphere pretty nice   Great decor tables cool light them   Waitresses wear sexy sequined short dresses which made good conversation eye candy men   ordered blueberry vodka club soda which delicious   other 3 party didn't order anything drink husband already drunk other couple don't really drink much    However looked great wine selection give ipad which cool   As ordered    my husband other guy both ordered kobe steak ordered salmon friend ordered seafood platter   starters salad other person shrimp cocktail   both fine   Nothing rave disappointed really     Then food came out   salmon barely lukewarm center NO flavor whatsoever   ordered mushrooms side ok    husband's kobe steak which $80 believe!! ok    rarer medium which he ordered but didn't want send back given crowd long might take   good I tried it don't wrong   But better steaks 1 2 price   He ordered mashed potatotes side which really delicious!  it!  would say salmon list bottom 10 salmon dishes ever tried   Maybe off night something dish   know known steaks but      Also don't even think waitress ever came back asked food tasted might told some feedback   Maybe she didn't ask because she knew   haha  The total bill $425 4 I cocktail nobody else drank truly all food  no dessert anyone either! Very pricey food opinion   chain restaurant called Firebirds would everyday steak and or salmon before Gordon Ramsay's   Even if same price I'd still choose Firebirds   Hopefully Gordon restaurant experiences place did  Then he'll yell chef things change better  <EOR> We came end Vegas trip nice meal close  Again prior before turned vegetarian  first thing say  many better options places eat Vegas lot less money please consider before come here  Once try milk every penny    With said steak pretty good  actually don't remember cut but unusual cut Kobe  side mac n' cheese good    Unfortunately price meal just made everything taste bit worse  tell everything excuse charge higher prices  overstaffed attractive women nothing front waiter brings over weird steak board gives sermon history each type steak  also try hard really high end place but fail  assistant waiter brought wrong food twice  really hope guy wasn't intern hoping full time offer because wouldn't give him!

If hipster without expectation service quality food service another location   Gordon Ramsey Steak House big failure! <EOR> I came birthday few years ago time thought best steak ever had  Came back again weekend Wagyu Rib Cap rather underwhelming  also ordered Foie Gras add which bland tasteless lacked texture  However biggest disappointment all Beef Wellington which took extra long cook  filet overdone past medium rare bland pastry shell flakey but rather soggy fell apart upon cutting  may consider coming back only Wagyu Rib Cap but  only because just love cut meat only place seen even menu  <EOR> I'm exactly sure think  guess expectations off  dined solo service great seated right away  $6 soda but least refills free  ordered beef wellington mac cheese  Wellington kind disappointment dunno if what  cooked great but just didn't enjoy flavor  Mac Cheese super rich couldn't finish it  Solo diner cost $82 but feel should only cost $20  Luckily won enough cover otherwise I'd bit more irked cost versus quality   I want add something heard recently while watching Masterchef  Ramsay stressed importance tasting beef   might case here  might used eating steaks swimming A1 sauce don't know nicely cooked steak tastes its own  least want fair review admit might misplaced expectations  <EOR> Best steak ever life  checked off bucket lists ordering Tomahawk steaks both us! 32 oz Long bone Chop Dry aged 28 days cook perfection!

Overall amazing experience dreaming eating again!  can't say enough good things Gordon Yum! <EOR> I almost feel if know Gordon Ramsay watching endless parade hit television programs living room   constant learned Gordon over years would passion perfection   thought would finally experience small slice during long awaited visit Gordon Ramsay Steak Vegas last night    but didn't quite happen way      You see although food very good service more adequate certain WOW factor missing   Lets start atmosphere   doesn't much look steak house but rather bold trendy neo modernistic pub guess   ceiling festooned  enormous in your face Union Jack whilst red glowing intestines dangled below pass chandelier some sort   music much loud fine dining type experience bare table  look although trendy just proper fine dining   iPad cocktail menu right home though eye candy hostesses back seam stockings somewhat show own     I impression waitstaff hired merit looks alone seemed bit awkward quite literally tripping over one another    would almost certainly more comfortable models rather order takers   also distinct impression trying bit hard turn tables    first such clue stern admonishment Wellington would take quite while coming kitchen may wise another selection   second clue would removal cocktail glasses without offering second round   But guess kicker would fact when did leave hadn't gotten two three steps away actually bumped into next guests being ushered sit down uncleaned un set former table   All food probably just tad under cooked which actually fine but much guests   thought taste temperature presentation food spot on   Many talk prices being lofty but actually level price dictated more demand place certainly plenty now   Gordon could probably hike prices another 10% still sell out nights   bread served dinner probably most enjoyable course   certain buttery spread just hint cheese provided such perfect taste texture finish absolutely steals show   dissapointed find Alaskan Halibut removed menu thought would signature dishes   Here's free tip Gordon update little fact web site menu blokes don't turn wanting Halibut only learn 86'd ok mate?  I still recommend visit though   much steak house compete likes Ruth's Chris Mortons but rather experience culture trendy ambiance flavor fashion assembled just right amount pretentiousness prove captivating  <EOR> Absolutely amazing!!!!!

But ruined terrible server  He walked past 6 times repeat 6 times gf finished eating food  Clean plates all! Staring he walked past several times until finally upset said Look chris walked past several times would look desert menu  He answered back oh thought still working your meal he then cleaned table awhile wondered why decided desert all  just explained lose your craving such long wait  funny thing never thought would ever write review place much less negative review  But say love food but waiter extremely rude condescending   Oh anyone sits area if say no cocktails prepared but if you're neighbors ordered cocktails wines decent service him  sure would return which upsetting seeing always rambled gf friends Ramsay's shows   Great job food Christina hell's kitchen  Memorable dinner bad wrong reasons  <EOR> Beginning food everything sampled menu bread through dessert simply sublime  Dinner culinary tour delights each dish bringing multiple layers distinctive flavors  going walk through dinner menu other note every appetizer entree dessert table something rave about   Ramsay's team lavished care extraordinary attention every small detail dining experience staging presentation staff attire service protocol  gold standard memorable dining experience   The spoiler loud foreground music referring detainee torture loud  understand Ramsay looking smart high energy edgy your face want turn tables quickly  Research shows people eat drink more faster high tempo loud music when people surrounded sound brain chemistry changes other senses measurably enhanced  Food tastes better you're prone over indulge  Anyway if relish bout ringing ears adverse conversation table Ramsay's happen you   Ramsay's might provide elegant tasty solution If date  attractive but afflicted unfortunate voice   Yes drawn quartered when check arrives but understand 'nice costs' its something you'll doing every day  save some damage specifying tap water   When inquire if you'd prefer still sparkling water don't mention ten bucks small bottle they're anxious proactively keep cracking new bottles you   Ramsay's provides extraordinary memorable dining experience compromised for offensively loud music I dinged Ramsay's star adversarial sound environment  understand losing voice rock concert but over dinner  <EOR> When reviewing any eatery any sort always important manage expectations  instance might've walked into random dive looked horrible disgusting but ended giving above average food which turn might translate 4 even 5 stars  However if hyped steakhouse bearing name most renowned chefs world give anything but finest cut meat you've ever easy immediately downgrade count 3 stars furiously copy paste word overrated couple hundred times  when restaurant Gordon Ramsay Steak receives 5 star rating assured place definitely no joke   I usually start food but entire experience well thought just start moment entered restaurant  reservation 5 7pm promptly took table when arrived  young lady guided even gave quick little tour explanation restaurant detailing designs thought behind ambiance  nice little touch duly noted   Our waiter immediately brought ipad menu showed different alcoholic beverages serving gave chance look over before taking orders  decided Southside which take mojito  tasted absolutely refreshing little more kick mint flavor other mojitos but all all solid drink    Next served three types bread  some type lemon focaccia another some sort prosciutto roll other didn't try sorry descriptions but hadn't eaten all day anticipation mind pretty blurred hunger   roll hands down best one  kind looks cinammon roll prosciutto flavor came really well almost flavoring chinese pork bun but obviously little more sophisticated tastier    And main course go  really wanted try both beef wellington rib eye ended splitting someone with  beef wellington signature dish absolutely perfect  meat tender all them cooked medium rare puff pastry crust mushroom puree complimented meat perfectly  think also hint mustard somewhere but wasn't strong all added nice dimension steak  rib eye also outstanding  Granted liked wellington lot probably marked mellowness enthusiasm rib eye but guess when you're eating two different steaks them stand inevitably cause other take backseat  However fair rib eye riding shotgun hand wheel  also cooked perfect medium rare noticeably didn't huge globs fat hanging off sides fat well distributed throughout meat wasn't overbearing but still added delicious lardy flavor all crave good cut steak isn't must but saw bone marrow menu decided give try let tell made steak taste much better  bone marrow pretty much just fat scoop small portions eat them your steak  If your budget definitely give shot because well worth it   At point your stomach probably sending mad signals your brain telling stop eating dessert question  time when must concentrate dig deep order sticky toffee pudding  really no description better suited dessert orgasm your mouth  comes toffee sauce pour onto pudding which just melts your mouth side butter ice cream it literally looks stick butter   regret this   I must say quite premier steakhouse  Granted did run into couple slips ups  waiter would disappear prolonged periods time if weren't sheer number waiters passing table probably would've docked least half star  Also sure specify want tap water  waiter gave glass jar water charged even though simply asked 5 glasses water  guess didn't specify type water wanted but let's honest if see 5 marginally employed college grads think want pay $18 water? But when all said done reflected waiter's tip more importantly don't want waiter take anything away rest amazing experience  generally hate giving 5 star reviews but amazing food coupled chill hip atmosphere going forced hand  Just sure hit tables afterwards restock your wallet or broke   <EOR> You know why guy where culinary world  complementary arrange bread amazing!  indulged New York strip which cooked perfectly medium potato purée elegant  Lastly carrots no other     <EOR> Very good surprise restaurant came restaurant Saturday 7pm table right away staff very nice right recommendations  American Kobe filet medium rare daughter  American Kobe rib cap well done both done perfection! Thx Jessica daughter turn meal said thank best steak ever!!! agree! <EOR> My friend raves place but quite disappointed tasting menu  Although all items tasted good came lukewarm beef wellington very tender  lot expensive tasting menus but wasn't worth price get  Service very impersonal front rude sometimes  Table wasn't ready time reservation  Starters appetizers delicious though  <EOR> This fourth time Gordon Ramsay Steak unfortunately very disappointed  start off ran foie gras favorite ordered tartar lobster tail  pretty good would highly recommend tartar  main course pretty disappointing though  American Eye which center cut ribeye wrapped bacon  ordered medium rare but dry bland especially when compared  ribcap filet beef wellington  also left string ribeye used hold bacon place  waiter Jessica seemed rushed never asked meal going  bussers also preoccupied something else  food subpar especially compared last few times there  bad really Gordon Ramsay Steak but overall poor experience  <EOR> Mr  Gordon Ramsay!!!

Also  coffee chocolate spoons  won't disapointed anything! <EOR> I emailed review manager via Caesar's website received essentially no follow other thanks feedback  While understand no obligation issue credit refund apology would appreciated particularly dinner special event  <EOR> Easily best steakhouses ever to   experience itself step above experience other steakhouses presentation service   Yes prices steep but any Steakhouse strip you'll set back around same prices but really think value great here   Here presentation great   Atmosphere superb date   Steaks brought let choose your cut   Just great see slabs raw meat finely marbled before they're cooked   I bone in 28 oz ribeye which cooked perfection Pittsburgh   steak definitely top 5 life eaten lot steak   Now quality control steak house isn't exactly exact science but I'd say most likely having same tier steak had   I highly recommend coming trying least once both steak experience  <EOR> Steaks awesome but kinda expensive serving size  Las Vegas Strip pricing effect sure  Weird red lighting everywhere  uncomfortable red lit scenes 1981 Disney bomb The Devil Max Devlin starring Elliott Gould Bill Cosby  Surprised Gordon Ramsay approved lighting here  say color red hungry     Cap Ribeye $60 a k a  Spinalis steak favorite cut even more Hanger Steak  Both extremely hard find special orders even best independent butcher shops  maybe worth splurge all?  The English Chowder $18 pretty terrible  Don't even think ordering it  Exactly tiny scallop minuscule bit fish 3 halves fingerling potato  Boring white chowder unnecessarily snazzy presentation pour soup front you   Bottom line Gordon Ramsay Steak just fine regardless lighting or crappy Chowder   <EOR> The steak bland  could used better seasonings  appetizer Maine lobster bread service excellent  definitely better steak elsewhere  would recommend place since didn't try everything menu but disappointed bone prime rib  <EOR> Buying experience Vegas tourist!  Excited small hype among friends over GR steak before trip Vegas  Glad able squeeze into last reservation night 10 ish pm day itself thanks help concierge Paris Las Vegas!  Gotta agree other yelpers being lost waitress door asked proceed restaurant   Basically just sit wait till someone notices entered restaurant  If bug them till showed your seats  Else just left sofa waiting      After 15mins being showed seats menu look at  long waitress rolled beef parts excellent introduction meat! detailed good!

Sure  But good enough noticed it  <EOR> We've 3x still come back more  place awesome steak made perfectly right your satisfaction  <EOR> This steakhouse  hellish disappointment   music loud scream date talk all   Normally order nice bottle napa valley wine meal Well music loud lost desire indulge  lost $150 plus sale  ordered $14 00 cocktail  blue bread dishes smudges it   ordered steak medium came rare over salted   Then song Anarchy Sex Pistols came felt guilty eating $50 piece meat   side dishes came tin cups ones toddlers used play with   loaded baked potato unloaded flavorless  did offer fresh black pepper caesar salad  waiters arrogant attitudes shouldn't complain because Gordon Ramsay restaurant   experienced tasted way better steak meals Vegas  meal experience would great tv episode  Maybe Gordon shoud kitchen  <EOR> This most anticipated dinner boyfriend's vacation vegas   couple years ago could stop talking amazing experience   time different unfortunately Upon seating waiter introduced himself saying hello kids    now am 24 boyfriend 28 while may younger normal clientele he continued address multiple times kids   when spend $ 450 two people being called kids multiple times insulting   The first time waiter showed cart amazing steaks ask server please show steaks  server assistant fantastic but waiter kept saying same joke thought going save bite? He said six times upon clearing plates     The food good but amazing last time  for price pretty disappointed meal hope day experience same magic first time went  <EOR> My wife mine 20 year anniversary didn't party because knew would Vegas youngest daughter both Ramsay steak fan she's seven course good luck future husband   First good service expected very strong  hiking strip all day really dressed restaurant if status  Regardless never felt treated any less respectfully guests dressed even two young kids  service itself definitely five star   Now greats emergency siren off quite loudly first 15 minutes very annoying but told staff happens often Vegas although first time experienced this    We ordered beef wellington two daughter ordered American Filet  told wellis would take 55 minutes which well expected  Surprisingly came 30 which nice  daughter gave filet strong thumbs which rarely steaks she gives points start gone before taste  wellington pretty good but fall off chair would expected might because set bar high but wife same comment hers  also ordered seafood side which very good  PLEASE cateful assumed side might $30 $95 did ask no knock fault but just careful also very good    Overall very good experience $125 head price OK considering 20th anniversary all big Ramsay fans but just prepared    I did couple drinks something Habanero infused quite tasty   I would say time experience very strong but price could great experiences elsewhere less  Ramsay fans least once sitting kitchen fun but don't shout RAW apparently joke happens often  <EOR> Worst customer service ever    My family celebration dinner July 15th 2017  gave them credit card pay dinner did return back table  refused acknowledge lost card blamed mistake  left called left message stating found card would manager drive over meet return it  called them back then refused this  punted security punted lost found  Lost found would answer phone cancel card   Will never return  <EOR> We anniversary dinner Thursday night  service just wonderful  short ribs  mostly fat  disappointed  husband daughter ribeye steak  Both where great  Mac cheese world  food did ever sit under heat lamp over 10 mins before food  red sauce stuck dinner plate didn't enjoy that  sticky toffee cake delicious  Definitely bit overpriced but good time  sure if would back  <EOR> So follow Gordan Ramsey's shows especially favorite FWord BBC  Vegas home away home  also eat steakhouses just every month  Definitely every vacation   anticipation high  Months reserved spent waiting dreaming Beef Wellington American Kobe steak      Let start saying 3 stars hard want put more but struggling  waited long then disappointed  pains even say those words Gordan Ramsey restaurant  average cause half evening awesome other half awesome         first walking restaurant see everything going big  sign all way ceiling cool covered entrance  Next thing notice all host look same just attire  literally all look creepy   being told wait which anticipated being new restaurant course Gordan Ramsey restaurant  sat lounge which bunch tall tables chairs bunch small tables chairs  small table  trouble finding waitress cause said all look like  Here's where things start wrong side restaurant    ordered some drinks Oana off list ordered usuall girly drink Vodka Sprite Cranberry  Oana's pretty good but bartender waitress can't follow direction read because mine terrible  First no Cranberry which clearly receipt very strong I love some Vodka but straight Russian  Then sip she asks if ready settle tab  probably 30 minute wait just sat down  understand she just doing job but way she said tone rushed nice  30 minutes someone comes says table ready  Sweet she walks over area where all waitresses pick drinks every bar little area  stand way everyone 10 minute before suggest wife back lounge  back found open seat waited another 5 minutes before came back said table actually ready  settled tab very small tip  want say can't remember every being treated poorly 5 star restaurant int lounge Gordan Ramsey's      all being said here's where starts being awesome  finally seated main  area next stairs near kitchen  eating area walking into whole other restaurant atmosphere decor attitude totally different then lounge  sat tall booth chairs totally awesome  decor say 5 stars amazing   waiter Adrian showed water guy Chris  Everyone works very good looking no uglies here  waiter very good very professional  menu cheap which look line weren't shocked  favorite things steak display immaculate  Steaks beautiful could eat raw but don't recommend it  Oana Rib eye most popular Kobe American beef  ordered Beef Wellington waiting months for  While waiting beef started something basic Mac n Cheese  Which very good 5 star good but still good  Next main course came out  Let tell Wellington worth every penny every minute spent waited for  Oana's steak literally mouth watering melting all same time  Seriously melted mouths even chewing  love some Elway's Denver but Best steak ever eaten  eaten share steak across USA  made  shitty treatment lounge  gets even better  tried Gordan's famous Sticky Pudding ice cream shaped stick butter brilliant cake served warm unbelievably delicious   topper beautiful painful evening   Once done manager Jenn came over let explain evening Gordan Ramsey style loud honest  She very professional helpful  talking no longer upset  Over all experience probably 4 stars but just can't over different lounge run compared eating area       probably back want take kids  If count calling Jenn ahead time she suggested  If couple hundred bucks spare highly recommend steakhouse just say ate there  way decor alone worth visit  Now Fuck off  Kidding <EOR> If you're looking great steakhouse experience then Gordon Ramsay place   enjoyed service beginning starting meat selection closing desserts   group 8 people waiter very attentive taking into account very crowded evening    Could given five star if meat wasn't overcooked quicker service   But overall great experience <EOR> Not Worth Hype   I took Dad Gordon Ramsay Steak House Las Vegas Paris Hotel Casino March 29 2014 disappointed   I am big fan Hells Kitchen love dishes create finally convinced dad come but expecting negative experience   The ambiance lovely however music loud both hard hear another talk  soon sat down waiter welcomed presented menus bread selection   The bread dry cold hard    bite each couldn't believe gross was  would probably preferred bread Olive Garden place  butter came container sprinkled way heavily Sea Salt Crystals  LARGE Sea Salt Crystals  first complaint bread cold hard he took back gave another set hard dry bread but least luke warm    For appetizer wanted try Potato Yolky but when arrived more Cherry Tomatoes Yolky! tomatoes ripe still yellow some places  but since grilled whole edible    assume  appetizer around $30 relatively small   My Dad ordered Beef Wellington ordered Eggplant Wellington  Wellingtons cooked perfection however no taste all eggplant cooked all way  waiter came back asked everything told eggplant cooked all way hardly any taste  dismay reply each own walked off    Since 5 Star restaurant assumed would salt pepper shakers table but no avail none  asked them advance but waiter never replied    The only reason place gets 3 because dessert  should ordered two but since food meager best shared Sticky Toffee Date Cake    Unbelievably delicious! both informed Sticky Toffee Date Cake received award agree 100 percent    Besides music being loud waiters being rude dry bread over priced food having many healthy fit vegetarian options dessert good yes wine anything tasty    My Dad highly disappointed taste service return customers    If decide come place then order dessert wine  final bill $300 included tip   good place date but okay idea take family  kid friendly snack hour later because still starving! <EOR> I'd rate food 3 5 service 4 kitchen 2    burger good ordered farm burger truffle fries  burger really good  fries $12 mediocre heavy garlic little dry better fries $3  service overall good very friendly  kitchen    40 min burger fries  Gordon would disappointed  bad but $42 tip burger fries    left expecting more  <EOR> My boyfriend just recently celebrated 3 year anniversary 7 25  seated bottom stairs which unfortunate since hoping we'd own secluded private booth upstairs since made reservations ahead time  upside clear view kitchen work close proximity bathrooms    First serve trio bread selections some house made butter sea salt  can't wrong any selection because good  appetizers decided Gnocchi Caesar Salad  gnocchi perfectly cooked just melted your mouth loved came heirloom cherry tomatoes  Caesar Salad thought pretty mediocre nothing special disappointing only scotch egg split between two us  also did enjoy huge whole stalks lettuce rather already pre cut  understand fine dining but since felt time took break whole salad down small bite sized pieces your steak already ready served   For entrees American Kobe Filet believe boyfriend Prime Beef Bone In Rib Eye  Both cooked perfect medium rare remember steak being super tender juicy  can't really speak rib eye since didn't chance taste it   Even though pretty full point couldn't leave dinner without trying Ramsay's signature dessert Sticky Toffee Pudding  kinda skeptical cause pictures Yelp didn't look appetizing but totally changed mind when came out  dessert looked huge especially when waiter poured brown sugar toffee sauce all over top  love brown butter ice cream presented cleverly  simply looking stick butter! No joke dessert made whole dinner worth it  gotta try see yourself  cake moist toffee isn't overpowering sweetness factor  ice cream just added bonus  definitely cheers satisfying meal! <EOR> Truly amazing! husband's birthday  service impeccable food incredible  Ricotta Agnolotti appetizer world steaks cooked perfectly sticky toffee pudding missed! ambiance really nice definitely return! <EOR> This place over price  beef Wellington over cooked super super salty pastry  also ordered steak steak very tender but no seasoning! tastes completely bland no flavor  thinking if trying let realize good quality steak is  But steak no flavor? Come on    The highlight pork belly appetizer service  Pork belly flavorful delicious service top notch  tell trained staffs very well   But honestly if wasn't rush concert day would ask them bring beef Wellington steak back kitchen redo considering price paying  I feel paid lots money pork belly because other two items something worth bringing table  <EOR> Had dinner town decided give favorite TV chef shot  staff did disappoint    Started chilled Maine lobster  Fantastic!  My wife beef Wellington American Waygu ribeye  Wow!!!

He kept pancetta bread loving girl well stocked all night seemed actually really enjoy take pride work   Food amazing perfectly cooked steak delicious truffle fingerling potatoes finished off most ridiculously melty rich yummy sticky toffee pudding   music also great! <EOR> Great service   Steaks good  American Waygu steak  very tender flavourful  Cooked perfection  American Waygu grass fed the  Corn fed latter stage  Good marvelling    I personally found sides overly seasoned liking  However delicious    Highly recommend miso shiitakes bone marrow sauce    The ceased salad also very good   anchovies it  But don't fishy taste     The star would certainly sticky toffee brown butter ice cream   desert best ever had  <EOR> The space really nice open feeling it   Drinks ordered interactive tablet kinda cool   all ingredients listed answered all questions   They come cart all meats show you're ordering   friend bought bone in ribeye beef wellington then split it   put each half wellington over potato puree its own plate but ribeye came its own plate divide ourselves   imagine presentation thing   Everything dreamily delicious   sticky toffee pudding end pretty good  <EOR> Ever since heard almost year ago Gordon Ramsay going open place Vegas just knew put top list   reading all great reviews travel websites expectations high could get  met     unfortunately not  Perhaps bunch f***in donkeys cooking meal? Whatever reason Gordon Ramsey steakhouse underwhelming me  Let start saying service impressive 5 stars  any given time least 2 3 staff waiting table all them outgoing knowledgeable totally professional  highlight ordering process impressive meat carousel  ever wished could see Gordon Ramsays meat   now wheeled tableside cart all its big juicy glory  and waitstaff tell all it  couldn't help but drool just little site carousel filled wonderful cuts meat however already made mind order famous Beef Wellington  Simone hard time deciding order she made meal three side dishes  Truffle Mac Cheese Grilled Asparagus Tempura fried Haricot Verts Skinny Green Beans    While waiting meal treated amazing bread assortment actually favorite part meal bread included Thyme Rosemary Foccacia sticky bun thing filled panchetta another filled shrooms baguette bread walnuts  side some fancy butter speckled some fancy salt  Everything platter good seconds  Next came Beef Wellington informed traditionally cooked medium rare mine actually closer medium well leading unfortunately tough piece tenderloin baked between puff pastry kinda bland mushroom pate  certainly good expected  Simone bit better luck Mac Cheese rich creamy but bit overwhelming truffle mushroom flavor   asparagus good included morel mushrooms also pretty tasty but still average dish  green beans also crunchy tasty served Garlic Aoli but again better   Gordon Ramsay also famous so told Sticky Toffee Bread Pudding dish only really wowed me  bread pudding more best moistest cake may ever eat especially sweet rich when drowned homemade caramel served it  Also served deliciously sweet brown butter ice cream tasty wish could more   great ending only average meal  wanted love Gordon Ramsey all hype but walked away let down surprised biggest let down off all steak  Only 3 stars Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse  <EOR> I meant write review soon home Vegas July 20th but forgot finally    My wife's parents visiting from South Africa never Las Vegas decided treat them dinner Steak because watch shows TV back home    The iPads bar super cool loved innovation  Beef Wellington which world perhaps best beef dish whole life  sticky toffee pudding spectacular    One disappointment ordered bone marrow bones never came meals when alerted waiter he rushed off returned 10 minutes later ice cold bones marrow congealed cold  sent back  <EOR> Dined recently great steak house   hoping perhaps more refined offerings though choices well prepared presented exception oysters  half dozen shucked did show great shucking skills shell pieces each unfortunately passed its time  fried oysters tempura like well presented though again did seem fresh could been  both beef lobster Wellington great choices very hungry  missed some form pate beef Welly although every other aspect perfect  Could dessert  Service top notch great wines glass wine bottle selection adequate Croze Hemitage tasty  <EOR> Had little bit everything here   foie gras great kobe steak very tender but slightly overcooked king crab tasted fresh doesn't seem ever frozen   only disappointment long bone steak 2 which ton fat meat cut off much fat meat which already sliced kitchen   very pleasantly surprised meal trying some other Vegas celebrity chef restaurants  <EOR> As average middle class working person small town Texas opportunities meals come often but Vegas isn't restraint longtime fan Gordon Ramsay trying restaurant during last vacation no brainer thankfully entire experience more lived expectations   Being fan only maybe shot eating next few years came prepared knew exactly wanted before came in   My best friend split wagyu carpaccio  stupidly deliciously  beef literally fell apart mouth only gentle coaxing tongue  hint truffle beef really popped  quail eggs done two ways potato crisps welcome additions but wagyu beef definitely star dish   I ordered beef wellington friend order aged bone in ribeye both fully intending trying each other's  beef wellington delicious tender expected but most noteworthy part dish tenderloin but delicious duxelles surrounding it  Still preparation point   The aged bone in ribeye however  God  Damn   Aged 28 days prime cut gorgeous hint blue cheese funk set taste buds fire  steak umami bomb waiting off friend ate hell it  seasoning absolutely perfect  did actively taste salty but once did ever much passively desire salt  All could taste nuances meat  exactly should be   For sides ordered pureed potatoes creme fraiche sauteed shiitakes ginger  Both side dishes delicious but Gordon Ramsay's steak honoring amazing flavors top notch meat only things table unfinished   Before into A5 kobe beef want mention service really strong  Because ordered wellington meal came little bit later other tables' steak only orders but attended frequently server recommended very tasty merlot enjoy meal   So yeah A5 triple seared kobe beef  single most tender piece steak ever privilege eating just thinking drool  made aged ribeye which phenomenal piece meat would eat again again if health wallet could allow almost seem chewy  steak comes already sliced when arrives table am assuming because steak stupidly tender don't want anyone else's clumsy untrained peasant farmer hands accidentally rip apart while eating it  comes half roasted lime some grated ginger but all unnecessary  Again seasoning perfectly highlighted flavor beef nothing else least  way flavor steak should remain    but bet your ass least tried lime ginger because when Gordon Ramsay suggests something might good must least give shot    All said done most extravagant meal ever consumed costing significant portion yearly pay don't regret single second it  worth every penny paid would gladly again <EOR> Dining celebrity chef branded restaurant blessing curse  Sometimes taste incredible food made chef popular first place  But all often  case Gordon Ramsay Steak  operators rely heavily brand name leave much desired   This expensive $100 per head steakhouse  Avoid if you're ready play price range  Unfortunately steak doesn't live hype  Wagyu Ribcap chewy undercooked  side dishes decent but weren't enough salvage meal  better steak mom pop places off strip  <EOR> I give place one   ordered filet lobster tail   filet supposed medium well   outside cooked correctly but entire middle raw   lobster tail smallest ever seen inch wide three inches long   wasn't provided any drawn butter   husband NY strip bone he ordered steak medium raw   waited more 45 minutes food ordering    Gordon Ramesey needs fire chef restaurant    Worst surf turf ever had  <EOR> I adore Ramsay! when first hear he finally opening restaurant fabulous Las Vegas delighted!  The restaurant itself sits inside Paris hotel fitting entrance serves tunnel into London transforms into bar lounge area  Going further right expansive yet nicely spaced dining room  Above room hangs some type abstract art resembling Ramsay he cooks kitchen  Don't ask explain further still trying figure piece myself   When you're seated placing your order stainless steel cart meat comes rolling by  All prime cuts served restaurant displayed your server thoroughly explains desired cut preparation  Fancy know   must say commend any all servers studies menus  certainly allows diner trust your recommendations   I've twice now both times service superb  ordered French onion soup lobster chorizo start  Both divine  onion soup nice bite end which cuts richness broth  love lobster appetizer keeps wanting more  succulent cooked perfection  could even without chorizo   My main courses consisted bone in rib eye Kobe rib cut beer braised short ribs   boyfriend rib eye marbling near perfection  even amount fat running through deliver most tender cut yet  rib cut server wasn't lying fat content truly made meat rich  able eat whole slab meat sitting  seeing cut less 8 oz thought I'd able go finish it  thought wrong  although delicious just much me   braised short ribs melt your mouth divine  Smothered over mashed potatoes   the creamy combination goodness took surprise   favorite dishes   Last but least dessert  Never leave dining experience without sweet ending  beautiful ending was  sticky toffee pudding  Oh *!!! If used word divine many times already apologize  heaven! Scrumptious glob brown looks more bread  But when cut into sweet moist warmth takes over  Ahhhhhh orgasm your mouth  Truly!  Ok maybe ahead myself  Sorry again  just end saying Ramsay's Steakhouse worth even just pudding  <EOR> Fantastic food great staff  Beef Wellington rib eye ordered fantastic! <EOR> Five star service passionate patient   The bread butter serving before meal great all three flavors   Beef Wellington definitely champion meat even melt mouth love it!

Yasssss  Everything cooked perfection  easily recommendation everyone visiting Vegas need treat! <EOR> Disappointing say least  ordered crab cakes wagyu sliders apps  Lobster Wellington Beef Wellington entrees  Extremely underwhelming meal  sure if because high expectations Ramsey's restaurants because attitude television way seen cook online because Andiamo's night before came here  $250 expected way better  Everything just okay boring  Beef Wellington left much desired regards flavor  Super disappointed  Really wish just Andiamo's again  <EOR> The wife dinner while vacation last year Las Vegas  place incredible! Beef Wellington she steak  Both meals great no long waits food either! little pricey side but well worth think! I'd definitely visit place again the next time vacation Vegas !! <EOR> Have wanting try place ever since opened 1 year ago  reservation 6 15pm  directed lounge where waited 15 minutes seated main room  friends very hungry wondered why reservations if even keep them   steak bone in ribeye  delicious wrong but very fatty   lot fat piece steak cost $60  expected more eatable meat may actually full off meal when actuality still wanting more because all fat steak   Good time try but would again   probably not  <EOR> Atmosphere hostesses dressed skin tight black dresses wait staff wore white button downs tucked ties  attire wasn't favorite but hey didn't wear rock Gordon Ramsay Steak staff! guests' attire quite varied even Las Vegas everything jeans t shirts cocktail attire display    The décor restaurant very unique sleek  enter through cylindrical tube immediately dumped into bar area  Red vibrantly featured throughout restaurant capped off custom humongous light fixture inspired knife strokes Gordon Ramsay  hostess pointed while seating which thought interesting fun fact    As passed through first floor front second floor couldn't help but notice incredibly loud restaurant was  Luckily seated towards back second floor able talk during dinner    Service Wow  Wow  Wow!

For sides potato puree which exactly that fairly runny airy really fantastic just don't expect your traditional mashed potatoes  also cheese truffle mac cheese  extremely rich little underwhelming  I'd much rather passed saved room dessert    Overall definitely worth returning just near future all other seemingly amazing restaurants buffets strip  Without doubt pricier side but else expect? <EOR> The bread course best part meal delicious  Unfortunately all courses ordered served luke warm cold   no proper side option pair Tuna no sides paired yet other options do  chose few sides hoping create full meal main course but both sub par odd fish course as expected but noted no proper options available   eaten many Las Vegas top restaurants many stand local restaurants carefully managed head chef but far below expectations chef famous impeccable execution   suppose if ordered sticky pudding may something enjoyable eat but spending over $300 items served cold decided dessert elsewhere  <EOR> London Paris!

It's just dinner experience  Though place pays homage Ondon located dark corner Paris Hotel  Outside see tall bright red neon light marquee several young thin well dressed attractive young ladies greet seat you dressed a la Robert Palmer Addicted Love music video minus guitars    You through tube representation English iconic subterranean transit tunnel which place acts entry point bar  then walk through seating area which table area booth area which faces open kitchen favorite place sit any restaurant  place dark but easily around  Look above British Jack flag above symbolic sizzling red neon light display   The waiters mainly males wear powder blue dress shirts white cuffs collars  When first addressed them sure follow routing your order maybe delayed  guess place become more amusement ride parting gifts souvenirs sale table  bought hard faux leather table mat sue me  Don't wrong service solid every service person pitching including huge Russian Mafia style wine pouring guy walking table table pouring ever bottle decide order   First offered 6 pieces three different types delicious breads bottle water sparkling water  your drink order handed iPad which may overwhelm unless know want  foresight check list before showed up  remember wine regions types ample price range reasonable $50 absurd $8000 arena  sorry but just don't see add wine worth much unless take female greeters week concubines   The waiters effort selling package meal which includes full course meal prefer whole family buying into individuals discouraged package  meal comprises multiple courses sampling many plates menu souvenir picture desert drink  price $45 person  Which nice reasonable but none that! came own steak plate lady beef wellington   Here's know ordered plentiful delicious worth while  asked medium rare Bone in Rib Eye Beet Root Salad Brussels sprouts bottle least expensive Russian river Pinot Noir Meiomi  desert shared delicious XXXXXX ordered cup coffee  coffee came 3 delightful treats 3 spoons chocolate liquor candy melted top each imprinted letters B C respectably  Amaretto B Bailey's C remember but delightfully delicious  <EOR> I high expectations Steak seen meticulous way Gordon runs kitchen TV   Overall came away disappointed   sentiment started hostesses greeting station continued throughout meal     The hostesses three rude impolite but seemed more interested visiting each other attending guests     Inside dark preponderance red lighting combined Union Jack painted across ceiling gave air sports bar strip club    Once seated served snarky waiter hostesses seemed simply going through drill rather having sincere concern customer      The wine list iPad along glorifying bio Gordon section purchasing Gordon merchandise while dinner menu printed   seemed vain attempt appear tech savvy no real value iPad you couldn't order pay surf Internet even see menu    merchandise offering t shirts shot glasses etc made feel Gordon more concerned emptying wallet serving delightful meal cheapened whole experience   Good grief if choose restaurant $$$$ Yelp don't expect experience reminiscent Stucky's roadside travel center   The high point evening bread plate served before meal   Breads delicious butter    I ordered Lobster Wellington wife Beef Wellington   Sides baked potato mac cheese around $13 passed those   menu stated 45 minute wait Wellington but dishes came much earlier the second high point bread    wife enjoyed meal but lobster tough tough tough   fact each time tried cut into steak knife knife would slide off lobster peel off Wellington crust   Once managed pin piece down saw tear apart   a far cry tender butter smooth lobster experienced competing restaurant night beforehand   During meal service OK but water refills bit slow check ins waiter bit half hearted   So sum no returning no recommend Ramsay Gordon Steak others   food OK but pricey service OK but insincere environment OK did seem classy me   Sorry Gordon but your zeal market yourself think you've lost essence fine dining particular miss  <EOR> Presentation great food great  Price high but welcome Vegas  recommend onion soup  If order baked potato smaller steak big potato  share side dishes other person big  all very good  <EOR> These  best cuts meat exist   Back second  Came anniversary dinner just new year's  Arrived early but seated promptly anyway  hostess tells goofy story traveling through Chunnel Paris London light fixture being Gordon Ramsay's hand movements he prepares beef Wellington signature dish  Right whatever   Actually glad dealt strangeness Brit restaurant inside Paris Hotel  revel fact huge Union Jack painted ceiling above red neon light sculpture  decor funky chains curtains red everywhere British rock music playing  say really worked me  Even though romantic dinner vibe really great  Fun friendly little punk but comfortable classy same time  Impressive  Oh bi level  Always love bi level restaurant   So we're given name server hostess because hella organized  also meet guy helps server basically he pours water lot  All great friendly professional people  put bottle water table THANK that  husband always runs water steals mine  Problem solved   The server brings iPad cocktails some Gordon Ramsay propaganda  Eyeroll bit but works guess  Then real menu ordering drinks  Lots options but course focus steak which brought fancy cart mirrors  American ones Kobe ones we stuck American because Kobe pretty meaningless designation   Definitely neat way actually did help decision   On food Bread gave four different breads fancy fuck  More pastries really  Two absolutely die for bacon croissant but cinnamon roll shape multi grain slice  butter course excellent tangy  keep asking more  probably shouldn't if also ordered steak  But could  you'll want to  Mm good   Appetizers warm foie gras at time ban hadn't lifted California felt compelled order it   portion size really substantial excited served without chips bread  thought only person liked eat straight  However wouldn't say order dish  If feel having foie gras it  Otherwise let be   Steak Beef Wellington American filet mignon husband  no idea beef Wellington was  Now know  Honestly waste filet the cut use it but glad tried it  pureed potatoes come fracking amazing holy crap  Definitely order those side  husband's steak unfortunately cooked medium rather requested medium rare more later but damn cut perfect piece meat  stuff dreams  Seriously   Sides Baked potato truffle blue mac cheese  potato killer  Served bechamel  wish didn't know could put bechamel potato  going fat now  Amazing bacon too  Thick just perfect husband complained wasn't already cut into little pieces though   Mac n cheese wouldn't order again  good if drier kind baked bread crumbs top  Personally really cheesey warm almost soupy mac n cheese   Dessert Sticky toffee pudding obviously  course very good but any better Tea Sympathy  served sauce not traditional creme anglaise caramely also brown butter ice cream looks stick butter cute! best butter ice cream ever easily  I'd order just ice cream next time   Espresso can't praise espresso enough  Probably best ever had seriously! serve cappuccino spoons half ounce liquor inside chocolate coating  Super cute super tasty  wanted eat all them haha  aroma coffee intense beautiful could smell table next knew order no matter full were  very very full   Remember overdone filet? Husband told manager when he came guy just amazing it  He offered whole new steak even though we'd already finished it  declined course but he came back tell he giving 25% off ENTIRE bill! basically free steak then some  amazing  expecting spend ton but ended being cheaper dinners trip  reference full price would $260 before tip but including tax   In short highly recommend coming chowing down BEEF! <EOR> So mom already given review probably right below   Anywayyyy start love Gordon Ramsay gone probably 4 different places west coast north where live each multiple times  Never disappointed  before say next thing half other half think crazy nuts  don't eat meat  Believe plays big factor steakhouse  yes parents did take steakhouse birthday even though don't eat meat  just stopped eating meat few months ago various reasons won't into  Anyway before resturant Gallagher's another steakhouse waitress rushed vegetarian menu she very nice  Steak waitress asked incredibly nice most waiters given nasty looks weird ones something wrong me  But everyone Ramsay worked amazingly well telling everything could worry any meat  loved it!

While waiting bar reservation enjoyed atmosphere vibes course couple delicious cocktails!!!   When seated greeted very upbeat enthusiastic waiter checked regularly made experience even better could hoped for! He knew menu extensively able suggest he thought might he did disappoint    I ordered potato octopus salad sooooooo AMAZING!

Even better restaurant conveniently located inside Paris Hotel where staying didn't far find it! Hopefully we'll able return day tried all other amazing restaurants Las Vegas offer! CHEERS! <EOR> I AM HUGE FAN HELL'S KITCHEN GORDON RAMSEY! coming dream come true  even better everything almost perfect night   My boyfriend 25th birthday celebration when planned come Vegas May Memorial Day weekend  made reservation 2 months advanced!  When first arrived hostess table did wait more 10 minutes  When taken into restaurant decor really modern high end  lights dimmed giving more intimate environment    When seated already knew wanted order watching show reading all reviews Yelp!   knew sure try Beef Wellington  boyfriend didn't want same thing he ordered ribeye  appetizer fried blue point oysters  dessert  sticky toffee pudding it very nice them put birthday candle birthday making dinner more memorable!   Anything put table appetizer bread plate EVERYTHING DELICIOUS DID DISAPPOINT!  The service general great! did find very interesting them use IPAD cocktails  But same time information Gordon Ramsey restaurant  enjoyed when server brought Hell's Kitchen Tasting Menu all steaks cook us  busboy consistently filling water asking if needed anything    Overall would love come back try everything menu and eat beef wellington again!   However won't able afford since pricing little high  Therefore making event possible future dining events more worthy memorable  <EOR> 5 star service beginning end   waiters took great care helped answer all questions incredibly knowledgeable   You're going pay great deal but great meal experience   steaks cooked perfectly drinks great sides amazing! ready drop great deal money but when you're Vegas name Gordon Ramsay attached know you're getting into  <EOR> When asked husband he wanted Vegas first reply beef Wellington Gordon Ramsay steak  came surprise but made reservation excited visit something he wanted do  asked waiter recommendations which he gave saying American rib cap amazing Wellington all used be  ordered each excited some good steak  husband enjoyed beef Wellington but no means wowed  He said okay     rib cap came super hot  ordered medium  half way through mediocre steak more more rare  When waiter came back mentioned little rare he offered them put piece back grill but sat 15 minutes waiting waiter come back point just done  kind disappointing  cut meat nice but much seasoning it  Next time back giada filet which incredible  sad wasn't better experience    <EOR> AMAAAAAAZINGGGG! am little late writing review but better late never  vacation Texas Memorial Day weekend boyfriend literally every Gordon Ramsay restaurant available  Service OUTSTANDING all way around  Hosts super friendly welcoming  Servers knowledgeable attentive  Made reservation 10pm restaurant closes 1030pm  boyfriend i's last stop Vegas trip couldn't better experience  server Adrian beyond amazing definitely made experience much better  cannot even begin explain taste  fresh juicy delicious  No flavor lacking here  server talked into buying special shot King Louie XIII amazing bottle presentation table side  amazing definitely back request Adrian  <EOR> WHERE'S DAMN WELLINGTON?!?!?!  This question ask myself regular basis because Beef Wellington simply favorite dish on earth    Additionally also IMPOSSIBLE find restaurant unless search online before heading every steakhouse UK pub going delightful staple    So many Vegas stories go   I no idea would eating last Friday night come again also no idea would Vegas last Friday night sure hell no idea decision would come 15 minutes into getting home office Friday    Ah America   we off impulse going style    Anyway town 1 night things pretty expensive otherwise place 'to try' list over year   I say year because every time Vegas someone cries broke doesn't want great meal even worse drags buffet gross     I showed solo while waiting friends arrive town dined bar myself course wellington very nice and quite stunning girl behind bar informed would take roughly 45 minutes   I see where may problem some but nothing but time wasn't super super hungry anyway didn't bother bit  time enjoyed couple cocktails picked away assortment delicious bread good conversation other patrons staff    When Wellington arrived impressed plating looked very precise symmetrical  the only thing did really care vegetable portion dish because flavor trust tangy crunchy awesome but because literally 4 cubes size Pico di Gallo cut included literally shouldn't even otherwise mentioned if could fit entire contents half fork full    The wellington great flavor very robust flavoring assortment buttery textures found extremely pleasing  Oh potatoes OK but dish all entree    Would come again? heartbeat Wellington though would kick myself if didn't order every time saw menu next other entrees    Bill 1 around 120 tip booze included  <EOR> Hands down best steak place ever although may biased being fan Gordon Ramsay  huge meat lover begin always felt meh steaks especially almost disliking them even but high expectations place  knew weeks ahead time wanted beef wellington meat cart lug show diners different cuts? Wasn't even phased though found awesome very helpful since boyfriend unsure sizing different cuts  SUPER hyped finally try beef wellington watching seasons upon seasons Hell's Kitchen seeing difficult those chefs cute little beef wellington  Let tell definitely did disappoint  can't even describe sensation put cut meaty goodness into mouth  if all steak endeavors finally reached epiphany all other steaks I'd tried before subpar because waiting moment eating Ramsay's signature beef wellington  true masterpiece  All could moan delicious because speechless  would recommend those come definitely give try   The other less important dishes ordered half dozen oysters wagyu sliders boyfriend American rib cap entree    The oysters alright  huge fan oysters wanted them myself but they're nothing spectacular amazing  Definitely skippable unless course you're dying your aphrodisiac before hitting club  always trying aphrodisiac on   The American wagyu sliders come 2 little burgers perfect split dinner date  delicious! Seasoned cooked perfection  would recommend trying them! cute adorable   My boyfriend really enjoyed rib cap though don't think even compared beef wellington tbh if say myself but again probably biased   The complementary bread also really good! didn't try walnut ? because boyfriend allergic nuts skipped lemon wasn't great but two shaped little muffins amaze  could eat those breads days   One thing little sad don't anything special birthdays besides very briefly say Happy birthday!   Bummer   Very expensive meal dropped almost 3 bills but very worth it  definitely come back next time Vegas try mac n cheese  <EOR> 6 years straight wife Carolyn Potter myself chosen celebrate anniversary restaurant  yet disappointed  year no exception service team Alexis Jonathan truly amazing  course food! WOW! Salad entrees even desert  Perfect!! <EOR> Loved presentation meat selections waiter's assistant Jose! Something felt missing though  wish could say what! almost seemed everything could bigger better placed     Filet Wellington delicious  Beware if order ravioli appetizer little piece    <EOR> I start saying food good   steak cooked perfectly flavorful   love bread serve before meal   prices comparable other restaurants its caliber    expensive   But don't mind paying good meal   service very good server polite helpful   biggest downside ambiance   glad friend date   EXTREMELY LOUD   reminded more dance club techno music off putting decor   looked more cafe four star restaurant   someone transformed many failing restaurants he could sure use some help music decor   Also CRAMPED there   tables all close together   said could barely hear friend loud music all people sitting way close us   Great food but better places Vegas  <EOR> I came try beef wellington  ordered kobe appetizer 34 ounce very good but overated  Main course beef wellington must if your las vegas  tried bone marrow also very good  end night ordered sticky pudding desert delicious  <EOR> I love Chef Ramsay more excited come some bougie dining  Unfortunately expectations met  ordered Rib Cap which very soft pretty good but everything else bad  chimichurri sauce sweet fresh tasting potatoes dry burnt mushrooms super salty! Sorry say probably coming back which bummer but unless sides fixed don't see paying 60+ steak justified  <EOR> I friends expecting great prime rib meal   Everything good until prime rib meal   meat tough overcooked  sent back  staff very helpful very willing provide another steak  received another steak while cutting found very tough  also  decided give getting good prime rib restaurant   If you're looking decent meal sans prime rib restaurant ok but if plan ordering prime rib you're taking your chances <EOR> I ordered 8 oz filet medium well Mac cheese fingerling potatoes! steak melted mouth butter very juicy cooked perfection! beer Seef amazing! Very romantic atmosphere well! <EOR> My husband Las Vegas last week 37th anniversary  enjoy walking around having cocktail two different establishments   third day ended Gordon Ramsay's  sat bar  husband ordered each crown rocks  Which very normal drink  When husband saw bartender preparing them he asked them doubles because small  You'll never guess two double crowns cost us  ahead try guess    Including five dollar tip  tell minute why he only received five dollars  Grand total $65 62 WTF We drinks Bellagio Mon Ami Gabi other places  Never pay bill drinks   Oh yeah bartender only five bucks because asked bill he busy talking two women bar next wait  He wasn't taking order either  <EOR> As Ramsay fan      place heaven however quite hard reservations  lucky walked randomly seat    Before order waitresses bring iPads show pretty photos drinks interesting gifts Ramsay purchase    Fur gras best ever Beef willington even though takes 90 minutes prepare worth it  melted teeth Stick pudding another must have South side drink quite good ask them story behind spoon drink Service amazing  shiitake mushroom potato sides wayyyyyyyyyyy salty  When waitress asked if everything alright didn't want complain  All said good but lil salty side  The minute manager came over replaced salty ones freshly made new plates perfectly seasoned   Super impressive <EOR> So maybe hit bad night because several previous reviews indicate better experiences had  all honesty day before Thanksgiving quite possibly B team manning kitchen A team holiday    It's guess     but regress  stopped hungry without reservation but rather wait reception offered bar table perfect! tall people love bar height tables! Service good BUSY  Now food     I ordered NY strip bone  med rare baked potato  steak overcooked burnt taste     tasted if over seared grill wasn't clean  Really sported bitter off taste  wife ordered same steak but med well  she added lobster tail well  plates arrived obvious lobster raw  She sent back only return rubbery  steak rare  Really rare   to raw side but both hungry ate could  sure but may switched steaks but definitely raw rare rather then med rare request  Potato wine nice glass Merlot very good  When server returned pointed lobster issue wife's steak being raw  check arrives she said took lobster off but left steak bill  did feel quite compensated bad experience but ready paid left  Lot's great steak houses strip maybe hit stinker night but would elsewhere next time  bad  <EOR> My boyfriend wanted dinner best steakhouse Vegas friend recommended restaurant   reading wonderful reviews booked reservation   Dressy attire required NO TANK TOPS ALLOWED!  dressed impress hostesses seemed wanted revoke reservation because extremely snobby towards us   Thankfully server Mathew kind!  Gordon Ramsey give display meats know exactly ordering   surprisingly loud restaurant he explaining meats could barely hear him   ordered Water free!  $9 inexpensive water  Plate assorted bread Complimentary   liked gave variety bread  Beef Wellington most popular meat!  Tender juicy beef served middle puffy bread   first time ever eaten something mouth enjoyed it! Kobe Rib Cap Mmm melts your mouth! Mac N Cheese Bread crumbs top  Grilled Asparagus Good! Bone Marrow boyfriend raved bone marrow but stayed away  Toffee Pudding must order!  repeat must order!  Omg yet another thing tried before mouth stomach thrilled did   Toffee Pudding just melted your mouth taste buds celebrated!  came slice ice cream perfect pairing pudding   just wish more ice cream! <EOR> This second time disappointed especially dropping $300 meal expectations top notch food Gordon Ramsey restaurant  seems quality gone down when year ago Gordon Ramsey needs come whip chefs into shape    The service great but food mediocre  infamous Beef Wellington salty partner couldn't even eat it  cray volcanic salt it  server chef nice enough offer another piece cooked but medium rare overcooked other Yelpers mentioned  also A5 try flavor but little salted outside    Anyways if you're looking cross off eating Hell's Kitchen Beef Wellington off your bucket list then sure eat but don't expect anything spectacular honest  drop your money elsewhere steak  <EOR> The single most incredible dining experience  EVER!

If any managers read review please understand busser only reason considered five star review only reason didn't complain service  He made night very memorable deserved tip more anyone else there  <EOR> I came tonight light dinner drink  big fan restaurants music blasting nightclub  If barely hear bartender probably far worse those sitting regular table    Service slow beginning but picked placed order  drink choice night English Side Car  touch sweet side because apricot jam    They brought obligatory? bread plate which awesomely delicious  rolls soft flavorful  really pinwheels   My dinner evening fois gras  Heavenly  Soft fatty sitting pool duck fat bacon bits brioche strawberry jam   Great contrasts texture flavors   Highly illegal criminal if order serve California  <EOR> The steaks good 5 stars service good 4 stars ambience 1 star owner's attitude minus 5 stars   But other Yelpers stated PLACE LOUD!!!! IF MORE 18 YOUR SEATMATE WONT ABLE HEAR THEM  FORGET COMMUNICATING ACROSS TABLE!! I'm sorry am shouting? mentioned music level several people work I won't mention titles cause guessing they'd fired all whom acknowledged *many* complaints  But said way corporate wants direct quote   other words way Gordon wants doesn't care people made rich think  Guess he really jerk he portrays TV    Aside deafening noise let emphasize again DISCO LEVEL your table nice dinner which course should $268 two  But experience wasn't pleasant  Gordon's seen last dollar he'll us  But course he's demonstrated he could care less  <EOR> My wife enjoyed delicious dinner experience although music loud conversation  My wife enjoyed beet salad cap steak pudding enjoyed shrimp cocktail ahi tuna apple tart  Each course fresh delicious  portions just right very satisfied even took small bag   I couldn't eat every day but meal excellent look forward enjoying meal again  <EOR> We group 22 service awesome but opinion cost should provide better meal  ordered 28oz  Ribeye good but great  ordered soup appetizer okay but took three spoonfuls gone  Better meals LV! <EOR> Excellent food service   Charles excellent food enthusiast request your waiter   celebrated anniversary enjoyed every course  <EOR> I can't say Rib Eye best tasting steak ever probably because two best tasting vodka martinis before meal arrived    I say place cool presentation pretty smooth   Seemed liked servers trying little hard upsale everything increase bill tip   Nice guys however  especially enjoyed cute little hostess made feel right home    Two story place large enough seat many people  Nice bar down below great view second floor    Anyplace charges $45 fish chips way over priced    if extra cash looking stay close home while staying sat Paris hotel then guess would good place try    Be prepared few hundred dollars even two  <EOR> Per chef Ramsay Donkey! If don't it! love place!

Fresh beet dressed excellent sauce  Very refreshing start really made good first impression  SMOKE BEEF TARTATE lavish opening  waiter served dish smoke kept inside cover then opened cover show beef tartate smoked   presentation excellent along yukon chips side  Overall beef tartare good  texture beef tartare great me  flavor playful different layers egg yolks lemon zest onion capers  However slightly underseasoned  yukon chips cold stale did provide crunchy texture needed tartare  Unfortunately dish could better executed opinion  SEARED HUDSON VALLEY FOIE GRAS excellent  goat cheese pop overs great foie gras   Since beef wellington typically takes 45 minutes appetizer definitely kept busy enjoying dinning nice pace  Finally ROASTED BEEF WELLINGTON showed its glory  highly skilled dish nothing seen before  filet steak cooked medium rare designed wrapped middle puffy pastry  impressive dish! Really took breath away details all culinary skills  beef well seasoned mushroom paste ham  just bite dish know why came here! love flavor wellington pastry mushroom beef  However wasn't much fan texture because am more used charred sizzling steak  Overall beef soft but dense bite  also took off guard steak served room temperature  hoping hot piece wellington just came oven beef also hot inside  However realized  way beef wellington made served  really took while over cold beef mind  Nonetheless most skilled steak dish Gordon Ramsay certainly knows perfectly  thing note all beef wellington served medium rare people steak medium well well done fan  Instead try other cut steaks offered steak house  friend ordered bone in NEW YORK STRIP amazing!!!! absolutely excellent piece beef cooked perfectly charred outside  Simply seasoned allow real beef flavor shine  recommend order both beef wellington other prime beef try different steaks here  also ordered some sides steaks  SRIRACHA ROASTED BROCCOLI GINGER GLAZED SHIITAKES both pretty good Asian inspirations  Finally finished dinner PENNA COTTA TOFFEE PUDDING  point buzzed full can't even remember dessert were  am sure fantastic rest meal   So overall gave restaurant 4 star rating despite enjoyed dinner  reason points along way think could better  restaurant spent over $600 meal need perfection need blown away completely! am likely return conserve stomach space just steaks  want focus trying best dish overly stuffed appetizers bread drinks dessert  until next time 4 star me! <EOR> We want eat dinner tomorrow night told can't accommodate 7 people  6 ok else call group sales 8 more  Seriously??? 2 tables but no guarantee they'd together  Wtf <EOR> My order regular filet salad baked potato usual steakhouse fare  steak very good good exactly order salad good but little dry some extra dressing side baked potato huge but mediocre best  Bread choices tasty special drink quite tasty also  Total tab including drink $125 regular filet Kobe steaks push really hard you   restaurant noisy waiter bit pretentious obnoxious seating poor place next kitchen where wait staff literally running front constantly  sister's birthday sunday evening made reservations saturday morning assured would something special also seat great location restaurant  When complained seating told luck table front kitchen it essentially take leave it  folks watch Hell's Kitchen other Gordan Ramsay shows but money place didn't pass    I am certain experienced didn't meet Gordan Ramsay standards  amount spent lots nicer places great food strip  Paris hotel failed here  <EOR> Great steak sides good nice atmosphere didn't try dessert  I dined alone bar which lounge very social atmosphere  bartenders very friendly service great   I bone marrow which huge portion person  comes homemade English muffin bread which very greasy soggy  should some sort toasted grilled bread    The bread selection good too  appetizers salads seemed very expensive $15 20 each salad soup? wanted try foi gras but $25 already decided marrow   I really wanted 24oz ribeye but just much meat 18oz bone in ny strip great! Perfectly cooked just right size   I asparagus which bartender said smaller sides only ate half it  good but nothing extraordinary  full dessert menu didn't look great  loose leaf tea which nice    I would back try another steak some more sides apps  Overall very good steak itself outrageously expensive Vegas  <EOR> I've dreading writing review because don't want Gordon yell me  But if he knew bad service think he would pretty much insane   fair party upstairs 70 people   But amount money paying service incredibly slow   back three section party room made did steak until 10pm while everyone front already finished dessert time   It also extremely slow any kind drink anything needed waiters   The bread basket big variety mac cheese very good   The steak worst but nearly best either   The pre set menu listed sticky toffee pudding very excited because heard ridiculously delicious   Unfortunately came table cheesecake STP  complained because said paying much 70 person party complaint and pointing preset menu then sent sticky toffee pudding every table   but most people did try because already finished cheesecake    The sticky toffee pudding 5 stars itself  best dessert ever life   other places but fabulous butter flavored ice cream comes it   I probably back restaurant dessert every time come Vegas   but won't steak   STK Cosmo better that  <EOR> By far best food dining experience ever had  service exemplary food pitch perfect  chorizo stuffed Maine Lobster fois gras appetizers both delicious but fois gras gods straight Mount Olympus! entreé thoroughly enjoyed beef wellington braised short ribs which both perfection  also ordered macaroni cheese well sriracha broccoli  mac cheese excellent made better earthy truffle crumble top  Sriracha broccoli poached egg excellent flavor but spicy palette food's fault prepared should been   Lomberto waiter attention detail superior  point made mistake using wrong fork I know right! LoL!! wiped fork off set its place table  Lomberto tending table he spotted fork didn't perfect shine he removed brought new fork  Seriously?! kind eye detail average customer?!?! knowledge skill amazing remainder staff   We seated close hot plate something enjoyed because watch activity sous chefs actively engaged throughout meal  I brag meal every know return! <EOR> Amazing just absolutely amazing today husband last night Vegas  ridiculously good must while Vegas  service amazing please crab legs  <EOR> The restaurant very airy but noisy  temperature controlled restaurant locally therefore unable adjust   The wine list very diverse but markedly overpriced   The menu many selections steak also displayed beautifully rolling table server  appetizer section interesting different flavors  onion soup very different thick delicious   The foie gras stupendous!! Only thing lacking sweet sauterne finish amazing texture flavor   The steaks served perfect temperature very flavorful soft juicy   Side dishes substantial without overpricing   Desert menu very nice but full partake any  <EOR> This first time coming here  say restaurant really nice  Its beautiful classy  Lol forgot but delicious  Im glad come restaurant because now say ohh! ate there! Lol cool eatting restaurant owner food network d stuff  cool me  glad aunty chose place eat  <EOR> I took girlfriend anniversary both really good experience     The food expensive but If willing pay price worth it!  Talk best steaks ever!  service really amazing too!  When first decide start ordering waitress brought table all different kinds steaks she through description each every one   no idea many different cuts meats ones did know didn't realize made them up    They very nice wine selection which girlfriend picked since she wine o both enjoyed very much  steaks amazing bread given also really good  sides choose really recommend mac cheese  also taters but seems rather bland    We both great experience plan coming back  when want good steak enjoyable experience  <EOR> On last trip vegas booked 4 30 reservation week ahead time able in! also large group 11 actually kept changing amount ppl but still pretty accommodating fitting group in  plate different types bread snack before food arrives  favourite fig pinwheel looking bread  Mmm wish asked more could take them go!  Most people table beef wellington signature dish! also ordered side mac cheese  beef wellington for 1 comes 8oz fillet which opinion actually really filling without sides! If beef wellington for 2 bit cheaper price 2 people but 6oz fillet if don't mind eating less  probably next time! Anyways beef wellington reallyyy good something never before  puff pastry outside wasn't soggy still bit flaky outside  proportion puff pastry pate also point  fillet super tender cut butter! only small complaint fillet cooked really rare which some people may but prefer more medium rare side  Still really good   The mac cheese delicious  Super rich super cheesy truffle oil really strong recommend splitting side between few people because really fill up!  Overall all really good time! would add your list eat if want something else besides buffet vegas! <EOR> I'm giving establishment 3 stars two reasons     First unbelievably high prices  used seeing high prices Las Vegas but place takes cake    Basic salads $ 20 00 drinks $15 00 steaks range $53 00  $153 00 more      second reason because unfriendly server bar tender behind counter picture follow      single male suppose didn't represent large enough ticket large enough breasts hence very cold mildly rude treatment    know hiring good people difficult but bar place need your friendliest most personable players   If singles welcome perhaps could put sign states keeping personality owner?   <EOR> As close perfection could ever reach experience Gordon Ramsay  I start off explaining 4 star review Food beyond perfection perfectly executed flavors incredible even coffee top notch!  Service excellent every way  I think overall tasting menu truly only way 5 course meal worth every penny along folded menu signed photo Gordon take home treasure event  My only complaint overall big deal feel tables bit close together while dinner took almost full 2 hours almost felt bit rushed   Make reservation did because want great experience  I wouldn't hesitate recommend friend celebrate special event  hope experience again lifetime  <EOR> This third time coming disappointed  Service always good but food much  decided try American rib cap tasted applebees steak salty no flavor  Also side dishes salty too  girlfriend beef wellington disappointed too  Drinks good but price recommend somewhere else  <EOR> Oh man sticky toffee pudding alone worth it  Dont regret yourself missing out  absolutely delicious    If you're perfectly cooked steak  Try royal long bone aka tomahawk steak  Medium rare way go  Nom nom nom <EOR> Be sure reservations   place incredible   finally able cross off bookmark   wanting eat Ramsay's steakhouse longest now   last few trips Vegas wasn't able experience knew would finally perfect opportunity   Great company great steak all could ask for   whole experience marvelous really impressed amazed Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse sure   We arrived time greeted seated lovely host   restaurant simple magnificent   Located Paris Las Vegas Hotel place wonderful view even better tasting food   glanced menu before picking two blueberries something can't remember name but delicious   didn't drink much Vegas much people's surprise but definitely fair share evening     We both ordered American Rib Cap cooked medium rare other medium well   goodness steak oozing juices deliciousness   mouth became even more watery first bite   texture outstanding flavor incredibly mouth watering   definitely highlight whole trip   left satisfied   honest full but still wanted another bite   Thats amazing was   guess finally Hell's Kitchen experience   fair more heaven hell     Overall service amazing   did great job chef waiter host place provided excellent service us   steaks awesomely well prepared could asked better experience   Seriously give place try   Yes its bit pricier side but its Vegas   Why waste money slots when enjoy great culinary experience  <EOR> The American rib cap good everyone says   And sticky toffee pudding butter ice cream even better!

He helpful mother walks cane  assisting chair escorting through restaurant   He answered all questions patiently made feel welcome    I impressed  Maybe could offer senior night turn down music little? <EOR> First all wagyu slider great  28 day steak  did that  However recommended oscar style steak which 3 pieces lobster meat some overly salty creamy sauce top steak bunch asparagus under steak  Unfortunately lobsters sauce ruined steak! super salty way rich wanted vomit  throw away last piece lobster meat    Such shame throwing away lobsters such waste  worst part oscar style cost $54 extra  steak itself cost $61  walked restaurant feeling duped!  BIG TIME! Very unsatisfied  Oh steak itself mediocre  90 day steak Miller's Guild Seattle tasted divine    without any sauce topping oscar style!!     OMG duped!! <EOR> I think all Gordon Ramsay restaurants Vegas  $$$$ name GR expecting fine dining experience  Guess expectations little high    We made reservations party 5 few weeks advance  hostess walked table gave option taking stairs elevator     Immediately knew would dining main room slightly annoyed  Why would want visit upscale steakhouse beautiful ambiance shoved upstairs side room? reasons why chose visit GR Steak because beautiful interior main dining room looked    Annoying    SERVICE Needs work all around  hostess asked if celebrating anything special  friends told hostess hubby celebrating anniversary  given menus hostess awkwardly chatted few minutes before another guy came around corner deliver menus  few minutes server finally arrived drink menu iPad introduced himself  He congratulated anniversary nice gave some time peruse menu  ordered drinks appetizers server brought infamous meat cart explained all cuts meat  found odd when given menus introduced meat cart no ever cared state Beef Wellington dish would take 45 minutes prepare    didn't find tidbit information until ordering food  should probably inform diners when give menus when presenting meat cart  guess does say somewhere menu but really reads when socializing company? Also $$$$ should dropping knowledge diners   Our bread plates still sitting table when entrees arrived  kind awkward try room no room table  end meal empty plates sat awhile before anyone came clear them  would say small details need work  Also end meal server wished happy anniversary again but nothing else  Most places even upscale Morimoto Joel Robuchon etc  offer some type celebratory dessert favor     something? guess question why ask then?   BEEF WELLINGTON 45 minute Beef Wellington SUCH letdown  First ordered Wellington 1 friends ordered Beef Wellington 2  Somehow meal looked smaller mine! even questioned staff portion size insisted given correct plates  yourself favor don't order 2  order plates individually  Upon cutting into wellington entire shell completely fell off  meat tender but overall dish tasteless under seasoned  could differentiate between different components wellington  dimensional lacking any type texture  puree root vegetables also lacked seasoning  expect $57    AMERICAN EYE husband American Eye 8 oz  Wagyu wrapped pork phenomenal  actually switched plates halfway through meal  Perfectly cooked medium pork wrapped around gluttonously good    SIDES shared Spinach Potato Puree Cauliflower Mac Cheese Brussel Sprouts  don't truffle mac cheese no go  Cauliflower Brussel Spouts good  both crunchy bite nice char  ordered spinach gratinéed parmesan cheese  definitely good choice pair steak  am surprised charge $7 steak sauces  am paying $$$$ meal you're going upcharge SAUCE?

Mind customer service great defiantly treat royalty but worth hefty price tag? drinks probably only good thing entire meal  appetizers also good but it  steak alright don't wrong did finish but wasn't heaven every single time bit into it  Such shame because lot people think highly guy cooking nothing world shame  restaurant itself really nice course service exceptional but expected lot more food  <EOR> Why restaurants offer suggest reservations then when arrive time wait 40 minutes! Unacceptable me  restaurant manager horrible when complained he definitely people person didn't care wait  found rude arrogant reason spend $$$ there  waiter other staff however wonderful food good well service  cost meal worth aggravation poorly run management  many other nice places eat enjoy  <EOR> Big fan Gordon Ramsay  visited steak house three times since opened  Always pleasure would definitely return   Modern decor good ambiance  Always seems packed would highly recommend making reservations ahead time  Never wait very long hostesses seemed point  Good customer service great bread choices    Have tried 3 4 all appetizers menu very pleased  yellowtail starter favorite   The Beef Wellington Fish Chips Fisherman's Stew all good entree choices  Highly recommended   The Sticky Toffe Pudding die for! Must try if sweet desserts  Would come back just alone  <EOR> The hubs ate last night   8 45 reservations via Open Table seated promptly   noise level music annoying luckily seated downstairs dining room able converse without much trouble but overly loud music does detract dining experience   server Matthew assistant Sean wonderful great service guys both very friendly knowledgeable menu   Food very good filet mignon cooked perfectly   shared house salad which nothing special but bread butter presentation wonderful   Shared tempura green beans which delicious also loaded baked potato gruyere bechamel sauce heavenly!  Hubs small bone ribeye which tasty cooked perfectly unfortunately chewy   also ordered two side sauces house steak sauce very good Worcestershire Demi glacé overly salty   can't even say complained ribeye sauce merely mentioned Matthew   high end restaurant should two items removed bill   Matthew also came back told Chef agreed sauce salty   Good know he kept Chef informed he took time follow us   Matthew also brought complimentary Sticky Toffee pudding dessert    to die for!  Especially caramel ice cream   definitely eat again request Matthew server   give restaurant only 4 stars mainly because noise level because mishap steak sauce   just happens sometimes cut meat isn't tender should be   seasoning temperature both steaks spot on  <EOR> I can't say enough great things place  worried would all hype because celebrity chef's name attached but wrong  moment arrived received most excellent attention ever experienced  waitress later found just returned leave three days ago professional knowledgeable helpful  food fantastic everything perfectly cooked order even bread delicious  can't wait return! <EOR> Because wonderful Hell's Kitchen cooking lesson Chef Ramsey bucket list  Unfortunately man very busy man going restaurant closest thing got    Service definitely lost star because service  reservation 10 00pm 9 45pm weren't ready until 10 20pm  waited bar area until boyfriend ask table  hostess followed back bar laughed said oh thought just didn't know waiting   boyfriend looked each other um okay? look  waiter also very good  only person liked lot server Devon  He helped take pictures refilled water checked us    Food A MA ZING  obviously restaurant Vegas prices pretty expensive but main entrees bomb! ordered King Crab legs even though 4 pieces really fills up  also asparagus but didn't taste good ones other restaurants  Same mash potatoes    I'd recommend place!

About 30 minutes later entrees arrived  Decent presentation but beef wellington's plate looked bit lonely  friend shared beef wellington 2 which $3 cheaper ordering alone  friend ordered own smaller piece cut into two  Now beef done medium rare no choice but overly cooked  Ours cooked perfectly but pate salty! felt if getting taste ocean each bite  tried just eat meat cooked perfectly tender waste $50 if didn't eat it!

He's right place pretty much nothing English two story glass box but did welcome upon approaching Host desk greeted half dozen Identical 6 foot tall brunettes same little black dress  thought I'd wandered onto Robert Palmer video set! lf haven't heard betta ax somebody!   then escorted upstairs rail side table overlooking bar entrance areas well spectacular  chandelier type lighting fixture  Very well appointed room tables   WHEN GO started gnocchi fried oysters  Both very good oysters being favorite  Perfectly crisp juicy same time could three plates those very happy  also filet which best ever few steaks  usually order rib eye Porterhouse but advised try filet outstanding server Mathew  he right! Perfect medium rare juicy flavorful last bite incredible  Wifey Wellington which very good but found sauce little salty philo didn't stand very well  Good flavor meat perfectly done  also toffee bread pudding if could change thing meal would that  much bread pudding fan but Matthew's home run filet suggestion followed lead one  Very sweet bread saturated point nearly being mush  going apple tart next time my wife wins again!

Food fine but no more impressive hundred other places Vegas  don't even remember  some kind petite filet potato some kind greens signature cocktails  meal forgettable!  Worse sat way back 2 top near kitchen  felt cramped bustling sitting sidewalk bistro France   only really dark airless corner bowels fake Eiffel Tower   This place heavy shtick light everything else  Save your money better steak Mr  Lucky's Hard Rock Hotel  seven dollars!!!!!!! <EOR> Came birthday very high expectations considering ''Chef'' pricey menu  beef filet American capp filet  sides mashed potatoes mac cheese  filet WAY salty could barely eat it  waiter did offer re done but waiting almost hour food hungry wait another knows long  sides EXCELLENT however  birthday waiter brought sticky toffee pudding I did order dessert amazing but surprise charged it    <EOR> Love place!  We came friend's suggestion since she watches Hell's Kitchen   but place looked nice enough pictures website intrigued     While waiting table seat bar area lo behold sitting next but only Gordon Ramsay!  He super nice which took surprise even took picture us   Drinks great very stiff   ordered couple dirty martinis   Once seated served complimentary bread butter   Great variety bread options   started off smoked beef tartare   probably little smoked tasting taste but bad    For entree ordered Kobe American skirt medium rare   amazing tender!  place gets steak right!!  For desert ordered sticky toffee pudding which really great everyone says     All all great experience   reservations 9 don't think left until 12 30 a m  but experience really flew since having such great time   Fantastic service too! <EOR> Gordon Ramsay you've set awesome establishment!   The food bomb com The service bomb com The ambience bomb com And did mention food bomb com?   Your Beef Wellington lived hype! Awesome! <EOR> My new favorite steak house  entire meal service fantastic   The filet mignon cooked perfection  steak better Ruth Chris Bern's Charley's Fleming    Gordon please come Tampa   If room dessert sticky toffee pudding  die for!  I'm glad came dine evening   Highly recommend  Skip Mesa Grill Old Homestead run Gordon Ramsey  <EOR> I gave place four stars because food   would received 5 stars   gave four stars two reasons   Allow explain 1  magnum wine wanted bring us   specifically asked over phone corkage fee if higher because bottle bigger   assured not   very pleased this   Only when told since equivalent 3 5 bottles would pay four corkage fees grand total $140   Now if your policy fine   But please your staff tell patrons over phone case   When person came tell told he'd right assumed he would   Well bill included $140 fee   eventually did right only charged but would expect place caliber mistakes   mean know $140 four bottles decent wine steakhouse still steal but principle inconsistency bothered me   2  decor vibe place great!  Very hip   LOVE Union Jack roof music   BUT     if slightly larger party we 7 might stick stuffy typical steakhouse room   disappointed   wanted ask if could moved but party being complacent shut mouth   LOL  Just aware if trying because typical steakhouse but group might stuck there   If don't want would tell them when reservation     Having said food fantastic waiter bus boy service  agree commemorative autographed Ramsay prix fixe thing little tacky   fried blue point oysters fantastic porterhouse two although little cold    mac cheese also great but anything truffle oil gets vote   people table famous beef wellington impressed sticky toffee pudding amazing  Oh martini olive bacon added blue cheese olive it might another cheese it can't remember    bartender told but forget    Point delicious    I would definitely give Ramsay Steak try if Vegas   probably again just  smaller party  <EOR> It's ok steak ordered prime rib good ofcourse $$$ but service great mixed orders just cancelled salad because order aware? he forget? Definitely first last restaurant  <EOR> Late Review husband dined September 15  made reservation night before good thing did  establishment beautiful organized clean! wouldn't expect Gordon Ramsay? seated exact time reservation  staff all professional uniformed nicely  service quick most part entrée took little longer then anticipated however entire restaurant booked  food great although couldn't finish portion sizes pretty good amount mention did order lot  Would dine again? Absolutely! <EOR> Made reservation weird time just but worth it  Beef Wellington duh worth $$  Caesar salad best ever had  Waiters funny love service 45 mins wait beef Wellington felt nothing  Finished dining within 2 hours  definitely return miss food already <EOR> We called prior reservation ask children's options  told children's menu but chef options children every night  When seated few days later asked waiter children's options  He said no options children but petit filet good choice at $50+  might say should brought 10 year old level restaurant but why called before making reservation   In end steaks just okay service just okay  Certainly should expect Gordon Ramsay any restaurant where your check nears $400 3 people  <EOR> Unfortunately husband never even chance eat here  called 5 days ahead reservation Saturday told restaurant booked  understandable waited little late call last minute trip Strip  When Paris hotel decided walk past restaurant check out  husband culinary school impressed Gordon Ramsey's high standards service  line happened when outside restaurant looking in  couple walked past hostess stand outside asked them if they'd reservations eat night Saturday when couple didn't even approach stand  such high standards did expect denied reservation when obviously space available evidenced hostess asking passers eat there! Left bad taste mouths husband very disappointed  Won't going Ramsey establishment any time soon  Ate Hubert Keller's Burger Bar instead  <EOR> This absolutley incredible ! ordered famous beef wellington amazing  steakhouse high class worth every penny  wrong anything menu  thing point out  If waiter asked sparkling still water say neither because said still thinking going free   nope ! charged 18 dollars water dont tell much is  But besides small miscommunication steakhouse very good  300 dollars four person family eat splurge night  But if win big casino would definitely recommend Gordon Ramsay steak  <EOR> We first seated 2 top top stairs next bussing station where every meal comes kitchen   waited 10 15 minutes service asked reseated   kindly reseated next wine closet back corner downstairs   Every time needed serve bottle lower priced wine high priced wine stored elsewhere somebody came put butt face opened closet wine out   really closet  double deep fancy glass door case way   Anyway waited another 10 15 minutes service   ordered tasting menu wine pairing  $220 pop   First few courses mediocre   Beef Wellington awesome dessert awesome   Overall  worth price   Good but great   certainly $500 dinner two given service complete lack ambience  <EOR> Food 5 5 Service 5 5 Cleanliness 5 5 Decor Style 5 5  I throughly enjoyed Beef Wellington  ordered Hell's Kitchen Tasting menu all superb  baked potato sampled buddies best baked potato ever had! Everything lived high dollar restaurant hype thank goodness!

Having foodgasm!!! OMG! <EOR> I feel all people should particularly harsh place   yet are   Let explain myself bit   When dealing fancy restaurant celebrity chef always important remain skeptical   many celebrity chefs even if don't open successful restaurant survives based off name recognition alone which feel crime   skepticism doubly Gordon Ramsay because only does he television show where he help fix failing restaurants but lot times show he focuses message simple menus   This does fancy pants restaurant hypocrisy necessarily he dealing mainly small family run places show   when someone works way level success allowed bit excess restaurants now again   let clear those 5 stars sitting automatic based off name recognition   contrary place probably work harder earn review most other restaurants would   So yes ourselves restaurant enough frou frou roll your eyes bit   concept a tunnel leading Paris London cool until think wanky is   neon art sculpture symbolizes Gordon's hands he prepares Beef Wellington also induces sort  cool   and stupid response me   also Ferris wheel meat wheel around even if likely less pretentious ways presenting that   But really where criticism must end   Service spectacular entire night   lucky enough seated right kitchen ready access anyone passing but honestly no point night did really need flag someone down   always someone top table refilling water wine checking quality food etc   Every staff member met friendly relaxed made experience all more welcoming   And afraid running words best start into food portion itself Wine List am wine snob  know little wine general only ever order nice dinners this   applaud whoever thought put wine list iPad would could search vineyard name wine type grape  task bit less daunting might otherwise  Bread server over many different varieties bread offered and many course mean 3    couldn't tell all but confirm all good accompanied by   sigh   butter volcanic sea salt   I mean good combination but   we don't fancy Gordon  Salad mine wife's   hard blown away salad   and neither but doesn't mean bad salad  Props waiter being able accurately describe all components before ordered though  Beef Wellington to  famous dish right?

Anyway try such fan Gordon Ramsey! worth shot time try! <EOR> Walked 5 30 hoping grab early table fiance   told nothing available  asked if wait list cancellations missed reservations told very arrogant manor fully committed tonight tomorrow night well try eat bar    We agreed made way in    madhouse  least half dozen other parties walking around circling vultures watching people eat judging long would be  Even if idea playing musical chairs table defiantly wouldn't want hassled entire time eating others doing same  The worst part dining room half empty  joke   The staff spoke extremely rude bar area most disorganized places seen vegas  vibe would describe sheer panic   I used lot respect Chef Ramsey    he talks lot quality food service but before could even try food service left bad taste mouth  sure give place another try proper reservation but now when people ask place somewhere avoid  <EOR> Fabulous!! bread prosciutto it    pancetta? way even bread fantastic  bone in ribeye loaded baked potato both which divine  high expectations Ramsay definitely met  biggest highlights Vegas trip! <EOR> 1 star Gordon Ramsay just because love show 1 star runner busboy table   Unlike other steakhouses hostesses more younger chic side versus usual professional looking hostesses other steakhouses   When walked look party's table hostess just let without asking if needed help finding party   waited good 10+ minutes before server brought drink menu 10 minutes later food menu   server friendly professional introducing different types meats excited try bone in ribeye lobster tail infamous beef Wellington    So why 3 stars We waited 40 minutes entrees arrive because beef Wellington takes 40 minutes those ordered ribeye starving  The lobster tail more prawn smallllll! Probably halves 1 4 lb lobster   upside fresh delish  My ribeye much tendon jaw hurts chewing  The ribeye wasn't flavorful would expect dry age steaks like    The fats ribeye wasn't seared rendered well enough lukewarm although cooked perfectly medium So chewy point decided talk very detailed runner busboy very attentive steak   told all tendons steak he back talked server server NEVER CAME TABLE see If he could anything steak least show some concerns $$$ steak  The fingerling potatoes creamed spinach good but didn't finish because busboy assumed finished just took plates away    just very unfortunate first experience gordon ramsay restaurant ended much less expected I'd definitely usual steakhouses joes forum shop SW steakhouse future  <EOR> We read lot negative reviews restaurant but thought surely Gordon Ramsay would name anything less superb  could pass opportunity try Gordon Ramsey's Beef Wellington! Boy let down! cocktails great that's stars allowed atmosphere very nice that's other star   service mediocre waiter nice but seemed overly rehearsed which came across unauthentic  started chilled crab cake salad which fell apart soon waiter sat down table  otherwise beautiful plate but overall bit flat flavor memorable  entrees ordered beef Wellington two  wrapped tightly puffed pastry fell off steak  meat good great  certainly no chef but husband both agreed made better beef Wellington home  positive note sauce depth flavor potato purée very smooth delicious  Otherwise disappointed since very much looking forward experience!! Overall would recommend restaurant would visit again  <EOR> Being fan Hell's Kitchen see good Chef Ramsey's food because show sometimes mouth water   All say GOD DAMN CHEF RAMSEY!!!!!  We Gordon Ramsey Steak Paris thinking going long wait   all   recommend reservation but also eat lounge still access same menu   Let's start service   host point   Never once did drinks low she literally beckon call place packed  A+  Food off chain   ordered Bone ribeye Beef Wellington two side Mac Cheese   wellingtons perfect lived expectation see Hell's Kitchen   bone ribeye juicy cooked perfectly medium    took star Mac Cheese because blue cheese overpowering   seasoned well but leaves more desired if your real cheese head   We stuffed even try desert   Overall food experience fantastic  <EOR> As big fan Gordon Ramsay's shows recipes techniques very underwhelmed    The restaurant beautiful but music very loud didn't seem match atmosphere    For food mother shared Caesar salad appetizer Beef Wellington entrees which come bone marrow add on finished sharing sticky toffee pudding cake brown butter ice cream   Now fan Gordon Ramsay years  Watching reality shows cooking recipe videos recreating recipes mastering techniques  definitely say recipes Gordon's made much much better dinner   The Caesar salad overpriced just ok   salad big whoop  little foccacia quail egg most memorable thing it   The Beef Wellington came root vegetable puree some roasted vegetables side  some literally mean 4 tiny cubes  puree tasted bland mashed potatoes  Wellington cut awkwardly mother's plate much larger piece while mine noticeably smaller she offered big piece because she doesn't eat much  other Yelpers said phyllo dough mushroom crust fairly soggy flavorless fell apart first cut in  meat very tender good quality but also under seasoned    The bone marrow interesting first time trying marrow  apparently brushed sauce topped salsa verde but all tasted beefy flavor marrow  really unable judge against anything but good  Only 2 tablespoons marrow though  Thought would more   The dessert best part meal  Absolutely perfect  sticky toffee pudding cake brown butter ice cream most memorable course night   Overall glad now say eaten Gordon Ramsay restaurant  However  all say without tarnishing Mr  Ramsay's exalted name  <EOR> https s3 media1 ak yelpcdn com photo

Explaining all different steaks offered menu each taste well cooked  very helpful!   For starters served three different types bread  including truffles   oh Goodness devine! also ordered Kobe beef sliders must say juiciest slider ever tasted  kobe beef extremely tender full flavor  Melted mouths!

Thank Gordon great time  dining again soon! <EOR> Great restaurant delirious butter coma experience   Walked quite sure which way which loved it   bread plate fantastic appreciated variety   beef wellington which met expectations seafood curry soup which totally surpassed expectations fisherman's grill mixed seasonal seafood which unfortunately bit let down   finished sticky toffee pudding which delightfully accompanied brown butter ice cream initially frightfully though actually stick butter     I regret trying more appetizers which most interesting part menu but guess wait next time along lobster wellington can't decide if sounds appealing but leaning towards yes!  The tasting menus seems rip off unless your yourself nobody your table share steal bites from  <EOR> Be sure reservation!

If don't ask don't confirmation code just precautionary measure any reservation   The second reservation little bit better still needs work professional phone etiquette though   Same thing first reservation but nicer    put hold 5 minutes before anything happened   Only reservation available 9 pm  When guest running late reservations seated 20 minutes reservation time   first because whenever reservations any restaurant usually sat time maybe 5 minutes later but definitely 20 minutes later   Anyways actual dining experience   service everywhere   server greeted forgot give actual dinner menu but instead gave ipad alcoholic beverages then ran around majority time   bus runner asking drink orders server took gave dinner menus   server came back bit later take orders which pretty sure he forgot menus first place    server took menu bus person came roll away model all different cuts beef   Next time suggest model cuts beef should brought before taking order    maybe it'd convince order kobe beef filet mignon regular filet mignon   Bread served 20 minutes guest ordered right bread served appetizers came out    The appetizer half dozen raw oysters   oysters definitely fresh incredibly sweet   Wish type oysters serving bigger but those type oysters served meant small   really delicious definitely refreshing   A little while longer entrees came short ribs aged beef filet mignon kobe beef filet mignon   short ribs amazing mash potatoes bokchoy sauce   short ribs really tender but mash potatoes beyond amazing!!  filet mignon just filet mignon house sauce some garnish  hoping filet mignon bit more Ramsay Flare but didn't   wish ordered sides but thankfully guest's mash potatoes it   regret just using money toward regular filet mignon kobe beef filet mignon because honestly better filet mignons   Overall mash potatoes best dishes   For dessert sticky toffee pudding which blew mind away     toffee ice cream shaped stick butter which thought incredibly cute   toffee pudding similar very porous cake warm caramel toffee sauce poured onto it   cake soaked sauce which made bit soft soggy same time somehow creating  very nice texture   honestly wished could just eat scoops ice cream   cake bit sweet tastes but still delicious nevertheless   Wish ice cream just top cake just simpler way   Overall felt restaurant didn't live name Gordon Ramsay   feel very neutral whether recommend not   If you're fan am Mr  Ramsay then all means but bit disappointed night    Despite always telling contestants guests waiting food hell's kitchen own restaurant made wait   very iffy trying again but time kobe beef filet mignon but pretty sure Ramsay fan side try again more time   only excuse give restaurant they're new no set system place yet  <EOR> My wife chose Gordon Ramsay steak 12 year anniversary dinner   Overall server great ambiance great but  it  terribly disappointed taste but think made worse seemed some reason both plates seemed under temperature  ordered beef Wellington wife ordered prime beef fillet  While wife's tasted great did seem under temperature  beef Wellington tasted ok but sending back once temperature came back same way  next morning became SICK only think due this   all all can't say would recommend place but STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING amazing!!Also order risotto!! paid market price which 65 00!!!!!!! worth due fact size coffee cup 2 scallops tasted ok but felt eating sand due crunching mouth!

I decided dine alone evening because although love eating all types food wanted dine somewhere tonight without boyfriends friends complaining portion sizes prices  When dining alone servers usually try seat bar cramped between parties  sat near table four seemed looking menu frustration  Within minutes each left  LOL     After resetting table sat four male diners next me  talking Gordon Ramsey's background foreign language loud couldn't hear myself think! didn't really fault them because wouldn't surprised if couldn't hear each other over loud music  Rather ruin own night politely asked moved very opposite side them  could chat hearts content could dine solace  Everyone happy!  My server good looking guy Dapper Dan slicked hairstyle side part  disappointed service  don't when someone doesn't eye contact when speak although he wasn't rude he just wasn't moment  received better service Denny's expected GR just passionate front house operations food    THE FOOD  Yes enjoyed every bite signature Roasted Beef Wellington could used ladle more sauce heavenly Mac Cheese thankfully saturated truffle flavor  managed half way through sticky toffee pudding before stomach put boxing gloves said   WANT PIECE ME?! decided Mac Cheese dessert needed container    My server brought check surprisingly he chose particular time eye contact smile engaging  asked delicious flavor six pieces glazed vegetables accompanied Beef Wellington  He didn't seem understand rephrased he said OH   Parsnip  didn't want press issue anymore because realized he didn't know but mean  awesome server honest say don't know kitchen ask! 2015 average diner vast culinary knowledge can't underestimate them food industry did 1980's  know parsnip type root vegetable but obviously glaze herb seasoning complimented it  Sighhhhh  still gave very good tip  He probably banking good looks instead brain tips but he's lucky acknowledge he must living well  Maybe generational thing where fine dining lost art  Perhaps people feel fine dining way segregating dividing amongst classes   Establishments now want money many  EVEN if means show flip flops   Aside loud club music acceptable underdressed attire non engaging servers managed befriend 4 people two different tables  even passed Mac Cheese over could try it  Why not? might well keep trend going   They even invited some drinks them  passed continued solo date night comedy show    Overall GR worth returning   for food course! <EOR> Husband didn't cut steak personal preference he also asked extra seasoning which he didn't  The chicken little dry but still good  My Brussels sprouts cane cold first time but immediately fixed which great  The mashed potatoes PHENOMENAL <EOR> Had much anticipated dinner Gordon Ramsay Steak Las Vegas  Left bit disappointed  Treated niece supposed unforgettable meal so  She first ordered Baby Beet Salad very good  Next she ordered off menu item called Triple Seafood Delight 2 scallops lobster tail king crab   $95 Scallops great Lobster ok but tiny King Crab terrible!

Now let's see tasting menu most expensive $155 two glasses red wine $20 each half dozen oyster bone marrow did all add $450?  Apparently two tasting menus ordered   know clearly said tasting menu because wanted try other items   decided bring Dennis because he very polite attentive   paid bill anyway   lesson double check your order before waiter leaves your table     Would back?  Maybe try steak    should ordered  <EOR> I excellent meal here  am only giving three stars solely based value  Compared other steak houses serving dry aged USDA prime beef bit more taste isn't discernibly better    I started off pork belly appetizer if find yourself must  fish top three things aver eaten  perfectly cooked may cliche but melts your mouth    For main course order rib eye cap medium rare course  cooked perfection however $65 8oz great deal  right best steaks but didn't blow them away  friend shared two sides Mac n cheese roasted potatoes  potatoes nothing write home about  Mac n cheese other hand quite delicious  highly recommend especially if only side    The service good but seemed irritated didn't order drinks  also didn't charged $6 Diet Coke  spending over $100 give break  All all delicious meal fun place try  If ever back Vegas though think try Adam perry Lang restaurant though  <EOR> Went Gordon Ramsay buddy Vegas trip   nestled Paris inside looks REALLY cool   say service top notch   skirt steak beef wellington   sides some mushrooms puree   really liked everything it   star knock beef wellington  because told must   both felt much meat personally thought crust slightly soggier side   hoping crust more crispy flaky   sauce accompanying decent tho   I'd still come back due amazing staff  <EOR> glad did baby words husband said leaving Paris celebrating anniversary here  did order appetizers but enjoyed variety breads offered us  wine selection significant any cocktail would like  husband Beef Wellington bone in rib eye  Both cooked perfection  ordered steak medium plus  very tender perfectly seasoned  think best steak had!The beef Wellington comes medium rare cut butter knife! definitely exceeded expectations  fingerling potatoes bit garlicky but Mac Cheese excellent  ordered coffee desert event! coffee made French press comes ABC spoons  spoons covered chocolate each contains liquor     Amaretto Baileys Cordial raspberry   try Sticky Toffee Pudding cake brown butter ice cream reading reviews  All say Wow!! delicious!! definitely shared  server Lomberto Ryan helping  extremely attentive! Whatever wanted Lomberto would happen  He really helped memorable experience   I highly recommend Gordon Ramsey Steak if you're Vegas  If you're local     gotta give try!! <EOR> In opinion place overhyped because name attached it  issue s place echoed many other reviews atmosphere expect $50 minimum plate kind place  service clearly catered larger parties such loud 11+ sitting same room us  times when would ask water wait until new person walked could stop them ask some water  food good but nothing write home your mom about  enjoyed chicken know if order 40 minute cooking wait time but some decadent   Rich many flavors points if chef really trying show off use truffle oil crunchy crap not  say hostesses nice  just really wish someone would asked party sitting next lower volumes especially when them started vulgar <EOR> Food mediocre money could Of gone much better place   onion soup very good but dont put cheese place doesnt put cheese onion soup? $17 least u could give some cheese   ceasar salad ok $17 could find much better   beef wellington which signature dish    Wasnt crazy brown spread inside pastry   mushrooms some heavy glaze wasnt great   Also mac n chz some reason contained peas   good but could w o peas   signature dessert which some toffee pudding thing wasnt crazy it    Overall would skip place ur paying name mastros 10x better <EOR> My husband kicked off Vegas vacation July 17th dinner Gordon Ramsay's Steak  love decor music most all food  waitress spot on  She recommended most amazing drink called southside  She did good good explaining different cuts steaks  She made sure very educated before placed dinner order   beef tartare appetizer     Excellent! ordered beef Wellington American wagyu Kobe steak  macaroni cheese dinner which absolutely amazing  whole meal over $200 but well worth it  try another Gordon Ramsay restaurant next trip Vegas  <EOR> I've restaurant twice am little conflicted it  first time came absolutely LOVED here  beef wellington thought amazing raved everyone  Everything perfect beef melted mouth pastry deliciously flaky  Fast forward just year bit later made sure stop itinerary  debated ordering something different main time but couldn't resist allure beef wellington    good remembered it? Unfortunately say just tad bit disappointed because didn't enjoy quite much second time around  still liked texture beef which very soft but overall impression dish just    salty don't know if beef pastry but took away experience  tried bit ribeye steak which comes HUGE monster portion didn't think anything special honest    just average steak albeit juicy but thought outside bit charred liking   We couple apps share which sounded promising but end weren't really cup tea unfortunately  gnocchi iberico jamon mushrooms pretty good but thought jamon much dry  surprised foie gras which didn't come pate form but rather just    really fatty meat which wasn't crazy about  friend ordered side spinach accompany steak surprisingly quite good  price $100+ per person quite high expected although also did order bottle wine  would still consider coming third time but would definitely order something else maybe wagyu something  <EOR> We birthday locals  wanting come awhile now because see good beef Wellington looks TV shows  husband ordered beef Wellington medium rare sea bass  Beef Wellington came rare absolutely no sauce any kind sea bass whole fish skin tasted smelled fishy  could eat if waiter would told front whole fish skin would ordered something else  waiters credit he did charge it  restaurant high turn over feeling glorified coffee shop! But all all lot hype worth price  going back  <EOR> My friends come during annual NBA Summer League trip  Everything establishment just screams Gordon Ramsey exception Gordon Ramsey actually screaming   hostesses waitstaff decor food pretty much expect see if dined Hell's Kitchen   First off while place exudes class traditional etiquette aren't actually REQUIRED wear formal jacket dress shoes  came straight Summer League stadium clad Laker jerseys basketball shorts never said word  may silently judged but still accepted money exchange good food   Secondly dining areas dimly lit  never entirely sure why high end upscale places prefer such dark lighting but does rob seeing details your meal  Perhaps emphasize sense taste but doesn't really much me  Let light dammit!  Thirdly waitstaff extremely friendly professional don't shy asking questions  present meat wheel circular display various cuts steak offer which think fun and educational presentation   Finally most importantly food least entrees delicious! Last year Ramsey's signature Beef Wellington breaded steak delicious! Don't let size fool you 6 8oz  delicacy very filling leave beyond satiated  year opted bone in rib eye 24oz medium rare  outside steak perfectly seared plated beautifully! first couple bites absolutely euphoric sure LSD made cow would feel taste like  However may due late reservation time wasn't cooked thoroughly enough  hovering just above rare but medium enough middle section enjoyable for tastes   But friends rib eye last year said wasn't good before going give them benefit doubt say fault arriving near closing time   Their sides mostly okay  macaroni cheese tasted little too    healthy lack better word  Perhaps just sharper cheeses but still quite enjoyable  same could said fingerling potatoes sauteed brussel sprouts which normally detest    Also don't idiots just say water when asked your drink order  Unless specify house water aka tap water assume you're big enough baller afford $9 bottle sparkling waters  first year ignorance spent $36 water     almost another steak!  Overall thoroughly enjoyed experience highly recommend it! <EOR> Got reservation few months back   Excellent seat husband's Diamond Caesar's   Great service great food   Here's reason 1 star At end service presented Diamond card told service wanted use comps   all know long takes earn $300 comps!  The server came back said card did work  He could use comps put credit card   month later able find through Caesars did fact take comps off account!  paid twice meal!  So few back forths restaurants says can't anything   don't see comps   record them taking credits credit card receipt   RIDICULOUS!  I love Ramsay's burger place did love until learned bunch scam artists are   disappointed!!  All all paid over $600 meal  $300 meal good twice that     Gordon running place?  Vegas local nice restaurants strip several times month returning to   Carnevino Holmstead   Better service scammers  <EOR> What say    If give more 5 stars would! hubby best steakhouse! pricey but all worth it! anniversary dinner when Vegas evening fantastic!  Complimentary breads they're good! your typical plain bread sourdough  baked perfection stuff mushroom bacon etc  Very good!  For appetizer each piece scallop  melts your mouth! flavorful! savored every bite!  I infamous beef wellington  thought small but wow portion pretty big! cooked perfection!

Everything amazing   except service  Let explain   as high end restaurant especially owned Gordon Ramsay HUGE service perfection big let down  made reservations 2 months advance 5pm when restaurant supposedly opened  day walked 4 50 told wait inside  Okay sure no problem  walked no idea where where stand   no walked gave any updates whether table would ready not  watched other groups just walk ins seated smiling hostesses immediately served  5 05 rolls around wait second such classy restaurant wouldn't least someone let know why weren't seated reservation time? friend actually LEAVE group because he insulted overdramatic? sure    outside remind hostesses still there   The hostess gave no apology kept insisting came early um hello so? still past reservation time   and shouldn't customer always right? pretty much shooed away  already pretty insulted feeling awkward friend walking off  hostess finally came over led table but before presenting Gordon Ramsay's pretty sculpture ceiling walking off  didn't know if should follow until she all way stairs   oops    After sat down took while waiter come around menus  Then took while waiter take order  Then took while    well basically feel being stairs made harder waiters come over when did entire upstairs saturated them  always crowded empty   Luckily more towards normal dinner time 6ish? service more consistent more people near area means waiters need come around more yes? service much better  Food ALL good   right down complimentary free bread butter volcanic sea salt  Beef tender seafood cooked perfection OMG toffee pudding definitely its kind!

DIE FOR  <EOR> I would recommend place anyone!!!!  super ironic Gordon Ramsey show horrible restaurants because can't recall worse customer service experience   much bad place hard know where start but think two things disliked most time took anything server cost drinking water  took hour alcoholic drinks hour half diet soda me  When husband reminded waiter diet soda waiting long being only table without beverage he said someone else working curt tone    It possibly took long drinks because only gave 2 drink menus 12 people    After received soda finally given food menus  Then sweet enough leave alone 30 minutes could over page food options  Once ordered food only took another hour table   The food good but no means best ever had  liked tomato salad but hated Mac cheese which way much truffle oil    My husband did food everyone else because waiter put order wrong  He food everyone finished eating still paid full price ! ! !  Another hour half major disappearing act waiter order dessert request checks  Imagine surprise felt when found water drinking all cost $27 bottle  no time did waiter any other  staff say anything cost water ask if wanted another bottle  just kept filling cups kept drinking because assumed drinking filtered tap water    In end place horrible  waitstaff worst food OK but best ever prices obscene    2 Side notes if your going pay ridiculous amount money decided Beef Wellington just share 1 person plate because same amount two person plate but half cost!!!!
