Shiela waitress very sweet attentive! <EOR> Amazing food drinks view! Really no really come experience yourself!! best!! <EOR> My husband dined another couple decent visit  Before into review food should known really experience course amazing view ambiance  Stratosphere offers second none view entire valley slowly rotating platform upon which restaurant positioned  definitely place impress out of towners locals alike  But why did give only 3 stars? Here's why The food underwhelming  prices weren't outrageous but dishes all unremarkable  pork belly appetizer which usually great anywhere hello bacon   wasn't seared give nice crunchy texture left something desired  lobster bisque strong curry flavor which overpowered lobster completely  Tasty but expecting any seafood bisque ever had  ordered pork tenderloin wrapped bacon warning huge portion overcooked  specifically asked cooked medium waitress initially said chef wouldn't it  asked check but would order something else if he really wouldn't but she came back said he would  He didn't  ate maybe half pork medallion decided wasn't into enough keep eating  finished cheese plate which good spectacular   The service very good Sommelier really helpful choosing wine suit all us  Again really didn't dislike food   it just delicious would've hoped for   Bottom Line Come view experience drinks excellent food  <EOR> I eaten two separate occasions  Romantic spot grab some lunch dinner  Quite pricey could tell one  Both times ordered surf turf which did disappoint  view none other Vegas see all Vegas full rotation  If trip Vegas might well take trip over <EOR> Absolutely amazing restaurant  2013 anniversary back year anniversary dinner well  far BEST although expensive meal ever had  view absolutely incredible definitely some amazing pictures sunset strip night  very much looking forward going again soon!    Food 5 stars  View 5 stars  Service 4 stars <EOR> Bleh    came lunch based recommendation bf's mom  Yes nice see all Vegas cool idea if you've never revolving restaurant before  BUT   if you're only gonna vegas few days eating very time consuming experience considering takes while if you're staying strip then top stratosphere  day elevator wasn't working just being hella slow bc def  40 mins between arriving stratosphere finally being seated!   We 1 30 reservation suprised few people eating there  huge dining room but would say only 30 others  Considering service should awesome right? Well actually SUCKED  big time  server complete snobby beezatch placed order awkwardly awaiting food 45 mins she came casually noted your dishes soon  Maybe ran ingredients leave Stratosphere grocery store then come back fix meal?  really only reason should taken long food esp  considering wasn't even crowded!  That being said food actually delicious well worth price  some sort veal medallions big hunk mozzarella stuffed w greens top BF perfectly velvety lobster bisque humongous ribeye absolutely divine but accompanying potatoes sucked  Also menu lot smaller expected seemed things website weren't even lunch menu when there  Overall might back if nothing else w somebody who'd never before but other just worth trouble  <EOR> Exceptional!!! Beautiful views Las Vegas necessarily strip though  The staff courteous helpful It's very romantic crazy view city  I soup froi gras which both excellent I would definitely recommend classy romantic date Vegas <EOR> Food delicious atmosphere pure Vegas having 360 degree view strip  Nice place special occasions business vacation  Worth every penny <EOR> We came lunch its pretty swanky! feel revolving restaurant top really tall building pretty much must do everyone here!   The 3 course lunch pretty cheap $35   However prosciutto wrapped salmon dish only mediocre  little dry prosciutto hard but pear + Beurre blanc sauce pretty good match w salmon  did try little prime rib thought delicious  should ordered instead salmon! meat connoisseur said just okay     Overall restaurant isn't favorites wouldn't choose all time even if did live Vegas but tourists guests think its great experience  <EOR> Restaurant pas à la hauteur de ce qu'il pourrait offrir   vue imprenable certes mais les prestations culinaires et le service sont médiocres  et les prix sont exorbitants pour la qualité des produits !!! <EOR> Fantastic view!  Food good except lobster bisque only lukewarm  Enjoyed rest dinner banana foster yummy  Staff attentive   Add watching sky divers jumping observatory all all memorable evening  <EOR> I came enjoy ambiance left feeling more satisfied   ordered lobster bisque which best lobster soup ever date   next dish Californian Chicken side mash potatoes green beans   chicken cooked well taste every bit it   took back thanksgiving   service superb   refilled wine glasses water   Did mention views spectacular   started off looking strip 1 hour came back around which excellent way end evening  <EOR> I wonderful experience   server very attentive friendly   entree ordered delicious   salmon cooked perfection   view breathtaking enjoyed looking over city   <EOR> My boo while Vegas  fantastic view sitting booth  recommend requesting when making reservation  other seats great well but booth gives view little higher outward facing vs tables you'd turn your head see things  each tasting menu wine pairing  food excellent cooked perfectly   portions surprisingly generous considering tasting menu  wine pairing great ad wish slightly more generous portions   Service excellent courteous  Lastly photographer take your pic if you'd like  cost associated sure ask first didn't felt bad when only purchased 1 pic because imagined takes time least some cost print assemble pics spot  <EOR> This great place  Unfortunately food doesn't quite live view  Still would recommend trying least once see yourself  <EOR> Went intimate dinner wife while Vegas daughter's wedding it anniversary week well    view fantastic food while okay worth price   definitely paying view  Would drink but far better restaurants Las Vegas far food price  <EOR> I expecting great view so so food   view beyond great   cool clear crisp night   arrived before dusk watch night fall over city mountains   spectacular   also skyjumpers jump past window   Wow   The food?

The manager graciously just took code down said fine slipped away then unfortunately left again charming server   feeling he used dealing guy's personality    After debacle meal on   But instead splurging intended though supposed nice family dinner husband mom brother basically stuck order minimum since really did feel patronizing place   No overpriced champagne us!    As said view gorgeous food good   All tall rotating restaurants overpriced food drink but you're paying view course   If hadn't such atrocious service I'd maybe recommend place as long remember kind restaurant affects prices but Stratosphere getting run down walking through casino shopping area pretty deserted almost creepy feeling whole experience being say spend your money many many other fine establishments MUCH nicer experience while Vegas  <EOR> Great food great view expensive price  price worth experience quality food however other restaurants great view better price tag  recommend Voodoo lounge less expensive alternative  stratosphere rotates eat  completed full rotation while dinned approximately 2 hours  <EOR> Everything great! bread amazing ribeye  waiter very helpful  Perfect date night bday dinner  <EOR> This restaurant special occasions  Beautiful setting amazing views attentive service  Good food spend hours don't feel rushed  always keep place back pocket fool proof special celebration  <EOR> This very nice dining experience   would rated Top World '5' but ask things repeatedly couple times level dining '5' means 'perfect'   arrived ten minutes prior reservation told reservations running 15 minutes behind   took opportunity level 107 observation deck watch some less faint of heart partake thrill rides there   time passed quickly called table   maître d' introduced himself everyone party gave tour providing history restaurant way table   no bad seats restaurant   Every table incredible view restaurant 360 degree rotation two hours   staff very helpful particularly sommelier gave interesting history favorite vineyard associated wine labels   four course tasting menu hit party four   enjoyed accompanying wine flight addition bottle Joseph Phelps cabernet sauvignon   lobster bisque crab cakes sea bass fillets incredible  experience lasted over two hours allowing little more full rotation restaurant   highly recommend Top World  <EOR> the meal view worth all money spent food alcohol!! woot <EOR> loved filet mignon sauteed spinach!!

Umm   my bf aren't cheap tippers but 27% just snapping 3 pictures JUST paying really pricey meal??  Come on?!  But wasn't bothered bothered she said afterward Oh well good thing asked   tend ask sometimes  serious?  Bleh  Overall though would recommend restaurant romantic dinner date  <EOR> Back '03 '04 took opportunity eat tallest structure Las Vegas didn't regret it  food fantastic  still remember till very day    We gone night just very beautiful evening sitting 1000 feet air eating dinner having entire restaurant rotate around Las Vegas  view just spectacular    You know dinner little expensive but worth every dime  If never before only restaurant located around 1000 feet air but entire amusement park sorts above restaurant  Yes shocked when found out   As matter fact while eating kept hearing faint noise time time eventually asked server sound found out    I don't know much things changed since then but great experience back then worth going back if back Vegas again  <EOR> No other place takes cake other TOP WORLD  This Sin City all about   Good thing reservations dinner time because city isn't much sight see without all neon lights night   The view spectacular   floor revolves   don't feel but if look closely enough see it   Nothing mood lighting white tablecloth table   well worth it     They number next each item menu   Common sense would say price   Everything la carte   food cuisine like   Don't expect full   unless you're prepared pay   But honey really well worth it     I would definately come back special occassions other half but often   place special visually stunning I'd hate keep coming back only evetually feel just any mediocre place   But Top World Restaurant    I definately give hats off you  <EOR> We seated time reservation booths  very comfortable views stunning  mixed greens salad start surf turf Canadian lobster main  also mango madness sangria drinks  Hubby portobello cheese app filet main twice baked potato  Everything very tasty service good but main attraction definitely view  Overall very nice experience probably back  <EOR> The food pretty great   Too bad couldn't enjoy because restaurant moves   asked hostess beforehand   if motion sickness very easily    bad idea me  She assured no   Trust me   was  Eiffel Tower instead  No need far down strip  <EOR> What perfect romantic way wife spend wedding anniversary   reservation just  before sunset    The waiters polite helpful   filet mignon generous proportion cooked just way like   All all memorable evening well worth every penny   reservations escorted private elevator restaurant  <EOR> I came 2 13 11 boyfriend year anniversary  researched ton romantic restaurants thanks yelp! settle Top World  wonderful! reservation 4 45 perfect see sights daylight sunset    Our server Dalia total sweetheart  She even helped take some pictures using camera kept trying sunset just weren't turning right   The food phenomenal  Both boyfriend five course tasting menu  Everything top notch but favorites crab cake filet mignon  Both those best ever had! crab cake decadent filet melt in your mouth cooked perfectly   The best part however right before dessert  boyfriend table came around side down knee proposed! He even spoken Dalia ealier evening arranged professional photographer come around snap photos while he proposed special that?! Oh course said yes We ended getting two photo albums two wallet size albums which cost pretty penny BUT since already spending lot amazing dinner springing photos good pass up  Plus often photo's your proposal?! made whole night totally priceless  <EOR> Selected $90USA per person menu two people  Cannot fault service view  Although seats window faced view row back disappointed  lobster bisque awesome favourite meal  Everything great including cocktails  more expensive meal usually pay but well worth it  <EOR> My review visit 02 22 2014  reservations party 12 Saturday 8pm  When view spectacular but  only positive thing say visit  food terrible! Surf Turf Gnochi Lobster Braised Beef Short Rib promptly disappointed meal  pasta flavor extra fishy really good combination beef short rib added  Whoever thought good way combine meal needs rethink taste buds   Seriously    What even more disappointing husband's meal  He wanted stay away seafood stick pasta chicken waiter said he could Fettuccine Seafood Alfredo Lobster Prawns Scallops menu no seafood replace chicken  Both sister in law husband ordered waiter's suggestion  When husband sister in law meal however if chef removed scallops slapped some chicken top it  meal fishy exactly trying avoid  When spoke waiter matter he said no way meal any seafood  What?! waiter made both sister in law husband look liars very embarrassing front large group friends  top all off waiter did even bother calling manager assistance replacing meal something else  practically stuck paying meal did eat  call fine dining? don't think so!  And finally entire group pretty upset when noticed directly across table group big ours receiving totally different service just because some type minor league baseball player group  manager showing them different champagnes catering every need  fair? Shouldn't all customers receive same service?   In conclusion would only recommend place view but definitely nice dining experience! <EOR> Now forgive tardiness review  haven't actually Stratosphere years but when did place wanted to  They've since figured won't let book reservations then skip 'em tower free but imagine food still good there's still business 1HP motor keeps view spinning about    Or maybe 4 times never once pay dime it?

Anyways waited while enjoyed view lounge but then 20 minutes became 30 which then became 40! finally back down apologized long wait led window table right away  waiter friendly helpful exemplary but certainly bad  However food took another 40 MINUTES prepare!! definitely did expect long wait severely disappointed especially because restaurant busy ALL  saw least 4 empty tables around ours   Overall service fine but wait time especially slow night awful  However keep mind $25 gift certificate which might affected service? If pretty dishonorable    Food The complimentary bread butter gave delicious  give plate three different kinds butter regular garlic marmalade which awesome actually favorite food night whether that' good bad thing decide    My boyfriend 10oz  USDA Choice Filet Red Wine Mushroom Sauce $53  portion quite small all he literally piece steak it  No vegetables anything  steak itself good I piece tender juicy  However nowhere near best steak ever eaten opinion worth price ALL! Lala's Argentine Grill West Hollywood CA significantly better steaks around $20   I Fettuccine Seafood Alfredo Lobster Prawns Scallops $40  ONLY OKAY  Honestly better pasta casual restaurants CPK BJ's around $20 Baby Clam Linguini lemon cream sauce CPK Spaghettini Fresh Clams Grand Lux Cafe Palazzo significantly better   sauce creamy actually kind cold right start  Some pasta even hard undercooked  However prawns scallops hearty size cooked very well  plate only piece lobster though dry almost tasteless   So overall if want view because view amazing  However felt food WORTH PRICE all really regret going there  If money spend it  Otherwise tell them just want Lounge restaurant  You'll still tower see view if Happy Hour 2 for 1 martinis!

well prepared though best ever had   The restaurant itself wasn't very lively dimly lit making romantic setting  staff willing take picture professional photographer sell quality prints very modest price   If you're looking elegant quiet dinner great view strip place looking for  <EOR> As vacationer best views Vegas is  food service equal view  fresh seafood appetizer gulf shrimp fresh oysters tuna poke Alaska king crab lobster cocktail sauce porterhouse tender excellent choice  came under suggestion friend he right  Only thing need taxied wouldn't suggest walking around area night  <EOR> Worthy 2 5 stars  ordered 16oz  medium prime ribeye horseradish crust demi glace along twice baked potato  steak overcooked  medium well barely pink center  explained server steak overcooked cut steak through thickest center portion show which point he asked explain would convey Chef  flabbergasted asked he simply explain ordered steak medium steak medium well tough  He took steak away leaving untouched potato cool itself returned minute later ask if would take opportunity order different cut meat filet mignon perhaps  simply stated did want another type steak would prefer originally ordered properly cooked  question itself insinuated did understand differences between various cuts meat if didn't perfectly over cooked ribeye perhaps should order more tender cut beef  essence attempting shift blame me   WOW  class  When pointed lonely potato he acted though intent replace go  replacement steak alright  twice cooked potato nothing special  Overall two dinners four glasses wine 3 mini deserts $220 00 bucks including 15% tip little steep table view   Chef Gordon Ramsey suggests if see anything menu containing white truffle oil run other way  should known better when noticed ricotta gnocchi mac cheese white truffle oil listed under sides    <EOR> Absolutely amazing   impeccable food view   love place  top three vegas  <EOR> On December 15th ate beet salad food

This first time Stratosphere even though Vegas mess time  whole experience parking going restaurant nice journey  liked parking didn't cost  Each person check very nice well mannered    Food French Onion Soup prefer traditional mozzarella instead fondue  interesting take  Tuna Tartare Tacos amazing best thing taro shells great compliment    Filet Mignon 10oz Very average  Dry overcooked plating big plate made steak look very pathetic  extremely disappointed   Sides Lobster Mac Great Mac saucy style Mac but amount lobster always disappointing  Any lobster Mac lacks lobster guess can't expect much   Sautéed Broccolini Very average  Waiter warned might spicy cause chili flakes  Hot Cheetos more kick this    food itself okay  loved Tuna Tartare tacos  Everything else wasn't all impressive  thought would pre fixe menu but ended day before  pre fixe menu better course items presented  think little more well thought out  filet worst decision  don't expect filet overly juicy but honestly poorly cooked  steak medium rare solid medium  dryness steak showed sat long  If sauce described pre fixe would've made lot sense  Everything else order okay  service itself great  don't mind that   Luckily view fact sunset priceless  don't regret experience am glad share date  would just never come back again  revolving restaurant cool ploy but don't think food stands atmosphere  Nevertheless

I took then girlfriend during Vegas Valentine's Day excursion  She loved much did  This place located within Stratosphere reservations strongly recommended  Getting revolving restaurant involves taking elevator top checking desk  Once your table ready taken revolving restaurant amazed great views  restaurant rotates slow rate change enjoy 360 degree view Las Vegas  view especially great night  The food itself phenomenal  well worth price made right balance ingredients  Thus far filet mignon salmon  drink opt pinot noir  glass take view another accompany meal   The service efficient meal comes many trimmings  yet tried desserts but update when do  Chances come back next Vegas trip stay tuned  <EOR> I arrived 20 minutes late 5 00 reservation but still seated within few minutes  asked host window seat able without any problem place pretty empty  huge bread eater don't typically eat bread brought before meal but butter spread served amazing  force myself stop eating it  ordered Ribeye blue cheese butter topping creamed spinach while partner seafood pasta  Both delicious although took 20 25 minutes arrive  steak cooked perfectly blue cheese butter complimented very well  service excellent enjoyed beautiful but overpriced photo photographer captured us  interesting seeing sky jumpers flying window  Visiting restaurant also entitles visit observation deck free  <EOR> I dined Easter 04 16 2017 boyfriend must say average experience  view itself gets 5 stars fact restaurant rotates see beautiful dusty views Vegas    I disappointed menu selections since high end restaurant did expect them more options non beef eaters but place known steaks    I did ask special accommodation informed if anything menu cannot serve which bummer  really happy meal all worth $200 boyfriend spent but he enjoyed juicy steak   However drinks delicious yummy   so drinks worth it  If certain dietary restrictions highly recommend dine unless love steak   However server lovely even took picture us  He did recommend any specials  hope change menu then probably back  dinner did top Stratosphere enjoyed view if dine restaurant free see view many memories create there! Definitely must see! <EOR> Yes metal detector before ride little weird but whatever precautionary measure since 9 11 because stratosphere tallest buildings Vegas I asked     ***the floor rotates 360 degrees hour VERY slowly if you're complaining sea sickness dizziness you've lot more issues think I'd start visiting psychiatrist first  view spectacular jumpers really don't detract dinner all other people said actually kinda cool watch then fly place rotates they're your way during dinner ENTIRE time   Moving on     Our reservation 6 15 checked 6 09 gave pager directed 107 lounge upstairs where ordered two most delicious dirty martinis waited maybe 10 minutes before pager off  Nothing ridiculous nice restaurant might wait moment no big deal   We seated booth which honestly  wasn't right next window but instead having turn heads enjoy view sit look straight out personally think best seat house    Karen waitress she awesome recommendations spot on! She cheerful checked frequently but overly frequently hate when servers come back every 2 mins when you've mouthful  Haha    What ordered Crab cakes $19  ordered two think best crab cakes ever if best!  Ordered lobster bisque soup Karen kindly offered split soup which really nice honestly 4 course meal portion perfect much little tasted PHENOMENAL! wasn't salty slight almond flavor just magnificent  far best lobster bisque had! Better Ruth's Chris  certain   My bf ordered horseradish crusted ribeye   it yummy he ordered MR came little more rare dude Karen suggested cooked Medium before hand but he didn't complain still ate really yummy I ordered filet very tender first just okay some mushroom sauce over which personally think probably would've tastes better just plain pepper butter seasoning most restaurants but more toward middle lot better  also paired cab opened really nicely   Our sides Potatoes au gratin HEAVENLY! Button Mushrooms Wow!  Dessert Strawberries Romanoff never anything before but light refreshing perfect heavy meal absolutely delectable! Bf's birthday brought cute tiny flourless cake orgasmic!  Coffee bit strong tasting liking but bf said wasn't bad espresso which yummy came rock candy stir sweeten espresso very cute    They also photographer takes pictures   they're $45 two big photos  came very nice    For such fantastic meal BF ordering two beers through dinner well bill only came $250 tip $300 which would gladly back pay again next time Vegas  <EOR> Breathtaking view dinner great! Great waiters staff  Would definitely come again  Only downside wait hour window seat can't reserve advance  <EOR> Food good but service very very disappointing  already dinner but wanted experience here  wanted seat window obviously  When arrived plenty empty tables beside window but lied all reserved did see single person coming till close   ordered appetizers already full  waiter very rude  When told interested main course behavior changed felt unwelcome  He kept pressurizing order some main course though made very clear interested  point felt really uncomfortable half mind leave  Finally food came  lobster bisque husband pork belly  Both pretty good  dinner when check came signed then waiter took while still sitting there  seems he wanted leave did full course dinner  When leaving he even stopped verified tip!!!!! point really wanted zero  Overall food good but way pricy attitude servers proportional amount money spending!!! <EOR> The views food amazing!

Our waiter Joel explain price gone since prepaid meal therefore reason why $119 per person plus tax gratuity $126 per person plus tax tip gratuity  If did say anything would charged extra $40 per person would paid $70 more over above expected pay  I'm sure most people call but purely ethical someone prepay meal then meal then let them know ahead time meal price changed would pay different price ahead time  However tried away wasn't until become almost belligerent changed price agreed pay two months ago  If you're reading please reservations Stratosphere predators should patronize them  <EOR> Sure might cliche thing while Vegas but thought well worth it  restaurant sits top Stratosphere Tower neat beautiful view Vegas Strip  eating area slowly oscillates around tower providing all around view  waited very minimal additional time reservation outer edge seat worth well   The food great prices reasonable service great well  think only major thing missing ambiance actual interior  just seemed lackluster dull bit outdated  Nonetheless I'd give 4 5 stars throw extra half there   Also Sky Lounge happy hour first able bring down much cheaper drinks dinner  Definitely suggested route    <EOR> Nice place  European cuisine American serving sizes breathtaking views  Lobster bisque perfect  But expect any surprises special dates as birthdays anniversaries etc    Anyway cuisine 5 service 4 5 location 5+ <EOR> Service amazing although food tasted mediocre made restaurant view service I'd probably back just view glass wine lol <EOR> The view course amazing!

course know mix olive oil vinegar but just asked question especially restaurant Top World speechless    Also food took quite long time because disappointing service frankly confident dairy free  asked person brought food which confirmed but looking Brussels Sprouts did feel confident dairy free did eat them  food did eat very good want point bus boy whose name did incredible wish could tipped directly    I did ask speak manager did name but relayed concerns  waiter came back talk said misunderstanding which clearly not  ordered wine did receive received horrible service then offered free dessert  very kind offer except being lactose intolerant neither eat it    So all paid full price  Now money concern  know prices Top World happily expecting pay did but expected top notch service which did receive    In closing someone visits Vegas consistent basis am having real reservations ever coming back Top World also having second thoughts referring well   I truly hope service improves because its best Top World best restaurants Vegas  <EOR> When walk prepared your breath taken away  Came lunch Ultra Burger cheddar cheese $26 00  good wish cheddar cheese melted more  Erick brought bread nice hot whipped butter sweet easily melted  give 3 varieties love butter  drinks never empty  server Dana very nice attentive also top drinks  cannot wait come back dinner here  am sure spectacular night!

It's little cheesy but also exciting occasionally see people bungee jumping off side building  unexpected warning signs walls  also send around photographer which again cheesy but such great photograph bought it   I'm glad dining experience  well worth money  <EOR> the view spectacular much food! ordered sea food scallops lobster shrimps lobster completely over salted! 3 glasses water meal! very expensive worth it! <EOR> We decided dinner mostly view  view absolutely amazing night!  The food decent but forgettable  ordered seared sea bream    Maybe next time I'd just take elevator observatory whatever called see view  <EOR> Food 3 star rating but gorgeous view bumped 5 stars  mean really now you're paying ambiance views  There's nowhere else city  restaurant rotates all 360 degrees hour span? Yeah real nice   Came Valentine's Day dinner not actual day but weekend before around 7pm  valet because it'll quite hike if park parking garage  If valet only short walk tower entrance  Feb 2017 self parking still no charge   For appetizers each ordered salad Caesar Wedge salads  big enough share  entrees ordered Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with baby bok choy tamari ginger garlic pickled carrot garnish  Portions big enough leftovers  boyfriend steak filet  shared twice baked potato topped bacon cheddar green onions  Honestly food alright  good    but nothing whoa!!!! dish might sat awhile because wasn't pippin hot when arrived table   pet peeves    lukewarm food  Blehhhhh!!! still would come back lunch though   looking some pictures lobster sandwich   yum!  Skipped dessert because much sweets person plus full already  But no doubt dessert items must taste divine   Like mentioned before you're really paying view  Especially during dinnertime  restaurant rotates 360 degrees don't worry if don't view Las Vegas Strip when first seated  Eventually you'll it  those sensitive motion moves slow really don't feel it  You're definitely moving merry go round   Tourist local would recommend trying restaurant  Lunch dinner    you can't really wrong  menu website complete pricing too  Enjoy! <EOR> The concept kinda cool  restaurant would circle around 360 degrees while enjoy your lunch dinner giving panoramic view  ordered 3 course menu la carte foie gras dish  foie gras okay but liked Joel Robuchon better  steak moist  all lobster bisque probably best dish  dessert chocolate mousse quite satisfying  bf didn't sweet much but he really enjoyed it  also ordered mango cocktail pretty good also  <EOR> I'm sad write review   husband regularly visited Top World since 2002 when engaged   food service always superb   Until last night    We always order same thing we little stuck ways filet mignon medium rare garlic mashed potatoes grilled asparagus lobster bisque   Every single visit last night provided most amazing filet ever tasted    butter   sides die well      lobster bisque oh God!!     When visited last night disappointed see menu changed prices raised significantly   But still didn't deter ordering food service never let down   both started lobster bisque very pleased   Still delicious     We then medium rare filets Yukon gold potatoes sauteed mushrooms they no longer asparagus major letdown     Neither received medium rare filet   most definitely medium which know most people enjoy but those people   potatoes dry mushrooms       don't know even know say   Generally both love mushrooms but far  quality taste come expect over decade visiting   just good   Compound dissatisfaction meal fact raised those prices you've some unhappy customers     Additionally waiter odd guy   He just friendly when he tried serve double order mashed potatoes instead mushrooms he seemed annoyed when told even showed husband notes     oh mash mush look very similar     Okay crazy shrooms! The view unbelievable place special memory probably come back hope Top World return original glory    But if weren't would probably last visit  <EOR> Ok admit sucker ambiance   love whole revolving restaurant thing   Dinner very nice this   seeing all Vegas lights   loved it!  4 5 stars this!  The food fine   Wedge salad seafood steak    nothing write home but still solid quality   didn't come food honestly wasn't expecting much   If you're expecting high end gourmet food then may disappointed     The overall experience good   I'd definitely recommend anyone visiting Vegas   something I'd every time?  No   But ya gotta least once! <EOR> KEVIN worse servant ever life    party 5 friend birthday    waiter Kevin rude slow    He rushed order talk fast   He never smiled didn't say anything nice! took 45 minutes food everything cold! Chicken steak salmon    all cold! top asked Medium steak well done!!  Only complaining manager new food Kevin changed attitude     The view amazing everything expensive thought gonna be     This place nice but need better ppl work there   <EOR> My boyfriend surprised dinner Top World 3 year anniversary  started dinner off amazing bread 3 different butters  filet dinner literally melted mouth  great server sommelier fun talk to  Chateau St Michelle cab best wine long time    I loved whole restaurant spun 360 view Vegas  just favorite restaurant Los Angeles  fun watching everyone jump off top  chills just watching them jump!!

Andrew suggested dessert would even better but unfortunately didn't any room   would've definitely great friend Joe again   but forgave meeting due being busy prepping big fight MGM next week   still wonderful time nonetheless  <EOR> This restaurant choice Las Vegas   No fancy Michael's Joel Robechon sp  Guy Savoy   But find service excellent here   almost always Steak Lobster bottle Perriet Joet    pricey but view best west again great service ask Jeannie night Dee lunch    Dean the sommelier best  <EOR> Not sure favorite   view food! reservation 6 30PM sun set around 7PM actually perfect  I'd recommend checking when sun setting reserving time fits kind view you'd during your meal  feel see best both worlds seat next window eat see only strip but also people bungee jumping off building! Food cheap but its rotating restaurant Vegas  ordered seafood pasta duck  seafood pasta actually much seafood couldn't finish all shrimp!! never happens   little chunks crab meat hiding inside made every bite enjoyable  duck pretty good too! No room dessert time    I would recommend place experience special night out! <EOR> Worst service ever had!! Long wait once worst experience ever  waiter pushing leave ever reason he had  Found later supposedly very busy needed table another waiter confessed  Over charged tower fee later corrected but since already payed people very careful <EOR> big steaming pile pony loaf   first thought pops into mind when think Top World Restaurant @ Stratosphere   single worst supposed mid high class restaurants Vegas   PURE CLASSLESS PANDERING The second thing pops into mind incredibly classless sham  But if you've ever Stratosphere Tower already knew didn't you?  endless parade Disneyland esque shops just happen force wander past just restaurant's very entrance should obvious realizing restaurant just another revenue generator around one trick pony Stratosphere all going lead nothing but utter disappointment evening   How loathe place?  Let start view   WAIT    HATE BECAUSE 108 STORY VIEW? Not exactly   problem restaurant because view absolutely only thing going it   view gorgeous whether you're near windows above loge dining area   rotating restaurant great concept sure all year long patrons flock Top World dine sky only discover may view heaven but also dining experience hell   Restaurant well tended Denny's Vegas Strip Denny's much better prices piping hot food boot     To 100% clear if restaurant wasn't bazillionth floor Stratasphere absolutely believe would gone business years ago   WOW    WHAT'S BAD THEY'D BUSINESS? First all 3 times Stratosphere's some good casino coupons 2 3 times main course served cold  case part Kobe medallions course tasted death barely warmed over prompting send back   even talked couple next mentioned food could warmer too   But isn't surprising because service atrociously slow   used think problem lay entirely wait staff delivering food timely fashion when order but since lukewarm Kobe come conclusion everyone host chefs waiters just    don't    really care   It frankly beyond service though Filet Mignon wine mushroom sauce it   Filet's usually most flavorful cut but certainly expected softest steak available instead something tasteless cube suppose beef but considering difficulty steak knife can't really certain   then suddenly understood why put mushroom wine sauce it cover fact weak tasteless steak begin with     SAUCES HUH?  OVERUSED MAYBE? Well dish dish asparagus lobster ravioli etc  realized common thread was felt warmed over cafeteria meal served 108 floors up   None dishes would ever stand own every course constantly covered some sort thick sauce glaze   Hollandaise sauce Wine sauce Apricot sauce Ginger sauce    over over again sauces   Additionally think cheesy cheap nature Stratosphere lends itself getting rather crass group customers   saw people restaurant very questionable attire trying figure if being old codger kids wearing just completely inappropriate clothes   Tennis shoes jeans appear norm lots douchebag ish Ed Hardy garb   girl looked she wearing lingerie just grabbing bite eat way Poly Esthers    maybe Rhino   never tell bunch   On humorous note once saw those cheesy photographers going around taking couple's pictures momentous occasion eating Top World later showing them photo charging them something $20 restaurant bill photo   price springs mind because couple sat next muttering something price paid while perusing check   CONCLUSION say establishment barely escaped having 1 Star Doom TM stamped forehead  pull no punches when organization deserves serious criticism horrendous service unforgivably cold food poor quality steak crass environment    and +1 star being damned Stratosphere having view   2 Stars   Terrible borderline awful  <EOR> The view spectacular food excellent! server very nice helpful  only weird thing elevator attendant  girl friend rode along side another couple older white couple  attendant asked them where where said somewhere midwest  Then she asked where said Los Angeles   Then she said way which counrty? paused second because did understand question  She asked which country orgin where from  guess people L A  aren't born USA!

It's kinda  give impression  welcome <EOR> I've dined three times before each time always pleasure relaxing meal such spectacular views   The service perfect through detector before taking restaurant staff always all smiles  recommend making reservation before going  If wait could chill lounge they'll call when your table ready  Once seated lead your table which set rotating floor slowly moves around top Stratosphere  can't really feel yourself moving once youre seated but every often see different view Las Vegas  Sometimes if you're lucky you'll see people jumping off side Stratosphere's Skyjump attraction   The last time came decided bring family dad ex both wearing shirts which wasn't allowed them wear weird shade orange oversized dress shirt over which pretty funny  unless want mismatched standing suggest suit up! dress somewhat nice   I've tried Crab Cakes Ribeye Rack Lamb Salmon which all tasted delightful me  horseradish addition Ribeye such wonderful combination  juicyness steak blended well slight pungent distinct taste horseradish which really made tastebuds jump joy  salmon dry all very soft tender  love lamb although typically small portions sauce put top extremely enjoyable  Most all wide assortment bread favorite parts dinner    I think pricing somewhat agreeable fair food views get  You're pretty much paying experience views mean Vegas all   Overall place great spot date whether something special something casual  food service views all point disappointed! <EOR> My wife dinner last night anniversary  First off atmosphere great  Being 106 stories slowly spinning around give complete 360 views area great   Our waiter awesome  Explained menu very well made sure everything need every step way  My wife ordered filet mignon wagyu skirt steak lobster tail  steak very tender lobster fantastic  wife's filet tender juicy almost melted your mouth  better steaks had  few beers dinner wife few glasses wine  dinner very good both enjoyed views while eating  did decide order cheese cake desert  also very good! Thanks Top World giving free anniversary!  We did check observation tower 109th floor dinner!  Would definitely recommend place anyone wanting celebrate special occasion  <EOR> Poor service all around  weren't greeted welcomed waited 20 30 minutes being seated before even acknowledged  server asked immediately asked if ready order before even chosen drinks  addition menu very limited overpriced selection  waiting another 15 minutes before she returned decided did want eat due poor service  Upon telling server changed mind dining she promptly said ok need move bar instead even asking why wrong! Overall very disappointing experience  ended going Morton's instead wonderful! <EOR> Great food great view    I am only giving 5 stars restaurant  enclosed observation deck above very weird  <EOR> The food just ok   tried lobster bisque everyone seemed rave disappointing   Just weird mix flavors   tuna tataki calamari ok   faltiron steak sandwich also just ok     Of course rotating view very nice but many other fantastic places dine vegas way more bang your buck  <EOR> The restaurant rotates  everything inside restaurant 10 years old  food really expensive very good don't recommend place wish would've read some reviews before coming! <EOR> Lovely staff restaurant  accidentally into wrong area restaurant looking bar area ended main dining section staff rude it  apologized left small gratuity decency bad mouth behind back lol  Finally made lounge area looking enjoyed 2 1 cocktails half price appetizers  service ok food good view AMAZING  Plus watch people jump side building  cool too  Happy hour between 4 7 if dine restaurant bring some serious $$$ menu definitely fine dining  <EOR> The husband dinner first night town  He told ambiance would amazing Vegas skyline subtle rotation  Usually restaurants gimmicky atmosphere subpar food  Oh boy did food blow other restaurants water! ordered rack lamb 4 course meal share   The staff friendly attentive  gave recommendations order advised perfectly    We started bread which AMAZING! fresh came 3 flavored butters  orange favorite!   Lobster Bisque oh tasty filled lobster  Waiter served table side show much lobster actually bisque   Branzino perfectly seared delicious!  Steak perfectly cooked asked tasty but rack lamb seriously outshined this   Rack Lamb absolutely orgasmic!!!! started while hubs ate steak could switch off told needed finish this  mint sauce great each 2 pieces  very generous portion   Dessert came 4 course meal good but seriously rack lamb  Mmmmmm!  At point during dinner rotate where bungee jumpers falling above keep mind 107th ? floor   pretty entertaining   We observation deck dinner great way end night  Worth every penny  Wonderful service atmosphere food! <EOR> Great attentive service  surprised bf birthday  view great  takes hour twenty minutes fully rotate complete experience view  disappointed no longer serve bread pudding  twin lobster tails bf surf turf  He admits lobster fresher crab legs but he still enjoyed everything  Oh sangria AMAZING!   You may even catch skydiver two  <EOR> Das Essen war ausgezeichnet und der Service hervorragend  Natürlich ist es nicht ganz günstig aber die toöle Aussicht rechtfertigt jeden Preis  Zudem kann man nach dem essen noch nach oben ohne etwas zu bezahlen  Das einzige mich gestört hat war dass während dem Essen Angestellte mit Kameras herumliefen und immer fragten ob sie Fotos machen dürften  <EOR> Came celebrate 4 year anniversary proposed 4 years ago day restaurant  Unfortunately sit disappointed  Steak changed  Less flavor dry  carrots embellished food more flavorful then steak itself  $70 22 oz steak expected much more  better steak Outback Steakhouse tonight  Unfortunately think last time come here  <EOR> DO TASTING MENU    We made reservation seated great view  don't think there's bad seat though  opted tasting menu opted upgrade shrimp lobster extra 10 bucks  well worth it    We started lobster bisque a little much Brandy taste cousin Caesar  then scallop she pork belly  shared them  liked scallop it's just one much better  filet lobster next amazing  Lastly dessert which full enjoy!   Get early  lines elevators long through metal detector  But amazing experience beginning your trip full view! <EOR> Do yourself favor take $250+ spend dinner 2 elsewhere    A little myself I worked restaurant industry ten years  dined restaurants same price point Top World  know good steak when taste one  could call steak aficionado  also know good service when see it    Trust when say restaurant COMPLETE waste time money   Let start waitstaff Lack formality  Lack menu knowledge  no recommendations made no suggested appetizers no complementing glass wine offered  indecisive which glass wine wanted pair $75 steak waitress said okay stared before telling she'd back   Water came right away  Then another waiter came asked if wanted water  glasses just filled  bread basket brought quite timely  contained five pieces all different bread four different types butter which described nicely but waitress but other waiter failed realize already water front us    The food horrible  cocktail sauce Shrimp Cocktail marinara   lobster tail didn't look right nor taste right   steaks huge but flavor texture off  let 8 oz filet 6 oz lobster tail right garbage  manager stopped over soon food dropped before chance taste never saw again    The only thing decent glass Shiraz view  Complete disappointment  Complete waste money  <EOR> I ate once tourist list number years   seated promptly server Mirella came ask drink order questions menu   I ordered chef's tasting menu following choices lobster bisque Kurobuta pork belly filet mignon shrimp scampi chocolate duo dessert   I soon brought small bread basket  two rolls piece lavash along three butter florets sweet pesto flavored third ginger peach   best pesto but best let butter come closer room temperature most flavors   glad downsized bread basket person   smarter bringing regular basket lot back   The lobster bisque win   fair amount lobster broth good   pork belly let down   menu says root vegetables farro quinoa chimichurri Chinese five spice   All ingredients tended overpower pork belly enhance it   filet cooked blue ordered   two shrimp scampi served  bed mashed potatoes along some green beans   steak red wine reduction I'd say best part meal   no choice dessert  it's chocolate duo consisting two chocolate dishes   dark chocolate pot de crème  very rich very good   other white chocolate shaped cup holding some fresh berries vanilla mousseline   Service excellent during meal   Mirella brought fresh glass iced tea before asked refill she refill coffee dessert   The view great   found myself less concentrated looking Las Vegas Boulevard Strip hotels more neighborhoods   tourists all taking photos Strip   The meal A OK but you're paying Strip prices plus extra view   bonus access rooftop observation deck dinner   If subtract $12 cost just going tower view price bit better  <EOR> My review LOUNGE part restaurant    My boyfriend staying Stratosphere looking somewhere hang drink  He mentioned lounge top tower reluctantly agreed  scared heights but curious check out  normally $6 hotel guests gain access top tower but since going lounge free able through private entrance separate elevator  pretty cool   felt little VIP even though wasn't through small security check before ride top   Once top the trip took 2 minutes exited elevator saw view  Immediate vertigo   such weird feeling  lounge very dark lit little blue lights   nice intimate  sit wherever want most part  nice selection martinis  Drinks reasonable   expected them pricey but martini $10  drink per person minimum which isn't bad all    The view breathtaking  think would cool watch sun set there  kind scary thing place shakes bit every few minutes  used while seated but walked around freaked bit when shook  stayed almost two hours  would really fun small group   I think would nice eat restaurant but look menu none offerings suit tastes  Duck whatnot pretty pricey  restaurant slowly rotates   unfortunately lounge doesn't  <EOR> The whole experience gets 5 stars 4 5 food  While good cheapest steak if $47 but remember would cost observatory anyway tried mentally subtract cost just ticket meal price  spent $250 3 us  service great Glenn server phenomenal  Loved view  ended going around 2 revolutions and wanted leisurely meal could see both day night views reservation 6 45 facilitate mid August   dinner walked next two decks top deck being open air observation deck  could catch glimpse people doing attractions  son's 10th birthday made reservation OpenTable noted birthday  Everyone helped hostess Glenn made point wish Happy Birthday which made feel special  While didn't order desert because full delicious lobster bisque lobster center bowl soup poured around table skirt steak Glenn surprised son s'more dessert candle  made night very special  also called name gave extra special attention  All needs met request more garlic pesto butter making special virgin drink son  definitely something glad did once while Vegas  photographer comes around take your picture like cruise ship but wasn't any real pressure a take photo b buy them approximately $65   <EOR> We've coming

I cannot believe unprofessional way he handled situation  cost $100 meal course he lost business friends family's business honest experience social media other patrons don't experience same thing    If you're going spend kind money someplace else dinner!

If wanna impress girl first date definitely recommend place  Now back food service  food portion decent actually good  service very good also  price actually bad when think location view  <EOR> I've always felt Top World restaurant sits close top 1 149 foot Stratosphere hotel casino bit gimmick tourist trap  844 feet air you're guaranteed spectacular view Las Vegas rotates your viewpoint constantly changing but food?  As missus didn't want risk $20 person appetizers then spend another $40 $50 each entrées should just passable because view certainly them decided take restaurant around spin less expensive lunch much surprise quite impressed   I settled salad meal fresh heirloom tomatoes interlaced chunks bright red watermelon squeaky mozzarella supported crunchy pistachio bits sweet balsamic sherry vinaigrette drizzle  followed calamari shrimp fritto misto appetizer also included fried peppers olives presented would call Two Face style half plate resting warm somewhat chunky old school tomato sauce other half basking delightful wasabi sour cream  Both plates some thought put into them carefully designed tiny works art plate yet also flavorful perfect light lunch   This missus opted lobster grilled cheese sandwich served tomato bisque  sandwich prepared huge chunks scrumptious Canadian lobster trapped between layers gooey cheddar Brie while bisque smooth presented some playfulness  cup sat atop raw slice tomato seemed represent tomato base dish used  She relished both items   Some marketing restaurant uses its ads suggests eating heighten your senses taste unexpected   Truth advertising? Most definitely  dishes ate exceeded initial jaded expectations would come back try dinner tasting menu experience Vegas dusk   That said view does seem impact menu's prices  While am definitely shy when comes spending around $150 nice dinner two Vegas especially when what's offered something unique would spend same eat Top World dinner if 100 floors lower? Maybe? Maybe not?

Just because really high sky means pay ass food? thinks not!     Personally when saw friends meals glad didn't order anything didnt look worth money friend ended feeling well afterwards   My friend said all you're paying experience    Well restaurants same price better service food better experience! If means having view then it! Why does restaurant think view all that?  Anywayss   interior very drab looks 80s dark colors tried brightening place white tablecloths but doesn't help when lighting low barely see your plate feel theyre trying hide something  Also weren't playing any music kind awkward put Jazz Pandora station phone didn't feel awkward   poing live band started playing upstairs somewhere but just spot they dont revolve sound quiet then loud when closer   just weird   Overall very dissappointed restaurant when walked really needs renovated!

I New York Strip steak which pretty good  also able taste fillet mignon really great sauce  However probably stood whole dish side order potato au gratin  Man cheesy creamy  Very tasty  food didn't fail disappoint  prices little higher used but then again usually don't eat high end restaurants often  didn't think prices outrageous though  No shorts t shirts either  gotta dress least little bit   Can't say enough view  Pretty surreal amazing  <EOR> Best filet Vegas  Lobster prepared amazing great flavor!

Finally actually search over server because he absent long NEVER even dump Denny's    I'm usually pretty easy going servers being slow  I understand swamped when things busy but restaurant wasn't busy all servers taking care surrounding tables seemed no trouble all much more friendly demeanor   Our server older gentleman Oaxaca don't know if he having off day but when family spends several hundred dollars restaurant expect better service would  Olive Garden  live Los Angeles home terrible waiters guy takes cake  <EOR> The food spectacular  Some reviews rate food poorly  baffles me  food rivals Eiffel Tower Gordon Ramsay Steak Paris restaurants Bellagio  If you're into views you'll love your dining experience well  Service consistently excellent  cheap but highly recommended  <EOR> The views give place five star rating itself  full 360 degree view Las Vegas best place view strip why wouldn't amazing?  The food pretty darn good  free range chicken minus three cheese fondue boyfriend large mexican prawns new england scallops  Since lactose intolerant send chicken back when came cheese still inside  But waiter extremely apologetic made sure ordered  loved chicken moist well seasoned  boyfriend said quality restaurant seafood bit chewy disappointing  So minus star that  Also know isn't any fault restaurant but Stratosphere itself which restaurant sits top of Ghetto capital G  The service Anthony great! He extremely knowledgeable Strip lengthy conversation happened Sahara hotel owns certain hotels buildings etc   Overall wonderful experience romantic anniversary dinner we'll definitely return  <EOR> This far fanciest restaurants ever to  whole room slowly spins around never bad seat    The food portions just okay great    The service best ever experienced  waiter Jeff incredibly kind very professional constantly checked during meal   The reason left off 1 star portions price main reason restaurant Stratosphere VERY bad part town  Wife accidentally walked down wrong street suit dress harassed some gang banger  Literally block later Stratosphere  isn't fault but takes away overall experience  <EOR> My husband visited restaurant last week while Las Vegas  food good view amazing but  service great  spent 1 hour 40 minutes waiting food come kitchen  lady walking around taking pictures she good  If restaurant need buy picture package almost redeemed evening  <EOR> This place amazing would've gladly given five stars but here's why didn't We Top World boyfriends birthday 2 weeks ago try remember everything ordered  planned many months really looked forward it  ordered Pork Belly appetizer AMAZING  Forgive if am wrong but If remember correctly servers name Niki  She cute button  service recommendations excellent she should raise     My main course Rack Lamb just exquisite  PERFECTLY cooked melted mouth  far best lamb EVER had  lamb accompanied couscous wasabi style kick world  complimented lamb perfectly  even managers stop table tell excited he ordered because among best dishes personal favorite   My boyfriend ordered Fillet Mignon side bok choy  privilege taste both divine  fillet perfectly cooked again melted mouth  bok choy still nicely firm overcooked   The wine ordered bottle Forefront Cabernet Sauvignon which perfect pairing lamb fillet  Everything perfect   until decided walk over boyfriend wish happy birthday ear  briefly sat respectfully legs closed lap when GEORGE big boss restaurant quickly comes nowhere tell off lap because 8 year old child sitting near by  REALLY??? 8 year hasn't seen that! She wasn't even paying any attention us!

Well didn't anything comped which surprising bad experience then wait 10 minutes elevators start working again since shut off automatically when fire alarm off  thought going upstairs walk around but when saw crowd people observation deck waiting elevator walked back down wait lounge area  saying place bad just think price could definitely better don't wan't know pay $25 $30 person front row tickets fire alarm concert  <EOR> Amazing experience great place dine!

However did very delicious  fun dip cheesecake lollipop into different toppings adored banana bread pudding!  During meal woman comes around takes several  souvenir pictures  two taken together then just separately  pictures stunning strip background distance despite being overpriced boyfriend few  Two big pictures came nice album which front says Top World Stratosphere also tiny wallet sized versions which slightly cheaper    We ate leisurely enjoyed ourselves finally left happy full  able observation deck lounge afterwards extend your time which did    What really solidified TOTW wonderful place hitting ground again suddenly remembered Restaurant com giftcard $25 meant use but forgot! boyfriend called explained manager invited come right back he could apply discount  soon back he immediately helped completely friendly understanding  cannot tell happy made just made experience much better   It's best find place feel good gives happiness good service all found here  yourself favor splurge money would've just found itself slot machine anyhow right?   It really worth sit sky high above such beautiful usually busy city see calm perspective  coming back down heavenly view definitely felt different more relaxed now full great memories  <EOR> I made reservation 20 days before visiting Las Vegas  arrived time but made wait more 30 minutes  noticed all people arrived where already sited  spoke hostess but very rude attitude table next window just need wait 5 more minutes  let another couple first talking them reservation us  then back ask happening same answer cleaning table wait not apologetic all   then said No thanks walk away  Really expected    <EOR> This place must when visiting Vegas  Vegas several time 8 favorites  view gorgeous romantic  wait 30 minutes when arrived without reservations didnt mind wait  view deck drinks   ordered 14oz  Prime New York Steak Peppercorn Sauce husband ordered Duo 8oz  Canadian Lobster Tails White Wine Butter Sauce  food delicious  Service impeccable  <EOR> Went second day came into town vacation   nice restaurant great view   I started drink chocolate martini   best chocolate martini long time   The food good quality good bread 3 choices butters I liked sweeter one    both ordered seafood pasta pasta seemed fresh cooked al dente quality seafood good   shrimp large lobster chunks good pieces claw meat some places serve   did add some salt little sweet butter some parmesan cheese spruce pasta being somewhat bland     I full dessert would gotten something   With dinner purchase also permitted top meal receipt look out   nice once later evening   A very expensive meal but overall great experience  <EOR> Great service  But seriously can't hit temp steak  Ordered 4 steaks med rare 3 4 came med  <EOR> After planning last minute Vegas wedding very little restaurant research really any research general found ourselves here   basically made reservation just before coming in fabulous window seat seated early!  Service impeccable greeted owner thanked coming restaurant food delicious well presented    The reason come obviously rotating 360 degree view Las Vegas   prices very high end but paying more atmosphere less actual food itself although really delicious cooked liking    also second level lounge live music not sure if every night just weekends     We wearing wedding dress suit clearly enjoying fabulous wedding dinner  staff super friendly complimentary although kind thought might throw freebie but am kidding nothing free Vegas!  Beware really nice photographer lady if swept away ambiance might sucked into buying photos which million dollars     The elevator staff very knowledgeable without guidance would never able navigate place  also bit trivia facts you   fun!   Best night life! if vegas should eat do someone else's dime if can! <EOR> Have serval times different friends  prefer lunch dinner since see entire vegas better  Also lunch price more reasonable dinner less crowed  burger prefix three courses  Food taste good service always good! come back every time new friend town  <EOR> If your going Vegas need eat restaurant  view breath taking   food incredible   fake wife faked married chapel across street only Elvis! filet mignon which far best life time   Seafood delicious   Everything delicious   Service great! Best Vegas experience ever  won't regret it  <EOR> If you're looking good deal look elsewhere  But if you're willing splurge bit you'll rewarded more just dinner but entire experience  Top World located around 106th floor Stratosphere hotel rotating dining room giving fantastic views all Las Vegas  menu gives few different choices but largely overpriced  However $90 tasting option best way go  start off soup salad then proceed through three other courses including peppered salmon delicious desserts  Although don't usually spend big dinners Vegas recommend giving place try just once  definitely wine pairings only little bit more! <EOR> So glad chose dine here! view course amazing food delicious  tenderloin tender perfectly cooked  sides come huge portions definitely big enough share  two different potato dishes neither finished half either  say walk monorail stop Stratosphere interesting  walk itself isn't bad maybe 10 minutes but doesn't seem best area  Its nothing would wanted walk alone! <EOR> Celebrated anniversary loved view staff!
