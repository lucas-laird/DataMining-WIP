This place called New Asian sister location Jones Spring mountain  Just let tell reserved table 13 people table  Mind new restaurant  ordered 9 things  Peking duck green beans beef chow fun Chinese meatloaf beef brisket hot pot few other things  food came slow no taste  everything came some things weren't even placed  guests happy neither I  fill own tea pot cause people don't know doing  Save yourself don't eat here  <EOR> This sister restaurant Tunc Ky Jones Blvd  restaurant 4+ star rating Yelp very rightly deservedly so    This restaurant opened 6 1 18  wife 6 2  many wait staff all running around heads cut off  Food service slow some dishes OK some terribly good  figured new restaurant symptom    This evening 6 10 18 decided give another try  Since sister restaurant caters mostly Cantonese style noodle dishes BBQ Pork Char Siu type food hoping place offer some real Cantonese Chinese dishes    Boy disappointed  First ordered live Crab dish US$45  order few minutes later waiter came advised today run live crab  Can't next door across street super market buy some live crabs??  Then wanted steam fish  only sea water live fish 3+ pounds  $33+ pound two way much  declined     We ordered three dishes total Vegetable Chow Mein pure F   Portion small virtually no green vegetable only mushrooms sprouts  Worst all totally TASTELESS    Beef Brisket Curry Sauce clay pot sauce good flavor  But brisket tasty suspect braised brisket first then cooked curry sauce  ideal method    Three Treasure sizzling platter only dish rate A taste  But plating dish presentation awful  Without biting into food cannot tell tofu meat?? eggplant meat??   Pricing place quite upscale  three dishes together over $55  Many other local Chinese restaurants would charge less    One thing sure if want Wonton soup Porridge Chow Fun Chow Mein would come here  old Tunc Ky Jones   Personally haven't given place  wait month try them again some seafood   Hopefully time may stuff together  <EOR> The food items pricey! taste just okay below average price pay   The decorations good though but food overly salty  great discounts salt where shipment from? Cos need stock some salts kitchen too  It also funny seeing chef wearing medals when he's walking around allowed kitchen? just show?  Lastly party 5 force charged 15% tips bill   Definitely going back old location more quality cheap food  <EOR> I should read reviews before coming place   other said place way over priced quality   fried rice tasty all   soup noodle soggy   appetizer $9 only few pieces could tell just put freezer seeing part frosting bite   If didn't signing saying Grand Opening thought place long time decoration being 80s   Definitely going back again  <EOR> I usually original Asian Bbq location takeout but finally decided try new place driving past many times  Grand opening June 1 first impression observations listed below   Pluses Larger parking area Same good tasting Chinese Bbq Spacious clean interior Friendly Chinese hostess also speak English I saw mostly Asian people dining inside which usually implies food authentic Accepts credit card  Minuses High prices High prices higher sister location Higher prices especially common dishes would probably cost several dollars less other Chinese restaurants same area Uh did mention high prices? If going pricey then expect fantastic food just average above average value hard earned cash   All ordered whole duck $28 1 lb roast pork belly $18 1 strip Bbq pork $7 1 Salt N Pepper pork chops $15 more little stunned when saw bill  takeout 4 people but geez maybe understand spending $73 dinner but lunch! food ordered delicious though service fine  However if same roast duck pork belly Chinese bbq pork original location less think continue head over to go orders only come New Asian Bbq if feel splurging occasional eat in experience  torn between giving them 3 star instead 4 star but prices only reason why would reluctant return deducting just star feels fair enough  <EOR> Me cousin brother decided try Asian BBQ's second location located Decatur Spring Mountain across small SF Supermarket   came lunch June 13 2018 around 2 p m  course greeted saw some familiar employees first Asian BBQ   It took couple minutes decide order because two menus Lunch Menu  Whole Day Menu  kind shocked only bbq but served many different kinds seafood chinese cuisine but disappointed some items unavailable   We ordered Salty Fish Chicken Fried Rice Wonton Noodle Seafood 3 BBQ Combo We Roasted Duck Roasted Pork Belly BBQ Pork The food tasted good no complaints service  All servers nice friendly needed while there  <EOR> I came restaurant last month but saw Cockroach Vegetable Dish very disappointed going anymore!!! Ok <EOR> I waited 2 weeks grand opening try place cause usually first weeks chaotic you're going good services quality foods   love foods original restaurant Asian Bbq noodle but stopped going cause parking bitch restaurant small feel maneuvering through maze cramped tables people just some roast duck  new location parking decent but then again time lunch rush way before dinner time   inside much bigger spacious move about  best part? roast items front right when walk door  Now come order take wait order ready without getting way servers  Let's foods  looked all day menu same offerings original location plus seafood much overwhelmed me  dishes never even heard but looked yummy though  section dim sum items but X off  assuming offer later once work kinks being new restaurant  Since lunch ended getting usuals  foods still amazing first location! service amazing well  servers very attentive would occasionally come ask if needed anything which find rare most asian restaurants   Overall very happy able Tung Ky foods again  Restaurant big clean decent parking service awesome   definitely come back dinner try seafood dishes  *This place accepts credit cards whereas other cash only  business hours posted door currently 11am 11pm  <EOR> Really expensive   Decent cantonese style food   But really wouldnt back again since many other choices competition chinese food thats similar and or better wirhout feeling stiffed bill bad date   wok way   <EOR>
