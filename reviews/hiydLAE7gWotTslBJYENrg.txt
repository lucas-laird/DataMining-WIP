I'm typically fan fusion but really enjoyed Kaba Curry  If think traditional Japanese curry then you're missing point  <EOR> This very good place eat where curry fix  only problem closed when everything else says open <EOR> Was ok    not wowed!   4 drinks wanted of    also ran straws    place only does curry should well stocked    mean don't order much    First impression having most basic things kinda bad     curry good but tasted box grocery store   fried rice mushy tasteless   croquet corn beef hash good   Spam katsu tasted burnt brown    looked old   everything plate brown    even though ordered extra curry still kinda little bit   Felt just gave enough cover plate   pay  50 spice which kinda weird  <EOR> I informed similar Coco ichibanya Curry House back home hawaii but still held little bit hoping close  getting food wasn't disappointing it REALLY good but reminded Daichi Ramen's curry   Portions alright service good she checked pretty often took care well   Only thing wait time party 14 3 4 people working kitchen  know work food industry somewhat frustrating such sudden rush come  why pretty lenient waiting   Main verdict would definitely come again  First impressions good food good well looking forward filling stamp card! <EOR> I would 2 5 stars if could way    So lets start off good  Taste food? Pretty good  Very similar most Japanese restaurant's curry  Whatever fried stayed crispy  Nothing bad but nothing extraordinary either    Service good   I felt prices little high considering portion sizes  Everyone knows everything Hawaii more expensive mainland  However could same curry plate  double portion still cheaper kaba curry  Simple things just adding little more rice more curry sauce would just plate look fuller customers feel they're getting great deal  Rice sauce most inexpensive things restaurant don't feel people need stingy those  Just little comparison ichiza beef curry around $8 loaded beef vegetables rice never finish all always some lunch tmrw well  Here   I paid same price basically just curry sauce rice katsu cleaned plate off still felt hungry    The atmosphere super awkward well! don't wanna offend ppl into cosplay world but    I felt restaurant mini convention that! Everyone bright colored wigs dressed anime playing magic cards! wasn't even Halloween! only normal customers there  just awkward! seems they're friends owners cuz even behind counter freely  felt another world just wanted finish food leave  mean if you're into those kinda things don't mind place packed cosplay ppl then sure maybe you'll atmosphere  But wasn't me    I'll stick ichiza  More food buck don't feel another world there  <EOR> I really location  place very spacious  music playing background which its own atmosphere    The food really good especially udon which order lot  portion size because feel guilty leaving any behind  customize your order same old thing ordered past  prices reasonable since figure much want spend  plenty different drinks plate combos desserts    It does take awhile food but having group friends pass time then notice food being served  worth trip! <EOR> I've watched small window shop grow into awesome restaurant  service always great owners servers friendly most def remember when come back! food innovative island flair very tasty  come back often  never leave without having chantilly kaba cakes  Mmmmmmmmm  <EOR> Walked thurs night busy whatsoever  friend only ones seated actual restaurant area while several others already eating drinking bar  Food took literally 35 minutes let remind only ones seating area restaurant  Expecting AMAZING considering wait time instead left very disappointed    Tonkatsu skimped portions Marinated beef tasted looked simple ground hamburger nothing special  Curry prob best thing plate but quite skimped well   Not mention food came cold  Save your time goto Zenn curry  Sry Kaba don't thjnk back again! <EOR> Service Staff wonderful easy find clean establishment food course delicious  place big hit kids  definitely back more Japanese curry splash Hawaiian flavor  <EOR> Kaba Curry best curry  Everything great!

Their menu fairly simple  First row your pick Rice + Curry Cheese Fries + Curry Fried Rice + Curry Curry Udon  Second row choice spice level if want spicy regular non spicy charge 50 cents  Third section sides which ranges chicken katsu sausages etc average 2 3 dollars per side no limit many sides course long willing pay XD   Fourth section toppings corn mushrooms etc  Bottom section drinks    Simple easy  Pick your selection down sections your order    NOTE ! Yelp check free side topping ! Saves 3 4 bux if katsu side !   I gotten cheese fries + curry chicken katsu fried egg imagination being over easy egg if broke yummy gooey yolk flow over katsu fries !!! When order came actually little surprised small was  no expectation size beforehand but guess hoping larger because hungry XD ! Fries nice crispy  Curry itself nice  super seasoned some other curries but ok not much fan japanese curry   gonna add spicy but decided against because try original flavor before any changes =P said before ordered egg but egg little cooked compared hoped for  maybe over medium vs over easy wanted XD no ooey gooey goodness over stuff =[ sad haha jk kinda =X lol best thing surprise chicken katsu  despite being $3 if free yelp check in 1 piece chicken katsu  surprised juicy moist chicken was  Props chef owner pulling off !!

Thumbs up! <EOR> I used love Kaba Curry when Charleston   curry sauce tasty craved every often   But since moved new location definitely same   don't know if came off day but curry good time around   thick concentrated taste   Maybe curry sauce reboiled remixed few days   can't put finger but just didn't seem right   ordered tonkatsu karaage kurobuta soseji Berkshire pork sausage toppings extra rice   tonkatsu karaage quite tender juicy but could even tell any extra rice plate   wife did order extra rice plate looked same mine   She garlic chicken chicken katsu toppings   chicken cooked perfectly quite moist delicious   But because curry sauce very good took away well made meats were   3 stars only time  think would give place more try because used love curry sauce   hoping next time better  <EOR> Let's start no idea good Japanese curry is  Wouldn't know if slapped face  But know tastes good did   I came Tien ordered roti salad shrimp curry mashed potato croquette pork katsu ?

Recommended if want try something new less traditional sense   We also tried Curry Udon which essentially udon noodles curry broth   thin enough drink soup without being overpowering   flavor good but combination little different   Give try if looking something different   And finish try Pumpkin Kaba Cakes  pretty awesome! steam cakes come super moist rich delicious!  highlight meal along flavorful curry Check if craving curry!
