Thanks! <EOR> The first time  Outback mother  She loves steak would spend time together eating meal cztching up  Every time eat same thing  rack lamb apple chutney baked potato   Outback great service good food nice atmosphere  love eating memories lamb  Sweet succulent lamb  <EOR> I written review restaurant over 4 years terrible experience brought retirement  Let's through timeline    We walked almost empty restaurant only 4 5 tables seated  hostess talking someone bar upon seeing wife she shuffled back without any emotion asked many party then led table  She clearly enjoys job especially since she didn't crack smile whole time    Our waitress pleasant enough  She took orders then commended trying good food selections my wife yeast dairy allergy sure good trying be   bit patronizing but engaging  She really top making sure waters refilled  both ordered sirloin steaks medium rare   When food arrived both cut into steaks discover wife's solid rare borderline raw while mine slightly more cooked rare  cold middle mine least warm  When waitress came back requested cooked temperature cook ordered  She then proceeded argue if knew medium rare meant pulled menu explain each cook level means  She ultimately decided warm rare less cooked wife's almost raw steak proceeded take steaks back she could them both cooked medium well  Why medium well ask? Good question      I am toddler nor imbecile  Apparently steakhouse different understanding beef cooked rest food industry  apparently also policy if customer doesn't cooked argue them convert steak into borderline shoe leather  steak came back practically well done chewy bland  wife's came back medium least some juices left it    We never frequent pathetic steakhouse again  Stay away unless want belittled your choices want shoe leather instead steaks  warned  <EOR> I really really hate give location 2 star rating eaten quite often steaks always good can't say enough good side loaded baked potatoes!  BUT tonight husband myself decided try prime rib   BIG mistake!  ordered 20 ounce medium rare   When arrived red pink but red thought kidding!  happen love rare meat sort barbarian decided give try   hard cut big steak knives when did piece cut tried chew tough didn't know whether try swallow spit out!  My husband asked if wanted send back cooked further said going help strands unchewable fat running through it   Instead boxed brought home Jake he could care cooked tough he's Australian Shepherd eats anything spaghetti pickles he loved prime rib   Unfortunately did love never order again!  Sorry Outback Steakhouse but really goofed one!

Really people working closer 5 star 4    Now if kitchen could just prepare meals more line Aussie Outback less high school cafeteria flavor appearance! <EOR> No Rules Just right     Right?    Wrong  !! Ok used biggest Outback fan would given them 5 stars all day long but something special Outback general faded  used good steak reasonable if cheap price  extraordinary but now just ordinary  first opened near 3 times first week cause reasonably priced  all franchise staying business prices always increase but most meals $10 $15 bucks more portion sizes seem smaller all add ons really drive cost hurry  still Outback still pretty good but mainly cause girlfriend loves it  <EOR> Ordered online pickup 12 37 PM  present curbside takeout 12 45 PM  Waited 5 minutes no came even say hi  Tried calling over store could hold anyone  leave  Horrible customer service  Could even food  never location again  Worst Outback experience ever  <EOR> Is imagination place gone little downhill??  food good but service left lot desired   First waiter forgot bring soup  Then server tried bring lamb chops   When did entrees brought rib eye when specifically ordered 12oz prime rib!!  When ordered he didn't even ask wanted prime rib attention before meal brought tell him   partly fault though   We seated near door traffic coming cold  food cold really fast same reason  hoping just unlucky inept waiter  did let know displeased tip left him  <EOR> Consistently good food excellent service   Ribeye cooked ordered great flavor good quality steak   No wait Wednesday evening but most tables occupied   wait staff efficient friendly helped dining experience enjoyable  <EOR> Went today lunch promptly seated drink order taken right away received bread   both ribeye melt lunch combo but only comes side soup salad potatoe veggie  think would better side plus soup salad  But alas ordered another side along soup  ribeye melt absolutely delicious highly recommend  server Tony he very nice guy some humour mixed in  back again! <EOR> Get wings fried extra crispy!!!! baked potato soup  to   and love it  <EOR> Great steak!
