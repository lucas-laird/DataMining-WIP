Great spot check long night clubbing post work cocktails off Strip  <EOR> Private parking lot does extremely crowded since its shared other restaurants businesses   Is just does place SMELL stinky toilet bathroom??? And talking outside mean inside   It really slow Wednesday night  I hear gets really busy poppin other nights but bad vegas!  Came some quick drinks food   Their happy hour pretty good  $5 ALL drinks excluding premium liquor   Decided remy coke $5 each  But unfortunately cups super small paying half drink   Tried bulgogi fries  okay  much nacho cheese sauce   Overall place okay  <EOR> Came group just drank soju  ordered peach yogurt watermelon   liked yogurt best   order watermelon again bit sour   really good happy hour food looks legit   also karaoke rooms bar few tables front   chill place drink  <EOR> No longer named Zizzy but now called Western Soondae small restaurant features all traditional Korean food favorites   place looks very dark outside heavily tinted windows but actually quite well lit small dining room inside bar    Apparently used go to spots Vegas karaoke drinks but now seems much quieter more family friendly featuring full meals table service just appetizers drinks   no idea if still karaoke seeing no singing tonight     All three Hot Spicy Threaded Beef Soup which very tasty   Fearing worst asked only medium spicy honestly wish kept mouth shut since soup missing characteristic delicious BURN love Korean soups   Each giant bowl seriously where did find bowls HUGE?? served small bowl white rice side   also served 3 different kinds homemade pickles kimchi banchan small side cold japchae   banchan japchae absolutely delicious only wish offered more them throughout meal accustomed all other Korean restaurants ever to   and refill water container table   server very kind older Korean man but extent interaction consisted taking order dropping off food table when ready   only people restaurant half meal he spent entire time dropping off food somewhere back completely sight only reappearing when other customers all Korean arrived   Maybe he very confident English because he very friendly engaging Korean customers bit he us   Thankfully food very good no reason call back table except empty water container   any rate believe definitely back future try other items menu especially since open until 4 am!! <EOR> Feels Ktown LA  really enjoyed place when came here! wish did karaoke but hanging bar fun too    We ordered yogurt peach mango soju! All tasted great sugary  bartender great too! He very attentive great talk to    We ordered bulgogi fries wasn't favorite   Otherwise love place! <EOR> This kind odd place  Perhaps just early but only 3 other people think all friends bartender server  bar rather small couple booths then course kareoke rooms  90s 2000s hip hop playing which appreciated but surprised me  Wedding Crashers playing TVs No Strings Attached other  No complaints but again strange    The best thing bathroom clean actually smelled strongly bleach  good thing because dropped cell phone toilet  Eeeek!!!!! truly horrified but if bathroom nasty may sacrifice it  Luckily phone survived   Anyway wouldn't way return but could worse  <EOR> Zizzy's came clutch seeking some Korean grub also karaoke Las Vegas' Chinatown  called made reservations Thursday night came just case  Upon coming nobody which fine   sweet! utensils provided initially 2 people but party 4 ask more  menu selection sort weak  Unfortunately two things wanted didn't bummer    Overall place fun  enjoyed 3 hours karaoke private room sharing apps having drinks  $15 hr karaoke room Happy hour 6 9 Yummy potstickers soft crunch warm tasty dipping sauce! Sampler just okay 2 mozzarella sticks 2 jalapeno poppers French fries 4 onion rings DRINKS ordered beer cocktail he didn't know cocktail listed menu but told recipe googling it  Yummy bulgogi fries opted regular bulgogi but he suggested fries because he no rice bulgogi entree order No lemon parmesan wings tried wings honey mustard bbq sauces   wings good Mango soju pitcher delicious down smooth Friendly owner!! <EOR> Oh Zizzy! best places few drinks  only karaoke once  Most time just hang bar munch some food    Speaking food best bulgogi fries tasted Las Vegas! Don't let those terrible pictures yelp destroy your appetite most likely due dark lighting try some yourself  also just regular fries which good fried chicken which just ok    The best time come happy hour yourself yogurt soju bulgogi fries = good time friends! <EOR> This place great small 4 medium 10 groups potentially larger  great food  Try Korean BBQ Platter  comes sizzling fajitas Chillis  happy hour specials great even thought long wait times there's small lobby booths sit wait    I best birthday celebration here  fantastic venue people come let loose  <EOR> This review strictly karaoke    I past Saturday group 4 girls  Someone group reserved private room which costed $20 hour super reasonable  rooms decent size hold 12 people comfortably  only downside selection songs  incredibly outdated won't find much variety  mostly pop classic rock  really looking forward singing some Shania but no  here    With updates place could easily become 4 stars but now I'd skip it  <EOR> I felt need rockstar lol ended room  When first walked female bartender said karaoke rooms full  bathroom saw empty room  Shouldn't she check before saying that? male employee said room available shortly after  tiny place maybe 5 7 rooms? took forever drinks  pressed service button few times no came  bar bartender looked flustered wasn't very helpful ask male employee   A lot songs would stop middle  told male bartender  He didn't seem care told tell other employee  guess he felt bad later came reset finally worked  male employees wasn't bartender nice   The only good thing place chicken wings  need work service skills because clearly lacking sure machines working  <EOR> So place super fun  music trendy  drinks cheap  But food good time but boyfriend food poisoning chicken  <EOR> This place fun!  prices fine drinks standard price  pretty good happy hour extensive drink menu  Great time go   The people behind bar nice friendly  Although ignored button room didn't work   fine tho just someone order drinks brought them all back us   The videos kinda weird play but good laugh talk about  good selection songs but need add more   Some classics weren't programmed bummer  But plenty other songs  Mostly all pop classic 80's 90's   The room fine size fun lights little hot but uncomfortable   If u karaoke drinks would say place go! <EOR> This used Vegas locals spot Karaoke Drinks    Staff actually friends friends friends worked time time staff always nice owners   Drinks Good prices good pours   Venue Looks very small but actually far back enough allow few rooms place  Place just simple small bar waiting area   Would come back if friends wanting check out  <EOR> Went last night smelled ass no exaggerations   smell hit soon walked door  can't even begin explain bad smell was  mix broken bathroom rotten eggs  hate leaving bad reviews but bad  surprised few people bar  isn't type smell going away either  Something seriously wrong  Word advise stay away   or least stay outside  <EOR> It's first time here  Friend ours Brian  Said place new sound really good  came tried out  arrive around 8 30 left around 1 30  Within 5 hours two grey goose cirque peach vodka  all singed fun  Good thing environment clean neat friendly  Most KTV lounge disgusted nasty bathroom  location bathroom clean   Will back soon! <EOR> This actually pretty cool karaoke place only ever other karaoke place wasn't private room nice private room everyone hear also came end happy hour saved some money!
