Imagine those meat rolls 7 11 idea   Just greasy low grade sausage meat   friend's bacon no better   eggs hash browns ok but toast cheap pork products inedible   Maybe try $5 burger next time maybe just pass elsewhere  <EOR> What does five bucks days? answer is very much  Perhaps box Girl Scout cookies maybe crappy watered down well drink your grandpa's favorite dive     Well some great news friends  Rather throwing your last Lincoln black hoping best save last fiver dead president treat burger beer Cafe Cortez  cross heart hope die stick needle eye  no lie folks   Is great burger? don't ask question here  Instead ask something bad burger edible? Yes! Cooked well served all standard fixin's delivered side sass guilt overworked waitress    So beer must awful right? Nuh uh! You'll sippin' style when wash beef bomb down ice cold Tanaya Creek Vegas' finest craft brews   Good ya Cafe Cortez  <EOR> As Jabba Hutt would say  this kind scum  place old skanky Vegas good way   Yeah higher end casino's strip nice obviously even millionaire can't afford everything Vegas offer   But some places rest give good cheap meal harken back days when things ran bit differant Vegas   those places meal probably hasn't changed last 40 years   myself took Vegas Weekly recommendation Matzah Ball soup dissappointed   Top off piece lemon meringue pie     even sat bench waiting vehicle sat old lady nice chat  <EOR> I don't know any other place where tasty thick prepared burger chips your choice soda coffee beer only $5  right $5 repeat $5 bucks!  If said know place besides Cafe Cortez you're reading right said thick tasty burger   also suggest Prime Rib special under $10  Served way comes horseradish peas choice baked potato rice locals' favorite  Even busy day waiters know don't need request your drink refills  bad all downtown's oldest! <EOR> Seeing 3am Saturday Sunday morning lol only appropriate try El Cortez Cafe which heard better coffee shops city   I ordered french toast came quickly huge side syrup butter   Even layering still more 3 4 container left!
