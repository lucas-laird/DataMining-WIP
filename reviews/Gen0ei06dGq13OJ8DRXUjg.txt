Before reading please understand low salt intake family  when say no salt seasoning means literally none   It tasteless  Utterly bereft seasoning  calzone which supposed mushrooms basil tomato cheese literally no basil it  fresh even dry  No salt no pepper no seasoning ALL   just threw stuff basically steam cooked it The mushrooms tomatoes undercooked  calzone 7 inches tall because didnt cook right  hense fillings being steamed  I would sent back but realized wasn't just meal tasteless  husbands pizza mediocre best again practically flavorless sauce    Our childs mac n cheese just some bland gross cheese sauce poured over pasta  am pretty sure cheese sauce pre packaged glop  Velveta mac n cheese more flavor    would say velveta much salt but seriously did put ANY salt pepper seasoning any kind cheese sauce? If want mac n cheese easy way just give pre packaged stuff admit it   It flavorless thought feeding nursing home food  But think even would some Italian seasoning  Honestly does your chef even know cook Italian?  The bread tastey hard mess bread  ate bread calzone crust gusto    server excellent  Friendly prompt  did complain meal restaurant because didnt want server any possible backlash  Also because knew lack seasoning must chronic issue  <EOR> The only pizza beats book Malnati's deep dish Chicago! That gets 10 if you're looking scale The Good The sauce seasoned beautifully cheese doesn't overpower toppings   sausage great plenty pie    They deliver casino hotels    Prices line most pizza     It's really yummy!   The Bad The delivery people never delivered same area twice! mean ordered pizza 3 times week yup kids! once delivered elevator area once lobby third time concierge   Where hell Waldo pizza? might easier spot if he wearing striped shirt stocking hat!  I'm much wing eater but handsome wing man is   He said meh wings but scarfed pizza pie he hadn't eaten week! No leftovers that    One star off delivery confusion meh wings    The Ugly You'll home crave it    A final note It's just dang good pie! Order but give detailed instructions where meet if you're casino hotel  Carry your cell when going down meet them you'll need it! <EOR> We ordered Loop first happy it  pizza great flavor  Then ran into pineapple which didn't order  But worst 12 year old daughter took bite bit into large piece cardboard cooked into pizza  wonder else may carelessly tossed into pizza family may eaten  Pictures posted  piece cardboard paired Metros own cheese cup scale  <EOR> I really pizza best tried Vegas but haven't tried many   only third pizza place would stop  but  service bad    delivery  charge $10 pizza came over 30 minutes late   pizza also over priced think would lot more customers if bit more pleasant better prices  <EOR> We've patron Metro long time  always real consistant  come expect good meal always! three locations amd always same until last night!  We dinner Tropicana location  sit right away took drink order came back quickly food order but guy never wrote down  generally big eaters order lot last night no exception    We asked baked zitti meat sauce sandwich 1 2 clam 1 2 sausage pepperoni mushroom pizza   burnt pizza!

I gave two since filled drinks often enough friendly but food junk  Hopefully next time right! <EOR> We large sausage mushroom pizza last night  Good flavors fresh tasting ingredients cooked properly  really enjoyed but left wanting more all said done   In opinion price high side $22 large wasn't quite big should when comparing some competitors   To sum up    Quality ingredients good taste small size bit overpriced  <EOR> Specially if u town friends relly want take them metro pizza good great quality sause    and if order garlic bread   I guaranteed u never see garlic bread same     we huge pizza $40 small bar but cool hung beer fave far    <EOR> I've always heard Metro Pizza Vegas institution yet seemed no knew ever there  never but mainly because always afraid try non chain pizza places here   Alas recently neighborhood hungry some money blow  Perfect scenario try something new amirite?
