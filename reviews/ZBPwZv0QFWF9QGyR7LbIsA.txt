Friendly courteous staff! Clean! Wonderful food! Great prices! Under $10 person! back thank you! <EOR> I've before remember being good food decent service   Stopped recently family again   seated right away   While walking table did notice half tables  full dirty dishes   No seems bus tables here     So ordered rice dish pork chop eggloaf shredded pork   good  actually liked pork chop   nice sweet glaze it   Wifey son simple bowl pho   parents each ordered pho also   Each item $7 99   So while waiting food noticed 3 little kids cleaning tables   youngest probably 4 5 no joke  wife like    WTF?!  After served which didn't take long   But then again restaurant pretty empty   ask bill   didn't give actual bill   guy just told total $51 dollars   actually did some calculating while eating   ordered 5 items $7 99 each  So thats $39 95   Tax rate restaurants Vegas 8 1%   comes $43 18   heck did he $51 dollars?  Whatever   just paid left   Afterwards read some other reviews restaurant found only time restaurant ripped off customer   Apparently overcharge several customers regularly   To matters worse learned afterwards shut down long ago health department   kidding me?!  There's video them Dirty Dining   Check out   So decent food   But kids cleaning tables overcharged food shut down health department    definite NO RETURN book  <EOR> When find place become loyal customer  Pho Little Saigon Eastern Serene favorite pho restaurant area   Food delicious  know want employees since become regular  Kim knows give when walk in  Hai takes very good care well  love appreciate when walk employees know treat regular  familiar want food    Not fancy place but good place me  bring everyone when crave pho  <EOR> Eating several times yet disappointed  flavor breath delicious comes generous amount meat  Probably better most places far serving size considered  <EOR> there 3 Pho places between sunrdige hieights 2 15 know of  Pho Mai lan Pho Saigon 8 place  3 far best  Pho most authentic 3  Pho mai lan just plain beef broth no real Pho flavor  Pho Saigon 8 some reason broth bit sour if taste before adding noodles meat veggies once add those things its good but still doesn't true Pho flavor   place Pho Little Saigon definitely place when am lazy own traditional Vietnamese food home  just wish delivered!!!

I'd never boba added mine before  Love it!  The space if larger anticipated  Very clean  uncomfortably quiet when Friday evening   sure if typical if busier during lunch  staff pleasant  Very soft spoken mild mannered  seemed did want interrupt diners once served sure ask check when you're ready it    We'll back sure! <EOR> Ate couple times  food its alright  guess  little Pricey! service kind wack me  just sit around your cant find them damn re fill    Just keep truckin' next spot! hahaa! <EOR> I ordered pho meat tasted wasnt cooked  told waiter he replied shouldn't ordered   Worst pho ever!!! <EOR> This very delicious pho restaurant  stopped lunch both ordered pho  workers very friendly helpful seemed everyone family which nice  coming back again sure! <EOR> I come pho   Anything else mediocre   Most times order inside take home   eaten before but kind dingy inside plus almost always empty   The wait staff friendly enough prices average   Unfortunately past few times ordered well done brisket pieces meat far more fat actual meat   broth tasty to go orders come abundance veggies  nice least   If found closer place better broth I'd probably because don't driving far when sick which when am most likely pick pho   <EOR> Love coming boyfriend would order pho course would bring iPad watch little movie restaurant while enjoy meal  soup came piping hot fresh ingredients side  Everyone very friendly  Didn't mind place look but pho point  all matters SERVICE        recently brought family Pho little Saigon first time  supposed Out  But ended coming here  didn't expect pho soup big    bad thing GREAT THING!
