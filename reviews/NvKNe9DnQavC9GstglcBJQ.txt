$8 would almost covered tip still left waiter   <EOR> If craving pho then highly recommend try Zen noodles  fantastic! sure plenty lemongrass soup broth which wasn't salty all  Definitely cheaper getting pho Zine! <EOR> We came 10 45 am ordered two burgers sandwich waitress Christina told might them available since still breakfast time  Then switched some breakfast items however kid started crying he doesn't want eggs another waitress ask if order burgers  She checked kitchen guys told order them gonna take them 15 min make  Then waitress Christina came told wanna switch back burgers  She said cannot since they've already started order  What?!?!? gave wrong info first place now don't wanna anything keep your customers happy? She very rude unprofessional very bad attitude supposed take place 5 star property such Venetian Palazzo  She literally ruined good impression whole experience Palazzo  <EOR> I would given them 5 stars but wait unreasonably long first server somewhat sullen  cousin sister breakfast during recent weekend trip Vegas  wait long absolutely starving time food  good 45 50 minutes ordered  didn't seem many servers working but would think noon Saturday should pretty well staffed    As quality food very tasty  scrambled eggs bacon hash browns toast  hash browns cooked perfectly  sister cousin also ordered similar breakfasts happy theirs well    The service only ok  first server kind uninterested never came back let know much longer meals  Then shift change second server came over refilled drinks kept checking wait food  much more satisfied him    The menu little confusing kind long  there's section says only serve breakfast morning but other sections shows different breakfast menu under lunch late night which could organized less confusing way   All all meal cooked well left happy full  <EOR> This really GREAT place come really decent food really decent price! We ate three times trip breakfast lunch dinner all same day! But all three times food better expected service really good! Try pasta dishes!  It's little bit loud because really large restaurant but menu something suit anyone staff excellent!  Plus free bread every meal! <EOR> If you've hankering breakfast 2am don't mind heading Venetian then Grand Lux Cafe place be   Bacon eggs hash browns toast may sound drab but when cooked perfection nothing short amazing for your tastebuds least    Craving something sweeter? Belgian waffles whipped cream side strawberries should trick    Yeah other items menu but trying wide variety entrees breakfast choices far most satisfying  <EOR> Did miss something here?  Grand Lux Cafe Chicago along time ago but remembered absolutely loved it   also never bad experience Cheesecake Factory   Grand Lux twice during stay Venetian   first time breakfast where breakfast buffet option   orange juice really good tasted freshly squeezed   fruit offered buffet line also tasted fresh decent selection   other buffet offering pretty standard   offered hash browns scrambled eggs sausage bacon way oily   also omelet station but did made because line long hungry!  also assortment pastries but would rather seen pancakes waffles instead   also disappointed see did cottage cheese which thought breakfast buffet staple   Everything cost $20 including tax tip but amount money would see more buffet options   The second time late night dining   started broccoli cheddar soup which RUNNY BLAND did come crackers bread until requested it   chicken waffles main dish   waffle itself pretty good   good crunchy texture buttery taste   chicken also decent but should point chicken tenders fried chicken bone   served pecan maple syrup   never authentic chicken waffles but feeling original would lot better GLC upscale version  <EOR> This last meal ate Vegas because sick eating buffets then  Didn't any research non buffets came recommendation aunt  Place little hard find because signs Venetion Palazzo weren't helpful  Even though casino packed no line when seated almost immediately  waiter forgot bring bread didn't any until main courses arrived  ordered Sunday night pasta which basically spaghetti but steak short ribs instead ground beef  Don't wrong pretty good but really something would pay $15 dollars for  can't really tell meat better since pasta sauce stronger taste  dad's dish other hand excellent  He ordered slow roasted short ribs fantastic full flavor juicy tender  place really deserves 3 5 stars but guess bump 4 since decor pretty nice  <EOR> The food alllllright  prefer Cheesecake Factory  service good bread butter serve beginning delicious! <EOR> Great food   Huge variety  Open 24 7  Generally good service     But slow times   eat every time Vegas Venetian     Which little more often should  <EOR> Grand Lux Cafe good place eat if indecisive eat because offer extensive list dishes  want steaks it  want Asian too  want Cajun yessir!

AWESOME! Fast seating well should if you're rolling 3 4 am morning! Wide variety choices choose Clean dimmed light ambiance roomy Being loud drunk talking expected AGAIN YOU'RE VEGAS! Attentive waiters Large portions starting $12 $$ entrees I'd suggest sharing your meal because always end taking half back your hotel eat next day anyways! Cons Bathrooms outside restaurant casino  All in all great go to spot while you're Vegas want decent food other your typical late night Dennys stop club  <EOR> I heard Grand Lux before first visit   disappointed   best Patty Melt fries ever had   Hot crispy juicy cheesy   Yum     If sex food item now know is   Creme Brulee awesome   give both Vanilla Chocolate   Crispy opening cool creamyness     I definately back try other items huge menu   may call man whore but Creme Brulee mine everytime! <EOR> Wonderful food! pot roast divine! mention server absolutely wonderful  Would recommend  <EOR> I always liked place over years until last weekend when entire meal horrible  took 15 minutes before server even came table   I've always ordered pot roast but thie time dry pretty much burnt I sent back admitted having issues it The salad ordered place  soggy tomatoes just ruined it   The others party impressed food either The worst part specificly Venitian eat recomendation nobody left happy   The manager did come  try smooth things over but bad taste already mouths!  Also while seated bar low booth birds eye view overweight 40 ish woman booty shorts whose legs spead eagle  high tables across us When she wasnt showing everyone goods she rubbing companions crotch bare foot! If I'd able actually eat food I'd probably thrown up!  I wish could still love place but can't anymore  <EOR> Had dinner family last night Las Vegas  server Joey very polite helpful  food amazing gr8 value $$ spent  recommend sharing your meals portion sizes enormous  Good ambience very family friendly  Strongly recommend Chicken Parmesean Beef Wellington  <EOR> Food super delicious!!! But services sucked  Took 15 min them bring back coffee 20 min bill  <EOR> If could only give place 0 stars would  Long story short better hope don't redhead Sierra your waitress  manager duty just terrible if worse  Let tell why    Now don't wrong boyfriend ALWAYS loved dining past  But time around don't know changed but certainly left HATING place   We came Wednesday night   My boyfriend seated found initial server quite awkward seemingly uninterested obtaining orders  20 minutes waiting he finally comes around tells undergoing shift change asked if new server around yet  Nope  Nothing yet  But  fine should understandable given shift change right? He then takes orders before he leaves   So initial server leaves literally waited another 30 minutes before food came wasn't until 10 minutes some lady decides finally come ask everything tasting  sorry    but you? Oh  right    must server?   At table across observe lady husband getting just irritated lack service same waitress elapsed time waiting food   Fast forward all ridiculous waiting almost non existent server she finally comes around give bill  never irritated such service lack entire life am usually patient between boyfriend might add also used servers    Silly decide take manager leaving    he could any less disinterested! Sierra comes along see what's going because SURE she knows crappy service she delivered begin complain she just gives don't time look dismissed unapologetic manager    He showed no remorse whatsoever  All did complain lack service simple apology would sufficed  boyfriend BOTH servers past  don't care if you're having bad day you're just slow heck running behind    still say SORRY   Now don't know if manager just didn't take seriously since didn't wear big girl pants heels night maybe he thinks just some child trying comped meal knows??   But current nurse past waitress would see he would feel if he patient customer complaining issues just stared blankly no remorse reaction   But anyway    vent session over lol  Hopefully everyone's experience MUCH better ours <EOR> We came late snack watching Mystere Cirque du Soleil  start order midnight   Food OMG! Huge portion! love fried calamari entree  actually feed 4 people    We red velvet cake dessert  good  still bit cold set room temperature light soft expected   I also ordered chocolate martini  nice expected  No ever fail making chocolate martini far Service awesome! don't know waiter nice cheerful even midnight!  Price value money because its huge portion   Tips table outside near fence  great people watching  <EOR> The restaurant reeked cleaning chemicals gave all friends headaches   Brunch buffet options scrambled eggs hash browns pancakes fruit plate pastries omelet station  short exact opposite Vegas buffet for    essentially same price could gone Wicked Spoon instead place fantastic   TLDR compensates pathetic buffet making feel sick eat  <EOR> Although missed breakfast 15 minutes   small but nice selection breakfast items along lunch menu  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed meals here  chicken avocado salad world delicious! Hazelnut dressing   Just yum!  back future  <EOR> Long wait line but always play some roulette blackjack casino tables right next Grand Lux   nice sanctuary madness casino floor   usually crispy chicken sandwich but salads pretty good   Once seated tables service surprisingly quick  <EOR> I aware restaurant part Cheesecake Factory but oh wow   menu extensive  extensive overwhelmed but nonetheless ordered lunch menu    sister Chicken Jambalaya  few expectations expecting impressed  Fortunately was  delicious  waitress said fans spicy dishes loved this therefore reluctant order but glad did  However waaay much rice    My brother ordered Margherita Pizza  tried small slice very good    Dad burgers forgot which one  HUGE  He eat fork knife but loved it    Mom enjoyed Chop House Salad  However big finish  <EOR> From breakfast dinner late night drunchies place go  menu fairly priced food great!

Or side  enclosed order your scrumptious food go! <EOR> Great service Grand Lux  late night supper 3 30 am food service top notch  Vegas never sleeps neither does Grand Lux because open 24 hours  5 stars all day long twice Sunday  <EOR> Believe all hype other reviewers place REALLY fantastic  Two people $100 gets outstanding meal tons dinner choices  5 5 stars same quality elsewhere would double price  TIP portions huge share! <EOR> Not bad is  wait long time server tho  food good would come back again reason gave 3 star long wait time wasn't even busy  <EOR> One star even much place service first when sitting took table right next kitchen door even though restaurant busy all then asked move she gave attitude all sitting 30 min no even came take order  Food great no complain but service horrible  <EOR> Great place dine  Good service food good  cedar plank BBQ salmon awesome  always order whenever town  <EOR> Pain butt lines if during convention   food better most breakfast places Venetian   If car Black Bear diner    yeah yeah know Grand Lux but Venetian doesn't care reviews many dumb schmucks eat restaurant anyway    food could taste fried a$$ would still sell   Luckily doesn't   service pretty good quick    food came hot ordered tasted great   probably 8th time eaten finally decided Yelp   don't eat cause best eat cause isn't much else better Venetican some weird reason all Vegas conferences held Palazzo ironically enough both Grand Lux Cafe      If company dime short time eat there  If Black Bear Cafe  I think Henderson maybe Vegas proper   forget   But chain CA freaking bomb!!! <EOR> I Palazzo delicious! Portions way big but i'd rather them big small  would think restaurant right off casino would kinda iffy but entire party impressed  drinks entrees desserts excellent! <EOR> I don't know why 2 Grand Lux's close each other but am fan way  Grand Lux similar cheesecake factory  portions very big good splitting  would recommend chicken parm which definitely feed 2  see gigantic waffles piled high whipped cream coming kitchen all time  desert excellent chocolate vanilla creme brulee  beignets very good well accompanying dipping sauces  <EOR> i love grand lux   type place where all your friends everyone find something menu   everything ever ordered great   usually crowded try early mornings late nights     the cocktails good   some favorite menu items bbq chicken pizza greek salad ask some grilled chicken top ahi tuna salad   think funny place owned cheesecake factory   similiar menu items but food much better!  serve bread warm unlike cheesecake factory  <EOR> Just finish ribs glass house red cab   bad meal late night just checking in  Price reasonable but dirt cheap if looking for   ribs tender fell off bone   But cheesecake factory all good it'll difficult order something doesn't taste good expensive   Certainly ans dining experience restricted vegas but business  <EOR> It's 2 37 am anti am writing review  When restaurant wasn't even greeted told seated certain time  another family waiting ahead pretty much just stood 15 mins until stop server ask long wait was  He said don't know don't know run computer   Awesome asked if he ask hostess he says yeah anyway seated 30 mins waiting being first time did know complimentary bread but when told server if any complimentary bread she says its upon request  Well would know whether complimentary bread  Atleast asking if first Time would helped  When manager brought food told service far horrible   He did apologize wait hostess letting know long wait bread he said why upon request  Yah if knew wouldn't asked! ITS FIRST TIME HERE  server same answer  Obviously if manager himself such poor customer service caNnot blame servers  food ok nothing special  big mouth if place telling everybody because saloon lot contact people but sure tell everyone horrible service received wouldn't recommend Anyone  <EOR> Massive portion size its very good food  Great veggie options too  If recall correctly open 24 7 but then again almost everything Vegas! Didn't try desserts  next agenda  <EOR> The food good but found piece ceramic salad  Heath hazard  wary place  Worst all charged food  Although goat cheese salad taken off charged other entree which couldn't eat seeing ceramic wife's plate  Expect better service hygiene <EOR> Grand lux convenient if your staying Venetian Palazzo  Great food reasonable price  big portions couldn't finish food  Great service too!

There several people line table worried we'd wait long time table but deceptively large only took 5 minutes them seat us   seated table 2 side long bench other side chairs   people next but enough room in out   Even though close people next didn't find hard hear each other couldn't hear anyones conversations except ladies right next us  such plus mind   The menu lots choices pasta salads sandwiches chicken dishes steaks etc   perfect place vegas when you're several people everyone wants just sushi italian     They bring nice warm bread and butter seating you   My husband both opted hamburgers  He Max burger short ribs burger hello! bacon cheese burger  easily substituted cheddar instead american   Burgers $12 13 each came fries organic green salad   This largest regular size restaurant burger ever also best had  truly looked if when ordered guy kitchen pulled some ground beef made patty hand   couldn't even quite finish 1 2 it   eat entire red robin burger   Seriously just delicious    Service wonderful  waitress seemed notice every time needed refill drinks quick check things going bring extra condiments wanted     This must eat place any future trips Vegas   Next time though we'll splitting burger haha! <EOR> Ate bar very good service Mai Tai's excellent   Lettuce wraps salads lasagna all very good  <EOR> Not satisfying experience today  Dry steak sandwich completely inedible  finally attention host manager replaced 20 minutes overcooked burger couldn't eat  expected lot better place  <EOR> Good breakfast option strip   Lots items available variety price points   Weekend buffet looked good but ordered off menu  <EOR> We ate Grand Lux before seeing Priscilla Queen Desert show  excellent start finish  decor beautiful seating nice booth enjoyed ambiance  shared mashed potato spring rolls pleasantly surprised size quality appetizer  delicious reasonably priced plentiful  then shared roast turkey brie sandwich   again delicious nicely sized  Also reasonably priced  strawberry lemonade wonderful blend seemed real strawberry puree good lemonade  more enough eat sharing each dish walked spending less $40 including 20% tip  All all complete winner  would happily eat again  <EOR> I twice during last trip    Sometimes lacking Vegas middle ground restaurant especially Venettian  want restaurant atmosphere but don't want pay $200 just meal two  Yet don't feel paying $15 greasy Philly Cheesesteak food court  Grand Lux your middle ground restaurant  Its owned creators Cheesecake Factory its basically same me  Different menu but still diverse extensive  Perfect when need something casual lot mouths feed   My first experience very pleasant  most attentive kind honest waiter years    and   he new!  When first ordered he made sure party knew portions generous  Personally when they're honest portions much sharing encouraged people smaller appetites even though could affect total tip   I ordered pasta requested no olives  kitchen made mistake added olives redo it  never saw plate olives because waiter caught before delivered me  He apologized repeatedly tardiness but fine since wasn't hurry he just nice   its hard upset  manager also came over apologize point  Finally pasta  just wish would clarify chicken chorizo menu difference since expecting large chunks slices chicken   I ended tipping guy almost 25% cash wished luck before he left  He such doll would take home   Second time went? Disaster! Snobby waiter giving horrific service  Ignored most time didn't fact couple members party wanted share meal  When he passing meals over he wouldn't even lean over hand mine he just held air reach it  Didn't refill drinks until getting ready leave! What's point then? Didn't even give party basket bread unlike tables surrounding us  Lazy!  However think he's just bad apple group  previous waiter great manager wasn't bad either   I would still just because nice something middle dining plus menu accommodates just anyone  you  just hope service good first visit  <EOR> Been coming past few years always must!

Food delicious Korean beef pancakes turkey brie sandwich fries each filling yet fresh weren't feeling heavy end meal  Note while Korean beef pancakes indeed delicious would hardly call Korean dish general Asian flavors such ginger soy sauce peanuts but Korean beef did taste sesame oil nor pear pancakes seemed more flour based traditional Korean pancake  The service lackluster opinion but let slide since find service tends downhill late night anyway due little staff available  Hostess nice quickly showed table  waiter did introduce himself offered complimentary bread which overheard other table because don't usually late night but option available  Water refilled throughout night check took while arrive table  <EOR> I friend's family celebration 21st birthday  Even though missed reservation because flight delayed happily accomodated late party allowing sit bar while prepared late night dining room  food delicious cocktails even better  waiter handled large party aplomb entire experience great  course food pricey but Vegas just stepped Cheesecake Factory should expect pay more want plate pasta  Think $17 pasta dishes $20+ meat entrees  <EOR> We ate twice loved both times  normally seek unique foodie experiences avoid chain restaurants plague naturally assumed when family wanted would settle it  Boy wrong     The first visit brunch Sunday am seated right away   Two kids Belgian waffles strawberries whip other Italian Market Sandwich  waffles good but sandwich amazing  son generously offered each small bite agreed best sandwich ever!

Wifey fish chips which didn't much kick it  another day late night dessert  little pricey but variety food  <EOR> I saw another review owned Cheesecake Factory hindsight total sense  Large variety choose no matter time day or night huge portions super tasty food  hubby come cream chicken soup which am typically fan  first time tried hesitant but since guaranteed love nothing lose  first bite okay second bite pretty good third bite sold! Now can't come LV without having least once  Outstanding service every time  <EOR> Grand Luxe Cafe Cheesecake Factory family great place family eat Vegas  portions VERY large which criticism all! appetizers great perfect sharing  Just careful appetizer good 3 4 people if you're also ordering entrees  Asian Nachos die! Omg am such fatso but really love them   Upon trip ordered HUGE salad devoured every bite  chicken avocado salad sounds basic but awesome  didn't love dressing word wise side  salad best ranch je pense  entrees but also reasonably priced sandwiches burgers especially Vegas hotels where everything super expensive     The waitress Petra very professional  She said portions large good sharing which helped order appropriately   Whenever am Venetian strongly look forward coming Grand Luxe Cafe mostly Asian Nachos  <EOR> Honestly hoping place would much better but really disappointed me  friends hungry 3 am Grand Lux Cafe open decided eat here    We seated within 5 minutes then waited while waiter  Finally ordered tomato soup expecting nice simple red soup maybe some basil  extremely disappointed when tomato soup came while later beans onions flavor spicy  soup chunky nothing tomato soup before  good cost 10 dollars something only able eat 1 4 of    I wish ordered sandwich salad because looked much better got  place does huge menu fault picking probably worst thing it    I would give place another chance but service really slow granted late just wish soup better  Overall least favorite meals long time should much better  <EOR> Zero help finding decent plant based meal  Front desk told place vegan menu when party 5 people found no options  Hash browns cannot fried anything but butter  Huevos Rancheros cannot made vegan  Only option chefs going allow order steamed vegetables bland much     It's 2018 Lux together  <EOR> If place down street California somewhere I'd give extra star   food's bad     But ain't great  And definitely doesn't live Vegas standards   add fact inside favorite hotel Venetian where constantly state food AMAZING  Grand Lux only establishment hotel pales comparison   It's coffeeshop atmosphere extremely large plenty seating   all years going Venetian only stood line twice so     usually seating available   There LOT menu much difficult pick   basic things bagel lox cream cheese fine   But hard bagel cream cheese? Other things club sandwich steak sandwich burgers all mediocre   HUGE yes but 12 dollar burger expect big taste huge Grand Lux gives huge   I keep eating every visit spite lack taste just because convenient  since stay hotel mood inviting nice but am consistently unimpressed food   Vegas   Impress me     give them all chances still  don't   Coffee blaaah case entire hotel service decent   Nothin' write home about   quick easy eating  Grand Lux Cafe okay   But your socks won't knocked off won't come moaning groaning won't wonder when next time eat definitely those CANNOT WAIT HOME YELP PLACE type restaurant   I uploaded some food photos took here  Believe me   looks better tastes  <EOR> I heard 24 hr restaurant Venetian but no clue expect   pleasantly surprised wasn't just some food court lookin place   Got around 3 am long night Tao ordered 3 egg breakfast   love breakfast  came potatoes toast  Best breakfast 3 am ever!! Could been   or Grey goose talkin?  Nonetheless yummy!  really type place dinner but breakfast hunger 3 am its perfect  <EOR> Beyond worth price breakfast buffet  paying those free continental breakfasts bed breakfast  <EOR> This Scottsdale's Grand Lux Cafe except just more expensive slightly more pretentious  came breakfast Eggs over medium ham hash browns   pretty standard but if could eat more often would   Waitress took long time order seemed she annoyed when asked if Starbucks close wanted decide if wanted coffee restaurant not    Kristopher red velvet pancakes side ham  should breakfast buffet since Kris's pancakes sweet he said tasted cake  figured would since velvet anything tends super sweet but now confirmed  $5 wine glass orange juice? No refills    I think could bumped 3 5 if wasn't outrageously overpriced if food sooner if she would smile just once  <EOR> It is   big ol' Cheesecake Factory type place  shrug Actually think menu may even near double size your average CF     quite feat   We ended convenience hungover shocking afternoon   Service slow but typically large menu helpful any particular cravings might have     really something everyone     We try chili because made short ribs freakin' kobe ground beef   Hard pass up   good but ridiculasly salty    Also tried patty melt parmesan bread    greasy    even hangover    but if sort thing it     If you're looking really great meal place but convenient good families large groups    Just don't come expecting greatness anything  <EOR> The Grand Lux Margarita really excellent drink best margaritas ever had   The Grilled Steak Sandwich tender flavorful perfectly toasted roll   salad mine rather fries fresh varied dressing light tasty vinaigrette   The complimentary bread light sourdough wonderful crisp crust   In general prices extremely modest considering fact Las Vegas   Husband ate lunch around $50 included cocktail  <EOR> We stayed Venetian discovered hidden jewel little late stay good!!!!

As added bonus open late takeout service  <EOR> I came Grand Lux Café most recent travel Las Vegas  9 pm starving  Grand Lux Café did disappoint  shared burger which came fries  more enough two share  saw many people leaving to go boxes determined them  We'll back Grand Lux Café next time we're Vegas   2016 Review #61 <EOR> I ate because saw Larry Flint eating there  There's part restaurant juts outdoor area towards casino  he barely bothering keep mouth closed he chewed  though he glazed over look he ate think he enjoyed food because he finished everything including table bread  place designed more mid west palette everything just little bit much  salad dressing just little sweet salmon just little smoked etc  still taste great going down just lacking diversity  <EOR> Why two star? Bc food? No  Bc wait seated? No   This 17th trip Vegas 8th eating but overall worst service ever ever ever LV   To preface boring story girlfriend EASIEST people wait on  don't ask lots questions start please end thank never give wait staff hard time anything ever   We ordered two iced teas sliders mashed potato egg rolls  Hey 1am  Anyways drinks ok  But he never comes back refill them     ever! finished them before meals  He brings food guess fault didn't ask more    dry cups weren't sign  Nonetheless he drops off food disappears into night caped crusader  Meanwhile he waits table directly next us  He 1  Didn't refill drinks  2  Asked if needed condiments 3  Check back all  4  Didn't bring bill clear plates until nicely attention  He earned $2 25 tip $30 check  I'd never ever ever tip under 18% ever ever but guy shit  shouldn't ask refill  bring food see empty refill it    doing last 200 years  least should check once  didn't  suck  pass collect 20%   I blame ass waiter restaurant  first time received poor service here  <EOR> Ok place just really awesome   Open 24 hours day?  most convenient thing ever especially Vegas   Eating food night club definite must let all alcohol sink in   food absolutely amazing too   only amazing because drunk?

Cheesecake Factory liked place  very very similar  menu lil bit different price same  interior decor same also   Great place dine if no where else go  But wouldn't first choice since other places better unique only Vegas  <EOR> I say pretty disappointed service  seated right away but took 20 minutes server come us  actually ask another server water ask manager before even being contacted  Manager barley apologized  Horrible service  Decent food  <EOR> My friend wanted place eat Strip because exploring day  found place which decently priced good menu items  around noon everyone getting lunch time  Also annual meeting AAOS Venetian everyone decided eat restaurant  However wait only seven minutes which awesome!  We decided try lunch specials but concerned portions would small since normally nicer restaurant portions filling    I ordered Lunch Rustic Pizza Salad $11 95 Mango Margarita $10 75   friend Lunch Chicken Special Chicken Parmesan $12 95 Strawberry Margarita also $10 75     When plates came shocked much food given  full end meal  Would filling average sized man? Probably not  But good sized portion price   The only cons ask complimentary bread which waitress brought right away she great! margaritas little flavorless opinion  next time would opt margaritas  <EOR> I've couple meals Grand Lux Cafe on both Venetian side Palazzo side VERY impressed quickly move patrons restaurant waiting line very long     but never feel rushed while eating   In last experience waiter above beyond  Since choose eat gluten free ordered egg white omelet asked if could substitute toast fresh fruit  He said could substitute fruit hash browns but toast  passed toast but did order hash browns  took longer expected eggs it 30 minutes he came back table just before food came said sorry delay your food but wanted talk chef before putting your order sure hash browns ok     just sure didn't put bread anything them because know they're just plain potatoes  impressed he made effort!  While waiting food watching efficient wait staff bus reset tables  man resetting table next next guest he putting side bread plates noticed piece paper plates like receipt washing instructions new box china   wondered if he would notice soon he finished he took last look table saw paper looked if say that? only removed paper but also replaced plate clean plate   What attention detail!

I also appreciated long hours   guess being Vegas location all easy them open early early enough stay open later   But guess close proximity elevators long hours full fast   Full enough cause 2 long lines   which never quite understood why 2 lines begin with   If don't mind taking food which easiest thing when line long head over left area which kind looks cafe   order Grand Lux takeout there  <EOR> SAVE YOURSELF! EAT unless bugs !   After long flight checking into hotel Venetian wanted quick easy food  boyfriend ordered 7 7 taking big gulp he realized probably 50 75 bugs floating it!

Yes slightly pricey but more average great service! <EOR> I'm shocked many 4 5 star ratings restaurant  Perhaps server just hated table  He really rushing order even though wasn't very busy  Sunday July 8 2012 around 7 30pm  seated quickly but table didn't even place settings all 7 us  server took order pleasant enough but  where service ended  he disappeared 45 minutes food nowhere sight  order consisted 3 breakfast entrees enchiladas 1 burger 1 salad hot entree nothing ordinary difficult    Once food finally arrived just ok  bad but nothing memorable  felt food should outstanding long waited but just so so    I won't going back place long waits mediocre food    Our server never even acknowledged food took over 45 minutes  Rude!  The only upside prices reasonable  <EOR> Have Cheesecake Factory? If should know expect place  While don't serve exact same dishes essentially same type food portions price   Like most places Vegas casinos difficult find  casino level near escalators connect casino floor Venetian Shops    This no means 'must eat' place Vegas but if you're nearby looking meal  better Denny's but cheaper Tao then give place try   If rating place based off most recent visit I'd only give them 2 stars because food took forever come when did cold  But generously gave them 3 stars because other times wasn't problem  Perhaps time day when visited  think sat server's section just she off    Finally other Yelper's said good pancakes but sadly didn't try them despite intense post Vegas night cravings because stop making pancakes 11am  But Belgian waffles all day  <EOR> First time Vegas   first restaurant to   Just below Tao Grand Lux Cafe  They're open pretty late if 24 hours  friend took late munchies TAO  only Fettuccine Alfredo which delicious   The price average  However service good would expect be  would assume because people usually come wee hours drunk  don't need provide excellent customer service   I possibly would dine again but just end some buffet  <EOR> My first real dining experience Las Vegas loved it!  server spectacular  perhaps BEST service ever received restaurant   She suggested fantastic appetizer fried mashed potato rolls terrific  pasta dinners both excellent cheesecake really best ever eaten  lot cheesecake!

He did say dinner portion bigger  full flavor though ate until no longer could! second time came breakfast ordered biscuits gravy gravy side because total weirdo  biscuits felt very heavy but flaky buttery! also came eggs delicious smashed potatoes! Some friends ordered chilaquiles which also try AMAZING!!!!!! could probably eat alone forever happy  Definitely can't wait return! <EOR> There better place Las Vegas drunk late night affordable food   Grand Lux good breakfast its good lunch its great late night always come back when need food fix don't want crappy food some dumpy strip location  <EOR> Ahhhh mazing food  Really good service!!! I family  3 if vegetarians would eat meat  The vegetarian menu although less but did lot customizations!   Delicious veggie burgers enchiladas  Really great mimosas! waffle die for  chorizo breakfast enchilada stupendous   Their portion sizes really big order accordingly  order came little late freshly baked bread eat kept busy   All all good place lunch brunch    Goods great food drinks! Great customizations amazing service  think Laura laurel great server   Bads little expensive side  <EOR> Huge portions good food very affordable prices!  asian nachos appetizer great unlike anything before   chicken short rib combo meal finished maybe half it   little silly give such huge portions since most Vegas hotels don't mini fridges room all extra food going waste   sure check place if you're tired buffets overpriced mediocre restaurants  <EOR> You know place awesome if salad dressing served gravy boat! delicious food extraordinary service Grand Lux Venetian also open 24 hours! Note Palazzo does close around 2 3 am   and why connected casinos need 2 Grand Lux's each end again? If breakfast buffet you're craving Grand Lux lays hearty display hot cold breakfast items + beverage reasonable $16 50 served until 11 weekdays 12 30 weekends Though during brunch hours both bf love breakfast foods wanted filling lunch  Pasta Carbonara lunch combo opted fresh organic side salad ranch dressing GRAVY BOAT! always hesitant ordering Pasta Carbonara afraid overall taste dish come sweet but Grand Lux did Pasta Carbonara right! savory   but overly salty hint sweet bacon  love ginormous entree!  I've always heard Grand Lux described upgraded Cheesecake Factory expecting higher prices  Surprisingly sister restaurant chains comparable if identical pricing schemes   Service top notch! don't remember waitress' name but she made feel comfortable  She came every 5 minutes but complete opposite intrusive  She also kept apologizing wait wait? didn't even notice food taking longer usual letting know food would soon  manager even came table separate occasion apologized more food delay    There many great dining options along Strip Grand Lux being them  Though realistically eating every time visit Vegas now spots top list! <EOR> Great menu  food service excellent   nice spot take break eat some good food <EOR> It's basically Cheesecake Factory actually think part same chain but better dishes IMO  pasta carbonara food coma goodness! bf burger melt although greasy  greasy delicious! Burger melt all right cheeses thousand island sauce NOM! fries nice crispy  also duck potstickers which didn't blow mind but interesting twist regular pork potstickers    Good spot dining any hour day    means thank goodness open 24 7 your clubbin' munchies! <EOR> I wait half hour steak 1 The prime top sirloin dry 1  Most likely won't come back  <EOR> The girls super duper hungry many places opened late night near hotel   place reminds Cheesecake factory due decor extensive menu  don't remember specifics ordered but pizza salad wings just okay  nothing wowed about   Just happy food stomach  <EOR> Talk burger! Order Grand lux burger big need 2 people finish it   Everything ordered table pretty good overall   food great gave large portions too   Definitely best cafes Las Vegas quick bite  <EOR> It's servers fucking retarded 2AM  1 server going snail's pace  knew wanted order menus closed where fuck she?! 2 She talked stupid  Don't assume ordering something wrong drunk dumbass  probably your fault can't hear just ask repeat myself 3 Party 9 yes fucking know there's gratuity added  bill  But when ask 10 dollars card because rather cash tip asshole  Don't fucking run card tack gratuity! 4 going stereotype own race all Asian know fucking math  aren't going shiest your bill don't fucking tell we're short 57 cents! WE'RE SHORT BECAUSE DON'T KNOW ADD  server pull OWN wallet pay money back  EMBARASSING   Denny's does better job they're even high end!

I ordered Cafe Beef Wellingtons  steak flavorful medium rare just way asked! dish full lightly sweetened vegetables brussel sprouts mashed potatoes carrots offset semi salty filet medallions    Although entree good dessert wasn't par  sister chocolate molten lava cake served vanilla ice cream  presented beautifully  However ice cream extremely frozen point where struggle just spoonful  Fudge exploded middle just way should but barely any cake  outside did consistency cake  Rather more chocolate cookie  lining very chewy while outside hard   Besides food service friendly moment walked till moment left  Everything done very timely manner! <EOR> My bf came late dinner pleasantly surprised good food was  yelped apparently place created owners Cheese Cake Factory thought okay should decent  bf Chicken Parmesan he still talking days ate there  Pasta Fresca which normally wouldn't ordered but feeling extra crappy because bug caught didn't want eat any meat perfect time  would definitely back  bad don't SF    Good food decent price place wouldn't expect Venetian! <EOR> This place 24 7 Venetian   line but wanted maybe 10 15 minutes around 3 30am holiday weekend   We came just small snack   tried french fries Boston cream pie   There free bread butter   pretty average   maybe notch above cheesecake factory   We french fries   eh little different cheesecake but almost same  weren't crisp usually cheesecake factory  portion small cost 4 50   still better most other diner cafes hour   The boston cream pie decent     The burgers sounded good knowing they're good cheesecake factory better damn good here  also nice selection steaks  full try them but wasn't impressed place    I'd only come late night   <EOR> I usually stay Venetian full day traveling Grand Lux Cafe place go  You'd figure all restaurants snack kiosks around why would someone visit same restaurant twice? Well first all first restaurant see walking your elevator    also because great food affordable prices   They three menus rotate throughout day  There's morning 6 AM 11 AM lunch 11 AM 12 PM late night 12 PM 6 AM menu  Each menu serves variety breakfast platters sandwiches burgers pasta dishes  two same restaurants somewhere area check hours cause think does close down few hours   Oh more word advice if plan eating call reservation gets pretty packed throughout day! <EOR> Excellent lunch vegetarian burger huge satisfying  husband liked Reuben burger split slice key lime pie! Come early lunch because line later  Nice place sit waited fighting crowds strip  <EOR> 3 5  Stars  We arrived Vegas pretty late found Lux go to restaurant late food without having stroll down strip  restaurant actually really hard find because entered through Palazzo didn't know two wandered off Venetian which people say better one  turns if enter through Venetian front entrance your right past Bellini Bar right next JuiceFarm  definitely reminded upgraded version Cheescake factory dimmer environment but better food service  menu just big Cheesecake menu took awhile figure type food wanted eat before asked recommendations  Because came late didn't wait seated but still surprised busy weekday afterhours    They gave complementary bread right oven start while looked over menu  waiter able give pasta selections because wanted something heavy before passed long drive  ended getting Sunday Night Pasta which delicious  noodles liked meat sauce really good chunks beef short rib just enough parmesan top off  mom Lemon Chicken Piccata really disappointing  sauce salty chicken really dry  actually felt bad mom switched plates because she hasn't come Vegas couple years didn't want disappointing first meal   Service point waiter checking often making sure water cups never empty  Overall besides Piccata experience above average! <EOR> Came Tuesday night sat bar where very nice bartender named Tina served immediately  Thoroughly enjoyed warm grilled chicken salad passion fruit ginger mocktail pictures attached   Salad perfectly dressed  not much dressing dry  chicken well seasoned too!

I would've given them 5 stars but waitress came back twice tell they've ran ordered   ended getting full bread getting food 1 1 2 hours ordered   However taste food prices made wait   Yum  <EOR> We came breakfast every day while Vegas mostly because conveniently located close hotel wanted shopping gambling ASAP    We tried eggs benedict breakfast sandwich corned beef hash  star show definitely corned beef hash  use huge chunks corned beef none stuff can! shared some family loved too! eggs benedict okay couldn't put finger missing  may slice ham thin something missing hollandaise  Regardless food good enough keep coming back!

Good service reasonable prices  <EOR> It first night Las Vegas  weaved casinos losing track time space few hours stomachs begged nourishment  problem? 3am  walked strip discouraged quick stop places open even Dennys conversation but alas slithered through another casino seemed place open business place Grand Lux Cafe  restaurant could used better lighting but then again could seen romantic atmosphere  Perhaps much patrons table next ours may gotten lost own world forgot other people around them hear bedroom conversations   never met woman before but now great knowledge working woman parts  did lose appetite quite quickly luckily decided take meals back hotel but can't complain much Vegas!  Pros Best fettuccine Alfredo ever eaten life  Open late  Fast seating service   Cons very noisy  But c'mon Vegas baby! <EOR> This place used decent would come couple times each vegas trip  However past 2 times service horrible  point thought forgot table because does take 15mins just drinks lol wtf  food normally okay nothing great just variety  dont plan ever going back Grand Sux Cafe  <EOR> I love Grand Lux Cafe! first time came second dinner first dinner ended much disappointment some cafe Wynn before watching show ugh never again   ordered seared ahi tuna salad portion salad large couldn't finish I eat lot   Service also friendly attentive  Ordered another salad second time came back but wasn't good ahi tuna salad  bread start off though excellent  eat wheat days    Anyway to go spot late night eating Vegas would say way better Cheesecake factory  <EOR> Because stayed Palazzo working nearby came Grand Lux every day satisfying breakfast   Portion sizes hearty food tasty! ordered different omelettes each time  made own omelettes list toppings max 4 well ordered chorizo cheese omelette fresh garden omelette crab asparagus omelette   The chorizo cheese bursting flavor but little oily greasy especially breakfast  Between all omelettes definitely boldest flavor  Something willing skip first thing morning    I liked both build your own fresh garden omelettes fresh hearty nutritious! Definitely nice kick start morning!   Crab Asparagus omelette tasty but bit waste  tomatoes asparagus cheese simple awesomeee together  Unfortunately overshadowed any presence crab  Sure could see little crab meat pieces but expected seafood y sweetness comes crab buried under other flavors omelette   All omelettes came generous side toast + jam butter!   Def recommend hearty fresh breakfast! <EOR> I enjoyed breakfast hubby Saturday December  around 9 30ish am no wait all  hostess took table bar area  waitress very nice suggested breakfast brunch $24 99 which kindly declined  mind focused fried chicken waffles  waffle light fluffy topped pieces pecan fried chicken shaped sticks  fried chicken sticks coated panko seasoned very well  Overall enjoyed breakfast  waitress very good refills coffee water soda  would come back again dinner  FYI parking Palazzo free now  <EOR> Decent restaurant hotel breakfast  buffet tucked off side but small crowded people top each other  <EOR> Seeing gluten free options made decide gove Gamd Lux try  Gluten free pasta good  service friendly well  would liked try some other restaurants R The Venetian but weren't other gluten free options   would come back again  <EOR> The Grand Lux Cafe favorite restaurants inside Venetian  food always consistent prices reasonable  breakfast lunch dinner before  Each time leave happy stomach money left pocket  There's lot variety menu  enjoy having omelettes during breakfast average price around $13  Some fast food places food court charge more that  Lunch averages around $20 dinner around $30    The other day tried Caramel Chicken delicious  chicken nice crisp sauce really well white rice  opinion almost everything menu acceptable  burgers good  omelettes morning tasty  always trouble ordering because everything sounds tasty  seriously can't wrong Grand Lux    To top good food friendly services  servers always attentive efficient when comes customer service  said least 4 times now never left disappointed  <EOR> Go those beignets donut thingies dipping sauces  all  Puts Cafe DuMonde fried greasy funnel cake type beignets SHAME    Would back Vegas those ALONE  P S  famed Sunday night pasta just OK   grandma's Italian Italians know am talking <EOR> Back day when lived Vegas go to late night dining spot  late night menu plenty variety everything always good  Now whenever town usually find myself there  Staff consistently good  visit kitchen even made favorite flatbread chicken sandwich even though wasn't included late night menu  Ranch amazing  husband chicken waffles says best he'd ever tasted friend's corned beef hash delicious!

Due decided dine other establishments team see Nora's Italian Cuisine review when return yearly tournaments   plenty restaurants accommodate us  <EOR>    yea friends hungry hence gotta eat right?  aside slamming ourselves vegas buffet decided Grand Lux since reasonably priced lies within prestigious hotel Venetian     well gotta say food pretty good although came kinda slow wasn't even crowded   alas when food came wolfed down there's no tomorrow   definitely hit spot!  waiter fairly attentive portions pretty big   all satisfied feast   anyway despite longer usual wait think tad better time friends because couple smiles some grandma sitting next table peers   heck if bigger set kahones i'd bust game probably score sugar mama   hey vegas!  verdict fair wait time good food reasonable price full tummy       no sugar mama though <EOR> Being huge Cheesecake Factory fan am always excited see sister restaurant Grand Lux   staying Venetian glad close elevators   The service friendly though slow when all drunks come in   Food yummy   reccommend Enchiladas well Chicken Waffles     On Sundays perhaps Saturdays well breakfast buffet some limited breakfast items omelet bar   good deal if just want basics  <EOR> I think owned Cheesecake Factory?

Simply wait time order having meal served long  Tuesday waited least 1 2 hour burger Friday took even longer that  If busy understand that  size menu which quite massive diverse certainly adds additional challenges  However place dead weeknight still waited long  knocks down bit   Otherwise I'd definitely recommend it  <EOR> Came grab breakfast Tuesday 8am  offer Grand Lux Express breakfast $18 95 pp great value  potatoes breakfast meats pastries fresh fruit omelettes scrambled eggs toast bagels waffles  also includes orange juice coffee  food service fast good! definitely recommend grabbing fulling breakfast here  <EOR> Enjoyed several meals last Vegas away  Very relaxing place enjoy quiet meal  <EOR> This great 24 hour cafe  Perfect soaking all alcohol being all night partying Las Vegas  fast efficient service good food  Only took 15 minutes time ordered until food party 8  ordered DeLux breakfast sandwich hash browns hold tomato  Scrambled eggs ham bacon topped havarti cheese brioche bread  bit greasy but delicious  Ordered ranch dressing side which very tasty  <EOR> Do love Cheesecake Factory?

Everyone party extremely pleased food Kobe Meatballs Kobe Burger Chicken Pot Pie Sandwich service here! impressed price vs  quality food  don't down strip all often but would definitely recommend restaurant anyone headed into near Venetian! <EOR> Growing always stayed Venetian whenever took family trip Vegas  such fond memories restaurant  when group 13 looking place grab lunch Sunday course recommended here   To dismay all remembered be  food general low quality opposite side spectrum fresh juicy meal    The fried chicken tasted sitting warmer few hours macaroni cheese really bland dry top my boyfriend recommended dig into middle parts eat stale pieces top  shouldn't that!! Salisbury steak tasted just come frozen food box   My favorite part meal iced tea  5 5 iced tea  <EOR> Every time come mouth only wants eat two things Sunday night pasta Grand Lux burger melt  Sunday night pasta comes perfectly made spaghettini marinated short rib literally melts when chewing  burger melt best patty melts caramelized onions thousand island sauce thick juicy beef patty parmesan cheese bread  Man drooling right now just dreaming it  <EOR> When younger lot more frugal fancy place good meal   absolutely loved it   Now eaten afford fancier Venetian restaurants just A OK   restaurant also unnecessarily dark   would've preferred little lighting table   I fettucini alfredo which insanely heavy extra broccolini sundried tomatoes did lighten up   felt little full this   I remembered really great food nickel dime   recommend those budget but general probably wouldn't come back unless its to go menu  <EOR> If fan Cheesecake Factory then trip Grand Luxe Cafe should your list when Vegas    Owned Cheesecake Factory see similarities  Solid plates served panache but comfort food twist it  Everything big tasty! Menu large if can't find something eat then might well just candy bar  Plus those great slices cheescake made parent company   I love coming lunch getting half sandwich soup special  Also comes salad  Great deal $10 more enough plate satisfy  Also many salads burgers sandwiches much more choose from  Decent prices here   Plus actual place large beautifully decorated  lot attention detail into planning location  Another cool thing seat fake front outside patio area people watch  Sometimes see real freak show walk Vegas where anything goes! <EOR> Basically smaller version Cheesecake Factory well owned them hahaha   but some reason whole lot better!   I've Cheesecake Factory plenty times felt relatively over priced measley portions offer  However Grand Lux shares just same menu but pricing portions worth cost   While friends staying Venetian Grand Lux Cafe basically go to spot food regardless time circumstance since course open 24 hours  Incredibly convenient especially city Vegas!  I tried couple different things don't often order restaurants Braised Yankee Pot Roast Veal Saltimbocca    Now pot roast just ANYWHERE but Grand Lux prepared well  Normally your run of the mill restaurants Pot Roast description says slow roasted until tender ends being all dry chewy  Grand Lux's version different story could've sworn meat tender butter savory possibly be  vegetables fresh buttery though wasn't fond yams  Not yam guy sue me  The Veal Saltimbocca pretty much Chicken Cordon Bleu but nice twist  veal done just right prosciutto Fontina cheese complimented well  Throw well balanced mixture Parmesan breadcrumbs herbs you've classic mainstay dish your hands  angel hair pasta wine sauce grounded dish very well though personally thought little oily   I believe Grand Lux those restaurants just stop if you're ever Vegas especially since open 24 hours  whether need some food sober partying little hard Tao would nice breakfast talk over plans day friends highly recommend Grand Lux Cafe!  Quan <EOR> Stopped Sunday around 2am  Just looking quick bite before calling night  Plenty seating hour  Service good exception   waiter order wrong but didn't even notice till later  ordered Smoked Salmon scrambled eggs onions  However Smoked Salmon platter  still tasted good  <EOR> All say ASIAN NACHOS! best late night snack find Vegas  <EOR> For hotel food  open 24hrs really can't wrong here  drunchies food isn't bad  They've large selection your typical American food burgers sandwiches salads  gotten breakfast plates good  eggs fluffy bacon crisp bread just enough butter it  sandwiches good too  fries taste frozen point came pretty soggy but sandwich itself wasn't bad  super packed during day I'd say if you're looking food during day explore something  special Las Vegas Brgr Steak eat buffet  Save place late night food when come back gambling night strip  <EOR> i LOVE place!  Try anything menu   it's similar Cheesecake Factory   i usually dancing Tao cuz open 24 hours   I wish LA same hours operation   Their strawberry shortcake to die for!! Once free dessert because server dropped plate food near table  wasn't even order but felt bad happening near gave dessert  Great service huh  <EOR> We tried breakfast buffet  good value price   No cheese menu  Strawberries gone bad   Orange juice awsome freshly squeezed delicious <EOR> If eat thing  eat waffles!

My dad whose trip U S  very first Western world very picky food  almost gave hope he would any restaurant food order him  He doesn't eat beef lamb narrowed choices least made life bit easier  ordered Cajun flavor chicken dad surprisingly he LOVED it   The rest ginger beef Thai salad  Everything delicious especially pleasing because waiter Rick awesome  parents couldn't better words him  <EOR> The service great 3 30 morning  If enjoy Cheese cake factory then its half sister  setting floors bread everything almost same  would delicious  No complaints  sandwich ok side salad home made vinaigrette excellent  turkey bacon sandwich  didn't finish all kept half go  French fries good  <EOR> If plan drinking all day try avoid skipping breakfast  help survive day  Moreover could possibly run into awesome breakfast spot! Though only spent short amount time vegas confidently say Grand Lux best meal over weekend would mind coming back all    Their breakfast includes assortment morning cocktails omelets pancakes waffles even all you can eat buffet  left enough room stomach night before surely would've opted buffet  Instead decided upon Joe's Scramble ground beef onions mushrooms spinach side hash browns toast   The menu says thing only $12 which means probably puny  quick work this  Or thought  waitress returned rather hefty plate food  eggs packed hearty chunks mushrooms onions spinach ground beef  much didn't even finish  Moreover scramble pretty tasty! Eggs weren't watery all nor overcooked  browns perfectly crisp top moist underneath  only real gripe meal toast moist flimsy  fan    Still pretty solid meal would gladly pay same amount omelet even back home  glad closest breakfast option  If you're area looking morning meal check Grand Lux Cafe! <EOR> This Cheesecake Factory's older sister  Cheesecake Factory favorite places stuff face knew wouldn't disappointed Grand Lux wasn't  Oh lets see  inside Venetian directly off casino  patio also inside seating  sat patio which looks off into slot machine land  waitress' name December thought cute! she point  bring bread Cheesecake Factory but BETTER if imagine that  pot roast cheese fries Lord God himself soft tacos pork filling  can't remember friendgirl she shoveling mouth know good  Then order beignet DELICIOUS!!! came chocolate sauce whiskey sauce raspberry sauce  Oh good!

Finally we're seated ready eat  number times before  Usually some late night grub  food isn't spectacular  very regular omelette no bells whistles guy very regular sandwich  food standard cafe fair  food ok just nothing amazing  If area I'd probably prefer First Food Bar amazing strip views fun bar foods but good alternative well  lots desserts check those well  <EOR> After night Hakkasan headed back hotel Venetian  Before going bed wanted meal stopped Grand Lux  already 3am very few customers  Yet took forever few mediocre burgers  sure hold since weren't asking anything special  entire meal uninspired time consuming  If you're hungry middle night suggest somewhere else  <EOR> They serve good food location just other locations   only gave 3 stars because waits usually very long gets very crowded   also closer casino where smoke really bothersome   much prefer waiting without all smoke     They also did beignets location   location atmosphere Palazzo much nicer food Palazzo location just yummy! <EOR> Food good service terrible wait took 45 minutes then half food cold if want breakfast buffet recommend happened twice two days <EOR> After walking around seemed eternity decided stop Grand Lux Cafe lunch  Right away cafe reminded Cheesecake Factory  doing little research found Grand Lux Cafe actually owned same owner Cheesecake Factory  Figures because decor pretty identical   Anyway vast menu really gave headache  just much choose from  Shrimp scampi?! Barbecued pork sandwich?! Pasta grilled chicken tomato basil mozzarella?! Enchilada?! even pho! took awhile decide Madeira chicken which really good  came sauteed chicken breast asparagus mozzarella topped mushroom Madeira sauce  also served side mashed potatoes  chicken breast surprisingly tender mashed potatoes nice creamy  pretty decent granted chain restaurant  don't recommend pho though friend ordered looked pretty gross  bean sprouts basil supposed complement pho all wilted browned  Pho would last thing she would ordered American restaurant but she wanted some soup nothing else soupy menu    Our waitress polite but she didn't come table often  completely understandable she lot tables tend to  <EOR> 5AM 3 college students hungry desperate unwilling take another taxi  shuffled over Treasure Island Grand Lux Cafe Venetian seriously surprised  Huge portions good excellent flavors  Quite busy 5AM   Definitely list late night options while Vegas! <EOR> More upscale Cheesecake Factory literally same owners  Brings precision love your favorite dishes avocado chipotle burger chicken pot pie Asian chicken salad some creative flair Asian nachos amazing     Great if you're looking solid meal kick off your adventures  3rd time visit due convenience late hours haha    Generous portions friendly environment  <EOR> Paid$30 prime stake knife couldn't cut through   Jaw hurt trying chew through it  <EOR> Never eaten Grand Lux Cafe many times weekend but there's reason why because good convenient  stayed Venetian hotel only place open 24 7 great late night eats  food court tiring many visits  menu extensive try something new every time  came lunch day many ordered lunch special such great deal  $10 bucks cup soup side salad half sandwich  All friends said enjoyed ordered  opted pay $2 more side salad half pasta combo  Even half regular pasta entrée lot eat lunch even take go  Cabonara pasta tasty! Loaded cream sauce which love hate dry pastas boost flavor bits bacon green peas  Because Vegas top off your meal cocktail! Blood Orange Mojito excellent choice! fries die for  seems simple common thing but fires keep coming back  Maybe there's special oil cook them because richer sweeter taste  They're just ordinary fries but dip bit ranch ketchup you'll chomping away whole plate fries before know it! Service also never fails always friendly quick despite being super crowded all time  came back many times manager even remembered me  He called Sloppy Joe Girl because night ordered he happy came back more food  He even kept going back kitchen check take order wouldn't waiting long  crappy cashier  He did however apologize said he just having bad day but still don't take your customers  very unprofessional  night ordered sloppy joe other night ordered chicken cream pasta sun dried tomatoes take out  sloppy joe nice tangy sprinkle chopped onions good! meat loaded flavor probably salty alone but when paired long sandwich buns perfect balance  also came side sauce some orange tangy nature which didn't care much for  chicken pasta good but probably favorite dish far  didn't much cream sauce compared Cabonara liked grilled chicken dry  little hard eat  huge portion though fed three girls! Till next time Grand Lux back you! <EOR> Had pepperoni sausage mushroom pizza lunch  pizza crust nice crispy    just way it  mid section tad bit soggy side side salad small   Service great  would return     <EOR> So far favorite place eaten Vegas  Cozy casual clean environment eclectic menu  Grand Luxe offers menu fresh affordable even satisfy wide range tastes  service always fast efficient when dined am looking forward eating later week  <EOR> This sister restaurant Cheesecake Factory expect huge portions!

Well question does anyone works restaurant industry know cook proper omelette? if anyone gave food 4 AM when starving wouldn't tough decision eat right?   My omelette served half cold  egg rubbery dry  menu made sound savory yet taste barely anything  couldn't even finish    I really regret coming last  <EOR> I realize chain located casino floor BUT love grand lux cafe primarily because every food item tasty  overpriced menu extensive portions large most importantly everything delicious rarity days  fine dining experience but many items completely crave able ie  Asian Nachos twice three days wtf those things   I want more write   place must doing ok given two within 100 yards each other    Definitely worth stop if need fancy meal and or less experimental eaters or clearly addicted Asian Nachos   <EOR> A group friends mood pass time talk looking place grab coffee desserts  in between lunch dinner thought Grand Lux would suitable this  met needs perfectly  waiter cool plans made sure recommend some great desserts sweet teeth    I molten lava cake which chocoholics dream  vanilla ice cream necessary cut through richness chocolate  apple pie friend more apple tart which she ended liking better if traditional pie form  Since group New Orleans kick seeing beignets menu course order some  half thought beignets pretty decent but compared New Orleans beignet which doughy never served sauces  being said version still pretty good aren't knocking them  coffee also good strong which perfect pick all needed    Our server cool probably more friendly servers Vegas  <EOR>
