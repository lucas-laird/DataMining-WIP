We tried Bellagio Buffet Wynn Buffet nothing worth those around $50 per person  But McDonald's always McDonald's cheap fast fair price  <EOR> The only two reasons would review fast food restaurant good bad service experiences  great experience here  ordered two Spicy McChickens wish CA 10 McNuggets fries  Since wait long time order however received bunch freebies didn't even ask for large soft drink 10 more McNuggets another Spicy McChicken  Hehe love victories  <EOR> 'only vegas said stacy's mom car next when she asked 'bout 50pc mcnuggets happy meal lookalike box   they're 24 7  definitely beats those hours steak eggs  maybe?  and only vegas where manager treats nuggets gold  he yelled cashier when she didnt answer repeated question theirs? hey really theirs? yes did remind him <EOR> 50 piece nuggets $9 99 $0 50 cones?!  Only Vegas! perfect greasy food your hangover cure! <EOR> I definitely needed snack because drunk would no time dinner  Since already spending all money drinking gambling decided cheap meal dollar menu is  McDonalds strip Big Golden Arches can't miss it  order two seconds later Hot Spicy McChicken ready  hot right off grill  customer service fast friendly  We decided walk around instead sitting dining area but looked if plenty space sit down  <EOR> After good night club friends wanted grab some grub before knocked next day  club Pure night did see across street? huge ass M which meant food there    So guess 24 hour McDonalds would honestly hate work because guaranteed drunk people every night  employee's job sure no brought alcoholic drinks inside restaurant which say sucks    It around 2 30am lines pretty long  guess everyone same idea did  took kind long since some drunk people front could hardly function but understandable  Annoying but understandable  finally ordered food wait while because busy    Since staying Treasure Island figured could just walk down way cross there  Apparently drunk realize totally forgot only cross Harrahs all way down Encore  headed toward Encore back track couple blocks  could just gone back Harrahs crossed save 10 15 mins  but whatevs      Anyways clean legit take escalator restaurant  fun when drunk! <EOR> This place sucked because called ask if dorder pizza he hung called back he threatend call cops but also Loud <EOR> Worst experience ever !!! took over 20 ns food drive thru !!! Never coming again !! <EOR> Cheers staff knew maintain control customers seemed disorganized really standing organized line  did job orders good fashion  can't expect them exited dealing drunk partiers gamblers but really did good job    As food      McDonald's!!! serves purpose  <EOR> This place such big shock because 50 Chicken McNugget $9 99 deal which sad now because deal now ALL Mickey D's    its special anymore    Anyways came back clubbing Tao 100 nuggets between 4 us  loved seeing kinds people time    saw workers just off shifts professionals college kids clubbing clothes grandparents    we're all different but two things common   love McDonald's we're VEGAS!  Oh yeah   food should already know Mickey D's food like   One star off having shady parking lot! <EOR> This best McDonalds to  remodeled past few years looks nice kept clean well  great place sister sit cool off ice cream while adults playing game downstairs  think more McDonald's area I think    but well worth it I saw paying couple extra cents sit air conditioned place hot summer day  <EOR> Yes stopped grab late night burger   group didn't feel shelling tons dough proper restaurant meal when just wanted snack   just wasn't cleanest most pleasant places sit eat   forewarned all sorts odd looking customers run McDonald's  <EOR> I used despise McDonald's  service slow employees rude worst all food greasy incredibly unhealthy  Over time McDonald's built image introduced some healthy menu items slowly regained interest   Walking down strip craving some affordable food  Whoever said Vegas cheap food must lost mind  arch bursting forth onto sidewalk only grabbed interest but made incredibly excited salad   When walked place lot smaller would expected but only person front figured wouldn't matter since wasn't crowd    I placed order stood off side  salads usually made beginning day takes less minute grab salad dressing plastic ware  However took over 20 minutes damn thing  only but tried giving wrong salad several times then told dressing requested then blamed someone back kitchen    Really though I'd rather overpay nicer casinos  Skip place  <EOR> It okay customer service way can t believe here    Mc Donald's always somewhere where expect usual prices but crowd uncomforting around    felt mix social security office poverty back when family struggling between advertising dealing streets flyers  but maybe I m just being unkind which guess am  least drinks okay     The thing hated most cheese! heck kind cheese man? Government artificial cheese? Highly dissatisfied made whole burger unexceptional sad McDonald's management Vegas part  <EOR> Best McDonald's ever!  Walked over leaving gambling binge   cashiers friendly!  Ps take chips payment! Cash credit only!!!!' <EOR> Service really good here  Especially black guy always smiles customers when taking orders  ordered only cheeseburger asked if should pay drinking water refills drink station all thanks NYNY even having simple water dispenser he said Nah don't pay  Just gave free cup  $1 40 paid burger level service amazing  guy should promoted cos he customers feel welcomed  <EOR> So few cocktails may inspired some it's midnight and I NEEEEEED some McD's munchies     However McD's right next door hotel really hit spot   easy stumble to    I mean find     hot fresh   What did appreciate fact when checked bag am glad always check bag here's why missing medium fries big mac   cool   Then when brought attention no apology no eye contact actually no words whatsoever   just put missing items bag walked away   Umm   Thanks? <EOR> Very good location   prime place college students trying eat small bet big  impressed seating area outside inside upstairs  favorite part coming around 11 still serving breakfast! Other then just your average McDonald's  <EOR> I've number Spicy Chicken sandwiches before but must admit McDonalds sandwiches spicy!!   Fresh french fries? here    cold cold be  Very disappointing   Overall decent place grab cheap ice cream cone sandwich try spoil being hungry dinner time Benihana! <EOR> Minus all weird drunks great 24 7 location if munchies    <EOR> Went morning right before going sky diving  good experience  all McDonalds service good food good  Nice spacious seating area  <EOR> A typical Las Vegas Strip dive  Full drunks looking greasy food night  Filthy dirty inside  Soda machines all carbonation  wife wipe seats table herself before sat  She even put down layer napkins before sitting  top all off something dripping ceiling  gave two stars because exactly imagined outside view cheap   Plus grease great remedy twisted tummy long hard night drinking  <EOR> I'm fan McDonald's    particular however much   waited long line around 9pm just deal not so friendly service   honey chicken nuggets according staff don't it   also sold milkshakes   ever heard McD's selling milkshakes?  Think not   soda condiment area dirty much almost skipped ketchup   sat outside patio even though bit chilly avoid odd stench inside   worst McD's ever in    big feat  <EOR> All Barney stalkers know don't generally review chains unless sticks out   friends those exceptions   After very 'successful' read long night stumbled way mid strip Mandalay crawl into air conditioned room around 7am   passed McDonalds adjoining Fatburger noticed glee 'open 24 hours' sign   didn't partake but noted location future evening   2 nights later shake craving hits mosey cards time more respectable 10pm   Open door  Walk in  And notice lack momentary bright splash light any whooshing noise even change air pressure     All things Hollywood would believe happens when instantly transported other worldly place   Because say but place Earth   Odd beings wandering randomly seemingly without purpose busy entire space establishment   only thing mssing HellBoy recreation burger joint someone breathing through gills but truth told spent all 5 minutes place might just missed Fish Dude   The shake same taste which typically found third planet sun likely contained exact same unidentifiable unpronounceable ingredients any McD's back home   But dare come demand some frequent flier miles trip  <EOR> This McDonalds any other McDonalds     however gets 4 stars because NEVADA McDonalds    which means SPICY McCHICKEN!
