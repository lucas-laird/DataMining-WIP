She knew name before even said    So she didn't give 1 free cupcake    she gave 5! each non gluten free selection   She said just finished two hours ago red velvet chocolate vanilla carrot cake coconut  filling cupcake container she then want cookies to? She gave chocolate chip cookie walnut fudge brownie  Then she even going give refund still  told no need she gave much already   So headed home hoard baked goods   Now waiting hour still pretty cold refrigeration bit dense but necessarily dry giving initial taste test wrapped container plastic bag let them sit over night   proved help greatly waiting least until reached fully room temp melted coconut topping bit but helped texture great all cakes    except vanilla still very dry   did appreciate no raisens carrot cake though ! Also texture coconut great filled coconut pieces  favorite   Now icing everything bit sweeter prefer still especially vanilla   However texture nice creamy   hope open longer more creative fillings flavor profiles maybe add some fresher components refreshing fruit compote curd center add acid counteract sweetness    and just lessen sugar except chocolate seemed good sweetness level   know seems cupcake week which coconut time around   While favorite everything could use extra punch set them apart really flavors sing     Now brownie hands down awesome! No need alter anything truly fudgy peice happiness   cookie decent almost brownie well could taste use coconut oil    sure if intent flavor but over all liked it   Neither tasted overly sweet either   So basically customer service 5 cake base 4 5 icing 4 originality 2 5 baked goods 4  <EOR> You guys truffles! wanted try something different coffee shop am glad did  soy Vanilla Latte delightful! definitely back purchasing some sweets next social gathering! <EOR> Super cool staff  food even better  goto place vegan baked goods  <EOR> Excellent place!
