<EOR> My wife buffet right when its open line pretty short  workers night friendly    The food section alright  Asian food Mexican food Italian food even American food  even variety delicious dessert choose from   Wine beer even included buffet  <EOR> I'm big fan buffets but breakfast  okay big selection  omelette station favorite  wasn't best buffet but left satisfied  bottomless cocktail menu which made breakfast more enjoyable paid additional 15 bucks     I would recommend people staying hotel looking something quick close  <EOR> Great buffet good variety selections  Prices good but Vegas  food fresh tasty  <EOR> It's buffet  Big money big food big people   Showed 7 00 Friday night summer  five minute wait  bad    Eh  <EOR> It's hard give bad review something free   But goes   The food just good   all siting vat oil weird mix knows what   Almost every single vegetable coated cheese  mean  cheese probably even more average person but certainly better ways prepare vegetables   Even breads good stale couldn't even find butter   There any 'make your own' type stations pasta omlette carver duck ham prime rib?    The only upside soft serve ice cream machine never wrong soft serve hot fudge sprinkles  <EOR> Super long wait busy!!!! Overall great selection food  Everything good compared other buffets visited  <EOR> We stayed Vegas thru 10 13 08 10 19 08 ate MGM Grand Buffet twice   first trip started off rough   we line which 15 people deep when host ushered into next line speed process   next thing knew    this host spotted people she knew coming abandoned she could bring friends family seat them   we watched she stood table chatting   Meanwhile back line   we stood everyone else line before she summoned switch   got seated served  even people came behind before did   finally made buffet nothing really grand it   food fine  standard buffet selection   One thing did notice crab legs being guarded asian lady acted she paid them own pocket   can't serve yourself crab legs  you ask them   and she would only give 2 small crab legs time even friendly    place clean its bad buffett     if your looking something better  go Bellagio   for ten bucks more much better quality food  <EOR> Not fan but ok if your pressed time need return business seminar  cost ya $19 without alcohol lunch  gelato desserts awesome  colleagues enjoyed carving station  Everything else meh!

I say give em try see your thoughts are  taste buds might ready buffet lunch  <EOR> We thought buffet crab legs prime rib dinner great   No disappointments   would recommend buffet   Food fresh taste great service perfect  <EOR> Very average can't imagine anyone staying hotel eating here   But knows always exceptions any rule     Damn come think may exception rule back day      never stayed but sure hell did eat but once just once      <EOR> Came part promotion seen huge cock roach run across floor attempted attain crab legs  Could eat am highly disappointed brand more importantly overall experience! return! <EOR> Since place popular line buffet long but guess there's nothing done that   The servers attentive removed plates  minor nitpick even though glad leave utensils behind tend place utensils table which personally avoid since usually put them napkins  would nice if offered replacement utensils other just ones table although guess maybe much water isn't wasted   There large variety food dishes choose from  price $40 person good deal offering lot expensive dishes  crab legs lobster ravioli prime rib creme brulee  also offered complimentary drinks raspberry iced tea sodas  <EOR> Expensive but most restaurants Las Vegas are  Nothing special buffet aside all drink special 15 99 purchase adult dinner buffet  <EOR> We came spite 2 5 star overall review glad took chance   Don't wrong caliber buffet Bellagio but good is   would put scale Monte Carlo Planet Hollywood buffets but better both those   lucky arrived 7pm Friday night no line     I liked food   good variety meats veggies seafood ethnic foods   hubby crab legs called them above average though just barely    liked Mexican section  desserts also cut above average buffet   I told hubby next time town more high end buffets   However remember good experience we'll back sure! <EOR> For buffet very good!

Very busy always full house but plenty room maneuver  Everyone complaining price but COME ON! Its Vegas its MGM! charge whatever please best well known casinos strip! actually thought quite decently priced $24 bucks person  All eat    $24 bucks ain't bad! <EOR> One worst buffets Vegas  Would eaten if hotel hadn't comped us  yourself favor Wicked Spoon  Cosmo Studio B M instead  <EOR> Monday night $56 2 just because Crab night? Neither nor dinner date into seafood rest selections terrible  Mediocre best  Never again  <EOR> I thought dinner buffet really good tons offer everything seemed really fresh delicious considering 9 30 night  awesome!  Definitely recommended would back again! <EOR> It's ok  no choice eat since running late show Ka only place could eat right away  forget much dinner but somewhere around $25 range  buy bottle merlot $15 outside well a pretty good deal    tons food but then again buffet food  wish more soups choose from  felt soup leftovers some creamy sauce   The part did mini bites desserts  smart them bite sized don't waste it  carrot cake key lime pie good  <EOR> This place great!  husband breakfast while trip while service great food not   food quality fresh everything mean everything! tasted frozen old   okay if you're pinch but wouldn't point going purpose <EOR> Ate last night friend attending concert Arena restaurants seemed pricey wanted some options   hoofed all way opposite end shocked $39 99 per person   point kind stuck paid it   But food very good lots choices   carving station 3 different types beef which unusual along turkey kielbasa   carver didn't seem understand English well those getting meat point wanted   self serve beverage stations each end room along small bar   glass wine which okay only cost $6 00   Overall decent buffet just overpriced but then many them now   Strip general hikes prices tourists forgetting many locals would more if reasonable  <EOR> Not best     Large variety but time seat every single item cold!!!

In general would say food edible if choose carefully but nothing perhaps exception dessert which truly good  all bland doing all day buffet feel bit queasy end day    The best bits fresh melon mini desserts dinner buffet which tasty even artistic white chocolate shavings other details  stingy crab shrimp which annoying  ask given reluctantly    All all only if saves money happen staying here  tried spend $80 day food buffet enabled stick least = <EOR> We met family town eat since  where wanted go   better wasn't awful    but inclined back   Best things had 1 mini carrot cake complete cream cheese frosting nicely spice carrot cake supposed be   2 peel eat cold shrimp snow crab legs  crab sweet shrimp nicely flavored  both tasted fresh fishy   3 fresh fruit melon strawberries pineapple all juicy flavorful   Mediocre things 1 steamed veggies    they little soggy side   2 tiramisu cup hardly any lady finger best part!  3 cappuccino mouse very rich    but lot clear brownish fluid pocket it    not sure if just wasn't mixed good what?  4 black beans they're kind hard screw Could okay but       1 Chili Relleno  cheese filling good but wayyyyy much breading which did nothing but retain much grease    if would less breading greasy would fallen category above   2 peanut butter cream puff  Dry kind defeats cream puff   Yuck 1 crab salad    I don't know if imitation crab meat old crab    but fish gross   the crab also rubbery   2 California roll ewww gross  actually spit into napkin  fishy made gag little before spit out!  3 mac n cheese pretty bland gooey    I think maybe made generic velveta?

Soft drink station pretty good selection! But let's fill liquid!   I didn't even see salad bar cuz just having everything else couldn't way lol   I highly recommend MGM's buffet! <EOR> Long wait  Over priced quality   Only think good Saturday brunch guacamole sour cream omelet  actually good  But worth 27 bucks     haven't brunch buffet awhile now know why     lmao won't coming back    <EOR> I haven't ages say 7 years but heard improved light all competition  Sad say just decor  weekend brunch included free beer wine  beer? Bud Light Coors Light  Pass  wine equally non impressive  All other beverages self service tea coffee those now commonplace Coca cola Freestyle machines  meat section person working both sides carving station grill station  seafood section attempts fancier but dropped snow crab legs favor dungess stone crab  grill cook somethings order crawfish but if tuna middle tends still cold frozen  sushi made right kind rice  There's way much filler food fried chicken pizza if please food court instead! wouldn't bad if price wasn't high $43   points we're steaming mad  service friendly though  guy meat station tried best  <EOR> Ate because free buffet room stay which only good lunch breakfast  Food ok sushi edible  Deserts disappointing  <EOR> I'm surprised low rating MGM Grand Buffet  Sure insanely overpriced every other place Vegas but food good large selection items    In particular impressed assortment meats  carving table could chose turkey breast moist delicious! prime rib amazing! tri tip decent but favorite   also made order steaks crab legs seafood lovers    In middle sections variety side dishes  personal favorites mac cheese very cheesy much better any other buffet mac cheese ever tasted roasted potatoes    The salad bar small buffet but guess paying higher prices you'd want fill other things anyway    My friends all gushed dessert bar but seeing sweet tooth barely existent didn't entice me  quite few choices those desserts though   Thankfully friend received $75 food credit staying MGM pretty much covered Friday dinner buffet  If come back own dime would definitely try lunch buffet which almost half price  <EOR> We last three years convention   $36 dinner buffet high end price but food great  you find better buffet price  <EOR> Cada vez hay menos variedad y el precio sigue igual el servicio y la atención son muy buenas pero la comida es muy poco variada por el precio que pagas en comparación con otros restaurantes de por aquí es muy caro no vale la pena lo que pagas por lo que te ofrecen <EOR> The reason came because two free dinners  before    about year ago literally same exact menu     Can't change little? Food meh    The sushi wasn't terrible being commercially made  <EOR> There no line 6 pm  good sign  starving didn't want wait anywhere decided still check out  All all? bad but no need return    They prime rib New York steak lamb sausages pork chops tilapia pizza chips nacho pork carnitas fried chicken fried fish clams mussels veggies salads crab hot cold shrimp dessert bar  worth money?

The two half stars no joke  <EOR> My husband Vegas friend's wedding MGM Grand two buffets breakfast lunch dinner free room! thought pretty sweet since $71 without tip eat buffet  seated started two mimosas bottomless heck yes! coffee  Then hit buffet  many choices! Even though during breakfast still variety foods including meatloaf salad bar carving station desserts fruit yogurt DIY omelette bar among other things  impressed variety but food unfortunately  lot under warming lights long weren't many healthy choices available  Tip if you'd eat healthier grab some fruit hit omelette station    food  ran into real trouble though when husband back more mimosas  He first sent back table because can't bring mimosa glasses back bar refills leave them your table new ones each time  Then he couldn't two time because drink per person policy  understandable asked another mimosa guys carded me! hadn't carded first time husband didn't carded and neither did anyone else saw little annoying   didn't ID husband fourth time mimosa! little ridiculous since already served one  grand scheme things wasn't huge deal but enough annoyance top great food give pretty negative impression restaurant  won't going back price! <EOR> It huge amounts food which fun  However quality hotel food   included vacation package but if paid $54 Sunday brunch buffet would gave disappointed  <EOR> This worst buffets Las Vegas  dinner few weeks ago paid $40 quality variety food comparable Circus Circus $12 buffet  Don't come unless drop price add better quality food  <EOR> Not bad   acceptable selection few decent tasting entrees   actually finished plate rather sampling leaving everything waste   This place soft spot heart because first Vegas buffet ever over 3 years ago   doesn't really live its memory but best buffet tried far Strip out Mandalay Bay Luxor Excalibur   <EOR> Bland food exorbitant prices   I'm used high prices I live San Francisco but terrible quality preparation food made they're charging just criminal  could coffee shop better meal fraction price   The soup flavorless pasta cooked mush  salad limp  roast beef cold greasy shrimp felt slimy smelled FUNKY   We ate Saturday night but some reason several food stations closed running short staffed  took forever soda which wasn't included price  salad station only plates available steaming hot dishwasher  felt no management cared guest's experience  Seriously better this  <EOR> Ehh   this buffet just buffet  No shocker here  star food giving place extra star because waitress pretty nice attentive  bf woke just time run downstairs breakfast cut off  breakfast food okay better  quite dissapointed weren't any pancakes  Oh serious switchover breakfast lunch if executing battle plan!! bf back lunch items   yeah good  bf tried sushi he put typical buffet sushi ehh   some manicotti kinda gross little bit baked pasta alright  very disappointed salad bar only iceberg lettuce come can't girl some mixed greens?!?!  Overall just think could walk couple blocks eat better buffet  <EOR> I'm huge fan buffets maybe review trust  But overall typical American buffet salty sugary no special flavours speak leave nothing but regret lighter wallet  some decent chicken potstickers chow mein noodles but it  <EOR> I recently married as few days ago reception here  staff helped over phone reservations very helpful answered emails quickly  But still worried wouldnt able decorate tables planned   Day wedding Maid Honor Best Lady didnt any problems getting decorate tables  reception WONDERFUL  staff kind helpful server very thoughtful brought some snowflake napkins match theme  manager shift leader I'm sorry dont remember he was really really sweet checked every often  Everything smooth perfect  mention cake DELICIOUS!!!! also didnt realize until Best Lady said something dinner but reserved area literally closed whole area off really nice them!  The food itself wasnt remembered  only served chilled crab legs last time Easter few years back maybe  why more day which good but wanted warm crab legs too! Chicken Parm DELICIOUS  also heard tacos delicious  didnt chance try much food but things did really really good  desserts werent many remembered  But glad few sugar free options guests couldnt eat sugar   Overall would definitely recommend place  <EOR> I'm only writing review because casino reported tweets  buffet horrible  Food hot nothing if fresh   Couldn't even eat Bacon which taste sawdust   gravy looked old solid material floating top  literally could find something eat however manager friendly gave refund soon said something   tells he know food very subpar   disappointed because MGM buffet Detroit really expectations place   Maybe MGM doesn't care older properties? advice seek another place because money better  <EOR> Feel place over priced serving  Food wasn't bad  But worth price tag  cheaper buffets better food  Dessert bust  Ice cream Hawaiian ice machine working  Would recommend  <EOR> I usually hate buffets place just confirms every reason why  But since free buffet came stay MGM felt obligated go   no variety food just completely lacked any kind flavor finesse   meat carving station which prime rib I didn't any but least there! sausage which decent then there's everything else expected  a small salad bar some Italian food like dried lasagne pizza some Chinese food if call beef broccoli Chinese some fried rice dried noodles some other very memorable dishes  even bit scared eat snow crabs shrimp cocktail because thought might freshest  desserts very subpar too   But good news didn't sick made through crappiest saddest buffet  Everything guess!!!! free! Actually wouldn't even come back again even if free  bad  You're basically just filling your tummy things  Tasteless useless things  Ick  <EOR> 1980's decor meets Hometown Buffet  If doing obligatory Buffet choose another  crab legs okay nothing special  rest food also okay too  $51 25 two people no comps  Cocktails expensive!!! <EOR> I've buffet probably 50 times over past 10 years honestly say steadily declined over time    The buffet price among higher priced buffets Vegas but food simply average nothing more nothing less   variety lacking some food just isn't good     The servers good keep your glasses filled quick remove your plates  also say love coffee MGM sure brand but always super smooth    If staying MGM want buffet easiest thing you  If want buffet many Las Vegas recommend skipping trying many others there  <EOR> I tried MGM Grand Buffet first time past week dinner before seeing Cirque du Soleil Ka show parents  arrived around 6pm didn't wait all pay seated  opinion buffet wide variety dishes haven't seen other buffets  think price good value however wouldn't say best buffets Vegas  If want Vegas buffet experience but looking something more affordable think worth try  Drinks self serve beer wine also included price pay  carving station prime rib other meats well hot crab legs  also salad bar fresh fruits shrimp cocktail pizza pastas variety Mexican Asian foods lots vegetable sides some best garlic bread tasted buffet  desserts just okay  best tried soft serve ice cream machine  all food items clearly labeled items nuts written twice people may allergies  other M Life properties buffet also honors military discounts! If military sure join M Life program discounts automatic upgrade Pearl status  <EOR> I breakfast two days row!  There lot options all yummy  loved corned beef hash pastry popovers  Juan omelette station egg station such treat hard working omelettes wonderful  All FOH staff very friendly kind bussers always making sure no empty plates lingered    As mentioned above two days row all options exactly same  felt little repetitive might nice if more different variety next day  Nonetheless food very yummy! <EOR> Holy crap much?! Sure liked food but future think save money grab cheaper slice pizza fast food joints  should known wasn't going cheap its Vegas  just can't see spending much casino food more to  still yet find restaurant blows away city  probably best food you'll area but wish line one platers ones stuff themselves money's worth    <EOR> Booked hotel room through Orbitz received Complimentary Breakfast Brunch     Noticed low star ratings but since Free Breakfast Brunch Sure why not!  The food Bleh       Prices breakfast brunch ranges $17 25 $25 99   NOT WORTH IT!  Trust elsewhere!    Most items cold hard dry   Yuck!  worst eggs benedict OMG Disgusting!

Compared other Vegas strip hotel buffets MGM cheaper side  example they're asking $36 dinner while Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan charges $50 Bacchanal Caesar's charges $60 dinner   huge difference when you're party 4 more   The great thing MGM there's no long wait  example Bacchanal 5 hour waiting list 24th shortest line week saw 1 5 hours  really prepared wait long line eat no matter good food is  same long line story most buffets strip  MGM longest waited 15 minutes  great perk when you're hungry!  The service really uneven  first time great waiter kept bringing champagne until quite tipsy before 12 pm  But usually staff much run around really didn't good service  seems they're understaffed   All all if you're hungry Strip don't want wait long time don't want pay much you're far away then place satisfies your needs  <EOR> Best thing ever your life  Only thing look forward when come vegas   military discount  Unlimited Mimosas too  buffet all EVERYTHING GOOD!!!

Trust me! <EOR> Really MGM? all Mayweather Paquiao money Calvin Harris Tiesto money iHeart music festival money should best buffet Vegas    As much love staying MGM need upgrade buffet ASAP  all honesty probably worst buffet ever to  food worse dog's food! Yes tried dog food    If staying MGM don't eat buffet even if 100 resort credit two free buffets per stay  You're better off eating street food    There other restaurants MGM much better but also pricey  can't use your resort credit but paying something ridiculously expensive still better eating MGM buffet  <EOR> This buffet really really good pumpkin chocolate gelato tastes all awesomeness fall season ice cream flavor  <EOR> $29 bucks food could $7 99 chuck wagon buffet  Don't waste your time one   The service good but food just sub par  Lots potatoes pasta bread  Everything tastes microwaved plastic bag  crab pre cut which very hard eat dried out   only saving grace meal put company card  <EOR> I buffet twice during stay MGM once brunch dinner  around $30 per meal depending day specific meal  thought $30 fair variety food overall quality  line pretty long around brunch time  tried going around 9am brunch line pay seated way long  If odd hour say 7am brunch you'll probably quick    Service nice  good job picking your plates when leave table  always seems problem buffets but here    On food! brunch food pretty disappointing comparison dinner  bacon soggy powdery scrambled eggs just    eggs  noticed omelette station but biggest fan omelettes  probably should just gotten made order eggs which suggest if want real eggs  didn't really try any lunch items but decent assortment salads pastas potatoes meats  brunch experience pretty meh would highly recommend just coming dinner   Dinner great! might because first night Vegas excitement just oozing but dinner awesome  such huge selection during dinner time sushi grilled fish SEAFOOD!!! prime rib pastas roasted potatoes veggies list on  seafood probably favorite part  fresh shrimp mussels actually good! definitely judge buffet place seafood MGM's seafood good  area where your seafood cooked  some steamed crab legs delicious  even add garlic butter sauce your cooked seafood  highlight meal made all worth it    MGM offers decent buffet bit more affordable others food whole solid! <EOR> Gross  pretty much sums up  once 4 years ago lunch way pretty good  disappointed when last week dinner before concert  food bland unsanitary feel whole experience  felt would done way better regular restaurant money  <EOR> For $60 can't wrong  know find something yourself even if your picky  Plus free alcohol great  sure think 7 am Jell O shots    <EOR> Why oh why didn't listen fellow yelpers?! Because landed Vegas early morning made mistake asking concierge places where could breakfast  The Grand Buffet! nice lady desk said   Early morning   really chipper   and those rosy cheeks   how could she wrong?  Oh she could very wrong   scrambled eggs looked grated chick peas ac pumping food your plate cold bite # 3 overall just worth $30 per person    I say service excellent   server took drink order brought drinks right away  he passed table check w us very frequently     Other good service just wasn't worth price   Just bellagio's buffet instead  <EOR> Honestly first hesitant coming but decided give try since staying MGM hotel anyway  am HAPPY decision! Best buffet tried Vegas hands down  Rio yesterday because everyone raving great all  tops all! only food great service amazing well! Super kid friendly! Big restaurant super clean food actually looked fresh  Really great buffet was  Recommending everyone!! <EOR> The food decent  $17 per person brunch  filling  Can't compare them Wicked Spoon since selection night day  But if just want regular breakfast brunch cheaper buffet  <EOR> I could see why many bad reviews Grand Buffett  quite frank think wasn't bad  Granted 3 free meals day Buffett part stay package think food pretty good  However paled comparison Wynn Buffett    I think same stuff two days row which made little annoyed  hoping they'd least rotate dishes throughout week something      I noticed prices werent high Wynn but seemed overpriced actually was  enjoyed food however cannot see myself giving more 3 stars  <EOR> Nothing really bad good state MGM's  stay West Wing loungey whatever called last year 2 buffets included  came during late breakfast hour such still eating when started dish lunch items    Satisfying just wants full  But ain't no Wicked Spoon Aria Buffet    let's straight! <EOR> I came around 2 40 Sunday no line able enjoy brunch dinner menu  Food average nothing bad but nothing wow  Crab legs good but opened need ask them station  Deserts great  come back <EOR> It's solid 2    There plethora PLETHORA array items  Almost much because no specific genre everything looks tad off mark    From salad carving station sushi Mexican food    just all over place   The free mimosas kind suck  actual drink drink awesome all time  Mimosas never disappoint  line though sucks only time      If coupon its free then eh  Sure it  But if you're paying full price there's better your money  <EOR> Yum! Came lunch day during MGM stay enjoyed was  Loaded things really enjoyed ravioli salad etc  Some stuff obviously long but knew par course  Dessert fruit really well done very fresh great assortment  Worth money? Barely but pretty delicious  Your $20 might toward something nicer Wolfgang Puck other side building but won't nearly much loaded your plate  <EOR> It $28 per person but only included buffet non alcoholic drinks  buffet mediocre  Nothing outstanding nothing horrible  just mehhhh <EOR> Spend little more money somewhere else  Came dinner much worth eating other prime rib  Everything dry tastless even desserts  soft serve came put soup  3 boys between ages 12 18 said Old Country Buffet better buffet  think sums up  <EOR> $14 breakfast buffet   $18 lunch buffet    No soup selection  Mini Mexican burritos bar minimal selection Some side Chinese dishes  Some Oysters only  Dessert better variety   Italian tapas dishes mediocre   There waitress service but otherwise don't recommend coming buffet   Selection limited  <EOR> Typical Vegas buffet  $25 per person  Food good dessert awesome! <EOR> I've Vegas number times never done buffets before  time two  most excited MGM's buffet because I'd heard much fan crab legs  disappointed  crab legs smallest most malnourished little babies ever seen  flash cooked help meat pull away shells getting into them almost impossible  While large selection food impressed overall quality  wanted badly love buffet because wanted part Vegas excursion every year but just doesn't stack me  think overpriced $40 per person especially given buffets abundant supply Vegas  scratching MGM off list but glad tried it  <EOR> Not buffet I'd recommend Vegas!  The lay design poor  know doesn't seem important but is  When people going million different directions plates piled high small children darting all around very little space move disaster waiting happen! actual counter space pretty expansive but only use half cram all together  creates CLUSTER!   The offerings buffet fairly dull  lot flavor any dishes  only items worth checking shrimp crab legs  crab legs sliced right down middle which easy retrieval meat without little effort perfect! seafood only offered certain times day sure you've timed right before throwing down cash  <EOR> Food OK  April 8th 5 30pm dinner broiler broken  Service location really sucked  Servers only job clear plates couldn't done right  seek manager  speaking manager plates cleared  He manager never came back table apologize  Last time here  <EOR> Rather disappointing Thanksgiving buffet  No green bean casserole cranberry sauce among other holiday favorites  More people seemed interested miles crab legs kiosk turkey  <EOR> Had champagne bunch $20pp which bad value hotel brunch    Likely second favorite buffet past trip order being 1  Bellagio Brunch 2  MGM Champagne Brunch 3  Pampas Brazilian BBQ Miracle Mile 4  Monte Carlo Dinner  5  Quad's Brunch   Service crap   food alright vegetarian some novel options but wasn't really excited anything    sure champagne worth you'd think all drink but more all inattentive server decides bring  probably worth it    great server would awesome deal though    didn't even buzz light weight drinker    The highlight buffet gelato    guess  biggest complement because just served stuff but really enjoyed covered baby m ms  <EOR> I've bunch buffets strip decent  good selection food shrimp California rolls prime rib crab legs pizza soup fruit salad bunch other stuff  few reasons why only gave place 3 stars shell still shrimp crab legs small food quality just okay  interesting item curry empanada but just bunch outer shell tiny bit curry  If option I'd pick Wicked Spoon Bellagio Bacchanal buffet since some interesting selections food quality and price higher   Overall I'd recommend place if nearby lazy walk other buffets  isn't worse but isn't best either  least place people never really seen buffet Monte Carlo packed people unless big holiday   <EOR> Eh!

Brunch okay lots choices but once again don't expect great breakfast lunch then won't disappointed   Vegas isn't great value when comes food because new customers come every day don't likely return same restaurant there's no real real reason change things better   casinos outside Denver offer great buffets including endless prime rib crab legs $25   offer better fare less money?

cluttered too   stood line 30 minutes without even moving inch point  All waiting blah food  worth paid    free  <EOR> Not sure why buffet such terrible reviews but now write 4 3 stars  large

off food offer but wasn't line around 1 45 almost $60 both us   didn't even any shell fish price   hadn't MGM since kid wanted just see again try food which proved horrific   Going down aisles realized lot food really repetitive your fried southern comfort food your asian food including teriyaki fish noodles sushi etc   breakfast items salads veggies fruits desserts   pregnant which totally multiplies love food umpteenth times but before being pregnant could take down whole cow if gave few hours but place couldn't even pancakes appetizing enough   scalloped potatoes cheese sour cream believe potatoes weren't even fully cooked   Phil some fried chicken fish items which good   also teriyaki fish mentioned earlier minute put mouth overwhelming taste ginger   couscous salad which

desserts worst sweet tooth if anything sure desserts would've put better mood   end left unsatisfied trip Carl's Jr  probably would've done better job feeding husband  <EOR> We dined buffet 2010 most recently Thanksgiving Friday  Mrs  said 5 Star buffet   Buffet price $29 99 adult $14 99 kid  Total tax came $86 49 three us   This would first time Ian understood concept buffet Vegas  spent lot time

Guess feeling nicer today   Should known when saw reviews but pretty much free Signature cold rainy stuck indoors   Could even touch hot dishes   looked bad  Couldn't look dish  drab surroundings terrible   But spare negatives give positives if thrifty also lost all your money Vegas decide take hotel free or almost free buffet   The best totally edible items are hummus guys right  Some veggies salad bar decent healthy salad  I stuck rather trying only hot dish looked sorta good  overly creamy mac cheese   Eggplant squash dish melted cheese also okay   chicken stir fry peppers fajitas tacos okay   tortilla chips instead stale taco shells   Filled guacamole black beans very fresh tomato salsa actually very good   Yeah  it   Stay away scary looking sushi   Ice cream cone bad   Other desserts all pretty gross   Best thing entire buffet something would never guess normally  banana nut muffin! <EOR> Excellent service  waiters very attentive  Food great price! Lots options! <EOR> It terrible  brunch Sunday morning  90% food just lousy flat out  desserts decent but somewhat limited compared other buffets  selection overall good  Don't waste your time money  <EOR> Oh sweet glorious splendor MGM Grand buffet! Yes pricey  But rest Las Vegas general  Gone days cheap food free flowing booze but digress  price variety  quality food comfortable surroundings  desserts superb wide array beverage options  filling buffet head sports book which just off main entrance  good place relax bet ponies  say MGM grand whole fallen off over years  used place but now nickel dime pretty hard  $10 parking pretty outrageous especially spending well over $100 just buffet no validation offered checked   But review just buffet alone hence five stars  <EOR> The price pay well worth food eat  Good options but flavor average  king crab already cut open you! <EOR> Had  Christmas dinner MGM Buffet   Wanted Bellagio but wait more 2 hours  same Wicked Spoon   no wait MGM which should hint Yelp reviews read accurate   But  determined buffet please all various desires group run time find place did require long wait    Food would find cafeteria setting reminded eating hospital cafe   Certainly worth $40 per person      Asked wine list given little piece paper few wines listed but told prices correct  told prices  higher listed but wait person did know prices   Other knowing prices wine wait person very helpful     I should  paid attention Yelp reviews  I now on!! <EOR> This most horrible buffet ever had  definitely wouldn't if its included hotel reservation  even regret booking package because just wasted valuable dinner crappy meal  <EOR> Came boyfriend Thursday night  much wait seated select beers wines free night  Sweet!   Unfortunately am dairy intolerant LOT buffet dairy it  Even items could dairy free spaghetti rendered inedible because kitchen sprinkled cheese top    Also salad bar selection pretty small whole lot vegetables dressings choose from  REALLY missed balsamic vinaigrette    wasn't option    I still managed eat decent meal thank goodness Asian foods section boyfriend enjoyed buffet since he no dairy issues  probably wouldn't come back though  price just didn't feel whole lot value variety due dairy issues which why come buffet  <EOR> Disgusting   First off server horrible   She didn't listen several drink orders wrong   She also took 20 minutes before getting drinks refills   The food selection abysmal   taste worse   Things tasted stale set long old unseasoned   I would never return buffet recommend it  <EOR> Pricey worth it  I guess spoiled Wynn Buffet setup mess ask replenishments cuz croutons nacho cheese  this place cluttered buffet areas tight  staff hit miss  probably never return  only highlight buy free staying MGM  <EOR> Movie Vegas Vacation Scene Eddy buffet line   need say more? <EOR> Just ok lunch    For buffet stop stint Vegas thought couldn't wrong MGM  fair wasn't bad but definitely should checked Yelp first    I guess alright $23 tax  most part everything ate good but MGM really lacked 'je ne sais quois'  Actually scratch that  know lacked  totally void crab legs sushi creme brulee carving station other buffet elements would expect Vegas    I expected wowed but instead left way full temporarily satiated    A solid spot meal but no means outstanding Vegas buffet  <EOR> 4 stars service 3 food  We lucky ended great server   She brought whole carafes hot water coffee   addition she came back couple times check sure doing ok  <EOR> Wasn't bad but price 3 stars  26 bucks brunch  know cook bacon  price could two Gordon Ramseys burGRs <EOR> Being Portland cannot believe into buffet place  thing Portland does if buffets horrid little places   guess Las Vegas opposite because place some pretty decent food price fantastic location well   We only ate when bed two mornings only talk breakfast  However lunch well   Tons food all tasted fresh always full plenty hot enough   inlaws back day used them Portland buffet would nastiest food those big square containers boiled water underneath  food would crusty around sides overcooked pretty much canned  desserts would things puddings layer hardened pudding top would cool whip put over it  would fruit cocktail cherries top dried pizza   said Portland does buffets   I digress but making point sort contrast saw here  First none those square containers boiled water below cafeteria anywhere seen   Their presentation appetizing instead items things like smoked salmon smoked trout homemade crepes made spot any fruit wanted them root veggies apricot prune mango fruit salad all kinds olives lots egg choices even homemade grits    The servers friendly helpful well   The price breakfast all eat good deal especially since just did eat lunch meal anyway!  Las Vegas charges much meals!  I think Portland could learn thing two buffet here  There's niche market  waiting happen  mean kind brunch quite well  <EOR> My friends came since some food vouchers Grandview  If think anything notable eat enjoyed prime rib macaroni cheese crab legs creme brulee  Other food so so  seemed your average buffet but worth price at $27 99 Saturday night? Hmm     The only thing didn't dirty looks server gave us  Every time he came he kept looking weird  didn't anything blasphemous cause commotion anything  disheartening but enough stop enjoying food   At least creme brulee amazing  <EOR> Overall very pleased although only drank Mimosa's IDK else had      @ $26 lunch buffet place MGM would expect rate quality this  Food quality above average choices great!  Unlimited Mimosa's awesome server Hilarious!! Atmosphere pleasant IDk else say its above average Buffet quality food  Ony thing better would grill set grilled items over all I'd def  come back! <EOR> Well agree quite bit other responses definitely worth money   meal $29 99 plus tax seafood buffet   only reason even deserves star because crab legs tasty already cut half making easy eat   Other food very bland mussels very good shrimp ceviche sub par NY strip no flavor prime rib cooked medium well way done prime rib sushi rolls even worth eating even grilled vegetable tasted no salt pepper use   only other thing worth mentioning grilled sausage rather tasty   The service horrible   waited 15 minutes before people seating came over said see served drink yet  Then when emptied waitress walked table grabbed dirty dishes never returned fill drink   ate plate food just crab legs then back ask bus lady drink   Never again! <EOR> Buffet best way end night strip especially loosing money machines  offer bit everything think reasonable price too  enjoy buffet but no come hotel much because seems alway lost money MGM  <EOR> Went MGM buffet brunch  Thank god buffet vouchers since stayed hotel didn't spend own money  Las Vegas standard buffets more HomeTown buffet  Very mediocre food selection no presentation rice krispies dessert?!  Need say more? <EOR> i expected way better tasting food MGM  <EOR> At $35 99 person completely underwhelmed   decor looks old Country Buffet especially when compare rest flashy MGM    Based off yelp reviews low expectations anyway    But hoping best because staying MGM Signature Suites really wanted somewhere close way show @ NYNY    My favorite things prime rib grilled asparagus  Everything else pretty overcooked  why many hot plates desert bar where most items chilled?  Meh $$  <EOR> We took advantage $29 99 pp 3 meals deal mid week only $39 99 weekends    we also staying hotel $35 meal credit two ate entire day $25    Definitely bad deal all     buffet ok but really  nothing write home about      right breakfast ending won't blame them running several things     Breakfast selection looked pretty standard breakfast meats pastries omlet station etc     also few entrees some desserts but sure if those already being put lunch if them during breakfast well    blueberry pancake amazing not standard individual pancakes more bluberry pancake batter baked into dish scooped spoon      Lunch decent   there nothing particular stood although desserts pretty good loved chocolate tart      Similarly dinner reasonably good but nothing particularly amazing stood out   roast beef carving station probably favorite    Many same entrees desserts repated lunch dinner which probably expected but bit bummer since hoping little more variety  <EOR> My friends starving passing MGM walked inside  ran into Grand Buffet  first iffy but then OK  But first plate saw line new york steak great  Then few king crab legs dipped butter   The desserts weren't bad all  mini cheesecakes lime tart tiramisu all good   It great buffet definitely worth 30 bucks  <EOR> The Breakfast buffet descent   everything would expect need breakfast   did take advantage guy making omlettes but looked good  <EOR> Stayed MGM lots times but never ate buffet  time stayed NYNY decided come because gf saw crab legs dinner   Pretty nice size biggest but okay  hit crab legs first plate full cold crab legs which tasty  gf said oh other side corner might hot ones   second plate crabs hot  But bottom tray steamed long  lot dry tasteless  Yeah preferred cold legs   The prime rib blah seasoned enough  some kind braised beef dish sauce good but meat little dry    The best part buffet desserts! small counter area but everything looked good  First things saw cobbler bread pudding mmmm couple favorites  But ended getting neither!!  picked keylime pie blueberry parfait strawberry tiramisu fruit creme custard thingy  AWESOME DESSERTS!!!  The service also very good  waitress cleaning dirty plates spot refills!!  So if just stick crab legs desserts won't disappointed!! <EOR> I remember buffet 4 years ago when excellent   pinch took some friends MGM buffet WITHOUT CHECKING YELP FIRST  dumb dumb dumb dumb   I embarrassed found $27 person MGM Friday dinner buffet  sushi offer consisted old looking platter krab salad rolls platter old looking krab california rolls   use krab pollock product rolls puzzling because right next door huge tray cold crab legs  legs fine    One entire row of 4 consisted salad fruit yay healthy choices but all obtained grocery store clearly offered space filler      I walked HUNGRY but buffet visually unappealing only half filled plate disappointed find taste matched lackluster appearance each offering   sure fruit great but  more snack item me   After 3 unsuccessful sorties trying potato halves little pasta balls fish dish beef rib over salty gravy some rock hard rolls noodles none recommended resorted eating some old looking and old tasting potstickers some nasty orange glazed chicken   request server some chili sauce?  Denied only 4 sauces see your table  had catch bussing station bother request since she generally seen during visit Oh while we're service matched overall experience   Perhaps just bad attendant but really only job keep drinks full plates cleared   No Can Do No Can Do   My low opinion food verified buddy   Though he politely pretended food fine could see he finishing many items he chose plate   coming guy known eat PLAIN COLD PASTA lunch   man no taste buds he wouldn't even eat crap   Dessert good most selections unfinished table   COFFEE however deserves mention excellent   Last rant other people eating here?  Looks some free coupons given MGM would lower trash bill tossing all food into dumpster   Think trying to be classy www peopleofwalmart com meets strip buffet     Total unmitigated thumbs down   Good lesson always check yelp com first because all other reviews say basically same thing  <EOR> This place perfect breakfast while Vegas  exactly did   cost $38 total no alcohol but absolutely worth it   loved being able exactly wanted each day breakfast cost pretty par most food places Vegas   best buffet there? No but definitely hit spot full enough through till lunch without having any other food   Both enjoyed hot fresh coffee staff all super nice   sure busy really gets each day because around 7 30 8AM everyday never wait line   If you're staying MGM definitely grab breakfast here! <EOR> This absolute WORST buffet ever LIFE   Starting food all way down service  food AWFUL  cut crab legs half meat carving station salty   just every other item tried bland BAD taste    I wish would gotten waiter's name because service sucked  being seated he neglected table 15 minutes finally flagged someone down help then pointed guy neglecting table waiter  He came over table acted if he didn't want even want bothered us   seen other reviews ignored them because tend find good any situation but serious when say would absolutely never eat again  <EOR> This review breakfast buffet $17 99  first pro tip if you're claiming free buffet playing vegas game    don't wait till right before going breakfast buffet head Mlife desk   Odds line    earlier later don't miss your meal little time enjoy buffet    Now we're breakfast buffet if you're cuff between breakfast lunch time you're lucky some lunch items! selection decent your bacon eggs omelets sausages oh andddd plentiful desserts!

No STEAK Hand breaded shrimp decent but breading falling off very doughy   Vegas obviously trying cut costs hard boil Crab legs   Prime Rib terrible rubber SHOE best !  server gave piece blood all over should served first place Server cutting beef new she starring when walked down demise back 5 minutes later another piece hopes better cut freaking terrible looked rubber very dull no taste   group 7 all disappointed ALL !!  fruit selection nothing great salads average dessert ok if Lemon Cheesecake nothing scream about   wait staff though good getting plates drinks which why 2 stars   Lobster Ravioli processed phony looked good tasted blah 1 item liked really enjoyed  <EOR> If Hometown Buffet you'll enjoy they're par   disappointed chewy meat sad looking sushi rolls even sadder mushy fruit   Mac cheese blintzes lox good though   won't return  <EOR> Not bad value if weekday champagne brunch $24    All drink mimosas worth price   Food acceptable but nothing some more lavish buffets MGM's buffet more standard buffet fare lot breakfast options time day     Desserts nothing write home except delicious peanut butter gelato   if only thing dessert station that   big ice cream buffet but truly top notch   Decor generic drab definite room some updating but everything clean well organized   terrible but certainly fancy   just middle road   That said waitress Donna bubbly nice made whole experience really pleasurable   She genuinely warm lot waitresses could take some pointers her   Thanks Donna making average brunch unforgettable one! <EOR> Ok   so $31 99+ per person I'd much rather dine restaurant    but hubby likes eating all you can eat joint hence buffet  ate brunch everything sushi  to egg chorizo flautas which particularly liked deep fried twinkies   nice selection hand carved bone meats  Your $ includes regular variety sodas  teas coffee  plus All Drink Mimosa Bar  wait line minimal  wait Omelet counter   Overall decent buffet meal staff hurry rush off your table when your finished eating  other places take plates right under forked fisted hand  mid bite! Worth try if you've decent appetite  <EOR> Very good food   money's worth crab legs alone   perfectly cooked sweet tender give many want   guy even tried push extra leg when back seconds    The salad bar should more varieties lettuce veggies   no complaints anything else ate buffet except sushi which mushy didn't taste right   rice flavored all wrong consistency   need new recipe   The ravioli excellent   daughter loved tacos   liked fruit tart chocolate mousse desserts   But main thing amazing crab  <EOR> buffet quality food but such great variety stayed almost 5 hours kept eating good dessert sea food all sort stuff  totally worth money <EOR> 2 stars food  lunch  Very small selection sushi  liked curry fish blackened salmon    but nothing special really  Food ok but price pay  Lunch 22 99  worth it    The other star service  Lita server  She awesome  She made sure beverages always refilled  She checked 3 4 times 1 hour spent if everything ok if needed anything else  <EOR> Ehhh    all buffets ive vegas probably least favorite  food decent but actual space could use little refresher  Also think paid 30 bucks dinner wasnt nearly good Rio which only 23 bucks  Its ok though definitely trick  <EOR> OK buffet  little surprised low ratings yelp  also why when stayed MGM Grand did come here    This time food credits hotel promotions decided check place out  reading yelp reviews did hold high expectations    Did enjoy food? Sure  think worth $$ charges for? really    The selection good  Good variety  pretty happy meal enjoyed food drink  server actually much more attentive some other buffets blvd    So guess understand low ratings  don't necessarily recommend MGM buffet because lots other better options area  However if free food beverage credit then check out  <EOR> I wanted give more stars always theory if hate food buffet picked wrong things but unfortunately no longer true   I tried fried rice old Crusty tried shrimp dumplings immediately spit out saving grace visit employees saw happened quick recommend something else even apologized it    MGM mix keep fresh smaller sizes sure your food always great  Also give your staff raise great customer provided those worked lunch buffet Tuesday 2 28 17  least show them message  <EOR> I don't know   I really MGM Grand Buffet!!  I load prime rib crab legs tons melted butter!!  Oh yeahhhhhh   sooooooooo gooooooooood!  The first time ate 6 7 years ago   staying MGM week ate brunch late dinner   Filled plate deep fried chicken mash prime rib lasagna crab shrimp     you name ate it!!  I relatively shape checking into hotel   but HOLY COW !!!!  Upon returning home weighing myself   I put whopping 12 pounds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Un freakin believable!!!! <EOR> besides price buffet terrible  $27 think aycd $15 extra we sunday brunch before leaving town  don't bring crab till 3pm    EVERYTHING extremely salty overcooked undercooked nothing right   really disappointed    i would come back here    i group 8 no satisfied  <EOR> I breakfast buffet driving 8 hours Vegas  passed many other places stop MGM thinking place should some standards    The food nasty  only food liked crab salad even made sick first plate  most likely very fresh since am sensitive that   The sausage dry side roast really no flavor  fruits borderline being raw  eggs watery  <EOR> Well    put way spending $43 50 person didn't expect see lunch meat buffet line  Food downright terrible  Service wasn't good  Overall just bad experience very surprising considering MGM  <EOR> I wasn't love place but didn't hate it  above average Vegas buffet  I'd definitely back  <EOR> I generally don't making reviews soon going some place prefer stew around ask others party thought try well rounded review     know all pretentious it   But having dinner last night having extra hour while rest family off gamble vent disgust Grand Buffet MGM Grand   First off dinner weeknight costs upwards $39 99 person which buffet pricier ones strip   comparison Wynn Cosmopolitan charge buck less weeknights $38 99 Bellagio charges $36 99 just throw preferred Vegas buffets Rio scant $32 99 per adult   MGM charges more newer swankier places Vegas   extra cost?  The short answer nothing worth it   When come buffets don't expect anything more lot average fare   Typically hope find most things disgusting two items jump above line equal number dive well below it   everything feels dried much time under heat lamps meats under seasoned overcooked breads stale oddly chewy then couple high points   Starting carving station steaks flavorless no char grill no salty melt beef most everything filled gristle   ribs overcooked fatty trim burned dry coarseness akin bad chicharrones    Prime Rib overcooked no pink close over seasoned why couldn't sprinkle some everything else? sharing those ribbons gristle ruined steaks before them   finally those kielbasas     well just bad   The Mexican Latin station bad rendition Carnitas which overly laden unnecessary vegetables instead flavoring them just whatever acid broke down protein simmer cooking down its own salty fat   And pizza     toddler son normally loves such things wouldn't even touch it   On average end scale Brussel Sprouts alright bit tough didn't seem steamed soften before roasting but also coated strong acrid taste fennel     The sushi station point typical buffet though $40 plate one   Octopus Nigiri atypical selection good chew along fair flavor didn't overly fishy taste   Salmon rolls jalapeño slivers nice heat   But flip side no California Rolls any normal sushi fare would expect enjoy   Macaroni Cheese fair tasting fresher box good enough parents bite enjoy while kids feasted it   And over Asian station Egg Rolls average if common everyday   Pot stickers poorly made none them cooked down long enough skins become gummy firm should but still pretty good even if readily fell apart   Fried Rice almost always good   On high end Shrimp Diablo fantastic good cut shellfish perfectly cooked served wine sauce fair heat really outstanding   And Pear Gorgonzola Ravioli nice blend sweet salty well cooked sauced remember being butter cream made favorite dish night   Oh dessert pretty standard quite worth price tag but still good representation should see higher end Vegas buffet strip   Plus Ghirardelli sauces!  So end more disappointments readily edible food   Nothing horrendous but none truly stood amazement came anywhere near warranting $40 price tag   think greatest mark against place all poor Yelp reviews tagged MGM management thanks promise review     yet none slights seemed improved any way whatsoever!  Anyway if dropped cost down $25 weeknight might solid three stars   right now very weak two stars eyes  <EOR> I say   opinion buffet good choices tasty! Didn't find much flavorful all  did breakfast maybe dinner different but thought okay buffet  Especially pay only $18 person which bad! your own drinks which different but also liked because didn't feel tip excessively  Overall decent buffet again price  Wish would included least mimosa something but other don't complaint! <EOR> Decided dinner around 8 00  general rule try buffet hotels stay Vegas  line ridiculous  First wait forever pay line  Then  pay shuffled into another line actually into buffet  two lines groups 1 4 people other groups 5 more  does seem any real method deciding gets seated next  Once moved little line bit bit could see inside dining room pissed when saw ton empty tables some cleared off some yet stand line nobody being seated  length both lines needed clear off those dirty tables much quicker  far ones ready concerned don't know why people weren't being them faster  eaten share Vegas buffets never experienced such ridiculous system wait    I prayed food worth wait here  needed something justify unfortunately worth all  caramel cheesecake dessert only thing really worth it  Some other desserts good but best  basic buffet foods none great  bread hard pastas great  pizza salad looked unappetizing  meat carving station disappointing  crab legs gross  crab meat funny taste tough    Another thing annoyed don't your own drinks  server brings them  When finally seated wait patience starving  told someone named Miguel would serve drink then food sit wait  Nobody shows up  Then see he essentially ignoring me  Then another server came finally took drink order then she disappeared  No drink  waiting say screw first plate food  come back still no drink  Miguel finally shows takes drink order  gave order because assumed lady forgot me  When he finally he quick brought drink right away  When working second she finally brings drink nerve look stunned another drink?! She didn't really think would wait long drink did she? Honestly long line did patience wait forever damn drink  Other buffets gone don t self serve drinks take order right away bring right after  Personally though think since buffet serve yourself food should drinks well  plus cleared your finished plates quickly  No issues dirty plates piling table  guess just took while tables ready fact but during problem    So summation long line pay another long line poor selection poor food long wait drinks good desserts quick clean up  star desserts quick cleanup  bad outweighs good sure won't back  <EOR> The MGM buffet certainly grand   average best similar most other buffets strip  First off quite expensive  four cost $150 brunch  food average nothing tried blew away  also unhappy find now need your own drinks drink station  seems unfair wait staff  already difficulty getting tips buffet since your own food  cocktail drink station pay nine dollars wristband margaritas  only positive found dessert station  did find cakes very tasty professionally made  If you're going spend amount money eat worth trying mid priced range restaurant instead  <EOR> The only other buffet Vegas tried Wicked Spoon Cosmopolitan leaps bounds above MGM Grand Buffet  sure Cosmopolitan charges but considerably worth double price  MGM made think Sizzler remember restaurant  more quantity quality which opposite Wicked Spoon which more quality bites  If could eat horse MGM otherwise I'd look else where  <EOR> I expected more price paid   Yes buffet   But far expected   food selections average errr    actually little below standard me  taste just plain  crab legs dry moist all    It does meet name GRAND buffet grand all!! would come back sure  <EOR> That photo misleading  Came lunch voucher hotel because brunch hours prices $30 per person  weren't any seafood 1 meat station mostly cheap breakfast items   definitely good place lunch  Stayed around gamble dinner looked good some crab legs lamb other foods   Dessert place also small   at price level definitely Wicked Spoon over MGM Grand  <EOR> Yuck   Big selection but salty hell  Mimosas tasted chemicals  sushi joke   even saw them pour eggs plastic bag  only fresh ones over easy not even omelets! DEFINITELY look different buffet experience LV <EOR> We stopped afternoon serving champagne brunch  brunch food okay ton selection vegetarian allergic nuts though since lot foods involved pesto  did enjoy homefries though very tasty also some very yummy coffee cake  deserts overall tasty  boyfriend thought food okay but would liked see bit more selection  server extremely nice kept drinks refilled  <EOR> Just O K   Went breakfast twice my parents senior citizens sure love buffet recent three day trip Vegas  Food typical buffet fare  did enjoy cinnamon rolls although pretty sure can   The best part Mimosas only $2 00  Jackpot!! <EOR> Buffet amazing! only came dinner great price $29 99 adult  all eat crab prime rib every night  Kids 4 under eat free  Everyone very nice courteous! <EOR> Totally worth $ 29 99 per adult  lack variety foods  Even simple shrimp cocktail didn't have  sushi tasted looked cheap sushi found grocery stores  first slice steak okay but couldn't even cut through second slice  crab legs pineapples good but very disappointed trip here  don't think ever back here   <EOR> Food nasty   dessert nasty  Wanted spit food into napkin but waiter never brought any    matter fact waiter section??

No obviously cut corners! somewhere else money! <EOR> So disappointed  paid $32 brunch quality food felt just Golden Corral  Earlier week ate Wynn buffet abs great    this waste money  If priced $10 $15 range would less disappointing!

Honestly wherever even Mc Donalds better cheaper!!! <EOR> Went brunch Saturday morning line wasn't bad 11am  noticed upon exiting some self pay kiosk terminals would beneficial when lines long   They omelette station two eggs over easy  recommend over egg mix use omelets powdered eggs scrambled   other breakfast area potatoes Portuguese sausage    I then found salmon lox capers onion made killer croissant sandwich  No bagels? Finished some fresh fruit Greek yogurt    A lot stuff looks good but wasn't according friends  aren't any high end items prime rib crab legs lamb   solid 2 5 stars 3 but watch eat enjoy your meal feel slug rest day  <EOR> Ugh friends disappointed time around all together before figured going same second time around but wasn't   wait really short but when couldn't figure why wait all dining room near empty 6PM Saturday   Isn't dinner time?  ambiance really weird air conditioning stale did seem turned high enough   sampled spinach gnocchi cheese polenta cheese ravioli curried sea bass well vegetarian pizza variety deserts must admit best part meal according taste buds desert even mediocre   Sorry but if spend $32 99 tax expect some outstanding food outstanding   Sorry MGM Grand Buffet back  <EOR> Average less   Nothing special buffet expect people figured buy all drink option good drunk before heading pool day!    Pretty smart way much cheaper buzz!    Honestly nothing really stood above average buffet except maybe salad bar   decent     I would hate come group 5 more because automatically add 18% gratuity your bill   don't mind tipping usually over 18% but buffet where fill your own drinks??   kind crazy  <EOR> Nice food good fresh definitely better quality Monte Carlo buffet day prior but overpriced  Just   f*cking ridiculously overpriced came over $60 wife breakfast here   Also line insanely long some machines use your credit card which did which did least help speed things along but hostesses seating people some cranky old b*tches really shouldn't working public   For breakfast buffet wasn't insane amount choice standard breakfast items pancakes eggs sausage thin gross bacon cereal but fruit really good everything did seem really fresh don't fully regret it  meal credit MGM figured we'd all right didn't know would wind costing much though would even higher if more reasonably priced  If plan going sure coupon something worth full price but might worth half cost   Also seating area little tight lots doucebags leave chairs far shit stockpiled around tables which made difficult navigate back table  Also would much happier if didn't always some ridiculously long line in  <EOR> I expected much better place MGM considering seemed lot thought into everything they've done  But wasn't really impressed buffet here  food admittedly fresh but flavours just wasn't definitely lack food variety considering price paying it  The waitress service however cannot fault even though beginning seemed little confusing change table 3 times before supposed sitting on  <EOR> Breakfast $25 person plus $8 bottomless mimosas  money worth there  Basic buffet stuff fr both breakfast lunch  oImelet station taco station normal breakfast foods eggs bacon breads potatoes nice dessert station    Lunch $20 person  Same stuff breakfast bar without breakfast food obviously  Dessert station bit larger    Service very nice   which always plus    Overall   both bit pricey but hey   it's Vegas  Enjoy! <EOR> Food service commensurate price   remembered 10 years ago   recommended never coming back   The food generally bland very warm   service extremely slow   Perhaps understaffed? <EOR> This review dinner buffet  better expected be  line long but moved fast  don't recall exact price but think around $40? additional $15 dollars think unlimited cocktails    Beer wine already included regular buffet price  cocktails good weak good deal  cocktails list Strawberry margarita good came salt around rims Bloody Mary Whiskey Sour I way strong Peach Bellini Tequila sunrise I think few more but don't recall were    You wristband if cocktails  only cocktail time but excludes beer wine order two drinks once if them beer wine lol    I husband wine few times  line little long drinks sometime when no around even if already drink  only guy making drinks    As food made order steaks steamed crab legs  husband no shame  He before crowd formed told chef just give three steaks now he'll just back more later lol  chef laughed  He gave piece good  crab legs but weren't good  shrimp too  carving stations sausages other meats but didn't try that  should've   They also lot Asian food there  chow mein fried rice ran fast  orange chicken good too  also liked garlic bread  large selection drinks there  serve yourself place  desserts good  tried frozen yogurt strawberry cheesecake chocolate pecan bar    I'm surprised didn't even buzzed three four drinks   Maybe ate much alcohol affect idk  ate much good food now gained few pounds ugh! eating healthy again  loose some weight  don't much selection salad bar but when you're buffet really even going eat much salad? lol  Salad everyday food vacation food IMHO lol   Oh don't try cut front people  Especially husband  guy tried he almost plate full food spilled lol  husband super fast lol He oooppss   lol! <EOR> I little disappointed buffet especially since MGM Grand where high hopes being impressed heard Vegas buffets being really good   Disappointment set soon reached bar breakfast   sausage patties dry eggs rubbery consistency potatoes weren't fully cooked   Fortunately hungry enough walking all over strip night before   ahead pass buffet unless stumble drunk hungry leave your expectations behind Vegas strip! <EOR> Fantastic service food   omelet chef machine !!!  He 8 orders going once ! <EOR> The price Sunday brunch wasn't great all   But due fact checking Vegas day luggage fact near MGM didn't really help convince other places go   With said food rather decent   really just type food would come expect buffet salads meats pastas etc   However fond sushi where sushi actually better other buffets serve sushi   Also desserts above average compared other buffets serve type   Overall enjoyed location but if choice would probably somewhere else price quality  <EOR> We decided wait dinner buffet looking lunch buffet  lunch buffet wasn't anything special  We told dinner buffet would shrimp crab legs   No shrimp only  Saturday Sunday    The crab legs cut half served cold   take them chef meat carver drop them warm water ya  The quality food okay   Nothing special    Wasn't worth money maybe  why MGM gives two free passes buffet? I can't recommend buffet  <EOR> Simply put WAY worth money!   Other roasted section all cuisine gets shaking heads origin! aren't even much! 10 min  Into actually ran choice!  If can't enough meal credit staying @ hotel pay $10 more Aria Wynn much better experience! <EOR> My husband visited MGM Grand buffet Sun evening 8 2  used two M Life  believe would worth full price  We found Salad bar set well only 2 selections deep could reach back easily   items green pea shoots which nice treat  There nice selection chilled shrimp cold crab legs steamed crab legs  crab legs split open easier access  The carving station roasted turkey kielbasa prime rib  prime rib delicious although cooked much husband's taste   A notable dessert peanut butter gelato which tasted butterfinger candy bars there also delicious bread pudding vanilla sauce add yourself  The drink service great dishes removed promptly   definitely back  <EOR> I'll keep review short sweet  Tried few buffets vegas far far worse  Food quality MAYBE step golden corral  Only thing golden corral prices slop better place  Just reference buffet bellagio last night best buffet ever only $5 more per person place    Staff ok but nothing brag about  brought sodas could tell right off bat diet soda  told lady she says people saying all night??!! Then why warn first??  Won't back      ever <EOR> So price wouldn't back 60 00 2 us  Food good but very random choices  during brunch pleasantly quiet  Service good  table cleaned quickly staff friendly  But nothing really stood would revisit  <EOR> For breakfast today all MGM Grand Buffet  Unfortunately isn't used few years back  pricey side $30 00 per person  Atmosphere nice service ok but food    not much  <EOR> Insipid food     pathetic selection      rundown outdated decor desperate need  remodel    40 bucks this! Wake MGM <EOR> Wow Yelp reviews sadly correct  check place came big fight haven't MGM stayed since 2003! Wanted see if all remembered be  first buffet ever once upon time ago first trip Vegas when 21 years old! things changed didn't much culinary experience compare place never know now though  know place ridiculously over priced wilted disgusting salad horrible rude service only walk away mimosa bar holding 1 drink  tried order carry fiancée's mimosa table abruptly told he would take own seriously? going drunk orange juice splash champagne? Lol! come Santa Barbara home Harry's Joe's where order drink  ALL need! Coffee bitter burnt! Everything gross time home evening starving! Never again! No!

I wasn't expecting much honest pleasantly surprised  place clean most items refilled regularly plates removed tables and service better fancier Strip buffets     Beverages self serve which always perk kids  Coke machine which lets customize your soda  Milk chocolate milk flavored waters coffee tea juices    Some food surprisingly very good pizza NY style delish  great broccolini dish chicken fajitas fresh tasting veggies tender moist chicken  Asian assortment mostly mediocre some tasted frozen appetizers like egg rolls although dumplings pretty good chicken dish  Salad bar decent fresh veggies  excellent pecan crusted fish dish fried chicken pasta course dessert bar which hit miss   Didn't try sushi even best buffets tend put poor sushi  Lots options bunch pretty good items fill up   For price especially comparison prices anything Strip very pleasant brunch experience  Nothing fancy but pretty good food  wouldn't way visit again but if stay MGM I'd definitely give another shot  <EOR> Very good service decent food selections  The wait very quick dinner  5 minutes seats  lighting environment very comfortable stay eat in  Our waiter very responsive always within reach  all soft drinks time returned grabbing food  We dinner ok selections  My favorite crab legs roast beef cuts avocado fish  Desserts delightful satisfied sweet tooth 3 times   Recommended Vanilla ice cream non soft serve   Very creamy soothing  <EOR> Full disclosure did pay buffet included room MGM but yet still promise review still express full honest opinion buffet   The breakfast weekend mimosas worth price admission alone  keep glass full even give cup  food you'd expect most buffets assortment fruits chicken fish other proteins vegetables while nothing special all cooked well fresh   For buffet MGM more met expectations since normally give all guest least free meal Grand Buffet think well worth visit  <EOR> Short wait line very courteous staff  food atmosphere outstanding  only speak breakfasts because only place it  also give little carafe coffee which loved  $20 buffet breakfast can't it! <EOR> Garbage  Dried old food  need your own beverages  food bland nasty  No variety extremely over priced garbage  Any other Hotel better  If want ripped off stand line crap  <EOR> Ate because convenient since stayed Signature   should taken cab somewhere else   cost ridiculous food get   would appreciated Hometown Buffet more far taste quality food price goes  <EOR> I surprised place touts word Grand buffet could present such dismal display food  am glad opted eat all day offering lest would lost money because wouldn't wanted back  lunch buffet food cold only thing hot chinese food  MGM prices less Hometown buffet cuisine  best needs makeover  dessert offerings amusing most  <EOR> Meh  experienced better  pretty much sums MGM Grand Buffet   dinner comped didn't pay but paid would pretty upset   Outside crab legs maybe shrimp cocktail buffet didn't offer anything could consider 'premium '  seafood limited food mediocre best   initial first round didn't find anything particularly wanted back seconds   would highly suggest avoiding sushi rolls most likely previously frozen fresh   station where customize your seafood dish didn't fact served swordfish because 1 They're very good 2 good ecosystem   found most people end getting swordfish because only other fish he cook tilapia  cheap dirty fish     Overall very disappointing experience   don't remember MGM Grand Buffet being bad but looks since no buffet anymore i e  little no line they've also downgraded quality serve  <EOR> I Vegas past weekend spent $800 casinos   yet left Vegas very happy  ate MGM Grand buffet spent $85    yet left feeling very ripped off    Seriously two adults $80 price didn't include alcohol  would okay if buffet amazing but wasn't  small line breakfast food above quality gets Denny's $4 99  Other stuff dry and or cold selection meager  just don't give crap obviously place exists people needing use comp points  walked inside first thing thought myself KNEW SHOULD YELPED PLACE FIRST!

Yes staff quite nice picked plates but  all do  Music irritating floors sticky places  just another overpriced worth all experience  <EOR> Don't here  plenty other buffets Vegas within same price range better food service    Our server never showed mention food bland cold  Tons variety others mentioned but dish worth $35 person dinner  You're better off going somewhere else  <EOR> If want know strength buffet during dinner because  where pull all guns out  comped no brainer meal use on   I'll say outside maybe prime rib crab legs really average spread  Even dessert bar wasn't anything excited about  usual suspects pizza mac n cheese Chinese food sushi etc  but hard time figuring because don't waste appetite fillers carbs    At $30 pop isn't outrageous but could better  server also just ok  adds experience too  Considering ton restaurants inside resort kind expect buffet step up  MGM isn't known buffet now know why  <EOR> I guest hotel past weekend  actually 3 days row Friday Sunday    Can't complain recent visit  noticed improvement food  try brunch long Dinner well  friends enjoyed it  No complaints us  chef managing hot grill making shrimp chicken steak plates point  He very friendly pro he doing  didn't name but remember name tag El Salvador it  Props him! hope MGM Buffet management acknowledge work    The buffet pricey but bet back?

Sushi crab claws amazing desserts majority piled plate when ate here   Whether want Mexican food seafood Italian Chinese food great place diverse selection food   espceially helpful if traveling group whether friends family no decide place eat at   Why choose type food when variety  all isn't buffets for? Plus buffet Vegas  Let repeat all eat crab claws   Oh yes   Don't worry having fret dessert too   Most desserts saw tiny bite bite before know you've tried six different desserts all them just bite full!  great way indulge without paying price later sugar crash  <EOR> Ok buffets thing but quite honest try one   friends suggested went   Don't stand line buy your way kiosk left line pay   For $27 99 all champaign drink! Let's face two mimosas breakfast cost amount   The buffet full great items including smoked salmon shrimp waffles made order omelet desserts Mexican food many other items! loved fresh fruit salad bar peel eat shrimp!  The champaign free flowing   staff very attentive come often  time limit long stay but don't over due it!   No doubt number buffets Vegas but bad deal couple hours kill  <EOR> Thirty bucks steak crab legs  Kinda pricey easily overpriced  back  I'd rather Luxor Excalibur all day 15 bucks more  glad business trip expensed  Here's breakdown why The steak rediculously overdone which see why would drown sauce  The Roast Beef carving station looked more ball muscle literally just lopped off cow  Yeah hey lets trim looks fine    mean sure looks meatball alien thing Duke Nukem but people love nostalgia  The macaroni cheese creamy but only tasted macaroni  Why would serve this? The Crab legs    sliced through would assume table saw  Nothing screams delicious small bits crab leg shell steamed out dried blade o grass thin crab legs  After essentially given great eating decided try lower quality food   hell sweet sour chicken chicken nuggets? Oh guys do  nuggets? only thing missing Double Bubble Branding  I didn't want delve into why whys hows because wasn't going pretty but is  hope MGM rise mess actually produce decent food again soon  <EOR> This only Bunch     cost 27 00 way expensive dish out!! Try Mandalay Bay won't disappointed!!! Trust ME!!! Sorry MGM items very weak look BAY!! <EOR> Dinner Tuesday $30 plus $14 99 unlimited cocktails champagne  mimosas beers wines margaritas daiquiris yes decor dated but food good  great but good all really wanted crab legs anyway plenty! stuffed when left could barely back room!  My friend enjoyed prime rib roasted pork belly  Server Great! Kept glasses full removed dirty plates quickly   I enjoyed buffet  Delicious crab legs First time Vegas only buffet experience while there  left full happy little full    Just need skip yummy desserts next time  <EOR> The price crazy high mediocre food took 15 minutes cup coffee     after getting ask manager     crappy service crappy food McDonalds you'll better off <EOR> Been twice felt food alright  meat selection small felt all meats cooked well done  crab legs however actually pretty good  steamed cold  desserts alright well  nothing really stood me  server really nice friendly though <EOR> We came last dinner Las Vegas even though buffet completely full waiting time seat 20 30 Sunday said because cleaning tables  They big selection food including crabs legs salty stake ok crawfish good price pay expecting little bit better  They bottomless Wine beer  The services     well said restaurant wasn't busy but took forever remove dirty dishes table mean buffet pricey higher expectations  <EOR> My last breakfast buffet during last trip Las Vegas Excalibur  Same company same area so expected same type food  Boy mistaken  Eggs benedict    When put fork through egg   actually runny egg yolk   Next check biscuits gravy   Biscuits weren't rock hard hockey pucks  Infact soft fluffy  Mimosa champagne also included  Freshly made waffles   awesome  They even spicy tuna rolls  Totally caught off guard good quality  <EOR> Nothing bad      nothing especially good either  fancy myself low bourgeois level but am generally fan buffets  idea food prepared Me    Everybody  being said Buffet very good  wasn't anything bad but nothing made back more  lost when no creme brûlée dessert option  no snow crab legs only dungeon crab hard work crab   pass should too  <EOR> Oh goodness    hate writing reviews primarily because place usually bad can't help but *sigh* through entire review    *sigh*  I would given 1 star but service really good    hence extra star   Not only did food lack taste but buffet lacked variety most food wasn't even warm    *sigh*  I usually don't throw away food but literally took bite each thing offered rest boyfriend the garbage disposal   lol Whatever he didn't eat just thrown away  actually prefer Hometown Buffet says lot  those familiar Hometown Buffet     exactly    lol  Do yourself HUGE favor skip one  <EOR> I came because free buffet stay MGM grand  food wasn't great staff whatever  Most likely never come again better experience Aria buffet  <EOR> Given almost every restaurant MGM seems pricey buffet bad    It totally self serve good assortment items   marriage though seems never ending selection half baked choices   If late serving meal start bringing dishes next meal even more items   Nice desserts  <EOR> Boy love buffets  love trying all types food would normally try myself  love going plate plate  love mixing breakfast lunch dinner dessert all sitting    The problem Grand Buffet didn't find anything exciting first two rounds  omelet line way long buffet  going fill salad bar wasn't even exciting    The sushi pass  No brainer made beforehand since platters    Salads salad bar nothing exciting there    Meat Chili BBQ chicken good mainly drumsticks wings  fried shrimp good cooked shrimp little small side slimy    Dessert liked most tiny little cups took fair sampling  bite two each but didn't find any wanted devour  chocolate dipped Rice Krispie Treats nice surprise but chocolate waaaayy sweet  you'll rarely hear disparaging chocolate    It also costs $2 50 extra per person bottomless mimosas  premixed  iced tea brewed fountain  Yuck    Next time try Spice Market buffet Planet Hollywood even though gone down hill since no longer Aladdin Bellagio even though more pricey  <EOR> Absolutely worst buffet ever to   today celebrate Mom's birthday 42 99 piece would assume food would good   wasn't   Everything bland   no oysters this     they give seafood   won't allow yourself    And if want drinks    you them YOURSELF     there no service   I spoke supervisor told horrific was   asked if he would pay kind money eat he could give answer   don't blame him     No issues employees but almost $125 literally worst buffet ever had    there just no words say   Please re think your choice   really hope change quality selection because don't think come back     I already expect usual reply let chefs know    Please give REAL ANSWER      I am trying knock it     but darn it    such disappointing ending birthday   Ruined terrible meal  <EOR> Amazing food just ambiance if don't smells cigarettes Air all all Deliciously good  <EOR> Very good value   best Buffett but far worst   Steak  medallions cooked order very good  <EOR> I two free brunch tickets stopped around 11 00  line super long but bypassed virtue free passes  typical Las Vegas buffets ton choices best take tour before filling plates  Highlights Prime Rib grilled order NY Steaks Chinese style fish  pay your own cocktails which lost star because server wanted cash payment  scam but guess    <EOR> This buffet terrible terribly expensive  Unless you're just into mass consumption just want gorge yourself food can't worth meal it   Bellagio Ceasers anywhere but here   selection terrible      Oh sure don't eat shortly before going airport catch your red eye   Disaster waiting you  <EOR> Good selection food all tastes  favorite custom omelet station since choose exactly into omelet knew fresh  loved variety desserts offered  Great way start day big buffet free unlimited mimosas  <EOR> The food just ok  Nothing rave about  Almost 90 bucks two people  Definitely worth price  I'd rather eat wicked spoon price  Friendly staff but doesn't tasteless food  somewhere else if want great dinner choice  <EOR> This place just average when comes buffets nothing really stands out  decent quality meal little high price  <EOR> Not very good  food pretty bland don't lot choices  omelette guy messed both omelette up  He only listened first three things said then just did thing  all impressive  somewhere else  free room rather pay food like   Update all sushi buffet gave husband food poisoning  He ended vomiting bathroom rest trip  He bursted blood vessels face violent vomiting  tickets David Copperfield couldn't couldn't refund  <EOR> Ten years ago place best   Wife Saturday brunch last month   arrived 11am   Paid $60 unlimited mimosa brunch   All wanted bagels lox ham omelette     The buffet halfway mark meaning wasn't going close another 4 hours   bagels   stockers look more bagels she said day   said mean no bagels entire casino hotel? She said yes   Went meat station ham   No more ham rest day   Got omelette over cooked     Bottom line would asked $60 bucks back but hungry   only reason place 2 stars mimosa service   guy brings mimosa ended bringing two pint glasses champagne   even saw fill pitcher full champagne guy   Now  classy!    Bottom line won't going again when Vegas  <EOR> A friend came Sunday brunch because $25 credit toward dining $25 per person ended paying half each  Which probably would want pay buffet   The food very hit miss  did scrambled eggs although hard mess powdered scrambled eggs breakfast potatoes which moist nicely seasoned California roll sushi cheesy polenta  But perhaps best thing fresh fruit  namely pineapple slices  glad fruit all fresh   On flip side gnocchi tasted it'd sitting several hours blueberry blintzes doughy tasted uncooked fried shrimp mostly just batter batter very bland creme brulee custard tart thing even blander rice krispie treat dried fruit icing okay but extremely soggy crispy all   The waitress serving beverages incredibly creepy  asked two coffees when she only brought empty coffee cup large container hot coffee pointed wanted two    She glared reluctantly looked down pad Oh you're right asked two  You're allowed snippy when wrote down order screwed up  Then when she brought second cup she'd filled coffee glared again when she put down  then every time she walked she'd look funny   No joke friend ended pouring coffee into bowl because she afraid waitress spit something   Definitely going come back unless free  <EOR> Horrible!!!

Avoid place all costs even if eat free  unfortunate blemish otherwise fantastic experience MGM  <EOR> Most people stay MGM eat free least discounted price   didn't but still thoroughly impressed buffet   quality best but served all food like   typical food 12 year old likes lol   pasta dishes hamburgers etc   place it   Really stuffed myself = Derek <EOR> During Interop 2010 decided eat myself nights there  Didn't want hit Burger Bar 50th time previous managers last work place cuz  only restaurant he'll eat whenever we're tradeshows   This buffet does job if you're seriously craving seafood Indian desserts  really loved crab legs chicken curry had  dessert station plentiful  Tons tons delicious cakes tarts  If didn't work next morning would paid extra $5 unlimited mimosas  Then would probably given buffet extra star  <EOR> You'll miss breakfast if you're late 100oz drink Fat Tuesday  Still pricey very similar all other buffets  <EOR> This FREE hotel stay breakfast good   WOW but good   BONUS FREE hotel stay   Grazers enjoy       troughs where full pork products fruit eggs cakes pies pancakes ham etc       very well stocked just breakfast   Cook order omelettes nom nom btw       well short order egg orders   Service very good something caught surprise many times Las Vegas free comp breakfasts lucky refill beverage staff outstanding   Kudos them  <EOR> Buffet pricing shown online  Customer Service could provide direct phone number Buffet but said only 3 year younger eat free   Buffet price $39 99 adults $19 99 kids 4 12 11 am 12 24 25 weekend  Weekend brunch $29 99 $19 99 until 11 am  take out box cost $10 less dine in which could family eat much   Monday 12 26 16 follows regular price $17 99 breakfast lunch? $12 99 to go box $29 99 dinner  <EOR> When come Vegas point stop buffet MGM Grand    There large disparity between price value most restaurants Las Vegas but buffet clean well managed great diversity choices    I fact don't peel shrimp choices quite numerous    The main course selections such Prime Rib Turkey Steak Ham others all great but could better selection deserts    For $35 plus tip cheap but sit long want eat your heart's content!  If you're staying MGM Grand gambling property buffet worth trip! <EOR> We've MGM buffet before but remember having better memories possibly because 5 years ago   $35 seriously expected much more  fair if calculate cost crab legs eat $35 worth you're set but if consider general quality assortment other items then $35 definitely better both buffets non buffets  Quite frankly think should just spent $35 person eaten finer establishment    Aside ubiquitous crab legs peel and eat shrimp very puny limp looking were Smoked salmon capers lemon onions Assortment cold cuts e g  salami olives cheese Taco bar Prime rib Ham Turkey breast I think Rolls lots! Pizza pepperoni combo cheese veggie overall very bready Small salad bar Minestrone soup Miso soup Black bean soup Some kind pressed flat steak grilled order Dim sum the wrappers didn't look right firm Beer battered fish big pieces though batter looked very dark thick Tempura shrimp more battered shrimp traditional tempura shrimp Chinese food e g  broccoli beef something that Mac cheese Fried chicken Four types sushi e g  faux crab meat California rolls Fruit Assorted desserts cupcakes beignets etc  generally speaking overly sweet bland Ice cream soft serve  Honestly $35 MGM buffet only appropriate those emphasize quantity over quality  know shouldn't expect much buffet but selection food aside shrimp crab legs Sizzlers Home Town Buffet both those charge way less  If wasn't MGM probably could understand general lack quality but seriously expected more MGM  those want buffet Vegas didn't care much quality then would just pick cheaper buffets Strip also includes crab legs shrimp call day  course if discounted comped your stay then all means take advantage it  <EOR> Shhh  key around 3 30pm just before dinner  charged Lunch which couple dollars cheaper  Just stay until dinner starts let fun begin!

One more thing sure if only during time but increased lunch dinner prices significantly   over 50%  two people costs $84 includes taxes sub par food  No thank you  just expect better Vegas  Please take advice eat actual restaurant higher quality food  most likely less   I won't back  <EOR> BOMB COM x2!!! am shocked buffet 2 5 rating  friends hungover starving  all critical eaters impressed! everything every style cooking  If craving something more likely it! Granted friends great deal buffet but utterly great variety everything  coming back here! <EOR> Not just your average Las Vegas buffet breakfast  Yes sure scrambled eggs powdered but omelet station did disappoint  Plenty variety when comes breakfast meats wide assortment fruits pastries   prices little high I'd 5 stars but hey Vegas    <EOR> Garbage  worth money  Even inebriated wasn't tasty satisfying  Wouldn't eat even sake convenience  <EOR> I waited awesome meal place visited over decade ago   remember prime rib crab seafood before but disappointed selection time  more Chinese Mexican fruits remember   saw no real potatoe dishes other mashed   Sushi wasn't good   However prime rib great crab abundant calamari excellent   Pre made salads good   husband meat potatoes he barely found stuff eat   would see price matches lack selection   would see more sushi tastes good more hot crab cold crab  <EOR> This definitely last minute choice   mainly because hotel across way lazy drive good buffet  guess price can't complain  But going anyway  Lame food lame service   just lame  First last time here! far buffets better planning next time  <EOR> Am little bit late writing review but figured heck  Well starters line just pay huge when finally cashier pay realized another line just table WTF??!! Once seated everything well waiter wish would name very nice made sure cups always full made sure always pick dirty plates  very large variety food everything sushi Mexican food everything freshly made  wish dessert area more variety everything also bite size but overall pretty good  far price am sure because scored free vouchers but believe  $15 kids 4 12 $19 99 adults drinks included  during lunch time think price if during dinner time <EOR> Pros Huge variety   Wonderful staff     Cons Price think $39 99 per person dinner   overall taste food good   would recommend buffet  <EOR> It gets harder harder justify all eat buffet   Selection ok   large resort expected more  <EOR> They great selection food but all tasted good looked  ate bunch fruit some potatoes some bacon  other dishes tried great didn't finish them  think most part upset because price  $25 per adult wasn't able even come close eat much worth food  felt service staff nice but kind slow  took while drinks  wish cheaper buffets Vegas! <EOR> After eating almost wanted warn people waiting line just walk away  Seriously? $40 per person during weekends dinner uninspiring buffet joke  Sure prime rib NY Steak crab legs shrimp but everything else mediocre best  room itself very uninspiring college dining commons looked nicer  staff nice enough but service slow waitress forgot bring drink order few times  just very average buffet charging ridiculous prices  money I'd rather Wicked Spoon Cosmo Cravings buffet Mirage Buffet Aria Bellagio  only thing place going its MyVegas redemption less restrictions other MGM Resort buffets     <EOR> A bit pricey buffet but holiday weekend bill ran $38   food selection buffet definitely better most   california rolls potstickers mac n cheese vegetable lasagna all very tasty!

Again am tipping for? guess take plates away which did good job suppose   To honest self serve soft drink policy but hated tipping advance nothing part  food   The food bleh  first word popped into head  Vegas much better than   bleh   Its President's Day didn't see any prime rib   ? Then did charge extra for? I know prime rib usually reserved dinner but if pay extra $$$ then pony better meat MGM! ham turkey brisket  turkey good brisket tasted good but drier rougher dead cat's tongue  ham pedestrian  also some kielbasa which OK  carver did cut meats extra thick suppose   Their salad OK things salad but still was   bleh  less then 20 choices lot variety some reason sliced vegetables really thick including radishes   They other things ravioli not terrible Asian section I tried dumplings precooked frozen ones breakfast items waffles didn't try bacon looked tasted cooked surface sun sausage patties looked tasted done duty Olympic hockey pucks on  Nothing great really good best edible    They Mexican station  taco meat queso  guac among things which going try but no taco shells tortillas nothing put things on!
