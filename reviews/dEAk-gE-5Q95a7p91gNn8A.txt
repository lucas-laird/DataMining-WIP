The name's now changed Sushi Koma because another restaurant federally trademarked 'Sushi Freak ' place bit small sitting maybe 30 people most  friend immediately greeted sushi chef walked in  Prices pretty standard' AYCE lunch $21 95 dinner $25 95    I found myself eating more appetizers nigiri rolls  Tuna Carpaccio die sadly only 1 order per person  Sashimi Roll alright but lacked flavor  surprised didn't Agedashi Tofu menu since usually pretty popular appetizer  Yellowtail nigiri must order fact all nigiri fresh tasty  don't skimp each slice unlike some other places to  rolls good but only room stomach try 3 half orders definitely try more next time    Other fresh fish stood most great service  2 waitresses very attentive patient always checking sure plates being cleared drinks refilled  didn't fake attitude genuinely nice serving which something don't see much days    Overall great food great service back soon! <EOR> You try tuna carpaccio!!! best item menu  best sushi restaurant vegas  <EOR> So good! best AYCE sushi places town  more limited sushi roll menu meaning many rolls very similar ingredients but all pretty tasty  highly recommend restaurant! very small restaurant prepared right next other people conversations while dining here  <EOR> I sushi fan  tried once many years ago fan  invited Sushi Koma decided give more chance  glad did! food great! server recommended some really good things! plan going again near future! <EOR> So came husband Saturday night around 9 30pm restaurant semi busy only few people dining area  waitress sat right away took drink orders decided AYCE we're disappointed  husband big fan raw stuff he really excited many cooked roll choices   other hand love nigiri  lot items choose left happy full   Only thing little annoying seating once gets full tables very crowded squeeze through all chairs tables   <EOR> Tried place based decent reviews close house  First time great second time  well use restroom soon eating there   food poisoning anything big but just fresh     Price compatible other AYCE places   appetizer selections bit more varieties usual suspects   sashimi roll   warming TINY   size finger no joke   Although refreshing tasting  it's just bit small     I don't normally eat rolls eat real fish nigiri tell if fish fresh not   can't review if rolls good not     I don't add sauce all nigiris you   But inform sushi chef waiter put sauce top you   learned few orders came tell them stop   sauce spectacular anything seems ponzu soy sea salt but just seems want cover unfreshness fish?  Maybe  intension but why would it?  capable dunking pieces nigiri wasabi soy ourselves     They also add sea salt scallops  which scallops really salty   little yuzu would just fine     Overall decent AYCE place best worst   Service great bit tiny pretty overwhelming times  <EOR> This place recommended co worker can't thank enough   now become fav AYCE sushi places  restaurant small even smaller tables but food more tight quarters  staff very attentive they're open till 3am!

AYCE ate til sushi koma   wasn't thing didn't love    The quality fish superb! nigiri tasted came straight outta ocean very tender  some places where fish taste chewy    The service great! definitely coming back here!!! <EOR> Just discovered amazing sushi place Vegas  All eat sushi dinner $25 95  server Aileen super friendly atmosphere fun blast  Check out! <EOR> I Sushi Koma some time ago few years back pretty great experience  didn't chance write review then guess now   They previous smaller location gone guess since moved bigger same plaza more towards back end  apparently done 2 3 months ago  remember newer place better  lot more space only people but also decor sushi bar definitely bigger   The place looks very nice inside more traditional feel previous place  feel easily detracted tacky decor contrasting wallpaper although did feel there  However did question quite object need big screen TV sushi restaurant I believe may even more one    We came party 3 hankering sushi 1 30 AM Tuesday can't say know service during peak times  seated immediately orders taken very soon after  server very kind patient questions orders  Yes half rolls! The quality fish definitely better most places tried town price all relatively same AYCE Las Vegas  dinner price $25 95 per person which believe great price decent amount variety quantity  appetizers hit spot hand rolls taste quite fresh  Most pretty standard although MUST try Tuna Carpaccio!  I HIGHLY recommend Big B Roll! Although only roll per person  any shrimp tempura roll but added teriyaki beef top  definitely something different but combine chef's special sauce somehow works very well together  also enjoyed Bank Roll PCH Ninja Rainbow Roll Tropicana Roll  definitely point try some different things next visit  ratio fish to rice rolls decent saw no attempt cram ton seaweed rice very few protein between   For food pretty great but service really made night spectacular  server's name Ben hope again next time! always taken care whenever he needed he never forgot when came more rolls refills drinks  Unlike most servers he also very stiff nor he shy making good conversation without also forgetting attend duties  VERY fun guy indeed he super easy talk moment seated   My only complaint while music good fun WAY loud  Thankfully friends very vocal laughed hard didn't mind much end  But if you're trying more quiet dinner may exactly place it   I can't wait come back! <EOR> Love Love Love Love Love place  'Nough said  <EOR> I could write book bad experience Sushi Koma but just hit main points  It lunchtime ordered lunch special   wife ordered few pieces sushi which brought quickly  After better part half hour lunch special nowhere sight   flagged down waitress asked if order forgotten   She kitchen came back promising coming soon  This lunchtime order lunch special   Why would take half hour produce? chefs kitchen forgot order break whatever  At point wife just wanted did I   completely lost appetite   told waitress box everything take out  About 10 minutes later lunch special arrived missing four pieces sushi which supposed included  We complained again show waitress menu prove order supposed include sushi   She correct mistake  After another 10 minutes chef behind counter glanced direction put container counter grunted rather rudely   while walked over asked if me   He just grunted rudely again  When finally did sushi pieces very small child toddler size   Maybe chef wanted punish complaining  My wife Japanese commented rice which essence sushi substandard she would expect better first day apprentice Japan  The only upside waitress   didn't name but she must spent most free time tattoo shop next door because most visible body covered tattoos   issue she very polite attentive obviously working very hard right thing   spite everything wrong gave nice tip  <EOR> WOW!!

Great variety Sushi appetizers  <EOR> My coworkers decided try place international sushi day which happens fall birthday  small restaurant  Nothing fancy it  food came relatively fast but then again only ones restaurant  always order spicy scallop hand roll albacore nigiri yellowtail nigiri  best spicy scallop hand roll far Vegas  made 100% scallops fillers other restaurants town do  ordered many rolls really can't remember ordered  all good  Fresh awesome fish  last dish tempura ice cream  Strawberry ice cream isn't thing but tempura ice cream amazing  only complaint thought weird tempura decorated colored goldfishes you know cheddar little crackers commercial love fishes cuz they're delicious  Gotta fishin   Nothing horrible anything  just scooted fishes off side devoured fried frozen goodness   We also shared large bottle yuzu sake  sake those love flavored sake dislike alcohol burn   I definitely come back some more spicy scallop hand roll other sushi  <EOR> It first time Sushi Koma  came before back days when called Brain Beach Sushi  Always wanted come check since way hockey rink Thursday nights  Generally only read positive reviews it  friends visiting heard wanted check out  Never pass chance good sushi!

Small intimate environment vibe  Perfect service bunch phony pleasantries just everything filling glasses knowing exactly when ready order another roll  sushi world! Can't wait back! <EOR> I agree Jade service blows other AYCE places away  Maybe small format which sets Sushi Koma esteemed but AYCE Yummy Grill West Lake Mead Blvd apart rest  Drinks plates always being attended AYCE meal Koma doesn't take hour more could probably rip 25 mins suitably full belly   Speaking belly yellowtail belly salmon belly almost always available good quality tako sushi tender special tostada awesome gyoza addictive thinly wrapped perfectly pan toasted  could eat 100+ pieces if to   Unagi always good quality saba mackerel unusually delicate light made in house super smoky briny most places  love it  prefer live scallop on the shell Yummy Grill 'fresh' scallop version Koma but maybe  just me    You really feel appreciated customer here  Smiles among cool waitstaff plenty Koma chefs skills  Sushi Koma feels small NYC style spot except don't wait 45mins seat sushi bar   good feeling  <EOR> This sushi place become husband's favorite sushi place side town  When first came little bump road  But first night things started getting better more often  become friends wait staff owner  such amazing people  Judy which favorite waitress very bubbly personality very sweet  sushi chefs working stations fast can  gonna lie personally know sushi chefs Bryan  old friend mine  type person brag anything but many times coming spot staff knows some chef specials owner himself  He approached talk some customers  When owner staff found husband married congratulated gave dessert choice house  Even receipt wait staff wrote congrats!   I told parents treat others want treated  therefore treated people mad respect back them    It definitely doesn't take big name big space place good quality service  Sometimes tiny space best service good quality   Don't take words try yourself  <EOR> Let honest    This place way small feel comfortable  Maybe claustrophobic but anxiety ate  restaurant small especially when stick corner    Not very many options least when compared favorite place oshi sushi    Three times delivered other peoples rolls table asked if wanted refill drink    I didn't veggie rolls calamari shrimp tempura all served same sauce  Made seem bland generic    The only roll really loved oshi doesn't kimmey roll  asparagus very fresh loved crunch top  There's no way coming back roll though  <EOR> Everything delicous   fish fresh rice perfectly cooked  Staff friendly  <EOR> This place pretty good  liked atmosphere dim but still bright enough big party  15 people birthday celebration good service  constant didn't feel pressure ordering right  really patient huge orders salmon!  I liked taste salmon nigiri but wasn't anything memorable  usually put thin slices lemon top which most disregarded opt when don't want any! Also desert only per person but really needs more sushi buffet? Aha  thing really liked shrimp tempura  batter light oily    We ordered other things but nothing any other sushi place offers  reason why gave them 4 nothing memorable enough  <EOR> Omg best sushi place Vegas  Ever since new management Oyshi long shot!! love Tuna Carpaccio Sashimi Roll die for  fan Brians Beach YEARS but always reluctant because service awful new management definitely fixed that! Everyone extremely attentive nice  never anywhere else AYCE again! <EOR> Sushi Koma cute AYCE sushi place packed night ate here  Because there's whole lot floor space feel though restaurant better suited smaller parties  If must bring lot people yourself favor reservation staff time accommodate your party and you're waiting forever     Sushi quality fresh but nothing really stood me  Just your typical AYCE fare   I really sad limit type dessert! guess way keep costs down  But seriously can't girl eat weight mochi ice cream once while?   Anyway  food good try smaller group next time  <EOR> I hate give place bad review but experience BAD  arrived 8 20 ish told gonna 20 minute wait  didn't mind but 20 minutes turned into 40 minutes seated around 9 pm  then seated ordered but food didn't arrive until 9 30  understand busy waiter nice it  then ordered second round sushi came one  didn't see original waiter finished food 10 10  looked around wait checks but didn't see around but  Finally around 10 40 another lady asked if ready check which gave cards  don't understand why took 20 minutes process payment  restaurant died down wasn't busy anymore  absolutely dissatisfied everything  fact waiter left didn't inform drastic wait no checking us  wanted demand money back but didn't want ruin good date night but really hope manager sees this  <EOR> Don't let sign outside fool you   Sushi Freak Brian's Beach Sushi just haven't changed sign outside yet   sure check in right establishment   I actually wasn't hungry but while since ate made order AYCE sushi why only $26 dinner  order only small portion menu but easily would cost more $26  some shrimp tempura deep fried oysters octopus nigiri elephant roll red bean ice screen plus whatever else shared some specialty items sushi chef made us   Overall food very good but because didn't try more menu 4 which still very good book   Next time coming hungry   Service excellent  came party 7 Sushi Freak accommodated very well  no wait  spot bringing all orders quickly correct separating bills taking money   made specialty items just because said didn't finish them if didn't it   Don't remember long but didn't rush us   also treated number ones when first arrived till left excellent first impression   Definitely back    The dining area smaller but doesn't feel crammed  <EOR> This place really good! quite small dining area but cute  definitely few levels above most ayce places terms fish quality flavor selection rolls I don't overly saucy rolls   haven't tried lot kitchen stuff  salmon yellowtail ikura very yummy  would recommend place friends! <EOR> The new location impecable bigger everyone attentive tonight   love place good quality food amazing service warm welcoming ambiance  Thank Sushi Koma your amazing service  We'll keep coming back favorite sushi places  <EOR> The best sushi place Vegas   Just everything good sushi good customer services place definitely recommend anyone looking good place eat sushi <EOR> Sushi Koma favorite AYCE sushi joint   around 25 95 dinner   really selection rolls   dined quite few times thing most attention detail every roll   gone plenty sushi places where rolls look sloppy rice falling off avocado brown fish slipping roll every time gone every roll looks well prepared tastes same every time   consistent great quality food   only reason am giving them 5 stars because service extremely inconsistent   service always pleasant but sometimes flat freakin slow   time left because other moving bf another table acknowledged 20 minutes!

Just moved side town lucked finding it  food service great  little cozy see people might wait table but worth it  atmosphere very laid back casual <EOR> Service quick friendly sushi tasted great issue though many people taking orders rolls getting forgotten actual looked puzzled when asked volcano roll 15 minutes ordering since know takes while bake but she seemed believe wheb mentioned then she checked ready  But food good though just work little communication  <EOR> I loved place! fianc just 9yr anniversary co worker told place  am very picky when comes sushi must say place delicious!! fact small! close house think just found new spot  <EOR> The sushi amazing probably most freshest sushi far  only thing huge turn off service literally shit show plates dropping glass breaking etc  Best advice could give owner small place way many people serving just caused much confusion  Other organization skills everything great  <EOR> Ate second time forgot good place when first visited  would definitely say sushi joint ranks among top 3 town  Despite fact AYCE sushi Las Vegas dime dozen quality flavor Sushi Freak stood most  your typical rolls same typical names but then also own unique style rolls which give refreshing change  Furthermore also own special dishes Tuna Carpaccio could eat all day everyday definitely brought wow factor  restaurant very clean staff super nice service excellent theyre open till 3am  what's like? Reason give 4 stars instead 5 because 1 limit per person some specialty items  Personally AYCE sushi should offer EVERYTHING AYCE whether want 50 mochi ice creams 100 pieces fish  However sushi place absolutely still worth going whether sushi itch lunch midnight  fan going back regularly  <EOR> My favorite ACYE sushi restaurant town  Also Ben Julian both really great  Order Big B Tuna Carpaccio! <EOR> AYCE sushi UNI! order per person but good thing everyone loves much more me!! best rice fish ratio  appetizers also very tasty seaweed salad cucumber salad gyoza miso soup seared tuna also order half rolls vs full rolls don't fully stuff yourself! hand rolls well add avocado masago eggs free almost anything! call sushi koma because leave feeling you're going into coma all yummy food eat TRY all if can! Better group share try all  <EOR> Let start saying sushi AMAZING given hours operation would convenient late night dates outings  only reason gave three stars because service  restaurant all large seem well staffed  Everyone party AYCE throughout night several dishes seem gone missing never reached table  totally understandable considering party 8 but still kind interesting restaurant all busy when there  part really made overall experience just ok fact took them 30 minutes figure checks  asked separate checks front granted auto gratuity need figure parties over 6 took lot longer should have  Maybe just off night them but think might safer try place smaller party different hour when ordering la carte instead AYCE  <EOR> One favorite restaurants Las Vegas hands down   Completely UNDERRATED   take AYCE over any other   Food service   Standouts appetizers favorite part    Seafood tostada sashimi roll tuna carpaccio   Good god good!!  only though whereas other items unlimited   As far rolls gonna old school say tiger roll favorite   warm shrimp tempura along side cold spicy tuna   oh my!!  Random note spicy tuna actually spicy here   This must all eat lovers  <EOR> First time we're definitely coming back   best part literally down street us  staff all personable attentive  sushi combinations fresh delicious!! No disappointments  <EOR> I've going Sushi Koma awhile now cause friend said good  smaller joint which cool but then upgraded everything just bad now    At smaller fast quick friendly  Now bigger place they're slow just take time everything  girlfriend just all bad  waited 3 different servers tell host service bad  Took forever rolls more then enough severs    I gave place more chance tried lunch mom 3 tables 2 people bar  sit bar waiter running around trying everything she did great job but still slow thought wen sit bar tell people order faster  Guessed wrong she come take order give them when we're sitting right front them tell them  people next telling them orders but never acknowledged once unless order waiter  unless better servers ones small spot going cause you'll 1 1 2 2 hours just eat sushi  <EOR> Went twice week husband  sat bar same place both times served food rather quickly  girl took order friendly did best attend decently full restaurant   Sushi chefs quick would even ask if wanted anything else whenever finished sushi  place very small many mentioned but never crazy busy all times went  All sushi really good  baked salmon way creamy though  Considering full mind dish almost made hurl   The eel rolls amaaaaazing I am fanatic eel    Seaweed salad good  Pretty much everything good  Tuna carpaccio great!! Garlic tastes chips crazy   Great place sushi! <EOR> My husband took birthday  wait minimal although he called ahead reservation busy Friday evening few days before Thanksgiving    We both did AYCE  selection rolls items AYCE menu great  Lots variety something everyone  excited try many rolls may ordered many  found birthday thanks husband majority staff came table sing Happy Birthday brought amazing ice cream sundae  par everything else ice cream course delicious  customer service throughout time great  very attentive never empty glass  also did notice no '1 hour time limit' blurb AYCE menu  conscious much time but didn't feel rushed finish meal did other places  restaurant smaller side but use space well done The dcor industrial modern music play overhead perfect volume  definitely back  <EOR> Checked spot today take myself date  location strip mall outside quite quaint  But once walk well decorated really brings bit Asian feel place  Looks nice inside!   All employees nice when slow everyone very attentive    The nigiri really good very fresh  consisted most meal   Overall great sushi dinner but outstanding feature meal SABA mackerel nigiri good  best Saba ever soft lightly seasoned fresh garlic chives  ended ordering 'another order Saba' 3 times  probably come back just Saba  it!  It 4 stars 5 because some very minor service mishaps  wish could give 4 5 5    Also take note! Lunch price AYCE ends 3 now 4  Great little gem Vegas! <EOR> It's really hard give even 1 star  worst slowest most unfriendly service  mention no wifi   I several times various hours never experienced such horrible service  waiting 25 minutes addressed restaurant 1 2 capacity having ask wasabi ginger    it's corner   I sushi bar heaven sake watching others came receiving friendly service  What's even more amazing staff assumed couldn't understand them  SHAME them thinking can't speak understand Mandarin perhaps YELP address ignorance!  In closing what's more insulting server whom replaced situation more liking actually made worse inquiring if eaten all day if wanted half refill tap water    SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  Thank demeaning aptitude appetite! <EOR> My first time here  14 celebrate friend's birthday  first food coming quickly presented well  However someone ordered chicken bowl took 30min come out  When asked why taking long response put big order table said realize but ordered she did all rolls ordered came out  few people table keep asking drink refills where order them clear table etc    all divided servers some nice while few very rude  rice over cooked  say won't back there  <EOR> Found Sushi Koma while searching AYCE restaurants new side town on  Eileen awesome explained program worked  food chose delicious!

Finished workout LVAC needed post workout meal since didn't any home  since trainer said okay eat rice hard workout thought Why heck not? Definitely recommend doing AYCE since most rolls start $6 along apps starting around $4 $5 think    The sushi good well handed two other diners special   and boy special!  Tuna belly! could've ate days!  Perhaps twist nigiri but don't think nigiri suppose pool sauce   still good though  rice nigiri just fell apart no big deal because hungry    The mochi selection more most sushi places dined at   The tea really good toasted brown rice may see floating your tea but don't freak did thinking bug     The guys super chill atmosphere pretty good music    Happy Eats! <EOR> The sushi good all eat option definitely way go  menu pretty large love option order half rolls could try more menu without getting full two rolls appetizer menu lot options  only negative tables two super small round bedside table  But then again place small well  <EOR> Husband ate Sushi Koma twice both times experience very pleasant  great small sushi restaurant AYCE  <EOR> Excellent   little uptight soy paper when ordered received hand roll soy paper   did tell additional charge   When ordered next told charge said just put seaweed charge first one   I didn't care $1 willing pay   felt badly waitress somewhat new thought since she hadn't told fee shouldn't pay   $1 wasn't concerned   just wasn't happy attitude sushi guy when already said worry charge if needed charge   I still give them 5 stars because A food really excellent   And B restaurant owner know sometimes employee's employee's don't mean come off way come off <EOR> Friendly Staff great food! little small but prices portions great!

When nigiri came rice awful  would describe cold texture week old rice left fridge  Every frickin bite just extremely annoying  No matter friendly service fresh fish never stand sushi bar bad rice  probably off night since eaten before  But man something rice should kept consistent any respectable Asian restaurant  <EOR> One favorite sushi places! husband boyfriend time would car meets sushi koma having its grand opening  owner offered free food didn't pick though  whatever number determined which dish you'd get  first time tried Vegas roll  Super delicious  only down side restaurant size  tiny when gets busy gets way crowded also offer happy hour just ayce  favorite rolls tiger roll mountain roll  Just enough sauce full great flavor  Fish fresh too! servers super friendly  usually also don't getting sushi because feel just doesnt taste same I know weird BUT sushi koma different  just ordered couple rolls egg rolls edamame loved it! <EOR> Fantastic sushi! favorite AYCE sushi place Las Vegas Henderson area far  waitress super attentive bringing all kinds stuff try  Here's tip order half rolls room sample greater variety off menu  nigiri sushi splendid fantastic fish rice ratio  only negative minor nigiri pieces served garlic topping which didn't realize until late  if aren't fan garlic ordering off Nigiri section sure tell them no garlic  other hand when mentioned didn't cucumber rolls waitress made sure always substituted avocado  Fantastic quality service! FYI around 4 6pm Friday night busy but small eating area during busier times could potentially harder seat  <EOR> I guess didn't memo but once realized Sushi Koma play Sushi Coma completely enamored genius name  Sometimes when eat still can't believe dumb realize it    In any case Sushi Koma solid AYCE sushi option Westside  Parking plentiful but seating not  bit cramped close other tables  table 8 maneuver lot seats larger parties I'd recommend Oyshi instead  thing appreciate Sushi Koma over other AYCE places yet mess order food does come fairly quickly  never worried if forgot put order in  just tried hand rolls first time last week definitely fan  sushi would say bit lesser quality freshness Sushi House Goyemon but still solid  think inflate prices non AYCE always better just ahead AYCE  wish few more interesting dessert options ice cream mochi but end always stuffed eat big dessert anyway  husband fan Big B roll baked sushi roll topped beef while favorite baked roll Volcano roll  <EOR> GREAT SERVICE EXCELLENT SUSHI ALL YOU Can eat CLEAN FUN!!

<EOR> I think far best ayce sushi spots town  seriously size nigiri rolls perfect no awkward mouth stuffing everything tastes amazingly good! feel fish very fresh because when eat salmon yellowtail other places sometimes icky taste but nope Koma  usually don't order rolls when ayce but place really some awesome rolls fish paradise  only reason giving them 4 stars because don't oysters huge selection appetizers desserts but  okay bc still back when some bomb sushi  Also pretty small place wary wait times  <EOR> Ate recent trip Vegas great off strip spot AYCE sushi! sushi well made decent price AYCE  only reason don't 5 star rating service slightly sub par  only 1 waitress while place packed  wait bit long orders even place another order but price quality still worth trek off strip  <EOR> Server Andrew supercool plus he OG checkered vans  default place deserves high rating unparalleled taste sushi game  <EOR> So place handful times  Needless say NEVER going back again  only 4 start off  Right when ordered 4 rolls immediately  1 full roll all others half roll  friends put orders well  20 minutes all friends received orders except me  finally baked roll politely asked going on  Well switched servers some reason but first girl completely failed tell next girl ordered  Speeding hour later still received HALF rolls when everyone else's orders pretty much complete except other person  FINALLY  another full roll   that supposed half  asked girl going yet again telling ordered 3 half rolls  time told 3 times beginning order was   Then when finally other 2 half rolls she rudely asked if done ordering preceded tell still waiting 3rd  never put in  bill 30 minutes into bill just paid left  Let tell am always tip but definitely did here  Oh did even mention huge group behind ALL food sat before them  WORST SERVICE ENTIRE WORLD  SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS ANY LONGER  <EOR> This go to sushi place  Since open late try during later hour when won't busy  small place could quickly wait  always AYCE all eat always worth it    This place best appetizers selections AYCE place  am very picky seaweed salad but always delicious  baked green mussels aren't favorite since prefer little more dressing but still delicious  hesitant try seafood tostada but am glad did  definitely favorite appetizers along tuna carpaccio  nigiri selection always good sometimes better  White tuna scallops favorite  don't tend lot sushi rolls but tiger roll ninja roll ones usually both great    I am really picky customer service tend criticize other servers unfairly  several times where attention server because part order forgotten  usually good refills  usually take unusually long time dropping check processing payment    There always room improvement but obviously place enough give four stars attend frequently  <EOR> I came pretty large party 9 people   place REALLY small wouldn't recommend large parties coming but came relatively late able manage table reasonable amount time  very accommodating service great throughout dinner gave major props   They pretty wide selection AYCE which think came $26 person  mostly nigiri almost everything  especially liked proportions rice fish  There's much more fish very little rice BUT started noticing ordered more start packing rice little more  horribly more but significant enough know wanted fill haha  But even then quality fish pretty good especially AYCE  Everything looked tasted fresh  Even Uni which usually little iffy trying AYCE place because typically AYCE sushi joints old good quality Uni but uni pretty good  best but good enough buttery taste crave GOOD piece uni  rolls good also but they're just any other rolls   They couple signature dishes  them watermelon roll which small plate little sushi rolls but instead having rice seaweed look wrapped thin slices cucumbers assortment some fish inside  gave really crisp light texture which very refreshing  I'd definitely recommend that  couple other signature dishes I can't remember were   remember pretty good but didn't stand much watermelon roll   I'd come back preferably smaller group don't wait long come late cause they're open until 3AM! some good happy hour deals some good hot sake! <EOR> I've going Sushi Koma since 2015 only favorite sushi place  love fresh fish could eat hours then only thing miss old servers smaller restaurant  servers now kind slow few lost orders but its pretty minimal going stop going  <EOR> My fiance looking new sushi lunch spot   Yelp look something between two decided try Sushi Koma   glad did   staff awesome food fabulous affordable all eat   bf didn't want share review raving place because he wants all ourselves   Enjoy      <EOR> I've eaten several All Eat sushi places  bottom list  sushi low end quality side  cooked items weren't anything rave either  brie grape quesadilla strange see menu  tried LAME    PROS Cool inside interior             Super cool employees  CONS Quality <EOR> Went concert 12 12 30 night?  friends stays open 3am!!   definite points book   Its small place but man food freaking amazing!!  Stayed nearly til closing everyone super friendly too!!  DEFINTELY coming back <EOR> I Sushi Koma many many times over last several years since Brian's Beach Sushi Freak but only recently joined Yelp  first things tell everyone great place is  other hand if many people find Sushi Koma might crowded hard time getting table     We love sushi house but biggest complaint every other restaurant always long wait  Seriously anywhere else wait round sushi greeting check long could take 15 minute nap longer  But somehow Sushi Koma only restaurant planet figured your custom order super fast  Everyone works together take your order s bring your drinks food check change all while keeping your table maintained clutter free possible   Sushi Koma offers AYCE all you can eat option $26 per person dinner can't wrong  sushi quality outstanding par other establishments don't offer AYCE bills might three times higher  I guess last sentence obvious pack away lot sushi! If want sushi kind appetizer sashimi roll and or tuna carpaccio  If want something non sushi recommend gyoza ask pan fried  All more included AYCE menu plus deserts  I green tea flavored mochi ice cream desert  small good when already stuffed really nice way end meal  The biggest negative such tiny little place gets crowded fast  When try early avoid wait 5 30 seems work pretty well  But fast friendly service terrific food AYCE prices worth wait if to!  Finding it Sushi Koma located shopping center southwest corner Flamingo Durango  Enter parking lot Flamingo side  <EOR> Definitely yummy sushi appetizers  huge Yama fans but definitely back here!   Try seared tuna carpaccio sashimi roll seafood tostada anything wasabi yuzu sauce! <EOR> Great food  All eat $26 00  Cool little spot  Staff very attentive  Definitely coming back try more stuff menu  <EOR> Awesome sushi new go to spot sushi fix  girlfriend used sushi mon but trying place experiencing freshness fish combined amazing service    completely forgot sushi mon  owner super nice everybody smile encourages try different things  only sure cater exactly want  If mention don't green onions top your sushi then that'll last time ever see top     No need remind them several sushi places to  really care customers  big deal me  side note owner said might change name something other sushi freak soon    Also bit small but care less bc sushi service A+++++++ haha  <EOR> Open until 3AM good sushi don't always together   This place pulls off  Nice small intimate location good large parties but  ok     Will definitely fo AYCE next trip since you'll pay same amount couple rolls drink   If love sushi should bookmark place right now asap  <EOR> My friend brother love place told eat here  cute little hipster vibe which different  all eat menu  $21 lunch $25 dinner    tried Tuna Carpaccio pot stickers dynamite  those delicious!

Most AYCE sushi joints fill sushi rice but one  few places where actually taste sushi rather just fill it    There few things AYCE menu only once THEM  dynamite roll sashimi roll tiny but refreshingly tasteful seafood tostada  general place serves smaller portions but appreciate because quality food back  Everything very fresh many flavors actually taste  Also much nigiri can it's amazingly fresh!   The green tea mochi tasted boxed mochi which fine except super old  mostly tasted carbonation sugar    Also service isn't great  waiter pretty much looked he hated everything  Which fine because being service positions suck but please don't show your workplace  still tipped well because he looked he could use pick up  place must! <EOR> Went first time last night great experience  food amazing  Sushi fresh flavorful AYCE deal totally worth it  many sushi places Las Vegas overpriced quality even great  glad found hidden gem  new place when comes sushi <EOR> This place would gotten 5 stars but service isnt best  boyfriend almost 20 times last few years  quality fish great owner such nice guy  When hes sushi amazing  only problem space small staff really just running around whole time  Its hard drinks appetizers  all eat place which great totally worth it  seafood tostada which bunch fish tomatoes onion jalapeno crispy tortilla thing  Its great  Its busy weekends wait long but really great sushi  <EOR> I've eaten sushi many different places but place hands down best far! eat couple times month lunch hubby  food service always amazing aren't bunch restrictions menu! tuna capraccio best tasting food think ever consumed ever  tiger elephant rolls fave love anything eel avocado cream cheese lol  place isn't big but its nicely appointed comfortable  <EOR> This place great! love food here  The service great too!

Great place <EOR> We late night but include 6team there  sushi fresh good quality rolls  clean but loud  good adult but kids  <EOR> My friends wanted Goyemon 9pm but wait two hours long  Uhh okay plan B?  I remembered reading Sushi Freak Yelp only few miles away called them up  No wait say? Interesting  When around 9 30 nobody around but employees  Yeah weren't kidding   If indicator good AYCE sushi experience intensity food coma afterward then rank among best  variety quality appetizers pretty ridiculous didn't even try dynamite beef teriyaki  Only managed try four many rolls well  nigiri solid  gotta come back eventually definitely envy people live side town because Goyemon place made forget mostly Goyemon night  short version review ends here    read details felt obligated include We bunch appetizers first appropriate enough  Yeah pretty freaky  app fish mini tostada mixed diced tomatoes sprinkled crunchy garlic slices  Pretty good! those brie grape quesadillas whoa  They're nice cleanser between spicy tangy portions  tuna carpaccio also really delish featured crunchy garlic  sashimi roll didn't seem flavorful though  Oh yeah obviously mussels which actually 5 per order  Loved them  All pretty much order per person but  fine since still wanna room later   Speaking which    nigiri rolls just enjoyable  lame picked lemon slices off salmon nigiri jalapenos off yellowtail bravely tried piece   Oh yeah able garlic tuna cajun albacore latter waitress suggestion which don't think menu  Garlic tuna wasn't best around Vegas but cajun albacore there  some reason super white white tuna really great first time good second time  Maybe just hungry? But then again sweet shrimp heads arrived near very end session still enjoyed those lot   Dessert mochi buddy's green tea ice cream  lot mochi flavors compared other places picked coffee which just awesome  ice cream also good seemed larger portion usually see  shrimp heads nice end nice meal   Overall service pretty good  Waitress seemed bit flustered all night miscounting utensils forgetting state policies front but she did give some nice suggestions order secret menu including tostada  speed nice though  Actually large first order coming fast she offered ask them slow down little  bad all  Also employees' shirts even told freak until 3 am  Yeah think could live attitude  Maybe late night jaunt some time see if live that  maybe lunch instead    lighting tonight seemed little dim me  Would've loved see colors stand more but live guess  <EOR> Be prepared pound pavement extra 100 pounds sushi you'll destroy Sushi Koma!!!  I heard whispers sushi Koma few people town but never really thought much heading few sushi places area pretty decent ala Naka Sushi sometimes once you find good sushi restaurant don't stray far might feel your cheating them new hot sexy thang  just walked past   Arriving Koma some friends arrive   Earlier grab table line door waiting might fun heat   Grabbing few beers start ordered AYCE sampling whole menu always challenge never gets completed  Tuna Carpaccio start off legit highly recommended  blowing through quite few rolls id also recommend Elephant Roll think two orders good   Overall  Service 4 5 Price $$$ Food 4 5 Drink 4 5 Coming Back oh yeah <EOR> I satisfied all eat menu   Great baked sushi options my favorite     The place very nice clean comfy  <EOR> The rolls nigiri pitifully small much dining space  Even table seated tiny only two feet wide barely large enough house drinks single plate each   The tuna carpaccio almost fully cooked covered burnt garlic  amount tuna served smaller pinky finger though supposed $10 dish  biggest eater yet ate easily over $100 worth sushi AYCE still walked hungry   embarrassingly small serving sizes are  <EOR> Hands down best sushi experiences ever had  Sushi really fresh service second none  Definitely worth detour off strip  <EOR> Moved new location in same area just other side parking lot   Much more room now  sushi still great ever  Going 3 4 years now still top AYCE sushi joints  <EOR> I decided meet friend dinner random Thursday night  Being new Vegas pleased find place accessible easy find  nice crowd people but seemed really understaffed  server sweet but such rush every time she came table she ended misunderstanding order   My friend all you can eat special but only ordered roll seaweed salad  portions ridiculously small extremely unimpressed sashimi roll appetizer list  felt rushed order only recommendation when asked possibility any rice less specialty rolls  When ready pay she informed she made mistake order reason portions small because a la carte  She assumed doing AYCE special friend  honest mistake   I guess  music playing best part whole experience   felt wasa eating sushi nightclub!  Overall though probably wouldn't come back again  <EOR> Great sushi even better service  space unique bit small but cramped uncomfortable way  sake tasty some unique rolls appetizers tuna carpaccio  menu broken down helpful way  price could more competitive but great dinner option  <EOR> I'm big all eat sushi however am into great sushi!  reason don't normally all eat sushi best quality fish   place wonderful selection good quality sushi very impressed     The chefs great quick wait staff really nice always filling your drinks seem treat family   owner working behind sushi bar started talking he chefs opened large sushi places strip he followed dream opened own place Sushi Freak     He little twists lot ordered some touch sauce little something special them rolls good half roll break meal   He lot experience designing creating some great dishes favorite night Tuna Carpaccio YUM!

Amazing! busy night but place small three chefs working bar four servers very attentive sweet BUT    totally disorganized    All four servers seemed working table while them would come around every few minutes ask if we'd order something else keep replying unfortunately still waiting items we'd already ordered didn't want order more could eat  seemed no centralization orders while having four attentive very friendly servers awesome having just server made sure orders came correctly timely fashion would better  ask rest order five times non sushi friend waited 45 minutes chicken teriyaki bowl  over two hours while food excellent efficiency accuracy service not   One servers later apologized explained entire second round order given another table mistake  waited half hour no items delivered  AYCE least you're going charged something ordered but didn't receive but still annoying  eventually everything ordered but wouldn't if hadn't kept track ourselves  food wonderful service well intentioned friendly willing give them another try but won't come when hurry if there's someone want impress  want spend meal enjoying food tracking down orders because dining companion hasn't gotten entre    Tuna carpaccio seafood tostada sashimi roll chicken teriyaki apps must! Elephant roll Stephanie rolls great! <EOR> Really love sushi literrally never leave unsatisfied  service ukbeat very cool enviroment mixture music genres cycling through  Only thing seen rolls presented tighter neater  Very good experience makr sure half rolls  put lot rice nori AYCE    Our server Hannah very attentive always smile  Keep good work  <EOR> This probably newest favorite place sushi! didn't know expect but pleasantly surprised! rolls over stuffed rice nigri super fresh  sat front owner he kept food coming steadily  He actually making things husband mackerel super white tuna which both items he generally doesn't but liked Sushi Freak! love he added sea salt lemon octopus he did same scallops!   Service awesome! 3 ladies working very attentive sushi chefs  definitely back great assortment rolls pregnant lady eat doesn't tuna raw fish! Definitely place AYCE great sushi! <EOR> First off AYCE joint  Lunch $22 Dinner $26  open until 3am!  Onto food! place some interesting menu items sure  Brie grape quesadilla? Where did even come from? Still can't knock because did try it  When sit down they'll bring some deliciously salted hot edamame which perfect nom before storm AYCE   Their nigiri list includes all usual suspects some off menu items such garlic tuna Cajun albacore  stars menu Ahi Tuna Carpaccio which really tataki carpaccio all  lovely sear topped green onion garlic chips ponzu yum yum sauce  I'd recommend skipping yum yum sauce  Highlights nigiri Ono hamachi hotate Cajun albacore maguro  Skip tamago isn't made house  tako also worth ordering super tough   Unfortunately place seems hit miss  twice same week first time unbelievably  good fresh! Upon eating ono super white tuna realized watery all other fish eating is! second time around total miss only ate four orders nigiri which record low me  if hopefully good night because when good a maz ing  Best quality fish Las Vegas AYCE   Another noteworthy aspect restaurant little touches add each order nigiri  Serrano chile hamachi lemon slices salmon  good thing bad thing  Every now then garnish compliment fish welcome but when every order garnished becomes much I'd rather focus fish   Other hot menu items gyoza I'd skip only decent  shrimp tempura smaller usual shrimp slightly heavy greasy batter  spicy tuna hand roll avocado ! spicy tuna distinct Korean funk it heavily seasoned redolent gochujang   Oh if rolls large selection conveniently separated into fried baked shrimp tempura etc  sections ease finding want  <EOR> After reading reviews Yelp thought would give AYCE try 8 friends  extremely disappointed  all ordered first thing ordered spicy tuna cut roll  Once friends started receive orders complicated speciality rolls expecting order but no where seen  very patient decided ask waitress since thought mine would following soon    10 minutes friends received rolls started order another round  then asked waitress Spicy Tuna hand cut roll I can't response received already ordered coming  want order another before your first!? First all don't need attitude  just asking why haven't received item ordered past 20 minutes! Once everyone else starts receiving second round  I finally order!    The rest party finishing eating didn't want order any more sushi instead ordered Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream  would think should only take couple minutes   NOPE! Sushi Koma! 10 minutes passed bring bill still   no Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream  asked waitress another smart response already put order other waitress coming  point furious didn't say anything because didn't know horrible words would come mouth    looked bill since large party automatic gratuity added there  No wonder waitress didn't care she getting nice tip no matter what  party started leave table guess bring out    yup guessed it! Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream  took bite since already leaving    leaving waitress finally asked everything? said Absolutely terrible  only two items delivered during 'AYCE' dinner every time asked orders gave attitude  She then tried touch shoulder attempted apologize since manager watching  just walked away    When eat wasn't even crowded! 3 people bar only 1 other table 4 people it!! NEVER EVER come again! terrible service  Maybe can't handle stress serving big party  also multiple waitresses!! Regardless don't need attitude dinner  waitress served without attitude would different experience   This experience reasons why created Yelp account  share horrific dining experience  EAT HERE  <EOR> Love place! become number 1 sushi restaurants!

Ask sushi tostada!  menu but amazing! favorite Kimmy roll husband's almost hot roll  We think name <EOR> Generally avoid AYCE places especially sushi but gave try local friends   Overall staff very friendly attentive orders arrived quickly   Reasonably wide selection menu   Avoid anything yum yum sauce which seemed hot melted mayonnaise  Some appetizer dishes OK seafood tostada spicy edamame but bit salty side bit much fried garlic   Best approach mainly order nigiri sushi which modest amount rice per piece rather mostly rice instead fish   bit concern hamachi totally different looking second order which brings question whether other same fish  <EOR> Glad try place  sushi fresh plentiful  recommend Super White Tuna!   The rice bit mushy but still good flavor   Sushi aside real treat appetizers! think only each AYCE price but some sort poki tower served fried crisp absolutely outstanding! cuts sashimi tossed citrus soy sauce sitting top fried crisp  Then topped green onions fried garlic slices  garlic slices sent dish over top!  The sashimi roll very good too!  Service great! Strike conversation chefs  very friendly!

First last time ever dine here  Service terribly slow unresponsive  ordered miso soup 3 times until finally it  probably waiting 20 30 min between each order which half them actually delivered  fish fresh tasted came straight freezer thawed out  selection boring simple  only good thing place fish rice ratio    Definitely would drive extra miles down spring mountain better ayce sushi  <EOR> I've couple times last night disappointing me  When girlfriend arrived greeted server I don't remember name she nice enough except told needed minute look menu AYCE she disappeared another guy working noticed asked if being helped said but did know where server she gone some time even asked girlfriend sure wasn't over reacting she agreed   He took orders few moments later original server made reappearance ask if ready order informed already did someone else  little while food starting being delivered but also ordered bottle sake which never delivered until asked 2nd time  point girlfriend eating chef kept handing orders directly he being somewhat rude saying annoyed tone hello??   EATING!! imagine annoying middle eating some guy giving attitude cause your grabbing your food fast enough him??Me girlfriend sitting bar area front chefs know rite but doesn't mean should serving myself if sat bar P T's wouldn't expect pour your own beer your own shots   If girlfriend wasn't probably would said some choice words service rite then but didn't want scene kept mouth shut  point bit annoyed but wanted good night tried let then chef attitude starts handing stuff didn't even order! dude expect run table?? Sushi great but service lacking think going another Sushi place now on  <EOR> Such great deal service amazing! Definitely try much menu possible because all taste good  even order half rolls try more variety  Delicious  would recommend place anyone! <EOR> A solid 4 star experience  vast majority nigiri fresh quite good but salmon came slightly towards room temp definitely should've colder  before best sushi ever but if large appetite want save couple dollars definitely recommend dining here   One things appreciate Sushi Koma fast service especially compared most Japanese restaurants  some places town you'd need sundial time waitress  Koma servers right point delivered everything quickness!  We'll definitely returning  <EOR> Too bad!  used love place  But since last time quality changed completely  variety nigiri sushi couple rolls  rice all wrong  cold refrigerated  fish wasn't fresh all  Some them spit out  only reason gave two stars friendly service  <EOR> By far best sushi place Las Vegas! $25 AYCE! best menus  Best thing menu seared tuna carpaccio sashimi roll  Yummmm! <EOR> Wow  place real treat  reading all reviews boy disappointed     I BACK   Came back following week did impossible  even better next time   Friendly staff great food   Unlike most AYCE sushi places extra mile * touch wasabi maki * lemon sea salt ika  All plates made paying each roll   dissapointed <EOR> Met tonight friends amazed beyond expectations   cozy but reasons loved it  service fantastic! don't just server everyone sure taken care of  try seared tuna carpaccio!

However atmosphere  place definitely younger crowd  Think teenage 30s  waitresses dress pretty revealing clothing short shorts tied shirts  music loud random but dug it  1 5 stars decor     SERVICE service pretty good  group lot Sushi ordered we all buffet   surprising some order came different time slots believe order might forgotten  But reasonable large order sushi think six items must hard keep track  understandable   5 stars service    FOOD sushi appetizers delicious! appetizers tried Gyoza Brie Grape Quesadilla  Both absolutely delicious! Note though Brie Grape Quesadilla should probably afterthought dessert  very sweet didn't exactly compliment food  far Sushi rolls tried D A  Roll Double D Roll Kimmy Roll more  all delicious fresh! Great sushi here! adventurous try some cool stuff! 2 stars food!   FINAL VERDICT Taco Bell better? Nah   Sushi great if you're mood treat yourself! If under 30 person definitely here  hip fun delicious  won't hole your wallet buffet $25 95  bad considering Sushi add quickly expensive anyway  way try lot worry spending much! Note if over 30 saying just place draws young crowd loud music  if down though sure try place! amazing! Now when Taco Bell buffet    <EOR> Like another poster said best thing menu Seared Tuna Carpaccio  only per person AYCE but heavenly delicious!   We several yummy rolls its best AYCE place Vegas  give 4 stars only because time salmon perfectly liking bit slimy every time just little some thing bit off  Last year service bit slow  service time quick friendly    If you're area looking good sushi AYCE visit place  won't disappointed! <EOR> The food atmosphere service omg am impressed  Amazing sashimi  Christina took excellent care table  She refilled glasses any time getting empty without being asked very kind  Absolutely recommend <EOR> I'm huge fan AYCE sushi  Eating point feeling being over stuffed just doesn't appeal but tonight caved  stomach craving everything place Sushi Koma can't easily narrow down your selection especially if you're party 1  Best part allow half rolls if tossed between few choices just choose them all half style!   For ones knew place awhile back small cozy little spot which probably held 30 people tops  Although new spot still within same shopping complex great trendy lot larger!

Staff 5 stars  I really staff here  Because small place staff really take care you  focus attention helping when ask suggestions actual opinions  won't always tell most expensive item just tastiest them  staff cares customer well being proud food serve mark great restaurant    Conclusion  I've held tongue almost year now write review because afraid share place world  Gollum Lord Rings wanted horde keep precious myself  But Sushi Koma just great place share  Whether love sushi just getting into Sushi Koma must when visiting Las Vegas  prepared your mind blown fall into food koma dining here  <EOR> I think found new favorite sushi place! came last night thoroughly pleased  place teeny tiny but oh cute decoration wise  little bit wait appetizer rolls coming but understandable all 6pm Friday night veryyyy busy rather large party well  But when food finally came totally worth wait  Brie grape quesadilla yummy Kimmi Alex rolls freaking delicious  only regret didn't more room try more rolls  <EOR> I came sushi craving since place recommended close house decided stop in  wait 10 mins 3 sat tiny table squeezed random spot however within minutes moved large table b plenty room    The service FANTASTIC hostess super sweet waitress very friendly funny  Didn't mind all picky eater even made helpf suggestions    The 4 5 stars because although food good wasn't great fish fresh however little dull    I would recommend friend might even back especially since they're open till 3am  <EOR> Decided try place because usual place closed Independence Day  first impression Koma very small cute armed drawn on glass board two TVs  two attentive friendly waitresses happy answer any questions explain which items most popular  sushi chefs fairly welcoming well   We sat bar AYCE course  wasn't surprised nigiri decorated garnishes sauces because done prior research Yelp  expected still prefer nigiri without any other flavors aside soy sauce wasabi  yellowtail came jalapeno slices which frankly doesn't even opinion  However sauce white tuna actually complemented its natural flavor left on  salmon came lemon slices which welcome but overloaded   As per waitress' suggestion tried carpaccio some other appetizers which alright  better worse  mochi ice cream old frostbite because fell apart no elasticity remaining   Honestly highlight meal probably super salted edamame served beginning  love sea salt edamame firm tasty  <EOR> I came before love food but unfortunately visit wasn't best  BF arrived around 12 seated immediately  party 3 party 2 came right after  understand only server but don't understand why she brought water drink orders people came when already sitting waiting 10mins  ended leaving because that  <EOR> I don't know guys survive eat whale everytime visit more exclusive items limited order per person but if group no problemo  very picky uni unfortunately offering didn't pass smell taste test but other then everything else great! Highly recommend  <EOR> Great food poor service  Timing receive things slightly off  ask soy sauce 3 times  Waited iced tea 20 minutes then said didn't any  If just more organized place could really take off! <EOR> I should taken picture all delicious food but hungry    Next time   1  felt welcome comfortable moment walked door    2  love drinking glasses huge  known drink lot water didn't even need refill    3  waitress very attentive  guest met new management well  chefs very cheery worked magic quickly   4  food perfect decor smell fresh ESPN playing flat screen    Basically all senses delighted   I would rather drive further better service food back any other sushi spot used to  new fave! <EOR> I lot sushi places lately stood all rest  pure quality stands most  Rice always sticky soft plentiful  fish fresh colorful  servers friendly courteous always attentive  Best AYCE place recent memory! <EOR> Excellent service lot fun  last Wednesday lunch time daughter's birthday AYCE  liked everything exception green mussels  dessert brought daughters birthday massive complementary even though busy bit under staffed still made great attempt sing Happy Birthday !! back  <EOR> Greatness!

A handy tip folks want try everything if AYCE order half rolls! <EOR> Don't know happened food ordered didn't show zero service lunch couldn't leave because waitress nowhere found check   Probably won't again ever  <EOR> I'm fan AYCE sushi  Why ask? love sushi but can't eat lot even if wanted to  Usually order 2 rolls gets pretty full  Anyway said before say again  favorite sushi restaurant Sen Japan  Haven't found anything better  However Sushi Koma  If AYCE wouldn't mind coming here    Service usually pretty good  Other time Christmas Day servers friendly attentive  never seen guys working sushi bar talking customers but knows if even speak English very well  would explain why always order through server directly them? Even when sitting right front them? Christmas Day horrible  crowded service pretty slow although did look enough staff working  Maybe just used full house? forgot order because everyone else getting sushi except us  Even those seated us  think waited over 30 minutes first round sushi  While patiently waiting servers noticed asked if already ordered  told yes long time ago  She kitchen let someone know  Finally food while later    As mentioned rarely eat more 2 rolls unless didn't eat all day but everything tried far good  favorite SC7 roll shrimp cream cheese avocado spicy crab top  gyoza also tasty didn't seem frozen kind  ordered take well must say pack everything very nicely those to go containers!  Overall bad AYCE sushi prices reasonable  Located next AABS Dental  <EOR> As eat more more sushi eating rolls less nigiri more  sushi fantastic  Great fish cut perfectly amazing rice   all it  Simple things executed well  Very rare see high level attention nigiri AYCE joint  <EOR> Excellent sushi! food delicious  Everything ordered great   service great truly catered big group  <EOR> Our favorite server Janet!
