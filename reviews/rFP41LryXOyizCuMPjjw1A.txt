There breakfast sub complete waste money  bread wasnt even toasted somehow soggy  Would come again  <EOR> Apparently announcement backed subs would take 20 minutes make  So people airport actually time crunch is  say you're backed lunch hour 1 30p many people waiting subs made good service  If can't handle rush busy airport then need try another venue  Sorry Port Subs management but Nathalie T pretty much discouraged anyone line buying your subs thanks obnoxious announcements would take least 20 minutes sub  Really? good business  put more people staff know they're doing move strip mall  copacetic airport restaurant especially Las Vegas Mccarran Int'l airport  <EOR> Ordered turkey Sub today lettuce tomato   No tomato but some food poisoning   throwing plane Vegas Philly   Pretty brutal flight   Avoid place  <EOR> I'm stunned horrifically negative reviews thus far   expect airport food options?  Under $5 footlong combo value meals?  Yeah right   Try buying your food hours before your flight maybe your local gas station way airport then MAYBE your reviews more sense   mean seriously never traveled before???  Anyway Port Subs   probably best option available terminal though tastes may vary   nice offer variety fresh sandwiches salads   when say fresh mean slice meats order Jersey Mike's pull them pre sliced cauldron questionable sanitation   Speaking which place sparkling clean too   The service fast staff friendly enough didn't way but wasn't rude    liked Mrs  Fields same kiosk too    yum    cookies   Overall best option found airport price expected   KNOW they're going jack airport    don't look normal prices here   Still worth value   very full filling sub fresh ingredients fast service   Can't ask more! <EOR> I just want let port subs all fine readers yelp know weeped airplane  shed sweet tears flight  Because port subs put MAYONNAISE sandwich    Why would that? asked if wanted mayo mustard only did say mustard but BEGGED put mayonnaise it  cashier joked awful mayo shared distaste it  Why would it? Why would stab back that?   I flight  Open sub  didn't even some mayo dabblings baby fully drenched  payed $4 something ridiculous terrible cup noodles threw away entirety useless $8 sub cried all way home    Port Subs cruel joke  <EOR> Ordered #8 Turkey Provolone Provolone already?  just opened   Service great bread dry   would hope all would stocked someone didn't job inventory baking department  <EOR> Good sandwich airport  tuna sub all vegetables  made fresh  <EOR> When attempt chicken burrito 8 45am 360 Burritos failed   i happened upon Port Subs   Ah hem   a sub place offers smoked cheddar?  Sign up   6 inch smoked ham turkey ad smoked cheddar banana peppers onions lettuce mayo   all day long   Pretty good stuff   Better Subway IMHO  <EOR> It airport wife ate 22 dollars   First 2 sandwiches airport usually pay more price point low end airport pricing  My hot pastrami best ever had   hot could whatever wanted does job  For fools complain quality price combination two remember Las Vegas where your hamburger joints strip hit 40 dollars 2 place isn't bad deal  <EOR> For sub spot airport place surpassed expectations  ordered turkey provolone sub combo pretty basic per usual myself when comes down sandwiches wished ordered two because good  bread best thing it  requested wheat bread fresh soft don't care if came oven bread bag day great made whole sandwich spectacular without having mention anything else! But mention meat cheese also fresh packed together between perfect bread very excited chosen Port Subs quick lunch spot whilst hungover Las Vegas airport  mentioned awesome bread was?! <EOR> My wrap good  Turkey Provolone  hit spot  <EOR> After realizing arrived airport departing flight way early next thing realized famished  choices food airport paltry come but hard mess sub sandwich cast off anchor set course Port Subs  Sorry couldn't help myself  I ordered large Italian all fixings except onion   far sandwiches pretty good especially bread  service very friendly  realize am operating sliding scale due airport location but think four stars accurate when compared other options  <EOR> If want over priced mediocre cold tiny sandwich place you!  For just $13 dollars 4 sandwich bag chips fountain drink  nothing wrong sandwich other its size price  Then again much better virtually any other place terminal same price a few bucks more table service  lot going Subway just smaller sandwich higher price   I wouldn't come again  honest would probably better off going Burger King right next it  <EOR> A perfectly decent choice given many other choices nearby fast food unappealing sit down joints   When comes sandwich places usually meatiest option menu classic sub #1 ham salami capicola pepperoni provolone didn't disappoint  served pretty fast wasn't terribly expensive seeing airport venue    A fast inexpensive filing meal place job done just way wanted it  <EOR> Seemed good eye  Asked specific sandwich he said oh that  Turns not  Gave GF crap until walked back up  Settled tuna sandwich   Hot pastrami horribly salty   price  think bad even airport  14 00 bucks crap sandwich drink   Good luck  <EOR> Glad something other greasy fast food terminal    Pros NO LINE!! sub good fairly quick service raspberry iced tea! staff polite unlike Burger King Cons expensive small sub VERY small  3 inches hard order your sub toppings because glass    keep saying excuse <EOR> Barely passable  $10 70 sandwich turkey provolone   it  No lettuce no onion no pickle no side nothing  Fresh ingredients just very meh  No deli mustard available  <EOR> Decided order own version old school Subway esque Spicy Italian  Salami pepperoni lettuce tomato banana peppers pickles olives olive oil vinegar oregano  Grabbed bag chips water    Like all airport spots price ridiculous but let just say sub point!! Better most sub joints appreciated sliced deli meats right front ordered    The 3 people working all super friendly personable!   Definitely better expected happy good hoagie! <EOR> Conveniently located B gate POS being ignored Great Steak next door  ham cheese sandwich actually pretty good especially combination yogurt cookie sandwich shop  Nearly ten bucks nine inch but guess expected airport  <EOR> I gave 2 stars because vegan sub actually tasted pretty good but $11 36??!! Total rip off price wise  avocado added took price 8 sub crazy level? Maybe fact passed artery clogging '3 cheeses' might offset but no such luck  First time last time  <EOR> This secent sub shop located airport  queued ordered Italian Sub lettuce tomato olives banana peppers oil vinegar  pretty good but same quality subway  Im always hoping awesome sandwich shops but nothing beats NYC Deli  <EOR> We morning flight home Vegas needed some nourishment prior voyage  Port Subs offered Egg Cheese sandwiches figured we'd give try   ordered 2 Egg Cheese sandwiches $4 99 each bottle water $3 49   know airports love price gauge but bit ridiculous   When food ready grabbed headed table   Upon unwrapping sandwiches discovered size palm hand   hands smaller side   sandwiches microwaved freshly made   asked employees ketchup dismay amazement she told don't ketchup! does sandwich shop most common requested condiment? bit disbelief    I sat back down ate ketchup less sandwich  alright good flavor but longing ketchup fix  would given 3 stars if served ketchup  <EOR> No no no no no   We ordered 3 egg cheese breakfast sandwiches around $20 !    tiny microwaved soggy   hard believe professional sandwich establishment sandwiches way   Ever hear toaster oven? <EOR> For airport food place bad   Stuff seemed fresh though did give green middle tomato top a pet peeve mine  I'd probably use them again if sitting McCarran  <EOR> This sandwich much better anything could served flight    and $9 didn't think bad deal   line long but moved quickly staff friendly efficient! wasn't best sandwich ever but may best sandwiches airport  <EOR> In land $ 99 buffet would expect more bun lettuce stale bag chips $15 00    Even airport pricing would expect more   If any regular locations stingy location airport going again  <EOR> $15 dollars 4 turkey provolone water small bag sun chips! Lesson learned   Bring your own food airport  <EOR> I absolutely ecstatic finding Port Subs location Terminal B airport  Terminal D well but accessible Terminal B thought luck until beacon light came into view   The menu limited normal faire but expected airport location  main thing SMOKEY CHEDDAR CHEESE which literally best cheese ever invented why no other sandwich shops never know  But Vegetarian sandwich taste more meaty because smokiness which amazing  lovely   The sandwiches come small large sizes small 4 large 8 obviously bigger sandwich  Vegetarian Sandwich wheat roll smokey cheddar lettuce olives mayo mustard oil vinegar spices  Yummy! Prices little more expensive but  also expected airport location   Employees friendly food came fast  slightly disappointed didn't avocado but don't think avocados readily available Nevada California  would definitely come back again when Las Vegas  <EOR> Sandwiches plain  weren't warm crispy but hey airport food  mango smoothie just sugary real mango However lady helped very nice accommodating wanted each half sandwich  quick line short but sandwich worth its price then again airport food = Probably won't back  <EOR> Standard sub fresh veggies fantastic smile girl making sandwich  I probably would gone 4 stars but still smiling treated sandwich girl  kind service all restaurants should have  Thanks making day  <EOR> Worst port subs   Corporate should close location because does live standard   Prices expensive but expected airport food   chaps ass bro working counter repeatedly asks ordered even though very clear concise   Next sandwich tasted cardboard   bread left days   meat cheese good quality but attendant drenched sandwich oil vinegar   All all sandwich bust coupled poor customer service mark down place avoid  <EOR> This Port Subs located right next Gate McCarran Airport  running empty stomachs wouldn't eating another 2 hours Port Subs breakfast is! bakery items sold Mrs  Fields opted two chocolate croissants $3 89 ea    tasted artificial couldn't scarf down last two bites croissant  asked cup water basically told only option available bottled water $3 49   Encore beach Club?? bottle coke $3 19 world water more expensive soda? Criminy! All all paltry meal set back $15 63  There's no seating available just few high top mini tables stand around  Should've ate Burger King instead   YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015 #197 <EOR> Not bad airport food   bread really very fresh even though late evening meat ok sandwich meat   Smoked Ham Turkey Smokey Cheddar Cheese   cheddar nice flavorful   sandwich made before even finished paying women made sandwich actually smiled said nice day! something hear much coming NY! <EOR> Nothing good place  put stale veggies ur sandwiches taste also pretty bad  felt queasy eating here! <EOR> They charged $10 large sub then gave woman before exact same size even though she ordered small  jerks it  few minutes later heard another couple complaining same thing  2 feet away Starbucks sandwich  better they're nicer  <EOR> On way  Las Vegas stopped airport location ordered Italian sub delicious meaty  disappointed wish Chicago Thanks <EOR> This sub shop doesn't tap water  know airport but serve soda without water connection?  assume food high quality too  never know  Life's short encourage predatory businesses taking advantage people stuck behind security pretty low  <EOR> I starving waiting late flight spirit airlines urg stopped port subs price a little steep tiny sandwich had  taste well just generic nothing special sandwich could home would taste identical  really many options when comes want your sandwich  All all only thing say a  Average sandwich <EOR> I bacon egg cheese sandwich morning here  greasy ya microwaved but what's terminal?
