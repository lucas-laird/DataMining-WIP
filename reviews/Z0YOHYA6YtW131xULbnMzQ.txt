Whatever food experience just wasn't good one  Plus waited least 30 minutes line before even seated    But hey if CHOOSE just stick ox tail soup family loved it! <EOR> First time staying California Hotel for family reunion sorts   Ate plate lunch place upstairs before but never Market Street Cafe  Mom told oxtail soup decided would eat some point  gambling till 2 30 am thought would stop by  Place pretty busy even time  Didn't think would able eat much since large buffet dinner earlier   Boy wrong! am Hawaii fair share oxtail soup but pretty damn good! Must order EXTRA ginger cilantro! throw bowl rice comes into soup!  quite bit oxtail inside  Ono till last drop! Now whenever back probably never order anything else long oxtail soup menu 11pm 9am believe ! <EOR> This review solely based graveyard menu past few times gone 11p oxtail soup   We Vegas travelers come every year Midwest  Typically 1 3 times year I'd husband's must stop place eat every trip   The lines very long don't order either  last time came labor day weekend waited just little over hour seated 3 ppl  feel service hit miss well some ladies aren't nicest ppl  lacked customer service even just friendly smile  Maybe don't care bc know ppl still returning eat there?  Anyways always come oxtail soup which priced $9 99  Really good price amount oxtail give you! They're consistent  everytime gone tasted same  great place eat night drinking  friends even steak dinner $6 99 can't that! even took friends visited Vegas first time loved it! <EOR> Coffee cup soup half sandwich unlimited salad bar two something $23 tax tip  Everything fresh service fine  returning  <EOR> I've loyal fan place over 10 years   What happened your Prime Rib???? awful others party took few bites did eat it  First off disgustingly salty if put spoon full salt mouths  Second all obvious lower grade meat  call slab meat Prime Rib  some nasty slab meat could even cut w knife  All people party agreed  complained waiter then told first people complain night many others complained well  did he do? He took prime rib off bill charged all eat salad bar came prime rib  Whoop di do!! Prime rib $9 99 all eat salad bar just few dollars less  getting your prime rib every year past 10 years obvious same grade meat honestly tasted Ass   I gave stars because ox tail soup reminds outstanding  mahi mahi still outstanding well   A big fat zero no longer having daily specials could use Hawaiian Package coupons where Vacations Hawaii advertises free meals  all gone  Now coupons only used breakfast saimin  Boo!
