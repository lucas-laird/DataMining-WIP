So yup overall mediocre  come back again few weeks see fairs  always say give place three tries before completely throw out  <EOR> The meat good! past few times gone ordered mula which two tortillas top another cheese essentially quesadilla add which ever meat want all dressings want  Really good! <EOR> Found place Yelp search     I would eat every day if lived Vegas   Fast food atmosphere but food fantastic  <EOR> I can't complain   new favorite Mexican food restaurant!  Everything delicious!  Carne Asada chicken al pastor meats delicious   Price add guacamole stupid $2+ shady guacamole    Its thin layer $2 should hefty scoop    Anyways whatever get   its good     I worked tip industry when didn't tip would quick dish sarcastic thank you   cooks same   LOL!     Salsa bar awesome!    They should give some chips Pepes when order in   The owner pleasant eyes  <EOR> Tasty affordable Mexican food gives its competitors run money    You customize most food menu  Begin choosing item want order then choose your meat fillings  Some meat options include  alpastor carne asada lengua cabeza  If don't eat meat no worries  There's soyrizo option  yet try but heard positive things friends did    On visit bowl chose alpastor meaty filling along pinto beans lettuce shredded cheese pico de gallo  Guacamole $1 more but I'd suggest getting side chips guac few bucks because receive generous amount guacamole might enough both chips your entree  Back order thought meat good surprisingly salty  say because most Mexican restaurants Vegas add much salt food  enough  Kick your food notch hitting salsa bar  extra hot habanero sauce good choice made perspire bit   Not only food good but service decent  restaurant CLEAN especially salsa station staff really maintains cleanliness area  <EOR> Was favorite place but gone down much sign door says open 10 didn't open until 11 then inside asked 3 different meats none ready minimum 15 min wait cook  nothing ready before opening never back again <EOR> This far favorite taco spot town! tried over 15 taco joints el gordo tacos Mexico los tacos etc place continuously exceeds rest service organization flavor quality food    Their meats fresh since such busy restaurant turnover quick! don't double tortillas ton meat delicious stuffings per taco well worth $2 25    I only tried carne asada chicken barbacoa  barbacoa puts all beef recipes shame!!!  delicioso!!!!  Their salsa station includes 8 different kinds salsas beans veggies course limes  <EOR> Your average taco place  reason am giving many stars because BEST staff  all nice friendly  Another plus fact give option much extra sauce want no extra charge  All sauces limes salsas even beans bar where whatever want  HUGE plus because LOVE green avocado sauce  only tacos pork  say don't LOVE them tacos el gordo but honestly close  <EOR> Located sketchy strip mall location really easy parking sits taco y taco  yellow sign black VEGETARIAN lettering looking for    Veggie Nachos Veggie Burrito ordered up  amazing due its freshness open kitchen cool  Probably first time ever veggie burrito wasn't sitting pool liquid  mushrooms almost meaty really flavorful  Literally everything tasty fresh  think could eat every day  <EOR> Where all taco life?

There's yummy affordable food everywhere! <EOR> Kept hearing try place!  Many kept comparing another taco place very popular  Vegas   Yes yes Tacos el Fatty !  Where start ? walked never busy comparison  staff busy talking each other instead helping few customers did have   almost left but another customer walked over asked if first time  Probably confused look Said yes he explained all works   Your typical taco place where order want where want it    Tortillas smelled good taste home made   tacos good but nothing world   would compare hold own but  admit way prepared very untraditional !  seen local traditional  taquero prepare taco passion ensures delicious  more Taco Bell style where know need add because somebody told them should    Making good tacos art    Believe not!   tacos de Asada good admit better tacos el fatty   However then come al pastor !! stand Tacos El gordo best al pastor  meat seasoning green sauce taco Amazing Taco y Taco good pineapple top adds flavor  but meat little cold lacked flavor compared others    closing if hungry want tacos Al pastor can't wait don't feel driving then yes your place   However if want great tacos al pastor would place    Also place clean could been   opinion  amount employees present floors should spotless fountain drink area should clean salsa bar should kept   Oh all bad    corn Cobb all fixing amazing would back just that!! <EOR> Great food workers  very polite always sure satisfied  Food may messy but satisfies stomach  Carlos helped made sure able sample before purchasing  employees seem really great always helpful  <EOR> I honestly say hands down best chicken taco outside Mexico  set when walk into place little confusing but holy shit worth it!!!! 2$ some change most packed meat taco fresh made corn tortilla  lady literally pressing cooking fresh off grill tortillas all people line  huge difference taste compared pre made shitty corn tortillas  regular taco which just your choice meat salsa onions cilantro  Simple yet delicious!! Personally them more simple street taco style If want beans guac sour cream all other shit should probably just burrito  If little more flavor also offer salsa bar large variety salsas add  Another perk place street corn elotes  lot taco spots town offer it  best but pretty good  best back van parking Lott  Sketchy delicious  conclusion If mood some tacos taste came taco shack Mexico your place  If your looking some fancy Tex mex Americanized taco fusion whatever else probably won't happy simple deliciousness place  way try it  probably won't disappointed  <EOR> This place great love vibe  dads taco caterer know good authentic tacos look taste like awesome  recommend place sure! <EOR> A decent option east side town  twice week  chicken carnitas pretty good but show stopper Al Pastor  beautiful marinated meat gets carved order topped all good street Taco ingredients  Friendly helpful staff  music loud flows through place  Sweet new lunch spot! <EOR> I'm Mike Debra one    it started good ended A OK      Yes wide variety things yes its clean spacious condiment bar pretty cool etc  but when arrived Friday night expecting tables packed since many highly rated reviews  empty dining room only other table   We entered through back ladies pretty nice helpful ordered Elote Corn cob her  order system similar Gordo's so its difficult navigating your way down line  While ladies nice no service smile guys kept repeating order lest 3 4 times because music loud hard time remembering ordered  ordered some Nopales Cactus three tacos Al Pastor Tripa Cabeza   We liked corn cactus pretty good beans but tacos okay  Cabeza pretty bland always request Tripa extra crispy but still chewy inside  best three Al Pastor  Good flavor but pretty skimpy meat  Glad tried place though  Its okay But much better option just few blocks here    ALOHA!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013 96 100 New Taco Joint Town <EOR> Had Adobada Tripas Carne Asada!  All superb!  service excellent  Atmosphere's refreshing  Ownership gracious  Definitely need check place out!!! <EOR> It neat experience   ordering process fairly complicated which actually fun! authentic style ordering according someone know lived Mexico  Some lines kind food other lines another kind food on  pay end  view cooking process fascinating fun almost movie viewing one  food itself fine  carnitas taco really good other tacos fine  tortillas little dry but  okay  atmosphere neighborhood families tourists but all feel welcome   really Mexican corrido music playing! <EOR> I love trying new taco places but restaurant literally worst taco restaurant too! First off 9 tacos al pastor carne asada cactus horchata soda  each own preference but place terrible service food  instagram pictures looks NOTHING actual food well  recommend checking real reviews pictures yelp first before going anywhere new  also didn't honor tuesday tacos advertised well  $2 tacos Their lines tacos pretty cool grab tray line workers your tacos front you  But opinion highly dislike because wait 3 4 different lines your order which really takes more time gets confusing  wish simple ordering system order pay  nice good option taco meat vegetarian options well  Cactus Soyrizo workers weren't nicest but weren't bad nothing really complain  When finished ordering came almost $30 9 tacos 2 drinks which isn't really cheap  feel price could've ordered another place more enjoyable experience tacos  But  beauty trying new restaurants  REALLY wanted try taco restaurant because beautiful instagram pictures but honest  probably just other location tropicana because tacos looks NOTHING pictures  location huge many decor but classic bar condiments  Almost empty though My tacos mediocre but OILY  Al Pastor dripping oil tortilla soaking wet  made stomach upset finishing only 2 those tacos  also Carne Asada tacos which flavorful but def wasn't best those cactus taco NO GO  think cactus more acquired taste crunchy slimy flavorless   don't know feel this  think just hated because taste buds probably expected meat flavorless plants lol  But still nice veggie options people! Lastly wanted talk horchata because LOVE but horchata SUPER SWEET barely could taste drink drinking warm sugar   also unsanitary because watched scoop drink ladle white dirty bucket   yeah sure if place i'd come back to    I don't writing bad reviews because feel all restaurant good bad days but place wasn't clean food wasn't good quality whatsoever  service passable but not coming back  drove 30 mins won't come back there's many other amazing taco trucks places to    Be safe put into your stomach some places cause food poisoning place just waaay unsanitary food quality super low  Check some other taco places yelp! <EOR> Food awesome fresh  Lots options  great chicken burrito  think bar upstairs which plan hanging days! <EOR> Best elote ever made  food world  bar many different salsas all which fantastic  Every bite ate carne asada burrito tried different salsa  having different burrito each bite  Lots sides bar choose well  Traditional veggies cucumber onions grilled uncooked   Black beans etc  can't say enough elote  off hook!!!

I usually order carne asada tacos elote both which DIVINE but occasionally mix order few carne asada vampiros instead  Paired glass bottle Coke some flan can't wrong   With several people working grills other stations service always quick easy long know want before approaching counter  highly recommend stopping whether Tropicana location Eastern which full bar larger dining area  <EOR> From guess place seems pretty authentic  ordering little confusing first but hang it    Stand front type vessel want    taco burrito nachos etc  choose your meat   many types hadn't heard before but don't swayed if aren't familiar  people behind counter very helpful friendly   Just ask tried cabeza another beef carnitas carne asada   All yummy   Next time try corn al pastor!  salsa bar pinto black beans! mention all veggies different salsas!  serve cold beer well <EOR> For past year living Las Vegas suffered serve authentic Mexican foot withdrawals   then finally savior came form gran taco  Taco Taco ahh where start? taco bar??

Damn wish practiced Spanish more high school!  Anyway let's food   burritos quesadillas tacos bowls but little street tacos!  asada carnitas al pastor   Asada Meat very flavorful juicy   Sometimes when asada other places dry tough   stuff delicioso   Carnitas ok favorite three   Al Pastor WINNER WINNER WINNER!!!!!  meat INSANE   Such good flavor sauce put top great!

Lol  I'm sure happened but going say friends over hyped place me  friend Ryan let tell know Ryan very particular food  He's hospitality major customer service also Ryan's priority list    Tacos okay  Don't al pastor adobada  Don't waste your time  nasty  good side carnitas point  Try mula quesadilla extra goodies inside your choice meat! $4 but pretty tasty    Okay   Biggest disappointment   vampiro  supposed deal breaker recommendations got  Yeah no  Totally burnt tasting  Why? Cause burnt it!   Ryan thinking   Maybe off day  ? But then thought tacos el Gordo doesn't off days  decided fault which rightly is    Oh salsa bar pretty sweet  problem  No labels  Thanks mystery taste adventure but if someone allergic those sauces    won't look good later    Unless you're bored don't enough gas tacos el Gordo   Then walk take bus   Skip place if possible! <EOR> One emoji describe place The tacos de al pastor amazing Agustin frecas  <EOR> The sopes off hook!!

Instead telling veggies fresh she put them burritto    onions chewy completely dried burrito slightly warm when served   treating niece lunch also just OK slightly warm   Since edible took them home  proceeded add few more fresh ingredients pulled dried veggies threw broil   bit doctoring much better    I totally wasted $20 bucks lunch   I hate waste food but  second thought really should eaten made own lunch scratch    Will returning location! <EOR> Besides amazing food customer services also great  Every person brought loves food later asks name restaurant cross streets come back again  <EOR> If could give zero would   looking forward eating tragically bad al pastor tacos disgusting capital D why pineapple? Seriously? Then shredded chicken tasteless Taco Bell better ones   won't even describe al pastor burrito no words can   nachos looked good but then wasn't good even son literally eats anything would eat it   sad when pay good money food should thrown away waste still hungry!!! <EOR> The food pretty good  thing bummer customer service  Border line rude  couple times first time bad customer service wanted give them second chance  thinking guy could bad day something turns guy just plain rude  Won't going back  lot people work same experience  bad poor customer service  <EOR> Stopped first time friends'  recommendation  tried little bit everything since live no where near here  sure place used be  Very nice clean atmosphere  seat yourself  self service soda station salsa bar   Some things ordered Carne asada Vampiro tacos  fan Carne asada  only complaint place  meat very smokey flavor it  know some people enjoy them  Especially Mexican food  Smoked meat flavors BBQ   My favorite Al Pastor! OMG  MUST! gotta say probably best Al Pastor ever had  wish would gotten Vampiro instead Carne asada  all regular Mexican dishes  Nachos burritos tacos etc  never seen Vampiro before  two mini tortillas cheese your choice meat cilantro  Think mini tostada sandwich  uploaded pic too  Ordered chicken quesadilla  Nothing special  put guacamole sour cream cilantro chicken cheese   The CORN  Oh yum CORN!

Anything pork money   Ordering bit tricky newbie but staff super friendly accommodating  <EOR> By nature usually compare new things try favorites    I think comparison Taco Taco definitely Gordo's!   Upon seeing lay does scream copycat but looks deceiving because think offerings better Gordo's only point ill give Gordo's adobada  Taco Taco wins everything else   I love Gordo's but its always busy! know dumb reason knock them but am happy discovered Taco Taco friends   I'd also say chipotle mixed Gordo's  There's large seating area  always clean  salsa bar legit! really awesome thing your customers especially when you're dining in  label each sauce would good   My first visit during lunch break   I only person ordering took awhile food me  Considering large staff just didn't see possible    I can't knock them making food fresh but Gordo's quick   Whenever try new place always crazy ordering new things real taste food    This final conclusion food   I al pastor gran tacos which yummy  think flavor salty but still good  supreme taco sorts  larger regular tacos packed meat  also carne asada tacos which good  fries come full half sizes also carry nachos both sizes  any meat either  bowl today also really good  lot choices tacos    One disappointment when language taco no sauce it  Since salsa bar many salsas shouldn't problem but maybe suggestion which sauce pairs best each meat?   Overall hit me   My only gripe place don't ordering system  staff nice don't send different area they'll just tell order correct person  If found good ordering system way translate customers would easier them take orders easier them serve customers they'd more money return    They shrimp weekends but run three times been  can't wait try them though  <EOR> Good stuff  All meat beans tortillas made fresh all good  They very wide selection meats your standard carne asada carnitas shrimp more exotic cabeza lengua 3 things never even heard of! top all those meats even soyrizo veggie types overheard somebody say beans prepared vegetarian well  The ingredients all seem really fresh liked setup different stations different meats although nobody seemed following directions day    One complaint while delicious 'gran taco' definitely overpriced $4 50 fish shrimp  It's super close house but when feeling taco would definitely way taco taco  <EOR> I don't place   Al Pastor tasted deli meat   three four order still couldn't over idea why reminded cold cut   even tried experiment salsa bar even didn't work   just couldn't mask idea head     At least chorizo fantastic   greasy your average sausage   Just right amount crumble chunks mMmmm     Service great staff friendly   Spacious clean   After encounter Al Pastor highly unlikely ever return unless offer some type bread then maybe   Even salsa bar did nothing me   just underwhelming  *They didn't specify but free mexican corn check in   some wheat toast dry instead??? <EOR> I've looking good taco shop since day moved finally found Taco y Taco  only third visit already say Taco y Taco good gets when comes tacos  Taco y Taco place your order different stations   Tacos burritos bowls corn cob quesadillas   yes them all here   nachos quesadillas past thought pretty good   But all tacos them plain be  Chicken taco nothing it   Asada taco nada it   They're good don't need anything them satisfy me  tacos fresh tasty very very good   top hook restaurant clean   If haven't then you're missing out  <EOR> Great spot   Good fun super clean   Stoped while getting oil Change next door   breakfast burrito really tasty good size <EOR> By far best tacos ever had!!!!! recommend Pastor Tacos!!!!!
