Lee's designer sure knew stuff  Visually appealing  +Efficient Service  automatic vietnamese announcer voice calls your number when you're called your sandwich  then guy calls english afterward  Cute idea   The caveats The sandwiches more later Can't charge card unless $20 met there's handy ATM machine though! A bit Expensive Viet sandwiches  The sandwiches fast food most Viets  Lol worst but best  acceptable  #11 Special Combo #1 Lee's Combo #5 Grilled Pork #6 BBQ Pork all okay sandwiches  all came THIN cold quality meat less tasty sitting out  some traditional places your pickled daikon carrot slices cilantro placed separate baggie put yourself your liking  already place you  huge deal because some banh mi places but kind just reminds fast food feel  Veggies weren't exactly fresh    The bread dry french baguette isn't made fresh daily but okay  thinness scant flavorings ingredients bothers me  place fast food quality  could home  really worth price  Maybe because used traditional places ones Cali right quality meats preparation but helps let people know far good banh mi spot      Their ice coffee awesome though  bit hard mess loaded ice but still tasty  remember when younger ordered Starbucks thinking it'd taste viet ice coffee   I definitely disappointed!   I say Lee's really knows market! pleased empire doing well  first time experienced Cali now the first actually pretty good ages ago glad company doing awesome  But then again franchise   bad thing  no mom and pop contrary most people *might* think  But  saying Subway best sandwich you've ever your life EVER  I Subway once while   got nothing against them maybe you're happy that  More power ya!   What place does well introduce people banh mi  =] just okay bad great but fine quick bite  environment fun look awesome hang your friends no doubt  argue 24 hour opening especially late night cravings? Does warrant 4 star taste ambiance alone? Nope   As another reviewer asked would some hole in the wall over place bit better quality tasting sandwich? Yes  Because huge improvement over banh mi taste quality costs just much if cheaper probably all same street not much farther   simple dish expecting gourmet but doesn't mean should compromise taste everything else  recommend people try other banh mi shops better keep open mind! <EOR> The sandwiches alright  made fresh but bit overpriced  surprise  found some delicious steamed pork buns  buns soft fluffy filed flavorful meat  differs ones am used eating which typically Chinese Filipino style  some reason am leaning heavily Vietnamese style pork buns  just suits taste better  pork egg steam bun incredibly awesome  <EOR> Popped into Lee's quick bite tried grilled pork pork meatball banh Mi  bread fantastic! However very light handed meat veggies fill it  good ratio meat veggies bread Lee's fails here  veggies didn't snap pork pretty bland  shame filling fell short because bread scrumptious potential there  Lee's cheap open 24 hours does going it  I'd give another shot see if could find tastier sandwich  <EOR> The fact place open 24 hours huge plus late night owls boyfriend me   only ever spring rolls turkey sandwich croissant pork meatball sandwich   Yes slow when busy but less late night   biggest bummer started charging per item orders 9pm   Totally cool   Didn't seem stop though still 4 stars  <EOR> went order sandwich vegetarian style House veggie sandwich  consists vegetable mix put most every sandwich mayo  ordering sandwich off over year Was told no longer menu  asked if house veggies said yes asked if bread answered yes   would sandwich  Price never discussed just refused accommodate me  asking anything requires more work ingredients avaliable  fact almost all sandwiches come house veggies mayo   some worst customer service seen while  why sandwich shop refuse sandwich  <EOR> Nostalgia galore! Back when youngster ok back when 10 14 maybe young living Orange County family would often stop various Lee's Sandwiches around town always pretty damn good   So when driving 215 home California couple weeks ago saw giant billboard name Lee's Sandwiches excited  Very excited  stopped work following week picked some sandwiches boba smoothies brought all home  first thing noticed wow place pretty big! course now think other Lee's Sandwiches well but sorta forgotten it  would totally perfect place hang group friends meet someone conveniently which could done whenever seeing ALWAYS OPEN  The menu huge right large froyo area well giving lot options but sandwiches ordered BBQ pork grilled pork grilled chicken    Got home split sandwiches 3rds some each  delicious  But many others gripe comes amount meat sandwiches there's just enough! would rather pay extra dollar meaty sandwich then skimping meat  But regardless $3 50 10 sandwich good quite satisfied  already looking forward going back trying sandwiches   P S  According wiki bahn mi sandwiches originate French countryside salad sandwich perhaps there's reason why there's much meat  try asking more next time though  <EOR> What happened quality Lee's sandwhiches?

Try everytime town <EOR> Wow really?  all expecting especially all hype surrounded particular location   I live Bay Area CA where plenty Lee's Sandwiches  only San Jose but variety food offered mind blowing   when parents visiting sister Vegas she told massive Lee's just opened 500 employees according local news seeing all billboards expecting something fantastic   Well only did live hype didn't even live would expect Vietnamese sandwich shop be   Yes place ginormous but  primarily sitting area   Set bright plentiful McD's see people coming during wee Vegas hours    The actual menu though puny   Some basic Vietnamese sandwiches seen tiny locally owned shops offer better variety but mostly American sandwiches   Huh?  Aside sandwiches various sides desserts snacks offered   seemed place didn't really need big considering tiny menu   Sandwiches pricier Dakao just few blocks away way way subpar   grew Vietnamese sandwiches eat them regularly probably worst ever had  Edible yes  But far far cry authentic Vietnamese sandwich    wait pretty long too   tried siu mai pork meatball grilled pork   grilled pork tasted very little Vietnamese grilled pork but ok   great just ok   siu mai though very lacking flavor   never finished Vietnamese sandwich before but couldn't find finish siu mai   Also sandwich itself smaller expected   Apparently Vegas Vietnamese sandwiches smaller ones Bay Area but even compared Dakao Lee's sandwiches small   We originally planned eat lunch then order more sandwiches eat later day   But lunch instead drove Dakao bought some sandwiches which much better mention cheaper mention locally owned small business run cute husband wife team    At least girl took order spoke Vietnamese   But she wasn't very friendly which actually pretty authentic guess    Latino guy making pastries lot more friendly   Although serve some Vietnamese food don't know would actually classify Lee's Sandwich Vietnamese food place   honestly can't see place surviving but then again don't live Vegas   The reason am giving place 2 stars instead 1 sister said pate bomb  She said only redeeming quality   Unfortunately since ended ordering more sandwiches wasn't able try myself take word it  <EOR> Best Boba Smoothie ever had!   This place amazing    smoothies  level here     didn't try ANY food  only 5 bucks time    They let group hold super smash bros tournament though side room pretty decent price  plus ridiculously awesome boba smoothie made pretty great experience me  Looking forward next tournament just more those smoothies    To complaint below ridiculous put 25 cent surcharge all items       Consider opening restaurant 24 hours  Consider cost being open during hours business far booming   might understand needing charge just little more merely stay open 24 hours little easier  every cost increase world made greed  <EOR> Nice big Lee sandwich compare other Lee's  Go hear Lee's ice coffee  Better starbucks  <EOR> When think Chinatown Las Vegas doesn't usually equate extremely fresh baguettes  But  find Lee's Sandwiches Spring Mountain Rd  enjoyed recent visits here's why  Spoiler alert because Hello Kitty  No but seriously lot fun characters greet way in   It wasn't first choice try Lee's Sandwiches when many other options available few doors away  But discovered mostly good always open quick service restaurant modern Asian flare   After ogling freshly baked bread through peek a boo oven window ordering food top mind  hungry ravenous wolf roaming frozen tundra   Ordering little sketchy but thankful purchase fulfilled perfectly  bought two BBQ oversized pork buns #1 BBQ somewhat spicy pork sandwich meal small baguette Dr Pepper no ice  also came few egg rolls   Here's thing egg rolls  could nuclear hot when coming warming box but shoestring fries cold faster aluminum engine block Midwest during Polar Vortex   A small tip eat egg rolls first  Then pork buns finally sandwich  latest adventure Lee's trying smidgen mayonnaise sandwich  may shocking some added mayonnaise but made sandwich creamy spicy overall better tasting  Otherwise sandwich drier your mouth waking around desert 20 minutes   I'd order combo sandwich every time visit Lee's good  BBQ pork buns few dollars each but totally it  pork nice pink color hint sweetness exactly it   But what's Lee's? unfortunately few things must mention  first minimum purchase when using credit card  If order food past certain time day each item cost  25 cents more  If trying feed family those quarters add fast  Then there's drink ice refill situation  Order drink no ice cup isn't filed top just where beverage would if included ice  refill fee  50 cents next   Charging refills kinda baffling really? $1 large drink free refills all day  But maybe trying offset free WiFi TV? Probably but can't imagine electric gas water bills each month  All aside can't wait back Lee's Sandwiches  <EOR> I've never banh mi thought would break teeth while eating it   mention particular lee's very frugal meat toppings  <EOR> food decent but definitely best sandwich had  iced coffee super atrong creamy  <EOR> I say Lee's Sandwiches favorite place Bahn Mi  cheap nice size delicious  far place spacious well lit clean considering open 24 hours  those unfamiliar Vietnamese sandwich kind know expect and or recommendation order  favorite would grilled pork banh mi  Many friends mine Special Combination because contains variety meats but fond pat inside  wide selection beverages perfect quench anyone's thirst personally love Italian sodas  While never frozen yogurt adds another thing available   Also BRING CASH if don't plan spending $15 00 charge limit  <EOR> I going Lee's sandwiches years now since days Bay Area  actually tried something other Vietnamese BBQ pork sandwich time around  salami provolone sandwich croissant roll  Fantastic! piled high meat cheese lettuce tomato  sandwich filling couldn't finish tasty french horn dessert bought puffed pastry vanilla custard   love place can't understand mediocre reviews location  food good the prices better!

But very bad drinks  thai tea boba might well given tea bottle ranch market  <EOR> I came good handful times before actually found something good  When first opened because excitement  came 2 3 times hopes finding something good Viet chain  Unfortunately gave never looked back  Oh wait never say never? recently visited due fact friend night late night munchies but budget  Oh hey why Lee's since cheap its open 2 morning    Grilled Pork Bahn Mi mmm! nice flavor pork  spread also tasty actually fan most people refer super hard bread  just love crunch! veggies could used little bit more work because just 'blah ' Overall really liked especially size price  But mean most Bahn Mi places can't mess signature grilled pork sandwich  Highly recommend nothing else    Vietnamese Coffee first time drinking viet coffee made kinda anxious since heard few stories it  Pretty good first few sips tasted if hint alcohol  flavor  wanted more but ordered smaller size knowing deliciousness    The other things ordered past didn't satisfy pallet    Sardine Banh Mi veggies even worse first time around  Especially cilantro which pretty much wilted  didn't really taste spread nor see either  Let's just say sandwich sort disaster    first Lee's experience  Obviously giving good first impression    Coconut waffle looked really delicious being bight green color all  just order because looking eye waiting line order  Unfortunately super soggy ok coconut flavor  Kinda disappointed didn't live hoped for    Beignets once again looked delicious under heating lamps display case  UGH wrong    wasn't really fond texture  feel lacking something probably sweetness  Once again something recommend    Although did enjoy girlled pork banh mi doesn't all miss haps all other products  Plus only bahn mi fix if another those late night munchies kinda thing  Therefore 2 star rating sorry! <EOR> Cafe sua da must try!

Each time come usually order BBQ pork sandwich Honey Dew boba  Portioning good usually half sandwich leftover because first half boba itself gets pretty full    This location 24 7 but weekends especially night when want your late night munchies sometimes you'll hard time finding parking area  There's back lot area where could park well but you'd walk all way around entire complex building front enter store  Sometimes Lee's buy 2 boba 1 free buy 3 boba 2 free deal  never know when happens because random announce much you'd just find upon entering store   ***Minimum card $10 *** Late night experience may change $50 bills $100 bills keep your cash low  Asian snacks drinks stored around store well but appears bit more expensive regular Asian market it  <EOR> We picked morning coffee Lee's Sandwich Las Vegas Chinatown   Wow! biggest Lee's Sandwiches place I'd ever seen    Ca phe sua da $3 95 perfect cup ca phe sua da    The coffee good service fast    QUICK TIP LOCATED CENTER SPRING MOUNTAIN CHINATOWN PLAZA    4 stars!!

Anthony really helpful  mom big fan thai iced tea  sure stop whenever we're chinatown  <EOR> For those don't already know Lee's sandwich very popular franchise throughout west coast specializes Vietnamese deli refreshments desserts  Look McDonalds but little bit more healthy among Asian community  Back early years 2000 Lee's sandwich used favorite pit stops every time family would California  USED best BBQ pork baguettes CA combination baguettes die for  Now however given expansion franchise Vegas Lees sandwich gone down quality much only thing worth going just coffee 24 hr convenience   Whenever order sandwich always seems something missing core  Whether little meat little veggies little sauce never comes full consistent  meat use special combination also tasteless never seem put enough mayo sauce  Same BBQ pork  no BBQ flavors plus sweet always dry  Vietnamese know proper sandwich should made  Most Vietnamese people tell needs some  dashes soy sauce order wrap flavors  However seems if Lee's tried hard food Americanized more diverse crowd made everything bland flavorless almost healthy image   top workers making need more same page   once gone did sandwich well stuffed mostly bread when take bite  Also next time buy sandwich try leaving 30 min before eating it  Guarantee baguette hard rock  Same reheating sandwiches  outside should CRISPY hard! should way!

Pastries coffee good! But its sandwich shop continue ridiculously skimpy amnt meat had grilled pork again picked veggies kind bland guessing soaked long enough  give no more Lee's me <EOR> I *really* wanted place more considering HUGE seems much variety menu  yogurt area first thing caught eye but surprised know really wasn't many toppings expected if even all   open 24 hours entire place looks gigantic cafeteria  Bright lighting plenty seating  night came friends place nearly empty no issues finding spot    We cream puffs sugar cane drink  Cream puffs lacked taste felt cream middle really wasn't anything significant tasty the cream just   say sugar cane drink worth giving since sweet but overly sweet where sick halfway  Otherwise pastries bite sandwich friend wasn't anything special  Also always seem think places just offer cash paying method behind everything else technologically world unless family business  Hopefully next time experience different  <EOR> They the franchsie best vietnamese coffee!!!

ATM machine inside but bunch bologna  mention everything menu more expensive Lee's Sandwiches Orange County  also stingy napkins picked carrots sandwiches  Overpriced is  Sandwich decent pate chaud weren't good all meat sweet   <EOR> BBQ Pork sandwich decent but more forgettable Banh Mis had  inside restaurant ample space unlike parking lot even some groceries but felt kinda Vietnamese Subway restaurant   not really any charm   Update Grabbed another sandwich take road trip   this time Pork Meatball  pork absolutely no flavor  took two bites threw away  Only positive time iced coffee  <EOR> No  Sorry but horrible wait can't numbers right  Customer #5 does order before customer #2 even if same order  doesn't even sense!!   My friend ordered green waffle Miss customer #5 ordered green waffle thanksgiving feast   they gave #5 green waffle first without using electronic Numbering system both and us continue waiting   efficient  Then rushed friends order waffle came flaccid wet sex tape gone wrong    I'll give additional star nice employee took order fact rest correct items but wait inconsistency following service protocol using machine call numbers when full order ready ultimately going chase away many customers and stars     Come name but expect called order even if all ordered same item  Don't expect any consistency wait times regardless amount if customers present  <EOR> We always bobba drinks here  quick yummy dependable  busy but never effects service  <EOR> Finally chance try Lee's Sandwiches   seen franchises before always wanted try Vietnamese sandwiches   curiosity now satisfied   We shared #5 Grilled Pork Sandwich  #11 Special Sandwich   Both sandwiches tasted bland us   Nothing special all   Were good things restaurant?  Yes   restaurant clean service fine prices fair   Oh yeah Jackfruit smoothie pretty good too   I probably return anytime soon   Maybe another location future   Vegas many other places try first before coming back here  <EOR> I'm obsessed iced coffee club sandwich cream horn  meal heaven <EOR> I given Lee's many chances far many disappointments come way  think particularly high standards them because much better California  sandwiches usually sloppy lack of skimp amount necessary ingredients such pate picked daikon carrots  bobas inconsistent always soft plump should but rather shribbled hard center dripping boba water residue slushes teas  slushes watered down flavorless  taken town friends try embarrassed doing so  should've known when tried order Vietnamese person understood because no vietnamese workers there  really doesn't matter but certainly see why sandwiches par cravings authenticity  I'd rather hue thai best sandwiches  <EOR> This place sucks   come multiple times last 3 times kept waiting longer reasonable     Once bc didn't order properly made second time took 25 minutes only 4 other customers store   not sure why  considered busy   and last time no idea macaron flavors had   kept waiting 20 minutes payment say didn't 2 3 flavors ordered wasn't sure other flavors why don't write down?    They also handed cold manjo even though asked fresh warm ones guy said he'll take care us    crap shoot Lee's   wish could taken tip gave them tip jars all visits back   Also when asked refund macarons gave back pre tax refund   Wasn't worth ask tax wait again didn't bother   Bottom line Lee's sucks   Btw only entrance doors actually opens   sure why   Would recommend location  <EOR>
