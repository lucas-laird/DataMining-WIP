BUT! If something locked jaw goodness no NBA game could prevent that  faith just alright   I thought they'd bring bread something wait   I even thought they'd give bread gumbo something everything ordered literal  No garnishments look fancy  No side pieces flavor enhancement  order fish fish  While delicious food should need fancy garnishments bread to scrape your soups with   the fish would've tasted alot better lemon near something  literally thought could've did shhh   myself    We also ordered fries which came last! Seriously  whiny baby clearly NEEDED fries because life mother's sanity depended it  Hahaha  fries pretty interesting though different sizes fries  thin thick cuts feel having monotony same size cuts potatoes made fries  Weren't bad all   Our server wasn't bad  He just gave off new guy vibe he seemed timid? Hesistant? sure  asked high chair but husband ended grabbing ourselves because waiter clearly forgot  think he bartender well? way he served purpose  Good enough    Overall spent 50 bucks 2 alcohol beverages fries cup gumbo jambalaya salmon  wasnt complete satisfying rub my belly wholly crap awesome 50 bucks but out   we ate   it wasnt busy   staff nice   they game on   we nice time anyway mission accomplished    Would come back? Perhaps  Wouldn't way probably wouldn't list should to         note front restaurant garden nice see fresh tomatoes growing knowing they're self sustaining certain degree   Definitely kid friendly  Highchairs working buckles yay! Certainly stroller friendly if isn't busy there  If need southern fix  some hole in wall   I'd recommend them  <EOR> Awesome place Louisiana style food   Great atmosphere people   Jambalaya perfect   Best bartender <EOR> Spicy! Seasoned vs blackened you're dealing different spice palette  grits delicious shrimp tasty  mine without ragu still spicy taste but cooked well sure  also crab artichoke dip which super yum couple glasses wine dessert  great ambiance you'd never know place before if hadn't ever waiter hilarious attentive  let linger long dinner finish watching game  All all good food especially if spicy good ambiance wine  tad pricy but nice special occasion  <EOR> I always shrimp grits catfish grits also gumbo great! If po'boys great too! Love place <EOR> Meh definitely impressed place  took boyfriend birthday dinner since he's craving some Creole Cajun food man pretty disappointed meal   We came around 5pm which during happy hour though wanted order menu drinks half off didn't allow order if ate dining area which bummer didn't end getting anything off HH menu  don't understand why issue order bar just drink drinks table but just it    We gumbo crab cake étouffée half crawfish half shrimp    Gumbo 2 5 felt just eating soup barely tasted any shrimp all   Crab cake 4 5 probably best thing ate all food but portion very small shareable all   Étouffée 3 5 very bland  add salt but barely helped  shrimp good but definitely wasn't satisfying all   Service good complementary bread before meal  sure if try restaurant again but definitely didn't hit spot hoping fill  <EOR> Fabulous food! Service point  Comfortable  no rushed atmosphere  Enjoyed hot artichoke dip freshly grilled garlic bread Shrimp grits perfect Bananas Foster Bread Pudding vanilla ice cream Carmel good!
