Apparently Emily barely spared glance loudly replied Ok honey   well only waitress staff you'll need wait  sorry speak grown woman she's child you're parent kidding me?!  My manager sat back down looked said    ready won't drinking anything else  Sure enough when Emily FINALLY came back table manager waved off muttered something customer service skills   Actually most night manager spoke members staff shown rude Emily muttered straight something further annoyed her   cap off night Emily took tally when everyone leaving   grand total THREE ordered drinks never made back people ordered   A+ honey!  It point pulled phone start Yelp happened   only problem there's more PT's location down Hualapai when Emily came back asked address location   She didn't know   Furthermore another waitress didn't know   When manager finally showed confront office manager attitude ended verbal altercation where she stood said she leaving   only supposed he NEEDED last word he told her    please do! unsure if he really cared wanted save face just rub salt wound but he then approached remaining people party shook hands asked experience   approached explained manager understandably pissed off but calm willing explain happened put state   He only seemed less apologetic when told Emily said but assured nobody ever complained she worked three locations     Finally told two waitresses didn't even know address should further trained   Again he reiterated worked several PT's around area replied when 18 employed three jobs could told anybody addresses phone numbers each location   He seemed scoff bit believe world actually knowing where you're employed asked would happen if somebody called location?  He replied staff trained tell anybody calls nearest crossroad Flamingo Hualapai   which actually half mile away location   replied he should know most GPS systems don't operate crossroad instructions but rather actual address   Once again unsure supposed move experience when clearly only bar Las Vegas   Where else am supposed watch sports drink enjoy good food   Wait excuse me?  There's Buffalo Wild Wings other side Flamingo Hualapai?  won't smell cigarette factory when leave there?  Emily Chris don't work there?  Well why didn't say before?!
