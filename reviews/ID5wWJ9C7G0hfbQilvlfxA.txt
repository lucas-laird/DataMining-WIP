Great service heart downtown  recommend   <EOR> Great Drinks Food done very well Downtown Las Vegas!!! <EOR> Not sure what's wrong people giving place bad rap  gentrified hipster Mexican restaurant great food  Service great drinks decent  don't write many reviews but thought should receive some positive feedback because they're doing great job  Thanks guys! <EOR> Fremont East really coming life  Food drink options abound seem better each year    Love La Comida  rarely eat twice same place but during short three day trip hit twice    The food excellent  something called Torta Grande egg added  HUGE sandwich although large appetite could finish all  Took half bag gave guy street    The Torta Grande outstanding chips salsa came it  back Pozole outstanding well    There lot indoor some outdoor seating well spacious bar  Staff awesome  Professional helpful if you're having trouble deciding get    First class act all around    And bonus points playing Depeche Mode background    Looking forward return visit here  <EOR> The service La Comida pretty spot on  large group  said food ultimately just okay  <EOR> Great dinner La Comida last night  favorites tuna tacos shrimp tacos  delicious  Tried blood orange margarita first time loved it  Tip hanging bar great way dine drink away night downtown  <EOR> This place really nice employees great restaurant cute  food good but WOW recommend though <EOR> A group downtown hang wandered around East Fremont saw place 6th st  Looked interesting great ambience outside dining cool bar   thought we'd give try   waiter really unfriendly  don't think he smiled once  He always seemed rush when he came but place only 3 tables sat  hardly rush  ordering drinks ordered meals   all different types tacos skirt steak type dish  All food flavorful nachos little disappointing only four order  Hardly nachos hoped for  prices very reasonable music played awesome   would say outside unfriendly wait staff would probably back   if second visit waiter waitress same unfriendly no smile would return  many good restaurants Las Vegas put unfriendly employees   <EOR> The first thought flashed through head another new Pipster inspired corporate rollout complete ass breaking uncomfortable communal style tables Jelly Jars   Jelly Jars Kim Kardashian sort popular official gentrification bar glassware lunchroom seating   heavy sigh!  My second thought RUFKM!!!  If going order $19 margarita want gold flecked tequila slowly dribbled into mouth libation slave   pretty convinced going happen since couldn't even glass water insulted palate Boone's Farmish tasting sangria few slices orange floating dead goldfish   My third thought WTF!!!   could gotten better meal Del Taco drive thru without maybe should refinance house prices!!!    Pollo al Horno dry bland  Chicken Burrito dry undefinable overabundance spice made close inedible 2 Chicken Enchiladas Mole more dry chicken mole sauce tasted cinnamon paste dreadful! Communal rice beans Meh  We ironically glad kid sized portions because all meals ranged poor fair best   My fourth thought Really!!!  Haphazard inconsistent totally inattentive service no water no chips no follow up   My final thoughts heck outta never ever again   The star only because neon monkey cute <EOR> Eh   The service bomb but woman manager rolled eyes when made enchilada wrong    Who hell likes chocolate mole enchilada? Many food items odd overpriced  cheap stated  <EOR> La Comida joins downtown trend restaurants bars course it'll draw some attention!   I excited try place meet friend food drinks here  Bottom line better  definitely better Mexican food better drinks BUT fun place downtown hang grab some food yet try Le Thai    outdoor seating nice day couple beverages definitely worth it    I Shrimp Salad large shrimp mandarin oranges some walnuts sweet dressing  really liked salad when paired Prickly Pear cocktail    My friend chicken enchiladas red sauce  wasn't spicy but lacked flavor spices know chicken enchiladas usually have  sides rice beans    The service think still working kinks server brought copy receipt no place sign tip  ? matter resolved hostesses front   If downtown hanging bar hopping would hop over La Comida? Probably not    Would come Mexican food? Most likely not  better places valley Mexican food   Oh BTW few Mexican food restaurants don't give chips salsa start with   <EOR> Cute little place down town area  open air few little tables patio  am Texas am hard please when comes Mexican food Margaritas    It dinner time but came specifically margaritas  some chips salsa brought whatever  chips very crispy overly thick  salsa more chile based thick marinara which theory ok but missed mark  really great selection margaritas made fresh juices  ordered blood orange guava passion fruit  guava favorite  didn't pack huge punch which means being stingy tequila  mostly sweet except passion fruit which actually overly sour taste  If wanted fresh juice would fine    Over all paying downtown experience trendy little neighborhood nestled into  would come back remind them kick little tequila  really enjoyed sitting airy dining room last night Vegas  <EOR> The ONLY reason place earned 2 stars service     We greeted John bartender sitting few minutes only assume name name appeared receipt    I say John extremely attentive group left group right but somehow missed  couple left complaining something because only did chef come speak them but manager well  guess might takes service place  Another thing didnt John drinking ont he job he shot something group men right  BAD!!!  As decor lighting bad use flashlight phone read menu  menus lacked description item prepared but did list all ingredients  feel place very casual relaxed  Although VERY loud your typically Mexican home during dinner time    The food different anything experienced  your typical Mexican food  would even call Mexican more mexi fusion some sort    The chips salsa given heavenly  chips light oily but thin crumble while dipping  salsa blend roasted tomatoes green chili  spicy but could used little salt Overall very good    My husband shrimp dish he over moon shrimp cooked perfection sat atop bed sausage potato other veggies    I ordered pollo de horno menu did give detailed description sure getting other chicken  when arrived say taken aback presentation served paper package wrapped banana leaves  chicken 2 pieces leg thigh  poblano sauce squash onion chicken tender flavorful mouth watering write review    The down side meal sides served family style  small small platter rice beans enough 2 people seriously thought 2nd platter would brought since ordered 2 entrees  rice great texture flavor  would say almost good own  beans tasty am quite picky bean If Tia Jenny's forget it  pretty good Sorry Tia    I might try place again maybe sit table bar  place rather small lay looked catered larger crowds thought sitting bar would easier could serve more customers  Boy wrong  <EOR> Enjoyed fish tacos chips guacamole  bad margaritas but should use blanco instead reposado  <EOR> Not really sure say place  good intentions but jumping gun thinking downtown people stupid enough pay those sorts prices  only reason locals hang downtown avoid strip strip prices  food A Ok  Small portions big prices  queso fondue basically back solid pile cheese less then 2 minutes  shrimp tacos very small  boyfriend both margarita entree bill around $80 without tip  sure La Comida thinks doing  <EOR> Great food atmosphere but would no provide group 5 seperate bills  hassle! <EOR> Overall pretty good   Very much día de los muertos theme  atmosphere dark some soft lighting including candlelight  cool quirky revamped building fun interesting feel  noise level high Saturday night   The good Friendliness service Atmosphere general Pricing Nachos Poblanos Flautas de Pollo Chips salsa Guacamole  The OK Portion size Location  The bad Fajitas no flavor sizzling fire grilled Service little slow Noise level ok small group It mostly under 50 crowd quite few hipster millennials   <EOR> It second time there   time invited family member   love decoration atmosphere service however wasn't great   ate outside   table wasn't clean floor either  restaurant wasn't busy  server didn't understand order he gave attitude when tried clear misunderstanding  Unprofessional childish  He didn't even attempt understand saying he didn't want fix it  food ok wanted vegan burrito asked waiter if could choose ingredients the menu didn't offer vegetarian vegan burrito already   He basically told made veggie burrito but wasn't menu cooks going way   he offered vegetarian menu which decided order meatless chicken tacos organic salad   He never brought salad he brought vegetarian burrito instead pretty much pure red green bell peppers very watery covered salsa   weird! going back  <EOR> Happy hour $5 margs beer??!

Nice place communal seating very nice looking antique ish back bar very good service place worth checking out  drinks interesting massive selection tequilas $100 try if you're interested something other Jose Cuervo  Taqueria Taco Bell vs  upscale Mexican choice you  If want better former 2 place worth visiting  <EOR> We came across La Comida strolling down Fremont turned best decision made entire trip!

Over all horrible experience  would never back  <EOR> Finally good decent Mexican spot near East Fremont!  We decided stop La Comida few places allow underage diners 8pm East Fremont  SMH @ Park Fremont!  great experience Yelp Elite events earlier year wanted see place without VIP treatment    To begin restaurant pretty unique design decor  used previously laundromat transformed into chic cantina style Mexican eatery plenty Catholic influences  bathrooms gender separated pictures Mary Jesus while rosaries hang light fixtures  wonder if anyone ever gets offended it?  The menu little different most Mexican restaurants  No combo plates nachos instead find eclectic spin some your south border dishes  menu isn't huge but everyone should find something like  ordered Mexican burger sweet potato fries  fries delicious burger complete ancho chilies jalapeno bacon pretty unique  Word caution all burgers served very rare specify your server if want cooked longer  cousin ordered enchiladas which would great if ruined heavy serving mole sauce all over them  La Comida serves unlimited family style rice beans entrees everyone table share    Service great  server very friendly top refills very knowledgeable menu  nice see manager dining floor interacting diners well    You tell La Comida specializes margaritas massive tequila selection  Extra props serving concoctions mason jar!  walk window outdoor porch giant wooden swing bar nice touch If looking some good Mexican fare give place shot  least free chips salsa! <EOR> This great meal  Loved open air seating decor waitstaff friendly attentive and case waiter Frank adorable!

Very hip eclectic day dead decor which love its quirkiness pinch darkness  Only down side entrance no where near hostess station  friend reservation packed Friday night expecting chaos but pleasantly surprised! wait table long once seated waiter came over drink order within reasonable time    The waiter very nice explained things menu because first time there  Ultimately friend ordered three dishes avocado based salsa  Now things downhill me  First all food took quite awhile come which let them slide because extremely busy night but also came spurts which somewhat disruptive flow meal  Then food      Of everything ordered only liked dish  chicken enchiladas elote asado queso fundido  only dish elote asado because great taste literally addicting  reminded being LA getting corn on the cob version little cart    Lol! Ijs! fundido okay but enough meat me  enchiladas worst all  mole sauce which he said would kind sweet but wasn't  taste sauce awful chicken tasteless   great mole sauces them    Deeply disappointed! salsas    thin taste flavorful enough taste!   Overall cute business cute concept but food good enough keep coming back  However feel good place pre dinner drinks appetizers  purpose would back but would refer people great tex mex meal! <EOR> Piecing together stories heard La Comida imagined type establishment where food fine don't hold back tequila shots  Can't say much latter but food certainly good    RESTAURANT  Even during daytime difficult miss skeleton monkey sign entices your curiosity draws into restaurant  wooden tables long benches folding chairs give homey vibe  Day Dead elements rosaries hang walls add touches Mexican culture throughout dining room    FOOD  Complimentary bowls tortilla chips salsa presented light appetizer  say order guacamole too   Appetizer Queso Fundido Cheesy gooey goodness served hot plate    Entree Sea Bass La Baja When server explained only tacos menu use flour tortillas instead corn doubts  meal can't imagine corn being used tacos  tempura battered sea bass crunchy chipotle mayo added tolerable spiciness  would never thought pickled radishes complement other flavors  didn't disappoint   Dessert Flan best flans had  solid doesn't jiggle much  Smooth creamy super sweet   Dessert Fried Plantains ice cream Sweeter flan fried plantains retained crunchiness even ice cream started melt created pool bowl  Decent but prefer flan    SERVICE  No complaints  Everything ran smoothly   OTHER  The fútbol channel during visit   plus!  OVERALL  I would trek back especially try shrimp tacos watch more fútbol  Lunchtime seems ideal hour visit  wouldn't surprised if place becomes packed around dinnertime  reservations if possible  <EOR> The fish tacos great  blood orange margarita tasty certainly hearty amount tequila  <EOR> Tried place lunch  Hidden side freemont cute entrance  Tried chili relleno pretty close home  Tasty chips salsa cold Pacifico side friendly service  If you're fan patios outside ambience place does well  <EOR> According listed hours open until 11 p m  Mon Thurs but closed kitchen 9 30 no warning ruining plans  Super unprofessional just all downtown establishments but  beside point  downtown Las Vegas why close 9 30? Given other reviews own experience won't back  <EOR> What disappointment  outside menu selection La Comida showed lot promise  However when food arrived things quickly downhill  restaurant authentic food just isn't good    We ordered queso fundido  basically melted cheese extremely hard mess up  eaten appetizer million times million restaurants  only way ruin buying cheapest cheese probably isn't meant melted  think layer grease over cheese tasted rubber   My tacos okay  margarita which take very seriously joke completely overpriced   problem place  food mediocre way overpriced  <EOR> Great spot drinks great vibe  Hostess often aloof chilly but wait staff outstanding friendly  Chips salsa good   My major critique focus seems making food 'interesting' instead simply 'good'    Don't wrong applaud culinary creativity some fixings offered nice touch some dishes but just think when imagine going Mexican food   worse eat all your chips salsa full because plates little small ish   The tequila menu very nice  mentioned great spot drinks but food highlight La Comida  <EOR> Cool decor  Any good Catholic would love wall rosaries have  Maybe prayers good food good service answered because carnitas tacos $11 surprisingly good  Using diced morsels pork instead pulled pork flavors excellent loved crispy edges gave some textural contrast  Margaritas good expected flan de caramelo $6 little firm but still smooth velvety crystallized sugary top creme brûlée  <EOR> I met some friends birthday party staff no problem putting tables together accommodate large party  Drink orders taken right away checked often  chips salsa salsas $2 each hit miss chips being very good but salsa just eh  margaritas came mason jars tasted pretty good  Priced $11 Prickly Pear Margarita favorite ones had   Queso Fundito $12 Oaxaca melted cheese chorizo roasted poblano peppers cheesy delicious appetizer  Served tortillas big enough share even if don't want winner big hit myself group    Flautas De Pollo $9 Chicken Oaxaca cheese queso fresco sour cream tomatillo Salsa  Priced well plated pretty however more rolled tacos funky flavor  I'd personally pass future    Chicken Fajitas $17 choose chicken steak  chicken comes guacamole pico de gallo sauted corn bell peppers onions  chicken full flavor everything complimented each other nicely    They dessert but full try any  Maybe next time! also seating patio there's bar  Metered parking nearby  <EOR> This place true gem!  Well worth short block half walk Fremont Street   food delicious surprising more just authentic Mexican new fresh original   loved every bite   BEST guacamole ever had   come back again again   Cool casual vibe super friendly staff fun atmosphere  <EOR> I thought La Comina just ok  friend recommended restaurant love Mexican food   specials thoughttje good ok  come town lot great Mexicans restaurants higher expectations  say margaritas delicious!

Less spendy Main Street gig LOVED mason jars! Great touch! <EOR> Well holy shit first Vegas review!  recently relocated city Vegas work beautiful Derby City Louisville KY am having blast exploring city everything offer let's down it!  To beauty Mexican food very communal down to earth   Its flavors brought life through simple preparation simple ingredients mixed just right   just good homely food free pretentiousness generous quantity best enjoyed laid back unassuming environment   And  precisely where La Comida its cool bohemian ironically hip vibe collides heart soul traditional Mexican food   strips away real idiosyncrasies authentic Mexican dining order offer distant mutated version conveniently prepackaged haughty trend seeking crowd   Let's face no Mexican restaurant touting any kind authenticity would charge damn much such modest portions nor would pepper its ambiance faux Latin cover Sweet Dreams Eurhythmics dubstep remixes Ace Base which caught playing over PA   To fair food bad   Pollo al Horno actually tasty though bit dry side chips salsa also quite good obviously homemade   service also pretty good prompt very courteous basically root dissatisfaction comes down price   Look if you're going charge $20 margarita expect commemorative pair booty shorts kitschy container take home something   also no way shelling $5 PBR unless barrel also feel if going pay $16 chicken entree should own rice beans   Having share such tiny portion entire table didn't feel courtesy but more peeve   I'm sure want back La Comida   sense they're trying elevate experiment Mexican cuisine which all fine good but food just okay which considering prices ambiance means they're way off mark   cool vibe never replace satisfactory dining experience echo sentiments those who've said much rather eat cheap seedy joint offering better food reasonable prices   On note recommendations GOOD Mexican place?  Sorry LV area where still remain far impressed! <EOR> Straight manager      Saving tables bigger party 5 2  Just post sign saying don't want couples going eat your place  Terrible why city allowing type establishment exist  <EOR> I hoping really place many spots area delish Le Thai Park Fremont but bummed lackluster food price pay    We usually sangria when any menu  La Comida's sangria aight  felt more ice sangria tho  Second elote  C'mon   how ever dish really wrong!?! corn mayo cheese  delicious! Sadly forget boyfriend but know he fish half chicken wrapped paper    sorry bad description      fish whatevs chicken good smoky but something would try again  Our dessert sautéed bananas vanilla ice cream star show  Something ice cream   I think real vanilla beans! waaaay = Overall paid almost $70 lunch MEH   Going Tacos El Gordo and or Mundo should've gotten money day  <EOR> La Comida highly recommended friends know Las Vegas well  every bit good promised   We very good lunch La Comida today  group six leisurely meal  chips warm crisp fresh  guacamole $8 delicious  grilled fish tacos $12 excellent! Chicken Enchilada $14 just right level spicy  Beef Fajita $17 very good too  also Ensalada Organica $10   All servings generous  Beans rice served separately two large platters individual plates crowded heaped food    Our waiter Frank efficient friendly   He made feel very welcome  noise level low  La Comida best Mexican Restaurants experienced  <EOR> I love design put into old building salvaging former structure  Weird Santa Muerte altar over kitchen stained glass above bar add character  Complimentary chips salsa outstandingly yummy  chicken tacos  prefer Pepe's tacos prices  But chips atmosphere really set La Comida apart  Good place date prices it  <EOR> Yum! La Comida consistent service taste overall atmosphere! twice now things just keep getting better  little pricier average Mexican food joint expected anything downtown but definitely worth it    I'd recommend trying shrimp tacos! They've staple each visits which count something  entree comes 3 tacos overflowing flavor succulent lightly breaded shrimp tucked into bed purple cabbage diced mango which tied together delicious jalepeno cream sauce salsa   My only critique appetizers    complimentary chips salsa perfect but tried both corn queso now both fell flat opinion  corn tasted soggy cooked pot water long while queso extremely hard eat  cheese made wasn't nearly melty enough easily scoop chip bit tortilla  Kinda disappointing but other entrees easy overlook  <EOR> We'd walked restaurant peek talk girl front menu any questions had  friend asked if used lard refried beans but she said she didn't know  He asked vegetarian vegan options menu she didn't know   We made mistake going next day lunch  Awful service high prices music little loud  large party seated fairly promptly just promptly ignored  No contact past door  restaurant barely half full clearly wait staff weren't really all busy    The food saw around room tiny portions especially high prices  wasn't keen paying $8 bottle Corona  if hate service yourself if spending lot money being cool  15 20 minutes no contact staff party marched out  <EOR> Had great lunch experience recently  shrimp tacos very flavorful perfect size lunch  Fresh salsa guac chips always replenished timely manner  can't wait back try some margs! love Tamarind marg fave flavor  Looking forward returning soon <EOR> This favorite downtown restaurant  especially Camaron del Golfo grilled fish tacos  both interesting mix flavors works  Sunday afternoons when vibe little mellow  <EOR> Delicious margaritas  pozole fan but pozole delicious helped hangover little  <EOR> We REALLY wanted place  decor both inside far best thing aboout place  sat down bar excited thinking may found new place food drinks  ordering 2 different margaritas drinks proved themself meh   nothing special weak side  watching female bartender pour other patrons drinks noticed she once measured ammount alcohol she putting into drinks  She just screwed cap off poured some and no little silver measuring things   price appearance resturant expected better   Next ordered appetizer  asked female bartender most common best was  she suggested creamed corn  She claimed good crack cocaine   I just can't enough  I eat everyday!    We thought weird comment customer but whatever its Vegas  BTW corn sucked   We left this  might back few months see if replaced bartender  haha  said earlier really wanted place  <EOR> Worst Service EVER!
