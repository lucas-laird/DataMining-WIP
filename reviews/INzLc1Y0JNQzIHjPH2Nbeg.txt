Started Chorizo cheese dip chips the  Briskett tacos! Everybody nice cashier cook  Plus good place hangout friends drink  Highly recommend  <EOR> Fantastic food! Walked into place thinking going another mediocre taco place  food incredibly good authentic 15 beers tap  Great prices great food! <EOR> Checked Yelp close 10pm  Rushed over because missed dinner due work tonight    Walked 9 56 order couple tacos  kitchen staff shook head said no  Wow!  seemingly floor manager also said no closed  cashier apologized at least he wasn't rude but also told he couldn't take order   questioned being before closing time  assured the kitchen already cleaned up  Won't back   terrible customer service! <EOR> I definitely liked spot  your authentic Mexican cuisine if  you're looking for  perfect  pretty picky especially while pregnant didn't custom order anything here  Oh take back ordered nachos no feta YES feta nachos but only because unfortunate pregnancy no no  Hubby fan said basically glorified Taco Bell which don't agree with  chips queso bomb even though queso more velveeta aspect cheese  nachos huge enough multiple people eat off sopapillas perfect sweet ending  would definitely come back but maybe myself since hubby didn't bit pricey whole family four  <EOR> This place located newly built area restaurants waiting them open every since saw sign building months back The place clean food came fast friendly staff handing your order once your buzzer off  ordered fajita beef burrito fajita chicken quesadilla ground beef nachos  3 best nachos quesadilla mainly cheese beef burrito okay beef little tough  suggestion would salsa bar sauce stuff table but didn't enhance food different salsa do  end meal staff offered Togo containers when clean trays another asked meal  hope keep kind customer service days hard find  <EOR> This place amazing!! Great food options portions point  atmosphere chill relaxing  food quality much much better Roberto's Zabas not sure else compare place   service outstanding! definitely back!! <EOR> Yeah place new lot potential   inside really nice plus outdoor seating area great cooler months   serve beer which plus though didn't any   did look good selection though    The food   Well maybe ordered   ordered taco plate two tacos choice two sides    chose shrimp taco shredded chicken taco both corn tortillas  side cilantro lime rice black beans   Unfortunately step better Cafe Rio those follow know hate Cafe Rio   good first showing     The staff other great  Super friendly helpful tell really enjoy jobs    I'm sure if try again  challenge to  parking lot impossible Rainbow alway busy   Give try let know think    Cheers  <EOR> When establishment going respect customers wishes and advice start serving horchata?  decent place for tacos but without horchata true mex restaurant! <EOR> the lady cash register very nice helpful orders   its expensive  special dollar drinks   definitely come back <EOR> Not fan  another reviewer said par Taco Bell Del Taco only priced lot higher  beef Taco just bad  Perhaps carne asada better but don't know  chicken taco decent but enough redeem disappointment beef   Queso great  liked lot  On minor annoyance all food coming separate platter made table 4 very cramped just annoying   I wanted love but doubt back  <EOR> Maybe fuzzy tacos aren't everybody?   Just straight no thanks   You order then grab your food window  decided taco plate chicken fish side refried beans cilantro lime rice  Everything bland  cover entire plate limes hot sauce  shredded chicken taco only thing decent but fish super dry  also don't salsa salsa bar  Really? fast food Mexican place without salsa bar? Normally would never use hot sauce but wasn't option here    The space itself nice industrial lots natural light but filthy trash tables all over floors  always discouraged when see because wonder kitchen  Skip far many great Mexican options around town  <EOR> Wasn't bad Tex mex  easy reach location good ambiance  flow little awkward confusing food but overall average   I ordered brisket nachos but little bland verge being overpriced  only put cheese meat pico chips if wanted peppers sour cream extra  guess expected more  tasted very similar average fast food joint    Del Taco Taco Bell etc    But thing bonus serve alcohol! But food wasn't favorite  <EOR> When found breakfast tacos elated! Finally taste home  But over several visits sampling many menu items service above beyond   but food just isn't very good  unfortunate because dishes sound great but actual product lackluster  many other reviews mention tortillas cold seem store bought  also very little protein  If tacos your specialty why your worst item?! + Tortillas portions aside brisket tacos fairly good don't find them easily town  probably protein choice here  + Oh opt California Heat style if you're doing shrimp otherwise pretty plain  + Baja tortilla soup thick chunky stew actually really good  Recommend would order again  + breakfast tacos!! they're served all hours!! But really disappointing  Aside cold tortilla scramble toppings into egg which isn't used to  egg looks tastes cooked filthy flattop  Why something if don't well?! + While difficult execute salads pretty good avocado dressing hands down best tried  But splurge shrimp because shredded chicken super dry No salsa bar?! branded bottles table more flavor heat made think upgraded version stuff Taco bell packets   Like said minor issues little attention detail could fix  service super friendly attentive genuine  just need kitchen staff board same priorities come back queso chilaquiles   definitely potential  <EOR> I've gotten food twice far both times tacos burritos quite good  Nice portions meat satisfying taste  back again more! <EOR> Not very good shrimp tasteful   While didn't even give shrimp   While garlic over powered feta did great   Sorry but wouldn't again   <EOR> Ok let's negatives way bright day which ambience strange maybe little off putting even  Especially when very busy which often  Also flavored margaritas stellar   Now positives  place freakin deal! Food tacos definitely above average two entrees two alcoholic drinks $25! top play 80's music all time we evenings which fun  Plus sports tv's all good  Definitely place enjoy coming back to  <EOR> My sister Denver used rant rave Fuzzy Taco Shop excited see location open Las Vegas  last night LOVED food  menu expansive serve alcohol there  combo included  taco enchilada plus two sides $6 99 VERY REASONABLE PRICES   My boyfriend hard impress loved also    A couple people around nachos MASSIVE  try those next time    I am glad Fuzzy's town place next time want quality  food great price! <EOR> NEVER EVER FUZZY'S TACO SHOP!!!!!
