My friend then made reservation dinner she other half tried Chica lunch   Since lot different items review would pass 2 favorites Pepita Crusted Lamb $45  3 5 stars   Colorado lamb herb pumpkin seed crust mole verde crispy squash blossoms grilled calabaza  Having no idea half stuff just blindly agreed try dish   After all dish brought friend hubby back another meal!!  I absolutely adore lamb but BF indifferent when find people willing try new dishes ALL IN!!  The lamb itself prepared beautifully   Medium Rare please!  Perhaps just used Pepita pumpkin seeds being used crust mole verde which made primarily pumpkin seeds green chiles   The mole verde wasn't bad creamy but didn't much flavor profile could discern  Aside adding moisture lamb felt mole lost   I think watch much Food Network  When saw fried squash blossoms thinking bright orange red flower gets fried tempura batter  didn't see anywhere plate??  I didn't even try grilled calabaza West Indian pumpkin because didn't know where plate??  This dish really celebrated PUMPKIN humble opinion  LAMB  If known all fancy items before tried lamb quite possibly could prepared myself less dramatic crescendo   I secretly hoping chimichurri sauce    *Sad Face*  Definitely lesson learned if don't know ingredients GOOGLE before trying   Nothing against friends Chica just enjoy big bold flavors chimichurri sauce!!  Porchetta Crispy Yuca Hash $36  4 5 stars   Suckling roast pig crispy brussel sprouts fried yuca pearl onions escabeche pork jus  honestly thought going favorite dish evening    but there's actually tie?!  I love pork much swear OINK every time speak!!  I watched spit rotate while giant porchetta roasting over open flame  glorious moment was!!  The porchetta roasted perfectly served piping hot crispy!!  Cutting into porchetta satisfying  meat tender inside crispy outside   That crispy pork skin excellent!!  The brussel sprouts absorbed all rich pork jus which added nice flavor favorite vegetable! almost good having brussel sprouts bacon!!  I still imagine licking fatty porky juices off lips    Mmmm  Good!  Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken $26 Half Order 4 pcs   4 stars   Famous Rotisserie Chicken marinated Meyer Lemon slow roasted perfection Peruvian purple potato salad chimichurri  Now biggest surprise evening   For those know really enjoy CRISPY fried chicken   Having just tried Yardbird next door same owners being quite disappointed non crispy chicken wasn't really expecting enjoy roasted bird   Boy mistaken!!  This chicken roasted open flame!  The skin wasn't terribly CRISPY little bit challenge eating chicken its own  guess same texture remove skin cold ginger chicken    huge fan flaccid skin   The Meyer Lemon flavor evident gives brightness dish   The CHIMICHURRI SAUCE Chica phenomenal!! sauce could put fast food burger would eat it!!   Note LOATHE FAST FOOD SAYING LOT!!  What chimichurri sauce star evening robust intense garlic olive oil parsley flavors  thought noted some cilantro sauce but could wrong   OMG some favorite items world    all bright green sauce   After slathering dollop chimichurri onto plate silently cursed myself telling friend order just half     While server extremely personable friendly say wait staff different story   We few plates sitting while brussel sprouts yuca hash there  Without even asking busboy just swept dishes took kitchen   I thought bit weird since going eat brussel sprout!!!!  None busboys asked anything before clearing rest table   That's fine just remember shoo them away next time!!  I'll back Chica!! <EOR> This best food Vegas  tasty amazing service portions everything!

But dining experience itself absolutely terrible  group 7 people  ordered several appetizers received appetizer entire table waited least 15 mins remaining appetizers arrive although several them easy things chips guacamole chips salsa   Then received entrees  Two friends ordered steak both completely cold when arrived  notified server said she would bring new steaks them  Another person ordered corn which did seem fully cooked when received  boyfriend ordered side dish rice which menu said fried rice beans topped fresh avocados   Halfway through eating rice realized small pieces pork there     vegetarian boyfriend kosher jewish obviously doesn't eat pork  pork absolutely called menu  Also edamame rice which called out  instead fresh avocados scoop guacamole  notified server she said really?  menu? checked again sure called all  She asked if wanted remade said absolutely since neither eat pork  should even question  two steaks then arrived but clear just cooked little longer replated awful guys just asked send plate back  point every else pretty much finished meals new rice dish came when done eating  Absolutely nothing done remedy dishes wrong except comped steak sent back  am shocked service extremely disappointed <EOR> Restaurant week amazing time year where many eateries Vegas offer set menus discounted prices donate part price 3Square Food Bank  surveying some

fish tacos hearty but lacking any outstanding flavor  Another girl ceviche more soup de ceviche  liked but she disappointed since she expecting something more traditional   Our server different attitudes throughout meal   sometimes he hot sometimes he cold  understand big group but don't think demanding rowdy sure why Jekyll Hyde   All all decent enough experience warrant three stars but don't think worth $40 person price tag brunch  <EOR> Wow great find   being able table Bouchon best thing could happen us   restaurant top notch We're glad able eat here    food beyond amazing every single dish amazing!
