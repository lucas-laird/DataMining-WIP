I tend steer clear AYCE establishments time limit because slow eater idea being timed stresses out   could tell there's no time limit here   2 hours   Service excellent   server kind weird but very entertaining!  haha   chatting some apparent regulars learned service very different if sit table instead bar  <EOR> We came fairly large group 6 people Saturday night around 730  wasn't busy except another large group next couple people bar  put first order everything came quickly except Sweet Ebi  Being table 4 hungry boys put another order  order took quite some time time boys starving all over again  also told run hamachi  Really? Yellowtail probably more popular fishes everyone orders didn't any   All rolls good nothing spectacular it  took probably good 45 minutes everything come out     they would bring thing time then would wait another 15 minutes something else  sitting good hour half decided time go  Even though some boys left hungry just tired waiting  server taken away menu ordered second round another reason why didn't order again  Sushi decent but sure returning when million gazillion other AYCE sushi joints there  <EOR> I eating sushi since eleven years old  ten years experience now would know good sushi tastes like  place honestly isn't bad but wasn't fully impressed either  Happy Hour 2pm 5pm around $19 person same menu dinner  Honestly service bit slow bf starving! But course more patience most people ordered two time  Plus sushi chef also working table six before and ordering BIG rolls   usual nigiri salmon yellowtail halibut eel would've gone tuna tamago shrimp but full Stacie roll Shrimp Lovers roll  also ordered some sides baked mussels seaweed salad skewers dynamite edamame  which all good  Tried quail egg first time which actually liked lol  also some good meat options teriyaki chicken tonkatsu which comes rice   prices lower end when comes AYCE sushi which place  wouldn't say skipped quality either  dessert good variety flavors regular mochi ice cream  mention also la carte menu order from  Overall bad! don't reviewing places aren't 5 stars but just mention place's happy hour such good deal! <EOR> I love great tasting fresh sushi steal! place offers  sure Anthony your sushi chef  He best!

Another love garlic tuna flavorful fresh!  For price $23 99 dinner $18 99 happy hour 2 5 pm think place worth checking out  really great tasting specialty rolls them which Stacie Roll  Two thumbs Anthony making sushi taste great   One more thing tamago probably freshest tamago ever tried anywhere  could probably place just order tamago tamago tamago because good! takes forever though but worth wait   The service excellent during both times there  place crowded both times I don't why isn't food good! servers sushi chef dedicated probably two other groups   Do check place! location isn't good Durango and there's never any traffic Durango Flamingo Salvation Army  But trust worth trip!
