But hey Vegas  assumed just part image restaurant wanted create  server nice polite over recommendations  decided split seafood spaghetti grilled baby octopus onion soup  order seafood spaghetti    the lobster no where found shrimp over cooked definitely worth $45! price pasta dish would expect lot more content! crab meat barely existed well  onion soup just any other onion soup    no cheese covering top but simply only small baguette some cheese sprinkled bread swimming soup  also tiny raviolis soup   wasn't really anything amazing  $14 soup  octopus probably best dish  nicely charred which liked  But worth $18? Probably not  Since didn't try any raw items maybe known for  Vegas many good restaurants choose don't think going back  Kudos hostess since she very courteous although bit early reservation she worked us! <EOR> I came quick dinner before taking spin class  found portions large size food flavorful  loved poached shrimp cocktail sauce  also enjoyed cauliflower steak bronzino  only thing bronzino really oily lacked flavor beyond grease although told baked  Sometimes much oil takes away true taste fish   Besides fish lacking flavor nice filling meal  <EOR> Literally *days* writing first review back lunch  They're process fixing problem caused temperature issues  Food service top notch  <EOR> Stumbled right before closed Thursday night luckily wasn't crowded  bf decided enjoy rest night bar order some light bites drinks    Started off glass Merlot mussels braised curry served pipping hot pita  pita burnt surprised served way  mussels fresh cooked perfectly  curry sauce robust nutty but way much oil it  tons oil puddles swimming mussels    The yellowtail crudo definitely potential  served beautifully platter fried onions added nice crunch dish  However yellowtail fishy could because night almost over  hoping more hints grapefurit some additional flavors would recommend incorporated bit stronger yellowtail    Marco bartender absolutely awesome made sure well taken care of!
