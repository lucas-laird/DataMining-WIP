He even started talking he felt girl taking order! then she attitude me! felt highly disrespectful secondly surprised childish behavior being represent famous popular franchise Chipotle  never issue other Chipotle locations  If known would issue should told would gladly walked left without problem  would reported todays concern manager but seeing most employees facial expressions look miserable working there  figured manager those employees also looked miserable why waste breath? Word advise those working night   mainly caucasian green gauges  If job isn't paying enough keep happy  better job  Chipotle   fire guy   he sucks your company    I'll stick Zabbas now great food very similar Chipotle always superior customer service mainly common sense  <EOR> New store understand inexperienced crew but beg decent portion size meat steak tacos  Overall food quality great  <EOR> Excellent customer service!  employees friendly way your experience great     I prefer veggie bowl guacamole best   times chicken fatty side     Great flavors  Great costumer service  <EOR> The customer service good portion sizes always consistent when go  Its good place post workout  <EOR>
