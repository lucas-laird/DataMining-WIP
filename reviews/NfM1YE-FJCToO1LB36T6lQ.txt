Never again  first time came mom awesome  talked months returning  Well finally did tonight wish hadn't  walked completely empty restaurant  Literally only ones building  ordered food two meals which included salad bar  order handed number but no plates salad bar  while since thought maybe would come sandwiches   which doesn't really sense but  besides point  decided ask people working food counter if could salad plates early start while waited rest food  big deal right? Wrong  stood front FIVE employees while every single did everything power eye contact me  Really? stood solid 2 3 minutes before returning table completely irritated  few minutes later decide back just ask instead wait someone acknowledge me  asked gentleman working behind counter plates blank stare don't know luckily girl behind heard pointed right direction  Finally! Until he handed extremely gross obviously dirty bowl acted irritated when asked clean one  All say no wonder restaurant empty  Lesson learned  Your food only good your customer service  <EOR> Fantastic choice! first time eating great   ordered salad bar didn't wait line because salad bar orders paid machine front    best salad bar ever eaten! dark muffins outstanding touch ginger  loved potato salad veggies prepared better then ever seen  The broccoli cut reduce stems cucumber slices extra thin  Attention detail impressive   Asian salad tasty  whole place tasty  Great hummus too   only issue minor Jason crackers very hard bite  don't know if because extra thick ingredients age    Overall love place  <EOR> I enjoy eating Jason's Deli  staff friendly very attentive  Also restaurant spacious there's plenty seats always available    I usually come salad bar gives Sweet Tomatoes run money  plenty options choose everything super fresh  favorite item which totally defeats purpose eating healthy chocolate mouse pudding  available only salad bar  Trust smoothness mouse mixed whole chocolate chips die for!   Here's tip if plan returning frequently I'd invest Jason's Deli thermos cups which sale $3 99  Bring back returning visits pay only $ 99 refills <EOR> Love place! recommend Smokey jack panini chicken noodle soup especially soup when you're sick favorite chicken noodle soup ever  Idk why but absolute best  I ordered pickup today usual order  Sandwich crammed tiny container why? Lol but everything delicious  I would suggest Jason's deli maybe some flavored chips side option    I LOVE place soup alone worth going!  Try especially if you're feeling well chicken noodle soup best! <EOR> The boyfriend wanted subway but want try something different    so Jasons Deli was  Everything really good  homemade sandwich but better feel it  Loved it     But kinda pricey homemade sandwich   price only reason gave 3 stars  <EOR> I'm fan  until last week always thought chain Subway Jersey Mike's clone  Turns they've more extensive menu hot cold sandwiches pasta soups salads salad bar  sandwich tried  Poppa Joe  pretty good Turkey asiago tomatoes basil pesto focaccia  Portion sizes aren't crazy Capriotti's other places that  They're more healthy normal sized meals  Soft serve ice cream also complimentary  <EOR> It's long time but decided see if things improved nearby wanted salad bar situation    say happy find things better  it clean service good friendly  Salad bar well stocked w fresh items   only complaint ranch dressing   tasted artificial bottled cheap stuff  think salad bar need best dressings   love ranch  good ranch plus no french dressing offered   reason would back salad bar   it's personal preference   bad cause could great  <EOR> I used work here  Let tell everybody reading this  Don't ever ever location  clean  use  rags clean bathroom then clean tables same rag  remember kid threw mop then used same mop mop floors during closing without disinfecting it  soups aren't handmade come frozen inside bags! Same sauces  Brownies cakes etc delivered  leave meat ice cream over night  Customers don't know but few mice well  experience sucked! happy leave! never step foot inside any other Jason's deli ever again!
