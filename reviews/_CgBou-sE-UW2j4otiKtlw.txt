Oh no!  Well every once while visit old friend Beef Burrito   location recently enjoyed lunch   Nothing special though   Will return?  Possibly  <EOR> mmmmmmm tostada  didn't realize delicious until finished 80% salad there  then broke off piece fell love  crispy buttery savory  loved it!!   the burritos taquitos very disappointing though  rice apple sauce enjoyable either    this place deserves 4 stars because condiment bar tostada  free pico de gallo salsa? yay!!!!!! <EOR> not real mexican food but decent substitute pinch <EOR> YUCK!  Baka burrito COLD!  mole sauce instead ranchero sauce just can't seem find RIPE TOMATOES!
