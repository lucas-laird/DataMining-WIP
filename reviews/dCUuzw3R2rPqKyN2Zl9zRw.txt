We ate Fiamma before going see Cirque de Soleil's Ka MGM   made reservations 6 45 p m  able seat right away   The table right entrance seat right behind menu where people walking could check out   didn't really table b c lot people walking then right next table looking menu   Other food excellent!  gave bread olive oil which good b c two basket fulls   ordered sea bass side potatoes completely stuffed   also glass wine which great!    The restaurant definitely pricey would nice if bit cheaper  <EOR> Get Gnocci   outstanding!  Tried feed craving locally completely disappointed  Can't wait re visit!  only reason am giving 4 stars service little slow waiter didn't seem act together   Other party 8 very pleased food  <EOR> Food just OK   Drinks Bar mediocre   bartender made terrible Vodka Gimlet sure mess such simple drink   Service excellent   Considering prices would find different restaurant  <EOR> I want give 5 stars because lasagne October 2016 perfection  pasta really took over top  Perhaps slightly thinner freshly made  cannot sure  divine light if word used describe lasagne again noodles   ate last night December 2017 ordered much anticipated lasagne  pasta good home   Adding insult injury fact first two layers simply layer lasagne noodle top another lasagne noodle no sauce meat nor cheese between just doubly thick layer dense pasta   sauce meat cheese tastes all delicious remembered but pasta nope   something changed between then now?  If please change back!  Your lasagne ephemeral delicious   Service wonderful thank Heidi   pleasant experience all around   Would love hear Fiammas if pasta recipe process changed past year  <EOR> Amazing wine selection hundreds bottles    The meatball very good   Salmon so    Over ambience service food good <EOR> Shocked favorable reviews  Cesar salad warm wilted mediocre  dressing   Seabass overlooked bit fishy side  Pasta odd combination ingrediants  Salmon better other dishes  Once again odd combination fava beans sundried tomatoes prosciutto overripe fresh tomatoes  Nothing tasty memorable here  Could recommend  <EOR> I'd give 3 5  Food fairly average Italian service friendly but slow atmosphere great drinks amazing price terrible as far restaurants Strip could considered high casual pricing    Blueberry Crush cocktail  $11  YUM! Mezzaluna  $22  Decent but definitely OMG worthy  Creme brulee  $10  Good   Our server very nice but didn't see often  kid pouring water most 17 years old  He kept coming over pouring water while gazing straight ahead into hotel  imagine resulted water splashing half full glasses  Eh do? provided little entertainment!   I probably won't recommend back again unless looking cheap sit down dinner before another show Garden Arena   or another Blueberry Crush  <EOR> Be aware wine dates scam restaurant   Reading through other comments its clear restaurant engaged misrepresenting false claims wine drinks   While attending dinner last Saturday told restaurant 3 wine specials menu Ok     supposedly $200 300 BUT TODAY BETWEEN $100 150 ordered 2013 Gaja Ca' Marcanda Promis $127 listed menu   Having fun dinner salty pasta saggy salads took left over bottle back room discover next day 2013 2015!

The atmosphere restaurant nice   overly formal but casual either   also noisy your company definitely conversations without needing scream into each other's ears   The wine selection pretty wide   true culture focus mostly Italian wines all which delicious ones tried least  Should definitely check sparkling wines dessert wines if your pocketbook afford it  The food nothing short AMAZING!  Even something simple cold cuts cheese enough impress me   ingredients fresh unique nothing you'd normally find typical grocery market   think marinated olives many other foods themselves flavors you're getting place definitely something find just anywhere else!  I tried 2 3 different types pasta location loved each them   chefs pair special sauces different types pasta each sauce focusing reduction various alcohols brandy vodka   Anyone pasta sauce but where actually taste feel all flavors ingredients appreciate way complements pasta rare   place definitely inspired experiment more creative pasta sauces future!

Originally ordered 4 course meal but quickly back more ended 6 course meal  worth every penny  Everything fresh made order perfect temperature perfectly seasoned  else say place but its just PERFECT!! many restaurants try Vegas would hard time going back  Highly recommended disappointed  <EOR> Did bar snacks which reasonable good  Wine unbeilevably expensive glass Chianti $18  Wife's Martiine 14 + 3 + 2 for ever charge was  Others ravioli lasagna also good  Excellent service good ambiance but would back again due wine costs  <EOR> Came over weekend girl friends great restaurant choice   We decided just split food all try bit each   We started calamari carpaccio  Both very yummy especially carpaccio am definitely fan! Next lobster gnocchi short rib ravioli  think both quite unique  Never lobster gnocchi before even though seems enough food all quite full  <EOR> My group incredibly odd experience dining Fiamma several months ago sommelier  requested bottle wine under $80  She comes back $150+ bottle passes off $80 bottle then final check see actual amount  sure if she pegged group wouldn't notice wouldn't care based paying but outrageous  Thankfully management handled but wonder else she's pulled trick on?  THE OVERVIEW  + Flexibility waitstaff add more chairs table busy night + Well stocked bar without long wait stiff drinks poured all around + Ample portion sizes price excess everything Vegas isn't it Biggest issue still sommelier bit although waiter kind enough take care us  It good meal but wine issue left bitter taste mouth  <EOR> Circumstances taken Vegas once month last four months  No circumstances include gambling addiction  Anyway last two times stayed MGM Grand ate Fiamma  Overall great dining experience both times  Great ambiance great food great service  Reasonable prices too  sure I'd special trip eat if wasn't staying near MGM but numerous restaurants hotel standout  Also far more vegetarian friendly  <EOR> I wish could give main lobster gnocchi more five stars  beyond amazing  gnocchi light fluffy way less dense standard gnocchi  Best gnocchi ever eaten am gnocchi connoisseur order everywhere     wine wonderful  complementary  bread served sun dried tomato butter also great  wish hadn't stuffed face much bread could actually finished amazing pasta  back place near future sure  <EOR> If takes hour food off season 6 30 when restaurant packed only imagine long would take food regular busy time    The best part when food arrived talking manager telling hour later two basket breads into dinner am no longer hungry instead being apologetic offering something nice she decided take food back kitchen because said am no longer hungry! call superb customer service ensure would come back least know good food missed on! <EOR> We passed gem few times thinking trendy    Finally dinner last Saturday night pleasantly surprised   Reasonable prices for Vegas very good food presentation    We split most things hungry waistaff very accomodating  avoided truffle additions huge fans  However did short rib truffle ravioli OMG LOVED THEM!!! just perfect    We also enjoyed meal lake trout grilled then finale chocolate cakes  <EOR> One best meals ever Vegas   Everything done perfection especially lobster gnocci braised shortrib ravioli   drinks delicious service attentive   space beautiful large dark   made sad NY location closed  <EOR> My husband said chardonnay cheapest menu $16 best house wine he's ever had  Everyone loved lobster gnocchi again husband said best meal he's eaten Vegas come every year  lobster pieces huge ton sauce gnocchi melts your mouth    I truffle pea pasta special which incredible  caprese salad really impressive delicious  pinneapple upside down martini tasted cake  Bread basket nice  Service wonderful  seriously debated going back next night repeat dinner  <EOR> The short rib Fiamma brasato amazing    I'm usually person orders something different even though she already knows she liked past but sticking brasato  meat tender amazing sauce covers delicious roasted veggies   The decor great but besides plate fireplaces can't remember much else place dining partners nor ate before entree  think  good thing  <EOR> I linguine shrimp cream sauce  So  Good  forget menu description now but crispy shallots something tossed pasta  Usually when think cream sauce think amorphous mass rich heavy heart disease first bite pleasant surprise  discovering joy crunchy hamburger buns 'n Out    I'm brokeass college student generally frowns paying upwards $20 small plate pasta  good sweet spot between stuff your face madness Vegas buffets expensive restaurant  still hurts day losing blackjack but hurts good  Service prompt helpful something seems rare Vegas unless you're paying hundreds dollars    As dessert extent cake eating stops cheap chinese bakeries sheng kee represent!
