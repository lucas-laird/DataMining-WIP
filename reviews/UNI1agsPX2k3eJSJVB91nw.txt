Nah  because seafood  decision  Most may care but people would want know if they're going chow down shrimp crawdads   You would surprised many seafood places downgraded but don't often read closures  Anyways   if want still eat idea may solve things  Watch restaurant reports reinspections because would fixed all problems  think  best cases if want eat but you're still worried   ==================================================  Original update I loved food when ate but kinda ruined because old news alert put Channel 13 action news back 2009  just discovered today researching art festival First Friday   I conflicted  updating rating because such old news but knew would wanted know anyways if perusing Yelp others could informed decision own   I downgraded rating A OK which 3 stars  bad good  more interested being neutral place letting decide yourself   I bad experience July  owner addressed problems August satisfaction  Then November C rating Health Department   If google Vegas channel 13 news website segment called Dirty Dining find run article Hot N Juicy  Crawfish many health district violations time wrote reviews     The News channel aquired records health inspection which archived PUBLIC records  publish them community service            I think commendable he fixed problems listed report  Just he fixed problems experienced when bad time there  admit little freaked problems when eating but oh well  never sick!  So final verdict 1 food tasted great!  2 They've kept rating since 1 time downgrade C Nov 2009 health department   GOOD! They're most likely safe eat you'll wonderful time! never happened again believe people habits change   3 reading reviews service still seems inconsistent norm   It's just PERSONAL decision eat any more because can't past violations head reading report but  just ME   I'm lookout new place try when cravings messy seafood  Any suggestions? <EOR> First timers  We really enjoyed meal calamari fried catfish snow crab legs mild seasoning garlic butter  Food served super hot  Come prepared messy if order crab served plastic bag comes nut cracker pick paper towels  Towelettes served after  <EOR> I'm MOBILE ALABAMA    nothing spicing fresh crawfishes   I love Crawfish!!!!

Know before go no plates  served all your food plastic bags to hold juices right your table which covered paper supplied plastic gloves roll napkins  also given bib wear you'll need it!!! messy time consuming meal for infrequent crawfish eater but once over getting down dirty dinner well worth it!! <EOR> I've several times never bad experience   love coming getting two pounds shrimp   1 hot 1 extra spicy   food good add sausage corn too     If peel eat shrimp then place must   priced well too <EOR> Loved hot juicy sauce  Hated Louisiana sauce basically no flavor  Don't crawfish when waitress warns small soft shelled   Enjoy! <EOR> Need spicy kick over your hangover? well place! outta all Cajun southern places think fav  Right when walked into restaurant aroma homey seafood spices lingers right into nostrils music ears   Got seated ordered usual craw fish shrimp sweet potato fries but thing really enjoyed deep fried catfish fries mm mmm good salty crispy fish meat middle  Towards end gruesome shell tearing lies shrimp crawfish graveyard table  poured some corona in mouth sea critter homies RIP delicious bunch <EOR> Horrible customer service  asked waitress if could refill soda she just walked away   Very expensive very little food   grab some McDonald's left   Smh  no plates no forks spoons etc <EOR> Love place!

What's point going eat if watch other person eat while wait? Alexis should've explained this  Melody wears sunflower pendent took over while Alexis lunch extremely nice accommodating  Maybe more servers need staff severs aren't overwhelmed provide excellent service  other restaurants town comparable should sure stick more rest  <EOR> I've planning visit Vegas family did little yelping before  long drive really excited try place until sneakily ripped off  pretty late just looking small snack decent price   I specifically ordered 2 pounds frozen crawfish which priced $7 99 pound  should come $16 00 pre tax but when bill $25 00+  asked waitress bill she said ran frozen crawfish  asked if they're supposed let customers know ran something she said yes  Confused why she didn't tell us? Every crawfish place tells customers if run something  Aside crawfish actually pretty good sauce tasty   I also ordered fried catfish which supposed $7 99 but charged $10 99  When ordered she asked kind fries wanted implying fries included  even asked if included? She didn't say anything    Other catfish fries good came hot which nice   The food good but disappointed service  Didn't catch name waitress but  irrelevant because won't back  She didn't try all anything situation  tired dishonest employees    <EOR> A vegas must!!

But catfish didn't taste very good all crab legs okay but extremely overpriced good reason  Anyway if craving crawfish again Vegas time wait seat I'd back but I'd only order crawfish nothing else  <EOR> After seeing Adam Richman eating crawfish Man Vs Food made sure place must visit while Las Vegas I feel kind left giving only 2 stars place where mostly 5 star reviews place  Maybe experience fluke?

Alas where turn down Creepy Drive   locking door hanging Disturb sign drawing blinds stripped down skivvies feasted     There something quite liberating simultaneously shaming eating dinner your underwear   However satisfaction received gorging delicious shellfish washed away any lingering feelings penitence   Will back hopefully friends if take is! <EOR> Heard best crawfish joint chinatown naturally come give try what's weird two locations really close each other just didn't know which would taste better decided location  prepared come smelling just ate uber driver noticed but he said he loved smell lol wonder everyone else though walked stripped meal   I ordered 1lb blue crab 1 lb crawfish dozen oyster shooters hot n juicy style mild  prices crazy cheaper places rockin' crawfish hang ten boiler bay area surprisingly tasted way better funny better crawfish dessert back home   flavor sauce amazing chunks minced garlic amazing flavor cajun spices hint sweetness just wish gave more sauce your food   The Blue crab crazy cheap lucked 3 female crabs eggs YUM! little under cooked but cooked enough meat little mushy  If order blue crab prepared really your hands dirty give whole crab pry head off which don't mind every time eat crawfish spots don't use gloves fingers end smelling week haha   crawfish perfectly boiled tail came perfectly highlight meal  Oyster bit disappointing really large size no flavor oyster juices  tasted pried oysters open then rinsed water   The staff just amazing really efficient roles  server attentive checked regularly  She made sure keep know meal she said order come cook crab come last take while cook when drinks running low she would swoop refill beverage    Highly recommended spot if you're Vegas <EOR> Really good stuff everything tasted fresh spicy name menu suggests reasonable portions amount pay  1lb crawfish 1lb shrimp 1lb clams retrospect would say 2 5 lbs instead 3lbs would better choice extremely full this  If crawfish then ahead order if never fence would refrain because a its much harder eat other items b somewhat small spend lot time little meat   I am docking star because garlic overpower times surprisingly lasts 10 hours eat your breath constantly taste even brushing your teeth  Wake morning might burping garlic flavors  few different flavors everything spicy hot but all mixes tastes pretty much same  <EOR> Are Hot Juicy person Boiling Crab person? question!   I am currently Team Hot Juicy    Making sure don't come often use allows look forward coming back  garlic smell lingers 24 hours your mouth nails tend steer away coming  But other place amazing    The flavors just pop mouth love it  usually shrimp hot juicy medium  side rice Cajun fries extra butter  usually sauce shrimp put butter use extra dipping sauce  bomb! drink spicy butter all day! very UNHEALTHY but hey YOLO right?   The staff pretty Attentive another location opening its busy used before  location does limited parking space though which cause some trouble me    And some reason raspberry ice tea amazing  probably just regular ol' raspberry ice tea usually everywhere but think all spices raspberry ice tea just compliments everything lol! <EOR> Fun place try out  found shrimp lot better crawfish  just don't enough meat crawfish  Overall food wasn't really cup tea  <EOR> Okay review may little biased because comparing Hot Juicy experience Boiling Crab California but really    Hot Juicy?  HOT JUICY!  My friend recommended place because cousin saw Food Network   want Food Network tell them SUCK should retract special Hot Juicy should special Boiling Crab instead   Okay maybe harsh  all ordered shrimp Medium Hot Juicy Special sauce   BC see garlic pepper deep red sauce bag   Also Medium Whole Shabang spicy taste lingers    expecting   Instead shrimp H J came super bland spicy juicy all   squish shrimp around barely sauce any flavor all  ask limes salt pepper   took forever limes us   if buy limes cut them just us  can't draw walls   wack that? Haha     The staff friendly venue clean but just didn't live expectations   sorry H J     2 stars cuz Meh   definitely experienced better  <EOR> What fun unique place eat!  great time definitely want return next time travel Vegas   8pm Friday night didn't wait table   waitress very attentive helpful   She recommended favs gave great suggestions  The four ordered 3 lbs  shrimp 1 lb  king crab legs lobster which 1 5 lbs  4 corns   all liked shrimp best found very fun peel shells off   also all liked hot n juicy sauce best which mixture  all sauces   medium spicy level more enough!  recommend dipping your seafood into sauce peel its shell!  YUM! I minused star because dungeness crab also shorted 1 corn lobster took very very long come I think accidentally forgot until reminded them   But great dinner great experience also very affordable! <EOR> Omg place awsome much better boiling crab  waitresses smoking hot good god almighty  <EOR> I haven't hot juicy awhile no issues them past when brother came visit figured would order some crawfish since he craving it  Much surprise very disappointed  total ordered 6 lbs crawfish good quality all  Much crawfish seemed dead awhile shell texture very mushy  talking dead few days  addition shells crawfish very discolored  Crawfish suppose red shells sometimes dark when boil them but shells dark almost black  Additionally feel getting little cheated  When looked menu there's distinction pricing regular crawfish frozen crawfish  believe regular crawfish $11 99 per lb  frozen $9 99 per lb  definitely frozen crawfish still charged $11 99 per lb  only reason why gave place two stars because its sauce  good give credit when due  If really want crawfish highly recommend buffet orleans hotel casino  some really big crawfish $20 dinner but all eat there's other food buffet prime rib well! eat now on  <EOR> I finally try original Hot N Juicy Crawfish during recent trip Vegas last week!  After getting dropped off cab Boiling Crab finding crawfish !!! group 9 literally walked mile Hot N Juicy   split orders into 2 group ordered 10 pounds crawfish hot Hot N Juicy special 2 pounds shrimp hot garlic butter 1 pound snow crab legs hot Hot N Juicy special  EVERYTHING flavorful tender juicy   definitely more hot expected I'm used hot DC which wasn't bad thing all   Although messed order shrimp they gave Hot N Juicy special instead garlic butter server very unaccomodating towards mistake She asked us sure  wrong one? repeatedly having ask things salt pepper limes gloves cleaning buckets etc  spilling juices back while cleaning  everything else smooth   could understand really busy serving group 9 might challenging especially because all different drink orders requests   This definitely must try if you're Vegas love seafood! <EOR> No Plates no silverware  love Crawfish way hot spicy  Hot N Juicy Twice enjoyed meal both times  dinner great beer    Always corn potato meal    Greg <EOR> I've Hot N Juicy many times each time left satisfied most part location newer east road    The shrimp crawfish fairly priced delicious hot n juicy sauce  BUT advised if comparing spiciness boiling crab   this place SPICIER  Example medium signature hot n juicy sauce spicier scale medium house sauce boiling crab couple years consistently  The service okay  good service great service past  time around bit confusing  MLK Monday afternoon around 3 4pm   greeted front told wait giving name Party then greeted again where host asked name party size again  she walked away another person asked if being helped  _ [STORY During dinner main hostess seated also took drink orders   then man name tag said lead waiter asked same thing  Ended ordering food getting food her  He checked regularly refilled waters couple times  Ordered salt pepper she forgot twice   and brought asking man    The table next complained having bibs being offered gloves having utensils rice needing things quicker]  I think place definitely good    The restrooms become cleaner but should checked more routinely soap  Service down but came training day little communication between waiters waitresses would helpful   and annoy less customers <EOR> This place legit  Awesome crab legs shrimp crawfish  Everything spicy delicious  Yum  Great service  Another hidden gem Vegas  dirty but worth it <EOR> Costumer service worst!!

Styrofoam cups  Styrofoam bowls  Plastic bags  Paper napkins  Plastic table cloth    Things note if just your nails did craving your seafood boil fix never fear  Ask plastic gloves  mom brings own dishwashing gloves crawfish boils but provide some plastic ones upon request    Took Yelper advice half pound shrimp  Shrimp slightly overcooked  peel dunk around sauce more flavor it! Sauces nice    We also fried cajun calamari really good    just generic fried frozen calamari overly tough  Don't that   Crawfish itself season now expectation management always important  likely inform frozen  pound won't very far though     Some girls working tell mild actually medium most people but would disagree  Mild tastes mild just minor punch it   Service great  girls working all very sweet nice   For calamari half pound shrimp pound crawfish half order sausage two potatoes Diet Coke total $33 before tip  exactly cheap frozen seafood  fun experience locals no where else turn seafood boil but little price heavy side  <EOR> Best crawfish town but just wish cleaned shrimp because vein still them  <EOR> They craw fish hour opening!!

How's quality? Stop being negative! might say   I am guilty watching Man Vs Food majority all yelp reviews restaurant  Normally MVF's track record fairly poor but different! doesn't Asian flavors crossed Cajun style?  saying don't Amerie so hot! Hines Ward not hot   ordered 1 lb Shrimp 1lb Crawfish give Crawfish try shrimp back both Hot n Juicy style    The shrimp great course although slightly under cooked  think  because maybe no ever orders shrimp  nice big size almost Jumbo shrimp sized tasted pretty good Hot N Juicy sauce but nothing jump your seat over  Shrimp dollar more crawfish but its worth because 95% meat 5% shell  Time first taste crawfish! first honestly did know eat it  tried using shrimp peeling skills but looked squirrel trying nut  finally swallowed pride asked pretty waitress help show suck head  your mind gutter!!! Ha ha   but  suppose eat crawfish  first suck head  she said that's she said then eat meat  Hmmm   Good thing review PG  flavor juicy coming crawfish lot better shrimp! taste very delicious  sipping hot bowl pho some zesty tomato based Italian dish  Maybe  bad analogy  Let's say restaurant smelled tasted cross between Vietnamese Chinese restaurant Cajun grill    If look around restaurant see nothing but people smiles faces  unusually because most restaurants most people look impatient serious  definitely plus! rating might tad bit harsh but feel truly honest  recommend give Hot N Juicy try only if early don't mind driving Chinatown didn't see many Chinese places mostly Vietnamese restaurants but all Asians look right? Don't answer that   If Orange County spoiled Boiling Crab other restaurants warned may place  less spicy little less flavor  If Asian Cajun newbie great start you  back again friends watched Man Vs Food but fan great head no meat no pun intended  <EOR> Food service great kitchen could use help though  forgot 3 items however flavors great if love spicy garlic place be!!! <EOR> Being HUGE fan Boiling Crab only natural try place out  ordered 2 lbs shrimp corn mild spices I'm big pansy when comes spicy foods garlic butter seasoning DELICIOUS  2 lbs between three just right amount mild right amount spice me  Maybe next time more ballsy try medium  Thankfully relatively early around 5 pm only wait few minutes  great experience definitely does hurt beer cheap too! <EOR> The hot juicy sauce amazing! place super messy but super good! wouldn't good first date but definitely good second date <EOR> Yummmmm crawfish!

two isn't insane wait Boiling Crab always seems which great HNJC   four ordered Sweet Potato Fries $4 25 long slender deep fried sweet potatoes came ketchup side    Ok but don't sweet potatoes much

DELICIOUS!  weren't big them but cooked perfectly seasoning amazing     After finished eating bit startled when bill   $10 99 per pound crawfish??  Supermarkets Dallas sell crawfish less $2 pound!  guess factor cost shipping fresh crawfish Louisiana all way Las Vegas Nevada which apparently EVERY day     Is best crawfish ever had?  I'd say par Boiling Crab which favorite crawfish place Dallas   only $4 99 pound there!   However if you're Vegas there's whole lot alternatives   If love fresh crawfish place go    Pros fresh crawfish garlic butter seasoning delicious  Cons $10 99 pound!  Always busy expect long wait time <EOR> We've coming ever since opened know before uber popular because Man vs  Food before hour wait seated     We'd only ones restaurant those days long gone     Plain simple food good  Crawfish shrimp garlic butter less mild 2 sides rice    OK love garlic but there's abundance food  If you're fan garlic going  particular sauce    The taste smell food pretty strong thanks massive amounts garlic smell seafood garlic couple days eat here    No matter many times shower no matter many times tried rid smell just would away  if you've some where smell garlic seafood appealing people around suggest come back another day because no joke smell STICKS days I'm doing laundry today 2 days later purse clothes still smell garlic <EOR> Put bib prepare mess your table covered disposable plastic   Hot N Juicy delivers delicious bags crawfish crab shrimp sausage other creole favorites    I tried garlic butter crawfish which pretty good lemon pepper shrimp which also good   Side corn delicious packed flavor sausage good soaked sauce   The seafood general average    shrimp little overcooked but still very tasty  did seem really fresh perhaps frozen  sauce good completes meal     The service little slow sure your drink full your food arrives may stuck hot mouth!

When Robyn heard   Eww!  Robyn's recommendation Order pound Blue Crab Legs pound Shrimp   Kevin Kathy's my daughter suggestion Crawfish Shrimp   My suggestion Crawfish Shrimp combo    I'd Shrimp Shrimp     Suggestions sides Bread Rolls Potatoes Sausages OK  Corn Cob which boiled along Crawfish literally turns into Cream Corn way soft   And    don't Breathe Eat same time! Took few minutes recover HEAT going down! Kevin tried some Spicy Crawfish subsequently devloped heat reaction blotches red all over face neck  think most Spicy hot enough   Robyn totally shocked when gave Hot 'n Juicy Yelper rating 5 Stars despite fact can't avoid getting Messy despite scrubbing down virtually all Soap restroom afterwards returning home probably needing Bath Shower    can't help but pretty good time!  I can't think more enjoyable time spend couple hours people watching customers your dinner companions getting down n' dirty Crawfish just lower your own clean freak inhibitions   I wondering why restaurant located un officially designated Chinatown along Spring Mountain    far could see evening only waitress Asian descent    queried waitress whether Hot 'n Juicy Asian owned she replied owner Thai resided Texas second Crawfish place he owned   Highly recommended abhors using dainty fingers       I last thought though     exactly chemical reaction flash boiling Plastic Bag? any chemical breakdowns Plastic Bag USDA should worried about? <EOR> Crawfish Catfish Calamari all other good stuff   Something sauce place stand above all rest   Really good food   Only thing would suggest wear any light colored clothing  <EOR> We every time Vegas at least once year     both favourite visitors myself locals family  shrimp juicy tender  think only paid 11 99 pound  careful sauce  the garlic very strong if aren't used sauce super spicy   I case you're spicy loving eater   service always great white rice side must!! Just fyi refused call cab back strip because said many people call cab ditch cab  result cab companies blocked business  use your own phone which isn't great because long distance me  waited ten minutes instead eventually took cab back strip just dropped off some diners restaurant  Good thing lucky because far walk back strip! <EOR> So yummy! Order hot N juicy spicy take perfect! 1 pound shrimp bowl rice  Took 30 mins back home everything still great! Service super nice too! spicy pretty spicy!!

Overall definitely recommend place anyone! never ate another location can't speak others  prefer because original  However another right down street   Plenty parking area no waiting always correct order provide gloves I never use them if prefer down dirty  <EOR> Got Spicy Crawfish Hot n Juicy style 2 pounds     Loved much flavor cant wait back try crab legs shrimp  <EOR> After reading some Yelp reviews really iffy going here  first time coming boyfriend man hungry   First foremost! Order TWO pounds Crawfish  If order you'll really sad  were  Let crustaceans sit juices while! You'll really sad if don't! sure stick mild if spice but much!

I never boil style place before gotta say awesome! food great 4 stars but service earned extra fifth! If food adventure Vegas it!  I 7 Saturday let say place packed would definitely more strategic next time!  But despite being run ragged whole staff friendly helpful attentive! told would 20 minutes table when 15 quite happy!  Timothy server amazing   Despite obviously having lot plate he took time really depth all questions when he found first time  He even put pair gloves when food gave step step demolish respective crustaceans!   Checked many times made sure glasses full gave quite few valuable honest opinions    wish could Timothy every resturaunt!  The food!  DELICIOUS   Timothy's suggestion hot n juicy sauce crawfish lemon pepper king crab shrimp  Definitely right choices!  crawfish crab mild level spicy spice!  definitely right heat   partner less mild which secret lowest spice level sensitive palate perfect!    Order variety crawfish fun but filling    king crab great but pricey next time stick regular crab     If don't them throw corn cob each bag cheating yourself some best corn ever had   sauces amazing definitely recommend asking your server pairs best each seafood    hot n juicy awesome but definitely spicier even t same heat level   If open HnJ northern Cali hope staff considers moving here!

The ONLY repeat ONLY food take time carefully work eat shellfish   specifically crab lobster crawfish  Unfortunately being located Tri State area lack crawfish which saddens me  Since town work jumped opportunity eat favorite shellfish friends   crawfish!  After leaving CES convention center colleagues hailed taxi* requested Hot N Juicy located Chinatown  split second later realized Hot N Juicy sounded strip club joked around taxi driver insisted wasn't peep show  going ate   My colleagues didn't know but giggling little school girl when arrived  Unfortunately them aren't adventurous when comes food ordered calamari chicken wings fries which enjoyed   Our waiter extremely informative briefly describing mostly order seafood per pound seasoning spiciness  Since Boiling Crab already knew wanted   2 lbs garlic butter crawfish medium heat  garlic butter seasoning mouth wateringly good could drink side not recommended though   serve seafood plastic bags bibs paper towels  messiest meal ever eat but worth it  business attire but able leave without any stains!  As twisted separated head tail sucked head pushed meat tail   my colleagues looked complete disgust monster  Did feel bad? all  easily finished 2 lbs crawfish true fatty  ordered medium heat but mouth fire pretty much entire time eating counteract heat took big swigs beer which helped    The seafood pricing menu says market price sure ask waiter beforehand  crawfish $10 per pound  Currently they're having BOGO shrimp special because opened another Hot N Juicy location Washington DC  hear road trip?

The food relatively cheap around $10 per pound each type seafood   shrimp crawfish wish would tried Dungeness crab sounded really good     If you're looking fun meal grab friends definitely try Hot n Juicy Crawfish   But since place Man v  Food may take little while wait your reservation maybe try during off hours  <EOR> We always pick place enjoying crawfish seafood rather boiling crab  good selection seafood reasonable price come notice if just frozen things available menu  good service good food but still spiciness isn't spicy way expected  <EOR> i wanted try place because saw some tv shows man vs food  hands down favorite crawfish place ever  spices point crawfish themselves lived name hot very juicey  live san jose ca where few crawfish places but place takes cake me  wait really short packed but only took 10 15 mins seated which san jose if u try boiling crab take hours! all all if you're ever vegas area craving some crawfish definitely try place out! wish closer where lived = <EOR> what happens when can't find sitter night hot n juicy friend sweats buckets when eating spicy food? hot n juicy GO!! lol  i boiling crab called ask if HnJ could same  yes! called asked if blue crab    yes! awesome    calling order easy  well   kinda  loud restaurant phone providing crappy service  end   order placed for 3 lbs blue crab 2 crab per pound HnJ special medium spicy 1 lb blue crab garlic butter mild  1 lb shrimp HnJ special medium spicy add 1 corn sausage 1 lb crawfish HnJ special medium spicy  add 1 corn  they forgot corn so since 2008    gonna say definitely raised bar spice levels  reading old review   wishing spicy more spicy  all friends agreed medium spicy level enough  felt little better knowing wasn't just suffering  lol  the flavors amazing always  maybe taking having food steam bags little longer ordering dine made difference  although    shrimp little mushy    hope wasn't because go   hope quality shrimp downgraded    i thought nice person took phone order call back ask if wanted lemons order  calling check if real order  haha    one thing better boiling crab give large piece butcher paper use restaurant your order  HnJ use plastic garbage bags cut  cleaning plastic bag table cloth little more challenging  <EOR> Don't come prepared eating fancy meal! tables covered plastic table cloth roll paper towels your hands  given plastic bib gloves if want them food comes plastic bags boiled in   My husband ordered 1 pound mussels 1 pound shrimp 2 pieces corn 4 potatoes Hot Juicy mild seasoning  seasoning perfect amount spice could still taste enjoy food  shrimp very flavorful few mushy texture  mussels amazing   The wait staff did good job making sure soda tea kept full seeing if wanted order anything else   The bad    GARLIC! walked being able keep vampires away least next 24 hours  enjoy  garlic but little over powering  can't imagine if would ordered lemon garlic spice   Over all    food good but nothing spectacular  would eat again but won't rush back  <EOR> Se amate crostacei salsa piccante questo è il posto che fa per voi! Aragoste giganti servite intere e tonnellate di gamberi vengono serviti sacchetti di plastica trasparenti pieni di salsa piccante con gradazioni da Mild Extreme che vanno mangiati rigorosamente con le mani  Non esistono piatti e posate quindi se non amate sporcarvi le mani non avvicinatevi nemmeno  Purtroppo l'aspetto negativo è che poi uscendo dal ristorante rimane sui vestiti e non solo una tremenda puzza di aglio     Dopotutto però ne vale la pena! <EOR> This place GOOD!

P S  also sell waitress calendar almost Hooters except didn't show much skin  <EOR> I'd give 3 5 stars if could   Lots comments already Hot 'n Juicy just some observations recommendations newbies might want avoid crawfish  enough meat justify price  Ordered once never again  Why don't serve nice bread sop intensely flavorful sauce beyond comprehension  Shrimp jumbo sized good option first timers  Wish would serve better quality rice side dish  Prices bit steep particular catfish basket calamari  Doesn't feel good value such simple deep fried items    Overall enjoyable messy experience  <EOR> WAS favorite  Til thursday 5 24   I husband around 7pm because Chinatown hour wait  haven't gave try  usual food great  Your Feet Wet plus side Sweet Potato Cajun fries  great until chew crawfish tasted sand dirty water  Since hungry didn't mind first  few more things left food husband started having tummy ache  thought just over eating honestly  When home he started having diarrhea throwing up  gave couple minutes see if just really over ate but following day threw again also diarrhea  husband both very nauseous 3 straight days   We're giving 2 stars great service while dining  But giving 3 need focus more making sure clean food thoroughly before actually cook no other customers food poisoned us  eat anymore  <EOR> I've many Boiling Crabs across CA anticipating lot Hot N Juicy  ordered 1 2 lb shrimp 1 2 dozen sausage corn cajun fries tried some friends' oysters crawfish  Mild Hot N Juicy seasoning    Firstly prices little steeper BC maybe $1 2 higher  Dived into food few bites mouth FIRE  Seriously  Mild lowest spice setting stop eating few times because mouth suffering  sweats Corona water didn't help stomach even hurt bit  might call weak maybe am but order Mild BC no problem finishing Whole Shabang there    It spicy could barely taste seasoning  corn mushy soggy  sausages good but still same level insane heat  Oysters bigger I'd prefer mine small sweet    Overall most memorable part meal sausages saltine oyster horseradish cocktail sauce combo  Boiling Crab over Hot N Juicy any day  <EOR> My girlfriend stopped place last week mainly because saw restaurant featured Man vs  Food because great reviews gets Yelp  Sadly let down Adam Richman all fellow Yelpers   Shortly seated waitress warned Hot N Juicy's spice levels much higher your typical restaurant advised lower spicy level when ordered shrimp  Taking advice milder sauce  noticed lot things wrong when shrimp absolutely no juice bag  similar restaurants where shrimp crawdads served juice give added flavor  Considering restaurant called Hot N Juicy both expecting JUICY  shrimp absolutely no flavor them  literally tasted boiled bag shrimp water served us  Again considering restaurant called Hot N Juicy both expecting HOT   We asked hotter sauce side dip shrimp since let down sauce ordered  waitress kind enough come back small container Hot N Juicy sauce  also very subpar tasted blend marinara sauce hint Tabasco  Again sauce spicy all  think its important note girlfriend aren't huge fans spicy food  When order wings shrimp tend medium level spiciness due own sensitivities spicy food  being said nothing restaurant that tried even remotely spicy   We also ordered side calamari  ok but considering price order worth it    The only saving grace restaurant ambiance decor  restaurant itself cool modern look very well air conditioned which big thing plays good music  would come buy beer but would stay hell away food  <EOR> So just flew into Vegas tonight pretty much headed straight checking into hotel  say fiending  While little skeptical reading some reviews loyal Boiling Crab fans because honestly doesn't love BC decided give shot  let reiterate both Boiling Crab Hot n Juicy each pros cons  personally think stack pretty well and reviewed both    Pros Hot n Juicy 1  Wait time less 10 minutes table 2  slow night them Monday around 8ish but enough space sit while waiting  While waiting C searched wall Polaroids Adam Richman's   of course he own frame   2  Wait staff friendly  server Amanda excellent  She checked frequently let know kitchen closing asked if wanted any more food before then  kind cooled down little we last leave she came over talked bonded over dogs  think wait staff WAY nicer BC's  say hi soon walk door   and smile  Who'd thought   3  Price pretty good  reading previous reviews decided skip crawfish 2 pounds shrimp version BC's whole shabang sauce sausage which bigger sweet potato fries 2 beers piece total less $45  saw complaints shrimp being overcooked but ours done perfectly   4  full bar    Cons Hot N Juicy 1  parking lot tiny   fits maybe 20 cars  park lot across side street walk over   2  Restaurant lot smaller BC  If super busy night might take bit longer seated   main reason tonight instead Saturday   3  walk smelling crap  But   you would BC too  guess  much con   In terms food   the level same although say and hope sense while H J little bit spicier BC more flavor it  friend both liked sweet potato fries better BC  size sausage har har har bigger H J  Beer prices same which huge plus  really can't $3 Corona  Both places TVs which time playing Lakers game   If town again would probably end going back  no BC but fills void   I'd give 3 3 4 stars but round because nice  <EOR> I haven't while  Took friend dinner  remember them serving great flavors shrimps crawfish's past  time though shrimps seems little undercooked  <EOR> Smelly gross   Cheap seafood powdered seasonings served plastic bags   Friggin disgusting   Really   Salty!!!!  Ugh   made sick   Crappy shellfish boiled salty water   Disgusting   garlic fingers coming pours week   worst restaurants ever  <EOR> Great service seafood  Love King crab legs   Hot juicy sauce right amount heat  <EOR> After passing place half dozen times laughing name saw recommended Fodor's quickly Yelped see  indeed highly appreciated just two dollar signs seafood spot   Couldn't wait dee licious!    I pound snow crab legs hot juicy sauce   Normally would crawfish but season right now just frozen available   Thankfully server given heads spicy notch two above most other places mild lips burning first bite   let little thing slow down   order corn red bliss potatoes piece each also absorbed awesome hot spicy flavor sauce   The weak link restaurant servers   Supposedly every server yours just one   But found meant asking several people same item before actually it   Happened twice requests more ketchup more water heard table next say same thing   Also original server placed order incorrectly which she acknowledged immediately then member party wait 10+ minutes food come while rest eating   since didn't own waitress nobody gave updates nobody let manager know kept having flag servers down find happening   definitely turned five star rating into four star rating  <EOR> I first tried place Christmas Eve let tell food delicious! shrimp muscles special sauce everything just fresh delicious  service also good  definitely going back! <EOR> This place Awesome!
