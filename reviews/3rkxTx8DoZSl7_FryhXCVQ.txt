One thing would recommend wonton soup   really doughy didnt really any filling it   Other then everything else tried great  <EOR> Update 04 14 2011 3 times last 8 days   Zha Jiang Mian favorite far  HeHe   Update 04 28 2011 If large group friends each order different dish you'll taste lot more Sichuan ness you'll probably end paying less lunch special  D <EOR> I really appreciate fact Jugoo opened 'hood serving sichuan cuisine   different ballgame cantonese cuisine but  appealing new many they also feature popular cantonese dishes those daring    favorite noodle dish order mixed noodles soybean paste   Noodles great bite them topped mixture ground meat vegetable   vegetables braised eggplant yellow soybean paste   If want try really unique dish hit sliced pork chili oil starter   cold app really takes mouth trip  <EOR> I Lamb daughter beef noodles everything just overly spicy overly seasoned aggressive noodles undercooked sauces junk better Chinese  people nice but place dead just good food <EOR> Went actually Aloha Kitchen Friend around 8pm last night noticed Jugoo right next door decided try something new  Walking place felt very warm very well simply decorated people amazing helping choose spicy boiled beef some seafood fried rice potstickers  presentation food beautiful tasted even better hope place new regular spot probably never going Panda again  <EOR> We ordered food waited 55 mins   People into restaurant later then food quicker us     When told them waiting hour just answer was   allright  don't know say sorry   Server did know english well she able answer questions regarding menu    We ordered hot tea which never while waiting 55 mins  <EOR> Yay ! ACTUAL REAL chinese food place nearby UNLV  Walk able distances next Aloha Kitchen ! just opened few days ago 4th April according owner worker there    Quick service  Nice Chinese mandarin speakers  food pretty good  Clean decent sized place  Food made pretty quickly  SLIGHT misunderstanding order table but fixed quickly fast !  Starting noodles  Friend ordered beef noodle dont remember exact name   bad  slight numbing would typical sichuan restaurants special combination spices use create numbing effect   Reason why said slight because kind slight  strong should but its good start  other noodle ordered Dan Dan Mein   decent  made slightly different ive used which dry noodle not soup which their's was thick sauce coating all noodles numbing spices  bad though    Next thing lunch special  $10 2 dishes your choice vegetable egg roll bowl rice  Portion quite large depending big eater could possibly share it  few dishes tried ranging cashew chicken beijing style pork twice cooked pork eggplant green bean   All pretty good   few mentioned probably liked eggplant most  Flavorful soft  Green bean could slightly better slightly underseasoned   well underseasoned but flavors weren't mixed evenly  cooked minced pork believe   pork salty but green bean slightly bland    One thing noticed overall dishes things ordered visit slightly salty side    Design restaurant simple overly decorated  Slight contemporary design    Overall pretty good place minor cons but would stop friends visiting again soon =] Legit reason ditching Panda Express ! Haha ! <EOR> Came lunch boyfriend since right next campus! Ordered zha jiang mian fell looveeee it  reason would probably because noodles  They're super soft very elastic chewy reminded hand pulled noodles had  boyfriend dan dan mian which quite tasty too! However being boyfriend Sichuan he said dan dan mian authentic tasting  doubt other items all authentic Sichuanese food but nonetheless all super super tasty!! Prices somewhat reasonable  two two bowls noodles came $20 tip  <EOR> A hidden little family owned restaurant close UNLV features spicy dishes!  Upon entering establishment noticed all patrons Asian    truly mark authenticity  interior clean cosy service efficient enough if lacking warmth   Unfortunately credit card machine wasn't working day which meant some scrounging find enough cash pay bill     We ordered spicy eggplant spicy tofu tofu fish dishes   All very tasty spicy but *too* spicy   could taste non spice elements easily   only criticism eggplant dish bit oily side but then again eggplants sponges veggie family soaking whatever come contact with!  I would definitely come again enjoy some yummy food quiet atmosphere close UNLV   *FYI Jugoo same little plaza Smashburger Maryland Parkway * <EOR> Although doesn't lot atmosphere food amazing inexpensive get   yang chow fried rice bomb!  There no toilet paper even paper towels ladies room would given 5 stars  <EOR> Brought non asian friend since he hasn't tried chinese food awhile really fan chinese food  asked spicy he's yup  which replied know exactly where we're going  Ever since day He fallen love Jugoo!

U won't regret nom nom     <EOR> Getting obsessed Sichuan food recently place authentic SPICY  Small uncrowded close In N Out cheaper Smashburger lunch  Infinitely better comparably priced Panda SU    I've twice now following Sichuan chopped chicken comes bed dried chilis great peppery  Chicken bit bony though  ostensibly signature definitely tastes great leaves your tongue pleasantly numb   Sichuan twice cooked pork Fantastic lunch special dish spicy all right ways   Eggplant spicy garlic sauce nearly hot above two dishes but amazingly savory visually stunning  Almost favorite dish but hard pick when everything good  <EOR> Jugoo Specials Hunan Chinese which means    be prepared Spicy food! The dishes are Beef Noodle Soup Tan Tan Noodles Mix Mix Beef Tendon plate Ma Po Tofu They some Chicken dish pretty awesome  but forget english name  its suppose signature dish  They don't really restaurant bay area LA   fancy but its all food good spicy food  <EOR> If considering veggie fried rice just swing your local supermarket buy onion instead    Also don't expect them put sweet sour sauce your take out bag if order egg rolls  won't  <EOR> Finally found Chinese restaurant isn't Chinatown I need under rock !   Szechuan spiced specialty pork belly lunch special grand larceny deal  Pricing generally falls between $ $$   Smaller restaurant doesn't seem busy it summer semester @ UNLV    Loved decor authenticity food!  I'll want keep eye spot told Jugoo previously under fire SNHD  <EOR> Maybe fact sick therefore am mood incompetence but find myself quite displeased place  ordered egg tomato noodle  received hot water sprinkle chicken broth noodles some tomatoes sprinkled inside oily fried  egg top  All costed $7 99  Just     No  <EOR> First visit Service good rough start but she warmed things fine   She gets extra points honesty    sweetness   Cucumbers Good   although China Mama's still lead     Potstickers meh  Eggplant Garlic Sauce good version   if only bit undercooked     Salt Pepper Shrimp potstickers duds order this   the batter isn't right under cooked    Pho Kim Long definitive version     Fresh Water Spinach delicious  Potato Stripes strips Yunnan Garden's best but great see menu near campus!

May try more time give better star rating <EOR> Jugoo's location right next UNLV most convenient place drop class when want Chinese  most likely see Maserati parked front  Just throwin' wealthy patron taste Chinese food but fact owner's fancy ride   Jugoo featured Dirty Dining  generally assume places clean act hit health department  and news  but place! While everything seems clean hygienic most recent visit discovered mold chili sauce  tiny plastic container kept table full mold  in plain view customers  Totally gross discovery  While food generally tasty rotten chili sauce health department pretty ridiculous   If they'll put moldy chili sauce table think food looks back? Reason why spoiled rich kids shouldn't run restaurants  would prefer food poisoning due someone's carelessness  thanks  <EOR> If Chinese food really someone needs alert all other restaurants hocking uber salty glazed heartburn inducing garbage   dried fish soup mustard spring rolls   soup way much enough least couple people   wasn't crazy spring rolls but soup more made it  <EOR> Why Panda Express popular UNLV Student Union?   The food Jugoo million times better prices comparable if order lunch special don't hang SU aka douche bag central     I ordered two item lunch special $9 99 hot tea which complimentary good quality   two item lot food offer one item $6 99 if you're hungry   lunch specials served bowl white rice spring roll   spring roll good next time tell them give lunch special because actually takes away rest meal     With lunch special dry cooked beef leeks spicy garlic eggplant   Both dishes perfect   said place million times better Panda Express cook food order instead slopping plate trough   dry cooked beef stir fried tender cuts beef served pleasantly peppery gravy   spicy garlic eggplant just name sounds pretty spicy definitely garlicky tossed mildly sweet sauce  I highly recommend both options   I wish wasn't dining solo outing Jugoo because everything menu sounded great would've nice share other items some other people   There's always next time  <EOR> Living east side town come absolutely adore Chinese Restaurant    It's hard find authentic chinese food around college area where average college student thinks authentic chinese food Panda  slightly disheartening because really isn't enough traffic through deserves    The owner really nice wouldn't necessarily say waitress friendliest  She speaks engrish real good definitely lost translation moments but would say  part authentic experience    My FAVORITE dish Szechwan Lamb  DIE seasonal crab fabulous  can't wrong anything szechwan eat since  they're specialty    The eggplant great although might biased since eat anything eggplant  Any veggies great IF stocked  beginning when opened great selection veggies but recently low traffic stops them keeping large selection    I really recommend here  great value you'll leave happy eater =] <EOR> It's closest best Chinese food near UNLV  really sick tired all food around area   prices notch higher but portions big   I really Chongqing spicy chicken   another restaurant chicken Chinatown Plaza but closed  Theirs better but least found replica! cheap though   I might around trying more menu when next semester starts but give try! waiter always super nice  Don't know name but they're all friendly! <EOR>
