Meat seasoned well focus sandwich   Basically meat cheese bread   Pretty damn delicious cheese steak   Took away star though rest order   Pork Bar B Que sandwich said award winner but just didn't much   pork overly stringy but sauce?  wayyyyy sweet!  almost sickly sweet!  looking more tang bite sauce   But sweet just overpowering   Really want list   The fried okra OK just really fried okra   little bland but fried fresh could used bit more seasoning   Plus didn't really well sandwiches kind forgettable   Prices fairly reasonable but man paying nearly $10 sandwich gets some reason guess because much cheap food town   mean come downtown prime rib dinner sides salad bar dessert same price!  But thankfully Pop's cheese steak tasty   I'll regular Pop's especially during lunch days work   But just steak sandwich now on!  #sweetmeat <EOR> The workers jerks obviously expecting high class service coming place but dang customer still customer  Even guy taking order made repeat plain Philly steak again he still mixed orders put wrong cheese toppings  said wanted original philly steak everyhing he said whats everything? umm normal philly steaks have?
