well know still sherwood forest bar but didn't know once cafe  so so just beer  <EOR> After checking decided eat nearest food spot hotel    I ordered country fried steak friend orders pecan crusted chicken  portion sizes huge way filling  bad  best part meal side mash which very good actually  friend hated order barely ate it  managed leave stomach aches lasted only hour so   The service friendly but seemed overwhelmed amount customers  Prices cheap maybe food  note told others breakfast only thing order here        Then next morning did buffet    why     <EOR> As far cafes place wasn't bad   ate few times    The first time corned beef hash dish incredibly picky about   good enough add extra star review    My second dish grilled salmon took room   wasn't particularly good but wasn't all bad either   baked potato came baked properly another important factor me  The third meal standard eggs bacon hash browns   eggs bacon decent but hash browns sub par   orange juice pretty good though  I never really good service but wasn't terrible   wait long time for no apparent reason seated last trip though   only bothersome because lot open seating   Ultimately place worth but other better options  <EOR> Ever wonder place designed serve breakfast can't right?  Well try Sherwood Forest Cafe Excalibur   Although nice people service extremely slow the place just big food comes pretty cold   think fact kitchen Camelot something because seemed long way orders   So summary   Nice service expensive cold food cavernous atmosphere no Cholula  <EOR> Another standard hotel casino cafe    Brunch chicken fried steak thought pretty good  Yum! batter just fried chicken just way it  steak came eggs hash browns little bit o' fruit  couldn't finish it    haha  Then again also shared side biscuit yes singular gravy  If you're gravy fan sure ask gravy side  poor biscuit swimming gravy = Just other visited weekend amazing but worst a ok  <EOR> I've going Cafe since dragged Vegas parents now going adult say nothing remember which all around sadness    The menu drastically changed almost gotten smaller more limited traditional nothing exciting nothing saying try instead your usual sad    Gave first morning Vegas high hopes because hadn't quite some time 5 years exact aforementioned menu more appetizing breakfast least but surprise shrank nothingness  UGH!   The service mediocre food nothing home brag  sure WAIT! something note actual server did happen help use coupon 5 bucks off adding giving blueberry muffins at point willing try everything better experience place ha!   But again your traditional breakfast choices higher price should nothing special     I think would highly intoxicated handed free food give place another whirl when again city Sin  <EOR> For 24 hour cafe hotel restaurant bad all!    Here's quick list Pros Cons restaurant       PROS The food! swiss cheese chicken sandwich excellent! Very tender chicken pesto mayo spread all fixings   Also served huge pickle very good fries  Paying cashier front don't wait your server keep coming back bill then back your change cc     Huge seating area must especially big casino Excalibur  Friendly servers cashiers     CONS Nice but SLOW service     The line into cafe especially during peak times stretch into casino floor    You don't really know your server person comes take your drink order other takes your food order person delivers etc   But long everything need guess doesn't matter huh?    Definitely fan especially chicken sandwich! <EOR> The Sherwood Cafe located Excalibur Casino  Now why am reviewing it? Well thing noticed brief stay Debauchery Land restaurant selection surprisingly poor  No don't want pay $30 all eat steak buffet ok? option some limited choices    The Sherwood Cafe however your standard breakfast place except Keno board wall  prices somewhat high $10 but eh? serve typical breakfast lunch attire vegetarian options exist    The food turned decent coffee floweth  nice reprieve booth all noise slots gaudy attractions  <EOR> this place very good waiter patricia totally awsome she good sense humor when she cam table food very low price  cafe open 24 hours day  12am night  ordered french dip GF ordered chicken salad salad big recommend place anyone wants eat late night  <EOR> It's 5am you've just left club   You're dying some food soothe your alcohol filled tummy   Sherwood Forest Cafe hits spot   open 24 7   ghetto Hooters   place clean variety food all hours night early morning   Breakfast food eggs cornedbeef hash pancakes lunch dinner type food spaghetti salads sandwiches fish chips chocolate cake your typical diner type food   food isn't phenomenal but bad either   servers pretty friendly   They're just trying best graveyard shift   haven't awhile since clubbing North end strip lately place located Excalibur South end   But if you're area suggest hitting up  <EOR> This place filled fiance loathing   It middle night starving  Fiance called down Sherwood Forest Cafe placed to go order two meals   The food wasn't ready when told would ready   When finally prepared items packaged well securely then bagged  wasn't until room discovered half food wasn't even included  Several items form each meal ordered missing  food did received awful   I would never ever even look place again let alone eat something prepared here  <EOR> It's diner food most part But take Long night drinking  <EOR> Horrible experience me  food compared McDonalds just bigger portion more expensive  Maybe just ordered wrong type food picky eater but honestly never eat again   The waiter rude only tend bigger parties  ask coffee refill multiple times because actually getting one  don't think he even wanted take order    I recommend place  <EOR> im pretty sure ate here   i ordered chicken fingers fries   plain simple    <EOR> This only place open hotel when there   friend ours said wasn't bad   guess  open interpretation!!  isn't bad? compare to?  suppose food 2am long flight drinking limits your tasting abilities   place horrible   Service terrible   waitress could barely understand orders   She constantly repeated herself your order still didn't right   seated seems forever before someone came over   took forever drinks food   only thing going prices pretty cheap Vegas we're talking    But then again service food     Beware Sherwood Forest Cafe!! <EOR> I came $5 happy hour eats ribs fries plate  Service little slow wasn't given any ketchup fries when food came out  took while before saw server again before could ask some ketchup  three beef ribs which dry side handful fries  food decent cheap price  Don't expecting much otherwise you'll very disappointed  <EOR> You know what?  wasn't expecting 5 star restaurant coming hang early 6am breakfast   However did fact lot space between tables laid back no hurry feel here  When checked early probably 5th person day   promptly seated given cup joe within 5 minutes meal ready 10 minutes   quality food comparable others said   an Ihop Dennys   Tried french toast meal bad actually tasty   Then again if mess french toast maybe shouldn't cook first place   All all isn't bad spot   my service okay if staying Excalibur again lazy walk drive another breakfast spot Vegas would definitely eat here  <EOR> I think just cannot compare SW steakhouse say downtown $2 99 late night special steak eggs can't judge Sherwood Forest Cafe higher standard really is  24 7 cafe awesome late night specials bustling service during peak hours nice environment ok smelling air  great late night drunk food restaurant serves just everything want   And lets face really $5 cheeseburger all trimmings fries? didn't think so!

WTF    shouldn't stuff around SOMEWHERE hidden away somewhere back kitchen??  Bizarre     only real saving grace leave whole carafe coffee your table   big plus since never come back ask if want refill!  All all could saved money also gotten some consistently more decent food over Denny's strip    and  sayin' much!  I'd say skip place if can! <EOR> The portions HUGE but food very bland way overpriced  nice waitress 90 years old slooooow  place seemed sort dead  atmosphere somewhat hospital cafeteria quiet cold uninviting    There better places eat strip  <EOR> I wish could hire those guys handing hooker ads strip give Don't Sherwood Cafe leaflets instead    This place obscenely bad  Vegas long day travel didn't feel leaving hotel  Oh hello conveniently there's cafe here  seated three minutes staring contest between illiterate mute staffs register  Then around fifteen minutes look ten choice menu before waiter would acknowledge presence  taking order she disappeared never seen again   Seriously  can't review food because never us  Forty five minutes later decided no bacon God's green earth would worth time wasted left  way illiterate mute suddenly learned speak asked wait while she checked kitchen  Wench shoulda done earlier  don't know why people checked off waiter service reviews literally none   Hopefully enjoyed keno entries left   Barack Obama Leeeeeroy Jenkins may lucky night soon    <EOR> Sherwood Forest always consistent many years going Cafe   menu changed little personal taste changed course   Ten years ago would said second best restaurant behind Sir Galahad's      hehe   Now would say second best restaurant Excalibur      all   your usual casino 24 7 cafe nothing over top outstanding nothing menu super horrible   Service consistent depending upon volume people being waited price right  <EOR> We ate around 2am 3am Saturday night because drunk hungry    From long night drinking playing slots losing money! = service great  waitress fast friendly  ordered Philly Cheese Steak seasoned fries It great! Fiance ordered Eggs Benedict  He said Eggs Benedict pretty tasty  happy food service we'd definitely come back again another late night snack next time we're Vegas   = <EOR> It is    hotel cafe but much going it  Keep mind twice both times around 3am plus few drink ya know     +  Open 24 hours serve unlike idiots hotel bars   Food actually ok   You order single pancake cool that!
