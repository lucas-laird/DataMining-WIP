So he finally agrees take kitchen when he brings back he brings SAME steak but now cut into 4 pieces basically saying chef insists RARE  only he rude enough say bring raw steak if you'd basically insulting customers    And even through all mom still tipped waiter which wish she didn't  But then again wish never all  unfortunate since stay Rio often but experience far worst restaurant  top aunts birthday celebrating just became most disappointing night Vegas had  <EOR> The hostess attitude   but waiter great  food pricey but amazing views phenomenal  unlike anything Vegas! elevator view going worth prices alone  Totally worth going especially if you're staying Rio we were    French onion soup delicious friends loved rib eye   would definitely recommend it! <EOR> We love Steak Houses willing pay Top $$$ great Steak!
