Those homemade potato chips yeah buddy! delicious! <EOR> This place good enough warrant two trips during short trip Vegas   For first visit Fresh Grill buffalo chicken wrap which may best idea hot day Vegas  normally find buffalo sauce spicy enough but sauce used definitely was  keep adding extra ranch dressing cool burning mouth   On second visit friend shared honey mustard chicken wrap which tongue thanked for    I love all different sauces dippers provide here  friends tried almost all them knew Italian dressing tasted good seasoned fries?  The wraps huge all took home half meals ate dinner later second time smart enough share orders  homemade chips pretty good but inconsistent much each order gets  friends sometimes only few pieces plus crumbs while serving loads chips  <EOR> Mmmm    Chicken teriyaki bowl     The chicken white fully cooked doesn't taste rancid  The rice also white  The veggies death grill  The flavor meh <EOR> Looking vegan food Strip?
