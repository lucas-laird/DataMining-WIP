Apparently machine made type store   We ordered b3 knife cut noodle  noodle flat ok broth not  sweet garlicky meat undercooked   We also order boiled dumpling beef pocket pancake   part strongly question authenticity store  Everyone eaten beef pancakes know best and  most cautious part eating juice inside it  bite small opening let steam carefully suck soup juice pocket! Nope! store simple cut half juice heat lost! onion inside undercooked  big fan half cooked veggies  dumplings course broken  Authentic Chinese dumplings should broken once again keep juice inside   Lastly charge $1 tea  REAL Chinese restaurant charge tea  Why?

T sweating food  Although servers may little strange food good  <EOR> The food great  Simple menu noodle rice dishes appetizer choices  only noodles but attest noodles great terms flavor texture  Noodle soup extremely flavorful  Wish could slightly more generous terms meat sliced beef noodle soup  charge hot tea  Boba tea ok overly sweet enough tea flavor probably made powder   Service warmed over time but initially very cold had literally 3 4 workers staring family entered restaurant no greeting   Lackluster service but nothing terrible wouldn't put heaping hot bowl good noodles  <EOR> This first time ever trying style food    only thing compare maybe pho but wide flat noodle resembles homemade pasta   broth dark rich tasty bits fresh ginger slow simmered beef fresh cilantro little bit lime maybe   layers flavor   b3 menu    also ordered mongolian beef pancake kind round flat pot sticker delightful crisp taste   am full only through half order   All $14 bucks   back try more! <EOR> New restaurant taste so  Service ok  Chinese restaurant don't expect much  But problem food hygiene  found hair beef pancake      pointed manager    She said no hair piece onion!!!

Next ordered two soups  ordered Beef Brisket w Tomato Noodle he ordered Hot Spicy Noodle  came rather quickly  Mine good but lacking something sure exactly  noodles good  just didn't taste finished  think maybe some more spices would better  am sure however know use spices flavor because he hot spicy noodle spicy eat  Now don't wrong both spicy food  just soup mess spice floating noodles  Incidentally splash those spices while eating noodles took eye evening  Oops! But he said bathroom very clean    As result he order some pork dumplings satisfy need nourishment  come prepared two different ways boiled fried  He ordered fried good   Here kicker most restaurants provide unlimited refills iced tea  Most Chinese restaurants well  even unlimited hot tea all them  Unfortunately case here  When ordered iced tea asked if wanted green tea say honey lemon because the green tea no sugar plain  thought well    honey lemon sounds refreshing took tip  He ordered mango flavored iced tea  teas poured back brought iced to go cups  much ice could take maybe four sips before reaching empty  But no problem    just ask more right?  Our bill iced tea two people $17 50  Yup didn't even buzz  Other rest bill another $27 00   right all food only $27 00    I truly believe part service includes being knowledgeable menu advising your guests those menu specifics  don't think would taken much server ask if wanted ORDER another drink  key language could respectfully signaled fact drinks offered refills  If all else fails three maybe someone should bluntly said fyi    those iced teas $3 50 each! <EOR> Clean good nice staff  If ask knife cut noodles they're always fresh  Definitely coming back  <EOR> Warning #4 spicy beef noodle just that  SPICY! swimming chili oil  Knife sliced noodle beef brisket soup broth easier eat taste buds  noodles slippery eat needed fork  Fun watch chefs stretching  noodles also knife cutting dough into water  wanted take rice version dish work next day since knew fresh noodle would gummy  Both times come they've rice  Why put menu? <EOR> I've searching hand pulled noodles ever since Beijing noodle cafe closed  driving recently saw place checked reviews finally try it!

Came standing room only wait list door sure put your name down!     Started SPICY PORK WONTONS favorite dish  Served chili oil lightly dressed spices only filled pinch pork won ton skins delicate delicious  Moved MONGOLIAN BEEF PANCAKE which bit underwhelming  Dipping sauce accompanying pickled daikon nice touch but vegetable option may better filling itself bland  Would suggest vegetable beef mixture added menu  Lastly shared PORK MUSHROOM KNIFE SLICED NOODLE first dish top last page   massive portion fresh noodles would preferred thicker noodle though good flavor  Good quality amount variety mushrooms but only saw small piece pork entire dish  accompanying sauce made dish bit unexpectedly soupy   Quality decent value great but service having difficulty keeping amount business doing  Great cheap date spot nice décor low prices  $20 easily split couple apps entrée  <EOR> Spicy beef noodles !!

Taste spice   Veggies?  Taste spice   Meat?  Taste spice   Don't order unless particular spice taste can't identify it    The portion decently large filling but if still full might consider getting appetizer    few appetizers menu ask waitress them   only tried which medium sized bowl black fungus $3    black fungus cold mushroom dish seasoned vinegar sesame oil I think    Eat plain itself put into soup because would destroy taste      Parking plentiful   restaurant bit small not lot seats likely need wait table during busy times   if only two your party sit counter   Service friendly quick   I plan try other dishes menu update review accordingly  <EOR> It cool Lanzhou Lamian type noodles U S  places everywhere China but they're few far between U S  noodles dense chewy broth full flavor  provide lot information noodles glass demonstrate technique well  kids loved it  <EOR> i am lover all things noodle  i especially love knife cut hand pulled fresh noodles  noodle man satisfies craving just well enough   i would say good enough vegas statement dislike very much no matter true might many places town especially chinese food joints  although would love give 4 5 stars just doesn't reach mark me  i've quite few times now each time something gone wrong losing receipt making sign new giving food another table giving wrong dish altogether giving right dish wrong noodles etc  i think worst last time there  i ordered shanxi knife sliced noodle soup whose description reads beef brisket sweet potato vermicelli black fungus pickled cabbage green onion cilantro picture match  when dish came basically beef noodle soup some chunks beef some pickled cabbage  i mentioned server wrong dish she replied no right one  picture menu same which replied well maybe menu should reflect correct dish then don't think she shrugged shoulders   my favorite dish probably spicy wontons   like said satisfies craving knife sliced noodles just enough return every often  <EOR> Wow signature B1 noodle dish amazing  Exploding flavor delicious homemade noodles  spicy pork wontons also noteworthy   Great prices  $6 appetizers $8 main dishes  Highly recommend <EOR> Yummy!

There much grease leek pancake dumpling thing ordered able perfect re fry next day bone dry skillet  and still oily The other dumpling like appetizer item *also* literally dripping oil when picked chopsticks  But some reason don't think people care notice because feel they've found secret noodle spot ?  Their popular Szechwan style hand pulled noodle soup bowl pretty boring one dimensional flavor just spicy red much else  Pretty unappealing if ask me  could care less hand pulled noodles if broth sucks  mention think hand made noodles lot more difference Italian cooking Asian cooking  broth king me  observed most non Asian people loving Noodle Man busy eating noodles *not* drinking broth  opposite  If broth sucks fail  walked around table table bowls bowls full undrunken broth! Nobody cares drinking broth! coup Noodle Man! People coming only eating your noodles which cost 5 cents if that! <EOR> I order Jjajangmein because Chinese style better Korean style  came tasting more Korean style but less sauce  still good  Mom order spicy beef noodles  really good  thing really stood over everything else Chinese dudes nicest ever served by  Some Chinese restaurants aren't known customer service because well just cultural norm your typical Chinese restaurant  But dudes anything else sir? pay check he said don't worry bring you  Lastly don't know if cook way something but left he opened door held us! think guys grew South something don't mean Southern China  mean Southern hospitality Austin Nashville Savannah  bunch other dishes really wanna try  Oh yeah watching dude hand toss twist dough always fun watch  kinda mesmerizing watch dough twist into itself  <EOR> Noodle pockets all pretty good including $1 jasmine green tea  carried order beef pocket 2 pieces each order heated them next morning frying pan did taste good restaurant  <EOR> Read reviews but course wanted try ourselves  glad did!

We ordered Lan Zhou beef noodles soup beef brisket tomato noodles soup chicken mushroom pancakes   Lan Zhou noodles soup served clear beef broth top thin sliced beef shanks   tasted little bland compared tomato beef soup well wasn't fair because soup bases different clear broth supposed more delicate flavor while brown broth should more intense     While beef brisket tomato noodle soup served brown beef broth tomato base more beef stew soup chunky briskets  Both beef soup very light seasoned perfection   chicken mushroom pancakes very juicy however did little gamey aroma     Glad found cute little noodles restaurant neighborhood saved trip spring mountains area!! <EOR> The Hot Spicy noodles favorite! just delicious dish  service good could better  <EOR> The Noodle Man gets solid 4 5 stars me   I've Noodle Man maybe five times now mention three five within week  When first heard Noodle Man just try it  Hand pulled noodles?!  lost art Las Vegas!

I definitely want eat again try some other menu items  <EOR> This best Chinese food outside Chinatown new favorite place slurp on   located Rainbow 215 right beside Einstein bagel   price right flavors awesome   I've never seen freshly made noodles trust all difference when taste them   tell take pride preparation presentation each dish   Everyone chefs working hard   could easily see myself becoming regular here   The location seriously small   hoping expand very soon but stay Southwest side town   arrived late dinner around 8pm wait but much shorter expected   We started spicy pork wonton appetizer then pork mushroom knife sliced noodle   Dave ordered Lan Zhou Beef soup which came super packed dense filling noodles  <EOR> My first time restaurant but heard several people good  very crowded but right counter  ordered stir fried chicken noodles  ready very quick tasted great  look forward going back trying something else menu  <EOR> I enjoyed B3 noodles!!!! picture doesn't justice!!!the service fast guys working cleaned table right away eat hostess lady didn't even that    just glad didn't wait because pretty small inside     lot tables would call see wait time if room dine in   they also serve boba drinks which plus    <EOR> This first time dining in  ordered last time  would given them 4 5 stars food  taste pretty authentic very decent  portion huge maybe even little much noodles  However service bit disappointing no refill $3 50 20 oz  cup jasmine iced tea? Wow! understand beverage where most restaurants money but if they're going charge much iced tea where most Asian restaurant would only charge 50 cent free should least refill allowed  server decent but feel bad table next us  rushed placed order when started asking questions waitress frustrated them  She even complaining another server Mandarin   absolutely unacceptable unprofessional sure she's aware there're other patrons myself dining understood Chinese perfectly  made first time dining pretty unpleasant  may just stick ordering to go if decided give place another shot  <EOR> I came eat dad he liked it  ordered hot spicy #5 also #4 menu  service great  definitely come back  <EOR> I really hate leaving bad reviews  prefer leave review if bad but way nonchalant having bad service just appalled me   We came party 5 ordered bunch dishes everyone some appetizers  appetizers consisted spicy wontons beef pancake fried dumplings  seemed forever all main dishes started come first which didn't really mind because all starving  When received rude looks because asked them fork more once already knew wasn't going good experience  When half done meal appetizers came  First pancakes then spicy wontons  fried dumplings never came  when almost done meal asked server dumplings said if ready would cancel them  watched back tell lady cooking some dumplings  server walking back see lady throw  some dumplings into pan  server returns says 2 minutes  which replied done meal already just started cooking dumplings  want cancel them  She actually nerve tell take go  serious? forget order instead canceling try cook them force us  adamant canceling few dirty looks staff she assured canceled   We check boxes  paid bill getting ready leave but since hot day decided order few teas go  ordered two honey black teas honey green tea go  Now mind drinks ordered meal came within couple minutes ordering expected pretty quick  waiting ten minutes seems head server manager walked by  stopped asked teas  He back came back said she's making it  It'll take two minutes  she? Whoever she isn't doing anything because teas literally take minute pour over ice pump honey whatever do  another 10 minutes total 20 minutes waiting some iced tea said forget which manager just nodded head if he knew whole time weren't going tea   just horrible  No apologies  even recognition terrible service wait time was  Just nod   Now know side town many options new hand pulled homemade noodles thing kind cool people  And single noodle made fresh hand pulled while because there's window watch didn't see anything whole time  way better places just 10 minute drive away Chinatown  Places care your time care if enjoyed your meal not  don't know if think don't need care because busy but don't think supposed handmade mushy noodles worth insult  <EOR> This favorite new local finds friend referred try!

Their handmade noodles spectacular tell noodles freshly made just right amount spring them if any sense al dente but soggy trying at!  I done some thorough research hotel before coming order which could've ordered hotel phone but just being wishy washy waited   seats people ordered which thought really nice  restaurant itself smaller side but good amount people too   see into kitchen see them making noodles cooking which thought pretty neat  would've loved sit bar right front watch them but self conscious didn't want eating alone though think place would've perfect since small    Waited 10 minutes food ready gave two sets utensils though just X_X  But least weren't stingy some places are!
