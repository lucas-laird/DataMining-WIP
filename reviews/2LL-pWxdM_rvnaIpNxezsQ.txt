Yum! finally tried truck following twitter  located Durango Centennial where opening restaurant soon     Down food   I ordered Captains Order Barbe which both really delicious loaded flavor  ordered daughter plain jane which consist cheese ketchup which she loved  took bite bf's pulled pork slider which really good  far no disappointment me    The staff really friendly helpful because did ask them which most popular slider sure enough pulled pork  I'd definitely come back try some other sliders  <EOR> I've Slidin' Thru truck many times when parked down street house happy when opened HQ down street office  taken lot co workers HQ all really enjoy food always order way much  décor very 'young' but food fantastic never anything didn't like  <EOR> Food trucks become huge trend days but fight lines hunt them down around town  I'd much rather fixed location order something whenever want which why take trip Slidin' Thru HQ see if sliders restaurant any better ones truck  Simple answer nope   The HQ located near airport odd office park  There's bar next door  very easy find because all signage but HQ nothing but sticker window friend drove twice  Maybe don't want found even those trying look them? interior place something comic book insane colors loud music comic book style art spray painted all over walls  wasn't bad but seating choices quite limited  think two booths could seat six round table few chairs long high top table maybe another 8 chairs so   sure when there's rush although based location maybe never is     For sake variety hoping would hit jackpot least decent slider ordered three different kinds selection six Angus sliders pulled pork slider eggplant option 'mystery' selection   also offer four different kinds Super Fries all sorts insane toppings well regular sweet potato   The first Barby which melted cheddar caramelized jalapenos crispy fried onion strips bacon bbq sauce  Quite lot toppings little slider expected much flavor but LOT dryness   word 'dry' going become common theme should mention  bun slider extremely dry bit hard but meat beyond dry  Luckily ? onions bbq sauce completely consumed all flavor concoction bit distracted dryness taste bad version KC Masterpiece sauce  Strike one   The next Captain's Order complete roma tomatoes arugula bacon feta cheese sautéed onions balsamic reduction  Once again bun meat beyond dry but lucky time balsamic commanded all flavor  bacon decent flavor but totally overcooked dry  much else say just underwhelmed again  Strike two   My final attempt decency came Pep Pep which guy behind register described 'In N Out clone'  lettuce tomato pickles bacon sautéed onions cheddar super sauce  few burgers even close being good Almighty but must say good  only wished ordered three them  Upon very first bite exclaimed actually tasted burger  pickles good bacon ok meat somehow retained some moisture time  meat its own ok flavor happy ended others    As fries Barby Fries which play Barby slider  bit mistake if you're getting few different kinds sliders try fries based burger you're getting some more variety  if you're looking order giant bucket fries $5 more enough 3 4 people try regular sweet potato choices  fries bad own but layered melted cheddar bacon caramelized jalapenos bbq sauce become something totally different  soggy very quickly sauce overpowers all flavors once again  onions taste good very reminiscent Bloomin' Onion if you've ever dared order one  bacon bits overcooked burnt grease flavor jalapeños tasted good but buried rest flavors   Maybe most acceptable part meal price three sliders $7  think very reasonable if could three aren't dry might actually but once combine $5 insane Super Fries drink quickly becomes $15+ meal which bit steep this  fries more enough share few people could split cost few other folks otherwise would stick regular fries much more reasonable $2    Overall fail see all hype about  Sure food truck thing cool but unless actually deliver good product some other folks don't know tell you  interior HQ probably cool if you're high school but if you're looking decent place sit down something slightly better fast food should probably skip HQ  <EOR> Food always good although service could better seating limited   prefer truck  <EOR> I am sure prompted drive all way across town sample some sliders but decided drive couple days grand opening check out  First off place way cool inside  street food flavor thats par truck   Cool old school video games graphiti style paint  greeted customary fist bump cash register ordered some pep pep sliders pep pep fries  blown away either  am fan seriously thick burger more meatball slider  All all taste good  back try other menu items but admit all hype just ever slightly disappointed  food bad just great all hype       <EOR> After much hype opening land based HQ check myself  Ambiance very cool something straight comic book  did cheesy Vegas feel all which nice departure used to  But didn't come cool ambiance came try food    To start less impressed selection sliders available  only 7 menu items choose also seemed choices very similar taste profiles because most same ingredients ie  bbq sauce sauteed onion cheddar cheese  would thought sliders would all very different taste  ordered 3  Barby  Captain  Caprese  normally wouldn't caprese but most different all other sliders  ordered superfries well  might but did fact fries same toppings burgers did appeal me  most part sliders good flavor however meat well done would guess actual patty only 1 oz  tasted very dried no matter much bbq sauce put doesn't hide fact meat overcooked  caprese did much flavor  mozzerella did taste anything eggplant thin could hardly tell there  fries generous portion but since same burger toppings enough bbq bacon did finish them    Overall think concept very cool brings something new table  really fact arcade games play free! would say food needs little tweaking but right track    For $17 think something missing  want back try smores fries though! <EOR> Could Sildin' Thru Truck any better?
