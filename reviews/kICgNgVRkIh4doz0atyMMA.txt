I ordered Hakka cocktail probably favorite drink during Vegas trip  If love lychee coconut tropical flavors good!   We started off steamed dim sum platter crispy duck salad  Dim sum tasted fresh! quite filling well  Crispy duck salad good  more duck salad though which probably really problem most but made dish more filling heavier wanted  entrees ordered Chilean Sea bass chinese honey egg scallion fried rice share  sea bass cooked perfectly  flavor reminded chasu pork way  Unfortunately fried rice bit dry tastes    We quite surprised large portions were  Both tables next complaining well  Before coming thinking doing signature menus but now realized would probably 4 times more food  even take food go!  Hubby said such nice restaurant but portions should more refined  But also say your money's worth right?

Per recommendation waiter ordered most popular dessert which mousse terrible! if prepared day prior stuck fridge  He gladly took off bill apologized issue    I would recommend restaurant least bit! wish better review write because see other people enjoyed it! hype really worth here! <EOR> Color impressed!  This long overdue review which saved when some time sit down write   Vegas known decadence excess Hakkasan prime example that  isn't your typical Chinese restaurant ready splurge some pretty pennies handsome Benjamins!

Also waitress very knowledgeable friendly! <EOR> i ate hakkasan first time absouletly enjoyed everything food service managers fantatsic reservations team hosts everyone very professional friendly food amazing place come <EOR> The best Chinese restaurant Vegas  compete those nice ones China even  Never recommend restaurant except one  <EOR> London based Hakkasan first appeared strong radar when opened San Francisco late last year  heard great reviews but just couldn't fit while during Christmas  location tenth worldwide chain known its high end Chinese cuisine fact two its locations NYC London garnered Michelin stars relative rarity Chinese restaurant  Hakkasan's eleventh location marks its biggest splash all $100 million 5 floor 75 000 square foot restaurant nightclub  Literally figuratively Las Vegas' biggest opening year   Our meal began colorful lineup cocktails two alcoholic two non alcoholic pictured left right    Eden black grapes rose sugar lychee juice soda water The Chinese Mule ketel vodka masumi junmai sake cilantro ginger lime ginger beer The Hakka belvedere vodka masumi okuden junmai sake coconut passion fruit lychee juice Mandarine Sunshine kumquats apple ginger fever tree ginger ale  We each enjoyed drinks  Chinese mule Asian twist classic  thoroughly enjoy cocktails savory ingredients no exception   As many Chinese restaurants menu Hakkasan fairly vast  picked item each section menu focusing house specialties signified Hakkasan logo    Salt Pepper Squid salt pepper squid relatively simple dish unlike you'd typical Chinese restaurant  Tender squid covered crispy batter much flavor coming fried chilies shallots  Whereas find dish somewhat inconsistently prepared across restaurants well executed   Crispy Duck Salad pomegranate pine nut shallot server highly recommended spending good five minutes selling it  duck pretty tasty crispy skin held lightly dressed salad  little bit pomegranate seeds fried lotus root added some additional texture  all thought great well balanced dish   Roasted Chilean Sea Bass Chinese honey best dishes evening succulent piece fish roasted honey  earthiness texture fried mushrooms main accompaniment but real star rich moist fish   Pipa Duck another highlight simple but very well done  Thin strips sweet duck served its own crisp skin  think some fat trimmed leaving nice balance meat fat skin delicious pieces   Stir Fry Black Pepper Beef Ribeye Merlot beef very tender similar tenderloin texture  savory sauce didn't add ton flavor meat but tasty chunks meat nonetheless  Note self woven fried noodle 'basket' isn't really edible   Three Style Mushroom Stir Fry macadamia nut gai lan stalks water chestnut dish more interesting texturally flavor wise  Assorted chewy mushrooms crunchy stalks gai lan made some lighter bites between meat fish   French Beans minced pork dried shrimp Dried shrimp porky flavor stood beans cooked just enough tender firm snap them  very nice side dish   Hakka Noodle mushrooms Chinese chives primary starch component addition Jasmine rice dish stir fried noodles  good light spice though altogether unspectacular   Upon completion savory dishes ordered trio sweet ones   'PB J' peanut butter parfait sour cherry jam banana passion fruit sorbet Chocolate Black Sesame Cremeux sesame florentine yuzu ice cream Strawberries Champagne vanilla panna cotta organic strawberries rhubarb Champagne foam  Each beautifully plated  brother PB J featuring rich peanut butter sour cherry flavors complemented passion fruit sorbet  dad opted chocolate black sesame dessert creamy flavors accented bright yuzu ice cream  mother lighter vanilla panna cotta topped Harry's Berries strawberries interesting Champagne foam crumble texture  me? just extra spoon sample each  favorite last one   The food beautiful decor just everything pretty tasty  cuisine primarily stays true traditional Chinese moving towards more Western fusion influences lot other high end Asian restaurants do  result food felt very comfortable way but no mistake also significantly more refined average Chinese restaurant and prices reflect that   <EOR> I hearing fabulous things new nightlife mecca Hakkasan long before opening past April  friend does PR brand grew Las Vegas any new opening  exciting warrants trip home see all buzz about   made reservations weeks before planned eat around 8 30 Saturday before entering club later see Tiesto  bit tricky find enter restaurant because walk through entirety massive MGM casino floor other side navigate signs ropes herd club goers into

walk through MGM seated right away  restaurant takes first 2 floors 5 story Hakkasan space interior breathtaking   While restaurant huge broken into intimate spaces endless web intricately woven wooden panels stationed horizontally vertically  walls glow blue dark wood decor tasteful elegant  menu vast broken into sections i e  Meat Fish Veggies Starch etc  standard Chinese restaurant but asked server recommendations     We started Crispy Duck Salad which renowned items good reason  duck alone divine poached steamed chinese spice mixture hours before being fried rice flour then added plum dressing mixture greens pine nuts pomelos more mouth watering ingredients  truly astonishing amazing was    Next came Sesame Shrimp Toast w Foie Gras which most excited since CA outlawed delectable delicacy but greatly disappointed  dish 4 hearty spheres solid shrimp mixture completely coated sesame seeds   Supposedly when bit into them foie gras would ooze but case  If foie gras did find it  Disappointing bland    Next ordered cup Hot Sour soup dish boyfriend both love curious see Hakkasan interpreted it  good different though    sweet almost fishy flavor broth    For larger dishes ordered Black Pepper Rib eye Merlot Stir fry which came sauteed onions garlic absolutely world   Some most tender steak general wonderful experience flavor texture stir fry dish   also ordered Sweet Sour Pork which fresh very flavorful     We wanted order fried crab appetizer veggie dish well but realized quickly getting very full because foolishly snack Todd English Pub around 5 30 pm more later!   wish could sampled more dishes cocktails   I only tried Hakka which vodka sake mixed passion fruit lychee juice absolutely incredible    The menu provides plenty options fantastic meal 2 bill

Hakkasan advised when arrived should discreetly advise hostess custom cake surprise party  hostess beyond rude screamed she'd restaurant since 6 no cake  surprise  asked manager  She again told 100% no cake she would know  manager finally came over also incredibly rude again loudly told party no cake  told bakery confirmed again he very rudely told bakery's faulty restaurant  He stormed off  seated ordered drinks  drink order same manager runs table mind never breaking stride screams found cake! no apology acknowledgement incredibly unprofessional behavior  Please give place your money! <EOR> OBSESSED    I originally planning ordering dim sum platter but $28 8 pieces so $3 50 piece size chicken nugget  or smaller couldn't justify ordering when know 4 pieces $2 50 most Chinese Asian restaurants   Instead opted crispy duck salad same price MUCH MORE BULK     more bang your buck sure! out of world delicious! small chunks crispy duck skin pieces pomegranate citrus lots greens  friends kept re dipping forks onto plate   My friend shared hot sour soup did disappoint  came steaming hot careful but taste perfection  Again probably overpriced but cheapest items menu   I try
