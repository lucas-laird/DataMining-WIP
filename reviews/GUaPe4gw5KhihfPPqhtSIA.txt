TGIF most other chains foods ok service ok  <EOR> Let start saying LOVE TGI Fridays sad even leave review    I come location often because less 4 miles house  last three times awful   The waiters usually ok nice first time come your table    Then never really check again   Two visits ago asked menu endless apps which $10 time  Someone just week prior knew menu  waitress said something don't menu guess check though  came back 20 minutes later menu   All waiters know slow kitchen when ordered endless apps waitress literally told she would put 2 appetizers time each didn't wait long which still did   Getting drink refill pulling teeth which annoying considering much drinks cost   The prices recently practically everything menu considering location can't even guarantee fast service warm food sure worth anymore   Other things note The layout awful  Just terrible  Some tables weird angle where feel should just stand whole time you're less uncomfortable  They free wifi which literally worked 3 years  don't need your phone during dinner but there's no cell service since area Sam's basically cement  showing parents things Instagram Twitter sometimes when we're talking wifi never works  The nearest bathroom requires walk outside restaurant into casino  deal breaker but pretty annoying  It loud!!!! can't hear ANYTHING someone saying even right across table  <EOR> We always stay Sam's Town when visit Vegas usually start day eating TGI Friday's   going hotel years remember when space used Harvest House which old school coffee shop kind 24 hour restaurant     So breakfast but don't lot omelette selections very creative is   special priced lunch menu day last trip tried special $5 99 cobb salad   First all waited over 30 minutes food ordered when salad came very small piece chicken half hard boiled egg cherry tomato sliced half   husband ordered breakfast   long does take breakfast?

If offer free chips reward member then why put bill first place?  Secondly only manager remove bill? Then why both managers meeting pay chips wait until meeting over??  Something wrong !!! then waiter doesn't understand why woutbe slightly upset!!!  course eating waiting bill why should mind having wait manager availability before leave??? <EOR> Where even start?  Let's start off dirty table menus sticky table hadn't wiped down before seated   This place empty 0 time clean?  Next beer glass DIRTY tasted flat  paid $6 didn't even drink it   The only thing good queso dip should just ordered left   I know TGI Fridays isn't high class joint but expect least clean!  I also expect service where ignored!  Hire new staff cleans takes care customers   Don't ever ever   McDonald's would better this  <EOR> Went dinner last night birthday ! staff excellent food service great!!! server Lee above beyond sure happy birthday!! Great dinner experience <EOR> My family seated waited 15 minutes someone take orders  No even offered drink  dad called someone take order but none servers gave any recognition  then walked no even noticed  obviously no serve customers  <EOR> In hopes TGI's would bring little more table then Sam's Town puts out   wishful thinking  would much rather head food court order Big Mac watch howling wolf then spend $30 place again    I generously given them extra star due major crisis server claimed experiencing during visit  Needless say took good while menus twice long drink orders in    We ordered Buffalo Wings Happy Hour  Wings cold odd flavor  fries came later when almost finished eating Wings  salty ended leaving entire basket  Mozzarella sticks delicious earned whole whoopin star great taste freshness!!
