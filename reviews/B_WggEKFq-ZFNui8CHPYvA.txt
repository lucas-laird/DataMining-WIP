Only if only option    Otherwise I'd skip it  <EOR> Oh love place!

I ordered poke bowl through Uber Eats probably should've physically particular it   The portions disproportionate  checked 'spicy poke' main protein app but BARELY even tasted it  more spicy imitation crab seaweed bowl which way considered add ons    I'm bit flabbergasted glowing reviews place but then again probably should've myself  Also few poke options Uber Eats    For bowl less 10 bucks raised eyebrow wasn't expecting much  Compared other poke bowls area beyond far worst but give them benefit doubt  <EOR> What this? Its sushi roll less rice more ingredients  place awesome  it CHIPOTLE sushi ingredients  you ask menu burritos ranging soft shell crab shrimp tempura spicy tuna forth  menu people cant decide put it  omit items also  like TRIPLE no jalapenos  but your feeling adventurous   you build your own   order them burrito seaweed soy nachos bowl boring tortilla   Plus condiment station end line  wasabi soy sauce shoyu hawaiians pickled ginger other things accompany sushi  During lunch line long prepared inline 30 mins  but its worth wait  Oh trick eating keep paper while your eating ingredients dont fall out! <EOR> Love place  great customer service food amazing  my twin dragon soy wrapp   <EOR> Absolutely delicious! 2 3 delicious sushi rolls big burrito price roll  going once week!

Fast sushi  Burrito sized rolls lots options  Fast yummy super filling  Watch become major chain  <EOR> I love set menu your own burrito option! both delicious unless just completely dead taste buds pretty hard mess burrito! All ingredients fresh light very affordable considering its sushi  those still working trying raw fish also veggie cooked meat chicken options well! <EOR> So placed online order 2 burritos steak egg triple also three bowls firecracker Santa Fe lion king    My item firecracker bowl customized add baby spinach mixed greens pico tempura crunch guacamole $ 50   picked order excited eat bowl saw ticket order taped it  But once opened bowl none added items bowl!!!! No guacamole paid extra for  No greens spinach pico tempura crunch  kinda disappointed because placed online order clearly stating wanted bowl none made there  still good nonetheless but still wanted items added there    But moms bowl order Santa Fe every single customized item seems just over looked order still kinda disappointing    Don't think back there  <EOR> I loved place  quick fix sushi fly feel breaking bank  <EOR> Ok just did everyone cold chewy piece shrimp tempura twin dragon? skimmed thru most reviews 1 person mentioned that? supposed way? seemed cooked hours ago cold oily chewy rubbery no bueno  Cuz ive never served cold tempura ever before any sushi place! Eh usually spicy tuna anyways 1 bad burrit won't change mind  Other place fab  fave all sushi burrito joints  all sauce options they're skimpy scoops  want try bowl but always manage burrito every time in  Staff always super nice too  <EOR> Hands down BEST sushi burrito restaurant Las Vegas  tried others but nothing ever good Soho's  Twin Dragon favorite  They're always busy isn't time when know no but line quick  <EOR> Definitely recommend place! employees very nice attentive  first time guy explained everything works customize your sushi burrito pick customized  twin dragon burrito good!!! <EOR> Man oh man place King Sushi Burritos! tried place first time last year then thought amazing decided try again hometown Washington DC  Man did fail over here  Then PokeWorks fail too    This place right gives very generous portions sushi fish rice ratio 80 20  absolutely freakin' awesome! took friend's first time want start franchise!

Apparently knowing count isn't exactly common sense anymore  serving three scoops if order quadruple should end twelve yeah? Nope here  mention literally every single time  charged extra extra fish which completely fine just give you're charging for  huge deal but over last year easily 30+ visits they've probably only done right first time once twice   Don't mean rag place hard cause really great otherwise friendly employees excellent quality food stupidly affordable  Strongly recommend but seriously learn count  <EOR> Great new concept! new name vs  Jaburritos   I eaten both Ho Restaurant new location Ho Sushi Burrito   Ho Sushi Burrito food always fresh fast  menu board let's order your own entree bowl tortilla nori soy paper wrap  also suggestions combos Santa Fe Lion etc   few times bad meal even once   Even if Sushi person opt chicken beef wrap very happy your food  <EOR> This cool place! everything have  ordered lion king salmon bowl sushi rice oh good!!! salmon fresh everything fresh    sauce complements each every ingredients  definitely come back place over over again!!! <EOR> It's really really good  Kind pricey but really good lol  Staff super friendly people must much because full everytime here  Everything made right front just subway except way better because sushi! <EOR> Although place tucked into strip mall Sahara small space crammed many tables really enjoy it   Essentially name says all  Sushi style food tuna shrimp tempura soft shell crab other fish mostly raw rolled burrito style somewhat giant hand roll   order pre designed combinations create your own  rolls stuffed very filling reasonably priced between $5 $13 00  We happily worked into lunch rotation  <EOR> The giant sushi burritos terrific!

The service other hand much  The line where food being prepared just little messy all over place  They've only open few months may better time    Another concern difficult choose vast amount toppings  would've easier pick if labels directly glass similar Subway Easy see  Easy choose  Simple!  My husband made own sushi burrito decided own nachos which pretty disappointed chicken  flavorless tasted came frozen package    would've much better if katsu chicken marinaded grilled chicken similar Mochiko's grilled chicken    In case true sushi burrito place order chicken nachos!  All all bad good prices   Next time come back order more popular recommended choices! <EOR> Good food but long wait food  boyfriend tried later 7 30 dinner   We waited half hour before ordered  Food phenomenal worth wait! <EOR> Wow  First time eating super impressed  Great pricing food fresh service fast  Definitely coming back recommending all friends eat sushi  4 yo loves shrimp tempura kids tried twin dragon  Can't wait try everything else  <EOR> I craving place cause first time ate wow  really good  Today very disappointed  bought 2 sushi buritto  Both spicy tuna  way salty  culinary industry consistency taste n texture important  dont think come back here  <EOR> I love sushi burrito bowl! tried twin dragon both  only reason why knocking down 1 star its side items  ordered seaweed salad serving size really small probably just much would've just added burrito $ 50 <EOR> I'm prayin' open another location house   Great tasting food fresh healthy too! <EOR> Please see review place previously known JaBurrito Love sushi burrito concept fish pretty fresh!
