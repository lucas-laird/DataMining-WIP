I gave 3 stars because counter people good however $13? sandwich  mediocre best  could've fresh of bone turkey sandwich Capriotti's 2 3 price  find little expensive considering some deals around town   Bottom line Expensive      <EOR> Super friendly attentive staff turkey sub purchased fine but rest ingredients low quality bland central very little selection    Wouldn't back sorry  <EOR> Where's meat? Just $12 sandwich maybe 25 cents worth meat it  Total ripoff never eat again  <EOR> The Sasquatch making sandwich rude  bread dry sandwich sucked  Airport Jersey Mikes blows! <EOR> Quick service good food  husband's words put smack down subs  Located C terminal  <EOR> Jersey Mikes gets four stars ladies gentlemen   Stumbled place Chipotle block street line door  staff location great took time walked through your options  Enjoyed fresh cold cuts which cut front fresh sub roll  <EOR> Sandwiches always tasty staff very nice  breads meats always fresh better sandwich places too  location always clean well  really enjoy cookies brownies too  <EOR> It quick knew wanted everything worth   the teamwork great back again <EOR> Although food OK women making sandwich rude  sure she manager because she only wearing hat  She serious attitude problem  She put small few drops mayo sandwich asked more she globbed on  don't know if she bad mood but won't going back unless she's there  <EOR> Make sure listen your sub  wife never problem ones Dallas area  But screwed both orders little not horribly bad but apparent didn't listen very well wanted subs  staff very nice though  <EOR> Came today first time number 43 number 6 both sandwiches good establishment clean hostess friendly come again 43 steak sandwich number 6 famous roast beef <EOR> Would give 0 stars if option  Nothing w food just service  walk Jersey Mikes outlet mall Las Vegas Blvd!  Waited 30 min no front me  kids put toppings 9 sandwiches spent 20 min staring ticket 2 min fixing sandwiches  took 3 girls close 30 min put toppings sandwiches can't believe it  bad won't ever back location again  love roast beef sub but location worst   Seriously would put lettuce sandwich read ticket again would put tomato on <EOR> If there's place crave little much Jersey Mike's  tried place sometime April year first time basically refuse any other sandwich place!   I normally #13 wheat bread Mike's way sans red wine vinegar such great combination    One beauties Jersey Mike's amount meat put your sandwich  Other places tend little stingy but I'd say your money's worth here!  They also hot sandwiches such Philly cheesesteaks which great too    They offer 3 different sizes most sandwiches mini regular giant   mini definitely good kids quick snack regular more comparable 6 8 inch sandwich while giant worth those big appetite those wanting share  <EOR> I Big kahuna Cheese Steak white bread its pretty good sandwich Philly Cheese Steaks buts hard find good places close  south end town tried Hanks Capriottis few other places Silverado Ranch area but better places side town since Hougan's Racing sandwich shop closed down  bread fresh soft steak cheese mushrooms onions jalapenos all done right  place Philly fix side town  <EOR> Very friendly staff   Cheesesteaks huge!  Very moist yummy   them better Capriottis  <EOR> Good subs   Much better subway but quite Capriottis   Prices reasonable if possibly buck more expensive should be   Staff very friendly food comes fairly quickly   would say cheesesteak cooked delivered faster Capriottis but tasty   would put place right around same Port subs quality but may slightly better selection  <EOR> Overall love sandwiches go to especially good solid classic style sub  keep coming back Italian Mike's way only way!  Food noted while couple fun subs Big Kahuna Cheese Steak feel hold down when comes more traditional approach subs good bread quality meat simple ingredients   say traditional bad  Other sandwich spots angle  Jersey Mike's just puts product stands more keeping simple ingredients quality venturing into hit or miss territory inventive subs   Staff plenty times many times even forget check in    I sub sandwich tunnel vision never bad experience staff  professional but also fun talkative into mechanical sandwich making auto pilot mode see other spots  Also while looks chaos times very good assembling multiple subs once when go   it's usually picking office order usually 4 8 subs    Facilities usually take food to go but facilities always clean  Additionally all location plenty seating  <EOR> I could seriously eat Jersey Mike's daily  far 1 favorite deli meat sub places eat town  staff always welcoming friendly place always clean  chicken Philly incredible turkey BLT  alive meat front always give plenty  don't short subway  If want all fixins just ask your sub mike's way sure more handle  location jersey mike's perfect right off Las Vegas blvd outlets  only drawback location parking lots often full space limited  But all all great place eat back again again  Enjoy  <EOR> Middle aged Hispanic lady wearing glasses treated friends trash  She rushed caused butcher order  She extremely rude disrespectful throughout dining experience Jersey Mike's favorite sandwich place however your self absorbed employee reason never return  <EOR> Double meat  Double cheese  Mikes way  should apply every sub  first may feel little expensive but portions massive quality there  <EOR> We patronizing sub shop since June 2014   find really annoying  sandwiches good but staff expects tips register asks tack your receipt!  No 1 staff preparing sandwiches behind counter seating taking order delivering table   No  2 am standing line ordering waiting paying then taking food counter table door   No  3 am sure when types restaurant owners managers thought acceptable ask patrons pay tips preparation staff but unacceptable   No  4 When decline add tip purchase cashier visibly angry!  No  5 If want earn tips waiting job!  rid entitlement attitude   If enough type position second job!  nothing wrong working couple jobs most grown ups ahead   sandwich shop restaurant period  <EOR> My first Jersey Mike's experience box lunch volunteer event wasn't impressed   took while check again   eating way much week Vegas stopped way town glad did   Much better other fast food sandwich joints bread fresh meat thinly sliced enjoyed meal   Since don't veggies little weird having oil vinegar sprayed meat instead bread making messy experience but  worst thing could say meal   definitely back  <EOR> Okay experience   Absolutely amazing     The service amazing  soon walked Hillary Martha gave best welcoming  Huge smiles very outgoing  tell care customers!
