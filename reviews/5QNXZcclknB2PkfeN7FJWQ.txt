First time stopping tonight  shared steak catfish entree  Haven't steak juicy long time! Cooked perfection!! Can't wait come back try snow crab  <EOR> Maybe recipe changed?  Maybe new chef?  Maybe just both felt embarrassed 20 cents owed situation?  don't know     Since now charge sauces would nice thing if could ask cashiers simply ask placing orders Would any additional sauces your order ?  would give customer opportunity add cost sauces original bill pay them credit card all once   know would completely helped situation changed overall experience   I'm just sad because special place   place nice family treat   Mom both said don't want back long while   both kind lost taste fish   long drive house but back week pay 20 cents owed   figure wouldn't made young lady such big deal if didn't really need it  <EOR> Dinner delicious  Service good  Server split checks even though party 6  Couldn't help but see tears eyes when she came back table being yelled loud obscenities whom believe manager   Heard when leaving bathroom shocked least  <EOR> Tonight ALL EAT Ribs Shrimp Catfish Salad Bar TOO    only $13 95    way stuffed   Service Amazing     They also gumbo frog legs alligator    must try next visit    YUMMY    <EOR> Terrible restaurant! birthday dinner friend  2 people ribs 1 crab legs 1 steak  The salad bar extremely limited smell sewage horrible salad bar area  The service very good either  waitress gave menu right then already asked if ready order  trying minutes! During dinner waitress told person eating crab legs he doing wrong insisted literally showing eat them! The french fries horrendous obviously having fried very old oil making them greasy nasty taste  This good place avoid! <EOR> I really enjoyed food place  restaurant always pretty packed especially Mondays when all you can eat crab legs special  all you can eat salad bar great fun menu things alligator tail frog legs  try both those items must say actually pretty good  Everything battered fried super unhealthy sure but catfish absolutely die for  actually drive through order option which really convenient but only complaint once ordered catfish fries instead catfish sandwich expecting some hush puppies side standard every order but missing to go bag  would say definitely come food expect polite service moderate prices but also expect very loud crowded inside  indeed Las Vegas! food very worth it  <EOR> I wanted love place   REALLY did   husband Arkansas lived south much life     finding Southern restaurant Vegas made very excited   also love crab legs doubly excited try AYCE Monday night   I say crab legs probably some absolute best crab legs ever had   very meaty     no flimsy ones bunch and believe ate BUNCH!    waitress also very nice   That's where good part stopped though   restaurant itself dire need good cleaning   feels dingy dirty   seated right waterfall which joke     just embarrassing really   PVC pipes barely pushing trickle water into cement tub chipped paint   think would better just board windows no could see thing   The salad bar pretty much joke too   others mentioned doesn't whole lot items those questionable   exactly fresh looking   And name Hush Puppy would expect some REALLY GOOD hush puppies but no    just pretty meh  Maybe if mood crab legs I'd back    but really enough places town serve pretty good crab legs also nice ambiance     I'd probably just those instead   Still looking great Southern place Vegas    <EOR> What disappointment! Maybe time good but any more  Maybe many lost taste buds dont know when something really flavor taste but even if dont very sophisticated taate buds food boring disappointment  <EOR> Blackened catfish very moist great flavor best  But then fried catfish  Both really good tough choice  Great food  Great service  Well worth trip back  <EOR> I chance try place while visiting  customer service excellent  John Lopez manager greeted personally  food great  definitely come back  <EOR> I've establishment random occasions 15 plus years   back last night craving corn meal breaded catfish   luck would sunday nites all eat catfish breaded shrimp   fried heaven come  the decor meh fake waterfall unkempt outside those whoa eat seen kind places but business alot years owing quality food serve   service mediocre best just you'd expect long term mom pop place vegas felt confident no longer compete places strip we ordered all eat night   first served hush puppies now conveniently fried bulllet shaped   WTF? happened old fashioned deep fried round shaped balls corn meal goodness used serve?  guess kitchen finally automation now come artificially formed mini hot dogs   upside served honey sweet butter perfect dipping in   on salad bar cole slaw vintage sweet vinegary salad bar basic but kept thankfully free brown lettuce chunks leftover heads no wants chop up   addition kept salad bar stocked made sure no other add ons i e  no plunkets tomato your ranch dressing carried over some lazy careless guest   hate that    the seafood served hot homemade tartur sauce  serve all eat crab legs mondays worth   if any help tourists saw sun night opted order bucket  working glean every piece meat off small crab legs  ordered off night   All all very filling all romantic nothing memorable but decent food doesn't sick  should count something   As plus catfish very well filleted no worry bone ever which good me  Plus recipe iced T down awesome! Last thing mention all catfish fried shrimp lovers $12 50 all possibly eat Sunday night when don't want cook    Along refillable salad bar  bad spend  <EOR> I remember going child thinking greatest places world  appreciate deep fried food but take deep fried new level  taste food greasy fried  However restaurant very cute cozy  salad bar great expect treated southern hospitality  <EOR> Short Mediocre food best  mostly frozen premade  pretty run down inside  AYCE decent but you're better off nearby buffets better food   Long family long time tradition going place since since opened 70's gone plenty downhill there  don't know if changed owners owner just doesn't care anymore   I've several times last couple years each time disappointment  The last time  last night review  I came opened seated quickly  Luckily seated near window because last time more inside place gets gloomy dark without sunlight  Odd only open night  Walls chipping paint  probably both aesthetically don't paint place  Plates silverware old cheap   The salad bar good example place  Canned food find anywhere  looks put emergency random places couple coolers but years  terrible small buffets better salad bar  Waiter prompt manager kind but bit unmotivated dull  Wednesday ordered AYCE BBQ baby back ribs catfish shrimp fries $15 95  Good price start  Was served special hush puppies which bland best  just fluffed corn bread fried served honey butter  No seasoning nothing inside  Just cornmeal  Dull drab  least free  My food came surprisingly large proportions half rack ribs filet fried catfish couple shrimp side fries  The shrimp butterfly panko style pulled freezer fried  No seasoning served burning hot  Catfish few handmade items menu but just catfish tossed cornmeal fried whitish yellow  golden brown  Oh burning hot  No seasoning marinated even salted  Just cornmeal  Ribs peculiar   much oil draining off them swear deep fried but then grilled second before being served   seasoned    barely seasoning fell off  don't know if marinated smoked couldn't tell  Perhaps they're bag then fried grilled  ordered sauce side good thing too! sauce sweet tomato base  bad but reminded sweet and sour sauce mixed ketchup  Fries shoestring salt pepper  crunchy   I've tried other things all frozen fried seasoned plain dull  Nothing terrible disgusting but just dull white bread   I hungry through couple servings  Each time served only part dish because others weren't ready yet  No extra fries  return service slow   TL DR worth it? Buffets area lunch specials dinners provide better food  Someplace Carnival World buffet Rio  If can't far interested specials    guess here  But don't your way there's nothing special here   2 stars because won't sick  at least fry foods enough  Otherwise recommend going here  <EOR> My family loves catfish all different ways    grandmother huge fan takes company eat any chance she gets   all eat fried shrimp also awesome salad bar offers unique variety items  <EOR> Must admit first time impressed years ago but would b fair hush puppies since back then fried catfish fan  Jump ahead 9 yrs later palete grown w waist size  Hush puppies best catfish ever eaten  coating seasoning reminds fried chicken which good thing luv fried chix  don't care hush puppies wrong texture me  Gumbo good salad bar alright   would again see u their <EOR> Been going years  FIrst time when seven  Now old still KIDS   Great value guys  <EOR> I am delighted say Hush Puppies definitely worth going lunch dinner drive thru   atmosphere nice refreshing feel right home   food wonderful all wanted cat fish shrimp oysters scallops   Cha Cha   so good!  but ate more should   just couldn't stop   my girlfriend Bday  Oct 7th 2016 she never before   the service excellent attentive     Check yourself    guarantee want disappointed     Respectfully Margaret C  <EOR> This place GREAT!

Getting easy   parking lot Hush Puppy HUGE!  park church congregation huge   guess busy days really pack place!   lot fish grease being consumed!  Interior restaurant very eclectic mish mash design features which can't place hands on   Some Native American hints some Asian inspired bamboo yet some Southern accents over there!  Restaurant very spacious inside   large open dining room seems another semi outdoor dining space ? several smaller more intimate rooms families smaller parties     Wifey came thing menu AYCE catfish Hush Puppy popular for!  Wait gluten free catfish!  Even better suppose?  $14 95 person unlimited servings fried farm raised catfish fillets something call fiddlers small whole catfish fried shrimp   combine two choices same price   $13 95 fried freshwater fish fillets which assume still catfish if don't want farm raised   We hard time choosing two options waitress kind enough let sample three most popular fried farm raised catfish fried freshwater fish fried shrimp   nice her!  your AYCE main side French fries   additional $0 50 sub baked potato crawfish rice corn collard greens   With each AYCE meal salad bar comes included   Now salad bar no means find your local Sweet Tomatoes more akin Cici's Pizza   tiny but most fixings would find basic salad   gem two though   green tomato salad relish salad bar?  Delish!  House made coleslaw?  Tasty!  Also salad bar don't forget helping or two freshly made tartar sauce very good pairs well your fried goodies!  Also each meal your table basket complimentary hush puppies   really different though aren't round kind Long John Silver's   Something special more oval shaped very light inside   Delicious some included honey butter!  Beats plain roll  sure   Didn't take very long AYCE meals arrive maybe 20 minutes so   Fried items nice fresh!  Luckily Hush Puppy changes its oil frequently tell   Everything golden brown greasy light batter catfish shrimp wasn't heavy   Farm raised catfish fillet great very flavorful light cornmeal based breading   freshwater catfish fillet good milder flavor but still tasty   Both excellent squeeze fresh lemon dash Tabasco another dash some malt vinegar dip into tartar sauce!  fried shrimp probably least favorite item AYCE came fried right but breading tad heavy   More shrimp please less bread!  almost seem kind buy your local big box superstore industrial packed ready cook   Wifey managed second plate AYCE goodness before she hit wall   third plate but both those contained only fried farm raised freshwater catfish fillets   imagine all gluten avoided during meal   smite Celiac disease!  Although sure those French fries didn't help   The Hush Puppy overall pretty reasonable   same price Red Rock Casino buffet street Charleston lot more bang your buck   same fried shrimp think!  much larger salad bar!  But AYCE catfish deal Hush Puppy hard beat   back again sample Southern goodness talked owner he said come back Wednesday nights when AYCE BBQ ribs catfish shrimp around $16   steal   He also said next time need save some room fried green tomatoes slice house made Georgia pecan pie   Damn getting hungry just thinking it!
