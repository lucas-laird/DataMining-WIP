 The Basil Noodle probably favorite three dishes   kind pad kee mao but thinner noodles different sauce   sliced mushrooms thinly sliced green red bell peppers onions Chinese broccoli  sauce very light lightly sweet   Although tasted nothing pad kee mao flavor sort resembles Thai dish style     The Ayam Rendang quite interesting   chicken bone covered thick red curry sauce   very lightly spicy compared Thai food Indian food kind Indian curry flavor but lot lighter your typical Indian curry   quite enjoyed well particular because don't heavier Indian curry styles   ice over bed white rice     The Pineapple shrimp little pricey but served half pineapple husk fresh pineapple   flavor very light tad sweet   kind breakfast dish me   don't know if would order again just little bit bland tastes but pineapple presentation amazing     Overall even CASH ONLY rule place rockin   would definitely again   If Thai food Indian food just little much would definitely recommend trying Malaysian food toned down spice flavor department   Very nice!! <EOR> I eat girlfriend dad whenever occasion arises   both Malaysian only place he deems worthy going to   food hit miss depending order   maybe 4 times would give different rating each time based food but say ranks solid 3 5 overall   The best dishes far big tofu shrimp sorry very accurate lamb curry crunchy circle thing seafood inside again sorry descriptions    okra liking   also deep fried jumbo shrimp but its fried skin still which entirely edible despite being deep fried   Also workers son sits corner all day watches DVDs   He's known many locals often plays kids patrons eat lot case kids   I try update names numbers dishes  <EOR> I wanted some Asian food decided having Malaysian  pretty good waiters spoke cantonese which made experience interesting because kept describing dishes me  spicy laksa thick rice starch noodles sour spicy soup filled fish flakes fermented shrimp paste  being said if fermented shrimp paste REPEAT DISH  smell almost overwhelming however soup good balance between salty sour spicy  would liked more heat but over all dish pretty good  think next time try stir fried noodles dishes because some dishes friends ordered looked really good  roti canai thin crepe like bread curry good atypical expectations actually piece chicken curry other places just give small dish curry  curry savory again expected little more heat but overall still favorite appetizers  would come again if craving  <EOR> I don't know why busy when night  very big dinning area food good  surprised except only 1 other table there   I ordered Hainanese chicken course really good  But fiancé dark meat one  All he bones very big difference when white meat vs  dark meat  <EOR> You disappointed Penang   sat down table told waiter want something great only restaurant nowhere else Las Vegas  He pointed menu photo orange looking mix curry stir fry type stuff Penang title said yes   Know showed table?
