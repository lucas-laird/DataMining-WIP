Just remember wrapped moist wax paper tender morsels clinging corn husk  bite did regret only chicken chile  tamales stuffed overflowing juicy spicy chicken tart green sauce thin tender savory sweet masa shell  Every bite heaven!  At 1 50 each absolute steal! service quick counter staff friendly  currently no seating expect takeaway  travel well consider grabbing half dozen dinner  can't wait stop again next trip through Vegas! <EOR> I born raised Southwest tamales best ever had  trying many restaurants Las Vegas very disappointed every tamale until trying Patty's  going back often recommend try amazing tamales  <EOR> The only thing menu tamales  should because good would fool order anything else  also relatively cheap  Legit tamales hard find look no further place em  <EOR> Tamales favorite food  delivers craving! store bare besides counter order  menu straightforward 8 options choose from  chicken green sauce amazing! am looking forward trying other flavors  Especially sweet tamale pineapple! man working counter very nice welcoming  am definitely going back! <EOR> I've reading reviews Patty's love tamales today running errands area decided give them try   First impression arrived around 10 55am  Upon entering first thing took notice of and any restaurant food establishment even grocery stores floors  pet peeves   to walk into business sells food see floors sticky dirty just plain unkempt  Well must say case Patty's  Floors spotless talking pristine  Windows crystal clear  counter clean wiped down  upon looking back open kitchen could see work area place the stove top held food order definitely met expectations cleanliness wise    I approach counter am greeted acknowledged man possibly owner?  begin scanning menu which simple appreciate that  then ask please give opinion green chicken tamales regards spiciness level because I'd read through yelp reviews green chicken overboard spicy  Well he did confirm super super spicy  prefer green sauce over red other reviewer's commented red sauce mild green sauce hot  But while love little heat majority dishes eat cannot handle much heat  much becomes unenjoyable really fast me  Anyways decided just giving red sauce chicken tamales try  ordered two  Price $2 each totaling $4 no tax  bad all! guy took order back stove where tamales kept humongous stock pots retrieved two tamales  could see steam emanating them  Exciting!!   I thought man took order very welcoming professional just based first impression alone I'd consider returning especially if food par well  He asked if lived area if first time visiting Patty's he did treat customer feel should treated think any customer would want treated   So left course tried tamales I'd purchased once arrived home  tamales decent size small any means  They're also heavy just another indicator huge size  always plus  Next unwrapped corn husks delved in  inside tamales packed chicken mild red sauce  thought tasted just should  meat wasn't dry did flavor  masa my favorite part tamale! also flavorful but most important thing meat masa ratio which perfecto! much chicken vice versa  taste good enjoyed it   As mentioned above love chicken tamales! If or when should say am craving I'd certainly consider coming back here  customer service addition freshness food speedy service price $2! large tamale? Uh yeah! cleanliness place definitely warrants second visit me  Although say other reviewers have sit in restaurant  take only just another reminder me    To sum pleasant experience me  If tamales happen East side I'd suggest pay them visit  <EOR> Very good clean friendly staff  God bless shop  Thank Yelp spot lighting shop  I'd never found  Summer in  <EOR> Today first visit patty's tamales gentleman took girl friends order very nice took order very prompt tell u tamales bomb ordered 4 chicken tamales red sauce very meaty juicy tender most all dry ther very moist delicious  thanks Javier your excellent customer service <EOR> amazing delicious tamales  couldnt wait them home  smell gets first then bite into tastes smells amazing  <EOR> I cant say im huge fan tamales but love tamales Patty's  highly recommend calling ahead find when theyre finish cooking fresh batch but if your anything you'll just pop see they're cooking   first visit lucky enough purchase couple green chili chicken tamales  1  sold all other ones  2  fresh right pot  Cant wrong fresh! literally burned leg when set bag down oncd car  Most importantly melted into mouth  squeezed masa chicken green chili goodness freezer pop amazing!

Okay good    Since Cali born raised mexican food obsessed person recommend giving them try  $2 00 each but well worth because HUGE  People complain them being $2 00 probably never bought them before  mean those mini street tacos $2 00 each nowhere near size tamales eat 6 those little things full  But enough rant don't let price discourage you  only drawback charged extra $1 00 use card didn't tell me  But knew before while read previous reviews  Just think  something customers aware ahead charging card    I returning customer am extremely satisfied place  <EOR> I would rather buy frozen tamales Albertsons! worth price  Don't really people say good couldn't eat tell salsa salsa      just gross!! <EOR> First things first   ta masas    know mean tamales made almost completely masa   aren't them   Good sized packed full yummy goodness 1 50 piece good deal   fam tried Chicken Green Chile spicy    first choice but nearly everything else   kidding   quite spicy but delicious nonetheless  knocked off star due having full experience other flavors would primary choices   look forward trying other flavors possibly upping score   If find yourself need tamales need check place out  <EOR> The best Vegas green chicken tamales favorite but if can't handle spicy suggest red mild tamales <EOR> This place delicious!!
