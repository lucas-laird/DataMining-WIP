Bread key making any good sandwich great can't give experience any more 3 stars   There sign said cash only but when asked girl register she said accept credit cards purchases over $8  <EOR> My nail lady told Banh Mi place  craving Vietnamese dessert when used live Orange County! it little small place gentlemen served very pleasant  they nice selection asian sandwiches Lee sandwich   Famous Vietnamese coffee well  they some pickled veggies pork rolls steamed banana leaves  i bought 2 che vietnamese dessert ok  their sandwich good  <EOR> Don't scared curiously unfortunate sounding name since typically don't evoke images German concentration camps when bite into heavenly Vietnamese sandwiches banh mi     place came highly recommended Vietnamese colleague when two friends town needing quick bite before hitting road took them inconspicuous hole wall greeted pleasant guy behind counter recommended grilled pork meat ball beef banh mi was intrigued sardine fried egg chinese sausage offerings     I appreciated fact some tasty Asian beverages fridge including Thai iced tea chrysanthemum tea sweetened soy milk   also option refreshing glass vietnamese coffee sweetened condense milk if need caffeinated pick up     The first thing need know bake own French baguettes every 45 minutes getting warm crusty chewy roll encases your choice meat pickled veggies daikon carrot meat pate garnished cilantro jalapeno   owner happily honored request cut sandwiches thirds could sample all three     The grilled pork irresistably crispy sweet glazed exterior beef butter knife tender well cooked filet meatball broken down spread engulfed sauce only described lovechild sweet sour sauce marinara   All three sandwiches share everything could hope sandwich contrasts texture chewy bread vs  creamy pate vs  tender meat vs  crunchy veggies temperatures warm bread vs  hot meat vs  cold veggies flavors saltiness tartness sweetness SPICINESS   respect those jalapenos!    would give 5 stars if slightly more meat balance bread but sure could potentially negotiated upon ordering     price mere 3 dollars 5 dollar footlong Subway would actually considered scam both price quality product   two compadres pleased both bought extra sandwich road at 3 dollars could resist?      Definitely worth checking if hankering banh mi need change pace your typical sandwich offerings Vegas  <EOR> Great food  Great prices  only issue run food quite often   alright opinion  should come earlier if want everything available  All bread fresh made daily  plus book  Being former baker myself fresh bread matters most  Overall good joint quick bites <EOR> This place isn't perfect but doesn't be  visited countless times past few years always drop banh mi fix whenever back home Vegas  Tried almost every sandwich menu but #1 dac biet always #1  Great mix meats perfect meat veg bread ratio  Bread hit miss depending time day sometimes stale but if you're lucky fresh baked man oh man heavenly   Also try Vietnamese coffee  Some tastiest iced coffee ever perfect amount sweetness every time  Yes mostly ice but cares  Coffee's strong it'll smack awake!  Definitely cheap eat around $4 per item especially when sandwiches length your forearm  Mix match full meal  all buy 5 1 free! <EOR> This place somewhat tucked away corner primarily Asian strip mall  Parking easy enough but most people phone in orders  menu small but straight point  If you'd eat inside there's small table only two chairs  sandwiches huge but definitely little bit oily side  bread crunchy outside but still remains soft inside  Meat tender vegetables fresh  cook everything back behind wall but seems clean enough  really pork sandwich prefer place over Mr  Sandwiches Dakao seems much faster service since don't try much menu   still trying compare Huong Lan Sandwiches San Jose my personal favorite bay area but boyfriend thinks really no true comparison which you're mood for  <EOR> I love beef style bahn mi's  many locations carry which probably means popular but can't help like  favorite place Cali picky terrible  used sautéed onions which sure if liked but did taste ok should put some more veggies more cilantro  defiantly comeback     The two biggest issues don't take American Express  Since baguette thin definitely need two 1 enough filling lunch  why wish more veggies help fill up  But 4 bucks guess can't complain  <EOR> I love Vietnamese fun food only place Vegas it owner nice food awesome price right  <EOR> I think best meatball sandwich town! Also called Banh Mi Xiu Mai Sometimes bread bit hard but besides vegetables meat sandwich taste great fresh especially jalapeños  also various Vietnamese snacks meals sell top counter too  Service very quick nice  only bad part place there's only two small tables expect seat eat at  sandwich shop more ideal those want food quick go  <EOR> Hyped Dakao did expect LOVE Bánh mi much did  Very unassuming spot set boy sandwiches rock  Tried house special traditional Bánh mi grilled pork both all veggies perfectly crunchy bread made perfect 'wich  ratio bread ingredients perfected flavors sandwich itself actually possible bite through because crunchy good quality bread  Don't wrong sandwiches getting 5 stars being novel culinary masterpieces gets 5 stars because simple easy exactly should be  No silly experimentation unnecessary changes fresh well prepared meat veggies most reasonable price point possible  If you're craving flavors Bánh mi want best quality no frills authentic version outside Vietnam look no further  Take away assumed  If you're eating sandwich later day ask veggies side stay fresh crisp throughout day  <EOR> Damn really wanted place but literally no meat mostly bread sucks <EOR> If your bánh mì sandwiches delicate fillings stuffed into thin crispy baguette then Dakao right your alley  favorites vegetarian chay special ?ac biet  slightly oily perfectly salty bánh giò pretty special too  green colored xôi crushed peanut better red stuff mom home  two tables inside few chairs scattered though better carryout deli  <EOR> This place solid located 3 miles further down away strip compared main part china town  Also reading bad reviews Lee's sandwiches decided give place shot  corner shopping center definitely mom pop  tried two banh mi pork beef both tasty  appears bake own bread  Also banh mi might longest ever eaten  getting your monies worth  Gf also tried shrimp spring rolls those good she said  Only negative worker cashier might lil questionable calculator bill  he didn't give any change lol  Good place though  <EOR> Okay Okay  keep coming back place  just LOVE crispy light bread is!
