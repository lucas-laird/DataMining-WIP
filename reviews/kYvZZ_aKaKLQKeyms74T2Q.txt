Service started great  Even when food taking bit long waiter Noe came over apologized very attentive    The food ok  pre meal chips beans salsa excited meal  margarita wasn't strong should given large size but good    Our meal going great until large party arrived  wasn't your average large party  No brought little children approximately 8  between ages 2 6  Now children patience when needed within certain limit  But when child begins screaming running parent even trying control said child? But now remember said children  first just little annoying what's sound interrupting thoughts kind annoying  But once aware screaming child seems amplify seconds by    Interestingly enough realized parties around starting become annoyed  Then wait staff all fidgety looking annoyed yet uncomfortable say anything avoiding eye contact if hoping ignoring noise would just stop  began channel friend Brianna occasional stop it! getting good laugh fam but wasn't enough forget banshee noises coming other room  Needless say could take no longer asked waiter ask manager please say something    As suspected afraid say anything  understand wanting upset large group especially when most plates over $10 server work service industry  However when children running room room adults chasing them wild chickens might want attempt control situation  However manager Noe did come over apologize offer free dessert  couldn't mad all can't really control other people children  wasn't fault no home training  He even bussed table hand delivered dessert    Back food Cimichanga de Camarones shrimp cheese enchilada  enchilada more flavor chimichanga but deep fried tortilla    My aunt two tacos chicken beef  She said missing the grease lol  She even put spicy salsa them add extra flavor    My mom sis no complaints fajitas chicken dish   Free dessert spoon should always offered ice cream  Especially when yummy chocolate cake vanilla!   All all could great experience should able enjoy good food drinks conversation but unfortunately evening sullied wild children oblivious parents  can't fault manager duty because owners probably don't train proper etiquette control potential bad situations    Would return? Maybe but anytime soon  There's many options city honest better Mexican food  looking forward leftovers in front couch no screaming children though! <EOR> Great food  Outstanding service! clearly work well coordinated team  Definitely back  <EOR> Best mexican food Las Vegas!

Why some people think ok subject others poor nonexistent parenting choices? <EOR> The food good  Staff nice  Just little surprised Michelob $3 50 but michelada Michelob w glass side half filled w Clamato $6 50 <EOR> Mediocre food bad but definitely great  Lacks attentive knowledgeable service  Server lacked short term memory  table ask several times same item  <EOR> What actual F?

Cons A little spend y Mexican restaurant usually think Mexican cheap eats  A little loud first date similar chit chat  No mild salsa option table I'd say medium which cool but might everyone's bag   bowl   container your choice    *A side note service great but did forget bring side guacamole forgot mention oversight when bill came forgot check see if charged double fail me!  Overall place win totally again  <EOR> The awesome workers best ever met bratty kids free soup  complaint very slow food massive line  <EOR> Anyone knows knows am Mexican food snob  live NM cuisine nor duplicated anywhere else  when someone invites Mexican food normally become dismayed  Well place wonderful  authentic NM cuisine however excellent Mexico Mexican food  enjoyed shredded beef chimmy red n green  came beans rice which amazing beans n rice  also enjoyed guacamole salsa which great  three at last count tried other locations pricey  Period  location great  Service great! <EOR> Sadly disappointed   First all when walked stench bathrooms very present   change tables could breath   I ordered steak fajitas bit pricey food haven't but took chance $18 95 husband ordered fish tacos   disappointed! meat tender but absolutely no flavor tried beans rice guacamole all same Flavorless! ever refried beans didn't like     I thrown away much money Vegas trying find good Mexican food back Oakland Bay Area  frustrating   I give up  Anybody heard Mexicali Rose Oakland?  kind flavor looking for   The presentation good steak sizzling thought more onions peppers anything   brought 2 small flour tortillas no cheese ask pico de galo again flavorless meal $18 95   I would advise anyone wanting Mexican food try Javier's inside Aria   old school authentic but good if don't mind paying bit more  <EOR> Pretty good Mexican but am honestly spoiled living SoCal  know better but this'll do   Stopped insistence friend before hit strip club build regrets  pleasantly pleased vegetarian options  chose Veggie Fajita plate huge portion perfectly seasoned veggies and just broccoli some salsa actual squash mushrooms onions etc made pretty decent dish   Beans ok  Rice bomb  Tortillas obviously homemade  wanted more but did need more? Absolutely not    Price pretty fair think paid $15? including tip   I'd come back but think I'd burrito next time  <EOR> Man dont know but lately having bad experiences  Last place good food but bad service  both bad service bad food  Im hoping next place dont bad anything    So wifey come thursday around 9 15 pm late dinner  Since guys close 11 thinking should decent service decent food well   What Carne Asada Plate $18 95   thinly cut New York steak  Comes refried beans rice guacamole flour tortillas  wife Shredded Beef Enchilada $4 50 off la carte menu   Before order comes given basket chips bean dip salsa munch while waited  guess really hungry because devoured minute  all other Mexican restaurants assumed things endless  server walked couple times refill drinks he never refilled chips dip  maybe wrong assumption  Until saw next table another batch  Hmmmm  Sad say chips salsa only things great flavor   We main entrees looks delicious  But turns steak bland  only things any kind flavor plate grilled jalapeno small spoonful guacamole  dip steak little left salsa provided chips  wife's enchilada ok but obvious microwaved evidenced some enchilada sauce surrounding burrito crusted  know when any kind sauce gets microwaved long? Yup  Thats parts sauce were    Service just tad below mediocre  think table next chips salsa refilled twice  say could ate much well but said before used places constantly refilling those things without hesitation  also took while check receipt come back sign it    So closing maybe just came wrong time? Maybe need original location off Desert Inn? If hopefully food service much better  Until then im sure if want come back particular location   Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #146 Should just ordered chips salsa <EOR> Best cocktails town! michelada cocktail completely satisfied  shrimp cocktail very fresh fair amount dish  Also great know there's restaurant Vegas used more just clamato mix micheladas   only down side price little higher used to <EOR> Usually big fan guess menu different locations  intentions having tortilla soup instead caldo de pollo because didn't tortilla soup  All ate vegetables because chicken tasted weird overall wasn't happy dinner  <EOR> Large authentic Mexican food  However food just ok opinion  service slow  <EOR> Don't waste your time  Service slow sucked guy just seemed he didn't want there   Chips tasted old guacamole  tasteless   Soup tastes dishwater food just bland   Shrimp over cooked just little tiny pieces    It real disappointment another back to  <EOR> The first time sister took ordered chevice thought going just okay didn't hopes up  ordered some drinks but didn't even drink them until ate chevice because amazing stuffed myself eating it  shared maybe bite stay hour finish drinks  don't live Nevada stomach always thinking place trying substitute flavor until back but nothing gets until visit  <EOR> I really place  Service amazing!
