I mostly wish bit more variety standard toppings given  comes 2 pieces chashu egg just tons tons green onion menma  would loved swap half few chunks garlic sliver nori   The chashu really really good though  thicker fattier style usual round slices similar texture kakuni  held very well against broth  felt bit luxurious haha type pork normally eat rice   Overall would stop again if area  <EOR> We shoyu ramen really didn't think anything special  broth fine pork belly good quality  But didn't really any kind addicting wow factor delicious ramen has  terrible but underwhelming compared reviews  <EOR> What cute ramen bar! Loved sitting bar watching noodles made  GREAT ramen simple exactly wanted  new favorite spots sure  ladies or guys hella long hair hair ties available bar lean over your bowl stress free shed! <EOR> Just right flavors ramen  Authentic pleasant taste  going again  Menu little work progress just opened  Keeping hopes high   They torch chashu here! <EOR> Breakfast time #vegas ! Worked til 4am just need  place clean menu simple but means many selection  No MSG  Ramen light simple compare most  own noodles provide hair ties customers they more thoughtful most yoga studio? 6 10 book  <EOR> Came second time Thursday evening when friend found place something new try  She hasn't before wanted try tonkotsu since didn't last time     We seated pretty quickly upon arrival 1st two seats closest entrance  still filled empty space behind bar area  Wonder if plans area o O would kind waste if didn't huh granted don't exactly close personal experience you'd bar  As mentioned before wanted try tonkotsu did friend  both essentially same thing but noticed slight change menu now  $2 extra noodles ! HEHE ! quite long day excitement opt'ed extra noodles course  said served noodles separately when ready separate bowl placed into your soup    We received food pretty quickly  usual every ramen comes bamboo 2 slices chashu green onions half tamago  chef's saw taking pictures ramen told WAIT !!!! piled green onions bamboo  He took jar housemade chili sauce took spoonful placed artistically top jar next bowl ramen  HAHA ! then took half chili sauce plopped into ramen  course tasted tonkotsu before mixing chili sauce  tonkotsu surprise tastes completely different any other tonkotsu ever had  Much less creamy lighter tasting but thats extent speculation broth  Never expected taste different  it? honestly don't know  dislike it? Definitely not  different  May take few more times dissect flavors decision    As mentioned before nearing end noodles chef asked if ready extra noodles  saying yes he prepare extra noodles  he cooked noodles water saw he put noodles into bowl mixed something  Sesame oil maybe? prior coming over pouring noodles into bowl  flavor tonkotsu broth couldn't tell if sesame oil but did see extra amount oil appeared    Another good bowl noodles place  Looking forward them having different noodles future ! <EOR> Great little ramen joint!!! Modern decor friendly service host chefs across bar! Though many brilliant ramen places town   far reminds most last time visited Japan! definitely come back try recommendation chicken Tonkatsu ! <EOR> Serviceable but great    many fine Ramen Joints town recommend before one   setup cool long bar facing kitchen service quick friendly    but Ramen just ok  <EOR> Paitan Ramen chicken broth version Tonkotsu     New Ramen joint Hashi Ramen favorite far Vegas   Why love Hashi Ramen? Coz just plain simple Fresh made noodles broth just well balance    Also Ramen Hashi's Shio Shoyu Ramen good Monta Ramen now days sometimes broth salty Jinya Ramen good but all flavored ramen tho Sora Ramen also good but broth porky last Ramen Tetsu good also BUT broth could better tho      Giving Ramen Hashi 4 star coz don't Gyoza Chicken Karaage other side orders unlike other Ramen Joints <EOR> The problem all ramen shops opening Las Vegas all them close being same exact thing   much comparison between them all hardly ramen all   because really compare same toppings broth appetizers?    Tonight Chloe said don't even know which ramen shop your favorite mom  She's right  choose?  Nothing stands out  Maybe Monta because first love?  But definitely because flavor noodles different rest     Ramen Hashi did opposite all new ramen shops Vegas simplified menu  3 broth choices all same toppings choice add extra already comes with   didn't expect anything different other places offer terms flavor but wrong     I ordered chicken broth black garlic oil extra egg   broth light flavorful black garlic oil added smokey flavor it  tastes homemade  salty nowhere near bland     The owner stopped while eating told much time takes all ingredients all homemade recipes scratch   love it   finally favorite ramen shop!  sure place soon 30 minute wait but well deserved  <EOR> Small place seating along side  Minimal no decor but doesn't matter  ramen great  all matters  wish tried ramen black garlic but next time Vegas come back that  <EOR> First all really doesn't any MSG  ordered chicken base ramen already comes half ajitama egg green onion two things normally come ramen baby bamboo also taste better other ramen places  best thing no MSG soup finish soup without craving 10 glasses water afterward  only place ramen now on  10 10 <EOR> This beyond shadow doubt favorite ramen place Las Vegas   Ramen easy 5 5  matter fact sans Chashu Don Ice Cream sandwich place only serves chicken based broth ramen  whole menu little sheet paper fill when giving your order  add ons your ramen but  pretty much it   I always order Tori Paitan Ramen + Black Garlic Oil side Asahi  Excellent tasting broth chashu torched add texture crunch bamboo shoots taste great smell green onions add lovely tang   The place only does ramen bar but wide  Super clean super comfortable  waitress regularly checks chefs sure you're doing ok  Other everything else self service which believe translates into no pressure no rush environment   5 5 everything  ramen place  <EOR> House made Ramen noodles fall apart pork Ramen Hashi must try    thin pale ramen absorbs broth maintains nice chew  tonkatsu broth rich pork flavor stands alone without any additions  Really rich deep flavors pork memorable  Shiro based ramen simple IMO gets nice flavor boost scoop garlic oil   Ramen resembles dish's humble beginnings without all Americanized flavors   Seating bar style reminiscent Japan  seating somewhat limited doesn't really accommodate large parties here  <EOR> Tried new ramen spot tonight west china town delicious! believe just opened few weeks ago but did disappoint  tried shoyu chicken broth ramen chashu don bowl  broth truly tasty  pork pieces thick flavorful  die hard monta fans but wanted see if another ramen spot could compare  Ramen Hashi exceeded expectations  return! <EOR> I decided try place without really looking menu  place itself cool little bar no tables very warm atmosphere  noticed menu does really vegetarian option asked server which then asked chef he extremely nice accommodating  Although no broth could fit bill he still made bowl mixture noodles seaweed egg tamago bamboo shoots  really good exactly needed  wish did vegetarian broth nonetheless bowl delicious really appreciated them accommodating me  <EOR> I'm fan soup since growing Asian household where soup life  Took fiancé cold Sunday afternoon  both something different  Shio she tori paitan  cook told use vinegar shio good  shio broth good pork tender just down right good  tori paitan thicker brother but good  second favorite ramen place town  <EOR> One best ramen tasted  salty no msg  Chasu bowl also good  already cut pork belly into small pieces  <EOR> Hashi newest ramen house enter Vegas game best noods! stand having lighter chicken based broth keeps classic dish feeling quite heavy filling  house special shio good lunch choice added egg nori  offer black garlic oil add on sounds amazing $1   However only thin noodles prefer thicker cut  Also chashu inconsistent containing more fat edible protein being tender elsewhere  Fast friendly but first pick  <EOR> Great little ramen house! crazy busy others city   Definitely worth look  <EOR> A new establishment Chinatown  Family owned friendly  Seating traditional Japanese ramen houses isn't cluttered gimmicks distractions  shio ramen amazing salty filled rich chicken flavor  staff very nice chef suggested different ways eating ramen which made feel more welcoming  Since many ramen shops choose Vegas pleasant break unnecessary specialty ramens forget true ramen should taste like  <EOR> Space less 20 seats ramen bar  Besides aren't tables  If party bigger 4 may hard find seat but definitely impossible  Service The staff friendly four people working here  Each doing something different whether cooking meat making noodles prepping food serving guests  friendly check you  tell they're of   Price It $9 everything but if want extras costs $1 $3 additional items   *you usually add anything* Food We tried ramen different soups well chashu don which rice bowl  put ton meat rice bowl seaweed totally worth price  think if small appetite share two people  Notes Their noodles soup home made no MSG added  <EOR> The tonkatsu ramen black garlic oil nori extra tamago amazing  Definitely add black garlic oil must! Everything prepared fresh scratch  definitely worth coming back to  Customer service excellent truly loved experience  chefs super helpful really care customers  simple place small menu but ramen delicious  noodles freshly made well pork  soft boiled egg perfectly made isn't overly seasoned  would recommend coming here  <EOR> This far best Ramen Vegas! All ingredients including noodles made house  staff always friendly remembers whenever come in! <EOR> When weather calls rainy days especially Vegas gotta ramen   or excuse when notice new opened The layout store great if going yourself your significant other  bar setup don't expect any tables    The service great chef even brought spicy paste since mentioned liked spicy  open kitchen see everything being prepared   The place overall clean seatings just limited    Ordered shio ramen refreshing  broth felt clean light didn't feel consume water next three days because meal alone   We when still grand opening sign hoping visit again soon see if quality consistent ! <EOR> Very good Ramen place  No tables only big balcony  Very informal  Highly recommended <EOR> Whether don't other established ramen places Spring Mountain like Monta Ramen Sora etc  would highly recommend trying Ramen Hashi  probably new favorite places ramen now when crave cold day  very indecisive when comes ordering sometimes actually glad menu rather small more simple  9$ gets bowl ramen includes two chashu pork slice tamago egg bamboo green onion your choice broth  currently three broth options shio chicken based w salt shoyu chicken based w soy sauce tonkotsu pork based w soy sauce   shio which chef's recommendation but actually liked boyfriend's broth more which tonkotsu  Shio lighter side tonkotsu more creamier side it  Ramen bar seating only  Service food very fast appreciate all staff patient even chefs interactive you  Water napkins condiments all set self serve style bar   Everything looks feels clean  Even broth tastes clean w no MSG all  first bit hesitant try place since pork looked all fatty but tried definitely bad thought actually great balance between meat fat  Loved torched crisp too  Same building complex Hobak  <EOR> A very simple menu only 3 items choose exception rice bowl appreciate open concept bar kitchen  The food isn't wow knock amazing but bad   <EOR> Simple menu  that   Less items means better quality   But case    I ordered Tonkotsu ramen opted extra onsen egg because doesn't love semi runny egg ramen right?  Ok where things bad   I take sip broth wasn't even warm   The broth tasted straight boiled pork water just little hint salt  I poke onsen egg reveal yolk more medium boiled onsen egg  Finally chasu pork more firm usual fall off the chopsticks pork pieces enjoy ramen  fatty part also hard  I didn't finish bowl  Go Fukumimi order bowl Tonkotsu shio ramen  won't disappointed  If pay ramen! <EOR> Do dare say this?    ramen tastes better more well known Monta tonkatsu ramen which fave forever  charred pork slightly runny egg garlic oil perfectly seasoned broth Ramen Hashi's ramen simply divine  menu pretty simple service pretty good considering host also served waiter drink master   outfit definitely needs more help but main chef pays lot attention detail feel ramen dish presented meticulously crafted   tonkatsu ramen garlic oil extra bamboo extra green onions which $10   Hubby chicken based tonkatsu loved it   Although beverage selection limited all served smile  Nice decor   really great place large parties bar only 20 spaces no tables  Great quick lunch small parties  <EOR> Walked into ramen Hashi fabulous  let all friends know incredible food  visiting again  <EOR> This place just opened delicious!! best ramen shops to  chefs very friendly kind  also very beautifully decorated inside including restrooms! definitely coming back again <EOR> Won't ever again   Broth thin minimal flavor   Staff seems hate job  <EOR> Omg yes! hubby wanted Ramen Friday night told rethink because Sora would busy  He insisted saw little gem decided where we'd want eat  While never Japan imagine ramen experience like  bar setting open kitchen  noodles scratch very clean  ordering system consists paper where check off you'd handed chefs see them working right front you  water ready stainless steel pitcher  Yay having continually ask water your waitress  food amazing! broth good salty  chasu amazing light torch give extra crispyness  Soft boiled egg done perfection  Ugh!!!!!! hubs chasu bowl yummy well! staff gets 6 5 stars customer service  very nice welcoming  hostess along really well baby kept him busy while ate  She also encouraged him to eat drink more which tough  haha  definitely back here  imagine once place gets attention food service warrants wait times insane!

I absolutely love Tori ramen  some amazing places Japan New York actually better your standard tonkotsu ramen  blasphemy say chicken tastes better pork?  Hashi definitely does solid version Tori ramen  broth nice round flavor without being salty  noodles made house  think gives them better consistency when they're made same climate which they're served  noodles more al dente chewy consistency  Theirs ever slightly soft but decent nonetheless  chashu nice thick super tender  egg perfect soft boil addition poached egg quite nice well  black garlic add on also very tasty    We many decent ramen places Vegas now solid Tori ramen shop  happy! <EOR> Seems only ramen place offers shio  Which light chicken broth based ramen  lot Americans shio but definitely taste  noodles good texture  torched chasiu smoky touch which unique light broth  But bamboos bit sweet doesn't really whole picture    The interior just all chairs along open kitchen  hope busy worry seating arrangements soon?

Location located Spring Mountain between Lindell Jones right next Hobak Korean BBQ  Easy spot  plenty parking front  also parking space back if need it    Decor simple Japanese zen feeling  came Monday soft opening Friday room filled chair tables yet but plenty seats bar  open concept dining place  could see ramen noodle being made scratch prepped cooked  Bathroom also clean smells good sanitary important !   Menu chef mentioned specialty Shio Ramen chicken based broth salt   However also offer Shoyu Ramen chicken soy sauce based broth Tonkotsu Ramen pork soy sauce based broth if strong thick soup base   If craving rice pork charsu don braised pork seaweed egg   ramen comes green onion two pieces pork charsu takenoko cuts seasoned bamboo shoot half egg  No black mushroom ramen  Other sides toppings available if would add more    We tried Shio Ramen okay me  reason because ramen did black mushrooms Tokyo for real! give them four stars  Maybe because am fan tonkotsu shio broth taste little bland me? However noodle cooked perfectly delicious  did savor Tonkotsu Ramen  thought pork broth perfect  heavy fatty nor oily salty  chef mentioned he does use any MSG any cooking  While cooking all delectable flavorful leave thirsty feeling afterwards   I thought interesting torched pork charsu before served it  Definitely added delicate smoky flavor love its taste! Spicy lover don't forget add home made garlic chili paste  Fyi SPICY    Service five stars  chef friendly explained menu very well us    They calpico but beers options limited  working adding more items menu  hopefully more exciting new flavors coming soon including charsu fried rice gyoza  recommendations add Tsukemen Hiyashi Chuka cold ramen menu  Vegas those two perfect noodle dishes summer    Check ramen place worth trying  back again some more ramen  <EOR> This new favorite ramen spot  everything scratch here  let tell tastes way sure  bowls aren't super large but flavor  Tonkotsu broth rich creamy  sampled before mixed black garlic oil which just made much better  pork chashu tonkotsu bowl made sweet compared chashu shoyu gf had  short tonkotsu extra chashu black garlic oil live unhappy life  <EOR> Super friendly which sometimes rare Chinatown  Fast great portions! kick cute jars bar hair ties long hair struggles when eating ramen   Ramen super flavorful own noodles which plus!  Definitely going back! <EOR> Ramen Hashi does very well attempt giving authentic ramen experience very simplistic yet quality broth based bowl   Their black garlic oil must try any ramen adds Smokey flavor very complimentary broth  particularly really adding favorite tonkatsu  last visit also tried chicken based tonkatsu used substitute traditional pork broth base   and all honesty couldn't tell difference just savory  salty compared competitor ramen joints price portion size just fair affordability priced   Their menu simple order off check sheet list then present your server chef  single bowl ramen comes pre set chashew bamboo shoots green onions half tomago egg   add on's dollar each but highly suggest garlic oil previously mentioned above    The Chefs all very polite entertaining checking all often even joking occasion  If need water more napkins self serve style set everything right bar  saves time effort calling hostess waiting refill   I'd say hashi must good hot bowl Japanese style ramen  <EOR> Been 3x does tell you? Cleanest place China Town Row otherwise known Spring Mountain  Staff amazing open kitchen which gives front row seat cooking noodle making  <EOR> A definite MUST true Ramen lover!   Sure all affinities but Ramen Hashi's Tori Paitan unique flavor  worth trying  those 'what am tasting' good way moment soon broth hits your pallate    Also way cut green onion topping excellent  typical cross stitch cut stalks but more lengthy diagonal cuts add richness Ramen experience    Lastly own noodles fresh!!

Really good hospitality service nice environment nice music recommend !! <EOR> Oh gawd  Best ramen Vegas! ordered Tori paitan delicious  rich lots flavour  <EOR> Woohoo oodles noodles ] Another ramen house arrived!  From outside restaurant looks would lot smaller really is  But entrance down long stretch chairs facing open kitchen Bar style   only seating option no lone tables booths  bad thing though  love vibe ambience gives   This joint very simple  decor layout just purpose  serve good ramen  nice lil place quick bite  Since restaurant bar style kind eatery coming big group wouldn't greatest idea  Having sit row doesn't exactly give chance conversations everyone your group  But if all care having quick meal then come down! LOL  Their menu very simple too  Even though customize your orders feel there's something missing  Selection pretty limited is  However business hasn't open very long knows  menu might revamped new ideas always incorporated  But said before serving delicious ramen main focus  All bring your appetite craving   If you're area give place try  Plus there's boba place right next door dessert  Oh convenience that  Need say more? ] <EOR> Just tried new restaurant  Ramen broth very delicious but very little noodle price compared other ramen places  still hungry  Felt just ate appetizer   Small menu  Service wasn't great  sure if back  <EOR> Wow more impressed? First all if ramen enthusiast then heard shin sen gumi ramen LA j town  Shin sen gumi crown ramen west coast able against shin sen gumi something proud off  tonkatsu ramen soup taste almost identical shin sen gumi blown away  Most establishments really salty weird flavor soup base adding butter garlic more western tongue names would mention   noodle thin style but bit more soft compared shin   owner said he could more chewy if wanted since everything made including noodles  He also said ramen no added msg preservative which surprising hear  mean what? Asian food no msg = mind blown   Now con chashu egg very average  feel meat isn't marinated much sweet  egg bland well hard boiled egg maybe intention accentuate flavor soup  place needs more tables also    So why did give 5 stars based soup noodle no msg place par shin sen gumi  support local family business no longer need la good ramen  primary spot now on  <EOR> Gaaaahhhhhhh daaamnnnnn!!

tried shio broth simple light flavorful  really loved broth given really did taste tonkotsu broth  also added black garlic oil mine because love garlic  didn't hurt ramen better because sure would loved without garlic  noodles good texture taste tell fresh  chashu good ramen  soft smokey flavor because hand torch each piece  really don't know but tell everything home made    I stopped going Monta because broths became salty taste  started Jinya because broths less salty but realized everything flavorful because put bunch extra stuff ramen  Hashi just good ol plain ramen  Simple clean flavorful without all extra crap it  just put basic ramen necessities bamboo shoots green onions chashu tamago    The best thing place finished whole bowl did feel lethargic disgusting afterwards  can't wait come back when weather gets cooler  Love place! <EOR> So far new favorite ramen shop Las Vegas  Located Spring Mountain road all food enthusiasts know love Vegas beyond impressed came back twice visit  cousin tried chicken based shoyu shio their shop speciality both delicious  All parts soup made in house including noodles which rarity ramen scene  pork chashu perfect shio broth your grandma's soup stock level  Simple really rich flavor pretty clear but creamy texture  downing bowls cousin actually dropped visit own grandma whose soup stock best growing up  don't know man just love soup   All ramen starts around $9 include egg already  also Tori Paitan special most days also great  Don't sleep Ramen Hashi place worth trip! <EOR> Delicious meal well worth travel strip  Chashu gets butane flame treatment prior entering bowl   Standard bowl came two pieces extra gives 3 more $3 charge totally worth opinion   Would come again  <EOR> This favorite ramen house  quite drive coming Summerlin but never regret  <EOR> Really enjoyed lunch yesterday chasu flamed right before put your bowl no pork mush! traditional bowl black sesame garlic oil  Oh homemade noodles good  <EOR> Honestly best ramen personally Vegas   I appreciate lighter broth typical US  Most ramen places overdo umami salt which leads really heavy flavor  Hashi aims use fresh ingredients keep broth lighter  all noodles machine front owner told he intends tweak noodles find identity LV ramen scene   At 9 dollars bowl includes half soft boiled egg bamboo shoots chashu pork Hashi very reasonable portion sizing excellent  big little  only nitpick might little much onion sometimes noodles kind twisted together  noticed chef trying loosen them when he prepares order   I mention seem some growing pains tonkatsu wasn't available first day but another time very good  However day pork rice bowl wasn't ready because rice being made  did try mini version pork slightly tough but withhold judgement until try full order   They also spicy seasoning add does add quite kick flavor    This regular destination when want some ramen though honest isn't very often   <EOR> Just ok  Broth salty flavor  Noodles little undercooked  won't coming back place anytime soon  9 bucks bowl salty under cooked noodles  <EOR> I Tori Paitan chicken meat delicious just little black pepper added  Large volume house made noodles also plenty chicken meat made good deal  Asahi draft beer wash down becoming memorable dining experience  Only drawback counter seating barstools no table seating  staff friendly helpful ordering  return sure  <EOR> Ramen Hashi very intimate setting its seating limited bar booth where interact chef watch assemble your bowl delicious ramen  being said generally want small party two less when going place order minimize waiting time   The menu extremely simple precise pick between three broths shio salt based shoyu soy sauce based tonkotsu pork based addition other toppings extra  chef recommended which shio broth added seaweed tamago egg    The ramen probably best while  restaurant itself gives very clear picture walking through streets Tokyo sitting down ramen cart flavorful bowl broth noodles  charm rare find Las Vegas  <EOR> I came tonight dinner very pleased! dining area set bar style where directly face kitchen  brought back memories Ramen Japan where popular    I Shoyu Ramen extra noodles extra chasu did partner  broth light heavy but could just tad more flavor  fact broth Cashu meat weren't salty all  meat well proportioned generous cuts  noodles right al dente consistency thinner side which works  loved fact left place full because ramen never fills up! would definitely keep coming back here  <EOR> Love place multiple times since they're open few months ago  Young owner he remember daughters right when walk every time  <EOR> I eat noodle lunch rice dish western food  I don't care pork broth much cus don't small pork   Other ramen places order miso vegetable shoyu flavor   Here use chicken broth which like  Soup flavorful noodle cook right prefer thicker curly noodle but deal breaker   Fast quick service  <EOR> Garbage service garbage ramen  Very disrespectful your sever say finally took extra minute figure which 4 options wanted  <EOR> This place great Ramen shop customer service really good two chefs both very kind  servings decent food really good especially pork  Love it!! <EOR> My new favorite ramen place! came when first opened thought ordering style fun! bar styled restaurant seating limited good come lunch because gets really busy night  When order little paper menu items customize your ramen with  broth very good loved all toppings!!

 liked noodle fresh reataurant broth real chicken   Definitely enjoyed experience coming back more  <EOR> First time trying ramen found place yelp friend  ramen really good great flavor  But menu confusing someone never ramen before  Pictures things would help ordering  staff nice but don't really explain dish comes don't know comes add  broth could've more hot as temperature Over all good food okay experience  Also chefs made bowl rice that's menu guess? charged 7$    think  kinda expensive <EOR> Came first time weeknight  bit busy wait very small amount time but well worth wait! The seating facing kitchen watch chefs prepare your food  Everything made house including ramen noodles  would highly recommend Tori Paitan black garlic oil  <EOR> The thing sets Hashi apart other ramen places Vegas broth only chicken based don't miso tonkotsu I believe change tonkotsu Tori Paitan recent   house made noodles don't include MSG  They're also bit more expensive Monta Sora $10 11 vs $7 8   At first ideas made skeptical because always believed changing traditional styles cooking accommodate western ideas no msg ruined taste classic Asian foods  However Tori Paitan chicken version tonkotsu creamy flavorful proved wrong  ramen different anything but all elements done well i e  perfectly cooked egg crunchy seared chasu fresh noodles etc  try yourself    The reason giving four stars instead five paper menus mark on  would cool concept but don't give paper directly cook give back server  Every time question server back kitchen leans over counter  even recircle order before giving chef  Because interaction server involved just seems unnecessary really just lazy paper menu instead nice menu where server takes your order  gimmick hinders dining experience instead adding it    Overall liked ramen would come back  hope future add extra seating rid paper menus  <EOR> I've dreaming trying Ramen since saw food channel  chef owner spent time China studying noodle making  boy did pay off  nothing fresh noodles !  Staff explained everything  <EOR> As ramen lover town interested finding great place Vegas discovered new place  glad give chance  friend arrived 12 30 weekday immediately seated because pretty empty inside  Shoyu ramen  chicken broth perfect powerful salty  egg done perfectly other reviews mentioned pork torched front delicious well  really enjoyed in house made noodles    The service excellent  checked frequently  Food brought within 5 minutes ordering  Vegetarians no fear  friend vegetarian initially opted rice bowl requested without meat when he discovered all ramen options meat based  When chef discovered he instead asked if friend would open trying variation vegetarian ramen  could tell extra bamboo seaweed few other ingredients  Hopefully they'll add dish menu eventually because friend said delicious but sure mention if you'd vegetarian option  chef asked recommendations improve dish did appear he truly did want customers enjoy food   Overall fair prices great taste welcome addition Vegas area  <EOR> As city continues grow selection restaurants grows too  Ramen Hashi newest ramen joint open recently  Finally chance give place try pleasantly surprise well everything was  special place Ramen especially coming Hawaii  Ramen grew eating prepared various ways your traditional your infused version  Hawaii accustomed eating Saimin which fusion Japanese Ramen Chinese Mein Filipino Pancit    Ramen Hashi leans toward more traditional ramen  cool aspect restaurant open kitchen every seat house along bar facing kitchen  Condiments provided including pickled ginger stainless steel container personally love  whole process ordering requires fill sheet pencil provided kinda ones DMV  deciding which base toppings want  server forwards your custom order cooks everything prepared fresh including house noodles made site  Wow everything simply delicious  prepared want option ordering extra noodles added once finish your first serving  Which previously extra noodles place bowl rather later on  plus since noodles very soggy broth over time    The menu streamlined complicated but keeping traditional ramen taste  4 different flavors include Shio Shoyu Tonkotsu Chasu Don  Tonkotsu Pork based broth soy sauce  flavor balanced noodles just right texture  come back more especially during cold nights Vegas  Another great addition ever changing foodie scene!  2017 Yelp Review #73 <EOR> A very solid ramen option Spring Mountain!
