Oh my! Definitely give place try! extremely impressed! <EOR> I really enjoyed both dining experiences Table 34   The crowd bit older side but still fun lively atmosphere    We always settle few bottles wine no seemed care dinning partners still well everyone else finished desserts gone home evening!   The servers very attentive knowledgeable wine selection  Great menu wine selection decent prices   It's nice neighborhood spot! <EOR> This very nice smaller establishment  staying Doubletree slightly tempted just walk over Applebee's but instead looked something local  glad did! within walking distance but drove short 3 min hill  Greeted warmly seated immediately Wednesday late night  Bread water brought right away  Next greeted server later offered great advice choice Mediterranean Pizza  Arugula salad fresh lightly tossed fresh vinaigrette  server continued watchful made sure nice evening  would highly recommend restaurant choice anyone within reasonable drive  definitely keep mind future dining Las Vegas  <EOR> Aww name Table 34 could only imagine food almost bland name    No problem give small mom pop Restaurants try   enter little skepticism should greeted seated but instead wait wait wait finally greeted Lori seemed irritated half smile very plain demeanor   She seats wait wait wait   to finally server approach doesn't speak lick understandable plain ENGLISH   Now know Vegas very diverse place lot different people cultures but Americanized restaurant right?? Wrong!!!  food ordered pork chop fatty didn't finish came side Chipotle' mashed potatos flavorless taste dumped salt them wash them down overpriced beverage   Also side mixed veggies oily drenched butter oil couldn't eat   Ok maybe off night no biggie   Onto dessert   ice cream great but tell homemade but rather ordered vendor no biggie ate all it  1 star that   Where start slowly decline stars mediocre food plate presentation   Strike 2 waitress short rude didn't explain menu well sensed irribility when questions strike 3   Strike 4 waitresses waiters glare customers walk away snap towels each other laughing talking Spanish laughing God knows what?  Maybe weren't laughing directly but just uncomfortable sets off bad vibe such nice restaurant much potential decor   Last strike seeing CHEF WES grab beer pop open take drink walk back Kitchen he doesn't care what's going Restaurant   Shame Chef Wes drinking job even if your Restaurant don't drink while working preparing orders while customers your building eating food!  Completely unprofessional NEVER back recommend    Also if hear Lori talk she's such independent strong woman made life more time going vomit Salted Caramel ice cream all over table   guess having very small unknown restaurant flavorless food rude staff can't speak English customers feel home making America   Thank Donald Trump   but hey all just locker room talk right??? <EOR> Normally write reviews  personally believe businesses deserve hear Customer first opportunity right any wrongs read via negative review but realized speaking manager place joke  Stranded random business area wanted try place because listed best Las Vegas  Best poor sanitary conditions lack professionalism common sense? Probably  ordered scallop salad which hair it  brought attention server then flagged down another  short amount time attention server became council 5 6 servers debating hair  Really? Right next table? if taking maybe five steps kitchen discuss situation wasn't common sense  requested speak manager point uncomfortable made feel front house staff would act such way privacy back  manager then came apologized but nerve say just know cook salad nearly bald  if matters? hair dyed blonde  think feel comforted hair didn't come cook? wouldn't even eat own hair think care? Instead just handling situation properly understanding concern towards front house staff conduct  She proceeds say oh know mistakes happen  it  only did understand concern  choose brush off  wonder health department feel your mistakes happen  Your sorry loose apology doesn't mean anything if can't understand issue lies front house staff  Thanks lack care  Absolutely unprofessional would never come back here  Save yourself money anyways  Food mediocre  Menu lunch limited  worst hospitality incompetent manager  <EOR> Came lunch last week delicious!  I ordered Lamb Salad near perfect   Lamb very slightly over cooked but flavor fantastic ordered medium rare medium    The bread serve also very good   type raisin bread great way start meal   think Table 34 primarily lunch spot businesses serves purpose really well   If lamb can't recommend lamb salad high enough!  The entire table different salads everyone very happy  <EOR> We're visiting family town decided would good place nice dinner   Wrong   My cousin made reservations arrived reserved time  greeted seated immediately    The waitress Elena took drink orders   Between ordered 7 7 prosecco vodka mule bay breeze  informed no Smirnoff which requested bay breeze no ginger beer mule  Okay  No problem    Drinks brought no mention taking appetizer dinner order requested  We're now almost 30 minutes being restaurant   waited    Watched Elena pass least five times  Nothing   We decided request check drinks leave   When told wanted close why without even apology request stay she audacity ask if wanted change  Really?   saw speak maitre d' long she brought change major attitude course no apology   When walked silence maitre d'   even nice evening  apologize  f yourself nothing!
