I really enjoyed event  didn't eat much food but LOTS food vendors please your appetite   first year going look forward going next year   didn't arrive until mid afternoon missed some bands hoping see   However see Purple Rain Republic GooGoo Dolls perform few songs before left early crowd  Which brings reason only giving 3 stars   said left 1 hour before concert over took approximately 15 minutes vehicle   took HOUR parking lot   very little organization parking lot located at  Apparently people far behind began fighting  Thank goodness wasn't crowd   When concert let everything worse   hoping all fix parking issue find bigger park ample parking organization boot! <EOR> As loyal listener Mix 94 1 wanted BiteLV YEARS but stopped high school extracurriculars going off college life general  Nothing would stop 2012  Matchbox Twenty headliner? Counting Crows lineup? All noms could possibly area? $15 pre sale admission? reeled before even cast bait   The event lasts 11 am 9 pm but come whenever you'd like  Just remember there's no re entry  many food venues choose everyone find something they'll cost $3 $10 per item  picked delicious chicken gyro fried calamari Mad Greek Cafe booth   Event logistics seemed well organized volunteers security definitely top duties  booths ample space lines even small dining areas  If you're willing shell extra cash raised VIP section behind but personally love feel standing close outdoor stage   The live music left speechless  managed way through throng Ed Sheeran fangirls front crowd short Asian self great view stage Counting Crows Matchbox Twenty  just say really know put show? extended set until MB20 gets kicked off stage? Seriously dream come true almost lifelong fan   Every minute worth it  parking car rocky dirt lot watching favorite band concert live first time event hands down worth all waiting money  Mix 94 1's gonna hard time topping one  <EOR> This third year attending Bite Las Vegas  just Switchfoot main headliner EVERY year? very excited hear Sara Bareillis performing she favorite artists    I agree Heather even though same amount booths last year noticeably less FOOD booths  even noticed some booth's charging $6 certain items thought all portions between $1 $5    The parking situation HORRIBLE knew park Flamingo Twain but still stuck rocky gravel  would fine if some kind control aisles  huge gaps between rows cars could made parking lot easier many  friend mistakenly Flamingo lot told only way jump curb Honda Accord! unacceptable event where entrance fee  should enough money ticket sales afford proper parking attendants  Less American Idol rejects more parking attendants!  The food really good definitely overindulged layout event  basically loop try whatever want  <EOR> A tradition when comes around every year Bite Las Vegas excellent place sample myriad Las Vegas eateries offering variety different dishes great price  always concert component festival each year might cater different musical crowd  Usually mainstream pop some country if don't mind listening radio bands performing usually good fit crowds attending  Visit little while stay whole day Bite Las Vegas fun outing whole family  <EOR> First time ever festival excited some fun see some great bands  Even paid nice teenaged kid admission in  actually bit mess well guess pay right !? $13 Groupon deal Anyways enter festival walked all way back area where Coors light blue VIP area dying cold beer security guard said needed purchase wristband told walk all way back front  walk ALL WAY back front 106 degrees Fahrenheit only people front say blue hospitality tent inside  walk ALL WAY BACK talk 2 new guards Coors light blue tent one huge attitude very nice said walk another area  that's where blue tent is  walk AREA send all way back front AGAIN! u kidding me!? saw someone actually barfing heat stroke medics around send wild goose chase?! leave point but guess there's NO re entry allowed! trying profit event? terribly annoying  decided stay little longer see if anything would improve  AND   well did  update upgrade 1 star event 2 star because hunting down some shade cool off over stage ran into met Andy Grammer!! He took photo stayed listen play enjoyed part very much  guess must've manifested better time! LOL  Oh food stands least pretty great t hey vegan options too! Other wasn't greatest festival ever to  could improved if trained staff better  <EOR> I came across event while browsing Yelp stuff do  somewhat disbelieving when finished reading advert food festival tagged end almost afterthought would bit live music   including Ed Sheeran!   The line changed few times originally Alanis Morisette appearing waiting Sheeran's name disappear too  checked again before leaving event name still due play towards end 11 9 day   Having parked free quickly filling field across road walked into Desert Breeze Park minimal fee $15  obviously well advertised most area front stage already patchwork blankets    The smell food immediately made hungry  Every 20 yards brought new aromatic assault barbeque asian burgers  Each stall dishes $5 less   many $3  all tasters local restaurants stall holders talked restaurant gave tickets 20% off when next eat there   After eating body weight garlic chicken rice find position front growing crowd stage using freshly garlicked breath advantage   seemed everyone waiting Sheeran take stage organisers obviously knew put less popular bands first  becoming battle wills   who would give spot blazing sun bathe heads moment relative coolness shade? gave up   two more acts go   I found large truck sit under guzzle water but hearing crowd roar able squeeze into maybe third row back    Ed Sheeran AMAZING! He just stage 25 minutes 10minutes more banked on but totally worth it This event real treat  food great guys stalls weren't pushy music awesome  If downside day being able sun  Although fans being handed free could buy water would suggest next year hats sun umbrellas sale limit bringing only bottle water lifted  crowd thinned lot Sheeran know if cooler more shady I'd stuck around more garlic chicken rice <EOR> This review 2012 Bite Las Vegas   never before   Holy cow thing awesome   didn't show until 7pm closes 8pm little apprehensive but gf still wanted go   glad did   Parking FREE but really rocky dirt lot can't help but wince thinking poor tires going through driving over all those rocks   15 bucks door which let grassy area bunch food trucks tents   just missed Counting Crows concert knew Matchbox 20 going soon didn't chance shop around   seriously wondering if kind made mistake coming late if would ripoff   We found vendor no line Bahama Breeze grabbed plate habanero wings fries $5 gorged while waiting longer line H H BBQ   10 more bucks sampler bbq plate fried catfish   Yum   Then Matchbox 20 well reason 5 star review   Amazeballs   first thing come say    Hey everyone love coming know we're supposed close 9 but just gonna play until kick    Suddenly respect Matchbox 20 just several notches   didn't realize just many songs theirs heard radio over years   sure those bands hear background radio kind knew name all but never really knew anything them   Really love energetic dedicated showing appreciation fans or case winning over new one    Anyway now totally kicking myself coming thing earlier   Still 15 bucks alone totally worth two hour Matchbox 20 concert   Everything else gravy   can't imagine value thing would if see Counting Crows well plus chance gorge myself much more food   Definately can't wait come back  <EOR> This festival waste money  paid $20 still pay food top that  would rather paid little more actually bites Las Vegas  unlimited inexpensive tasting portions food local restaurants  55+ food vendors 80% fast food fair carnival food chain restaurants  few local places offerings very limited  Hash House Go Go known fabulous breakfast food only burger lemonade offered  Papa Johns pizzas delivered  Very few places sit eat  a couple dirty picnic tables    As music arrived 7pm hear Daughtry play 8pm  friend ordered gourmet pancake Stacks Yolks which took 15 minutes she ordered  What?! Another friend vegetarian wanted slice cheese pizza very few vegetarian options available waited Papa Johns pizza delivered  time walked over stage area 8 30 Daughtry left stage  No other band came 9 pm festival packing up  Lame  <EOR> I remember when event held inside Venetian years years ago   Having Desert Breeze great  Lots room spread blankets  Room kids play while bands playing  Good beer good price  <EOR> This year first time gone event  short LOVED IT!!  I seen commercial tv heard Ed Sheeran going bought tickets next day  plan little later day avoid heat since Ed wasnt going until 5pm but group wanted earlier see band playing 12pm  say heat bit overbearing times  passing hand fans helped course freezing cold beer! If act interested enough find some shade few vendors too  also walk down into park find nice shady tree sit under  close enough still hear music thats where enjoyed most food   I thought everything well priced  Ticket $15 Parking Free Drinks $3 5 Food $1 5  ended spending 40 bucks entire day 11 30am 6pm LONG day but well worth it  only intention see Ed Sheeran play but actually glad full experience!!   The only thing turned off besides heat people shown early even earlier then set camp laying full size blankets sheets front stage  Only leaving few inches between walk through  pretty annoying when trying way stage tip toeing around them  actually surprised when dirty looks even comment two stepping disgusting dirty blankets    All all would definetely back! Even if favorite artists wasnt playing   Oh Ed Sheeran AMAZING  Which no surprise! <EOR> This first time attending but volunteering through Meetup Burn Foundation working beer tents  Parking wasn't hard find since arrived early 11 10am easily directed towards front gate  Would nice signs Spring Mountain advertising event  line inside long but lucky didn't wait due working event  would nice some signs park making people aware which way food bathrooms stage etc  maybe map? pretty much just walk around find things  also think would easier less confusing if park ticket booth people buy tickets booze food vs @ stands  Things may moved along quicker when tents people only having deal tickets vs cash  Also should signs @ booze food tents state Cash Only advertise website this  don't believe Though ATM's would saved some people ATM fee's don't carry cash    I found customers little confused when coming beer tent  bought tickets table then table next hand ticket drink carded  customer made valid point  Why am being sold ticket without getting carded if know going buying drink  Good point!! lot people headed tables where volunteers handing drinks wanting but hadn't bought tickets yet told table next them first  Very unorganized then fact another tent wine hard liquor    I unfort  didn't eat much food because having fun passing beer having blast tent busy  did some chinese food wasn't bad found little expensive $10 mine free combo plate  Included rice noodles chicken small egg roll  egg roll best!! friend gotten some mini bundt cakes share delicious!!

Next agree Gina signage  map entrance people figure where going  I found way VIP tent where due lack signage didn't know first table wristband proceeded find area friends sit  then proceeded food line  When first volunteer food table standing line 10 minutes she told having wristband table before food  did waited another 10 minutes line food  food consisted rolled meat sliders crab cake chicken wings  told could only 1 each  Then salad chips salsa no salsa available   later found House Blues provided food VIP tent  horrible food cold   VIPs received 3 food tickets  back few hours later Jambalaya chicken wings  Nasty cold  lucky food  friends 30 minutes did no food left  6 30!! event lasted until 10  Poor planning House Blues  friend complained people charge tent sent over volunteers tent eat  Omg difference quality  food hot tasty  The placement VIP section good right next stage  own porta potties  bad weren't serviced enough  Ran toilet paper paper towels throughout day  Also should better signage men women  Guys using women's vice versa   The bands great! Although speakers food area would allowed everyone hear them  Although jumbo screens side stage would allowed people see them   So all all disappointed  overpaid event  Next year if decide pay cheap price buy vendors since VIP worth price   hope organizers take all suggestions improve next years event  <EOR> To fair volunteer burn foundation event free attend  However next year plan VIP tickets  event ALOT fun! good system set entry which prevents long waits  variety food options amazing small price try all sorts food  Sauced came list favorites tried   Not mention amazing line artists performing   So many local companies show give fun little goodie bags  Over all tons fun can't wait till next year! <EOR> Park #3 today   3rd year row Mix 94 1 Bite Vegas   park great   huge plenty room everything including music events   all kinds food venues too   Great day this  <EOR> I'll first admit high maintenance lady! hate lines crowds general big festivals  having mental breakdown both Lollapalooza Taste Chicago basically decided old festivals needed give trying    This friends festival even high maintenance lady handle  parking isn't all bad if arrive early ish day like first 3 4 hours! parking festival entrance we're talking 10 mintues  big deal  think sucks pay admission pay all food but know raising money charity whatever    The food usually pretty good  gourmet but does trick  main issue most food sizeable portions $5  Ok called BITE Las Vegas I'd try lots mini portions $1 $3  Some places concept but most didn't  Taste Chicago instance each booth mini portion $1 $2  wish they'd kind mandate each place did BITE portion small price then sell freaking meal sized portions those want it  husband usually split 3 4 $5 items before passing into food coma usually end wishing stomach wallet room try more appealing items offered but damn big    My other minor complaint wish more seating  gets fairly crowded under few tents chairs  guess could plan ahead pack blanket something? never clever though    Overall fairly inexpensive low key food kind event  3 years row now good time every year  <EOR> What event this?
