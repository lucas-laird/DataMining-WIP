Also first time ordered anything where did enough ingredients final product   Eventually workers walked over where then ask salad he acknowledges talking but immediately walks back order window stands there  sit wonder myself he come help order not? whole experience really bothered decided walk restaurant    Atmosphere place right next local bar which saw lot workers going back forth between both spots through side door  say ordering area see into parts kitchen does look good job cleaning whole restaurant   tucked away small hole wall  between bar title loan  office east side     Price prices aren't bad pay for   MY THOUGHTS? Sadly place lost business due bad service management  kind funny when let manager know thought food should've given free to last order which calzone uncooked he addresses shortening name way appease which only aggravated even further especially someone don't even know   experience shouldn't dictate anybody else's experience wanting come back let alone giving place chance  But am yelping because disappointment service am apprehensive receiving if ever wanted eat again   just unfortunate since talked highly food recently girlfriends also live east side knowing hard Eastsider find good places eat  thought found gem now gem lost its luster  don't plan coming back anytime soon     RECOMMENDATIONS Thai lady works suggest ordering because she really nice  Also stay away calzones because eating nothing but dough  <EOR> Yes yes yes love place If pizza wings few drinks just family night yassss <EOR> One sorriest examples pizza ever had  Absolutely nothing experience good  wouldn't wish called pizza worst enemy  Take advice anywhere but here! <EOR> First all took 1hr n 30mins them deliever pizza mention before recieved pizza call them check update hour placed order  when lady picked phone she immediate attitude  asked long going take pizza she lied said he way then said wait min said never mind your pizza just came okay long till he here? response IDK want pick yourself? then responded no asked again estimate time still responded IDK rude tone might busy but customer service awful  Pizza great!! but need work customer service skills  <EOR> We ordered pizza along chicken fingers cherry Pepsi grandma pick order Asian lady works rude grandma going place years treated poor customer service won't going back  <EOR> Irvin favorite!!!!
