Now onto food   question where flavor?    One bite into duck nothing   just meat fatty skin sauce over duck but no flavor within meat   Usually roasted duck should smokey flavor duck lacked it!    Char siu BBQ pork ok  Again much flavor usually char siu real distinct flavor     All say am still quest find best Asian BBQ place town! <EOR> Even Las Vegas parents still only want eat Chinese food   end eating dinner least night pretty much everytime Vegas family   place located chinatown  off Spring Mountain Road   street  next Treasure Island  Fashion Show mall   away strip you'd need take taxi here   food okay typical Chinese restaurant   think overcharge many things but bargain compared 25 dollar fried rice you'd Mirage's chinese restaurant   never come when friends   think place okay if want Chinese food when you're Vegas but if  want need ask why would want more Chinese food Vegas when theres much back home?!  I'd rather try something else  <EOR> The service beyond horrid food bland   seated pot tea literally thrown it landed slid table order taken order delivered same throw slide      and last time saw anyone  waitress sat booth behind another waitress swatting flies window swatter never even said word when made eye contact her   My Sam Woo Hot Pot simply soy sauce salt variety seafood few pieces chicken few pork  fish wet cardboard I think fish? squid just body  no tentacles all two shrimp   hot pot   that part did lie  But worth $14 95     Mongolian beef ordered extra spicy no spice nothing except beef scallions   Want rice?  extra   $30 just those two dishes bowl rice   Save your money and ATM fees   <EOR> Four words   Roasted duck roasted pork   MISS   Arguably best roasted duck every U S   Also tried wonton noodle soup pan fried gai lan garlic sauce   Wonton noodle soup decent   Gai lan even better   But true shining stars roasted meats   Bon appetit! <EOR> We way Vegas whirlwind 36 hours decadent eating libations  inner Asians dying some noodle soup start recovery process swung Sam Woo Chinatown   At Sam Woo s CA always order Siu Gow Noodle Soups over regular Wonton Noodle Soup  Unfortunately guy took order informed didn't offer location  opted standard Wonton Noodle Soup split roast pork gai lan table   My bowl packed TON noodles HUGE wontons  Unfortunately broth wontons lacked flavor  all needs little soy sauce     NAME MOVIE!

How? could've decent buffet meal price  wouldn't complain if food tasted somewhat comparable location OC but just bland Chinese food  service non existent  would explain why left penny tip    I highly recommend staying away Sam Woo  probably some better Chinese options same parking lot would with  <EOR> We visited over Memorial weekend wanting something quick arriving    This place good 4 5 years back  hesitated time because last year bad experience but thought may just fluke but weekend no question CANNOT come back place  awful    They sat table which dirty order ticket it  thing nasty looked dried meat juices must spilled another dish   The place actually quite slow 4 tables total    After seated tea actually arrived promptly   We waited 10 minutes wanted order  tried flag server even making eye contact turning head towards said Excuse completely ignored another table  finally walked cashier asked hostess if could order  She brought over very waiter ignored us   Our order 4 won ton noodles plate garlic bok choy  BAD!!!

Wait staff very friendly  Good selection food! Restaurant good size didn't wait  big party very accommodating  <EOR> I lived SoCal love love LOVE Sam Woo happy when first moved Vegas 2008 see familiar restaurant Las Vegas Chinatown   first 3 off strip restaurants tried Spring Mountain   Unfortunately expectation quality Chinese food reasonable price quickly shattered huge mound rice miniscule amount chicken vegetables plate tourist trap prices being charged   flavor okay but trying justify price tag shoveling extra extra rice answer   recall thinking WTH!  Did restaurant steal name well known much loved restaurant California???  2 5 years later am still sure if restaurant operated same family part same franchise but know didn't want back crappy Sam Woo ever again true word   And those reviewers think real Chinese restaurants should bother offer good service along good food still rate poor imitation restaurant 5 star think should qualify your reviews disclaimers reviews ratings food only   And if want pay Casino Chinese restaurant prices least mediocre food why leave Strip?  Plus dare say lot Chinese restaurants high end casinos offer better food ones here  <EOR> Don't come restaurant   First time trying place let tell don't waste your time  order porridge porridge water down no flavor  plenty porridge lifetime  daughter order soy sauce chicken rice waiter said rice didn't come it  order bowl rice  While waiting browsing thru menu again there's order chicken rice dish  Don't know why waiter said none maybe he wanted charge more  But anyway when chicken dish came dry  no moisture meat  told waiter he took back  When he came back thought would gotten new order  But no!! All did drizzle more soy sauce chicken!! Chicken still dry shit! top rice charge funky smell  Couldn't eat it   Sorry say first last time dine here!!  should read review before coming <EOR> As avid fan family friend style chinese food  definitely recommend restruant  always come group friends order few dishes we're always stuffed amd satisfied  Service pretty good staff tends questions quickly! recommend <EOR> I love Peking duck  husband come least once month just duck  waiter quiet but other decent place  see others talking waiting seats but husband always promptly seated  <EOR> I feel if nothing clean food down workers   mention horrible service  But food pretty okay tasting   maybe just really hungry? Whatever  <EOR> The porridge awful  Even when poured spoonful soy sauce still tasted nothing  possible??? Fried rice okay nothing amazing very standard  Seafood noodle also very plain exciting    Quality food service just something would never even waste time again  horrendous but definitely coming back  Ever  <EOR>
