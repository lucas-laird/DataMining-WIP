With being heart MGM fact being sports bar attracted quite line  waited roughly around 40 minutes table but observation people taking time watching games mean accept norm honestly find somewhere else eat  did actually fast when occupy yourself people watching conversing amongst your group   The restaurant itself quite huge does seem accommodate quite mass bodies  Staff wise very tandem procedures did seem top things which seems taboo times Vegas eateries   As food couple different options called name but end set sights Philly cheesesteak  served styling three mini sandwiches which first glance seem you'll leave empty stomach but very misleading struggled finish #3  bread itself lightly salted pretzel bread but surprisingly soft definitely high point through each bite  steak itself thinly sliced sirloin believe but actually tender perfect spice added bonus  top off as seen picture cheese abundant point where borderline overpowering although doesn't love whiz? All all well put together cheesesteak but does authentic East? Yeah right  Haha  I would say Taps both bar food drinks? Yes  Taps casual dining experience? Maybe not  <EOR> This place total crap  Service sucks  accommodate simple requests  Management seems power trip  Claims TVs only games people bet can't adjust channel when hilights running old games  crap management just doesn't want something requested because don't to  crock  Avoid place crappy management  <EOR> Place pitiful   First right concert Friday night some food   We told hostess chick eat  She then says the bar full menu  Ok no problem  Sounds cool   Then sit down bartender server comes take drinks  asked food menu then he says we're already way past last call food  then looked each other he could sense frustration says if want order quick appetizer think but order now  quickly ordered something   Then order drinks   Guy asked four times over drink wanted   Dude could barely understand Englidh if course he gives wrong drink   We just kept because efforts would just wasted   We're easy going people we'll fuss but later just back   So here's question     Why did tell could eat whole menu if already past last call?  Second question    Why hell close your kitchen 11 00 Fridsy night? just stupid  minimum just switch bar menu   Honestly place sucks   I don't know where idiots work but guess Vegas US must shortage people looking work   I could hire better staff local soup kitchen  <EOR> Visiting Vegas staying MGM decided try convenient sports bar located casino  ordered nachos  delicious!!
