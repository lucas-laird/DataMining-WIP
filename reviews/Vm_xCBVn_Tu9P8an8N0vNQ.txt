Called waiter over asked where order was   Waiter says didn't order anything   made comment he sat down distinctively heard ask hot hot while he ordering guy walked late's order but his? He offered put order right away but friend already pissed   friend ordered shrimp way overcooked   Mine didn't taste same did first time called waiter over he said changed recipe soupy   but  why liked it?  Long story short all left VERY dissatisfied   day blamed crap dinner  <EOR> I'm writing experience year ago   few places give 1 score too     friends came because other big crawfish place crowded all hungry    friend suggested try place but little reluctant   southern california am use Boiling Crab quality shrimp crawfish      The fries pretty average    sauce really bland watery   doesnt much taste kick it      We ordered shrimp but didnt seem fresh   shell really hard off    also felt hard tagged waiter when even though only few customers      All all wouldnt come back again  <EOR> This best meals ever Vegas   back every time travel Vegas   Drinks Tasty ice cold beer   Appetizers great   Tried sweet potato fries   good also ordered them dessert   Entrees Great   tried huge garlic butter shrimp   Tasty Cajun crawfish tender clams house sauce sweet meat Cajun blue crabs   Customer service great   Mark very friendly attentive   Cleanliness A  Décor ambiance good   played darts while cooks  worked magic   Prices fair   Parking plentiful  <EOR> We tried place dinner glad did   At first wasn't happy fact didn't mayo   bf sauce he uses mayo ingredient best sauce ever dip those little crawfish tails into   However tasting crawfish no sauce needed   This place definitely different flavors HnJ but love it! We the two us ordered 4lbs medium house special 2 lbs medium house special shrimps   all FRESH flavorful   never shrimp kind girl but place made yummy actually prefer shrimp over crawfish!  The service pretty slow though If wasn't watching cholesterol intake would eat crawfish joint every single weekend!  But since am somewhat health conscious once every two months limit  <EOR> Looks folks givin' Cajun Crawfish hard time   Hmm   Well yet other crawfish joint town sure wildly amazing but honestly really liked place  When walked Saturday night wasn't hoppin' but seemed some faithful followers   lighting little dim but comfortable tables covered white paper just waiting doused butter  My friend used restaurant com coupon which saved $25 $35 bill could really wrong?? We ordered shrimp house special sauce a mix garlic butter cajun sauce crab legs garlic butter potato corn  only complaint really corn seemed over cooked looked    well    over cooked   Otherwise no real complaints  Now places shrimp served its head  Seeing faces food never sought experience but    eh     Here's new experiences   Once de headed shrimp good albeit just hair over done   Still yummy its garlicky spicy sauce   show stealer though crab legs   DELICIOUS   ever licked OUTSIDE crustacean?  Yeah good   sauce world!  Butter garlic garlic garlic   believe took butter bath   those experiences where look afterward shake your head little try remember where exactly are     So perfect?  No   Worth try?  would definitely say yes especially if choose bathe crab legs garlic butter  <EOR> So craving seafood didnt feel paying arm leg it   Decided instead its competitor Hot N Juicy Crawfish because place accepts Restaurant com coupons   Specifically wanted cajun clams fresh shrimp crab legs   around 8pm Sunday fresh seafood all clams blue crabs dungeness crabs   crawfish but those frozen and good fresh ones      Ended ordering pound cajun clams calamari basket butterfly shrimp basket order sweet potato fries   cajun clams awesome!!!!  other stuff just OK   Total bill food tax came $40   $25 restaurant com coupon total amount spent $19 amount included tip already    bad some good seafood   Also service good   1 star cajun clams 1 star restaurant com coupon  1 star good service <EOR> Didn't crawfish since told frozen but shrimp great!!! also enjoyed chicken strip   suprise weren't many customer   definately return when fresh crawfish  <EOR> Service Good  Food Good  Restaurant Ok  Return Visits Yes   Gotta admit over Hot n Juicy Crawfish first but busy hour wait decided Cajun Crawfish backup plan because really looking forward havin' some Crawfish HUNGRY didn't want wait hour  used love Hot n Juicy used when first opened when we'd ONLY patrons establishment    But ever since Man vs  Food practically no desire because f'n wait!!! But enough them Cajun Crawfish bad      We little hesitant because expectations Crawfish considering LOVE seafood    But kept open mind motto try once if don't never come back    We greeted right away staff really nice  waiting food decided Yelp place phone  Unfortunately reviews no bueno but again kept open mind husband reminded motto  small restaurant but capability accommodate large parties  ordered Crawfish crab legs  Some reviews mentioned Crawfish small wasn't case night came mixture big medium sized ones  LOVE garlic  why always fan Hot n Juicy but always hated I'd smell garlic days no matter many times wash hands lemon use hot water when clean hands    wasn't case enough garlic flavor but much I'd smell days which AWESOME because meeting friends wards didn't wanna smell swimming garlic! Which BTW didn't!   I don't see many negatives place even though lot negatives but returned couple times initial visit    Except maybe work decor? kind feel generic Chuck E  Cheese rinky dink mural no offense CC!
