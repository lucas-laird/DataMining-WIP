I mostly ended grabbing breakfast  leave sandwich lunchy fare someone else   bagels because convenient   4 50 pricey but par anything you'd strip   coffee actually normal starbucks prices delicious   would liked some decaf options but probably only humans isn't wanting caffeine long day night   companions ordered breakfast sandwiches seemed them ok well   Stop quick snack but venture you'll better food elsewhere if actually take time sit down  <EOR> The food drink decently priced but service horrible  All needed cup coffee waited 15 minutes counter    The people working just efficient all    Recommend going somewhere else!! <EOR> we stopped quick sandwich lunch   cuban sandwich wife turkey sandwich   7 8 bucks good sized sandwich   service quick enough no issues that   liked sandwich   all sandwiches heated warm which always enjoy   wouldnt special trip sandwich but if you're near tropicana need quick bite serves purpose   would another cuban if around <EOR>
