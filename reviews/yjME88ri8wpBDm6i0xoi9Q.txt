Sadly no fridges MGM rooms though drinks refilled promptly  Prices high but reality acceptable due portion sizes  menu huge small all day breakfast menu if desired    Amazingly no smoke smell despite being close slots which very welcome surprise  Avenue 24 good place visit if need your basic comfort foods however all great dining options Vegas would say limit visit per trip  <EOR> My husband looking breakfast saw long line outside Avenue Cafe    Thus assumed place surely must good    WRONG   We talked friendly guest reception person front while waiting first clue which seemed ignored she said lot construction basically choices limited   which accounted long line     We seated great location overlooking casino cozy nook  why place received 1 star   other 1 star friendly staff except waitress bless heart having best days    hope    The food bland basic most  edible hungry ate  Oh ordered extra side eggs forgot when finally came cold    didn't bother fuss because waitress looked stressed other tables leaving tip she expected I wonder why   She wasn't rude anything but when clarified order she seemed bit defensive   This definitely waste Mlife credits    <EOR> Didn't bad meal here  Everything kind pricey  Where Vega$ $4 99 prime rib buffet? Imploded all old classic hotels Strip? Anyway every server super attentive super friendly  Coffee absolutely delicious  Tried number things breakfast 3 days row all them quite filling appetizing  Lines move pretty fast   even Sunday 10 AM  should almost deduct star having restroom premises walk good jaunt through casino but then only once four visits here  <EOR> Pros accommodated large group quickly    Cons The food mediocre verge being bland overpriced but expected Vegas don't pancakes unless you're ok bisquick cheap syrup The server offered split bill then when did he said he didn't want   Overall overpriced Meh food  Grab yourself Starbucks breakfast sandwich put money towards buffet  <EOR> Nice decor  Good food  Lousy service  asked coffee cream Splenda  Server set set down carafe coffee rather hard said here's your coffee  no cup no Splenda  Some else brought cream  But take Splenda  another table  server never conversed us  Wasn't very personable all  Somebody else dropped off food  sure why restaurant busy all  server came but check drinks finished never during meal  Very disappointed level service such prestigious hotel  Better customer service training obviously needed  <EOR> Came breakfast few friends staying MGM    Restaurant pretty convenient Monorail came another location   Just follow signs Restaurants   Good coffee generous portion orange juice   Avenue Scramble quite good   really getting into scrambles late just seem more enjoyable your typical omelette   Service attentive pleasant   All all great start very busy day  <EOR> They only serve full breakfast menu until 11am despite sign outside labeling them Breakfast Lunch  little annoying if only reason arrived 11 05 because spent 15 minutes standing line table  fiance noted half dozen tables stood empty but uncleared while waited line surmising busboys all break waitresses unwilling clear tables  finally seated bar where argued bartender over 11am rule  Seriously McDonalds? pancakes FIVE minutes ago  They willing accommodate requests certain breakfast items but time ordered almost time leave flight out  then decided pay drinks but instead bartender hit $50 tab which included food never received  Finally agreed continue waiting food but breakfast debacle resulted mad dash through airport trying gate time names being called loudspeaker overhead  I ordered California omelette listed egg whites Jack cheese avocado side roasted vegetables  Instead omelette squash mushrooms the only food hate inside avocado top side hash browns  Pretty disappointing even food scarfing down cab way airport  In hindsight probably would happier going McDonalds  <EOR> Horrible service totally overpriced  expected MGM casino though  waiter behind breakfast bar loved saying no can't   He ending shift 11 am could care less  some sleep bud sorry bothered you  <EOR> Nasty food pretty much joke  ounce hash browns eggs Benedict came supermarket jar  also single slice toast no steak knife  Pretty awful <EOR> Overall menu your typical diner food but way more expensive because location MGM Grand  ordered well though chicken waffles  waffles flavored jalapeño cheddar  definitely highlight menu  husband super full sharing meal   HOWEVER advertise fresh squeezed orange juice lie  no way orange juice served fresh squeezed  C'mon don't lie silly stuff that  Also standard coffee set back $5  Much better just Starbucks price  <EOR> If know brunch kind guy  late long night Vegas looking nice breakfast brunch next morning but didn't want hard all you can eat buffet   Staying MGM guess natural choice Avenue Cafe due convenience so  plus!   Nice casual open air brunch type atmosphere  Standard menu scrambles omelettes pancakes toast orange juice etc  Nothing special just you'd expect basic brunch spot   Our waiter awesome very peppy upbeat energetic threw few jokes quick ask if needed anything  thought he cool but could also seen annoyance if you're feeling morning hungover   Will back?

She also incredibly rude probably because look young   asked if could substitute eggs extra hash browns meal she said wasn't possible  just fruit walnut pancakes keep simple  husband did create your own omelette she criticized choices    like seriously? breakfast why care?  Fortunately pancakes great but omelette looked pitiful   you spend much money look threw everything sloppy   When finishing tried flag waitress down box check because leave time check into Wet Republic  She acted she couldn't see us  When she finally came over gave bill she made wait over 10 minutes give back card copy receipt   Needless say don't recommend coming here  If want amazing breakfast don't mind walk Hash House Go  Better service food  <EOR> When Vegas favorite breakfast place to  located right inside MGM Grand next Starbucks  wait usually 15 20 minutes depending when arrive  favorite steak eggs potatoes  also order Shrimp Cocktail Bloody Mary when available  give lot food worth money  <EOR> This favorite meal!

Maybe just ranting just waitress wasn't very professional but overall wasn't very good experience  <EOR> I rarely sweet breakfast but when saw red velvet pancakes menu couldn't resist  Unfortunately disappointed  brought 3 smushed muffins thing syrup  When asked where white chocolate glaze menu server said no liked stopped serving it  Why menu then?! Boo brunch fail! <EOR> I'm usually fan Mexican breakfast menu but adventurous tried Huevos Rancheros here  good decision made! absolutely delicious  sauce really really good  staff super friendly whole breakfast experience worth 5 stars! <EOR> GARBAGE!!!! Aside whipped cream Chris' hot chocolate coffee which both very good everything absolutely horrible! I ordered bacon cheese burger medium rare Chris ordered chicken fingers fries  forty minutes later burger came minute two Chris' chicken fingers came out  chicken fingers badly over fried inedible! hard dry  french fries ironically soggy cold   burger par basic diner The meat itself turned color right but believe cooked medium rare  very juicy charred  He forgot bacon burger which probably better off burger pouring grease  saw waiter twice when he took order when he dropped check no opportunity complain  felt bad watching Chris crunch gross chicken fingers  vacation gift birthday he trying best good sport it  <EOR> I sat counter ordered Eggs Benedict Chocolate Martini made Christine coffee  service great all items tasty  <EOR> We ate Avenue 24 Saturday morning while staying MGM Grand friends   First off recommend Avenue 24 instead room service   actually looked first room service menu crazy expensive even room service Las Vegas strip   checked menu Avenue 24 online   scrambles omelets approximately half price room service menu   place close Grand Tower elevators easy quick to   Also provided plastic utensils napkins plenty condiments   ever stay MGM Grand again absolutely would Avenue 24 instead getting room service   I Avenue 24 scramble which eggs ham bacon sausage lot Tillamook cheddar crispy potatoes chive sour cream   enormous scramble easily shareable   crispy potatoes every bite worked very well cheddar   But thing tied all together flavor chive sour cream   gives faint chive flavor throughout sour cream adds nice creaminess eggs   would absolutely dish again every bite every flavor     The wife corned beef eggs which another enormous breakfast   made large chunks tender corned beef lot them   dish seasoned well   She would order again   When pick food sat bar area which large TVs   Service quick told phone would 15 minutes food was   great addition MGM Grand would definitely return  <EOR> Had breakfast special omelette amazing  Food filled your plate very tasty  Yes pricey but casino but also studied  point  <EOR> Went expecting much if bad although still pricey   We stopped because late watch world cup games needed grab quick breakfast  two eggs breakfast wife just two eggs    The food decent eggs done ok sausage fine toast good  hash browns however arrived sort brick greasy rather tasteless   presume came frozen shape just tossed deep fryer  Coffee ok left carafe     The major negative must mention didn't realize expensive coffee until bill   $3 95 per cup coffee!  If paying four dollars cup coffee better liquor there   realized rest meal going pricey but bit much  <EOR> Great breakfast open 24 hours!

Note self MGM management oversees Avenue Cafe gives hoot customer service  tip today? Stay away  Spend your money rude Starbucks baristas next door instead  <EOR> Don't eat here! Thai salad saltiest most disgusting salad ever  chicken dry lettuce seemed weeks old  would stay clear place  service slow  ridiculously expensive food no where near worth it  Mcdonalds would better option  <EOR> The newly opened Avenue 24 cafe inside MGM Grand absolutely no appeal except its proximity Wet Republic  ended stopping quick or quick lunch right before day club whole experience quite disappointing   The only good part place service  waiter really nice friendly  Everything else pretty much sucked  First wanted order salad but just couldn't fork $17 caesar garden salad  Some things menu more reasonably priced type dish but prepared spend least $20 more per person   We waited food almost 30 minutes which created huge problem because guestlist closing Wet Republic  ended having only 10 minutes eat before rush because took food much longer expected come out   The taste left lot desired  skillet hash green sauce short ribs fries  both sound good theory but both came less average best  hash didn't good flavor overly salty  fries didn't enough topping short ribs also didn't taste much   With many great places eat Vegas would highly recommend skipping this  MGM sandwich shop  supposed good looks service lot faster  <EOR> We staying MGM first time wanted quick bite before Wet Republic came convenience  Never again here  If want overpriced mediocre food you're right place   Decor Modern nice clean  few tables larger parties  bad only positive thing find  All looks no substance   Food 1 Braised rib skillet eggs overly cooked  braised ribs tender but no flavor them  Even when mixed everything  Even adding bunch salt pepper hot sauce didn't improve appetite dish  2 Breakfast burrito enchilada style dish little better braised rib but little better 0 still terrible  simple breakfast burrito delicious but somehow messed up  Though doused sauce felt dry  thing liked crispiness potatoes   Service very minimal  <EOR> tip if MLIFE VIP skip lines  portions huge  <EOR> Was impressed restaurant  Service very slow food just okay  ordered spicy bloody Mary's menu  When received no spice all  olives also supposed habanero peppers them  Instead just regular olives  back bar bartender would add more spice  take bottle tobasco back table  mother found some hairy ball cured salmon  prices expected Vegas  Overall fan restaurant  <EOR>
