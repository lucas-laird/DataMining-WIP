We Laziza work happy hour disappointing ordered most appetizers some drinks hookah  all appetizers hummus best but everything else just bland  service ok when actually saw waiter    For Hookah lounge expecting something little more intimate comfortable  won't going back place again  <EOR> I've couple times but don't love it   think cool place hang evenings DJ different events going evening depending day  Last time open mic night some people really good! hookah person may some bearing experience   I think reverse happy hour but haven't stuck around long enough find out   Last time Maxeki Margarita some tequila concoction off list   ok but tasted bit alka seltzer thus bringing back horrible memories Lolita's Town Square    also Falafel Pocket patties good but wrap little dry hard   hummus delicious definitely worth trying   All all cool place hang but food isn't super great or least times    Also once night event start impossible conversation anyone your table even if you're sitting restaurant section   If you're eat someone else and or group probably best earlier day  <EOR> No doubt worst full service restaurant Southern Nevada   far better off sitting bar restaurant   My wife visited restaurant Friday night 7 PM which prime time most restaurants but total fail Laziza   all cars parking lot one shared several other restaurants thought might crowded inside   only maybe ten tables dining room only two occupied   fair amount people bar     I ordered diet Coke   Guess diet Coke   then order iced tea   Ok then waitress comes back says iced tea but delivers another diet Coke   isn't right fountain working correctly still diet Coke   asked water which woudn't see another 30 45 minutes long entrée arrived   The menu supposed Middle Eastern but contains Philly Cheese steak Asian Chinese Chicken Salad Fried Chicken Lasagna    no expert Greek middle eastern food decided try samplers Mezza  labneh hummus falafel baba ghanouj tabbouli grape leaves pita Laziza Sampler like middle eastern empanadas    ok but over priced get     Service slow especially considering only two other occupied tables dining room if could find server all  add ambiance open mic night going bar since dining room opens into bar no sound barrier very loud lots bass feedback    It overall unpleasant experience   never worry seeing again but then again don't expect them open much longer  <EOR> This place GREAT happy hour   5pm when barely opening doors sat bar  bartender apologized them being unprepared manager late    great indication place managed   half price apps house wines beers well drinks bottled beers $3    We ordered Mezza appetizer labneh hummus falafel baba ghanouj Tabbouli pita menu says serves 4 kidding  LOTS food!  couple beers glasses wine bill only $22  Unbelievable!  We back check place late night  <EOR> I came late Sunday see DJ spinning night  Mezza which big sampler  food all right  service night frustrating  asked questions menu recommendations etc  she couldn't answer  ditz seemed she wanted drop subject hide behind bar  When she brought sampler named dishes hummus tabbouleh baba ganoush etc  friend asked made ex  chickpea spread parsley salad eggplant mash   She seemed caught off guard  didn't matter since group friends weren't picky eaters  She rarily checked table we ONLY ones eating lounge rest smoking hookah downing beers seemed having bad night    <EOR> I dying try place forever since enjoy frequenting hookah lounges relaxing atmosphere hookah  Finally boyfriend came dinner last Wednesday   When came seated right away bar area booth choose no hookah sit nice booths any other restaurant guess if want hookah sit bar  4 TVs blasting football bartender sitting bar using laptop  Given only 2 other small tables don't blame but maybe hide little? am used big cozy booths dim lighting relaxing atmosphere sports bar  Since am into sports all HUGE disappointment me  But took new experience thought would give try    Their happy hour pretty good 50% off appetizers drafts nice deal  very fast service ordered everything once  brought hookah food same time which terribly inconvenient when trying eat enjoy your hookah before burns out  hookah tasted nice but set just end your table hose gets way your food small table   The saving grace food! Yummy! falafel pita boyfriend fillet minion kabobs  delicious! 5 stars food! hummus appetizer average would again considering something $4 during happy hour    They did looked hookah lounge back advertisements 21+ nights DJ such which looked fun but chairs didn't look comfortable looked odd place mingle    Go food hookah atmosphere unless love watching football boys while smoking some hookah! <EOR> Great last time went  Hookah nothing special but drinks strong food awesome  over heard servers saying closing just drove don't see sign anymore  Also website redirects NuSantucary Town Square  Call before go  <EOR> Unfortunate news hear now closed maybe should've wrote review bit while ago huh?   I actually never came during restaurant hours but did come several occasions hours when Hookah Lounge opened business  Rebel Wednesdays would Reggae Night performances Members Haleamano Fortwentydaze aboriginals etc  usually consisted all star band performing reggae jam session all night!   Drinks nice strong in good way definitely worth your $10  did continue serve food lounge night whole menu ranging Tapas sandwiches salads  favorite Baba Ganoush served warm Pita bread Calamari  Occasionally would reluctantly order overprices french fries help soak Alcohol    The hookah believe ranged $15 Hookah $25 Unlimited Hookah  knocked star off place because while its busy flagging waiter down hookah could challenge  walk them ask flavors list request hookah  However throughout night since unlimited frequently replace coals change flavors upon request!   All all popular hang while Wednesday nights  sad never actually try restaurant side sad no longer business! <EOR> Music great!!  They Samoan band playing GOOD   I thought price high just couple drinks some hookah   Couple hours two would run $50 plus tax tips   We did enjoy ourselves while here  <EOR> I it   hookah lounge   serves alcohol which pretty rare nowadays Vegas   However knew some friends throwing party decided mostly because boasting free alcohol ladies private party     The place overall nice decor when walk in   But then gets confusing head back where bar is   There's indoor patio huge room nothing it   few booths few tables but seemed really open under furnished     The bartender ladies super nice greeted immediately which refreshing since most women bartenders ignore other similarly attractive women   drinks keep mind free wasn't expecting amazingness really sugary sweet   ordered few jolly ranchers group friends although tasted good left sweet sour taste your mouth   Plus 10 them start feel little sick sugar buzzed enough     The music some weird Reggae music   good reggae just weird pop trans throw in some reggae music    The hookah good changed coals often which nice   Overall friends great fun time   Should back time try restaurant  <EOR> Great house music remixed pop music  Excellent seating lighting  Sexy vibe   However hookah does last long  maybe 30 minutes  really annoying ask bus boy keep changing coals  even then sometimes didn't pick up     I think they're using enough coals using good enough coals making water cold enough  easy fix part  they've just it  used hookah hitting well 1 2 hours minimal coal changing  issue big me  <EOR> A very fun hookah lounge  servers very friendly always check if need more drinks if your hookah par  <EOR> Good time weekend enjoyed live band but way loud    No idea food but looked good lot people eating   cool lounge atmosphere  <EOR> This great place Henderson Green Valley area if looking hookah lounge nice Mediterranean menu  <EOR> WOW   Simply AMAZING  From drinks hookah place 5 start no doubt!!! <EOR> This building must haunted   ate once but impressed hookah experience   going give second chance but alas closed its doors!  fourth restaurant location crashed burned   Someone call exorcist  <EOR> I've Laziza mind all week since Sunday night teaser    convinced some girls head share love Saturday night   decided liquid diet and wouldn't when ladies drink $2 vodka well drinks all night! but broke sample baba ganoush which addictive  DJ it    rocket    mean old school PYT  sigh MJ  genius  RIP new school techno electronic some Middle Eastern thrown good measure  figured place couldn't any better  but then belly dancer came out  Little miss dropped hot    then some   WOW! <EOR> The roomie craving Mediterranean food night discovered place right around corner fantastic happy hour half price appetizer deal felt need take advantage of    lucked great customer service over phone when called placed order two hours later yoga class   arrived pick order everything ready great price happy hour deal the food even worth full price definitely satisfied cravings     We ordered mezza sampler which consists labneh hummus falafel baba ghanouj tabbouli stuffed grape leaves   served wonderful light dinner definitely taking advantage again!  baba ghanouj nice smokey hummus decent pitas nice toasty   can't say anything quality drinks hookah but visit impressed quality service food  <EOR> Based reviews bf decided check place out  pretty bad experience  won't deny happy hour selections pretty good but drinks awful  service turned off most  Having waitress come take orders took 10mins then another 10mins passed then another finally asked another waitress where drinks she apologized put in  then took another 15mins appetizers come out  did apologize saying system down then looked didn't enough staff  tried keep mind but still couldn't help but bitter  annoyed didn't even want Hookah  weren't only people unhappy day  tables around also complaining  Might just bad day but enough turn off  Maybe few months might give another chance   if still around  <EOR> I very excited Laziza reading Yelp reviews but left sorely disappointed  ambiance seemed very inviting first until realized couldn't even read menu dark  didn't help DJ terrible affinity Black Eyed Peas no less five songs them two hours other top 40 junk bass jacked high literally shaking chair friends yell any chance hearing each other   I could forgiven those shortcomings service product decent but  where Laziza really fell down  took waitress twenty minutes beers she didn't offer water  ordered apple hookah when hadn't received forty five minutes approached nearest waiter asked happened  He responded he would waitress  Twenty minutes later she still hadn't shown track down  She gave hurried excuse forgetting eventually hookah without enough mouthpieces group  took another twenty minutes come back during which noticed hookah tasted awful  more black licorice apple  pointed waitress assured correct flavor without bothering double check  ordered another beer which she forgot water which she forgot more mouthpieces which she also forgot about  Meanwhile watched spill drink girl table next us  Disaster   Given horrible experience service group did want leave tip  However because six people she automatically added 18% tip tab sure if asked take off would've wait another half hour just bit bullet left  never return  <EOR> Laziza place be! Great food kabobs hummus amazing all very well priced  atmosphere very relaxing nice way unwind long day  pretty large restaurant lounge there's lot seating plenty room  times gone participated awesome Lebanese dance there's always good times had! live all way summerlin but still drive eastern 215 definitely worth drive!  laziza won't disappointed! <EOR> After having good kick back time Yelp CME Misti friends broke off group met some friends Laziza   So little later everyone else but already table set drinks ready poured   walked DJ spinning hip hop   music wasn't loud transition hip hop house other genre well done mixed     I didn't order any food time but them before   hookah just coming workers kept coal ashes clean     Love place late night hate location but worth drive every time go  <EOR> Nice bartender pleasant attentive   The hummus best Vegas advertised rather plain  calamari good  price also very reasonable  <EOR> I've few times night bar scene hookahs but finally made other night dinner 2 friends  am huge fan Mediterranean cuisine pretty excited   plus Groupon Now! $13 $26 deal    Once arrived disappointment groupon working! restaurant's fault but definitely huge let down    We ordered handful appetizers couple glasses wine half off during happy hour great deal! definitely enjoyable however phenomenal Mediterranean cuisine Manhattan therefore wasn't overly impressed  entrees disappointing Unfortunately kebab wraps did much meat them friends didn't seem enjoy them much  plate rice salad beef shawarma   sp? beef bit dry plus asked spicy possible came mild  won't going back entrees however appetizers drinks during happy hour definitely worth going back for!  Service fantastic  waiter seemed busy but still managed attentive provide thorough information each dishes  He definitely helpful when couldn't decide order    There some sort open mic night going other room should honestly scheduled later hours  Freestyle rap isn't exactly people want hear during dinner Mediterranean restaurant    Overall would back during happy hour various appetizers share amongst friends <EOR> Five stars hard come but thought it    thought think Laziza truly does deserve five star    I don't smoke hookah but couple times hang friends  good location since only live couple miles away  ambiance Laziza really cultural very nice place hang friends    As other reviews said live DJ  also dancing area but crowded packed club would plus me  For those shy dancing being seen then might something you  DJ plays mix Arabic Persian American hip hop R B music  personally think nice mix    I also tried filet mignon kabob delicious! kabob also came house salad soup day  tried lentil soup also surprisingly good  menu extensive sense Mediterranean wise but extensive enough those just want burger fries shrimp scampi    Most importantly service great! all times staff always seems eager help sure okay    I definitely recommend next hang friends held here  If area definitely stop give try! You'll surprise! <EOR> Not shabby sure if worth more stars     1   Location Great location strip mall easy parking easy to   2   Ambiance really nice relaxing  early no music which allowed talk converse peace   3   Service bad yet place could improvement area adequate terrific   4   Price Very Reasonable   5   Food hummos very nice texture  babaghanoush succulant its wonderful smoke grilled flavor   All entrees okay great would expected more great flavors all other foods   ordered dish extra steamed vegetables instead order frozen type vegetables fried oil instead steamed    Check place out  Remember Hookah actually healthy you! <EOR> I came dinner few Yelpers sit drinks    I originally wanted Baklava tini but then server said didn't martini glasses would wait mojito $10 instead  alright but bit heavy citrus element  server friendly though    The table shared guava mango hookah $15   Even though lost taste hookah smoking long time ago knew wasn't premium tobacco when saw them lift replace coals quite syrupy stuff probably type mu'assel possibly even tobacco based but herbal based but would open foil really tell  throat feel think grown find enjoyable  However don't deny flavor tasted good     We during Raggae night live band playing  wasn't loud even though right front band  Lots people having fun dancing vibe good    I wouldn't say would come seek place but if around other side town friends want smoke don't mind accompanying them  <EOR> All co workers day showed working noticeably hungover cause? Laziza  next week decided join them debauchery Makeout Mondays   Laziza epitomizes all hookah lounge should be dimly lit DJ pumping good music corner dance floor which night vanity rather function well stocked bar drink specials throughout night  hookah mix various tropical fruits I believe mango pineapple mint boy smooth  usually fan hookah but every time hose came way town    As drinks many stipulations drink specials  coworker disappointed he couldn't partake two dollar vodka drinks since ladies stipulation he'd dispute! Also order all deals drinks order bar detail overlooked waitress when asked subsequently ordered her  However overlook fine details only place where bartenders waitresses know White Boy is  Having never heard coworker ordered Blue Moon mixed some orange juice shot Amaretto  favorite drinks definitely ordered elsewhere but proportions never perfected Laziza  night progressed crazy coworker ordered round Lemon Drop shots  perfect way end night some dancing few embarrassing photos afterwards   I now appeal Laziza  Drink specials dancing dim lighting leads uninhibited actions which case coworkers both excellent dangerous thing  left around 3 4 only return work 6 all inflicted terrible hangover desire fall back asleep once off  Thank Laziza! <EOR> What love place scene  Fridays open mic night DJ! good time nice diverse crowd  food drinks could use some work but only entertainment  hookah expensive all  15 bucks 1 hour 25 four unlimited  <EOR> My friends decided drop Friday night whim   We'd never before but upon entering looked very promising  interior lot larger expected escorted smoking section building    The service excellent however apparently Friday night open mic night making impossible conversation without yelling over music  As important part hookah subpar best   Having smoking years really disappointing all awesome reviews   Trying service fix harshness shisha even harder loud music  think stick making own bowls smoke home  <EOR> Happy Hour 5pm 8pm  Half off appetizers wine beers well drinks   The selection appetizers limited six appear menu  rest items reasonably priced if those satisfy  None those small bites over $10 during HH  hummus baba ganoush crab falafels hot wings two mixed plates good sharing  baba ganoush delicious came 8 pieces pita wipe goodness  wings standard coming order six  hot sauce made garlic chili sauce used Chinese cooking    Beers wine seem way HH  mojito would considered well drink even if used stock rum came full price  half off drinks need simple well alcohol+mixer  Otherwise treads line signature drink specialty drink  mojito good nonetheless   The service mindful two different servers checking often  <EOR> We thinking looked nice outside might cool place try   Walking decor inside very disappointing thought place looked orange colored dinner  also empty which should tell great place   The waiter brought menu menu selection pretty small Mediterranean place  didn't really care seemed usually like  Well two things wanted    falafels boyfreind's Kabob  Mediterranean resto those 2 items? We ended ordering fattoush salad falafels less mezza plate some sandwich boyfriend  salad sandwich impressive  mezza plate very good tabbouli  hummus good but best Las Vegas as claim didn't care stuffed grape leaves baba ganoush all  The waiter friendly but overall place nothing special no ambiance menu options food taste pretty weak    I seriously doubt business very long  don't think going back  much better options Mediterranean restaurants valley  <EOR> I definitely NEVER visiting horrible hookah lounge again    Overly loud music!   Bad hookah!   HORRIBLE service!   and did mention HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service!   Do waste your money most important  your time  <EOR> My husband hounding nonstop since Brazilian restaurant closed down sign place came up  didn't really want mainly because smoking anything doesn't appeal me   Finally week couldn't put off anymore because we're moving few weeks SW side town   We decided actually eat meal hookah thing   beef shawarma wrap   came some nice garlic paste which since ate years ago Zankou Chicken Los Angeles   sandwich pretty yummy but sadly didn't compare Zankou   If just crave pita would most likely Crazy Pita here   pita griddled little wrap form slightly hard shell around filling which kind cool   salad came fresh light but little heavy red onion   also fries if salad isn't your bag   husband shawarma plate which same thing dish but decomposed plus comes nice plate rice   sure flavors rice but pretty good   highlight meal side hummus taste   full garlic very vinegary hummus hating husband actually really liked it     As hookah stuff itself never done before can't compare other similar places   wouldn't say hated but didn't love either   mixed fruit flavor which tasty very relaxing   happy hour really cheap worth overall   The service good lounge area where everyone smokes hookah warm nice   If staying neighborhood would again   Monday Night Football flat screens good place watch game relax   m sure however if worth driving way for  <EOR> After work last night 7 24 11 friend Jerry J  mentioned should grab some food  both drove prospective homes then he came pick 5 seconds later  Hmmm    where go? He suggested Greek food because #1 he knows Greek food  #2 he never tried Mediterranean food !!! #3 he's scoping food if he didn't possible trip December might happen   Let known just Mexican food scene Vegas small exceptions Greek food scene Vegas limited crap kai Kronos gyros  wasn't sure where could even any sort Mediterranean food 11 PM  remembered Laziza close houses might well check out  he drove around parking lot down street few times he wasn't sure whether he going try food not    he's VERY picky he finally inside   Umm    WTF?! WHY don't clubs Vegas play music this? most FABULOUS hyphy rap hip hop mix BLASTING when walked inside  Sunday night dare say music better even Vanity  Heaven  Pure Heaven  walked guy sitting little room off left asked if place open dinner he quickly jumped grabbed menus led booth bar    It took LONG time waiter come over take order  Because asked just pick whatever off menu both ordered Mezze sampler share $20 gyro fries $9 Jerry try  took long time food come sampler coming 10 minutes gyro  Jerry being fish water place asked everything plate shaved meat  pita bread  cucumber sauce telling about   What's sauce?  Jerry     ketchup your fries  Hehehe    He said he really liked gyro thank God but can't comment didn't try but falafel best ever had  Usually falafel dense heavy but when hot light crispy  Yum! tabouli forgettable baba ghanoush which another dish usually dislike very good  no dolmades which mentioned description but rather two types hummus being very smoky neither being good  well labnah better home should served cold much runny dip its warm form   Everything plate sans falafel baba ghanoush better tasting home sure    The atmosphere great if could give place 200 stars music would  dancing around seat everybody else  Unfortunately nobody really dance floor wasn't going dance all myself restaurant  sure want come back some friends just grab drink dance    A mezze sampler missing dolmades gyro diet coke two waters + $7 tip came to    $41  Ridiculous! service way slow should step game  mezze needs come down price but give 4 stars because going crazy great music atmosphere  Definitely coming back  <EOR> Not thoroughly impressed laziza hostess waitress new give some slack but she didn't know anything menu hours happy hour happy hour specials were  didn't any sugar salt pepper ketchup table ask everything  didn't draft beers tap even though menu said did  compliment them falafel which tasty  <EOR> Unfortunately wasn't able sample any larger portions food but night during college function say atmosphere very trendy lively  far little party appetizers big fan hummus pita bread served    Our function DJ course some mainstream music bumping but besides ambience dim welcoming little cozy hookahs featured tasty  drawbacks bar little pricey but then again wasn't bad given atmosphere  Am definitely interested come back place again 2nd more in depth review! <EOR>
