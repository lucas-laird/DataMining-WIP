Most buffet goers HUGE two three plates piled pudgy arms  BUFFET folks they're running food anytime soon! don't think even recession hit place would again if comp coupon but otherwise I'd skip it  <EOR> I feel bad giving just 1 star but price place should've more variety  lunch sadly say best thing ate Mac Cheese  extremely small selection choose honestly didn't want eat anything felt bad because family price tried eat much possible  would prefer going hometown buffet do still exists?! because memory wayyy more variety  Nothing special place say spend your $ better buffet  <EOR> This decent buffet good buffet's prices but selection fairly moderate here  breakfast usual hot trays laden rolled blinis pancakes muffins plenty meats etc  etc  all here  all seemed pretty rotated fresh no problems there  Nothing really stands except selection bit light  line also smaller some but really nothing special all buffet compared other places  If mood buffet close hand would fine but nothing your way for  another all buffets Vegas most likely stand line wait for   debatably worth it    <EOR> the reason come vegas   the buffets! sadly hungover wasn't feeling 100% but know good food taste nonetheless  looked best buffets vegas buffet hilton among top 3 all reviews checked  sushi bar best probably main reason come back  sliders super tasty pizza other seafood  dessert options definitely cherry top  we'd come back sure  <EOR> Much rest LVH Buffet sliding downhill   used surprisingly good value now much better well run Golden Corral   Spend 50% extra Carnival Buffet Rio better food quality better selection  <EOR> This awful drunk which really saying something  Only half stuff labeled  fried chicken needed dipped water edible  Desserts terrible too  Stay away spend your $24 elsewhere  <EOR> Very friendly service    Loved all drink champagne     Good variety food    Omelette bar pretty good friendly kKlm <EOR> Eek! Methinks exactly thinking when walking around buffet area  boyfriend staying Las Vegas Hotel budget trips casino gave two complimentary buffet passes dinner  FREE buffet passes but am still giving star  regular price dinner around $21 00 per person definitely worth price buffet   Food Orange Chicken orange chicken pretty much microwaved chicken nuggets orange syrup sauce  If palette three year old would maybe enjoyed this  Chow Mein joke  chow mein all over floor counter   Carne Asada Meat Dry no flavor  Steamed Dumplings probably thing could eat buffet decent flavor texture  think ate 6 dumplings  Fried Chicken batter overly crispy chicken meat super dry  couldn't finish it   Pasta pasta bar reuses cocktail shrimp  nothing special it  Ice Cream ice cream soft serve vanilla chocolate which wasn't special  pretty much melts straight when lands your ice cream bowl    Service ladies nice but also seemed same sentiments did wanting buffet    And top all off? nice old stomach ache when left buffet chowed down some pepto bismol pills help stomach process all crappy food just ate    Bottom line free but probably wouldn't come back if paid me  McDonalds down street I'd rather dine $2 22 Big Mac  <EOR> $21 each person   Moderate size  Beef Brisket Truth   much flavor lot smokey flavor fat melts your mouth  worth your money buffet vegas  <EOR> Didn't place   Didn't think fresh either   Feeding trough place overpriced   Wished la carte menu which didn't   The only good thing cinammon donut   Skip place  <EOR> Decent well prepared  If convention LV convention center take short walk enjoy  <EOR> WORST VEGAS BUFFET EVER!!!  My fiancé only came because free buffet voucher  If weren't free meal would never come since reviews weren't exactly stellar   The only good thing buffet nice waitress  She really paid attention drink refills minded plates    Everything else just horrible    food just bland  The pizza made wish eating little caesars instead  Tortillas just stuck each other    pry them apart grabbing more actually needed  wasn't much selection  The asian' section consisted most unnaturally orange orange chicken sigh    The soft serve ice cream just flavored churned water  gross  The pumpkin pie worst EVER had  I'd rather pick some grocery bakery  just previous reviewers said    sweets tastes its diabetics  The soft serve ice cream area container full gummy bears    fiancé ate said hard rock  no idea long those gummies sitting there  soft serve ice cream bar sprinkles vase cork it    ONLY DECORATION!!! does that?! I also saw piece apple pie HAIR IT!!!   Oh wait    did take something good buffet    stuffed purse few cereal boxes left over breakfast time  couldn't mess cereal up    Next time    We're going actually pay visit buffet M instead  <EOR> Can say nasty?!?!?  Good thing didn't pay it  Would def come back even if comes free free beer <EOR> I wish could confidently support place but majority food dry cold lacked flavor   tables around left dirty wrappers paper napkins left floor   saw rated signs received am perplexed visit buffet   Don't waste your money   Run away if someone tells eat here  <EOR> Went group 7 champagne brunch Saturday   seated all table made 6 front place couple metal signs right next us   Every time half eat around them   hostess also embarressed ladies group   She said Champagne comes buffet but since expecting she pregnant   comment ruined meal day rest trip   mention hear rest trip   food wasn't bad except crab legs   am sure if old just prepared correctly but meat sticking inside shells almost impossible eat   Las Vegas multiple times all dining options $25 would skip place next time  <EOR> My conclusion buffet specially catered old folks can't salt sugar diets  would never came if weren't $50 gift card got  guess place going down soon trying save cost prolong its lifespan    Basically everything tasteless  Nothing taste look like  Chicken doesn't taste chicken corn doesn't taste corn  really don't know amazing robbed taste everything is  3 oysters 2 tasteless 1 bitter  afraid try anything else seafood bar that  everything frozen year boiled shit everything before serving  raw oyster deal really no idea could be  orange chicken very obvious frozen chicken nuggets + sauce  can't remember else bad    don't even want try remember    If salt free sugar free diet stop buffet  <EOR>
