ANGARA INDIA SPICE GRILL TRUSTED! We visited Angara India Spice Grill lunch today expecting try new restaurant  Instead ended leaving disappointed angry  Here's story Wife found coupon Restaurant com place which we'd never tried before  coupon $25 it cost $10 minimum purchase $50  net cost in retail restaurant amounts $15  Angara India Spice Grill strip mall near Target store  least two OUTSTANDING Indian restaurants neighborhood  Curry Leaf Mint  exactly shopping another Indian food place but coupon worth try first timers  Reviews posted usual sites positive  Good food Clean place  Certainly Angara enticing those enjoy Indian cuisine  We arrived exactly 2 32 pm Tuesday afternoon  Note exact time because important  website hours door posted LUNCH 11 am  3 pm  28 minutes prior close  Dinner began 5 pm  We seated told coupon would valid  Indian waiter presumably also owner manager said coupon did apply lunch buffet  way ONLY CUSTOMERS restaurant  We explained interested buffet  planned order off menu would gladly order $50 worth food  waiter manager owner stated firmly would able order off menu  stated would pay dinner prices even though coupon made no distinction between lunch dinner   Waiter manager owner weasel then fabricated some tale lunch ala cart menu ends 2 30  Wait  restaurant open lunch until 3 pm  But can't order off menu 2 30  now 2 32  Seriously? I stand stunned silence begin march towards front door  Wife just much bulldog if wrong buttons pushed tells waiter manager owner would gladly taken lunch anyway could even off buffet  restaurant would charge $50 two new customers waiter would even earn $10 tip 20 percent   hell TURNING AWAY customers? PLACE EMPTY! I parking lot wife said she wanted back inside tell more she thought situation   Wife inside explained we'd become loyal customers competition Curry Leaf entirely because offered coupon first timers ended producing perhaps 50 60 visits over next three years  Don't see UPSIDE offering meal honoring own coupon? Instead excuses  don't list details coupon  even reinvent hours operation spot  Of course NEVER GOING BACK  history  Dead us  see completely empty restaurant turn away two paying customers which guarantees them some profit along upside future loyalty strikes monumental stupidity  This situation handled very very poorly  urge others avoid Angara India Spice Grill  word cannot trusted! <EOR> Yummy! hit place diner when family town last year end dropping over $200 dinner 7 us worth every penny! flavors   the spices   mmmm! figured if dinner delicious then lunch buffet would disappoint girlfriend agreed! best Indian restaurants Vegas <EOR> The ambiance restraunt very nice peaceful  tried mango lassi very watery hoping thicker more flavorful lassi worth 4 99  also ordered chicken biryani Channa masala both spicyness level 8  biryani came nice big portion very flavorful could taste all spices ate raita mellow spicyness however level 8 spicy think! channa masala good!

All food very flavorful dish except naan course mild  spicy food but tolerance weakened grow older don't tell hasn't happened someone know!    Okay  The fried thingies oddly bland even though batter SPICY  Chicken tikka Surprisingly moist tender! Beautiful color  SPICY  Chicken Korma Subtle blend flavors noted MILD menu but guess what? SPICY! Naan bit dry missing buttery caress  only thing spicy    Even tamarind sauce SPICY!  Bottom line order again but only when mood mouth searing meal  flavors excellent could eat Chicken Tikka every night week even sandwiches think cucumber slices raita folded naan pita   But continue search Indian restaurant more line perception mild  medium  SPICY! So 5 stars minus 1 because pretty much want something mild when order something  described menu mild! <EOR> A much welcomed addition Indian buffet scene west side  buffet every bit good favorite places Tamba India Palace  usual choices buffet tandoori tikka masala saag veggie korma  chicken korma new one  Piping hot naan lots ice glass water which refilled without having ask  Never understand why some Indian places serve luke warm water no ice  Best part both kheer gulab jamen dessert great  Only negative TV blasting some Bollywood version Sabado Gigante idiocy   Anyway thoroughly enjoyed food back! <EOR> I just tikka masala fix took mom brunch date here  no idea expect since both first time checking place but certainly disappointed   First foremost very clean welcoming environment  buffet section good amount dishes ranging small salad bar main entrees  meet chef William very friendly made point chat every customer restaurant  He told Monday's he best days come buffet since selections often change every day  try nearly every dish except goat curry course favorite masala  Every dish seasoned cooked perfectly! really taste spiciness without overpowering actual dish  When came dessert gulab jamun which essentially milk based fried ball syrup tamarind chutney  Both super delicious although recommend eating them together since both flavors profoundly opposite spectrums    Overall would absolutely recommend restaurant anyone loves wants try Indian food  way buffet only $10 99  Very good deal! <EOR> One best places eaten Indian food Las Vegas lunch buffet!!! Came try place passing many times let tell legit! Very clean nice restaurant customer service 5 stars food  just couple faves  <EOR> We fortunate stumble upon place  arrived just lunch buffet started  atmosphere stunning  gives fine dining feel when walk in  tried chicken curry first delicious! Then tried just everything else equally impressed  Angara also reasonably priced  Great service! Great food! <EOR> It pains write negative review place having some good experiences beginning but several VERY disappointing meals delivered both bitesquad taken felt need share experience hopes owners chef some changes  add am relatively new Indian food don't proclaim expert  first visit very good thought Naan bread little thin overdone but improved second batch later visits  Butter chicken initially good but second third visits then ordering take delivery two occasions quality dropped significantly  last order really craving butter chicken begged husband give them another shot hoping would turnaround meal  ordered garlic shrimp butter chicken jasmine rice because last time ordered peas pilau actually vegetable rice instead  garlic shrimp expected full bell pepper onions no hint garlic but being newer Indian cuisine sure error based expectation versus reality dish  flip side menu didn't describe dish any way  really review based on  real reason poor review though based butter chicken  pieces chicken pathetically small sparse  top gristle cartilage last batch consistency seasoning very all over place  Going almost hot eat spice level 2 bland no heat 1  initially excited place people work own place really nice sweet  But IMO there's no excuse charging $14 99 dish barely any chicken some seriously poor quality control  <EOR> Sooooooo good!  Lunch buffet awesome   few different meat dishes vegetable samosa etched etc    flavor everything great just right kick   really really enjoyed chicken tiki marsala   Oh 3 plates even asked if would box go   Wow great service!     but declined having already stuffed myself   yourself favor there   now! <EOR> Great Indian buffet   Clean restaurant staff friendly  quick   food really well prepared   just right spice   goat tender chicken well   find if cube chicken dish cook becomes tough over cooked   case very tender   Overall give 5 star rating hard earn   Amhara keep good work excellent standards  <EOR> Very good food away strip!!
