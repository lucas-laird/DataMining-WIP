Nobody wants hear very off putting  only reason why didn't put star because place food good  <EOR> We 2 us Friday night packed  30 minutes wait which isn't terrible stayed  Usually when wait grab drink but standing bar seemed uncomfortable amount time no acknowledging gave wait outside  asked few hostesses if way someone able drink while wait she said only option wait bar  already tried no luck  quite few empty tables wasn't sure why wait  drink situation wanted leave but knew boyfriend wanted come awhile stayed  noticed lot people came seated before us  getting pretty upset but thought maybe due them having reservations  going ask but then seated  Obviously far experience wasn't best but reason still gave 4 stars because thought service once sat down great! entire staff works well together! never restaurant where everyone helps each other way did  Everyone very nice  server Laura that's bill said hope  correct she great! Always selling which worked! she did job well  Never overwhelmed being busy definitely give some props her! restaurant itself really pretty trendy  Food good  Overall would come back would recommend friends but if definitely reservation weekday  <EOR> This very popular spot many Las Vegans visited thinking would busy  wrong  Thankfully served right away because opted seated outside  windy cold but thank god covers made prevented draft entering    The ambiance romantic many guests dining significant others  But also enjoyed friends family room filled muffled chats everyone    Our server overly friendly she helped order food checked pretty frequently  really cared your beverage filled rim often came back refill drinks when necessary  quite impressive me    We ordered Chicken Pesto Bolognese White Truffle Garlic Bread    Chicken Pesto thought pasta cooked thoroughly which made enjoy chicken instead  But delicious overall  always thought pesto didn't taste much happy learn different style pesto hints flavor plate  wasn't salty taste hints garlic it  Delicious    Bolognese Loved cheese meat sauce it  simple but heightened another way enjoyed every bite meal  Would order again? Certainly    Garlic Bread heard lot good things plate but wasn't impressed it  understand made truffle but wasn't enough give wow factor me  also thought side cheese little weird couldn't figure if indeed cheese butter    Also serving garlic bread delayed gave other table next us  surprise apologized mishap made fresh batch free charge  <EOR>
