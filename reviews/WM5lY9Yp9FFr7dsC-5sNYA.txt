This best concert venues Las Vegas  miss Jillian's  Just someone else said  Its kinda Dave Busters  Hope something else opens just Jillians  <EOR> Jillian's pretty much only place hunk junk known Neonopolis ever anyone easy see why   Its appeal pretty universal   restaurant giant arcade bowling alley bar music venue dance club all rolled however everything place doesn't always mean awesome   some good times Jillian's but if hanging downtown top choice places go   I ate once ex husband although he left bad taste mouth food pretty good   your typical American Apostrophe restaurant cuisine   arcade fun but no measure Dave Buster's why don't THOSE?  jeez!    bowling fun  sure   little more expensive other alternatives Sam's Town Gold Coast but groovy balls blacklit lanes all time nerd things that   Also friend Ryan fell asleep bowling benches let sleep there  I guess  plus if tired friend much if transient population downtown  bar bit pricey doesn't much way pizazz DJ dance floor notoriously lame   Lots local bands some touring acts play time time   never gone those shows frankly kinda baffled where set them up   One ex boyfriends once tried frisky banquet rooms   kind girl smelled salad dressing passed   But if  your bag there's always possibility  <EOR> I participated panel Amplify Music Festival where took place   Jillian's recognizable variety Dave Buster's genre video games booze know?    I'm afficianado he genre skee ball kids aight?  But did spend enjoyable Vegas afternoon indoor bowling alley   manufactured decent white russian while pizza nachos ordered TERRIBLE!!!  They also live music venue downstairs probably sets Jillian's apart other Dave Buster's type places   didn't actually show can't review aspect   The video games looked tossed off thought nothing looked interesting except white water rafting game ?!? looked interesting  The decor reminscent your standard TGIF  <EOR> oh! city where there's MUCH do? where most locals Vegas hang out?  Skee Ball hot dudes offering teach handle ball  Pool tables reach over ever sexily hit cue    i love Jillian's Seattle  local buddies crew LA attending someone's birthday party  location pretty average  scene pretty laid back but local men completely prowling fresh meat  almost feel desperation  <EOR> I can't believe really over  reluctant believe Phillip C  but when saw own 2 eyes nearly brought tears  Other 99 cent deep fried twinkies oreos Mermaids really no other reason downtown except Jillian's IT missed  Especially concerts  <EOR> I variety live music every weekend beer buffet good memories  But overall better ways fun off Strip  Saw Arch Enemy Machine Head last September    someone really screwed booking venue because downstairs ballroom definitely isn't built metal  sound bad openers Throwdown cut 4 songs could fix staticky PA time headliners  definitely soured things first time seeing Machine Head live impressed professionalism delivering goods even substandard accomodations  Reggae local punk great here   but steer clear if bill involves downtuning lot double bass  cursing lot night  neither drunk  Nor sailor  <EOR> Oh Jillians     what experience   As winding down big day strip decided check Fremont Street    wow    what change pace ad scenery    Jillian's similar but cool as Dave Busters   We bowled under black light drank cocktails which pretty cool  <EOR>
