The only thing Pasta Fresh might need little patience comes getting your food  process making any pasta dishes takes time  garlic knots server telling making fresh takes  time but she great making sure know its coming apologize wait   open kitchen could see cooks rolling dough cutting each sheet order going out  Time consuming but worth wait  Open kitchen self entertainment especially if dining alone  long bar table perfect bird eye view everything going kitchen    The prices reasonable  cheap Olive Garden pasta but upscale pasta lot great options  overpriced would strip looking great place take family pasta night Pasta Fresh great option  know come any carb loading day  <EOR> Thoroughly enjoyed pan seared scallops spicy truffle cauliflower mash wild mushrooms  flavors worked  perfectly together created although ridiculous sounding resembled something taste bud symphony  Tasted bit other dishes family ordered all just flavorful  garlic knots really good overly garlicky tasted homemade  Korean tempura cauliflower must    The owner chef stopped table say hi which pretty cool  passion good fusion food contagious  <EOR> After reading all reviews place excited try it  love some pasta! check in deal free macaroon  Unfortunately felt bit disappointed  bf drop around 3 30pm Sunday there's only other party there  decide pesto steak rigatoni sausage tomato based sauce the pictures menu some garlic knots top off pistachio macaroon   Waited 10 minutes two pasta dishes came out  Looked pretty good  sausage dish pretty good but sauce did seem fresh  seemed store bought tomato sauce little extra  pesto rigatoni alright  Now am saying dishes bad all decent but end still paying $13 per plate quick pasta lunch  idea build your own pasta its kinda nice though   We didn't garlic knots pasta before pasta which seemed right order  When almost done pasta asked knots informed burned first batch bring soon  Even macaroon before that  knots pretty good though   The macaroon however made very sad  dinky little thing size quarter  just brought them fridge when tried bite pretty hard sitting around fridge little while  didn't eat it   In conclusion bad place but definitely great  many awesome dining options Vegas especially area convenient probably won't back  hoping could new go to pasta fix  Oh well  But bf kinda liked place  <EOR> My boyfriend wanted try place reading previous reviews  Luckily groupon place  opted 19 dollar which includes large pasta large salad order garlic knots    We ordered sausage tagliatelle house salad garlic knots course! Well brought pasta first??! then she said salad little bit  then garlic knots  would knots first then salad then obviously pasta  But salad last  Never seen such thing  Why did take longer salad pasta?   The pasta just ok bad but great  salad very bitter dressing did well greens  garlic knots burnt  seemed potential being good but burnt bottom    Overall service good food disappointing  <EOR> We groupon good deal   However without groupon bill would close $50 which crazy place this   Food good arugula salad which amazing!  chicken fettuccini flavor great but noodles hard very over cooked   boyfriend spicy mariana shrimp delicious!
