She pretty good sport she sent back another gyro next plastic free   service great pricing definitely increased since last time there   $12 chicken gyro w fries soda just way much  That before tip <EOR> Food very delicious  Little bit wait but well worth because food made fresh  Customer service very friendly  15% gratuity included all dine in  chicken boti shish kabob very tasty  Would come back again <EOR> Visiting Vegas again  Wanted some Mediterranean food  Found place yelp  Reviews mixed  learned own judgement  place great service awesome food  buffet items limited but flavor huge  Chicken tiki delicious  Lamb absolutely best  Mediterranean but best  If traveling Vegas great place come some lunch buffet  <EOR> great food love place recommend chicken kabab    service its great feel home everything tried good place its nice clean   <EOR> The food DELICIOUS! ordered behari kabob roll goat karahi boneless chilli chicken rice salad all very tasty! host Arham polite kind prompt accommodating  soon entered restaurant immediately he service better atmosphere he directed sit outside  restaurant clean nice romantic touch it  Several times Arham would check refill glasses  also requested Arham change music he listened took immediate action  When food arrived overwhelmed thought wouldn't able finish but finished every single bite  naans mouth watering chilli chicken heavenly behari kabob wrap amazing!

Terrible! worker watches eat while time  Just standing around watching eat ideal if ask me  <EOR> Amazing food especially chicken beef kabobs chili chicken  restaurant 3 days row while stay Vegas  customer service outstanding well  Would highly recommend <EOR> Food consistent prices down based cashiers which probably pocketing difference <EOR> Service food both great! would definitely return here  Down earth food seemed authentic  <EOR> Been loyal customer since little shop downtown  Stuck them even when switched finer location  Stuck them even when raised prices because food service always consistent  However today thoroughly disappointed  food but fact don't serve water your meal  don't it     new trend? If into restaurant spend 40 60$ least cup nice refreshing water meal but instead continuously buy water bottles which priced 2$ pop  I'd more understanding if fast food chain its but your own water but fact location should more upscale would incline believe ice cold cup water meal  only reason give two stars because chili chicken alway consistent great tasting  However far hostess well she kind just sits there  There's no hello  welcome   <EOR> Good customer service poor atmosphere food OK but very overpriced get  paid $22 tip plate Masala Chicken rice water  going back  <EOR> Restaurant name exterior signage implies serve Mediterranean food located corner  Neither things actually true  During lunch offer buffet but during dinner hours main menu handful Mediterranean dishes falafel app shawarma plates pitas but mostly Indian dishes?  It challenge order basic Greek salad protein because language barrier cashier unfamiliar menu  Every question asked he would take kitchen staff answer then come back still unable answer question   My simple order Greek salad $9 menu no description apparently w o protein? plus lamb rang shawarma plate $14 all sides substituted salad  No dressing flatware napkins pita included takeout order  Tasted just fine but definitely overpriced   This spot should consider name change reflect namesake kabobs Mediterranean cuisine describe  majority menu offerings   NOTE menu states all dine orders charged 15% service fee  Maybe if staff trained wouldn't force customers tip  <EOR> Great food service!! Very authentic   nice spot eat enjoy fast meal while go  <EOR> This place shady shit don't here  food alright goat biryani which ok except menu price didn't match billed for  Apparently somewhere menu also mentions fact automatic gratuity which always lame shady  If order water bottle water grocery store which charge $2 for  Finally only young woman working front person back obviously slow service  won't business much longer don't help them meantime  <EOR> Really good food great service!!! beef tikka kabob beef nihari  Very flavorful delicious  <EOR> I ordered chicken tikka special since used pervious location time serving came weird way chicken tikkas separate dish rice salad  separate square bowl  Its very awkward uncomfortable  should kept all big plate  Hope ll realize soon since its new setup  Rice came wasn't fresh all microwaved yesterday day before  Servers so  Knockout burger $8 just burger plate no fries any sort side that  Although don't expect lot Desi Restaurants but felt little less  <EOR> The tikka kabob amazing  kids really enjoyed eating outside loved food  service good waiter very nice  <EOR> Absolutely love place    Amazing service food  coming 3 days row lol can't enough burgers especially coming LA where good halal burgers rare  Can't wait guys branch LA  <EOR> I ordered chicken kabob chicken substance served felt more a sausage  tasted ok   Price cheap  Wouldn't recommend  <EOR> This place recommended friend Greek place Vegas   understatement decade! little bit closing but still served best Greek food ever entire life am 45 years old!  strongly recommend Chicken Tikki Masala side long grain rice!  If could give 10 star review five star review would   super fresh base curry chicken literally melted mouth! wondering if died gone Greek  heaven!!!  first time but last sure   work right down street place now frequent least once twice week!!!  think want try everything menu now     probably eventually!!!    of <EOR> This place didn't even pop when searched nearby restaurants am staying hotel less 5 minute walk   way Chinese place next door when walked buffet sign   walked take peek line stayed   Most indian buffets hit mainly serve chicken   place   Goat lamb also being served!  back more tandoori chicken which super moist chicken tikka   Both delish naan came hot fresh!  Can't wait another trip back!! <EOR> First time waiters seem really stressed overworked although very friendly tell barely keeping together kind feel bad them  But main issue place wait time food   came right around 8 15  seated lamb shawarma plate  didn't receive food till 9 00  45 min way much time only complained once though food came that  But lot mad customers also waiting long food complaining  Time money   far food lamb shawarma ok great pretty oily kind salty imo rice ok house salad just two slice tomatoes couple slivers onions 5 pieces lettuce  star actually getting food  12 99 lamb shawarma don't mind but u reemed Coke 2 50 yes fountain drink made mad  Oh also watch 15% gratuity  automatically added bill  woulda tipped more but hey did me  place potential but needs lot work getting food customer time  Shoulda just gone mint India bistro next door  <EOR> Went because within walking distance where staying  service itself nice but worst hummus ever tried  Chicken Beef kebab those okay  would again unless am really starving death around there  <EOR> We tried other Pakistani Indian food restaurants say food impressive but bad either  amazed food  spicy all if don't spicy food place might better you  customer service okay same thing food great  <EOR> Great food loved buffet burger well!
