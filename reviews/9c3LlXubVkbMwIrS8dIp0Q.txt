GREAT! <EOR> The food fairly average customer service bad    I agree previous reviewer mentioned woman working register   did name but assume or hope could multiple employees this? same woman   She acted completely disinterested point being rude   husband greeted kindly normal human being she just barely acknowledged him   Throughout order she behaved if inconveniencing ordering food   am confused why she chooses work she seems really hate it    To owners kind employee want first person your customers come contact with   Actually probably shouldn't want someone acting ever interact your customers if want them come back   just chalked being unhappy person unconcerned quality work  As stated above food mostly average quality flavor   burger disappointingly bland but able both ribs burgers same plate   No need decide which get!  Still both sliders ribs lacking flavor   Overall whole meal slightly sweet   Would great something spicy acidic balance all out   Maybe should gotten slaw instead fries! Sadly though going back see if any difference   food didn't leave much impression staff left bad one  <EOR> Had Wagyu $14 burger    horrible!!! Way over cooked gourmet any means!!!

Located Downtown Summerlin Ribs Burgers another addition growing number restaurants located still new downtown area west side Las Vegas valley   When walk review menu on wall then place your order counter your right   Quick easy once know want although seems little awkward stand front main entrance while take respectable choices first time   Three first time felt partially blocking door while made selections   I ordered Beef Ribs wife ordered Original Burger Bacon Cheese ordered Beef Rib Bullets son   I beef ribs better pork drove choice first visit here   beef ribs definitely tasty but honestly average   good enough though want back try pork lamb ribs    right lamb ribs!  Unique!  sure there's no confusion I'd happily beef ribs again too   cooked well tasted great but just weren't favorite   My wife very satisfied burger   Juicy cooked just right   bit confused beef bullets ordered son though   asked counter when ordered waitress told just meat tips ribs   wasn't case   full rib bone cut into slices them bite sized bullets    good but weren't told they'd be   While order counter affair sit order staff brings your meal   Everyone courteous waiter came back table several times while enjoyed food   For fans ribs messy hands take note aren't wipes table but there's sink soap tools middle restaurant   Cool concept allowing actually wash your hands instead just wiping them tiny toilette without having bathroom but you're literally right beside another table customers when you're washing your hands   felt awkward wouldn't liked other people constantly walking table wash hands   Easy avoid sitting though   problem but again little awkward if someone sitting table right next washing station   Note non rib burger menu options including chicken wings steak grilled chicken sandwiches chicken breasts   also small selection salads vegetarian burger   kids?  Bring them   There's kid's menu   I'll definitely back try other ribs especially lamb ribs   keep posted find! <EOR> If kid special needs come here!  gentleman worried silly benches asked family leave because daughter standing bench without shoes being disruptive    Seriously?!!  spend your money somewhere else!!  places stay business such rude management?! <EOR> Ribs amazing burgers huge!  bit pricy but worth if feel lazy wanting spend all day cooking  only complaint water tastes horrible  <EOR> First let say staff great  Super friendly attentive which only reason place third star  first time ate burger great  time brought back family burgers flavorless  kind inconsistency hard want come back even though Resturant great ambiance outdoor eating great location  <EOR> My husband LOVE eat burgers  lived Las Vegas well over 20 years  many different places eat  burger which worth wait BEST BURGERS EVER!!!!  juice just pours burger  did even need any toppings  bun but did even need that  BACK  husband both LOVED LOVED LOVED it!

Everyone encountered friendly food incredible  only knock would give amount fries  all ordered side fries only needed half that  back! <EOR> Had early dinner wife around 5 30 wednesday 24th day June 2015  your typical triple digit temp day Vegas nice cool air greeted came welcome feeling   You order counter give bucket utensils two sauces it  sit down whatever table thats open then later your food  your bucket number assigned know order theirs   I ordered Ribs Combo $18   combination baby back ribs Korean short ribs  Comes your choice side cole slaw  wife Lamb Burger $14    The baby back ribs just ok  fall off bone but enough tenderness bite off bone no problems  wasnt dry but thought lacked bit flavor  squirted some barbeque sauce along fry sauce came bucket  barbeque sauce no flavor either  fry sauce really good  side your choice salad fries  chose fries  definitely good fry sauce but think everything good it  cole slaw tasted didnt enough vinegar  tasted mainly mayo  other half combo Korean short ribs  Man now really good  Marinated cooked just right  Portions generous  would back just alone   As wife's Lamb Burger she did first bite  gave couple bites well just verify  bun bit dry  ground lamb patty strong taste which think means lamb meant grounded did cook properly  side note lamb chops before straight off grill when visited Melbourne Australia some years ago let tell those chops no taste whatsoever! Ever since then anything lamb related  compare point time  told if lamb prepared cooked properly then strong taste   The service could use bit improvement  When food bring wooden cutting boards  concept but here's kind turned off first bad impression  When lady brought ribs table short ribs dangling bit off edge cutting board which caused marinated juices drip off side  kid server trail kitchen table  matters worse she put cutting board down juices continued drip down onto table  move short ribs away edge cutting board just sticky sauce would drip all over table pants  Thats just bad presentation   Some other things worth mentioning  dont any fountain drinks refill you  purchase soda way 16 oz bottles  paid 2 bucks coke zero  Thank God didnt charge just glass ice water  middle restaurant sink wash your hands in  bad idea those messy two handed eaters   Overall think need work service presentation little bet better  Food just slightly above mediocre  would try them again sometime hope things improve bit better   Yelp 2015 Review #33 532 oaverall <EOR> Very unorganized  food came four different times  First two burgers  Five minutes later fries showed then another 5 minutes frinds entree  THEN well done fries  time burger totally cold  very stingy napkins  HELLO!

My partner ordered naked turkey burger side fries cabbage salad  The burger looked more burger clump iceberg  think he envisioning lettuce wrap burger but once he 'wrapped' brain around burger salad good  He said he kept getting super salty bites cabbage salad  think liked mine more he liked his    Over all food all pretty good  really stood service! Once register every single person AWESOME helpful smiling  really felt welcomed taken care staff! service if iron few food kinks rocking little corner Downtown Summerlin! <EOR> Hopefully place closes soon  ordered signature Lamb Ribs maybe expecting something different  only ok tasting  If don't really lamb would say order much fattier expected    And must Summerlin thing ordering off board near door thank god no before cause took almost 5 mins mind  much rather ordering table  <EOR> Where's love?   The reviews Ribs Burgers kind  Most them seem growing pain issues food service menu placement timing  experience none issues  Move over Dundee could next Cinderella story down under    I came lunch some work friends based reviews very intrigued see everything would pan out  ordered off wall hanging menu opposite counter which seems issue some people but now offer paper menus which grab read while wait inline    I ordered sliders boozy milkshake  sliders meal comes two sliders all beef patty mini chicken breast  Which normal chicken breast but cut half  meal comes fries served cutting board  board does leave little room maneuver recommend asking another plate dipping sauces whatever might need    The burger delicious cooked perfect  Very juicy just touch pink middle  sauce top simply called Pink Sauce spicy aioli  insanely good addition burger added just little kick  bottles stuff service area recommend dipping your fries stuff well  Nummers!  The Chicken slider super tender super juicy  veggies piled top crisp added great texture sweetness slider  good but preferred burger chicken    The boozy milkshake Maple Bacon masterpiece  sweet fan but thing delicious  Great mix sweet salty just hint vodka which preferred overly alcoholic sweet drink  would recommend trying least once while you're here  offer flavors boozy milkshakes incase you're maple fan    Overall great experience service food vibe restaurant  didn't use sink middle restaurant preferred bathroom public cleaning  would most likely come back if lived side town    Hopefully Ribs Burgers find glass slipper serve hungry masses Las Vegas  <EOR> Luv place   DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!

Please train your servers managers customer service!!  FOOD Lamb Ribs $18 meh  BF if better Costco ribs  only able eat meat should say FAT top because everything else just tough flavorless  LITERALLY FLAVORLESS EVEN CHARCOAL LAMB FLAVOR  buried under BBQ sauce some flavor  give opinion side salad fries chose salad  Salad overdressed oil actually just SWIMMING oil  Yeah just oil     Naked Mediterranean Burger $14 should cheaper no bun  should also just name regular hamburger because could probably your fave fast food chain better burger  overlooked burnt no flavor maybe flavor but burnt away   came WILTED OLD lettuce see pic send back  manager short guy causal attire took said nothing threw back onto table  NO APOLOGY!!!

With all food competition downtown summerlin would expect place long world  But some seem while confirms pessimistic views humanity try set record straight   The place looks pretty nice  casual probably fun place hang presentation food enjoyable  let's put food slab wood style found here   But past appearance lies food should leave wondering exactly did hire run kitchen  Beef Ribs  Tough chewy borderline edible  BBQ sauce certainly A+ nothing offer here  Burgers  category probably slightly below average  few different ones both indistinguishable each other but pretty much just sloppy messes  No add ons fix buns don't appear made house nor meat seasoned all well  just slap thousand island hope best  Fries  don't even understand these  feel cardboard certainly crispy  Close flavorless  Sweet Potato Tots  Soggy seasoned  Bleh  Orange Creamsicle Shake  Okay actually good but Im just gonna Jamba if want orange creamsicle drink  Maybe drink gave place extra star  Maybe   If you're high maybe you'd place  Otherwise just pick any other 50 fast service restaurants shopping mall  <EOR> I really disappointed  lot complaints things modified experience better but due number little things seems bad execution mediocre concept   FOOD OK I burger mushroom s cheese  meat cooked really well  Many complaints medium rare vegas most places think rare  medium rare  its not  meat temp spot on  presentation definitely arty rustic but completely pointless  burger over 9 inches high disassemble even start eat it  mushroom solid portobello cap grilled  Tasted good but non functional because minute bit into whole cap  grilled all juices come once  messy addon burger when some assembly already required    With much work required deal food sure why put piece paper under your burger then serve your burger fork knife  you're totally going need use we're going work it  lot fries  didn't say when ordered needed too  two year old  Extreme overkill  mean heart attack overkill   My son tried chicken burger First its burger its chicken breast slider  Second massively over marinated meats aren't good idea children menu items  fact won't ever back kid because there's nothing there   SERVICE Good early sure rush hour service like    AMBIANCE good confused tend wonder why much spent dust collecting decor having hundred meat grinders sitting steel shelves just seems efficient  But didn't impact taste so    <EOR> Great burgers  classic steak sandwich incredible  great customer service  came often ask if everything ok  definitely would recommend place  <EOR> Husband disappointed  high prices lamb pork ribs chewy greasy charred ends  didn't taste  salmon good  came side potato tots which also good  friend didn't burger  didn't carry own drinks sauce bucket table  When paid front food left tip then carried own items table  confusing  seemed walk order high priced bus your own table type joint  <EOR> This place does even deserve business   employee Dillon kicked family because little girl autism standing booth socks singing    Extremely rude discriminatory      skip somewhere does discriminate   If could give LESS 1 star would  <EOR> I stopped other day whim  pleasant experience  originally ordered burger but suggestion staff changed 1 2 rack Baby Back ribs  delicious  IMHO ribs should just fall off rib when pick up  should still eat it    and eat did  wasn't much sauce ribs think just right amount  going back try other things  suggest give them try  <EOR> Outstanding baby back ribs cooked perfection  Gr8 burgers sliders   Veggie burger rocks   Fries cabbage salad tasty   Service fine   Nice ambiance spacious w people watching patio  <EOR> I atmosphere  Problem one menu behind when you're line register   ordered wagyu burger medium rare   came well done   ate because trying movie  flavor really good just way over cooked  GM offered buy next burger  Also really choppy service  Everything ordered came thing time  Still working kinks new location  <EOR> Stumbled upon little eat restaurant Town Center theatre   Wow!

<EOR> First off walking into restaurant uncomfortable because cluster people reading menu board right front cashier    We pretty optimistic being all ordered hamburgers French fries    guess all should expected   After ordering food waited probably 25 minutes before even saw waiter    when finally brought lunch only half there  When final burger made its grand appearance other half cut into completely raw center  medium said would but meat itself cold squishy touch if never seen any heat   We immediately flagged down waiter expressed discontent swept off promised another    Being new restaurant forgave mistake easily  BUT when replacement burger another ten minutes later arrived exactly same  Raw center  typically give every new restaurant second chance but won't happening     tell thing going simply made long amazing food across way Grape Street  <EOR> Friendly service  prices little steep get  ordered combo which 10 dollars beer price $18 92! Otherwise everything la carte sure pricier  why 3 stars  Otherwise burger fine but price expecting hand cut fries  store bought  hipster burger place little detail shouldn't overlooked  Plus weren't salted! <EOR> I really looking forward restaurant when found Australian restraint served lamb  Unfortunately just seemed fall short  ordered lamb ribs naked lamb burger because LOVE lamb  ribs came first lacked any discernible flavor  under seasoned swam oil  burger came send back  lettuce brown wilted  When burger came back few bites really disappointed  burger under seasoned too  burger supposed Mediterranean lamb burger but wasn't even hint Mediterranean  devastated  Under seasoned over cooked underwhelming  <EOR> I love Ribs  love Burgers  love BBQ  place peaked interest since saw Yelp event scheduled here  But friend Yelp suggesting Saturday afternoon off around 4pm   It's nicely decorated modern looking place  Lots meat grinders filling shelves  just couple but maybe 80 them  Don't ask why found fascinating  just did  also found fascinating fact sink located right middle restaurant    My friend decided ribs ordered Vegas Rib plate $18  Comes two meaty portions baby back ribs 3 Short Ribs    Baby Back Ribs very good firm yet tender way ribs supposed be  If think great ribs fall off bone then don't know good ribs  come seasoned sauce which mild hint pepper  Very tasty enjoyed them 4 5 5  Short Ribs also cooked perfection sweet sauce wasn't korean kalbi sauce wasn't teriyaki but new sauce palate  loved them! 5 5  Negatives      Cole Slaw    served thimble sized dish wasn't creamy vinegary anything  Lacked any imagination  both thought wasn't good   Table BBQ sauce     I poured some friend asked was  took taste didn't know  took another taste    still didn't know  He took taste said ketchup  disagreed because hint some kind extra flavor  waitress said BBQ sauce  I'd pass this   Overall pretty decent BBQ way better Rollin Smoke  Those guys should visit guys learn cook ribs  Portions great $18  Next time try burger looked pretty big delicious coming other patrons  <EOR> 1st time trying place  Long story short service food great!
