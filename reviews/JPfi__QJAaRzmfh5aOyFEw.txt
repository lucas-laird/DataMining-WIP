Maybe just little bit  problem actually fact brought luke warm  pretty sure know reason too  sure all meat toppings made already freshly made noodles cooked hot topped off cold meat toppings making luke warm which just terrible  would prob enjoy dish much more if hot   or if tell cold noodles but warm     The chicken chow mein  actually dish most  really flavorful said loved noodles despite complains  real issue horrible chicken  just tasted bad frozen but mainly bad   know never really happens where don't eat proteins but case because just awful  chow mein veggies good but chicken really made dish worse is  thinking much would love beef beef noodles chow mein even though weird mix but regardless 3 star    The service better usual ones because there's lot American speakers which good lot way  there's that  <EOR> My spot beef noodle  wife loves spicy wontons here  <EOR> Got Dan Dan Noodles beef pancakes  Best noodles Vegas  price really good too  Watching them noodles while you're waiting eat lot fun well  highly recommend it!! <EOR> Great service  However noodle good  find sweet more salt soup  ordered cucumber salad sliced beef pot stickers two noodles  avarage  arrived 11 00 five minutes later full  <EOR> Super friendly staff clean simple atmosphere  high expectations food based reviews which turned adequately but mostly bland uninspired lacked authenticity   Sufficient if need meal hurry  <EOR> I know great hand shaved noodle place fantastic all fronts!

<EOR> I won't change ratings because still think food great but recently came back waitress obviously wasted  She knocked over 2 glasses water some customers then proceeded spill glass another customer but gave anyway  Then messed every customers order took time too  saw least three groups customers walk because waited long  She also gave credit card bill back another customer which luckily both other paying attention back other customer right away  bad actually amusing watch   point updating help management out  manager came hour later tried help waitress yes she only one   But he should've done let home fire because she kept making situation worse  First impressions service super important can't afford lose customer over stumbling drunk waitress  already understaffed know but bad waitress worse mediocre food  Your food mediocre ditch bad waitress hire better people  Also three chefs back staring because she messed all orders  Some customer correct 3 times then finally just told chef order  Maybe don't need 3 chefs when waitress can't take orders? Seriously would've done better passing iPad around having customers order own food  Management message if need more ideas  want restaurant succeed because think guys great concept going on  <EOR> Fast friendly service  hand made hand cut noodles good  better two hand cut  hand cut better texture them  <EOR> Quality service price portion selection all great! restaurant small side but hour lunch rush  kitchen also designed watch them cook  Close enough strip still convenient too! <EOR> Excellent food prices!

Fresh cabbage onions large pieces chicken  Needed some acid balance added dipping sauce meant potstickers    1 order steamed beef dumplings good Din Tai Fung but also half price  Din Tai Fung uses thinner wrapper  More sophisticated complex  thicker more rustic    The pan fried dumplings cool crispy layer top almost cheese skirt but Asian   Definitely need soy dipping sauce cut grease   Beef pancakes good but again thicker skin while prefer thinner skin  Felt lot carbs    The table next order cucumbers  Would highly recommend would add crunchy something healthy break starch    Overall reasonable authentic tasty  Wouldn't recommend diabetic but great if carbs noodles! <EOR> Wow tried place today gem!

Whoops   Anyway found way plaza Flamingo near Decatur containing Shang Artisan Noodle plan B early Sunday night dinner  easy find because next Yonaka place  quite familiar me  walked inside glad see only couple other parties patrons there   I chose bar seating when server asked preference  took time look menu well friends' reviews  Sadly consensus favorite knife shaved noodles only hand pulled noodles plain noodles available   Of course settle hand pulled noodles point  Shang Beef Noodle Soup $8 95 came few short minutes  noodles indeed al dente tasted fresh but weren't utterly captivating  broth wasn't complex but  properly seasoned hence quite slurpable albeit shallower expected wooden spoon   beef just tender enough fairly tasty  bok choy cooked nicely brought juicy crunch slight bitterness  favorite bowl beef noodle soup around but pretty solid overall   My appetizer came later having taken roughly 10 minutes cook I'd forewarned  Beef Pancakes $5 49 Americans would call pancake but instead stuffed savory dumpling bun  They're pretty doughy flavorful juicy ground beef filling gushes liquid when cut into serrated knife  completely forgot dipping sauce during first bite sauce does help lend sweetness but isn't strictly necessary  didn't bother try tableside condiments soy sauce chili oil orders because didn't seem necessary   Luckily catch show toward end meal when chef made another batch hand pulled noodles  pretty fun see strands gradually take shape thin chef twists rolls dough  definitely best part sitting bar least your seat facing kitchen   I'll definitely come back Shang Artisan Noodle sink teeth into knife shaved noodles  Even without having tried those noodles I'd recommend restaurant good solo small group dining option fresh Chinese noodles those juicy beefy morsels appetizer menu  <EOR> Tip small place sit bar  You know place legit since noodles very uneven texture super chewy   Noodles made actual people machines   dried noodles rehydrated serve  freshly pulled noodles non chinese i guess  okay long good   <EOR> We really excited try place  love hand pulled noodles  eaten them Beijing several places  We're Korean Korea many Chinese living brought hand pulled noodles Korea Koreans love hand pulled noodles   food background shed light review   I think hit miss dishes  tried chicken mushroom  sauce good  noodles weren't chewy used to  didn't slick but chewy texture  would say probably flour issue    The staple hand pulled noodles Korea Jja zhang think called Peking Jja zhang I actually don't know spell English     Taiwan Dan Dan Peking well lots jja zhanng    but Peking all places served black bean sauce bowl small dollop  noodles slick oil but noodles sheen them  same true Korea  toothiness noodle  Shang sauce unfortunately super salty taste  send back didn't request replacement  told style Shang salty  If you've black bean noodles elsewhere really delicious flavorful  funky earthy taste soy black bean sauce  Anyway wouldn't order if back  think sauce China Ma Ma actually better   The pork cabbage dumpling very delicious  I'd definitely order that  beef onion pancake wasn't expected more dumpling pancake  used having pancakes where dough cooked layers there's beef within onions  over inch thick 2 inches round    definitely more fried bun  okay but good pork cabbage dumpling   The Shang fried rice good  Again little salty me  think maybe restaurant doesn't want deal folks asking soy sauce    but having lot salt really takes away flavor  Chinese food there's lot oil but also really salty meant probably won't back   I'm glad many great reviews  Maybe haven't tried enough dishes  think inexpensive    Five dishes $40  pretty cheap    It would great if tweaked some menu items  But hey great see Artisan Noodles Las Vegas   The service other hand great  two servers worked hard keep busy spot running  <EOR> I am big noodle fan!

Best service ever!  wouldn't write if wasn't true   very picky service   If service good establishment business most time dread return would return establishment business     1st day lot people waiting outside   Found two large parties   restaurant big   think fits 30 people   waited 20 minutes table    Both servers working night very nice courteous friendly   asked if needed anything several times even though very busy     2nd day greeted different server he also very nice courteous friendly   He provided excellent service us    He also asked several times if needed anything    3rd day greeted same server 1st time dined he again welcomed smile   definitely felt welcomed provided excellent service again   FOOD Shang Beef Noodles $9 75 Knife Cut Noodles 1st 2nd times 5 5   knife shaved noodles chewy plain noodle almost spaghetti type pasta good texture    soup lot beef flavor piping hot   beef tender flavorful   added extra noodles every time     I couldn't wait eat again 3rd time but 3rd time soup hot noodles soggy   very disappointed   felt nauseated afterwards because ate lukewarm   If food supposed hot temperature need piping hot   husband ok it  ___________________________________________ Chicken Chow Mein $8 75 2 5 The first bite ate good but then realized little saucy   think would've better if cooked little longer   needed high fire flavor too  hot sauce jar table lacked flavor     Just thought didn't fact workers kitchen wear gloves   There's sometimes more person touching noodles too   person would grab noodles hands place noodles into serving bowl    Thinking sanitary   It'll better if noodles cooked immediately put into serving bowl     Overall would definitely come back especially service   Next time would request food piping hot  <EOR> I dined last week upon recommendation friend   absolutely loved place!  space small very nice service helpful personable very friendly   food however outstanding!

At first going order hand cut noodle but opted hand pulled noodles since literally being made front eyes sat counter right front kitchen where noodles hand made noodles cooked plated   settled ordering Pork Belly HandNoodle ?????? while friend ordered Dan Dan Noodle ???     It didn't take long orders made  Dan Dan Noodle ??? came first followed shortly Pork Belly Handpulled Noodle   noodles easily main draw coming eat  Pork Belly Noodle served very good broth oily salty just well made broth 95% tender braised pork belly  No preserved cabbage served though which more Taiwanese style      The Dan Dan Noodle according friend Jason looks salty much Dan Dan Sauce which he confirmed right away   But he still liked freshly made noodles   The complimentary due checking Yelp Wonton Chili Oil ???? very impressive  wontons own above average which also made handmade wonton wrappers  But sauce underwhelming component failed dish   In spite disappointing Dan Dan Noodle failed to impressed Wontons Chili Oil still enjoyed food enough look forward coming back again  However next time give Hand Cut Noodles ??? expect every bit good Handpulled Noodles   4 stars  <EOR> My boyfriend visiting Vegas small trip weekend  sick buffets American food decided back Chinese roots look Chinese place!
