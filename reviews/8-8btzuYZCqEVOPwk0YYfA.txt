I think new place lot potential 5 Star but still needs little more experience! <EOR> So first tome eating family man Austin best never customer service work customer service industry but place hands down best yet!!!! <EOR> A lunch two cost $80 due cashier error  Called several times resolve only stonewalled denial  Going call corporate resolved  Shady business practices! <EOR> My husband wanted try place tonight    He really likes Korean BBQ am sure why would want restaurant cook your own food but whatever    tried Hawaiian Steak marinade delicious   course brisket galbi short ribs husband pork belly then kids full    Everything good but better   kids also macaroon icecream sandwich each   best part service all waiters very attentive changed grill two times   When ordered meat would come minute two   quick   Also water cups never empty Stanley Cup Playoffs showing all television screens  #GoKnightsGo! <EOR> I've location 3 4 times definitely recommend anyone  great place eat prices affordable  definitely your moneys worth   My most recent experience amazing only because server Jovanny outstanding! Although he 3 4 other large parties tend he always came table made sure everything  He's best server ever just place but general  He made feel welcomed always took care despite manager Linette didn't last visit good  would order drinks she wouldn't let serve drinks then proceeded tell specific drink ordered but then notified she lied no reason particular  when Jovanny served requested drink she proceeded lecture front even though Jovanny did nothing wrong but serve us  She merely upset fact she wrong lying but used title manager over him  If wasn't Jovanny's excellent service would've gave low rating but he made bad experience into great simply because service personality  If ever visit location recommend Jovanny your server  <EOR> Went Gen KBBQ house first time just few hours ago AMAZING  Great food  Great customer service  servers bussers top making sure okay refills didn't bother much most servers restaurants do!

Amazing! food quality fantastic  service fast you're practically eating soon sit down  Can't it  Highest recommendation! <EOR> Went soft opening! atmosphere great   love blue lighting   Since soft opening lot servers seem still training  order wrong twice always seem rushing frazzled   understand though new place sure they're still trying hang all  The food itself good  Some meat little dry but can't really wrong all eat $22  ? Heads though until further notice don't serve alcohol yet because don't license  bit let down lol  But resolved grand opening   back then  <EOR> This place ok  much appetizers choose banchan side dishes terrible  Next time  drive Henderson Korean BBQ food fix more options choose from  <EOR> very fast service cheap lunch! no dessert menu but macaroons sale front restaurant  <EOR> Love place  Same quality ones L A  best AYCE  bit much sauce spicey chicken octopus but other awesome  <EOR> Newish Korean BBQ joint trying very transient locations Sahara Decatur  Best thing place service    however food very good   horrible but just ok   The space big    lots cooktop tables   also means lots smoke grease air   owners need turn exhaust fans something   need better ventilation pronto  Plenty meats apps choose off menu but quality meat wasn't great   Everything sweet    much sauce marinade    really mediocre cuts    Not worst but many better choices Korean BBQ  <EOR> Came Tuesday evening parents off work late  heard location few months ago but some odd reason took them few months open  Maybe inspections renovations stuff? Dunoe !   Anyway located SW corner Sahara Decatur same center where Circuit City used ahh millennials know was    XD fyi definition millennials those born 2000   took over standalone building used some buffet never been    Renovations somewhat similar Henderson location but without high ceilings more seating or seemed     My parents already seated time arrived some food ordered  arrived started cooking sad face still cook working 11 hrs    zZzZz Customer service location pretty point for now      drink order almost soon sat down people asking if wanted order more stuff repeatedly pretty often    Menu wise seemed quite similar Henderson  only thing noticed change amount beef tongue each order gives premium steak sirloin steak  Iirc NY strip maybe even rib eye other location but havent months  much issue start cooking fat cap rendering down then cooking other sides    Aside beef tongue premium steak pork neck jowl whatever call it brisket spicy pork pork belly bulgolgi   repeat few  XD finally sliced pickled radish !   The weird thing noticed salad used spring salad instead usual romaine lettuce    The ventilation pretty bad  ones without hood above doesn't suck well     ha      seen same type ventilate very well point saw smoke curling but did affect all  feel bad whoever clean those glass walls daily    actually overheard someone telling another supposed turn down gas if smokes      most annoying thing kbbq's without ample ventilation  why can't upgrade ones korea where bring down while cooking? <EOR> This probably favorite Korean spot  Came celebrate coworkers birthdays  food great but service Boid even better he made experience top notch  <EOR> Definitely place Korean BBQ     Servers very prompt courteous  Even suggested best items menu      Thumbs Cajun shrimp jap Chae       All meats fresh good  twice looking forward next time      Keep good work great spot Korean BBQ! <EOR> This new favorite AYCE Korean BBQ  atmosphere upbeat clean modern  staff wonderful everyone attentive  selections plentiful great variety beef chicken pork seafood  stsrted cajun shrimp garlic calamari  then stuck most different pork belly items The spicy soft tofu soup flavorful almost another bowl  sure back  <EOR> I'll start good For most part Good service  fairly attentive  several instances remind them bring something asked for     They very generous portions keep bringing more more meat     I never before would good them tell place works    The vents above didn't seem work well  draft restaurant pushing smoke table next directly us    I wasn't impressed variety quality meat  marinades mild most meat fatty likings    Very limited non meat options   The KFC came ice cold  ask second order warm  room temp cold but refrigerator cold    The place poorly ventilated loud  music loud made difficult talk  Your clothes smell poorly ventilated restaurant    A lot people obviously love place  don't think me  <EOR> Two different perspectives     By Korean standards would've give food 2 5  While can't really wrong meat ok  then japchae soondubu side dishes    meh  mimicked real thing but tasted nothing really supposed to   By normal standards    3 5  portions pretty small  friends tried just everything beef chicken would say stick steak meats if you're looking real korean bbq but flavored meats weren't bad    service amazing though  loved attention servers cups rarely left empty long    I've gen California like  Which why think more disappointed  hoping new bbq spot friends but moving on     overall ok  back    maybe  <EOR> Great BBQ AYCE place take kids  weekend price all day $21 99 kids measured determine price  think over 50 full price? few times  last time Anthony waiter he very kind continually checked throughout  meats great Galbi spicy pork favorite  Food comes very quickly ask change grill plate few times  Sides pretty standard but limited comparison other AYCE places  aren't any extra appetizers available desserts included  main reason star loss  order macron ice cream sandwich $3 50 extra? place huge wait minimal which big bonus us! Customer service always point which big reason back few times  <EOR> This place amazing  Atmosphere truly 10 10 really appreciate food here  rarely find KBBQ place exceeds expectations but really found 30+ menu items pricing actually really great  Start off 3 items time usually something would but recommended waitress became routine throughout night  believe works best because service bit slow sure due busy place is  did however take asking 3 different times part meal  waiting 10 mins pair chopsticks replace dropped middle meal  Coming just mindful staff may attentive standard many restaurants due high occupancy restaurant certain hours   dinner mid week  <EOR> I tried place Vegas trip did disappoint all  meat high quality flavorful also salad really well dressed  Compared location near where live quality bit above service taste wise  However downside restaurant way smoky if ventilators working all  Overall enjoyable experience because extra hungry but hope could something smoky environment  <EOR> WELCOME GEN!  I just found place month ago already 5 times   It's phenomenal food SERVICE   There mere seconds between making order having food delivered your table   The amount options quality just mind blowing    Gen please never change  <EOR> Overall bad experience   First seating place inefficient  If come party six more people prepared wait 45 minutes  could totally avoided if sat smaller groups respective small booths but some reason don't that   frustrating see couple eating large seating section meant larger groups       No sense urgency   ironic restaurant time limit  takes long wait staff refill drinks take more orders bus tables generally speaking tend customers   write list down refill soda more X Y Z extra spoon etc because time between waiter checking rare occasion list things needed kept growing   Hiring few extra workers would place wonders  <EOR> Totally hip spacious busy   My first impression place its packed!

Hawaiian steak thicc juicy brisket dreams made of <EOR> To quite honest all am sure where begin review Gen Korean BBQ House much server no idea when begin refilling water cups  takes approximately 10 days without water average human die dehydration which clearly taken into account establishment all you can eat but not drink time limit set 2 hours  must commend them forward thinking  bad point myself 8 other patrons forced participate in house spelling bee contest order gain access coveted cup water  asked spell rondayvoo which apparently correct spell rondayvoo  surprise nobody thirst literary excellence quenched    There much more say but am writing review left withering energy  feel senses numbing  struggled decide whether contact loved ones last time warn all future customers Gen Korean BBQ House  decision obvious   I farewell thee hope equally brighter more hydrated future children  With tip glass and mandatory 18% gratuity readers review final sip all because all going get  <EOR> Just opened! Clean good customer service  food great consistent all other branches  When looking good korean bbq little more place go! just korean but bit everything! <EOR> Food excellent but way smokey needs way more ventilation here  Waiter tried charge full price 7 year old he never asked refill drinks! took 25 minutes find bill  Sticking Sura's DJK  <EOR> We always loved original Gen Henderson  But haven't awhile since way far us  happy find just opened second location West Las Vegas  But first huge disappointment terrible ventilation system  Unlike henderson location  really smoky  secondly maybe because its fairly new place service wasn't great waiter forgot bring few items first order ordered soju but he forgot bring shot glasses ?? then asked someone else shot glasses quite long wait then he brought tall beer glasses My favorite appetizers Henderson location wasn't menu anymore Crispy spicy Rice cake Fried Squid legs Very good quality beef tongue ok pork belly ok galbi very good K F C  Korean Fried Chicken   No doubt still decent dining spot price but sure if ever back again because bad ventilation system don't offer favorite appetizers anymore  <EOR> Nice atmosphere! Many items menu choose when all eat  Many employees take care you! visited thrice did any issue  <EOR> I'm NO longer fan gen!!  just opened 2nd location very spacious look same every Gen too   I stop going Henderson cuz #10 galbi label menu but galbi its chewy w tendon beef which claim galbi I know meat    When saw Yelp new location cuz just open excited try BUT disappointed  quality meat omg lack flavors chewy    love marinated meats all meat lack flavors    Appetizers very limited now before   planning coming again going stick new love  8ounce kbbq <EOR> Food bomb enjoyed atmosphere service also good  Even though ask salad 3 times    1 three bad    but other food fast ordered it <EOR> My fiance visiting Henderson Gen least once week every week since grand opening visit new location downtown show love support  Eugene wonderful manager Henderson no surprise he's doing fantastic job here! staff same bright friendly fun personalities made fall love Gen three years ago prepare yourself really great entertaining service!

Shout Mizzo thank fabulous service! <EOR> I mean   they're still only charging $22 dinner they'll seat fata$$ solo meaning seat parties one     My personal pro tip  If want side fried chicken japchae least three other people split with  say portions small but portions big ppl want use most stomach space grilled meats seafood    Another possibly obvious tip stagger your marinated unmarinated meat because only thing grease grill unmarinated meat  They're very liberal quick grill changes but if unmarinated then marinated won't ask much    I spice calamari recommend cajun calamari something different try probably won't find try other places  don't recommend if don't calamari  don't think it'll convert but If tasty    The quality meat good price  best among ayce places don't overdo marinade marinated meats    I mood soondubu  expert aficionado  just it  But while liked mine owner sure I'd recommend discerning newbies  tofu soup someone's thinking yeah tofu soup ayce kbbq place seems good idea tonight goodness  long sentence why am still talking myself? Lastly guess during grand opening  understand want lively atmosphere but don't need bass booming during meal  don't know does  Time eat let's turn music! said no ever want nurse headache meeeeaaal!!!

I probably coming back location instead back original Las Vegas Gen Galleria Mall  <EOR> GEN! loved going Gen when still SoCal  used unmarinated short ribs delicious  Then switched suppliers no longer carried unmarinated short ribs stopped going much  Then came Vegas but Henderson far  But pretty much cheapest AYCE BBQ Vegas $21 99 per person  now opened Decatur Sahara much closer maybe more often!  Came Thursday night dinner husband some friends friend told soft opening  establishment pretty big similar layouts Henderson location Cali locations  did notice some tables hood ventilation while other tables vent sides grill    We ordered bunch beef tongue beef belly  really delicious  Just sure overcook them meat tough  also pork belly brisket steak hawaiian steak bulgogi japchae some other things    Everything pretty good  Meat decent  japchae so so    better japchae other places  still nice though won't eating meat whole time  There's salad well  Unfortunately don't rice paper side dish yet since soft opening  Though honestly wouldn't count them having all time regardless soft opening grand opening cause Henderson location doesn't always it    Service pretty good  didn't limit much order which fantastic  used limit four few years back but now don't! meats delivered super fast but knows if that'll stay way    They actually supposed open earlier  working getting some disposable grill plates grills since really hard clean  figured may easier them just dispose used  However problem disposable grills causes lot smoke when use it  because couldn't pass health department it  end scrap idea along traditional grills    If Gen could adjustable hoods ones Korea ones Hobak Doh would much better  Even though establishment brand new ventilation horrible  Normally place takes while stink BBQ smell but walked smelling some grilled short ribs keep mind still soft opening! <EOR> Excellent customer service  Good food  Clean   Bathroom little creepy though atmosphere much dark blue lights   I love kkbq other appetizers such Korean Fried Chicken Japchae Cajun Chicken  price dinner $22 bad   The bannchan potato salad good! would back  <EOR> I really want rate them 3 5 stars but lack attention during last half hour dining experience made round down 3  Definitely 4 star book  first though service top notch  orders quickly drinks refilled promptly  restaurant busier waiter disappeared  ordered meats never them  Finally just gave asked check waiter delivering food another table  Now food The ban chan left much desired very small portions literally 2 tablespoons potato salad   Additionally taste ban chan meh  fish cake strips no flavor Kim Chee very mild pickled onions jalapeos no jalapeos    The meat Premium steak slab beef huge strip fat  Definitely wasn't ribeye but top sirloin believe  really didn't much flavor but cooked nice tender grill    Galbi short ribs weren't sweet used but still tasted great crisp grill  party 3 portion 2 short ribs which reordered 4 times but 3 actual orders    Beef belly another tasty meat ordered repeatedly due tiny portion size  might favorite meat meal  beef bacon thinly sliced fatty which meant cooked quickly    Beef tongue thinly sliced tongue very tender strong beefy flavor  very lean well sesame oil salt pepper combo    Red wine pork belly tasted nothing any pork belly ever had  more bland really tough piece pork  Even though only gave 2 pieces pork belly bacon size really hard 3 choke down  ashamed say hid portion under rice!   Spicy baby octopus portion nice 3 whole baby octopuses spicy red sauce tossed sliced white onions green onions  taste bold flavorful    KFC fried nuggets chicken smothered tasted ketchup based sweet sauce  cold time made table therefore less appealing    Overall food wasn't bad but when you're used eating other bbq joints amazing sides like Hwaro just leaves something desired    At end meal waited seemed eternity just check  number 1 pet peeve  Don't chase down pay you! <EOR> Really swanky Korean bbq smoke house NO ventilation ever  know korean BBQ spots smokey but location tops it  Came dinner Wednesday night moderately packed  restaurant huge lot seating  smoke builds restaurant horrendous  vent top did even seem work   front doors left wide open during dinner service some fresh air place   noticed host would outside several times gasp fresh air when she returned she squint  due heavy wall smoke  really hope fix ventilation   Overall good Korean bbq selection attentive quick service   Tips Hawaiian steak top favorites  2 hour time limit  Mango Ice cream macaroons finale  <EOR> Ok all eat diners  32 items menu off menu ordering fantastic! lunch everyrhing fresh server D personable helpful ordering  Manager Danny knows stuff aand cares thw dining experience  fun experience <EOR> Best service great BBQ!
