I'm big fan Subway   Unless February Febru Any specials   say though funny most people post negative experiences   normal tend remember negative experiences more good service always expected      say though your average run mill sub shop nothing stand say man love place! But having said dozens times never negative experience unless count them mixing onions lettuce knows many time lol but  no biggie       3 5 cause  George W Bush    know average    okay he C average but know dang well he bought that    beyond point though lol <EOR> If way could put zero stars would  WORST experience subway  group 5 people way event  When first walked lady walked said she going break lady would right serve us  stood waited 2 3 mins till say hello  employee named Terry walked beginning very rude  tell she did want sandwhiches  Terry lady rude changing meats sandwhiches when subway plenty subways others did it  She also messed sandwhiches  requested ranch she squirted down mayo  told mayo she ignored us  tell 3 4 times till she finally looked reliezed  never step foot into subway ever again if dont let Terry serve you!!!! Totally killed subway vibe <EOR> Great location  Seems clean inside but employees quite senseless  Half them look just done smoking joint taking nap   Careless decent sandwich which every time come in  say today last visit  sandwich joke falling apart  I'd rather take 10 min drive port subs <EOR> I Subway    Due line used restroom before ordering  Restrooms keys dangling locks like gas station where key sure why even bother having key  Came restroom zero people line waited 5 minutes even acknowledged no around  When he actually surfaced kid acted he something  coupon  50 cents off 6 inch  always veggie extra cheese 6 inch extra cheese that most certainly charge extra cheese should 4 slices  He put 3 whatever  Seeing ENTIRE SANDWICH veggies when started telling veggies want he barely put any  keep asking more but when said wanted onions he literally took large handful slapped there  bread stale gross  know he didn't apply coupon refused give receipt  Seriously?? Literally only reason still deal Subway close house   now won't lazy actually trip elsewhere  <EOR> After running some errands area 10 minutes grab lunch back work  Subway convenient swing into stopped sandwich go    There customer ahead getting toasted sandwich  did want sandwich toasted rather then making wait first customers order complete some places sometimes finished sandwich first which appreciated    Overall nothing special place but nothing bad either  Just your standard Subway sandwich buying experience  would probably stop back if area wanted sandwich lunch  <EOR> It great when first walked no line 2 people helping me  perfect! Because ordered 2 foot longs quick fast   Another customer came behind seemed even faster impressed  I very nice sweet them but some reason lady took care end order nasty attitude   I asked if she cut subs four didn't hear reply confirm nor did see she cut subs because she quick asked again if she cut them four she totally snapped said DID if annoying customer  AWE   First all no line   Second only 1 customer besides myself  Third nothing but nice them having awesome day UNTIL she snapped  I no longer bring business subway due particular expirence First now Last  <EOR> After doing orientation new job khols grabbed bite eat subway!!!! sandwich delicious workers nice!! Shout Tracie being super sweet!!! Love subway life! <EOR> Very bad service never return  employees need realize owing costumer reason job <EOR> Slowest worst Subway experience ever  workers weren't even trying hustle even when line 10+ people long point just kept moving slow snails  rude kept acting annoying them when asked little more lettuce  While standing line girls rudely said call ahead if want more 5 sandwiches   all paying separately weren't together? girls' names Dianne Shayanne sp?   Absolutely ridiculous  Never coming back  <EOR>
