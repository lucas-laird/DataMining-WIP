So basically high marks based salsa food overall reasonable prices since service could've better considering just few other parties besides us  He checked once during whole meal  might check again if certificate  <EOR> SPECIAL 3 item combos $8 99 + $3 Margaritas!! plus Chips salsa plus bean dip FREE At all @stationcasinos  We visited Palace Station around 10pm Friday Evening no wait seated during #UNLVmbb game    Service fast friendly bringing drinks chips salsa almost immediately  ordered regular carne asada fajitas wife 3 item combo beef enchilada beef taco something mexican   As see whats pictured think when think fajitas right? thinking slightly sauteed peppers onions medium rare finely sliced carne asada tortillas pico sour cream guac side maybe even some cilantro HOT sauce   Really cheap cheesy  meat tough marinated you'd expect  Didn't even touch rice beans just didn't pass look test    sidenote sides pico sour cream guac same small bowl watered together not very cool either   How place failed find someone cook good mexican food Las #Vegas boggles mind  <EOR> I didn't really expect eat good Mexican Food sketchy hotel off strip Vegas  assumptions wrong   food average   Nothing celebrate recommend but decent meal hotel where other option buffet Jonny Rockets go   The staff extremely slow didn't think next step any time   constantly asking water chips them take order   don't enjoy restuarants where more work them job    Granted place nice escape outside environment gross off strip hotel  But please don't expect much <EOR> The service friendly but food no bueno  Fajitas lime shrimp should hard but both little flavor  shrimp huge but just lacked any oomph excitement  salsas better 4 different kinds! <EOR> I must admit excited all eat tacos special $7 99  However review mostly service which eclipsed food tenfold    Admittedly little bit late hour before close but does mean we're entitled good service? server Jim seemed think so    Jim stumbled table conspicuously inebriated probably more 3 sheets wind I think he probably whole linen closet blowing boozy breeze    However Cadillac  margaritas ordered WEAK! Perhaps because Jim sucked all alcohol off top before he served them us  When personally brought them back bartender redo Jim nowhere found bartender really no interest doing anything other cleaning bar he could home   We spoke manager honoring AYCE deal listed Yelp however he said promotion expired only I T  guy responsible internet promotions  guess can't expect much MANGER anything right? man built Sprinter Van if Jim drinking all restaurant's profits manager obviously offered paycheck form burritos tacos enchiladas   which he GLADLY accepted  He still refused honor Yelp deal opted fajitas two special going time    Here's good news  Jim left before he done serving we saw later pub getting cozy cold bar Lucy took over  She amazing attentive but sadly end meal didn't experience extent awesomeness  Another busser named also seemed genuinely happy doing job too! He also quite helpful   The food mediocre but love bring tasty bean dip table  probably come back another Stations Casinos Cabos but definitely Palace Station     I more fun karaoke  Jack's Irish pub night  Singing Tina Turner songs made feel better! <EOR> Service awesome  Complimentary chips salsa beans good filling  Margaritas could've bigger   stronger but good none less  Keep your eye coupons    groupons!! <EOR> Came last week  always food amazing! first time service really bad  can't remember servers name but seen previous visits  We sat hostess guy not server brought chips n salsa  Waitress finally came took drink order  asked two ice waters  bottom chips still no water  seen manager blonde walking around greeting guests  asked waters  She aplogised said she would right over waters  Never happened  Finally waitress came over oh forgot your drinks did order? finally water 20 mins  Then she came back took order  When food different waiter brought food great!! Then didn't see waitress another period time  When finally did see again she hanging manager chatting  ask check  twice ask something  back love food hoping time thing bad service  But if first experience restaurant probably wouldn't back   *Picture waitress manager hanging waited waitress come by  <EOR> We just checked into Palace Station kind late didn't really want back dinner   looked offered Casino   Cabo special create your own combo meal $8 99   looked pretty good thought would give try  First thing bring complimentary Warm Chips then some warm refried bean dip 3 freshly made salsas   spicey roasted tomatoe regular tomatoe green tomatillo   refried bean dip warm tasty other 3 seemed made very fresh   favorite Roasted which MEDIUM HEAT  I asked Chili Relleno waitress said made fresh roasted chili then stuffed cheese rolled flour then fried   also ordered steak carbaron sp? taco which street style taco small corn tortilla fresh onion cilantro   combo also came Rice Beans  My wife Chili relleno pork tomale   Lets just say based Chips Salsa very good rest food even better   Any ventures try Chili relleno knows met mixed results   time swear Egg Omlet Diced Green Chili's   VERY VERY good great taste   Everything great taste even black beans rice   My expectations very high looked YELP reviews prior going sure would GONE but Oh glad did  If neighborhood staying Palace station would highly recomend Cabo!  Muy Bien!!!! <EOR> I here    THats all say  MEDIOCRE <EOR> Strolled 9pm session bingo  Boarding pass earlier day utilized fajita dinner 8 99    Only 3 dollars cheaper cars but oh well  buy drink deal  Margaritas below average   Small glass   Tons ice   strong all    asked salt glass sugar  She wanted sugar salt   Wouldn't big deal if gotten same flavor   Food food tho    Bean dip comes chips salsa complimentary   wanna try all eat tacos <EOR> Margaritas pretty good but don't bother food  Food pretty plain nothing really write about  ordered steak nachos crispy tacos  Glad didn't actually pay Meal drinks comped ! Probably wouldn't come back  Robertos house much better P <EOR> 6pm Friday only five tables occupied  Nasty hostess painted on eyebrows tells can't seat because only three servers  apparently servers can't serve two tables each? No wonder place always empty!!! turn customers away 75% empty restaurant Friday night! <EOR> Decent alternative all those expensive ACYE buffets     My friends tried all eat tacos only $7 99   your choice ground beef shredded beef shredded chicken   your first plate 3 tacos side rice choice black beans re fried beans  There's also lettuce tomato cheese side your taco however like  ordered shredded beef surprisingly good pretty juicy     The meat pilled high three tacos pretty filling  But if  enough feel free order more tacos since ALL EAT   tacos come two time rice beans given upon request    Chips also served along bean dip 2 different types salsa   Cabo Mexican Restaurant solid deal! <EOR> All taco's  sounds good  except first two never second order  so paying two drinks playing $20 worth video poker ended paying almost $12 per taco which nothing write home about  of course complained security arrived take report   WTF? much complaining receipt presentation managed meal comped  which would only reason would ever set foot back into place  <EOR>
