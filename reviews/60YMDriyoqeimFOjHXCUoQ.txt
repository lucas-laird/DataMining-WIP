Open serves food alcohol 24 hours day top live gaming if want test your luck drink free!  2 3 TV's each side bar usually ESPN whatever game's jukebox corner if want play DJ  If hear Free Bird  Hotel California back back look me! If late night expect some locals on break off cab limo drivers some neighboring Palms employees coming enjoy some cold ones   bartenders always laidback never any issues here   I would highly recommend nachos hangover skillet if looking grub!  Enjoy least once week! <EOR> Great place eat budget! recommend Double Duces!
