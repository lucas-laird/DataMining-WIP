As native Japan looking forward visiting new Udon restaurant  Overall they're serving pretty authentic Sanuki Udon however first impression soup cowardly  It should served very hot even soup stock could much lighter brown using more Dashi mirin   That's authentic Sanuki Udon Soup used Western Japan should be   Also thought Cashier key entire operation  Although all order serviced each kitchen section within minutes wait check out 5 mins  It doesn't sense Udon restaurant customer wait long  We customers want enjoy freshly made noodles soup right away   I'd visit again see operation made progress  When visited kitchen staff still training looked only manager knows each section runs kitchen  Obviously all cooks need more time cross training order them flexibly workable any sections   Especially Tempura deep fryer should kept clean  I'm sure easy maintain deep fryer equipment using lots flour oil   However if restaurant firmly wants keep open kitchen concept each cook should stay top cleanness maintaining equipments  I saw there're lots rooms grow business town   Therefore appreciate owner bringing beautiful Udon culture town    1  ?????????? 2  ??????????????????????????????????5?? 3  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? <EOR> Good pricing food tasted great! lemonade probably best ones ever tried  bottomless calpico drink!!! staff super friendly  Looks coming back becoming regular udon craving! <EOR> Good food big portion cafeteria style  really food there  Staffs very nice <EOR> It's good  Katsu Curry rice bowl expecting Chicken Katsu but think pork  fault should asked kind Katsu  curry really good!

Its hard sometimes explaining exactly exceptional service exceptional bit intangible know? waiters everything right still subpar because clearly going through motions think service step above because WARM  staff actually care being nice very genuine  guess could talk thoughtfulness attention detail but ultimately comes down actually caring which do    We definitely come back probably would even come back if less impressed food  Management if read Jasmine manager give store whatever  train people really well but can't train authenticity person don't  Your staff happier Jasmine waiters many 5 Star restaurants  <EOR> My boyfriend hooked! udon wonderful usually stay away thick noodles  atmosphere amazing well interior design restaurant blew away!

Overall would definitely back  But if stop overcooking udon give steaming piping hot broth then they'd perfect almost all around  <EOR> Eating great experience  local hometown eatery feel polished dining vibe  noodles made fresh every 30 minutes food fresh no walk freezers  The house lemonade best ever had  service good  owner Henry dope AF!

Just bring your appetite  place casual comfortable friendly  cafeteria style just grab tray place your order  food freshly made right your order placed quick if aren't calling your name when paying staff quick being your table s   Fresh noodles full flavor  Don't forget pick tempura stick two  awesome bowl udon clams  full only $8 00!
