The restaurant itself pretty large modern ish decor comparison other Thai restaurants  strings Christmas lights artsy fashion  ain't Christmas but tis season works overall feel restaurant  boyfriend walked into empty restaurant exception party 6 finishing meal Saturday night  greeted waitresses seated table    We ordered Thai tea beef pad see ew chicken ginger mushroom  thai tea kind rubbed wrong way  tasted super powdery but most likely because didn't mix well enough  waited while before dishes brought us  We're very patient people but wonder when food table tell tale sign they're taking way long  Annoying since essentially only ones restaurant  But gave them benefit doubt figured making food ultra fresh   What didn't realize when ordering portions at least dinner huge! two dishes pretty good  best ever but no major complaints  chicken ginger mushroom quite misleading name  dish didn't extra bite ginger searching for  Where mushrooms? hiding didn't want come out  lot other veggies though carrots onions bell peppers  Good portion chicken which appreciated  beef pad see ew good amount beef well  definitely don't shy away your protein portions! Basil 'n Lime serves pad see ew regular broccoli  Perhaps consumer's preference but definitely pad see ew Chinese broccoli regular American broccoli  feel though Chinese broccoli gives ample amount crunch chewy dish such pad see ew really needs  Both dishes heat level 5 10  tell heat level 5 barely scratched capsaicin receptors tongue! If medium spicy should probably bump notch 6 maybe 7 if feeling little brave    I'm sure if back dinner anytime soon  But hear great lunch specials  more open take stab those if given time opportunity  <EOR> The place best food part town  green chicken curry world when comes exciting taste buds  only gave place 2 stars because if your food delivered company charge 2 delivery fees!!!
