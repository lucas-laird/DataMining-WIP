More often find myself spending night friends Fado  almost become Cheers everybody knows your name  very relaxed environment great catching friends  However Fridays any night live band recommend snagging table outside patio because WAY loud inside really enjoy yourself  recently installed small bar patio cash only but feel rarely staffed   The staff incredibly friendly personable but because sometimes busy tough them quickly  If you're looking fight through sea people pint would recommend going any drinking holiday when big soccer game on  PACKED! But if fan soccer great place catch game  Several large flat screens mounted throughout restaurant electrifying atmosphere screaming spectators standing seats crying GOAAAL! even most lukewarm sports fan pumped  Also try stopping Friday between 4pm 7pm  bottomless glass wine $10  There's only 4 kinds available but its still amazing deal seeing single pint $6 7  And Thursdays Bottomless Stella $10 4pm 7pm ! P S  Try Cheese Dip Wedges  MMMMM <EOR> Wed Night Pub Quiz!!  much fun food very good too  <EOR> Add half star rating  It's bad   decor very Irish pub but new feel truly authentic   something management change unless want close place down smoky peat bonfire inside month then bring every chain smoker Las Vegas additional month send help around ding edges rub things century old grime generally batter place up   Yeah know all pubs battered but distinct feel age wear even cleanest them   service okay  the waitress few many tables handle well  fault   food decent well  I bangers mash   Unfortunately wasn't authentic would liked   bangers dead on  with thin crisp skins nice fatty pork inside   mash made real potatoes instant potatoes but cabbage some bright green stuff or parsley?    gravy very red wine flavor  lovely but traditional   peas?  frozen green things proper marrowfat peas   sort interpretation should appeal Americans haven't gone English schools UK   complaint simply  wanted Bisto gravy marrowfat peas overcooked green cabbage instead more upscale treatment  <EOR> OMG! St  Patrick's day!  run into few interesting Ol'guys here   beer excellent whiskey shots put good frame mind! LOL <EOR> If place bar itself street somewhere I'd probably considering 4 stars   Unfortunately many things Las Vegas tucked away corner obscenely large casino   casino question WAY off strip   pub second third floor way off corner     search place felt episode  Lord Rings Following signs backtracking splitting meeting again etc   great advantage over hobbits cell phones keep touch   Furthermore could stop rest along way booze food course craps   Those poor little hobbits     Our 8 person party escorted table through labyrinth small rooms anterooms seated dinner   drank fish ate lots fish chips enjoyed band   most part great bar band kind often see Vegas if you're just walking around   little jarring leave nice dark wood dim lighting pub into casino find restroom but all survived    Unless you're already Green Valley some reason can't imagine any great reason hit place   However if already building decent place drink   also show lots Rugby Premier League other European International sporting events usual early morning time if you're inclined  <EOR> I believe all reviews nobody commented HIGH quality Guinness here!?!? quality control system elaborate describe but purely beer  rest bar bad lot wood decor sometimes loud band playing good cover songs  whole reason however Guinness  wasn't fan kind beer past honest its big let down when elsewhere point  <EOR> I'll completely honest  hot whiskey   girl loves hot beverages bad all   fact down right tasty cool night   Last time ordered food boxty stuffed corned beef cabbage   okay   Something would back for?
