Don't expect see waiter least 20 minutes being seated don't expect refill your beverage  No matter busy no moves faster snails pace  <EOR> The food good  restaurant poorly managed  takes former server when come they're doing favor    Problem hotel Westgate Las Vegas no longer restaurants open late except coffee shop sells cold sandwiches  Also room service closes 10pm  if want order pizza you're screwed  hotel doesn't allow pizza deliveries site because Pizza Hut express also closes 10pm    If come Sids expect good food just very long wait times  servers kind enough give 20 minutes uninterrupted before coming ask order  Lol <EOR> Yelp 2017 100 Challenge 2017 Review 44 100  Sid's cafe various restaurants Las Vegas Westgate hotel  When compared other restaurants which provides foods cost average $30+ Sid's Cafe little more affordable ranging $15 30     I ordered Hawaiian chicken sandwich $15 which tasted good but would rate dish maybe $10 12  However Vegas prices high    The reason three stars waiter did give refill drink options menu slightly limited opinion  <EOR> Let start saying only reason review getting 2 stars because very few things did right explain further review    I am vegetarian husband eating usually compromise sometimes such necessity  arrived first since he finishing checking hotel  seated told server would bring silverware drinks shortly  While sitting noticed curled long onion sitting knows long salt pepper shakers  few minutes later lady comes does take drink order  No smile no hello no welcome nothing    just drink? doing dis service being there!  I reviewed menu over over ONLY vegetarian item entire menu including appetizers salads soups veggie burger zucchini  squash topping some mayo  didn't want any squash burger don't eat mayo going work me  Usually other burger options just replace veggie burgers but case because all meat factors couldn't removed  asked waitress if could see kids menu  explained vegetarian only option veggie burger  She gave dirty look shook head then proceeded tell no vegetarian options kids menu! know experience chef  impossible pressed further  Finally she host stand fumbled around found one  know three options appear!! When husband arrived ready place order now new waiter  decided going order grilled cheese off kids menu just add tomatoe  $6 99 dish keep mind   He tells he's going charge adult portion because want add tomatoes he just say no ham   asked item he referring to? He said ham cheese     Now keep mind pay  $ 39lb  tomatoes $5 00 lb sliced ham he wants charge $16 00 grilled cheese? He fought issue few minutes then acted he doing favor allowing original price   Charge buck two more ordering off kids menu don't care charge tomato but blatantly try bate switch over charge your tip higher   no way!!!  Now food   my husband ordered French Dip  He said good  He would eat again but nothing great  Portion size larger expected  My grilled Cheese greasy dripping while ate    No wasn't tomato juice   it actual oil!! Also cheese used American would preferred Cheddar but fault asking   The highlights dining experience French fries!!! Hands down tasted just Arbys fries! If Jamocha shake would set rating would much higher! Yet serious note place needs menu adjustment vegetians fastest growing dietary choice heavy duuty training staff enthusiasm customer interaction service! <EOR> We directed restaurant when asked place appetizers cocktails casino staff member  cocktails came appetizers barely edible  Waiter nice but everything else  disappointment  Exceeding limited menu  No real drinks  Avoid all costs  <EOR> Shrimp scampi really really heavy cream no basil flavoring speak of  eating stick butter $26  gross  <EOR> Been few times eat free cause always send coupons  Poor folk need apply cause iced tea trip ya $4    breakfast lunch dinner   if yo trying impress yo bottom bitch throw some dubs piece roll into Sid's  <EOR> I think place really improved over two years ago   favorite dishes most recent visit and craving ever since Roasted Turkey Gravy meal   large slices roasted turkey over bread covered gravy side mashed potatoes broccolini   broccolini little bitter but couldn't enough turkey potatoes gravy gravy soaked bread   crazy good it'll first meal when return!
