When she brought she did say wasn't cold yet since just making it  We just happy it! Yes service bit slow only because staff engrossed TV back   But hard attention more ice cold bori cha when necessary   waitress even chatted awhile which nice personal touch     We'll probably going back again   Total $50 including tip tax   Lunch specials 11 am 3 pm  <EOR>
