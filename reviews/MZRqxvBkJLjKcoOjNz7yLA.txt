Only thing didn't care habanero salsa no flavor but definitely hot  <EOR> If could give place zero stars would  walked outside bar friend greet bartender Kush since he clearly no interest assisting us  When asked happy hour drinks he extremely standoffish  Once received margaritas bill came $16 2 2 1 but margaritas watered down definitely worth money  sitting 30 minutes noticing friendly Kush other patrons only common denominator African American everyone else he greeted checked White  He didn't even look time! Sitting two empty cups bar being asked need anything else anything all something place  Definitely bring your money elsewhere  <EOR> Ok food great really but atmosphere really fun drinks great! People dancing including staff   music great beat  staff seemed enjoy job laughing talking everyone whether customer not  very fun comfortable  food came very timely despite all activity neglected all waiter very busy other customers entertaining bar    I would totally recommend place fun couple shots snacks  <EOR> Came today holiday weekend bartenders amazing  absolutely love atmosphere enviornment  Both bartenders treated great hospitality very humble  must Vegas trip!!!

Veggie bowl flavorless boiled vegetables thrown bowl WHITE rice  Where Mexican rice? Nasty! Mango margaritas supposedly shot them but weak gross  manager said she would discount tab but she really didn't!

E Gads!! The Worst Worst dining Las Vegas  I could terrible food        PLEASE RECONSIDER your dining choice    We foolishly didn't read reviews prior choosing establishment   Décor looks cheap dirty  $16 crap chicken burrito  Waitress attentive But Cook pokey getting things prepared timely manner  We disappointed everything except Diet Pepsi  The Place Being empty during lunch hour should Bright Red Warning Light  <EOR> The food pretty good but service only okay  2pm pretty busy but only server on  poor woman trying serve 9 10 tables herself which wasn't fault but made things move slow  ask chips salsa multiple times getting drink refills whole process  think would better experience if more people working but slow only okay us  <EOR> If looking ugly people disgusting food cheap alcohol your spot  <EOR> We best experience ever!! left Mesa come over because heard much better!! Roberto amazing server happy he take care us! Juan best guacamole maker well!! <EOR> If weren't staying Flamingo don't think would gone place   Nothing good nothing bad but chain could plopped into Minneapolis South Dakota   Typical Mexican chain everything corporate taste   suppose most showboating bartenders but just anything memorable meal  <EOR> This place indoor door patio option  choose sit outside enjoy weather  some coverings sun wasnt blazing right you  pretty decent size bar outside well seats looked various sexy legs  thought fun cool picture opportunity  breakfast time when service fast plenty open tables  place connected Flamingo hotel reference   For food breakfast burrito potatoes  average breakfast food  also five dollar Bloody Mary's Mimosas  tried blood mary  Nothing fancy served plastic cup but bad again average  I'd say worth try if your staying flamingo close but nothing your way for  <EOR> 3 stars food good enough   1 star underhanded pricing schemes crappy overpriced margarita's   Beware everything extra charge cheese guacamole chips salsa   inform extra charges front but offer them if free    surprise comes when bill    I think trying another Senior Frogs loud music servers break into line dances occasionally   Avoid place lame  <EOR> The staff great but food mediocre save ceviche  talk second  So  order margarita rocks  Mexican restaurant  STRIP  Yeah comes looking Mt  Dew tasting sadness  also margarita slurpee machines I'd probably better off going way    The food your generic churned Mexican  Think    well Mexican dishes places Chili's    They two stars because ceviche fantastic  couldn't believe came same place! someone made ceviche fine dining restaurant know ceviche spectacular  Lots avocado which great  Even husband isn't really foodie commented ceviche looked strikingly different all other dishes   Bottom line order ceviche stick Dos Equis  <EOR> To honest I'v only long day of  uhm    having good time Las Vegas  so review may accurate  service does seem bit slow other no issues place  outdoor patio quite nice night  Looking other reviews don't come sober    good time  mean     some people don't seem place very much  <EOR> Not bad cheap restaurant inside casino!  Beans seemed canned     but acceptable   Waitress delight!  Drinks took while come by    may may return  <EOR> I don't think ever seen many bad reviews! can't say disagree but experience little better then 1 Star   My girlfriend stopped late first night Vegas  started Margarita's order Guacamole  Margarita's OK but Guacamole best thing all night  made fresh order right front us  Our entree's below average even chain Mexican place  According menu Cheese Burrito supposed filled Cheddar Jack Cheese veggies  Tortilla filled onions green pepper's barely any cheese all   girlfriend ordered Chicken Enchiladas Red Salsa  She summed Meh place perfectly tasting Burrito  She said both dishes tasted came same pot   Pretty sad when consider different entree's should been     Our service OK but confusing  Server's seemed switch third way through meal then first Server reappeared when check came out  wheelchair accessible but can't see ever coming back unless sit bar couple drinks order some Guacamole  <EOR> Roxi wonderful  She helpful efficient personable  food good ok priced though little smaller portion size  main reason only 3 stars staffing issue  only server whole inside restaurant just enough help  made service seem slow fault server  <EOR> If could give half star would  Just left place because chips tasted old cold  salsa jar  ordered two margaritas sent back because tasted horrible  wait staff slow rude unfriendly  coming back again  <EOR> HORRIBLE SERVICE! If really into happened would writing hours pretty much understaffed manager brought free chips salsa everyone asked no onions tacos took 30 min new tacos might mention wrong tacos when brought them  friends food cold oh comped food cause felt bad     ridiculous  never going back <EOR> Environment fun enjoyed outdoor seating  lunch  quite pricey weekday lunch  understand Vegas but should still lunch option  Prices seemed high quality food  reminded Don Pablo's Chi Chi's but those restaurants prices closer quality food  Kind disappointed selection well  Most appetizers same price entrees  <EOR> Worst food ever tasted  ordered appetizer sampler could try several different items  Some food hot but mostly lukewarm  wings looked tasted terrible  rest just so so  Definitely place visit again <EOR> Best tacos ever definitely recommend place staff very nice friendly food very very good great experience definitely coming back  <EOR> Carlos 'n Charlie's located inside Flamingo Hotel Casino  your Americanized Mexican food establishment  food isn't authentic Mexican food all but taste isn't horrible  why 2 stars? portions small price high service isn't best    At first waiter pretty chill but taking order didn't see much after  guess only good thing he gave margarita free since he made mistake    Food I ordered chicken enchiladas rice  Everything seasoned pretty well but wish more kick it  Also honestly could probably ate 2 3 plates since portion really wasn't large     Overall glad tried Carlos 'n Charlie's time but most likely won't back  I'd rather spend $20+ meal actually fill up  <EOR> Carne Quesadilla great  Carne nacho huge good  Fajitas good sizzling most but still good  come take your photo sell them you  loved bought one  Overall completely satisfied  Prices high but everything strip  would back  <EOR> I really say don't here  couple party stopped buy 1 1 happy hour drinks then decided hang food  server nice but completely overwhelmed  took 20 minutes between when able place drink order then food order because he nowhere found  Once ordered food took almost 45 minutes arrive which tells kitchen slammed well  Twice someone attempt deliver incorrect order table which ended being tables around us   The food just ok shrimp quesadilla little undercooked cheese completely melted very overpriced $16  habanero sauce legit though super hot! nice  big mama drinks much more pint tested refilling water glass  mostly just thick plastic  Once done eating took forever check another forever them process payment  Luckily good company but I'd definitely come back choice  <EOR> Our experience Carlos' N Charlie's great!
