BTW waiter told tomatoes canned when asked strange taste didn't up! <EOR> I liked it   LOT   We seated patio area   salad amazing   server super helpful   The pasta great!  ravioli   Minus 1 pizza   good   Service excellent  <EOR> Three four felt little sick eating tummy aches all which sucked cuz cut into vegas nightlife = rigatoni pasta two other friends sick linguine alla norma? food tasted fine wasn't spectacular but good  Theirs' strange combination taste but wasn't all bad either  But tummy aches killed any good felt towards place later night which already wasn't much because service sucked  two waiters charge area think which cheery old man very friendly nice other which snotty ill tempered  could tell he didn't want all  He frowning entire time mocked some questions beverages   The other waiter tried situation better think but wasn't easy   I don't think I'd back next time vegas  <EOR> When think Mario Batali  what comes mind?  Fat italian dude reputation cranking some best looking tasting dishes    right?  Wrong! place horrible   ate Friday afternoon hardly any customers   still took over hour pasta out   sauce decent but handmade pasta disappointment   There's reason why place empty while neighboring restaurants long lines  <EOR> We visited Enoteca San Marco again weekend enjoyed another 3 hour foodie feast!  started glass Prosecco proscuitto di parma lonza 3 cheeses accompanied apricots honey truffles liquid cherry gold   Love blue cheese swirled brandied cherry juice party your mouth!  noticed another review unhappy cheese did include crackers bread she ask 1 2way through   bad confusion cheese plate does come crackers bread although waiter happily provide some if asked   cheese paired three different sweet flavors cherries very expensive provide per person along some awesome cherry juice   Amazing flavor!  For next course tried Bavette Cartierra if simple foods made freshest ingredients locavore style then you   Fresh cherry tomatoes Molto Mario's Farmer's Market cooked until pop   juice fresh tomatoes sauce pasta dish along thin slices garlic   pasta cooked perfectly al dente   I should mention Luke made phenomenal wine suggestion 2003 Nino Negri sfursat   dying try grape made amarone but nebbiolo grape instead   Enjoying good wine most favorite things those eyes closed savor moments kind wine   Thanks Luke!  The wine paired beautifully braised pork shoulder apple reduction served cucumbers   Cucumbers?!?!  would've thought but really nice accompaniment!  We finished two digestiv perfect then olive oil gelato   Mmmmm      There few reviews disappointed wasn't fancier restaurant   enoteca casual place just is   seating inside but patio seating fun great people watching   If you're looking good quality fresh ingredients then try it!  place heaven fork! <EOR> this place below expectation  ate across wolfgang puck's day before food delicious  friends amazing pastas decided try mario batali's restaurant next day  pasta disappointing  under cooked think waiter said ask al dente wonder if heard right  anyways just good freshly made pasta wolfgang puck's  ordered two pasta both under cooked  other friends ordered dessert coffee nothing spectacular which disappointed when restaurant named iron chef  <EOR> This disappointment! wife looking good Italian meal but very let down decision  wife pasta greasy no flavor all  pizza bad but much flavor either   The wine cheese list pretty good but felt pushed hard sell meal  decided order two tap waters service downhill there  seemed more annoyance wait staff then customer  Save your money lots options Las Vegas  <EOR> Service t bar lame  Service dining room pleasant  Menu nice food so so  <EOR> Had quick dinner here  Bread came wrapped paper which kind weird  shape reminded taco shells first  breadstick came plastic wrapped thing reminiscent those wet paper towels restaurants when order lobster crab   Gemelli house sausage broccoli rabe $18 salty pretty good  Cavatappi lamb ragu mint tomato $21 little salty lamb good dish overall little oily    The pasta portions pretty big  didn't order any pizza but pizza next table looked pretty large too  Service fast friendly  Definitely worth checking least once if you're Venetian Palazzo  <EOR> I can't believe some reviews just read can't help but think most 1 2 star reviewers would better served getting soup salad breadsticks Olive Garden  The menu Enoteca best Italian restaurants all Vegas cheeses Honey Cherries Apricots best cheese selections all Vegas   I've half menu now haven't disappointing dish but favorite part dinner digestifs dessert  Nothing beats olive oil gelato blood orange sorbet try 50 year old balsamic vinegar! <EOR> We dinner first night Vegas coming later just wanted something light quick before headed night   actually push reservation back hour because delayed AZ more happy us   also arrived before two members party happy seat table     We ordered drinks start friends arrived   point seemed if several servers which normally don't mind fact rather enjoy but no flow servers   Nobody really knew anyone doing until finally able mention server preferred him   took away bread plates before even chance bread asked them back told didn't need them because salads coming right out   Um oookkkk   record salads took while  But very good  The service picked better night but say really unimpressed   definitely inexpensive option Dinner 5 two bottles wine came $262 but fast we almost three hours necessarily savory   margherita pizza unremarkable dinner companions felt same way meals   Again another disappointing experience Venetian's casual restaurants  <EOR> Eating such delight  Mario Batali exceeded expectations   few surprises but Italian food phenomenal  part made give start four star rating bread gave us  bread individually wrapped burnt  Also gave bread sticks which created unnecessary mess table  hoping explanation but still yet discovered   My friends started off 7 cheeses which phenomenal black truffle honey black cherry sauce apricot offered pair cheese  would highly suggest getting cheese if love all   As entrees Braised Pork Shoulder which seems specialty restaurant   very tender cucumbers pair amazingly well pork  friends also Lamb Ribs which also great  Radicchio balsamic dish amazing Veal Ricotta Meatballs which tasted mediocre just three huge meatballs   The service wonderful server provided menus breadsticks place mats which very interesting   The timeliness precise because did notify host 7pm showing able eat 5 15 leave 6 15   In conclusion great experience lovely time middle Venetian  <EOR> I thought long hard say place believe offer something fair assessment happened when wife stopped early dinner anniversary   I am familiar Batalli restaurants knew going supposed fine dining   dress code business casual enforced all most Burger Kings quieter but expected lively ambiance   did expect rude nasty service   We walked calling asking if taking walk ins   nice table pleased well way hustle bustle canal   server prompt getting drinks going then all hell broke loose   The loud pushy manager suggested let order appetizers because taking time considering pairings wine   He made suggestion seemed reasonable ordered three cheeses three meats brought table promptly packaged breads wine   enjoying appetizers when server reappeared said need clear table 5 30 weren't told that? She then pressured entree orders right away   reluctantly but very angrily ordered then manager gall reappear ask wines entrees!  told any mood since told 20 more minutes table   He said loudly SIR rearranged some reservations fine! Note He never apologized mistake loud when confronted mistake then continued try sell check adding wines!  idiot relentless   calmed down ate dinner did order wine deserts held table another hour 20 minutes   However experience marred cattle herd mentality rude treatment openly pushy manager clearly doesn't care dining experience   All Italian restaurant   If want rush people change name McDonald's    This place disappointing joke   Chef Batalli take your good name off trough   Tourists locals don't reward them your business   Canaletto right next door treated very warmly last time  <EOR> I came dinner before going see Garth Brooks *YAY BIG 5 heartfelt Yelp stars Garth Brooks!* say food good but memorable   Having blessed all Bay Area n goodness abounds doorways well traveled North Beach cafes tiny tables hidden neighborhood trattorias Enoteca San Marco just didn't really stand out    Bucatini All'Amatriciana which good little salty but good   Gnocco Fritto much heart all things fried little doughy snake shaped fried breads little much two three pretty much done  Very rich filling  Perhaps best part meal bite caramel gelato came bestie's birthday not compliments house but candlelit nevertheless    gelato velvety smooth overly sweet   Skip cinnamon gelato reminded milk tastes finishing some Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal unless that      Our waiter slow inattentive   other people guy bringing water other people's waiters seemed more concerned dining experience waiter    Ambience simplicity restaurant but overwhelming glare Las Vegas tends flood 'outdoor' seating area  see tourists wheel suitcases hear opera singers performing thirty feet away open forum catch occasional stare passers trying indiscreetly discern contents your pasta    It fun once but see else Las Vegas offer next time  <EOR> Their Pasta wasn't all great  needed more sauce  No flavor  But platter different hams bomb bottle merlot  dessert really good   banana gelato lady fingers  dont' know why Mario Batali Iron Chef when pasta tasted shiet  <EOR> Bad service mediocre food overpriced    I would advise bother but great view performers square  <EOR> Wow   disappointed experience   watch Iron Chef fairly religiously always thought Batali Morimoto chefs totally looking forward eating Batali restaurant while Vegas   checked reviews all three places noticed two $$$$ $$ but all similar reviews   Similar more dissatisfied customers comfortable with   decided play safe test ESM lunch if good check others dinner another day   Needless say only Batali experience   Our service hostess great she sat husband four person table could both sit side watch street show St  Mark's square   star that   But sadly good service then came screeching halt   saw very little server throughout rest meal    He dropped off boring cold bread took orders didn't see again until food removed table he came back dessert order   done took forever again check   We ordered balsamic marinated figs start gemeli pasta house sausage broccoli rabe first course pork shoulder main course cactus pear sorbet goat cheese gelato dessert    absolutely LOVE figs enjoyed first dish very much although wasn't particularly unique difficult prepare   Half star figs   pasta disgusting   agree everyone else says he gives al dente new meaning  the pasta cooked enough all liking   sausage completely flavorless bitterness broccoli rabe completely dominated everything   If waiter come back check would told so   pork shoulder good give them but equally delicious pork shoulder crockpot home MUCH cheaper   Another half star pork   time husband trying convince didn't need spend any more money dessert but determined give last chance   saw goat cheese gelato menu since LOVE goat cheese figured money   Sadly no dish bad pasta one   cactus pear sorbet saccharine sweet goat cheese gelato tasted nothing goat cheese   and even worse when eaten together   ended eating only three four bites $12 dessert     I am sure must just horrible luck dishes ordered because am having really hard time believing food representative Mario Batali's cooking but pretty sure everyone restaurant day and would notice whenever passed throughout visit also receiving horrid service   many bored hungry looking people straining necks find server   Inexcusable     Hope better luck there  <EOR> First let say Mario Battali favorite chefs  pizzeria mozza LA delicious  am still waiting table Osteria mozza when saw he restaurant Vegas knew wanted go  green certified restaurant when looked menu online everything sounded divine   I wish could say food actually good sounded menu  restaurant itself very nice located inside Venetian loved setting lighting decor even plating  Foodwise ordered friday special braised beef panini  disappointing because dry pork rather hard  didn't seem fresh but rather if frozen just heated served  also three cheese platter goat cheese mozzarella parmesan  delicious served cherries apricot honey cheese sweet fruits honey along perfectly  Sadly cheese plate only good thing dinner  friend duck overly salty also kind dry  pizzas again seem if just frozen heated addition came cold  Maybe just bad day but am fan higher expectations  <EOR> For casual but upscale ish light dining experience Enoteca San Marco Venetian isn't bad choice   My wife very good salad Acetaia Vinegar Maker's Salad she enjoyed quite bit   simple pizza Margherita which seemed overly simplistic thin layer sauce some slices buffalo mozzarella fresh basil but really all crust good pizza should crispy chewy good hearty flavor   Despite its apparent simplicity satisfied choice   I very respectable glass Soave lunch while wife cold beer   Service competent relatively pleasant   I'd again  <EOR> Eating plate pasta Venetian may equivalent trip Italy but damned if didn't enjoy lunch Enoteca San Marco   cute cheesy setting its fake sky numerous indoor street performers entertaining don't believe ever met Mario Batali joint didn't love   I came leisurely lunch family few family friends sat pseudo patio   Men full make stilts traipsed tourists looked amused   direct appreciation Enoteca San Marco provided paper placemats taught pick stranger Vegas club obscene hand signs both Italian   Service accordingly casual friendly   We provided breadsticks spongey herb focaccia when sat down   table then shared caprese burrata well verdure grande starters   caprese excellent composed oozy cheese bright refreshing tomatoes topped pine nuts light green dressing   verdure grande consisted seven vegetable dishes circular yellow jars $28 if you've ever Otto New York you've them before   vegetables rotate but visit lentils alla Toscana roasted beets saba corn tomatoes radish bagna cauda marinated zucchine eggplant caponata farro pine nuts feta   every dish spectacular but all decent loved lentils beets corn   variety freshness ingredients made verdure grande worth getting   For entree couldn't pass cavatappi lamb ragu mint tomato   al dente corkscrew pasta great lamb ragu point tender well seasoned meaty   tomato sauce hearty mint added accent coolness enhanced warm flavors   mom's linguine con le cozze linguini mussels saffron marjoram another winning pasta   very salty but good way   pasta ended being flavorful minimal embellishment saffron pleasantly pronounced   brother's spaghettini mushrooms thyme garlic also quite flavorful lightly sauced but richness came robust fragrant mushrooms   Also good dad's veal ricotta meatballs   love carbs but hard argue lush soft juicy meatballs paired nothing more herbs tomato sauce   only entree didn't adore little brother's pizza sausage red peppers   Even good zesty flavors thin crust but last time Batali's pizza Mozza man sets own bar   For dessert table split two copettas fancy word sundaes   espresso copetta came espresso gelato blackberry sorbetto fresh blackberries   wouldn't thought pair coffee blackberries but sundae fantastic   flavors worked liked espresso gelato bit coffee bean crunch   olive oil copetta even better boasting olive oil gelato melon sorbetto melon salad   sweet melon mellow salty olive oil perfect together   melon salad added more ripe sugar well toothsome texture doubt sundae could better   I rolled Enoteca San Marco early afternoon didn't another full meal until next morning   gambled fiend all night didn't feel particularly hungry   love Mario enabling both gluttony extended hours spent poker tables   Viva Las Vegas say  <EOR> I am crossroads review wish

Whatever reason felt completely shafted all downhill here    To put things perspective let walk through dining experience  service downright most negligent ever witness  Any request made only took extremely long time fulfil but ask least 3 4 different people each time  ridiculous half mind just myself  When actually decided grace presence job outright disrespect apathy palpable  appetizers came entrees did I hate when your appetizers meal because feel if they're trying rush and or can't take time enjoy yourself    Service aside food itself wasn't shabby  entrees ordered consisted pork shoulder veal meatballs pork chops pasta dish can't remember  Nothing write home but ok most part    At end meal service card came check wrote down complaints had  Usually let sub par service slide because 1 bitchy enough anything 2 never seems worth while  could wine helped once lifetime complaint happen but regardless necessary  cap whole ordeal off when turn card way only barely acknowledged but card itself merely tossed aside  already pretty pissed off point but pushed over top  called into restaurant filed complaint manager  friends completely appalled way treated made note come back next Vegas trip    If skip place Tao  Better food exceptional service  Way Mario proud guys  <EOR> The atmosphere granted say pretty nice sipping  your glass white wine under some realistic clouds your overheard looking people pass but pretty much sums anything great say Mario Batali's restaraunt  assortment cheese should just own judgement rather then server's because only 2 3 good  also some Prosciutto Balls just wasnt feeling whole texure taste it For entrees Crispy Duck w house raisins black italian kale honeslty would much rather Asian supermarket buy 15 99 peking bbq duck  bf bucatini portion small appetizor plate SALTY he couldnt even finish it! bf pretty much dissapointed because wrong Italian food? Oh well maybe just ordered wrong thing but coming back because whole lunch costed close 100 bucks! = <EOR> Got bucatini overcooked  Batali all al dente don't know wrong here  wine options pretty ridiculously expensive cheapest red wine menu $16 glass    Overall impressed Batali establishment  B B down hall much better give try  <EOR> Decently priced business casual dining place Venetian   party 8 ate NYE   Half dishes AMAZING while other half just ok     Do prosciutto   still remember melted mouth  Great quality!   Pork Belly Rigatoni   dish some really bold flavors   you won't disappointed!  prosciutto pizza also really tasty I believe specials      I also taste Bucatini didn't impress Penne alla Norma decent Sausage Peppers pizza also didn't impress      While portions little smaller side italian dishes think good enough   Don't forget Las Vegas need save room drinks!   I definitely back just eat Pork Belly Rigatoni! Delicious! 3 5 stars rounded 4  <EOR> Simple but very tasty Italian super indoor blue sky San Marco square setting fantastic dining experience    You can't help but love San Marco square area within Venetian Grand Canal shops    man made beautiful blue skies no matter time day outside could midnight would still think 4pm outside  Beautiful Italian architecture all around fancy shops restaurants tons outdoor seating populating busy square  Awesome place just date significant other    Enoteca restaurants where eat outside dine under cool atmosphere people watch  The other restaurants square Canaletto Postrio  decided try place since Mario Batali place but wanted something more casual B B  around 10pm Sat night square restaurants still bustling  20 min wait table but even nice table seated right along edge eating area fantastic view square   The menu definitely more casual Italian bistro menu isn't extensive menu just 8 diff pastas bunch pizzas some entrees numerous appetizers  But good list various Italian wines  didn't some standard Italian restaurant choices linguine clams lasagna etc but did some more original offerings  baby pasta tubes eggplant  tomato sauce $14 looked very simple but tasty  Similarly large rigatoni tubes only cauliflower puree chili flakes $14 very simple but tasty nice kick chili flakes  Portions definitely modest could leave very hungry person unsatisfied  However guess Batali really believes simplicity huge portions  BTW bread very crusty came excellent extra virgin olive oil dipping   Service very good overall spotty times  did attention detail when some wine waitress looked wine glasses decided replace since perfectly shiny looked fine     Bottom line Simple but delicious Italian bistro dishes made care romantic setting  <EOR> Enoteca San Marco located St  Mark's Square which hard find if overly familiar Venetian  friends chose restaurant because she wanted Italian moderate price  those two regards Enoteca San Marco met expectations but terms amazing service quality food totally let down  Sure food fresh but didn't any wow factor all   First multiple servers throughout meal I think five during meal much prefer having only two servers build relationship throughout course meal  group started cheese plate burrata fontina parmigiano reggiano which came three different items dip cheese the group's favorite honey   dinner Bavette Cacio e Pepe which really just pasta black pepper cheese olive oil  very basic but pasta very fresh  Two dining companions spaghetti meatball special which both loved especially because meatballs spicy another friend spaghetti zucchini olive oil special which she said very fresh other friend butternut squash braised pork shoulder  While all enjoyed meals wowed all  However dessert did raving shared cream puffs each three gelato flavor choosing  almond gelato cream puff far favorite   While portion wine meal trip $48 which didn't think bad can't say very impressed Mario Batali visiting Enoteca San Marco am running visit another restaurants anytime near future  Definitely 3 stars  <EOR> I came group friends good Italian style dinner which wouldn't overly expensive  restaurant pretty cool sit outside area San Marco Square Canal Shops Venetian  really outside but kinda feels a little  being seated waiter came over tell specials take drink orders etc    all usual banter  But he overly pushy everything  He definitely tried over over order tasting menu which very insulting annoying  Overall attitude big put off therefore thought service abysmal   The food however totally different story! delicious!
