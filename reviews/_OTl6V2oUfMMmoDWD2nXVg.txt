As leaving employees maybe owner manager? gave list GF restaurants Vegas some helpful websites since mentioned newly GF  Love kind customer service! I docked star because although espresso milk steamer don't any flavors coffee drinks  vanilla latte mocha gal would great if full espresso bar  Also food all packaged plastic boxes even display case  Better serve food plates actual silverware customers eating in  know being nit picky   but just adds whole experience  We definitely back glad found Beau Monde! <EOR> Great gluten free bakery  asked ordering specific loaf she very accommodating request  Even picked loaf next morning warm fresh baked  She gave instruction storing last longer too  <EOR> It's hard find good safe gluten free bakery let alone constant variety selection available daily  In slowly working through everything offer   If follow instagram you'll know special treats they'll ahead time    Everything delicious but still can't believe muffins truly gluten free  amazing   The people working super friendly well   can't recommend place enough   My favorite besides muffins would tirimisu   donuts pizza when available fast because they're delicious   It's gluten free dedicated bakery there's no worry cross contamination   buy extra freeze still good when thaw later  <EOR> I wonder  do gluten free people just used taste different tasting pastries? mom just recently gluten free because health condition trying find places bring all eat support diet  say hard struggle starting first timers doctor told bakery sold gluten free desserts breads  decided drive over day try place out! When walked looked almost small coffee shop deli rather bakery but cute display shelf baskets cupcakes muffins breads! really home y almost   We tried chocolate banana nut muffin coffee cake two red velvet cake pops  say didn't really enjoy it  first thought just might used taste but other people test too  conclusion everything tasted dry bland  cake pop however might better if whipped gluten free icing instead using white chocolate because would kept cake more moist!   The prices just okay  opinion bread just expensive even consider buying without them handing sample try  just small loaf  Oh yes yes  gluten free baking items more expensive buy things but since being gluten free serious health condition people REALLY looking places rely safe gluten! tough world more companies making gluten free items more accessible cheaper regular market!!  I haven't decided if coming back but if it'll taste something else! <EOR> Be aware bakery!!  ordered smallest birthday cake available which cost whopping $55   Needed friend cannot gluten   chose beautiful decorated cake book pics showed me    When picked cake absolutely NOTHING decoration top cake   All birthday message   Angry asked girl happened she said ordered   She couldn't anything me   never back   Shame them ripping off        doesn't happen very often  <EOR> I'm totally fan place! pecan tart fave! pizzas good too! Only reason gave 4 stars because wish chocolate didn't contain soy  couple other places where chocolate doesn't contain soy hopefully fix future! <EOR> FINALLY!!! gluten free loaf bread isn't dirt dry doesn't fall apart actually taste delicious!   For quite some time search gluten free bakery would offer good loaf bread coukd use build sandwhich  Some health food stores carry certain brands which gluten free but quickly through most brands all them seemed same consistency awful taste would fall apart while attempting eat  did good search online Yelp few bakeries popped but we're really only pastries  did however find location Henderson which quite excited reviews consistent 5 star level also consistently named Best Las Vegas people good things say loaves  Blah bread horrible  Beau Monde other hand heaven sent    It's amazing never stopped sooner only work 5 min wonderful place  hidden remote place where does much attention  shop very neat modern  menus small but reason they're cranking some awesome stuff  selection 9 loaves bread  decided tell baker assisted problem all loaves tried explained looking something moist delicious  She kitchen brought slice Multi seed bread  soon bit into sold!
