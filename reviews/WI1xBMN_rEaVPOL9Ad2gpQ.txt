I ordered filet medium rare girlfriend ordered NY Strip medium well almost no pink    When food came steak rarer mine!   3 shots right while everything else table cold    didn't even offer heat anything else until demanded    3rd attempt steak still being served red steak just left   A terrible experience    Las Vegas resident frequent patron fine dining establishments town offer sure all friends know won't back    There's just many great steakhouses town trouble one   The highlight complimentary beef jerky! <EOR> We started having two appetizers flank steak black olives garlic made into paste along balsamic salad which quite good  shrimp appetizer also very tasty   New York strip steak which phenomenal  steak cooked wood fire oven could taste smoky flavor  best steak ever but cooked perfection ordered  <EOR> We fantastic meal last night!! tell u NEVER bad meal Tom's joints  He really does deliver all points  few Star Chefs does IMHO  Wagyu Strip perfectly cooked richness simple deliciousness remember long time  All courses awesome perfect service boot  Special thanks James server  venue built into Mirage jungle super unique view vibe  Very very well done  <EOR> Best ribeye ever ate!

Dessert yummy take pride cocktails   don't think mixologist but drinks worthy coming someone thinks mixologists overrated <EOR> This place much better reviews would indicate   sit bar   Service great   Octopus appetizer excellent   Deserves higher rating   Steaks sides big enough share  Derius bar great  <EOR> Wait staff service good   steak excellent Tabasco peppered Kobe flank   friends duck mediocre fat rendered  didn't time wait fix she just ate it   sides good  worst part experience fact charged $5 hot water  35 mediocre duck 40 steak   find charging hot water ridiculous  <EOR> The food clearly great but experience fell bit short  waiter left half way through meal new waiter introduced himself said he would taking care dropped off dessert menu which perfectly fine  problem he dropped off menus he forgot sat menus ten minutes without ever stopping by  All th food great but steak ordered medium rare came clearly medium well taste great but would nice little red it  <EOR> They describe themselves Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak adds modern twist traditional culinary staples  does  necessarily improving them but certainly twisting them  I cannot fault food preparation itself which skillful ingredients great quality  Slight service issues forgetting side foie gras steak more less promptly rectified but beyond apology delayed separate serving  The oysters good quality but served raw option add flavors taste would probably enhanced experience  bone marrow mousse bit eh most flavor disappeared chips interesting albeit distracting addition  steaks good quality wood grill taste maybe bit overdone overpowering  desert bruleed cheesecake absolute disappointment  Cocktails ok if tad pricy wine list fairly restricted the glass options ridiculously priced bottles  All all worth money won't back  <EOR> Nice atmosphere  Loud water fall noise background  casino noice  visually pretty here  steak undercooked but took care right away  lobster bisque  croissant topping really good bisque itself salty  service excellent far  Nice place eat if staying mirage  <EOR> Had dinner Saturday 10 18 family celebrate birthday weekend     Making reservation quick no hassle     Upon arrival fifteen minutes early hostess seated immediately without any problem     There few individuals assisted table but main server James   don't remember introducing himself upon arrival table he gave menus  gets irritating he did come back table over ten minutes even ask would drink     For appetizers ordered Poached Gulf Shrimp Spanish Salad which shared family style  Both appetizers delicious seasoned perfectly     For main course ordered Bone In Rib Eye Braised Brisket Roasted Sea Bass   All three delicious each enjoyed meal   sides ordered spicy onion rings risotto   Braised Brisket favorite ordered again if menu New York restaurant    Yes visit Tom Colicchio's restaurant New York coming December birthday weekend    The meal delicious but server James lacked service etiquette   During meal he came twice once asked if anyone wanted another wine   rest servers more helpful James server stands don't know he's name but he older wore glasses   individual actually came over ask meal handed copy receipt meal thanked coming     I wished could give place more three stars but service very important especially restaurants under name someone famous  <EOR> We contacted restaurant's general manager negative experience relayed her   good feeling know professionalism sincere concern quality hallmark establishment bears Tom Colicchio's name   want right look

 When ready sat hostess servers extremely helpful offered transfer open tabs table    Our group shared few appetizers pretty good   Everyone's favorite octopus though    liked much order second order    For dinner table decided stick only ordering heritage steaks  skirt wagyu filet  wagyu obviously best but pricetag   yikes  Regardless piece meat work art  incredibly tender pretty much just melted your mouth  very little chewing done  Probably most rich flavorful piece cow ever consumed  Puts smile face thinking it     As far sides nothing stood but brussell sprouts  Very good flavor   The restaurant modern clean dark wood accents  Lighting sets mood nice dinner out  Overall loved layout however bit confusing when youre looking restrooms  accidentally almost walked into kitchen twice

We surveyed wine menu first warn most wines very expensive one saw five figures most three four figures but smattering under $100 bottles choose don't put off that   on site sommelier knowledgeable charming sociable great discussion before settling red wine   Then menu    Oh menu   menu alone drool multiple cuts steak available well great sampling seafood surf and turf if  your preference   side dishes la carte which frankly expected   Our waiter Farzad attentive polite downright funny three hit off smashingly well he struck just right balance between attentive smothering   both wanted bone in ribeye he suggested since both wanted same cut meat cooked same way simply order 32 ounce bone in dry aged would split us   He mentioned favorite thing when he visits restaurant wife friend rousing recommendation opinion waiter voluntarily visits place employment meal!  He also recommended steak cooked medium both prefer medium rare gave brief pause thought but decided abide recommendation   I am glad did!  steak cooked sublime perfection juicy tender butter cutting it   flavor outstanding sear perfect side dishes chose smoked Gouda scalloped potatoes mushrooms simply ideal   All steaks served three dipping sauces speak creamed horseradish chimichurri tamarind sauce think A1 but more tangy    did sample three sauces see tasted but honestly steak needed no help juices plate perfect dip !  Backing bit tried oysters appetizer sort grapefruit sauce them served grilled avocado slices marvelous!  did also each salad both salads very good too   I wish could speak dessert quality but salad oysters steak mushrooms potatoes plus red wine NO room left!!  did survey dessert menu very quirky unique range options including some traditional standbys chocolate cheesecake example    quite sure given quality dinner desserts would excellent well   Surprisingly even though next casino Sunday night 1700 restaurant somehow managed intimate much quieter would expected   Seating very cozy very comfortable   Bottom line?  Waitstaff excellent sommelier charming atmosphere marvelous food worth every penny   inexpensive restaurant but quite frankly best steak ever had   definitely back next time Vegas smashingly delicious!  Three days meal we're still talking it!  Try won't disappointed!

Please don't insult us  finally came senses gave another order just simple salt pepper scallops which told them to   second go around scallops perfectly cooked   If you're fan Chopped Food Network know Scott Conant despises raw red onion? Well same way flat leaf parsley  can't stand stuff when overused  leaves such bitter overpowering flavor shatters taste buds  Both octopus bone marrow appetizers covered much flat leaf parsley scrape all off  Blech   5 stars steak 3 stars everything else  <EOR> Extremely tasty meal  Australian wagu flank steak or skirt steak?
