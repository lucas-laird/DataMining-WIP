just few http simplyromanesco blogspot com 2012 07 sw wynning steak html <EOR> One favorite restaurants Vegas  least six times consistently excellent  love food ambiance service  seafood tower bottle wine fun share your friends love  <EOR> Possibly best filet mignon ever had  Cute show great atmosphere  I also creamed corn die bacon muffins super <EOR> I hate but must   First let say some following review may just bad luck us   But same time entire experience go   I'll brief summary then read rest detail if still want know more   First let say Wife always tried trip SW part any trip Las Vegas past 10 years so   They lost reservation re book another night   MINUS STAR     The Restaurant incredibly loud Monday night   it strain talk among ourselves table loud   MINUS STAR    Our Table tucked away corner absolutely no view 'Lake Dreams' show which part helps separate SW every other Steak House Strip   MINUS STAR     Corkage Policy dare try find posted anywhere website   Let save trouble   100 dollars per bottle     MINUS STAR      The Full Story experience I called booked table group two weeks prior visit   called night before confirm but no record us   able re book following night party which while ideal would still work us   ***MINUS STAR***  So two days later arrive time short wait seated   restaurant packed seemed far louder ever experienced before   never quiet but seemed extreme   The Signature SW cocktails now over 20 bucks each group Manhattan pair Martini's honestly while prepared well did provide sort experience price tag would justify   We then seated far corner restaurant behind pillar no view 'Lake Dreams' water show which always part made dining SW great   LOUD   loud all struggled hear another really destroying atmosphere   don't know if location table if added more tables into space but hour dinner starting headache noise   ***MINUS TWO STARS*** One no view noise Backing special evening other couple anniversary brought couple amazing bottles private collections help celebrate moment   we're being seated Hostess asked if knew corkage policy said yes many bottles past   I'd point here   Nowhere SW Website list current corkage policy   turns currently charge HUNDRED DOLLARS per bottle   discovered when bill came   don't begrudge restaurants charging corkage wine guy it   But those prices service should flawless   Instead ended some sediment both decanters wine glasses honestly low rent Riedel glasses buy Target better stems given  ***MINUS STAR***  The food great expensive but everything prepared perfectly no complaints there   But lots places expensive well prepared food Vegas    made SW special past total experience   event we'll probably never back we're sad many great dinners them past   One last note SW proudly displays signage enforcing dress code years past nice   But number dinners jeans t shirts really hurts image place   least require collared shirt men if you're going worry dress code all  <EOR> I'm vegan eating vegan menu but best food ever had   mushroom croquette appetizer incredible   most delicate flavorful combination ingredients imagine   gardein chick'n just you've home but something extremely authentic marinated herbs spices   I can't recommend place enough   little loud waterfall show weird but food world service excellent while cheap wasn't even expensive expected  <EOR> Best steak hands down   used love Smith wollenskys Vegas but sw blew mind   Came party 12 busy night steaks still came perfect   Could believe good rib eye was   Seasoned just right tenderness eating new born cow just melted perfectly   little pricier side but can't complain still going come back   Far better value carnevino   remember sides being pretty good but still can't stop thinking steak  <EOR> This place never disappoints  3 times now food always control good  time staff very friendly took over hour food  its hot restaurant party only diners there   However show lake takes place every 20 minutes really cool watch    Pricing line every nice steakhouse Chicago  125 person least if boozing  I keep going back  <EOR> My girlfriends took nicer dinner during Bachelorette Party   steak unbelievably delicious   wasn't expecting much used Mastro Cut etc   But pretty much blown away tender steak was  filet while couple girlfriends shared rib eye   No complaints anyone table  only reason why give 1 less star because sides great   portions small well  au gratin potatoes cream spinach mushroom   3 would say au gratin potatoes wins sides sections  Definitely place try if $$$ afford MINIMUM $54 filet only + tax + tip  <EOR> My wife loved place   see why rated top steakhouses Las Vegas   NY Strip wonderful but halibut wife ordered extraordinary   could more perfect   steakhouse right next evening light show Wynn puts on   sat window wonderful view goings on   sundown enjoy show   rather pricey many Wynn restaurants but worthy special occasion    your wife's birthday  <EOR> The steaks really good everything else so so   This definitely kind place cares more looking fancy making exquisite food  There's nothing memorable food here  If you're looking steakhouse special occasion would highly recommend Craftsteak MGM Grand instead which lot more polish attention detail much better food   Salad  Overdressed but ok  King Crab Pasta  terrible creamy mess   Mushroom side  Incredibly salty inedible  Asparagus side  ok   Filet Mignon  excellent cooked perfectly  Funnel cake dessert  really fun cool presentation ok taste    We ordered two bottles wine table sommelier solid  didn't sit bar but I'd imagine would pretty good there    Bottom line If you're staying Wynn looking good place eat drink  food good  If you're looking place dine special occasion look elsewhere  <EOR> One best places eaten long time! split new york strip steak roasted asparagus mashed potatoes then funnel cake dessert  Everything delicious cooked perfectly! Service excellent if seat outside cause great view even show  Definitely coming back next time visit! <EOR> This past Friday night friend dinner SW  sat bar offer full menu bar  ordered steakhouse chopped salad which very good addition salad ordered grilled shrimp  send back twice  Once because cold second time because raw  Receiving raw uncooked shrimp would expect type steakhouse  <EOR> WE expected much more!  Called reservation young women said dress code no jeans needed shirt collar etc   BALONEY   People casually dressed BIG disappointment   food mediocre   foie gras blueberry jam REALLY!!!  Crabcakes fishy   Snapper soppy   Service O K   PICASSO BELLAGIO if want wonderful meal   Don't here  <EOR> The best thing Wynn Encore!  host wait staff excellent  food amazing ambiance breath taking   late 5 30pm reservation show tickets 7pm   gave excellent service food came quickly never empty drink   Oh yeah cheddar bacon biscuits die for!!!! <EOR> I've yelping freeloader many years  use yelp everyday  first review  also chef  hold very high standards fine dining   I'll sweet short   We group 15 Friday night during Memorial Day weekend  Very busy night  put private rooms back  I would say food executed very well  Wagyu steak King Crab legs which absolutely delicious  Halibut Filets Chicken Ribeye   I didn't bad thing say  very rare believe when say that   Bread really good especially pretzel    Servers little slow clearing plates  But did hustle when asked clear them   I would recommend SW anyone appreciates great meal  done right  <EOR> Bone ribeye best EVER tasted!! Service 5 star view waterfall music show adds wonderful ambiance   would recommend restaurant EVERYONE visits Vegas  <EOR> The only place vegas certified real authentic Kobe beef although always all cuts stock     best overall dining experiences ever including service decor Old Fashioned's sides steak prep   never order dessert but every time always funnel cake  <EOR> Wonderful!  Great atmosphere sit outside if can wonderful service delicious food  Since steak night prior opted scallops incredible    buttery melty fantastic risotto  friend salmon    she might well licked plate afterwards  steak tartar good kale salad perfect  Although am vegan would strongly encourage try vegan cheesecake unreal!  This ranks favorite spots Las Vegas  won't wrong here  <EOR> This wasn't all that  ordered scallops risotto um    yeah scallops raw lacked color flavor andmy risotto like    stick mushy  didn't want big deal mean ate other 2 scallops whatever   aunt next ordered filet well done     but she burnt crisp! Lol couldn't believe it  Sometimes u really don't pay for  just wasn't impressed  Oh Sunday prob different chef working day     BUT still no excuse  food should made parr  <EOR> The truffle corn!  personal steakhouse though many choose Vegas   also genuine non poser Kobe steak $42 ounce last remember    haven't bad experience yet  <EOR> It great experience steakhouse  Don't try chicken its specialty  signature cheesecake tasty chocolate molten cake woow Chocolate well melted  prices very expensive  216 $ 2 person  <EOR> Decent selection steaks sides  Many steaks very large better off splitting someone because amount meat high prices  lower rating because service night really poor   Waitress came just asked if ready no real introduction tips menu  ask her  During dinner she disappeared long time never really met replacement  pour all own wine rarely water filled slow clear items table  did complain nicely end manager removed gravity side dishes bill classy but would expect better service prices paying <EOR> 4 Stars food  3 stars service   The view waterfall Wynn gorgeous but service put damper evening  waiter rude beyond comprehension ignored table party 14 table next bachelorette party  would think party 14 bill exceeding $1200 would treated better    But say filet amazing appetizer  manager apologized service but won't going back  <EOR> If great steakhouse  this place you!

Nah   The bottom line this     if you've solid steakhouses wherever you're then SW might seem average   example if you're SF you've House Prime Rib Bobo's etc then SW no big deal    just another expensive Vegas steakhouse that'll cost $150 person   better other steakhouses Vegas?  Yup definitely   Does fact Wynn exclusive reputation packed solid beautiful people SW bit overhyped?  Yup definitely  <EOR> I generally think food Vegas crap over priced until ate here  also can't Mom into nice restaurant unless allow wear jeans she thinks frou frou thankfully weighed down w shopping bags she pretty tired dinner bar was    The crab cake yes only one awesome   The kobe carpaccio a big 'ol plate it amazing  fried capers made perfect   The cesar they split half good yummy cheese crackers top   Cocktails good strong   Bartenders funny provided great service    I excited eat somewhere Vegas actually tasted good sorta eating home in SF is that  definitely back hopefully summer watch show outside every half hour    4 5 Staaaaars <EOR> I absolutely love SW Steakhouse second time good remembered it    The interior very classic lake dreams upscale designs   when walk into place doesn't feel other $$$$ Hollywood LA less pretentious still fun but more mature    The waiters attentive point never missed thing  Everyone ordered classic Caesar start especially liked baked parmesan stick   sides sauteed mushrooms creamed corn au gratin potatoes creamed spinach also order preference   all really great but mushrooms creamed corn favorite!

Fellow Yelper Jim T  place because good steak try anywhere  decided split 40 ounce Porterhouse  only more meat but cheaper getting two steaks any size separately    I started wedge asked chopped  chopped but way overdone Bleu Cheese  bacon very flavorful overdoing Bleu Cheese only made dish average    Now steak ordered medium  came Medium rare strip side but well done no pink fillet side  saved day Jim T didn't mind medium rare flavor very good  crusted just hint salt pepper    I asked SW sauce server brought trio sauces SW sauce which sort A 1 barbeque blend thingy Worcestershire hot pepper sauce  skipped hot pepper stuff    Side dishes grilled asparagus au gratin potatoes  sides very nice complimented meal    After dinner felt drink  noticed vanilla ice cream desert asked if could Brandy Alexander me  Sorry Sir since blender bar   No blender anywhere? said  Sorry sir  would take forever drinks bar if blending drinks  He said  Really  He said this! Interesting Applebees Chili's figure run efficient bar but Wynn can't? Really?   Anyway settled glass Port very good    I really wanted place  if better experience next time  steak very good  if ordered it  give provisional two stars now  may change later    Overall enjoyed Switch more see yelp that because steak better    And Steve bar blender  <EOR> I love place! show cases waterfall inside restaurant its beautiful  request sit near next time  sat corner facing dining room which excellent people watching! greeted timely manner wine lists dropped   wish more wines glass but found something drink anyways  no carbing but best friend RAVING Bacon bread best things creation!   I love menu because variations would normally see most nice steak houses but additions topping your steak additional cost  think set them different all rest!! additions foie gras OMG all over that! scampi Oscar can't remember others but did mention foie gras ?! Lol friend beef carpaccio toast points baked parm crab cake apps  Both good but better crab cakes  entrees shared bone rib eye foie gras shrimp scampi addition scallops Caesar salad I asked no croutons gave baked parm thought nice touch pork belly Brussel sprouts wow good! lobster mac cheese  funny part very small table but all managed fit Bacon bread ! Lol  Overall awesome  servers nice second server knew foodies asked favorite restaurants etc  Very nice conversation  sat almost 3 hours never felt rushed  Oh since Vegas all saw Brock Lesnar too  Can't really miss lol  great experience again!!!! <EOR> As soon knew going Vegas started scout some pretty nice steakhouses  read lot reviews other steak places but SW seemed winner couln't wait eat there  two days before made reservations 6pm no problems doing that   So main attractions lake light show which missed because left before dark  thought require wear jacket least tie wore tie  When only wearing tie thought wtf? Well anyway cool because steak boy good  service outstanding waitress Katie attentive  couldn't believe GREAT she could probably write whole review just her   Okay food time ordered Candied Orange cocktail which very good but very STRONG too  did but also light weight league one  ordered NY medium rare smoked blu cheese  got  very good but thought going blow socks off but didn't   why only giving 4 stars 5 but service definetly 5 stars no doubt it  also some mashed potatoes which called Yukon puree something which thought funny  didn't any apperziters because big plans NY plus give some very delicous bread butter Hawaiian sea salt olive oil  WOW !!! butter damn good think should sell somehow   When come back Vegas just may stop give Katie extra tip yeah she damn good  would most likey eat again also but would try different drink  great time SW can't wait come back! <EOR> My husband eat prime steakhouses once week  Mastro's Morton's Ruth's Chris Fleming's Duane's Jean Georges many more  safely tell dry aged prime tomahawk restaurant best steak ever eaten  also loved funnel cake dessert especially dipped salted caramel sauce   <EOR> Let's start off good stuff shrimp cocktail four huge delicious shrimp   Also bread very tasty they three different kinds all good   Finally water show lot fun course real Vegas show anything but definitely meal more memorable   Now good stuff   wife both ordered grass fed steak wife ordered healthy version it   waiter screwed gave healthy version too  incredibly bland even and love bland food normally    sure very clear your waitstaff evidently can't handle two people ordering same dish differently   I also ordered Yukon gold potatoes   don't know think Yukon gold means S W but means buttery delicious potatoes  instead very light very flavorless potatoes   wife liked them though   Then real disappointment night lobster ordered steak   overcooked over sauced literally did taste lobster   Honestly tasted much closer generic cheap fish fish sticks did lobster     cost $40!  As service ok but kinda slow given much meal costs  thing really bugged waiter didn't once ask meal even left entire lobster dish un eaten!   Ultimately bill $250 really could gotten better meal Red Lobster Black Angus   No joke   If want great Vegas steakhouse try Craft Steak instead Yukon gold potatoes AMAZING as everything else   S W great free show but nearly good enough justify low quality food extraordinary prices  <EOR> One most overrated expensive restaurants ever quite average service   many other better places try Las Vegas place   Crowded male dominant clientele we taking clients wanted steak place seated next wait station trays etc  carried literally over guest's head all night   Steak presented white plate nothing else food presentation hardly note worthy over cooked requested done ness   The only really great food item night pretzel rolls breadbasket   Salad enough meal unto itself which hate when restaurants that   Maybe because just don't love Vegas looking faults but fabulous meal night before Sinatra which would back before heading again   Not fan    <EOR> One best steakhouse town!

Only few small hiccups timing prevented being utter fantasy  sure did affect overall impression SW but perhaps next time they'll ironed out   After checking 8p reservation waited 20 minutes seated  hoping didn't result nightmare HANGRY but led table just before monster raised ugly head  We'd brought own bottle wine swiftly decanted given some breathing room   Our table probably best ones restaurant right next Lake Dreams  able see 4 5 shows throughout meal  consider myself appreciative artistic endeavors but Lake just little odd me  felt I'd need some extra dream enhancement truly appreciate it  Nevertheless beautiful view   Now food! Pretty spectacular all around  ordered scallops entree split appetizer did disappoint  scallops meaty good char seasoning outside tender inside  sauce delicious red wine gravy  risotto bit firmer prefer but did detract dish   My steak boneless ribeye very solid  I wish I'd ordered medium rare instead medium but still very nice  char seasoning excellent meat pretty tender  ordered lobster add very glad did  Beautiful hunks lobster meat shell over cooked added steak  side creamed spinach shared fantastic well  Just enough cream feel decadent    My dessert bananas foster bread pudding good  wish bigger portion hey girl dream but tasty runny nuts added great texture  ice cream top lovely well    The only bobble dream state speed service issues did improve throughout meal  all leisurely dining experience but some pacing dragged bit much  Perhaps because lake shows perhaps just extremely busy night   Regardless meal SW Steakhouse dream I'd love revisit  <EOR> I'll keep short   AMAZING FOOD! should definitely try place great dishes great ambiance  However lose star because worst servers ever! I think fluke 2 servers both ignored didn't check us  former bartender pissed behavior attitude  try again because sure just 2  <EOR> All say WOW!

Every restaurant Wynn vegan menu trying different things   When asked see vegan menu male server seemed annoyed   usual any other food allergies should aware of?    just made feel uncomfortable he didn't think should wasn't good enough dining there   While waiting order saw servers chatting laughing few minutes   sure just being paranoid but already feeling uncomfortable wondering if talking me?  Now onto food     A female server came take order   She pleasant   placed order she said she would bring vegan bread butter   So brought bread butter but glad asked if vegan because dairy butter two different kinds non vegan bread   bread cheese bacon biscuit   vegan due food allergies cows milk eggs big deal   Usually Wynn don't hound them really vegan? but glad did time   brought correct bread butter but no even apologized mistake   My kale apple salad came next   good pleased it   Very shortly came mushroom dish white bean purée   presently well tasted great   Even though food good minus almost eating dairy egg filled foods mediocre service left bad taste mouth   passed dessert left   way no thanked visiting told good night   Rude   restaurant beautiful ambiance waterfall spectacular but poor service won't back  <EOR> 3 1 2 star review  Honestly disappointed SW  expecting five star meal five star price didn't meal but did price    The biggest complaint steaks sides seemed overseasoned  Everything salty  bad because quality meat outstanding  going lie finished ribeye tender good but salty taste kind ruined me  wife did finish filet all sides leftovers    I also thought service good but little overwhelming  server kept trying upsell wine would come around almost frequently check us  He bordered annoying    Combine all nearly $500 check four people wine left feeling little underwhelmed    I say ambience SW five stars  Just amazing experience sitting outside Lake Dreams watching all shows Wynn puts on  If decide dine SW ask sit patio   Also bread serve before dinner really great  might walk down slip someone 5 some those bacon cheese rolls pretzel bread    Just sure if bread before dinner again anytime soon  <EOR> First time okay over price bad stake burnt don't mind paying great stake but disappointment no flavor drinks water down beautiful place but if u charge lot beautiful stake house u better sure u serve great meal drinks very disappointing Oslo ur chef suppose over see comes customer before abs chef ur waiter let burnt stake table bad service quality control bad saying nothing just don't seen but them never come back refer anyone Vegas lot very disappointing shows management don't care high end stake house don't reach costumers shows don't care <EOR>
