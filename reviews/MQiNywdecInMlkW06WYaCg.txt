We plans Xtreme Sushi Southern Highlands but some friends wanted try Maru Summerlin because opened new AYCE sushi    Going into restaurant pleasing venue clean plenty space   atmosphere beautifully designed however am reviewing strictly AYCE sushi experience   so goes     I must spoiled Xtreme Sushi because AYCE sushi EVERYTHING menu except Sashimi read review Xtreme Sushi http www yelp com user_details_review_search?userid=Oz8Bp1NY Szz4lvSbVsV4Q q=xtreme+sushi !

Dessert only choice green tea vanilla  Green Tea Ice Cream Normal  also refused serve ice cream friends done eating AYCE sushi because still waiting last few items ordered! Weird!   Service am perplexed why Xtremely slow because even busy  Furthermore servers hawking ensure didn't share other friend didn't AYCE only ordered Bibimbap which she said very good   One servers also blocked pushed other friend's hands away because server insisted sushi she ordered only since going individual paper menu pencil in  also didn't give some order end said ran it  Towards end sushi portion became smaller smaller! Very disappointing indeed!   I give Maru 1 2 star some fish quality another 1 2 star owners greeting leaving  owners very nice said come back again  advised them couldn't come back because your servers cut off AYCE sushi  She said she spank them owner well deserved another 1 2 star!

I really want give place 1 star but pretty much ranting AYCE sushi aspect restaurant   only came because closest sushi place buddies house honest PUMPED come since starving AYCE sushi wanted try some new stuff   The building aesthetically pleasing does warm cozy feel it   But service lacking mainly since waitress seemed forget existed     Anyways look all stuff menu then come find every single thing planned ordering AYCE sushi AYCE sushi menu   Fuck That Noise  I never tilted eating sushi fucking defies laws physics   #Hungry #Ripoff #HorribleSelection #WelcomeToSheetySushi <EOR> An incredibly classy restaurant drove way home two years before recognized its existence  plotted front small business complex relatively indistinguishable its surroundings  combination lack advertisement probably reason why place dead three times visited  Each time came all you can eat sushi which they've recently implemented probably bolster business pretty decent  ice cream tastes amazing   A real shame place doesn't see more people deserves it! <EOR> Yesterday afternoon dined Maru Korean Japanese restaurant located off Town Center Summerlin  must say Korean food favorite cuisines perhaps because Koreans very adept food preservation never huge fan anything fermented exception alcohol  Something little fizz attached fermented foods little squeamish  Kimchi great example although also prepared fresh which prefer  any case expose myself all cuisines still eat Korean food occasionally   The Korean dish most bibimbap which only fun say but also fun eat  authentic dish accessible American pallet best served hot stone pot  consists white rice topped pretty display meat variety vegetables raw egg along sweet spicy sauce  first time husband dish without egg started eating toppings first dipping them sauce  corrected waitress came over poured sauce over toppings then used long metal spoon mix all contents pot together into tasty hodge podge  she did dish made more sense next time didn't omit raw egg since heat rice pot cooks state much prefer  Bibimbap served almost all Korean restaurants usually pot enough two average eaters affordable yummy at Maru is$9 99    Korean food always accompanied banchan little side dishes find good way try Korean specialties without having whole meal them  side dishes range seaweed fishcakes cold mashed potatoes kimchi generally served five them  banchan Maru very good appreciate always change bit different experience each time   Ian ordered spicy pork lunch special which wasn't good bibimbap  flavor fine but pork very oily hard find good cuts meat pile  came mediocre tempura average salad rice delicious cup miso soup one better had   agreed probably wouldn't order again   Maru which lovely modern dining room complete mini atrium also sushi bar  ordered sashimi once thought incredibly fresh though rolls menu aren't interesting say Sushi Fever  nice restaurant offers two cuisines please all pallets your party but really bibimbap only reason see come here  <EOR> The only reason gets star low ad go  sitting 30 minutes getting next no service finally left  Worst service ever experienced  <EOR> Have few times  food bad but really great when paying $30+ per entree  service always seems sketchy  bit uppity la Summerlin location   Last night just few people place seated right next couple chatting away  felt same table them  Couldn't figure why hostess did this  PF Changs  good experience  <EOR> I always believe good sushi place really depends chef  chef knows right fish keeping fresh making before serving customers   This 5 star reviews purely based sushi made ONLY Chef Andy legendary sushi chef    For long time admiring chef Andy does magic making sushi  Anyone ever see he works know talking about  expectation toward sushi always higher bar because chef Andy  always laugh when some youngster think know everything sushi  work next you'll look fool   Most people grew environment AYCE sushi atmosphere  even know good sushi? think but trust don't!  Does mean sushi best?   A good chef Andy own pride  Most other chef probably even born yet when Andy start making first sushi  He used making cheap quality sushi but competition sushi plus economy force best quality sushi low given budget   If chef given budget $100 good dish chef B given budget $25 extraordinary dish  Chef able better dish because he more money spend but chef B still very good dish even only using 1 4 budget does chef better chef?  A chef any artist work within limitations  measure chef should he able he quality materials he's working with   I believe if Chef Andy given same budget he definitely best sushi chef Vegas    Yes limitations AYCE menu  Some rolls need extra work included AYCE   Yes course could offer 30 extra menu other place  But other place good quality rolls sushi most chef other AYCE put much sauce much rice rice fell apart while trying pick bad bad bad tasting sauce on    Would pick quantity over quality? If pick quantity then please don't even bother see him   Most AYCE set people pick quantity over quality  But Chef Andy own standard even lowest standard most people still really good sushi   I bet $100 those saying could eat all items 1 page menu 2 breathes  that eat all items your eyes just hungrier your stomach  bet eat more average people eat average 2 cups rice before cooked each meal everyday barely 1 3 sushi menu   It's really fair give star place because don't enough item AYCE menu dessert appetizers enough selection   I eat sushi place sushi PERIOD! don't give s***t some stupid appetizers dessert  If come AYCE appetizers desserts then you'll seriously disappointed  But if want good sushi but don't really want pay full price  Then should come night when Andy works  sure you'll come hungry leave happy  <EOR> I actually joined Yelp could write review  restaurant visually beautiful  quality sushi above average  Pricing food alcohol reasonable  BUT service poor  return  More specifically all eat sushi SCAM  second time noticed orders taken beginning your hour time limit quicker cheaper items come somewhat quickly better rolls don't come until 5 minutes left can't order again  gave them benefit doubt first visit but second visit blatant only 2 other tables couple sushi bar entire hour    I'm going return 3rd trip verify again  Long story short don't offer all eat if don't want honor raise prices don't cut corners  <EOR> For Summerlin natives easy take Maru granted   practically backyard see everyday taking kids school seems always open   non fans Korean food easy once then forget but if type cuisine there's no reason think any steps lower Korean restaurant you'd find Koreatown Spring Mtn Jones Strip   and certainly no reason drive further   Maru although its clientele tends mostly non Asian dumbed down menu just usual staples middle American palate bulgogi kalbi etc     Those items definitely available done expertly but more authentic array tripe soups steamed rice bowls very spicy noodle dishes all menu would think fully Korean cooks delighted offerings ticket once while   They're delicious everything else here   except        for sushi   Asian always contended Japanese should run Japanese restaurants Koreans should run Korean eateries Chinese should stay Chinese fare   sushi exploded popularity since 80's seems Asian restauranteurs every ilk now think roll sushi right   but unfortunately still isn't case   few times white tuna yellowtail arrived obviously quickly thawed and consequently lacking any body true flavor seem try putting gigantic slice fish top oversized rice cushion   short would take Japanese mother sushi!
