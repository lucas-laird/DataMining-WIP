Furthermore even though ordered fries waiter didn't even think bring those first  ask him  simple thing would've made time lot easier   Onto food    said burgers decent but nothing special  love bacon burger which comes patty made sirloin applewood smoked bacon toped crispy bacon bacon mayo gouda onion strings  Given ravished point happy eat but don't think ever need try place again  <EOR> If you're you've Vegas billion times dropped lots cash mediocre food 24 hour casino diners STOP DOING over Palazzo's Love heart Burgers   The menu straightforward simple burgers fries shakes   But oh friends much more that   Burgers all kinds veggie bison beef turkey   Fries aplenty fried items galore thick cut skinny cut sweet potato pickle   Shakes alcohol without crazy combos both interesting wildly successful   My personal binge fuel long run dove Oregon Trail moist delicious bison cheddar burger big ol' serving dill pickle fries house dipping sauce half friend's order baked potato wedge fries blue cheese sauce A MUST!!! very own Blueberry Panshake exactly think blueberry shake made maple syrup vanilla   My dining companions both whom vegetarians ! raved veggie burger Buzz shake a concoction coffee Bailey's more deliciousness all home pounds heavier loads happier   A MUST EAT if sick typical low priced Vegas fare! <EOR> We stopped late night bite eat service quick very friendly  burgers good beef tasted fresh cooked them perfectly  fries amazing  Crispy hot should be!

But true question burgers? did disappoint  ordered Fried Mac Cheese Noms start  VERY small but flavor fantastic  burgers! We ordered three could cut them half try variety  Caprese Burger Wagyu Kobe Burger Oregon Trail Burger  well Sweet Potato Fries  The Caprese Burger cooked perfectly all patties however balsamic reduction bit much  quite bit burger feel little less would added it  Sometimes less more  case here  2 star burger  The Wagyu Kobe burger good     But $25 good  patty juicy flavorful but didn't eyes roll back head Kobe Beef should  Truffle Cheese fantastic addition all Truffle cheese amazing all own! didn't care pretzel bun all  3 star burger  The Oregon Trail burger great! Bison Burgers average once week home  those haven't tried Bison doing yourself injustice  Bison lower Fat lower Cholesterol Higher Protein Minerals  amazing sweet taste JUICY!!!!

For remainder stay Venetian stayed clear 'I Love Burgers'  Granted could isolated incident  But bad wasn't worth taking chance  visit only zero stars but would far give multiple negative stars  The WORST burger EVER had  some pretty bad ones  Because good first experience given 2 stars  Otherwise would star  don't think ever give third shot  <EOR> I am disappointed place  difficult find its location Grand Canal Shoppes long waited food food tasted  guest staying Palazzo friend wanted quick dinner before night aka needed greasy food absorb alcohol   saw ad place elevator seemed would fit bill   We sat bar order food sticker shock see average price burger $16  Really?? Burgers great all but don't think size quality solely judging pictures Yelp point justified it  However pressed time ordered Dante BBQ burger  both cooked medium rare avocado   We waited really long time short walk back room discovered food cold overcooked  expect burger place know cook patty medium rare torn see no pink patty   Also think forgot which why food cold  REALLY love burgers most disappointing burger had    Possibly ever  least didn't forget avocado  BBQ sauce avocado probably best parts    I feel cheated meal cost way much  pretty serious enjoying food  some people talk finite mount breaths take see life only limited amount meals you'll have  would've preferred eating food In N Out here  three star rating Yelp place generous   If need quick meal or any meal while Palazzo I'd suggest skipping place going Grand Lux Cafe  least consistent even if chain restaurant  <EOR> Amazing!!

Good beers though     guess <EOR> I enjoyed place tremendously! Besides food being good service it  Host great answering questions waitress bartender hilarious! Oftentimes waitresses just humor questions don't respond back friendly way but waitress joined shenanigans but respectful same time  Unfortunately didn't collect receipt name but she great! She also split burgers without asking  and big deal because weren't sure going split shared portion burgers fries    We ordered coffee shake just way shake would taste  ordered Love Seoul burger  which came kimchi sunny side egg  great  a burger spiciness Asian touch  wasn't greasy know some people described burgers drive in   good! ordered garbage fries think made side dish fresh sliced jalapenos top  wasn't spicy would think but helped cut through fattiness whole meal  meat cheese fries  would definitely come back again! <EOR> Pricey burger if ask but otherwise fine  stopped original lunch plan turned open dinner only  way different but burger sounded good  bracket week seafood beef  ordered caprese burger fresh mozzarella tomato basil balsamic reduction  Really pretty good  combo basil balsamic very good beef  cheese always gets lost little bit more delicate burger tends but  good guess  also sweet potato fries which kind enough ask cinnamon sugar salt  Salt please don't need them sickly sweet  particular note those place doesn't exactly use 97 3 lean beef  More 70 30  Wow   All all satisfying  menu little small guess place name expecting laundry list options when reality only 8 10 some those fish turkey really burgers if ask me  Price high burger but Vegas said million times week  knows if ever back but wouldn't avoid it  <EOR> I came reason friends works bar  reason why give place two stars because burgers myself *personally* redundant but fries very soggy food overly greasy  Ordering Longhorn which thought *slightly* better alternative meat just burger chicken itself greasy liking  fries soggy because much grease put into making them maybe prep back doesn't know fries correctly?  For burger venue wide bar distinctive drinks menu really weren't bad  drinks different creative styles mixed fairly noteworthy burger restaurant  Also your food comes less 10 minutes say service top even observing to go orders waited less 10 minutes receive needed   For drink full bar speed service would gave three stars but food best two stars  those burger restaurants where if you're super drunk hungover Strip greasiness would perfect place soak all up  <EOR> Great Burger Place  Best meat quality well all ingredients  some crazy burgers some good some not  But if stick basics 5 Star Burger <EOR> Amazing Delicious Fried Pickles Inferno Burger off charts Vanilla Bean Shake down right yummy    The Waitress Krys great come!    back!
