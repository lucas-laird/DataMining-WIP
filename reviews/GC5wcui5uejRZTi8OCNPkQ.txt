Nope he told he took Taco plate off your bill  left wonder if any management present all? usually love place several times no issues but today just terrible  Seating  Service  Half order delivered empty glasses all night  would nice know manager aware issues but even long never saw interact all  <EOR> I've only brunch if you're looking dinner maybe disregard review    This place your way eat brunch at  But waiters all very friendly prices reasonable food good    If you're staying Silverton I'd recommend easy decently priced food  I'd also recommend if you're looking bottomless drinks good price  However if you're vicinity find better brunch bottomless drinks elsewhere Vegas   The service also slow not so busy morning ultimately flagged down multiple people waiter almost everything order drinks food check etc  keep mind if somewhere be    Overall brunch good outing but nothing write home about  <EOR> This worst mexican places ever been   service beyond bad food wasn't much better   Try Roberto's taco shop 1 4th price 10000% better quality   feel sicker then when eat taco bell eating place  <EOR> Great food ambience  Really enjoy happy hour menu includes street tacos margarita  street corn delicious !! Kid friendly  <EOR> I grandparents celebrate grandmas birthday  burritos filled all rice no meat  carnitas tasted dog food rice dry hard  salsa also watered down very salty   Costumer service     ok    remind them many times various orders placed   returning  <EOR> Two co workers stopped lunch hitting Bass Pro  weren't expecting much but decor wasn't bad overall chips salsa quite good   All three meals looked pretty tasty but all but flavorless  bit into inch long rib bone chicken enchiladas  great experience  Service wasn't bad but think other table place  <EOR> Pretty good Mexican spot inside Silverton    Table side guacamole made your requested spice level  Bit disappointed shrimp ceviche tasted more pico de gallo  Ceviche very small pieces shrimp lot juice bit dry   Shrimp fajitas!  grilled belle peppers onions large peices if shrimp accompanied beans rice pico guac sour cream warm tortillas  Large portion too!

chicken mole $18   Chips salsa turned good ate them throughout meal even desert  flautas came but quickly deduced chicken beef  tried while Lurch's attention could send them back but when futility became evident just decided eat them anyway  weren't bad but definitely seemed par something could pick freezer aisle  very nice serving girl brought chicken mole  seemed nice presentation but ultimately dish turned just alright   chicken cut into slices OK best quality wise  mole very chocolaty cheese very sparingly applied  eating though did notice dishes very cool plus guess  Post mole Lurch came gave cursory ask if wanted desert seemed surprised when took it  ended fried ice cream $6? which passable   Overall paying cash meal would've thought bit overpriced   say expensive but just sure if would've happy paying received  saw nothing explain why mole expensive appetizer portion very large  High points include chips plates frequent but mysterious trips hostess made past table  Food decent  review seems more negative now believe felt when eating meal could just food quality overshadowed lack server quality experienced  would back again but only because pay food craps table dinner table  2 5 stars rounded hostess  <EOR> Beautiful room but hit miss food  Great selection specialty margaritas but most them sweet   calamari good taquitos but tortilla soup good corn cakes even worst   chicken empanadas marginal   very sweet waitress  Very good job   Overall back <EOR> Food ok   group 5 orders follows 2 orders fish tacos 1 tortilla soup house salad Taco salad Shrimp fajitas  Great portions reasonable prices them   Service slow though  <EOR> This place ok   first time wasn't liking all   overpriced   back since but still lacks something  <EOR> Located inside Silverton Casino next buffet   come every few months when craving Mexican food   love FREE chips salsa fav  medium chunky salsa much flavor just right spice habenero run down but spicy   I usually ordered 3 items entree cuz love sampling varieties food  hehe   The burritos bad all but most popular fajitas   always see people order them   Skip street tacos good!! kinda expensive each rather buy them food truck cheaper tastier The flan coconut dessert best must try!! <EOR> This place GARBAGE  Food tasted frozen microwave food platter  Service slow  wouldn't recommend place all  Your better off going Roberto's  <EOR> Service awful chimichinga worse  Full Spanish rice    nasty  Won't back! <EOR> I wouldn't even give place star last visit  always looked forward coming California anytime visited but place joke  excited eat street tacos order every time but apparently no knows hell means damn Mexican restaurant  order wrong second time gave checked  over charged waiter did care  Thanks shortest worst time dinner  Don't bother coming always empty reason  <EOR> Started complimentary chips 3 salsas  Mild very tasty nicely chunky  medium green nice piquant twang  hot spicy enough good  loved machaca enchiladas  Filled tender flavorful shredded beef smothered cheese excellent smoky enchilada sauce  Partner chicken steak combo fajitas  He said most flavorful chicken he'd ever steak juicy fork tender  Mom shared shredded chicken crispy tacos wanted more  Service quick friendly but little inattentive once food came  could easily flagged server down though big deal  back  <EOR> We became regular strictly location  Move location would quickly forget place  Service negative star if possible  Food good when finally arrives  Drinks ok  Would recommend place unless casino  <EOR> Fantastic Mexican food  really enjoy fajitas large portion great things add into tortillas   also tried nachos which loaded tons cheese  Great spot hit if you're around Silverton casino area  <EOR> I came birthday dinner while staying Silverton  main goal enjoy few margaritas  decided pitcher margaritas am glad did  complimentary salsa chips came quickly  service friendly adequate very busy loud crowd people but able handle small tables customers well  Dinner hot flavorful made order  loved atmosphere decor  could done without TVs but know lot people want date scores  Good place large group romantic date  <EOR> Hostess sat next another table waiting almost 10 minutes watching 4 waiters fight over taking table 2 waiter came took drink appetizer order   few minutes very nice waitress came take dinner order   bar ask refills   manager over help   few minutes later dinner arrived!!
