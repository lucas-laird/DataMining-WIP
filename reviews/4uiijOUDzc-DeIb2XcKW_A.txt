I can't say experience understand mediocre reviews Khotan  wife thoroughly enjoyed meal  didn't sushi stuck mainstream pekinese type dishes lettuce wraps edamame ok they're Japaneze lobster curry sweet sour chicken all which fresh tasty    I suspect place may suffer expectations standpoint  expensive paid approaching twice price Jasmine two nights before similar quality meal  am going brutally honest suggest expensive TI guest same Bellagio neither way     Give place try  really liked it  <EOR> Recently ate Khotan  food quite good  cashew chicken wife sweet sour chicken  While somewhat expensive service bit slow good experience overall especially Groupon discount saving $25  <EOR> What waste time money   dinner thinking chef Social House still but guess should read other reviews posted yelpers   guess if describe restaurant would con fusion   horrible creations think twice eating salmon parmesan roll crab lo mein Alfredo wtf?    Terribly expensive seemed staff didn't care much going around them  <EOR> I extremely excited visit restuarant since d planning reservation weeks thanks smart groupon buy   say seating amazing scenic deck   However say food blah   ordered Salt Pepper Prawns waiter expressed few shells underneath HOWEVER Prawns came whole fried shells eyes   mentioned expecting few shells but couldn't eat through   he said well told came shells half heartely offered recook them   only plate sitting twenty minutes   He avoided table plague could tell he could clearly see eating   end he offered free dessert but time little late me   don't compare high end asian restaurant PF CHANGs but night PF would win   Try GRand Wok MGM grand  <EOR> Like several other reviewers Khotan because friend Groupon course waited until last minute use it   I checked menu before going really scared   really looked Panda Express menu such exotic choices sweet sour chicken orange chicken beef broccoli   Authentic Khotan not  But hey food coupon   The decor inside really wonderful really interesting jade statues ivory carvings wall gold vault like boxes  A++ effort there   We seated outside  nice night   But seriously Sirens show craptastic if you're fan sit inside   We ordered Khotan lobster chicken lo mein brown rice tempura platter   sauce Khotan lobster great but gasp $36  chicken lo mein eh very boring chicken slightly overcooked  tempura platter delicious but anything fried always is   conflicted because generally liked execution food service but such boring menu I'd probably never back   If want expensive Panda Express esque food strip view however your place  <EOR> Not vegetarian friendly waitstaff lies wait staff no idea ingredients serving  take your pick most likely all three true    I asked waiter simple question Most miso soup made fish broth know if your is? He responded no listed ingredients  He reassured vegetarian  soon soup arrived tasted could tell contained fish broth  waiter apologetic ordered another side dish   As leaving spoke manager claimed he came table spoke during dinner  He not  left feeling place full bunch liars  would catastrophic if fish allergy instead being 20 year veteran vegetarianism   Too bad returning restaurant great view  <EOR> You IGNORE all complaints regarding price restaurant formerly Social House formerly Khotan Pan Asian Cuisine now name Khotan Asian Bistro NEW menu lower prices   More importantly few restaurants Las Vegas offer more impressive atmosphere   Anyone comparing Panda Express even PF Changs simply doing place justice   modern sleek decor hasn't changed much days Social House except fact added some stunning jade ivory sculptures display   Most importantly food presentation taste service well beyond expectations reasonably priced restaurant Las Vegas Strip   Can Asian food good better lower price down street Spring Mountain Las Vegas Chinatown?  Yes course but no where near same dining experience terms location seating indoor outdoor ambiance cool vibe   I would challenge some those previously rated place less 4 give another try   Unless complete foodie snob and or no clue normal price Las Vegas Strip restaurant difficult rate dining experience lower 4   course  IMHO  <EOR> Not worth money  Bad drinks equally bad overpriced food  pay roll bland possibly worst ever had  made $35 roll taste even worse  mongolian beef better P F Changs Service good  Decor very nice  takes alot  say things any place  Good luck  <EOR> I came back when social house now Khotan  tell night day  don't mean good way  While decor hasn't really changed much  menu sure better  experience while being social house wonderful  figured regardless name changing I'd give shot  Boy wrong  mentioned before decor still unique  Dim sheik very Asian course  But wait use dj lounge area  Gone figure  waitresses remember lot nicer  Anyway  ordered few sushi pieces some chicken kabobs  believe salad  few beers  Sushi very Mediocre  Chicken dry  Salad salad  Can't really remember anything memorable meal  Aside overpriced food  big disappointment  doubt coming again  Only reason even giving place 2 stars because once social house  Anyway if over priced wanna asian food your gig  Along half ass service  guest  <EOR> Mediocre food  50$ person  could better food Panda Express  orange peel chicken cold lacking flavor  veggies dish tasted weren't washed before being cooked  Only good thing place atmosphere only reason didn't give 1 star  <EOR> My girlfriend stayed TI looking easy dinner night decided stroll into Khotan   Meh     I wouldn't say food bad but wasn't good   think best word describe would be amateurish   would hard believe real sushi chefs kitchen used high quality fish   Some fish didn't taste anything!  No taste!  The service pretty good but waiter didn't seem know much fish   Don't waste your money Jalepeno Hamachi appetizer   don't know anyone could nerve charge $22 5 tiny pieces low grade Hamachi if even Hamachi chip   Tuna Tartare wasn't great either     better hors d'oeuvres weddings   The concept Salmon Parmesan roll sounded good but when eating Parmesan didn't sense   mood noodles also ordered Crab Lo Mein   basically ramen noodles few pieces tasteless crab top   could've made ramen noodles topped imitation crab $2 would just good better $14 dish  <EOR> Khotan Closed Senor Froggy resturant  <EOR> I'll echo others said   service poor   $6 million upfit gorgeous   food good but spectacular atmosphere   Lots potential front back house  <EOR> A Superficial place Treasure Island trying hard upscale however food quality does meet its price tag which way overly priced   Fast food quality price higher TAO figure  Staff also try hard gets annoying  No wonder business good all  TI upscale place visit either    <EOR> Much MUCH better Social House   hell TI thinking?  SH more Japanese influenced would say Khotan more Chinese influenced Japanese pricetag     Grub *Jalapeno Hamachi buttery fresh used soy overpowered liked battered jalapeno slices great texture $22 *Rainbow Roll snow crab fish fresh $18 *Broccoli Beef liked Broccoli Rabe aspect beef eh $24 *Gai Lan cooked nicely greasy $6 *Crab Lo Mein Alfredo really strange powdered packet Hamburger Helper but oddly comforting $14  This place pretty pathetic but serve mean cocktail boast great alfresco dining option  <EOR> Only 4 stars because expense  without $55 Groupon meal two including large house sake would over $100   However even if hadn't Groupon would WELL worth money  find!! decor gorgeous waited two attentive garcons sat sushi bar chatted sushi chefs well menu extremely creative and  most importantly  DELICIOUS    Our waiter recommended yellowtail appetizer tempura jalepenos light yummy sauce WOW he right  both mm'd through whole meal starting right tasty beginning    Every piece sushi we large maki dinner received 20 pieces sushi fresh generous absolutely fantastic    By time finished large dinner order almost full but definitely ready stop eating! each ordered another round nigiri  my boyfriend tuna salmon YUM!
