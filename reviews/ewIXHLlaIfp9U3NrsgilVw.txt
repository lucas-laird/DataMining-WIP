My girlfriend where going firefly which same parking lot    firefly booked tables way crowed inside thought maybe marrakech instead    no bunch times plus  lot food eat being hungry let's try Yolis place! see menu posted outside some things order sound good  walk stairs restaurant inside  First thing see crazy lighting everything NEON green    Maybe cool looking bar perhaps but restaurant dunno why anyone would think good idea    We seated     here's where really strange  Before ordered food three people come table no idea waiter was  brought bottled water without asking  Someone came over table said hi water someone asked drink order then someone else entree order    So last person ask waiter? see menu? 'Oh want menu? don't want firepit? friend What's that?   manager owner comes over he talking really enthusiastically car salesmen   telling order firepit which 5 6 different kinds meat etc etc       My friend Sounds neat guys menus though?  Oh menus why want when am telling best thing order   Ummm well we'd just see else is?   Tells waiter menu    heck right? So he leaves second friends leave stupidly say No we're already already ordered drinks    Regret So stay     After even few minutes looking menu owner waiter come back over start telling more firepit Brazilian thing try etc etc    I said just wanted lamb pita   A pita!!??
