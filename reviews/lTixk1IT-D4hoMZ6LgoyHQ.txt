Daniel said he didn't offer dessert since rush  Really? don't even sing happy birthday birthday girl?  Once bill finally comes notice $35 corkage fee bill  inquire since Daniel told champagne would waive fee  He then gets defensive replies said if FEW bottles champagne would waive fee  just bottle  tell upset since he told otherwise ask manager   The manager Paul tells impossible Daniel said since he does power waive corkage fee because  just way things  few problems this  why heck would Daniel even such offer when he doesn't power so  Two why wouldn't exception made since promised? Three given free bottle wine  service pouring wine consisted fee  literally no cost restaurant!   We then decide would take fee Daniel's tip since he clearly didn't deserve lying refusing take responsibility words  Paul poor management skills inability thirteen customers happy also didn't help  didn't want leave tip all  Paul then threw two cents states gratuity listed menu required pay since party greater six  Therefore terrible service unhappy birthday girl 12 other angry customers forced pay tip $1400 bill  Seriously $35 nothing especially split 13 people but when lied tricked into buying bottle champagne  Then Paul steps says he try happy  Yet $35 corkage fee still sneakily placed bill  Still refusing tip exhausting terrible restaurant experience calculate bill without tip ask waiter charge cards accordingly  He then pulls card random tells owner card he charge hundreds extra rest group  Daniel wanted tip took however he could!

but flavors great   The lower points included having reservation 10 30am yes early lunch but friend airport right place just such amazing reviews thought it'd nice place last meal   Now reservation Opentable but own website says open 8am yelp says open 8am opentable gave 10 30 reservation  show right time but don't actually open til 11  apologetic trying things going faster but still nice place Vegas used getting least little something being inconvenienced   offer drink app table would won them extra star but alas   And end meal drinks long empty given check     still no refills    only 9 tables place little more attentive service would nice might bumped 4 stars too   I probably back didn't try mac cheese ! but won't top list impressing town guest   Decor excellent though nice ambiance if table  <EOR> I think place great deal delicious food isn't insanely expensive Vegas  bill came around $150 2 people which really isn't bad compared other gourmet cuisine vegas  Although admit delicious but favorite food   Firstly tell breads you're eating which made really happy say all good  specific BACON BREAD raisins good mention parmesan bread baguette also really fresh    To start ordered Lobster Macaroni French Onion Soup  Both good but outstanding  better macaroni Where food stood entrees  duck confit delicious scallops! scallops really fresh   I would definitely back just avoid ordering mediocre appetizers  service impeccable perhaps because thursday night   <EOR> Meh price better steakhouses Vegas  Sure off grid tucked away but still same thing you'd expect any other chophouse   Our waiter didn't really give damn  last tables night other trying upsell he didn't much effort show any sort hospitality  <EOR> A great way having fabulous meal wonderful service while feeling gone back time   Goodness knows many backroom deals gone over perfect steak but place practically speaks it! best cocktails start meal much better all pompous overpriced crap find strip  Yes when show wonder why hell run down hotel but seconds later once restaurant just won't matter  Hopefully real estate never becomes valuable closes some mega resort  now support wonderful old Vegas restaurant!
