Polite staff! Called week place detailed order 12 employees pick ready 10 minutes all orders spot on!! <EOR> They use deliver but time lady said wrong side Washburn literally across street delivery range   wont back establishment  far worst jimmie johns <EOR> GOOD This place FAST   I mean really fast    If want grab sandwich want sit down grab quick bite  current spot good sandwich lunch    The service friendly never experienced scorned casual past reviewers experienced   and plenty times base review good service each times here   Tables decor clean modern   not much wear n tear some sandwich shops Ive in     BAD Would've given 5 star place but came time month    it smelled somebody used dirty mop floor   blame lazy employee business whole time occurence   Other that   kudos JJ's team always greeting smile having  great sandwich made fresh belly!! <EOR> My girlfriend location last night first time last time unfortunately  sandwiches ordered just tasted plain  No flavor all  If would've known product would would've just made sandwiches house! saw nothing stood fact payed 18 bucks 2 sandwiches weren't good really sucked  sure problem but if rest menu tastes then would recommend place no one  Maybe just sandwich something  Maybe try something else menu before COMPLETELY writing guys off  Maybe   But now good  <EOR> When placed first opened great  But now EVEYTIME order sandwich wrong! I usally vegetarian sandwich  No mayo mustard cut half  Got sandwich cut half  Really huge deal but all lettuce tamatoe avocado spread  THATS IT! Should cucumber mustard  This happened many times  back again  <EOR> Great place eat love sandwiches folks great service always great really clean rest rooms store awesome <EOR> I'm actually kind surprised see comments poor service here   We stopped week ago service spectacular   Maybe some turn around since negative comments maybe just caught everyone good day     I love Jimmy John's but don't eat very often   Lack opportunity suppose   Last week mood something DIFFERENT   No more McDonalds no more Del Taco please god no more tacos minute    my husband says Isn't Jimmy John's somewhere around here? pulled trusty Yelp app found location mere 6 minutes where were   We usuals Bootlegger oregano Gargantuan husband    We also applied 5% off Yelp check in   which actually pretty comical   took 4 people looking offer figure it   Apparently its new people don't really take advantage often   nice though tried say really wasn't big deal but persisted     Everyone spoke very nice     The food great   love JJ's bread much more other sandwich places    I would liked little extra mayo sandwich but  just being nitpicky     We definitely come back again  <EOR> Jimmy John's quick making sandwich if getting something lunch time crunch stop by  menu simple veggies fresh  Bread super soft customer service good  No issues Jimmy John's location  <EOR> I remember being young modest college student back Midwest friend worked Jimmy John's would give free sandwiches  sandwich isn't enough fill I'd pay another one   I normally Bootlegger turkey roast beef Hunter's Club roast beef   When trying eat less bread I'd Un Wich instead getting bread your sandwich wrapped lettuce   usually hate mayo but some reason don't mind JJ sandwich   I'd still JJ sandwich once year just reminisce good ol' days  But sad part location they're big customer service all  They're pretty rude mess your order  other locations Vegas better service compared place  <EOR> This place fast! They're just would want sandwich spot  Many options toppings protein  take orders quickness deliver! only tip They're  usually little light spreads ask extra  <EOR> The food ok  Bread little hard but biggest problem lack attention  mislabeled two sandwiches when dad dropped son off finished carrying luggage he took off labeled #7 wrong one  now he's 30 minutes away neither food ordered  also didn't cut pickle offered   Little things maybe but only customers  Just pay attention you're doing  Being fast useless if can't correct  <EOR> been couple times now enjoyed sandwiches every time  really tell ingredients fresh  also appreciate quickness sandwiches made but wish bit less push time order always feel barely tomato removed before sandwich complete! Seems trivial doesn't stop coming back just don't feeling rushed spit all breath all <EOR> Jimmy Johns serve sandwiches good prices  them really fast  In seconds? just think little boring hence getting 5 stars me  subway customize sandwich your liking while more pick want hopefully good  sure could told them put extra stuff but only second time wasn't sure system worked didn't want difficult customer during lunch rush hour    Good sandwiches money though   Yum! <EOR>
