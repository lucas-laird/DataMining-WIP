Ingredients all fresh quality pickings  gad lunch special made fresh  Wow greatest tasting cheese pizza! Going back beef goulash haunting since saw menu! <EOR> I've twice now Hungarian dishes had chicken paprikash both times also tried beef goulash second time   first time blown away flavorful paprikash well handmade egg noodles soaked sauce also enjoyed cucumber salad comes it! second go round nowhere near flavorful    maybe because nowhere near much actual sauce it  goulash nice flavor but also barely any sauce light smattering sauce where TON should be    goulash usually pretty stew y! beef tougher dryer should been  if anything food inconsistent but first time good definitely back again see if level goodness replicated!  The place actually billed Italian pizza joint but can't really vouch any since purpose Hungarian offerings  Judit herself very nice does best feel home while wait your food hole in the wall place  If order to go she packages everything securely doesn't skimp amount food your order all  Both paprikash goulash ridiculous amounts food! <EOR>
