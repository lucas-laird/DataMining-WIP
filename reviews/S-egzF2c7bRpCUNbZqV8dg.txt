YIPPPPPPPEEEEEEEE!! Seriously bacon jam giving LIFE day!    While wanted try lot more didn't any more room  gives good reason back   Hopefully Raphael able take care again  couldn't leave without buying some bacon jam take home   Warning if flying sure package your bacon jam very well   wrapped paper but warms oil seeps jar   lucky another ziplock bag luggage could use catch seeping oil   Otherwise poor purse would become pricey dog magnet  Talk All bitches love me! Oh no no! bacon jam delicious  tiny bit some eggs nice rib eye even top turkey burger  can't wrong  why torture yourself splurge 8oz jar!  won't regret it  know love it     Having leave place difficult  Raphael even shared some Belly Beast burger  HUGE!

The hostess help really seem attend customers there's also cozy relaxing ambiance place   early morning weekday wasn't lot people but cafe's high quality service deserves attract more attention   Its location little difficult see if aren't looking corner area across movie theater Havana Cuba restaurant huge Eastern Pebble plaza  check yourself if your palate craving something better just your ordinary breakfast brunch eatery! <EOR> I going short point  far friendliest place dined everyone takes time ask your food all love chit chat  service food taste quality 5 stars  Such friendly relaxing atmosphere noticed lot people just hanging enjoying  <EOR> The food OK but spectacular  allow substitutions  don't open before 8 00 am which means no early breakfast before work  location convenient  people friendly  <EOR> Sometimes hard recapture magic    Noticing Truffles N' Bacon relocated short distance away house  very excited dive into some brunch goodness  Sadly did happen but did happen mac n' cheese covered burger bacon jam   shabby    My experience wasn't best  menu pretty bare only lunch items available if wanted breakfast ask server then ask owner then come over try recollect breakfast menu memory  Hence why TNB burger which way also isn't menu  old Yelp profile page pointed picture said    TNB pretty good  burger cooked perfect mac n' cheese abundance bun super soft but wanted more bacon jam  What's point adding burger small amounts  rain bacon jam!  Sinful Tots  Bacon Jam truffle oil carbs what's love?

More olive oil reminiscence fake truffle extract   No mixing no presentation  Just thrown bowl  regret eating write    To even order appetizer wait 6 minutes someone approach table  fact server touched other tables sat down party did  When appetizer came ask twice place setting because wasn't given one  When need refills coffee water server take cups away table  pitcher dispenser system would probably help servers making unnecessary trips  still trying understand why servers discombobulated  don't even handle checks  wonder if team system would work better  There's 22 tables max if separate two tops three servers  mean there's 4 chairs bar but there's even busser older lady does side work  still trying figure out    I won't even into entree  even worth energy  But hey least free refills coffee  <EOR> My grandmother decided breakfast yesterday hearing place friend  generally bit crowded right when walk isn't much space stand wait seated sign says especially if multiple people walk in  also jewelry display right when walk which bit odd  However walked waited 5 minutes seated being told hold least 3 different staff members before finally being seated  Now seated menus taking time through them haven't before  kid when say sitting table least 10 15 minutes without even greeting waitress anything  Mind tending all tables surrounding BUT ours  flag someone down service did apologize noticing but being am someone works way busier high volume restaurant 3x size little breakfast place highly unamused  Now far menu plenty great options sounded good  grandmother decided split chicken waffles  Might add charge $2 split plate which just annoying never really seen before but still did sake convenience  Another thing didn't fact don't soda tap  serve cans glass ice $1 75 per also rip off  Anyways food came quick good would say but nearly impossible ahold server again  call ask 2 glasses water forgotten she just left sitting another 15 min finished small portions  literally looking around trying figure if front pay works since nobody helping us  Finally ask another person check  check came server still failed mention take your check front pay which also very stupid explain why  point having front pay when only two cash registers again no space stand?! am waiting even longer line other people trying pay also mix people placing orders  All all place very unorganized extremely slow service food isn't good enough come back deal again  Hard pass  <EOR> This first bad review Yelp but customer service received today terrible because specific waitress felt need leave this  excited try restaurant which experience even more upsetting  arrived seated very quickly very nice older women shoulder length hair cut then waitress wish name she blonde hair glasses tattoo arm she's confused another older women blonde hair waitress anyways she came take drink order wasn't ready yet just looking menu she seemed become very impatient said ice tea? just decided order water  last interaction her  sat 20 whole minutes she did come back table single time  even made eye contact 3 times  She kept walking around restaurant back she even checked table next us! She walked directly next table twice honestly felt she purposely ignoring us  finally looked she coming table then she decides help someone counter instead take order  Very upsetting  First time ever walked restaurant  fed she counter found manager told happened restaurant but horrible waitress  gave $5 drinks time  She tried stay but told sorry we're just going leave   That ONLY reason gave place two stars because lady seated which spoke before leaving food did look good  really wanted try but just put off service just did want anymore  <EOR> Food amazing!!!
