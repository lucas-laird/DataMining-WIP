There moderate line when visited weekday evening around 6pm   Waiting time 15 20 minutes   restaurant basically just large permanently sectioned off area off lobby rather discrete enclosed restaurant   gives very open airy feeling   But if you're sitting near edge you'll basically right next people walking through lobby   Our server very surly demeanor initially I think she meant part charm maybe though she warmed bit evening progressed   number very good specials late night dining see photo but during wee hours     We tried spicy wings start which basic but definitely very spicy   bad   Then schnitzel   meat itself quite good juicy light crispy coating but doused very heavy sauce which wasn't expecting based description menu   should've asked side   bad   dessert tried blueberry pie which quite good   Lots blueberries very tasty crust     So overall perfectly decent meal nothing particularly good bad it   If you're hungry 2 00am stroll through Southpoint though might find Coronado Cafe welcome respite  <EOR> What GOING 3 5 stars here??  Tried more once seemed worse each time   All servers said Oohh Chinese food GREAT!  authentic gotta try some! skeptical 1 because name duh! 2 because first AND SECOND meal garbage!  Sadly didn't learn     We reasoned since American food ordered days before bad perhaps cooks Chinese know better?  WRONG!

Long story short place unnecessary long wait mediocre food bad service  <EOR> The Coronado cafe located inside South Point casino   Years ago mediocre cafe such would norm town Vegas but culinary winds changed lower quality food cooking methods disgrace hotel eating   food schlock house quality best nothing write home about    I pasta most horrendous dishes quite some time insult Italian food sauce tasted ketchup   Once again better stick slots avoid place altogether  casino needs borrow some moves competition celebrity chef onboard ASAP  <EOR> I only tried breakfast decent however portions seemed small me   no free refills other coffee   price slightly above Denny's instance but much  It bad but just great either  For remainder stay elsewhere  <EOR> The food just okay    The $4 steak eggs midnight 6am wonderful thing though  best steak ever but when you're hungry middle night place be    By time midnight all locals already line waiting take advantage food cheap price    The turkey avocado wrap extremely dry  tried few times hoping it'd better thinking previous times lighter off day but nope dry each time    The service isn't best though  really slow most time waiter waitress look want off work already  <EOR> 4 morning craving steak egg meal?

The show afterward great too! <EOR> I Seafood Creole which special $7 95 Friday July   surprised good was!  tasted very fresh generous seafood   decent cafe high list priorities definitely going back  <EOR> Very good      go prime rib      graveyard shift specials  midnight 6 am <EOR> It convenient open  Located casino area place easy access food while gambling floor  There's nothing spectacular food prices  staff friendly which always plus but nothing else rave about    If want convenient reasonable ok find  Now if you're night hawk really early riser try graveyard special 12am 6am   Again nothing spectacular but steak eggs $5? Can't that   lol <EOR> very solid CONSISTENT good breakfast food  also cheap  havent tried them anything other breakfast cant comment other stuff is  far service food good no complaints <EOR> There's probably better places faster service steaks ordered medium which actually well done    The upsides graveyard prices close proximity    Or just really bad night  <EOR> Service * * * * * Food * * * Counter service available  This humble dining room sets standard good service  awestruck great attitude work ethic skill amazing servers  manage cheerful top all work beyond me  restaurant must world class manager assemble such great team  They've forgotten more good service most culinary employees ever know   The high point clear used dishes without making sound! No passive aggressive busboys slamming dishes into tub   servers bus own tables clearly diner comfort top priority    I wish could say food better but wasn't bad   Among three critics thumbs two thumbs sideways    My Ruben sandwich pretty good except soggy   guess slopped sauerkraut without draining it   When picked potato salad hunch wouldn't good right  Potato salad seems great challenge most eateries  The dab sampled Jerry's Famous exception  pickle just ordinary restaurant supply    Another critic spaghetti meat sauce which he described pretty bland  came garlic toast more French toast he said   Our third critic beef broccoli Chinese menu   She very happy saying The broccoli just right  tried sample but didn't care it  wasn't even good Panda   vote moved food rating three stars   Judging steady stream customers including families kids would say food must good enough   It's spacious well lighted restaurant  guess new smoking laws smoke free   Ventilation good enough don't suffer fumes drifting over casino   I'm frequenter casinos could wrong but South Point seemed packed Monday evening  neighborhood casinos usually busy?    South Point offers some very good people watching  crowd seemed more diverse interesting  tasteful selection sizes shapes ages physiques ethnicities stereotypes   There quite racket stun tunes slots but isn't unbearable Red Rock  <EOR> This definitely spot locals  Located off strip would say 4 stars only because midnight specials  place when want cheap meal during late nights going crazy around night life Vegas  many times different thoughts  last night great experience  waiter really nice outgoing knew gonna tip start  love friendly people! But place hit miss because times where service sucked food off but majority time still worth coming  Tonight another good experience  waiter nice straight point  food fast  No complaints here  recommend steggs steak eggs midnight  Steak hash browns eggs toast $4 95  shabby spending all you've Strip somethin  4 5 price quality pay  Open 24 hours  Oh also brownie sundae which delicious cereal which both more pricey side  But coming definitely stick late night specials  Always place I'd recommend! <EOR> The place lost its glory late night meal   they famous specials day night     no more quality significant drop    all plates food if came freezer  Served cold  new rule menu limit special late night meal per person  ration food????  definitely leave hungry  This Vegas used call hospitality its name     suggest elsewhere  Better ihop Denny's Big disappointment south point hotel <EOR> came late night 12am dont lure long line outside doesnt mean food good means service f**king slow  food terrible no taste! yuck! prices cheap but u wat u deserve  shitty food  didnt even eat half wat ordered maybe obly 25% wats plate   thats terrible was  im local first time eating but wil never ever back  waitress served food cold already also  terrible restaurant beware! <EOR> Came 12 20 14 ordered chicken fried steak meal    Well chicken fried steak chicken fried steak beef    food no flavor but give nice size proportion  if taste important then enjoy place <EOR> The only reason why giving place 4 stars because Graveyard menu    $3 95 Steak Eggs $1 95 Biscuits gravy!  This best kept secret awesome break your tables return fun night strip dine your hotel even take your room   PS does run bit slow gets crowded but service great!   It's 12 6 am 21 older only    The food well worth especially cause hubby able take back rooms! <EOR> Not bad place food specials under $4  Service horrendous very busy high volume folks lining good steggs clubbing hours  <EOR> When Yelp says 1 star Eek! Methinks not  nothing comes close except experience Coronado Cafe   When rate 1 star pretty much guarantees won't returning establishment any reason  Here's why   1  Service nonexistent   Servers little no personality even any experience serve first place   Beverages remained unfilled food orders accurate based server's errors word atrocious  best describes service provided here   2  Prices low but bad service food quality doesn't really any props anything   3   Food items bland but paying $3 guess paid for   rather pay $7 same stuff prepared correctly service actually mattered   Overall probably worst dining experiences ever had   going back  <EOR> Servers friendly but little slow  family enjoyed meal! Definitely would back if area again  Planning check late night menu tonight! Nice clean environment  <EOR>
