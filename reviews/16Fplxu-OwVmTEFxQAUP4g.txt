I later found could find menu prices through Google search but prices listed already date  Fine dining offerings Luxor limited only Tender Steak Seafood  Given shortcomings experienced might explain why holiday evening restaurant almost empty diners    For next steak dinner Las Vegas take beautiful wife Ruth's Chris Steak House Harrah's  Yes prices same but restaurant more straightforward listing them food quality probably slightly better little doubt service far superior  <EOR> My man gave Wagyu Flat Iron Steak 4 8 rounded off 5    easy Great Job Tender!

When Vegas must try  <EOR> I completely agree Harry S 's  review!  Ridiculous!!  Please some training servers!   Whenever steak always bring own bottle wine when made reservation asked corkage fee would perfectly fine paying it  When sat first thing waiter says know you're going pay open right?!    um heck???????? Obviously! nice steak house kind service? Give break! felt very offended condescending demeanor disrespect! server knew nothing steaks fine service matter! He could see annoyed essentially said bare minimum rest evening    His original comment totally set stage actual dinner cuts meat where all ok perhaps just annoyed greeting everything just seemed blah  wife's filet mignon overcooked ribeye actually very tasty but best had    The highlight evening dessert  Wow! Banana foster plus bread pudding banana rum sauce made absolutely amazing delicious banana bread pudding experience! Absolutely best    When visit steak house any type better dining establishment expect certain level service complement your experience unfortunately restaurant completely failed  <EOR> Spent $140 mediocre meal   steak done right very tough outside   Service so so   better steaks Texas Roadhouse  <EOR> Stayed Luxor over weekend decided nice dinner last night Vegas before going strip  Scottish salmon friend filet  better salmon half price!! friend agreed also  tried filet pretty dry  heirloom tomato w mozzarella appetizer great if love tomatoes  wanted just ok expensive meals treated ourselves grandma's chocolate cake dessert  absolutely delicious!! would 100% content just dessert instead  Other service pretty good  <EOR> I'm sorry but if steak you're Vegas don't beef angus filet mignon medium rare Tender Luxor don't Raul your server feel sorry you  <EOR> This'd place real good  service right there  Very helpful  port house pretty good could little thick  don't think true weight  Kobe A5 grade filet  just outstanding  worth it  Don't afraid spend yourself  won't disappointed  <EOR> This could easily 5 star review but horrible music piped excessive volume ruined it   Everyone party 4 agreed we'd back heartbeat if music   spoke manager let know also informed great wait staff agreed if any music playing should classics low volume   Amazing food truly fantastic everyone   loved bison sampler game based deli meats appetizer   wasn't single thing soup salad starters gorgeous deserts wouldn't pay again but none willing shitty cheesy music going background   really hope listen us   no big spender but would drop another 500+ dinner four if ambience fixed    When back plan walk check if hear crappy sappy pseudo pop we'll take money elsewhere  It's really shame because food service fantastic!  <EOR> Service so so some people better others   thanks yelp expected this   Hubs buffalo ribeye flavorless needed seasoned salt maybe free range ribeye 4 stars sides good but side Mushrooms   UH MAZE ZING! apps big eye tuna cheese board pretty good  <EOR> I really enjoyed experience here  other reviewers said typical steakhouse  But pretty good!

Select another restaurant another steakhouse  This top steakhouse but commanding $$$$ if caliber  Should received warm steak? Should required wait steak knife being serve steak? Should need find waiter ground pepper? Should need remove pieces muscle tendons cannot chewed? Should need grilled twice issues manager? Should quality steak high level would need return it? Should need find waiter request coffee?  I cannot return here  There other ways lose money casino  <EOR> I must say extremely impressed only food ambiance but most importantly service   John truly amazing made experience much better   All recommendations spot on   should say John's co waiter equally amazing but unfortunately cannot recall name    Kudos John staff!

So    ask horseradish both creamy took another 10 minutes receive  waiter also rolled eye fiancé when asking    Dinner so so  telling mashed potatoes only thing worth waiting for    So another thing ticked off upon calling reservation mentioned fiancé birthday  Which really birthday falls New Year's Eve expecting least decent experience  Jeez remind waiter birthday rudely taken upon wasn't surprise anymore  Which back head just annoyed because KNOW told host helped phone birthday celebration    So blah blah bring trio dessert okay  Creme brûlée brownie muffin thing another pastry  whatever  just wanted now    So try salvage night waiter mentions don't forget give your Mlife card points did  only find 2 weeks later points didn't even post account  REALLY?

Period  No debate  very reasonably priced $115 8 ounces needs no garnish sauce stands alone  good last trip ate Tender two nights row Wagyu filet both nights  Folks kind steak tender almost loses its shape! literally starts spread plate since marbling fat spider webbing  cut fork  no joke  can't stress enough if you're steak lover try least once  Although consider yourself warned   you hooked! Note Wagyu Ribeye 10oz $135 As service Tender Tom server all but two visits  He's extremely knowledgeable efficient super nice person  He's great wine pairings always smile face  If rating Tender steak Tom would five stars!

 also think Las Vegas Strip restaurant Tender great value!  didn't say cheap but good value   almost always some sort comp discount when there   am typically paying full price  Which more comparable Steakhouse home   But admit slipping bit   need some things game   disappointing no longer using Prime Beef   Any really great Steakhouse starts that   think some corporate bean counting accountant MGM Resorts made decision try restaurant more profitable   don't think really justify Las Vegas Steakhouse prices without it   hurt them long term if don't start offering some Prime options   know used some options Snake River Farms years ago should bring them back!!  last 2 trips couple pretty tough Steaks wasn't prepared   just cut meat wasn't really good quality   think stick Wild Game especially Buffalo Ribeye going forward until fix this!  also tend rotate desserts some specials   made some changes think may just bringing desserts now instead making them house  also huge let down   past great Souffle's used best Strawberry Shortcake!!!  all homemade made house   Now think mainly just order Cheesecake Ice Cream Creme Brulee which pretty boring today's standards probably even made there   Don't wrong Tender still good just great once was   But if $100 comps use Luxor still best place use them!! <EOR> TENDER steak seafood looks old school steakhouse its dark leather chairs hazel floors its burnished umber surroundings  But restaurant Luxor also plays its own rules offering diners chance sample meats bison venison boar   My first visit late night one  main restaurant slowly closing night but bar lounge still open  ordered selection cheeses charcuterie board included wild boar sausage duck ham antelope pastrami  Those quick bites hit spot along selection Belgian ales led decision visit second time       Unfortunately trip number two bit disappointment    First good  appetizer sampled astounding  short rib ravioli cooked perfection served horseradish marinara sauce bit crisped smoked bacon  would highly recommend it   Having dabbled game meats last time ordered wild game tasting main  feeling adventurous imagined if good enough menu alongside Omaha beef Kurobuta pork chops knew doing  tasting included three meats but sadly each tougher bit more disheartening last one    I need stress wasn't first encounter wild game  typically eaten bit bites most often sausage cured served tartare style did first visit TENDER  know meats quite tough if cooked less perfectly which why they're often served charcuterie items  full flavor without having gnaw through meat would better used Lady Gaga Grammy dress   The wild boar loin best lot did echo restaurant's name but venison medallion served alongside bit dense  Venison tends drier beef because lacks same kind fat marbling its meat cut cooked just bit long liking  Next   The Nilgai antelope osso buco even more vexing  perfect osso buco cooked low slow falls off bone  simply unyielding  fair never cooked antelope myself much less osso buco but understanding process very similar veal version meat should cooked slowly until fork tender  case night most meat plate remained uneaten   It's truly unfortunate because dish priced $36 which unreasonable  low enough where might willing gamble amount new foodie experience  Vegas all  fair price exotic meats  included tasting  But definitely representative could would hate think someone might enticed try them as was leave wrong impression Vegas ate antelope! wasn't good  dry tough  probably just gimmick but scratch off bucket list  am however ready condemn TENDER completely might try regular steak some day just see if they've chops handle chops  did really side ordered sampler  trio exotic grains included quinoa corn pilaf farro piccolo black forbidden rice    I am also fond cheeses available typically served fresh baguette honeycomb dates quince paste cherry fig chutney  would suggest cabernet sauvignon soaked Purple Moon Cheddar California's San Joaquin Valley nutty Marieke gouda Wisconsin butter like San Andreas sheep's milk cheese Valley Ford California if they're ever menu  <EOR> The atmosphere restaurant great  Comfortable spacious enough feel top other tables dining  However waitress took drink then food orders both times come back verify orders   usually 10 min later  When she came back verify food order she 100% wrong  Good thing she came back verify!! never checked once food delivered ask another staff member special request  Because idea restaurant expected small portions big prices  sea bass way over done extremely dry  bison steak cold  Cocktails delicious  would back place account poorly cooked food poor service  <EOR> Entrees very good  Sides ok exotic mushrooms very good  salad looked came right boxed salad grocery store along little pieces rotten lettuce  wine selection wasn't anything special  Service okay  stayed Luxor 6 times eaten every place Luxor except Tender until trip  many great places eat would probably somewhere else  <EOR> Semi awesome little steak restaurant inside Luxor decor very Frank Sinatra ish   Service OK food good but definitely find better place same amount price pay bigger portion  <EOR> Beautiful place  But service food only worth half price  Purchased bottle wine  Gave wrong year opened poured disappeared!

Cela dit la viande était bonne sauf le lamb shank un peu décevant   Dommage que le service ne soit vraiment pas à la hauteur les plats qui arrivent trop tôts le vin qui n'est pas resservi l'eau généreusement renversée sur la table l'addition qui arrive sans proposer de desserts les assiettes enlevées de table alors qu'on continuait à manger etc       C'est le choix des vins et la qualité des viandes qui font que la note finale est de 4 mais j'ai longuement hésité avec un 3    <EOR> My wife sister visited Tender two weeks ago   used free redemption MyVegas game $150    decor very manly man sort cigar oak room which awesome   steaks came perfect!
