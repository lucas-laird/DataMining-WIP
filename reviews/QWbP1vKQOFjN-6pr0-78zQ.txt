Generally place pretty good depending cooking made salsa lately red salsa perfect reminded old famous Mexican joint called El Cholo's years ago town  Service also excellent everytime which usually night  need back original taquitos when opened though thinner cheaper product but its still ok  <EOR> I would never eat place ever again !! family 6 and self came order whole bunch food  waiting food 2 year's old daughter use bathroom   she's sit toilet cockroach came behind seat  top  toilet looked dried blood side   only imagine what's going kitchen  Please DON'T eat   place disgusting! Some call health department tell how!! <EOR> This new favorite Mexican restaurant  well worth drive even though least 10 Mexican restaurants within 2 mile radius house including another Don Tortaco's block house  First off branch people actually listens understands instructions English most them also speaks English fluently especially girl cash register usually duty night  multiple Mexican places because eat lot odd hours aren't much choices late night only few them actually cooks carne asada well done even Spanish translations etc    Most time don't bother cooking half cooked carne asada before put bun overcook burned  place knows right past month almost every night  The carne asada also tastes actually marinated unlike other places where meat tastes just plain meat  The horchata also really good  very creamy sweet watered down most places  first time wanting ice cream which also freezer desert but tasting horchata forgot ice cream  Refills also free  My husband also likes burritos sometimes he likes all vegetarian he specify add only ingredients he likes  Customer service good place also clean really nice tile tables decor added good food done right drive farther now when craving favorite carne asada torta horchata  <EOR> Walking you'll see great beautiful decor! Everything really nice all 4 corners building  But food wasn't great  wasn't anything different any mexican stop except thing  ordered beef steak special carne asada fries  beef EXTREMELY dry chewy hard  couldn't even cut into small pieces ask cook chop us  carne asada okay its smaller portion usually other mexican restaurants but could do  Its quiet no TV going even though theres 2 wall no radio  if you're going when you're hungry care you're going eat good luck!! <EOR> We live mile away place just recently discovered carne asada tacos pretty good   taco loving family Don Tortaco exactly want pinch moment when craving good tacos but want avoid ff chains restaurants   Each tacos filled LARGE heaping meat no skimping here   fully loaded tacos corn tortillas favorite   crunchy shells bit fried crunchy but husband likes them   prefer carne asada over chicken but still eat them both   house hot sauce delish!  rice delish!
