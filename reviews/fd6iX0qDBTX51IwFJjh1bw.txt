3PM Cafe located across street UNLV  usually if study thirst Starbucks Coffee Bean Jamba Juice can't satisfied  Chinatown quite drive away university  They offer variety teas almond green black black mango thai etc    boba good place clean cute  service really friendly! Chinatown does better boba but no other good boba place around university   Plus stamp card 10 teas free which service most places around UNLV don't like Starbucks Coffee Bean Jamba Juice  I never tired food just  continue boba tea  PS I read another reviewer stating place didn't boba  couple times every time boba  <EOR> Finally cafe prepares real food worth waiting for! Don't expect your ready made menu items include chips macaroni salad  appreciate real food takes preparation thought  cafe does nice twist Taiwanese inspired entrees specialty selected menu items    Love Almond Milk Tea!

Pork Belly rice daily special Wow seriously blandest pork belly ever had  Waste could bacon  sure if suppose taste nothing but tasted like    nothing  Even chunks pork belly which fat any flavor it   Curry Rice w Chicken Katsu chicken pretty decent  Dark meat nice crunchy crust even seasoned chicken little salt  rest meh  Potato salad halfway cooked containing bits still raw potato hunks  Curry Golden brand brick instant curry shortage stuff? When nuclear reactor blew did take curry brick factory? When think Katsu Curry you're expecting bowl just all curry sauce island rice few strips fried chicken slightly submerged curry  Nope exact opposite here  Mountains rice just light mist curry   Expensive too  WAY expensive  When your target market college students your strategy should cheap plentiful keep coming back  3pm Cafe neither cheap nor very plentiful  <EOR> We stopped lunch Saturday  Nice looking place friendly staff  good selection snacks entrees drinks befitting teahouse  ordered some milk teas minced pork bowl beef spaghetti   The milk teas good  green milk tea coffee milk tea  green milk tea okay  coffee milk tea bit sweet taste   Although exorbitant $7 minced pork bowl felt bit much arrived table  tasted fairly good but basically just bowl rice some chopped pork it  Suggestion toss nominal fried egg top provide some furikake shredded dried pork sung I'd happy camper  beef spaghetti felt more worth its price  Definitely tasty   Overall definitely nice place grab drink bite but plenty places all around somewhat similar fare some lower prices sure we'll back  <EOR> It's ikea chic  Walls dark cave but there's just enough natural light  originally going Tea Time Café but deal must fallen through  shame  no Tea Time    Although everyone nice knowledgeable drinks  very good explaining difference between similarly named ones  lover stuck old reliables taro milk tea boba black tea  choking down powder first sip shook stirred taro milk tea good two minutes should been  least boba good but looking reviews doesn't always seem case  black tea WAY SWEET  heard things sweet but bad  drinking syrup   I usually look past lower health grade if restaurant good  But C place long way go  <EOR> WHO UNLV students alumni people just around area craving drank boba!
