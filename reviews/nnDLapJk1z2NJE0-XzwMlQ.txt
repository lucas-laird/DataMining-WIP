Possibly  Note future diners if large party DON'T LET THEM PUT SEMI PRIVATE ROOM   <EOR> The Gallagher's Steakhouse great food great   Filet Mignon Lobster  <EOR> We visited last night November 25th   The good The decor really nice festive but over the top wasn't distracting  can't say much modern NYC but very similar many older lovely San Francisco establishments  aged steak very good worth money  However does come bone fatty portions if bothers please just order filet  very similar price find no making those preferences  enjoy un aged filet much more aged new york strip   The asparagus excellent often overcooked   The roasted garlic steak nice touch   The medium The salads good size but faux fine dining tradition diner wrestle enormous leaves hunks lettuce  Perhaps your taste but actually wanted finish salad being served whole leaves copious dressing unfortunate  ordered Caesar dressing nice but $9 expected something little more robust  No anchovies harmed making salad  partner ordered wedge gave third although he liked it   I impressed hollandaise  price $2 additional quantity acceptable but white vinegar very pronounced sauce thin  attempted correct acidity shallots didn't really help  consistency fine otherwise   The wine list decent but little spare the glass  Bottle prices average but the glass bit more expensive similarly priced restaurants  pour size standard 5 ounces  party 3 more I'd just order bottle   The bad Very misleading reservations  restaurant no way full time requested but forced reserve earlier time    Guidance ordering lacking staff kitchen may war  Although still lovely tender single most done medium rare ever life including own occasional barbecue related sins   Did try The beer cocktails  didn't even see drinks menu other wine list   Overall Good food touch pricy sure much believe schtick aging  location thrilling particularly irritating part New York New York  Wait staff very nice hostesses less so  Worth trip but skip soup salad  <EOR> Ate weekend Vegas trip  made reservation just couple hours ahead time seated instantly when showed up    The food outstanding! cowboy ribeye medium rare  cooked perfectly  table macaroni creamed spinach mashed potatoes onion rings sides  Everything delicious especially mac cheese   drooooooool   also Maryland crab cakes appetizer  Let just say   am Maryland total crab snob place knocked park! perfectly spiced just right amount kick    Our waiter really friendly quick service   A++ would food baby again   <EOR> I came bestfriend's birthday celebration best steak both ever had  soon stepped into restaurant gave hostess name seated right away    The first thing served complimentary bread  cranberry bread bomb  roommate didn't want stuff ourselves bread before main dish comes didn't much  appetizer portobello stuffed mushroom caprese salad  love mushrooms general amazing me  portobello stuffed mushroom really big considering appetizer  want say size palm hand  caprese salad really good different other caprese tried other restaurant  caprese extra soft fluffy   As main dish filet mignon roommate $60 porterhouse since birthday   both wanted steak cooked medium rare but when food came wanted say little more rare side  didn't mind okay  filet mignon perfect! thought size pretty small in the  circumference terms? but super fat tall  if sense  roommate's porterhouse crazy!  in good way  She enjoyed much  But wouldn't recommend girl woman order unless she big appetite  bigger average woman's hand  roommate couldn't finish but she said her's very juicy fun it   So steaks sides weren't included order separately  Each side ranges $7 10 if remember  cooked asparagus creamed spinach  asparagus only comes 5 pieces but huge fat  creamed spinach enough portion two us  just thought little creamy me   The service restaurant great! server super duper nice  roommate actually going order more but server nice enough save wallet stop us  food came really fast  plus    We didn't any dessert because both way full but did see table next some key lime pie  maybe try next time  restaurant definitely pricey side but give five star because food worth every penny  would definitely come back bring parents other friends  <EOR> This would probably low tier steakhouses to  Service great all but steaks weren't great  Even though dry age steak placed front store wasn't special   It's probably 2 5 mind but guess would admit probably least favorite steak houses terms steaks    Bread served cold given sour dough raisin nut bread  prefer raisin nut bread    Prime rib quite expensive 45? dollars  might well summit house $30 prime rib known bigger  tasted so so    Filet mignon just meh steak  don't know describe if better steaks before  didn't stand sauces pay just covers meat taste it   Dry age rib eye best but still didn't stand it  tender other steaks rib eye given better taste meat  Would recommend if choose dine Gallagher   The sides Mac cheese terrible didn't good taste bit cheesy weird way really overwhelm your palette    Mushroom friend both thought tasted bitter which really odd us      Potato puree decent  feel can't really messed much  Obviously steak potato puree usually must    Cream spinach favorite one  don't know did but actually really taste it  guess add some kind heavy cream made better tasting?

She didn't even down bite added butter mine table ate mine starving figured may well try down   asparagus oily weird fishy taste  only good thing meal appetizer  Sad say returning Gallagher's  ahead paid $130 meal left tip much normally would but far more Todd deserved away feeling disappointed  recommended place many friends family colleagues but update them recent visit  guess all good things come end  <EOR> Great service! Amazing steaks! Hands down best steak ever had  nothing but dry aging girl now on  definite must visit if love steak  <EOR> We ate last Saturday dinner  service very slow  Ordered steak medium cooked well done  waiter took over 20 minutes ask food was  told steak being over cooked only taken three bites it  He sent manager argued over steak calling liars basically   would never recomend place  experience  terrible  left hungry disappointed  guess enough first time customers don't need repeat customers  Take your money else where eat management  could care less if ever come back very clear  <EOR> Can't really wrong high end steak houses   Nice touch dry aged steaks hanging window but bit misleading since only dry aged option menu   Coincidentally happened featured item menu   All other options wet aged which huge fan of   Wine selection somewhat limited   Sides expect joint this   four stars mainly quality beef perfectly grilled order   convenient spot nice dinner if you're staying hotel   Availability shouldn't problem since nearly always empty   But if you're looking big willing travel      much better steak joints strip same price point  <EOR> I don't eat meat steakhouses usually impossible but Gallaghers impressive variety sides  easily cobble veggie plate together server super helpful guiding through options  steamed asparagus onion rings mashed potatoes yukon gold puree caprese salad mushroom medley  large sides  finished half  potatoes onion rings particularly good  Vegans would struggle but if you're vegetarian flexitarian pescatarian you'll plenty choices   The drinks weren't all impressive  decent bar but night May 2013 bartender heavy hand mixers  glasses little small glassware feels light  wine dinner fine but all remarkable  clearly money steaks booze   I *very* impressed service  attentive but never pushy  didn't feel rushed pressured  server sees dad every time he's town  met mom sister over years  She remembers always point check when he comes eat  level personal service you'd small town  something pretty remarkable Vegas   The decor very masculine lots dark wood big booths dark green leather  Think British sporting club  nice but stuffy  felt dressy steakhouse you'd find Des Moines   Sure beef steaks  but more going them mere meat  <EOR> Best food ever!!!

Highly recommend its easy find great steakhouse days  back once baby arrives is  <EOR> Dreadful experience Gallagher's weekend   Horrible service   waiter actually wanted argue ordering appetizer didn't want order    large group found he done same other end table well  Ordered ribeye mediocre best higher end steakhouse   Two three others ordering ribeye same conclusion  told crab excellent others party   Also violently ill 30mins leaving restaurant   only item ate others party did eat sides apps etc ribeye drink served waiter when he apologized arguing   discussing condition physician part group the next day she convinced something slipped into food drink   symptoms typical normal food poisoning   She called restaurant discuss management call returned  bad experience all around back    <EOR> Not many places let look steak you're going before cook it   dry aging display quite show all carnivores   Steak wonderful   dessert fan but sticky toffee pudding cake amazing  <EOR> Steak snob alert!  When approach restaurant see sizable glass display showing off several large cuts steak being dry aged    sign next explains all steaks served Gallagher's first wet aged x amount time then dry aged x amount time   I assume most passersby doubly impressed this    reaction however 1  marbling steaks impressive   2   wet age first then dry age?  Why just dry aging entire process? Why even advertise when actually shows you've gone cheap route?  So order Dry aged New York which came overcooked   ordered medium rare came medium   only steak overcooked but DRY   actually unbelievable even when half heartedly cook sub prime steak doesn't come dry     My friend's steak also came overcooked   I sent steak back new one    it cooked correctly time    actual flavor steak great which guess ultimately REAL problem   odd gamey flavor sometimes apparently dry aged steak but never really unappetizing way   The sides appetizers all unexciting service sub par   actual waitress decent but bus boys pushy seemed hurry whole time     just dropped plates front constantly tried take plates away even though weren't finished yet    hurry hell there   Overall would say place below average world Fine Steakhouses would recommend Mastro's Ocean Club if wanted steak Las Vegas <EOR> Ate 7 31 17  Main reason am giving 5 stars price  Service great  originally seated crazy weird section looked converted part kitchen   When asked moved promptly moved us  Service wait staff great  4 steaks  3 prepared great  1 little burnt outside especially medium well    Salad great sides good  noisy atmosphere but probably hard quiet Vegas  Enjoyed time treat kiddos  <EOR> Pros best Prime Ribs ever eaten Better Lawry's Arnie Morton's Ruth's Chris Nice Decor    Friendly Service Cons Bit Pricey but pay for <EOR> Very good traditional NYC steak house very appropriate NYNY Casino    The interior dark classic steakhouse fashion  pictures caricatures various old school celebs walls  Actually its pretty good knockoff NYC original  also pretty loud very much NYC original  steaks however think little BETTER NYC original!   The first thing notice meat aging display right front window  Can't miss it  Some may find distasteful find quite cool  no mistake steak all here  classic NY Sirloin Strip $40 served bone  juicy full dry aged beef flavor just bit firm tooth note not tough! good NY Strip should be  yes aged window  sides aren't exciting but still very good  steak fries huge crispy served killer chipotle ketchup  sauteed spinach simple yet delicious    The wine list wasn't greatest but very nice Merlot served glass exceptionally well steak good Merlot should  Oh service acceptable    Is best steakhouse Vegas? Probably not  But also couple dollars less expensive other high end steak places  All all good solid steakhouse  won't wrong eating here  <EOR> I every time Vegas   best steak ever here   Definitely recommend Gallagher's any steak lovers    mmmmmmmm <EOR> All steaks larger standard cuts  Everything cooked perfectly order  Brussel Sprouts addictive delicious  cowboy Ribeye  rare impressed steakhouse but Gallagher's surprised great deal  high dollar establishment but back  <EOR> After Realizing messed he towards group Randy bought table 2 rounds drinks say sorry  Meant write earlier  <EOR> Not good bad expensive  wouldn't first choice but large group 10 didn't want waves  Overall seems safe bet very nice steak dinner but nothing really blew mind  Adding tourist price gouging just kind shifts whole experience down notch me  still wouldn't first choice but wouldn't kicking screaming if come back    I ordered cowboy rib eye wedge salad group ordered sampling sides including mashed potatoes asparagus mac cheese mushrooms  liked salad bit more dressed usual wedge nice start  steak cooked good medium rare also seasoned well  giant steak but good portion inedible fat  All sides pretty good but mac cheese mushrooms far favorites  serve sides family style like most steakhouses but much smaller expecting   I say waiter really ball fast efficient friendly all other staff really good well  clearly very experienced handling big groups such ours  <EOR> Steak = Great  Service atmosphere AWFUL This place Very crowded noisy fun noisy people yelling talking loud type noisy want experience when paying $40 steak     salad soggy asparagus overdone steak good  The service slow appeared very unorganized  prices pay eat somewhere else  <EOR> Service excellent food even better  ordered NY strip petite surf turf  Both steaks delicious cooked perfection  sides Mac cheese asparagus  Both very good well  Overall great dining experience  <EOR> The favorite over priced steak spot Las Vegas   dry aged Filet among best ever side simply ridiculous   side probably enough 2 3 people share  <EOR> Rye bread excellent   Clam chowder very good  Waiter said known dry aged sirloin   hope not!
