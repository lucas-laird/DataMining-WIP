Scowling your customers judging them vocally visually inappropriate never returning  <EOR> Burgers decent meatball sandwich good but worth price considering names attached it  Seems you're paying solely names  would think food would fantastic but just OK    The fries ordinary  onion rings sweet batter almost donut  very good bit greasy    $78 hamburgers meatball sandwich fries rings share little ridiculous  realize Vegas but we're talking hamburgers!  It deserted when late Friday night  always nearly empty even during peak dinner times when walked past it  Pretty telling    I'd save yourself trip another burger place w o famous names  <EOR> After waiting hour food came cold  large party told trying able serve same time  Then five orders incorrect  worse thing instead saying she sorry manager starting arguing us  never come again <EOR> Total disappointment cannot believe Batali Restaurant such low stardard   begin staff friendly server didnt seem know she doing   order came totally diiferent ask fries cold hard hold server most possible  There nothing felt right just wanted finish food leave soon possible  <EOR> Me boyfriend decided dine watching Human Nature because boyfriend mentioned restaurant features 2 famous chef  thinking should give chance despite low ratings yelp    Oh wish didn't! First drink lot lot water  water glass small would need filled many times would wait sure stare server until he realizes need more water    Second server seriously rushing us! already knew burger wanted but sides  Once boyfriend told server burger wanted but still thinking between sides he asked if he come back later least 3 times! Why don't recommend what's good instead leaving middle food order? course right when done noticed he jumped another table sat down before us take order   Right when food came bite side order fries   the server asked food was      ok whatever    Third royal burger super plain no flavor but boyfriend's really tasty  He ordered really good burger  fries half burnt thin also no flavored burnt flavor     So restaurant food isn't really memorable pretty sure forgot place really soon  <EOR> A little pricy but quality good  Wish standard reg burger well cheeseburger without charging extra sauce pickles such  standard everything included 2 patties 10$  bad overall alcohol variety well shakes wonderful  <EOR> We always looking great burger experience Vegas   it   Really Good Burger chips IPA   burger average   few chips fresh   hassle local pretty far parking conveniently located within Venetian   Two stars bright clean environment attentive staff   Perhaps attentive hardly any other diners perhaps but say yet number times when staff tried remove drinks plates before done    Monday   Last night Red Robin tavern burger chips IPA   bill half price but food twice good  <EOR> Mario Batali put your name place? ordered chicken sandwich greasiest thing ever  Literally grease dripping down hands  couldn't eat more few bites it  ordered fries table when came burnt crisp send them back  Everyone table said same thing sandwiches greasy anything  insides now paying all grease  only reason place getting two stars because beer selection  Otherwise don't bother going here  <EOR> Wow looking forward place until actually visited !

The service quite good   server attentive but intrusive delivered pleasant meal   The place nice atmosphere but seemed place wasn't drawing crowd should drawing which self fulfilling prophesy   almost passed place because place mostly empty during dinner time     Bottom line wouldn't way but place would solid choice if staying Palazzo Venetian  <EOR> My friend lunch today greeted seated right away  Although burger place sandwiches calling us  ordered pastrami which delicious friend ordered meatball sandwich  split order fries which surprisingly taste lot in and out  friend bourbon shake little taste presentation beautiful whipped cream bourbon soaked cherry green white striped straw  She really enjoyed would order again  Service decent although asked ketchup never delivered  definitely back try burgers     <EOR> This place good  only twice but both times amazing  hate live far away because basil margarita lobster roll always mind  Just watch birds your personal space if sit patio! <EOR> My husband big fan burgers when saw Mario Batali burger joint strip knew wanted visit disappointed    I Royale Cheese husband Very Good Burger  concern burger menus flavors tend same  very different burgers  Mine mild flavor much more umami bolder flavors  Both cooked delicious medium rare seasoning spot on   We also onion rings  delicious  loan complaint day just served ketchup rather some house made sauce    We also two different shakes  caramel swirl he cherry bourbon shake  both phenomenal tasting snafu swap flavors almost two full shakes    It's cheap shake burger but never shake burger good those were  Definitely worth charge mind  <EOR> Came early lunch beer selection good  Service okay but over time worse even place remained dead  Annoying     The burger left quite lot desired  place needs lot work decor food service side  <EOR> Had ok dinner during last night Vegas which included some wings beer morning burger   Their beer selection more adequate little surprised select few said lacking  good mix local craft international breweries tap bottles  Typical Vegas prices around $8 beer   The wings decent buffalo sauce but since served lollipop style bed blue cheese arrived little colder I'd like  typical flappers opposed legs weren't ideal   The burger itself wasn't anything special  mushrooms strong overbearing taste burger option  Probably needed some sort strong sauce cut into them bit  Burger itself cooked well but lacked much flavor   Fries shoestring which no real complaints there  Decent option but something I'd overly recommend  <EOR> Really Bad customer service Never coming back again! Food cold  recommend all! <EOR> I see lot bad reviews place however ate thought food great  burger very flavorful  sweet pickles really made burger stand out  prices decent well happy hour pricing  only reason gave 3 stars cuz upon arrival sat outside patio eat because view beautiful weather nice but 10min sitting began see huge black water bugs crawling all over thee ground  am sure probably because water which gondola rides were  But way hate bugs disgusted as1 them almost crawled foot  immediately complained seated inside instead  No more bugs enjoyed food  back but NEVER sit outside patio area again  <EOR> Came anniversary !
