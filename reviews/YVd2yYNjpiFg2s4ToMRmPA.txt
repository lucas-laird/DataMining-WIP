Staff friendly! <EOR> Ah   pains small business  pretty busy Friday morning when in  Only two associates working  8 customers lol  cashier new actually doing great job she just needed help  kept basic roll cookie dough another cream cheese quicker others  took mine but another customer dining back stop chef working ask eating utensils    napkins    I ate mine way  Very tasty glad they're fresh baked  combinations tastes flavors amazing but feel best part any cinnamon roll middle  save best last right? No  Double no  middle 3 tablespoons hard sugar cinnamon  Seriously  spit out  shoulda remembered take picture but road  aren't cheap! expected more them  personally liked Salted Malted's Cinnamon Rolls better  <EOR> Cinnaholic Cinnamon Bun done RIGHT    I tried Captain America cookie flavored both great  Soft gooey delicious most all photogenic! Next time think just try original though  when boba if new place always judge them based plain milk tea boba  original justice then know legit!! Along line if suggestion them wish more funky combo suggestions  Although plain cinnamon bun good enough classy lady both members party griped lack options  Make Your Own fun but business itself knows best possible combos  Instead only offering few menu twenty combos mark your best selling  would huge help first timers!  Moving away food did smell shop  mixture soap raw dough  might hyper aware because looking forward cinnamon icing smell goodness  knows maybe bad day just completed clean but actually bad enough give slight headache  couldn't eat took gourmet bun home  girls working day did want there  seemed angry distant  struggled put happy face but made effort cordial which appreciated    Will come back bun hope employees better mood cross fingers delicious fresh baking smells  Overall good experience  <EOR> Alright going into place no idea Vegan   isn't really apparent menu all   Needless say apprehensive because gonna cinnamon roll without butter??  pleasantly surprised! old skool caramel frosting  amazing  Light fluffy roll itself wasn't overly sweet  frosting little grainy  Next time would probably skip frosting opt fruit topping  definitely next time though! <EOR> Wow!

REALLY good  roll cream cheese frosting caramel drizzle pecans  Yum! only thing even sort negative say frosting bit sugar gritty but really problem    Bottom line glad location neighborhood  Nom nom nom  <EOR> These addictive once taste amazing fresh bun am accepting going gain 200 pounds over next year ok it <EOR> I discovered place while having sweet tooth struggling find good desirable option Vegan  yelped place came swing by  expecting only vegan option but surprise entire place vegan!!!! fresh right oven bananas foster route  Delicious!!!! bought two vegan brownies well look good very soft  definitely back place  <EOR> I used come lot  area remembered free bun or thought stopped by  Well apparently changed rewards program sign new start all over again  think  wrong  earned reward  feel should still honor even though old rewards system  didn't sign new rewards program  Why would that? Needless say no hurry back  say buns excellent   Update contacted Monica long review  She asked name address she could give free bun  told wasn't comfortable giving name address  didn't hear back her  appreciate Monica attempting right but feel providing email address cell number should enough  <EOR> Excellent place grab cinnamon roll drink  unfrosted roll save calories soft delicious  offer many options topping your roll if want something really sinful   Coffee fresh excellent  Cups dishes biodegradable which appreciate  Nice place take your plant based friends  back <EOR> I made cinnamon rolls scratch home made cinnamon rolls various places really good   Unfortunately par  gimmick customized cinnamon roll unusual but willing give shot  Nutella chocolate Graham crackers other goodies    The end result naturally mess leaves lot desired  cinnamon roll itself very little flavor itself would imagine being bland  Perhaps because add toppings down play cinnamon roll flavor?   I'm sure but big miss  <EOR> Great place cheat day   I husband last Sunday afternoon curiosity pretty good decision  Walking little overwhelming trying decide but lady staff walked through menu  opted Twix cinnamon roll husband custom roll Oreos it  staff very friendly cinnamon rolls delicious  <EOR> My husband thought would stop restaurant today  beautiful afternoon some spare time while shopping  first visit very disappointing  walked place empty  cinnamon rolls dry unappealing  lady behind counter friendly all  She said hello if someone threatened speak  She walked away which sign she didn't want help us  She didn't ask if wanted anything if any questions  just walked out  empty restaurant should warm friendly when ANYONE walks in  spend hard earned money someplace else  <EOR> Vegan Cinnamon Rolls yes please !  I always want support businesses using plant based options   your average cinnamon rolls   pick type frosting add toppings very gourmet   tried cream cheese frosting raspberries   personally little sweet side   would probably just plain next time   quality worth price   <EOR> I can't stop thinking place since opened   Since Cinnabon only purchased mall glad Cinnaholic opened stand alone location near me   Even though highly sweet still back   husband always gets flavored stick Old Skool version  <EOR> Didn't think I'd Vegan desserts but definitely wrong  cinnamon roll desserts just Cinnabon but don't feel heavy taste pure sugar    Marco rest staff very friendly offer suggestions if undecided  Old Skool rolls Banana Foster rolls any custom roll can't wrong    Service generally really quick but if gets busy take awhile all those cinnamon rolls  year anniversary celebration day packed  tell many people love place! <EOR> I'm huge fan sweets but all deez buns right here  overwhelming seeing all different options but let easier order Cookie Monster! Once tried no longer desire branch try different flavor good! They're even good next day  Just pop bun microwave it'll just yummy day before  <EOR> My newest obsession    I am vegan but few friends them but honestly could never taste difference   don't advertise being vegan anywhere nonvegans no reason feel threatened sometimes other vegan restaurants bakeries   certainly aren't shoving veganism down your throat   also VERY reasonably priced which always case vegan restaurants any bakeries  We came late night pretty quiet calm   lucky enough fresh rolls which great but did take while NO complaints but woman ordered just seemed getting little impatient    seasonal apple cider frosting apple slices pecans oats cinnamon sugar top   amazing other being little sweet taste   only reason gave four stars   Next time think try smaller rolls Baby Buns isn't overwhelming   see some pictures regular sized rolls HUGE could probably feed two people  They great neighborhood very clean store store front   staff super friendly patient when wasn't sure order   definitely back am excited go to some other cities! <EOR> My first time here  Easy order friendly staff clean  Tons choices can't see going wrong any flavor topping  <EOR> This national chain specializes custom vegan cinnamon rolls  create your own concoction based over dozen frosting flavors nearly two dozen toppings  If can't decide choose preconceived flavor combos  opted chocolate chip cheesecake  While think great use ingredients completely devoid animal products can't say big fan roll tried  clearly different taste non vegan rolls but did similar chewy texture  points skimping toppings  massive portion overflowing chocolate chips graham cracker bits strawberry sauce added it  You'll probably want share  <EOR> These cinnamon rolls great  Great variety specialties build your own  <EOR> This place amazing  don't understand people given place poor review  First off if you're vegan don't discouraged try Cinnaholic can't tell all  People claim able tell difference mental  all head  cinnamon rolls honestly taste better 'normal' fact cruelty free just them all better  <EOR> Loved stumbled upon gem  late lunch walking thru couple local stores decided little dessert  young man kind enough cut cinnamon roll half put two different baskets  Just found opening closer house can't wait  <EOR> Is Vegan heaven! Wow! bun perfectly cooked  frosting amazing Delicious ok  Back eating  Friendly service amazing product! <EOR> I'm really conflicted many stars give place because cinnamon buns fluffy good but frostings throw off bad   I came because thought really cool someone came idea customizable cinnamon buns friends decided give try  Service really nice friendly place itself very clean   The only thing didn't frostings  honestly don't think I'd any frostings besides vanilla which originally comes cinnamon buns  butterscotch but way sweet  However when tried friend's frostings their's also sweet  also drown your cinnamon bun frosting crazy  sure sample before choosing your frosting!  Maybe day come back place if craving some fresh cinnamon buns but skip frostings next time  <EOR> What's better fresh cinnamon roll   nothing! many different varieties which very unique  Apple crumble cookies cream today <EOR> In searching some vegan options while visiting Vegas work saw infamous Cinnaholic  course immediately knew needed stop during trip  came around 7 pm few people inside  ridiculously cold assume would be  There's display some options choose but speaking cashier also other options  Since idea putting together own frosting toppings bit overwhelming asked some cashiers favorites  She mentioned tiramisu decision immediately made  your standard Cinnabon any means could taste coconut frosting  very tasty worth every bite  back  <EOR> Well made mistake going yesterday now already planning next visit  Complete decadence friendly staff  see fattening but delicious habit future    <EOR> Yayyyy vegan yummys!!  Chocolate chip cookies good  Even day old Cinna buns taste fresh delicious   the frosting good true flavor     My only complaint first impression service  greeted when told first time didn't know exactly things worked she didn't say anything  asked recommendation she said anything case good   She seemed very distracted interested taking order all    Such great place great products amazing customer service would place much better  <EOR> What treat! used 2 Groupons first try Cinnaholic 2 brownies 2 cookies 4 rolls now good way introduced vegan bakery  many combos frostings toppings little overwhelmed but employee patient answer questions give some suggestions   Expect wait while your order especially if crowd  took mine because knew would need share rolls am glad did  650 calories including toppings can't imagine having rolls more few times year  would equate them Pink Box donuts  Your mouth loves taste but heart can't handle ingredients  would suggest less frosting better appreciate flavor toppings roll  very messy use fork  cut 4 rolls fourths family members able try sample  brownie very gooey much liking  cookie perfect like something childhood  store clean employees friendly  Parking crowded all other stores nearby careful  Thankfully waistline am only area yoga class should keep visits Cinnaholic minimum but would definitely bring town people treats  Check social media see seasonal flavors  <EOR> OMG!!!! new favorite Cinnabon dessert!

Staff pleasant tasted them yet  Didn't rap music playing either  Good Tuesday buy 1 1 free  <EOR> My coworker brought day surprise wonderful surprise was! $5 roll  large but  still entire meal sandwich place some fast food establishments    I am Vegan  never Vegan  respect people Vegan am happy some more versatility you  understand why needs punctuated place Vegan  Personally if giant stamp door stated Vegan would likely deterred  think awesome conversation starter big deal  Try it!  As far cinnamon roll concerned frosting aside absolutely perfect 5 stars opinion  am pretty boring order Old School Roll because simple  But tried few flavors tried cookie dough which quite tasty    For frosting though agree lot other people some issues  very sweet  taste sugar isn't dissolved gives grainy texture  second concern fruit frostings  personally tried blueberry very disappointed  knew something wrong because wasn't blue  frosting still same white color  means use flavoring  Why use real fruit? don't understand ALL therefore order fruit frostings  taste chemicals fake flavoring ruins entire experience    I think if could create way frosting less sweet them more natural flavoring would give five star review sure  All said still great place try Vegan not  <EOR> This rating based off UberEATS delivery    Order quick delivered great amount time  ordered cookies cream still warm delicious when arriving too!! good large enough share sure! Would definitely recommend place friends family  <EOR> The store itself pretty clean menu straightforward  There's display case right walk some cinnamon rolls already made some admittedly delicious sounding combinations e g  pumpkin spice latte cinnamon roll inner basic b*tch     Cashier pretty friendly gave some suggestions some favorite combinations ended getting amaretto almond roll  give samples frosting wooden popsicle stick which pretty helpful    No complains service friendliness but almost $6 bun just wasn't really worth me  cinnamon bun dough itself bad but nothing gush frosting just way sickly sweet me  Maybe easy sweet icing?   Another suggestion would better coffee! Anything  sitting those coffee thermoses all day just cannot good  <EOR> Am missing something here? Maybe all good reviews because vegan?? don't know haha! didn't want roll bunch toppings  just stuck good ole plain roll vanilla icing  always taste roll itself first really terrible  absolutely no flavor tasted dough  needed icing drown bland flavor roll but even icing wasn't great  disappointed!! <EOR> Cinnaholic evil  fresh delicious craving them  cinnamon rolls rich decadent  definitely back but need take few extra spin classes first <EOR> I'm obsessed coming here  don't come often because almost sin so  Just walking being enveloped smell cinnamon rolls To  Die  For    You pick chose type roll want frosting toppings  creative! additional charge more topping believe always stick two  variety all    They also rewards program where insert your number guess saves your information card use   plus! <EOR> I tried place first time last night  Bananas Foster weekly special  delicious  <EOR> Great service great cinnamon roll  friends Matty took order  He friendly took time explain everything  Vegan use rolls all fats eggs wondering if would even it  very pleasantly surprised  roll warm light fluffy delicious  just did old school cream cheese frosting  liked frosting thick used but definitely good  definitely could give son if didn't tell vegan he wouldn't know difference   coffee really good too  Better Starbucks  Exceptional service delicious cinnamon rolls  first time won't last  little bit drive but well worth hoping they'll put more around town soon <EOR> Amazing! hooked place now  want try all combinations icings toppings! <EOR> I didn't know true love really until made love heavenly work art mouth  Hands down best ever! <EOR> Wish open earlier could grab way work  place irresistible only once  continue come back now because nice service amazing create your own cinnamon roll  Completely amazing   The strawberries weren't old gross vanilla cream cheese chose probably best choice made  don't even cream cheese texture normally but spectacular  even scooped extra   Probably only cinnamon roll worth taking picture comes place  eaten cinnamon rolls all over Vegas because favorite breakfast place perfected it  I really enjoyed time even if wasn't long all  Hopefully day they'll offer packs cinnamon rolls go  <EOR> If going off concept roll would give 5 stars but when customer service bad thats okay   fiancé walked today because heard nothing but amazing things place fact its vegan made even better   When walked little girl daughter jumping down counter  weren't greeted when walked but woman counting money drawer totally understandable  But when she finished still greeted   Thats okay   standing asked all pre made rolls barely could hear answer   When asked repeat she attitude continued respond   If busy would thing but only people there   Very disappointed service  <EOR> This place delish if you're looking something extremely sweet rich!
