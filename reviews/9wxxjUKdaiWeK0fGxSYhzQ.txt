I eaten few times before but many years ago remembered breakfast pretty good   Last night first night away two year old long time   seeing most amazing shows ever seen Michael Jackson Immortal decided Raffles Cafe small bite   entered Raffles seated pretty quickly   Then waited 15 minutes server   9 25 ordered food soup salad French toast   10 15 server no where sight no food eat walked out  <EOR> The last meal Vegas chose order omelet smoked salmon spinach  thought okay  smoked salmon could fresher opinion  Plus there's no cheese  mean cheese if picked two topping choices but seriously plain that  really wish cheese wasn't choice topping but instead just let it  hash browns came alright  only ate crispy pieces because wasn't kind mushy slight weird taste it   thought because sister tried said fine   I'll come back again maybe next time pick signature dish  <EOR> Best eggs benedict ever!! consider myself somewhat eggs benny expert since favorite thing breakfast  mostly when restaurants breakfast  hollandaise sauce incredibly creamy  dish! portions good size price right    Friendly servers  Don't remember name but gentleman very attentive but overbearing made enjoyable meal  very busy all Tuesday morning  atmosphere really pleasant whole restaurant looks really upscale    All all can't wait visit again when Vegas breakfast! <EOR> The hostess front nice wait seated short   sent down aisle apparently meet someone else would seat but no no instructions   waited several minutes middle dining room   water came quickly but no lemon requested   Then sat    around 15 minutes without ever seeing server   No even came tell would right us   just sat   Needless say left   Terrible service!!  No comment food obviously didn't eat  <EOR> #149  Raffles Cafe final hurrah LV trip  effort avoid heaviest traffic back LA decided settle non buffet restaurant  really wanted eat Serendipity but ultimately elected because wait times   That said where did end Mandalay Bay? Again? Weren't just Muse concert? Yes yes yes! all craving breakfast yelp pointed Raffles Cafe  composite 3 5 rating didn't excite but when you're hungry food tends     well food   I ended ordering Huevos Rancheros eggs fried tortillas refried beans chorizo ranchero sauce jack cheese guacamole sour cream $13 http www yelp com biz_photos 9wxxjUKdaiWeK0fGxSYhzQ?select=qDdSjXkLMaEOFLm4RgGAjQ   pleased portion size really hit spot  perhaps bit heavy but night LV something helps   One friends ordered signature item Filet Benedict http www yelp com biz_photos 9wxxjUKdaiWeK0fGxSYhzQ?select=Lf1U5jfLnmhzDDYnHTYfhQ   didn't try but sure looked tasty she enjoyed it  other friend ordered pancakes     she began devouring them before could snap photo!  Raffles terrible  general I'd say unless you're lazy stuck Mandalay Bay effort eat elsewhere  many other great options LV  Take advantage it! <EOR> For ambiance really important if here   I strongly suggest getting window seat   sat corner where windows came together overlooked Mandalay beach   it very tropical totally relaxing!  Just hotel serves both inspiration namesake restaurant     YET prepared 2 hours your hands!   First let's some general protocols way    1  hostess only writes down your name if large party my party 3 didn't qualify back stand line   and then when your turn while standing line seated  2  Being friendly hostess   but worked day visited just stared back zombie   thus made felt sad her   why can't she smile?  horrible things must going life?  Second soon seated provided water very fast water service   Thank you! However   our waiter took 10 15 minutes stop by  place busy   so no idea why took long    Third prepared soon waiter comes   get all your questions answered while he standing order your food   else   he away give more time then before know it   30 minutes passed   and still haven't ordered your food   I ordered Nicoise Salad dressing side   nice cold poached piece salmon good greens   husband ordered coconut pancakes   waiter said given change chefs   sometimes 2 pancakes arrive maybe 3   he couldn't guarantee it   so asked PLEASE sure 3  Three came HUGE  husband liked sheer quantity however he felt pancakes pretty good excellent   He's picky pancake eater   Our friend ordered chicken salad he said very good   We time hands wait first very irritating then decided accept turned really fun   waiter quite nice   he knew much history restaurant   he fun talk to   all liked forgave being complete slow poke   Truly food okay hence would give  3 stars   however such good time 4 stars is!  really location table affects experience restaurant   really liked loved where sat finally appreciated relaxed service definitely return again!

I am Las Vegas local normally would take time write bad review but if ever place town deserved would Raffles Cafe  host staff very unwelcoming borderline rude tell ten minute wait meanwhile place empty she turns back continues talking story manager proceeds deliver punchline joke!

Coffee refill plenty coffee really tasteful  <EOR> The service little slow   food decent typical casino cafe   little higher quality then some other casino cafes  <EOR> I believe where room service comes from   food worse cafeteria  While portions very large lack flavor  mostly breakfast selections  Hash browns unseasoned frozen potato shreds burnt crisp outside mushy inside  eggs under cooked unseasoned  raw poached egg   star fabulous hollandaise sauce  Wait staff very good attentive  Which why 2 stars   many restaurants hotel  yourself favor pass by  <EOR> Worst service ever! 15 minute wait turned into 40 minutes when walked open tables all over  Then waited 7 minutes before anyone talked us  freezing  staff disorganized slow   Just awful!  horrible example Mandalay Bay service standard is!!!!! <EOR> If need quick basic lunch without any flare fine   would skip spot if Vegas many other great options put place shame lunch dinner  <EOR> Tyler big sexy beast think he awsome   He smile when ever am thier   Very fun smart forget V P  whole mgm company still willing wait tables man guy hahahah just would add best tomato soup ever licked off waiter TYler stud muffin   Plus he also gave great advice drinks desserts fun places if going back would only want sit tylers station <EOR> Sucks burnt nachos horrible service  I can't even remember if waitress greeted us  She such sour face entire time she serving tables  She quickly led table handed menus didn't say word left  When she came back put drink orders 5 min later tried order food same time but she just ran away again  busboy came drinks wait another 5 min catch her  Finally she comes back place order Angus burger super nachos   Angus burger Super greasy ask waitress napkins dab all oil out  She drops them off walks away really quick   burger could used some more flavoring but least medium rare part right  FRIES?? AMAZING  think fries only things keeping place alive honestly   Super nachos FALSE advertising  When saw menu thought SUPER NACHOS? must include EVERYTHING! NO case  no meat whatsoever  however LOT toppings sour cream guacamole pico de gallo cheese cheese cheese  But none matters when all cheese burnt into tortilla chips  struggled getting chip time  point used fork started playing nachos only discover inside being COLD SOGGY   And now wait try flag down lovely waitress again  10 min pass notice At table across room man trying use rest food credits tells waitress intentions doing so  meal cost more credits back forth she basically yells he cannot apply credits cover meal  When he explains he pay difference calmly she nearly rips receipt hand walks register  Personally would snapped B if done but digress    The table just arrives next gets food almost immediately order? Super nachos  But nachos only look hot fresh nice CRISP BURNT     Finally she gets back table inform food burnt  She does apologize courtesy restaurant's sake she only asks still want them?

My friend ordered Grilled Cheese choice cheese childhood favorite fontina     which thought very     interesting  He loves Grilled Cheese sandwiches though he loved also loved fact served bowl Tomato Soup  However tried sandwich fan all haha  cheese tart me? don't know but definitely wasn't forte   I ordered Prime Rib Sandwich overall okay  REALLLLY big sandwich though use fork eat some pieces meat easier hold  Other realizing no cheese sandwich good  meat could flavored much better though    Total all came almost $60 what!

The coffee that Ph D Aunt mother bro law all enjoyed some best ever had  When people usually drink black rave taste coffee know good!  I wanted something great gave old lobster omelet brie cheese try  thing awesome! also fruit side  menu reasonable but if you're looking quanity I'd suggest buffet  Quality preference here!  I took off star few reasons! service as noted other reviews horrendous  waitress kind slammed drinks down right dad noticed it  Again didn't give crap but know paying meal father did   I really enjoyed omelet cooked perfection! Raffles Cafe winner!!! <EOR> Utilitarian fancy food  place nice wait staff helpful   conveniently located if you're staying Mandalay Bay Hotel  wouldnt avoid but wouldnt way either   The water filtered little funky me   coffee costs 4 bucks!  grab coffee Starbucks next time  <EOR> Food very good  Overpriced $14 omelet $4 coffee $5 orange juice but guess  Vegas   What totally unacceptable WAITING  service some slowest ever encountered  Don't come if you're very hungry dont greater 2 hrs spend just breakfast  <EOR> Oh liked place much first time ate couple years ago   back few times same problems seem continue   time late ish dinner because comp given manager LAST time due horrendous service major kitchen screw ups     I decided order New Mexico Chicken Salad but realized before gave order waiter dish I'd problems before   Still only thing menu appealed me   told waiter sure tell kitchen expected fresh warm chicken wasn't dried out block ice returned comped last time     The service definitely better non existent service experienced last visit didn't wait long salad Club Sandwich husband ordered   But when bowl put front couldn't believe looking at   chicken shriveled dried couldn't even stab piece fork   sat mess soggy iceberg lettuce mixed tiny chunks vegetables black beans   furious because I'd gone way put kitchen notice advance   When asked waiter iceberg lettuce he said Oh kitchen romaine  chicken he saw disaster   He took dish back when he brought replacement EXACTLY should been warm moist FRESH chicken fresh romaine beautiful melange vegetables black beans   FYI menu specifically states salad made romaine     My question is Why oh why care little turn absolute CRAP try pass off customers hoping won't complain?  good comp if same problems keep recurring?    For record husband's club sandwich just fine huge combination enough turkey roast beef bacon feed small army large portion well done tasty fries   Otherwise would one star rating because zero isn't option    But also record signature dinner rolls which delicious reason return Raffles didn't served until asked them   even then didn't taste right crispy top tasted little sweet roll itself tasteless   Someone's messing those too   Will back?  Sure because another comp another previous disaster meal there   didn't stomach try last experience   Enough enough   But someone needs watching chef   even better hiring new one  <EOR> Not bad but great  night clubbing most woke hungover stomaches just wanted some breakfast food  downstairs since staying Mandalay found Raffles breakfast food everything menu decent price  took awhile seated service decent pace   I ordered fresh squeezed orange juice which came 12 ounce glass whopping $5 00  also ordered yourself omelet which came hash browns toast  orange juice actually bad some places where order fresh squeezed tastes straight carton box  food wasn't bad pretty comparable Denny's  Good thing put lot vegetables omelet  only problem food way oily  food greasy oily   But other everything fine    Bottom line okay prices okay food but convenient if you're staying Mandalay looking more casual restaurants hotel  <EOR> I really place     I travel Vegas once twice year always seem eat Raffles least ond   salads entrees sides appetizers never bad meal  Last Friday ordered egg white salmon swiss omelette sour dough toast   In short meal unavailable Bostonian city Boston   perfectly cooked even featured crispy hash browns     In many ways Raffles reminds Cheesecake factory lots different types freshly prepared food   defintely worth visit <EOR> Don't corned beef hash   called it   beef jerky  chef also wasn't feeling very charitable when complained still going charge it  Manager finally gotten  removed charge    poor service all around  <EOR> I would give less if could  First off waiters service good   Second food best    Ehh then found gross black residue if used ashtray bottom orange juice glass  complaining waited expecting manager table touch usual bs I e  sorry nope nothing  Orange juice bacon removed bill complete comp then see later    When looking food Mandalay Bay yourself favor keep walking past place  <EOR> After reading so so reviews yelp weren't sure if should eat here  Since breakfast starving closest food room just decided give try  am glad did  Ordered veggie burger hash browns club sandwich  All 3 LOVED food  delicious decent

Delish  <EOR> Delicious hangover food   $3 side hash browns   Best damn hash browns had  <EOR> One worst meals Vegas includes many meals far off strip hotels restaurants  place just bad  only food bad

best food world but expected better on strip hotel  food clearly quickly thrown together flavors basic club sandwich didn't gel all  fries clearly under warmer ages server slow unresponsive bussers

quick lunch but pleasantly surprised   lobster benedict egg benedict lobster    good though hollandaise little watery   really made experience enjoyable pleasant professional service  <EOR> My
