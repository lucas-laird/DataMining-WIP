As noted other reviews am recent transplant Venice Beach CA decided dive right into scene!  In LA tons wonderful Ethiopian restaurants choose checking Las Vegas offer   began journey Meskerem last week see review decided check place out    I read post don't think Yelp said Cottage Cafe better spots Little Ethiopia LA   bold statement! Needless say see hot fuss about   I called order know Ethiopian joints some times service SSSSLLLLLLOOOOOWWWWW! placed order vegetarian combination lamb stew  order most Ethiopian restaurants typically enough food into 6 meals  Perfect want cook 105 degree weather!   The first woman answered someone else take order she could understand simple phrase I'd place order      Anyway ordered bit apprehension proceeded head over thinking surely food would ready time there  live Green Valley restaurant around corner UNLV  would think would enough time      Of course no customers place when 9 pm Thursday night chicks behind bar looked put paying customer walk door  When said pick order frowned asked proceeded write ticket take back kitchen  HELLO! point calling would placed ready pick up! other chick never said word just disappeared into back somewhere! Wow!  After standing bar watching episode Real Housewives NY big screen TV finally order  Long story short $23 bucks expecting more food more flavor some form service simple 'Hello would nice !  When home pretty disappointed  portions veggies way smaller am accustomed lamb way dry  Unlike reviewer know definitely lamb not dog cat meat he said   tee hee hee but bone meat ratio pretty high add own Ethiopian spices it!   Don't know anyone could give place more 1 star but would avoid place all costs!  Never again return  first time life am looking forward left over Ethiopian chilling fridge  Being tipsy helped down okay last night  Might try again remainder! <EOR> I'd give place 5 stars but yelp good filter system since only review would probably filter if review good bad   I cultural experience place  Watching TV moniters  saw Al Jazeera true international feel news instead watching everything such U S  based focus   I veggie combo $10 since junk food vegetarian  coupon off vegasclick giving 20% off total bill  injera bread soft spongy  looks dishtowel use instead eating your fingers  doesn't any salt different type bread used to   When first woman didn't speak much English just said come back 1PM patient  When came back 1PM waitstaff calm apathetic distant quiet quite experience   I liked smell food  flavors overpowering food take some getting used to  don't know enough Ethiopian food really give good judgement it  But liked smells all seemed done well    I believe Ethiopian life driven way westerners used patience something good learn those patience rewarded  say something them think bit then reply    I heard bus driver cab drivers eat morning could only assume don't bring English speaking staff until afternoon   If traveling exotic foreign countries sampling food Las Vegas then restaurant perfect you   portion pretty big let stomach settle three times few minutes order enough room finish plate   It shame American values can't notice beauty place slower pace life whatever other cultural differences have  can't tell would  meat eater meat though   The meal quite relaxing setting  fact more stressful meals Hawaii near beach  remember eating fish place Maui yuppies hotel buffet  Most meals rather stressful making decisions order ingesting all gunk  Maybe Ethiopian food reflection people live lives  some quiet TV background some Ethiopian flute music which all quiet hardly noticed it  <EOR> As number others point place tends pretty empty save some occasional Limo drivers   bad since food always great when gone fun neighborhood  true service sometimes slow but also always friendly enough suppose never rush  try whenever Vegas  <EOR> Was over Double Down wanted something eat while waiting band on  friend recommended check Cottage Cafe  Although arrived closing night owner extremely kind offered let order something  super VIP place ourselves treated regular guests rushed    We ordered some spicy beef lamb veggies split  some Ethiopian beer wash down  no idea expect thoroughly satisfied when food came out  first time eating plan coming back again  taste portion price great can't it   I'm curious try breakfast next time  fan already recommended some other friends try it  <EOR> I liked place lot though wouldn't everyone   pretty way down Paradise almost airport very easy miss fact drove once even figured where because thought would driveway facing street but actually turn little early into parking lot   Paradise one way circle around if miss it   Once inside literally only people eating there   kind felt interrupted private conversation when walked two women back room looked though weren't sure why there   Once seated though very friendly willing suggestions order   I've Ethiopian before ordered kitfo friend beef stew entree not sure called but third down main entrees list    winner among two kitfo good but beef stew excellent   ate all way down injera bread then ate all too!
