But greatest fear before moving Vegas having cozy privately owned ethnic restaurants accustomed East coast   Now mission encourage others take break big chains ubiquitous sushi places expand your culinary palates support your local businesses   said first time same original owner early reviews don't give contemporary picture   seriously good food   I don't usually eat beef but Makaronia Kokkinisto beef tips over spaghetti   huge portion mountain tender beef very thick fresh tomato sauce hint cinnamon   enjoying more day come   husband savored Moussaka which comes generous amount those delicious lemon enhanced roasted potatoes   I could wrong but prices seem increased since last visit   Probably lowered EB cost but discounts had   Still good deal since unless you're training Olympics you'll leftovers  <EOR> Good food  enjoyed Greek salad Choriatiki   beef tips good but would liked little more spice  baklava best town  Amazing service  Kind always giving suggestions  back more  <EOR> My baptized name Stavros grew big fat Greek Italian family  Take place must visit! Great food! Big portions awesome price! hard part Vegas    Finding Greek restaurant  If you're nearby stop meet Frank the owner he best! Service fast appropriate too! Great experience overall! 5 Stars! <EOR>
