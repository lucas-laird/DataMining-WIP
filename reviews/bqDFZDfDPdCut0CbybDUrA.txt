Excellente!  Food delicious enough visited twice during week stay   Penne Arrabbiata very well made true dente finish   Chicken Parm spot on   garlic bread must some best ever had     The real treat second visit asked Angel Hair pasta Arrabbiata style specifically requested spicy humanly possible   chef pulled off marvelously perfectly spicy high Scoville unit  tastes quite delicious  <EOR> Overpriced mediocre italian food  Clumped pasta Italian restaurant can't cook pasta properly? sent entree back ceasar salad just couple anchovies laid top instead dressing should garlic bread two little tiny thin slices little tiny bread served ceasar HARD  no bread served entrees! Dinner 4 waters drink more $120 00 should against law  <EOR> im 100 percent italian chicago living las vegas since 2007 thank fresco's finally real old school italian food   lasagne die grandma use  minestrone soup best flavor doesn't need cheese   best friend shrimp diavlo amazing chef bland spicy like   wine list impressive brunello barolo    all pasta homemade tell intricately shaped macaroni fresh taste its boxed barilla pasta most restaurants use    the portions large didn't room dessert next time trying panicotta   pete waiter he wonderful felt knew years   great restaurant remodeled casino  see soon pete thanks doggy bag <EOR> Sometimes dining alone annoying! Because single    dressed air travel hostess automatically seated bar area next giant TV  five minutes couldn't take anymore asked moved quieter less ur face table restaurant  Despite restaurant being empty because early relocated hallway patio chairs instead restaurant  Kind bullshit  just want good meal nice quiet restaurant  much ask? distracting girl dining alone semi fancy restaurant?   Needless say because sitting hallway did server  manager chef did come over  table comfortable  offered fresh parm pepper  did waitstaff checking me  basically ignored entire meal  Meanwhile patrons seated he restaurant catered to  Offered water coffee second beverage etc    if am paying same price meal people seated restaurant deserve treated same way! If seated no man's land  Ask moved  chairs worst! better chairs deck  Hell  better chairs pool upstairs   On food Chicken Piccata should say chicken nada! First sure if chef understands piccata is  only chicken bone    which piccata  piccata sliced lightly floured fillet which tenderized sautéed lemon based stock  Just personal note Having bone sticking looks thoroughly unappetizing  Piccata should light delicate tender piece meat which should melt your mouth  chicken Fresco bone tough floured no note lemon whatsoever  Hello    main ingredients any piccata lemon chef! Instead chicken lightly dressed flavorless stock rue caramelized onions three capers four green olives    The sauce chicken zero flavor but did manage leave heavy butter residue mouth  dish served noodles which also heavily soaked butter or perhaps fake liquid butter byproduct   Although pasta probably freshly frozen look taste mouth feel cheap ramen  don't know but when come Italian restaurant last thing want eat reconstituted ramen    At end day sure prepared dish but ever did doesn't know piccata is  think   probably worst renditions piccata ever eaten  And eaten lot piccata   If going charge $26 dish should least prepare something resembles actual piccata instead butter drenched ramen noodles   While sitting ask myself rating place 4 stars? Although wine list good bartenders super nice food subpar best especially price  reviewers restaurant must know much fresh good quality food    One final note woman often travels and eats alone don't appreciate being seated bar next giant TV  don't appreciate being seated rest patrons dining room  didn't appreciate no checked throughout meal  certainly didn't appreciate being charged same fine dining price subpar experience  only reason rated location 2 stars instead 1 because wine selection good bartenders very accommodating nice restaurant decent ambiance  Otherwise would say thoroughly unenjoyable experience would recommend restaurant anyone know  <EOR> Service great food really good  Brianna really helpful making decisions menu  <EOR> Food slightly above average little over priced  Service terrible  Took over hour just salads  Only reason entrees because threatened leave  <EOR> This favorite Italian restaurant Vegas!  family style banquet few days ago  only food delicious but service best!
