The night before birthday fiancee found ourselves wondering where world could eat sit down meal wait line but also nice view vegas lights  walking literally entire inside Palazzo Venetian outside gushed over Dal Toro  very guilty having wanting table 15 minutes before closing but do? shyly walked towards hostess she gladly found table  initially table inside but seeing pretty dark chose sit outside instead  sat right next little lit fountain pool part  great almost romantic feeling! And    What meal! tortellinis YUMMM! Paired dirty martini night set! server also didn't seem mind very late guests either  best part made see Sirens TI show! Awesome night!

I'm huge luxury car fan come which probably isn't best reason eat somewhere but its Palazzo bad could be? Sadly pretty bad!  I start off saying prices weren't bad thought considering theme wasn't terribly upset just very dissapointed    This place much potential great restaurant unfortuneatly executed poorly  All remember meal just OK worst but definitely much better!

Wrong   My halfhearted latte wasn't hot enough came basic coffee mug  Disappointing   I ended ordering Shrimp Omelet which menu describes shrimp avocado smoked salmon feta  sounded tasty enough though somehow lacked any real flavor  hoping avocado would inside omelet but no such luck  Unless manage forkful feta each bite omelet pretty bland  suppose ok enough breakfast but overly satisfying   Our waitress wasn't just friendly either  She only checked once whole time  Multitasking clearly forte  When finished eating sat 15 minutes without anyone clearing plates and no weren't busy early morning then she just slapped down check without asking if wanted anything else any refills  Maybe she just waking knows   In city full fantastic food impeccable service Dal Toro falls flat  <EOR> DO EAT HERE!!! They automatic service charge written menu small print   Nothing written home page online menu   food wasn't great service below average   No refills water bread coffee served cold!
