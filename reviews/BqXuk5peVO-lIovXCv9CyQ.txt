Now place its together confused plant based means   literally signage   I gave them another chance  Yes place now all vegan    Not fan faux foods but wanted really try tapioca creation VERY glad did  Beef over chicken because anything smells remotely chicken fowl smell gag didn't risk it   My choice Beef Tapioca thingy  chose meal but way much food me   Also don't mistake made try eat your car  person placed bag sideways when opened foil   quinoa alllll over universe  No worries car needs detailed   If try eat car lol  messy but yummy! pleasantly surprised  bread start show   People know can't stand bread  Bread tastes gross texture gross body just doesn't care it  bread thingy AMAZING!!!!!!! If could buy dozen own wraps stuff would!   Another side note usually eat oil free  not  super oily but tell sautéed onions oil  little gooey oil action going on   The faux beef scarce possibly made TPV? sure  flavorful just right amount very little    I haven't tried quinoa salad  full  Also if know example AYCE veggie sushi eat LOT  being full off tapioca pita miracle   I would try açaí? bowl but don't sweets yes again weirdo    So second chances awesome glad gave VeggyStreet one!!!!!! <EOR> Just tried new street tacos made Tacopiica Vegan Beef!
