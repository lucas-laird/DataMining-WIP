Weird    Besides consistent temperature issues      The chashu's dominate flavor soy sauce  lacks depth  soup rich although plain  noodles simultaneously clumped broken  worst ramens had    Do recommend  <EOR> Amazing hidden spot locals  recommend   corn butter ramen shoyu based no bamboo  fried rice extremely good service always quick good  <EOR> This ramen amazing  Hands down some best ramen while  We're town wanted something would hit spot  did more  restaurant looks unassuming outside but inside actually really nice  Small dining area but wait wasn't longer then 10 mins  placed orders quickly food ready table within minutes  bf killer ramen challenge which he loved  meat itself what's spicy end he sweating enough take hat off  He would've gotten seconds if he hadn't full  chasu pork ramen soy sauce base extra chasu butter corn  O  M  G  freaking delicious  total came under 30 bucks  Great food great price we're definitely hitting spot again when come back next year <EOR> chasu bowl fav menu here  sweet salty together very smelly grilled pork   good i come many time never dissapointed <EOR> My favorite ramen place!

Like all foods made instant condiments chemicals actually tastes pretty good   any evidence food didn't through long hours preparation if offended anyone particularly owner chef apologize   But challenge tradition good ol' bowl ramen convenience offering customers hey if think light stuff heavier if heavy stuff thin down etc perhaps wishy washy   Take stance Ramen Sora's take shio ramen should taste present That  <EOR> Best Ramen House Las Vegas opinion! Deluxe Sora Ramen miso broth amazing  chashu slices roast pork lay top ramen beyond delicious  noodles chewy delicious  also serve tasty chashu ramen  miso broth Didn't know good chashu fried rice until wife ordered it  service normal  expensive leave satisfied full  also enjoy Japanese draft beer  <EOR> I never eaten ramen purchased local supermarket   I know use chopsticks   However know good food when taste it   hard find anything better ramen Ramen Sora   I spicy miso much going medium sized bowl noodles pork broth     What seperates Ramen Sora other restaurants its ilk service   big goofy looking white guy let's just say many Chinatown restaurants sometimes service is       well        less friendly   case everyone very nice     This regular spot rotation looking forward trying different menu items   should same! <EOR> Very tasty loved texture ramen noodles  chasiu such great flavor loved it   Great find off strip affordable price  Definitely order side gyoza well  <EOR> I walked 10 33pm only handful people restaurant told closed because stop serving 10 30pm   Well change your hours?

Honestly Sora more Monta    The only problem really when gave soup spoons dishes put gyoza sauce all little wet   I usually wipe reusable utensils before use them but still found little weird dry them myself   It would nice if invested onetime use chopsticks   Still good nonetheless! <EOR> Menu confusing  probably try other ramen spot next just compare  Spicy options limited  Gyoza's weren't good  Ramen mediocre best  <EOR> This only ramen shop town know only need know  coming year now its favorite places when Im just hungry don't know get  Wheter large group friends just sister places disappointed once  Really big portions great taste its cheap which best part  mainly only eat ramen but recently started eating dumplings theyre just god damn good  Place great whatever occasion want  Yes sometimes wait awhile due fact place usually very busy but never mind waiting because love place much  Great food good beer great atmosphere  <EOR> Really soup kick days  ordered large super super spicy ramen miso broth because everywhere else's spicy kick need  spicy meat side per server recommendation glad did  Wasn't even halfway through before nose stuffy eyes started watering spicy bowl ramen was  Took breaks inferno broth devour perfectly cooked pork egg  face still tingly way home gladly say ramen spicy craving fulfilled  definitely back experience strange yet delightful ramen induced pain again  <EOR> Excellent!

Friendly service great ambiance mostly importantly good food  <EOR> My favorite chashu ramen  second time came waited 2 mins 8 pm monday  The first time waited 30 mins   Small seating but very cute environment  would def come back eat here  <EOR> Before give opinion Ramen Sora let give some insite into Japanese ramen  many different styles ramen Japan just many different styles pizza America! Many people speak say Monta Ramen way better Ramen Sora  However  unfair judgement because different styles come different regions Japan  Ramen Sora reflects more Northern Japanese style ramen using miso shio soyu broth thicker noodles  ramen Monta tonkotsu style which richer pork broth generally using thinner noodles    With said Ramen Sora pretty good when comes ramen  would recommend Miso all broths tastes rich flavor    The reason gave them 4 5 stars instead 5 5 because feel chashu pork fall little short  Japanese ramen style chashu takes lot skill prepare correctly  If done right should just melt your mouth  Ramen Sora's chashu very tender but i'd say fall behind Monta's chashu  few reasons why think chashu perfect because roll slab pork belly when preparing it  causes more moisture escape pork during cooking process  You'll notice Monta's pork rolled melts your mouth    So all all give Ramen Sora 4 5  bad ramen found desert!  and incase wondering yes am Japanese! Happy Eating Folks! <EOR> You can't compare Monta Sora  two different beasts   Me? Sora fan  love getting chasu ramen miso broth extra noodles  Sapporo style ramen noodle slightly thick curly complements fatty broth well  Since noodles slightly curly more broth coats noodle  fun splurpfest    If come weeknight 6 40pm prepared wait 20 minutes  <EOR> We come least once week  best ramen ever had  Pork well cooked tastes perfection  always shoyu base which tasty always hits spot  Great place take eat in!

<EOR> When comes having town guests visit usually try introduce them Vegas' Ramen options because least SF good ramen means long drive headache finding parking not out of world ramen  still don't know which ramen prefer Ramen Sora Monta Ramen but think come conclusion both delicious own right Ramen Sora just easier table which means end eating more often which means tired faster  BUTTTT   still fan  really hard compare two locations thought really sad during Aki Matsuri festival neither restaurant's booths much love patronage during event   Some pros Ramen Sora Broth really really rich I prefer Chasu rice bowls over Monta Ramen they even come mini sizes Gyoza always cooked well Tables easily moved large small parties A couple TVs if really want catch game Wait definitely lot shorter Monta Ramen They don't charge hot tea which Monta Ramen does  When comes down Las Vegas lucky many solid ramen options nearby can't wrong coming here  <EOR> Butter corn ramen???

The menma awesome order side really well ramen   <EOR> Not bad ramen but wouldn't far say 5  plenty ramen living NYC Bay Area best ever but tbh maybe good gets here    Got takeout zoo Thursday night  glad ordered over phone advance but could barely hear thing during call surprising though     The menu sort confusing redundant  We chashu ramen spicy ramen miso ramen everything between 7 50 9 25 which pretty reasonable decent quality ramen but each choice miso shoyu shio soup  don't know why there's different choice soup miso ramen why even being asked pick soup else would be? but any case just picked miso soup all them    Pros Chashu indeed good melt in mouth tender Price point Soup good rich flavor  Cons Servings aren't largest but guess  reflective price   Pretty salty greasy while  expected ramen soup more most Overall fairly good ramen glad option trip Vegas family  <EOR> This ramen hot spot quiet when walked  soon opened day  quiet all heard sound happy customer slurping soups  trying miso ramen evident why place loved  broth plenty depth just enough salt pique tastebuds well seasoned tender slices pork thin wavy noodles plenty chew them  order gyoza comes four dumplings  Beautifully crispy bottom but leaving oily aftertaste   Credit cards usually accepted but day connection down couldn't process cards  wasn't informed until lunch  Luckily some cash me  <EOR> Just lunch experience just good first time! definitely better ramen places Vegas would recommend checking if haven't done yet   I tried Deluxe Sora Ramen $10 00 Chashu ramen for $9 25   only difference between two deluxe 3 square pieces seaweed which probably isn't worth extra $0 75 but if don't really care cost then it! pork really flavorful tender really fatty  normally don't eating pork but few exceptions because just good! Also most places just give 1 2 pieces i e  Monta but place actually gives good amount  actually finish pork end itself since ate most noodles which normally doesn't happen!   broth also really good personal favorite Shoyu soy sauce one  also miso which creamier texture shio which just lightly salted    The restaurant itself pretty clean staff very nice  always smiling enthusiastic willing help if any questions  also play music would hear clubs lol  place does wait time during peak lunch dinner hours since popular restaurant itself pretty small  worth wait unless its over hour  <EOR> My favorite ramen joint town! always switch spicy miso ramen screaming vengeance miso broth  If latter highly recommend getting spicy meat side! Service always quick friendly everything menu under $10  Can't wrong here! <EOR> This place gives lot food good price! family always come here! best ramen Vegas! <EOR> On chilly snowy day Vegas yes more seasons 100 degree summers! nothing more prefect warm bowl ramen   It's difficult avoid comparing place Monta but Ramen Sora stole first place favorite ramen joint  Ramen Sora bigger Monta which means more seating less wait times  Saturday evening around 6 barely rush    The menu pretty basic when comes ramen items never heard Corn Butter Ramen scared try it  ordered Shoyu Ramen upgraded large $1 more  husband regular sized Miso Ramen  Tip definitely want upgrade large!

It gets every time  Delicious! always extra chasu because corn butter comes 1 piece only wtf! but add chasu relatively inexpensive its worth it  way butter melts corn gives ramen creamy finish thats die for  place isn't without fault its small most nights theres slight wait but hasn't inconvenient enough lose interest ramen sora  soda which noticed common china town area but actually leaves little room flat drinks   They spicy meat if need little kick which nice even killer spicy meat isn't overpowering over dish  big fan Ramen sora most definitely back  <EOR> This go to Vegas miso ramen corn butter ramen also good general Ramen Sora good choice those lots ingredients ramen  nothing blow away especially if you're ramen addict typically eats top spots Japan least cities bigger Japanese populations but very reliable consistent spot gets job done  does deserve 4* city   I typically deluxe miso base add more bamboo shoots seaweed  also pork fried rice but portion size very small especially $6  I'd pass gyoza  times off menu special apps drinks usually handwritten sign wall somewhere keep eye those   I would probably elsewhere if going miso base corn butter ramen  <EOR> The broth amazing  fried rice absolutely delicious  gyoza vinegar sauce scrumptious  Service prompt point  favorite ramen place far  Monta pffft  <EOR> It Best ive long time  needed  little wait but worth wait  <EOR> I've tasted better ramen  But chashu bowl best tried  flavorful yummy!

Light tasty!! only reason didn't give five star because long wait  waiting outside table 30 40 min then finally sat down waiting 45 min food arrive  <EOR> CORN BUTTER RAMEN! normally miso man oh man smooth delicious  option add meat case feel enough  definitely ramen place  Parking tricky busy nights depending when may significant wait  feel air conditioning most efficient but can't stop craving ramen hot summer nights  some beer draft help cool have    FYI no vegetarian broth options  figured miso vegetarian but when brought veggie friend informed all broths pork based  <EOR> I only ramen place two times before don't great deal experience   Some family members town since watched movie called The Ramen Girl wondered if any ramen places Las Vegas   Sora bookmarked many months  where stopped   We each ordered different ramen   spicy miso ramen size large diet Coke   ramen delivered few minutes very good   broth rich chasu very good egg perfectly cooked    added some extra seasoning table turned very filling late lunch early dinner     As finishing family member asked if wanted try order dumplings   Why not?  order gyoza good   sauce served them outstanding!!

Another ramen ya valley! much anticipation finally opportunity try place going home airport   The menu relatively simple offer all ramen staples miso shio shoyu  specialty bowls ramen such negi nori spicy deluxe chasu etc  Finally order extra negi nori noodles  did say relatively simple didn't I? Anyway if anytime question waitstaff very patient gladly help order   I opted regular sized bowl negi ramen  When she took order waitress also asked if wanted extra noodles way she could time cooking would ready when finished noodles original order  declined but thought very nice touch  order came slice fatty melt in your mouth chasu half soft boiled egg large pile negi!  The noodles cooked nicely absorbed some broth but still remained chewy  broth salty very rich heavy bit oily  only complaint personal one  Considering ramen chain originated northern Japan heavier soup sense  definitely see myself craving place cold autumn winter nights but sure during summer time  knows maybe come special tsukemen time  Let's hope so! <EOR> Usually when come we're seated right away  ramen average compared Monta's ramen sorry Ramen Sora   Sora's chashu isn't tender flavorful Monta's  gyoza pan fried but prefer deep fried  reason come instead Monta's because Sora's restaurant slightly bigger there's more space between tables not claustrophobic usually seated right away service fast friendly  <EOR> A little salty liking but everything else good! First pick kind ramen then pick soup base  Shio salt Shoyu soy sauce Miso soy bean paste   only chatsu all ramen  No chicken vegetarian vegan  Price very affordable under $15  Wait time 10 15 minutes  <EOR> 3 words Deluxe Sora Ramen Miso It everything ever wanted Ramen bowl creamy miso broth thick slices pork tender enough break apart your chopsticks 1 2 egg green onion 3 pieces seaweed   As soon tasted broth Miso creamy broth heaven   Taste point salty but salty enough salty lovers myself   Pork melted mouth ate 3 generous helpings seaweed beautiful compliment bowl   noodles cooked correct consistency starchy taste all!  Loved every inch bowl!  I felt needed more green meal ordered side perfectly salted Edamame   So far place beats super salty over priced add ins Monta Ramen super bland shady meat super starchy noodles Anime  <EOR> Whenever someone ask What's good ramen place? recommend Sora ramen  can't believe haven't wrote review since come all time ever since opened  Yes understand ramen healthiest but sure all sudden ramen craving Service I never NEVER received bad service here  always welcome customers Irassyaimase! big smile  Wait time long times especially during winter but once seated servers attentive fast  always amazed fast food arrives  Never waited longer 10 minutes which huge plus considering waited over 30 minutes ramen Misoya Jinya    Food I tried both shio miso ramen personally miso ramen better  few slices chasyu melts your mouth along ramen noodle egg cooked perfection  broth salty other places sometimes    For appetizer tried mini chasyu bowl which amazing  perfect size if hungry  almost snack since really meal  also tried gyoza  very picky gyoza since mom cooks amazing gyoza  Sora's gyoza wouldn't mom's but good compare many other places tried    At price range $8 $10 quality food awesome  experience people Vegas Sora Monta ramen  tried both places but personally think Sora better  <EOR> Konichiwa!!!!  Hello ninjas!!   The location Ramen Sora hard find   There's adequate parking also street parking side if parking lot gets full   parking structure could complicated though because way lines lined up     On food during second visit came myself since way home friends house   Service time around lacking   point made look fangs chopsticks while waiting someone come ask if wanted dessert check   But service impressive first time around   happenedddd?    During solo visit extra large Miso Ramen additional $2 extra    killed ramen bowl asked if could extra noodles side think Monta but forgot didn't asked if regular Shio   looked funny speaking them Hawaiian   5 mins later came back asked if really ordered second ramen bowl go   More waiting   The broths both ramen bowls night day   If your broth flavorful thick then miso ramen   If your broth clear light then shio   Fair warning though broth greasy   dip spoon down deep blow top broth clear grease when scoop up     The thing bothers same small window where serve food pass dirty dishes     But killing second ramen bowl decided kurogoma dango two bucks   good   But sitting around playing chopsticks seemed work getting attention   mind only 3 other tables occupied time   No excuse crap service   didn't even extra chashu ordered but least wasn't charged it     Overall good food   definitely come back there's lot more room Monta if wait rediculously long  <EOR> For hot bowl noodly soup Ramen Sora pretty solid choice   Me?  used eating Top Ramen 10 cents bag adding toppings boiled egg green onion Tabasco own   ate crap cheap ramen when college still take trip down memory lane every once while indulge heaping bowl Top Ramen   Until recently reading cause cancer!  Hell doesn't cause cancer?  Ramen Sora good but decidedly pricy alternative miracle tiny plastic pouch   place small quaint close cozy we could hear neighbors talking dog ha ha pretty comfortable   If don't mind lack privacy then Ramen Sora suit nicely   cool night some warm broth order wifey I   Wifey many others deal bowl noodles? She doesn't but didn't mind going along meal anyway   myself delved deep into psyche bowl noodles   broth should represent culmination land sea   noodles should create just perfect 'slurp' sound when sucking them down   chasiu fattiness should infuse soup its   PORK   OK OK admittedly watched snippet 'The Ramen Girl' along it   But yes friends those take bowl ramen seriously   Didn't bubble your broth all day long?  Forget it   Didn't use pork bones Kurobuta pig?  Psssshhhhh   No green onion Hokkaido prefecture?  Uh uh!  I admire all into making perfect bowl ramen but damn gonna all preachy it!  Just let guy eat!  Thankfully folks Ramen Sora did just that   Wifey Deluxe Sora Miso Ramen   Honestly?  She ended liking much   understand miso broth would probably pretty salty especially if you're sensitive it   Which she is   noodles different well   tell different broths come different styles noodles   noodles bit thicker she used bowl noodles   She did pork because tender juicy but refrained finishing all slices because tad fatty   Which overall made bowl ramen just salty taste buds but rich well   Wifey only managed finish half bowl   Yay   more leftovers me!  I Shoyu Ramen large could extra helping noodles   Big bowl!  broth good rich but thick flavorful but overly salty   did overall broth but wishing more porky undertone   ramen noodles excellent very slurpable great texture chew good flavor   Cooked just right soggy   just finished entire bowl   only wish more chasiu mine well bigger serving menma pickled bamboo shoots      We also side order house gyoza   stuff killer point!  Chewy skin crunchy bottom healthy amount pork filling   Very tasty very dippable!  5 pieces under $4 badly priced   Good accompaniment bowls ramen!  Will probably back again soon now we're winter mode sure wifey probably pick different broth ramen   myself did shoyu flavor just opt deluxe more meat also extra helping noodles   Then again keep hearing handful great ramen places town now maybe we'll hit them try   No Ramen   No Life!  Did Brittany Murphy say movie?? <EOR> Really good  Lobe ambience service great food good  No wait when but 20 mins later busy  <EOR> This IMO best miso ramen even when compared those Japan long time favorite NYC  Order Deluxe SORA Ramen gyoza  son quite happy spicy ramen but really really spicy  Kirin draft such treat  Don't expect luxury but hopefully aren't eating miso ramen ambiance  excellent down to earth Japanese food simple Tokyo like hole in the wall  <EOR> Finally made lunch   absolutely shocked when arrived 1 15 Tuesday afternoon write names down wait list   Holy ramen! secret apparently out!    We sat 10 minutes   service abrupt friendly but efficient!  expected     We shared order gyoza $3 75 extra delicious   Piping hot served delightful dipping sauce   I spicy miso ramen   wasn't very spicy but very good   broth unctuous flavorful   Hubby spicy shio ramen much more taken mine   large portion fill any belly   comes topped green onion half egg slice pork belly ground pork   noodles maintain good chew them   very full when left   Bill $22     The joint cute clean parking breeze   would definitely again  soon! <EOR> I LOVED spicy miso ramen here! Now normally don't eating Ramen restaurant but ramen delicious!  The broth very flavorful also give pretty decent amount noodles  pork little fatty but thats ok   My only complaint would wait! think restaurant could definitely better use space add more tables  <EOR> I thought Ramen Sora solid 5 star experience even though wait 30 minutes    I love simple menu  There's 4 5 different Ramen order larger size additional toppings  miso Ramen but spicy kick traded family member  ended shoyu base Ramen  Yes any little spicy kick won't work me  Nevertheless enjoyed curly ramen noodles  rare Ramen places serve curly noodles instant ramen texture  soup just right salty bland  Shoyu Ramen perfect me  also ordered chashu curry gyoza   The 3 lady servers ran busy place really well  None them seem stressed overwhelmed even though people waiting tables  didn't flag them down all  came around sure all taken care of  would definitely come again  <EOR> Wanted try some new ramen came more then satisfied! Staff nice attentive  place clean wasn't loud  Food good!   1st picture large size Pork Chasu Bowl  2nd pic Spicy Ramen  3rd pic Menma Ramen <EOR> The staff really nice  restaurant hot felt stifling inside  best ramen ever had  noodles cooked perfectly but chashu slightly cold  egg also lukewarm flavorful many other places tried  'll if need ramen fix but definitely best there  <EOR> As ramen fan eaten several meals Monta Jinya Sora over last two years   convinced Sora serves best miso ramen Vegas   gyoza good well   grown more popular noticed slightly longer wait times   staff always courteous  <EOR> The broth great  Meat great! place itself kinda small quaint but ramen place isn't right? pretty warm inside well  <EOR> So bomb noodles always point  Operating hours bit odd but there's usually wait but along any other restaurant if there's good food   Always order large bowl because regular size wimps  Ramen great mix calpico drink fridge  <EOR> The place small bit disappointed wait time  broth flavor noodles thick  bit bummed half egg gave freezing cold  personally expecting thinner noodles  portion size small price  definitely give place another try  <EOR> Ramen Sora doesn't really need review but is It honestly best ramen town   Prices good  Options add ons good   Now issues WTH service here????? Sora uber popular 3 years or more?   fact showed 5 minutes before opening Saturday already line! would think super practiced efficient since basically ALWAYS this  when see all signs ordering quickly place your order really think it'll efficient  But not  Despite being before opened and plenty open seating given table 10 minutes! Then order wasn't taken 10 minutes then ramen very surprisingly took 15 minutes come out  all door same time right when opened but somehow table next finished bill paid door before even food  took over hour eat ramen when we're usually door under 30 minutes  reason probably never drive across town eat again  <EOR> I many times cannot believe hat never checked reviewed them  place never disappoint  Great customer service fantastic food great atmosphere! family another ramen restaurant! <EOR> Very good miso broth   select three options broth   noodles pretty awesome   fatty pork really tasty moist   pork fried rice very good   Service quick   Parking little weird but long walk   place kind loud but food really good   waited only 10 minutes table   menu very limited     One suggestion   signs special dishes posted walls  I'd see those tables since don't usually walk across room select items eat  <EOR> Hubby widen Ramen horizon  Until then all tried Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen Ramen Monta since loved really hard somewhere else something different    And different word describes Miso based ramen tried  first miso ramen ordered spicy  didn't know spicy meant spicy meat ? Unfortunately found didn't spicy meat flavor much  thought overwhelmed spoiled actual miso flavor little felt little eating spaghetti bolognese but know right? Plus didn't really add extra spice side note hubby both crazy spicy food eaters could why   But learning something new almost everyday when comes Japanese food now feel every restaurant dish little different  need some Ramen education dummies Ramen 101 learn all different kinds  think far pork based broth best but also only two tried far  <EOR> I wanted something soupy other day stopped quick bowl   Can't recall last time but sure heck don't ever remember seeing anything warning IE Spicy Ramen Vengeance   Hehe well okay then YORO motha bitches!!  plan B ordered side pork belly well because im down but down   I'd opt shio version but between no difference   won't able taste shit 3rd bite anyway   noodles cooked?  Better yet even possible none ingredients weren't disintegrated? Long hair don't care point   only thing thinking lesson next time brain decide something soupy ever again   Bitchass   did managed finish bowl however didn't far pouring rest into eyes   Down but down   Besides seeing shit already butthole already loosening up   +1 chopsticks coming through tho  held shape rather well even all abuse   Since couldn't taste just tell downright smell bellybutton lint    right reek fungus bacteria   Doesn't sound pleasant does it?  Don't believe me? Swab your hole prior ordering see yourself For outies find someone innie ask sample   Then tell IF VENGEANCE STILL SEEK?!!! *hi yah!!*   Okay maybe wasn't bad but sure wasn't any good FAR!  I'd never doubt would've really really spicy but expecting some glorious flavor along it   Instead presented bowl pure chili oil noodles other fixings soft boiled egg nori ground pork char siu etc    normal person would died already but your boy came through tell all that   Rather Miso Sora respectable Ramen Ya valley    But vengeance  Nothing good ever comes revenge   even spike weight reduction worth it   *protip*  Poop home next 48hrs if can   Also buy some odor spray your feet because handing roundhouses all day long! <EOR> Great place some late night ramen   Try spicy miso   so good   Only drawback don't tonkatsu soup base  <EOR> I am HUGE ramen lover   seriously could probably eat everyday if wasn't high sodium   just love broth chewy noodles    I ordered Spicy Ramen miso base did disappoint bit   broth very flavorful savory   enjoyed each every sip broth   chasu slices fatty but tender would preferred noodles chewy but slightly overcooked opinion   Nevertheless enjoyed bowl ramen definitely hit spot long weekend heavy drinking   My boyfriend ordered Corn Butter Ramen also miso base also really good   Butter?

Yeah  never huge fan ramen some otaku cries sugoi every ramen place eat at  However compared other places pretty good  pork blended well miso egg great noodles weren't hard nor soft  Instead just right  miso itself average terms saltiness   Just most Vegas restaurants you're likely come night huge hangover hopes recovery food  open almost 24 hours definitely worth trip Chinatown    So come Ramen Sora many Pho Ramen places engulf Chinatown area but does good job separating itself rest  <EOR> Im big fan Ramen but all friends loved it  ordered spicy ramen deluxe    The spicy ramen incredibly spicy just saying  Im big fan spicy meat put since its bit bland  However once mixed okay  think deluxe lot better  meat prefer eat katsu  katsu bit fat puts review back star  broth bit more salty usual  However overall ramen good!   Another reason why put 4 5 because waiter never came refill tea water  place packed barely service  waiters did come very rude when spoken to  When asked split check she gave attitude like im sure guys want! Who ate what?!  And im just like im sitting right next dont need yell  know place loud but im deaf     And way she asked everything excuse me?

Most ramen places give very thin slices bamboo  ramen noodles tasted ok also thick wavy nothing special them  I'd wish offer chili oil side would've made broth even more awesome  chili powder however find doesn't really offer much difference flavor     The only downside place crowded place get  Seating limited  came around 3pm packed fast  Another downside stuffy hot inside was  sweating there! I'd wish turn AC full blast something  Eating hot bowls ramen especially Vegas weather very comfortable  Parking plentiful though  would definitely come again if ever urge ramen again  quantity quality chasu bamboo shoots definitely won over sure  <EOR> I Ramen Sora first time last night impressed  only came because wanted taste could compare all other ramen joints also because figured would least amount wait time all ramen places    We still wait 20 30 minutes   Even though tables available    We order gyoza deluxe miso ramen deluxe shio ramen    The gyoza good weird almost iodine taste it    The miso broth nice   very deep creamy  way better any other miso broth tasted   also did chashu   very melt your mouth good don't skimp deluxe ramen    liked chewy consistency noodles but personally am more fan thinner noodles   ramen also same weird taste it   think taste menma   must taste bamboo    tamago didn't really any seasoned taste it   The service good all   waitress never checked us   She never even refilled water  BOO!

<EOR> My  favorite place family's ! even order when town guests come in  Fast friendly service best ramen noodles hands down Las Vegas  restaurant little small packed any given night week but guess less overhead keeps prices affordable!
