I spoke two couples wife met hotel food there  Neither impressed apparently service slow  won't back find out  <EOR> Worst service ever fine dining restaurant! server Fleming's understand people off days but horrible! ate last Wednesday while vacation seated immediately although little late reso    BUT sat 10 minutes before even menu water hello! Nobody even acknowledged far long! finally water then sat another five+ minutes before menus then waiter briefly stopped he didn't introduce himself don't know name but he larger guy very unfriendly  He took food order before he took drink order   strange! things worse he took person's drink order 4 total then he walked away real quickly started chatting another employee! ummm hello? rest would drink too! He came back minute when someone asked where he response oh uh walked over minute   Anyway food came fairly quickly very good  4 stars food! Very similar Flemming's style food used to   although N9NE Palms blows them all water!   Conclusion If spending much money dinner least expect service Chili's! <EOR> Charlie Palmer's 5 star restaurant  Wonderful atmosphere great service course steaks great  <EOR>
