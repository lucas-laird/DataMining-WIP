served whole young coconut shell warm sticky rice inside coconut home made ice cream top melt into rice  creaminess ice cream chewiness rice perfect mixture texture feelings  ice cream also most expensive item night  But think totally worth it  <EOR> My friends decided try place tonight  thought must bigger first when arrived because parking lot 2 3rds full  while we're waiting 3rd step inside see podium isn't being manned  place looked cramped table everywhere trying maximize space  looked around real quick there's no ready step podium  Someone performing bus boy duties 3 feet away table but he can't even look us  turning around see bar tender she eye contact then wanders down farthest point bar away door  two stood close 5 minutes actually turned around leave when boxed 2 more customers coming door  Now podium right front door there's table in between bar wall no where go  4 people front area small can't even shut door   Finally bus boy walks into back waitress hostess finally comes asks first  friend took attention asked sit outside while wait 3rd show  table wanted outside unmanned when arrived but yet cleared off  She said it'd 3 4 minutes them clear offered step wait  those 4 minutes she brought menu look but table still wasn't cleared  I really hope half crew call something because she all over place  dropping off menu waitress host steps back inside finally coming few minutes later clear table herself guy performing bus boy duties before now nowhere seen  she tells table ready take seat   Our 3rd person shows right waitress brings water then waited  waited  15 minutes gone all looked menu 3 times she finally comes back asks if wanted drinks  miss again place drink meal orders all once  then seemed ground hog's day because waited some more  more  Almost 10 minutes later other 2 meals which surprisingly quick meal prep considering slow everything else been  minute bus boy finally another appearance trying give 3 beverages couple sitting next almost done already mind you   then waited some more  still haven't gotten food  friends talking 5 minutes now still don't food  finally tell them start without then nearly another 5 minutes meal finally arrived   Now say meal awesome  dish presentation point food tasted better looked  But 3 night only rice meals even though menu showed all them coming it  once start eating hot burn through your drinks couldn't refilled fast enough  latecomer dinner mentioned curry much hotter menu suggested mine well luckily prefer hotter  ended being over hour half once finally rice table ask drink refills half hour passed without employee sight   We finally see waitress come again closing she asked if wanted any deserts  declined just asked check then saw right back  surprisingly they're making mad dash now close place down  bills inside two minutes before she turn around put cards handed them right back  bus boy decided time another appearance he starts clearing off cushions all outside furniture while we're waiting cards processed  chatted another minute two signing receipts see he's getting impatient clear table snatch off tablecloth  quietly suggested friends should before step off sidewalk parking lot table cleared all remnants he's back inside door   All all food amazing  But hopped back into jeep short drive home relieved came friends inside bringing date  can't say place ever back unless decided move bigger location hire some more staff help  <EOR> I love place flavor service interior decorations except really salty greasy side me    am assuming most restaurants unless request other wise   But reason 3 star because also authentic enough   dishes sweeter side  <EOR> The restaurant rather small constricted space tables but managed squeeze those side tables but another customers chairback right against mine  The menu resembled clipboard number papers attached  Half menu dedicated food half  dedicated wines  our interests focused Chinese dishes advertised those presented tapas rather dim sum which Chinese restaurant would've been  We ended having three tapas plates entrée dish  Each Tapas plates tasty imaginative  entrée smartly presented dish fried rice pineapple chicken onions cashew nuts  I think key Tapas dishes sure proper sauces accompany with  most cases default sauce worked well but would recommend asking them whatever other kinds sauces happen prefer soy sauce hot sauce  The entrée dish pineapple fried rice chicken onions cashew nuts  dish presented pineapple half shell which allowed take home eat remaining Fried rice cut some additional pineapple edge  wife loved it  in closing would recommend coming early because appears very popular nighttime together place  little pricey each Topos dishes being $10 each entrées between 11 $18  coming again! <EOR> Ask Dante Marcy he's adult blonde male  He service good hard you'll begging more  once toured Italian countryside together sharing wines cheeses sunned ourselves along Tuscan country roads  But sweet life fleeting impermanent  Such life  He soon grew tired favor lover Pablo cast aside day old scones Vatican City  Heartbroken am would still request name wait fondle taste buds into world ecstasy rapturous sinful even most hedonic among would blush  Tip generously but whisper name Juan Pablo  <EOR> It's best thai restaurant Las Vegas  many thai restaurants town

Update Nittaya's multiple times although today worst! stopped lunch Monday 2 30pm   My main dish Combo Pad Thai off full menu lunch special arrived egg ordered without allergic so  I sent back course! The exact thing happened last visit Nittaya's well   Both times server didn't notice point out When food finally arrived husband daughter finished lunches! also asked 4 5 heat dish arrived no heat   The most upsetting part place empty busy all!  No apologies Paid full price  Last visit! <EOR> Generally find trend fusion restaurants empty fad   Most time restaurant blending two culinary traditions simply fails both them rather creating something interesting   So walked into Nittaya's Secret Kitchen which offers fusion tapas Thai foods heavy bias   But left pleasantly surprised because Nittaya's mastered art juggling  offering wonderful selection Thai tapas fusion dishes often better you'd find Thai tapas restaurant     When fried avocado appetizer   only time ever used terms airy  fried describe same dish but really inventive combination delightful fried crispy shell surrounding soft tastiness fresh avocado   If head over I'd put fried avocado your must list     We also ordered spinach salad which tasty but quite magical fried avocado   spinach salad also comes fried spinach leaves which tasteless own   But dip fried spinach leaves sweet cashew sauce provided side fairly tasty   distant second lovely avocado but creative its own right   For mean course stuck more traditional Thai ordered red curry chicken   kudos Nittaya's dialing back spice   red curry spicier expecting super flavorful   treat ingredients right   vegetables?  Cooked crisp   chicken?  Tender   didn't skimp vegetables curry   All all better Thai places eaten Vegas   prices little steep but creativity doesn't come cheap culinary land   4 5 stars overall  <EOR> There's reason why take dinner reservations place tiny  Also very well laid out  food ok dinner companions decided tapas but took very long time everything ordered  Twice sent wrong plates figuring such small place should easier order correct! twice remind server still waiting for  Gauging value meal balancing service atmosphere vs price leads conclude making another visit here  <EOR> Great service awesome value lunch menu 11 dollars salad potsticker entree red curry beyond amazing!  best Thai Las Vegas! <EOR> My measuring post whether return Thai restaurant Green Curry ordered lunch special  found Nattaya's green curry chicken delicious hint spiciness though all overwhelming  here's kicker   like many Thai restaurants Nattaya uses ample bamboo shoots version but very few cook way distract rest dish  Delicious!  All all enjoyed lunch which also included refreshing house salad potsticker part special  wait staff very attentive friendly surely enhanced dining experience  back absolutely  Now Nattaya made believer Green Curry ready explore rest seemingly delectable menu which includes ample small plates way  <EOR> My boyfriend drive Vegas Phoenix eat often  Granted we're visit friends stuff but look guys come Nittaya's wrecked because we're going    The atmosphere fantastic  quiet place low lighting friendly staff  Basically everything looking restaurant  Loud bustling bright places fine but mood interact large groups people  only thing worse people large groups them amirite?  No words say food any justice  just need try it  Any all it  Each dish brought quality indicative fact person created dish loves cook  passion cooking shines through food way  enjoyable itself  There's profound joy taking part thing someone clearly loves place experience that    I really hope restaurant doing continues well  <EOR> I Nittayas Secret Kitchen tapas drinks last evening   truly delightful experience start finish   seated immediately upon arrival restaurant treated respect all members staff   clear customer service huge priority employees establishment    In regards food crab wantons incredible  perfectly crispy outside soft inside  great suggestion waitress  Also Bangkok Fried Rice incredible addition well  excellent combination savory flavors     I would highly recommend Nittayas Secret Kitchen absolutely back  <EOR> Great food!

Long pause  outside? hesitated but said they'd set outside tables  process took awhile  Because bit breezy outside asked if could set outdoor space heater  Another process   finally being settled sat down somewhat shaky table   From point forward things well enough  sangria delicious beautifully presented  ordered fried avocado veggie potstickers mango bacon wrapped shrimp  All offerings very good again presentation lovely  Service friendly pleasant    As evening progressed wind picked even space heater downright cold  asked server if possible move inside finish  inside while busy small table right bar  She said reservation wasn't until 7 would plenty time complete meal  So   why weren't just seated first place?  The seating issues did put bit damper meal but am willing give Nittaya's another try  <EOR> The food yummy!! atmosphere comforting chill well  favorite part Bangkok tea served cast iron kettle  waitress sweet helpful! no idea doing ordering she picked quickly explained things suggested things me  She rocked! <EOR> Yum! Came late lunch just time happy hour delicious! secret kitchen because outside looks dark  almost closed  isn't open sign first actually thought closed  door also sticks little bit really yank hard open door  thought only idiot tricked but while sitting inside looked several others also fell trick!

When asked waitress she very defensive annoyed did even try see point view   also chose brown rice which extra charge but mushy  Used much water cooking it      My friend's entree pad Z U vegan which just bad   Swamped oil even asking use smallest amount oil   Very little veggies no flavor   also spicy but then again never asked   They never asked spicy wanted dishes   wow seriously?

Prices little more your average Thai place but your money's worth  full dessert but items looked great    The only area improvement would suggest main dining room huge chalkboard mentioning happy hour yet told only available bar area  would suggest maybe posting dining room confused why would maybe featured near bar area  Just two cents  Happy hour ends 6pm when asked table mentioned over only bar  The time 5 50pm   Again just preference ensure great dining experience  Other really good can't wait come back  <EOR> If any cuisine would say could considered reputable critic would Thai food   fiancé visit least once year lived short time couple years ago while doing scuba diving internship   taken coupe cooking classes  well wonderful teacher named Miss Ya   very fond couple dishes learned during first course spiciest dishes is    PAPAYA SALAD!  seems showing more more menus Vegas recently other Massaman Curry both almost every time eat Thai     After reading place Weekly then reading reviews wanting go   Two favs Thai Tapas YEA!  first impression few others mentioned decor little off   careful consideration decided should offer donate some Thai artwork perhaps exchange some food lol!

<EOR> The food quality good excellent  did order pick sure ambiance place great  Since only ordered 2 entrees $50+ expensive enough food  <EOR> Nittaya's Secret Kitchen won't secret much longer tiny neighborhood gem Summerlin lot potential  Tucked back small strip center off Lake Mead Rampart little tricky find but worth search  describe themselves Thai tapas restaurant implying may some fusion

eggplant dishes aren't heavily saturated oil often be   You can't leave without ordering unique Spinach Salad $9   isn't really salad all but rather mound lightly tempura battered spinach leaves serve chips tangy 'dip' made ground chicken whole cashews cilantro carrots onions  leaves delicate yet pack crunch spicy sweet loose dip meat fortified salsa  Sounds little strange but die for  Chicken Ginger Salad similar Spinach Salad except spinach replaced iceberg lettuce lot more chicken addition tender julienne ginger $9    Skip 'Shrimp Pastry ' Though tasty dramatically presented no pastry found just wonton wrappers   shrimp overwhelmed cream cheese jalapeno leek don't come through enough  also culinary no no put inedible items plate i e  pineapple rind see below   'Shrimp Pastry' lacked cohesion flavors 'Thai Bouillabaise' made though mucky color off putting  also use frozen green lip New Zealand mussels ingredient feel no excuse good places  Though loved broth break 'make or break' Bouillabaise me   I love outdoor seating views mountains distance but best kept part Nittaya's secret $25 dining certificate restaurant com little $1 when sign email list  Although annoyed almost daily notifications discount codes incredible save 80% off regular restaurant certificate prices any given day  Plus encourages try new restaurants otherwise wouldn't even if defeat purpose discount entirely over ordering  If Nattaya's sure visit restaurant com beforehand even if don't code because still save $15 visitor   Finally knowing service Nittaya's slow  Your food arrives promptly once order but everything else seems take forever  staff friendly enough compensate shortcoming though worth taking into consideration if short time don't particularly linger  Hopefully just part opening pains  <EOR> This little place beautiful just right lighting special romantic hideaway  also little difficult read price gouging wine list where glass Riesling $12 brand $10 another  think Nittaya lost sight fact neighborhood restaurant nowhere Strip    The waitress whose English made nearly impossible understand did good high pressure job pushing Tempura Spinach Salad appetizer glad she did  outstanding though now $11 $9 previously reported   party four also ordered Fried Avocado  appetizer Shrimp Patties but waitress brought wrong shrimp appetizer saying similar names   She changed cheerily   avocado very good but shrimp patties ordinary greasy    For main course husband shared Chicken Musaman Curry served side jasmine rice  only dish didn't elegant presentation  good best but certainly worst Musaman but could benefited less sauce more chicken  didn't offer beef which better    The other couple much bigger appetites ordering Salmon Avocado Curry Crab Fried Rice Catfish unidentifiable reddish sauce  She liked salmon he hated catfish fried rice lukewarm    With visions Yogurtland dancing heads bypassed dessert here    If return we'd probably order just appetizer tapas menu  But then again almost everything menu fried stuffed cream cheese both  We'd probably best off leaving kind food younger set  <EOR> I wanted somewhere St  Patrick's Day where would least likely find beer chugging party goers  just wanted somewhere served Coconut Soup sore throat some place very quiet because also headache  wasn't feeling great tell  When stepped looked

server which comes more enough take home  sick hoping more  know Thai tapas place but soup wasn't tapas menu thought would bigger  soup still nice taste chicken pieces big which perfect  only thing wish soup served hotter    My husband Citrus Steak Salad which cucumbers tomato red onion spicy lime dressing   really good meat nice tender    I tried Grilled Mango Shrimp served Spicy Mango Sauce  afraid dish might salty because bacon wrapped shrimp but perfect balance salty sweet  reminded shrimp used order Tom Ham's Light House San Diego years ago! delicious!
