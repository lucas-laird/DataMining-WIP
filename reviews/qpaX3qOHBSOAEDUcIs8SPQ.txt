Besides delicious chicken staff management very kind courteous  restaurant very clean usually gets little packed  Everytime come through drive through breeze  staff very efficient making drive through best option when you're rush  definitely recommend location! <EOR> This first visit here   ordered everyone else orders chicken fingers coleslaw   The service really good she very informative history company reading board lobby company created   Food fresh hot served quick   HOWEVER   absolutely didn't see hype place   chicken fingers soft tender which love but NO flavor   Definitely lack seasoning!  SMALL!!!  due size OVER PRICED!  did sauce but all all cares sauce if main item isn't worth price lacks flavor   I definitely say chicken fingers Carl's Jr although bit pricey best around!   I would come back Raising Cane's all wasn't impressed any means  I'd easily give 2 stars but 3rd star service knowledge employee food hot fresh however small bland over priced   Thanks but place wasn't me  Definitely over hyped! <EOR> Good thing chicken good   wait 20 minutes drive thru   Sad lunch   don't plan return lunch unless no line <EOR> I've coming Vegas just over year everyone says yah gotta stop here    I'm sorry but chicken fingers strips     They good but really?
