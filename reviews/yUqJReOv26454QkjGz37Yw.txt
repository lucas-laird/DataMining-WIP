Best ever cinco de mayo amazing! Service fast very helpful sayuri sake tasty!! <EOR> Too bad management changed   It used super good place offering free soup which extratridelicious nice big rolls made hearth   Not anymore tho'  Last time visited ordered Coke brought over Pepsi kept calling Coke some reason  Sounds funny but wife irritated  Anyway food ok bad service but definitely miss old Shobu <EOR> I am huge Shobu fan!   I tried karaoke yet but another story told  place should judge its cover! Despite its shabby exterior Shobu offers beautifully decorated interior low light romance ring it  gone many times before ALWAYS enjoyed time   Walking restaurant ran majorly young Korean servers  always pleasing customers always upbeat attitude  food serve fusion between Japanese dishes Korean dishes well  Dishes such sushi tempura teriyaki kalbi found here!  It little bit pricier side but would say well worth it  food excellent think love Kalbi! If you're drinks would recommend ANY flavored soju! Yum! Lastly would say sushi hit miss here  Some days them fat yummy  Other days them falling apart  Maybe would explain 4 5 rating    Regardless would always come back Shobu! Oishi!! <EOR> Karaoke Sapporo! We area hankering karaoke checked place out  Appears just restaurant first glance but karaoke rooms rent hour  3 ran $15 hr  fun try new songs without fear pissing off crowd fun control music  Menu listed Sapporo draft $12 95 pitcher but said draft broken drank large Sapporo's $6 95 ea  2 hours singing few beers came $60  It fun switch little sure if ever mood again return  <EOR> A perfectly singable alternative bigger private room karaoke establishments  Plus adore interior restaurant half! However really didn't sample much menu don't much report front    We ended Shobu Saturday night waiting long karaoke room bigger place down road  rooms Shobu cheaper without wait no brainer  room held 10 12 comfortably could squeeze 15  Cost $15 hour which totally reasonable! bring plenty water tambourines special little mic condoms service button within easy tapping distance    The song selection nice  super current songs plenty Korean songs too  Every song selected available unlike some other spots where some songs book but missing system  control Korean helps if come your closest Korean pals  Otherwise may loss which remote buttons hit     The karaoke room hot one  crank portable A C down 60 degrees but least separate unit room   Another bonus full menu full kitchen but again didn't sample good deal food can't say if delicious not  However would definitely come back just drink restaurant because really loved cozy cute interior  would also return karaoke  current song choice Ready Love Bad Company  <EOR> Shobu delicious  Despite reading some reviews boyfriend ourselves  around 11pm seemed mainly Korean hangout place Korean also  3 different types rolls which rolled salmon kiwi mango  flavor explosion your mouth! also Korean spicy fried chicken perfectly marinated chicken pieces moist  drooling    also specialty dish which consisted braised pork belly daikon kimchi oysters napa cabbage  Basically take cabbage layer other ingredients wrap eat it  fattiness pork belly perfect combination spiciness kimchi refreshing taste oysters baby shrimp sauce gave slight saltiness  also ordered bowl udon noodles broth nice hearty different alternative pho ordered fried squid  Yum    know know    did lot but try variety things when somewhere new  place really cool chill vibe  Customer service A+++ waiter waitress also asking if needed anything else  should try place but maybe consult servers see recommend <EOR> Great Food Great Service very freash!  We did all Eat didn't little bull type charges if want soy wrap paper $1 00 more all eat menue thing that!  Set price ALL EAT let people eat every thing stop nickle diming them! <EOR> If LVRJ category Best Korean Restaurant posing Japanese    this place would win hands down   atmosphere pretty close izakaya really nice but   most employees Korean    more 70% menu Korean   sure sushi but why pose Japanese place??  Japanese food pretty meh  <EOR> This place amazing! cast just done performing show strip wanted some yummy food  quickly did yelp search discovered hidden gem  First decor freaking beautiful  back table fit all very comfortably away any people could loud wanted and being actors pretty dang loud Second waitress such doll! much fun just sweet! actress's still fake blood waitress super concerned her  She gave ton attention even running when buzzed order taken  She joked around just great  Third food!
