Hubby pasta supposed short ribs but could barely find meat  scallop special shrimp risotto which B but $42 could some hint seasoning  Very average food $130  Oh yeah $8 bottle beer  surprised if restaurant survives  return! <EOR> Hearthstone receives 5 stars me   when called ti reservation young lady more accommodating seeing table best party arrived earlier hostess more pleasant seeing comfortable bar   upon arrival hostess door greeted wonderful attitude smile  she said party arrived showed table all while holding pleasant conversation!

Bacon wrapped dates amazing fried chicken! <EOR> Huge disappointment! When first walked restaurant really good vibe  Friendly hostess front really nice decor  reservations 630pm rest party around 645  hoping main server new because she seemed afraid talk very unorganized  second server helping very confident friendly   My husband ordered pizza special which duck prosciutto pizza wagyu short rib burger meat cheese platter jalapeno hummus  table 12 when everyone's food started come different times first understandable  30 mins into meal glasses empty sat empty while  No water alcohol help ease pain waiting over 2 hours main course  friends dishes completely forgotten burger ordered another friends cheese dish brought they only gave bread no cheese    add unorganized mess $21 00 yes said $21 00 wagyu short rib burger total waste money  did really good job making exact replica  animal sauce inn n burger overcooked  would rather pay half price black truffle cheeseburger couple doors down yard house  duck prosciutto pizza which $19 00 few little pieces duck could barely see taste little tiny slice prosciutto each slice pizza  Again worth it   To end 3 hour long dinner male server asks things told OK  normally don't complain but he asked honest opinion twice more I guess because he saw only took few bites $21 burger even trying fries told nice way thought  Mentioning everything forgotten dishes 2 hour wait main course ridiculously priced burgers   He tells oh yes heard forgotten dishes two wait food apologized table offering couple free desserts  kindly declined because point didn't want wait another hour dessert arrive  When received bill only thing taken off forgotten dishes  No manager came over speak anything  more negative things add review but long enough already  really high hopes restaurant but never going back place  <EOR> Everything over priced! YardBird definitely better service food pricing  <EOR> Hearthstone lost four customers false advertising terrible customer service  wife another couple last Thursdays Wine event 9pm till 11pm  RSVP only event  received invite email printed tickets event  first time visiting new Restaurant  looking forward since opened  Restaurant beautiful but customer service terrible  music way loud wine event no could really talk each other without yelling  real issue place terrible service two waitresses serving event area  asked young lady where free appetizers  were  She informed don't anymore something did when first started events but stopped  explained email tickets good way business  then asked bring menu's  took 15 minutes them another waitress  then asked young lady appetizers she no clue going ask manager  told please going order something off menu way  She never returned  watched first waitress wait only certain people around us  people waited younger people waitresses ages  older customer seemed ignored  sure about  2 very good glasses wine did give free separate wine server part event  all very hungry decided next door Mercadito order food drinks  disappointed  service outstanding food drinks great  bought couple bottles wine Mercadito which going buy few bottles Hearthstone but never chance  highly recommend Mercadito would suggest passing Hearthstone until step game  Very disappointed because beautiful place menu wine list looks great but does matter if service sucks    last note  commented issue Hearthstones facebook page under Wine event post deleted never commented messaged back  remember only positive feedback share social media  why decided Yelp post  <EOR> Jessica G awesome!

After  another 10 yes TEN more minutes she announced table needed put together brought another room basement some other lame excuse  waited another 5 minutes until table finally ready  Wow! No else entered restaurant while waiting    so holdup? When finally sat down noticed many employees  Some busy but others not  The meal took long time prepare apparently all five dishes did arrive together  Food best mediocre  ordered salmon rested some strange looking goop called eggplant puree  Although offensive didn't taste eggplant but looked spackle lumps them  lumps garbanzo beans  portion worth price  Also served looked dog's water dish  Resting your fork knife between bites while carrying conversation challenge  ate no offered dessert  Oh well maybe would taken another half hour prepare  Expensive? yes! Worth it? No! <EOR> Had reservations but we're informed would 10 minute wait  actual wait seated 30 minutes  didn't time long took entree but other diners seated same time food ate paid check departed well before anyone came table  no apology wait asked things going  said waiting meals  wasn't until then manager admitted screwed dishes  told would just few minutes more  significantly more that  sangria watery but rest food quite good  Food good  Service unacceptably bad  <EOR> good food worst service ever  May 7 brunch   Waited few minutes bar then seated   waitress came table  twice   She took order then never saw again   flag busboy down 3 separate occasions some bread some salad dressing waitress could check   food just OK   hash browns good but roasted potatoes good   salad salad   California Benedict eggs bland 'chicken' tasted packaged lunch meat   hour half   would think 90 minutes waitress could least stopped see doing but nope   3rd time given place chance   each time service gotten worse worse price cheap   oysters notoriously TINY   2 shells nothing it???

Count in         thought  Came Monday night football specials included all eat chicken wings 10$ 10$ pitchers limited domestic beers  yet find truly great wing place Vegas thought why give Hearthstone's wing special try  Upon ordering wings server looked annoyed seemed keep demeanor entire length dining experience  Once received first batch wings soaked buffalo sauce  sauce itself nice tangy however much sauce wings floating lake it  attempted server's attention ask if next batch wings could made light sauce but he never came checked us  Thankfully food runner I believe name James came blue kitchen brought next batch wings smile  He informed he could wings sauce side quickly brought some us  sauce side winner allowed wings maintain crispy exterior  Overall experience whole mediocre  server horrible unattentive however food runner amazing  He truly took care deserved all credit  really high hopes Hearthstone since seem cater towards locals specials  However way service may just last resort tourists lazy leave hotel  <EOR> Amazing!    little service long way any establishment  Hearthstone pleasantly comfortable restaurant slash bar northern side red rock casino  But don't fooled despite warm entrance lies horrid truth  dissatisfied empty stomach! Every meal list completely overpriced but even isn't motivate such low 2 star rating me  only ignored 1 but 2 servers  came 2 others sat table each ordered 1 order unlimited wings national wing day  friend also ordered 1 steak fries recommended waiter share having told steak fries perfect share between 3 us  Laughable  fries $8 made 1 single potato consisting 7 pieces  counted   wasn't enough feed squirrel   But besides misleading waiter annoyed lack keep order  also asked if could use check offer yelp glass wine   never came! When food finally came instead individual plates given 1 plate share wings  But didn't even compensate adding more wings plate simply done serving easier them  when asked 1 more sauce cup also lost along Houdini server  then asked Criss Angel chef also vanished along nonexistent extra sauce well  amazing vanishing act but left distressed process  took 3 hours 2 dishes wings   All eat course 12 hours?  The only single redeeming quality service wasn't even host but water boy  He filled water cups drinks even tried fill service host lacked point him  think kid should take over waiter demoted   **update case misunderstanding review  wing day deal 10$ per person clear prior coming ordered way well no miscommunication that  But disappointing receiving 1 plate wings 3 separate unlimited wing orders  Instead giving 3 individual plates each mean did order separately why all sharing 1 plate for? If all order steak dinner gonna given 3 steaks 1 plate 3 plates 1 steak?  issue  created shorter meal longer wait time orders come through less sauce wings horrible service  <EOR> Came steady Wednesday night mom sisters  really impressed food service  Jeff great really attentive  He recommended some dishes  favorite calamari baked ricotta  Ommmmggg good!!

calamari still spot on but more deep fried lemons zucchini pretty sure portion bit larger yay!   tried 2 new items entree French onion soup adult grilled cheese  g*d soup incredible  Perfect balance sweet savory  cheese crouton easy manage  grilled cheese however lacked couple places 1 no flavor whatsoever 2 rather dry  needed more cheese more creamy one  wasn't blown away desserts either  Luckily calamari soup carried meal made mostly worth it  <EOR> Had brunch  Shellfish platter okay  Oysters fresh though  Chicken club pretty decent  menu doesn't offer anything nice brunch  try dinner though  <EOR> The staff amazing extremely friendly  top gorgeous ambiance food high quality  tried wings which subpar burger which great sister prime rib literally best thing ever tasted  Seriously  best thing  Ever  eat it  Now    Great place but bit pricey beware  Thanks Hearthstone! <EOR> It's shame reviews lousy but here's take it  very organized  new enough doesn't bother own restaurant things am relaxed prior being business I'd very upset about    Here's negative things take way long table even bill take 20 minutes but hope couple months worked out  Staff friendly but over worked disorganized  music wayyyyyy loud  hard talk without yelling  know seems new thing place seem busy even when but drives nuts only thing keep eating every week two   other thing don't which nothing dining experience form contact response email address bad review  empower all staff comp give samples whatever need customers happy  them feel better job because no decisions work without having talk supervisor just suggestion   Also smoother because when someone gets upset gets fixed right then there  If don't handled discuss alternatives later but let them choice time    Positive why we'll back  food excellent  could pick sauce short ribs being salty but otherwise large group lot things try everything very good  <EOR> This place amazing! sat bar amazing service along amazing food  ordered bacon wrapped scallops prime rib both best ever had  regularly order prime rib scallops place hands down best both! scallops sauce them really set whole dish off love! manager even came checked sure everything ok  All bartenders fabulous worked together serve us  can't say enough place!! <EOR> If could give zero negative stars would  ABSOLUTE most terrible experience restaurant ever    For price food quality isn't bad  But service just awful no reason either  place wasn't terribly busy seemed adequate amount staff but whatever reason just attentive tables  Everything came slow motion 40 mins beer 30 mins wine over hour food    That wasn't bad part though  waiting 30 mins just check let alone pay bill  everything came slower grass growing asked speak manager discuss experience  He came briefly turned around quickly when he heard complaining server  literally run even talk him  He apologized but could tell he didn't really care say    After 3 hrs total place terrible service return  sure where 4 star service today  <EOR> Three stars rating reserved place would return to  Hearthstone unfortunately those places    My mother received gift certificate hard work come dine 'fine' establishment  However because she works hard she no time use thus duty fell onto eldest  delighted come better half could dinner movie    Movie great hoped end dinner even higher note round night but so   Entering establishment see eclectic collection items your right white plaster animal heads mounted wall mirrors signs photos varying degrees 'aged' vintage quirkiness all rage days   I think supposed chic but instead ended being metaphor theme dinner evening menagerie 'stuff' without any true taste speak of    Our waitress seated very kind bubbly but all seemed disappear soon presented gift certificate something would later continue confirmed throughout night she attended other tables literally adjacent much more feverishly  brushed off however she did continue least attentive enough table she made sure never ran water  And despite gratuity being included certificate left cash top that  Service aside let's down good stuff or mediocre instance Food  My other half scallops cauliflower puree farro risotto lemon I pot pie rotisserie chicken roasted vegetables truffle veloute We shared two sides Sweet potato fries harissa yogurt dip Mac Cheese Brie Fontina cheese I want start off saying sad sad day when sides better actual entrees  However being said meal remember over all   You know you're good place when excited dig continue eagerly dig consistently through evening even if full exactly didn't happen  Once initial excitement having food table died down steady decline ended picking food rather disheartened manner   The mac cheese despite being initially delicious far rich five bites sorely lacking more breading even much cheese butter god knows else dripping  perhaps accompaniment crostini would help greatly  fries cooled began hardening centers manner frozen food products therein also lost appeal meal sagged on    My other half avid lover scallops told he liked them but entire plate whole did feel worth $36 00 rather $20 00 he even further put off when scallops proved still sandy therein all properly cleaned before having fired  then he confirmed he would never order plate again should ever return   if ever returned    Our waitress bless misheard when debating between fried chicken pot pie she rushed pot pie order me  She warned would take twenty minutes confirmed would okay patiently waited hoping pot pie would any grandmother green envy daring overshadow family recipe   I think instead grandma would died laughing it   They definitely rushed attempt quickly instead taking time salvaging already crumbling credibility   A lot vegetables filling still raw like peas point found half onion I kid not still just freshly chopped form sitting skillet surprisingly cooked through  supposed rotisserie chicken but maybe found tablespoon's worth and  being generous tasted chicken does when you've cooked leave few nights microwave long  sham shame  top all off wasn't hint salt any other sort seasoning filling  favourite part whole thing most flavourful crust but pretty sure just well seasoned phyllo dough  The plate priced $27 00 but think even $15 00 would pushing it    So overall night glad forgettable because don't want waste second more remembering it  Maybe someday future find inspiration try Hearthstone again but anytime within next year would soon me  wowed would more happy return because if there's thing shell money amazing food good atmosphere  C'est la vie Hearthstone  C'est la vie <EOR> Delicious Brunch yummy Tomahawk Steak dinner two just nice dinner family  Love Hearthstone <EOR> I've never liked food but always enjoyed atmosphere nice lounge patio   experience NYE never back  Reservations honored ticket prices increased 9 pm day terrible service    tried reaching management voice concerns didn't much acknowledgement  Horrible management service!!

Thank server Nathan such attentive service! <EOR> Yes large casino hotel while room sizeable small wine bar vibe  small plates really flavorful wine selection excellent cocktails pricey but worth it  Most importantly service friendly professional efficient overly institutionalized  Definitely worth visit  <EOR> Great place hang unwind! pleasure meet Taylor server friend   She made all worthwhile  Great place hang during happy hour $1 oysters Wednesday nights!! Highly recommended!! Come try out!! <EOR> Went Restaurant Week menu  first time dining Hearthstone   such cute place  Loved decor airiness it  Now important stuff   Food cocktails  BlackBerry Bliss mule refreshing delicious   must try lobster roll  Great app table  IMO  RW menu cheese plate flat iron steak nutella pizza   cheese plate least favorite item  used slices parm cheese  overtook prosciutto bread  flat iron steak cooked perfectly flavorful  nutella pizza nothing special  I'd definitely again try something different regular menu  <EOR> The food brunch amazing! However drinks awful  course 3 hours bottomless Bellini refilled 2 5 times the first glass served little over half full!   also ask waiter refill each time  Bellinis pre made served pitcher  tasted more peach juice hardly any champagne  bottomless bloody beers nothing special  would prefer bottomless bloody Mary's bottomless mimosas other local restaurants serve brunch  $70 75 bottle vodka bottle champagne your own drinks overpriced  staff friendly but unorganized slow  Won't back drinks but restaurant beautiful food delicious! <EOR> Worst service EVER!!! looking forward dinner here   made reservations 7 30 patio  told opening patio service would seated  No patio all 40mins waiting being told we're next watched others walk being seated patio!!! left next door Mercandito full restaurant found patio seating less 2 mins great service!!! <EOR> I met some friends dinner   parked outside entered through patio   Once entered door wasn't any signs where check but desk right looked could hostess stand   No but when turned left someone fixing pictures wall   asked where seated she told just wait until someone comes help then she turned back continued play pictures wall   wondered why she couldn't help felt really cold   eventually seated party   seated kitchen bad smell almost burnt grease oil   ordered lobster roll entrée   noticed right away fishy fresh smell   took little bite which confirmed wasn't fresh   didn't want complain front friends just didn't eat it   friends finished meal waiter took away food   don't know if didn't notice care entire meal still plate but no asked if meal OK if problem   still hungry asked desert menu    3 times!  third trip back served bill not desert menu    left hungry paid meal didn't eat   service horrible food horrible   returning restaurant   There's many other options town  <EOR> Took advantage Restaurant Week deals try Hearthstone  interior restaurant wasn't expected but liked it  thought would darker maybe little stuffy but actually bright open  staff very nice professional  started Apple Quinoa Salad which delicious! Restaurant Week menu ordered Crispy Calamari Hanger Steak Glazed Donut Bread Pudding dessert  calamari didn't really much flavor sauces came didn't much change that  Hanger Steak good but temperature meat seemed little cold when brought table  fries came also good paired well steak  really fan bread pudding but thought would better since glazed donut bread pudding  really much better  Softer typical bread puddings but still sucks all moisture your mouth  flavor wasn't bad but still bread pudding  also better other choice which Nutella Pizza  Tried little wasn't very exciting either  All all enjoyed experience but enough give extra star two  come back try some different items then perhaps update review  <EOR> I came into hearthstone past weekend best time  walked some friends quickly greeted friendly hostess  server super friendly full energy  made some great suggestions appetizers  Everything ordered amazing  pizza smelled wonderful server suggested nightly special swordfish watermelon salad which   vast wine selection great cocktails  favorite babymaker flower bomb  literally can't enough place ! <EOR> I never written bad review really wanted place cute trendy decor but extremely disappointing  Service very very slow server abrupt couldn't answer extremely basic questions menu items  server myself try cut everyone some slack but pretty substandard especially restaurant price point  Sunday brunch friend's birthday  ordered bottomless bellinis 24 dollars which only 3 over course 2 5 hrs while having wait 15 20 min finished each beverage  Also even though waiter said bottomless drinks pre made every drink received tasted extremely different being all champagne being extremely sweet juicy  same inconsistencies applied other bottomless bloody beers friends ordered first being extremely tomato based others being beer heavy  also ordered D  O  C  Pizza 18 dollars personal sized pizza which basically margarita pizza  would say 4 8 pieces just plain marinara nothing else not even cheese herbs other 4 pieces small circles lukewarm cheese 5 small pieces basil over entire pizza  friend ordered California Egg Benedict egg whites translucent runny inedible unless mostly raw egg  wanted send food back but since restaurant request friend birthday didn't want complain cause scene  Overall extremely awful excuse pizza drinks 42 bucks before tax tip honestly say little caesars take pizza inifnitely better  feel trendiness decor coupled wine charcuterie vibe place giving hype but would never return pay much food beverages brunch any other meal  Try Mercadito next door  Really great food delicious cocktails   I've server high end restaurants years spending money never issue long food drink quality service worth but definitely hearthstone  wouldn't pay half paid  <EOR> Really good food  bit pricey  But excellent flavor  shrimp pasta  friend parpadelle  Both really great pastas  finished off peanut butter lava cake which amazing well soufflé which good  <EOR> Hearthstone taken page HoneySalt playbook look full rustic homey elements cozy dining environment  transformation space formerly occupied Hachi remarkable  space more inviting its dark decor open kitchen two long bars lounge area patio   Small plates dominatef menu allowing diners sample plenty eats  Several salads available  wild arugula $12 combines some wonderful flavors citrus poached leeks toasted hazelnuts ricotta although leeks least favorite element crunchy texture slight bitterness proving offputting  much better option roasted heirloom beets $14   Tender chunks beets sat atop bed whipped ricotta goat cheese lemon thyme adding some brightness dish along bit crunch pistachios   Dishes all beautifully presented but always successful  tuna carpaccio $14 lacked focus  overpowering sweetness avocado plenty acidity tomatoes drowned flavor fish while flower petal garnish didn't add anything profile dish  Thankfully more savory options butcher steak tartare $14 meatballs $13 delivered making main ingredients stars supporting elements heightened flavors each   For those want larger portions entrees available well  wagyu short rib $28 dish perfect cooler weather  hearty savory stout braised beef vegetables comfort food its best   Their dessert list full options return sample  lone dessert tried almond chocolate chip souffle  Restrained sweetness silken warm texture made perfect soothing soul tastebuds   Hearthstone doesn't forget younger audience either  kid's menu available plenty favorites  pizza available where kids add own toppings table resulting dish then brought back kitchen cooked  Chicken fingers menu but unfortunately kid found them hard underseasoned   Expect higher prices due quality ingredients overall superior quality food compared most other Summerlin spots  may everyone but Light Group created restaurant unique part town dishes more commonly associated Strip 'burbs  <EOR> Probably worst service all restaurants Red Rock casino Downtown Summerlin plaza across Charleston combined  Shame trying place multiple times hoping next visit would better  food isn't bad but great either  Based food quality alone I'd rather eat franchise spots Yardhouse BJ's  Both less few hundred yards away Last visit say wife two kids  First given 1 menu   about 5 min later able flag down waitress ask other menus  Then brought 2nd menu  few minutes later she comes take order where turn ask kids happy hour beverage menu? watched tables next seated orders taken way before all menus  order handful items couple drinks beer wine   Food came decent time plates bussed timely manner water refilled regularity can't knock buss beverage staff  When wanted order another round beverages waitress M I A  when wanted call more food only god knew where waitress was  When finally second glass wine already Asked check didn't bother finish wine  spoke manager just let know if experience  He offered usual free dessert drink but told just won't back    There many other restaurants par literal walking distance one  just wait until place runs lease next restaurant concept moves in  other options would suggest anything else red rock  Even sister restaurant Saluté act together    After restaurant's generic response Oh yea just reminded restaurant's response bottomless wings promotion  wife both opt $10 each which no biggie  bright refills once  basically $10 9 wings  Hardly bottomless but already done place don't want anything else place  God forbid kick down napkins table kids too  garbage service place    think service concession stand inside theater better place  <EOR> I visited hearthstone other night family couldn't happier service  waiter Ryan super polite very handsome! <EOR> Way over priced ok unimpressive meal  Ordered bacon wrapped dates app  Took long time portion 3 served odd combination marinara sauce  main dishes French dip burger just ok  French dip mushy bit bland came slightly cold  side mashers also bleh runny opinion didn't much flavor  Ordered pineapple cake dessert ok  best tasting item specialty ice cream came pineapple cake  Overall felt restaurant couldn't decide wanted upscale casual but definitely charges upscale price mediocre food  When live Vegas far better tasting options! <EOR> Still same  Unfortunately don't customer service place  Last time give chance  Service everything town just don't figured out  Won't going back  <EOR> The first time came food amazing service over top  time much  find someone come take drink order  finally decided take food order  Forget any drink refills  Food just ok shame because set standard when first opened did come close time around  even bother going back  <EOR> Went last night meet friends drinks appetizers happy hour menu   Told water right front  doing   Two ordered call vodka we're informed wasn't happy hour menu which fine with   showed waiter understood interest special menu    Imagine surprise when

Even wine happy hour   He knew exactly he doing tried Upsell everything thinking wouldn't notice   complained waited forever teenage manager attempt fix but late movie  Finally appetizers adjusted but she forgot wine     The whole thing seemed recent Wells Fargo situation   Low lever employees pushed things improve bottom line expense customer   Never going back  <EOR> The interior design felt restaurant trying little hard  believe going rustic Italian American kind feel but honesty looked bit clashing eyes when comparing furniture  irked bit  When food came disappointed portion sizes    Then food came drum roll bad above average   The staff extremely friendly  No complaints just positive remarks them speed personableness    Good place but potential better! <EOR> Great looking place  Food good  Ran into issue where card double charged but spoke manager he apologized took care everything  going back soon  <EOR> Food pretty good  Service better  flat iron steak below par  salmon pork neck far above par  chopped salad SO  desserts above average pineapple upside down chocolate dessert which don't remember name wasn't special all  Atmosphere upbeat decor refreshing  Cant complain because tv's everywhere games on!!!! specials intriguing back!!! <EOR> Went brunch noon daughter 1year old niece 10 years old   3 friends joining later brunch mimosas  restaurant fairly busy  two large parties plus dining room full people  patient  server understand when things hectic  asked move lounge area since short tables taken isn't possible put high chair booths  daughter year old also gave more room run around  seated 12 10pm  Moved 12 18pm  server greeted herself asked if dining just waiting seated  told dining wanted drinks around 12 20 ordered drinks  Then she didn't come back she serving all other tables around but us  12 47 two hungry upset children me hadn't eaten all morning  All tables around eaten some able eat leave before server even offered food  called over manager supervisor danielle  Danielle apologized turned experience around  food arrived shortly 1 pm kids finally happy  food delicious  If wasn't Danielle wouldn't come back because bad service  no reason should neglect particular table 20 30 minutes  used because color skin  Typically people don't serve put all into because young black think won't tip something  But server myself  pride myself customer service speed service  would hope treated way when places  won't post servers name because towards end when all friends arrived she became faster  Also some tables left believe she more time serve us  restaurant 4 stars because management  Good management break establishment  <EOR> My family coming since opened never ceases amaze me  only great experience but due hostess no longer works management reached rectify situation    Absolutely love food drinks employees  treat family which nice nowadays  <EOR> When arrived told 30 minute wait but least 10 open clean tables   They called 15 minutes later table ready  After sitting table 10 minutes watching others getting seated menus water etc  called hostess over  She brought menus told server right there  Another 5 minutes until server came over thanked patience asked if wanted water  ordered water  then watched another table that seated us take order  point walked out  <EOR> Hearthstone five star eatery! atmosphere inviting relaxing  staff exceptionally friendly very nice  food amazing!

Great flavors even toast came good    The short rib meat balls very tasty  steak tartar poached egg really great but actually wish toast came didn't truffle  Usually love truffle but think overpowered tartar bit hard finish all that  Next time ask plain toast think! lollipop wings cooked perfectly nice crispy but actually think buffalo sauce thick tasted ordinary like something much cheaper place such good cut wings  bacon wrapped dates because said extra gave very sweet them good but wouldn't ordered because crazy bacon dates bit thick sweet me  shrimp pasta since multiple waiters recommended surprisingly loving it! can't put finger but just did wow but shrimp good quality  also truffle hanger steak which good but incredible    For desserts chocolate chip soufflé peanut butter lava cake  soufflé definitely good but amazing enough actively crave it  peanut butter cake good well but again perfect  comes some sort butterscotch pudding think? which actually think did very well  actually interfered peanut butter flavor sort overpowered all sweetness butterscotch flavor  I'd say something similar roasted banana ice cream  If just banana ice cream would worked better because roasted ness made much sweeter like more saccharine didn't pair well already really sweet cake   Once pushed all aside cake itself really good well made good flavor    Overall am leaving rating 4 stars because although enjoy many things am obsessed enough dishes expensive everything is  price mostly reflects quality but some flavors each dish could tweaked wow more really deserve money because some dishes bit unbalanced flavors  sure back though! <EOR> I really love Hearthstone  first experience them last Thanksgiving plans fell through visit family left wandering around looking where eat Thanksgiving meal  saw Hearthstone doing endless turkey dinner husband LOVED it  really saved Thanksgiving us  If again year don't feel cooking try it!
