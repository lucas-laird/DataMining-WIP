Good selection toppings except gummy worms VERY hard  Good thing only put two  Also actual yogurt selection sort weird? flavor offered weren't appealing all  Other place looked pretty clean cashier talked nice  definitely try something different next time come LV! two stars hard toppings weird flavors  <EOR> Wanted check place basically because cookie dough scoops    she making crepe another customer looked mouth watering try too  chocolate chip cookie dough which good but amazing  Still worth trip try though! But crepe off charts good! banana strawberry Nutella one  good! lady super sweet friendly  <EOR> Worst frozen yoghurt ever had  melted rather fast fruit frozen waste money time calories  staff having conversation amongst themselves ignored even forgot give spoon  I'd give 0 rating if could  <EOR> Taro tasted chocolate  Regular vanilla icy tasted horrible  Can't understand mess yogurt?For first time life didn't finish dessert  Overpriced $15 two yogurts <EOR> At time visit Malenas very empty but very HUGE  Nice frozen yogurt shop within treasure island hotel casino floor    I ordered plain tart frozen yogurt which build yourself i e put toppings desire huge selection 10oz total @ $7 00  Tasted good self service price friendly  <EOR> There lot service helped myself   really happy flavors just hotel   115 degrees outside FoYo order cool off!  excellent stop fabulous snack! <EOR> Rude employees overpriced yogurt  Avoid place prevent dealing snobby old ladies  <EOR> This first time eating dessert here   scope strawberry ice cream which great  staff suggested try nutty monkey crepe   very nice did!  great   definitely come back <EOR> I am sure why place such bad ratings here  4 stars 15 reviews trip advisor seems closer mark me  Aside high price on strip no surprise no big issues    We came three times during stay across street all flavors tried delicious  couldn't enough mango boba things it! Highly recommend  <EOR> Dessert always good option late night  being lobby floor Treasure Island hotel made convenient sugar fix  Their chocolate butter pecan ice creams tasty $3 50 single scoop   Their chocolate strawberries much  chocolate didn't really great taste disappointed that  two $3 wasn't bad  You'd think place hotel would super expensive but luckily wasn't overpriced  <EOR> I don't even write negative reviews very often but case feel compelled  Worst froyo experience EVER believe lot them  tart yogurt didn't light refreshing taste should instead resembled thick frozen sour milk  All fruit offered toppings inedible looking  candy stale hard  husband each chose smaller cup only filled half way  total $13 63  Outrageous even tourist trap   and what's worse inedible threw trash  Wish gambled away $13 instead place awful  <EOR> Expensive quality bad compare yogurt land  Strawberry flavor off weird taste  definitely come back  <EOR> Yum! good simple froyo place Treasure Island located first floor right before hit casino across Pizzeria  Froyo $0 45 per ounce just many toppings Yogurtland  favorite far lychee consistency almost sorbet  There's also no sugar added yogurts which somewhat healthier  think fewer flavors typically Yogurtland   They also variety crepes waffles ice cream sandwiches look great well definitely hoping try some more    For kids somewhat guilt free dessert definitely isn't bad option if you're staying here  menu other items also decently expansive something everyone  <EOR> The flavored all bad except lychee  Even plain bad    does even happen <EOR> Too expensive but kidding? Vegas where price gauge you  Froyo $0 65 per ounce you're going end very small cup frozen yogurt if want keep costs low  think froyo place inside Mirage even more expensive $0 79 per ounce place actually cheap compared Mirage  haha <EOR> This place isn't bad all negative reviews claim   I'm local very anxious try edible cookie dough  wasn't impressed taste wasn't horrible just tasted sitting while  sampled all three flavors choc  chip peanut butter jelly butter pecan half scoop chocolate chip because full scoop much larger your typical scoop would way much consume opinion  also scoop butter pecan cone  They extra star because staff incredibly helpful offering samples opinions flavors etc   Their prices weren't horrible reading but  probably because used Vegas prices  wouldn't way come back but if ever inside Treasure Island craving something sweet I'd return! <EOR> Spent $7 49 froyo tossed trash 2 bites  Why? Extremely nasty aftertaste melted extremely quick flavors off   Do yourself favor don't come here  wasted money regret having read any Yelp reviews before coming here  other Yelpers spot on reviews  <EOR> So hot day decided grab some yogurt since area  outside very appealing clean well organized which nice inviting why stop right     wrong yogurt      Well serve serve ounce topping bar dress like  vanilla know plain lol $3 scoop cookie dough because say signature let's just say very underwhelmed  cookie dough soggy which didn't even know possible yogurt vanilla weird taste  only thing saves place dress your yogurt anyway want really clean which nice self serve place    Just know if pay premium frozen yogurt but product could lot better guessing  why pretty empty  If around  35 ounce would par quality yogurt  personally wouldn't Patronize establishment again <EOR> I came specifically raw cookie dough even reading bad reviews try myself  reviews accurate  terrible right garbage  Couldn't even eat it  funny artificial taste fresh sweet share raw cookie dough  employee put microwave which thought even more disgusting  refund would nice!

The yogurt fine  raspberry mango yogurts cool different flavored bobba  But asking tip off bill felt aggressive unnecessary move  <EOR> Their shakes pretty decent Banana Bread Pudding! Their yogurt solid thumbs down though  just plain good  If you're mood froyo yourself favor find PinkBerry YogurtLand  <EOR> I stopped some time kill before Mystere show next door started   started pour some yogurt machines just liquid goop   approached cashier she told 2 dispensers broken would call someone take look   another dispenser same thing happened   now she embarrassed started mark multiple dispensers broken   I managed some chocolate cappuccino swirl mango strawberry swirl   surprised expensive tiny portion $6 some change   strawberry mango swirl tasted nothing those flavors   consistency yogurt wasn't great well really icy   Overall really disappointed pricing taste yogurt    worst frozen yogurt tried  <EOR>
