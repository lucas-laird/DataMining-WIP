Rolls between $25 $30 comparable rolls costing half much most sushi restaurants  food medium quality meaning bad but certainly top pack   Yet prices easily highest seen sushi     Most dishes heavy sugary sauce them too   We spent almost $150 per person food service worth $35   left hungry   regularly eat great Sushi places both California New York wouldn't back Andrea's even if prices reasonable    But considering price advice look elsewhere!  simply many good restaurants overpay mediocre food lazy service  <EOR> Our dinner first night Andrea's  food atmosphere service beyond!

Looks he done night  counted 11 waiters once did come if needed another drink if time clear plates etc  all busy chatting each other  took awhile even receiving check  worst part friend never sang happy bday little dessert  main reason!      husband eventually look someone share experience  guess guy manager simply said sorry hear walked away  Later he found bar outside  He asked if plans would another drink    told already guest list Intrigue  where planned going next  He made sure didn't line friend would complimentary drink  guess nice part but still won't change service receive when come eat here       What's funny before asked couple locals lived area if recommended restaurant all but some did say place awesome food but service horrible  Should listened!!! <EOR> This truly next level stuff! expecting great food service when coming Vegas yet place only met but exceeded expectations  Sure everything perfect but which more made it    Everything starting food ending service point  pulled all stops which especially surprising considering package including ticket Le Rêve review coming soon   package included everything even gratuities!  P S  If want see Le Rêve call package absolutely worth it   In terms flavors once again reference B B  King  am told man could play three notes could bring tears  case dishes small uncomplicated but play just right notes your taste buds sing    I can't remember many specifics but remember + Salmon Sashimi Quality fish amazing  Fish delicate animal  Sauces marinades greatly enhance flavor but incredibly easy overdo it  especially liked wasn't drenched sauce  option try salmon pure form spread sauce wanted  little touch green also nice especially person always screaming balance    + Hamachi Even though fish lays small bed sauce did find overwhelming  However fairness must say found flavor little astringent  flavors certainly but didn't really work me  Also what's peanut? seems little extra opinion   + Five Spice Calamari really liked different interpretation dish  All calamari previously breaded fried  far purer  However dish little delicate taste  flavors calamari greens allowed shine but found myself asking five spices were  pinch more spice spritz more sauce dressing would done dish wonders    + Miso Black Cod Now back things enjoyed more! Unfortunately also where memory becomes little more imperfect  Everything dish well flavors marinades combination textures  only critique rather large leaves bibb lettuce  just personally fan large leaves dish   + Pork Belly Poutine pork belly prepared two ways before here  them fried seasoned S P only braised all sorts sauces  Frying grilling gives nice crispness dish whereas braising much softer more delicate  best both worlds  some crispness but same time delicate flavor braising  poutine also extremely delicate flavorful sauce!  Bravo! When return Vegas happily bring decent chunk paycheck eat regular menu  <EOR> My boyfriend took early Valentine's Day dinner we're LA lengthy list incredible restaurants  However Andrea's completely blew minds topped list best dining experience ever had!

We started round cocktails $16 piece  don't exactly remember ordered but damn delicious  Light refreshing    could downed 3 those babies but knew would drinking concert just cocktail dinner  didn't bother apps right ordering  2 each ordered Impossible burger sliders which actually $25 app another friend couple sushi rolls while other friend veggie stir fry dish believe? Anyway considering didn't actually order entrees plenty food meal  If yet heard Impossible Burger look up  plant based red meat it isn't really meat duh   But made look cook taste even sizzle red meat  Seriously watch videos  way sliders prepared delicious! am meat eater through through if told sliders actually red meat don't think would able tell  Now did take some meat alone could taste without bun sauce everything else put sliders  When did could definitely tell did true taste red meat since bit different taste  BUT sliders fantastic wouldn't hesitate order them again if ever found myself back Andrea's!
