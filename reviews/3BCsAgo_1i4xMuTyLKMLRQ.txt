I would definitely come back try some other dishes especially healthy ones  If come during meal rushes prepared order take wait table since don't very many big place begin with  Maybe expand someday relieve some traffic hopefully new location closer me! <EOR> Wow impressed place  heaven  eat without feeling deprived  decided eat skinny finance fat  Good compromise if ask me    Healthy fat? Pick your poison  Warning both delicious generous portions    Scrambled burrito egg whites chicken spinach avocado pico  Yum! huge size  could barely finish it  took each bite taste buds never felt if getting cheated    We decided try skinny ahi tuna taco shrimp taco  tuna gross  soft shell just soft  Actually would say soggy  Everything just melted together  no crunch  shrimp taco way better tasting  However previous taco  fat choice  bummer eat fork fell apart unable eaten  Boo  Tacos  eaten hands!  My fiancé's entree choice another fat option  fried jalapeño steak sandwich French fries  soon hubby infatuated spicy but boy did bring tears eyes  Usually asks extra hot add salsa kick notch  time ladies gentlemen! He peeling open trying take jalapeños  Guess there's first time everything    Can't wait come back some towners update review! <EOR> We tried again time couple days before thanksgiving weekday lunchtime  Compared first time line sane scene chill mob scene encountered last time  worked well favor along fact researched decided wanted among extensive menu beforehand last time felt lot pressure due long line behind each menu item having lots different ingredients understand  your homework first!  We managed table polite fast service! Among smoothie juices tried hangover remedy garden treat delightful cucumber  all good  If expect Jamba juice amount sweetness no more adult version beets cucumbers sweet  entrees More Cowbell Meltdown Smoke bowl Hot Chix  Hot Chix spicy! fried jalapenos   I really liked good value $10  Smoke bowl bit weird actually tasted better next day's leftovers  More Cowbell favorite high quality beef lots veggies  Meltdown just big honkin' patty melt made 2 meals  little greasy side but  point  toddler fell asleep way she missed meal until later night  children's meals good value chicken offered grilled  Compare 4 95 chicken meal Chik Fil A good deal    I thought going expand restaurant but still pretty tiny  if hit busy day which imagine very often overwhelming  <EOR> I Skinnyfats first time last week absolutely loved food! Hangover juice which perfect texture just right amount sweetness  Others group all thoroughly enjoyed food well  Also would highly recommend sweet potato fries  Yum! definitely back  <EOR> This only location SkinnyFATS ever say wasn't super impressed site  probably least favorite set ordering food could exist  don't know other locations but counter order give number  then find seat bring your food out  entire space extremely small too  maybe fit 25 people actual seats  busy when sit bar seating which looks window airport  fun watching planes while ate least  wouldn't keep coming back but said least favorite way food joint set wish bigger    That all said OMG FOOD THOUGH  liked everything except Ahi Taco   Nothing bad just didn't fit particular palate  didn't thick strong tortilla part tasted thought covered flavor inside bit    The Slow Boat China Blue Balsamic salad superb Balls 2 0 absolutely necessary!! wish four smaller balls instead two big ones just ease eating but good  diet soda prefer Coke Pepsi own brand but wasn't bad    I know review sounds mostly bad but believe isn't  just easy pick little problems when place popular  food worth it  If haven't SkinnyFATS go! Also pokestop  Some players set some lures while some cool Pokemon while ate due pretty decent experience  <EOR> The service location deserves five stars  Super upbeat friendly staff seem genuinely happy there    My food however just wasn't very good  Chix Broadway fried chicken bacon sandwich lettuce tomato onion special sauce side truffle fries because came highly recommended Yelp  Upon biting into sandwich noticed chicken almost burnt whole thing pretty lacking flavor  sure if just forgot add salt chicken breading if always but even boyfriend agreed surprisingly bland    Generous portion sizes but probably wouldn't order particular dish again  Hopefully just fluke  <EOR> Awesome place    Ask Lana she'll hook even if you're pick eater myself   Cool vibe good food choose    skinny fat!

The menu clever staff fun  I really enjoyed place  <EOR> In dessert Las Vegas felt famished healthy food  watched enough food documentaries Netflix scare s making hard stomach sugar salt GMOs everything else said give cancer  just doesn't taste right anymore  say? Fear does something your taste buds   So desperation paid over $10 cab take three miles SkinnyFats  cab driver questioned us  He pulled nondescript strip side highway  looked row offices maybe even call centers  He sure it? He even took menu sure legit restaurant! second trip because sure back cab driver gave cell number could ride back  No taxis going joint  SkinnyFATS locals cars tourists us   Both times freshly pressed juice reusable cups  YUM  home loved sodium saturated MSG ridden stuff we'd suckered into eating friends   The food scrumptious  menu divided into two sections  First skinny   all healthy food  other part fat which isn't quite healthy  chicken waffles grilled chicken breast chicken waffles fried chicken  it? Brilliant   Heck! loved SkinnyFATS much plan incorporate into next trip  We're going Grand Canyon fly into Vegas  thrilled realize could SkinnyFATS before three hour drive canyon then again when come back! cheers that! <EOR> Good concept but if getting food hurry  Took 45mins another custumer togo food  Both called 15 20mins before then wait 30 35mins inside! Its togo reason dont wait  late somewhere other custumer but having already paid all could wait  other custumer really upset kept asking order sat waited waited  Aparently dine custumers food before togo custumers higher priority?! come now  excited food but wait some parts came cold even looking good  red velvet waffle looks nice pix but togo mess pizza box spend another 5mins arranging myself  other food items pretty mediocre overpriced  Portions big size however  juice cold pressed sure explain wasnt really fresh squeezed but still 9$  Paid almost 50$ food being cold bad presentation really disappointed wait time price quality overall  guess charge packaging atmosphere because place kind hard find too  only give another try if eat order go  bad because excited place bookmarked while  <EOR> Hot mess nachos!!! Changed life lol much better expected  Must try Vegas especially if you're buffet burnt out  good food  Note Hawaiian bun definitely adds sweetness any burger  through off when ordered cherry popper  Still delicious respect where going    just taste  would prefer plain bun  But back! <EOR> Decided give something different try birthday meal   am glad Skinnny Fats top pick   location very odd industrial area many people would overlook if did know great restaurant existed here   space itself very tiny seating 40 people tops always feels busy inside    The menu Jekyll Hyde feel because some items appear very healthy some appear gluttonous   No worries pick latter every time     I selected Chix Broadway Truffle Fries   crispy fried chicken breast sandwich great portion   ask some more lemon aioli slather but crispy lettuce tomato bacon perfect topping trifecta   fires little under done but still delicious     The Unbrierevable another item selected did disappoint taste buds   combination strawberries chocolate sauce tender melted brie cheese crispy waffle amazing   french inspired dish gluttony definitely satisfied taste buds    The downfall location size   am sure why Warm Spring's location triple size outdoor patio   back when neighborhood  <EOR> Came visit Vegas  boyfriend looking Yelp found place! looked great sucker visuals photos did regret coming all! think concept restaurant absolutely amazing! health conscious side healthy side but everything sounds amazing because such great selection kind twist some things  names plates super fun give off great vibe! inside restaurant such creative design! staff very friendly informative menu making choice wasn't hard! But options keep thinking    I live LA always think going here! PLEASE COME LA  <EOR> Really enjoyed food style ambiance charm  But especially food  Restaurants soar food above all else really nail presentation quality taste  definitely back   My only gripe location speed  located way off beaten path  would also highly reccomend getting second register maybe greeter help explain menu as long speed order taking process  <EOR> This places when visiting Las Vegas  Great food both sides Healthy  Happy menu  fan Happy side menu though if you're coming Vegas must have  <EOR> This place ridiculously priced mediocre food  impressed no intentions going back  don't remember name ordered but cucumber sliced crap $11 later sonics behind since starving! <EOR> I best experience Skinnyfats  never before  eat very clean diet often challenging eat out  Cayla took order Collin answered any specific questions menu  He extremely knowledgeable menu  absolutely no problem substituting items making changes meet needs  often feel bad asking but Cayla Collin acted no big deal all which very nice  ordered bean burger substituted bean patty turkey patty lettuce wrap instead bun sweet potato fries  guy does eat healthy cherry popper burger Snicker doodle cookies  order go  When home order exactly ordered delicious!!! both enjoyed dinner much back following night try breakfasts dinner  Again order needed substitutions no problem all  guy Cowboy Killer Benedict  Again both breakfasts delicious! ate time Collin came ask everything asked previous night's dinner well  definitely back  FINALLY found place accommodate clean eating also serves delicious goodness guy! <EOR> This dean martin location   quite few times   The concept behind SkinnyFats offer menu both things could considered healthy skinny happy fat     both!    This location quite small limited seating though because popularity place almost always packed    However once seated food delicious many friends brought all agree   Just few suggestions foods there's much good stuff try Tu Nuts to die for    Spicy ahi tuna sriracha slaw cucumber boat w almonds teriyaki avocado sriracha aioli   refreshing delicious yet don't feel ate much     REDiculous Red velvet waffle cream cheese frosting berries chocolate w applewood bacon those just love dessert doesn't? Berry Steak Flatbread w shaved NY strip feta goat cheese arugula blackberries balsamic   variety food vast   There's something everyone    There really nothing ordered wasn't really good   Come few people try share few things!  guarantee you'll love all offerings   Tip Sundays offer always different Sunday Sundae    Just look photos Yelp   crazy good way!  Tip #2 Jalapeno ketchup Good  <EOR> Total hipster vibes here! Reminds hipster hole walls back Cali! Super Small location industrial plaza which think very weird place restaurant but super dope menu options  chicken waffles really good however chicken did lack bit seasoning  They've stuff everyone menu vegans hard core meat eaters  Very diverse! Just don't come lunch time because packed!  love old school cherry soda strangely enough really drink cups if  even thing! Oh sell variety different ketchup Branded them! Some them very interesting careful because pour container! Overall pretty good experience just don't come peak time  <EOR> Food outstanding! Whoever created menu concept genius  Staff friendly attentive  just can't give 5 stars because service  If order lemonade or Arnold Palmer prepared your food you'll ask it    Fries cold if come aren't busy but main dishes prepare amazing  Great food back    just often would like  <EOR> Service great  menu sounds delicious but food horrible  ordered zucc pasta which zucchini pasta marinara veggies  Added filet mignon protein ended spending $19  wanted medium rare well done  worth it  Worst part ended getting food poisoning  said great service but probably only time sick  going say stay away place because other stuff menu sound good just going suggest zucc pasta  <EOR> Love coming place!!!! wide selection healthy non healthy choices  Keep mind early weekends could wait table moves pretty quick but wait  Staff very friendly prompt!   All dishes very delicious!!!! something everyone menu!   A definitely must try check out!!!! Cant wait Henderson location open! <EOR> SkinnyFATS yummy awesome!

Highly recommend place! <EOR> I typically really love Skinnyfats but recently really lacked proper attention  Sometimes call food stand wait 15 20 minutes getting when called 15 20 minutes ahead time  doesn't seem there's any sense urgency anyone really cares  watch them pack orders delivery services mine sits waits ranch  Since opened more locations fear location suffers neglect  hope once complete renovations more room work more effective manner puts guests needs first  time no longer ordering does benefit wait long orders especially fried chicken salad  <EOR> Food very tasty variety beverages nice  DAMN coffee strong    Only downfall very few tables    Yummy <EOR> Just epic meal skinnyfats!! place super chill staff helpful friendly  great Benedict burger only reason able eat whole thing because damn delicious   mom smoke 'n bowl which indescribably delicious  pops Dang Quesadilla which good mom claimed ownership halfway through meal  Oh speaking moms no meal would complete hot mame edemame sweet chilli sauce Thanks guys!! <EOR> I SkinnyFats around 4 5 times now seems hit miss  company recently moved same business complex SkinnyFats convenient place eat when don't time leave office I never eaten restaurant because its always busy am going wait rush table  order food online delivered walk pick up  only BLT both happy healthy both good bad  healthy option turkey bacon gotten twice good both times  bad part fruit  horrible tasted old  wish taken picture it  happy option normal bacon 2 3 times  first time good next two times could barely finish it  last time bacon mostly squishy fat  truffle fries really good  eat them fresh hot if cold taste funny  Overall all its cool place update review when try something else  <EOR> The name establishment oxymoron Jumbo Shrimp Anaheim Ducks Hockey   can't Skinny Fat same time right?  Some guys coming close!  concept restaurant very original   Create two distinct menus appeals foodies all types   health conscious zero f***ks given camp   Guess am!? Exactly time SkinnyFATS spent browsing fat portion menu   did quick browse healthy side honest some items would order TBLT   gordo's choices plentiful   ended splitting 2 dishes  CHIX Broadway Sweet Cheese Us   CHIX Broadway best chicken sandwich ever had   fried breast enormous spilled over sides bun   crunchy tasty crispy   sensory overload taste buds   Sweet Cheese very good well but CHIX star meal day     The location off strip industrial part town   very accessible those leaving Vegas headed back towards LA since runs parallel 15 freeway   Seating problem its very small first come first serve   place huge gathering   If time while Las Vegas area definitely check place out   type food getting place exceptional value        Pros Parking  Cons hard find  Small seating area crowded cause long wait times <EOR> What fun place grab dinner!!!  little hidden business park sits industrial area off Dean Martin   I only drove past twice trying find it! Hahaha  I heard place few friends done eating same old thing dinners decided finally try SkinnyFATS   The restaurant small 8 tables long window bar stools sit at   TV watch decor hip paintings walls fruits vegetables   As soon walked young lady did name immediately knew never before   guess stuck sore thumb!  hahahaha  Anyway she guided through menu explaining differences between Healthy skinny dishes Happy fat dishes   could even order breakfast if wanted served all day   I settled Berry Steak '  flat bread shaved NY steak feta goat cheeses arugula balsamic reduction blackberries   also grabbed side salad soda   The side salad though simple delicious   Lettuce tomato few other veggies ranch dressing   Free refills soda!  Can't Dr  Pepper!  The flat bread delicious!!!!!!  Nice combo sweet berries balsamic peppery arugula    also nice texture crunchiness flat bread soft warm creaminess cheeses   only critique being picky flat bread little hard cut knife could cut into more manageable pieces eat   think maybe pre cutting into 4 pieces it's square shape might helpful   The staff extremely friendly totally willing answer questions menu various dishes   gave number sat table then delivered when meal ready   I highly enjoyed meal vibe am looking forward going back   Thanks SkinnyFats!  new fan!!!! <EOR> Wow good find while leaving Vegas! impressed service taste prices! brought family breakfast spot everyone loved experience  cinutella French toast just flat churro super sugary double fried   recommend definitely stick pancakes  Also snake eye amazing!! <EOR> There reason finding parking space standing line food bad thing chases weak adventure  Healthy hearty options weird yummy combinations reign  Eating siracha mango ahi taco breakfast now  <EOR> This place all hype gone be! Food amazing employees friendly! Everything fresh goood! Definitely recommend reduclious red velvet waffle!  Yummmmmm! <EOR> Five stars place  food amazing delicious  ordered Cherry Popper add avocado bacon Wake N Bacon Hot Mess sunny side up  love everything here  staff very friendly helpful  Keep SkinnyFATS  <EOR> It's quite pricey when start adding all items entree sides drink  smoothie though great many already wrote  SkinnyFATS Punch $6 95 delicious  fresh refreshing walking around such dry hot place    I also Zucc $7 95 without any additional protein which additional cost enjoyed it  did order takeout didn't taste freshness but felt good option vegan meal  flavorful various vegetables sauce  truffle fries $3 95 side underwhelming  would return but try different items  <EOR> Amazing place!  Everything exceptionally good twice during visit Vegas  Tried tomato soup which point almond french toasts  Small place but regret your visit eating such goodness  <EOR> The food tasty each dish seems nice twist common flavors  menu seems constant rotation difficult pin down favorite menu item when menu constantly changes    The only negatives dining area incredibly small price high side  enjoyable every once while but cost prohibitive most usual spot  <EOR> This little spot placed spontaneously within industrial park setting minute thought made terrible terrible choice  turns really delicious! store packed Friday noon but still better any burger spot strip   You tell easily most customers locals just ordered mix whatever people ahead did includes waffle fried chicken which haven't since forever  All food good really really fresh chicken sandwich juicy wouldn't believe you're actually desert second   I intrigued menu both healthy side happy side unhealthy side if tried some both no regrets  nutshell don't feel concerned when see no cars parked area nearby buildings look shabby because really there  Just walk hope table enjoy  <EOR> Let start saying SkinnyFATS BEST sweet potato fries ever had   seriously unbeatable   also never actually eat only ordered online delivery keep mind review exclusively food   quality very consistent each time totally worth $10 sandwich price   only reason 4 stars wheat bun use many sandwiches incredibly thick little overwhelming rest sandwich   If portobello burgers Vegwich seriously delicious little spicy little messy   couple bites ended using fork  <EOR> SkinnyFats? Doesn't cancel each other out? Anyways area decided stop see they're all since seem see everybody check almost every other day   First all place kind bit hard find  located suite amongst other industrial businesses pretty large sized business complex  Typically setting find popular café in  Parking frustrating well since many other suites equals lot parking    When come see only register would say 7 8 medium tables  If don't see line going door then lucky just avoided lunch dinner rush  If stuck rush better decent amount time allotted anywhere any time soon  Remember waiting line putting your order waiting your food come put together equals lot patience because all those people ordered ahead same boat  takes time your food since everything made scratch   With said ordered Burger Benedict which half pound angus beef patty lettuce tomato pickles avocado fried egg special SkinnyFats sauce  also accompanied side truffle fries which large enough portion share another  fries good two different flavored ketchups available tables which Balsamic Vinegar Jalapeno refer pic    All all very good  Its just parking location long wait brought down 3 star  think bigger place more accessible location couple more registers would perfect    Sidenote free wifi  Domain skinnyfats  Password eatskinnyfats2  <EOR> My new favorite place!  quinoa burger world!!

Absolutely recommend place! <EOR> I first discovered SkinnyFATS 2013 Bite Las Vegas enjoyed much sought brick mortar establishment soon thereafter     First let say am glad opened second larger location few miles away one!  While enjoyed everything ever ordered just pain coming location   really conveniently located near anything very limited parking bit nightmare perpetual line order sometimes long door   Unfortunately once actually order seating limited 8 tables bar along window you're usually left awkwardly holding your number hoping someone finishes snag table before your food comes     This trip ordered Smoke Bowl $10 00 Agave BBQ chicken peppers onion pineapple over brown rice w black bean salsa cilantro lime yogurt   first time ordered Loved it!  looks more Disaster bowl Smoke but tasted Awesome bowl!  All acidic flavors blended well together yogurt large chicken tenderloins juicy delicious   would definitely order again   My friend ordered Naked Chix add avocado $7 50 plus $1 avocado Seared chicken breast mango basil sauce over brown rice w cilantro yogurt   ordered before enjoyed slightly sweet chicken but think bowl far more satisfying option   She still hungry when left   Some other items tried loved past CauliFIRE Chix Broadway Cherry Popper Burger Sweet Potato Fries   All solid options opinion   A note used carry Coke products online menu still reflects however switched Boylan products while back but unsweetened Passion Iced Tea wonderful! <EOR> Love place best chicken waffles!! staff always kind food never disappoints  <EOR> I've tried variety menu items including the TBLT God Fries Shroomin' Philly chicken waffles  all those items think enjoyed God Fries most while everything else okay  God fries chicken feta other things made nice contrast flavors textures  If order Shroomin' Philly just note vegetarian because no beef all  might better off ordering Phatty Philly even if Happy Side  deceived picture thought meat until started eating sandwich  chicken waffles pretty standard but definitely no wow factor  sure ask maple syrup side because little bit much liking  haven't ordered items but tried them another person's plate Tu nuts Ahi Sirachi tacos Naked chicks all which very tasty highly recommend!

Didn't much room spare  <EOR> Disappointed but am docking Skinnyfats star  based both dining once fact increased prices many items    I try Skinnyfats person last week coworker  small room crowded seating  line almost door seemed lack organization regard people ordering food versus people picking orders    After ordering taking seat table seemed excessive wait food all which came different times  always hate eating while person still waiting meal    also hate when food cold because waited fellow diner meal    All aside food good  once again skinny bowl which less runny time around  also Little Gobbler which excellent  way made sure grab menu   Fast forward 1 week  all set place delivery order Skinnyfats when noticed many items wanted listed higher prices paper menu picked just week prior  Examples Mr Green cold pressed juice $7 50 last week  now $9 50  All juices $2 Skinny Bowl $8 75 last week  now $9 75  Flat Chix Greens $8 last week  now $9 50   What noticed frustrated regarding prices increases some items menu notes indicating ingredients added dish however items higher prices  example Drunken Gypsy Toast same price before however now comes berries bananas top  wrap co worker week ago same price but now rice added it    I'd understand raising prices items because ingredients changed but does appear happening here  also does appear all menu items containing specific ingredients raised price which again would understandable  Instead appears Skinnyfats just raised prices items random    Maybe am being nitpicky maybe harsh dock business star over few bucks    But honestly say am big fan Skinnyfats 2 less then amazing experiences seemingly random price hikes  A OK more accurate description feel business  <EOR> I tell you   I need better job 2014 taking care some bookmarks   SkinnyFats bookmarked ever since read Amanda M Nelson Q's review back July  gf even told place wanted go   She made didn't   But now here    So if read other reviews then gist SkinnyFats all about   Healthy side Happy side   Obviously Happy side your higher calorie options while Healthy side those trying clean up   There's selection everyone which place must try least once   But place SkinnyFats may everyone    First all Healthy side isn't super clean   just clean eating out   Happy side higher calorie but crazy high     As first timer decided getting something Healthy side  get?

Good job guys    I'll need revisit place any more stars  <EOR> Insanely good! INSANELY  Generally when order healthy dish   tastes flavorless  place! Just right combo favors freshness!!! ordered Zoodles Ahi Cucumber boat new favorite lunch! back    Probably tomorrow <EOR> Skinny Fats dichotomy wanting good healthy food but wanting miss bad stuff  good  definitely came late party but better late never  The only reason ever come down part Dean Martin look tile flooring show Panorama Towers  Now come Skinny Fats Chicken Waffles   listed only Secret Menu access online  The food good enough won't mind getting into near fights least shooting dirty looks patrons tend push chairs back into due seating area being cramped  You've already read menu works other reviews  Basically good side evil side   aka healthy happy sides  Ordered tonight more cow bowl happy side which looked good nice pieces tender beef  slob cob good but ranch dressing best part  Truffle fries ok  Cool mame ranch edamame different nice  Best part Chicken Waffle  Wow!

Bonjour brûlée pleased French toast!  accompanied turkey bacon may delish but wouldn't know because wasn't cooked well enough just opted even eat it!  also chai tea great nothing special there!    The downside see restaurant small maybe understaffed   leaving wanted try create your own Juice shakes but line literally door!  People waiting seats!  second table already another party sitting down table hadn't even cleaned yet it wasn't dirty far pretty much just dishes    However offer online ordering more then likely utilize option even chance having place sit!  Overall great concept great food great customer service!  return!      Also last thing would recommend including calorie count menu least healthy options!  know would that    not deal breaker though! <EOR> SkinnyFats tucked off Strip industrial setting but inside outside restaurant redesigned its own unique and cute! feel  There's cheery banner outside inside covered wood painted produce bit cramped once you're but works  only once sure crowded long wait might during busy times   I Juan Healthy Wrap which jam packed protein HUGE  little soggy probably pico de gallo but still tasty  boyfriend Drunken Monkey Cakes friends apollo fries Slow Boat China  All food good came pretty quickly  Everything pretty reasonably priced too   Why three stars? didn't see much menu want back eat again  two three things wanted try when while good didn't hard choice picking between all options  seem only person among friends feels way though maybe just me  I'd def  recommend trying SkinnyFats though! <EOR> Friday Morning usual breakfast sammy chipper morning never disappoints!

Well healthy side your angel while happy side your devil  Now before indulge bit more     let start story     I first read place when randomly browsing yelp wanted try it  However NEED try wasn't great  mainly because menu wasn't all interesting me  Then came yelp event where SkinnyFats participated   well needless say friend definitely completely interested them tried food  made goal try place when both free    Alas! time come! two friends visiting town last week took them SkinnyFats lunch  place smaller thought would be  didn't whole lot tables maybe 8? But did bar sitting area onesies   or those can't nab table  lucky enough nab table party! Also side note some seats directly sunlight due lack blinds prepared!   Here ordered tried Chix Broadway Breaded chicken breast brioche w cheddar lettuce bacon tomato red onion lemon aioli  Amazing! first when read menu little edge being chicken breast but gotta give them props  juicy tender full flavor  sauce paired well chicken  take onions though cause some reason just really spicy  then half way through took bacon cause just ruined texture  would eating soft juicy chicken burger only bite down some hard crunchy bacon  didn't fly me  Oh pretty much finished whole burger  delicious couldn't stop eating even though stuffed collar bone  co worker once said Finger licking good! Cheeseburger Benedict 1 2 lb  Angus burger w lettuce tomato pickles cheddar avocado red onion fried egg SF sauce  Honestly wasn't into this  Maybe because when comes beef burger  burger burger me  wasn't anything special wasn't anything particularly good this  Once again take onions also noticed couldn't taste avocado  Why? wasn't ripe  fact kind hard    Phatty Philly Steak sautéed onion peppers portobello bleu cheese steak sauce hoagie  When tried bite two this    first off way much bleu cheese liking  Perhaps could say little biased bleu cheese lover but really LOT bleu cheese! top even though said sauteed onions couldn't really taste it  steak however very good  tender juicy  But overall seemed missing something   Phatty Philly Custom friend decided switch peppers some jalapeno bleu cheese cheddar cheese  Well when tried version    liked addition jalapeno into but didn't give slices gave kind grinded  may better slices  think keeping peppers would've better choice  bad didn't many variety cheeses choose from  only bleu cheddar american think? would've preferred them option provolone mozzarella least substitution bleu cheese    Overall preferred Philly version would steak sauteed onions peppers jalapenos portobello mozzarella provolone cheese course sauce    Ahi Taco San Tempura Ahi sriracha slaw mango pico spicy aioli puffed shell  Okay DELICIOUS  puffed shell amazingly good  sauces slaw mango well together  ahi DELICIOUS  Nothing needs said besides TRY IT    Truffle Fries Honestly didn't care much these  may actually prefer just regular fries without truffle oil  bit boring  fries regular some added salt happy camper  Cause if don't eat truffle fries right away just soggy fries soggy    So all things tried definitely tell kind people are  succumbed devil's desires Honestly Chix Broadway Ahi Taco san won two trips went  food honestly very good ones did like  plan back try few more things such french toast!!

Taste wise  ok  honestly kind tasted tomato paste heated slightly watered down soupy consistency  grilled cheese great just night before    Our fries again took forever come out  completely finished meals asked server if still coming out  He said he would double check  just tell just cancel them when came out    Overall if craving good grilled cheese sourdough bread I'd come back    it good  I'd interested trying some other items well  <EOR> Been couple times before never ordered anything disappointed me  Came Sunday lunch packed  took quite while place order but wait worth it  Ordered big parm sandwich which delicious juicy dry  Also SkinnyFats punch which surprisingly better thought would be  Also tried spudgetti which basically loaded baked potato shredded form delicious think gonna dish now on  <EOR> Being avid fisherman all life always try seafood entrees everywhere go   just tried TeriAHI sandwich brown rice must say WOW!

Yay!  I Michael P  Jessica R  dinner last night ordered Cobb maybe ahi sirachi taco    Michael ordered neato burrito Jessica ordered Chix Broadway + truffle fries   After picking off black beans dug into salad  If again going happy side Cobb because wasn't feeling dressing  plus side ton toppings good value   I thing tortillas don't flour tortillas unless they're cooked until crisp quesadilla chimichanga  think flour tortillas gummy floury taste just can't stand  Unfortunately tacos served flour rather corn  Personal preference but would killer taco corn but tortilla overpowering really masked all flavors tacos   Jessica Michael split meals each other said burrito looked great but chewy disappointing  Apparently meat needed chopped some manageable  Chix sandwich looked incredible apparently great  tried some fries found them be    Dry? fry dry? wish would tried ketchups    Anyway probably back but try something else  Last night last meal before began 14 day water fast so    We'll see repeat visit when able eat again  <EOR> SkinnyFats fun little joint hidden behind madness Strip  location tucked away warehouse center closest place interest Hustler House if  your type thing  really confused why restaurant found its way here  think could even better hotel maybe closer UNLV possibly Town Square   The restaurant much tiny  cousin came Sunday afternoon even though able find seat rather quickly everything felt cramped  came baby car seat recommend that  place best visited pairs  enjoy dealing big groups here   Now food  Surprisingly aren't really any desserts  But oh goodness  still loved food! portions very generous prices  Drunken Gypsy Toast Ahi Taco San  Yum!

Way sweet but few bites tasty   The reason am fence really wanted try cold pressed juices but couldn't justify paying almost $10 it   just seems crazy me   Bountiful Basket $15 would heck lot more juice 24 ounce glass serve just less that   people wonder why many folks choose eat McDonald's Dollar Menu?!  I also dislike tiny place is   uncomfortable eating people lurking over your shoulder waiting take your seat   hard enjoy your meal when feel eat quickly   Also strangest location   hard find but necessarily convenient anything either   Anyhow brunch overall pretty good   am sure would way dine but nice morning  <EOR> Place awesome something everyone  Menu friendly choose healthy side happy side  Food great im coming back again again <EOR> I've eaten other location but menu different  Probably because came earlier day  tried breakfast item ok  location convenient where but absolutely first pick  chair sat super comfortable  other location bench good  just ok I think other location better  But don't think I'd back many other great choices there  <EOR> SkinnyFats good  burger ate phases since don't eat much  actually good cold which means pretty decent burger  Next time ask crispy bacon  truffle fries good me  But French fry freak really really high standard live compared others town  Also fried pickles ok but didn't care dipping sauce  would give them another try trying few more spots town first because burger pretty doggone good cold  <EOR> I came first time today recommendation another yelp user  wasn't easiest place find since sign flat does stand out  Walking quite line which told normal menus wall near door convenience while waiting cold water help yourself to  menu clever unique items but little hard follow fluently  prices entrées varied $7 $13 roughly  also side items other goodies less    To say building small understatement  cramped crowded waiting line larger part restaurant  pay your food find table where bring order order go  opted eat since somewhere afterward  saw table open it's first come first serve seating since tiny didn't see service register    I ordered cheeseburger benedict no onions strawberry lemonade  feeling adventurous fat it  husband more cow bowl no onions strawberry lemonade well  When took drink lemonade awful  almost lukewarm watered down  When server came drop food off table let know  He sincerely apologized exchanged both rootbeer   The food came impressed presentation sure  burger big cheese lettuce tomato mayo avocado course egg sauce it  burger cooked just above medium well which love ingredients fresh  horror burger still pieces red onion throughout  wasn't sure if meat itself just random pieces overlooked  fries amazing  husband's food also onions we think onions came Satan disappointed see that  However bowl delicious well of course bite! fried rice steak!     Regardless hiccups feel ambience restaurant pretty cool  Due its compact size happy eating  practically tackled table when go  food menu service all fab would recommend place hope back soon  Maybe next time order online pickup though  Hopefully open another location Henderson bigger <EOR> Every meal skinny fats wonderful  love taking people especially picky eaters  more health conscious friends  order something amazing off healthy side happily enjoy sweet cheesus truffle fries    Though also many healthy options they're also incredible  steakation fabulous    The cookies great but seem bit pricey  <EOR> The juice expensive $9 16 oz juice food so so  Why did 4 5 stars? <EOR> Since moved back Vegas earlier year making rounds find new restaurants hidden gems Skinny Fats far best found!
