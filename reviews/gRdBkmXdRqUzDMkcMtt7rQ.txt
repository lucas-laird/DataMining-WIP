Well why would care am giving them business? Still remained loyal customers until most recent incident  friends decided order nachos ton tacos sharing  husband pick food same employee usually rings there  She comment started ordering lot more food past  Yes mentioned before coming years two kids gradually started ordering more food  husband says yeah kids now son eat whole burrito himself she responds don't know if good thing point decided done giving place business  don't need someone looking orders calculating eating amount etc  Really wondering why wouldn't just appreciate regular business instead making snarky comments  <EOR> Amazing breakfast burrito! also keep all salsas stocked fresh  keep clean establishment always produce fresh  affordable food  Would definitely recommend cheap Mexican joint  <EOR> Robertos quite bit closer but well worth drive  Food always very fresh place itself very clean  Definitely won't back other place  <EOR> Stopped early dinner other day   live around corner never tried it   Since Eddie D's two doors down always distracted   However particular day wanted Mexican Food determined try out   I ordered Carne Asada Burrito $4 75 Al Pastor Taco $2 40    restaurant casual 15 tables plenty seating   There's small Salsa Bar see pics soda fountain   The food came short wait    Burrito smoking hot    I could barely hold waited few minutes while cooled off bit   cooling down bit dove right in   disappointed discover exactly Roberto's Taco Shop     damn   Carne Asada Burrito just ok     I think bunch Roberto's former employees must around town opening Taco Shops   don't think would able distinguish between two   The Al Pastor Taco disappointment too   lacked flavor expect Al Pastor     the smoky marinated flavor   bland   Overall disappointing but filling OK   Will return?  Probably not  <EOR> I carne asada delivered house through doordash  Mexican sure whoever cooked food Mexican  Don't fooled Mexican food! Anyway carne asada looked dog food beans tasted came can   gave carne asada dog made self sandwich  Also flour tortilla huge extremely oily even good  greatly disappointed but dog wasn't  <EOR> The hubby brought home some take place honestly edible    but mostly styrofoam box pile bland goopy cheesy enchiladas rice beans   Taco greasy boring   enchilada swimming much sauce  Rice beans okay  Just average tasting step above cheap TV dinner half step above taco bell  Sorry won't back <EOR> Great carne asada fantastic enchiladas!!  Very nice people own run place stop lot great deals  <EOR> Nice quiet place eat Mexican food  The order came fast food fresh   Pretty good place eat if Mexican food <EOR> Okay may bit premature previous review Viva El Taco  still think food good very much Robertos  big problem them when compared Robertos though  back Viva last night $0 99 chicken tacos mentioned previously  around 6 10  ordered 3 chicken tacos 3 rolled tacos guacamole  price came almost $10  WHAT?!  math should closer $6  When questioned high price pointed small print hand written sign said special price only 2 00 PM 6 00 PM  just crazy offer cheaper tacos during non peek hours  lunch before dinner  No wonder restaurant completely empty when walked in  would honor price even though just few minutes late  cancelled order Robertos instead  know what? Robertos packed  Kinda think  <EOR> Had chimichanga here  Wasn't bad all  actually best fast food mex shop  When order anything chicken tell them don't want onions peppers  doing won't serve chicken  sitting pot all day onions peppers like Roberto's does   Instead grill all white meat chicken stuff bad boy your chicken burrito chimichanga  Its def way better cleaner <EOR> I always call order food OK just don't chicken use its boiled grilled plates <EOR> Skip carnitas  Taste fake tofu smells almost bad attempt carnitas  Hubs didn't really chimichanga either  Kind disappointed stick Roberto's Tacos El Compita! least quesadilla good can't really mess quesadilla  <EOR> Been going years  Great prices huge portions  Breakfast burrito great  <EOR> Been eating years   Food very tasty   Girls counter always pleasant  The prices sure big restaurants    prices identical Roberto`s  live  same distance between two    but usually come  silly reason    self serve salsa   very good    Roberto`s doesn't salsa HOT sauce only burn chrome off bumper     Didn't give 5 stars cause don't beer    <EOR> Okay isn't gourmet Mexican food any means  However if want good ground beef taco fried perfection those delicious greasy dripping running down your hand while eating it        spot! Toppings fresh accent taco perfectly   It definitely fits bill when craving hits! <EOR> Nice clean place   Im picky eater when comes Mexican food made everything wanted way wanted it   Carne Asada Fries die for   YUMMMM!  Beans rice really good chicken burrito   definitely going back soon! <EOR> Man don't know feel place   I mean want it  near office  prices fair  food good  place clean  lot salsa stuff  But  just it  Everything seems par course here  isn't anything really blows water    The only thing place service always fast  cannot denied! Still  enough keep coming over going other places  <EOR> This Mexican food  coming 7 years entire time never disappointed  Personally hard time finding good pastor Vegas  place very few exceptions  greasy plenty flavor! Viva special place heart  <EOR> I loved place! came afternoon besides myself only two other people  ordered cheese enchilada combo plate carne asada burrito only beans cheese  food delicious can't price! took menu am planning bring boyfriend he try it  food cooked order very fresh  salsa bar good looked carrots sitting longer should though  No worries definitely back  <EOR> This place little bit hit miss    I've eaten dozens times 4 years living within walking distance    Some days amazing  Some days simultaneously burnt undercooked fish tacos lettuce cheddar cheese no sauce  Some days carne asada perfect some days seems boiled instead seared  Some days your quesadilla crispy gooey some days soggy sitting puddle grease   They right often enough stop fairly frequently but gonna pretend hot mess every once while  <EOR> you guys best! roberto's can't hold candle you!   LOVE u guys! ty! <EOR> Honestly brings rating place down customer service  food decent but when walk there's no greeting  walk cashier there's even smile nor may help you  first thought she might having bad day very understandable    all them but getting same vibe during second visit made want again  I'd much rather drive bit more street where feel welcome  <EOR> This casual little taco shop  appears clean  food average taco shop fare  service average well  Nothing great say nothing bad say  <EOR> I always come huevos rancheros because amazing here  But recently tried fish tacos can't enough  love place always breakfast lunch dinner  <EOR> my wife decided try different taco shop ordered milanesa torta very dry chewy chicken quesadilla hardly any chicken no cheese more tortilla anything   they no flavor quality meat terrible portion put meals worth 16 dollars could gone elsewhere more money road Robertos taco shop where usually mexican plates coming back don't recommend it  <EOR> Try big steaming bowl Pozole its savory broth large pieces pork hominy add all condiments given good  Their Chile Relleno awesome themselves burrito too  <EOR> I wasnt impressed beef burrito but OMG enchiladas its sauce  Ask side nachos soak all deliciousness! Forget border if craving mexican area must try! <EOR> 10 times better Robertos block! Thank God found place house definitely back  Chicken tacos point! <EOR>
