We lunch celebrate sons 5th birthday dinner time all sick food poisoning  don't know cheese pizza something wring all sick but worries me  <EOR> Loved place   cheery warm unpretensious pizza way less expensive neighboorhood ordinary pizza absolutely gourmet top ingredients fire flaming best! My family drive way since discovering it! <EOR> I disagree star reviews think might coming competitor   read reviews prior coming didn't expect much   actual place used few different businesses perhaps location no good long run   wouldn't call area broken down strip mall any means   atmosphere bad all place crowded   upscale sports bar mixed pizza parlor gelato place   many TVs fit perimeter full bar gelato display restaurant seating   spoke owner he very nice service ok but because busy because place packed   pizza delicious very unique style   thin crust quite tasty 2 pizzas large slices sausage mozzarella ricotta which awesome sliced mozzarella tomatoes topped ricotta   going back though think pizza may slightly over priced but worth normal everyday pizza  <EOR> With only 24 hours Vegas didn't time mess around trying pizza pizza food choice  Although normally would! Found place reading other Yelps   loved fact appeared local place tourist destination  certainly influenced decision dine here   We greeted seated immediately upon entering  Jennifer server came over promptly welcomed us  decided order bottle wine meal since plenty time linger  small wine list reasonably priced selected decent Chianti    Onion rings???!!!  Well top 5 foods try them  *rocked* world  See photo! Very large portion too   Feeling slightly guilty then ordered Mediterranean salad  Jennifer clued quite large portions ordered small split it  automatically brought large plates tongs could serve ourselves bowl  Very nice  dressing good over applied  Another winner   Next Margherita Pizza! Slight charring flavorful fairly thin crust nicely spiced herbed sauce fresh mozzarella  Heaven metal pizza platter! word caution when say large pizza mean it  would ordinarily order Margherita start then something else but already having consumed all onion rings salad only ate half pizza  Not worry made super great breakfast hotel morning!
