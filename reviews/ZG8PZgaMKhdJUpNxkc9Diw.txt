She hit back side look said mean? just stared bit    She then said fries Gravy fried egg scallions         far displeased just asinine attitude    The crowd present mostly middle aged late 40's    So while appreciate into great detail being public representative your company I'd more appreciate person isn't obviously miserable job    I deal many people through day she isn't welcoming informative id however dote on    She asked type wings did want said didn't know she told selection  She said she liked best decided pick those    So now await poutine wings made Korean marinade Hoysen gochujang     I'm Korean taking suggestion  also understanding going assume attitude remainder meal    I dish off heavy attitude myself when disrespect concerned    I'll brb   Ok far wings using Korean ingredients  I'd honestly love them more flavor  Korean food well known being super flavorful    They weren't horrible just didn't hit high peak Asian expectations when using homeland ingredients    I'd love come show best way prepare honest    Also poutine much better  fries freshly made  gravy way thick opinion  curds perfectly melted opposed ice cold curds prior    Overall atmosphere super chill  Everyone enjoying Golden Knights game bar maid's attitude didn't bug much she seemingly only drinkers sitting bar    The quality food good only few things  took some hummus even though super Asian just could past all sweet notes pair cracker pita bread    I think some veggies sort hummus would spot on  wasn't velvety hummus which does tell in house yet could work texture bit  <EOR> Loved food service clean place is! tried beef brisket sandwich say delicious  beef tender juicy  definitely come back try other things menu! <EOR> Went opened excited new bar area  frequent d meraki grill next door long anticipating its opening  around 1130 Saturday sat bar  bartender very friendly offered great service  enjoyed beer selection immediately ordered lady I   ordered brisket banh mi burger lady fries  brisket $11 extra $3 side salad  burger around same  burger came good but small overpowered lettuce top  brisket sandwich lacked any brisket  $11 brisket sandwich should more layer brisket  also didn't complement bread which good   bread large least three times height brisket which further made lack brisket even more significant  sandwich good flavors but ultimately would happier eating subway   Hopefully they're able add some more meat sad sad brisket sandwich   Tldr beers great food lacks value  <EOR> We ordered  salad hearty serving fresh crisp veggies beer cheese garbage nachos  also enjoyed Atomic Duck IPA  diet coke  Then stuffed brim couldn't say no dessert delicious bread pudding  Service impeccable bad aren't local would definitely come back!
