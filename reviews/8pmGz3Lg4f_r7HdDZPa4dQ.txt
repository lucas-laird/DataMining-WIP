New Yorkers know perfect crust while maintaining exact amount cheese toppings needed! ordering now on! <EOR> In last review said last chance romance Vinnie  Well became sucker again   Ordered spaghetti meat sauce mozzarella garlic bread delivery office  Asked extra extra parmesan some red pepper flakes  Decided call directly instead place order through grub hub yelp because figured would quicker  order placed guy phone he gives price $21 change including delivery fee tax no tip  said WHAAAAT   numbers adding prices yelp grub hub website  Should around $17  He said oh raised prices haven't gotten around changing them   Spaghetti meat sauce 9 99 11 99 20%!! Garlic Bread Mozzarella $3 49 3 79 Delivery Fee $2 25 $3 00  said  good  really should advertise incorrect prices  Decided place order anyway starving did want through hassle ordering somewhere else  Delivery arrives promptly am ready dig in     Open bag pull spaghetti pull salad pull bread  See salad dressing sitting bottom bag  it  No Parmesan no red pepper flakes no fricken' fork  no fork anything else office left eating spaghetti fingers sans parmesan sans red pepper flakes  Food good enough but other missteps considering missteps only other 2 orders warrants big fat ONE   Vinnie knows better change prices store without changing advertised prices  no doubt calculated bait switch  Businesses practice should patronized  <EOR> The best little hidden Vegas secret!  Everything  order fantastic  Vinny owner cook yes New York part NYFD  neatest man passion perfect food family friends  am loyal customer forever  Crust sause cheese pizza Trinity  just beginning  Menu ridiculous many food options   As Vinny says If your NY miss grease running down your arm come see he feel your tummy feel right home <EOR> We found little hole wall yelp glad say yelp came through yet again!  The building itself really cozy just two tables  means most room filled Vinny's awesome personality! He noticed right away newcomers tourists I guess clearly don't look New Yorker yet he very polite welcoming running through menu us  everything pastas wings ribs course pizza!  We ordered large 16 #3 Payless special pizza  pie sausage pepperoni mushrooms bell peppers! cut into 8 slices each full flavor cheese really gooey without sliding off pizza some other places   Vinny given warning pizza going pretty greasy  just way New York! actually wasn't greasy thought would no pool grease plate anything  Vinny even far bring another slice pizza show fold slice way New York!  We also order ribs hot wings  ribs amazingly tender really see why they've won multiple awards BBQ states Tennesse  barbeque sauce he house also perfect combo sweet salty smoky! don't know if ribs big thing Italy but Vinny definitely mastered craft awesome   The chicken wings perfectly fried point where skin crispy but inside hot tender just fall off bone  sauce doesn't really any heat next time I'd probably just BBQ more sauce!  We don't eat lot pizza general but if all pizzas would definitely eat lot more  only food great but Vinny awesome personality dining great time! <EOR> Absolute worst service  1 5 hrs guy told he hadn't started making pizza yet  Then initially wrote yelp review which deleted because owner called messaged harassed using many profanities  Extremely unprofessional nobody ever place unless u willing risk being harassed owner   btw never did pizza cancel 1 5 hrs  screenshot he messaged if anybody would see  <EOR> Very good pizza!!!

Didn't even know gentlemen owner  found later name Vinny he overheard ask guy Broccoli Rabe ? No more 5 minutes later he comes sample Broccoli rabe!  PHENOMENAL TASTING!! would highly recommend Vinny's Italian kitchen absolutely best! <EOR> I'd give place higher review but ownerships business tactics poor brings place down  Food isn't bad although generally takes forever pretty greasy  place itself fairly dirty minimal seating options  owner Vinny quite outspoken Yelp tell previous responses sure soon  New York Pizza Shop vibes but cmon man    seen first hand throughout social media person guys just plain old jerk both customers employees  no need sarcasm rude ones support your business successful  Vinny please begin acknowledging no perfect nor any business but certain level professionalism should abide by  Let's see he takes opportunity responds  2 stars NY Douche  <EOR> Yum!
