First off drive thru empty tell why small nacho fries Mexican pizza took 8 minutes timed  Okay maybe making fries fresh? Nope fries stale bit warm   Next thing  I know they're stingy hot sauce which why specifically tell them many want can't short me  Nope wrong again  Even though told wanted 8 attendant still gave 3  Lastly just opened Mexican pizza   NOT CUT  Seriously job! Speaking job  maybe employees just unhappy maybe just untrained? because another account while coming around 12am younger window attendants suggest tip him? many characters here  do yourself favor avoid location <EOR> This used good place pinch quick lunch   But service really gone down hill  If through drive thru    EXPECT packets sauce even when ask them   Also don't expect your drink occasionally because think gave you  The food good    But service really taken turn worse here  I hope together soon  <EOR> Every time order nachos cheese forget nachos   If nachos something else  Mixed orders constantly  encountered bad service before but place 5% good 95% no idea doing  tired coming having fix order then offered free drink    No don't recommend location  <EOR> Honestly bad  Lunch time Tuesday wasn't took busy all!  order even completed before able fill drink  bad all  only giving star knock down because bathroom pretty shady  clean yes just way laid if know mean  see if someone toilet    <EOR> Very disappointed whole family watching TV told kids buy dozen taco snack when open wow taco don't look taco look quesadilla nothing inside remember time when driving back LA stop lenwood California only open DELTACO order 3 taco but when open lots cheese lettuce Taco Bell even half definitely last taco bell <EOR> Nice location restaurant clean etc   fan Taco Bell but tall fella waited me  He doesn't talk much which shame  ran medium lids asked if could one  He back gave walked away  No communication whatsoever  Actions speak louder words   also work customer service industry told treat everyone conversation smile  Guess he missed day during training  <EOR> If could give 10 stars would  2 days ago location ordered cantina bowl usually do  When food noticed white hair edge bowl then took bite kid little string piece aluminum foil food then searched some more found another one  Normally someone would very upset but decided just refund leave  eat CLEARLY don't pay attention when they're making your food    SO DISGUSTING <EOR> Came grab fast bite eat before work  Kelly great! She greeted took order  Best part she smile  Once food sat down notice no music playing  felt weird eating food quiet area other people around  Also hearing them eat food  only hear all employees back house talking personal life  because satisfaction during time okay  Other food great  <EOR> I suppose location isn't big customer service  reading all reviews clearly management hasn't caught things should fix ensure stand other fast food places around  pretty lucky only taco bell 5 mile radius   I'm sitting drive thru line approximately 12 21 its 12 42 am still good car front me  Its good thing don't 30 minute lunch  <EOR> Arrived drive thru 2 09pm took order 2 10 lane since 2 26?  long time drive thru  <EOR> 4 15 18 11pm Taco Bell long ass day work   Taco Bell down street house ALL TIME  well guess guys working tonight really just don't care  Ordered food ordered payed double meat  Well home food doesn't even regular meat  take food back MANAGER RYAN extremely rude unprofessional  only waiting 15mins refund he decided he wanted apologize  <EOR> Let's start off saying wouldn't even give place any stars  last night understood drive through backed up  Came inside ordered told wait time food 10 mins   unheard off !!!

Keep putting smiles people's faces  Sometimes may only reason someone better day  experience impacted mine enough spend time say thank you  <EOR> Absolutely horrible service  Waited line 5 minutes before manager Yaneth came out  She spoke former employee while stood there  She glanced twice but said nothing  Finally Gio another employee came take order  looked few times well while he looked away surprised he finally taking order  When mentioned lack professionalism Yaneth started argue she thought former employee  clearly standing no where near him  Never once apologized  Just attitude your food now out  Disappointing! If customer service something you're good then maybe shouldn't industry  <EOR>
