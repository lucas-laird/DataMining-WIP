Great selection whatever your looking for  Defnitley must try area! <EOR> Horrible customer service  Never even try anything  Walked 5 30 happy hour only 7 people place  Sat down table saw 3 bartenders behind bar  Waited 15 minutes without ever being offered even drink  Finally asked bartender if order bar?  He said no minute  He stood finally walked because he never even attempted take order   Bummer because really looking forward trying food drinks such great reviews   competitors business instead  <EOR> Great drinks great atmosphere great service  Ronnell bartender party 3 bar half full he still made sure well accommodated entertained  first visit but definitely back future  <EOR> New area!! Never liked summerlin  why 8 yrs lived here!! never made effort come summerlin!!  Terrible service   off work met boyfriend few drinks stressful day work   3 bartenders wasn't busy   bartenders walked pasted 2 times did acknowledge me   Finally bartender asked if helped   said no he said sorry walked passed twice didn't ask you   said its ok   beer 2 shot Jameson gambling    boyfriend cash didn't comp drinks gambling lost $30    said bf   lost 30 dollars im gonna pay drinks charged me    lady heard said sorry didn't know gambling   she comped drinks   But wouldn't writing this   If she wasn't talking shit regulars   only reason know that   because people sitting sitting semi close she hunch over talking them kept looking bf   would left bigger tip   But guess people summerlin thinks shits don't stink better others!! Only if didn't move closer work!! wouldn't would stayed Henderson!!! <EOR> Me husband always drive finally decided stop last week glad did!!!!AS soon walked bartender introduced himself name dan very nice !! going locals establishment feel welcome !! draft selection great! Happy hour great! many experiences bad customer service just stress fact when into establishment treated great needs heard !! Also owner happen sure if he always but knew lot patrons name introduced himself well asked everything going !! Very professional welcoming !  If could give pint 5 more stars would !! definitely returning !!!! <EOR> Good music great beer food cool bartender! <EOR> Hands down chef! ur typical bar food  Everything came hot made fresh  Onion rings zucchini fries sweet potatoe fries hit spot! Big fat meaty fish chips covered oil just batter  Burger big juicy could only finish 1 2  Tons beers sample  4 arcade games pool table couches fire place  much fun here! Thanks great waiter Austin too! <EOR> Nick bar staff awesome friendly professional if live close check spot out! <EOR> First off want say pains give place 1 star  much potential  Unfortunately based experiences can't that  personally don't recommend bar due poor customer service    Folks gave more enough tries before writing review  6 times only somewhat decent service once    My most recent visit last weekend  place pretty empty  boyfriend sat down bar waited     waited     waited! Talk feeling unwelcome  Unless blind NO way didn't see us   2 female bartenders behind bar seemed more interested discussing friend Michelle's party happening later attending customers  15 min asked drink menu  bartender gave menu then seemed forgotten us  She counting receipts checking dishwasher looking everywhere but us  Finally other bartender made eye contact said patiently waiting take order  She responded Oh figured she took your order  Side Rant Any normal person even ounce customer service would should enough attention detail notice 2 customers sitting bar awful long time no food drink front them  least check other bartender ask if she took order?!? If don't even fraction kind attention detail then shouldn't customer service job! she quickly poured drinks when drinks low neither bartender acknowledged it  Neither bartender making drinks  just standing around  other  very tweekish behavior  no excuse lack customer service received  tad more friendly would drank more probably ordered food even though just mediocre  Instead drink left    I most likely won't again  If against will  insulting establishment treated you're intruding    Another reviewer stated saw bartender off shift start gambling  saw same thing happen when there  No wonder why she didn't want take order  shift ending eager hit those machines    I dunno what's going place but predict if don't change attitude toward customers they'll outta business no time  really shame because much potential    If dont mind being treated rudely then all means here  actually decent craft beer selection  <EOR> Staff management all really cool down earth  Great food drink specials games  pint become spot good time! <EOR> This place 5 mins away house such great neighborhood spot  really beer girl luckily great selection other drinks well   Parking super easy side Smith's building actually turn left onto Town Center when leaving there!
