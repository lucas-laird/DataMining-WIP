Standard eggs bacon toast order most issues which resulted sending back order completely guest having share food others table  Eggs bacon arrived first 10 minutes later toast finally arrived only warmed bread  response reason why toast didn't arrive rest meal made conveyor belt    Take two toast attempt exact same result which then eggs bacon cold entire meal sent back  While order removed bill did receive mean eyes manager   If pickles place go  However if anything else including service may want pass   Considering attention detail around SLS Las Vegas Northside Cafe did rise occasion continue high standard excellence  <EOR> Prices $5 more chain restaurants selling same food  Service poor ask refill water which refilled warm water no ice  Waiter didn't take order correctly gave member party fries instead fruit  Sandwiches didn't look bad  Alfredo chicken tasted fishy  some pasta undercooked  No Parmesan offered when asked sliced Parmesan brought out  Lol! edible but would waste money  <EOR> My husband decided Northside birthday dinner   Yes lot pressure Northside give great meal   KC server suggested surf turf   could happier   steak melted mouth shrimp tasty side asparagus wonderful   perfect amount very very good   husband wasn't crazy pasta chicken but gave 5 stars because great service excellent meal   Give try!! <EOR> I chance dine SLS Las Vegas popular restaurants such KU Noodles 24hr Northside Cafe highly recommend top notch presentation detail revised menu since opening almost year ago  ambiance casual hip trendy approach great selection comfort Asian fusion delicious items  wait staff attentive friendly which big difference compared other dining outlets strip  cafe most helpful staff Cristian Santos which made dining experience daily memorable one  <EOR> Great breakfast!

Anyway way find busboy gives straws spot  When waiter comes back sees straws he looks stifled upset  point he only returned table give bill    Here's assessment The Griddle House brought high hopes dining SLS  Unfortunately NSC holding its own properly  Northside Cafe need step its game through new management servers menu stay market  <EOR> Four stopped breakfast none left hungry!! bacon egg omelette made egg whites  doesn't love thick cut bacon? boyfriend fluffiest moist buttermilk pancakes most generous dollop butter  waitress kept coffee cups filled throughout meal seemed well rehearsed menu  Good service yummy food!
