Yay! We sadly noticed no dessert listed assumed wasn't any  green tea ice cream mochi ice cream lychee sorbet plum sorbet   Overall pleased experience there   Sure don't ridiculously huge menu million rolls but happy quality sushi  mattered   They open late until 2 am!   They also offer frequent eater card ten visits free! <EOR> Sushi Hana good place if craving some run of the mill Japanese fair CHEAP prices  quality good especially money  selection average but GREAT money once again  lunch specials extremely affordable although all you can eat priced same most other sushi places actually better off ordering separately then cheap your wallet   decor bleak but servers super friendly  Few them speak good English but passible understand most simple phrases necessary  Service super fast hours until 2AM great those don't sleep early  Sushi Hana definitely stop when am craving sushi any time day night don't much time don't want spend much money  <EOR> I don't finish work til 11pm most nights place FANTASTIC!! awesome sushi buffet open til 2am every night???!?!  kidding me?!?! Raw shrimp?  Toro?
