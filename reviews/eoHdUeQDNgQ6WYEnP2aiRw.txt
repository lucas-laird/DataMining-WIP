When walk around Cesar's Palace instead?? wasn't happy but complied waiting began   Since 3pm hadn't eaten much day wait around restaurant decided order snack take out window  Figured would split hot dog boyfriend while waited since starving then when seated hour would order something lighter complete lunch  take window super slow inefficient but guy serving window provided good conversation  waiting hot dog pick window hear name called restaurant  WTF??? only 20 minutes   The hostess gave attitude because she calling name  Hey lady expect when don't give buzzer!!! explained party ready but just ordered hot dog Serendipity Take Out asked if could bring into restaurant  She said NO she could seat rest party but she couldn't seat if wanted bring hot dog  Even though friends hadn't ordered any food yet bought hot dog Serendipity she wouldn't budge  canceled whole table friends just ordered more food Take Out    The whole ordeal just no sense  1 Why would hostess say wait hour then able seat 20 minutes? 2 Why can't bring Serendipity take out into restaurant if still going buy food restaurant? ALL SAME PLACE! 3 Serendipity some pretentious nightclub  <EOR> One word describes experience serendipity     Overrated!  All things heard people desserts all wrong  mean don't wrong good  But just average good  same taste cheesecake factory  Heck even dairy queen baskin Robbins compare place  Next time sweet tooth way anywhere but serendipity because can't justify paying over 10 15 bucks sundae    We ordered called famous frozen hot chocolate chilli cheese fries nachos spudnicks number other sundaes  Nothing really stood me  frozen hot chocolate tasted hot chocolate flavored frozen yogurt numerous froyo places  nachos 30 peices chips spoonful cheese beans  literally wasted half nachos because just didn't any cheese them  spudniks ok  compare Jack box cheddar potato wedges  other sundaes aren't worth describing  Everything just decent  wasn't worth 1 hour wait all   9 people party spent close 180 00 average tasting desserts over priced bowling food   But guess end those places try least once your life  <EOR> After hearing big deal frozen hot chocolate finally try out  made reservations since Saturday night know packed gets over here  Good thing did because line long!

Looking around other tables lot uneaten food people could finish  <EOR> Desserts star here! If come solely frozen hot chocolate yummy treat you'll 5 star time all way!  HOWEVER if come dinner don't expect anything different could your local diner  triple price    Waitstaff seem hurried frazzled  Hostesses drone like  Very mediocre service   That being said ALWAYS back signature frosty indulgences   no matter blah everything else may be! <EOR> Prior own experience heard many mixed reviews Serendipity  must say enjoyable experience here  made reservations soon bf seated immediately waited right away  portions huge although menu bit pricey food pretty good  bf reuben best had! meat tender delish  high heel pump proscuitto  really fresh tasteful serving huge took rest go  shared single oreo frozen hott chocolate rather 'for 2' just right!

Can't any better that! delicious  little bro course more fascinated giant bubble gum machine outside  Lol but he fun here  Besides understanding why wait twenty minutes ice cream  Which explain wasn't Baskin Robbins  p Thumbs up  Gotta try least once your life  <EOR> My husband came back 12 31 2013 dinner before firework strip  say very happy server  He really really sincere polite  saw he sincere every table he served  Service does big difference your dining experience!!!!! We shared caeser salad add on steak only las vegas strip steak sandwich yes again Forbidden Broadway Sundae  Everything tasted good  sundae really delicious satisfying! great meal end year 2013  =D <EOR> I took first trip Vegas so excited try restaurant out   always wanted frozen hot chocolates   luckily found groupon which even better   First service sub par   3 hostesses stand around  also bathrooms restaurant   outside walk around then down into cave     Then public restroom gross reminded nasty public park toilets they metal toilets   took 20 30 minutes once seated just water! house salad mediocre   balsamic ok   friend both burgers   ABC burger because waiter said good blandest thing ever   didn't even eat half it   burger no seasoning no seasoning didn't put condiments it    lot fries already made best luke warm   did romano cheese onion rings   Those WONDERFUL   would totally eat those again   friend also shared frozen hot chocolate   ok   them home real chocolate but tasted slight powder taste   probably would liked better if never made own true delicious chocolate taste   All all back eat but maybe grab onion rings go  <EOR> Had funny kind waiter place would probably receive 2 stars  hostesses rude    My family spent Thanksgiving Vegas ever since heard famous Frozen Hot Chocolate wanting try since only other location NYC    Since thanksgiving decided reservation just case place crowded lunch  made reservation 2 30 but shopping Forum Shops decided 2    When making reservation hostess rude very uninviting  She seemed whatever mood assuming quite busy she decided somewhat bitchy mood  When she asked whether wanted indoor outdoor seats said whichever available time okay maybe dumb response proceeded give short lecture when making reservations need give exact response just giving exact time  Okay understand might've sounded dumb but don't talk your customers if they're kids something  didn't really seem she wanted help that    When came back around 2 bit iffy worried parents wouldn't enjoy restaurant since very whimsical young hip especially since hostess gave sort negative vibe  However getting past hostesses waiter made feel lot better choosing eat there  doubt but he funny honest helpful menu    Overall restaurant unique Frozen Hot Chocolate thumbs we even ordered Green Tea trying original definitely good place try out  hostesses just sucked day  <EOR> It started off great hostess extremely accommodating me  checked reservation 40 min early she told table would ready 15 minutes  exactly ready given estimate time  great day hostess friendly restaurant cute looking forward trying sundae first time ever  Upset say ruined an extremely rude server Izzy  Perhaps fact ordered water instead drink made think wasn't worthy guest? also because requested dessert first cowardly portion $16 versus $24 full size ? initial reason behind your sour attitude towards because requested booth party 2 when could've sat table 4?  First off ordered water because walking around Vegas all day 106 degree weather  Secondly requested dessert first because always wanted try Serendipity 3 sundaes I wanted sure room dessert over dinner   When placed dessert request specifically told going order dinner this  attitude whatever  shook off didn't mind doubt because does sound excuse  first hint  second hint when he rudely dropped off sundae glance heard thud table didn't even bother ask if ready order dinner  Okay  fine    Maybe he busy  Now part infuriated he checked other table cleared dishes made sure didn't need anything else didn't even bother stop left somewhere another server stopped announce she break server  Needless say mood sour appetite ruined because point now obvious he didn't give sh*t us   It's very cute sundae parlor atmosphere friendly servers e g  break server which potential great experience     wish break server any other server better attitude Izzy treated sister just because water sat booth ordered dessert first  <EOR> I place under recommendation few friends though say place indeed quite yummy if sweet tooth wasn't spectacular thought would be   The prices indeed pricy side but keep mind lot portions sell well pretty big  friend bought $14 sundae when came bit bigger imagined be  Heck three people eating sundae still could finish or maybe just small stomachs Vegas food ! sundae also waaay sweet coming someone mild sweet tooth! much whipped cream too   The frozen hot chocolate however quite indeed delicious but man cup looked bigger Big Gulp 7 11! Saying beverage huge understatement  still nice however  second thought would literally frozen hot chocolate right freezer but taste made think otherwise   If come try hot chocolate  However place isn't amazing thought probably won't taking second trip place again  <EOR> Don't wrong love frozen hot chocolate but still give place 3 stars  First off white tables still remnants melted chocolate sides cracks tables  made feel little uncomfortable  Also waitress looked small piece garlic let's hope garlic anything else finger while taking order  place also overpriced  food good but don't think pulled pork sandwich worth $17 bucks    On bright side place adorable frozen hot chocolate delicious  deep fried Oreo sundae also yummy  dessert won't stop coming back definitely coming back try deep friend Snickers sundae  <EOR> Love love love frozen hot chocolate!!! However service horrible  Next time just frozen hot chocolate order outside part! <EOR> Super tasty food  Cheerful service   def return    <EOR> I avoiding place years but quite bit better expected   The quickies *Yeah frozen hot chocolate great no worth price  *A large pitcher Coors Light $14 *The home fries served some breakfast items very good!  *The humble pie quite good insanely large  *Be prepared long wait weekends don't pagers stick around pretty close   Yeah its tourist mecca but back! <EOR> This place just plain AVERAGE!  place 3 other people  2 ppl ordered cheeseburgers 1 ordered vegggie burger ordered grilled cheese    The Grilled Cheese chewy more bread cheese WAY better Hooters    The Burgers ordered medium well both came super char broiled!!! If cook can't even medium well burger something WRONG!  Veggie Burger didn't taste but she vegetarian she says wasn't even close average veggie burger she's WAY better   Chilli Cheese Fries honest fries awesome used real beef cheap ground beef   I also frozen hot chocolate which say great but maybe next time waste time money eating average meal there   I would pass just frozen hot chocolate! <EOR> Me four other friends Frrrozen Hot Chocolate dinner during night Vegas  some thoughts it  Dude tastes Wendy's frosty   better Peets     and forth   It tasted fine but definitely overhyped  did feel bit ripped off too  $10 something made half price elsewhere  Then again Vegas    Try once experience    or something  right   ? <EOR> My husband good breakfast dying try Saints Sinners French Toast Log Serendity 3  high hopes    First should made reservation not even sure possible    waited hour seated   restaurant seating people side patio when arrived but began doing immediately before seating us   music extremely loud   asked turned down told because kitchen open couldn't hear it   stated believed patrons should accomodated kitchen staff sorry everyone know work very hard but should pleasant those eating paying bill    music volume changed twice while down complained again then down again   Second waited 35 minutes breakfast which consists long thick piece bread nothing special flavored seasoned could tell supposed 4 slices bacon but only 3 1 3!   addition server started pick plate tray dropped 1 3 whipped cream tray   She did offer nor did she bring more replace it   maple syrup enough normal sized french toast should more server never returned time request more   berries fresh   worst however so called sunnyside eggs   Yes sunnyside but eggs completely cooked through rubbery use knife saw through edges worst eggs ever restaurant!

Unless you're Profesional eater plan sharing sundaes  Amazing quality presentation ingredients  <EOR> The food amazing place  penne vodka pasta really delicious  sure try signature ice cream sundae     keeper! <EOR> We Serendipity weekend say VERY disappointed! When told 45 minute wait wait outside close by   sat table right entrance never heard name called! friends inside sure didn't call name said did   Since didn't hear told would another 20 minute wait could sit outside  chose sit outside   hostess rude taking table she did smile once basically jog keep her   When she handing menus she cold rude   waitress then came okay first but 20 minutes same hostess no smiling rude   ordered frozen hot chocolate let tell worth $11 00! all whipped cream couple sips did take chunks ice! waitress brought bill didn't come back 20 30minutes!! all find but then she came back  Overall crappy service deserts way over priced got  never back would never recommend place ANYONE  <EOR> The way through waiting list seat people disjointed confusing  think you're going handled efficiently because cellphone based text notification but when alert no seems know they're doing    When read menu think All looks good! good   The best thing ordered frozen hot chocolate which initially delicious but few sips quickly becomes underwhelming leaves something desired  size two easily shared four but $15 basically chocolate smoothie still unreasonable   My friend ordered breakfast burger two eggs them raw  mean clear white blubbery yolk egg didn't see the surface of the frying pan RAW  slooshed burger snot when he lifted take bite    My other friend ordered chicken waffles  She said fried coating saturated oil waffles brittle crunchy left under heat lamp long   I ordered balsamic strawberry waffles  strawberries supposed soaked balsamic  just regular strawberries all balsamic poured center bottom waffle  waffles least softer tastier friend's waffles but weren't anything special your typical run mill mass produced Belgian waffle   Four items cost over $84  place rip off food sucks  atmosphere noisy crowded   Here's good rule thumb while Vegas if somewhere family friendly you're famIly skip it  <EOR> Visited recently late night dessert while Vegas work conference   result bad stand wait during previous visit made sure reservation weeks ahead time sure paid off   friend arrived 9 50pm 10 00pm Saturday night reservation immediately seated   waitress arrived table promptly large glasses ice water almost immediately!  Knowing wanted ahead time   frozen hot chocolates   we ordered quickly   waitress forewarned kitchen bit backed but managed orders within 5 minutes   Well mostly   she accidentally picked mint frozen hot chocolate instead traditional ordered   Quickly resolved new fresh frozen hot chocolate front me!  usual amazing perfect hot evening Las Vegas!  those Vegas must do's!! <EOR> Pretty good food great ice cream but way expensive New York location much better  But all Vegas does compare New York  <EOR> This review based frozen hot chocolate   first read 10 things Vegas can't miss list found many glowing reviews when looked into further   There nothing amazing life changing delicious drink   cool inventive intriguing   pretty boring slushy takes your typical hot chocolate made packet   My tastes usually discriminating but reasonable drink did nothing me   ate whipped cream off top drank 1 4 tossed it   Eleven bucks well spent   I am guessing regular desserts fine but seems some sort signature item real disappointment  <EOR> If ask Judy! She great waitress kept drinks flowing  food little expensive but Judy made experience worth it  <EOR> After second visit location decided time review  original NYC when comparing food really no comparison identical  wait location lot shorter times went  Also location smaller think  Whats great location window outside if don't want sit table just order side window  many yelpers mentioned Frozen Hot Chocolate delicious!! Believe hype!! Its totally worth wait  four stars Frozen Hot Chocolate location!!   Soon review experience NYC location  <EOR> The place wasnt bad  Wifey sundae customized substituting chocolate icecream instead coffee ince cream described menu  the sundae included peanutbutter flavors etc      felt would better choco ice cream rather coffee       In any case desseerts pretty good  Service could better therefore star docked  didnt bill while flag someone down it  Cmon now Vegas people see places Money           win!  I would again  Probably try another type sundae    Hk's parting shot    didnt know but apparently reservations overheard  way dont wait extraordinarily long! Next time      next time    <EOR> Food great however customer service horrible! Especially hostess red hair she upset due fact 3 party gave table 2  She nice all  other hostess Patricia very nice accommodated us  <EOR> We walk right 15min wait seated  server Izzy great! He helped choose food very funny personality  friend kept dropping fork when told sorry can't take anywhere she keeps dropping fork second time  He said Well  bad because don't give fork came back hand full forks drop them table causing all laugh hysterically! very sarcastic group he right along ride  Giving good he getting us      His food suggestions spot delicious  He suggested steak egg sandwich garlic bread all split  steak tender eggs cooked perfect garlic roll server nice crusty say more bacon! Saw hotdog just one  He warned foot long which made laugh because suggestive nature foot long weiner  changed order chili dog realizing laughing myself came  foot long! French fries great kind stay crispy forever    The prices high but portions huge  kind evens out  Just sad don't triple stomach could ice cream famous for  next visit just ice cream!  Izzy course! <EOR> I only come frozen hot chocolate  usually long line prepared wait especially weekends summer time   I window life easier   I've food but think stick ice cream frozen hot chocolate  food ok best thing   I usually eat somewhere else nice high end restaurant  Afterwards stroll into place dessert!  They're middle renovation March 22 2014 maybe summer they'll better equipped handle summer time volume  <EOR> The kids loved food desserts! Though just simple plain side dish super thinly sliced apples hit youngens just presentation alone  mini cheeseburgers mac cheese outrageously priced but if kids scarf 'em plates clean then prices justify themselves  tasty beef ribs ahi tuna salad  am ashamed say polished off plate clean    Their vast menu ordering quite task want try everything  cannot come without trying frozen hot chocolate  always associated Serendipity frozen hot chocolates but other desserts worthy experiencing too   The only thing s did quite enjoy which most think am absolutely crazy fans blowing outside seating area  chose sit outside because AC full blast inside uncomfortably cold yet just cold outside fan blowing cool mist across dining area  Though fans provided cooling sensation most frozen chair middle dessert heat  <EOR> My sister b c friends raves place but NEVER back  service slow took hours seated food telling no seating wait would hour even tho inside half empty outside several open tables once seated waitress never around food bland had breakfast quesadilla which no flavor chicken waffles which very greasy value wasn't worth price $50 top off sister both food poisoning! spent last day Vegas bathroom laying random benches because already checked hotel didn't feel well enough anything  2 days still feel nauseous chicken    Another thing put off owner someone looking start another location sitting next us  staff busy catering them customers neglected  arrived ordered before them but yet received multiple desserts appetizers entrees cake of which would take 1 bite throw away before meal ever arrived  If owner would want customers well taken care because means repeat business    Also restaurant does bathroom  use public restroom outside building which extremely nasty  Very poor dining experience  However place might okay dessert only  <EOR> Don't believe hype! Horrible service horrible food    You wait possibly 45 minutes seated trust when say worth time  seated directly next kitchen seems moved table just seated but really didn't fit completely walkway awkwardly positioned  made difficult enjoy meal because keep moving chairs let people staff coming kitchen food shift chairs let them by  able see right into kitchen because nothing separating walkway seated literally timed people's food sitting under lamp warmers being prepared 15 20 minutes  What's worse when food arrived waiting 35 40 minutes prepared   it cold   I mean cold came fridge some leftovers you're eat next morning hangover  type cold   I guess all heating lamps being used!! worse server worst ever he wasn't familiar menu when asked any questions regarding options he irritated rude  party 5 people dined 1 hour 20 minutes around 5 PM server only checked twice when he took order when he dropped off checks  bad table hot chocolate bar refills beverages soda water    once bar no assist even offer services actually person group behind counter refill drinks us! over priced undercooked neglected meal think actually owe friend having behind counter work! <EOR> Horrible Frozen hot choclate but great entrees <EOR> i wouldn't anything else place except frozen hot chocolate    best item menu    I did order crab dip ok    I sunday night reservations didn't even need b c tables available   dont think would wait more 15 mins place   i'd much rather just order go  <EOR> This review brunch menu      Their website list number call reservations   called leave voicemail but never received return phone call restaurant wait hour 15 people   Since hurry decided order food sit outside tables eat   hostess said take orders   Then decided order food outside part Serendipity called something quick bite run    15 girls challenge itself everyone's order person window order   Came window started reading off order   employee said only serve pastries drinks until noon    No where signs menu did indicate serving times   She recommended order restaurant since more extensive menu   told asked hostess told offered   She said back ask another person   time believe 50 min later table ready decided dine restaurant   hostess showed table   add 2 more chairs rearranging chairs when server walks said Whoa your table? said your table? When told hostess he said sure? Very rude   think name Ryan   food ordered chicken waffles   waffles crispy hard chicken over cooked   $4 cup orange juice even freshly squeezed!!!!  pumped  eat total disappointment   Poor customer service horrible food  <EOR> Go desserts food   Ended having lunch since right front Caesar's   The frozen hot chocolate extremely tasty extremely large  ended sharing single between two people  really and banana split next table ordered both monstrous looked delicious      The food mediocre best  mac cheese really light flavor burger fries extremely dry  drink few glasses water through it   It kind nice say but definitely passing any future trips  <EOR> I told place famous frozen hot chocolate   When tasted seriously thought something could easily using hot chocolate ice blender   The food itself bad though   Las Vegas strip steak sandwich huge! ended sharing still more enough 2 people  About service   our waiter very friendly helpful fast he could be   But everything took long time because obvious he over burdened tables   Things slow time came didn't want anymore   wanted some Ketchup but finished fries before came   wanted napkin but cheese already dried hands before came!  wasn't fault just need more people! <EOR> When told wait 30 minutes  waited meanwhile found table unoccupied when mentioned said customers ahead you  S0 waited finally 30 minutes told turn seated exect table empty whole time!!!!!! Also asked sandwich no bacon fully cooked  know happened  sandwich raw meat + bacon!!!! I Gave 3 stars despite all mentioned cause chocolate shake delicious <EOR> So Vegas yesterday decided must try frozen hot chocolate heard much about   say way way overrated   Honestly Starbucks java chip frap much better cheaper!  few people said tasted Ovaltine agree that   seriously nothing special apparently lot people yesterday felt same way b c saw several them left half drink unfinished   However figured just spent 10 bucks damn straight  finished ours but again impressed   say nachos really good though  <EOR> I am hugeeee sweets lover pumped place   unfortunately let down  girlfriend split big ice cream sundae surrounded cookies  ice cream nothing special cookies stale!! let down  Should done famous frozen hot choc guess <EOR> If feel giving 2 hours your life overpriced food and  if you're getting go then place you  extra staff zero sense urgency your order you  Translation give zero fucks long stand around  <EOR> The food pricier side they're mostly known desserts sundaes which big  desserts pretty sweet very decadent  staff attentive friendly helpful  decor seems somewhat childish  little stand don't eat restaurant  <EOR> Beware pepsi fountain drinks cost which isn't listed menu cost $5 each!  would ordered tap water realized this  <EOR> I've walked place quite few times over previous Vegas trips looking forward finally trying frozen hot chocolate   guessing sitting outside 115 degree weather last weekend in dead zone between misting fans no less didn't help very much but while chocolate y kind felt something could home ice blender   Also root beer float which actually really good reuben sweet potato fries    pricey side but then again rest Vegas    I'd probably back try some other desserts cocktails but food probably pass  <EOR> Visited December 26th 2010   The frozen hot chocolate favorite!!

Anyway  grade dinning reviews few things    Service didn't experience any wait time apparently  norm time season walked starlight in  we're meet promptly seated straight away  Forgot mention parents joined party 5    all good but seated between front door front desk kitchen  plenty other options thought poor choice  server polite but surly start she warmed during stay Aussie accent helps sometimes   Kitchen staff excellent son dairy gluten free way hi something eat which great but sadly no else good food   Food being beef farmer eat steak just everywhere steak fries ordered arrived good time but fries cold steak ordinary  daughter mini cheese burgers which she ate half passed rest  bit into second could see why meat bland all could taste old grease grill yuk   Dad safe sundae happy enough but then nothing much phases when whipped cream   Mum just some fries which also arrived cold no flavour all   So summary food below expectation service average  <EOR> Try central park omelet delish!  service very good fast  <EOR> Your Las Vegas trip incomplete  if don't  eat here    let tell you    whatever happens Vegas won't stay Vegas haha!

Expensive but disappointing  least say now  <EOR> Direkt am Las Vegas Boulevard Strip gelegen gehört dieses Restaurant zum Caesars Palace http www qype com place 155631 Caesars Palace Las Vegas Hotel  Zwischen dem Hotel und dem Serendipity die Wasserspiele und Springbrunnen die von der Außenterrasse wunderbar zu beobachten und fotografieren sind  Und zur anderen Seite das pulsierende Leben des Strip  Siehe Foto unten Gehobenes Burger Restaurant   kann man das Serendipity am besten beschreiben  Obwohl  es gibt nicht nur Burger die große Menukarte ist umfangreich und bietet auch jede Menge Pizzen Omelets und andere Eiergerichte dazu verführerische große Desserts  Eis Cremes und sonstige Naschereien  Im Innenraum sind die Tische sehr eng gestellt zu Essenszeiten ist es meist gerammelt voll und Gesprächsführung kaum noch möglich  Schöner ist es da schon auf der Außenterrasse  Der Blick auf den direkt vor einem liegenden Strip ist lebendiges Kino  Und mit einem guten Teleobjektiv lassen sich von hier aus unbemerkt die kuriosesten Fotos schießen   Für Las Vegas Verhältnisse lässt es sich preislich vernünftig essen  Wir waren mehrfach hier und haben  natürlich wenn schon dann schon  Burger getestet A B C  Burger $ 16+ BBQ Blue Burger $ 16+ B E C  Burger $ 17+ aber auch ein Omelet East West $ 14+   Wir bestellten die Burger medium rare und erfuhren dass dies hier pink genant wird  Die aus Süßkartoffeln hergestellten Pommes gibt es zum Burger dazu und schmecken vorzüglich  Soft Drinks heißen den Staaten Sodas Cokes Fantas etc  kosten $ 4  Und den Pott Kaffee bekommt man für $ 4 freies Nachschenken inklusive  Zu Spitzenzeiten ist das Restaurant sehr gut besucht und man muss Wartezeiten bis zu 45 Minuten hinnehmen  Die Bedienung wie immer freundlich aber bei vollem Lokal überfordert  Häufiges Warten ist leider angesagt auf die Bestellannahme auf die Lieferung des Bestellten und auch auf die Rechnung die doch sonst den Staaten immer schnell auf den Tisch gelegt wird   Fazit Zentral gelegene preislich vernünftige Futterstelle  Wer Zeit mitbringt und diese Art Küche mag der wird zufrieden sein  Gratis gibt es von der Terrasse das Las Vegas Spektakel  Gute drei Sterne  <EOR> We ordered deep fried oreo sundae  took long time it  When finally brought took wrong table  When melted oreos soggy  kids tried eat but just wasn't good  quite while finally waiter come over  told wasn't good didn't want it  He took away manager came over few minutes later  She wanted know problem explained took long come when did goopy good  She tried give excuses reasons why sometimes tastes that  told just didn't want she said she would take care   When bill she still charged $9 it  Full price $15 pay more half something didn't enjoy didn't eat   last time there  There's just many choices Vegas need again  <EOR> OK Serendipity fan   simply love place!  several times back each time Vegas   That being said take fan hat off long enough offer objective review Price Point? Moderate   OK sorta feel famous Frozzzen Hot Chocolate seriously over priced @ $15 but everything else moderately priced   Serving Sizes? Huge!  Food really though see why some people comment food overly flavorful   subtle flavors generally happy it   Those abundance flavor may little disappointed   Service? So So   couldn't complain service levels though really nothing special them either   Christmas morning hostess wasn't dealing well being busy though something should given hostess but oh well   If service levels better I'd give restaurant 5 all day long   So tried?!  Here's quick list some things husband tried when visiting Alfredo pasta fan just can't resist   say most enjoyable Alfredo wow ages!  pasta thick starchy sauce creamy yet amazingly light   Flavors spot also   fav dish haha obviously   Serving size quite big more enough two meals yup take doggie bag!  Side Ceasar Generous portion salad side shared don't skimp what's either   Foot long Hot Dog Chilli down treat husband   Yes huge!  He loved though Meatball Sandwich Hubby's choice again he loved it!  Huge serving he didn't through all but he truly enjoyed every bite he had   Frozen Hot Chocolate Yum couldn't finish mine but light eater  OK obviously signature drink but above mind over priced   I'd never order again half seriously thick whipped cream   Cream lovers rejoice couldn't through even half cream though P   Kobe Sliders just OK   I'd order them again though nor did leave any lingering memories awesomeness   If want something smaller lighter off menu though plus   Banana Split Cowards Serving   just decadent!!!  Banana Chocolate Ice Cream Strawberry Ice Cream Vanilla Ice Cream Chocolate Syrup Caramel Syrup Strawberry Raspberry Syrup all topped off whipped cream Cherries   just wow      Seriously ordered cowards portion knowing am light eater server said great when really would good 2 3   If kids let them share size I'd hate see big $22 $24 serving is!!!!  great     just wow lot food no way could through more 1 4 it   Pink Lemonade Err wasn't pink but tasted good   sure if offered free refills part service lacking noticeably absent follow trivial things empty glasses   Cheesecake HUGE!!!  2 4 people could share this   don't know if 1 person could realistically finish it   Layers Cheesecake cream in between served bed Raspberry Syrup   Saying sat 5 6 high no exaggeration P <EOR> Awful  frequented Serendipity's New York many times location nowhere near comparison  start wait least 15 minutes weekday 2pm two people  plenty empty tables inside outside  problem seemed lacked enough staff actually clear clean tables soon patrons left   While waited table stood outside perished menu posted wall  looking forward trying sundae humble pie  soon sit down inside look menu realize menu isn't same  asked waiter where sundae menu he tells don't humble pie anymore menu outside old haven't bothered change it   Disappointed order cookie sundae friend orders frozen hot chocolate something she looking try whole trip   The deserts come quickly  dessert much smaller NYC  sundae mediocre  Basically just cookie dough ice cream cookie  5 minutes serving desserts waiter comes drops off bill basically preventing ordering anything else   Needless say won't frequenting location again  worth hype nothing movie  John Cusack Kate Beckinsale would definitely approve! <EOR> This last place ate Las Vegas before flight home  weekend endless walking buffets sight seeing ready end Vegas trip simple light lunch  Even though place probably cheapest places ate Vegas experience wasn't worth price   We arrived Serendipity 3 around noon packed outside inside  Choosing sit inside immediate seating  However no server came all first 15 minutes  Needing catch flight within 2 hours flagged down any random waitress nearby take down orders  She incredibly polite apologetic long wait it took 30 minutes food come out   appreciated she made great effort sure satisfied experience  boyfriend coupon allowed free frozen hot chocolate long ordered entree  He ordered A B C  burger avocado brie caramelized onions steak meat the other option chicken choice steak fries side ordered mac cheese  total came roughly $33 without tip which unfortunately cheap going simple meal Vegas unless choose something Chinatown McDonalds    A B C  Burger + Steak Fries I normally would never touch steak any other beef item but wow burger delicious  nibble boyfriend's medium rare steak topped melted brie fresh avocado loved combination B C burger  However I'd say BEST thing ate lunch steak fries  meaty yet crunchy salty but thirst inducing  don't even know describe wonderful steak fries were  boyfriend describes fries best he ever next fries he ate Celebrity cruise line cruises which tasted incredibly similar     Mac Cheese I don't know why Las Vegas activated cheese addiction but couldn't resist ordering simple comfort food staple  macaroni used dish perfect large tender shells held fluid creamy cheese slightly crusted top  metal pot mac cheese served looked small but own surprise first time didn't finish cheese dish! wish though just writing right now making mouth water !   Frozen Hot Chocolate I somewhat amused oxymoron name when first heard Serendipity's famous trademarked dessert  Contrary its name dessert isn't actually frozen  But truly somewhat contradiction  frozen enough eaten spoon but melted enough drunk straw cold enough enjoy dessert but warm enough enjoy sweet creamy smoothie  boyfriend claimed dessert himself even though couldn't steak fries best part meal came incredibly close  definitely must try if you're anywhere near Caesar's Palace crave unique dessert! <EOR> I read place about com various Yelp reviews raving Frozen Hot Chocolate  admit all correct  chocolate shake called damn good  Double Chocolate win  Also Fried Oreo sundae very good  Oreos still hot when hit table while definitely work meal off near future well worth it  <EOR> Frozen hot chocolate AMAZING! Ordered foot long hotdog hamburger frozen hot chocolate combo  Food mediocre  However love imagination behind restaurant! Would still love try something else  Probably focus more sweets! Love sweets  <EOR> This place probably only 3 5 if Judy  She best  Kept drinks banter flowing  If come request sit section! would come drinks dessert  food just ok  <EOR> A good place eat heart strip Las Vegas  place casual kicked back diner atmosphere  server really nice helped pick food menu array mouth watering foods choose food just worth your $$! Just appetizer alone enough fill starving tummies! entree great but dessert where money at!! definitely come back eat  <EOR> Serendipity 3 definitely unique place dine Las Vegas mainly due its ambiance decor  Quite funky wacky but uncomfortably weird way   more beat humorous  food does little disappoint     macaroni cheese instance full cheddar gooey awesomeness can't fail burger friends said grilled cheese kind  didn't bother trying frozen hot chocolate b c heard its overrated but honest stuffed all delicious appetizers main courses didn't room dessert  regret trying fried oreo sundae which hidden menu but definitely won't miss next time Sin City  <EOR> My friends came eat during bachelorette weekend Vegas   told come hour early could wait seats   but must've waited 20 mins max promptly seated   in room only 3 4 full   guess hostess just wanted pretend place more hopping was!  We unfortunately came eating really late brunch early dinner since show tickets later evening none really hungry   sizes definetly generous here   tried tomato soup crab artichoke dip chicken fingers tenders frozen hot chocolate   Everything pretty good even full stomach   would definetly recommend crab artichoke dip again   Its mostly just crab dip piece artichoke garnish but crab pieces pretty big   smothered baked cream sauce served small slices toast   tomato soup bad but just overly salty   chicken fingers surprisingly good juicy  served trio sauces honey mustard bbq ranch Others table included ABC burger Avocado Brie Carmelized Onions BBQ blue cheese burger   Neither them finished but didn't hear any complaints compliments   first time trying frozen hot chocolate good but little overrated   I'd come back again empty stomach see if any difference   3 5 stars! <EOR> You because gimmick stuck Vegas Strip   The giant ice creams fun but food mediocre just every other mid priced place Strip  <EOR> My husband dessert seeing Absinthe   Fast service friendly staff yummy sundaes   I would again  <EOR> 40 minute wait hotdog burger others waited longer just ice cream     $10 tiny burger  Don't it <EOR> Not sure why all raves frozen hot chocolate   simply tasted Starbucks mocha frappacino almost $10 00 very over priced   I Monday night around 9 00 pm hearing all raves it   person working outdoor window still 100 degrees outside   wait way long something could gotten starbucks $3 50 <EOR> Vegas practically second home since come least once year  past two years eyeing Serendipity passed driving down strip exterior cute decorated huge frozen hot chocolates  finally around trying famous Serendipity experience all expected   great way   My good friend arrived little 9PM  given wait time 30 40 minutes  having such good conversation failed even keep track long been  When pager finally buzzed led outdoor seating overlooking strip  first noticed many empty tables  guess just understaffed? Anyway sat down average looking table  some reason pictured place extremely cute lot more   New York ish?   Our server took felt ages even take order when he finally arrived table he didn't seem enthusiastic all  ordered large frozen hot chocolate 2 which $15  both took sip frozen hot chocolate same time probably same surprised look faces  very disappointed quality ever famous drink  tasted no more melted ice cream even super icy milkshake  friend ordered believe some sort turkey sandwich which $17  portion decent  didn't try sandwich but sweet potato fries weren't anything great   I definitely back Vegas but definitely returning Serendipity  Hype hype but sometimes gotta see believe case don't believe hype  Save your time $15 milkshake Coldstone  <EOR> Sat immediately upon arriving which nice but took good 10 minutes before someone even came over once waiter did come over seemed he over serving people  Lack luster attitude side sarcasm put lightly  If your waiters overwhelmed need few minutes catch would MUCH RATHER wait table extra 10 minutes sitting table waiting someone acknowledge 10 minutes    Food way over priced  know sliders appetizer expected small but DAMN! literally size ramekin came them filled ketchup  12$? C'mon now     But kids ate them only good part dish bacon aoili yum! Fries crunchy good  only enjoyable part whole meal frozen hot chocolate wouldn't mind paying $15 two serving if wasn't more half whipped cream top  Yeah looks pretty but way rip off your customers  Once while OKAY   but mean once blue moon because walks ridiculously far unless you're already walking strip really only enjoyable dessert  I'd suggest ordering takeout window right front restaurant seat yourself  Save yourself hassle  <EOR> Fun food fun place! If getting sundae sure least 5 people share sorry  If only two people both eat more should because freaking delicious feel crap! <EOR> I've restaurant 2 years ago food good  I again week disappointing  Unfriendly receptionists food served cold long wait  I intend return next trip  <EOR> Every year when visit Vegas smoothie donuts carryout section restaurant  year supposed no exception however some service issues   walked over 1 pm posted smoothie donuts dismay told those items only sold during breakfast hours which ends 11 even though no signs menus indicated this   back next day around 9  carry section closed even though site says open 830 but actually only restaurant opens 830 carry opens 11   say hostess carry doesn't open till 11 half stuff menu breakfast breakfast stops being served 11 which means half menu inaccessible customers   pissed off couldn't even articulate complaint hostess  walked away ended eating delicious breakfast Mon Ami Gabi     The reason give three stars because when eventually donuts back another day told previous person incorrect donuts sold all times day but smoothies address only sold breakfast delicious usual previous years gone didn't any trouble getting donuts smoothies no matter time day was  sure why suddenly changed things  <EOR> Worst experience ever  Service worse  food cold  workers rude  food wasnt good talked about  never want eat again  ridiculous wait also  <EOR> Bad services slow   Dont know whats big deal desserts   bad good      it even busy took long time  worth wait   Wouldnt want come if more then 3 people inline  <EOR> The frozen hot chocolate bit overrated The milkshakes overpriced great They actually charge extra couple dollars if want split entree someone The food usually pretty good more affordable places eat strip <EOR> I craving good old fashioned ice cream parlor sundae when came upon Serendipity excited  Unfortunately $14 mind you sundae COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT  all honesty small Dairy Queen sundae comes more hot fudge monstrosity  All some mediocre ice cream ton half melted whipped cream oozing off look appealing  burger good but next time we'd burger place right next door Caesar's  Maybe frozen hot chocolate would better but don't think we'll back find out  husband didn't care strawberry milkshake either  <EOR> OMG YUMMMYY!!!!!!

I'm def making trip store NYC when few weeks  <EOR> After seeing Bette Midler's show Caesar's decided grab some late night eats but mostly interested trying Frrrozen Hot Chocolate   attempted Serendipity 3 when New York couple years ago but didn't quite happy see new outlet West Coast   We given coupon free Frrrozen Hot Chocolate $10 purchase let just say am glad free because no way would ever pay $9 50 one!  pretty tasty especially if chocolate but overpriced!  sister compared frappacino without coffee!    I guess overpriced theme although Vegas kind given because Turkey Club $16!!!!  ordered some potato skins think around $10 well!  While both food items decent nothing knocked your socks off but merely put dent your wallet! <EOR> I wonder sheeple think garbage long famous garbage actually good food   Sure Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate all over Food Network perky little Rachel Ray slathered all over body something that   But let's down brass tacks CRAP! absolutely friggin' CRAP!!  $11 89 tax Swiss Miss ice milk thrown into blender little whipped cream top   If think Swiss Miss ice milk could possibly amount anything worth kind money mention sugar packed empty calories then you're sheep idiot lobotomized sheep oohs aahs over anything featured Food Network   Enjoy your 12 bucks crap  <EOR> I seen Serendipity 3 long time front Caesar's Palace but wasn't sure going in  wife tried talk into going long time now finally gave in  brunch  different menus brunch lunch dinner  Upon entering feel old time soda fountain  seem lot ice cream items menu all times day  taken care quickly being seated  server friendly kept checking just time needed something   I plate extreme nachos  very good  just right amount beef cheese  Next time might ask more Pico Da Gallo  wife ordered french toast log  just was  If french toast log sure two three friends would share you  looked inch thick three inches wide eight inches long  tried potato wedges came loved them  hint herbs nice crunch skins   Yes big dessert menu but just full try anything  Maybe next time  <EOR> I baby back ribs major food poisoning  spent rest night hotel room feeling crap  pricy even good  place just overrated  <EOR> Yum!  husband first Las Vegas trip   TBLT he burger split them shared   Both sandwiches big delicious!  fries good well   service good but did take while server food   little pricey but all food strip pricey   packed when went   wanted dessert but just full anything else   few girls next ordered different desserts desserts very large pretty   perfectly located staying Caesars Palace Augustus Towers  <EOR> Go dessert food  best part visit Serendipity 3 young lady bar  She provided great service fun conversation  took incredible amount time breakfast arrive 40 minutes   <EOR> Disappointing   I live Vegas Always wanted try place  looks amazing outside patio  just Name restaurant catches attention  However when walked in    n worse  Idid understand why pay much regular dessert wasn't good  The service best maybe 3 star service  No ruddiness but  nothing impressing    NOT restaurant  please expect more cafe  <EOR> This outside Seredipity Las Vegas Blvd  OVERPRICED drinks! Unfriendly bartender  <EOR> The ambiance ooook  food good but really expensive  $20 burgers sandwiches  ate crab cake sandwich which good  also cotton candy martini which $14 but fun  sweet  would again try breakfast  <EOR> The frozen hot chocolate yummy   tried food but sure once update review   dessert sell very LITTLE $1000 Sundae    right folks ask them many sold year   last time only 8 counting hopefully days see gold flakes large sundae action   Perhaps if lowered price maybe more people would buy it?

After desperately asked around wait table 40 minutes nobody mean NOBODY came table take orders  gave left  Frozen Hot Chocolate whatever worth your 40 minutes while strip   There many restaurants which serve good deserts foods strip much better attitude  waste your time restaurant stupidity  <EOR> Lady complete asshole when came 10 15  weren't notified closing early anything but would fine if just let know instead keeping waiting 45 min  then asked order something to go still 20min before closing time rudely told closing early hostess very promptly snatches menus holding walked away  No apology inconvenience  Could handled way better any normal service person  <EOR> Not just dessert! Offers breakfast lunch dinner items  tip though expect long wait times tables because good! Put your name list walk around outside fountains Caesar's Palace   photo opportunities! text when your table ready   also offer few adult desserts speciality drinks  <EOR> I excited Serendipity Vegas because frozen hot chocolate sounded amazing   wanted try years   You're going regardless say but really isn't very good   really wanted it!  don't know heck husband thinking each ordered frozen hot chocolate   big enough 1 3 people share more if you're eater me   food presented cool way but tasted just okay     husband chicken fingers Asian chicken salad   little early lunch did wait seat but waited really long time bill  <EOR> I think only reason people come because central location blaring pink decor screams Vegas! Horrible service  understand place gets really busy but shouldn't take over 15 minutes waters  food wasn't very good either  ribs incredibly dry fettuccine pasta tasted made box nachos really just bunch chips tiny portion cheese meat   The frozen hot chocolate everyone raves overrated  somewhere else better food! <EOR> slow service  + mac cheese! itttt   + oreo frozen hot chocolate pretty yummy  except friends full even finish half + friend's veggie burger also pretty legit + sweet potato fries crispy + friends enjoyed chicken wangs  said sauce made it <EOR> The wait time worth it! 40mins table another 40mins food there's only 2 us!!

Food Good but little overpriced   Most portions pretty big easily shared except crab cake sandwich   desserts really why go!  frozen hot chocolate fantastic! Ambiance Nice    all least if dine inside  Service sat bar ate service great servers friendly  Thought Again little over priced but desserts great! <EOR> Too expensive food great  hear because sister remembered being very tasty but dinner all wondering why expensive   Might well Carls Jr burger there  only positive fun environment  <EOR> Over priced Over rated!!  Frrrozen hot chocolate okay  would recommend only because its common dessert but just don't high hopes  love Caesar's called the legendary favorite  Barney Stinson would agree   Its bowl chilled hot chocolate TON whip cream top sprinkled flakes chocolate  honestly describes it  Nothing special except its height price tag  Its $11 small $15 large two share   FYI large perfect three people especially if your eating meal here   Pesto Italian Pizza wonderful crispy crust but really lacked flavor  assuming if pesto part title then would least taste pesto but oh wrong   In does better burgers  Sorry but say it  Although thick cut beef patty someone needs tell them quantity does quality  bread tasted old soggy  friend ended eating open face sandwich  fries other hand delicious  crispy perfect golden yellow hue   The hot dog just    a hot dog   Warning!! bathroom quite distance away  walk outside it  no idea why floor patio slippery!  Overall food didn't blow mind service good  <EOR> enjoyed frozen hot chocolate service  <EOR> I'm over frozen hot chocolate crave  and pregnant too  gal window wasn't friendly all  She killed most  She didn't smile  She didn't say thank you  She sucked  Honestly drink isn't great  and white chocolate frozen hot chocolate  it Tuesday before lunch visit   and your already ? find somewhere else spend 10 bucks    <EOR> I visited Serendipity 3 dinner because people raved infamous frozen hot chocolate  start positives  service best ever had! server Jason amazing attentive  also loved atmosphere its chic decor great music  However other delicious frozen hot chocolate food mediocre best  fact soup pretty bad recommend getting omelet sweet potato fries  If you're just looking good dessert great place but I'd recommend trying another spot actual meal  <EOR> After visiting New York decided visit Vegas  food same but atmosphere layout restaurants completely different  Vegas modern flavor don't feel charm place New York  Even going mid afternoon Wednesday friends wait hour  Once seated service quick  food OK nothing amazing  desserts large but again aren't most amazing desserts planet  fun visit but wouldn't way it  <EOR> Expect wait    Come when minor urge eat    You'll hungry time your food    I prefer sit inside usually 20 60+ min plus wait depending time go  recommend Las Vegas chicken strips appetizer! Love batter! also ordered sweet potato fries which good but wish more dipping sauces other ketchup that  bowl chili DELICIOUS! bits filet mignon satisfying  frrrozen hot chocolate pretty good but THICK  good but overpriced    Onto place itself    cute spacious but isn't much look at    But you're Vegas there's always people that   **Updated portion LAST visit don't think going back  pretty sure server forgot us    comfortable inside she didn't want refill water guests sitting 100+ degree outdoor area  orders also par but unable find server let know    If sit inside just walk window <EOR> Food great but there's always wait service great    far food say no scrumptious desserts calorie packed dishes?  The location conveniently located tourists front Caesar's Palace can't missed   obviously lot tourists coming service lackluster because they're trying win regulars  <EOR> Great food Great Frozen hot chocolate <EOR> It wonderful  suggest getting Mac cheese bacon  really great filling  burgers okay but service nice drinks impressive <EOR> I'm fan Orrreo Frrrozen Hot Chocolate!  But definitely fan take out line  Absolutely ridiculous  Ordering took way longer getting drink  spent nearly half hour waiting order three minutes actual drink  maybe three groups ahead until decided leave line because taking ridiculously long time STILL spent half hour line  REALLY?!   I'll update when chance eat little drunk off much champagne pool party earlier day dinner    Oh Vegas  <EOR> I feel everything moves slower Vegas during day     Maybe  because mildly hungover maybe  because service moving extra leisurely pace   party 5 lunch spent over 2 hours here   Aside substandard service food great!!  Hangover Omelette sweet potato fries   Both delicious but could only finish half omelette   Also don't forget try famous frozen hot chocolate!! AMAZING also comes variety other flavors now peanut butter oreo strawberry double chocolate etc  <EOR> This place totally over rated! food tasted just any fast food joint  ordered foot long hot dog ham sandwich sodas bills came $51  don't mind paying much lunch but something feel sick stomach! Later back desserts well  known for  Result very disappointed! <EOR> The frozen hot chocolate just ice cream me  mochachino cold when came table  burger dry  place cute merchandise cute  food blah service blah but right strip  dont big deal place  impressed  decor cute  it  <EOR> The Serendipity 3 Caesars decent enough place serving mostly diner food dressed clever names   place people visit novelty expect crowded busy during meal times weekends   more efficient professional wait staff would experience more pleasurable but line people waiting servers don't seem feel need impress anyone   alright spot hang grab some food people watch if you're hurry anywhere   Pros Average food People watching Strip location  Cons Service Food Quality  Over past few years Serendipity handful times most recently late August 2011   wife thing visiting place but she's assured she's completely over novelty fascination   look around you'll know everyone same reason kind funny cute   hey Vegas   sure walk around take some sites eclectic surroundings   always your food eat outside although does pretty hot during daytime   The food average stay sandwiches burgers can't wrong other items hit miss example crab cakes fishy gross   Everyone gets frozen hot chocolate some other dessert nothing special much different you'd your local ice cream parlor     YMMV depending your expectations taste food luck although always poor service if group very cute girls male server good service   know mean?  Unfortunately kind place where servers aren't professional easily distracted duties   If screw your order suggest best situation eat because take hour two replacement dish come out   In opinion Serendipity 3 Vegas relies draw name offers little more average dining experience Strip   few minor tweaks service quality control food place would actually ok   Keep mind places worse food poorer service don't afraid give shot if your Vegas List  <EOR> The best sundae far! Lookie Lookie give cookie Sundae   The portions huge dessert definitely enough two unless really hungry!

Half lettuce old wilted cherry tomatoes overripe pizza just joke because put cheese top something pizza crust! wish thought taking picture people would see quality food offer! <EOR> It's shame favorite restaurants but when bad manager  table next served raw chicken!!!  manager Melissa  chose focus customer service  She shaded saying enjoyed half entree       tasting it  food good food is  But service keeps coming   management want come back six years regularly coming lunch  All servers air staff awesome!!! Melissa good manager such good people  <EOR> This warning anyone planning group event Serendipity   I planned 13 guest bachelorette dinner Serendipity  prepaid nearly $600 la carte menu signed contract beforehand all T Cs  While read carefully didn't think much statement Seating manager's discretion  should paid more attention because 100F  even night  when arrived  party 13 placed patio outside sweltering heat while dining room remained half filled  When requested reseated management promised they'd move soon 5 more seats became available yet watched walk ups continually seated instead    While food indeed great hard appreciate no mood eating uncomfortable heat  More half food drink ordered unconsumed  add insult injury someone ingenious idea putting misting fans patio try cool down patrons which just resulted ruining all 13 girls' hairdos which carefully done night out   Maybe sounds being finicky but when pay much money dinner inclusive 21% service charge!!! expect things right treated VIP  complete bait switch  <EOR> Yelp definitely steered right direction one  headed straight Frrrozen Hot Chocolate    mm mm good!!  Yes its overpriced but worth it   double which means double chocolate not obvious menu    also cute kinda retro look place   Try off season midweek off times better yet all above don't take reservations lines long  Easy find right front Caesar's  you see if walking driving down strip  Picked canister Frrrozen Hot Chocolate mix take home which includes prep  instructions   Staff member can't remember name told into double hot chocolate combine 2 scoops choc  ice cream 2+ Tablespoons preferrably dark  Ghiradelli etc  chocolate syrup 1 1 1 2 cups ice blender   good luck! <EOR> Being born Raised SOCAL southern california going Las Vegas becomes right passage into legal debauchery once turn 21   great things Vegas FOOOOD!   culiniary options bested every passing year most brilliant ideas Caesar's Palace Casino ever made franchising Serendipity 3!  pricey side but return well worth it   wait hour but also short order window take well     food your typical american fare but own twists it   and portions good enough 2 3 people   Lets real nitty gritty place AMAZING     Desserts!  frozen hot chocolate goblet filled brim coco goodness topped home made whipped cream perfect antedote hot day desert   Try also Fried Oreo Sundae   scoops mocha ice cream topped fudge fried oreos hugging ice cream into place   UTTER INDULGENCE!

Cresentwhich potatoes good melty! Perfect size well! full hours! mother ordered breakfast quesadilla huge but very good also! Server pleasant quick! try some ice cream next visit  <EOR> The desserts Serendipity worth visit alone simply incredible   only complaint Serendipity gets very busy when Strip loads wait times long   But  because great restaurant worth waiting for  <EOR> FYI place currently undergoing major renovations seating only outdoors  full menu available however decided give try last day vegas   Since other reviews did convince much talked frozen hot chocolate decided try caffe serendip instead coffee nutmeg cinnamon   nutmeg unfortunately overbearing  But still enjoyed first half cup while warm    the cup massive  The empire state onion rings amazing!!!!! highly recommend getting them  served stack hot fresh fryer overly oily all perfectly crispy perfect amount batter seasoning romano cheese outside  delicious combination ranch BBQ sauce also amazing  definitely made whole meal worth it!!!!! Had eastern western omelet meal nothing impressive  garlicky potatoes came delicious but omelet seasoned very well filling chunky  sure other items menu would better  The service good food came without long wait appetizer spaced nicely meal   When windy conditions outside caused fences surrounding makeshift outdoor restaurant space fall down waitresses made sure move umbrella wouldn't topple next time wind picked up  All staff very good  <EOR> We brunch food desserts which known  ordered take window which extremely slow though assumed would faster bet 35 minute wait table restaurant  various burgers breakfast sandwiches  Those burgers VERY disappointed  breakfast sandwiches came croissants which good  When all said done place known desserts should probably thing order there   somewhere else non desserts  <EOR> THE WORST service ever! I always wanted Serendipity but never chance until Vegas recently   also Groupon NO idea Groupon!  We into restaurant told 40 minute wait even though restaurant mostly empty   hostess friendly all   asked if could use Groupon outside take away place told could   then outside waited hot sun 25 minutes slowest moving line ever!!  Finally front only told can't use Groupon there   asked nicely if she could kindly help faster reservation inside we'd given run around which she kindly did   We spoke very nice female manager inside said fault she told hostess wrong info she would take care us   asked if could  menu outside waited already made minds order   She let know she'd take care it   Then nowhere some horrible male manager came said he'd seat but we'd pay prices inside which WAY higher he even scolded female manager front us   Horrible horrible horrible!  husband frustrated let sound frustration because we'd screwed around male manager balls actually threaten call security   really???  screw show tiniest bit frustration treat us?  But then again way he treated other manager pretty atrocious shouldn't surprised     We helped fabulous bartender whom apologized she deal mess   placed order quite some time finally food take outside   questioned some pricing all changed   ended getting overcharged $4 then another few dollars because ordered bacon cheeseburger but guess missing???  bacon   Frustrated told bartender she didn't offer give $ back esp  given 40% tip kind accident but still    Impressed never back   New York stores should ashamed associated horrible place  <EOR> Simply terrible  Wait time supposed 15 mins   Turned 25  Staff overworked responsive  Drinks took 10 mins came slopped over saucer  Gave 2 appetizers 20 minutes  Don't waste your time  <EOR> This place definitely all hyped be   didn't chance New York excited when opened up   first time tried closed   Granted around midnight but c'mon Vegas!  People don't sleep Vegas!  Plus people need consolation sugar fix lose all money gambling   Anyway finally try frozen hot chocolate which pretty good   see became famous product   However also tried deep fried oreo sundae which just okay   All all worth try if haven't but probably won't going back   prices ridiculously high is   only usually line least 45 minutes long during peak hours   think give NY try if ever back over there  <EOR> I Vegas should expect spend some money but $70 tab some burgers very bad frozen chocolate just rip off    We because loved movie wanted try frozen hot chocolate ended eating lunch there  food decent but 16 bucks just burger? good but good  However REAL disappointment frozen hot chocolate  tasted blend ice chocolate powder accent ice  whole thing watery sweet all left HUGELY disappointed  better desserts Vegas less watery monstrosity cost  advise stay away  say though service great sweet potato fries good  Overall though bad choice try it  <EOR> Loved menu! Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate 2 yummy! server good  <EOR> If hungry split meal    breakfast + coffee probably cost around $25   took 40 minutes served being seated don't if you're rush   That said breakfast delicious filling  <EOR> My husband came birthday  Ive wanting try place ages excited  disappointed experience didn't live hype    Our waiter extremely rude sarcastic  ordered Frrozen Hot Chocolate response  all? When why he disappointed he said thought you'd order actual food  He brought dessert quickly same time brought check he wanted leave    He ignored needed drinks refilled bypassed table wait someone else  When asked another waitress assistance she told hold walked away  When she walked back she looked kept walking    I finally spoke manager informed terrible service  You're paying $18 dessert service nature absolutely ridiculous  waiter noticed talking manager grabbed bill table stood counter awkwardly watching us  When walked he started laughing    Absolutely awful  never back  <EOR> Great restaurant  Inventive menu try peanut butter martini desserts amazing frozen hot chocolate cheesecake being great examples  Sit outside if if inside which seated quicker ask booth way more room tables  <EOR> Went breakfast during restaurant week 2011  Really enjoyed prices weren't outrageous lot other places Strip  <EOR> I really looking forward trying place while dessert ordered pretty good service horrible   First off seemed good while until seated even though place didn't really look crowded all  then soon seated took FOREVER server come table    Well did order some desserts  ordered Frozen Hot Chocolate because try while mom ordered some kind sundae Deep Fried Oreos top  said before desserts pretty good  Especially oreos  never tasted something good before  say though did hear Frozen Hot Chocolate supposed warm cold same time hence name but all tasted milkshake  mean still good but bit disappointed tiny bit it   Well only did seem waiter completely forgot while ate took forever show finished eating could check  then took good while again come back deliver final receipt    Look would say place try Frozen Hot Chocolate some other dessert but just prepared service  not  Maybe fixed that  don't know  <EOR> I heard lot place family friends decided check try famous Frozen Hot Chocloate  place pretty cute granted very girly  frozen hot chocolate delicious but service kind slow really attentive  didn't try anything else but place seems overpricey  Through everything think I'd take people first time but  it  everyone says little overhyped   Definitely check if you're Vegas mean to  sure any 'okay' movie if expecting much gonna suck  <EOR> Big portions  Share your food!

How place stays open popular way beyond me! <EOR> The concept behind Serendipity 3 appealing but execution leaves much desired 1st dirty the floor littered food previous patrons the exterior restrooms downright filthy  $12 foot long hot dogs $18 hamburgers possibly worth 1 3 $  Decor 1 dimensional looks done shoestring budget The best thing logo would bought t shirt if didn't want forget I'd ever there  <EOR> I really wanted 2 5 star review but close enough  came since didn't NYC  Waited half hour seated try frozen hot chocolate    really its blended chocolate ice milk shake  server wasn't really attentive    we told no breakfast but she left menus anyway  ordered frozen hot chocolate two she single portion  didn't send back since portion enough us  don't know NYC but terms service hope its better one  Anyway check off list now  <EOR> I'm originally New York very excited see Serendipity Vegas   decor lot different sure if much but its fun way   friend split bottle wine   She ordered grilled chicken salad ordered high heel pump sandwich proscuitto fresh mozz pesto basil balsamic portions HUGE!

Customer service really bad! 11am place kind busy  specifically asked if served Nacho since wasn't menu but seen photos wanted eat  asked waiter he said didn't nachos menu  sure if he new hired but he could tell ordered outside menu  Ended ordering chicken strips frozen hot chocolate  Chicken strips okay frozen hot chocolate tasted any other chocolate shake  Very over priced  food served no napkins  Asked another waitress napkins  Seriously she own world looked very confused when asked napkins  She must because she never came back give napkins  Finally waiter came around napkins    Don't think would come back give place another try!!!! <EOR> Soooo made reservation Monday afternoon yes busy but seated ubber quick tried narrow down lunch choices ginormous menu   So food    Eh  awesome bad   Frozen amaretto hot chocolate   freaking amazing   Banana split small portion tasty   and HUGE    Think we'll stop again but just dessert time    Better dinner lunch spots this  <EOR> just come back lunch 3 us! 2 sandwiches tacos 2 milkshakes cheap wine   $87 00!!! server awful forgot even times busy trying flirt ladies oops ladies guess type!

<EOR> SERVICE SUCKED   WE WALKED BAD  We vacationing LV staying Caesars looking bite eat  dropped place because 30% empty no line  wife eating but going order desert finished  ordered pepsi T BLT    They brought drinks took order  5 minutes being seated  40 minutes later BLT still still refilled drink still hungry  told waiter cancel order left  would more forgiving if something needed prepared burger philly cheese steak but gosh just BLT coke   I no idea place famous NY until now  experience figured some BS tourist trap  <EOR> Still favorite place sweets!

Maybe just Vegas pricing  <EOR> This last stop during Las Vegas trip because really wanted try famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate  did disappoint  would give 3 half stars if could but three suffice   It Friday afternoon restaurant busy surprise  All wanted dessert decided hot chocolate some sundae cake it  waitress did come until 10 minutes seated but understandable because she waiting 5 tables  ordered when waitress finally came waiting game began again  sundae frozen hot chocolate did come almost 20 minutes   People ordered ordering meals food before ours   The wait really bad amount people day  Maybe they're just understaffed knows? But top all off noticed fork which did need use since getting dessert still clearly dirty  probably just order Frozen Hot Chocolate next time won't dining again  <EOR> A OK   high expectations place why did let down?!  ordered chilli cheese hot dog ehh think something anyone chilli even good   bread good though tasted freshly baked lightly toasted texture     Ordered giant breakfast night drinking everything should taste good right?  But felt just average pricey breakfast     Basically nothing special food but big portions shared 2 people   way paying half price half taste quality   Also tried original frozen hot chocolate it's good no doubt but $11 cheaper elsewhere   Sounds fancy but really just frozen chocolate drink!  it!    Tried frozen green tea hot chocolate bad idea!  sweet tastes nothing green tea   Artificial   Overpriced   Nothing special  <EOR> Nice spot first night vegas lots good choices food  Every time asked girl where she wanted eat she said here  LOTS food big portions full  She fettuccini alfredo spaghetti meat balls both yummy stuffed try dessert   hostess little attitude y but waiter great  Worth trying when decide where go  <EOR> Awful experience! seated 30 minute wait only wait another 20 minutes table without anyone acknowledging us  No drinks  No hello  tired waiting left  <EOR> HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!! my husband waited 45 minutes the place HALF EMPTY! waiter paid most attention women seated other tables  frozen hot chocolate 1 2 whip cream! original NYC thought would expect desserts service good    i would give place 1 2 star if could! <EOR> SERVICE Fast Friendly  It Friday night last weekend June packed  When put name down hostess told 30 minute minute wait  received text message within 10 minutes table ready!

My husband ordered ABC burger  comes avocado brie cheese caramelized onions  watched cut down middle cheese melted just right way! looked really delicious came sweet potato fries  He really enjoyed meal   We also ordered frozen hot chocolate course   peanut butter cup flavor  11 dollars high but worth it! did order alcohol  fact really should only order alcohol Casino because anywhere else Vegas 500 percent mark up!! But really drinkers way hot weekend!!   ATMOSPHERE decor super cool Serendipity 3 love look menu! dishes pretty neat! great views all around you  Flamingo right across see Vegas lights then other side see Caesar's Palace little courtyard area bar middle  personally feel best parts Vegas all people watching  If sit near courtyard section restaurant see ton people walking by!   If necessarily poor but Craft Steakhouse option really decent restaurant where spend roughly 50 bucks 2 people  <EOR> My experience Serendipity 3 really 2 5 STARS   FIrst off waited hour   also window but line order window looked long line splash mountain disneyland 75 degree day     Second food average best   The famed frozen hot chocolate tasted exactly name described it   However nothing really impressive it   think if made hot chocolate home put freezer would probabl taste same   We also ordered onion rings which HEAVY   talking weight just way sat stomach   LOT batter those suckers   Finally service decent  Nothing rave complain about    We didn't try any entrees might better dessert appetizer ate  Although m sure return visit    <EOR> Fun Place!

Good service great food! <EOR> It OK but great   heard much serendipity wife she visited NY location try Vegas   3pm waitress little disappointed only orders desert no food      I traditional sundae arrived very melted  Tasted kinda plain me   nearly expected  <EOR> I see lot people posting pictures food dishes instagram past Vegas vacation decided check place out   family ordered frozen hot chocolate try since someone recommended it  reminds swiss miss chocolate cocoa packet loaded lots sugar  all right tasting   The burgers pretty juicy if say  looking waffle fries told them but did see menu when asked waitress   Our waitress nice no issues service here  Probably would stop again if wanted something sweet eat  <EOR> It's sad give Vegas branch Serendipity such low rating because love New York  Frozen Hot Chocolate $11 delicious always but atmosphere sorely lacking rest food feels well generic  Caesar salad drenched dressing farthest thing healthy could imagine  burgers people next having looked good but fairly small given hefty price tags    In general worst weird antiseptic smell whole place had  Didn't want eat all!  I'd back if sat outside only dessert  Would definitely sit inside would save money better food elsewhere  <EOR> Had problem cold food but mgr handled promptly    Replaced heated microwave  <EOR> Its Serendipity Christ sake! Frozen hot chocolate tastes just that  Hard explain try yourself  Long wait but its trendy over it! <EOR> Service sucked Tania L took forever when she finally did she attitude constantly repeating know guys rush please train your staff learn simple service skills  <EOR> Waited long line hot chocolate!!

Perfect any group! <EOR> I actually pretty disappointed place  breakfast maybe wrong move because deserts looked amazing  am thinking if desert would love place   Basically breakfasts just ok service blaaaa ok nothing exciting    What stood lack team work caring front desk  Someone broke glass shards glass all over front near door check stand  3 hostesses basically kicked some glass over hostess stand everyone walked automatically walked into pile glass    I just kept watching watching thinking manager would something when came up  Nothing happened  finally servers wait staff walked area awhile  She saw mess looked around kinda shook head you could tell she thinking WTF then ran off broom dustpan etc cleaned up    I just surprised 3 hostesses manager stood around did nothing but kick big shards into pile then left there  just amazing people walking all over glass  <EOR> The frozen hot chocolate okay  Its chocolate milk frappuccino whipped cream shaved chocolate top  would buy again but only if real sweet tooth moment mean $9 drink  Its worth trying guess  BEST drink but just okay  <EOR> We Wedding Reception Serendipity3 outside patio WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!

I guess seated weird time because couldn't order lunch menu because brunch still even though lunch started 10 min later?  Whatever     The service slow  wasn't even busy   waiters rude   food worth wait price   frozen hot chocolate tasted watered down don't why people rave it     If want food elsewhere   If want desserts order takeout to go window guess   If want nice ambiance something HERE   Walk strip     I left definitely tummy stuffed  <EOR> Awesome place casual date night  Amazing ice creams tasty appetizers  fan price but over look special occasion  <EOR> This place disappointment   wife decided give place try seeing Food Network   Although restaurant walk area empty took half hour order   ice cream sundae frozen hot chocolate   pricey way sweet   understand desserts supposed super rich decadent but overkill point inedible   probably ate quarter order threw rest away   Also would kill guys wipe down outdoor seating once while?  Everything sticky attracting bugs  <EOR> If negative stars option would getting  Russian lady front flat RUDE when asked veggie vegan option  Please consider being more accommodating your guests special needs  She made feel wrong eat meat  <EOR> I really high expectations place first mistake  group girls hostess told would hour wait!

Anyway food okay Mac Cheese which admit pretty good  decided share frozen hot chocolate don't all fuss about? doesn't taste anything special  best part busser spilled purse when taking table didn't bother let know  discovered later when wondering sticky dark substance purse    I also splitting bills gets annoying because requires much more pushing buttons but splitting 2 cards shouldn't hard  told waitress put each she repeated back said yes  She came back put entire bill 1 card what? asked correct boy she pissed    Overall food okay great but horrible service  Would again  <EOR> Its right front decadent caesars palace hotel someone told frozen hot chocolate  idea hot chocolate but frozen intrigued gave try  very good tasty  <EOR> This restaurant overhyped  giving control 8 year old asking create menu     Food nothing inspiring items menu ingredients random don't work well together  Price overpriced  $20 hotdog? justify that? $19 nachos? nothing special it   Service horrible We 11 person group gratuity automatically included   server couldn't care less  soda glass crack running down halfway it  When told all she said Thanks  Seriously? <EOR> The frozen hot chocolate total letdown  expected greatness gritty super sweet concoction tasted powder hot cocoa packs blended ice  milkshake $11 also letdown  Save hassle worst it  <EOR> Only tried 'famous' frozen hot chocolate take away didn't sit but doubt would change anything kitchen same    The drink really bad basically some chocolate powder milk cream top  guess people place mostly 16 years old girls don't know any better   My impression place survives only because its position nice patio   The service doesn't seem better food  When entered waited few minutes anyone give table few waitresses taking each other corner didn't bother talking us  Only way told place full 45 minutes waiting time   We decided try chocolate take away since only 8 10 person line window  That took almost much waiting table 30 minutes only because some people front gave left exasperated  No surprise since girls kitchen basically doing chocolates instead taking few orders pipelining bit   Finally girls don't even take time refill napkins spoons customers  All people front lean inside window steal them cardboard boxes sitting shelves  <EOR> Ok admit review actually location   regrettably hung over here   But lovely friends visited NY location kind enough some famous frozen hot chocolate mix serve recent dinner party   Having never tried straight Serendipity's didn't know expect but according them definitely tastes same   thought tasted pretty good but yes did sort remind frosty Wendy's  sort gourmet version it   still hope try NY day but many reviews noted   if don't want wait long mix anytime want   Wait time only long takes whip blender   mean if taste same buying directly them why not?! even sell Williams Sonoma  <EOR> Wow just gotta say HELL COMES FOOD?

Other long wait everything great reasonable price! <EOR> Breakfast saints sinners French toast log amazing huge but perfectly cooked tasted wonderful   Frozen hot chocolate tasty around lunch maybe tad overpriced  <EOR> I Vegas family Bar Night Club Convention few weeks ago ate last day there    If weather permits would advise sitting outside because stuffy uncomfortable inside  literally walking into sauna all opted wait 15 extra minutes outside table it nice day naturally patio longer wait     Our server really good pretty crowded saw other people having issues getting served  fact couple left sitting 20 minutes without even having drinks table  being said place probably hit miss service happened some lucky ones  bad can't remember server's name otherwise would totally recommend him!   The food actually pretty damn good  would recommend grilled cheese tomato basil soup crab cake sandwich  Those winners table  dad steak sandwich which he really enjoyed except he said needed some kind sauce  can't steak sandwich no horseradish sauce! All kitchen A1 bit disappointing but he did say meat cooked perfectly very tender  desserts epic course could only eat fourth portions out five ordered 4 desserts   BUT all delicious would definitely come back JUST world famous desserts    I gave three stars because seemingly shoddy service luckily weren't apart also because really need better ventilation inside  Otherwise good time! <EOR> Ever since watched movie Serendipity    scene movie where ate Serendipity restaurant NY Frozen Hot Chocolate   told myself if ever NY would try that   Luckily didn't travel far since opened Vegas! husband excited check place out   definitely fans place glad here   Ambiance comfortable    nothing fancy   Service good   ribs filet mignon daughter mac cheese   ended frozen hot white chocolate 2! delicious super yummy! daughter loved well!

Conveniently located center strip Serendipity offers wide range desserts good food   In time span two days managed come 3 times lunch dessert snack breakfast  hot wings great sundaes amazing!! However customers might wait seats   From decoration great service Serendipity definitely Vegas hot spot everyone should to    Personal Favorites Strawberry Sundae Frozen Hot Chocolate Hangover Omelet <EOR> This place good if kids   or your fiance acts kid   way cannot wrong   Prices little steep but look where are   Did think chocolate shake would cost 99 cents?  Stick sweets   Maybe venture into french fries type stuff    but much anything else   If want pizza then Spago   If want Southwestern food then Mesa Grill   If want burger then Mesa Grill Bobby's Burger Palace Fat Burger   BUT!  If want something sweet stop here   Try sit outside well because extremely loud inside   Also   count many low riders hydraulic cars see   some reason always start southern migration when visit Serendipity   guess drive south strip night hibernate Tropicana probably only affordable hotel splurging car   <EOR> This review take counter  ordered 4 different Sundaes   ice cream spectacular  don't list ingredients Sundaes careful when ordering  may end ice cream flavor don't like  <EOR> We heard much place want try frozen hot chocolate  waited line more 30 min serve turned only person ran cashier prepared take out   What disappointment! 10 buck frozen hot chocolate no better 2 buck Mc Donald ice Frappuccino! want wait 30 min this? don't think so!  My daughter friends insisted much better last time ate here  am sure she right maybe fact only guy ran whole take only much Serendipity owner does really care people wants take out?  What ever going back cross Serendipity3 list maybe yours too! <EOR> Pricey Wacky interior like 14 year old girl's bedroom Potentially long wait time  I'm basically only writing review mention specific thing veggie burger   Las Vegas really tough place find vegan food especially Strip  Serendipity 3 veggie burger menu really tasty  if want vegan order sourdough bread no butter mayo  I ordered to go bartender he very helpful way sure order handled correctly   Mind 15 bucks hell lot money veggie burger but yummy well when you're stuck sometimes pay starve    <EOR> I able try ice cream sunday! shame!  I husband friend  ordered pasta burger   My advice ask waiter big your order is  ordered each much person  ended asking box   Very good food ncie atmosphere   People just happy spending time each other taking pictures eating delicious foods deserts   Would definitely come back sunday!! sure!! <EOR> Food good service average best prices higher average   ate burgers pizza chili dogs lunch but paid dinner prices   Good food but NO value here  <EOR> So originally little heart set sweets but lunch time ordered real food    I liked sweet potato fries  Plus plus!  The steak sandwich just wasn't good  ton gristle tendons just good cut    The service good enjoyed idea    I just wish tried desserts! Ahhh! Next time next time     <EOR> MEH  wouldn't come back food generally mediocre   I think draw location right strip size portions insanely huge   Maybe if hungover would more excited  mojito highlight meal  Maybe if tried frozen hot chocolate would more impressed  seems hit here  <EOR> This mine husband first time here! amazing!!! waiter best but forgot name portions huge looked husband did touch plate now know next time share  Everything fresh mango pineapple mojito good refreshing! only down fall little pricey but definitely worth coming back next visit <EOR> The meat ball pasta gigantic! hot Chili amazing drunken people me! location perfect service ok  chocolate chip sundae heaven mouth  I would say place perfect anyone Vegas doesn't know where eat  place pop Strip definitely won't problem founding it  <EOR> Sooo hubby finally decided see whole frozen hot chocolate hype about    worth it? $10! All milkshake  Maybe chose wrong flavor which strawberry but none less expected way better price! hubby peanut butter he couldn't finish because he said rich $11!    Breakdown jalapeño cheddar pretzel 5 99 bad but crazy good  Nacho cheese dip $0 50  Small Strawberry frozen hot chocolate $10 tasted nestle quick never again  Small peanut butter frozen hot chocolate $11 rich sweet!  Total tax little snack $34 some change! Ridiculous? think so! Now don't want bash much because only tried menu which very limited but honest nothing sit down menu really wowed highly doubt giving them second chance  know frozen hot chocolate which major bust work done! Sorry serendipity you're just me! <EOR> First thing know Frozen Hot Chocolate things place known for  said probably serving size split between 2 people unless want all yourself    Also food portions huge  way over ordered wish sized down check bit    P S  footlong dog more foot     <EOR> My husband used voucher off Groupon  Waygu Beef Sliders he Full Monty sliders tiny 3 two bite burgers very dry  good through  felt sliders over priced especially appetizer any portion served  drinks awesome though  Key Lime Martini he Coco Berry Mojito  saving grace us  <EOR> I am little biased visited NY thus heart belongs NY  all pinked cute! wait supposed 30 minutes but turned only 15 minutes  Yay!  But place good still  Friendly 'for your information' everything meant shared  don't surprised when order appetizer beef nachos size your arm's length    Beef nachos huge palm sized red tortilla chips topped ground beef layered cheese  shared baby both equally stuffed    Frrrozen hot chocolate every time step into Serendipity  signature drink  Topped whipped cream shavings chocolate  When frrrozen hot chocolate expecting more bitter NY but turned sweeter  mention wasn't much ice crunchy texture  didn't really mine left sitting table whipped cream slowly dissolving into drink  No thank Serendipity 3  <EOR> LOVE super girly decor everything it  Pink overload but it    Came hot hot midday   and really needed some fuel  bit wait but seated quickly  Everything Alice Wonderland   extra large menus pink wallpaper grand chandeliers     My fried both avocado lovers settled ABC burger avocado brie caramalized onions  Delicious!! Such simple ingredients but everything just well together!! big enough 2 girls share    it very busy but server did manage refill waters    Of course ended late lunch famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate  huge chocolately drink one!! Yummy!  Can't wait come back treat again!! <EOR> There's much say Serendipity 3 hasn't already voiced 900+ reviews  popular stop tourists because literally sits right Strip easily accessed foot  could spend hours talking much hate set Caesar's Palace but won't  Bottom line when visiting Serendipity park valet else earn calories eat hiking only through Caesar's but then following breadcrumb trail Serendipity outside   There always wait particularly date nights Fri Sat if you're interested dining there's walk counter where order to go  full menu but staple items  wait long but some great people watching in   I'm big sweets signature frozen hot chocolate never highlight although yummy when spiked packs dangerously delicious punch! However little sweet true Serendipity theme heart stopping portion sizes  nutshell instant diabetes but likely worth if sweet tooth   My favorite Serendipity Caesar salad which believe comes two sizes appetizer King Kong  having dinner larger size wasn't able finish blame partly amazing croutons salad garnished with  Usually croutons just serve garnish sitting humbly top salad delicately scattered throughout  Serendipity Caesar croutons take main stage only enormous but best damn croutons ever eaten  can't even believe just spent three minutes writing them but good! They're buttery garlicky toasty perfect combo! outside soft chewy inside can't put finger kind bread used tried replicate them home never turn this  dressing perfect evenly distributed throughout salad  Towards end things little soggy tried power through fall face first food coma into plate but any salad start if sits long enough   The staff service most part forgettable  couple times staff neglectful incompetent attitude which guess expected place more often deals walk ins off Strip grossly over served now trying order sandwich while belligerently drunk   Yes prices border outrageous but restaurant prime real estate again place no sense portion control  All all nice place take hungry town friends  <EOR> This location right outside Caesars palace  your food takeout window sit down meal  chose sit outside since beautiful day I recommend   7 people all really enjoyed meal  <EOR> Serendipity 3 your paying place name = overpriced   Hot Fudge Sunday way overpriced    Their Frozen hot chocolate huge YUM! <EOR> Not impressed all Serendipity 3  wanting experience place quite sometime still hope NY location  met few friends Saturday night dessert  couple people line front 11p sat within 20 30 minutes  ordered carrot cake smores hot chocolate  carrot cake nothing special all  HUGE yes tasty NO  smores hot chocolate pretty good toasted marshmallows good but LOVE marshmallows  easy please right there  graham crackers good sort smushy cup think chocolate kisses it  ok  also shared frozen Oreo hot chocolate friend  something ever need try again  decor place also awful opinion  30 degrees outside thing Serendipity did going heat felt 100 degrees there  didn't try any meals but certainly wouldn't type meal if strip other selections  server very nice actually closed place down must 1A when left  <EOR> I curious try ever since heard $1 000 00 sundae but yeah didn't order lol! Sat bar because didn't want wait 15 minutes  each coke also mint chocochip sundae marshmallow cream fudge  pretty good but think should tried sundae deep fried oreos  Eh still pretty good anyway  <EOR> Just tried fries frozen hot chocolate   fries very common but frozen chocolate very tasty   last free <EOR> Maybe togo frozen hot chocolate different then dine in    served small plain cup like ones waitresses casino consisting ice light whip cream  Expecting look somewhat photo alcohol it? Since tempting family photos yelp bigger disappointment  <EOR> Serendipity! Great food portions  only las vegas strip steak sandwich 10 10  much frozen hot chocolate  tastes slush version swiss miss  overrated if ask Never going back especially customer service received last visit  seated never even waters  Another couple came few minutes served payed bill still didn't any help  seen but didn't even ask if ready order  decided eat somewhere else left none staff members management even said anything   why gave Serendipity star  CUSTOMER SERVICE plays big part food service  <EOR> First all name place SERENDIPITY 3  only 3 serendipity locations world  2 NY 1 vegas expect place busy  Summer vegas super hot bf while waiting meet friends  plenty tables inside outside  If don't want wait table then yourself favor sit bar  Since only try frozen hot chocolate didn't mind sitting bar   ordered classic frozen hot chocolate bf oreo frozen hot chocolate  All say mine better!    yummy! having icy milkshake u kinda chew chocolate sugar crystals thats best describe it   WANNA BACK VEGAS AGAIN!

Maybe its more worth 8 bucks opinion   I would definitely recommend friends check but wouldn't hype them because when something hyped create huge expectation should fabulous  Overall give Serendipity 3 solid 3 stars  waited good 45 minutes seated 3 friends share small chip appetizer having shake ourselves each spent $22 each including gratuity wait price didn't think quite worth it   but worth sense try something new different hyped should check out  <EOR> Ate breakfast very happy   Food quality portions great pretty decent service   Would definitely again if staying nearby  <EOR> SO CUTE   great fan movie some girlfriends when saw place Vegas figured well close enough now dragged boys us     We came lunch seriously melted cute entire place was   ordered seared ahi tuna salad boy ordered chicken sandwich criss cut fries   admit liked much more  But then again anything fried usually better greens   For desert frozen hot chocolate which absolutely delicious   While see people say drink bit over rated its still pretty delicious  place more ambiance feel   basically chocolate milk crushed ice whipped cream shaved chocolate top  can't come without getting this! <EOR> Had brunch place Thursday   no lines no wait   food average   hangover omelette   Way much fries   omelette stuff fries while having side fries   good combo   Also oreo desert good   But only good thing deserts   food good   Felt place eat desert food   member group ordered pizza burnt   told them take back comp which did     Overall would come food but would desert  <EOR> To more accurate I'd give place somewhere between 3 5 4   But since good time while lean more towards 4   During trip Vegas event friends came recommended friend New York   decided drop friend's birthday during second day Vegas dinner   We seated fairly quickly group seven only 5 10 minute wait    interior restaurant just screams pink girly    sure if style would well some but liked it    menu huge in both food selection actual menu little bit more expensive thought   ordered brie burger which thought just plain crazy but turned pretty good tasty!  didn't chance try frozen hot chocolate dang since busy surprise birthday sundae friend which good way    Having said place gets minus star since server MIA good part meal   He took orders gave food when ready    it   He didn't refill water even check see doing   wasn't toward end meal he said he someone else taking place    kinda late that   I'll keep eye restaurant if ever New York    hopefully then finally try frozen hot chocolate   Someday    <EOR> The to go line ridiculously long but once actually placed order Oreo frozen hot chocolate came very quickly   extremely disappointed mint though!  Guess brave long line again if want try it   The drink itself quite large came two straws making good treat share   definitely skimp whipped cream either!  very good prominent cookies cream taste but must have considering eyebrow raising price incredibly long line   Knocking off star being item seriously looking forward another having enough cashiers deal line  <EOR> The smores hot chocolate really hit spot! Plenty fresh hot or cold drinks any weather  Adorable date spot easy pick window if don't want sit down  Lighted patio seating  definitely knows set mood here  Bar inside full menu havent tried yet but cant wait til next time Loved here! <EOR> Triple Decker Grilled Cheese eyes focused on  portion size larger originally thought  Honestly best grilled cheese sandwiches very long time  opted tomato soup good dunk sandwich in  sis ordered Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate just needed cure craving  bit crazy location under construction couldn't even find server box check  Though would return but would probably order togo window wait until location fully renovated  <EOR> We couple cocktails enjoyed heat hitting few casino's felt great outside  little cha ching even Vegas but fun  Fall Winter outdoor seating full full all times day night  fun! <EOR> I'm only giving location 3 stars only because gave NY location 4 stars review earlier I'm partial original!!!    believe Frozen Hot Chocolate general gets 4 stars   maybe even 5 stars since few years since fell love birthplace!  Didn't meal but did see few dishes looked really good like foot long steak eggs sandwich which served open face WOW!    Looked over menu little different NY offer   also noticed some desserts weren't offered chocolate fondue fruit platter   Only time Frozen Hot Chocolate which slurped bar   would definitely time lunch next visit   Ideal location   sits right corner front Caesar's Palace   can't miss strip   looks bigger NY location but only facade   there's small floor indoor dining then patio  same size   Serendipity full bar   but Vegas restaurant Vegas doesn't serve liquor might well closed down build does! decor very diner esque   nothing NY except light fixtures resemble Tiffany lamps   One last thing different   there's walk window where order to go items   pretty cool if just want Frozen Hot Chocolate sip while losing all your $$$ slot machines!!! <EOR> We just arrived Las Vegas being plane since night before   checked into hotel starving looking someplace eat   Always heard Serendipity's New York try Caesar's Palace   It busy but wait only 20 minutes   Even though busy service good fast friendly    ordered Empire State Onion Rings app honey dijon chicken pizza lunch   Yikes servings huge!!

Mac n' cheese well! bartender super nice attentive considering circumstances even comped drink off bill    Still place but maybe next time just some ice cream <EOR> Came yesterday before leaving vegas worst experience ever here    sat outside waiter 50 people everything took forever but waiters fault   food part good when finally but dessert which deep fried snicker sundae came almost fully melted sent back second wasn't much better   11 morning ice cream should nice cold firm running liquid mess deep fried snickers weren't even deep fried cold just taken package  whole visit took 2 hour when should only tooken little over hour cause food ready but waiter just couldnt because dealing many people himself   Very disappointed visit place  <EOR> So finally try famous frozen hot chocolate!  Although good wasn't great expected be   Plus expensive!!   all can't really judge other stuff but just based alright!  Maybe just hyped me   maybe due fact tired sticky sweaty Vegas heat just kind exhausted day it late    Perhaps OG New York location would more exciting    would try there   atmosphere ambiance probably different there  <EOR> Don't waste your time  We walked grab last night find all workers clueless  Some people walked line due wait  Others waiting over 5 min just drink didnt receive order   We should walk away but waited  mistake  both ordered pretzel hard could used weapon  requested couple weren't hard dried out  response worker they're all that  She gave change  it   I also ordered frozen hot chocolate  saw TV years ago couldn't wait try it  definitely wasn't worth money   In end threw away pretzels complained wasted money all evening  <EOR> Everytime Vegas stop serendipity sundaes   ice cream toppings always fresh taste delicious  shared strawberry fields sundae  size sundaes big enough two more people  <EOR> Personally glorified fair food on strip no less   Had colossal hot dog french fries much talked frozen hot chocolate ice cream something just didnt gel right tasted powder   french fries weren't crisp enough first time  The atmosphere cool  If kids would bring them here   Otherwise lunching seeking good grub  not top choice <EOR> This second time visiting place  Last time service horrible food good but brought back dessert  gave second try food good service great frozen hot chocolate delicious    We frozen hot chocolate almonds liked better peanut butter one    I four stars because food good dessert  burger dry bit flavorless but bacon just right  fries seasoned better well  hot dogs okay but pizza amazing    Next time just stop dessert since food over priced is  <EOR> Our hotel concierge recommended place  came 9 month old she seemed really decor  Definitely family friendly place   I salad non lettuce salad  can't remember called  But chicken avocado corn chickpeas other goodies  oh god  Seriously good couldn't put fork down   Husband some pasta  He said good  He also deep fried oreo sundae which said good too  don't eat dairy no dessert me  desserts definitely sharing size though  <EOR> My main reason coming sugary sweet cotton candy martini   Totally awesome!   drinking blue cotton candy warning STRONG if you're lightweight two should kept one    I actually tried dinner weekend truffle macaroni cheese very good   husband spaghetti meatballs which also terrific   split piece peanut butter pie super rich tasty you'll want split all desserts instead having your own because portions huge bigger Claim Jumper portions if know mean    last time visited friend split frozen hot chocolate which also very good     I recommend making reservations advance place very small gets really busy  <EOR> Love it! probably because love movie Serendipity    The wait Serendipity always very long but less ridiculous if agree sit outside  During late winter early spring sitting outside quite chilly though uncomfortable all heat lamps  loved frozen hot chocolate which quite unique  share small frozen hot chocolate amongst three girls  it's big  Also mushroom quiche fresh greens top amazing very filling shared amongst two people  would definitely back but try earlier morning touristy crowds  <EOR> 4 11 10 Oh love thee ice cream try serendipity would treat say  brunch time ordered French Toast Log really thinking why called log until came out  huge  actually long famous hot dog   I can't believe least foot long  should also see sausages came it  don't know big  little scary eating first  famous frozen hot chocolate nothing but cold chocolate  didn't think anything spectacular it  However did food  chicken salad cheeseburger French toast log all great  wouldn't wait line just eat though  only reason why came because cousin crazy though frozen hot chocolate boy disappointed nothing more is  food good enough enjoy  Big portions can't wrong that  Next time gotta try sundae instead  <EOR> 3 stars now updating review hopefully number stars once try more items menu  few weeks ago when friend suggested grab some desserts  he'd suggested place amazed find actually desserts locations around here  second time vegas although i'd all places strip guess never paid much attention passed place  ordered forbidden broadway sundae pretty big  actually should pretty big    because pretty damn pricey! best friend friend shared ended being able finish it  wayyy sweet all pretty sick towards end especially when ice cream become all melted  overall you'd expect sundae  nothing spectacular   but still want back try least few other things before being satisfied review  <EOR> This place top list hearing original east coast location years  many flavor choices yes bit pricey but FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE since Vegas strip well worth indulgence  rest menu hit miss decor meh  Next time probably mine go  <EOR> AMAZING! Frozen Hot Chocolate DIE FOR  Oprah's favorite dessert egg croissanwhich good! never leave Vegas without going here! wait 30 minutes but worth it <EOR> I first caught wind Serendipity years ago when watched movie titled Serendipity  Although set New York found location Las Vegas well made priority visit it   1 Star being adorable! 1 Star menu selection massive portions 1 Star being delicious course! 1 Star small crowded wait time 45 minutes 1 Star don't own restroom past cafe down some stairs concrete underground bathroom area  honestly afraid going raped and or murdered down literally ran out  Hysterical looking back but time   pretty terrifying!! haha <EOR> Frozen Hot Chocolate!! yummy! Probably going back again but something experience least once  If don't wanna shell $10 bucks chocolate y drink also buy mix $5 bucks which 30 oz home  If enjoy trying touristy attractions then I'd go  Otherwise wouldn't eat meal food pricey looking everybody's food didn't look anything spectacular  <EOR> I wanted try frozen hot chocolate ever since saw movie Serendipity Kate Beckinsale John Cusack  Yes saw movie should too!  My friends came late lunch checking into hotel  Since already 4pm dinner reservations 7 30pm decided order few appetizers share  Luckily did because prices ridiculous! mean $15 50 grilled cheese? C'mon!   Anyways   back food  ordered tower onion rings buffalo wings ahi tuna salad two frozen hot chocolate for two share between five us  loved ahi tuna salad sauce good  onions rings cooked perfectly didn't all oil grease find most places  didn't any buffalo wings because braces didn't want stain clear bands yes braces hasn't?   frozen hot chocolate nice cold refreshing 100+ degree weather  little disappointed though  think all hype made expect better but just okay me  going buy mix take home but trying passed  drink again if come back another meal but wouldn't buy some take home   Overall liked food here  definitely pricey but large portions  If you're willing spend money experience then definitely try place  If you're type spend lot money food then all means skip  But you'll sorry missed experience! <EOR> TAKE AWAY food service mediocre heard New York better though   There's usually minimum 25 minute wait table longer if busy    People come name Frrrozen Hot Chocolate which costs $15 large    If you're looking novelty restaurant place where all hype place it   But expect nothing more   RECOMMENDATIONS TIPS best during off peak hours i e  afternoon    Frrrozen Hot Chocolate great try it does taste great but difficult justify $15 price tag   ALSO supposedly charge $4 sharing fee   able avoid because purchased 3 Frrrozen Hot Chocolate practically entrée prices itself    sweet potato fries good!

I hangover omelette best but defitnitley favorites consisted fries tomato bacon cheese much more comes side sweet potato regular fries  Overall great omelette   My buddy blue cheese burger  burger very well grilled bun nice fresh blue cheese perfect complement bacon beef   However frozen hot chocolate really good first two times third time its great maybe because winter cold crap but still good   You should sure come through try yourself if your Vegas! <EOR> Well time come write very first review Yelp  More specifically time come because people sick hearing talk places thought them real life  So off internet!  There's no better place cut reviewing teeth Serendipity3  There's good! There's bad! There's drama intrigu  truthfully there's much intrigue   The thing gets most Serendipity3 just much *potential* but man potential's hard live right? food more serviceable but just shy great  past weekend informed they'd started seasonal menu which means things transcend individually great might available  opinion those dishes *Mac Cheese Pizza* the punctuation shows highly regard it   apparently now winter food look if you'd oh say May  said most recent trip waitress woman named Phoenix extra mile making sure came ifyouknowwhatimean     My dining companion so fancy when say way! really just boyfriend Al but if can't fancy internet can't fancy anywhere ordered seasonal items sandwich called Summer Bries turkey brie apples cranberry mayo raisin pumpernickel bread  Because Al resigned himself lot things relationship eventually ended some sandwich  here's thing good sandwich but restaurant where dropped $80 meal 4 p m  wasn't could've been    The accompanying waffle fries because sweet potato fries people hate freedom if Arby's curly fries Chick Fil A's waffle fries baby but also baby some gourmet blood grandparent didn't immediately remind drive thru oil soaked cardboard  Let's clear means DELICIOUS   We requisite frozen hot chocolate which a  shrunk b  ordered accident individual one  still trying Phoenix time came didn't want ask  good always is  But good amount money cost? think probably depends several factors temperature outside time year whether I'd won $20 penny slots Caesars  Your factors probably vary especially if you're allergic chocolate you'd rather spend money booze  Doing frozen hot chocolate alcohol pop easily bumps your bill next price point   This past trip also first time sitting patio mostly because always busy never wanted wait  patio nice someone gets sudden random fits why are all people so damn close to me?! myself gives little bit more space around you  inside sometimes feel you're right top table next which imagine awful could Cavs fan seated next bunch people Garnett jerseys   Phoenix far away best waitress or waiter! ever  service little slow especially really really busy times but since they're always really really busy pretty much constant last year's birthday trip waited 45 minutes food without any sort acknowledgment management waiter  pretty easygoing mood trip but imagine happening different day rage blackout may followed   The last thing think worth mentioning is KIDS  perfect restaurant parents looking throw down just little coin something vaguely fancy but risk getting glares hundred stuffy be blazered diners  Where fall obviously your call  most recent trip watched boy squirm much chair fell over then he cried next five minutes but also watched baby happily blow spit bubbles way made want sing songs rainbows while skipping through meadow  heart light  <EOR> Long wait aren't even busy  Brunch served till 2 don't let u order off lunch menu    Waited hour all offer cup coffee free NEVER EAT HERE <EOR> Came just frozen hot chocolate  serving two perfect share  other couple thought sweet but boyfriend love sweets finished haha    From saw other tables ordering wouldn't come food  just looks typical American diner food Denny's    The restaurant smelled cheese which kind grossed but hot sit outside    Kinda overpriced drink $14 think but nice say you've tried it  Probably won't back since other places Vegas list check off  <EOR> Took son birthday some town family  Based other reviews thought food would but we'd love frozen hot chocolate  pleasantly surprised great taste food  server Marissa? pro did great job  ordered burgers steak sandwich crab cake salad Mac n cheese  Everything tasted great sure why others bad experience  told son's birthday when ordered frozen hot chocolate just expecting candle which would great   She brought surprise 2 little cakes Oreo filling candle  those tasted great too  sweet  would definitely back only dessert but food too! <EOR> Frozen hot chocolate      Mmmmmm little pricey $11 but where else going find frozen cup goodness? <EOR> The frozen hot chocolate PERFECT during summer  Pretty expensive but definitely worth it  large share someone   recommend to go line because always crowded inside at least 30 minute wait   <EOR> Whenever vegas buffets must  only come when childrens party usually just hop frozen hot chocolate here  Its worth sharing  other items usually order appetizers which ok best  never chance try main entrees here  overpriced personally rather buffet ceasars  <EOR> Food okay did togo window  paid $100 feed two salads burger hot dog couple drinks        they tried put very little lettuce cousins salad while mine plentiful asked more   I mean paying food appetizer  did though even though lady hesitated to     overall wont come again unless its frozen hot chocolate which really good  <EOR> The deserts delicious  ordered frozen hot chocolate which delicious boyfriend ordered black white sundae  Now portions pretty big person would probably able finish theirs i know definitely wasn't     The customer service sucks badly though  Its extremely difficult any attention any waiters  Let alone them even serve water  waiter pretty rude too  made wait outside where any water mists  funny thing seats available place just move us  waited over hour just seat  quite disappointing really    The deserts little cute designs only highlight place  Other am sure if would come back place  <EOR> Is any drink ever worth $13 Vegas? answer NO unless there's alcohol involved  Which sadly isn't frozen hot chocolate  <EOR> Came family prices outrages ! understand strip prices more then usual but charging $30 dessert control   <EOR> Just imagine taste hot chocolate drink but frozen    It's okay but going spend $11 or $15 large drink    By way food too  <EOR> I made good decision yelped before stopping myself felt drawn Frozen Hot Chocolate while vacationing Vegas week ago   What amazing concept using hot cocoa mix chocolate instead syrup! think its overpoweringly sweet using concoction just right thickness where aren't sitting suffering loss air trying force drink through straw    Large for two $16  thinking small would done just fine cause large well large ha!   I'm fan! <EOR> Warning take long while your food  least when order through outside window  menu bit more limited but still good items  frozen hot chocolate something try just sounded   only thing wasn't keen sweet potato fries  didn't expect them extra sweet due added sugar spice sprinkle it  Other nice place grab something eat if time kill can't figure where else go  <EOR> Was really excited eat when walked busy all  asked hostess if could sit front street since nice day out  She seemed annoyed told would 10 15 mins told would wait she just gave look told would just eat back outside  130 when sat down  waitress didn't ask wanted drink she just said water good guys? She didn't check much all said wasn't busy inside confused that  menus brunch said ended 2pm thought maybe could lunch menus  asked waitress lunch menus 140 she told no doesn't start until 2pm brunch menus which chicken fingers burgers  ended getting bbq chicken pizza mediocre nothing rave worth $21  weren't happy service decided dessert somewhere else  <EOR> Nice atmosphere patio but food below average   hamburger way over cooked no flavor   Many better options area <EOR> Well say food great! best chilly cheese fries ever!!!!! But customer service bad  server Tina friendly all top rude seemed annoyed  really hope customer service improves! Also place cheap!! <EOR> The atmosphere awkward some reason can't put finger it    but reminds cafeteria alice in wonderland kinda vibe  nevertheless if you're vegas want spot take cutie met da club night prior I could tell several around when spot  Here's suggestion  Pretend impromptu come without reservation wait 15 20 min seated away doors if cold hell outside fun appetizers scope your lady less 20 bucks  Don't green tea shake tasted ass  should seriously put 2 cups sugar shit   Your lady place better Denny's mind sensible your budget just unique enough sorta seem interesting  Best luck <EOR> I don't know Frozen Hot Chocolate  think more hype curiosity name frozen hot chocolate anything else  server attentive food ok desserts   of course entertaining  fun! portions huge  Two three persons share item menu plus dessert lot food  <EOR> The food good night out  Huge portions Oliver waiter outstanding!!!!! Highly recommended  <EOR> I didn't try anything else except frozen hot chocolate  pretty good sweet  perfect hot weathers Vegas  kind pricey just hot chocolate though  still think worth visit when Vegas  located right outside Caesar's Palace  supposedly long wait signed seating 30 min wait but noticed to go orders just order window sit outside  downside many selection food when seated inside  <EOR> Thank fellow yelpers changing life frozen hot chocolate time!  I absolutely loved frozen hot chocolate  many flavors choose but decided OG original because felt would steered wrong   taste drink something could really describe  definitely frosty milk shake but something between  topped whip cream served two straws Mom share   The only reason could give five stars Serendipity fact took 45 minutes drink  wait long relatively short line  only man working register man making dishes   wait inside hour 11 00 PM  If staffed restaurant better would totally five star book   If near Caesars when Vegas regardless wait stop try drink  worth definitely nice treat desert heat  <EOR> Food truffle Mac cheese  portion size pretty big! looks really small but heavy ate 2 3 meals  didn't much tasted pretty bland me  add tons salt even then still tasted bland  friend ordered hot dog pizza sandwich all portion sizes huge! Definitely every entree shared between 2 people  Everything tastes average nothing special  Definitely worth price!!  Price Mac n cheese $18 pizza hot dog $17 sandwich $20  worth it   Service service pretty good everyone really nice helpful    Ambiance lot people eating having desserts only maybe  they're better here  ice cream parlor decor brightly lit looks very cute! Good kids maybe sharing dessert date! <EOR> Tried strictly famous frozen hot chocolate yummy treat Serendipity 3 earned 3 stars   However everything else? Umm much  chili dog alright Chinese chicken salad blah  No matter much dressing poured top could force myself even pretend it  sweet fries only slightly better salad rarely meet frie don't absolutely love! No joke fries weakness!  Customer service 0 1 star  server must having bad year because perma scowl face would away no matter much smiled thanked her    I returning joint  may also allow bad experience prevent checking out original Serendipity NYC    Oh hoped turn out better  Sigh  <EOR> Came friends highly recommended cold hot chocolate   Before continue rest review want let people know mean frozen hot chocolate  flavors other chocolate chocolate them  Thus amaretto version really just almond flavor chocolate  If want mixed flavors let them know   Now onto experience  restaurant pink white diner lots cookie artwork wall checkerboard tables  group 5 ordered 2 frozen hot chocolates 2  sampled amaretto which pretty good  size dual cup seems large top lot whipped cream but would say cup much more 20 ounces which unfortunate whopping $15 charge cup   In terms food tried chicken wings fries  steak fries pretty good good seasoning  chicken wings  HIGHLY recommend them! nice spicy light honey taste underneath seemed come primary marinade before deep fried  also juicy kind chicken wing filled meat   Overall dining experience good but since frozen hot chocolate draw I'd say careful having high expectations  glorified milkshake  Some sundaes also looked really good may more substantive value  still may back wings P <EOR> I same exact thoughts Claire L  I'd rather frosty Wendy's   Not worth wait  don't even whole waiting thing when there's clearly enough space sit everyone! Maybe huge menus taking space? Haha!  We ordered regular which meant person but friend couldn't even finished it  Felt $12 punishment  UGH! six bucks    <EOR> one word OVERRATED!

Great outdoor atmosphere great food  wife late breakfast  breakfast burger which amazing!

Thought kinda funny but whatever  Waiter came took orders    and began     Food took 30 40 mins come out  shrimp pesto pasta  kinda bland generously poured salt pepper all over it  2 friends pizza I forgot kind bf steak standwich  didnt try pizza but seemed mediocre friends' reaction  steak sandwich pretty good except bf ordered medium well but steak red  He still ate bec he likes rare also  Before forgot mention waiter forgot give napkins utensils  friend attention ask some  also asked parmesan cheese red pepper pizza never them  while just tired waiting server asking things never get  2 different servers also refilled glasses wrong drinks  tell gonna pour but before even say no they've already poured wrong thing tell right drink but wrong drink comes pitcher  didnt know whether laugh mad  just bewildered catastrophic lunch  Customer next before didnt order until already done eating! soon food came she also stormed right just prove point  main server said kitchen backed up  wanted tell plenty really busy restaurants but service remains excellent  everything just seemed all gone wrong!  The 1 star frozen hot chocolate   that only thing ever order if ever come back order to go  <EOR> Entering restaurant greeted smile   But person seated just seemed bad day  No smile no positive vibes she wanted help find table    Service fine  Food fine too  But expected way more  don't know why but did   Walked looked plain simple    The menu hard read  lot going menu ask little guidance   font bad  <EOR> Just ate ordered ABC Burger dry tasteless turd sweet potato fries horrible onion rings burnt too  dessert deep fried Oreo cookie sundae good but doesn't burger  If want dessert ok but  it! <EOR> Definitely worth wait!  crab cakes best thing menu   reservation if know ahead time when you'll going   =      otherwise text when your tables ready don't stand around wait hour  <EOR> if im vegas im eating buffet fancy restaurant probably eating here   the portions humongous  ordered french toast LOG yes log share friend still couldn't finish  pretty hungry  side berries semi healthyish meal  but im pretty sure frozen hot chocolate overshadowed any kind healthiness  but hey vegas indulge   i think best value food strip  im just comparing $12 dingy salad food court palazzo venetian compared $18 LOG   only negative thing expected wait time usually never long  said 45 min wait time  but buzzer sounded 20 min  last time came said 2 hr wait walked around strip came back 1 5 hr turned already called us  <EOR> This those places where probably want once say there   frozen Hot Chocolate good but worth hype price   Frankly regular hot chocolate better    Overall overpriced crowded small high ambient noise level but hey strip right front Caesar's would expect? <EOR> Something isn't right here  When see place only half capacity would think it'd easy grab table  NOPE  Apparently means they're booked whole night  hell guys serving?! Ghosts? Bah whatever frozen hot chocolates side windows result   We ended trying white chocolate double chocolate frozen hot chocolates  really didn't know expect  head thinking something along lines fried ice cream where fried crispy warm batter top ice cream except hot chocolate  flash frozen somehow  Nope mindfuck just cold chocolate drink ended being overly sweet especially white chocolate  Probably won't ever try again   Fun fact frozen hot chocolates don't give brain freeze  able fist 8 straws drink through all them simultaneously champ but didn't succumb mind numbing power  think Serendipity last laugh though because think just cavity pre diabetic status drinking them  <EOR> The food very good just bit pricey get   burger which bit over done but tasted great anyway   sweet potato fries came very good well   say tasting friend's Mac Cheese Pizza     If ordered might 4 5 star review   tasty   small sip frozen hot chocolate great chocolate flavor nice silky consistency   spinach dip so so   all bad place prices good location but food doesn't quite back up  <EOR> We came sweet treat told weren't any tables available   biggest pet peeves Vegas   tables everywhere   ordered ice cream treats cash register sit outside patio   bartender asked if wanted table anything eat drink   how communicating better?!

Wth??? <EOR> I only came frozen hot chocolate   just see about   Honestly quite disappointing   hoping stronger chocolate flavor   okay mainly because sitting outside patio scorching heat   service great but won't coming back here  <EOR> Went packed Saturday night frozen hot chocolate boyfriend  He also alcoholic root beer float    We going table but 10 minutes waiting bartender came asked if would sit bar which said yes walked right in  Service excellent bartender always made sure okay everything needed   This hot chocolate huge even two could barely finish it  Wonderful presentation would great comfortable 4th+ date since both sip through straws googly eyes each other  Aww    His root beer float pretty good couldn't taste alcohol which could meant good bad thing!

No walked before tables werent dirty?  Why wait?  Waiter came over asked doing   told waited fishbowls never came   More less deadpan expression said 'Well still want it?'  No good sir want delicious food heard about   Waiter took drink orders 2 sodas           10 mins later no sodas   20 minutes later no sodas   No else seated around minus table directly behind which family 3 apparently same position because younger guy sleeping table   We left 20 minute mark without being served drinks   some lacking service Vegas but place takes cake   Overpriced menu which would forgotten but lack service top overpriced menu just thumb eye squirt lemon juice  <EOR> Second visit Serendipity past weekend lunch time   Food great   thought there'd wait Sunday afternoon but wasn't   lovely table patio overlooking strip   enjoyable   ordered Chicken Waffles   chicken mediocre   Maybe just prefer greasy KFC much better   However waffles good   Big thick crunchy outside pieces   husband Chicken Strips   Nothing spectacular   Tasted same something could place TGIFs but dipping sauces good   little disappointed lunch menu isn't good dinner menu   I'd much rather dinner   Especially since love chicken pot pie chicken alfredo much   Again full even think trying dessert   Even though wasn't blown away food still love Serendipity  <EOR> Stopped dinner because curious try out   Ordered Buffalo Chicken Pizza Lobster Artichoke Dip Carrot Cake Sundae    Out all favorite dip  creamy stayed consistently hot long duration time ate it  dip didn't ball string up  Hard keep hands off bite sized bread slices came dip because delicious!  The pizza other hand lot spicier expected  Tons cheese found myself scraping off some cheese  blu cheese crumble added some flavor otherwise large mass mozzarella    Ended sundae satisfied  thought would mix carrot cake ice cream but simply smack dab piece carrot cake balanced top sundae  tasted good but felt if could home    Overall service good but thing surprised interior restaurant seemed cafeteria ish   Painted concrete floor  Very echo ey hard hear when conversing    I'm glad tried place but time thing  <EOR> Karen rude server doesn't seem even want there  Sets people any order she wants even if your waiting before them  Slow staff  <EOR> Came try famous frozen hot chocolate  okay! pretty crappy service when visited  No paid attention us  hard water  Boohoo  Frozen hot chocolate basically cold ice hot cocoa  don't let choose type chocolate  think sugar factory actually gives option dark milk  remember liking dark version much better  Unfortunately stop making it! <EOR> I super excited try place   well 'cause movie!  This place REALLY CUTE! Tiffany lamp  condiment holder things center each table just overall decor reminded kind alice wonderland   I hard time deciding eat but ended high heel pump  pretty good definitely different  thought sandwich HUGE  saved dinner fries good but feel same thing Carl's Jr half price  maybe getting chips would've better idea    My friends ravioli pizza tomatoes chicken noodle soup   The ravioli pizza seemed mediocre nothing special  The friend ordered chicken noodle soup RAVING but being hungover may factor     haha   We topped off meal course frozen hot chocolate! guess overhyped but bad either   Maybe day try $1 000 P   As service everyone saying wasn't good   but thought pretty good  server came over few times ask meal he friendly! No complaints   I looked other tables seemed order burgers salads   and portions HUGE  maybe should try those sometime   But sure if would come back because dude vegas  why settled burgers salads?!  I also saw omelettes   it looked monstrous  in good fattening way OH the frozen hotchocolate like  $1 20 cheaper outside to go window! <EOR> Overall good place grab quick snack  Definitely try foot long hot dogs frozen hot chocolate! bit pricey but Vegas   what's cheap here? I'd give 4 5 because expecting something spectacular frozen hot chocolate but pretty much tastes really good Starbucks frap still worth shot if you've never before though  <EOR> The desserts good! <EOR> 5 minute wait   Wow totally expected   almost tasted chocolate milk   seemed hot chocolate blended some ice layer whip cream top   ordered some berries which made little better     Eating outside would best cool day   Sitting elevated right along strip  <EOR> I can't believe haven't reviewed place  flavors ideas unique  When you're Vegas frozen hot chocolate Godsend  Def try frozen hot chocolate if you've never but sure inside big pretty bowl full experience  Oreo favorite flavor! <EOR> I made reservations 11 00am few days before Las Vegas sure did wait line   arrived 10 45am chance could seated early saw quite few tables open   people waiting outside walk ups placed name waiting list   saw table table fill walk ins even seating couple just walked hostess moment seated before us   11 00am checked hostess again request seating outside view strip told would seated sahortly  Five minutes later eventually seated outside view which very pleasant along weather   point experience great  ordered grilled artichoke remoulade order pank crusted mac cheese truffle oil sweet potato fries double frozen hot chocolate two   food very good much better expected  artichokes seasoned grilled nicely nice smokey flavor plenty yummy dipping sauce  macaroni rich decadent which kids said best ever  sweet potato fries came cute little [ail crispy well done   frozen hot chocolate good advertised whipped cream pieces chocolate drink   waitress service friendly efficient provided family great experience rough start  <EOR> Went lunch today some friends   wait seated 30 minutes    place ridiculously crowded   Once seated server came right away take drinks order   Service slow food but server courteous friendly awesome   noticed most people waited long time order   taco salad which massive   thought could more lettuce   But good   Also ordered mint frozen hot chocolate AMAZING!

I asked manager she also rudely told managers available talk me!! I never treated way anywhere Las Vegas   every time stop Serendipity sunday but incident    staff showed care paying customers cleanliness appearance restaurant stopping anymore!!!!! 03 20 2016 9 00pm <EOR> I'm kind puzzled hoorah Serendipity   Don't wrong food good frozen hot chocolates too   But something tells if another name plastered outside front door decor wasn't funky inside youngin's hipsters would probably come play   *Shrug*  I'd rather Vegas buffet on  <EOR> I inclined 4 stars but why?! Seriously no idea reasons low reviews!  We Sean G  back May Marnie super lucky it  First off seated before reservation time she came immediately drinks within 5 minutes taken food order 5 well  Marnie recommended crab cake sandwich off the Richter good martinis deeeelicious bday cake peanut butter cup !!!!   Top off great dinner great service phenomenal deep fried Oreo sundae    SHUT F% $K up! place f' real?! Amazing! Never more pleased meal  <EOR> Their stuff pretty creative filling  party 17 service point  even threw free frozen hot chocolate birthday girl but let tell you  not worth it! friend shared white chocolate really wasn't anything special fried oreos other hand looked scrumptious! definitely want give try next time! Everything made sharing suppose prices aren't all bad but definitely bit pricey! really worth visit! <EOR> My go to place ice cream when come Vegas   I'd recommend frozen hot chocolate any ice cream sundaes   tried several classic hot fudge deep fried oreos  black white   all very good won't disappoint     Some food options bit pricey but you're Vegas?  foot long chili dog really good you'll lot your money   always enjoyed really good service but wait grueling  <EOR> Deeply disappointed food drink but waiter terrific!  Pros Terrific waiter really top things   Nice guy too  Location right front Caesar's Palace  Cons Food quality hamburger sliders severely undercooked much ask manager done less 5 times 25 years   credit he did charge sliders they health hazard gave 20% discount poor kitchen performance  Speed kitchen restaurant terribly busy yet still order took more 30 minutes arrive  Drink quality Mixed drinks weak expensive   wife $14 basic frozen margarita she couldn't taste tequila   $10 basic bourbon water weak too  Prices pay convenient location strip front Caesar's Palace   $14 house frozen margarita?  Come on      Overall My whole family deeply disappointed experience   paid $102 basic dinner family five includes no charge raw slider hamburgers 20% discount rest bill 20% tip waiter terrific service   manager nice did push back all once he saw raw sliders appreciate response    worse   Still disappointed   family  <EOR> I heard much place when New York thought finally chance while Vegas there   glad did   group friends eaten much junk drank much alcohol last thing needed indulge ourselves dessert but frozen hot chocolate   best desserts had   small share plenty but sure could finished large too! If walking around Cesar's Palace try place won't disappointed   Also avoid long wait seating inside walk window same food price minus having tip long wait  <EOR> I'm really mad ate here    I Asian Chicken Salad  wasn't  terrible but could way better  However price wasn't bad  BF 1 foot hot dog once again terrible but better  Friends ordered burgers really looked sliders  tiny    The service so  did charge $1 cup water  thought water free everywhere??? <EOR> We skeptical place because reviews posted but some freebie vouchers decided give try   did small wait table but considering time chose eat wasn't long all   service great   waiter courteous top drinks refills despite being run off feet   food hot delicious   ordered Don't Drop Your Skirt Steak which cooked perfectly very flavorful chimichurri sauce   husband BBQ Bleu Burger discovered he's such fan blue cheese   Once he scraped off he said burger very good sweet potato fries die for   both full end meals didn't opt dessert but could see some great looking sundaes being delivered other tables  <EOR> Came good day  Sat outside patio  wasn't crowded attended right away wait food wasn't bad  15min wait maybe?  Girls love place  menu setting food very  um  girly feeling  frozen hot chocolate good couldn't finish it  entrees good portion  Prices affordable  <EOR> I love serendipity 3 New York  great ambiance feel little kid again looking wide eyed around all treasure chocolate magic chocolate find    This one   is quite same  to go order place outside which pretty useful indoor patio seating area  definitely didn't fantasy landish childlike daydream alice in wonderland feel other one  felt more glorified Mcdonalds  But hey its' Vegas right maybe feeling lil kid would much    We ordered  ABC burger Avocado brie caramalized onions  Sounded delicious but wasn't  love burgers would rather n Out  3 bucks instead TWELVE    Chicken pot pie NO  nonononono  Two ppl ordered neither finished more few bites    Hangover omelet better dishes omelete bacon egg french fries  But even only okay which sucks because bacon french fries almost cheating! Overall just really    eggy    Corned Beef Reuben Pretty damn good  Thick slices corned beef  But isn't supposed jewish deli  Still good sandwich though   Frozen Hot Chocolate Just good NY  amazing    Come dessert  don't eat lunch dinner unless want shell 12 + bucks mediocre food  Bring your date though watch freaking Godzilla sized sundaes brought out! <EOR> Too much build up? After seeing food tv showcase NY eatery build frozen hot chocolate greatest thing since sliced bread amped totry place out  Since huge brunch wife split frozen chocolate very hot day but neither thrilled outcome  chocolatey but really tasted more watered down shake anything else  Refreshing yes world changing  not really   The rest food looked pretty good affordable even though didn't try it  <EOR> *This review desserts only*   I've wanting come months should say years? Reading reviews beforehand already knew food alright pretty expensive similar all other restaurants strip   honestly came desserts wasn't disappointed  Oreo frozen hot chocolate good    Pretty big share few others  Definitely coming back next time Vegas  <EOR> Overpriced  Overpriced  Overpriced   The quality food comparable fast food except much more expensive price  Don't expect much frozen hot chocolate  same thing McD's    Tourist trap  <EOR> This place carrot cake  Serendipity 3 infamous $1K gold sundae but most attracted carrot cake concoction  love carrot cakes delicious  Moist layers spicy cake filled cream cheese frosting topped whipped cream white chocolate drizzles shavings  decadent hunk cake sitting atop bowl walnut mixed ice cream  big portion probably meant but sharing but just wanted all myself  best carrot cakes hands down! <EOR> I friend because hype enjoyed experience   The server very good pretty easy eyes bonus p   As food ordered side salad Kobe beef sliders meal   side salad very nice bunch different vegetables very large but unfortunately overdressed which bad because otherwise pretty tasty   should've asked dressing side   I really enjoyed sliders 4 them only ate two since saving room dessert   think average person adequate sized meal   burgers cooked more medium rare side which like   juicy tasty   bacon aioli great   Of course try frozen hot chocolate dessert   way huge person but managed finish 3 4 it   sure I'd rush back order but glad least tried once good   bad melts fast though   ordered original but if back again think I'd try another sounds Frozen Oreo popular   <EOR> im going short sweet !  if your vegas must 3 times every time its great ! always las vegas steak egg sandwich last time did deep fried snickers sundae !!! <EOR> I dragged boyfriend friend try place  NYC location few years ago just wanted see Vegas location see compares  Unfortunately love NYC location WAY more  much larger service great but just didn't exact same feeling walking into comparison NYC one   The wait significantly shorter though must say  NYC waited 30 45 minutes table place cramped  location waited only 10 minutes  But still just lacked certain charm all   The menu very extensive very large! Literally! But most famous thing order Frozen Hot Chocolate  Luckily boyfriend shared  tempted own but just couldn't it  HUGE! pretty yummy overly sweet  boyfriend normally doesn't chocolate desserts but he seemed one    Overall come dessert ambiance   it's very cute feel kid again! <EOR> First time group 4 rainy Monday Las Vegas    finally seated friendly waitress half hour wait   food okayy   kind disappointed because place hyped sounded must try Vegas     Had chance try Kobe Beef Sliders Hot Dog Clam Chowder soup Frozen Hot Chocolate which supposedly best thing everrrr   BBQ Chicken pizza Hangover omlette sweet potato fries   food tasted should   Nothing special besides fact prices doubled should cost portions messed around with   sliders really cute small but worth 9 because kobe patties used tasted any other patty   guacamole hot dog good but hot dog just hot dog except longer   Basically everything just average  Dont worked hypeeee!!!  Overall I'd say come atmosphere   ambience nice design restaurant cute wanna say  girly   The service friendly  frozen hot chocolate appealing eyes but just tastes little melted down chocolate shake  Everything else pretty mediocre  Probably won't come back unless its hot friends want share expensive chocolate shake  Another disappointing thing clam chowder sweet potato fries came lukewarm hot all   Don't know if because cold day just bit bummed chowder cold but its bad     check pictures <EOR> I'm reviewing only frozen hot chocolate because  all had   even inside   ordered outside Express window    also only item interested try   name intriguing    maybe  why many people want try too?  After all hype heard conclusion good but worth price wait   boyfriend ordered frozen hot chocolate 2 which cost $14 much bigger regular size $10   would pissed off if ordered small $10   other flavors though! Those could interesting next time   The original just tastes chocolate smoothie  frappuccino but guess smoother more chocolatey   thin chocolate milkshake   It reminded frosty   If crave could Wendy's 14 frosty's  <EOR> The frozen hot chocolate good but great  Reminds mocha frappuchinos used Baskin Robbins kid    Pricey but worth if you're sweltering heat Las Vegas strip  <EOR> Ice cream deserves 5 stars but food meh   Nothing write home but can't say no sundae divine   Serendipity NYC before remember really liking food desserts Serendipity 3 needs step up  <EOR> I've dying try place finally going past weekend memorial day weekend    I say must visit place when you're Vegas most especially if love desserts    We brunch family reason am only giving 4 stars because food quite ordinary  felt somewhere else order same but better version it   On other hand ordering Mint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate forgot brunch just fell love dessert  good literally sipped gone 30 seconds  Lol  I highly recommend place just desserts  can't wait back try other desserts menu    My next goal visit serendipity New York  Hopefully soon!   #happytummy #serendipity3 #lasvegas <EOR> When came wasn't very crowded but still asked wait 15 minutes  waited 5 mins table ready  texted let know when your table ready  Las vegas Strip breaded chicken tender dipping sauces Central Park Omelette  good okay  highlight Frrrozen Hot chocolate  whipped cream very good  lot people ordered too! <EOR> Generous portions great brunch atmosphere  Very busy lively  Figure 1 1 2 hours meal  <EOR> Serendipity fortunate accident   fortunately happy dining here     Located front Caesars can't miss pink decor building  before just famous frozen hot chocolate   friend wanted come eat obliged   pleasant experience versus previous time   Service good food better     We split T BLT sandwich onion rings   more enough food both us   onion rings great flavor since dusted Romano cheese   sandwich piled high turkey bacon lettuce tomato sourdough   Everything tasty would order again   course she try frozen hot chocolate   better first time happy she liked well     Prices little high don't forget your Total Rewards card knock off few bucks  <EOR> Gave them star because couldn't no stars   The food fairly decent but world  service lacks  difficult treat customers well front them accommodating    We group 5 server extremely rude even made comments toward left    For town host trade shows borders California easy visit Vegas often  Since visit January 2014 returned Serendipity 3 ever plan again  <EOR> Went Serendipity 3 first time honestly say disappointed  serendipity virgin server recommended bite  CRAB CAKE salad  absolutely amazing  sauce delicious crab cake extremely fresh tasting  also frozen hot  chocolate loved it! girlfriend however eggs benedict hollandaise sause interesting taste would recommend dish ! <EOR> They now sunday brunch french toast waffles look amazing  frozen hot chocolate yummiest things ever had  Love atmosphere  great service best desserts vegas! <EOR> Everything looks tasty  Lines long but  usually good sign   serving size smaller expected shared hubby  decent nothing brag about   had iced hot chocolate <EOR> This review based strictly Frozen Hot Chocolate but EW seriously?!

Serendipity also features $1000 Golden Opulence Sundae   gem must ordered 48 hours advance kind time?  haven't clue could possibly put thing worth kind bank but wasn't find out   Maybe addict thought?  Serendipity offers plenty other food choices well but never tried that   says cannot desert place dinner?? <EOR> So place birthday    expectations set high sadly did meet  assumed meals would large portions prices neutral but complete opposite  food good especially prices  did enjoy decor though! ALSO frozen hot chocolate let down expected different  <EOR> It alright but overpriced  Ordered chili cheese dog avocado seriously gave 3 4 slices THINLY sliced avocado    WTF?   The service sucked cold fuck outside sat door    which fine until decided keep door open because smells food going keep open   asked if could move another table because cold it low 40's waitress gave shit attitude manager believe check if could  didn't really see why since 3 4 open tables maybe 2 parties waiting seated   The waitress didn't even bother helping move drinks other table couldn't pick cup move but already brought plates utensils out  But seriously move stuff ourselves    left shit tip   Would received 3 but service dragged down  <EOR> I high expectations when friends recommend place   I popped Serendipity 3 recently good friend mine town  didn't time meet dinner thought would good dessert spot   We shared Frozen Hot Chocolate  good great  Slightly watered down but did chocolatey overtone   To perfectly honest enjoyed more full flavored beverage Starbucks Coffee Bean   The environment seems very warm friendly inviting  staff very attentive  only redeeming factors  Meh  experienced better  BUT wasn't worst place world    Just being honest  <EOR> Where even begin!

Enjoy! =D <EOR> If looking fancy good food place   But if looking some sugar ice cream chocolate fix then yeah!  Food so so but drinks dessert great  <EOR> I remember being little sour when first saw well original restaurant TV frozen hot chocolate because honestly believed invented it    guess wasn't creative I'd hoped   but years later still couldn't pass trying spot out! wait 40 mins but walk around wasn't bad   I big ass hot dog which felt price fair accordance portion location  honestly super stuffed eating hot dog   but determined scoop ice cream despite stomach doubling size   The food good nothing special  Same ice cream  Both satisfying though    think place hyped just based off aesthetics nostalgic vibe even if place wasn't literally apart your childhood =p  Unless you're family kids cause fun sort thing I'd suggest skipping food maybe just coming dessert  There's tons better food options Vegas eating here  <EOR> Horrilble service  lot people working but no seems willing clear tables guests  tend customers wait forever bc slow service  New york much better   Food drinks overpriced! costs $15 hamburger   same size InnOUT  never come back place again    i don't mind paying $$$ food but least expect better service some overpriced food drinks  <EOR> Visited lunch promptly seated patio  Service bit slow but waitress obviously very busy when she did come around she did best sure everything needed   The food however left lot desired  friend chicken Cesar salad which $21 only three strips chicken two gigantic croutons impossible eat  Lettuce looked old wilted  chicken fingers buffalo style although portion generous wings soaked sauce soggy difficult enjoy  Next time order sauce side   Wanted give 2 stars but ordered frozen hot chocolate dessert delicious ordered single portion but plenty two! alone would bring back!  Overall recommend desserts but suggest eat dinner somewhere else first  <EOR> After didn't come Serendipity 3 last TWO trips Vegas made point stop most recent trip   The BFF immediately seated bar given menus  started Raspberry Soho she ordered Cotton Candy  decided share order potato skins  drinks delish! artistry into making Cotton Candy ridiculous! potato skins okay decided save room entree 5 cheese grilled cheese sandwich    This seriously best grilled cheese life  cheese ooey gooey delicious! could enough  retrospect wish hadn't ordered potato skins  overshadowed   We couldn't leave without trying world famous frozen hot chocolate  original flavor  Let warn thing HUGE! Definitely share friend  Secondly cup comes bowl don't afraid let spill  taste frozen hot chocolate reminded bit chocolate frosty Wendy's but more ice based    I loved atmosphere great music playing wish I'd written down bartender server's name because she phenomenal! <EOR> Heard good desserts here  Decided try  Frozen hot chocolate whatevers  Tastes chocolate shake  Nothing special  Decor didn't even look good  <EOR> Not sure why other reviewers would rate them low????  priviledge going early bday trip Las Vegas weekend March 25 March27 2011 awesome friends  mine   Anyways best friend's sister's idea must visit   She reserved table since earlyyyyy morning Saturday March 26 2011 order seated around 9 45pm but table slightly late us     LOL   waitresses didn't table time us   complaining because bff's sister ordered Frozen Iced Chocolate drink main specialty three share     I tried while having Serendipity House Coffee Nutmeg which made extremelyyyy strong LOL    I'm still complaining because house coffee kept awake throughout several hours into nite morning could enjoy Harrah's hotel where stayed some more before checking time 11am Sunday March 27th     <EOR> Very disappointed   Wife ordered egg white omelette   When she received made Egg Beaters   waiter made all kind excuses why made Egg Beaters   Manager said because recent Avian Flu breakout   Regardless no told would made Egg Beaters when menu said egg whites   salad ordered per menu made mixed greens   Instead plate cabbage   When questioned them all sorry     made no effort try amend problem customer happy   back!! <EOR> Famous frozen hot chocolate even more famous opulent sundae  $1 000 ice cream bit excessive think?! But don't worry there's plenty more choose from    I've always drawn Serendipity just because name alone  Such wonderful meaning  hopeless romantic can't help it  But back reality Vegas right strip prices bit high  expected  because only come special occasions birthdays dates  especially when family friends come visit too    Dine inside patio facing strip when weather permits  I'd recommend burgers they're very tasty  more specific ABC burger sweet potato fries  Nomnomnom! Ginormous salads strip steak sandwich da bomb sorry 90s kid can't help it   breakfast hangover omelet seasoned potatoes never disappoints  Ohh almost forgot strawberry fields sundae best! Strawberry fields forever! <EOR> A lovely spot outside  Stopped whim brunch  Cappuccino mediocre best  Milk scalded poorly steamed  Espresso even added shot tasted instant coffee  Here's really killed restrooms far most repulsive seen Vegas  guess going authentic NYC vibe because exactly public bathrooms NYC subway stations  vile almost walked off fear sanitary conditions place  Such disappointment   Oh yeah food ordered twist eggs Benedict  Would've quite good egg overcooked  essence fried hard boiled egg  <EOR> The best part meal frozen hot chocolate which comp'd Caesars    food best   sliders burnt which send back did want replacement since don't some 3 second rule happen replacement   tomato soup delicious but probably all canned  <EOR> Too much hype very premium pricing ok quality food! Frozen hot chocolate just chocolate milk shake some whip cream it wasn't described movie   Salmon bit stinky way small $31!   Even ambience seating wasn't great!   Me definitely recommending family friends  <EOR> Saw Serendipity 3 walking past Caesers Palace daughters 21st birthday 8 27 11   always wanted Serendipity NY thought we'd in   Daughter spoke hostess party 5 wanted sit inside   hostess said hour wait then asked if daughters birthday she wearing tiara hostess stepped inside minute came back said don't far   called table 5 minutes later!    The place cute inside!  waitress asked daughters name brought frozen hot chocolate first toppings candle staff announced birthday sang her     We all wanted frozen hot chocolates milk shakes only ordered appetizers   frozen hot chocolates very big could easily shared if didn't want different flavors    very good but around $11 beware that   potato skins sliders onion rings artichoke dip   food all very good      I'd back frozen hot chocolate appetizers     maybe both! <EOR> Frozen hot chocolate only reason visit place  NY location  waiting much shorter Caesars Palace store  <EOR> Horrible service food took forever come out  Considering weekday weekend <EOR> I've wanting try place because popular NY location close P  Everyone talks 'frozen hot chocolate' definitely try it   love hot chocolate different experience but those 'you try least once' things   I wish mojito instead because everyone says they're known but likely hood coming back slim none me    love chocolate big sweet tooth but just wasn't impressed food mediocre service just OK  <EOR> We very buy Friday night    wait 20 minutes but pagers walked around outdoors area Caesars  nice wait  food delicious service excellent  frozen hot chocolate course    yummy! am NYC am familiar Serendipity  excited when opened here    but waited while before checking out  am glad finally did    <EOR> Came  course frozen hot chocolate amazing service uninspiring excited visit waitress rude careless almost messed experience <EOR> Estive neste lugar cerca de três vezes   Sempre teve um atendimento fraco mas continuei insistindo   A última vez hoje foi gota d'agua  Depois de 15 minutos sentados nós não conseguimos que o garçom nos desse qualquer atenção  Mesmo já tendo escolhido no cardápio ele não parava para anotar o pedido   Detalhe o lugar estava vazio e cheio de mesas com pratos sujos   Pelo preço que cobram isso é inadmissível   Lugar repugnante  Não volto nunca mais! <EOR> Rating customer service front 430 pm place half empty  Still wait 20 minutes table  told dont table ready service party 6  Really?!?

Dunno   glad tried don't know if I'd back another honestly but worth trying  <EOR> I ordered Steak Sandwich w Fries Frozen Hot Chocolate   sandwich fries awesome please note sandwich HUGE ate open face   PB Frozen Hot Chocolate incredibly overrated quite dissapointed considering $11 milkshake  found sweet not enough dark chocolate notes Peanut Butter helped cut down sweetness   whipped cream Reese's cups top far best thing it     I did enjoy ambiance but its definitely your neighborhood diner kicked few notches   Considering price don't think would visit again  <EOR> I would ABSOLUTELY if you're Vegas   perfect time seated 2 00 way   just few minutes before   Then option Brunch menu lunch menu cheapest price both   meal great   Central Park Omelette all favorite ingredients! yummy yummy! friends steak sandwich loved chicken strips liked portobello burger liked well     The best part course frozen hot chocolate two which friend split   Absolutely sure try while you're there! Such different taste but yummy! <EOR> Avoid all costs worst service Vegas  food way over priced quality  If your looking dessert Caesars Palace area would reccomend Cheesecake Factory Forum Shops Caesars  <EOR> Best service food  am local when friends family visit always take them there  <EOR> Crappy service  3 waiter waitress changes 30 min  span  All desert  waited 25mins  just fried oreos frozen hot chocolate  Management needs step run place more efficiently  Oh hosts suck too  hard smile say hello then thank customer way out? <EOR> Came lunch  Ordered frozen hot chocolate which tasted very sinful but delicious  mains ordered hangover omelette which alittle disappointing because putting fries omelette just doesn't work  soggy doesn't blend well eggs  Central Park omelette very good though  Highly recommend people wish omelet  hot dog bun alright only nothing fantastic  Finally ordered Alfredo pasta which little creamy liking  Would come again  <EOR> The frozen hot chocolate good but food so  Ordered crab cakes omelette frozen desert frozen hot chocolate came first  portions fairly big shared two people  Would recommend eat else where come deserts  <EOR> Went sisters birthday  always fan serendipity NYC just try branch Vegas  loved it! valentines day able table without reservations  bigger NYC branch but quality food same  love sundaes course frozen hot chocolate! <EOR> FINALLY!!!!!

She also aloof attitude didn't appreciate  asked speak manager she offered take 20% off bill ask some sort rectification  always impressed establishments Caesars property surprised treated way here    As food decent but really overpriced   paying novelty  <EOR> Talk dessert full craziness but lets just point     Once again didn't know expect   knew original location New York only never chance visit it   reservations open giving try   Yes dining seemed all white pink cutesy but just felt another big name restaurant much offer high price   Service good which pretty much guaranteed second star   Here's ordered Double Frrrozen Hot Chocolate two $18 Yes eighteen bucks!

Came specifically dessert  Comes huge bowl ice cream enough share amongst three people or maybe three tiny asians haha   Ordered green tea peanut butter good!   a bit overpriced i think $11 bucks? mug ice cream but vegas   expect wait time seated  <EOR> Frozen Hot Chocolate?!?! Sounds Amazing! However      worth $10 price!!! tasted almost chocolate slushy sorts  Saturday evening restaurant 30 minute wait opted walk outside where order to go  drinks made fast easily shareable between two people but don't think worth $10 price tag  <EOR> It's great spot dessert only great dinner   prepared eat your dessert because portion good least 4 people  <EOR> If more loaded would ok but being sober   umm no  took super long time ordered off eat run menu  sweet potato fries chewy cold corn dog ridiculously hot  remember next time  <EOR> I've eaten handful times since opened  Overall food isn't super special honestly sometimes come lacking flavor tad overcooked    I'm local usually when eating tell everyone food isn't great but desserts good  frozen hot chocolate must every time eat here  place those places enjoy least once always suggest customers visiting family come dessert least    This place gets REALLY busy due name location  suggest call reservations otherwise eat bar which isn't bad all   Service experience ok   no complaints service efficiency  <EOR> Great food great portions   little pricey often crowded little loud but great place Vegas right outside Caesars  <EOR> Seriously delicious breakfast! second time both times enjoyed thoroughly   I suggest split your breakfast if possible  servers agreeable happily bring plates sharing   This time shared Saints Sinners  enormous loaf french toast topped sweet berries fresh whipped cream  served eggs crispy potatoes bacon    Oh coffee!

She rude  visit restaurant every time come Vegas  Maybe 3 4 times year but sure last time  ordered cup tea still haven't 20 min     <EOR> Service good   Food average   If your putting chicken waffles menu needs good!

Foodwise ok ordered pepper vodka pasta  Proportion average foor freshly cooked  friend ordered sundae thing good  waitress checking time time which think good considering stil over hostess' attitude  I guess servers know people still place dont permanent customers since its tourist's place why good customer service   My suggestion just  take out  Dine experience terrible! <EOR> 3 words  Frozen hot chocolate    That's hear most  only item tried but amazing!!! bit pricey since hot chocolate all but good  regular frozen hot chocolate frozen peanut butter hot chocolate  preference liked regular better peanut because peanut butter peanut buttery if know mean  just overpowering hot chocolate flavor    The frozen hot chocolate good  Imagine drinking hot chocolate but now cold blended  comes whipped cream everything! <EOR> Review based dessert only  humble pie anything but  If love peanut butter crust your favorite ice cream cake then try out  If you're looking huge desserts probably big take yourself you'll need share then come place   Their menu desserts huge varied  also serve drinks bar breakfast lunch menu   Be ready wait bit table because interior small even external seating busy   4 stars dessert sizes options  <EOR> good! LOUD   place cute   decor super girly    but portions manly sure  hangover omelet full only quarter portion   truly mix goodness fries cheese mushrooms bacon wrapped egg   genius     the  menu clever names wide variety takes 10  minutes read exactly everything   probably good idea before go   read before sometimes service slow [which assuming based busy is  ] luckily busy day    husband ahi which also excellent   serving tuna filled plate majority rice pilaf mixed sweet onions   sweet potato fries also must try    which served most plates   so getting point   black white sundae   half chocolate half vanilla   whipped cream white chocolate shavings   chocolate syrup strawberry tuxedo   [chocolate made look tux] covered strawberry   best part   otherwise big ass bowl ice cream   big deal     BUT also bite deep fried oreos which pleasantly much oreo e then thought  don't know everything that   but Oreo dope    so main main point   food food good  deserts typical    crazier things home [which have]     yogo bar cheaper  <EOR> Frozen hot chocolate grilled cheese sandwiches goldfishes swimming tomato soup creamy mac cheese best chili tried   Can't tell place   Las Vegas place! <EOR> Extremely large portions ordered nachos turned huge 3 share   Steak sandwich least foot long   Strongly consider sharing avoid feeling totally stuffed   Omelettes also huge excellent  <EOR> The ambiance really cute however can't say same food  brunch while Vegas best things frozen hot chocolate fries came w omelet  friends warned high expectations food glad didn't    sure place mess omelet  if your mood frozen hot chocolate some really deli sh fries   your place however Vegas plenty choices would recommend eating someplace else  <EOR> Heard all hype place when finally able back vegas went  Very nice place relaxed atmosphere  Food decent kinda wish gave little more though price  Desert other hand amazing  deep fried oreo sundae    All say YUM needed hit gym eating thing  Staff very friendly service good  Def  must stop now when vegas  <EOR> Having read Serendipity cookbook history daughter decided stop lunch   didn't read reviews prior coming   Asian chicken salad   Over dressed absolutely huge chicken dry didn't each most it   Daughter vegetable pizza ok she said but nothing couldn't somewhere else 1 2 price   server really good but food experience wouldn't recommend it  <EOR> I come lot every time ask Karen  She simply amazing  came Tuesday night small wait against better judgement didn't ask Karen  sat Renny obviously ready home he made clear saying well actions  chicken tenders completely raw no sense complaining because Renny wouldn't cared  Frozen hot chocolate amazing should've just outside eaten somewhere else least McDonalds employee would happy see even expected tip them! <EOR> I came first time when Vegas two other friends  first time heard place television course Golden Opulence Sundae wanted get  BUT 1 000 dollars   So decided settle signature dessert frozen hot chocolate  Since three decided meant two  And sundae   The sundae came didn't look great  just looked normal sundae  worth money sundae  But when frozen hot chocolate came  HUGE  two people couldn't finish but did  took all effort finish it   But zOmg sweet  wayyyyy much sugar  Sugar overload   Overall place alright  think good thing getting frozen hot chocolate golden opulence sundae  food menu seemed pretty normal  think only thing even though pretty simple menu portions HUGE  <EOR> The portions enormous holy cow    If need fishbowl full ice cream bananas all sorts sauces stop in   It's really place eat if you're strict diet even huevos rancheros intense  chorizo very tasty opinion but think all other friends semi enjoyed meals   I think main staple desserts crazy amazing  would ordered frozen hot chocolate but sadly service AWFUL    Only stop sweet stuff especially if you're rush out! <EOR> While want love place everything just mediocre  long ways Serendipity NYC   While inside cute some ways come expect traditional ice cream parlor seriously lacks ambiance  just little bright little sparse quite clean enough way busy many screaming children   The wait insanely ridiculous times  wait isn't really worth it  Come back when busy   Personally prefer dine outside  While service always seems slower outside good people watching just better experience overall   The food good  never anything bad  also never anything crave worthy exceptional   One best things wings  Definitely better places Vegas hot wings  Very meaty good quality wings  Lots sauce just right thickness spice sauce hint cinnamon   Excellent blue cheese sauce dipping   The hot dog mac 'n' cheese etc  all good  Again never anything bad  But none really stands either  while could justify prices because portions huge still just all seems way over priced   They great list sundaes other desserts  all good  But there's nothing great any them  ice cream isn't anything great hot fudge sauce isn't anything different anywhere else etc   Skip cocktails  While mostly all sound good none them actually good   Mediocre  Everything just fine but nothing great  specialness uniqueness sense magic experience Serendipity NYC just isn't Serendipity Vegas  <EOR> All sandwich pretzel here  Seems could've done better all it  people working don't seem care serve prepared  Really ad place right strip <EOR> 50 minutes grilled cheese sandwich tomato soup tastes subpar  tomato soup very sour creamy  tasted almost tomato paste   Also crab cake sandwich really dry crab meat  only thing  descent place frozen hot chocolate which why gave them 2 star instead 1 star  <EOR> The line into Serendipity 3 usually pretty crazy try bypass To Go line outside   The Frozen Hot Chocolate and cousins different flavors ok  really aren't amazing  if really long line move aren't missing much  Plus doesn't really taste same would original Serendipity New York   And some odd reason took good 15 minutes them Classic Sundae  Scooping some ice cream into cup pouring some hot fudge top really should take long  matters worse $10 dessert 2 3 whipped cream  thought paid sundae freaking shaving cream   Oh if eyeing sliders might want squint little bit because those things teeny tiny  <EOR> I some others Yelp yet try original NYC location s don't anything compare yet  being said should know Do prepared wait and Vegas summer heat little unpleasant Do order frozen iced chocolate it's kind Do prepared shell some money  famous touristy spot Strip anything else little pricier most places Do try food they're known desserts but food quite good too  Don't upset   the wait worth it Don't forget look intricate menus pretty cool tell story Serendipity NYC Don't fooled your waiter's selling tactics  may conveniently forget mention if order candy etc your frozen hot chocolate going cost more  Keep all mine enjoy your experience Serendipity  <EOR> Great tasting food large portions  If wasn't extreme long wait would given 5 stars  <EOR> Had great dinner experience serendipity  food 3 stars best but service made bump rating   Our server Dave polite fast super friendly  He treated family   The pizza excellent  burger average something would expect diner  fries came above average  Asian chicken salad wasn't great    We sat outside view vegas strip spectacular  <EOR> I see RED     RED Velvet is   After missing chance visit original location NYC last year thankful some time drop Vegas location dessert   NOTE Seating indoor outdoor   actually takeout window offers some selections regular menu   sure if full menu available takeout window though   We arrived slightly past 1pm much surprise seated immediately despite restaurant being very crowded   Since just finished very filling lunch agenda visit strictly dessert   I almost tempted order popular frozen hot chocolate but since chilly Vegas day decided regular hot chocolate instead   end friend shared red velvet sundae   indeed true sweet treat   chunk red velvet cake surrounded vanilla ice cream whip cream hot fudge rainbow sprinkles     Needless say lost battle attempt finish but more could manage   sundae generous portion quite possibly four people would finished entirely   BOTTOM LINE sweet treat Sin City   hope eventually try frozen hot chocolate future visit  <EOR> Two reviews two visits HOLIDAY 4 stars     don't seem full other restaurants New Year's Eve  Wait price wasn't bad  Hostess wasn't nice seated door inside  Since we're inside door every time somebody opens door really cold  few tables opened up  hostesses inside ignored good 3 minutes because busy gossiping  finally attention said can't transfer another table once already seated  Even though annoyed impoliteness hostesses inside outside tried dinner      server White male nice gave some recommendations eat meal  Another server Asian male also nice enough talk gave recommendations  food off New Year's Eve menu regularly served there  bacon gruyere Mac cheese sticks awesome but onion rings sub par  seafood risotto which excellent bummed didn't finish because full  boyfriend's prime rib juicy tender  full sundae molten chocolate cake which delicious  Boyfriend both happy  NYE meal came $100 excluding tip    REGULAR DAY 1 star    again because bummed full try famous Can't Say No Sundae which available take out section  made reservations via OpenTable Yelp  time told wait  hostess impolite dressed she's going workout  am surprised because  first time asked wait when reservation  10 minutes waiting she sit outside  thought would priority getting seated inside since made reservation  also thought heater since getting cold already but wasn't on  server ok but didn't server hostess fought front because hostess having big party sit table hostess done fixing yet  thought table clean just needs utensils  Why don't hostess since all she does stand look snob dressed sweats anyway  server also being professional sort shouting hostess  She should've pulled aside talked her announce all customers they're mess  Ok service bad regular days  it      food finally came waiting long  CRAB ARTICHOKE DIP good forced myself eat since hungry paid $13 it  boyfriend's LAS VEGAS PHILLY CHEESE STEAK SANDWICH $22 delicious hence 1 star  Then while CAN'T SAY NO SUNDAE  awesome hype goes  tastes regular drugstore sundae  cake good tastes cake you'd grocery store  ice cream itself just regular ice cream  would've better off getting gelato  disappointed      Even if live Vegas won't way now just eat considering there's ton places eat here     My recommendation EAT INSIDE restaurant unless holiday menu  JUST TO GO SECTION OUTSIDE  also sundaes well famous frozen hot chocolate  All Yelp reviews right service horrible  <EOR> I excited seeing restaurant previous trip Vegas  decor didn't disappoint because adorable inside frozen hot chocolate fantastic  ordered Full Monty cup tomato soup husband cheeseburger sweet potato fries  soup ok little sour side but wasn't horrible  Unfortunately sandwich awful  forgot bacon chicken breast char broiled point where all could taste burned flavor char lines  think going caramelized onions but caramelized point tasting burned well  Then slathered whole thing bbq sauce tangy  bummed but think may just ordered wrong  husband said burger really good sweet potato fries definitely yummy I'd willing again try something else just beware Full Monty if don't flavor charred food  <EOR> What happens Vegas stays Vegas right? wish true but seem memories Brunch Serendipity  group 4 guys arrived around noon for   brunch guess  least brunch time  wasn't wait table even though wanted seated inside  ready order pretty quickly but took waitress quite long while collect drink order which 3 waters coffee   Once finally ordered two settled Omelets two sandwiches  Then wait began again    About 20 minutes later food finally arrived  omelets normal size but very plain  omelet very dry if sitting under heat lamp while trust Vegas July knew feeling sitting under heat lamp     My cup fruit quite full measuring cup size but did fresh berries melons which nice  told sandwiches quite good obnoxiously large  friend ordered steak eggs which turned pound steak 18 hoagie 3 fried eggs bacon    When finished meal looked around waitress  Then waited  Then waited  Then waited  Then waited  point  Then she finally came told she would bring check  Then waited  Then waited  Finally check continued waiting pattern come back cards run them bring cards back    For all future Vegas trips intend skip place unless looking eat mediocre overpriced 30 minute meal leisurely crammed into 90 minutes  Normally would 1 star review but fiends enjoyed sandwiches least being generous  <EOR> Being friend's manager comped brunch four THANKS CEASARS! tried   A LOT  1 fried chicken waffles alright impressed 2 Chocolate cinnamon french toast pretty yummy tasted even better frozen hot chocolate drizzled top  3 Frozen hot chocolate choc  smoothie 4 red velvet cake bake fresh daily kinda dry  tasted better something drizzled top 5 onion rings normal 6 4 mimosas pretty good 7 some salad impressed 8 some appetizer chicken salad pretty good 9 cookie sandwiches cookie dough ice cream middle decent  I THINK  all had   Total bill $180 ice cream sandwiches

Started C but he definitely gets service  Told some cool karaoke places check Vegas   I only tried some carrot cake Irish coffee but both really good good time thanks part bartender  <EOR> Way overrated    great service food mediocre best! <EOR> If only place find Las Vegas dessert then all means it    I'm tourist but if I'd avoid place over priced over hyped over indulged place is    I just aforementioned over hyped frozen hot chocolate  everyone failed far mention frozen anything  richly watered down chocolate malt  doesn't qualify malt because would body that  cold hot chocolate    I asked waitress where FROZEN hot chocolate she looked alien said 'do know frozen is?' refrained sarcasm told well aware term 'frozen' having lived NYC years  She said wouldn't able eat if frozen  held myself back barely explaining ice cream's properties  Suffice say dessert lot money lot nothing    My guests also carrot cake which divine but still carrot cake worth $11 price tag  also very strange 'Forbidden Broadway Sundae ' demystify you chocolate ice cream LOT whipped cream small slice dark chocolate cake  $11  You're welcome hope just saved money would spent that  Buy drink when meet promise your money's worth which more say place    When lived NYC always tried tell friends stay away touristy areas MADE rip money your hands paltry return  give all Vegas tourists same advice  much better places indulge your sweet tooth scam  <EOR> We Serendipity3 July 3 Just dessert! realizing Caesars 50th anniversary fireworks celebration same night  Serendipity packed inside standing room only!

Loud groups talking all around but  vegas you  sliders mouth watering also!! FYI <EOR> Was excited dine because missed opportunity visit NY spot  Arrived 9 30 pm asked patio table which waited 15 min for  Noticed many open tables numerous servers working patio       seated waited almost 15 minutes greeted acknowledged noticed two tables sat already drinks order being taken   When server arrived first words spoken ready order? Huh? said myself confused look friend's face she expressed  friend ordered Cotton Candy Martini reply  gonna very sweet drink impression he really didn't want serve drink but she said yes she would drink noticed reluctant expression face  When receiving drinks could tell presentation drink wasn't high list   While he shook drink some sprayed he did poor pour over cotton candy   Cut food very good Chicken Lettuce Wraps Crab Cake Sandwich  wraps very moist flavorful crab cake very little filler much crab 5 stars food  drink  But back service while dining he doing side work refilling salt pepper shakers without excusing himself he reached over us  even though quite down dining he tried clear plates twice! Wanted order dessert but why bother he railing gazing Strip  kinda sorry left 10% tip should left 5%  <EOR> After years passing place decided stop some relief Vegas dry heat    atmosphere pretty frou frou having 3 boys probably why never tried before but seated pretty quickly server nice efficient   all ordered burgers all surprisingly good fries well just fries  Presentation flavor portions great   course finish meal off famous frozen hot chocolate which everything Serendipity   Glad gave try  <EOR> The best frozen hot choclate which im sure already know should divide into more lines just giant wrapping around place bar should lot bigger  None less food great drinks strong  Gotta love it <EOR> We made biggest mistake trying enjoy Serendipity's decadent dessert offerings outside inside restaurant because based pictures wish inside!!!  The menu Serendipity 3 different Serendipity located Upper East Side NYC   quite disappointed w dessert selections here   ordered Deep Fried Oreo's Ice Cream served Hawaiian shaved ice cup $10 would expect quantity goods more batter used Oreo's disappointing   cornflakes did work me   I now wonder if menu inside different outside   Blah  <EOR> Date Time Thursday January 28 2014 @ 10am Friday March 29 2014 @ 1 30pm Location Caesars Palace Mezzanine Level Dining Companions Husband's Cousin Jackie Son Mommy Husband Scene Groups Graphic Grey Sweatshirts Leggings Uggs Decor Fun Whimsical   Striped Wall Paper Colorful Tables Service Efficient Imbibe Frozen Hot Chocolate Devour Waffles Omelettes Spaghetti+Meatballs Corn Dog Apple Pie Mediocre Burgers Total $86 $68 <EOR> I'll short simple    terrible service  food worth price  much better options lunch brunch  frozen hot chocolate tasty however  <EOR> Stopped huge dinner Saturday night  None hungry all but all wanted try famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate just decided split one  5 ordered large $14!!  We ordered window back didn't even see inside looked no line 9 30 PM  large drink ready 5 minutes   wow! freakin huge 4 inches whipped cream top!  All 5 sip agreed awesome nice rich chocolate thick creamy definitely chocolate lover's dream come true  Unfortunately since thick quite filling ended throwing over half away  should gotten small   When Vegas come again split small somebody cheaper actually finish it! <EOR> After coming some friends because all good things heard NY would advise avoid place    I originally would rated Serendipity 3 maybe two three stars more because ambience its cutesy decor service pretty good but everything ate VERY subpar overpriced  Why star then? Well    After paid $36 tips included $14 drink lame ass $16 sandwich home spent rest night doubled over extreme vastly unpleasant stomach pain  don't know which food item caused but talking stomach pain made want curl next toilet wish never visited Serendipity 3    We started off frozen hot chocolate friend Raspberry Truffle frozen hot choc + chambord + some other things me  frozen hot chocolate okay but much better Austin  Raspberry Truffle decent tasting HUGE but chocolate shavings such tasteless didn't add much drink  Also way sweet awhile didn't finish it   Next entrees  friend's salad looked mediocre  But $15 small ish BBQ chicken pizza Pizza Hut could made better? here's got   $16 Open Bries sandwich slice bread mound sliced turkey very much packaged kind gets local supermarket few slices apple some mayo cranberries topped few slices brie? Yeah sandwich kind huge mention ridiculously hard eat but  side came excellently seasoned waffle fries far tastier main dish  concoction would better fresh turkey   mention more deserving $16 price tag   Don't come here   worth price potential wrath hell instilled your stomach  <EOR> I cookie sundae just sundae nothing special  Kids spaghetti which cold footling hotdog  Nothing special just big tourist trap  Hostess said couldn't stand near heater outside she rude B  Slow service never refilled coffee which cold  hated decor    yuck! <EOR> I totally intrigued first time heard frozen hot chocolate  frozen hot?! Well   trying first hand conclude total waste $12 for just cup size ! simply thick powdery super sweet cold chocolate drink! rather glass chocolate milk I later found other place called sugar factory also frozen hot chocolate menu just $6 7  If any friends insist trying future would take them place instead  wonder big diff be  <EOR> The food decent      but expensive   BUT WAITRESS SUCKED  THE END! <EOR> Overhyped Overpriced  don't usually complain places but waited 60 mins table because wife wanted Frozen Hot Chocolate fix  NYC very good   This place tries take advantage hype built around original restaurant  food anything special  portions huge but pay it   service subpar slow very friendly staff   We back save Serendipity cravings when back NYC sometime future  <EOR> Didn't really try any food just desserts  place good desserts but lot definitely hyped up  guess things need try Frozen Hot Chocolate but really special  basically hot chocolate powder milk blended ice  mostly enjoyed deep fried Oreos which pretty awesome  Having twice most likely return  Max Brenner's inside Forum Shops way better  <EOR> If weren't movie Serendipity would never walked into place   but watched it   thus try Frozen Hot Chocolate!  I Frozen Hot Chocolate $8 50  It came large goblet unhealthy but delightfully large dallop fresh whipped cream  YUM! drank fast brain freeeeeze  Worth because where else FROZEN hot chocolate? woulda thunk it?

Tip if hostess tells ridiculously long wait time table ask sit bar for smaller parties outdoor table although cold even heat lamps   Service time took forever again  Come on   an order soup cheeseburger   how basic get? really shouldn't take over half hour   Save yourself 2+ hours $50+   Don't sucked into hype! place popular only because cutesy name still riding coat tail fame 9 year old movie   sad! <EOR> Horrible service! table waited 15 min before anyone even showed table   and two deserts wanted   freaking lame  <EOR> The portions food HUGE!

Ok first all why should hard table 4pm when clearly empty tables abound? Points start drop     We told waiting time 30 which becomes hour thus decide try long outdoor takeout line which proved quicker  Now problem takeout line your orders become limited instead wanting try maybe 6 different things menu ended getting 3 kinds desserts  Yes Serendipity think all extra orders could gotten letting chill proper table     So wait worth it? Well if establishment going people wait long better worth it! spent over $50 3 different desserts wish gone Haagan Daz even McDonalds instead! only thing worth trying frozen hot chocolate  But then again really worth queueing for  yourself favour Jean Philippe's Bellagio Aria  Everything perfect worth every penny  <EOR> OK running TI Bellagio sure tickets O then looking restaurant did 2 1 2 hour wait ran back Serendipity 3  busy!

There's no even outside its freakin 105 degrees grumpy    Finally 30 minutes later seated  eye balled frozen hot chocolate but strawberry supreme more appealing me! really good   didn't pay much attention customer service because tired hot even pay attention care  just wanted cool down!   I would come back but hope don't ever wait long seated when isn't even many people sitting down  <EOR> Disappointed! all great reviews    thought would fabulous!? food came cold alright  Plus price pretty expensive! Even Vegas standards   Sorry guys    don't usually give bad reviews    but all good reviews thought should give opinion! Maybe experience fluke! positive Frozen Hot Chocolate    good! Made experience total loss! <EOR> We came brunch weekday relatively long wait 30 minutes? considering half tables inside empty members wait staff standing around   hostess sort rude acted she doing favor taking name     Once seated ordered famous frozen hot chocolate the 2 size which ok but nothing amazing    tasted bit thin milkshake made  pre made powdered hot chocolate mix which retrospect probably exactly was    ordered French toast berries bacon egg   French toast burnt but everything else good   berries fresh bacon almost strangely good breakfast potatoes little oily but good flavor egg fine   husband ordered blueberry pancakes which good   Both portions absolutely enormous wished shared dish rather getting two     The service adequate but good   waitress efficient but did engage interact all  <EOR> I've only come frozen hot chocolate good treat cool off but isn't great people be  wait order 30 minutes $13 bit pricey iced cocoa powder  <EOR> Nice variety dessert including ice cream sundaes but very slow service! Took forever receive check  Try fried oreo sundae next time check place out    This also restaurant sells sundae made gold $1 000! <EOR> This places most friends told hit up   Frozen hot chocolate best drink while Vegas    Nuff said  <EOR> Fun atmosphere great triple decker grill cheese scratch tomato soap  Fried twinkie sundae yummy definitely large enough 2 4 people share  Would love back soon  Only frustration difficult find main entrance Caesars side building street side  <EOR> Real score 3 5 Stars   Imagine surprise Serendipity3 would find its way west onto Strip  Thanks success awful movie same name remember having wait hours just into tourist famous NY original  yes did excited upon discovery Las Vegas location opened up  wanted relive Frozen Hot Chocolate experience again    yeah lame   But Serendipity unlike charming lil shop 'round corner found NY  made bigger accommodate people walking through Caesar's seems menu swelled myriad food options  also eccentrically   pink throughout  happens when take popular dessert shop Hollywood milk name turn into more accessible tourist friendly location read Instant $$ generator    Of course while famous Frozen Hot Chocolate which really just iced chilled chocolate smoothie share   $8 50 cheap but hey you're Vegas only less hand blackjack play  man good    108 degree summer weather good  even came back next day to go outside take out window  Sure some may find overhyped but shut up  If you're impressed there's Fat Tuesday around corner wasted     The prices food may tad high but portions big along it  foot long NY hotdog indeed foot long $11 comes waffle fries line condiments sprinkle top  steak sandwich $20 shared between 2  huge   that's she said   So pure convenience Serendipity easy destination check while you're Strip  won't true experience original but cares? Chances you'll drunk already care  Plus hated movie! <EOR> This review little weird only because really messed when came here  came hungry starving nursing terrible hangover  wait table half hour naturally ordered frozen hot chocolate window  Terrible idea!!! knew those would filling?! time text notifying table ready stuffed!!!!!! Nonetheless split hangover omelet  only able eat few bites but say those few bites yummy!!! advice? Real food first dessert end  <EOR> Breakfast disappointing due ordered breakfast   Another issue getting around 8 30 espresso machine yet available making coffee only bartender food service person providing service   bar all customers told most staff comes around 10pm   I fried benedict should keyed word 'fried' biscuit not english muffin gravy not hollandaise sause    Unless your into southern style biscuit gravy order item   chocolate coffee due being able order cappuccino type coffee drink no espresso !! <EOR> White chocolate frozen hot chocolate win! Ordered indulged dessert cup while walking around Strip  Perfect way indulge cool down cute moment sharing your dessert lover! Plenty tables outside sit down if don't want walk around  Topped whipped cream scooped out  Wish known going add because don't whipped cream  Pretty pricy you something similar cheaper Baskin Robbins! but good indulgence once while when you're Vegas! <EOR> What cute Name! Serendipity    sound getting dipped chocolate something   lol   just based cute name alone would totally checked place!   Unfortunately experience cute name    restaurant busy all but seated   took loooong time server come table  point where told husband if dont come next minutes let just go     and course she comes    I ordered hot chocolate since freezing big cup full ice cream chocolate fudge whip cream husband ordered martini  Ive husband long enough know he likes martini shaken hard bits ice glass   guess martini taste really good  for him  But same time   take martini right when done because ice melt drink all watery   no likes that   Yes kind picky   but everyone preferences when comes drinks     I saw bartender drink    rather heard him  shake hard sat counter waiting waiting once again server M I A   long decided drink myself bar counter  bartender think also knew while because he kept moving drink forward someone take it   when he nice enough apologize bring drink  Right server comes brings hot chocolate ice cream    Im sure if taste buds off then because bad service got   but everything just sweet    hot cholocate package add water  and ice cream ice cream     Not asking whole lot   just attentive your tables    expecially if aint busy! <EOR> Love hate relationship place  loooove food always fun people watch all tourists visiting but hate fact strip  usually park forum shops walk all way through mall casino towards strip here  Totally worth but such inconvenience  Oh always wait  bad but torture during summer when 120 degrees outside!  I recently came restaurant week  three course menu drink entree dessert lunch $20  chocolaccino hangover omelette frrrozen hot chocolate shot Oreo mousse cookie  way much food but all yummy  friends also mimosa each  overpriced! $14 tiny glass  Definitely mistake but oh well    Our waitress such awesome lady  She super stoked see locals kept thanking coming restaurant week  loved it! only reason didn't give all 5 stars because inconvenience  wish would another  touristy! <EOR> I can't speak location itself but desserts fantastic   waiting try Serendipity since saw movie 100th time   begged boyfriend take me   showed Saturday afternoon place packed   hour half wait = didn't want torture spoil trip decided just order outside location   ordered Frozen Hot Chocolate Regular Size sip immediately regretted getting larger size   Needless say drove back following day another try before ended trip  love Serendipity! <EOR> Just landed Vegas looking some breakfast decided hit Serendipity 3 group members' suggestions   ordered french toast log   whoa!  huge!  But actually quite light because bread brioche   going skip whipped cream but berries sweet fresh whipped cream well could eat everything!  Great breakfast selection! <EOR> Serendipity 3 just those restaurants you're told try once even if never watched movie  came Saturday morning despite having 35 minute wait called pretty quickly seated  service very friendly place rather spacious eat at  Oh views pretty decent but  all talk about  The food really pricy which kind expect strip  nothing special food although hangover omelette pretty delicious  Damn  some good stuff  ordered salad which alright  sundaes enormous but nothing drew since didn't any flavors cared for  There's lot sweets stuff but yeah no interest  Nothing special here  big portions really expensive prices but nothing special  <EOR> Go across street Hash House Go  food isnt anything cant dorm room microwave  wait 45 minutes which didnt surprise me  did surprise rude waiter was  never incident ever life waiter didnt want didnt want write four extra words onto order ticket forgot fill waters doesn't check all except first when only half food takes 20 minutes figure split 6 person check half  actually watched brow furrow when he tried subtracting even $40 $100  Aside just shoddy waiter backs literally touching backs people behind tables poorly laid out tables floors sticky hostess rude nearest restroom outside restaurant end garage tunnel <EOR> good food prices bad expected  menu outside does any prices bit cautious would cost  ended being bad  foot long dog  good really filling  no places dessert after   bad because sundaes look excellent  Decor interesting  honest chose place because next hotel  <EOR> Quickie Service whack  Frozen hot chocolate tastes slightly better version Wendy's Frosty perhaps because felt thousand degrees Vegas        Three friends decided stop try famous frozen hot chocolate late Sunday afternoon  scoped place saw more dozen empty tables  Sweet wait going nonexistent    NOT  wait turned 35 40 minutes  Why refuse seat people when plenty open tables beyond me!  asked snooty hostess why she said top hour seat everyone already list   that didn't even sense  If open tables shouldn't seat guests?? hostesses proceeded seat two other groups before span 20 minutes   really?!  When finally shown many open tables took quick glance menu chose sliders regular frozen hot chocolate two  closed menus waited waitress come around which probably seemed longer actually due heat  She unpleasantly took order then came 5 minutes later abruptly placed dishes table without saying word us  She must hate job      The sliders decent again frozen hot chocolate tasted frosty  definitely worth $12     If ever come back reservation only try other appetizers omelettes  <EOR> Meh   The +'s + Great outdoor sidewalk cafe plenty shade kill relentless heat + Great people watching those crossing Caesar's Palace + Great large groups but place crowded peak times  Consider reservations  + Plenty brunch choices which meal sat for chicken waffles steak strip sandwich omelettes french toast pancakes bigger your head etc  + French toast decent  Decadent huge portions   + Portions great shared  Think massive caloric portions Cheesecake Factory  Gross! Best shared downed alone  + Great home fries   The 's Portions gargantuan! Hello server served 12 girls  Did see all petite?? would better tip if just suggested portions huge  None finished meals all eat but come on! food portions ridiculous could shared  no did know portions huge because more none patrons Vegas!!!! asked wait nearly 45 minutes until another server could arrive because party large serve! called reservations advance told would no problem being seated 10am  your story straight  10 oz  sirloin steak sandwich $20  saw mostly French baguette rather steak  Frozen hot chocolate  just hot chocolate sat freezer  hot chocolate over ice  memorable  Pass  <EOR> Fun place vegas!! friends loved place  First time trying deep fried Oreos   word WOW! Lol drinks flavorful food amazing  wait little long but worth it  suggest making reservations prior  <EOR> I trying eat since first Vegas trip 2 years ago when turned 21  heard nothing but good things  finally able eat here  came breakfast around 11 30 Thursday no wait outdoor seating  Perfect! ordered breakfast quesadilla which wonderful  really came world famous frozen hot chocolate  usually fan chocolate but try this  Um died  delicious!!!! worth $10  service beyond  waiter nice helpful  All all great first experience  Definitely coming back all Vegas trips! <EOR> Great place brunch  couple hours kill checking hotel Caesar's Palace conveniently located right front main entrance lobby! sat bar great menu  steak eggs simply perfect  Also cappuccino Bellini which best Bellini had! Highly recommend! <EOR> I've 3 times all visits left unimpressed  First all famous frozen hot chocolate extremely overrated  There's many little bits ice every sip find enjoyable  When order don't give lid your cup walk around open drink quickly won't drip onto your hand  I'd say Starbucks frappaccino would just satisfying would cost less    If want sit down meal layout confusing  If enter side entrance strip there's no hostess greet you  exit through back side takeout window Caesar's put your name down table    I ordered hotdog really isn't much say it  wasn't awful but wasn't great  best part meal waffle cut fries sweet potato fries  Food overpriced but  expected considering location  should come once just experience but place won't getting repeat visits me  much better places strip  <EOR> Great location strip great desserts!   Frozen hot chocolate bomb! enjoyed wide selection menu very interesting try something new all time The service could better   long wait just desserts   <EOR> Sure overpriced  realize you're Las Vegas right?  On other hand portions huge everything tried pretty darn good   I highly recommend chicken nachos   Yes know hard screw nachos but practically licked plate   order plenty two share   Fries good too   Like rest Western World tried Frozen Hot Chocolate   basically milkshake looks sundae   decadent but honestly wouldn't say must order   Our service great decor playful fun   Overall solid experience but plenty restaurants LV sure would return unless starving close by  <EOR> I love place sister law while Vegas birthday  bit trouble finding didn't realize could off strip maybe another route?? way probably looked crazy coming Caesars edging around pond walking through foliage mud   So finally find joint no wait sat immediately  sister law some type sandwich can't remember  grilled cheese tomato soup   Now am fan tomato general don't ask why tomato soup but don't regret!! some best soup ever consumed spent past year half attempting duplicate but never able to!! serving size pretty big too   So lets real why place desserts  couldn't decide asked recommendation  Fried Oreo Sundae!!! good gluttoness  probably cracked half awhile just wasn't possible continue   This place great definitely return next time Vegas  <EOR> Love idea  Wish wasn't popularized here  Definitely worth heat though  Service quick  <EOR> Let start off review saying desert amazing!!!  Order desert!  banana split loved it!  I'll give place 3 stars wonderful desert   Service table quality bit average ours wobbly    food decent but little pricey   However must try desert!  Anything desert menu do  <EOR> Ate while staying Venetian while back    think all hype definitely better places try      We orders nachos just impressed  ordered sandwich grilled roasted veggies  okay but again nothing special  frozen hot chocolate just tastes chocolate milk  wasn't really any special quality taste    Service okay but guess understaffed  TONs open tables maybe more half empty   But still wait seated  don't know works     So yea  wonder if NY locations better? hope so!   Come try if want but many other great places try off strip   <EOR> FRIED CHICKEN  FRIED CHICKEN  FRIED CHICKEN   Before coming Serendipity didn't even imagine would menu  only mind frozen hot chocolate  But doubt fried chicken OFF CHARTS   When arriving may bit confusing navigate but tucked away outside Ceasar's Palace  to go window separate menu if keep walking past window you'll see entrance restaurant    I came Tuesday night around 8pm fifteen minute wait 2 people  give them your phone number they'll text when table ready  give five minutes time send text easily roam around courtyard outside come back time   The portions HUGE overstatement  ordered fried chicken share which came mashed potatoes gravy  could done without gravy because mashed potatoes fried chicken alone best combination  AH MA ZING  something simple fried chicken such large impression surprising  Needless say definitely come back next time Vegas just this   Now dessert Frozen Hot Chocolate phenomenal definitely lives hype! Order share won't finish all unless only thing order then it! They close pretty early restaurant Vegas around 10 pm come early if want dine in! Otherwise to go window outside open later  <EOR> Note biased because love movie Serendipity restaurant would really mess order give them anything under 3 stars   Service server really cool really took care us   She put annoying jokes all smiles   She brought food quickly checked back frequently   Food A friend hang over omelet huge   probably enough food feed starving family   The crab artichoke dip done quite well large pieces crab meat   dish well plated came looking million bucks   Infamous frrrozen hot chocolate  delicious just good remembered vising NY store few years back   Pizza served wooden paddle looked ginormous when arrived   did poor job slicing pizza into manageable pieces     Price Things seem bit overprice when view them menu   $15 omelet? However when see portions arrive soon realize actually getting your money's worth   Overall I really enjoyed time here   sure if good company good service good food all above   probably won't eat full meal next time im town but return desserts  <EOR> It's nice spacious place food good  tried ABC burger which delicious came pickle side banana pepper some fries  U choose sweet potatoe fries regular fries even coleslaw  add extras stuff your burger if such as bacon extra cheese etc    <EOR> The service worst seen  afternoon  came inside girl no line barely anyone eating  no sign said wait seated nobody counter  sat selfs then old Caucasian waitresses walked said wait seated very rudely  She didn't even greet us  She also said section closed off  also no signs said area closed actually sitting next few other groups people seated  don't see section could closed off if multiple tables filled around nothing saying otherwise  counter Caucasian hostess black hair walks male co worker does starts talking mean while 3 other groups waiting line now front  She talks few minutes stuff isn't even work related  5 minutes into interrupt them since paying attention growing line  noticed both them glanced continued talk  appears very rude  think don't young mixed couples way dressed something  Its prep any tables because all all already clean waiting people use them  Then sat furthest back everyone which appeared very racial opinion  think only minorities  would back place  food decent nothing amazing  prices high vs quality food  expect better service strip Caesars  If could wouldn't even give them star service alone  Oh ya allot people worked standing around too  need train workers better appear lazy unmotivated  whole time never even greeted  <EOR> This place overpriced over rated ice cream n frozen hot chocolate below average bad service horrible attitude employees would never recommend anyone there <EOR> Good service wide selection tasty food  mean wide selection fortunate enough come 1055a which just cusp breakfast regular menu time lot choices using both menus  crab cake sandwich portobello burger full Monty  Good food  back  Discounts total rewards members also  <EOR> What arriving Vegas four year exile? Serendipity 3!   Hearing raves viewing countless photos frozen hot insert your flavor just see hype all about  very hot day lines very short  already quest frozen hot beverages but wanted see if sample anything else  gazing big menu couple minutes mind already made before looked menu   Since city sin ended ordering two frozen hot drinks  frozen hot chocolate peanut butter frozen hot chocolate  Both drinks both smooth creamy especially peanut butter one  miniature ice chunks drinks gave drink iced coffee feeling  drinks both topped whipped cream but identifying flavors cup  frozen hot chocolate topped chocolate chips  peanut butter frozen hot chocolate peanut butter bottom cup   I would say drinks pretty pricey but hey Vegas! least better investment slots tables   another story  <EOR> I staying Caesar's few days naturally try Serendipity while property because convenience   wait brunch time meal during week aware most likely wait   All food really good but did wait quite long time order well food   if you're looking quick meal would recommend but if plenty time would definitely choose Serendipity 3!  Banana milkshake also incredible  <EOR> This place incredible! sure reservations first though  beware food enough feed four people  must try frozen hot chocolate  die for!!!! <EOR> The most rude service ever had  Now food amazing but service horrible  First host rude tight  She made husband wait hour table when friends gotten table already extra chairs could sat but she said no idea  heard amazing comments food decided stay  husband other hand very upset starving  Just ruined whole morning us  BTW name host Gretel  She shouldn't working if she doesn't job customer service  <EOR> Hype? YES    Overrated? Sure  come back? NO WAY!  From time put names list seated time ordered food   it took 1 1 2 hours  seated 30 minutes took food 1 hour table    Everything super expensive! ordered off appetizer menu dessert  All all food + water bill came $70 00 tip included    We crab artichoke dip just okay nothing special then ordered chicken strips gross! over breaded tiny chicken inside left chewy tendons chicken also kobe beef sliders BURNED! BURNED! BURNED! don't mean nice flavorful char outside talkin CHAR COAL!     Lastly dessert Red Velvet sundae basically red velvet cake chocolate ice cream   Let's just say cake dry chocolate ice cream nothing special heap whipped cream hurt teeth  texture mushy squishy  should added some nuts chocolate chips something    Overall say but NEVER going back! <EOR> You read other 2500 reviews take highlights location fun casual  relatively speaking prices terrible casual fare  big portions  frozen hot chocolate nice but worth premium   I sampled chicken strips buffalo style   bad fried goopy deliciousness   Cole slaw ok   Dining back patio quiet nice warm night  <EOR> Had order fries peanut butter frozen hot chocolate two  fries over salted  Decent but nowhere near worth $6  chocolate tasted syrup bottom regular hot chocolate very potent but mixed nicely peanut butter even better when toned down mixing whipped cream  Overall decent  Extremely casual atmosphere inside  <EOR> The portions HUGE! Came breakfast omelets ginormous! very filling tasty well! might just share next time   The Frozen Hot Chocolate good well but pretty overpriced   I believe coupon booklet gave when checked Planet Hollywood but didnt see until left  <EOR> I recommend making reservation Opentable having full meal restaurant instead walk bar  If TotalRewards membership through Caesar's Palace family only rewards but also discounts! Only dollar two plate cheaper but when burgers $17 $18 worth it! don't skimp portions if aren't starved would maybe share entree  burgers die for! husband brie he very impressed  drinks crazy expensive $14 each? Nuts but pitcher beer only $17 if trying save money slots route  location Serendipity perfect if seeing Absinthe which mere steps outside restaurant worked us  Save room dessert tried two different ones during trip preferred Sundae's over frozen hot chocolate which really glorified $11 milkshake   the sundae however amazing! Broadway said 'chocolate cake' didn't realize came literal piece chocolate cake top Sundae! No joke! could barely eat half  great server attentive friendly  visiting Serendipity again next time town sure! <EOR> The meals huge really your money's worth  never wrong all day breakfast honestly desserts world size taste  staff really nice accommodating  10 10 would recommend <EOR> Lets start ambiance   would imagine dining outdoor patio weather continues improve would your dining experience Serendipity much more enjoyable  Alas dining experience s indoors    The restaurant centrally located infamous LVBLVD central mean central passing tourists those made special trip just dine fine establishment  must park Cesar's Palace pack canteen hike your dining destination  WEAR COMFY SHOES!   Once arrive and find front door side door or?? dumped into middle dining commons think it  reminds lunch room cafeteria minus buffet style mean lunch ladies    OK place isn't all bad promise  staff generally friendly food minute      It's minute  If past wacky setup and fact walk outside around building through deserted hallway use restroom your pick enormous eats joint's menu!   THE NACHOS OUTSTANDING! did venture away nacho comfort zone ordered BBQ Chicken pizza but   stick CPK little diddy  pizza ALL crust little cheese toppings  nuff said    Desert  If looking live edge want partake desert dinner evening would your place! DELICIOUS FATTENING FANTASTIC!!!   So give place 3 stars mainly bangin nachos decent staff but loses last two stars layout location well everything except food drinks staff haha! <EOR> I heard people rave rave Serendipity Frozen Hot Chocolate try myself  wanted sit inside but wait long choice order Togo window sit outside bar  opt sitting bar nice because strip back warm day out    First ordered hot chocolate appetizer pizza Sunday share  Sad say hot chocolate just OK  Maybe people over hyped but chocolate girl felt if could just made home tasted better  say Sunday really really good all vanilla ice cream chocolate fudge    Overall place OK but nothing crazy for  <EOR> I can't recommend Serendipity 3 anything but going just say did   service TERRIBLE took probably hour half food and between breakfast lunch crowds meals sent back   prices astronomical which sure because name because quality   egg white omelette good enough $14 sorry   mother daughter duo ordered shrimp fritatta $18 plate small egg white omelette large shrimp cut two asparagus spear covered huge helping arugula lettuce   ended sending back because well shrimp spear asparagus   When asked order something else because wasn't thought received snotty response server   Let's just say 9% gratuity 4% more he should received   best item group received kid's fruit bowl 3 year old group  <EOR> It's ok  lot more spacious NYC   just expensive lot desert food  might well your money's worth inside forum shops max brenners <EOR> Great restaurant! pricey but worth every penny  Amazing deserts also! Service beyond friendly  Felt really casual rather high end which great  Defiantly going back <EOR> The original New York better due its mystique aura generated movie   vegas does factor seems place   Again  Awesome desert place  Frozen chocolate da bomb   bachelorette hot dog once  Humongous but expensive  <EOR> Late show hungry bear where eat? Nearby S3 stopped in  Hostess nice oh it'll take 30 min seated! she said  looked around pointed manager bunch seats open outside  He immediately seated great waiter apologized Hostess's comment  told waiter running late show he made sure food fast  simple American fare burgers fries milk shakes  really good!  Loved apology quick snap serve us  Plus sitting outside watching interesting Vegas traffic people cars while ate show itself!  Definitely recommend back  <EOR> Great variety food service nice friendly love Frozen Hot Chocolate  <EOR> Tourist trap   Come Frozen Hot Chocolate only if you're into whole touristy thing otherwise don't consider coming   $11 things?  Sure looks pretty but small portion just over mounded whipped cream   Dine probably split friend two but when see little $11   Overpriced   better off geting real food which mediocre best   Skip  <EOR> I think didn't experience should if NYC  never S3 NYC but imagine its less Disneyland ish long lines expensive drinks taste bad    Next time NYC try real deal  <EOR> Good service starts great evening any restaurant exactly you'll first experience Serendipity 3 beside Caesar's Palace  say beside Caesar's Palace because same property resort but located right strip  service always friendly warm   I met several servers each time gone back if they're working remember me  amazing many thousands people through weekly  If manager she'll come around say hi sure meal drinks you're expecting  temperature food always hot  difficult large kitchens any restaurant but seem pull off   I brought many sets friends recommended people social services all them excellent time  know may ask  send tweets Facebook status wall postings experiences  took parents during trips visit both thoroughly enjoyed lunch asked back   I many desserts including Golden Opulence Sundae which presented without prior knowledge when hit certain follower count Twitter  Sharing 20+ other people party good time  brought Baccarat Crystal bowl golden spoon via white gloved private butler  almonds covered golf leaf giant chocolate pieces all over it  People ask if taste Sundae worth price  First keep golden spoon crystal bowl half price dessert just those two items  Secondly shouldn't dessert yourself  could end spending several thousand dollars bottle service club more fun  taste unlike anything ever Sundae  some exotic ingredients sundae yet taste another deluxe sundae  Some food received restaurant comped  no way any staff asked review restaurant  did keep bowl spoon those returned restaurant  <EOR> The original frozen hot chocolate great! Defiantly use to go window instead waiting 30 min table because pretty much same menu available unless really care sit down experience   unfortunately didn't every flavor version frozen hot chocolate wasn't available when  why give 4 instead 5 stars  <EOR> This place great!!! construction going right now but still wonderful breakfast  vanilla latte best ever had  taste friends frozen hot chocolate amazing!!! cute atmosphere too  Can't wait back  <EOR> BBQ chicken pizza fried Oreo sundae wonderful but gigantic <EOR> I love place unfortunately UFO January 2017 closed remodel call before show up  <EOR> I first heard New York Serendipity 3 Food Network then again Colbert Report  thing place media famous Golden Opulence Sundae   most expensive dessert $1 000!   When Vegas summer saw Serendipity 3 knew wanted try out! around lunch time weren't crowded  boyfriend only waited 10 minutes  decor very retro 50's  colorfulness restaurant forget Vegas  gives young happy retro ambiance    I recently came back Vegas February  Now place very crowded during breakfast   suggest coming 2 00PM because  larger selection lunch  now to go line outside restaurant but menu very limited  suggest reservations if want eat now  boyfriend sat bar time  bartender nice us  ordered Frozen Hot Chocolate  since VEGAS asked if he could alcoholic one  He mixed Vanilla Kahlua Bailey's  OMG!! GOOD!   The Frozen Hot Chocolate definitely MUST HAVE! I also love WAFFLE FRIES! addicting  ordered TWO orders waffle fries  <EOR> SERVICE good DECOR gorgeous!  reason why place only 3 stars? did add hype  First movie then everyone going bat shit crazy frozen hot chocolate  then reviews place magazines tv friends OPRAH  try it    the prices ridiculous  know portions ginormous but wow   seems you're paying more atmosphere food    I wasn't hungry did feel paying $15 hamburger wanted try frozen hot chocolate sweet potato fries   FRIES GOOOOOD can't wrong sweet potato fries   just cant  frozen hot chocolate  ask FREAKING BIG DEAL THIS? its chocolate slush  creamy thick milk shake but lighter almost frozen chocolate milk    sigh* expected much more  expected something name  invented something cold frothy icy outside  when drank would warm something inside  well  imagined  nonetheless disappointed    i highly doubt place again although decor would probably only thing bring back  <EOR> Every time Serendipity always extremely packed always opt to go option  food mediocre wouldn't recommend place your first choice lunch    frozen hot chocolate pretty decent but definitely does compare New York store   If never frozen hot chocolate definitely try out!  But don't stay anything else   decor very trendy cute but beware overpriced menu! <EOR> Food tasted bland bill came 112 56     WTF? customer services far worst     tip them 10 bucks left  <EOR> Food delicious portions huge! Awesome value Las Vegas strip! bar offers quick seating fun fast bartenders creative cocktail menu  Chicken Satay Lettuce Wraps phenomenal! <EOR> Food terrible  chicken wraps almost inedible  Crab artichoke dip missing ingredient CRAB! Ordered tex mex chicken salad took two bites couldn't eat any more  Ordered decaf coffee think yesterday  Don't waste your money   unless going dessert  looked amazing  <EOR> I hate waiting heat almost hour sit down rude ass waiter  Please  calm your nerves   you work dessert place   eat some sugar   Please don't ask if saw hostess before sat down because only ordered dessert  No duh? She sat down did she not? After few snotty remarks join other girlfriends sitting another table  waitress really sweet made some comment nice she compared waiter  Low behold when back table waiter replaced someone much more pleasant!

You've sundae while you're too  Three stars good food  But service could lot quicker friendlier  food wasn't worth price either  <EOR> I'd give 0 stars but burger pretty good  start off least half diners come wrong door  hostess check table confusing seemingly even employees  mention outside diners food right past everyone standing waiting table  if sit outside know might sneezed your food  I didn't really but possibility long wait takin table tell waitress groupon ready treated garbage slowly! When finally burgers being brought water asked we'd something drink asked if wanted frozen hot chocolate then  Since waited over 20 minutes burgers thought better answer yes  brought two minutes  Great  Now melting frozen dessert while trying inhale burger    This place desperately needs revamp its check process employees treat diners coupon! never eat again! <EOR> the restaurant poorly managed Las Vegas standards see empty tables but still wait 45+ min   If just use walk drive through  <EOR> The portions VERY large no customizing   lucky 7 which 2 bigger your head pancakes 2 large sausage links 3 eggs potatoes   Needless say cud finish   Loved pancakes eggs    But left all other   Would try again different meal  <EOR> Not actually bad but won't back  30 minute wait completely different bar best part whole experience   Had 35 minute wait but use nowait com text message when your table ready let wander bar Central lobby Caesar's Palace escape heat  best part   The hostess wasn't rude but really friendly all servers actually looked mad  ordered nachos famous Frozen Hot Chocolate  whole reason came because we're fans that  fine but really much better making home packets  nachos very average except WAAAAYYYY much salt  <EOR> Expensive but almost worth portions large food tasty  dive into frozen hot chocolate hope tip scales favor full hearty recommendation  <EOR> I bought loved frozen hot chocolate mix Serendipity sells Williams Sonoma really wanted restaurant but sadly found just so so  decor really cute but menu really lacking  think paid $14 BLT club fries  did enjoy sweet potato fries quite bit but BLT nothing special    To fair think ordered wrong  think place enjoy special dessert lunch try next time Vegas  Until then we're sticking 2 stars  <EOR> Was lucky enough eat free bc vouchers timeshare day  Way treat myself rotten afternoon  However when Vegas should try once! I'd totally paid meal pocket   Tried nachos amazing chicken strips  amaretto frozen hot chocolate hub regular frozen hot chocolate  Amazing! Regretted didn't try them few months later NYC  <EOR> I originally wanted frozen hot chocolate which good reviews  However since ended dinner time did work out  Monday night wasn't crowded open tables but wanted booth wait 10 min  texted when table ready but only held 5 min don't plan going far  felt meals way over priced quality  some pasta which could eat all son pizza which pretty big  If something easily share meal  husband sandwich fries normal proportions  full left no room dessert  just dessert next time see if 4 5 stars  <EOR> Overrated! Underwhelming  Yawn   Only because friend's bf recommended it  <EOR> nachos awesome  well bagel breakfast sandwiches  bit overpriced but expected any restaurant strip  Desserts course insane over top    KAREN bomb  far best waitress <EOR> I am done ordering food stick hot chocolate  eaten dozen times last few years never good service  orders always least error service SLOOOOOOOW painfully slow food just isn't amazing  its tourist place but still least could come right temperature   This most recent trip sat 20 minutes before finally asked server if he could find server was  Then he never came back asked another one  He asked around said apparently no he would happy help me  heck??   So frozen hot chocolate when some serious time spare bring board game novel read  <EOR> OK frozen hot chocolate over rated    don't it     desserts mediocre me    But 5 stars food!   goodness delicious    don't remember ordered but would definitely mind coming back again just frozen hot chocolate   But if order frozen hot chocolate would take order in    more quantity think cheaper when dine it  <EOR> Came friend dinner course frozen hot chocolate  never wrong frozen hot chocolate but sure did wrong nachos  definitely worth money spent  If looking dinner somewhere else come dessert! <EOR> Besides die Frozen Hot Chocolate which cannot anywhere else other food choices well done good quality ingredients   Generous portions   Lively environment   Service little slow last time but if hurry no problem   only negative cannot drive easily   walking strip staying Caesar's convenient  <EOR> The Frrrozen Hot Chocolates alone four stars  ordered chocolate peanut butter version share husband divine  sure peanut butter sauce but wanted lick plate bowl clean! cousin original which guess she never deviates from  She took taste peanut butter version though quickly feel love  could not? Chocolatey peanut buttery goodness covered whipped cream? Yes please!   We actually breakfast last day town  busy but steadily more sat there  waitress friendly but distracted she might many tables worry about    I wasn't particularly hungry but knew portion sizes large  Knowing well we'd car five hours decided order Fresh Bread Basket hopes whatever wasn't consumed table could available munching during road trip home  husband ordered oatmeal coffee cousin Benedict    I admit being more little disappointed bead basket  items biscuit croissant muffin cinnamon roll anything but fresh  weren't even warm  biscuit which cousin raving it base Benedict hard crumbly ice box cold  Crumbly handle  Cold hard much  wash every bite down sip water  croissant best thing basket also smallest last thing ate there  muffin half biscuit cinnamon roll came trip  muffin only thing consumed later date my breakfast following morning   croissant muffin definitely best things plate    My husband enjoyed oatmeal but thought overpriced he got  mean oatmeal all even apple crisp garnish can't fancy enough justify cost    My cousin meanwhile loved Benedict  guess counts something    I'd definitely want back if just chocolate alone  may want give food another shot but wouldn't first dining choice when Vegas  <EOR> Um why does place fairly low rating?

I Serendipity twice trip says something  initial visit meet fellow Yelper Michael U  ordered strawberry balsamic waffle hot chocolate french toast  Then complete meal carrot cake!   Of three favorite strawberry balsamic waffle  waffles fresh tender some good malt flavor love  balsamic syrup prefect compliment fresh berries cream  required no additional syrup which should tell REALLY good because usually drown everything syrup breakfast   The hot chocolate french toast potential but bread cut thick custard unable penetrate entire slice bread leaving very dry piece stale hot chocolate bread  ideal however 1 3 dish very good   The carrot cake pretty standard book  Very dense lots gooey cream cheese icing served cold sundae style vanilla ice cream whipped cream  solid carrot cake!  My next visit two mornings later boyfriend missed breakfast Michael U  due previous night's outing  He ordered huevos rancheros sinners saints french toast  huevos rancheros Napolian stack style just OK  little greasy chorizo basic green sauce  Saints sinner french toast nothing I'd imagined good! side savory over easy egg bacon other side sweet berries whipped cream served supper crispy 'breakfast potatoes'  enjoyed both sides super moist buttery french toast syrup ate much could leaving untopped middle birds figuratively    Service both times efficient but memorable  staff doesn't seem overly passionate service  However sufficed both times didn't wait seat only wait refills occasion during each sitting  worse service sure    Prices par other restaurants area  Think resort pricing    I'd rank Serendipity Hash House very good breakfast strip but even close ranking near Griddle Cafe LA Skillet RUF Cbus   <EOR> Sucked need experience frozen hot chocolate ended eating because failed plan ahead reservations anywhere else  food your typical diner fare which pretty tasty  onion rings really good actually  frozen hot chocolate? guess good could expect  HUGE!

Augh! #fatbill #badservice <EOR> It's more novelty coming especially if want Frozen Hot Chocolate  friend split FHC $15  far better desserts buy strip even 5 star restaurants price less  Something consider   To sum drink iced chocolatey drink  pretty decent although if you're really into there's exact knock off recipe listed food network  Google it  You're welcome    The whipped cream top delicious almost favorite part drink  1 1 ratio iced chocolate drink cream  Before dove friend mentioned she should asked them no whipped cream  Excuse me? you?   The chocolate chips topped off drink good all  worst ever tried but rest drink made it    All all tried done no interest ever getting again  <EOR> After reading all reviews place seeing frozen hot chocolate mentioned most decided stop Serendipity since just eaten Max Brenner Ceasars go  10 00 frozen HC 5 00 tiny bottle evian 15 00 later sitting outside table ready excited try it  verdict? simply meh  did kinda taste chocolate milkshake but more chocolaty rich flavor  worth 10 00? Absolutely not  only through quarter before tired said F threw away   So few weeks later talking friend asked recent trip Vegas  Told tried frozen hot chocolate Serendipity  She all excited told she tried but Dunkin Doughnuts  both agreed good but really rich  Then said didn't feel worth 10 00  think she felt bad telling she only paid    this    2 00 hers! Trying feel better she insisted mine probably better which replied Nope am pretty sure same  Haha even though tried Dunkin Doughnuts would say try theirs if really feel must try frozen hot chocolate aka The more chocolaty milkshake  No milkshake ever worth 10 00!!! just wish come conclusion before basically giving money away  Well ya live ya learn Note self When Dunkin Doughnuts try Frozen Hot Chocolate determine if good good better then Serendipities version  Then post review Yelp others misfortune spending much if Dunkins good better   Keep eye profile if interested results  feeling study conducted within next few weeks jonsing chocolaty fix lately O <EOR> Okay  Prepare wait! food very good especially grilled cheese! However waited long even cancelled sundaes! Service bad weren't even busy no apologies long wait either  Resist urge indulge unless ice cream only! <EOR> We arrived told party 8 going hour wait  course  Friday night  What's really cool hostess ask cell phone number she texted msg tell keep eye when she text tell seats ready  More places need implement function! Instead waiting hour front restaurants dummies able walk around sit down comfortably chat another area    I Frrrozen Hot Choco  Why over $10? really different any other blended mocha had    fact think Coffee Bean's actually richer    only thing Frrozen Hot Choco going delicious whipped cream    told myself would finish    but ended finishing anyways   It lot more sense just to go window grab go  But honestly why even bother? just really fancy place date overpriced food justifiable  <EOR> I truly hate walking all way through strip  Same parking strip but original treat worth it  Just imagine waiting line 30+ minutes during weekend  Then walking away treat your hand everyone else line stares you  directly but your hand maybe both your hands    could even let your significant other hold feel better themselves stroll along strip dozens individuals staring awe   The best thing place frozen hot chocolate  Mother God amazing treat!!! <EOR> Over years stopped going inside  food good but mind blowing yet seemed overpriced even comparison other Strip options  BUT outdoor to go window totally worth it  Frrrozen Hot Chocolate definitely something try least once okay most visits also donuts big your face only $5  If you're looking economical lunch portions window MASSIVE  Nachos? You'll entire party bowl full 'em  Hot dog? foot long comes fries perfect two  plain black coffee $4  but  still cheaper grande black coffee Starbucks Strip  All all great spot grab bite sit outside patio take sights  <EOR> Frozen hot chocolate die all ever fries ranch sauce course frozen hot chocolate  fries perfectly crispy hot chocolate taste same every single time  cream top best cream life  Next time your Vegas give them try don't even Windows outside  <EOR> Oooh lala place dreamy especially strawberry dessert   it strawberry ice cream slice cheesecake top covered strawberry sauce whip cream  party mouth!

The place crazy busy when arrived but luckily spotted 'takeout' window side   No biggie since only wanted frozen hot chocolate anyway   Looking menu while waiting line shocked price frozen hot chocolate   Most flavors $11   Flavors 'peanut butter mint vanilla'   No hint fancy chocolate Lindt Ghirardelli flakes might price worth it   bought anyway mochachino flavor wanted peanut butter but $12 97 later $1 plastic glass tap water stood window waited frozen hot chocolate   fast give them but passed window into hand basically grande frappucino three times price   sure others raving because nothing glass could come close being worth $11 price tag drink     As friend wondered exactly why many people Serendipity could only guess 1 they'd never before 2 couldn't remember having first time   Apparently if actually sit down restaurant frozen hot chocolate much larger which might made feel tiny bit better   However way melted milkshake load whipped cream frozen hot chocolate worth your time money   somewhere else   plenty gelato places Vegas where your ice cream fix if desire 1 3 price  <EOR> We came Serendipity some hangover relief final epic meal before leaving Vegas  day still bit puzzled why place raved about     On typical summer Sunday your wait pretty long large group  restaurant itself fairly small Vegas standards prepared  seated outside patio because  only place could accommodate group 12  Even though shade HOT  Blazing Vegas hot  some odd reason mist fans don't come until noon left sitting hour without any relief but water  really hard turn off timers guys     The meal itself nothing special  ordered Fried Chicken Waffles which came 2 drumsticks 2 thighs bacon waffle potatoes honey mustard ketchup  chicken heavily breaded pretty dried flavorless  only thing added taste honey mustard  bacon waffles alright initially but pretty unbearable 1 4 waffle  entire dish just bland flavorless  understand they're trying unique bacon waffles but definitely worth $22    For finale all famed highly spoken frozen hot chocolate  biggest disappointment day  $11 you're basically paying huge watered down chocolate milk some whipped cream top   exactly tastes  experienced no wow factor seriously don't see all hype about  cools down but other great  <EOR> Overrated  ahead try frozen hot chocolate just say you've tried it  Other that   no big woop  <EOR> I love going serendipity frozen hot chocolate friends birthday just 3 wait 30 mins seated little much but waitress nice forgot all wait enjoyed frozen chocolate dessert  <EOR> Finally living 5 years New York never making serendipitys try Las Vegas! Delicious! famed frrrozen hot chocolate scrumptious  Basically milkshake but yummy  Didnt $11 but its Vegas do? Still would recommend everyone! <EOR> We lunch wait until noon check Caesars  If only would given free Frozen Hot Chocolate coupon before lunch   My advice split Hangover omelette ensure room split dessert swear use two dozen eggs thing bacon cheese french fries   Despite having fries inside omelette ordered waffle fries which better sweet potato fries opinion   finished half   The Frozen Hot Chocolate actually pretty good but would choose dessert over it  Chocolate cake ice cream hot fudge don't remember name  mention whipped cream almost frosting good    We enjoyed sitting outside no problems servers  If back Vegas we'll stop again  <EOR> Too crowded hostesses rude when visited    The time did okay  Nothing special  Omelette okay overpriced   Even if want come back try more things just don't think it'll possible  place always packed    When tried visit more recently told wait would hour time kitchen closed another line outside could wait in   another hour but outside  UGH   Really?

Admitting lousy service but doing anything improve it  Thumbs down  seriously disappointed  won't returning  Sugar factory's goblets made bad service great drinks    I'm disappointed OH birthday  <EOR> Probably just timer me   Let's start service  boyfriend walked street side patio area facing Flamingo sure where front is  where no signs both obviously looked little lost walked stopped look host couple times  way finally finding front entrance passed least two servers just stared us  wouldn't far saying glared but definitely didn't look friendly offer assistance  When greeted host told would 15 20 minute wait patio which fine since time but just find confusing because only third tables patio area even occupied  Also weren't told option place Togo orders window front open seating  When finally seated server didn't come until 10 minutes later he didn't even ask drink order first  He just assumed ready order  He brought frozen hot chocolate even before getting water which total 20 minutes before offered drink  Very disappointed service but if total rewards card discount there's plus you    Now onto long anticipated frozen hot chocolate  seen many amazing photos read ton great reviews staple theirs but honestly just okay  literally name chilled hot chocolate  special really just alright  Don't wrong chocolate lover but really didn't much me    I'm glad finally experience but said just time thing me  <EOR> Love place whether NYC Vegas  Best time breakfast if don't want wait but if definitely worth wait  <EOR> It real 3 star place decor ice cream parlor burger good but salad need help old thank goodest frozen chocolate alway great  Need your step service some table touching smileing may help  <EOR> After driving around thirty minutes find parking space valet lots Ceasars Palace all full long walk through casino least no wait restaurant    Huge yummy ice cream desserts  Oh food  ordered triple grilled cheese sandwich chunky tomato soup macaroni cheese  saw enormous pieces ice cream cake onion rings not together   delivered frozen hot chocolate first  lots whipped cream chocolate shavings  Wow    Amazingly delicious food such touristy place  <EOR> Yes Serendipity 3 your Frozen Hot Chocolate good but costs $13!

Overall food good flavor comes very generous portions price you're paying  However service definitely best  <EOR> The food looks good very appealing however looks very deceiving food no flavor  service exactly happy but oh well  Once coming back again but least tried figure own <EOR> Not sure if posted last time somehow review disappeared  any case would highly recommend restaurant  location alone totally worth trip  Everything food friendly staff amazing  Steak sandwich great dessert red velvet cake ice cream huge leave some room it! <EOR> Worth going to   Once   Maybe more once if into GINORMOUS desserts   reviews Serendipity common theme which most people say food just fair if lousy but come desserts   agree people   absolutely right  couple weeks ago while famished ready huge breakfast group walked over Venetian line hordes   good sign thought   all pleading throngs just begging chance table thinking going good   feeling intensifed when reading menu posted outside walls many items entertainingly described   Anyway when seated food came reality set in   food mediocre   Picture Denny's I Hop steroids   Huge omelettes French Toast brick literally size brick sort thing   problem French Toast brick actually tasted brick   Then foot long steak sandwich eat inch then Done  All changes desserts   Amazing   Huge   Good   Satisfying   Fun    oxymoronically named Frozen Hot Chocolate actually damn good   If area wandering strip Israelites did biblical times want stuff your face fun dessert experience Serendipity probably worth trip  <EOR> Okay Serendipity did live expectations certain ways   But overall love definitely back     So lot friends gone Serendipity New York they've talked kitschy decorations all that   Yea Vegas none that   no decorations all   hard time ordering because honestly wasn't anything menu stood out     reason came was      the frrrrrrrrrrrrozen hot chocolate   come back everyday just drink   seriously heaven earth   fiance actually bought package stuff [you buy serendipity com] made home    but its just same   really sad wasn't hungrier     trying myself order another But knew didn't enough space   But hey Vegas another day half   just might back <EOR> Frozen hot chocolate delicious  I just wish didn't fill cup 3 4 way whipped cream 1 4 chocolate  <EOR> This place rocks casba!

The food say ALWAYS incredible frozen hot chocolate happy die heat Vegas without regret complaint    I screamed when saw Serendipity 3 Las Vegas  heart filled joy! Please try it! <EOR> I don't remember menu being large compared New York  think $10 small Frozen hot Chocolate way overpriced  good but worth it  wait long 30 45 minutes eat average style meal  <EOR> I've original Serendipity NY but location more tourist attraction type spot  Food overpriced but least portions big  would extremely disappointed  server extremely kind enough help friends daughter getting plate strawberries cream friend could eat lunch    3 shared CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD CHICKEN WAFFLES  enough food 3 leftovers take with  food decent but amazing  think would only come back dessert  ENJOY! <EOR> A combo cute sassy yummy!  frozen hot chocolate must eat here   yet try other flavors frozen treats   appetizers pretty good too   mention great customer service arrived late reservation still managed seat without enduring usual long wait  <EOR> I decided serendipity3 Las Vegas spouse bunch heard amazing definitely worth trying  11 50 am seated until 12 15 even though when arrived place even close full why did table available?

When lunch crab cake sandwich really good  Big portion ended eating all crab cake but leaving 1 3 bun  also comes bacon which adds nice crunch each bite  side sweet potato fries they something them made them slightly sweet  brown sugar maybe? really took notch though very filling satisfying meal  also bite friend's prosciutto pizza also really good  other places specialize dessert food items aren't good but place  Both food dessert yummy! Definitely worth try especially considering impossible seat NYC location! <EOR> I Serendipity 3 Miami New York place bad compare other locations!! frozen hot chocolate suppose amazing but watery melted here! try other locations place let down!! <EOR> Only come dessert honestly   food greasy average best but Frozen Hot Chocolate die something experience   Onion Ring Tower probably only acceptable dish here    Steak Egg Sandwiches Huge ass sandwich   Serving 2 more   sandwich super greasy steak itself tough    Frozen Hot Chocolate Saves restaurant 1 2 star   super heavenly presentation magnificient   wouldn't share anyone if choice  <EOR> This place alright  wanting try just because Serendipity haven't any other ones  didn't time wait line eat friends just window instead   My boyfriend shared Cappuchino Frozen Hot Chocolate dogs  think regular one  New York Dog? sure    The dog just that  Just hot dog  Nothing special    I hardly noticed any cappuchino flavor frozen hot chocolate  expected more fabulous   The only thing really caught eye fact give Total Rewards points buying here  its plastic utensils shiny look real silverware! lol <EOR> Serendipity bar asked couple rounds shots start off afternoon  waiter suggested bailey kahlua  Gahhh sweet  Okay gross lets again  Very crowded long waits okay service  come back?

But glad experience myself     I however even if order window plenty seating right front place Cesar's Palace  <EOR> I again family time everything great  First off love music restaurant  play very to date music always dancing your seat  ordered asian salad thai beef salad  Asian chicken salad any other asian salad but loved put salad bowl shaped wonton wraps  very creative  thai beef salad recommended us  loved steak  very tender nicely cooked only thing wish sauce thick but tasty  NY steak sandwich super yummy favorite things steak eggs bacon  Heavenly   This place pricey but portions huge  easily share entree another person  topped off meal classic sundae frozen hot chocolate course  <EOR> Really wanted try frozen hot chocolate but outside window closed guessing due cold Well bartender very rude acted if she didn't want sitting bar she didn't want frozen drink  top It off she said 15 15 menu clearly states 12 I would minded paying 15 but service The blond bartender worked 12 16 15 needs brush customer service skills The hostess sweet but bartender made feel unwelcome Ill try another if she isn't working if outside window open  <EOR> Came 8 girls last weekend part bachelorette party   Unfortunately turned very disappointing meal me     First all $11 frozen hot chocolate ?? can't same treat whole world raves about   icy WAY sweet tasted concoction could whip home some instant nestle powder   alone boat many fellow diners agreed me   Even friend New York regularly frequents original manhattan serendipity she thought served inferior quality   If must order tourist trap treats suggest Amaretto flavor much better tasting regular one     Breakfast did fare much better   wanted order egg white shrimp frittata but waitress told ran really? 10 30am?? Instead ordered fried eggs benedict Corn Meal Crusted Fried Poached Eggs Classic Hollandaise Canadian Bacon atop Sausage Gravy House Made Biscuit   When dish arrived certainly looked pretty enough!  But alas did taste good looked   hoped despite egg being fried yolk would still relatively runny   hopes quickly dashed  lack creamy yolkiness took all fun away eating eggs benedict hollandaise sauce sparse biscuit dry tough cut flaky all   All all probably worst eggs benedict had     The other girls ordered staple brunch dishes french toast chicken waffles omelet    Portions massive made great photo ops   But end nobody raved food took back 70% doggie bags   brighter note leftovers put good use later evening drunken midnight snack   guess beer goggles apply tastebuds well! <EOR> I've all Serendipty 3's u S say Las Vegas favorite! atmosphere much newer cleaner but most importantly customer service best everything just seemed much bigger Vegas! can't wait come back humongous slice chocolate cake! However am only giving place 4 stars because actual food only okay   Nothing really special    but place definitely good dessert spot! <EOR> First time trying place  first didn't know where located  Walked mall end ceasers palace front ceasers  where located   The food lot  would recommend sharing plate especially price charge    It super busy but food came timely drinks refilled without asking  <EOR> I think overly hyped myself seeing Rachel Ray NYC location $40 Day way back when  visually fell love w big ol' cup frozen hot chocolate she shared w hunnie told myself day w mine   Fast forward past weekend Vegas where finally remembered come must say put damper things  Wait long  only made all more psyched hands frozen hot chocolate  must hella good take long right?!

Super fresh well balanced flavors enough spice satisfy Latina <EOR> We came Wednesday made reservation 5  Love take reservations! However upon being greeted hostess she nicest   She needed attitude adjustment  She definitely friendly kinda brainless really caty coworkers   Upon being seated everyone really friendly nice  waitress great super friendly   She made awesome hostess coworker     The decor really strange here   bit small looks bigger space least inside   nice pink ladies nice looking bar area men   nice outdoor seating area but cold during December   would probably really nice april june months when unbearably hot     This good place desserts girlfriends  if having weekend Vegas   I Summer Bries  open face sandwich   Presentation definite plus cone wise fries  Brie melted enough  whole lot turkey  Good cranberry cheese spread  Overall fair  Sweet potato fries good     My boyfriend Full Monty ciabatta bread good! The Hangover omelet big looks very filling  The Frozen Hot Chocolate fair   tasted hot chocolate but frozen form cold chocolate latte  personal favorite   Tips eatery Pick better hostess  She first person consumers meet  <EOR> Keeps namesake New York City amazing presentation great flavor flair courteous staff boot  If you're going eat anywhere strip Serendipity 3 place be  Don't forget Frozen Hot Chocolate spin classic desert drink! <EOR> My husband shared chocolate peanut butter frozen hot chocolate   ordered take out window enjoyed treat while sitting outside people watching Ceasers  tasty but little pricey somewhat less creamy chocolate peanut butter milkshake  <EOR> Wings tiny good whatsoever  Burger made brother throw up  Only dessert  normal food awful expensive  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised Chicken Strips place  Great tasting especcially sauces accompany it  course frozen hot chocolate consistently good! <EOR> Definitely Las Vegas destinations but also legitimate tourist trap  Sitting right along strip belonging Caesar's Palace place booms  use your Caesar's rewards cards here  But also Serendipity's four locations nationwide might well check out  There's plenty outdoor seating if you're taking courtesy Caesar's   I've dined probably twice some sort spaghetti which came larrrrgeeee serving size complete three meatballs  bar inside also complimented drink  Everyone raves frozen hot chocolate which pretty bomb don't even chocolate  gets little sweet if around long though  drinks costly but you're Vegas splurge might well!  Now usually only stop street part necessarily dining just to go items back restaurant  Las Vegas style hot dog which literally length forearm topped cheese jalapenos  HUUUUGE  Trust $9 same price sliders but sliders MINI  They're worth hot dog   And water cost extra  Lol  <EOR> If reservation sure hold it  Dont try cancelling showing late they'll charge $100  Don't show early they'll wait til your scheduled reservation time even if tables free up   Food mediocre  Salmon wild rice salad  never asked I'd salmon cooked when said medium more well done   point asking? wild rice salad    should guessed name going weird  sweet cranberries but also mixed curry? say least disappointed ordered    but everyone else seemed enjoy food   definitely made bad choice   Seems place good dessert  dont joke around size dessert portions   All all guess I'd give another shot change mind  <EOR> Frozen hot chocolate=yummy worth $11 even close   Ordered veggie burger  Reading menu sounded delish  When served= chicken pieces sandwich! heck?! Manager apologized but no explanation chicken veggie burger could served plate?!  Told 15 20 minute wait=reality closer 45 minutes  Awful service  server quit day just stormed off  customer should done same   Famous being recognized movie but other worth hype  All! <EOR> Although food good place service best  sat took 15 minutes someone come take order asked two people send waitress would both nod heads walk away  planning returning definitely worth wait! <EOR> Went fall 2013 French toast log phenomenal when came back Vegas past weekend serendipity first place came exact same thing   friends other various brunch items which all looked good but didn't want try them because hands full own plate   frozen hot chocolate delicious too   admit service great   Especially past May visit when plate delivered 20 minutes everyone else table theirs   done eating time finally mine    Somebody majorly screwed there    no problems first time though food great both times   more time when bring daughter Vegas just because talked place much first time now she wants try it  But probably again that  <EOR> I love restaurant!

The only thing enjoyed macchiato  frozen hot chocolate     I never going again unless craving frozen hot chocolate wait 10 min max cuz said earlier worth it   Their management unprofessional  2 hosts talking badly manager he she comes whenever he she wants   mean  your opinion right say want but c'mon    customers   15 them standing front waiting seated you're talking badly your manager? unprofessional  Hosts face restaurant   first impression say worst    The server nice but dumb well  noticed total reward members receive discount   asked if could just give total rewards # used towards bill he said he'll meal when he brings bill  Well     yeah its fault forgot mention remind when received bill but if he's told he'll after   thenn shouldn't he responsible asking again when he gives bill? could've saved around $10 but     nope    I would expect more restaurant associated Caesars palace  <EOR> Great way cool off frozen hot chocolate but share it! Super rich super delectable  hot dogs great nacho cheese jalapenos  Again they're enormous! <EOR> Grab should grab go   ordered Grab window when she finally called number 2 customers already food wasn't even covered could take GO  When asked if she bag carry food room she rudely said Well could told earlier  Lady says GRAB GO   If wasn't going would gone inside sit eat!  food mediocre  Nothing great  even famous Frozen Hot Chocolate nothing fancy either  Just tastes every other shake there   Perhaps next time inside see if better service try sundaes  PERHAPS  <EOR> If reviewing ONLY Frozen Hot Chocolate Fro Ho then would 5 Star review all way!  However since am doing whole Serendipity experience knock off few stars     This location sits front Caesar's right off Strip   very big inside limited seats inside out translates long lines   cute all white pink orange accents   However way around lines just heading window outside sit down restaurant your sweet treats   result long line but moves!    My hubby ordered couple 16oz Fro Ho's found ledge sit drink them since limited outside seating all full!  huge outside space fill less half seating which results people plunking themselves everywhere!?  Duh put more seats!  room!!!  Anyways sampled Fro Hos enjoyed people watching opportunity section Caesar's gives us     The Fro Ho tasted exactly would expect icy version winter treat   yummy just good sun ledge would inside maybe pretty but loved all same     It fun stop   Next time am getting donut big head   calling me!!! <EOR> So food last month  first weekend October because hubby comp rooms  He's never said now must stop spot when come Vegas    We sat bar big screen just plain sight enjoy soccer game while already enjoying ambiance food drinks  ordered Bloody Mary which biting peppery just it  But if soup would need mention non spicy    I Orchard Salad  tossed vinaigrette cubes chicken breast spinach pecans dried cherries apples cherry tomatoes cucumbers feta crumbles apple slices   Hubby omelette forgot which but huge beautifully fluffy greasy all came crispy yummy seasoned fries   perfect lunch late night gambling drinking   bit pricey tab $46 but all ordinary Vegas Caesar's     Oh! bartender nice! stuffed meal said didn't room order FHC but he poured each half glassful just hubby try anyway   Loved that!    We definately coming back  <EOR> My wife loves place beginning grow me   service consistent desserts die for   Great dinner atmosphere  <EOR> I've dined twice now came conclusion Frozen Hot Chocolate only thing worth ordering  tastes amazeballs! food served huge portions but don't taste extraordinary  If Total Rewards card remember bring small discount many food items  <EOR> I always wanted try place since prime location smack dab middle Vegas strip  chance try Serendipity because boyfriend craving sweet snack some drinks  place still packed 1130pm when obviously quality food there  finally decided fried oreo sunday share  Wow! Never such yummy but bad treat! whole thing explosion sinful goodness mouth  trying dessert only imagine great rest items are  <EOR> Serendipitys overall delicious experience  food great tried macaroni cheese chili Oreo frozen hot chocolate red velvet sundae  Everything incredibly delicious but bit overpriced  Also menu employees really stressed no sharing rule charged extra if shared played  Luckily waitress great  <EOR> I really expecting more this  mac cheese kinda bleh  figured place known hot chocolate   er frozen whatever   would comfort food down pat  Getting seated kind nightmare atmosphere bright crowded taste    I would tried again but several months later found Max Brenner which everything wanted Serendipity be  <EOR> It's good breakfast though rest menu stinks  quite pricey  would recommend place food  <EOR> Service sucks!

That aside 8 pm still pretty busy   waiting patio seats restaurant since quick dining option outside didn't any dessert   seated 15 minutes later found plenty empty seats patio wasn't quite sure why made wait   another those Vegas things never understand?  Anyway between 3 ordered frozen hot chocolate strawberry ice cream sundae cheesecake   Little did know store us   frozen hot chocolate treat especially almonds   rich sweet satisfying drink   However real page turner when cheesecake came out   cheesecake approached 3 jaws dropped   thought myself sure  table 10 across way?  thing could its own cake!    Because its massiveness afraid hunk cake would suffer restaurant chain rule 1 yucky inedible 2 generic tasting   actually wrong   cake wasn't sweet creamy gelatinous but simple most importantly didn't taste came freezer section Costco   Score!  gave best shot along 2 other dining companions most through half it   would definitely eat desserts again but next time bring more people! <EOR> Came serendipity3 again grabbed some dinner  before good  Today okay  pretty busy lots parties little slow  nachos usually die but time came completely soggy! really disappointed because favorites  also ABC burger pretty good  would recommend classic burger though  But end good note fried Oreo sundae world! <EOR> So obviously try place since all deserts well movie! looking try    noticing prices little above average that's given but some specialty deserts $700+ $1k+ INSANE!!!   No didn't spend kind money something melts  asked bar tender Serendipity known must try   guess NY there's always line door Frozen Hot Chocolate   while way saw bar tender some really yummy looking drinks apparently Berry Mojito Strawberry Cheesecake Mojito! just because Vegas can    said take each to go well     My thoughts Frozen Hot Choc average nothing would stand line hours for  chocolate shake basically  rich tastes frozen micro ice it    flavor just hot chocolate       mojito however   OMG yum! greenery alcohol but exceptional  Cheesecake good if syrupy sweet  personal favorite Berry Mojito    I'd give place another try some actual food next time there  <EOR> On hot summer day vegas would want   no NEED frozen hot chocolate! just taste cant describe!

NOTE restroom located outside double doors  <EOR> You're Frrrozen Hot Chocolate right?

Don't bother waiting table  You're anything else anyway  Stand line outside shop order kind $11 frozen hot chocolate  <EOR> Wait always gonna long due popularity but well worth it  Food great  favorite triple decker grilled cheese w creamy dreamy tomato soup  satisfying  finish off 3 share frozen hot chocolate two  don't whipped cream just stick chocolate  Great food very wide selection service suitable amount people  always come back lunch whilst visiting Vegas  Tip reservation via OpenTable usually do  <EOR> Cool little place  normal dining area walk window snacks treats  Buffalo Chicken Tenders  spicy all but great favor  wife nachos she enjoyed them  Neither could finish meal especially Nachos  Huge Tray Nachos  waitress nicest waitress encountered during stay Vegas  <EOR> Where even start? extremely slow service inflated prices below par frozen hot chocolate?!

All know very saddened frozen hot chocolate  Because sounds really fancy! sounds should exotic delicious! But sip two dawned we'd totally just spent $11 glorified chocolate milkshake probably worth $2 3 most   There nothing interesting exciting innovative frozen hot chocolate all  even tasty  taken ride  happy never return Serendipity 3   But font use menu  <EOR> Like most over priced places Vegas another tourist trap  $19 dollars substandard cheeseburger $19 dry plain blt  Just lame diner food   No reason back     We left feeling deflated cheated $45   Complete waste time   Slow service waitress seemed indifferent food took 45 minutes come out   wasn't even busy  WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS VACATION MINUTES COMING HERE   Nothing special  $15 dollars ice cream sundae????? didn't even bother   money better spent something different back home   Lesson learned   No hype here   Major disappointment  <EOR> Lot mediocre overpriced food  Pancakes potatoes three eggs substituted fruit instead sausage $20? wouldn't come back unless starving today  <EOR> I excited try place finally but sadly disappointed   My friends going eat lunch but  wait time over hour half  didn't understand many tables open  Maybe short staff? Honestly wouldn't mind waiting if wasn't starving    Luckily To Go order window outside only order SOME stuff  Since going eat Bacchanals later just needed something  fill tummy  Frozen Hot Chocolate which number 1 item everyone recommended  VERY disappointed  First assume going come did dine pictures NOPE  came To Go cup  Which understand since To Go but STILL wanted picture  Secondly just tasted chocolate regular chocolate shake IN N OUT   Didn't taste no hot chocolate flavor expecting  Maybe because To Go instead dining in? MAYBE   Overall might come again  time dine To Go  <EOR> So reading mad raves good frozen hot chocolate figure try out    The wait 45 mins instead waiting inside ordered mine outside   16 ounce $10 32 ounce $15   Took sip all taste powder!  reminds drinking starbucks frappacino!  think price way $$ even great!  Other then cute pink little parlor friendly hostess! <EOR> Of course famous frozen hot chocolates fabulous no need argue here   But food a okay   Came dinner over halloween weekend decided sit outside outdoors patio absolutely loved atmosphere nice see people walk such     I ordered ahi tuna salad so so nothing special not really worth price $16 I'd say   frozen hot chocolate strawberry sauce candied almonds toppings lets just say delicious!! worth every penny although friend could probably gotten away just ordering versus two portion  <EOR> You gotta love place BOTH food dessert   Which if know Serendipity3 surprise normally think only dessert place   initially surprised prices thought because Las Vegas   Well prices way because portions huge!  example $25 Chicken Waffles seemed steep until see portion   must 3 4 large pieces fried chicken 3 large pieces waffles     We ordered French Toast Log which equally large   Taste wise Asian chicken salad even appetizer buffalo chicken strips great!

I Saint Sinners French Toast Log whatever   HUGE but very impressive when its just huge hunk bread    but then again guess  french toast log T mixed berries warm T normal??    As Frozen Hot Chocolate      AMAZING!! all  <EOR> Like JM  initially going give Serendipity only 4 stars but decided otherwise  food service excellent don't understand mere three star overall rating  made dinner reservation few days ahead seated almost immediately   ordered lettuce wraps chicken fried crispy noodles which came 3 different sauces 1 chimi churro 2 red Thai slightly spicy sauce 3 peanut sauce all which absolutely delicious  Mom ordered burger without cheese loved also loved saltiness fries  Sister bf ordered something else but sure what    enjoyed whatever ordered though  Also tried double frozen hot chocolate which nothing special    tasted just chocolate shake  However still tasty end delicious meal  Most surprising waitress's can't remember name sadly ability remember all orders without even having write them down  Very impressive!!  Whenever return Vegas definitely visiting again try other items menu especially desserts! <EOR> I made reservations brunch 1 month before  hostess cant find reservation  2 hostess really rude unfriendly  Food wasnt great service sucks! Really awful service  <EOR> This definitely place whenever you're Vegas    Serendipity 3 other places embraced technology check in process  wait table often super long however great way notify when your table ready  host takes down you're cell phone number store's iPad you'll text when your table ready  gives flexibility around without having hold those now archaic pagers  <EOR> I've wanting try place    so gave try while Vegas time I disappointed service  wait time shorter time took waiter take order   The food okay  chicken strips potato stuffed cheese   I wanted try desert but service slow      Will give place another try deserts  <EOR> I agree other Chris G wrote review here  place sucks  its appearance which reminds color pink friend vomited eating strawberry milkshake its confusing counterintuitive layout  felt entered exited wrong door I Las Vegas past September social outing  Now behold person wanted come here  Far it  while am going use time Yelp kick feet air fit childish rage also pleasantly surprised   And bequeath extra star    I knew somebody knew somebody else liked place because offers $1000 gold encrusted sundae gold spoon  only people actually order sundae people commissioned Food Network campy documentaries Las Vegas photograph film review fetishize it    But decadence silliness Las Vegas people ordering such desserts happens often enough according server middle american permed bangs boasted table it   The food typical diner fare felt if lucky incredibly lucky choose delicious boca burger wasn't bland horrible expecting be  sweet potato fries fact surprisingly good disillusioned me  Everything more fluffy big  But certainly filling  Thanks friends kicking screaming all way over really  <EOR> So finally opportunity check Serendipity3 weekend  totally did live expectations  expecting just cool NYC  ambiance decor pretty cool but still lacking NYC  Overall experience just OK  Pricey quality portion  following items ordered were The frozen hot chocolate ****  Strawberry Malt ***  Classic sundae w strawberries **  Chicken Tenders ****  Tortilla Chips w Artichoke *** <EOR> What's all hype about?

I also deep fried oreo cookies n cream ice cream   While sounds delicious deep fried oreos expected thinks deeply inserting oily hot deep friend oreos into ice cream??

Well lucky Monday sat bar soon walked in     No complaints here    Share couple friends won't feel cheated  decor cute worth moment roll through if cutesy places  <EOR> My main reason going Serendipity 3 indulge famous frozen hot chocolates  alone worth four stars  reason didn't give restaurant four stars because wait long  love frozen hot chocolate? Yes  Am willing wait hour plus sit dirty table enjoy one? No  frozen hot chocolate home    The times eaten food good  particularly remember some ribs mustard sauce really enjoyed  However food doesn't wait dirty tables which end every time there  Also no matter much enjoy visits Serendipity never crave it  Every time gone sort ended accidentally  <EOR> I've many times can't believe haven't written review yet!  favorite places when we're Vegas LOVE frozen chocolate!  usually kobe sliders those always really good   mac 'n cheese truffle yum gigantic cobb salad spaghetti many other tasty treats there   wait bad text when your table ready always just walk around Caesars when wait   service always pretty good friendly faces quick responses  <EOR> If you're looking cute sy place try great location Strip in front Caesar's Palace place should your list  Yes expensive probably overpriced but place Strip isn't? wait pretty crazy but did kick ass table outside patio amazing view great service! frozen hot chocolate amazing lets honest but couldn't come close finishing because drink huge! friend fun time chatting enjoying beverage dessert being strip  would come back sure!! <EOR> Lured promise amazing Frozen Hot Chocolate determined try Serendipity     I originally wanted eat outside patio order take out window but windows closed some reason   why?  wait seated 45 minutes when arrived asked if to go inside directed bar   Since available seat bar decided stay eat there     Unfortunately line to go orders right next seat hard enjoy your meal when loads hungry cranky hot chocolate seekers hovering over your food  HINT could solved opening take out window  FOOD Root Beer Float $14 ordered mixed drink called Root Beer Float which came looking milk shake but filled alcoholic yummyness warmed inside  Mmmmm!

Something thought strange but certainly big deal  <EOR> After hearing all hype frozen hot chocolate travel channel     we wanted see if frozen hot chocolate worth Serendipity 3   Well know     the fozen hot chocolate short    a chocolate shake!  cost $10 00!  16oz cup which ordered Grab N window $11 50 banana split!   Also charge $1 00 tap drinking water pay cost plastic drinking cups   You're already paying costly prices food still want charge plastic cups $1 00    bottom line never  going back place! Las Vegas NYC!   worth frozen hot chocolate!  stick Ghirardelli sundaes milk shakes aka frozen hot chocolate ! <EOR> The frozen chocolate good but super sweet   worth try if before   server nice friendly but service towards end meal sucked water empty more half meal settling bill took for e ver     good dining experience but ruined lack service   really don't think come again    <EOR> In word unimpressive  wait ridiculously long dine in  Luckily side window where order most same menu items long you're willing eat outside think Disneyland type setting   Unfortunately even line moves slow feeling extra claustrophobic considering people behind basically all me! ordered giant soft pretzel frozen hot chocolate  Both tasted worse food concession stand  Prices also high maybe just because hype being originally New York all  <EOR> Favorite spot strip! Amazing burgers even better sundaes  Tend longer waiting time weekends but always worth it  Recommend frozen hot chocolate  <EOR> A bit more pricey regular American food but portions justice  Taste wise? okay nothing memorable  desserts look pretty taste good but probably something cheaper better lesser known joint  <EOR> The best way describe place saying while tasty enough overpriced overrated   We seated right away it Wednesday afternoon which plus  seated heat lamp which also plus because wasn't exactly super warm outside  however crazy birds swooping around tables  There's gotta something unsanitary right? Some sort health code violation? sure prevent maybe just better cleanup food dumb children or dumb adults let's honest might thrown ground them   As food hard find anything menu under 12 bucks  Even appetizers  opted 16 dollar burger which cooked exactly way wanted medium rare plus!   While both burger fries good worth 16 bucks certainly anything would rave about  Dessert = also expensive  boyfriend split simple sundae butterscotch hot fudge  Tasty   but 13 14 dollar tasty   I don't feel need ever come back honestly  Glad experienced once but no need ever round 2  respectfully bowing now  <EOR> We breakfast some reason brought huge plate dessert cleverly disguised breakfast    Where when child would though greatest breakfast EVER?  french toast basically chocolate cake but neither good FT nor cake but ate because hungry lot walking day   did buzz humming bird into sugar coma shortly after    Fiance's breakfast little more breakfast better received but can't remember he even ordered  pricing really expensive steep ended with   Honestly regard rolling mistake won't repeat   Maybe picked bad dish should done different meal but honestly no intention trying again because whole body kicks when think unhealthy swill ended feeding last trip  <EOR> The place packed!!

Yum!! only 2 when straight bar didn't wait  ordered regular oreo frozen hot chocolate sliders perfect amount 2 girls share  I'd only come desserts much food  think overpriced  <EOR> This place way overrated  frozen hot chocolate yucky  Starbucks Frappuccino way better less half price  don't it  because people TV say oh must follow too  sure rent terrible them  might survive but only because new tourists arriving each month  <EOR> I no idea savory items taste place but love desserts   When family came Las Vegas last summer came three times course week   love all sundaes deep fried oreos bomb diggity   I'd say if want try something besides frozen hot chocolate deep fried oreo sundae   frozen hot chocolate also awesome   Both times shared boyfriend but could've all myself talking double portion   I'd say little small but love shake like confections   think no matter time come always dessert something else because when think Serendipity 3 think dessert   respect review little biased just desserts    all had   trying coax university friends come instead going happy hour  good  D <EOR> If don't plan going NY visit original If never tried Frozen Hot Chocolate then should try it    Once then any coffee house ice blended mocha satisfied   The hotdog foot long greasy? buttery? bun? Meh $8 better spent somewhere else  <EOR> I'd come dessert again though maybe food  During LV vacay friends last week came sizable group chance try several items menu   dessert  frozen hot chocolate  waiter told 14 different kinds chocolate grind into powder then mixed hot water served shaved ice  honest don't think really different if made home w regular hot choco mix  hefty price tag $10 LV status   frozen strawberry item  strawberry version frozen hot chocolate above it    though again price steep   brownie sundae w 2 scoops ice cream  forgot name item but brownies really awesome though sweeter side  liked it     ^_^  food pizza  thin crust another food item forgot food avg worth $$$ opinion    conclusion if ever walk around again hot summer day I'd come strawberry hot chocolate frozen dessert      Oh sundae item menu $77!!!!!  another boxed item $10 000 maybe joke  =  golden sundae! <EOR> Four star food two service!!  If you're familiar Serendipity's NYC  it won't disappoint but service little lacking   Wait little long during peak time  around 4 pm packed but also very hot outside   summer bad Vegas!! prepare wait  Outdoor indoor seating available  Also counter service other side restaurant  Full bar   located right outside Caesars Palace!!  Go if slow but would wait line food plenty places eat drink strip   A sundae run 13 00 up!! <EOR> Sure enough came dad's birthday dinner  high priced place day before he preferred favorite burger  He also quite excited see discount Total Rewards card a dollar off different items   <EOR> Just tickled PINK!!!! luv Serendipity!!!

However time around service terrible! If wanted something another spoon extra straw more napkins hot water rarely own waiter  always kind busboy which don't even think job begin with! When bill came around asked if could use total rewards card knock down prices  waiter believe name Jeffrey G told he cannot give discounts  doesn't sense  Why would advertise if couldn't it? then asked why he hesitated long time then said he asked beginning if anyone total rewards card said no  CLEARLY remember asking any such thing nor did respond no totals reward  He proceeded say he no longer change system which being waitress myself KNOW isn't completely true  Then he left table when trying flag down he would clearly look then walk away ignoring table  He finally came back table when already standing walking out   We still tipped decently because busboy  But now think shouldn't have   All all food good dessert too  However service ruined night  Two stars food ladies ushers front desk busboy! 3 stars waiter  <EOR> My husband friends came Serendipity 3 twice while Vegas July 2012  first time dinner which very good but typical American type sandwiches burgers  Huge sizes! sat outside due long wait inside even though over 100 degrees outside fans kept cool  waitress friendly all zero personality  second time came just frozen hot chocolate which good! sat bar but again staff friendly all  restaurant adorable very whimsical fun feel but staff really does give same vibe  <EOR> This third time coming expected much visit     Boy WRONG! made reservations ended seating family table Super wobbly   FIRST hostess friendly SECOND Waitress serve awhile THIRD FINALLY When asked waitress if could change seats  instead acknowledging she called Manger tightened knob but didn't help all explaining couldn't move without having wait    BUT MADE RESERVATION fault  waitress prissy rude  She didn't even want serve lemon water when clearly saw another waitress passed lemons      Additionally when orders fries meal   gave Precooked fries sitting over 20min we know because sitting next kitchen FRIES COLD MUSHY   Unless change management  DONT WASTE UR TIME COMING HERE  <EOR> Hmmm swear place better when first opened = time around same fettucini alfredo craved raved friends tasted plain  coulda made myself half price   The spaghetti wasn't good remember = Sad   Thankfully froho frozen hot chocolate hit spot 100 degree days  <EOR> I little bit disappointing heard many great things place   stopped location outside Cesars Place option waiting 20 minutes dine in order outside window  chose order outside took quite while  ordered frozen hot chocolate which $10 sorely disappointed  basically glorified frosty whipped cream served plain cup sprinkles  prices differ between inside outside which why think looked different but just don't think chocolate milkshake worth all  also ordered corndog because starving  realize corndogs aren't specialty but totally microwaved $6 expected little bit more <EOR> MUST TO! wait time little long but restaurant smaller expected    When told would text when table ready  much better having wait around  service wonderful desserts delish! give such HUGE portions    Next time Vegas coming back try entrees  Pretty good prices judging generous portions  Just prepared long wait time  <EOR> honestly very disappointed when came frozen hot chocolate  i frequent both new york vegas when saw opened quite excited looking forward signature dessert   it nothing original new york!! first thought smart made take counter avoid 2hour line but i'd rather wait extra hour 55min if knew drink tasted bad  first watered down second chunks unblended ice drink!!   this branch does give serendipity 3 good image all   so if never tried heard wait new york  <EOR> Had great breakfast!

Tip management educate your greeters importance FRIENDLY face <EOR> I visited serendipity 3 during Christmas week family expected wait long wait seated  But hostess she greeted horribly awfully rude way she told would 45 min wait asked phone number she would text when opening available  She never texted let know  When next family behind reservation hostess greeted them nicely manner  decided order outside stand ordered vanilla lady told she ran vanilla but next guy behind ordered vanilla she gave him  She also very rude having vanilla  visiting Bay Area California all wanted nice experience Serendipity john cusack serendipity but no did happen first time experience serendipity ruined  <EOR> Their dessert super!

The sandwich flavorful filling  eating kept telling myself BEST sandwich ever tasted probably because thought being free made 10x better   The Crab Artichoke dip tasty  full crab meat rather actual mayo dip mix which plus  Since couldn't finish all took rest dip back hotel  some breakfast morning some bread crackers kept room still tasted good  Next time probably order again but meal instead appetizer   For dessert ordered infamous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate  Before ordered asked waiter if okay use Frrrozen Hot Chocolate coupon PH  He told coupon wouldn't valid unless ordered more certain amount but said he'll try work us  moment very happy waiter great service although wish remembered name !  The Frrrozen Hot Chocolate sweet thick  light consistency which didn't full  would compare soft smooth chocolate milkshake    Once received tab Frrrozen Hot Chocolate ended being FREE!

Brunch however something would come back for  Overpriced breakfast lunch items weren't even tasty  corned beef potatoes over easy eggs  corn beef hash much better actually disappointed when came just meat itself  Average must say nothing rave about   The BF Fried Egg Benedict   another no no  Wasn't feeling gravy sauce maybe because expecting some type usual hollandaise sauce egg benedicts normally comes with  fried egg itself dry tasteless  came two benedicts but he only ate one   tells something food right?  Overall   food mehhh   not something would ever come back for  BUT would absolutely come back another frozen hot chocolate though! <EOR> I really struggle between 3 4 stars place   apparently those places try vegas   portions bit huge   hot dog maybe ate half it   friend steak sandwich also footlong   Someone else nachos most def work best appetizer large group   person cant finish them   really just wasteful   But food good   OMG fantastic good but good   would again but split your meal someone else unless something salad   did order fried oreo sundae which really good but hoped better chocolate sauce this   tasted something jar   But overall still good  think great place stop dessert walking strip but actual meal   If high hopes try dessert maybe stick couple appetizers table then dessert  <EOR> Only once far but definitely coming back next time vegas!

Treat costumers dirt  hostess she did even pay attention me  3 minutes later she pretended compliment dress  cute color she said  She asked name put down  She said wait going 30 45 minutes  friend wait outside  45 minutes later     came back she told did put name down    The right customer service would say am sorry  must your name wrong  Lemme your name now try soon possible However she kept arguing did give name  5 minutes  only two parties Asian waiting table  wore bright green dress  She came multiple times call names sitting front her  am stupid waste 45 minutes vacation time Vegas if did put name down  She did even apologize  narcissist!!!   Another guy waited 45 minutes before telling she did call name he outside whole time  She also argued she called name    I cannot believe Vegas Serendipity kind customer service  Max Brenner instead amazing food attentive customer service  3 people serving whole time  manager even stopped table talked us  <EOR> The worst customer service EVER! No smiles  No way experience nice  wait party arrive waitress suggested wait bar  Then bartender told leave because didn't want drink until rest party arrived  food ok  Nothing special  only things made trip restaurant worth dessert  fried Oreos divine  Overall I'd give place half star if could  <EOR> Just back Vegas spot list places visit  must confess first heard Oprah their Frozen Hot Chocolate fav     The building very easy find since hot pink front Ceaser's Palace  friends sat bar because packed lunch  bartender very friendly recommended Strawberries Cream Mojito  naturally try it  Yes expensive $14 think but very big absolutely yummy! ordered cheese pizza finished off Frozen Hot Chocolate 2 we shared FOUR people still couldn't finish it!

Now would think would toss new correct one   did instead?  fudged wrong drink adding some elements juice whatever look guest ordered   know all this?  Because actually conversed loudly enough hear it   I thought giving 1 star but just original sake am giving 2  <EOR> Like most everyone said service stinks  waitress could more personality perhaps practiced little more fake smile more genuine looking  She little rushed personable   Although say 2 gals dealt front counter excellent getting party 5 seated 5 mins instead 30 mins told begin with  114 degree weather today probably could've gone inside seating but probably would 30 min wait  fan misters OK if directly its path    Our drinks came fairly quick along baby's kid meal which 2 burger sliders could easily devoured bite any starved adult  they microscopic! guess perfect child 21 months   Thai Salad pretty good Nachos appetizer @ $14 shabby only thing good condiments came sour cream real guacamole fresh salsa  Buffalo Wings nothing special just your ordinary batch came sticks carrots celery ranch dressing   What wowed White Cholocate Frozen Hot Chocolate  think gipped because ordered Large share but looked exactly Regular single serving Oreo Frozen someone party ordered  Banana Split told good along Caramel Sundae someone else got   All all place if youre Starvin Marvin food but wasn't let down w my dessert choice since am true White Choco lover  need re train staff but gave girl full tip only because want believe she just tired heat just probably having great day  Whatever  Overpriced  3 stars because enjoyed company  <EOR> Make reservations wait pretty long    The sandwiches delicious! ordered corned beef rye huge worth  Try pineapple sangrias! pitcher! yourself! lol but seriously sangria very light very sweet    and ofcourse frozen hot chocolate must try  <EOR> The wait long food o k  category  place just experience! expected more since saw place Kardashian's show  made look trip Disneyland! But disappointments happen every day! <EOR> Food amazing here  Brought family along during vegas trip  Everyone seemed enjoy food  But prices scared them just bit! $5 toast! TOAST!!!! <EOR> 2 5 3 stars   I preface because location NY waited hour table there  Once desserts NY location see why worth wait!  The Vegas location 1 hour long wait opted express line fairly quick  pick window if short time   We Banana Split some huge foot long hot dog some frozen hot chocolate drink   The food pretty good fills bill desserts forte  Would come back yes novelty thing   The portions frozen hot chocolate big enough 3 4 people   I recommend making reservation if eat inside  If eat outside big tent somebody your group stake table while somebody places order  point gets crowded fast   Kid friendly yes  Fun groups yes  Parking near casinos  If park Caesars self park navigate through casino just ask staff members place   If mood type food unable place just further placed called Shake Shack   Vegas location but know NYC home run! <EOR> The frozen hot chocolate good but pricey was  <EOR> Love concept Frozen Hot Chocolate!! children love them    prices crazy expensive  only complaint    But still stop whenever town   <EOR> I don't even look know everyone probably raving frozen hot chocolate because place known for  super good but prepared wait long time pay lot money one  $12 if remember correctly  Don't bother food anything else cause all very mediocre overpriced  Very much touristy place  knockoff NYC which also wait hours table  But frozen hot chocolate worth try if you're walking by  <EOR> We frozen hot chocolate share right amount chocolatey sweetness  love chocolate but sometimes little sweet but sharing definitely great idea  <EOR> Over  My lowly review unlikely any effect patronage over hyped over crowded over priced tourist trap     $15 double frozen hot chocolate?  Shame giving into hype   feel slapped silly called Susan   kind chocolate shake ice chunks     My buddy coward's banana split   $14   looked big   banana split   cost $14   Last checked bananas ice cream don't cost much   But suppose rent Caesar's Palace does   We could gone Max Brenner   or maybe just stayed home saved ourselves hour wait table 45 minutes waited orders served $$ spent     Sweet?  Yes very   Bitter?  Nah just over it  <EOR> Don't expect same ambiance NYC   NYC way better   reminds 50s diner lot noise   probably because Vegas     We made reservations 8 30 PM since few friends ours also reservations time   arrived 8 20 PM hostess told would seated 5 minutes   Then friends arrived seated right away   think hostess forgot although standing right front them      We ordered crab artichoke dip well two sandwiches The Vegas High Heel Pump    dip delicious sandwiches huge!  could finish them all   would recommend sharing sandwich   also ordered Frozen Hot Chocolate which just much   But order it     Overall would definitely head NYC location instead LV one  <EOR> Decent place if want gorge down some rather hefty portions but price pay there's much better places spend your money Vegas   So doesn't even compare original Serendipity NYC but scorching day walking around strip cooling down bowl frozen hot chocolate genius idea   so you'd think  shame even manage mess up  hard use blender?

I didn't because that'd horribly embarrassing but COULD  matters right?   RIGHT?

Frozen Hot Chocolate just sounds cool  Starbucks or somewhere else  cheaper Frappaccino half price half wait  opinion place WAAAAYYYY overrated  <EOR> This review solely Oreo frozen hot chocolate  Omgoodness seriously love first sip! literally said omg wow afterwards! taste nothing before creamy smooth  definitely best milkshake ever thick nor liquidy  whip cream top delicious!   I am sweets person thoroughly impressed  $11 quite expensive milkshake but honestly worth every single penny and calorie D <EOR> Since moving Vegas tend avoid tourist places but course when sister came visit she wanted venture all places didn't   agreed ended Serendipity   am always willing try new restaurant especially when frozen hot chocolates     When arrived fought line name waiting list late lunch   only wait 15 minutes before being seated   large groups all around actually surprised small location is   greeted pretty quickly server returned drinks   She took time over few popular menu items but excuse herself larger tables calling her   decided wanted eat wait few minutes before server returned order   But because sitting table beside window door able people watch     Considering amount people restaurant didn't wait very long food arrive   course ordered Ultimate BLT which looked mouth watering!!  sister some type chicken ciabatta sandwich   split sandwiches could try little both   admit thought BLT tasty little dry   sure if supposed come sauce but mine did not   still overall pleased size taste BLT   chicken sandwich did disappoint   Probably best sandwiches while   Nothing sandwich disappointing!!    We decided finish off meal frozen hot chocolate   could come Serendipity these??  definitely great treat end meal but over top taste built myself for     Overall probably visit again but expectations changed   Great location fun atmosphere friendly staff good food tasty desserts   Serendipity's would received 5 stars if tables little bigger prices lower if would threw some mayo honey mustard ultimate BLT  <EOR> Wish could leave less star  Some worst over priced food ever eaten  can't even good grilled cheese! <EOR> I didn't staple items frozen hot chocolate sundaes    If sized anything breakfast items plan share unless enormous appetite   Good hangover food breakfast if table   right 9 AM Saturday but wait 45 minutes time left  <EOR> Been few times  Food expensive but doesn't taste good  made wait long when seated place pretty dead  question is    why did wait long?  We Summer Bries open faced turkey sandwich cranberry mayo topped brie  must say though best food dish far    Also can't come without getting frozen hot chocolate which total sucker for   Poor experience but comes just frozen hot chocolate  <EOR> I'm even fan NY one   almost every NY serendipity ONLY ONCE reason  Besides always shutter due poor inspection grades nothing NY serendipity 2   Serendipity 2 small cramped dirty old loud     like    well just every Las Vegas version NY restaurants   HUGE big kitchy Serendipity museum   Took kid sis shopping Forum Shops   reuben she grilled cheese tomato soup   Both greasy just expensive greasy spoon food   also frozen hot chocolate strawberry shake   Both good most frozen sweet desserts   Our server sweet bubbly   Definitely but could probably throw hit kid's birthday party here   xx <EOR> Came dessert having dinner Central since didn't very appealing dessert menu     Shared strawberry sundae bf b c know big portions think server annoyed sitting section only ordering item which but still going tip well   But even he should rude towards guests any reason!  sundae delicious but overpriced    only come dessert b c food isn't great   more tourist attraction  <EOR> We Restaurant Week  price $20+ smoothie breakfast entree mini dessert  price food wasn't bad appropriately portioned  Service very slow because under staffed  Overall experience okay but happy give little charity! <EOR> Note review pretty much solely Serendipity's most famous item frozen hot chocolate drink   ordered through take out window strip   Overhyped overpriced   seen place various food travel shows years but frozen hot chocolate just isn't worth it   While most Las Vegas comically overpriced fits bill essentially chocolate milk shake costing ELEVEN DOLLARS   really any better really good milkshake somewhere else?  No not   Because ice cream pig Ben Jerry's shake earlier day don't judge overpriced $7 shake still better this   just plain nothing special   much Vegas hyped novelty little substance it  <EOR> just 11 25pm told restaurant closed! please change your hours say closing 11pm fri thru sunday because such lie! thanks making walk all way nothing! zero stars if really score place honestly! <EOR> Yes wait insane   Yes dessert yummy   But all worth it?  judge that   I think may able reservations place known prior just walking podium being told wait 30 45 minutes when only 4 30pm little unexpected   happened also unusually cold day May when seated balcony weren't happy   especially when direct path where wind blew strongest   spoke server called manager over moved against wall which helped tremendously   But seriously?  wish used little more common sense when saw 10 year old friend didn't jacket     The food itself decent but Vegas lot more places eat delicious food unless you're coming eat yourself some frrrrrrozen hot chocolate or case Oreo flavored one save yourself trouble time money   But definitely going least once  <EOR> MUST HAVE Mimosa   ok frozen hot chocolate again     disappointed big time   i think section did much better job  asked no whip but when came SLATHERED whipped cream  might give another chance but give if want try dont know if its worth though im sure much betters   then BF shared full monty   right when ordered waiter told fave thing menu    NO WAY   when came barely warm dry did taste good!!!   the mimosa pretty tasty     with all great food vegas   dont try serendipity despite its appealing decor!!! <EOR> Great large menu  Fun drinks  great stop when just want munch drink!

Granted served plastic Caesars Palace cup instead fancy sundae glass half size but whatever still just delicious totally worth $11  <EOR> Did live expectations all  Skip find better dessert stop  ordered 2 frozen Hot Chocolates they're known for cookies cream shake    bill came $45   Hot chocolates tasted watered down powder packets blended ice chunks    still big chunks when them   milk shake didn't taste creamy all   Pretty bad experience IMO  <EOR> Serendipity okay  great lunch homies  ate outside patio pretty cool especially time weather awesome! Service less mediocre  food filling  feel place check least once while Vegas especially if haven't here  didn't try specialized deserts because full meal  Next time come definitely try it  <EOR> This first time going heard great reviews  seated right away which nice because kind busy  took awhile service  Once did ordered frozen hot chocolate which die for  also ordered veggie burger meatball pizza  veggie burger completely fell apart bland taste meatball pizza ok but hardly any meat it  waiter never refilled water he hardly came table  even saw two groups people walk because lack service  All together experience but wish repeat  however going To Go counter more frozen hot chocolate tomorrow! <EOR> one favorites Vegas   Frozen Hot Chocolate must Blueberry Peach Mojito it real blueberries!!!

Think old school soda shop very bright pink orange seats   seats comfortable environment very fun   Before could even snuggle into seats server big smile face welcoming attitude   He took drink orders enthusiasm long afterwards front us   menu expansive many different food options   did know history restaurant just ordered sounded good us   We ordered Asian Chicken Salad start with   split kitchen without even asking that   two halves came beautifully plated tasted even better mouth   chicken moist dry chick pet peeve mine flavorful salad dressing delicious   Even though shared salad could satisfied half   But being need try other flavors also ordered entrees   smart ordered appetizer meal Wagyu Beef Sliders   made adjustment replaced American cheese Blue Cheese   delicious juicy again much finish   Hubby ordered Only Las Vegas Strip Steak Sandwich   plate came couldn't stop laughing   needed 3 people just eat sandwich   FULL steak eggs just mouth watering ingredients   predicted he couldn't finish but he wants back any starters he really dent sandwich   We did any room desserts back give them another just sweets     ***Here's trick all you   If want sit Strip side mind sitting bar   directly back bar take seat   first come first serve wait seated   same menu bartenders awesome <EOR> I've food few times memorable  Usually split longish hot dogs arent bad but they're great  wait during summer ridonkulous but fun experience frozen hot chocolate  decadent say least  really does taste frozen hot chocolate  moron waited several times just sit inside sip BF but here's helpful hint WINDOW!! large bigger large serve inside b c container huuuge    four people ok 4 small girls would hard time finishing same price minus 45 min 1 hour wait  <EOR> There nothing Frrrozen Hot Chocolate can't cure! NOTHING!!!  My weekend Vegas all blur  Well everything except glorious dessert  if Frrrozen Hot Chocolate all could remember then know vacation huge success!! <EOR> I see why place gets only 3 stars ambience isn't greatest  Middle morning inside everything tinted pink reflects color scheme   But gotta say if want splurge crab cakes ala benedict then you're going LOVE them   $38 smackers good thing won little something craps table!  girlfriend french toast all gotta say no matter order better freaking hungry because skimp portions    Wanted sit outdoors but bit noisy right along street but more importantly even 9 45 am didn't heaters fully running case didn't realize Vegas time year December bloody FREEZING 29 35 degrees F which could stand many things! Service really attentive efficient   Would definitely again but wont' eat least 12 hours prior!!!    Enjoy peeps! <EOR> Not greatest place if your ballin budget  think place more known ice cream but passing saw take window menu everything sounded pretty good gave try  Upon receiving consuming food conclude place overpriced  food pretty poor quality poor tasting   charge every little thing too   ordered foot long hotdog all condiments knock freshness component asked if could just small side onions I didn't think much ask girl said sorry pay extra that   BUMMERS! hot dog way $10   also chili burger combo    $14  I its Vegas ripping tourists off ok but least rip off better tasting food  Plus wanted just cup water lady said no water she would charge bottle water   Yikes! Probably would come back again  <EOR> Soured experience having wait 25 minutes being seated waiter take order only asked bus boy table next Manager   took another 10 min   Manager apologized brought waiter although then felt disillusioned place wanting visit kids Vegas rocky start  Ben Manager great checked several times evening  Waiter seemed extra nice probably because he be  Food deserts good but again just disappointed being ignored  experience brand leave bad taste your mouth no matter good food that  <EOR> Two words Eggs Benedict   little bit twist traditional dish whatever well   also chorizo quiche very good well   husband tried banana creme pancakes huge  he loved it   frozen hot chocolate delicious!  The wait restaurant long there's also take out window well half menu   Sit bar if open service much faster wait shorter times  <EOR> Really?  it?  I heard place forever no idea restaurant Vegas  course moment saw across hotel dead set it  Frozen Hot Chocolate? Hot Chocolate way high list vices obsessions way over due being summer    I made point grab despite being super busy didn't even bother look menu anything else mean signature your signature reason  ordered take window no wait whipped right away   And did whip up? tastes powdered hot chocolate mix ice milk? thing  whipped cream good some good white chocolate shavings top but it  figured when ordered would sweet finish even though small right  think big thing wasn't worth finishing    My friend took sip said gross but made half way through  ok? Yeah  Would pay $10 again? No way  If someone gave wanted chocolate would probably drink though  Oh snap  bad review   The only reason gets 2 stars hold hope normal food menu better  <EOR> I've couple times   menu pretty basic   pizzas burgers hot dogs etc   Prices steep get   first time came Foot Long Chili Cheese Hot Dog which pretty good   second time around Macaroni Cheese which okay   Desserts specialize in   Both times around Deep Fried Oreos Ice Cream Sundae   deep fried oreos delicious well cookies n cream ice cream   If trying eat healthy should definitely eat here! <EOR> I walk if staying Caesar's Palace because really frozen hot chocolate  die but good especially hot day Vegas   I place gives special treatment when use diamond card   I skip average 1hr+ wait time give VIP sign table bring chocolate covered cheesecake house waiting order  Other mostly over rated over priced food no big deal yes agree $11 high price cup chocolate icee   But admit pay price because actually cheesy pink atmosphere really chocolate special treatment given diamond card members  P <EOR> My past recent visits Vegas dined place because friends hella it  I beg differ    mean I'd rather freakin buffet mannnn!!

By way love bloody marys wanted because hung over   But really gross much salt!  see why people if trying first time would stay away drink! <EOR> I visited Serendipity back February  general would say food good but fabulous  menu overwhelming choices  Turkey club sweet potato fries  decent but probably should just ordered Sundae desserts looked great  service very slow  place very loud would say cheap get  atmosphere nice but probably better geared kids  bathroom also 5 minutes away dining room  OK am exaggerating but outside restaurant bit hassle there  All all experience just OK  <EOR> I think there's lot hype around place might reason why only though meh  pizza friend pot pie both mediocre nothing really special  dessert Frozen Hot Chocolate  something try since specialty but probably would never again  good but big enough couple sips  <EOR> For mediocre joint Strip prices ridiculous  If prefer stay Strip much better choices  <EOR> Overhyped  Frozen hot chocolate big let down  bad just wasnt amazing people seem be  Food ehh   had las vegas dog  If costco dog put nacho cheese jalapenos am pm   that would ur las vegas dog  mac n cheese lacked flavor   real curious frozen hot chocolate which comparable sugary chocolate milk blended ice   probably wouldnt back anymore  expensive quality food get  <EOR> Great service  Fun atmosphere  Amazing food when just want pig out  only problem there's always 45 minute wait no matter day time if don't mind waiting Vegas must see <EOR> Came frozen hot chocolate   It definitely only one time thing   mean many times would want cocoa powder chocolate shake?

If close 11 00 don't want food until 11 00 then your closing time actual time stop seating serving Take special take window outside! <EOR> You should come enjoy atmosphere see hype all about  Order frozen hot chocolate you've experienced same Serendipity experience NY  Maybe quite since little shack  Mind frozen treat super sweet even though you'll most likely share another human being your'e bound finish only half leave bunch whipped cream behind   Their food so so   typical food you'd find TGIF any other place serves typical American bar food  Loaded potato skins $11? kidding? Extremely dry chicken dijon pizza $14? Don't even think it   you're better off buying frozen pizza sticking oven yourself    Like said people come experience gets 3 stars! There's just something 'cool' ambiance  ladies feel special! <EOR> I would give only two stars  If t weren't manager apologetic then would 1star    So couple friends seated immediately since reservations  fine  HEIDI waitress lemme say    sweetest thing all    someone 3 years helps train other waiters waitresses would love question skills  If someone asks suggestions specific plate u think would try figure kind taste ur lookin some kind suggestions  But comment the hangover omelet popular really didn't help decide dish  since popular the  Y try it  should stuck first choice ordered corned beef hash  Don't think could ever messed up  Other getting burnt potatoes    You think paying 15 omelet would spectacular  But wasn't  satisfied craving nations hotdog    Well worth $12  don't think would ever eat again  Maybe try New York  Service may lot more better there  Over good experience but worse service possible  Thanks leaving bad taste friends  <EOR> We didn't sit restaurant settled window  boys peanut butter frozen hot chocolate other Oreo frozen hot chocolate  tried each just ok  Last time town ate restaurant almond amazing  bummed time    Kids ate burger corn dog  ate bite but unimpressed   husband salad Only half full barely any chicken all       This carry meal rip off nothing very good  <EOR> we stopped dinner everyone ordered something different could all try am HUGE fan just Hot Fudge Sundae let say licked bowl plate far best Hot Fudge ever had!!! wish Huntington Beach Cali <EOR> i may huge dessert lover burger joint junky     But try at least hundred times Serendipity's frozen ice cream shake esp strawberry  OOOOOh your tongue thank you!  would 3 5 stars but hour wait   you serious? Host aren't friendly either   perhaps 105 degree weather   perhaps! <EOR> Oliver server he very sweet! give 5 stars! food okay  steak ordered medium came well done  tasted fine just ordered  friend accidentally spilled coffee herself grab napkin  asked another server rudely said minute  Then took very long time just watching her  Finely she handed rag without saying anything  understand your busy but still polite  All all may back try again <EOR> Average  selling point Frozen Hot Chocolate which looked way big waste calories drinking down essentially seems chocolate milkshake me   while looked appealing 8 30 pm night friends just looking dinner point     There absolutely no space night Sunday night suggested ordered outside stand   therefore proceeded time sold NOTHING   no hotdogs no sandwiches no salads no anything   Anything asked menu said don't    Finally frustrated ordered bbq chicken pizza some nachos   Everything just average   pizza actually way much bbq sauce bit overbearing crust way doughy   nachos just drizzled cheese whiz something could totally made myself     I'm now looking real restaurant menu appears though may more variety inside shop   Maybe I'd give another try next time Vegas but likely lots other good things eat Vegas     The restaurant itself looked pretty cute   lots Hello Kitty  <EOR> Loved it!  same style New York only more Vegas  food eh but cares food when there?  Its all Frozen Hot Chocolate 2 mine fan freakin tastc!    Love it  Always love it  <EOR> Save your $$$$!!!  We came past Sunday night famous Frozen Hot Chocolate   If don't know just Chocolate Milkshake    without ice cream   waited line 10 minutes just place order   Here's why   there girl taking orders    and SAME girl making drinks!  Now placing order apparently workers inside saw huge line building outside take out window extra person decided help out   Funny because through pick window could hear talking $hit girl the taking orders another co worker!  all $hit talking drink ready   $15 for double EXTREMELY overpriced!!  mean EXTREMELY!!!  100% sure but pretty sure isn't supposed ice chunks it   basically chewing drink   WTF??!?!  If you're looking frozen drink I'd suggest going Starbucks getting Frappacino    or better yet Coffee Bean blended drinks   Granted more expensive your local SB CB but it'll still cheaper faster more importantly TASTIER!  Avoid place!  If really want try I'd suggest stopping locations NYC  <EOR> Arrived late into Vegas Friday decided eat Serendipity  no wait around 11 PM but took awhile waters table well placing order  ordered cheeseburger fries safe choice end but craving fries   alot food much could order dessert love dessert! bit pricey side Cheesecake Factory Drake's fave     My other friend ordered breakfast combo came pancakes bacon sausage potatoes toast  huge! He didn't even finish it    Tip Outside restaurant there's bunch Pokestops nearby! <EOR> Alright talk extremely good luck perfect timing week before came Las Vegas Serendipity's actually New York where Serendipity's Famous Frozen Hot Chocolate very first time see review   Even though wait excruciatingly long NYC frozen hot chocolate more made it   Fast forward week later Vegas sister's 21st birthday  excited learn Serendipity's location especially since much closer New York   Located along strip stand alone building right outside Cesars wait only 20 minutes   seated outside patio area which would've nicer if tall shrubs didn't block view strip   suppose 'barrier shrubs' put place because loud noise along strip very close proximity people walking down strip  menu bit expensive regular fare food $10 appetizers $15 hot dogs burgers etc  However size food items pretty gigantic sister split burger waffle fries which ended being fine    except course sharing charge! ABC burger which included Avocado Brie Caramalized onions  pretty good pretty filling   waffle fries well cooked although little overboard seasoning   Onto frozen hot chocolate UGH  taking first sip replayed possible scene head throwing tantrum 2 year old front everyone present whining same NYC!  blended beyond belief into liquid mess without frothy icy texture! also waaaaaaay sweet   want another arms folded sour face big pout ! But course only dream   I'd actually come back try some other foods salads sandwiches pizzas but I'd pass frozen hot chocolate  also sundae called Golden Opulence  No other description except its price $1 000  sheer curiosity if cash I'd actually spend just see sundae cost much  Anyway suppose going original Serendipity's NYC just gave much expectation Sin City's Serendipity's  <EOR> Good food decent price portion size  No reservation needed but crowded  onion rings burgers pizza can't say no sunde  group enjoyed food all agreed best whole time town  also Battistas next Ballys  <EOR> Went desert only Serendipity 3 did disappoint    I walked thinking wanted cookies cream milkshake which did menu  However ice cream sundaes looked good reconsider choice    I ended ordering deep friend Oreo extravaganza which included cookies cream ice cream whip cream marshmelo sauce  server wisely advised order marshmello sauce side because way sweet any sort normal dose  deep friend Oreos awesome seemed breaded corn flakes  Seriously put OC Fair shame easy deep frying department    My girlfriend ordered Can't Say No sundae which included humble pie peanut butter graham cracker crust peanut butter ice cream coffee ice cream banana  freaking awesome humble pie stuff great    I must say decor bit weird  sort Alice Wonderland thing going including clock painted wall showed three o clock all times  suppose because Serendipity 3 but am such stickler time annoyed me  also signs wall old gas stations stuff  just didn't match didn't work  Maybe point all but if missed it    So place close five stars for desert anyway didn't order any other food but quite there  would back though  <EOR> 20 min wait lots tables available barely anybody labor day WTF???? Seems little but snobbish even though looks does   but strip did expect   anyhow   love frozen hot chocolate pretty much only thing place many strip    <EOR> I would describe mediocre best wont back  Service pretty slack food underwhelming  wayvu sliders rock hard little hockey pucks nowhere near worth $15 ask them  Snickers sundae good but only 4 fun size snickers kind rip off tons ice cream but something called snickers sundae expecting more snickers  Save your money Peppermill banana split instead!  We wont back serendipity! <EOR> This place definitely if sweet tooth! only came dessert  slice cake iced hot chocolate  Definitely love place! must back! <EOR> We loved place!  I seen few videos YouTube place whilst doing research trip Vegas  looking forward trying all delicious food did let down  ordered ABC burger disappointed find forgot avocado   let server know brought avocado side plate  would much preferred if she taken burger back put back ABC burger if she really wanted impress bring freshly made ABC burger would guaranteed 5 stars me    Overall great time  food good service nice ambiance cool too    I would gladly back maybe next time try to go window outside  <EOR> I think would if 4   but came hungry seemed waited forever    We amazing waiter  Full energy wonderful  did wait while food  full Monty delicious  Great French fries wonderful presentation    For frozen hot chocolate just ok  whipped cream very good though  glad experienced but probably come back  <EOR> First let say most reviews express complaints restaurant spot on  Although read reviews wanted try simply because desserts now wish would just picked them outside service meal elsewhere  Aside desserts to go only saving grace Serendipity location since literally LVBD    With being first review would given Serendipity 2 star rating own head until saw YELP 2 stars means just experienced better  fact matter YET EXPERIENCE WORSE    To start night date walked front check reservation  girls did seem understand reservation took minute explain them actually called ahead  then proceeded tell better waiting reservation actual table because would sooner  really showed didn't understand just letting them know there   Once seated waitress came promptly asked would drink  She brought drinks back right away thought night would turn quite well  prompt service set expectations high   For next ten minutes she would come every two minutes interrupt conversation say ready yet?  now? PEOPLE TALK WHILE DINNER SHOULD RUSHED   Even if sat right down looked right menu would take least twenty minutes fully look over menu because chaotic  Before heading restaurant please take glance menu website before going    The food came very bland mine overcooked burnt rather   date didn't seem meal much but then again most people don't openly complain first dates    Since food made both full rather quickly heard needed try desserts sure looked waitress could order she nowhere found  basically she couldn't wait take initial order then didn't want help all    Finally asking another waitress order dessert given first good piece meal all night  dessert selection rather large quite nice which why initially recommended take side store have    On Scale 1 5    Service 2 only because received drinks quickly Appetizers Entrees 1 Location 4 Organization Decor 1 Price 2 no problem paying good meal spending lot but even close good   Friendliness 1  Overall most important categories 1 just 1 book    My point simple never return full dining experience should never try it  <EOR> Another poor rating MUST submit  hearing rave reviews amazing dessert Serendipity3 decided check desserts only  First foremost establishment smelled feet vomit when walked in  aroma strong distinguishable between melted cheese burnt olive oil  Secondly frrrrozen hot chocolate melted core milkshake surely did taste hot chocolate  fact tasted Wendy's Frosty  Boo   sure wasn't anything special it  Third fried oreos daughter also wasn't anything special  coated looked Frosted Flakes   real?

Now pranking customers crap  real now? $15 chocolate cake cannot afford nice pink decorative paper bag rope handles?? Woooow   talk cheap business  Overall establishment shame  no wow factor visit  never return  sure  Albertson's serves better chocolate cake Wendy's definitely better frozen hot chocolate  Visitors stay away if don't want disappointed  <EOR> I super excited when found serendipity Vegas   always wanted try one    course just visit place    except wait long eat inside opt take window which very limited menu     So waiting line    btw already aggravated indecisive customer before me    sorry but if r going wait line 10 minutes    should know want time window decided order Vegas dog why not    Vegas love jalapeños course frozen hot chocolate     So hot dogs    love costco ones    now one    dunno    wasn't expected   some reason all cheese jalapeños top kinda whole thing really salty    I don't think stay enough frozen hot chocolate    RECOMMEND IT    if thing that!!!!

Next time am Vegas want try other frozen drink flavors! <EOR> Of course everyone loves frozen hot chocolate its typical rave it   Well being typical   shaky experience Pink's worried another national treasure being dragged through mud homogenizing beast Las Vegas    but pleasantly surprised!  Not only did honor original Upper East Side menu added some original Las Vegas treats well!  Of course frozen hot chocolate course delicious    taste took right back cramped upstairs original Serendipity 3!  The only thing made kind sad enormous dining room    don't wrong love seat many people comfortably    but there's still certain charm elbow elbow space original! <EOR> First time tried place 6 months ago amazing huge portions  visit couple days ago bit disappointed when serving brunch  didn't much menu Margerhit pizza spinach artichokes  disappointed!! Very delicious  just wished serving lunch already  <EOR> It's good but all great price YIKES!  probably menu else where but once while treat strip nice <EOR> Some say best onion rings strip live here  didn't try them but looked damn good a ring tower $11 place serves burgers sandwiches hot dogs lots novelty items shakes frozen hot chocolate  You'll pay food but hey Vegas  interior gives off kitschy 50's vibe server friendly kept fountain drink cups full  I'd bet good place visit few beers hamburgers help soak some alcohol! burgers served dry some odd reason ask condiments toppings  fries excellent battered crispy  if you're mood quick dining option good burgers head S3 near Ceasars Palace  There's outdoor seating area also quick order window take away food limited menu though   <EOR> If writing writing review based solely upon frozen hot chocolate then Serendipity 3 would easily slam dunk 5 star  Most seem agree cold chocolate delight tasty! actual restaurant another story though     I window where just order your frozen hot chocolate don't worry insane crowded ness restaurant  But when Vegas last month group girlfriends decided brave take longgggg wait  lucked 30 40 minute wait pretty short Serendipity standards   loud inside sitting 10 minutes waiting least drink order friend waiter let know no come table  When waiter finally did arrive another waiter swoops nowhere starts holding onto shoulders yikes! cheesily says ohhh guy gets nervous around beautiful ladies  he probably afraid then flashes weird smile  Yuck!

Also just note Serendipty 3 but your outside window menu lists items being more expensive Total Rewards members   If no told yet because think funny believe should keep there  <EOR> I just don't it   think place more nostalgia people NYC location?

Coffee delicious   Cons Waiter  Original coffee cup lipstick it Restaurant 1 2 empty weren't seating  10 minute wait  While understand why restaurant does seems they'd better prepared show Absinthe finishes just feet them  <EOR> Came lunch few friends   wait 20 minutes seated   seated noticed many empty tables around what's waiting time??    Their lunch dishes ok nothing special   Desserts pretty looking yummy   Service ok bad but also great   experience but don't expect great food service  <EOR> The thing try famous frozen hot chocolate never wrong classics <EOR> Way over priced  disappointment NY establishment  tasteless  don't understand why always crowded here  <EOR> I really never even considered eating but group eating chose because able accommodate table 30  actually impressive since Friday night fight weekend    I ordered hangover omelet  made bacon fries mushrooms  substituted ham mushrooms  hate mushrooms  food rather bland  quickly asked hot sauce  Even Cholula could save it  bad  just liked any significant flavor  portion significant comes your choice fries  chose waffle fries  OK    Our service good expected group size  all friendly did best keep up   reason getting three stars instead two   They would divide bill all  Only bill per table  giant pain  took forever work through bill over 30 people  hate all excuses restaurants use justify dividing bills  service industry  Figure out  <EOR> Not worth money  Garden pizza good but Alfredo pasta disappointing  Service biggest bummer  waiter polite but he busy probably because understaffed  Even though 30% restaurant looked empty asked wait around 30 mins  wait everything else waiter food etc  <EOR> where start     1   WAIT  2   Frozen Hot Chocolate  3   Service 4   MENU   The Wait group walked T I      little b!tchy wait LOL 45 min wait seat 4 FrozenHotChocolate weeks before trip mouth already watering just thought then finally     bit disappointed nothing special it!  totally home  Service friend ordered beer just couple minutes ordered dessert     dessert finished water sipped cigarrettes smoked     STILL NO BEER!   Menu want try Sundae deep fried oreos chili cheese curly fries P teehee  I gave 4 because Serendipity!

And then remember things such fried ice cream world well insane level heat Vegas dessert all preconceived notions away   Alas Serendipity helped combat drunken state some very tasty desserts   actual restaurant inside looks far expensive but express booth outside just fine   Clearly most popular item frozen hot chocolates which mostly iced chocolate smoothie soothe your dehydrated self   It'll set back $10 but I'd say worth it!  chocolate goodness drink definitely cools down least long enough head into air conditioned casinos   Don't forget also order side fries   Ice cream well frozen desserts such can't hate til you've tried it   The only gripe Serendipity's express lane also another contradiction    wait LONG!  You're looking 30 minute wait before getting your order even when line seems short   Then you're expected wait another 10 15 minutes before actual drink comes out   bit ridiculous if ask me   But despite all sure sipping another again soon   Note next time grab some kahlua bailey's mix into drink   twice fun! <EOR> Honestly didn't expect place wow factor  Still same usual  least server friendly  person brought food jerk tho  He said anything else said oh side potatoes he said wasn't ticket said well u ask server then  Honestly he could done oh ok sorry let double check that  Pffffff said before if u hate ur job then quit  Work somewhere else  Anyways full average satisfied  Still wow factor  Just another place eat  <EOR> Just dessert!

I knew coming place all ice cream wanted something huge ridiculous  But soon sat down table next ordered largest most beautiful plate nachos  ended ordering those well  plate nachos Deep Fried Snickers Sundae    The nachos two kinds meat chicken side beef other  getting two dishes completely different flavors one  kept going back forth between them because couldn't possibly decide which liked better!  When sundae arrived its huge goblet sitting plate due all over flowing really fill thing your money's worth! waiter warned sundae melts faster any other due hot fried Snickers  But didn't bother me! love ice cream super melty  dug took time  I'd swapped scoop vanilla scoop Oreo  probably should've done same chocolate too  There's much hot fudge thing having chocolate ice cream just doesn't sense hot fudge Oreo would've perfect! only minor disappointment dish surprisingly hard Snickers were  looking forward them being hot melty fryer  But guess might freeze them beforehand avoid mess?  I didn't visit place NY years because thought all hype  Also because all people talk Frozen Hot Chocolate which just doesn't sound amazing sundaes  But now completely totally love! cannot wait return again try another gigantic ice cream creation! Deep Fried Oreo Sunday?! maybe Carrot Cake Sundae?! could wrong?!? <EOR> The chicken fingers amazing!! course frozen hot chocolate beyond amazing!

Fuck place! Avoid all costs!! <EOR> I think place hype   frozen chocolate delicious but tasted exactly is   waited over 45 minutes burger breaded chicken   didn't try sundaes but looked very big   decor inside cute   spent almost $50 lunch   Money would better spent buffet   Overall just ok but different  <EOR> Fattymax recommended try place she heard New York   decided give shot see fuss about   frozen hot chocolate seemed everyone but unfortunately wanted try something different ended getting Buffalo Chicken Pizza Crab Artichoke Dip Carrot Cake Sundae topped off pint Sierra Nevada   service good but prices steep   food came relatively quickly which kind second thoughts but hungry welcomed   pizza pretty big containing 5 huge slices enough 2 people but see single hungry person devour it   buffalo sauce pretty spicy added blue cheese definitely must   crab artichoke dip tangy but big portion   Lastly sundae   I say more bargained for   huge piece carrot cake top vanilla ice cream topped frosting   large time ice cream portion already melted which bummer    felt price paid $56 would want smaller portions enjoy dish rather trying race through before ice cream melted   frozen ice chocolate but find better food better pricing strip  <EOR> I really excited come long time finally conned friends into joining me  Score! Actually wasn't hard all mention frozen hot chocolate   It January 1st needed hangover cure  told wait 45 minutes but since freezing noticed everyone's great looking food stayed  Other hostesses barking people doorway huge crowd no waiting area nowhere people really stand wait didn't take long all seated 20 minutes    The cute decor made feel pretty trendy NYC cafe  never visited NYC location but Las Vegas' all out glamorous decor seemed good answer it  Feeling particularly lard asses ordered mac cheese chili cheese dog sandwiches turkey brie apple slices  2 frozen hot chocolates share course  waiter cool upbeat even switched tables when he heard joking wasn't level    I've met very few mac cheeses didn't but off charts  came deep dish rich sauce prosciutto chunks  perfect cold hungover day  friend's chili cheese dog ridiculously long she only halfway through other friends' open faced sandwich great well  hot chocolate decadently delicious but $10 so   I liked place huge menu both healthy comfort food cocktail list great waitstaff cute decor  disliked hostesses thought ish working such cool place expensive prices way bathrooms outside restaurant  food great but prices still seemed overinflated if paying image novelty  Glad try though! <EOR> Crappy service  Average food  Don't waiste your time money <EOR> Very pretty ambience great service     The food OK kind Sonic food but much higher priced   Our Sundaes yummy ginormous  5 split 2 leftovers available  <EOR> Food amazing! bit pricer most places but amount food its worth it! Servings more enough 2! highyl recommend Grilled Cheese Tomatoe Basil soup!!! place usually crowded but didnt wait more 10 minutes table 6! Staff helpful making selections! cant wait back! <EOR> This place tourist trap! Consequently find myself coming time time   I would skip dining in  many more places eat Vegas! Pesto Pizza just mediocre  You'll pretty much paying $15 $16 extra flat piece bread bland toppings   3 stars Frozen Hot Chocolate Deep Fried Oreo Sundae any ice cream matter  place excellent getting your ice cream fix  corn flake batter oreos nice touch! All sundaes perfect sharing because everything super sweet seems physically impossible finish alone   If coming dessert probably best order outside because lines much shorter faster  con during winter extremely cold outside forced eat your ice cream under heated tables which melt faster  also told order sit indoors dine in order something more dessert  Since space pretty small understand why would rule but also more inconvenience  <EOR> good food good desserts  sucks close 11 although seating people 1030 felt very rushed order desserts due kitchen closing although know  just sucks didn't even main food already order desserts  <EOR> I really excited finally try Serendipity  heard lot wasn't able stop while NYC super excited when found Las Vegas    If sweet tooth ready ride lifetime  came Sunday brunch many options something satisfy everyone's craving  am more into savory brunch while friends looking something more sweet other looking healthy option  all very pleased service quality food presentation options ambiance    The portions large very shareable  Service quick pleasant  chose sit patio people watch but inside restaurant adorable very colorful    Don't forget leave room dessert frozen hot chocolate MUST  I ordered enjoyed French toast chicken fingers fruit platter yogurt granola sliders chicken salad eggs Benedict breakfast bagel   I definitely check back next time vegas  <EOR> Chicken wings fried dry crispy   Sweet potato waffle fries bit drab  However server Sergio very attentive  <EOR> From remember red velvet sundae BOMBBBBB!

I ordered because eating inside restaurant would take long group only came dessert  ordered infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate $11 didnt even know kind dessert existed  Haha thought hot chocolate   be frozen? chocolate flavored smoothie goood  fool split friend but could easily all myself  sweet chocolatey absolutely heavenly it!!  **TIPS** 1 Avoid wait just frozen hot chocolate go  order side sit outside  beautiful view strip  2 Enjoy! <EOR> First send back water tasted straight dirty tap water black floaters it  Next send back salad came black hair it  Last frozen hot chocolate step below store bought cocoa mix cheap tasting whip cream  Definitely impressed clean food much ask for? <EOR> FAIL! lines long took forever order  top off corndog frozen inside! No bueno!!   The frozen hot chocolate ok but nothing special  <EOR> We sat hour past reservation   Took over hour finally food children just miserable Most frozen hot chocolate watery mess  server impossible service from   heard good stuff place but say much hype very overpriced given! <EOR> I think many hype overshadowed actually tasted like  decided window instead waiting even though open tables when but 25 minute wait    uhhhh okay? 32oz frozzen hot chocolate 14 bucks  Yeah  bit pricey side! certainly delicious but obviously splurge     overpriced hot dog because probably only thing cheapest  least bun toasted  Eh  I'd rather hot dog soda Costco  least better tasting save myself 4 bucks! Oh another thing charge dollar water which isn't much cup  better off pretending gamble getting free bottle water Caesar's Palace!   So essence cuz need quick bite can't wait to window   But worth price  <EOR> Just impressed  Very overpriced  Slow service  super attentive  Food average  Drinks nothing good  Didn't even think put any alcohol it! wouldn't suggest doing meal  Maybe you'll better luck desserts ? don't recommend wasting your time though  <EOR> This place SUCKS! live Las Vegas used few times year celebrate special occasions  Valentines day terrible  Well decided give them more chance yesterday still SUCKS    From waiter being unorganized waiting 20 minutes your drinks getting dirty dishes yes dirty side plates which ask for service below par  am sure happened place but something change   I remember place being busy well anymore Friday night pretty dead  am disappointed place sadly coming back  <EOR> Bad service! Waited over hour all ordered desert  Ruined friends bday! over ten people only brought six plates  first didn't even bring plates  hungry started eat food bags manager swiftly ran yelled us  But still no desert! No bueno no plates no desert still waiting check  Ordered $93 treasure chest desert mushy good  Would never come again!! <EOR> I wish could rate place higher because just damn cute but unfortunately isn't much besides frozen hot chocolate least dessert wise  haven't food but very compelled overpriced burger just because umbrellas pink  Although guess  pretty enticing    You find coupons frozen hot chocolate everywhere  first coupon book Paris  full size easily shared between 3 people quite satisfying when your sweet tooth aching hah pun intended something chocolatey covered unhealthy amounts whipped cream  tried ice cream though seriously couldn't finish them because kind over it  wanted light sorbet hot weather during summer  Nope super thick mango    thing  think mango+tons sugar liking  other flavors taste typical grocery ice cream nothing special either  really worth line but should just once    pink umbrellas <EOR> I pretty underwhelmed Serendipity 3  recent trip Las Vegas group girls trying decide place dinner  girls recommended Serendipity being all somewhat drunk hungry agreed  Well showed since weather nice outside elected sit patio right next 'The Strip' great view all lights passer bys  Unfortunately allure sitting patio stopped view  start almost if put patio proceeded completely forget put there  When seated told someone would shortly take drink orders    guess didn't know thirsty buzz kill being because waiter didn't come 15 minutes    Aside gripe slow service patio fact half hour into dinner literally kid wind storm erupted  bad fact friends 7 p m  flight into Vegas flight grounded delayed until following morning due wind  silverware blowing off tables napkins flying tried flag down waiter moved inside  response received was If want move inside then going put your name waiting list wait table open inside  current wait hour  Ummm    what?! drinks hand appetizers table you're telling would put name waiting list? accommodating!

Definitely worth experience but hope won't wait long next time  only flaw waiting glass water  ask 3 people wait unusually long time it  tempted helping myself staff station but decided better not  give Serendipity 3if paying $12 drink water should magically appear when asked  <EOR> There's lot hype but worth it  food good but mind blowing price wait    The hangover omelet no flavor over cooked luke warm    The grilled cheese probably good but mess grilled cheese? Oh having soup ready same time  also came luke warmer best    Their hot dog    hot dog    But bigger   all    There's lot hype frozen hot chocolate    looks great picture    But melted chocolate ice cream    I gave extra star because service wasn't terrible waiter tried nice clearly unhappy  <EOR> Service getting worse worse each time come here  food always brought back but probably hold true much longer  much wait even acknowledged server  <EOR> Food amazing service great  Highly recommend frozen hot chocolate nachos <EOR> My wife enjoyed New York wanted try one  wait only 20 minutes wasn't bad  two young boys asked if booth but hostess said she didn't server  But right she sat she sat three parties into booths  WTF!? server serving also serving booths   Our food order came two parties behind us  wife ordered Chinese chicken salad kids sliders  food blah  probably come back  <EOR> So years seen sandwich bacon eggs steak all over facebook finally chance couple weeks ago   gigantic tasted pretty good   came sweet potato fries those pretty good too   know probably isn't best place eat vegas all buffets but does trick   isn't expensive restaurant itself reminds restaurant would find disneyland way decorated haha   Also frozen hot chocolate exactly sounds   hot chocolate cold whipped cream top   so good!  could some right now   too bad nowhere near vegas   Anyways highly recommend place should try least once! <EOR> I wanted burger bad heard good things place  Unfortunately weekend brunch menu only burgery breakfast burger  presentation great burger good but little plain  husband hangover omlet really liked it  would come again sat outside great view people walking strip people watching always fun  <EOR> Always million hour wait dinner time later gummy ice cream  Everything LOOKS fab but meh  If ever through horrific breakup need punish myself food cookie sundae cry it  <EOR> Super pricey  But  Vegas Strip ya  Mother's Day brunch  Glad took rsvp  Decent corned beef hash potatoes but nothing write home about  Hubby liked huevos rancheros  guess giant desserts w a ton straws all share why people come  <EOR> I would tug anyone's arm if told going dine here   place awful   Terrible service   Long wait even reservations   wait 25 minutes drink bar   Finally when bartender failed left   expressed distaste Host then proceeded seat us   second attempt ordering drink server failed   Apparently sign front saying Expect 20 minute wait diet coke burnt out   left 40 minutes 8 00 reservation still no apologizes drinks   Very disappointed     The dessert menu different looked great however   But food nothing noteable   very overpriced sandwich burger nacho type food approx $20 plate     Save your money   your time   don't test your patience place   many more better places LV  <EOR> My aunt recommended check Serendipity 3 while Vegas  sister shared chicken waffles frozen hot chocolate delicious!! dont know if honey mustard dressing home made but its bit tangy    If you're gonna friends suggest coming early lunch rush    Service good server sweet plus side shes bay area!!

The hype frozen hot chocolate did disappoint although would appreciated price delectable drink little bit cheaper  $11 dollars without toppings single serving easily could shared between 2 people just fyi!   first night tried regular frozen hot chocolate 2nd night tried white chocolate frozen hot chocolate  BOTH yummy! shaved chocolate inside drink great touch provided nice texture drink! Albeit drink basically cold chocolate milk    still tasted amazing!  The mac cheese DELICIOUS  Portions larger side which great it better because tht some $14 mac cheese!   tried crab artichoke dip which tastes yummy too!! hint spice it! Wasn't really big fan ABC Avocado Brie Caramlized Onion burger  taste okay but really put off burger tall almost impossible eat! Well possible if wanted messy!  Get early because seating could tricky! if Vegas during winter did I'd opt stay inside because freezing outside  Although did those space heaters still would cold    I'd say give try if few bucks spend <EOR> Terrible service average food ridiculous $25 person minimum order  does that?!? party 14 waited over hour food come out  all wonderful food Vegas skip place  <EOR> I frozen hot chocolate ! think tasty but wouldn't come back again  think good try only once   <EOR> Went 5 10 09 which Sunday around 3 30 3 45 pm super late lunch   Came walking day before but saw delicious add local magazines   drawn strange thing called Frozen Hot Chocolate hot dog pretzel bun hamburgers!

Once arrived girl front desk said 20 minute wait waited over hour felt going overpriced food   ordered Hangover Omelet no bacon sub avocado   friend happy did substitutions here   gone another café Aria willing accommodate customer's needs but another review   soon omelet came blown away size head super yummy!  admit really wanted try sundae but since couldn't even finish meals didn't end happening   Next time <EOR> I grab window   1 star service 2 5 food   They don't serve hot food before 11 30am cashier kind rushy impolite didn't let order nachos  even though 11 25am   She didn't even register all items wanted order   Food The donut big Ok  The frozen hot chocolate meh   Not bad if there's nothing else around but really worth $17   I'll probably avoid place future  <EOR> Best hot chocolate ever highly recommend place food very good well! <EOR> Delicious mac cheese! extraordinarily amazing mac cheese  Yes prices little much but you're Las Vegas known restaurant  knowing you're going spend money  proportions huge definitely having leftovers does more sense  price  also tried chicken waffles delicious again  wish could tried more but said much food  Next time try famed frozen hot chocolate before eat sure there's room  <EOR> Came brunch JT when Bouchon informed would 45 minute wait he decided he extremely hungry and slightly hung over   shared chopped chicken salad standard but hearts palm good short rib pot pie decadent 11am but still good     course order frozen hot chocolate I NY but JT never tried it   refreshing 95 degree weather esp since hit pool right   portion ginormous especially other generous sized items   Service decent but still quite early people Vegas though almost noon  sat outside shaded area open doors A C blowing wasn't hot  $1000 ice cream sundae menu gold flakes  always intrigued but don't think I'd ever ever able spend much sundae! Love giant hot chocolate statues outside too  <EOR> If you're looking spectacular meal place you  However dessert amazing worth experience  menu items excluding dessert hit miss but dessert never disappoints  family few days ago ordered treasure chest dessert small feat but absolutely delicious great sharing large party  <EOR> It quite hype everyone try out   Place located front Ceasar's great outdoor seatings covered tent  plus    We line quite long line since only cashier taking orders  Everyone seems order frozen hot chocolate but decided try Frozen Oreo  Though quite expensive $12 large order friends just shared order    Surprisingly frozen oreo pretty good  <EOR> My boyfriend shared chicken waffles breakfast  waffle crispy ans waa chicken  would come back it  Only downside service which bit slow  Other pretty tasty   ** Came back regular frozen hot chocolate! Very refreshing hot heat  Yuuum  try other flavors well  <EOR> I wouldn't really recommend place    although restaurant looks really cute nice dine find better food elsewhere  find completely overpriced food wasn't worth all  group ordered mac cheese Margarita pizza salad  know those things pretty usual items but completely disappointed it  many add ons charges  which didn't mind but just sucked unworthy was  mac cheese added grilled chicken it  $25 dollars  thought fine because expecting something tasty but disappointed  bland literally 3 pieces DICED chicken  Take mind your paying $5 more should given more 3 pieces cubes  Anyways food mediocre  find better food better piece elsewhere   I'm giving place 3 star because server really good frozen mint hot chocolate pretty amazing  Super tasty no overly iced large portion  server attentive quick getting orders    I'll probably come back hot chocolates but food anymore  <EOR> There lot hype around place but really didn't find all exciting  party ordered oreo frozen hot chocolate blended ice some oreo flavoring  also tiffany 5 espresso drink but absolutely disgusting basically little cup espresso some chocolate shavings thrown haphazardly  last thing ordered lookie lookie give cookie ice cream sundae  Let tell may well called chunk cookie dough some whip cream top  If want some quality dessert here  Albeit true portion sizes generous quality food sub par  <EOR> It's time actually pin down review place because overdue long enough   as years ago  remember experience quite vividly because more memorable nights Vegas   That same year discovered original Serendipity 3 NYC sure wasn't head over heels crazy but any other trip always try compare contrast search exclusive items  Sadly nothing different  at least more affordable side  that reflected Las Vegas' charm  So actually took two tries finally something location didn't end ideal  first time closing around 11  I mean closes 11 PM Vegas?!   I finally try place New Year's Eve moments away closing through take out station outside  Strawberry Supreme fries both mediocre fries soggy almost inedible  looking forward drink because let's face it if paid $10 cup better very high expectations  bad  Real bad  overly sweet flavored it tasted cheap juice blended milk cream  whipped cream did help but give them some props least some effort festivity rainbow sprinkles  reading seeing shoud velvety red color  mine looked strawberry milkshake meaning cream added it  Still felt if rushed since very few cheaper quick food options bustling Strip night businesses skyrocketed  didn't help all eating drinking 30 degree weather outdoor seating  only gone back Serendipity 3 once since much fan drinks   Wow can't believe pulled back head nothing! <EOR> On Sunday morning husband around 11am  no wait all  many empty seats    Even through still morning knew try FRRROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE  drink definitely huge! would say drink hot chocolate favor ice blended  very tasty! both liked lot    Because ordered big drink only ordered dish  Eastside Western omelette  didn't much  filling fine but eggs rough fluffy  just didn't texture    I come back sure Frrrozen Hot Chocolate but any omelette  may try chicken wings waffle  saw people ordered plate  looked great    Anyway think drink worth try!!!! if don't want wait early!!!!! Don't forget check gifts! <EOR> I Serendipity 3 couple years ago but didn't chance review   really enjoyed service   very long line in   Once seated however food came quickly hot yummy!  waiter really fun cordial  <EOR> Me lady waited 35 minutes Saturday brunch   course expected around 12   wait long if sit bar way faster   I fried eggs benedict   dredge poached eggs corn meal fry them   cool idea but egg yolks runny   Instead muffin used biscuit hammed country gravy plate base while still topping hollandaise sauce   This thing very good but damned gut bomb   wished drunk before ate fulfill drunk munchies   The gf french toast log   comes bacon eggs seasoned potatoes fresh berried cream syrup   Freaking crap! weren't kidding when named log   thing basically small loaf bread crust cut off   assuming typical soak except soak crust outside corn flakes   corn flakes nice different texture soft spongy interior log   seasoned potatoes really good eggs much bacon unknown didn't any   would liked bread soaked little longer but then might put integrity log shape jeopardy   The frozen hot chocolate price worth which why didn't any   William Sonoma buy some packages yourself home   only assume good since two rude Texan couples sat next couple each side yelling over chat each other shit kicker convention enjoyed frozen hot cocolate  Three stars food surprisingly good slightly higher priced but except place this? <EOR> I know place known its Delicious Desserts but walking strip decided stop enjoy view few mixed drinks  Bloody Marys excellent but only wish drinks stiff prices  know location caters mostly tourist prices probably right range  $30 bucks 2 drinks view strip barstool tip over flash grouchy waiter doesn't pay attention your order  If drinks weren't good would never think twice going back  Caesars Palace always favorite Casinos Hotels but looks crammed every square foot lot outside variety bars kiosks eateries on  There's restroom middle all this which really back Serendipity all customers  Every time Caesars Palace under construction inside out  Over Serendipity cool place pay visit least once if your visiting  local next time Ill trying food! <EOR> I guess allure original New York experienced Upper East Side    felt made Vegas area ice cream shop  First off impossible access strip via car despite fact seen right streetside  However once inside wait your table some best original sundaes ever  just dessert family split frozen hot chocolate fried Oreo sundae  Both amazing however feel frozen hot chocolate supposed thicker was  Oh well    still delicious am still intrigued discover atmosphere original NY shoppe! <EOR> I wanting try place awhile  located own building front Caesar's Palace  option sit inside outside  kind busy when dinner but only wait 15 20mins table which wasn't bad   We ordered frozen hot chocolate 2 Alfredo pasta salmon Asian chicken salad  portions actually pretty big here  didn't finish pasta salad because pretty full already  thought pasta good but way much sauce  pasta broccoli practically drowning sauce  did give generous portion salmon though  also tried bf's salad  thought pretty good but he didn't because he doesn't taste bamboo shoots it    However both loved frozen hot chocolate! good! Definitely must try if come here   The next time come back think we'll just frozen hot chocolate  really want try other flavors now  <EOR> Never wait more then 20 30 min seat  don't discouraged if  place filled  wish booths more intimate setting but just ice cream joint  Hubby only ice cream dinner  food good but nothing special  little over priced but maybe because strip known movie  burger reuben sandwich chili cheese fries etc   elsewhere  thought to go outside ordering area pretty neat but never ordered there  always dined in  All saying can't ice cream dessert cause yummy but dinner wise worth it  learned share appetizer share ice cream! personally fried oreos!!! nom nom nom!!! never finish ice cream anyway  Maybe good share 3 people actually finish all   I guess everyone try Frozen Hot Chocolate once lifetime cause all hooplah  actually enjoy frozen hot chocolate but others say all great  see where they're coming that  HAHA   They 1k 2k ice cream gold flakes menu  personally wouldn't spend much damn ice cream  Would you? Even if funds it? <EOR> We've lived Vegas almost 15 years   Strip often but never ate Serendipity   No real reason noticed long lines restaurant many occasions   Monday 11 30 am lunch   made reservations reading Yelp reviews talking having frequently wait table   no time did incur rude service   Everybody friendly   used Strip prices weren't shocked $15 sandwiches   did come fries $1 more sweet potato fries     We starving   ordered Hawaiian pizza other people nearby them looked good   quite good didn't realize made BBQ sauce but plenty cheese crust very good     The wife chicken sandwich said very good   good sized   sweet potato fries probably best ever had   cooked long enough where crisp   Plus put cinnamon them   Rueben sandwich   corn beef exceptionally lean rye bread very good   wish would little more sauerkraut but minor     For dessert piece red velvet cake go   $14 way much taste   very good   did take little more half food home best carry out containers ever seen      We didn't frozen hot chocolate just because paying $11 seemed excess couldn't take   wish hadn't paid $4 upcharge four onion rings instead fries   rings heavily coated parmesan cheese   love onion rings but just didn't cut mustard     BOTTOM LINE food very good   wait person very friendly   Unfortunately can't hurry your food   wait person working hard but took extremely long time meal   follow wasn't great but terrible   Perhaps should consider having some food runners   food served good temperature just took forever   All desserts saw MASSIVE! <EOR> Try frozen hot chocolate said   No really    10 pages Yelp reviews which only two lines mention just treat  could hero pass up? Let's cut chase     It's $11   And really great   PROS Fairly good selection frozen treats  Kitschy interior  nice kids  also sprawling mist cooled outdoor patio too   CONS Let's real frozen hot chocolate basically chocolate slushie whipped cream  way expensive get  Tip stripper Vegas instead  <EOR> Worst service received Long time  Lousy kitchen management please check your cups fishies mine <EOR> This first time Serendipity 3 chain  food definitely exceeded expectations very large portions  honest I'd consider sharing much person opinion  little annoyed wait time even though 2PM reservation entered 1 58 seated 2 40   Regardless would definitely recommend come again   FOOD I ordered The Only Las Vegas Strip Steak Sandwich   Totally wasn't expecting big  expected steak burger but instead set long roll  Very nice presentation well  tasted delicious!

The food selection isn't insanely creative mostly fries burgers salads pancakes sort thing   decor serendipity fun eat food itself     Wouldn't say but all places vegas eat find something better easily  <EOR> Wow! place popular  Its always full people always line  yourself favor reservation   Frozen Hot Chocolate something your should definitely try if your first time here  Its everyone comes for  essentially hot chocolate frappacino  really liked first time tried it   The frozen hot chocolate only thing serve oh no actually very large menu other delectable goodies  server Karen mad cool told she tried everything menu least twice favorites 4 cheese mac cheese chicken japalenos added crab cake salad  could take advice someone tried gigantic menu more twice over?   4 Cheese Mac Cheese + chicken Japalenos WOW! Superbly well made Mac Cheese but adding chicken jalapenos send another level  dare say its best Mac Cheeses ever dish almost everywhere go   Crab Cake Salad Excellent hot crab cakes served mixed green salad  heat crab cakes slightly wilts greens very pleasing blend textures temperatures   Deep Fried Oreo Sundae What! Deep Fried Oreos! Sundae! Yes please! don't think really say any more since items themselves would pretty good  Put them together winner! Also another recommendation Karen  Haha she totally awesome!   Since menu much its tough say anything general but if don't think disappointed  <EOR> Ever since watched movie wanted try place  Frozen hot chocolate anyone?   Since wasn't able location New York figured would just Vegas  First time Christmas lunch myself sat bar since wait 30 minutes table   ordered myself frozen hot chocolate side sweet potato fries  frozen hot chocolate HUGE  size plenty table  bar great place eat if all your people over 21 seats there  frozen hot chocolate itself   The second time kids trip vegas 4 them between 16 18   reserved table all but able seated quite quickly  around 10 aren't many people restaurant  service though once seated little spotty  took while someone take order  and then food    The smores hot chocolate which girls looked good but forgot graham crackers didn't bring them until asked them  Also hot chocolate huge mound marshmallows if dont those don't it    My brother ended getting Oreo version frozen hot chocolate which tasted oreo hot chocolate but cold  second time ordered Forbidden Broadway Sundae chocolate blackout cake chocolate vanilla ice creams shit ton whipped cream   delicious but halfway full couldn't take another bite  cake wasn't bad but wasn't best ever had    Overall big portions  Decent desserts  Always reservation you'll fine  sit bar  Service spotty but you'll just deal it  <EOR> I ordered brownie sundae waited 20 minutes paying it   changing shifts but somehow proceeded hotdogs all toppings people ordered me   also tried ordering  large bottle water rang $8 which said no thanks   am NY work NYC never seen such outrageous price just water    All Walgreens Vegas selling same size water bottles $2 29   don't see why feel need rip people off when comes water ice cream already over priced just OK   picky all know Vegas expensive but hands down most dissappointing place there  <EOR> Let preface review telling weakness Kate Beckinsale 80s inspired sentiment John Cusack Serendipity 3 Caesars special place heart simply because its' relation original New York cafe movie same name    Sadly affinity ended there  Although think frozen hot chocolate tasty idea no way merits exorbitant price establishment demands  realize smack dab middle strip but if think fifteen dollar martini reasonable comparison then something straight ILL    To boot food great bowling alley fare best even stretch considering some good bar food eaten some local bowling alleys Did just undermine credibility there? Haha say? love ghetto fab grub much next gourmet meal! <EOR> Frozen hot chocolate really gross  tastes chocolate milkshake except pure sugar plus more sugar top  ate whipped cream top counter sugar high drink   Oh also costs $11  believe Oreo Frozen Chocolate sweeter regular Frozen Chocolate  Gross  <EOR> Disappointed expensive good  serendipity restaurant screwed name serendipity  NYC better this  <EOR> Not sure people raving about  place nothing special terribly overpriced  tried frozen hot chocolate drink waiting line 30 minutes  whole preparation process made cringe  bit using espresso machine frother prepare drink  whole take out section looked bit dirty milk cocoa spilling everywhere  No thanks  <EOR> My first only visit famous Serendipity New York City gave opportunity try thing only Frozen Hot Chocolate   fond memories delicious dessert drank all myself rainy cold day East Coast   With recent opening Serendipity 3 Las Vegas Boulevard whole new setting experience lovely decadent drink     Heading lunch weekday chose sit outside despite breeze   friendly spirited waiter patient took forever order   Lorna D  started off beverage choice Mochaccino Own Brew Rich Chocolate Aromatic Espresso Topsy Turvey Whipped Cream Peak *$5    yummy drink tasted more chocolaty espresso like   For lunch friend chose Breakfast Steak Sandwich NY Steak Sunny Side Eggs Smoked Pepper Bacon Cheddar Jack Cheeses $20 Sweet Potato Fries   Now does seem quite pricey but orders really meant split   Three large eggs laid sunny eyes bacon spilled sides     Lorna D  craving more breakfast item Central Park Casper Spinach Avocado Swiss Cheese $14 Coleslaw   six egg white omelet folded gently avocado slices top   definitely more enough food she liked coleslaw too   I High Heel Pump Prosciutto Buffalo Mozzarella Tomato Basil Pesto Balsamic Glaze $16 Sweet Potato Fries   Looking absolutely gorgeous open faced sandwich yearned shared   flavors prosciutto mozzarella tomato pesto glaze worked perfectly together   couldn't wait bring some home Husband taste!

Yum! decadent delicious still good remembered!  Perfect party two three share!  Service still friendly end but business picked took bit longer boxes things that   Overall Serendipity 3 does things right   Don't turned off high prices just plan sharing everything!  perfect ending date! <EOR> My first visit Serendipity 3 big disappointment     I Classic Hot Fudge Sundae walk window   best mediocre   There some sort shrine setup near back patio wafted incense smell heavy nauseous doses over area while eating   Ice cream incense good combination   Everything touched sticky   need send someone wet rag every once while   I might try again based all other reviewers good experiences  <EOR> This place cute!  12 year old daughter loved suggested would nice place birthday party!  colors decor cute music playing made feel club!    We Sunday driving back home   highly recommended made reservation glad did because seated right away!    We started signature frrrozen hot chocolate very good   ordered summer bries sandwich sweet potato fries delicious   daughter nachos   liked black beans came 3 cute little ice cream cups sour cream guacamole pico de gallo   cute touch   husband breakfast burger which good also   eggs runny taste but still good   breakfast potatos very good!  Beware!  food portions huge!  leftovers enough dinner night! <EOR> Went early dinner around 5 30p m  husband along some other guy friends   absolutely no waiting when there   food good well customer service   loved sweet potato fries    For dessert all Frozen Hot Chocolate different flavors very yummy   returning next vacation vegas October! <EOR> I don't what's all hype about     I brunch family  we waited hour   Our waitress super rude made wanna punch of course did not!   friend told try hot dog but didn't during brunch time  if want try hot dog just order express to go outside    I would want waste time waiting place again   <EOR> I always wanted try Serendipity 3 even if meant wait line hour  just wanted see all hype taste some yummy dessert    The service nice friendly  sure might little frustrating hosts tell people wait such long time  No problem us  waited bar next door killed some time consuming some beverages    The host also very polite  seated bf right next sunny window 110 degrees out  She tried help taking down shade making more cozy     We ordered steak sandwhich eggs chili dogs  food good but best  However couldn't complain  bf said orea shake perfect treat  He huge icecream buff really wanted try it    We would probably use pick window next time  heard great way your dessert quick manner  am definately glad tried but probably won't come back without reservation next time  <EOR> Service fast Frozen Hot Chocolate but large breakfast portions no room walked off latter ! Delicious <EOR> I really wanted place but didn't   If want overpay mediocre food service you've come right place    I'd only recommend coming dessert but if you're coming food shakes think again   In Burger's far away and better ! <EOR> 10 16 10  I'm being generous two stars   Only because foursquare check drink special   45+ minute wait frozen hot chocolate ?  still didn't seated?  Finally order demanded bride to be waltzed off dinner  <EOR> I think time enough me  Poor Service always does in  many other options Vegas why waste time here? <EOR> Had frrrozen hot chocolate 2 just ok  same thing home  Nick bad server  He didn't look happy serve us  Bad service  Don't come if want good service  Just Starbucks lol <EOR> It's definitely worth try fries ice creams but price very expensive sister frozen hot chocolate thought price fries hot chocolate two think 25  But beautiful spot if sit otherwise dark outside takeout <EOR> Management reorg needed ASAP! place would much better if someone worked actually took pride job  Over priced food just okay tasting  Ordered piece party your birthday cake dessert finger prints person cut then grabbed hand placed plate  should've read other reviews before wasting $75  table next sent back plate well all expected  Very disappointed  worked restaurant business most horrible restaurants due poor management    coming back again  <EOR> Just ok   Its basic place normal american food    salad pastas burgers etc   Good if don't know where appreciate your large chain restaurants     I'm crazy desserts    sweet without any excitement   However its great location if you're walking around strip its great place late night snack     I wouldn't way come but if nearby    its easy convenient  <EOR> I just moved California New York frequented Serendipity 3  When found Vegas excited  little piece NYC  even website sure favorite sandwich  Summer Brie  made trek  When told don't anymore despite having just looked online  very disappointing  Even worse then talk manger voice concerns he could really care less say  guess when name Vegas  all need  Oh humble pie  Nothing real thing  If looking piece NYC New York New York  much closer real thing  <EOR> We loved frozen hot chocolate  The regular much better mint version  Orchard salad great rest crew enjoyed food well  Busy location text when your table ready   Definitely worth stop! <EOR> 5 stars wedding reception 3 stars wedding anniversary year later   Our reception lot fun  picked menu advance giving people narrower choice items preset appetizers desserts  worked creating menu would keep friends  family happy some picky eaters able requests having two different appetizers all sauces side  Service good too  did little bit wait seated bummer cause reservation months  But once things efficiently done  food good! Especially loved steak sandwich Asian chicken salad  great time made wedding day even better   Er but didn't such great time when just husband anniversary  pretty ridiculous wait then seated inside where everything pepto pink noise level awful  food took while when did good but unimpresive  dessert something peanut butter   tasty but super rich couldn't even eat half it  didn't any serious complaints but weren't planning any trips back either  <EOR> A great alternative if haven't able visit original Serendipity NY  love cute decor inside! Though Frozen Hot Chocolate isn't exactly same Serendipity3 NY still pretty good! <EOR> Came try famous frozen hot chocolate ordered two portion  Toppings available flavors but classic   Absolutely delicious fun little stop  waitress   great fun this   They offer full menu both seated window where could something sit Ceasar's courtyard  Lots great desserts! <EOR> I agree everyone else should only come DESSERTS    Came brunch other day which until 2PM ordered LEO omelette   came side breakfast potatoes   omelette itself made whole eggs lox grilled onions   lox nice but something omelette itself interesting   spongey really appetizing over all   all hype place gets thought food would par   Sadly not   However breakfast potatoes pretty good     What place delicious frozen hot chocolate which signature    ordered amaretto almond flavor delicious   Nice chucks sweet almond slices top   A drink food presentation   Meh food itself    Oh wait seat long but sure NO LEAVE sign your name   wait half time tell you   Made mistake leaving roam Caesar's during 1 hour wait came back 30 40 minutes name called while ago  <EOR> So upset Serendipity 3 closed  Every time come Vegas there  Sometimes lunch just dessert drinks  Great atmosphere strip side patio  Awesome food  Don't started sundaes!! Very sad see go  <EOR> I came dessert Carrot Cake Sundae delicious! menu breakfast lunch dinner bit towards pricer side  probably would come anything other dessert  Aside rude lady seated all good  <EOR> One fav brunch places!!! Ohhhh if only lived Vegas!!  I see some people complained wait time but when around noon weekend place barely half full! plan early some best tasting looking brunch items! portions very reasonable if all ordered entrees but cmon! comes try desserts???!! They  Were  Delicious!!!   I definitely stop again next time Vegas! <EOR> First all place should New York New York the original hails NYC its decor def  pink compared original resto more romantic more aligned movie named    Anyway came just frozen hot chocolate I original ages ago wanted compare NYC's Serendipity's memory def  better  Nonetheless wasn't much line when which plus I remember when NYC's Serendipity waited maybe three hours??    Anyway come try famous frozen hot chocolate but would say skip food sure  Much better food strip  <EOR> Date Time Monday 4 30pm Occasion Dessert Party of Two Ordered Frozen hot chocolate two Location Cafeteria dessert bar fun youthful Total incl gratuity $17  I finally tasted it   what everyone's talking famous frozen hot chocolate   think bit hyped up   I expecting little more   extra large chocolate slush   good but die for   price thing pretty hefty $13 00 drink   Yoikes!  Nonetheless now say tried famous frozen hot chocolate Serendipity! <EOR> Great great food!  Potato appetizers speical unique kick extra added ingredient   Sundae amazing   Burger delicious   Mac cheesy awesome but cup oil bottom hard swallow!  As expected service little dingy    waited REALLY long time service initiated   when finally did really nice waitress made mistake having side shouting conversation another waitress across patio didn't last long though ???  know restaurants Strip always busy probably high turn over rate staff      but shouldn't certain etiquette kinda obvious?  Does ever cross mind may serving entire table fellow industry folk      better yet       food critics?!  I'd come again but I'd expect long wait <EOR> Biggest piece cake ever seen! roasted veggie sandwich good  tasted niece's frozen hot chocolate taste treat! wait bit long poor waiter tho GREAT bit overtaxed but all all something really OUGHT if you're anyway! But warned if want TALK someone you're with    LOUDER 70's Pimp Suit! <EOR> My fiancé came December 26th when Caesars Palace show  stopped off dinner beforehand  Overall experience would bring back   Pros *The location hard terms view price point  hear excellent NYE fireworks  see pretty much all south strip half seats restaurant   *The desserts look great would suggest coming treat instead dinner  Sweets seem forte   didn't try them but assumption looked good people around seemed enjoy them only reason 2 stars instead 1    *Decor cute fun especially kids    *They walk bar outside where order ice cream without dealing busy restaurant    Cons *Misleading website  reason chose restaurant because best both worlds fiancé me  He loves good spaghetti meatball love good burger  Caesars website says place specializes both but when arrived waitress kind laughed she said Oh no don't that  Don't look website! said if idiots researching place?   *Horribly inconsistent food  ended both getting burgers  Waitress asked we'd them cooked both said Medium  came burnt hell back mine practically raw  Let mention grew mother cooked rare everything enjoy rare burger  But rare  raw  spent rest trip hoping ate before noticing wouldn't sick   *Service very slow  took over 20 minutes waitress stop could drink refill continue eating  Forget trying replacement raw burger burnt burger  wouldn't worth wait  just dined fries which meh  *Petty con but menus unnecessarily huuuuuge comparison 2 seater tables  looked comical trying both read menu tiny table constantly hitting each other ourselves  Just seemed odd decision whosever part was  <EOR> Came lunch but because 1+ hour wait became late lunch  only party 2 myself boyfriend ! But things better when guided outdoor table friendly waitress which immediately took drink orders brought each glass water even when didn't ask  table outside right along strip quite nice view although still bit chilly even when some outdoor heaters wasn't quite warm enough   I know frozen hot chocolate signature thing but since tried before NY didn't really think special decided pass time  Instead ordered chocolate french toast boyfriend ordered Only Vegas Strip Sandwich  two separate menus brunch diner regular diner menu doesn't begin until 2PM if want more entree type food wait until then  It took awhile food arrive when came wasn't surprise portion plates  sandwich stretched miles french toast mountain high  Definitely cautious big portion plan share much plate gets boring  food good enjoyed french toast but much chocolate handle slice half  call quits packed rest which didn't even tried finish    Over all decent experience but can't really mind if worth long wait  fence but should try judge yourself  <EOR> Basically stopped Frozen Hot Chocolate go     With menu item could possibly pass up?    It delicious lived name     Buyer beware portion two enough four people costs more lunch does Boston  <EOR> kinda overpriced guess want trap tourists since its LVB right front Caesars only place NYC lunch because staying across street  had Sweet Potoatoe Fries Frrrozen Hot chocolate Shrimp Fettucini Chicken Nachos  It good but just dont think $50 price tag good 4 items place set look ice cream parlor <EOR> Serendipity 3 Caesars Palace probably restaurants most looking forward trying Las Vegas also most disappointing   asked sit outside along strip told 10 15 minute wait   ventured outside wait bar noticed least 5 tables no occupants which still people's used plates glasses leftover food sitting out   floor garbage underneath nearly every table dirt smudges all over black white checkered floor   decided wait inside which also clean   boyfriend made good point which if restaurant dirty did kitchen look like?  If I'd home would left but really wanted try Frrrozen hot chocolate!  We waited close 10 minutes then seated table outside   looked ours another table cleaned but no silverware settings   other 3 tables near still covered unwanted food remnants   table next trash service area two old chairs which cigarette burn all way through cushion   Charming   The Frrrozen hot chocolate billed blend 20 different kinds chocolate icy cocoa concoction  ordered regular size well three deep fried oreos   Oreos listed menu individually but server advised could order them $1 50 each   also asked waters which observed each table huge blue pink straws   long hot chocolate oreos arrived   Still no water no silverware   asked server water again   If see photo hot chocolate clearly sitting kitchen little while presented part drink melted plate below   well attended kitchen would sure switch plate before presenting $12 drink customer   Further see only half glass contains actual hot chocolate   rest filled whipped cream   The frrrozen hot chocolate tasty but did detect even hint being 20 different kinds chocolate find claim somewhat suspect   did take long finish chocolate part drink which disappointing given almost entire glass whipped cream remaining   oreos battered corn flakes which never seen before   prettiest presentation but tasty   finally water napkins close time finishing food   Surprisingly server told time oreos house     Overall would say skip Serendipity 3 your Las Vegas visit   clearly well managed its servers set succeed   saw group women another table complaining manager waiting over hour food   He didn't really seem care least vantage point   Gone Serendipity 3 may seen featured tv did which seemed show well kept high end dessert shop   No right mind would order famous $1 000 sundae containing real gold flakes establishment  <EOR> So lets chase Frozen hot chocolate! good but expensive  well luckily able watch Dbag angry bartender Jesse while took 30 minutes actual hot Chocolate also   12 oz cup = $10  3 heaping cups hot chocolate mix 2 scoops ice cup milk = home Serendipity your service slow friendly all dont even know why tipped bartender when he angry when asked where friends hot chococalte first 15 minutes waiting then waited 15 more minutes bar   GO MAX BRENNER!! inside forum shops shakes better service better won't hissy fit employee if your customer just asking where drink when just standing arround talking  <EOR> I tried Mac Cheese which best EVER had  waiter extremely rushed meal 3 people took while come  However seated patio overlooking strip which pretty awesome opinion  Even though really hot experience forgotten  loved Oreo Frrrrozen Hot Chocolate all shared! <EOR> Their Frozen Hot Chocolate disappointing  worth trouble money maybe rest menu better but probably won't come back again  <EOR> Luckily able steal three seats bar during lunch time told hour wait when literally HALF tables inside empty  seems place always wait but busy enough warrant it  can't understand why place wouldn't want all business can  group thought food just OK lacked much flavor excitement  <EOR> If give no stars would  still trying figure fuss all about  All place going location  located right middle strip which catches lot attention but other then food especially service good    My husband Saturday morning brunch  told wait going 30 min  hour later check totally skipped name  Mind took cell number down text when table ready  never received text but did sit soon check table  sure why skipped name    As soon sat down thought going greeted wait staff menus but waited ten minutes before friendly waitress came over sour face bad attitude  think she having bad day just hated job  Nonetheless service terrible  She made seemed wasting time    My husband ordered margherita pizza  came just cheese  If want add toppings dollar each  ended paying $18 soggy pizza no flavor  ordered breakfast burger asked medium rare  came well greasy  basically cheeseburger over easy egg  also came some sort home fries but dry hard  order frozen hot chocolate  Supposedly known for  nothing special  Definitely worth long wait    In conclusion plenty other places dine Vegas  would return Serendipty 3  did meet hype  <EOR> Marnie great she recommended amazing frozen chocolate shake! delicious nice heat little bit!! small more enough price isn't bad  <EOR> It started off bad kept rolling down hill but luckily finished bit high note    11pm place closes midnight   First all Vegas why would place located literally right strip smack dab middle Las Vegas Blvd close midnight?  seems ridiculous but made plenty time spare  Apparently place full service restaurant bar inside just dessert joint   hostess inside informed since large party would quicker if ordered window sat outside   Cool sounded easy enough   perused menu posted right outside next window order from   good 15 minute wait window order   But wait!  all items wanted available window  What?  menu right there!  Apparently cakes available window   guy window told all back inside order bar   Then take food outside again   Ok again     I order bar bartender seemed bit peeved doing but lightened end   He all trying serve patrons bar seemed weird order all food bar   Whatever   made things worse friends wanted big pretzel when ordered bartender told order OUTSIDE because only available window   WTF!  food all comes same kitchen right?  sent friend outside time closing window told she couldn't order   Oh HELL NO!  She wasn't having she very sternly told them she would getting pretzel would serving her   did   Enough all that   ordering system could use some help    obvious   The desserts all huge meant shared amongst 2 more people   Did we?  Hell no!  course Vegas living life excess   if only weekend    I'm happy report carrot cake all 12 inches plus delicious   according friends   humble pie peanut butter pie graham cracker crust bit overwhelming peanut butter taste   same Can't say no Sundae   too much peanut butter enough everything else   pretzel epic fail!  Epic!  frozen hot chocolate disappointment   Perhaps if didn't served to go would've better presentation then better taste   overpriced Frappachino   The best dessert place hands down deep fried oreo sundae   huge messy delicious   Yes  still sundae talking about   The cakes pie slices run $7 $10 easily feed 2 3 people   sundaes $15 also feed 2 3   If could figure more efficient ordering system they'd certainly business again   without pretzel!  Should more 2 stars   but VEGAS BABY   VEGAS! <EOR> Overpriced slow service food good  but great  don't recommend going here  better options Las Vegas strip  hot dog mac n cheese w bacon frozen hot chocolate fries  None them stand great taste but portion size okay  just don't see myself going back again  <EOR> Came New Years because everywhere else booked     Anyhow pizza choice 2 toppings roma tomatoes black sliced olives additional topings $1 00   pizza $20 overall good pizza but definitely worth costs   would just pleased $5 Little Caesars box pizza     The service really great though   really nice waiter Nick restaurant pretty pink  <EOR> What's say really   food sucks famous frozen hot chocolate nothing special   Children women may enjoy but much if male voting age  <EOR> Too expensive  really frozen hot chocolate but hate paying $11 it    We when want treat but many choices strip isn't worth waiting long line for  <EOR> This place most terrible service  waiting 15 minutes 104+ degree weather someone finally seated no greeting eye contact  say finally because sat numerous parties came us  matters worse ignore nearly 10 minutes seated  people very poor customer service made feel racist because only Asians crowd  visit place! No nice unless LOOK money  also think don't KIDS Kid Friendly establishment  Definitely never place again  <EOR> The food average but dessert amazing   portions huge there's $4 charge splitting but 2 people easily share some larger entrees such pizza   ordered Broadway sundae greatest dessert ever had   cost $15 Total Rewards members which seemed little pricey but sundae huge could serve 2 3 people   server nice guy but could little more attentive sometimes hard find him   Would visit again just dessert  <EOR> Portions HUGE   JF RC lured siren call Frozen Hot Chocolate  Since JF's first time @ Serendipity's required order original though PB caught eye I hear Oreo tastes nasty nothing Oreo   good but nothing special  other yelpers noted tastes something could whip home   SERVICE Although wait 15min table despite entire resto being quite empty waitress super sweet came check often   AMBIANCE seated far back corner overlooking strip  nice quiet right under heat lamp   FOOD Between three shared Thai Beef Salad quite large which made $16 50 price tag very flavorful  Lots random inedible add ins though uncooked vermicelli noodles half coconut shell etc   Side Steak Fries your typical steak fries additional bread crumb ?? coating outside made them extra crispy  Yum  Can't Say No Sundae OMG  thing monstrous  wish taken some lactase pills something because amount dairy consumed night no bueno tummy  Man  sundae size head  includes slice whoopee pie PB but peanut buttery coffee vanilla ice cream two bananas topped off mountain whipped cream cherry  Good lord    OVERALL fun place try    once  If ever come back definitely sharing anything order    probably no FHC  <EOR> Went Serendipity 3 10 6 09   no line looked pretty dead ordered frozen hot chocolate window outside   1 4 couldn't handle sweetness anymore   Its definately better if share another person even two   visited Serendipity New York past felt better experience there  <EOR> i think NY much better  i don't remember frozen hot chocolate being sweet    the mochaccino way sweet      and food! food  the nachos disgusting   salty chips huge easy eat unless break them   size 4 normal tortilla chips put together   their burger   also disgusting! overpriced too  will never come back  <EOR> I just arrived airport straight Breakfast cousin  ritual thing cousin  Love Frozen Hot Chocolate  Very delicious great place hang friends  <EOR> The service okay  thought frozen hot chocolate yummy!

Also prices reasonable!  know hard believe perhaps little funny say mentioning $1000 ice cream but coffees only $8 chocolate mix also $8 = rarity Las Vegas  <EOR> Slow service good better fast food food    If rush anything worth stop but still prefer Sugar Factory which offers same type food fun er atmosphere  <EOR> This such fun place eat  before concert going see Caesars Palace loved it  service fast courteous food fantastic  hamburger which phenomenal wife chose pasta dish which she loved much she insists return  cherry top great visit experiencing Frooozen Hot Choclate  far best non alchoholic frozen beverages ever had  well worth $15 price tag  Whether Las Vegas local just visiting fun great place eat  back! <EOR> This place definitely 5 stars when comes taste but prices 3  agree over priced but yet yummy! should definitely treat yourself Serendipty's if you've good  Peanut Sin City Frrrrozen hot mocha delicious!! still craving yet far away now  also Mac Cheese  hell mac cheese good? definitely place experience   just dont think price good time! Cheers! <EOR> The first time ate pretty interesting   friend spotted driving down strip thought would great place lunch     We decided sit outside which probably wasn't best idea   hot as always during summer Vegas mist sprays around doesn't really help   decided start All Nachos which amazing!! definitely hit spot help heal hangover   cheeseburger criss cut fries she footlong hot dog sweet potato fries   Both decent but anything drool over     Our waiter actually pretty nice guy but unfortunately think he still drunk previous night maybe even little high   He actually poured water into friends almost empty Sierra Mist glass   Also asked few condiments he completely forgot     My second experience good too    nachos again which just good   salad time instead hamburger which again just okay   Overall pretty good experience  <EOR> I came Serendipity 3 last year family friends  inside PACKED!!! order some food  Love Milk Shakes Hot Dog  length arm didn't chance try FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE  Serendipity serves BIG CAKES TOO!!  Man should come next time  <EOR> I could more saddened average famed Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was  14 bucks big but I'd rather trade size better ingredients! really does just taste chocolaty drink made Milo cold milk blended ice topped reddi whipp sprinkled Hershey's mini chocolate chips decorated 2 straws  Maybe brand names wrong but flavor profile similar supermarket ingredients  Sigh  first sip loose drink started reminiscing Chili's Frosty Chocolate Shake thick creamy premium tasting is     Frrrozen Hot Chocolate? far opposite decadent    Moving food shared The Only Las Vegas Strip Steak Sandwich suggested server  good recommendation! sandwich longer Subway's footlong 3 fried eggs top two still couldn't finish siting  rest tasted just good next day cold hotel room did microwave   never used think steak would work bread but sandwich convinced!  I really love ambience Serendipity 3  gives off naughty feel kind opposite you'd expect word serendipity that when see word think romantic   Everything humongous even menu! could wrap around entire torso lol    If visit again I'd definitely against intuition knowledge them famous just something un intention grabbing maybe it'll turn best! <EOR> My girlfriend came lunch because she loved movie   bit skeptical   Boy wrong place     We both ordered burgers which huge juicy   few burgers better   fries super crispy provided some really good ranch side   small bar corner but did drink anything   However did order coffee which French phenomenal   Our server Valencia top notch around all times service recommend great menu items us   atmosphere really cute girlfriend put it   lot pink accenting vintage clocks art    I coming back next time Vegas! <EOR> 2 stars unbearably poor service  3 stars food dessert   But overall comparison NYC 2 stars all give this   I expected more Serendipity   Perhaps comparing much New York intimate quaint cute   Serendipity definitely cute dainty aesthetics but service definitely does live fabulous outside   Same delicious signature frrroooozen hot chocolate fun enjoy hot day while people watching patio overlooking Strip   Food good pay presentation more taste it   We came Sunday around 11 am   didn't seated until 11 35   Once seated took 15 minutes waiter take order   Then another 30 minutes food way table into stomachs   much time wasted just quick bite eat      I think reason why such GINORMOUS menus occupy your attention  while take sweet time getting your order out     Desserts fab but really worth wait   Even if order take side which attempted next weekend    banana split took 20 minutes!!    definitely need work service   if want uphold essence NYC Serendipity might want steer away playing hip hop music   really doesn't jive cute dainty atmosphere   Best part restaurant?  Probably photo ops larger life Frrroozennnn Hot Chocolate outside restaurant quite manifestation  <EOR> Well came dessert fried Oreo sundae! hella good !

I may just need hit NYC day just say gone  wouldn't mind having frozen hot chocolate while course  P <EOR> I ordered chili cheese dog fries  person front ordered frozen hot cocoa apparently forgot pick up  cook gave calling number 5 minutes no answer  little disappointed would put some chili fries me  told would order entire side chili    The foot long hot dog all beef great  ended taking bun could finish it  bun good just lot it  chili very good but hate tomatoes other people might fine it  little pricey but portions huge could probably feed two people off plate  frozen hot cocoa??? OH       MY       GOD!!!! one  Don't question calories fat sugar just it  <EOR> Excellent server 'Deon'   checked regularly very pleasant chicken strips appetizer came 4 sauces BBQ ranch catsup mustard ok   Romano cheese onion ring thickly sliced but hubby liked it   AHI tuna salad avocado   Terrific!

The miniature tacos piled high burgers looked incredible well   Sometimes just tell looking dish going taste good   Very pricey but Vegas   would say prices very well stated compared anywhere else Las Vegas   However Sundae listed menu $1000   did see anyone order but if didn't come some kind quality gold jewelry don't see could worth it    I knock star off 15 min wait semi slow service   Sunday did appear no real management leadership place   saw lot servers standing around waiting something do   Meanwhile four young girls stood behind counter just chitchatting while half restaurant empty   didn't sense people wait long seated   Additionally when new customers came didn't know supposed check proceeded empty table   Then someone would finally tell them wait which made everyone confused Becsuse open tables lack professionalism behind check counter  <EOR> The dessert good through   it just wow factor when first came however sweet finish whole ice cream even thou  only thing order      But pizza another table look nice maybe next time! <EOR> Bought into hype  Time frozen hot chocolate    Lineup short quick  Service fast friendly gran side    Frozen hot chocolate pretty pricey was    I mean great  Chocolatey cold  wouldn't run back another one    Didn't realize until next day different flavours  Maybe bring back more time    Or maybe massive hot dogs will  Those looked Sweet! <EOR> Not expecting all but still ok  restaurant serves desserts  dessert shop  choice desserts ice cream banana splits  Tried both both very good  banana split good huge  ice cream also good but worth cost  <EOR> Long wait seated    waiter nice   long wait food  Food good steak sandwich ice cream sunday Over priced however its Las Vegas <EOR> I've died gone Ice Cream heaven!!

Don't listen negative reviews until try it    real     Their regular fries hella bomb too!!  The only reason give place 4 because expensive prices long wait <EOR> This Vegas bucket list since many people hyped up  However decor pink orange very cute feel Mary Poppin's movie  starving could 30minute wait  hungry walking around decided take window  ordered nachos sweet potato fries those good pizza banana split sundae    Unfortunately much report though  wanted hamburger but all out! yikes! might return try famous hot chocolate! <EOR> I hyped place  remember ordered famous frozen hot chocolate  Basically chocolate shake fancy name  Fancy decor but service good   Amazing location tourists but locals quite hike if park somewhere  again? Only strip watching  <EOR> I frozen hot chocolate  good  Just Wendy's frosty just chocolatier  Overall glad tried it  <EOR> I give four stars since haven't NY location almost positive food would better there  crazy big steak fried egg sandwich bacon  sinful but good egg sandwiches get  husband's reuben great  the meat little dry  frozen hot chocolate everything wanted since 110 degrees outside  didn't care over eight bucks time but hindsight lot chocolate milk shake  <EOR> I came high expectations but extremely disappointed  Don't come food  Dessert only highlight   My boyfriend ordered nachos  okay nothing rave about  ordered Asian Chicken Salad horrible  think only 2 bites it  chicken slimy weird   Portions big  Unless you're dying starvation just split meal  save lot money    There only positive frozen hot chocolate  pinnacle vodka  very good  Again something should share  very big   Prices ridiculous  $1 off your Total Rewards card but let's real $1 off doesn't really much difference   Service mediocre    I would come back again but only hot chocolate dessert  <EOR> I'll give place 3 stars rating   I don't reccomend regular food  But pretty good selection dessert  Dessert GALORE!!!  The service pretty poor here  waiter never come back table ask if group needed anything else   I'm ok price  vegas  <EOR> This place awesome desserts but service lacking  tiny place wait table indoors wants outside eating ice cream when 105+?? 4 people over 30 minutes  glad did wait because sundaes amazing! black white sundae way big 2 people even! could only eat half  hostess rude annoyed waiting inside name called  server didn't really check all just 1st would then here's your food enjoy maybe many tables TDK    Overall cute place stop dessert group  <EOR> The food mediocre overpriced not surprisingly service incredibly bad  waste your money  <EOR> Love frozen hot chocolate! <EOR> Disappointing sure  Everyone waaaaaaaaay over hyped Frozen Hot Chocolate   weeks leading last Vegas trip all heard try Frozen Hot Chocolate because amazing  But having now tried price way worth icy powder y tasting  would much rather chocolate frosty Wendy's  much more frozen hot chocolate doesn't cost $10+ dollars   I would say skip place  There's other and probably better places try Vegas strip  <EOR> Can just start off fact EVERYTHING menu extremely over priced?!   I absolutely hate places offer $20 entrees but when comes looks only worth half because portion  then complete other end spectrum desserts average price $15 20 don't give option downsize portion  HUGE! cakes least 6 7 tiers  sundaes goblet    But positive note waiter serves group extremely nice! Probably best waiters ever sorry don't remember name  Average height skinny bearded white guy  <EOR> A cute fast food restaurant  say place? shakes good! last March but didn't sit inside due packed! menu different inside which sucked! menu outside amusement park food = Inside restaurant menu burgers variety sandwiches different sorts pasta    I ordered Chinese chicken salad side order sweet potato fries which delicious  hot dog alright rather pinks hot dogs! donuts good!!! <EOR> Whether because eponymous movie famed frozen hot chocolates Serendipity's original location NYC tourist hotspot trap?   offerings include ridiculous $1 000 Golden Opulence sundae Vegas outpost only right   It's located outside Caesars Palace walkway towards Bellagio  Pro tip If want sit inside need order full on meal  However offer option ordering to go window if you're fine enjoying your dessert al fresco!  Frozen Hot Chocolate [$10]  Over years dulled all frozen hot chocolate  Overrated overpriced opinion features chilled hot chocolate  essentially taste texture crystallized sugar hot chocolate packet mix huge dollop whipped cream top   Red Velvet Sundae [$12 $10 Total Rewards]  If your Caesars Palace Total Rewards card quite few offerings offer bargain prices  red velvet sundae offers rich red velvet cake great cream cheese frosting paired vanilla ice cream hot fudge   Deep Fried Oreos Ice Cream [$12 $10 Total Rewards]   If you're looking gut bomb check deep fried oreos which crisp surrounding batter revealing gooey Oreos within  vanilla ice cream nice cooling base each bite    So if you're looking sweet treats I'd personally recommend skipping frozen hot chocolate trying other options Serendipity's dessert menu  <EOR> This place amazing!!! Hands down server Deon  servers knows compliment pay attention customers drinks likes wants  friends told taste he nailed spot  food served great portions desserts world  1 dessert made 3 people  If ask Deon!!! <EOR> This CRAPPY compared NYC   First all service sucks  waited forever sucky waiter take order     I excited Frrrozen hot chocolate but unfortunately crappy  original boyfriend oreo   Both super sweet heavy  just such disappointment since don't put crushed ice NYC  Without crushed ice its really frozen definitely doesn't really quench your thirst  portions also bit smaller could finished mine sweet towards middle     I came nostalgia never coming back serendipity  just crappy  mean yea NYC kinda gives attitude but least food good  <EOR> We made reservations requested outside table  told time patio closed private function  We arrived two Hostesses warmth unplugged toaster  good impression since set tone  When did finally call she asked whether wanted inside out  told told she said she would check  She waived over put inside near patio door  group behind no reservation she sat them outside  sat 4 outside patio tables open during hole service  Our waiter attentive point but serving staff needs learn reach putting your arm across table customers face once but twice  The meal good but no attention whole meal drink refills needed requested  The location does well just because location tourists hit once ad leave bad experience  locals remember pass on  Maybe if Manager Floor Supervisor would stopped good Customer oriented Resteraunt's might different experience? <EOR> The portions HUGE  If order slice cake better ready devour half cake kidding  definite must try signature frozen hot chocolates  loved white frozen hot chocolate raspberries  service wonderful! <EOR> All heard try Frozen Hot Chocolate while Vegas  last trip wasn't able fit but time check if off list  Came Tuesday morning wasn't wait all  other breakfast food items looked good but massive servers brought them adjacent tables    My friend both independently decided Mint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate reasoned cheaper order Two sized portion same flavor  huge glass bowl 1 3 just whipped cream  frozen hot chocolate itself very minty did touch Andes mints top  refreshing cool especially walking around Strip 80 degree weather frozen hard drink through straw  spoons provided mostly used tackle whipped cream haha    That only item off menu since airport soon all say wowzers   calorie wise pretty much breakfast lunch allocation sitting  Seriously 850 calories serving! Gosh  Maybe next time try Max Brenner since missed chance Boston well  <EOR> Frozen Hot Chocolate = Bomb!

Definitely much food 1 person maybe? Unless you're really hungry guess     The food good server pretty nice but seemed little overwhelmed   But he nice enough bring cheesecake pops since he made wait when originally sat down   if wasn't enough try Frozen Hot Chocolate   I guess expecting something more exciting?  But still good  <EOR> I heard Serendipity very long time now always wanted when NYC super excited when heard opened location Vegas  located right Cesar's Palace    Even though extremely stuffed made sure room Frozen Hot Chocolate here  Togo since wanted some gambling  wait wasn't bad drink relatively quickly    A small frozen hot chocolate costs $10 larger costs $14  opted small size since knew couldn't finish large size  really good  loved did friends  Very refreshing 100+ degree weather    Next time dine try whole experience!

Best buffalo pizza ever had! know couple around country NY Miami DC would most definitely again!!!! <EOR> If coming expecting your socks knocked off might good idea stop margarita bar outside consider   frozen hot chocolate definitely worth 10 dollars charge  Essentially hot chocolate flavored  icy drink  Definitely avoid  <EOR> Slow service  Food ok  Chicken waffles really good! menu overpriced  <EOR> TERRIBLE   ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE  My family walked 8 45pm eager try famous frozen hot chocolate  hostess she said full dine could grab order bar   looked around saw half seats empty   family wanted drink  frozen hot chocolate agreed wait outside 40 degree weather   outside waited good 20 minutes before man front said last being served   checked when closing which 10pm  only 9  inside decided order bar  took 10 minutes just them take order first line ordered frozen hot chocolate  $15 $4 more buying grab go  30 minutes order finally arrived  did extra frozen hot chocolate apology wait   frozen hot chocolate bad but terrible service  <EOR> Pros pizza can feed 2 not hungry people coffee hot chocolate kids' sliders meal  All food drinks great  sat outside patio  Very comfortable  Nice view  server a huge burly man plethora arm tattoos ultra friendly things very comfortable even covered drinks!

Their lunch foods typical American dishes slight twists although would say most whatever originality see derived presentation alone  wouldn't say lunch why should come but definitely avoid!  Oh texting when your table ready   absolutely awesome feature  <EOR> Up front just know need prepared wait wait wait which horrible BUT food good wait worth it! We appetizers nachos pizza share between three us    and couldn't finish all!! snacks left stuffed didn't even time try Frozen Hot Chocolate boohoohoo!! The nachos cheesy delicious pizza good crispy portions HUGE  We also saw people order sandwiches hot dog cheesecake all them could easily shared two people more   Considering size plate when comes prices totally justified EVERYTHING sharing size  You also discount when use your Rewards card Reward member pricing listed menu    They outdoor patio balcony overlooks strip which could totally fun just hang but since didn't heaters didn't sit there  Based food appetizers would love run into place breakfast day too! <EOR> This place delicious     yet need off weight watchers eat zero points before going day!  food appetizers entrees especially desserts super yummy fun! Breakfast excellent! Their sundaes ridiculous! The bad side service could improved over priced  Great kids! <EOR> I would give place 2 stars but waitress  saved day  walked around 3 hostess phone I really wished remembered name believe started J anyway     hostess being phone wasn't problem fact stood unacknowledged 5 minutes maybe little less  If there's thing totally irks when customers aren't acknowledged simple second would done wonders  started assume just suppose seat ourselves awhile  When hostess finally off phone think sorry wait ? Nope she asked many someone else took seats   I don't even remember making eye contact honest  ever hostess Sunday November 20th around 3 idk if having bad day but you're HOSTESS HOST! On food   ridiculously mediocre  husband paid 50 00 chilli dog chicken strips assuming they're charging based off being vegas  seeing prices food top terrible service  greeted didn't even want try any dessert  SAVE YOUR MONEY <EOR> I am glad see changed lettuce Seared Ahi Tuna salad!!   While food still stand 4 star rating because again price pay little overrated  <EOR> I've eaten restaurant few different times must say huge fan   located just outside Caesar's Palace considered more affordable restaurants Vegas   put affordable quotes because obviously relative term   still exactly cheap but food desserts both really good   First off portion size sandwiches burgers huge   burger first visit bacon blue cheese came ton fries    sandwiches could most definitely split between two people if aren't starving hungry   If eat whole sandwich burger yourself trust won't room dessert   wife learned second trip simply spilt chicken sandwich fries which more plenty both us   We splurged cookie sundae dessert   huge!  came few scoops cookie dough ice cream few homemade cookies top along hot fudge whipped cream   hungry just thinking now   If split meal dessert walk less $40 including tip   Some folks may consider expensive   Again affordable relative term  I'm big fan place would back anytime   thank wife helping discover place   Check if you're Vegas! <EOR> I'm satisfied Serendipity  ordered coffee very expensive but reasonable Vegas strawberry cheesecake dessert insanely expensive super fatty worth it   reason give 2 stars b c poor service  horrible place  took 10 minutes seated 2 people 10 minutes even order GAVE CHECK 5 minutes into dessert  heck service? common courtesy give check when requested unless fast food place understand  Overall going back  Nor should you  <EOR> Frozen hot chocolate   yummers! <EOR> This place disneyland tastebud    I screaming little 5 year old each orders came out  Frozen Hot Chocolate Foot long Chilli Cheese Hot Dog followed Audrey Sundae  bit disappointed Frozen Hot Chocolate didn't really seem anything more sloppy milkshake made Nesquick but foot long hot dog   oh foot long hot dog   I fricking thrilled sight taste it  DAMMNN GOOODD!! Audrey sundae could've used lot more coffee ice cream but also yummy served   I'd definitely give 5 stars if would lower price down each dish  Don't wrong I'd again heartbeat but willingness might affected amount money account  <EOR> I places lot character nice fun place visit  food amazing?

Over $10 something meh runny!  Jack Box's Oreo Shake much better much much less   Also Sugar Factory across street similar yet tastier frozen drinks   Think pass Serendipity next time! <EOR> It's okay   I think little pricy side but portion pretty generous need share!! onion rings pretty good! <EOR> CHICKEN WAFFLES infused bacon bits Need say more???  ok will   given southern comfort food handful tries but never outstanding   UNTIL tried Serendipity's!  bf bit reluctant when waitress recommended but decided last time dish redeem itself   and boy did it!!!  chicken juicy perfectly crisp outside   waffle one of a kind experience   Tell else puts bacon bits waffles?!?!?

If you've never something try since you're here   Tip take reservations always call ahead ask long wait is  <EOR> Review dessert only  Hubs coming years when visit Vegas  Don't know why just become tradition  say because every single time and eaten sundaes least 10 15 times sundaes always arrive melted looking tired gloopy gloppy  don't understand why  See pics? took them right placed front us  Gloppy whipped cream part already landslid ice cream never those freshly scooped nooks crannies  NEVER  Sundaes never come looking just scooped  looks made 20 minutes ago but mystery waited long it  don't know place but only options strip ice cream parlor  honestly once past hot or guess case cold mess still tastes good  Just pretty  Guess MO    Hot cocoa Kahlua yummy tum tum!  Service hit miss usually more miss but whatever  We're just ice cream  <EOR> When boyfriend Vegas first time excited finally eat here  While he gambling night treated myself dinner   After being seated two top myself waited approximately fifteen minutes before ANYONE stopped  No menu no drink order nothing  first words Oh yourself?! He apologetic said he just sure waiting someone  Finally he said he'd date night   I love banter normally would great but something upset constantly insinuating something wrong eating alone  Surely can't uncommon Vegas   My dinner lackluster  ordered chicken pasta dish even remotely impressed  say bad any means! just expected taste better Olive Garden  understand restaurant geared towards dessert  fine    I drink called something Alcoholic Girl Scout Cookie good  never would guessed alcohol because couldn't taste did nothing me  Oh well   I remember dessert being fine  Nothing wowed can't even remember had   Overall? You're definitely paying experience being able tell your friends you've eaten here  still think fun restaurant stop into but don't waste your money dinner focus booze sugar   And if you're eating yourself should probably just order your drink straight bar  <EOR> I hearing place quite while now decided time try out  would love able try food write review based but unfortunately didn't even opportunity try food review solely based SERVICE   I came Monday morning which meant fairly slow  walk around asking waiters if sit anywhere if someone seat which just pointed direction told speak hostess  big deal  spoke hostess she able seat down promptly gave menus  waitress came waters told she'd back shortly take order  15 minutes later she came take drink order  friend mine ordered coke rest content water  She came back coke left sooner could ask put order in  sat patiently waited her  15 minutes later see walking around talking customers still come back simply take order  point ran patience decided leave  Right when leave she came back asked if ready  told decided leave instead she nerve charge friend UNTOUCHED coke  furious just gave EXACT cash left  Didn't take name collect reciept which wish would could include review   I am very big service but am understanding certain scenarios  But 30 mins waiting slow day simply take order definitely unacceptable  don't even care try food anymore  seemed overpriced nothing special  Instead walked across street Quad Hash House instead half price service top knotch extremely busy there  read review location because definitely giving them five star compared horrible experience Serendipity 3  <EOR> My husband came long ago  hearing all rumors terrible waiting times very surprised quickly in  greeted taller blonde hostess cat eyes very friendly personable  She helped some directions nearby shopping hot spots  server also very friendly attentive believe name John  split famous Frozen Hot Chocolate  definitely enough two us  Gotta say quite impressed  ordered high heel pump which could bigger enough three  Overall good experience  cute atmosphere  definitely come back future  <EOR> Where missing glove?

Service greatest crowded think hard waiters properly attend you    literally flag them down times   food Crab Artichoke Dip really good big chunks crab!  BBQ Bleu Burger felt Bleu Cheese overpowered BBQ bacon  Fries delish! Kids menu Mac Cheese great dish kids cheese nice creamy Ice Cream Sundae decent nothing noteworthy <EOR> I yelped place since going Vegas wanted find somewhere good eat  heard famous Frozen Hot Chocolate knew try once area   My friends decided come during lunch surprise Holly Madison! awe complete shock when saw her! She 1 year anniversary Serendipity location  completely star struck due fact she sitting table right next us! Anyways back food    I ordered TBLT Turkey bacon lettuce tomato sandwich Sweet potato fries  portion pretty big unable finish sandwich fries  Sweet potato fries best ever had  crunchy also some sort brown sugar top give much sweeter taste  time finished half sandwich fries friend Jenn shared Frozen Hot Chocolate  When arrived some chocolate drowning bottom plate  good very filling  stuffed end meal    The service good considering fact surrounded paparazzi  waiter very attentive quick  place little pricey but strip nothing really cheap  <EOR> Leo best server ever!! Thank making Vegas trip end great note! Give raise Serendipity 3!! <EOR> If you've never heard frozen hot chocolate Serendipity 3 then you've obviously hiding under shell  Everyone talks its exactly sounds like  Hot chocolate  frozen served whipped cream top  might worth $11 but then again Vegas nothing cheap  Just relax pay price  worth when you're craving something cold sweet hot day  also tried jalapeño bacon pretzel  huge but didn't taste great  felt several hours texture wasn't great  <EOR> Let first start saying if kids going review place would probably give least 4 stars if 5  would give 4 only because every time wait table  gone mostly ice cream desserts  absolutely awesome sundae must treat while Vegas  however plan wait service honestly less stellar  prices bit over top but come expect when dining strip days  still experience if strip kids always want go  If plan eating definitely save room dessert  disappointed  <EOR> First all would come back eat but wouldn't wait more 30 mins   So friend around noon Monday looking score some yummy food   put name list hostess told would 30 mins then said they'd text when table ready   even told friend's cell phone many parties front over time   really neat   called table less 30 mins perfect table 2 outside right strip prime people watching      I ordered BBQ burger veggie patty friend ordered veggie omelet breakfast potatoes   Both VERY happy food   bacon burger die for!  smoked very thick!  veggie patty very tasty   think might them themselves   friend cleaned plate!  She loved cheesy veggie omelet egg whites breakfast potatoes!    Service little slow     think may need more people working but since weren't hurry wasn't such big deal   If hurry super hungry don't cause it'll while until food your tummy   But plus side outside cafe area where order food window seat yourself   very good option quick food restaurant quality  <EOR> I several sips girlfriends frozen hot chocolate all rave  good drink when location New York  Maybe because counter place actually restaurant itself   I ended getting gigantic cinnamon pretzel literally 2 feet long  quite good but also little hard bite into  may taken oven minute two short   My girlfriend also mini burger sliders  juciest amazing sliders long time possibly ever  took bite juices oozed out  oh good!  The reason am giving 5 stars hard pretzel also no sign where order your food pick up  waiting good 2 minutes before someone told order OTHER window  <EOR> You just love outdoor restaurant strip offers lots shade mistys during summer  always passed Serendipity no desire try until just gave bought large pizza soda which wasn't refillable costs around $20! Yikes! just gotta love Vegas but knew would cost much considering Caesar's Palace located center strip    TOTAL TOURIST TRAP!

Anyway table    our waitress asked want drink gave order said  all said  all     and she said  all going order   thinking drink yes   She left saw whispering another waitress like      hmmmm???? Then came close register asked sing daughter she said order desert did she  brought sundae candle DIDN'T even sing daughter     She just left table  just sang daughter just us!!!! RUDE!!!! waitress black lady looks unemployed stripper semi retired prostitute  she's also slow!!! Then waiting order looking yummy looking food  can't understand why she's taking long come back  30 minutes she came back receipt!!!! WTF!!!!! There's six only ordered drinks thought  all we're ordering!!!! Dumb waitress!!!! We're celebrating daughter's birthday!!! Anyway pissed just decided leave  place understaff      sundae sweet frozen chocolate drink everyone talking grainy  YuKkk!!! dumb black waitress needs training  can't believe didn't check name  other waitress seem nice faster  But she's just slow obviously place under staff  overcharge people understaff  Ridiculous!!!! Never come place again! <EOR> I came Sunday night friend hoping try frozen hot chocolate  made reservations 6 30 just case busy  found Cesar's palace parked structure free  looked map find restaurant lost somewhere hotel  very confusing huge hotel but finally found outside other side courtyard area  few tables full no need reservations  ordered frozen hot chocolate abc burger split  decided dessert first thing pretty good! flavor hot chocolate rich creamy  ice just enough sip spoon from  WAY much whipped cream scoop off  burger which asked well done definitely came pink  good burger meat which cooked some places others  would sent back eaten half realized kept getting more raw further bite into it  point where took meat just ate everything else  didn't see server most dinner  friend talking much catching didn't know if he being nice letting chat just shitty waiter never comes back check guests  would come back just frozen hot chocolate but maybe try something different because $21 burger fries ridiculous!! Especially when can't even cook right! <EOR> After having visited Serendipity 2 NYC years back excited try Serendipity 3 recent visit Las Vegas  thing agenda FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE!   It your typical vegas day 110 degrees hot wanted grab table enjoy some frozen beverages but wait table Saturday afternoon already 30 minutes  Luckily walk window outside where order off full menu    Within 5 minutes happily sipping frozen hot chocolate  may seem little pricey $14 large but easily shared between 2 people you're vegas expect served tourist prices grabbed cool treat head nearby air conditioned forum shops enjoy shop! <EOR> *** REVIEW DESSERTS ONLY ***  My older sister raved place days couldn't understand why until actually chance visit  usually fan ice cream but Serendipity's sundaes hooked! definitely left place feeling few pounds heavier but well worth price   My friends ventured Vegas decided come since 100+ degrees outside  ordered Frrrozen Hot Chocolate $10 Awesome  really does taste hot chocolate albeit cold  probably best dessert if you're really watching your budget but still want taste Serendipity's goodness  friends finished super quick don't normally sweet tooths   Audrey's Can't Say No Sundae $14 Oh gosh  think heart attack while eating since much sweetness but super tasty! includes humble pie peanut butter cream graham cracker crust  tried super hard finish but sizes all sundaes gigantic  enough ice cream feed 3 people but may want share having bite   Strawberry Fields Sundae $14 Wow don't think any other strawberry dessert hits spot much one  cheesecake definitely compliments strawberry ice cream overall just works  Definitely flavorful great option if fruity flavors   Black White Sundae $14 Chocolate vanilla ice cream whipped cream topped tuxedo chocolate covered strawberry  Super delicious too  flavors basic but great classical twist nonetheless!  I understand why people would complain price but place home freaking $1000 dessert! Why expect anything less expensive here? Plus Strip! well known fact restaurants Vegas let alone Strip pretty costly   Anyways definitely come again when Vegas  But if plan eating sundaes sure group hungry people share with! Trust there's enough everyone  <EOR> I walked walked right back out   place needs renovation    deep cleaning   Because unwelcoming staff gross environment didn't want take chance stomach  <EOR> I came specifically frozen hot chocolate because heard many great things it  Personally drink did excite taste buds thought overrated  wasn't bad but much hype expectations high  two corn dogs $7 nothing special but definitely overpriced  feel need give place another chance try more things menu sit down inside restaurant whole experience    <EOR> I disappointed little shop  big long line snack  took 10 15 minutes pretzel cold hot chocolate  wasn't line most upset I don't mind long line if food good well being said pretzel wasn't all great hard cold  quite sure if intention pretzels but sure don't way don't enjoy hard rock pretzels  most deceiving part long line everyone hanging front some good quality food maybe everyone else's food good but mine sure wasn't  When employee handed pretzel man surprised see big yummy going taste but man disappointed rock pretzel  just expected more long line if know mean  guess place just all hype line   I probably won't coming back if sure won't pretzel  Thank goodness didn't see price much everything cost because wifey paid if knew much she paid probably would writing much place over priced  <EOR> Not going lie Serendipity bucket list since saw movie when 15  Finally chance back June Las Vegas  service wasn't great really shouldn't take hour order item but Peanut butter frozen hot chocolate made all worth it  <EOR> This some East Coast meets West Coast shizz right here  going down rather down    Being The Bay fair share Ghirardelli chocolate sundaes Monterey CA flagship shop Ghirardelli Square San Francisco  around $9 rarely long wait killer sundae  big enough split  Contrast New York institution Serendipity $14+ sundae!!! You've kiddin' me!  After eating Hofbräuhaus last night sister headed over Serendipity 3 birthday dessert  Somehow took nearly hour over S3 but once building able walk right seated    I'm cool poor pay $10 $15 powdered milk cocoa power blended ice Frozen Hot Chocolate  Forget it! chose $14 Strawberry Fields Sundae  Seriously strawberry ice cream PLUS cheesecake PSSSSH if another option chose! Granted always girl choose gummy worms jolly ranchers over chocolate would never try rip somebody's eyes Hershey's bar during time month  waited good 20 minutes sundae arrive  Just telling sister kind stuff rate place 2 stars waiter waltzed HUGE strawberry sundae definitely enough least four people share  TON left over take home    The sundae divine but long wait time coupled ridiculous prices seriously +$1 sprinkles?! 2 star experience  sundae could EASILY recreated home slice NY cheesecake any supermarket pint strawberry Häagen Dazs ton strawberry sauce whipped cream mere fraction cost sundae    There no way would affordable place eat if #1 sharing #2 eating meal well dessert  think I'd rather skip high prices copy cat home  <EOR> Such bad place  First friends waited 35 minutes table  But said take table outside  Gee! Then ordered   server made long wait   but when came time eat   for some odd reason back house people did order   veggie burger  time food friends done  veggie burger great better  owners really think its business patrons wait table  <EOR> Perhaps because lose lot brain cells whenever hit strip but hard time grasping idea frozen hot chocolate  Mine wasn't hot   it's just frozen chocolate! Anyway portions huge food all right   the party ordered salads sandwiches cali hot dogs spinach dip tons desserts  desserts great but sure would ever crave again strong urge come back wasn't memorable   However take reservations catered party 16 without any problems  Yipee! <EOR> I don't understand low reviews     Every time Vegas try famous frrrroozzzen hot chocolate!  And goodness amazingly delicious treat! Would eat there? No way  much better food options Vegas   But cold treat hot Nevada day? Yes please! <EOR> Breakfast champs here   at 1pm  on 3 1 2 hours sleep  Hey Vegas  sleep overrated  Personally think frozen hot chocolate overrated  fan just tastes iced water flavor chocolate  However ice cream cookie sundae AMAZINGNESS!! pastas don't remember which but think shrimp  If kids probably more family friendly places strip in Vegas  But prepared wait awhile  2 girl friends ended waiting around hour table  inside  [Slightly off topic think Brody Jenner guy looks exactly sitting tables outside don't really remember he eating since  meh celebrities  don't care  ] <EOR> Service Vegas usually impeccable  Everywhere impressed  However second time tried Serendipity because its right Caesar's vicinity must say disappointed again    I come business each year when think place think friendly happy atmosphere  place anything but  asked special chocolate martini something chocolate themed received rolled eyes attitudes every time  Then when order seems could bothered me  mention rest staff did greet say goodbye when left just spending almost $100    The burger alright asked it  Just completely disappointed service yet again  <EOR> I tried Ahi salad which just very good avocado just over whelming though just much but other really good  burger very juicy delicious cooked perfection  Our dessert Snickers sunday which amazing crunchy yet chewy melting caramel snickers lovely peanut butter sauce chocolate sauce tons whipped cream  just amazing sunday  big between two impossible finish  am definitely coming back soon try more desserts  Everything just amazing menu looked awesome hard choose single thing  Quick service bit wait which fine since totally worth it  <EOR> 40 min wait over half tables empty?  We came late Sunday night off strip buy soda but told would  30 40 minute wait  said OK gave them cell could text when table available    We outside sat ten unoccupied tables waited  30 minutes receiving text left found soda somewhere else  When walked into new restaurant received text saying table almost ready  <EOR> This place unique culinary experience  Patrons enjoy few breakfast items lunch dinner options too  But let's face most folks desserts!  devoured Amaretto Frozen Hot Chocolate  first time trying loved it  Since more dessert beverage change ordered eat meal would taste right  opted cheeseburger sliders which fit bill    As word caution beverage pretty big may want share someone else  also very sweet!  would tell waitress bring end your meal  Mine brought first which made eating feel somewhat backwards     Even though portions big food pretty tasty place cheap  spent around $30 meal  <EOR> I must say portions huge   party six ordered six different entrees  way much food   French toast delicious   would recommend coming breakfast because weren't very impressed lunch menu  <EOR> This place alright but SUPER OVERHYPED overpriced Mel's Drive Johnny Rockets   The first time came it Saturday tremendously long line prevented having sit down meal   order TO GO booth outside restaurant convenient but line STILL LONG    Frozen Hot Chocolate which tasted Chocolate Icee Smoothie   Nothing spectacular   especially worth wait $10 cup!  The second time came it Thursday 5pm absolutely no line sit down meal which GREAT   another opportunity look menu   burgers use unique type bread  glazed sprinkled sesame seeds similar Asian bun which boyfriend got   also comes side your choice   However cuz wasn't hungry just decided ordered side $6 freaking kidding me?!?! I dont ever remember paying $6 waffle fries even if unique      There's definitely cheaper options Vegas don't fooled name hype! exactly worth wait    <EOR> I've Serendipity NYC thought pretty good  I even bought packets own hot chocolate home!  But Serendipity 3's frozen hot chocolate could use some work   just tasted chocolate milk carton fridge   What did enjoy carrot cake   Yes expensive but also enough feed 6 people actually moist delicious without being cloying   cream cheese frosting also fantastic!  wish knew recipe because would well red velvet cupcakes!  So while I'd give carrot cake 4 5 stars frozen hot chocolate 3 service 1   waiter rude   boyfriend wanted share small 10 oz frozen hot chocolate waiter would stop insisting order larger one   Even told *repeatedly* wanted he would let go   Seriously?  Funny he didn't bother mentioning ridiculously large carrot cake was!  Seems waiters just hungry more tip  <EOR> I've twice now first time waited 40 min seat eat  recall burgers appetizers being decent frozen hot chocolate absolutely delicious!

Probably not  sorely disappointed  someone said wasn't overly sweet       Lies  Although diluted chunky ice still felt sickenly sweet  guess good people major sweet tooth  waitress also wasn't entirely friendly when all ordered frozen hot chocolate  didn't even offer water which found every other table around me   One word sum all disappointment <EOR> Finally made several attempts visiting Vegas  Everything looked delicious service supeb  rootbeer float deep fried snickers chocolate cake sundae all great  serving size ridiculously huge  desert enough feed 3 4 order 1 desert each overkill waste money  must when Vegas when need sweet tooth fix  <EOR> Bartender super unfriendly Rhonda name  Said tourists ask many questions  nachos ok  Customer service horrible  <EOR> If reviewing food would give star but you're supposed order food going blame them  fish tacos super gross  However frozen hot chocolate advertised very delicious  <EOR> If could give ZERO stars would  Whoever manager person charge running place must lacking train efficient well mannered staff    Me friends group 8  didn't know where lunch all settled Serendipity since already there    We walked asked table 8  hostess responds going hour wait  rude hate job hate customers voice  Which made no sense because all outside patio empty half inside empty  said ok right back  outside discuss if still want eat here  Half group said never mind  three others decide eat here  back inside tell exact same hostess table 4  She responds can't split parties! In hate people voice   First all did say being split parties? No  see rest group here? No  Did HUGE 'ol assumption? Yes  nicely said Oh just 4 rest friends decided pass  She gave disgusted look proceeded seat us    We sat down server came greeted 5 minutes later took drink order  food ok overpriced not surprised     Basically came give place shot  whole hour wait time didn't any sense because eating hour didn't busy all food still took forever    I would come back but probably just order instead dealing rude untrained hostesses    The job hostess greet customers  They're first person customers interact fact rude just unacceptable  worked server hostess before honey done! hope she didn't tipped out! <EOR> i would totally come back next time am Vegas   did try any desserts stuffed dinner! not typical   wishing did because apparently more known for  also pretty cold any ice cream frozen stuff wouldnt good choice   we potato skins app Skirt steak bacon mac cheese dinner   portions great flavor amazing   service just okay me    The decor reminded Alice Wonderland Dr  Seuss something very bright colors whimsical touches  especially enormous menus pretty comical read because dont even fit table   I saw someone next getting lots cool martinis  if drank would totally into fun drinks!  FYI $1000 sundae menu! flaked Gold leaf!  am awe exists 4 5 stars!!! <EOR> My friends came fight off brutal hangover 30 minute wait ready sloppy once more true Vegas fashion  frozen hot chocolate stole show you adult frozen hot chocolate no shame   hot chocolates before meal which ended overshadowing rest food but no complaints us  combo where combine burger fries frozen hot chocolate into individual meal kind cool but wayyyy filling  Its really busy place servers seem best can  Unfortunately all three orders came messed not bad though   each missing something burgers ended even getting stuff politely asked it  No biggie though human  Gil server he absolutely awesome he ended giving cool places only locals know of  must place if you're strip  <EOR> The food Serendipity really great waitress fantastic  Though hour wait sit metal chairs constantly opening door exactly idea ambiance  Oh fire alarm off cool   This sound old lady but realllly loud inside food service slow   Over all yummy eats but over hyped experience  Prices really reasonable $10 bloody mary big spicy super delicious  <EOR> I frozen hot chocolate immediately felt ripped off  white chocolate shouldn't hyped cost more something Starbucks boba shop  <EOR> Great part date night if you're tourist wandering down strip  local generally avoids strip much possible serendipity just wasn't worth trip   We opted window vs waiting hour table restaurant side  Line wasn't bad service pretty quick  try frozen hot chocolate just cuz  guess honestly say best $18 chocolate milkshake ever had  very thick chocolatey rich but overwhelming  Would back? Doubtful  Yes am yet another person bitching expensive but hey its recession Vegas full awesome reasonable places  maybe should say Vegas full places aren't ridiculously overpriced serendipity 3 is  I thought coming back try some food but reviews all over place  Most point badly inconsistent kitchen pass! <EOR> Good service professional servers food portions generous presentation good very interesting fun frozen hot chocolate very good sweet  Excellent <EOR> Honestly all pretty much hype  NYC but least hour wait didn't 3 hours spend ice cream shop  some things take window  Which ridiculously limited choices  ice cream itself fine but Dairy Queen  Definitely won't waste time if ever back Vegas  <EOR> Wanted try place but whole restaurant wait line very disorganized   front door back door there's line take mention hostess very rude!   many other places moving on    <EOR> Worst possible service ever  I don't understand why Vegas service isn't better when many other different places people choose over your restaurant bar lounge etc  Boggles mind  When  walked no greeted two hostesses just chatting door saw but didn't care  took 2 minutes before asked 2? Sat down ordered food server didn't give shit either  He never once came back check us  Actually he no where found he came but didn't stop table when ready leave  ask togo box another server    The food New York isn't all great  Food TGIFridays any other joint  Seared Ahi Salad meh seared ahi completely crusted sesame black seeds somewhat disgusting  salad part good though wrong throwing bunch lettuce toppings plate  Buffalo Chicken Pizza little overwhelming  said blue cheese crumbles but more blue cheese glops few spots pizza    Really only reason come frozen hot chocolates because movie Serendipity want experience nice romantic moment John Cusack Kate Beckinsale shared cold winter night well going definitely far experience  <EOR> This place seriously overrated ridiculous wait worth it  Yes frozen hot chocolate worth trying but beyond sweet! Overall ok would way dine again  <EOR> Specifically came Frrrozen hot chocolate I didn't know different flavors until saw menu ended picking Almond Amaretto!  icy cold very very very SWEET!  enjoyed candied almonds drink great but because sweet only finished half   price $13 add extra $1 flavor   presentation lovely   indoor outdoor seating nice place   Maybe next time come back lunch try food  <EOR> good desert but big fan food  portions huge tho <EOR> Overpriced tourist trap   The Fettuccine Alfredo BBQ pizza disgusting   The chili hummus mediocre   Added star because customer service solid  <EOR> My girlfriend happy finally try famous frozen hot chocolate  When finally waiting 45 mins time seated nothing special   think McDonald's fraps better    1  server took good 10 15 mins take order   2  time melting substantial puddle melted cream water formed bottom plate comes probably because sitting 10 15 mins  3  first time didn't know if chunks ice literally cubes we're suppose there  many big chunks ice couldn't drink straw      irritating thing when told server first time wondering if chunks ice suppose frozen hot chocolate  He said yes because frozen drink   What idiot  maybe should invest Vitamix    The only reason 2 ratings because great location girlfriend thought place cute  <EOR> Food portions huge  fair price charge  some Vegas Sandwhich forgot exact name   But NY steak bacon eggs garlic French Bread  thing huge    but tasty! bit messy eat though  Used coupon hotel free Frozen Hot Chocolate    drink okay  Nothing special it   tastes hot chocolate    but cold lol  Probably very easy make   Had wait 30 mins  But cool text when your table ready  walk around Caesar's bit  give 3 5 mins back your table when ready  There's also site text check many people ahead during your wait  think every restaurant should this! Especially busy areas Vegas  <EOR> I'm never stepping foot place again   Service generally slow but waiting 30 minutes food bit excessive   top off server friendly he admittedly forgot ring drink ordered beginning   food came cold burger wasn't cooked right temperature pasta ordered needed heavy hand salt   Overpriced mediocre food crap service even worth it   This place should stick being desserts only  <EOR> Super Cute!  We came brunch while Vegas mini vacation liked it! sat right away employees all very friendly  restaurant super cute vibe very colorful diner like  only reason why am giving restaurant 3 stars instead more because took really long time food  server very prompt drink orders coming back take orders but just wait actually food  Once food arrived very tasty  portions HUGE  literally could split meal between 2 people  ordered fried chicken tenders waffles hangover omelet  wasn't really fan french fries being added omelet but just personal preference  Overall great experience would definitely back try desserts which looked AMAZING! Give them shot!  I hope review helps decide where catch good delicious brunch while Vegas! <EOR> I seared ahi salad  fucking@awesome com  The atmosphere meh but its famous  enough along person chose it  Just every entree $15 don't think gonna cheap Mr penny pincher  odds eating very slim unless back Vegas person chose want eat again  But damn sure picking place that  <EOR> It's tourist attraction local's lure  They're big going BIG  give try just once  don't take reservations which kind annoying but oh well plenty people watching entertain while wait     I twice sit balcony people watching! For first time just dessert  ordered 2 sundaes 6 people still left overs!! fried Oreo sundae which no recollection of another called can't say no sundae favorite because disliking peanut butter    Second time appetizers drinks dessert  Macaroni cheese artichoke dip WAFFLE FRIES  all good but nothing extraordinary    Drinks peanut butter frozen hot chocolate again peanut butter mixed dessert isn't fave Pina Colada because some root beer drink supposed tasty  finale banana split equally huge cliche    Good place come fun groups  spend some extra food average but Vegas baby!! <EOR> I wondering why place such bad reviews then found during most recent trip in    We excited come eating dinner wanted some sundaes share amongst party  When checking seated hostess said each order sundae absolutely no sharing    Dessert all sharing couldn't believe hearing  ended having order take window eat 40 degree weather middle December  Ice cream equivalent Baskin Robbins but service terrible throughout even take window  <EOR> This review dessert only  honest never actually food  always come dessert    Let's start saying Frozen Hot Chocolate magical   The first time Serendipity Frozen Hot Chocolate New York City  remember clearly first time  wait seated shock minimum charge per person GIANT Frozen Hot Chocolates coming instantly regretting having ordered 1 share between 2 people  Most importantly remember delicious was  Imagine amazing hot chocolate but frozen then melted down perfect temperature smoothie   Frozen Hot Chocolate like   On hot summer day even cool winter night it'll satiate all your chocolate desires  even hot cocoa ones   I also tried some other drinks including Amaretto Almond Hot Chocolate  going honest just say think classic Frozen Hot Chocolate still best  Definitely star dish opinion    If you've never famous Serendipity restaurants I'd recommend stopping Frozen Hot Chocolate  grab bar window outside if don't want sit inside  <EOR> This once go to family myself beyond amazing sundaes shakes  gotta say   this first time disappointed restaurant write review it  ordered frozen hot chocolate deep fried Oreo sundae  looking forward eating given don't come often  But when shake sundae already half melted  huge sundae milkshake remember pretty small pathetic honest  sundae only thing wasn't soupy mess Oreos themselves  frozen hot chocolate? Meh  I don't know if just random horrible day ice cream   maybe was? If first time eating probably wouldn't come back    Oh server kind tired  long day  But didn't experience better  sure  <EOR> Went daughter's bday Saturday staff great  issue place prices  crazy charge $20 basic cheese burger side fries  place strip front Caesars but charge prices absolutely crazy  5 eat bill $205 tip  same food red robin similar place  No anything fancy 2 cheese burgers grilled cheese tomato soup chicken sandwich 2 beers 1 frozen hot chocolate deep fried Oreos some ice cream  Again staff great really cool waiter great personality  issue prices some average bar food anywhere around town much less  don't see myself going back place would recommend anyone  <EOR> After being forced watch movie knew wanted try ice cream shop!  avoiding stopping since place always busy   mean lines wrapping around everything!  means must good right? recent trips decided brave sun long line tried some Serendipity   I only tried thing menu review short one   much talked Frozen Hot Chocolate   decent serving size overkill truly decadent rich treat   just little sweet powdery liking think more whipped cream actual frozen hot chocolate   think would much rather spend money inside Caesar's Palace delicious dessert shop best macarons ever   frozen hot chocolate though think stick San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square   This ice cream shop sickeningly cute   every other place Strip theme rampant atmosphere worth few selfies Instagram   Stop if you're ice cream fanatic   hope don't mind wait obvious tourist trap Serendipity  <EOR> Service whack  called advance reservation 730pm group 10   just 7 30 told hostess reservation   She basically told no reservation made 7 30 name wasn't wait  told just called hour ago if theres anyone else would've answered phone she asked know spoke to? said no   she basically said theres nothing then wait  Gosh BEEZZYYY  Luckily another girl came asked what's goin she happened took reservation over phone she seated  Great communication between those employees!!

Seriously never again   If ever visit place again we'll just food to go because place seriously doesn't understand definition customer service   obviously don't know run organized business  <EOR> It first time coming service amazing! waiter very kind helpful  ended ordering hot dog much bigger expected  could only eat half but delicious    Definitely great food stop! <EOR> This review only FROZEN CHOCOLATE!   I've original Serendipity New York restaurant lot more  There's more character place  Vegas way orange pink  guess fits Vegas  admit there's lot room here  Very different den like feel NY location    My friends bar ordered frozen hot chocolate  barely tasted hot part but still good  Maybe 115 degree weather outside all walking friends did strip but frozen hot chocolate hit spot  Frozen blended goodness! truly refreshing! 3 shared still didn't finish it  huge portion  Love chocolate shavings! wish could another right now  MMMM! <EOR> This place pretty overpriced quality food nothing call home about  friends ordered frozen hot chocolate side fries  food came pretty quickly service alright terrible but amazing  frozen hot chocolate pretty big but little bit deceptive since half order whip cream MEH portion size  I'd share friends its way much sugar person split between three people its OK  fries alright nothing amazing also worth $7  thought burger king fries taste same fraction cost  Most items menu seemed overpriced $20+ burger etc    bill ended being around $28 frozen hot chocolate side order fries ripoff! would come again prices quite high mediocre food    On side note if order walk window its 80% cheaper seems price discrimination but hey its Vegas  other places eat which much tastier strip save your money spend drinks  <EOR> what's all hype?  It's daringly awful frozen hot chocolate gimmick cup   for ELEVEN that's right 11 one American USA dollars   oh Serendipity means pleasant surprise alright  you'll surprised hiked prices terrible drinks  <EOR> Was impressed all  If love hokey unimpressive food giant chocolate shakes loud environment then all means Seredipity your kind restaurant but me   The food sub par  order basic bagel lox made club sandwich style  really necessary? potatoes served fine but rather greasy exciting  frozen hot chocolate very good pina colada drink ordered but overall wouldn't mind if never came back  service disorganized place ridiculously loud thank goodness reservations would gone bananas  <EOR> SHUT FRONT DOOR! I swear did review place since FIRST time Vegas weeeeeiiirrrd  Anyways review LONG overdue   Went wifey because raved ever so famous Frozen Hot Chocolate  Vegas 3 days twice  FYI text when your table ready which thought really cool option most restaurants should use   The first time sat inside  ordered White House Pizza whicvh sauceless white pie ricotta mozzerlla parmasean topped fresh basil truffle oil  gave meat Lent otherwise would've totally tried Smoked Chicken Quesadilla *drools actually more flavorful thought would be  I'd recommend The second time friend just wanted Frozen Hot Chocolate satisfy craving opted walk window just outside sit down restaurant  WARNING line ALWAYS long  But decided brave line it  But just luck soon we're front line computer system decides crash  stood literally 30 mins which wasn't bad because guy front window provided complimentary Frozen Hot Chocolate while waited  SUPER nice since know people behind didn't same benefit The selection menu absolutely crazy! Just variety far Hot Chocolate HOLY CRAP  If you're indecisive person GOOD LUCK GOOD SIR  lol but really    could literally Vegas 100 more time try EVERY SINGLE thing menu  just sayin' <EOR> We just barely missed lunch everyone table option order breakfast wait twenty five minutes before could order lunch menu    meh ordered breakfast   Being little quirky meals skipped past crazy waffle concoctions discovered shrimp asparagus frittata served green salad top?
