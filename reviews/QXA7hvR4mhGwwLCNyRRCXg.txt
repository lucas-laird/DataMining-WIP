Looked them Yelp seen few pictures read some reviews figured just try myself   It's basically Mexican style sushi  The concept opinion great! And food too!  I take surprise happened know hostess! experience very well!  I tried rolls soon ready loved them! if someone dined tasteless meal don't see happening  I'd assume maybe just ordered something wasn't you'd order begin with  I'd recommend asking your waitress help around menu I did always good recommendations   Although downfall menu being all Spanish  don't see work people can't speak language  Hopefully fix everybody else able order easily without bugging employees much questions   Also variety yummy hot sauces salsas pair any food  Which also available buy definitely did take some home me! Can't wrong!  I'm excited bring mom grandma here! <EOR> Service good  Second time coming here  Sushi really good  el pariente roll  bacon meat  t beer yet  Waitress said working on  Over all decor nice black red  Music little loud but horrible  buttons napkin holders  live Sushi nice see something different  Overall good job  <EOR>
