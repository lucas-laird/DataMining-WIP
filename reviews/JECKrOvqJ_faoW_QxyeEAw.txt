Definitely authentic but nonetheless food awesome   twice over past two weeks huge fan   First drinks great   Margaritas traditional strawberry both excellent   also good variety beer tap   Portions pretty big come hungry   carnitas roasted chicken juicy come great sides   Good salsa guacamole well   And found service great both occasions visited restaurant   Prompt attention but much becomes hovering   Plus place beautiful bar area  great relaxed dinner  <EOR> I love El Jefe's!  ditto Carly margaritas   strawberry margarita enormous really tasty   entree chili relleno stuffed cheese carne asada   Omg good!  bf steak fajitas looked really good   wouldn't know since never bite!  Chips salsa aren't best but entrees definitely it   only thing would avoid churro dessert   the mini churros aren't cooked all way through doughy mess melts ice cream into glop   good people  <EOR> My friends took way home Los Angeles Las Vegas   couldn't say enough good things lobster enchiladas ordered la carte   OK   sauce sweet but really flavorful   place bland version American version genuine Mexican restaurant   However service really great!  If want Mexican food somewhere else  <EOR> This horrible mexican food even vegas  pretty dang bad!   chips stale way thick   tortillas homemade   dishes majorly over sauced   Very generic overpriced mexican food  <EOR> Well lets see   first wanna say totally agree reviews place already received  usually survey restaurants didn't see single mexican person which threw off  mean place does need littered particular race but if food authentic good then usually mexicans frequent place  Same Asians Blacks etc  Well brought friend seems love place  The waiter polite  and soda flat  ordered green chicken enchiladas tasted sweet  I mean prefer spicy mexican food  not sweet mexican food  totally killed night me  because seemed he excited food  He such rave reviews place  Apparently must if your Vegas   My friend ordered albondigas soup which didn't look kind ex mother law made  looked stuff honestly  But other chips salsa didn't look good either  music annoying didn't chance look check sure I'd b*tch prices too  King Taco when need one? <EOR> i love el jefes food good  service little crappy but food awesome it!!!!! <EOR> If hadn't seen own two eyes might believe really restaurant called El Jefe's  made want walk right hostess desk ask best Chevy Chase voice anything besides    Mexican food? But place indeed real fact plenty things menu would confuse heck Mexicans real fictional  decor's your first clue perhaps isn't your typical combo plate shack  Obviously guys pretentions shows menu   Now no purist when comes comida love gringified Mexican places much next SoCal emigrant even pretty fond Mexican fusion when done right  But even given fact they're obviously shooting straight demographic couldn't find anything latch onto El Jefe's  chips salsa brought table didn't give much hope chips made strange combination flour corn masa giving impression eating wrapping greasy chimichanga both green red salsas obviously sweetened   Even though wasn't particularly hungry ordered Mexican chopped salad hedge bets  spicy mix chicken lettuce poblanos pepitas hominy apples wasn't bad although again someone kitchen used very heavy hand sugar when mixing dressing  main mole chicken enchiladas  arrived soup plate swimming sauce artfully drizzled crema  chicken good if particularly interesting sauce would perfect balance smoky spicy rich if hadn't marred odd fruity sweetness  Accompanying pintos bland white rice waterlogged    unnecessary   The whole experience made want back into kitchen ask Could angry something else taking me? <EOR> I couldn't agree more Anita C    she hit right head review      This place intrigued right first off  remember part town your atmo really nice Mexican any means     theres some sort stereo type seem if Chinese restaurant filled Asian peeps must good well Mexican place d filled Caucasians     no promise right      food good but authentic any means     the chips       wierd     not tortilla chips all some sort fried flour tortillas    bad but really good either      I back <EOR> I back old stomping ground just enjoy El Jefe chips  wanted cry when saw now closed   happened? <EOR> We dinner last night  pretty good  place nice looks new    The service great!

Because Tex Mex grew loved  grease wicked unrecognizable sauce people? unlike Cabo @ Red Rock's one very favorite Mexican restaurants no free pintos dip chips in  know picky     But hey review   However special corn flour blended chips world  OH  MY  GOD   Perfectly crunchy bit chew  super yummy! two different salsas green red decent  But beyond fabulous chips     Husband cheese enchiladas first time loved them  Second time    lobster enchiladas thought he creaming himself  nachos first time said delicious chips great chicken quesadilla second time totally ok  where does leave us? totally decent un greasy creative Mexican place   Bonus manager sticks pretty close stopped ask food both trips  necessary feature but certainly felt he gave damn place  Waiters both times just okay  Nothing above beyond  Both times Sunday nights seated immediately  <EOR> The place amazing   food incredible place really well laid out   chips salsa unlike anything you've worth trip alone   specific ratio brag but happen salivate just thinking those things   salsa also homemade   My experience very last time bit disappointing but only because saw waiter bartender twice   almost left because he never greeted us   know busy restaurants having served 2 years busy   But other times before wowed   burrito time Carnitas Especiales another   chicken quesadilla start drinks just kept coming   service astounding!  But sail short 5 stars reason management needs servers care   disappointed last time don't know just soon want come back even if marinate pork citrus based marinade  die for   That being said think Chevy's Macayo's joke comparison food wise but service just inconsistent enough don't know soon returning  <EOR> Food god awful  mole sauce tasted used powdered chocolate just tasted weird  parents live close restaurant craving Mexican NYC much selection terms decent Mexican    If Henderson avoid place plague <EOR> This place cool   I lunch decor nice   The booth comfy   I inside burrito chicken which decent   My fren chicken tostada salad which let's jus say he didn't stress shoulda jus ordered shit   The portions R huge   I heard drinks R pretty tasty but didn't venture can't really comment    <EOR>
