We originally came $1 oyster special happy hour   sat down patio area given menu   Just few minutes later busboy served water   Great far   Then 10 minutes later no stopped take order   place close empty busy all   5 minutes later decided just leave   As walking waitress apologized said she busy other customers which lie but  OK   Then walked away host said don't afraid $ sign Very condescending down right racist we only non white customer time incident    I going say something back but decided stoop down level   Awful place! AVOID! <EOR> This place some great decor ambience opinion  vibe stuffy which plus    The service below average though don't fault server because he seemed he looking more tables he should been    Our steaks party ordered three cowboy ribeyes among other things came all different temperatures despite ordering two mid rare medium  send back remade because way over cooked! did but just wish didn't happen way    The door also open which allowed stiff breeze restaurant  didn't ask them close but thought ironic hostess seemed space heater near her  knew cold!   It good food great company visually appealing restaurant  However simply average opinion factoring all together  <EOR> I ate husband since he's harassing past month surf turf    when passing place knew try it!  The environment very clean  Walls draped white tables set very minimally nice floral accents  menu quite small first time attending restaurant little talks back prices first  But realizing place really knows meats also located Downtown Summerlin figured then fitting  also live singer near entrance which LOVED  She good  I waived way husband made fun me    I ordered skirt steak $30 added shrimp scampi $15 3 pieces shrimp must say very impressed  meal came timely manner very good seasoning taste  meat very moist tender while shrimp charred grilled perfection    I honestly most impressed servers  all knowledgable when came cuts meat where cut animal  also give very vivid descriptions sauces dishes taste    The only reason gets 4 although experience memorable food really wasn't me  tasted great everything but wasn't blown away    Especially prices paid  definitely very nice date restaurant perfect night Downtown Summerlin  <EOR> We last June Father's Day high expectations  since  only Steakhouse Downtown Summerlin  steaks served cold improperly cooked  told server cook them medium then well done!

Unfortunately last nights dinner fell far short mark   started seafood tower which perfectly fine Las Vegas standards but nothing exciting   then moved onto steak tartar sea urchin toast   Both good tartar lacked flavor toast served grilled burned which distracted flavor   sea urchin very good would order again    The disaster came main course   ordered bone dry aged NY Strip   first arrived medium well  course returned steak when second came cooked correctly medium rare but meat absolutely no flavor all inedible   manager apologetic stated needed find new purveyor meat! Shocking dialed before opening! owners Elizabeth Kim attendance could see difference when opened Honey Salt   Maybe grow fast know Manager another unhappy guest before speaking us  room beautiful well appointed but service more importantly food lacking  cannot recommend restaurant think should remove steak name Andiron Steak Sea! <EOR> Absolutely impressed food  half bread boulle butter started meal weird didn't care it   We skipped appetizers ordered 8 oz rib eye cap I added 2 shrimp scampi 20 oz bone rib eye mashed potatoes grilled asparagus creamed spinach  ordered steak well done always do  asked if kitchen would problem making assured absolutely not  steak came medium  Lots lots pink lots blood  eat steak  UGH  send back  also ask where shrimp are  I'd eat those now while wait steak  Apparently forgot them came few minutes later  warm but cooked  other cool waaaaaay under  OMG serious?

I also tried some appetizers sides  french fries very good  Crispy outer soft mushy inner  sure if would come back just fries but order it  fried artichokes tasted well artichokes Quite standard  calamari underwhelming especially given price  Tasted similar would find any chain restaurant  mac cheese dish creamy cheesy enjoyed dish  cheese quality there   The drinks steakhouse pricing expect fork over some change enjoy shot Scotch   I did try bite 20 oz Cowboy ribeye yes tasty  Nice marbling smokey flavor very tender  Maybe ordered wrong dish   Service attentive but food took little longer expected  dessert creme brûlée donuts tasted sitting under heat lamp hour  <EOR> Had night family last night thought we'd try new Andiron Downtown Summerlin   rating 2 5 stars!  arrived early avoid any crowds 5 30 reservation   place pretty empty only couple other diners there   Upon arrival waiter asked drinks served them   He trouble listening understanding requests mother wanted ice juice didn't it   and he seemed question requests   sure going there   Anyway all decided pretty quickly wanted menu super limited no specials heat about   told 'the whole menu special'   Turn off!  husband salad meal ordered appetizer    He calamari   Upon arrival looked ok typical small round pieces some other larger flat pieces didn't look natural   He ate few pieces said something wrong it   He didn't enjoy all when came remove salad plate he told them remove calamari told them something wrong it   sat talked together least hour while waiting meals   getting obnoxious esp considering early arrived order in   Then when finally walked food only three plates apologized last steak order messed firing it   couldn't believe it   then lack attentiveness server long wait times place quickly becoming place would never visit again   made clear dissatisfaction server all time wouldn't bring all meals together but last quickly arrived   steaks good   Mine ordered med rare but rare disappointing   ordered asparagus none ends cut off last 3 each stalk inedible because stringy   husband ordered pork chop awful sauce top    it very bitter texture jelly   chop itself good   other steak really good fish dish   food wasn't all awful but service lacking bad surely doesn't want ever visit again   meals dessert menus dropped but didn't want any now 2 5hrs meal   Those menus sat table another very long time before anyone came back ask if wanted any    and wasn't even server   He never came back table again ask things as think he already knew      and just asked check could leave   personally never dine establishment again due horrible service wait times meal   PS   bring corn bread early hear good didn't any  <EOR> This beautiful restaurant great decor  Located ever growing DT Summerlin mall seems popular spot all those rich old guys want take out of towners impressive dinner     Service also overall quite good  Friendly slightly over talkative server but timing meal great except when slowed down bit end      I would almost give place 4th star just Mac Cheese Waffle    SO DELICIOUS cheese sauce   yum!  However remainder food impressive  good fresh ingredients well cooked however nothing really stood out  Yellowtail Crudo which fresh but nothing special Skirt Steak little over cooked medium meat only ok finished Ashley's Creme Brulee Donuts which sadly did impress any more krispy kreme donut would    Overall lovely restaurant food quality good  But value for price would still probably elsewhere  <EOR> Wow! First Friday night new Andiron pretty busy   normally don't try new place soon opening work kinks but couldn't  resist    Let's start atomsphere   gorgeous! Soothing colors yet hip vibe gave place very upscale but all stuffy feel some other high end steakhouses have   Elizabeth Blau stopped table herself commented didn't want other steak houses   nailed it!  The food   really amazing! Started fig burrata app   fresh breath spring   Light creamy   Waygu Skirt hubby Bone in filet   Both flavorful perfectly cooked  liked variety steaks preparations menu     Could leave without trying dessert   Lemon tart most amazing barely lime meringue carrot cake   moist fantatstic   just want more vanilla sauce though     I love restaurants where just food    its experience   Andiron just that  Its total package  an incredible experience   Congrats! <EOR> We came earlier month celebrate birthday  first impression place good  called month ahead reservation woman answered phone kept hold 10 minutes  mean really 10 minutes?? don't know if extremely busy night called but seriously she didn't even apologize making wait!

Located across Lazy Dog restaurant very nice clean  liked green white decor which calming  Service excellent attentive  server made good suggestions menu items all servers checked often never ask drink refills since keeping close eye everything   We started off Nueske Bacon Wrapped Matzo Balls which recommended server  first time eating matzo balls but thought alright tasted broth bacon  Didn't care horseradish came it  Next served complimentary shrimp cocktail  much say since tastes same no matter where but did come 2 jumbo shrimps! main course ordered Black Canyon Ranch Filet but wasn't impressed  tasted alright first but while didn't taste burnt steak  Guess really fan char grilled steaks! husband ordered Porterhouse which wasn't horrible but amazing  excited try mac cheese waffle but good looked  Kind salty side am glad them leave cheese sauce side because wasn't needed  Now best part dessert! Peanut Butter Pretzel Caramel Cheesecake very delicious! presentation very unique did look average cheesecake  also ordered Ashley's Creme Brulee Donuts which very good  donuts hot crispy outside creme perfect overly sweet   Overall enjoyed dessert more dinner! feel bad saying but would rather steak Outback  Don't think back but deserve 4 stars service atmosphere dessert! <EOR> As much want give place 5 stars just can't  Unfortunately only pitfall food  plate beautifully but enough  All 5 dishes bland  just tasted no seasoning  shame because sure pretty  know bland when caesar salad most flavorful dish thanks peppercorns   octopus fried chicken bao burrata prepared great but no taste whatsoever  decided skip dessert because figured would same    The decor stunning  service wonderful  Servers bussers hostess couldn't better trained  Pricey but good specials running  such romantic lighting you'd think they'd play more ambient music but ruin Nicki Minaj loud EDM  bet would sell lot more bottles wine if found lounge playlist instead  <EOR> Went 6th year Anniversary husband service great  server very attentive even greeted upon seating us  food delicious  really loved oysters avocado toast  prime rib dinner which very tender  Overall setting food great would recommend place if anyone birthday anniversary anyone wants really good prime rib  <EOR>
