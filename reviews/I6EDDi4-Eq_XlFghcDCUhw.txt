Starting beginning seated immediately being Tuesday evening things Strip aren't lively    wait staff very neatly dressed suits white linen napkins draped over arms   told specials even given recommendations knowledgable waiter   Let known he never tried sell push menu items which think very professional   We share caesar which nothing fancy   consisted normal chopped romaine croutons large thin slices parmesan all tossed very light caesar dressing almost similar vinigrette    seemed small portion even being shared size   My entree 12oz filet mignon which cooked perfection  medium   least 1 1 2 thick!  Todd ordered petite filet stone crab   first time Todd eaten stone crab he isn't quite sure all hype about?  While he own petite filet he also tried mine said think steak better  Overall entrees plated very nicely but kind lacked flavor     Our sides meals consisted of 1 pan roasted sweet corn  simple yet good 2 steamed asparagus lemon butter  needed seasoning bland 3 macaroni cheese  very good baked light crumb topping  I'm sure if I'd revisit Joe's simple fact number restaurants out flavor Joe's   But wish other restaurants Joe's caliber same top notch service! <EOR> Wonderful old school place  best soup crab bisque any ever had  Large portions  <EOR> I amazing time Joe's  seated right away reservation time greeted awesome waiter  staff very attentive date never felt neglected  petite filet mignon crab legs awesome! date ribeye he loved it  seasoning provide side great filet mignon  ordered four cheese mac cheese broccolini both mouth watering!

This particular location quite random very bottom floor Forum Shops Caesar's Palace  When walk leads bar area which seems kinda fun but mostly those enjoying happy hour  Dining area outside area where gawk shoppers back dining room where dark might just fall asleep     The food selection enormous  wine list long actually kinda intimidating specialty drink list looks interesting I opted Pomegranate Martini ended nothing but Welch's drink   Bread very good    offer different variations which nice touch but don't know could possibly serve 7 different kinds BAD bread?   We finally decided steak tails dinner $49 99 each  Lobsters small but taste truly decadent  Steak OK but little dry side  did see waiter debone fish another customer truly amazed! He literally every piece fish off bone record time seemed! Overall dinner 4 stars counting just food     So done eating took record 20+ minutes even flag anyone down clear table bring check  trying just anything servers attention but no avail  Finally sturdy 'EXCUSE ME' finally waitresses attention    Overall food good    but necessarily best service  Service should come standard prices but definitely Joe's maybe different Florida   <EOR> Great ambiance service food! Everything great except lyonnaise potatoes  fillet mashed potatoes fried asparagus mac n cheese  good! <EOR> My last experience exceptional decided bring some colleagues back particularly sample stone crab claws best known for   We variety dishes but only disappointment turned stone crab claws  waiter suggested large portion stone crab claw smaller size claws don't much meat each claw just wasn't all satisfying considering each claw costed close $12 ea just cold boiled crab claws  Perhaps high expectations better me  However think everyone thought entrees all quite good    The ahi tuna steak particularly interesting looked 2 thick filet  Also favorite key lime pie definitely very satisfying  <EOR> Great eating experience here  service food  Apparently famous chain Miami  sister in law's 40th birthday dinner  just comment ate   1 Appetizer Crabcake $16 00 very large split two ways delicious  2 Entree Lobster stuffed Sole fish assorted sauces  very very tasty while huge seafood fan more memorable fish eating experiences  3 Desert Compliments house brownie slice topped ice cream whipped creme birthday   well use your imagination tasted   Highly recommended apparently stone crabs top notch  <EOR> NYE specials world!
