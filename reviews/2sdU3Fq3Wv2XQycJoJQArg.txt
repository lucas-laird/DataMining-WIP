Service generally pretty good but sometimes those waitresses off days  <EOR> On December 24th CAME during scheduled pick up  wait HOUR  don't care if other people but when call tell food ready during certain time frame then ready certain time frame because lost time spend family because you      Cashier Waittresses slow  people waiting but wasn't line reached door  unorganized let tell very rude  can't speak tagalog but understand pretty well  could hear people expect when place order today Christmas Eve when order last minute etc   Hey let remind don't tell come over SCHEDULED pick time frame food ready  Perhaps wouldn't happened first place if planned right     place gone down hill  food ordered horrible  Very tasteless way greasy  Whoever buyer food doesn't know order  way going leave but called name really Christmas Eve dinner part entrees  NEVER coming back  <EOR> This reveiw catering food only  I recently anniversary party town chose food catered Salo Salo  walked into restaurant 3 00 PM Saturday surprisingly four parties dining in  But pick phone order items supposedly 15 people expected attend but somehow ended 25 30 guests staggered fashion   food still much  stuff large order meat only lumpia no veggies inside order skewered chicken beef pork fried seafood platter  whole Milkfish Bangus fried calamari rings fried shrimp fried mussel two whole fried eggplant garnish  meat lover's BBQ special platter chicken pieces BBQ bistec BBQ pork ribs  lechon kawali cubed seasoned fried pork crispy texture crispy skin Filipinos treasure served all purpose sauce large order pansit glass noodle pasta chicken shrimp pork  order ready right time promised  fairly well packed travel road  made sure crisply lumpia holes cover only 3 4 covered would vented properly all spill out   The food hit   Everyone included thought food tasted really good   two dishes didn't much lumpia which reminds institutional style food pansit which way much patis fish sauce taste  Guests brought some other stuff including lots white rice green salad steamed winter veggies   mom made some some homemade desserts bibngka baked casava coconut milk cake suman sweet rice brown sugar coconut milk mixture which baked topped brown sugar glaze creamy fruit salad some tropical fruit young coconut      Most Filipinos party including older adults fairly skinny average weight I'm getting gut however    food only half eaten two hours 3 30 PM dinner start time   finish food?

Chicken Adobo boneless chicken fillet sauce Terrific flavor different used yet positive change family's home cooking    Beefsteak Tagalog beef slices gravy sauteed onions Thicker gravy typical more watered down sauce onions expected hint salty fishy flavor it  bad new version dish   Melon Juice fresh cantaloupe strings juice love chewing fruit sipping juice same time!   Calamansi Juice Filipino lemonade Its tart lemon sweetness orange tangerine  don't scratch its concentrated but still citrusly refreshing!  I'm pretty picking when comes Filipino Food Overall food Good value fair service decent ambiance warm homey  <EOR> This always formal dinner destination family because formal dining setup   Price definitely more expensive places Filipino cuisines  higher prices justified fancier looking ambiance    Food Filipino eating Filipino food never new  Portion expect sit down restaurant excessive  Taste good but stellar  Quality would say nothing ordinary   Service there's normally wait time especially dinner  last time family took good minute deliver extra requests  can't blame 'em though  But definitely could better  OVERALL Say place average <EOR> Oh heck yeah fan   How wrong deep fried food? Rhetorical question   Please don't answer that   There episode Simpson's where Moe decides convert bar restaurant purchases military grade deep fryer  In scene show complete meal entree salad wine glass flower mini vase all sitting tray being lowered into scalding hot vat oil coming all crispy golden   That's had!

C'mon least give refill especially considering size glass    If review based food alone probably would've rated place higher  But service needs worked on  Some nights better others but most part service very slow  takes them same amount time your bill takes actually eat your meal    So if you're craving Filipino food even first timer great place course only if put horribly slow service  <EOR> One few filipino restaurants always visit every las vegas trip  Would perfect today if calamari well done    Maybe 5 stars next time  <EOR> Went Vegas family vacation uncles craving Filipino food  Thursday wasn't busy all  Parking easy easy find   Favorites Bagoong fried rice must have!

Well maybe white boy genetics prevented savoring same level seem to   While everything Salo Salo tasty found each dish did nothing more    We arrived earlier evening most restaurant ourselves   Service prompt sat front patio atrium its indoors    all prepared order San Miguel Beer which Filipino national beers when waitress informed some tragic news dont serve alcohol   recover stomach blow confusion selected coconut juice drink   fine but minimal size really appropriate compliment food going forthcoming     As food order Chicken Adobo   ordering going New Orleans having biegnet Hurricane drink   also ordered Palabok which noodles topped fish gravy then covered pork rinds   Finally some Vegetable Limpia which type spring roll    presentation all dishes pleasant but once dug noticed common theme          Salt!!!!!!  Salt critical component all cooking but when taste abundance feel its hallmark lazy kitchen   Rather expertly prepare array spices many kitchens just add salt give dish some flavor   kind felt case thats tragic because chicken tender juicy noodles expertly cooked   limpia fresh vegetables but all sauces accompanied dishes just way salty   See why beer would come handy now?  Prices all very reasonable portions generous   feel Salo Salo makings fine restaurant just need want take another level   Then again Filipino's know seem love why should change?
