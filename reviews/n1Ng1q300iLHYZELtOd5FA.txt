From remember last time came ordered BLT salad some nice applewood smoked bacon iceberg lettuce tomatoes avocado nice creamy bacon dressing  but overbearingly heavy considering avocado bacon  they put just right amount   I also surf turf options   For surf  lobster prawns   and Turf  kobe beef   or filet mignon   the meat nice tender   and nice selection rubs crusts well sauces paired w them  I highly reccomend bearnaise sauce  it's tasty! Also selection sides really yummy too   the hand cut crispy fries ridiculously good garlic mashed potatoes   I also location  it's new wing Forum Shops Caesar's Palace great view overlooking Strip  if reservations ahead time try nice spot over window  chic modern Japanese style restaurant  really cute inviting  a perfect place celebrate special occasion  or if win some big money Vegas  <EOR> Hit jackpot Vegas decided treat ourselves NICE meal    after researching options chose BOA view    or thought       the only true views outside patio   seating patio night       so view became table across mind       RATS!

nothing sepctacular  better calamari Sam Woo    So enjoying ourselves waiting food couple sat down 15 20 minutes received main course  looked over thought kind peculiar even though appetizers would receive main course before us  But let thinking maybe because ordered would take tad bit longer   Funny thing 10 minutes later see same young waiter come order slip look table next checking order slip front other table once happened knew given order wrong table  also could guess when saw woman other table porterhouse front saying she cant eat just saying she probably wouldnt order biggest steak menu   So wait wait wait  older waiter comes tells food way say okay thank you  Once again even though he stopped table he didnt notice drinks needed refilled    The younger waiter proceeds come looked chips topped some white cream sauce says its house  tell would rather proceed ask why taking gosh darn long food  He says messed order then ask if table next received order he tells honestly yes did   Two things pissed off first off could come right away explained situation instead making wait 20 30 minutes before finally letting know  Second thing dont give chips some stupid sauce think bamboozled gesture  Ridiculous    So time food comes its 30 45 minutes since finished appetizers  steaks okay nothing write home about  say porterhouse wasnt best cut apparently different interpreation medium rare is    A manager came later gave fake apologies told he would take care us  He took off steak which really didnt care about  would think if decided come somewhat pricey place wouldnt mind paying ate them take off steak did nothing   All all really bad choice part picking place  Might well choose place downstairs Joe's something  Would recommend place someone? No wouldnt steak average best service laughable  <EOR> The steak good but best Vegas  No complaints drinks appetizers  cannot really mess oysters half shell fried calamari  very extensive wine list knowledgeable sommelier  Only complaint Boa wait staff  no idea where ordered what  Very uncoordinated slow delivering entrees  Steak cold but still tasty  Don't Kobe Steaks  worth nothing special  taste more buttery rib eye steak  Ruth Chris's still best steakhouse opinion  <EOR> Picture Forum Shops Friday evening table one   When dining alone love sitting bar guys BOA just another reason why  Super friendly service great drinks steak want slap your gramma!
