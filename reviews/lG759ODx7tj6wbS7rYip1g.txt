Yum <EOR> If during lunch time ask see lunch specials! You're presented regular menu first which doesn't list lunch specials but wide selection food  ordered to go lunch menu which pretty good deal  ranges 6 8$ depending kind meat choose    If would suggest getting items noodles them seem more food entree wise  Pad Si Ew chicken Kung Pao beef  Both came spring  roll I think call Thai egg roll something though   Kung Pao came rice well but Pad Si Ew didn't which wasn't big deal since seemed more food anyways    They spice level 1 5 since first time requested 2 both dishes just safe  generally mild spice 2 wasn't bad    Overall think good place try but giving 4 stars because significantly less food Kung Pao beef Pad Si Ew  But all all good place eat would come again! <EOR> Good amazingly point!!!
