Worst experience ever!  Wish portion star because don't even deserve one   wait wasn't  bad Sunday morning but being shown table didn't see server almost 20 minutes   attention hostess she sitting other customers before could even say wanted she tells server right us   She must known!  Still took another 10 minutes server appear only put finger tell she'll right us   must've look face said you've kidding she DOES come take order   think GREAT now ok  No such luck  When coffee need sugar but isn't any table   Rather wait some more ask other wait staff sugar tell ask server   tell them she's non existant  Finally someone sees standing around nice enough some   Now we're waiting mimosas ordered     40 minutes ago     also want more coffee   When food finally arrives tell would more coffee also need more creamer would butter breakfast breads since both dry   Good luck that!  three requests?????? Once again ask other staff butter am told ask server   Good lord never aggravated breakfast restaurant   sad thing wasn't just us   All other tables around experiencing same thing   only thing could chuckle listening other customers around moaning grumbling!!! Oh more thing   serving tray stand feel onto floor path where everyone walks hostess STEPS over she's seating customers   does busser!  didn't pick move STEPPED over it  Crazy! <EOR> Wer einfach unkompliziert etwas zu sich nehmen ist bei Dennys genau richtig  24h am Tag geöffnet und alle Speisen werden serviert  Bedienungen sind sehr freundlich auch Sonderwünsche werden unkompliziert umgesetzt  Die Stärke liegt eindeutig beim Frühstück die Milchshakes sind allerdings auch sehr zu empfehlen! <EOR> Dennys food awesome  belive never leave feeling anything less stuffed full  all day breakfasts just amazing but big served huge side pancakes syrup!!! <EOR> It's first time Vegas check Dennys out  breakfast first day really impressed fast service food tasted good  build your own breakfast hash browns eggs bacon toast  next day again but food good  hash brown QUARTER size  thought we'd try 1 more time worse  won't going back  understand location only opened recently but need portion sizes sorted   Warning all brits  try 'grits' only ordered because seen TV movies  really disgusting  tell savoury porridge butter top  made both feel instantly sick  <EOR> I really love Danny's food!   Always fresh very clean! <EOR> The worse Denny's very rude employees very filthy  never eat again <EOR> The food good hostess front very good  She very entertaining watch  tell she loves job  seated quickly but food took long while else would gotten 5 stars  Recommend  <EOR> Absolutely love place   establishment new nice clean   Tamika Brenda two best waitress Vegas   funny nice   catered every need even enjoyed lot laughs jokes us   food great  <EOR> I all Denny's location until second visit  giving 2 stars first visit tackle both visits review   The first visit redeem free birthday grand slam all show your ID your birthday! wait looked going long but actually seated within 5 minutes which awesome  service good considering busy place was  food came expected friggin Denny's    don't expect much ha! server left receipt table paid cashier without problem  Nice quick breakfast    Our second visit another story  took while seated    but figured would  just hoped quick seating first visit  server eventually came over took order    which he nice but believe way much going attentive  When food finally arrived took while plate didn't look exactly look day before  potatoes weren't crispy liked mostly  pancake wasn't fluffy either  Seemed cooks rush  ate anyhow wasn't table complainers  took while server acknowledge empty drinks time he did time drop check  there's that  finally pay out   Now never really food poisoning entirely sure time frame but 2 3 hours eating worst stomach cramps all other symptoms according google food poisoning  ruined day  Again never experienced food poisoning before but something during 2nd visit didn't sit quite well stomach    beware  don't personally see myself returning  <EOR> Horrible service!  My toast came 30 minutes late reminder burnt  friend asked all bacon no sausage plate came all sausage  Scrambled eggs still runny    Worst Denny's experiencing ever! <EOR> We wait FOREVER food every time come no matter time day even if take order  However love Denny's food but aim different location! <EOR> I always stay Wynn Encore Denny's right next door  favorite place walk take care hang over  servers really great hardworking  food always hot damn good! am always happy friends  <EOR> We've sitting 45 minutes still haven't even gotten drinks ridiculous worst service ever Denny's located strip should able food fast efficiently haven't seen waiter 45 minutes <EOR> Worst service ever   Waited table 15 min no service bar took order 90 people running around but no carries <EOR> Over cooked bacon   Hard waffle   Slow kitchen waitress order wrong   brought scrambled eggs instead sunny side up   had exchanged   took another 20mins though <EOR> It absolutely dreadful   I seen read anyone else's review but experience first terrible time Denny's   Service really rude unprofessional   A group friends decided come during night understood would little crowded did bother bit    We seated down asked water which came asking twice  still nice well   Afterwards ordered pretty much waited entire time  No came even though ask orders three times  took 1 hour 20 minutes leave  ridiculous all other tables food some people served even came us    Anyways friend decided come next day time 65% empty yet made wait  many open seats friend waiting pretty long time already  also two other groups 3 4 people waiting well   We decided ask lady left because she only saw during then told stay seated very irritated tone  Well weren't helped all decided leave again   My advice? Don't come all unless want terrible service  actually another Denny's nearby one  much better  <EOR> I now standing since over 20 25 minutes waiting order placed approximately 54 minutes ago  told 15 minutes over phone  hover over front desk ask manager food  does take long 2 waffles some eggs  Unacceptable  coming again   Update manager just offered free dessert    but 30 minutes life wasted waiting waffles <EOR> Food definitely represent cultures!   I store twice row two girl friends  The only thing need order Bourbon Bacon Burger  good! <EOR> Worst place took hour 30 minutes sited   enough staff accommodate   suggestion take pice crap down build IHOP <EOR> If give place zero would  service terrible  waiter all orders wrong charged something didn't order  portions small food cooked right  Scramble eggs undercooked  would never fo back place  <EOR> We stopped should great meal   party 7 expected wait little bit   told 20 mins based many people waiting felt very reasonable   40 mins finally called then stopped woman said larger parties always asked wait 10 more minutes before being seated  some reason stuck around still seated that   walked biggest surprise happened   Nearly 75% restaurant EMPTY!!!  PLENTY seating plenty staff running around seat everyone waiting currently still waiting   Once seated food good but service mediocre best   definitely return particular Dennys EVER  <EOR> I don't usually review places Denny's reason never good service  BUT locations visited 4 times past year First two times amazed service food awesome  though myself because its Vegas Strip ? But most two recent visits last visit 10 2014 just sad  Server nice but food cold took 30 min seated management very helpful  love Denny's would come back but need improvement  <EOR> This second time coming since did renovations  place looks really nice  Unfortunately when walked wait but someone acknowledged sat down  Once seated 15 minutes waitress named Brenda came table asked if being helped  told no she apologized said take your order  Then 5 min later waitress assigned Olivia told she would right back smh  Thank goodness Brenda saving day because bout walk out  <EOR> It sucks  took forever take order  When finally did took forever table just left <EOR> Ordered chicken avocado sandwich slam here  Food cold sandwich didn't avocado cold  took them 30 min redo it  lost appetite point  Slam also subpar compared other Denny's to  <EOR> 4 5 stars? your minds?! last night pure desperation late  only healthy thing menu tilapia dish which wouldn't let order cos 'senior ' Am paying customer? cares old am?! anyway ordered veggie burger fries rushed back hotel  Why? Cos just couldn't sit any longer! waited food noticed humungous hair ball floor which kept blowing towards wind each time door opened  worse still no came clean until 20 mins! Ugh!! can't tell many times checked inside burger! Never again!! No more slumming Vegas  just worth it! <EOR> Nope!!!    While vacationing Las Vegas Nevada decided Denny's bite eat  word Denny's NOPE!!!       Horrible service  <EOR> Service good until actually sat down eat  took longer then expected  host name StaciLynn whom energetic but very slow  girlfriend seen mass load people coming having wait also wait pay food long  <EOR> It's Denny's food same all around usually   came 2am waitress very friendly   Usually find ppl don't care work but waitress friendly personable  Food actually better thought 2am! <EOR> How ca relate two encounters LV Dennys across Mirage   Both times service sucked   Food cold overall horrible experience iconic chain diner <EOR>
