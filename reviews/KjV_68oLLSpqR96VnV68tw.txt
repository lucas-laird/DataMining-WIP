Even James O  said he didn't tacos time around  perhaps culprit particular location? perhaps James O  only actually likes Roberto's when he's really drunk and or hungover? Bottom line where purchasing tacos  <EOR> There Roberto's very close house quite often  being said order almost wrong cooked correctly the tacos usually coated cold brown oil   If order beef taco chicken  If order bean tostada meat shell soft oily impossible eat  When complain staff NEVER apologized  save food until time return it  No apology no credit no nothing  visit last  <EOR> Fast food fast service  ordered chicken burrito assortment chicken beef rolled tacos  Both tasty prices very reasonable   The burrito brimming chicken peppers  Spicey but over powering   The rolled tacos came covered guacamole sour cream shredded lettuce shredded cheese   Filled didn't break wallets most places town  <EOR> This place horrible customer service!! once moved towards location messed order tried again chicken now today calling ahead ordering said would ready ten minutes when said no order placed!!

While most favorite late night dishes Super Fries Three Rolled Tacos Carne Asada Burritos etc  similar other locations difference little details   the hot sauce seedy spicy carrots always fresh crisp friendly staff always willing reasonable substitutions must pico for sour cream trade off California Burrito! MMMmmmm      <EOR> I coming years  breakfast burritos good  Today good  Skimped bacon potatoes quit cooked  Worst all people work always friendly nice  morning female waited very rude  May find different robertos future  <EOR> Rude! ordered taco salad soggy called tell them wasn't happy lady said come back she would refund me  Well when did lady rang described needed refund charged again!!!

Tho charge extra alpastor nachos  carne asada nachos case don't want extra charge sister always gets carne asada fries whenever she's town which good   tried chimichanga think also good  chicken beef burritos could better tho  tortilla bit hard liking   I don't recommend taco salad  ordered before 4 yrs ago shell burnt! haven't ordered again since then <EOR> Roberto's Decent fast food drive thru decently clean but nothing fancy  could lots if locations quick Mexican food  cashier seems nice bathrooms decent  <EOR> I'm huge fan Roberto's but over years location consistently worst area  9 years Roberto's only  given food poisoning chicken chimichanga   quality also generally lousy which weird since every other pretty much tastes exactly same kind point chain    You may wonder why I'd back place know sucks  say typical lazy American 24hr drive thru powerful draw    Got beef nachos shredded beef dog food consistency  yes convenient but you've warned  There's billion other Roberto's I'd suggest avoiding unless you're feeling super lazy  <EOR> I moved Vegas year half ago always heard much Robertos!  finally try see all hype about    started something super simple crispy chicken tacos must admit quite yummy! definitely going back! <EOR>
