Anyway placed order 8 pieces spicy extra crispy mash gravy rice beans young guy check askes 'for go' say please  put bag anyway just everyone else came us  guess aren't use customers eating 'in'    It seemed 30 minutes before food came many people left ordered did but finally came  Chicken hot temperature wise but spicey not! Crispy skin just fell off chicken leaving bare  moist good but chicken skin    Our sides red beans rice good but bit runny beans bit smashed but mashed potatoes good! biscuits also good    The place clean looks fresh hope service gets better! <EOR> First let say know Tuesday staff business levels!  line wrapped around almost gas station area two registers open 5 other employees    NO sense urgency guests taken care timely manner   fact watched guest called he didn't hear number called again nothing set aside   guest came he counter gave number instead reaching back getting order made wait another few minutes why?
