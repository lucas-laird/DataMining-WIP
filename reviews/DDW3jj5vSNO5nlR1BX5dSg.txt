Definitely agree Mia place terms food  name Mainland sounds should serving Hawaiian fusion right? serve wannabe noodle house crap  No appetizing rice plates but rice bowls??? WTF   I ordered Pad Thai portions bit small side size pad thai noodles   green tea served some trendy chemistry looking type tea glass  extremely hot green tea tasted bland   I'd rather Asia Noodle instead place  <EOR> Crazy decor!  Felt mushroom level Mario Sunshine   Service quick but food very blah   Entrees $15 20 each price pay much better food elsewhere considering availability Asian restaurants throughout all Vegas hotels   ordered two noodle dishes fishcake small plate all quite oily lacking flavor   Would back did satiate Asian food fix nor hunger  <EOR> Overpriced crap   This place tries way hard some trendy noodle house but fails miserably poor service terrible food awful stupid seating arrangement    My noodles lukewarm when them amount peanut butter put overwhelmed rest food it  noodles very basic find significantly superior cheaper noodle places Los Angeles    heck even San Diego!  Our waitress needed repeat orders few times before she it  Then still wrong! She also rude most time its didn't order anything  Everyone party order entree drink cheapskates there  soon ready leave just end experience could find anywhere  finally ourselves front pay real  hostess didn't even find unusual pay  No thanks anything   Also cheesy t shirts stupid slogans lame  Decor looked unique give but practical comfortable? Eh really  wouldn't say constant discomfort but its all style no substance   Only plus?

My sister stumbled upon Mainland while wandering around new section Palazzo shops   basically noodle house other Asian type dishes menu well    decor very sleek modern clean lines long bench seating   Friday afternoon close empty I think other couple eating along us   army employees ready eager serve us almost many I'd say   it little nerve wrecking having them stand around stare while ate   Once saw beef Pho menu sold   really wanted see if upscale place could Pho right   I'd say really did   surprisingly good   I impressed pleased   almost want say liked better ghetto hole wall place Pho San Francisco called Vietnam because Mainland quality cuts meat   Vietnam sometimes cant even tell if actually beef rubber bands floating around bowl soup   Mainland's pho true pho should taste ingredients top quality establishment clean trustworthy used when eating pho     I should mention sister hated soup she ordered first some sort grilled chicken soup she thought going chicken pho but ended having charbroiled chicken corn it   we sent back she soup ordered enjoying   All all I cant wait come back bring pho connoisseur boyfriend best friend show them good pho done nice restaurant   Also eager try some other Asian style appetizers menu looked tasty well! <EOR> Mainland good if don't really know good Asian food is  understand its fusion but find term more often used conglomerate strongest flavors Asian cuisine offer typically saltiest sweetest sourest etc  Rarely if ever used describe accurate enlightening combination cuisines  any case Mainland offered exactly fusion I'd expected  crispy noodle wonton soup which tasted great until half way through when body knew stop before sodium absorbed all water body shriveled up  if casino air wasn't bad enough hydration  Plus come SGV $14 bowl noodles ludicrous when hit Garden Cafe other such spot better version $5 95  Guess spoiled  co worker pork chop which served bowl when she asked knife fork gave butter knife  ahahaha    On side wontons soup pretty darn good unlike ghetto joints home all pork shrimp them  <EOR>
