This place totally sucks  took wife dinner stood door 15 minutes  No approached no offered seat nothing   The place dirty shit hole caters 3rd world crowd no idea cleanliness hygiene   If forced between eating stink hole cutting off own cock roasting over open fire Id rather eat dick   Its even worth 1 star but isnt choice 0 stars  <EOR> I don't even know where start  Maybe stained tablecloth? maybe decorations held masking tape? Oh know! fact wait half hour entrees! place looks gross inside food really superlatively awful  love Indian food because flavorful completely failed live expectations  Samosas which weren't awful Palak Paneer which literally almost no flavor all  add insult injury everything cold didn't any rice I guess you're supposed buy separately? Would nice know    service took FOREVER which totally understandable since other table entire place  The only reason place because mistakenly bought groupon thought other Saffron closer but if known going would just kissed money groupon goodbye BOTHERED  <EOR> We came mom's birthday dinner using Groupon deal  place far worst restaurant life  sure worst Indian restaurant encountered    The service crazy slow point nonexistent   literally  Everyone serving themselves water  family waited 50 minutes before cups water  Even then ask ourselves  Other tables straws   we never them  never refills either  appetizer frozen samosa fried 30 seconds  Ackkk    All dishes beyond horrible  always order chicken tikka masala tasted many locations tasted just tomato sauce straight can  Such let down  other dishes ordered also swallowable  Normally if don't finish food take to go  food    wasn't worth packing later if couldn't even handle fresh also never brought meal ordered yet already paid through Groupon  When asked given attitude told We'll see if time bring your dish   brought bill left end asking waiting 20 minutes  Such huge let down  service food both atrocious  Chaotic friendly certainly no yummy food here  Avoid Saffron all costs!!! <EOR> Food = 4 Stars Service Decor = 2 Stars  Lets start off good first  wife ordered shai paneer chicken tandori  paneer very good give lot money  People usually very stingy portions but more enough  masala sauce fantastic well  chicken tandori extremely flavorful moist  spicy side but still good  also ordered few nan bread tried masala tea neither disappointed    Now bad      Let say when arrived place weren't sure if right place since sign said Saffron but right next said Salon something  When entered looked prepaing party something which weird see spots sauces table   I think husband wife running place  lady very nice but husband took order never heard again  While eating smelled someone left bathroom door opened pretty sure wasn't curry  Also few flies really annoyed well   In all think food pretty good but really need little more appealing customers  good restaurant but fence if we'll back  <EOR> The far worst restaurant ever LIFE!! No service ALL let wait forever!! don't know why still business if even interested serving customers  only 1 miserable lady waitress seems lady boss she couldn't care less  place clean most time some kids seat you  once know mean am sure back! <EOR> It's never good sign when drive business parking lot empty  fair 5 30 p m  Super Bowl Sunday but still Indian Pakistani restaurant you'd think typical crowd might more World Cup less Big Game   It's even worse sign when see vinyl lettering window Indian restaurant reads Salon de Fiestas  sure enough walking into Saffron first time doesn't feel all cozy Indian restaurant  feels banquet room  Only two booths rest expansive room filled round top banquet tables chairs covered plastic little stage corner  COMPLETELY EMPTY   An Indian restaurant should smell dunno Indian food when walk in  place didn't  smelled     old folks' home  something  Something right  dead quiet there  even TV radio on   There person visibly working entire place middle aged woman helpful enough but very friendly  think she'd thrilled see even person let alone couple walk in  so  She kind just gestured toward whatever table wanted dropped off menus disappeared  Didn't ask drinks anything   The menu typical Indian fare prices average  ordered some favorites  veggie samosas pakora chicken tikka masala aloo gobi well some rice two kinds naan  same time host server whatever finally took drink orders  Sadly joint doesn't serve alcohol  hate when can't order good Indian beer meal   It took long time even drinks water iced tea which came appetizers  samosas OK  pakora weird  used pakora being similar tempeh  just vegetables dipped batter fried  more spongy batter balls diced veggies inside  Maybe they're more authentic don't know but sucked   The entrees solid  Nothing write home or um Yelp kind weak flavored but decent  naan good enough    We Restaurant com gift certificate use when lady first looked she said  us  She said because logo didn't print she thought missing image graphic someone else's logo  point NAME ADDRESS PHONE own business  She did eventually take discount off bill   Interestingly some point man child walked during meal heartily greeted assume he owner manager least which leads believe host server might wife  Maybe she grumpy she work herself while he watching Big Game something  he when first arrived might felt better  But way we're never going back which shame because literally walking distance house  <EOR> I groupon sat down order looked dirty menus owner watching big OLD tv dinning room Nobody place looked kinda didnt money maintain place   Told wife Kids LETS GO!!!! If dinning area looks bad only guess kitchen looks like  NO THXs sorry but if want customers need work your place put Guy TV back site       P S food might good just ran life before tried it    <EOR> I thursday evening no other customers  place smelled kind funny wasn't smell spices either  large place but no servers just husband wife I think   food itself ok but main dishes didn't come rice naan  order naan separately wasn't fresh all  restaurent think best avoid but might work being takeout place  <EOR> I'd give them 0 if possible! warmed precooked frozen food served it  samosas Deep jalapeño cheese samosas naan Deep well  Haleem tasted service just horrible  restaurant itself just laughable! Save your money else where!!! <EOR> FYI review exclusively lunch no clue dinner but review lunch place definitely more focused banquet hall attached service guests lunch popped infor lunch buffet which basically table some banquet sterno heated trays some mediocre indian paki cuisine  service didn't exist ask everything  only reason writing review give naan bread thumbs but for everything else MANY other options available area skip place lunch option if pop just some naan  <EOR> We Friday night around 6pm  no other patrons but decided give try based recommendation  service friendly   Ordered two dishes  Took awhile but tasted pretty good  <EOR> Saffron am mad you   Although some months since last visit *still* dream your outstanding shahi paneer  truly best city loathe admitting given awful time husband both visits your restaurant   The first visit didn't even food just glimpse come  showed during prime dining hours opened door shooed away because restaurant banquet hall being used private event  No please come again  sorry just busy bewildered demeanor someone wanted away   But just hint horrible service we'd encounter second visit husband already detailed uncharacteristic but necessary length review here  only reason adding own review because time uploaded some photos Yelp rave comment shahi paneer praise just can't stand without some qualification   All food least decent if maybe little unusual but some tastes just matter preference but shahi paneer just incredible  Oh miss it   But never never ever back Saffron  somewhat dingy times outright dirty decor could just forgiven the food good but service unspeakably slow waiting hour no exaggeration check almost empty room already turtle paced meal absent weird rude despite wistful jonesing sublime incarnation favourite Indian dish just can't risk even slice previous experience   Maybe changed but never know  work short drive away could easily phone take away order well advance but even if could guarantee nothing would wrong treated poorly principle can't justify ever giving establishment money again  pretty sure very worst restaurant service ever life nearly into cage fight waiter Gonzalez y Gonzalez back 2001    Nope never again  Let most delicious shahi paneer Las Vegas grow cold congealed just worth it  <EOR> I may worse experience restaurant Saffron but if did can't remember it   We misgivings soon saw restaurant its empty parking lot neighborhood wasn't very nice  However since Groupon expire in  room dimly lit enough couldn't see stains tablecloths chairs   We amused when then lone server tried turn lights centerpiece table only discover batteries dead  also laughed decorations held masking tape  Less amusing more annoying television set blasting Indian movies music videos loudly corner  obviously satellite broadcast point must satellite problems picture sound kept freezing  no point did seem occur staff turn down until problems away   We ordered appetizers sodas entrees  appetizers took little bit time come didn't drinks until appetizers came  appetizers okay but then came long long wait entrees  I should point only table occupied restaurant busy all  food bland flavorless cold didn't come rice which served every other Indian meal ever had   Not only food bad service slow nobody ever came check see doing  Probably self defense measure insulate staff complaints  flag pre teen server down check even then wait least five minutes while another pre teen totaled next table using pocket calculator   It's worth pointing only because groupon expire  A Groupon only purchased because mistakenly thought Saffron Tenaya  While two other parties came both because Groupons  surprised didn't any customers willing pay full price certainly won't going back  <EOR> There's another review which describes Saffron's interior being more banquet hall Indian restaurant concur completely  When arrived around 8PM Saturday large rectangular building empty exception two other pairs customers round tables main part room  Down side four half booths although only two appear available customers having computer set upon other outfitted pair mismatched padded office chairs appears used hangout proprietor's children when aren't helping restaurant   After being instructed small child just sit anywhere took open booths another child brought menus  covers looked slightly grubby could used wipe down noticed large stain side booth next door ours looked someone spilled large glass coke over side table point allowed set before washing  Chairs tables covered plastic ward off such spillages plastic top table felt could little cleaner also could salt pepper shakers which felt little grimy when moved them   The restaurant bit odd little raised section corner opposite door 1970s disco ball middle room  disco ball just mystery expected see four children Chronicles Narnia file take places four throne like armchairs upon curious dais any moment  unusual atmosphere   After few minutes host arrived jug room temperature water shrink wrap covering top  He collected central tables which home collection such jugs  He seemed very friendly however quickly accepted restaurant com certificate enthusiastically took order  order meet $35 requirement ordered Chicken Tikka Masala Malai Kofta Shahi Paneer selection Naan two garlic sesame    Our host then presented some pappadums usual chutneys tamarind mint  mint chutney nice kick although tamarind uncharacteristically odd ketchupy taste mellowed into pleasant aftertaste all worked out  cheerfully informed could ask more pappadums if liked host departed commented wife friendliness enthusiasm enough overlook some oddities place upcoming Yelp review   Despite fact very few others restaurant didn't see any staff again forty minutes took food arrive  wasn't bothered all longer average wait time food more made anyway  Chicken Tikka Masala little milder am used however very nutty savoury Shahi Paneer perfect accompaniment  found garlic naan tasty without being amazing but wife found sesame naan little overcooked bottom  Malai Kofta somewhat different other incarnations dish experienced  sauce tasted more onion butter sauce creamy but tasty however kofta themselves dark somewhat sharp flavour fell pieces merest touch eating utensil  Overall though food excellent couldn't wait return expected award restaurant four stars disclaimer slightly odd vibe place maybe friendly suggestion wipe bit review   This where things took turn worse  medium sized party entered restaurant placed orders just enjoying last bites sauce dipped naan also appeared couple take out customers  host asked everything enthusiastic responses disappeared into kitchen   I credit card politely sat table waiting deal bill  Twenty minutes later still waiting  Ten minutes later asked child if could ask someone help bill  Twenty minutes passed surly woman came but deal takeout customer  child still clutched bill restaurant com certificate  Finally hour waiting finally dealt could lamenting could driven across town home TWICE time waited pay meal   The food great but being made wait full hour no exaggeration pay including 30 minutes TELL THEM want pay just unacceptable especially when least three adult staff members custom slow  <EOR> We've eaten few times private parties etc food overall ok  really Nehari  tastes should bland etc  Roti naan fresh but sometimes feels don't use enough dough  paper thin middle paper  Chole also good well kheer    The ambience restaurant great  Nice setting etc    Not bad place eat  won't blown away taste food but won't disappointed either  <EOR> I hoping 4 stars dining experience before but let say visit awarding them 3 generous  Seriously   The interior classic indian restaurant aesthetic but obviously old qnd unkempt  reviews establishment bit harsh but aren't far off   considering service  may well none  slow weeknight still took forever just everything  feel bad bashing them because did few things right but honest  water tastes awful  two sips before realized couldn't drink anymore  God only knows hell put there   The tables tilt chairs practically falling apart  condition place pretty sad actually but remained open minded possible review food  The appetizers arrived seventy minutes ordered  waitress continued apologize delay while politely said no big deal  actual appetizer shami kabob OK  bit dry singed side  chutney bit runny obviously watered down  ordered chai tea see if could some authentic spicy tea satisfy craving  couldn't  god awful  watered down plain lipton tea bit dairy creamer it  did taste least bit authentic chai tea should lukewarm best  main courses passable  tandoori chicken juicy spicy enough enjoyed girlfriend i  Sizzling onions always compliment dish well  seekh kabob nothing impressive  you'll better luck Kabob korner Fremont street  biriyani wasn't bad but much better  least loaded decent amount meat  Naan right but pretty hard screw up  entire dining experience fraught delays took over 2 half hours  Thank god happened groupon which made grand total $5    service charge included  Well worth inconvenience such steal but cannot good conscience recommend three ring circus restaurant full price until some major improvements service quality  <EOR> Its fine dining but its good  food tastes home cooked Indian meal  owner wife very kind  Everytime around 2pm ish wife does cooking serving service does take little while  biggest disappointment Palak Paneer spinach paneer cheese  worst thing there  chicken tomato cream sauce rice favorite  <EOR> I wish listened negative reviews  fact  GENEROUS   We initially seated young child  No  Wait  picked own table  selected booth fewest stains table cloth  She brought beverages ice cube each  Yup  ONE  say offer Coke products but tasted Diet Rite 2 liter opened first thing day   15 minutes later she finally swung back around take order  Oh only other active table place mind you  Over FORTY FIVE minutes passed before finally served entrees  gave plenty time look around restaurant  Box tape holding decorations  disco ball focal point some streamers around room  TV far loud but probably should grateful made easy keep unflattering comments contained table  refused use restroom there   Finally meal arrived  Chicken Karahi nothing but SMALL bowl chicken breast swimming Frank's Hot Sauce  Seriously  Frank's brand  I'd more 2 days prior  other entree Mixed Tandoori Combo Delux  Everything dry impossible enjoy  except sauteed onions  Those good   We offered refills near flat Diet Rites any point  starters gone  glasses empty  during meal  even ADULT server brought entrees blinked empty glasses  even checked see if needed anything any concerns food  finally sitting empty plates front THIRTY minutes far longer took eat it almost hungry again  But more importantly wanted check could something drink  No sight  cook  server  child  No one  called restaurant table  refused answer phone  Finally woman bluetooth headset peeked around screen kitchen looked square eye saw wave attention  promptly turned around never seen again   Never dine and dashed  but highly tempted evening  Eventually child came around asked check  Finally! Some acknowledgement  thought  chef possible owner owner's wife came around discuss issue another the ONLY OTHER table attempted attention tell he ready check Groupon  ignored   It finally took child TEN MORE MINUTES deliver check table  When pointed groupon she wanted take phone her  didn't allow happen an iPhone probably most expensive thing establishment ever seen   telling credit value Groupon against check because explain weird terms conditions restaurant put Groupon finally just let credit 'value' Groupon against check Which did work restaurant's favor could hell out   My message hungry public eat here  restaurant doomed saved  shady part town service HORRIBLE pricing line portion size quality   My message owners Stop  Save money credit left close your doors  Your chef seem only cook dish time  caused excessive wait time mysterious phone order caused excessive delay preparation meal another table four  no possible way your staff restaurant's infrastructure support full house  which exactly need survive  But going happen  Gordon Ramsay can't even save now  <EOR> As 12th September establishment closed good   Update September 27th   Received message someone runs saffron saying its still open asking  sure information correct before put public   date mentioned above day saffron during lunch time found no cars parked parking area doors locked chain lock without any sign stating whether still business back not  Hence review place    Either way seems still open  change rating because fact drove away strip hoping lunch found closed without any sign saying reopen ever    Saffron really wanted give try 5 days stay Vegas  But maybe next time  <EOR> here few many reasons business closed 1  Dirty dirty dirty tables chairs floor 2  Service 0 no welcome find your own seating 3  no water asking anything drink 4  long wait front desk even no people  5  RETUND HOME ANGRY NO FOOD!!!   PLEASE DON'T BUSINESS IF CAN'T  PERFOM CUSTOMERS <EOR> The waitress daughter owner  Probably twelve most  Did ok job guess  But very unprofessional she sweatshirt  None tables sat balanced kept tilting  food itself barely decent  Tolerable but nothing write home about  friend restroom almost left based off guess good  Many cleaner better food Indian restos Vegas  <EOR> Mediterranean mexican fusion?
