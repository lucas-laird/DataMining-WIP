Ill give another chance <EOR> Food A OK but bumping 4 stars just because service good overall experience awesome! great place group dinner  Everything ordered good but nothing really stood me  Karaage little dry probably wouldn't recommend one  skewers liked chicken skin shishito peppers best  Typical izakaya food perfectly beer sake  did enjoy uni spoon though! Nice little treat ended meal bowl tonkotsu ramen am only loves ending meals hot soup? again good but nothing amazing  Ooh black miso cod really tender! <EOR> Randomly scrolling through Facebook night last week saw suggested post pop Izakaya Cocokala  getting ready celebrate 1 year anniversary share celebration offering 50% off all ramen day day anniversary date  Being haven't best reviews year being open never really came into radar but wasn't going turn down trying some new ramen Abraham    IC fairly small restaurant  When walk there's limited seating sushi bar handful tables   and  it  also two small tables kind hidden back guess overflow private parties  bit dark inside restaurant but clean pictures pretty much all menu items hanging walls throughout it    Their menu which seems updated some point during last year according friends prior ton different offerings  Most items tapas style but there's also some meals lot single skewer items  specials board changes regular basis well  great feature IC give nice little bowl complimentary edamame enjoy while browsing menu   Since mainly ramen kinda refrained ordering much else  Although just couple bucks couldn't resist trying wasabi chicken skewer some bacon wrapped asparagus  chicken decent enough want try some other ones future visit but missed trying asparagus since son scarfed them up  Guess means they're good too!  Their ramen choices somewhat limited but offer style never seen before  actually ended having noob Google Tsukemen Ramen is  call 'Red Impact' but sets style ramen apart dipping ramen  Basically all classic ramen items noodles bean sprouts meat eggs etc side plate then give separate bowl broth dip in  actually little more pricey $6 50 50% off but worth every cent  broth more sauce obviously right? visibly oily but ended being good thing  chose Level 1 4 possible heat levels while personally could level decent amount heat  broth all little salty tad sweeter side but flavors mended together very well  Because bit thicker more oily noodles other items seemed really soak flavors well  only thing might downfall some quite easy sip take spoonfuls standard ramen broth  Overall thought excellent bowl ram wouldn't hesitate spend full asking price $13 it    The service decent but little strange me  arrived 10 minutes before friends even though place nearly dead felt kind being rushed  constantly looked asked if wanted order stuff before rest party arrive  Then throughout rest meal servers stood 5 feet table just kind stared other tables  all staying top things but maybe back off creep factor tad    I know said before but due limited amount decent reviews IC wasn't really radar  seen Facebook past sure would ever way eat but glad did  ramen alone enough warrant return visit rest menu just looks interesting pass up  shall meet again IC! <EOR> Nice little Japanese restaurant awesome food awesome sake  quite frequenting place cause gf love Japanese food  If ur mood Japanese food want avoid Ichiza type ambiance nice relaxed restaurant spot  Price reasonable service way above par  Miyuki manager above beyond  Open really late which always good J's Sake Bar next door always hit if u wanna try many different flavors sake <EOR> This place freaking delicious!!!! can't stop coming here  Try Japanese Tomato! <EOR> Went midweek meetup dinner when arrived didn't reservation but able still accomodate   9 people party separate checks   Food just ok orders came different times then order placed   waiting awhile mine happened come split up    order wasn't complicated veggies first then skewers later   All ordered stir fried veggies thunderbird chicken bombay shrimp iced green tea   Ran tea ask water  When ordered dessert seemed slow but better dinner service   Lastly when getting bills process them took long mistakes some orders couldn't reprint receipts   Don't feel food service worth price paid good experience large group don't think return  <EOR> Great service Jonathan ! grill chicken cartilage beef tataki bacon wrap mushroom gizzard just few great appetizer ! Definitely  will come back good friends great food ! <EOR> Great food great service! Jonathan server excellent very attentive! food price point!
