Remember when management position should respect your customers lead example  If employee sees type involvement customer maybe manager needs quit find something else less customer oriented  <EOR> I love Asian market come alot  always busy  deducted 2 stars because #1 isles narrow knowing where line starts when your ready check out  #2 sometimes fruits veggies hit miss kinda thing freshness  Oh food court pretty good  <EOR> They've bad customer service  Filipino food don't wrong only if improve service  happy come back  <EOR> Finally new filipino market west side!
