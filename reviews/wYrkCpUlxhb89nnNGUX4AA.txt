I just finished dinner wife mother in law  all raving amazing meal  staff extremely helpful every dish ordered extremely fresh delicious  highly recommend restaurant! <EOR> You know place bad when best thing ate all night chicken wings!   Started meal Japanese Street Corn    Actually fairly decent but I'd take real Mexican Street corn elote over excuse any day    With corn kurobuta sausage skewer should called smoked frankfurter piss poor excuse condiments    Some brown green red powder sea salt! Next wife's tempura udon   No lie linguine fat doughy udon noodles we're all used to  broth taste brown water completely tasteless    tempura coating actually point though    Wow snow crab fried rice  Next udon worst dish night  Came soft scrambled egg worst excuse crab meat seen restaurant  Again completely bland tasteless!  The worse thing place though service  Took forever drinks food came slow needed new haircut time meal done  place Eaters Top 38 should ashamed themselves don't know inept child awarded them status but seriously lost respect    Half menu unavailable due bad meat delivery  owner telling only serve freshest food send meat back  Yet they're still serving bulgogi he claimed marinated daily chicken wings foie gras which joke   Cmon guys    KJs Kitchen same parking lot some above average Chinese Food    place wack! <EOR> Great food service  Cozy ambiance  Miso soup ingredients fuse perfectly  Japanese sweet corn hot grill very buttery intense flavorful  Snow crab fried rice light comforting   October cargo good but wish more saucy kinda dry side  Thai chicken wing world  Overall food awesome would come back try other exciting unique dishes  <EOR> This place sophisticated super high quality Asian food  Everything great tapas size try bunch  Highlights include King skewer uni scramble  <EOR> Everything Asian tapas place very good  raw plates fresh tasty  chicken wings perfect  Crispy juicy plenty flavor  also nice selection beers small wine sake List  <EOR> Came some friends  Very surprised  best meals long time  Best things curry shrimp multi variety chicken wings shu mai oysters Brussels sprouts mushrooms  Everything great  Service excellent very friendly  Owner very nice  Definitely coming back!

But again am surprised done since changed ownership sometime mid 2016     The new owners retained chefs menu but decided jack prices la carte started offering pricey buffet   also did away ultra popular Happy Hour which drew crowd   Big mistake!  Lesson 101 if want charge Strip pricing Chinatown location catering primarily locals you're setting yourself failure   Don't let crowded restaurant fool into charging higher prices quick profits   Stick your basic you'll survive crash burn many other local restaurants Vegas  <EOR> my wife came anniversary dinner  food service great but maybe because 4th table there  dont know when its busy but hope food stays consistent   did AYCE $24 99 each <EOR> Service awesome! Food great!   Came dinner  had    Seaweed salad good  Street corn amazing  Should definitely try   Oxtail fried rice really yummy  Tempura udon soup really good!

Bam!  Things looking up!  chicken wings came next  server allowed split order try 2 different flavored wings   Tebasaki Thai chili wings   Hands down favorite Tebasaki  Thai just flavor preference but wasn't bad    With first 2 dishes down and round applause decided stay order more! ordered fluke sashimi special even confidence staying finish dinner honest say weary fish would par  let down!   fluke tender fishy good fought over last piece!

Another unique item 3 foot meat tower additional $4 per person   didn't try occasion seemed much 2 people but next time friends    The concept definitely needs some fine tuning though   give check mark list where your selections hand over your server   great however didn't good amount items ordered   heard same thing happening other tables also definitely problem   Since no suggestion box anywhere use platform hopes read yelp reviews   Perhaps having list carbon copy kitchen stays table then server delivers items cross them off both lists opinion would much more smoother dining experience then 4 stars could turn into more 5 star review    Again great concept nice atmosphere definitely come back  <EOR> Awesome restaurant great sake!
