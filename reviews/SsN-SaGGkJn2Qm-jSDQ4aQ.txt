well priced quality  no kids menu but if think pasta dish half order tikes  Other just simply lackluster service  Drink glasses routinely hitting sitting empty only seeing waiter once food arrived etc  table next seemed VIP treatment place may 5 star experience if guy   Literally management going over table multiple waiters greet guy   Well never seen before don't places pay prices same kind service?

He clearly knows he's doing back next time we're Vegas  <EOR> This looked such nice place dine right next fountain  Looking price expected fine dinning however experience nothing short complete joke us! wife ordered Chicken Piccata ordered best dish Linguine Fruitti Di Mare  Both dish also most expensive thought going something great    Our server horrible she never smile even said name was  turned series neglect just bad service  ask three times lemon water  Brought bread pour little olive oil into dish started walk away  Thus ask some vinegar which she finally another table third request  Then ask napkin silverware did any table    By time inform manager server may overworked much handle  manager apologized however service only worst  ask refill coffee each time  would think basic customer service keep coffee cup full especially since cups clear glass    To top off great server managed drop beer bottle empty chair table which beer wife new shoes  manager later came over said server told just happened  He tried apologize only made joke lucky wasn't wine  He did offer desert but didn't want take any chance another disaster!   Well finally bill noticed no comp discount  Actually when server brought change back she said round off bill guess did price reduction eight cents! Despite all wanting leave penny tip decide lower myself instead giving usual 20+% gratuity gave around 17% could still feel good could say still gave fair tip since mother server many years hard work     One final note food fine dinning but rather okay  Guess need really check Yelp now before choosing where eat definitely before dinning out! <EOR> Great place stop rest your feet while people watching having great meal inside Caesar's Stores   delicious seafood spaghetti righteous Florentine steak  worth great meal view best things mall! <EOR> We stopped lunch meeting family East coast   told hostess wanted order happy hour menu she told physically sit bar many empty bar tables   Ok if  policy but seemed strange   seated then told bartender clearly unhappy work needed wait five minutes before ordering she would charge regular price again just seemed odd   Among group ordered frozen Bellini way sweet good all Trevetini awful cloyingly sweet artificial taste lemon martini ok but VERY sweet beer in bottles hard mess some mixed drinks very little alcohol but ok    We ordered each happy hour bites think   mostly ok but tasted frozen then heated up   calamari pretty good but sauce served stone cold possibly intentional?    meatballs pretty good well tasted grocery store quality frozen meatballs   stuffed mushrooms decent but oily   chicken sliders good tough chicken oily breading awful      Then when second bartender asked if wanted anything else replied No thanks she seriously threw bill it folded glass front us stomped off   wasn't crowded wasn't anyone waiting seats still drinks which half full front us   Very odd    Overall food adequate but service appalling   laughed off time but now wish asked manager truly awful service  <EOR> Celebrating 30th Anniversary decided awesome place  Food ambience service 5 star     <EOR> NOTE While Trevi Italian restaurant am reviewing gelato stand side establishment please consider dessert review independent restaurant never eaten before   Situated inside Caesar's Palace Forum Shops vivaaaaaa Las Vegas Trevi's gelato welcome surprise discovery   first might notice hidden around corner main restaurant but gelato molto squisito!

Really Enjoyed ourselves  celebrate little sister 25th Birthday all way orlando Fl! tops due being many restaurants Vegas  <EOR> Very very solid choice meal cocktails snacks  husband just arrived town found ourselves Caesars Palace Casino  starving but everything inside casino very high end  ventured inside Forum Shops area stumbled upon restaurant   menu looked good prices moderate decided give them try   We very happy meal  First all yourself favor sure you're seated patio still indoors but same feel which overlooks Fountain Gods also wonderful people watching!   menu rather large lengthy many Italian favorites  always famished wanted order everything  Thankfully server warned portions large suggested against ordering appetizer since ordering frozen Bellini salad each ordering full sized entree    So glad listened because came basket most delicious bread olive oil  Mmmmm don't skip that!  Caesar salad good but way much dressing tossed with  skip share  ordered Gnocchi Modenese  While rich delicious few bites understood why server warned portions  gnocchi pieces butter well ricotta potato stomach let know couldn't handle any more bites closed business lol! husband Ravioli Alla Vodka cheese filled ravioli vodka tomato cream sauce  Again delicious but way filling  honestly should've ordered 1 salad entree share but hindsight 20 20!
