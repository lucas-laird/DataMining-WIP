I'd avoid Fiesta Texas head Santa Fe because buffet better cleaner hotel nicer  <EOR> Breatfeast buffet best Good service really low price  Can't price fresh fruits made order omelets  To rush must early when opens  <EOR> Stayed hotel groupon offer came lunch breakfast    Well buffet really cheap can't expect much place  food very bad quality just really tasted horrible  opinion worse hometown buffet any mediocre buffet    Even eggs breakfast soggy gross  anyone mess scrambled eggs??  didn't even finish plate bad    If truly desperate food don't much money then come here  Otherwise somewhere else  <EOR> Not impressed buffet  Price wise pretty reasonable but personally still don't think its worth money me  all means please let stop going  just more variety better tasting food  best thing found prime tube even though lot flavor  <EOR> My first time very mediocre experience   The cashiers super nice engaging complete genuine smile   My hostess completely different  No personality though polite  hungry wanted start checking food asked hostess if she could ice tea   She told order when your server comes  tone voice resonates  job Woah  Guess hates job   I stood table server arrived order drink grub on   Everything looked ok nothing really stood eye popping most people eat eyes   The BBQ Hamburger station average  grabbing some mashed potatoes beans when Customer next asked fresh baked chicken  chef pulled big metal tin assumed sitting warmer looks chicken looked chicken sitting awhile    Skip roast chicken    Next segment Asian offerings  There's build your own Pho  2 huge rice pot warmers white rice other fried rice  love fried rice grabbed bowl opened pot   Yikes! quickly closed because looked mush vegetables  Skip fried rice   There's Mexican station didn't look very promising  ore made tostadas quesadillas but look tortilla topping dried crusty   Moving on     The carving station looked great! turkey breast roast beef meatloaf   Meatloaf?  new   I asked piece meatloaf roast beef  chef gave such thin slice meat loaf crumbled plate   I asked politely if could another piece   He did same thing sliced thinly loaf crumbled plate  Now small pile meatloaf mess  Unbelievable   My roast beef slice thinly sliced well  should just serve deli meat find new chef knows properly cut piece meat   Their dessert selections probably most impressive part buffet offerings  Even salad bar looked depressing   I sat table eating few things thought good  would mac n cheese select vegetables meatloaf crumbles piece fried chicken au gratin potatoes hush puppies   Actually hush puppies mush but tasty mush   The whole time sat table server never came back check me   My final summation don't eat here  purpose    Honestly if F B manager would embarrassed even offer operate place this    I hope read saved your life Un WOW experience  <EOR> For some reason really Feats buffet Santa Fe Station   My wife vegetarian really HATES place those don't eat meat might want avoid   The food seemed bit tastier some other station properties really enjoyed Asian section  also very good price particularly coupon  <EOR> I don't think back anytime soon food Asian counter hard beening under heat lamp long dipping sauce spoiled aka sweet sour  <EOR> As card carrying members Station Casinos won free buffet coupon only good four day period  stopped previous day line long turned around walked out  guess weren't only ones free buffet  time line much shorter only few parties front us  few minutes realized line moving  stayed virtual stand still good fifteen minutes  No movement whatsoever  When finally close enough register see going cashier Maria shuffling through looked stacks receipts coupons ignoring customers line  Finally another employee Glenda came register told Maria she could ring some people while Maria continued look whatever important losing money people walking away  Maria declined continued stand right front register looking  looking looking all while ignoring customers line  Glenda tells again ring some people while look  Again Maria declines looking all important piece paper  Throughout entire ordeal Maria did once acknowledge customers line  Finally she appears ready ring up  Mrs  hands Maria coupon casino card money  Mrs  Also gives drink order adult beverages included  Maria then turns away starts looking through papers again  Finally Maria rings but forgotten drinks bonus points come cards  Maria then comes Mrs  attitude tells didn't order drinks  When eventually made seats asked speak supervisor  Glenda showed table  Yes same Glenda told Maria she would ring people only ignored  Glenda apologized acknowledge Maria's attitude disregard customers but stated she did want reprimand front others  Glenda assured she would address it    You would think casino claims love locals would put huge emphasis customer service  see absolutely no reason excuse Maria's attitude poor customer service  buffet would expect par normally rolls out  However having all over would forgo experience pay full price elsewhere  time worth much more free buffet definitely could gone without attitude poor customer service  fact Glenda stopped table took time listen complaint along assurance she would address saves being star review  <EOR> I expected lot more casino resort  Place wack  came lunch buffet cheap 11 bucks all eat but u u pay for  <EOR> Just another below average buffet casino   Item 1 Rewards person down isles asking white people line if needed rewards card while ignoring colored people meaning blacks browns  hispanic friends black extremely disgusting watching going America now days   Item 2 People buffet line comfortable disregarded personal space   Item 3 Sat back next staff entrance bathroom exit if weren't any other tables available  checked    Item 4 waiter simply took drink order fulfilled never came back check us  ones call over other waiters several times order refills napkins  Mind only party 4 Item 5 noticed when friends family relatives came he every beck call  trying mean but don't think employees supposed wait acquaintances    This concludes today's review  won't coming back establishment   Oh hope switch bacteria infested rag use clean seats tables  <EOR> Not good expected   Food bland meat tough   Server good but seemed rushing us <EOR> The food quality gone downhill over last 5 years price gone up  customer service management sucks  might well talking AT T rep trying problem fixed  just don't care  Also sure early cutoff times  10 people front pay 3 35 made cashier 4 02 said sorry prices 4pm  cashiers always super slow always problem someone paying takes 5 10 15 minutes   taking buffer off list  Redrock better quality food  started closing 3pm 4pm if

less $10 lunch buffet  All eat prime ribs shrimps Saturday night  <EOR> Good buffet price   Aliante slightly better   Great place pig if very hungry   Good selection   crayfish Friday nights    not good Orleans  come back again  <EOR> When comes Las Vegas eating Buffet must   But please expect buffets everything   Not all them Alaskan Steamed Crab Legs  Not all them serve Mongolian BBQ   Come think need compose top 20 list Las Vegas Buffets think should rank best worst   The Feast Buffet Santa Fe Station good decent service good decent food even Beef Brisket  prefer Feast Buffets Red Rock Station Texas Station  But if extreme Northwest area Las Vegas i e  leave city check Feast Buffet great selections good decent food  <EOR> Kindof pricey but crableg night  Only thing don't eat

Idk    seems weird your own food but whatever reason bring drinks?  The food actually pretty good    impressed  just really hard time getting over drink thing   All all however if Vegas again I'd probably give place another shot  If different server think experience would 4 5 stars  <EOR> OK Station Casino club member it's FREE readily admit least two buy free buffet coupons just every month for very little slot play time might add    save some duckets fam often choose Station Casino property value breakfast lunch dinner   penny saved folks!
