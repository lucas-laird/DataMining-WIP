Well come it! The restaurant name literal only seven sandwiches menu  bright side portion sizes huge prices low definitely picked right location across street UNLV  see being huge hit students limited income    The knuckle sandwich contains grilled salami pepperoni ham melted mozarella topped appears small salad lettuce tomato champagne vinaigrette  actually really enjoyed salad part which fresh helped offset overall heaviness sandwich also overwhelming saltiness  Perhaps leaving salami fresh may help that? Sandwiches come choice side stack o chips coin cut fries seasoning also fairly salty   Might good idea move soda fountain dining room instead behind counter   Service quick fast location plenty seating  Note close 5PM daily unless you're senior citizen likely lunch only option  Italian Chick en Vegas seems most popular option try when area again  <EOR> It really bad can't give more 5 stars!
