It's bit pricy compare food service! <EOR> Being vegetarian place few good options paneer masala dosa appetizer good gulab jamun  Some items stale would ask avoid <EOR> The waiter ignored entire time spoke only boyfriend   boyfriend just spoke maitre d' now laughing hysterically behind back   Do treat women that  don't care food all rude  <EOR> Waited 10 mins but none servers acknowledged us  ask server seated  food ok best  Half dishes mislabeled  No came ask drinks  Waited 10 mins check  again ask it  Same card taken charged    I've Tamba 5 times now food service quality gotten worse every time  Never coming again  <EOR> Great food just you'd eat your grandmothers house  Staff energetic super helpful! <EOR> Delicious food  Came weekend buffet choice moderate but food delicious   Tandoori chicken best tandoor cooked oven something usually available Indian restaurants US  gives burned flavor   All vegetarian dishes good enjoyed food  <EOR> My family craving Indian food pleasantly surprised warm yet contemporary atmosphere Tamba which located right Strip  aroma place drew taste buds working  ordered chicken tikka masala fish tandoori naan rice  all very delicious full all flavors you'd expect Indian dish tied together thin crispy naan  service great well waiters very accommodating every request made food water refilled timely manner  Definitely returning restaurant next time we're visiting Vegas  <EOR> When Vegas 'go to' Indian restaurant fix   Great food there's reasonably priced lunch buffet   Tamba strip next Planet Hollywood second level little mall large patio front where merchandise vendors set up   fan chain restaurants mainstream American fare very happy Tamba still exists Vegas strip  <EOR> I agree Judd below  buffet only second India House Chicago  simply awesome  spread huge!!! much variety  Food very tasty general  every time vegas  <EOR> Good food really nice price $15 per head Specially fruit custard carrot dessert  Also veg pakora <EOR> We found place day when walking along strip feeling well   hypoglycemia eaten several hours   wondering around Hawian Marketplace feeling bad sure doing   building which sadly deserted first floor employees directed upstairs   He could see ill manager immediately table   Once seated started getting back normal ordered   butter chicken which amazing BF curried Goat   waiter shocked he asked goat sure still some but came back smiling letting know still available   He said fantastic   waiter attentive kept positive attitude even though indian couple behind ordered several things kept sending them back unhappy he never lost patience anyone    great meal would back   time half price outlets coupons reduce price   also ate Christmas day lunch buffet while good none entrees marked even few indian customers questioned dishes were   nearly impressed buffet  <EOR> After many visits saying gee should try Tamba finally did!

Mint asked better then this! <EOR> Being only Indian restaurants Las Vegas strip would think would really take advantage situation show world great Indian food be   Instead restaurant located inside mostly vacant building food serve very bland   The good great selection vegetarian dishes Sambar best item buffet atmosphere restaurant good  The bad Food very bland except couple items good only 3 meat dishes all chicken service ok no ever came take drink order fairly expensive lunch buffet $15 person without drink place okay but better places dinner here   But if craving indian food then basically only choice along strip  <EOR> This hidden gem Las Vegas strip  casino  can't see strip  tucked away behind Hawaiian Marketplace  totally worth journey there    I think way judge quality authenticity restaurant clientele  many people Indian descent made even more excited feast!  And feast was!  Ashoka's feast which included appetizer then four small dishes rice  also included naan    first time ever Indian restaurant where did order more naan  served plenty    The lamb roganjosh prepared perfect blend spices  chicken masala also prepared just taste  Everything very flavorful though try described spicey nothing spicey   meal also included donuthole dessert sweet caramel sauce    They able accommodate large party 15 relatively short notice Saturday night    If you're mood Indian food while strip check Tamba!

I've never abandoned Indian meal life no matter mediocre   But could myself past even half meal   Maybe bland curry juxtaposed salty made seem even saltier Maybe thought if mix two curries together would find happy medium  wrong was! no happiness found there  To top off when bill came charged $15 chicken tikka masala instead butter chicken told server mistake   He said doesn't matter anyway they're same price  Indeed not!  corrected said butter chicken $14   he responded Fine just COMP difference   COMP ?
