I love place but need more careful preparing acai bowls Ahi tuna same kitchen! Lazy don't care  <EOR> I find myself driving place little often always tell myself should stop days  Well day today stopped Great Dane whom licensed service dog far pleasant  only does place lack personality could use some more furniture but truthfully can't even comprehend why anyone would want stay eat since customer service beyond dissapointing   As asking lady cashier some questions she some slight attitude ordered paid Hula Acai bowl she said due health department regulations can't your dog wait outside bring your bowl   only did comment tone  infuriate but also made feel belittled obviously dog service dog which identify tag behavior he just sat still next whole time stood there  ahead just waited outside anyway because point didn't even want see 10 minutes she comes outside brings bowl no lid honey dripped all over side given bag  If customer wait outside food ordered least bring them lid bag  the ingredients used low quality actual bowl worth $8 00 <EOR> The girls very chatty  first time inquired sugar calories  If would known issue ask question would gone buy $9 bowl  seemed tho bother young lady  Upon leaving asked if yelp she laughed said yea going put good review  said nothing other girl laughed said oh no hahhahaa she didn't say anything means no !! Then both started laugh loud obnoxiously  return but speak Corp first  Awesome first experience <EOR> The Hula acai bowl really good  All other reviews say they're kinda pricey but wouldn't know never acai bowl any other place before lol  smoothie prices pretty high though description what's smoothies didn't seem anything ordinary   I when pretty busy guess  took 30 minutes bowls  Everyone before apparently waiting long time well  only 2 people working 1 stayed back making orders second worker back forth taking orders making them  I thought weird when ordered counter he asked names wrote them bowls but when he calling completed orders through window picked he called them bowls names customers  every time he said Hula Acai bowl everyone waiting kinda just looked each other because hell supposed know bowl belongs lol  caused LOT confusion 1 angry customer not lol    I think just off business day them  But aside service bowls very good definitely back  <EOR> My boss both obsessed place! There's near work house thus literally feeding obsession  proud stamp card holder racking points free bowls   just clarify level obsession place punch card talk boss haha both fruit sushi bowls but stick açaí ones cause basically healthy dessert  better smoothies less sugar use real fruit when some chocolate dessert validate eating easier cake heehee can't tell which bowl favorite that'd picking favorite child  Therefore everything good good you! love place making healthy eating more palatable <EOR> I am excited smoothie place close home  smoothies bowls yummy  especially peanut butter chocolate bowl    However furniture frustrates me  only smoothies bowls go  furniture kid friendly seating limited  twice two days  back very soon  <EOR> I love acai bowls used regular going every day before work   started notice bowls getting less less blended   acai bowls getting smaller  mentioned time them happening just nasty look back  Love acai but wont getting service anymore !! pay almost $10 would think would attempt give good service  <EOR> Only giving 3 stars because prices little more expensive then most   toppings minimal flavor PB beyond over powering   peanut butter all taste acai non existent  think far fruits roots best place Vegas tried far   <EOR> Normally I'd give 5 stars but made mistake gave wrong food told them all attitude  disappointing because owner  spoke shift Sunday she said Oh totally sorry  too  <EOR> So glad found place! Delicious acai bowls different blends toppings other places seen! definitely back  <EOR> I just left centennial location Makai bowl first time  normal Hula bowl    but questioning if Makai bowl usually comes empty  Check comparison both bowls  Hula equally leveled but Makai bowl full all! disappointment  <EOR> Giving place 4 star because prices bit high   However honor military  fantastic! Glad healthy snack option area other fast food   Check place because chill atmosphere clean good you!  Girls working very friendly nice  Thank you   Will back <EOR> Ordered hula bowl both acai pitaya  really refreshing yummy  would've chosen some more fruits toppings instead blended could improved overall taste  took half hour wait bowl other bowl ordered  Nice there's another acai place close home  Still juice n better  <EOR> Hate but very overpriced $20 two large fresh juices? Overpriced yes quality no  understand business but don't rip people off  Did switch ordered green nothing but lemon very little taste cucumber very disappointing  nine dollars could've made 5 gallons juice <EOR> Absolutely outstanding  Tried variety things menu disappointed  staff friendly accommodating phone anyway  Place kind Starbucks feel but without cool hipsters  found food healthy extremely fresh considering watch them cut peel fruit front me  only regret place right next door house <EOR> Expensive honestly smoothie healthy best tasting  Great customer service   Expensive <EOR>
