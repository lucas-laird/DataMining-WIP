Good food drinks! Brittany best waitresses great advice food friendly! <EOR> Distill still favorite bars Las Vegas  mostly great experiences enjoying Super Bowl discovering Cure burger really good reviews say making friends people neighborhood Las Vegas we'd otherwise never visit   However particular employee irked point come back Yelp hoping management take steps lose business business friends recommended bar  preface all mentioning served every member staff here  Everyone works without question excellent professional unless unfortunate experience Carissa    If she your server better off giving your business restaurants nearby  service slow non existent  Often find ourselves waiting hour before she returns refill empty drinks  perhaps you're new bar curious what's tap  She doesn't know  She won't find you  fact she'll watch stand take several steps toward bar until see taps decide then take your order  Don't bother asking what's good food she doesn't know  Dare mention more few occasions where she flat did serve us?
