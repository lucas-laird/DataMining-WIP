Compared strip yes  locals bar? Nothing fantastic  However typically let buy 2 for 1 happy hour drinks before cutoff if early    The local clientele fairly low rent  Many regulars gruff meet initially but may warm later maybe    Some bartenders friendly some them not so much especially if don't feel you've tipped them according expectations  Bartenders bring lot friends don't expect warm welcome if part clique    The section town so so  Some worst neighborhoods LV right near but some them bad    Food decent but really in line finances local clientele  Thumbs taconauts    Have some unnecessarily rude interactions KJ over issues feedback fault  If rains humidity gets high AC leaks onto stage right near mic    Some bartenders may skip jukebox songs paid don't happen like  music particularly sub cranked way high multiple occasions    I never felt bar particularly smokey although does seem common complaint  run fans smoke eaters AC  definitely smokers' bar prepared if plan go   It hard tell outside place open particularly during day but open 24 7  If door locked ring bell  <EOR> I visited bar boyfriend when town probably best bars ever to    The staff super friendly video games side!! doesn't enjoy playing video games while having some drinks?! <EOR> My fave gay bar town  Why?
