So understanding Maid Cafes basically cosplay restaurants except every dressed maids  Neat concept opinion    My friends came Friday afternoon lunch  already came when Anime Ramen thought it'd cool see changed  remembered food OK visit stayed OK  katsu bento box  Nothing really special it  price food little high but don't mind if 'maid experience'  waitress wasn't dressed maid outfit   she just hello kitty t shirt cat ears tail    guess would work if still Anime Ramen but now store going Maid Café theme then everyone should character  Service good just lacking Maid experience  Probably won't back since nothing really stood menu   ramen other Japanese items but tastier finds found somewhere else  <EOR> I actually sad when restaurant saw sign door no longer says Anime Ramen because craving ramen ever since last trip Vegas couple months ago  But frown turned upside down soon inside see waitresses still dressed anime costumes place still kept  anime theme  waitresses said same menu added items just changed decor restaurant  When walk immediately say yourself aw place cute!  because is  pretty pink glitter curtains floral lights hanging ceiling   Everyone works helpful friendly which just dining experience much better! Prices reasonable bowl ramen only $8 lot things choose from  Since just opened special discount which 20% all dessert  last time Stewed Beef ramen which amazeballs  If spicy ask chili oil add your broth    good  also tried calamari which delicious    I totally recommend place trust unique dining experience Pretty Maid Cafe always must every time Vegas! <EOR> She greets soon walk into door  Then she sits table  nearly empty time arrival  only girl working service pretty bad  inside though restaurant looks nice decorated anime stuff  Perhaps maybe wrong day  food expected below average mainly girl s work business attraction  <EOR> Maid Cafe's big Japan   Cosplay big there's also odd cute juvenile fetish   If no idea maid cafe could walk thinking just walked into 12 year old's tea party   There's high creepy factor if don't whole cosplay maid thing   place pink curtains flowers few cosplay anime whatever posters along J Pop K Pop music background Japanese cartoon two TVs   Japan space limited everything more cozy   place felt bit spread sparsely decorated something   could use more cosplay posters anime figurines something   maid cute Japanese though but then again most sushi chefs America Mexican Pacific Islander   big deal   going Hofbrauhaus getting Irish Italian waitress really knows difference right?  maid waitress super polite knew some Japanese wasn't sure if natural demeanor if she just playing whole Japanese waitress demeanor which super polite formal   She unique Japanese American accent you'll if ever heard American come back Japan   bit creepy though kind those pirate waiters talking pirate lingo   I'm sure food portions much larger Japan   Japanese pizza omurice fried rice wrapped thin omelette    sure call here   photo showed hot sauce drizzled over create smiling cat face something only lines   disappointed that   whole point maid cafe funny faces stuff food amp cute factor   chef lazy   But food excellent   Japanese pizza thick cheese over vegetables broccoli carrots   Sort odd but entirely bad     Overall cool experience never maid cafe Japan yet   fun creepy odd wierd factor would fun unsuspecting friends no idea cosplay just reaction  <EOR> Cuteness overdrive   If into sort stuff   I've outgrown anime obsession years now but still appreciate art totally understand intrigue its draw  Anyway onward cafe   Used known Anime Ramen when first opened so Mom told she food scout Las Vegas now Pretty Maid Cafe  If into Cosplay familiar anime culture you'll kick theme  If probably boggles your brain some kind Loli con show  keep open mind your tummy appreciate Place decor cool keeping theme frilly curtains girlish color feminine deco plus 3 TV screens playing different anime flicks  comes maids um mean your servers Dressed head toe French maid costume anime style even speech overdrive! means high pitch cutesey fast rapid fire which barely understand she saying OMG almost LOL front ridiculing but own comprehension lack towards she saying us  *ehm* ok  short totally line theme  Now food   Ramen  came for  ordered Tonkotsu Shoyu Tuna Poke apps  Tuna good  served bed seaweed salad    I didn't expect ramen noodles different between Shoyu Tonkotsu  noodles Shoyu Ramen used slightly textured uneven described noodle kinks somewhat chewy   noodles came Tonkotsu Ramen smooth slightly thinner more Soumen type noodles   Personally kinky one    The Shoyu broth tasty drown lot salty taste  Usually I'd choose Tonkotsu broth over Shoyu but place vote Shoyu   Tonkotsu broth smooth but tastes creamy milky color obviously Tonkotsu broth milky color meant taste milk cream  haven't looked into proper way making Tonkotsu broth modern variation but wonder if people use cream shortcut create texture murkiness broth    The pork slices bit crumbly dry  sure but     nah  don't it  taste texture just     wrong somehow  did look good presentation though    Service fast  Place clean well lit  J comics read if reading while eating your meal alone    Unfortunately when order desserts intrigued cute pictures menu she told pretty much everything dessert menu except ice creams unavailable    O O   Would come again?
