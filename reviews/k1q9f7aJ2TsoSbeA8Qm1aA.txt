Whoever placed dot Yelp way wrong!!  Location miles away   That being said great inexpensive food  <EOR> Service poor unless Asian  Food floating grease  Could taste favor food because grease  wanted spicy drenched chilling oil  Potential good just less oil more chili's  <EOR> Decided try restaurant Groupon promotion   Yes inner decor beautiful wait staff friendly until pull your Groupon   Food mediocre best   Jelly fish give decent pass but hot sour soup watery beef short ribs tender but tasty opening store bought bottle Hunan Sauce pouring over BBQ ribs   Garlic snow pea leave very old tough   Egg plant garlic sauce bad   Bitter vegetable soup fish fish good but soup base tasty drinking pickle juice chicken broth   insects kept flying near food continuously fan away    But worst part took guest once announced Groupon waitress kept speaking very loudly front guest used Groupon only paid $50 $80 food   She did three times   called afterward let manager know he stated she loud voice several people called complain same thing   purpose promotion bring people your restaurant provide great experience come back   definitely back  <EOR> Very high prices average food   tastier much cheaper Chinese food across street   BTW groupon coupon use small print said 20% commission discount wasn't all much   restaurant's fault but just warning Groupon   read fine print   High prices mostly nice decor   Food comes cold because must come kitchen far away   few times always disappointed   last time visit place  <EOR> A fancy non Chinatown authentic Chinese restaurant great food?

Not worth trip vs anywhere Spring Mountain honest   nice atmosphere fancy place but food isn't worth premium over plethora choice few blocks over     Being semi regular difference crowd month ago currently very noticeable 1 5 people Friday night compared before     Maybe didn't want become just hotpot place town maybe want exotic Chinese place Sorry Bellagio Palms won't ever tony    unclear but effect dropping hotpot menu dramatic here  <EOR> I love place n  least order two times week  but find food quality sometimes good sometimes bad   first time order singorpire rice noodles   its very good  then order second time  a little bit salty   but ok   then third time big mistake  chief forgot put shirmp complaint manager  then remake again    but still dispointed     noodle over cooked  why maintenance food quality      please let chief know  just destroyed your business little little         <EOR> I great experience evening before Carl bar  He personal extremely attentive  decided try second evening Monday 16th completely opposite  If paying great meal should discuss coursing your bartender because busy  If am diner fine then  am sorry burden establishment  keep mind next time  want thoughtful toward your issues  Thanks <EOR> I've meaning try restaurant longest time  love Chinese food restaurant raved it    There's nothing special restaurant  nothing rave say tastes super amazing  normal Chinese food nothing spectacular  group total 6 people  Now since lot people ordered ton food  Now own each dish terribly spicy  combined dishes food spicy!

Loved Pot Sticker appetizers Won Ton Soup! Liked Beef Broccoli but could choke down Orange Beef!!! wasn't very fit eat  Customer Service great! <EOR> Awful awful experience Walked expecting fantastic dinner   Started off jelly fish decent looking forward rest meal    when downhill   Hot sour soup watered down   Bitter soup maw fish tasted pickle juice broth   Egg plant ok   Meat ribs tender but no flavor   opened bottle la Choy Hunan sauce poured meat  Worst part rude server   tried restaurant using groupon she kept telling everybody table only paid 50$ $80 food   She said three times extremely loudly   Purpose promotion people come back   called manger afterwards he told waitress history doing this   She should fired   back plus spent half time trying swat bugs alway food  Rude bad food <EOR> Finally! decent spot hot pot town  would never guessed would casino but given usually only hot pot when visiting San Francisco happy anywhere local decent hot pot! service excellent price good food tasty  great thing particular location super high ceilings smell dissipates into wide expanse don't come smelling your dinner  definitely back! <EOR> The food quite hot exquisite   loved decor well    think great destination dinner place   smoked tead duck amazing  use quite bit szechuan pepper which gives numbing feeling mouth  <EOR> Tried Tony's three chili chicken awesome  Ribs good little salty appetizers came last guess forgot boiled beef tender just need little more sprinkle salt would've better  Good price too! definitely back try something else next time  <EOR> This first time giving 5 stars Chinese restaurant Vegas   My wife into all kinds Asian food except somehow Chinese  wasn't before  definitely Chinese food lover when Hong Kong Taiwan Japan but when moved first San Francisco Bay Area things changed  found quite few nice Chinese restaurants including Yank Sing SF Tai Pan Palo Alto Little Sichuan San Mateo Hunan Home's Mountain View  But number disproportionately small compared other Asian cuisine  tried many disappointed more often not  end day developed unconscious habit avoid Chinese restaurants   The situation worse moving Vegas  tried many those attempts ended futile   So when heard Lao Sze Chuan didn't high hope but place turned great surprise! Tony's chili chicken Crispy shrimp lemon sauce Don don noodle Dim sum Shu mai Pork rgg congee  Everything tasty portion perfect sampling two people  expected spicy food being Sichuan but instance don don noodle just right amount spiciness   The best part? Reasonable pricing  fact more reasonable considering Palms Casino Resort   Thank Tony Hu finally found place return to  <EOR> Went tasting honey shrimp bomb other things ok   ambiance decor very nice   drinks good unique though would maybe come back real dinner  <EOR> Extremely Disappointing  Ok first the Good Service good friendly   Bad Everything else! even close! Sone worst Americanized Nowhere possibly close authentic Chinese food   So sorry report this  just hoping just disappointed   Dan Dan Noodles well listed menu Don Don seriously kidding! worst don't even use peanuts sauce  Cashew Shrimp well cashews ok but taste regretful  Just disappointing all way around big swing miss! Awful! <EOR> Basically few times before wasn't busy food good  offer 2 different broths if ask it  also offer many veggies meat eat any extra eaten extra charge  Last time service actually decent  man sat down right away served pretty quickly but pretty near closing mean pretty much only customers besides some other people already eating  old man took order very sweet he gave all sauces he taught use them meat etc  he even told don't drink much soup since homemade soup there's msg obviously  really liked old man he very good server felt bad because stayed maybe 20 mins past closing just eat  24 95 all eat hot pot pretty well worth opinion especially when allow order two soup broths SAME TIME  pots split middle put two broths one really spicy healthy broth always choose option bc now there's variety!! I'd probably recommend friends probably bring them dinner really good deal  restaurant palms casino though gotta look little <EOR> The general food decent except pork garlic sauce  But overall dishes quite bland   Lately ordering go  Every single time end missing 3 5 dishes some ones received wrong dish   It's ridiculous manage always forget pack few dishes ordered    Not time gave all dishes ordered  I won't eating again  <EOR> At palms conference wanted something different burgers typical fried food tried place   Service 5 5  Friendly woman greeted very helpful  take bartender took order attentive engaging friendly   Ambiance 5 5 looks nice new  Food 2 5 beef noodle soup won ton app dish  noodles good soup broth okay but beef stringy tough  wontons tasted bland texture pasty  probably cost cutting measure but big disappointment because wontons simple okay good  hard great but very telling if bad   I hope folks improve food because everything else place worthy eatery   2 stars food 5 stars service  gave 3 stars overall  <EOR> Had hot pot! best ever had  Great food excellent service friendly staff! <EOR> Amazing food such big quantities too! two people including glass mine each entree each main $53  Surrounding lovely except people decide smoke right outside door <EOR> Shocked some bad reviews  skeptical finding even half decent Chinese food Vegas but place real deal  Chinese American wife grew China  Both lived Alhambra Monterey Park Chinese food capital states   We ordered hotpot xiao long bao  lived Shangai picky xiao long bao but tasty  better? Yes but above average  We're both fans hotpot well all ingredients fresh taste spot on    The restaurant wasn't crowded when thought servers attentive quick  rarely expect find good Chinese food outside LA China but place could hold its own among usual restaurants    If authentic Chinese food give place shot  If maybe Panda Express Orange Chicken General Tsaos might more your thing? <EOR> Another night Palm  tried another resturant  Sat bar Carl very informative all food menu great cocktails   Cucumber garlic salad wontons wood ear mushroom salad really yummy texture seaweed  Chef did just right everything  right amount spices heat salty either  Enjoyed Citrus Mules   Great service  Opps forgot take pictures each appetizing hungry  <EOR> The Skinny hit miss dishes depending order 3 service better your average Chinese joint but again inconsistent 3 5 smaller your average dishes more expensive place okay books 3    We headed over try new Chinese restaurant Palms hearing opening promotion  Go hostess stand 25% off dining cards available until October 15 14   tried dinner twice sample variety dishes while promotion going on   FYI decided skip $1 white rice opted noodle soup green onion pancake instead  decided order sketchy fried rice in Yelp pics definitely soy sauce carrots = gross which cater lemon chicken crowd  guess Asian fusion = Americanized here   Shandong beef noodle soup decent bowl beef brisket soup tasted more chu hou braised brisket beef noodle soup your clear consomme beef noodle soup  hubs Taiwanese little different he used but he enjoyed it  Overall well spicy food ordered  noodles slightly thicker round nice bite it    House tofu disappointing dish fried tofu nappa cabbage  enough wok hai heat wok left dish overly soggy limp vegetables  cornstarch added end attempt save dish made even more sloppy  might added some vinegar dish resulting unpleasant sour taste  fan   Stir fried green beans 11 95 requested Szechuan style which non spicy however accidentally provided spicy version dish  mistake promptly noticed server replaced right version  small sample spicy version okay green beans stir fried cumin whole crushed chilis  Szechuan style green beans good stirfried some preserved vegetables  Again portion sizes small price   Stir fried large pea pod leaves 13 95 generally well executed  ordered dish twice each time leaves appropriately prepped meaning discarded fibrous portion plant   only beef price portion size much smaller expected   Smoked Tea Duck 15 95 dish quite good loved mild smokiness duck  kindly debone breast duck easier eat  being said $15 portion size small   Green Onion Pancake cannot recommend this  pancake tough greasy dense overly bland  Avoid   Szechuan Peppercorn Fish 15 95 batter overly thick heavy fish  also crispy enough  I'd pass dish   Given fact would probably order half dishes again food definitely overpriced given quantity quality feel huge urge return even 25% discount  I'd mention offer small dim sum menu which tried  Although being said dim sum Cantonese not Szechuan style cuisine warned  3 starred review  <EOR> First all bad things way first  folks hurry meal  Wife just 11 before lunch crowd food while coming order placed  Second dim sum limited availability time no visual reference beginners  way shumai guazu very well done especially tasty requested hot sauces  Tried pumpkin congee found lacking much flavor  Also tried two noodle dishes found them well done distinct flavors ample size  Ambience very classy all staff very helpful but overall might some opening stutters might addressed next visit which definitely occur   <EOR> Stay away  20 minutes scallion pancakes came without soy sauce  25 minutes more manager came say sorry delay  Place crowded   Food came tasty but cool  soup pot came without soup spoon  REALLY  Food reheated manager said wok  Strange plates came back hot did wok plates too  Too many good places go <EOR> Tldr Shitty service bland food    This place your hot pot fix  Its 25 per person only pot provided whole table unlike other restaurants  don't provide tongs raw meat  While quality meat vegetables great broth sauces bland  service slow servers extremely rude  Don't let 'all eat hot pot' lure into spot it'll leave frustrated disappointed  <EOR> Lao Sze Chuan decent szechuan restaurant dressed pretty clothes   place chick 5 but 7 lil black dress club   The decor top notch easily nicest szechuan restaurant ever to   great place date if don't mind getting sweaty together before all action starts   The food itself definitely authentic szechuan food real peppercorns szechuan peppercorn oil dishes   dishes decent good enough satisfy any szechuan cravings   A Ok most everything some lil above average some slightly below  tried bunch authentic dishes tony's chicken 3 chili boiled beef tenderloin spicy szechuan sauce dan dan noodles     Your craving satisfied but your socks won't blown off   least prices would expect find any other szechuan restaurant   4 5 decor 3 food 3 service = 3 5 stars but Yelp won't let put 3 5 ain't type dude round up   Better pleasantly surprised slightly disappointed  <EOR> Nice atmosphere   However foods expected   Tried original restaurant Chicago foods child's play   If looking good spicy foods disappointed  <EOR> ??????all eat?????????????????????????????????
