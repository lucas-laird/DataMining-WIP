Highly recommend  <EOR> I love casual concept order your food pick want watch assembled then pay    I highly suggest waiting meat come off grill looking see if containers full meat  sampled chicken pelehu which looked amazing Yelp pics but dry  teriyaki chicken fresh off grill difference! moist delicious    Unfortunately amount meat given very small portion  wanted more meat good  liked smothered teriyaki sauce but if compare portion Island Flavor price 1 3 1 4 amount meat    I also tried steak which dry another which wasn't  wasn't really good overlooked   Loved almonds salad yummm but would nice if worker knew answer question dressing being homemade  She did know which she should    On poke   lovvvvvvedddd it! Both flavors good  portion tiny charge  person assembling your food determines much get  Mine above top small cup husbands below top cup line  don't inconsistency  saw someone near whose cup overflowing poke  Would great if same amount each time  price portion comparable think probably normal portion size just now expect when think Hawaiian    My husband's mochiko chicken great flavor    We given napkins don't think others either  saw people having ask napkins  No napkins tables no napkins near soda machine  Put some napkins people need it  kid saw man blow nose shirt  gross  easy fix hope management that    I think flavors good but dry chicken steak really reliable good meal  wish just grilled order somehow  <EOR> First all think idea having Hawaiian food sort Chipotle style concept pretty cool  pick your main items well your sides  few times now can't say love hate it  price point isn't bad but same price could somewhere else where your food made order  Now understand where fast convenience factor comes play  far food ok  Kalua Pig nice tender but Chicken Katsu little dry  steak bit tough tender enough  service always fast friendly  really enjoy coming quick bite grabbing but better Hawaiian options town <EOR> This place good choice some hawaiian food cafe rio style  Service friendly fast  best items spicy poke sweet teriyaki beef  Three stars because other main dishes arent very good  chicken katsu tastes strange rubbery compared other places probably because laid under heat lamp dont fry fresh  teriyaki chicken good flavor but tasted undercooked  pork kalua ok but bland put lots sauce good  Also changed menu now teriyaki beef $1 50 more  poke extra but thats understandable  Prices value great because try different things unlike other places but wish more menu  Recommend macaroni salad garlic edamame! regular edamame salty  <EOR> 4 stars poke tasted poke home Hawaii perfect seasoning salty    Teriyaki chicken big fan  Chicken hard felt rugby match between chicken teeth  Sauce sweet little long way    Kimchi skip it  Shredded cabbage bland spicy sauce  Couldn't taste tang authentic kimchi spice    Overall 3 stars because only thing really liked plate poke  also bad prices  Didn't need empty bank account meal  <EOR> I would legitimate review here  But rarely ever leave reviews last part real reason why writing all lol  Makai seems hit miss when here  first time tried Makai food just alright  bit disappointed chicken katsu seemed bit overcooked  However poke phenomenal!

If first time would completely confused needed tell next   I completely taken off guard but just proceeded telling meats wanted  Apparently she didn't hear last thing ordered which she once again stared down silence  facial expression looked irritated  Resting bitch face weirdest most uncomfortable thing experienced  Poke said again  She then asked which flavor wanted really annoyed tone   Whoever chick nose stud really really weird uncomfortable stare down customers until speak  If didn't hear something say if need tell want next SPEAK UP  everyone knows do  If having bad day apologize  But please don't take customers didn't shit  <EOR> Aloha 9th island!

The only reason did give place 5 stars because couple items really salty the corn Hawaiian poke but no way keep coming back because food good! <EOR> There're expensive stingy food  true Hawaiian spot  island flavor 100x better <EOR> TLDR Chipotle style ordering Americanized flavors quick service minimal options   After passing location several Sundays decided special trip friend when actually open  surprise wasn't full service restaurant but  ok because just meant going food faster    You place order front service counter depending number meats sides order  availability proteins limited  opted tuna poké Mac salad white rice  offered regular Hawaiian style spicy version  When asked serve difference he rudely stated Well spicy mayo sriracha  Does help? No doesn't snatch because never before want know other sauces  If you're tired explaining differences then sign  way opted spicy version  other server weighs exact amount poké $1 25 upcharge    I left hungry unsatisfied  poké poor quality  mac salad containing potato bits flavorless left much desired  question amount fellow Islanders line food service wasn't even worth trip  teri sauce super oily total food portions very small  Definitely Americanized version overall maybe just bad batch foods  4 5 star rating very confusing wonder if reviewers ever true Hawaiian food    Needless say won't coming back visit anytime soon  serious change would occur order earn business  Not even yelp check in offer would entice visit near future  <EOR> Another quality restaurant ninth islanders Hawaiian food fix  thing Makai stand everything ready! When order your food actually making your plate bowl  No waiting!!! Plus portions can't price  even carry poke everyday  if find yourself area stop try it! Ono Grindz!!! <EOR> I finally tried Makai definitely disappointed!  First all portions crazy huge here! friend shared medium sized bowl both full happy!   We teriyaki steak spicy mayo poke believe? poke bits big flavorful! steak good but dry I'd probably something else instead  steak poke additional charge base price    As sides macaroni salad kimchi slaw  kimchi slaw good!! I'd probably both sides! also came 2 scoops rice again plenty food  <EOR> Great place big meal good value  typically Medium rice 2 meat 2 sides white rice katsu mochiko wings double garlic edamame  lot food rarely finish whole thing sitting unless really hungry  If order katsu cut right front before add your plate  Don't forget grab some Katsu sauce before eat! personally don't eat Poke but when eat Makai friends rave good Hawaiian style Poke is  order every time come must pretty darn good    Their system similar Chipotle Subway where down line tell someone put your order until reach register pay  Sometimes line gets pretty slow seems run stuff often then wait bit new batch  Maybe little unlucky but never seem mochiko wings when come end having double katsu more often not  I'd recommend coming well before closing time ensure they'll meats want  typically take order but there's plenty tables if choose eat in  Still though Makai good option fill any cravings Hawaiian food  <EOR> My new favorite spot ! Food really good amount price well worth  I small bowl full ! Definitely recommend teriyaki chicken   <EOR> Came dinner tonight awesome!!  Between two some wings teriyaki chicken chicken Katsu   all awesome!  Cooked just right full flavor!!

Love everything menu esp original poke! Price also reasonable amount portion get! would say would favorite hawaiin restaurant to <EOR> One local food joints Vegas now! usually stick medium size plate comes two meat options  tried chicken katsu teriyaki chicken  Both tasty portions BIG! also choose two sides including mac salad kim chee edamame    I've also gotten spicy ahi poke bad all  better ones tried Vegas  Nothing ever come close poke back home Hawaii but certainly hits spot when hankering some local food! <EOR> Tried yesterday very good ordered mochiko chicken chicken katsu teriyaki chicken white rice salad kimchi  say all good love kimchi chicken all good dry   <EOR> Mahalo nui filling opu! spicy poke teriyaki chicken point  <EOR> So never Hawaii before don't know good poke but if anything Makai then OMG Hawaii soon!!! tried spicy tuna poke words cannot even describe delicious was  only really tried big chain Hawaiian food spots L L while good Makai whole other level  Katsu perfectly crisp flavorful kimchee slaw amazing!

Instead said cancel chicken just take something already cooked  trying hardest mad  used customer service didn't wanna customer gave hard time over something control  mom 2 year old car waiting kind hurry expecting waiting long   I really think system needs improve  Because waiting over 20 minutes food little ridiculous  Customer service still great everyone very apologetic  might come back awhile because happened but mom said food still delicious worth waiting for   Oh another thing person grilling steak chicken spraying much Pam meat while he grilling it  Why?!
