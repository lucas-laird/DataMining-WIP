Friendliness customer service BALLS   were above beyond!!!  Multiple employees approached complimented them even remembered names!!!  Highly Highly recommend them food fun!!! <EOR> Forget all ball jokes  food truck should taken seriously because tasty eats  Godfather hit  2 ground beef meat balls fresh basil parsley garlic onions pomodoro sauce pecorino romano plenty melted mozzarella soft chewy bun  savory meatballs plenty depth flavor perfectly tender mushy   The Zorba ground lamb fresh mint oregano parsley garlic served tomato olive spread lettuce feta red onion homemade tzatziki sauce decent but taste lamb wasn't overly appealing  did enjoy olive spread appreciated subtlety mint but don't think sammie I'd again   The pricing follows 1 $5 2 $9 3 $12  Two sandwiches should enough most people but if you're really hungry add side  starving order skin on fries $2   no idea if made fresh frozen but portion size quite large crispy light delicious  <EOR> I recently tried them StrEATS honestly little disappointed selection Zorba which suggested fellow yelper  When first received sandwich already discouraged size because rather small  2 balls probably half size regular sized hoagie  price $5 should least long enough hold 3 4 balls  flavors good but little weak  cucumber sauce would nice  Although worst part taste meat because little off  lamb gyros taste very different  Unfortunately wasn't pleasant  bread practically verge being soggy maybe should toast grill before serving? definitely giving them another chance future but probably different selection  <EOR> Finally tried Haulin Balls Vegas StrEATs recently   unfulfilled special Slider Truck figured I'd try something never before   guy working window friendly he convinced try tuna balls   He said I'd love 'em   Well didn't   ok but hoping something little rarer deep friend tuna ended with   Even worse $10   Seems little pricey what's snack best   If half price that'd much more sense   A friend mine tried same thing different event only charged $9   What's that? <EOR> Breakdown Haulin Balls when them few days ago FOOD I ordered Zorba Fried Ravioli Fried Mac n Cheese bites not listed website    Zorba didn't enough seasoning much olive only half sandwich roll   When food ready confused size Zorba cost of $8    two meatballs half bread roll    great     The fried ravioli mac n cheese bites okay but then again didn't food since pretty much store bought just deep fried you     SERVICE The service okay   employee took order polite but didn't she took forever doing math   She actually made circle dots order sheet counted them give total    really?!?!  With many food trucks definitely going eat again  <EOR> When first heard Haulin' Balls inner 12 year old boy giggled determined check out  few First Fridays ago friend quest find food truck funny name but couldn't find it  asked info tent said saw truck pull but wasn't enough room left  checked Facebook Twitter but hadn't posted anything  would good way let people know weren't there! ended Roamin' Dough delicious meatball sacks she said sack  Friday finally found balls! Heehee  two types Godfather Zorba  decided Godfather  asked gal big balls heehee stop now she said big enough share  glad because $10 meatball sandwich sounded bit high  She then informed cheese   mozzarella feta  Blah  ahead ordered share along some sweet potato tots  Are kidding me? Ten bucks TWO average sized meatballs half sub roll? needed more sauce cheese sure would nice  meatball itself flavorful but texture bit gristly granted am super picky meat  sweet potato tots fine but nothing magical $3  I'm bummed  REALLY wanted Haulin' Balls  BAD just overpriced don't run cheese 8 30pm First Friday! kind know going busy! <EOR> How business profile this?
