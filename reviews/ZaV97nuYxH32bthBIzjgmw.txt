Very fresh ingredients everything very clean  wish would put sauce since hard tell much use many flavors combine  But still delicous healthy  Sesame bread yummy! Overall great deal price  probably coming lunch least once month  <EOR> In past three years restaurant gone through least four owners  appears latest based experience today worst unfortunately   We walked absolutely no attempt help us  staff stared blankly without even saying hello  asked if Mongolian grill nodded  told them wanted just kind kept staring while holding bowl  wife asked tell want it? finally guy responded verbally telling yes   Every other Mongolian grill including all previous owners location your bowl down line put your ingredients then give them cook up  place however tell them ingredients want put them bowl you  incredibly annoying when person making your bowl barely communicative   Not being able put ingredients yourself end having tell guy whether put lot little something even when we'd he'd just put same amount  When asked add SMALL amount chili sauce he put full ladle it  When asked put LOT onions he put same amount onions he did all other veggies   We also given no direction whatsoever when pay  stood idiots cash register previously would pay before made your food sat down  standing few seconds no coming over help just seated ourselves   It actually difficult finding table   Many tables dishes still sitting them previous people eaten despite fact only ones currently staff just standing doing nothing  Also even tables cleared lots crumbs debris them  seriously search before finding table actually clean   We sat down table food asked if wanted something drink  asked Diet Cokes  Despite being soda machine brought cans  Apparently soda machine functional   The entire time no staff member ever came over ask doing  call across restaurant guy's attention when wanted water  When wanted called guy again asking check  He actually just stared blankly  repeated check please? he looked uncertainly  The check   ?  Yes check! he finally seemed understand brought over us   There did seem language barrier issue anything few times guy spoke English perfectly fine  He just seemed completely uninterested serving us   We charged price lunch special only way restaurant noticed sign saying lunch special came soup egg roll  never offered either   The place just awful  food little lackluster but main complaint staff  utterly non communicative  even want waiters super outgoing friendly anything just want answered when question instead stared wordlessly  service just absolutely terrible  <EOR> Confused being starred owner frustrating   hungry ate    Plus kinda felt sorry lady    just hope don't sick! BBQ great concept but can't find good Vegas   Keywords NOT fresh Oily Poor customer relations Dirty Ugly  If u don't mind those descriptions place u eat help yourself    <EOR> Wow place awesome  didn't know expect when parked bike entrance but soon knew place be  buffet meets fast food meets restaurant service combination customer service terrific  Totally affordable quick easy   Went inside really good use space modern feel plenty areas sit  obviously looked slightly lost counter area but cook greeted asked if first time which was  He showed around told could pretty much anything wanted  paid first $6 99 vegetarian bowl handed bowl town  down buffet ton veggies toppings choose from  could tell meal completely vegan until put honey AMAZING sesame flatbread YUM! all ingredients super fresh  picked some tofu bean sprouts zucchini onion snow peas green pepper mushrooms  added some garlic sauce top handed off cook added some noodles other sauces he asked first if wanted spicy declined then added big wok behind counter  Eventually small bowl handed turned into giant plate also served side white rice  He handed plate told sit anywhere like    After grabbing some chopsticks don't just eat fork trust some napkins almost immediately sitting down served aforementioned sesame flatbread honey glass ice water  Freakin' nice  food?
