This place amazing great service BEST quality foods  usually give five stars but place amazing   DEFINITELY come if looking entertainment + quality  <EOR> I walk because only cook tonight  two tables being tended too! Ridiculous  because local wanted support instead Benihana  Bad choice  <EOR> Only reason reason giving 2 stars because chef which gave excellent customer service made HORRIBLE service experienced sisters 21st bday dinner  server very rude no smile all made feel bothering entire time  Could definitely feel he did want set party   ask refills more once still charged gratuity over $70 which he did deserve all  Asked speak manger available stated employee which guessing bartender helped more actual server  She even drop check cash out  Thank god chef awesome somewhat made horrible experience  Next time sure man server  <EOR> Highly recommended!! Prime steakhouse Bellagio $80 fillet mignon thought Geisha's fillet much better   Employees very helpful kind   If looking cozy tasty dinner family right place  <EOR> Geisha special!!!

Chef Eddie should definitely ask did really cool tricks while cooking he made dinner very fun fried rice steak delicious^^! recommend place anyone loves food show ^^! <EOR> One best teppanyaki places ever lived Japan    The place nestled away back corner rundown looking strip mall which set bit wary long time over years area slowly deteriorated but inside completely different story  accomidations nice people friendly everything clean lit nicely    Prices somewhat expensive a bottle sayuri nigori sake which around $12 many Japanese restaurants $17 but portion sizes large skill great quality food awesome taste delicious  Between everything chef cooked he would wipe down clean griddle which great only preserve quality taste but because speaks standards well    Bottom line? would definately return future  Everything gets 5 stars except atmosphere  place pretty small sound echoes loudly result if chef cooking nearby we middle table always nearby can't conversation anyone but person next yell eachother so  <EOR> Frances seated us  service great! chef Edward  awesome!!
