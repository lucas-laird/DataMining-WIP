No se no creo por mi experiencia trabajo en la industria y creo jamás habría hablado así un cliente <EOR> Worse service ever !!! order wrong 5 missing rolls waited over hour rolls never refilled drink   ask utensils since never brought   looked cameras sure didn't steal sushi  manager 2 waiters walked around table counting plates sure weren't lying   definitely don't recommend place never coming again   <EOR> Came Thursday 4 12 18 girl son soon greeted staff only waited 5 minuets seated everyone complains service probably because weekends when super busy drinks came quik food also staff very attentive   ordered Norteño roll Botana culiacan both good girl ordered camarones la Diabla those delicious also    music loud but problem me    food good service good definitely back <EOR> Decided check culichi town family music way loud!

The reason take star away because brought plates different times when requested everything brought same time  waited plate 10 minutes husband received his  also messed drink order side orders  But definitely coming back! <EOR> Una espera de aprox 25 min una mesa para dos personas  Es importante mencionar que llevábamos grandes expectativas puesto que la popularidad de este restaurante es grande  La hostess hablan como si no quisieran que uno los escuchara fácilmente hay personas que pierden su turno en la lista de espera por este motivo   Nos sentamos he inmediatamente llego nuestro mesero ha ofrecernos bebidas  Nos llevó nuestras bebidas y tuvimos que preguntar por los totopos y la salsa lo que nos respondió que tienen prohibido servir primero los totopos que las bebidas por cuestiones de que hay personas que se han ahogado segun el  Hecho que fue mentira puesto que observamos que en otras mesas dejaron primero los totopos con su salsa y después las bebidas   Ordenamos Limonada hecha en casa y desafortunadamente estaba amarga Taco gobernador pequeño y con una mínima porción de camarón no parecia gobernador nada impresionante   Quesadilla de marlin tenia buen sabor nos gustó incluso quisimos ordenar un taco de camarón pero nos dijo nuestro mesero que ya no estaba en el menú  Tostada Michoacana nada impresionante la vista le faltaba mucho sabor tuve que agregar mas sal y salsa negra que no sabia que era porque el mesero olvidó presentar las salsas el pulpo estaba sobre cocinado  Solo comí el camarón y las pequeñísimas piezas de aguacate Molcajete mmm muy pequeño para el precio que tiene nada impresionante parecia una botana y no el platillo fuerte  Nuestras bebidas fueron rellenadas por el gerente Alvaro puesto que nuestro mesero descuidó la mesa en todo momento   La comida tardó bastante para salir tomando en cuenta que pedimos antojitos  Háblamos con el gerente alvaro que se porto muy amable y dijo que tomaría en cuenta nuestras observaciones cuando se pronto llega un comensal muy molesto hacia el mencionándole que tenia mas de 40min esperando su comida   Tomando en cuenta que conocemos la cocina sinaloense porque somos sinaloenses este restaurante no cumple las expectativas en cuanto servicio y sabor en mariscos  El sushi esta bien prepárate para gritar porque la música esta muy fuerte debido que tocan banda en vivo  Quizás regrese por el antojo de sushi como la primera vez que fui  <EOR> I come back restaurant  understaffed took hour food  top 45 min wait seated  definitely terrible experience Father's Day  recommend anyone  <EOR> Very bad service took forever bring order wasn't even busy 11 30am open 11am  Server said bad service due big to go order micheladas 20 mins ordered food also took long come  Nothing compares service taste Culichi Town Rialto  <EOR> Food good   BUT music loud  common complaint don't understand why guys just turn down something stop getting many bad reviews? guys read them? care?  I wanted basically hurry eat since loud ears  made terrible experience me  returning  <EOR> Extremely loud band  cannot speak people your own table waitress  point menu place order  Food just ok  ears still ringing  worth it  <EOR> Si hubiera cero estrellas les daría cero pésimo servicio pésimo lugar y lo peor de todo comida horrible sin sabor presentación fatal y prepárate con el bill muy caro la manager pésima atención fatal no lo recomiendo para nada la imagen lo dice todo simplemente horrible <EOR> The pros waitress very professional courteous kind      The cons Everything else  Overly loud obnoxious atmosphere food cold touch when received relatively overpriced seemingly expensive  Two people ate 68 78 no alcohol purchased  <EOR> Best mariscos quite while! appetizers delicious shrimp empanadas some stuffed chiles  salsas actually taste authentic none Pace picante crap your average restaurant actually kick them  server Jesus top everything! He kept drinks coming always making sure good  also liked management constantly walks floor checking everything everyone great job! music tad bit loud sorry but $25 song think band should songs memorized look tacky walking around reading lyrics off cell phone  Sorry guess accustomed old school Mariachi singers  Overall experience great husband definitely returning! <EOR> Visited location Sunday figured would great California locations  Upon entering casino entrance could hear obnoxious loud music  15 minute wait even though several empty tables  sat right front banda  First music way loud literally place order writing text form could communicate waitress  ordered michelada very disappointed  couldn't taste beer flavor pathetic point didn't even drink half it  chips stale very good flavor  salsa okay but nothing great  also ceviche called Mazatlan something effect  ceviche needed more flavor awfully tasteless  addition don't carry any meat combinations other popular Mexican seafood places  disliked most music way loud if someone wants request song must pay $25 WTH  never place recommended any friends  Oh way service sucks!! <EOR> Great variety seafood options Menus spanish Shrimp cocktails tostadas etc good They sushi well but all taste same not great place gets busy expect wait more 30 min your food drinks no refills friend never food mine when ready leave They banda live music playing restaurant  Super loud!! $25 request song singer use phone read lyrics my friends knew songs better singer band way friends fun! won't back tho  <EOR> The food ok but music very very very loud can't conversation  micheladas best  <EOR> Food good  michelada ok  Now music first expensive $25 song much  should playing all time regardless if customers requesting songs  Overall customer service good  <EOR> The only reason why am giving them 5 stars because they're barely starting everything together restaurant  recently just opened see why they're lacking some areas  yesterday bf let start off saying place whole very pretty  caught attention loud banda music playing when walked which apparently everyday 5  loved it! Even though may gotten annoying couple times because very hard hear server bf  mostly stayed quiet enjoyed music lol service wise food took decent amount time come but server wasn't attentive she should've  manager made effort stop couple times just sure everything going good plus! Now good stuff FOOD amazing! loved absolutely everything! ceviche pretty darn good ended getting ceviche VIP app 3 hot chili's now those different but amazed good were  also ended getting camarones la diabla those good well but let's forget mango margarita now tasty too  bf myself weren't fan micheladas because salty  But overall experience would definitely coming back hope then they've established themselves little bit more  <EOR> Good food good music great customer service   Come find yourself A little far strip but worth drive   <EOR> It wasn't expected always hear friends California talking  point going drive thank god didn't much better even swapt meet delicious Sinaloa sushi    place loud even joke every time banda stop playing rush conversation lol gave diarrhea sorry all info but wasn't pleased     <EOR> So overrated  food pricey sushi great  good thing mariscos  Plus evening there's really loud music playing where can't socialize dinner  <EOR> This place thinks box its foods   We tried some sushi rolled  Yes!!
