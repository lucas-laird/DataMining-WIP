Let begin saying NEVER EVER come again! Terrible terrible service extreme understatement  Emilio awesome yes being sarcastic pizza chef felt very empowered evening demonstrated shoving pizza cousin's face she questioned why taking 35 minutes pizza seeing countless people came walk away orders  He confrontational rambled another 5 minutes before he tossed pizza box literally rimmed face mind she caught camera    What followed even more unbelievable  manager summoned fix problem waited 30 minutes gave thorough explanation events manager when he arrived all while he retorted very sarcastic comebacks then he responded saying nothing he could would because only pizza chef he wasn't lose him  Unbelieveable!!  Both managers responded complaint RUDE could believe way handled things especially considering friend attempted play video back refused acknowledge clearly documented   Because management refused anything she proceeded file incident report security  terrible lack professionalism altogether may enough keep away Flamingo all together  All months later still disbelief  sure hope F B stepped game rid those 2 clowns!! <EOR>
