Very nice  Very sweet  Very helpful  Also menu shows largest deep dish pizza 14 inches  Says menu 21 50  until put toppings on  4 toppings plus Giardiniera over 31 00  should prices page toppings should also say 21 50  Toppings extra ! I am guessing pizzas certain toppings already added but guess did look around menu enough find them  Overall decent experience  continue look good Chicago style pizza around Vegas Henderson  tasty just TRUE Chicago  Eating true Chicago style involves two things slice held hand should mess put plate use utensil  held hand eaten any other pizza  crust should quite thick was  But still very good  pinch may grab another here   Thank Haley! <EOR> Best Chicago deep dish found yet  Very cheesy needs fork knife should  Chicago deep dish     first choice     Now find new York style pizza good Chinese good whole Henderson super happy  <EOR> Best Italian beef Vegas!  going take pictures but food looked smelled good never chance    pizza puff took back jr high  Added some pics second visit  Poor beef didn't last long enough time either  <EOR> I've craving some chicken wings lately found place Yelp lot good reviews decided give try  bigger looks outside probably around dozen people dining inside Sunday evening   Woman counter guy later handed food stone faced very welcoming  little over $10 dozen wings  came almost instantly which sounds good but means probably sitting under heat lamps    In car didn't even smell good old grease  tasted little better smelled but nothing special  Came side also very greasy fries  hot sauce Frank's medium tastes Frank's diluted ranch    I may come back try beef sandwich pizza which main deal but wings  <EOR> Cool joint deep dish pizza promising Chicago style   boyfriend's family lives Chicago area experienced pizza firsthand during Thanksgiving week  being said pizza definitely good flavor  But crust just isn't right  only took 20 minutes which already made skeptical because deep dish Chicago takes 45   told Yelp Talk must because water can't thick pastry like which shame  But definitely stil good don't wanna diss sure tried best being middle desert!
