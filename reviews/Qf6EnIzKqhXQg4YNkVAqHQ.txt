He told he'd bring some biscuits left   When server returned ordered stuffed mushrooms lobster bisque Bar Harbor Lobster Bake  asked if wanted order drinks dessert  server promised biscuits again left   The server returned alas without biscuits but stuffed mushroom appetizer  server cautioned dish extremely hot He promised bring biscuits again left  gave food some time cool let flavors settle  appetizer quite delightful  However apparently waited long   The remaining courses began arrive rapid succession literally piling table  flummoxed restaurant nearly empty  promised biscuits each time server came but alas! Those biscuits paths apparently never meant cross   The other problem nearly comical time each dish succession cooled point dissatisfaction  lobster bisque congealed  main course should called Bar Harbor Linguine Cover dash Seafood  smaller portion pasta would better allowed savor flavors seafood accompanying sauces    Incidentally food presentation reminded something would see hospital  main course covered plastic container made feel assisted living facility   At end server came back check 45 dollars asked if would take some biscuits takeaway  Anyone eaten cold biscuit probably guess why refused offer  knows perhaps I'd still sitting waiting     I see many people enjoy place  heartily recommend spending one's money elsewhere  salesmanship service food preparation quality leave much desired  think busy may explain why bring food quickly  may notice  <EOR> This goto place celebrations great meal!

When waiter took back crab legs heated again hired cooks background yelling cussing   <EOR> The place always busy! Food good price   BUT restaurant really needs CLEANING CREW! Place filthy! Pictures walls moldings trim booths tables just filthy! Such simple thing many restaurants seem fail  place does great business sure could afford clean it!   Even salt pepper slimy touch  Wait staff works hard food good but dining experience would more enjoyable if place CLEAN!!! <EOR> To sum dining experience tonight word would AWFUL   food terrible   start off ordered calamari appetizer largest piece calamari smaller diameter nickel   appeared whatever left fryer basket dumped onto plate served us   very little calamari essentially serving deep fried vegetables   Very unhappy   lobster stuffed mushrooms ordered ok     Both members party ordered lobster shrimp trio both highly dissatisfied   lobster tail extremely rubbery dried out could more 1 2 oz meat total   shrimp also extremely small appeared slimy undercooked   ate them refused try another bad   lobster mac cheese burnt top yet also somehow soupy watery underneath also inedible     As write around hour leaving red lobster both members group feel sick stomachs     This inexpensive meal either   would assume if your restaurant advertised Lobster Fest charged $25 dollars plate customer would food did resemble leftovers low end chinese buffet   Every piece seafood incredibly small disgusting completely honest   I am extremely dissatisfied experience want full refund immediately   huge fan red lobster restaurants many years gone different locations all over country generally good time great food   particular experience un acceptable     I would return   staff friendly yet extremely rushed   meal took over 90 minutes  <EOR> Great dinner 2  Valentines day special wife very pleased service food  Good cheap seafood 2 <EOR> We great dinner here  server Angel very welcoming service timely responsive  posed challenge shellfish allergy table but all managed very well no allergy issues chicken tacos specially broiled chicken  stuffed lobster tail better drier grilled lobster tail yet flavors all good  <EOR> I want complain horrible experience Las Vegas off Decatur      my waiter David manager Rhonda Cox seated 745pm did anything eat til 857pm  Everyone else around came party 6 seated  multiple people bigger parties served food when talked Rhonda let know she told wrong only waited 25 minutes  manager tell customer wrong blame waiter instead taking ownership completely unprofessional  never appalled attitude service especially tourist city vegas  Never another red lobster especially first timer here  <EOR> We've craving cheddar bay biscuits while now excited lunch today Red Lobster  ordered shrimp linguini alfredo husband build your own 3 choice menu which he chose steak choices  steak cooked perfectly medium rare pasta cheesy goodness plenty tiny shrimps  side salad drenched though champagne vinaigrette which sounds fancy wasn't bad but miss raspberry vinaigrette told gone 9 months ago bring baccckkkk   biscuits still great kept getting refills  ambiance though lacking used dark wood lake house feel but need brighten bit  Again having lunch felt 7pm already only little 12  service friendly but could tell everyone kind going through motions  food presentation lacking which wouldn't big deal if marketing menu photos did show such bright exciting colors  All all still return when those cravings again biscuits  <EOR> Horrible service horrible food  clam chowder NO none clam it  food didn't arrive hour later    waiter looks rushed restaurant even full  Disappointing experience  come here  <EOR> You don't pay for   Fresh frozen ideal seafood but when your birthday boy wants crab legs kids menu     Well time try it   Note self since don't crack legs  even offer need ask them ahead time you'll spend all night cracking them kids your meal ice cold   Plus nice gesture bringing ice cream nice  But unfortunately halfway through meal doesn't help fact still full plate food eat first  <EOR> I'm definitely huge fan place even though LOVE seafood  dinner menu WAY over priced  prefer coming lunch lunch specials   lobster bisque soup GREAT definitely well cheddar bay biscuits <EOR> Other delicious cheddar biscuits find service horrible food way over priced  ordered 4 course meal  Soup salad came pretty quickly  OK  great awful  wasn't even 1  4 way through when main course showed up  former server there's no excuse that  watch table drop order rest meal approximately coincide customer finishing soup or salad  And weren't busy  waitress brought check before bringing dessert included 4 course
