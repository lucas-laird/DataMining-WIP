Things didn't much better when corn dogs  huge clearly made house corn bread delicious  just wasn't cooked all way through  halfway down dog encountered some oozy cornbread dough which sort turned off wanting any more   That being said hangover fries pretty good if little over seasoned maybe bad doing garlic fries instead regular   think if little more attention detail food could really solid enjoyable every other aspect bar  I'd still come back heart drink play but probably pass food unless salad something very basic  <EOR> Love place! some friends decided check last Friday night!
