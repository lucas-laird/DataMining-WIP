personal favorite Stacie roll  all eat prices fairly reasonable  chef staff friendly attentive  Highly recommend place if you're area! <EOR> This place extremely mediocre  prices drew because seemed cheaper other places are  certainly gives sushi fix need  However service great  waiter seemed really push All eat menu  explained just wanted look menu first then decide he continued push it  Once he finally understood doing LA cart he took menus gave new ones claiming different  same  environment place appealing did feel welcomed  More likely try place again  <EOR> When arrived only few other people eating  15 minutes people just started coming through door crazy! pleasently surprised good sushi rolls variety them quite extensive! boyfriend sat sushi bar Poncho bartender  He fantastic  location little hidden worries far business goes  But think found new favorite AYCE sushi!!!
