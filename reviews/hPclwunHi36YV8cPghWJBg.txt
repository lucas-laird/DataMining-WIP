Probably pre made oily salty vats food scooped into paper boxes Styrofoam container accompanied underwhelming side selections  far that   Despite somewhat dilapidated exterior slightly cheesily decorated interior lot character small family run joint  walk your left mural river market Thailand  your right far wall menu items listed pictures specials  tables chairs you'd expect middle of the road restaurant tables sturdy chairs look fairly new  tables traditional condiments Thai food chili pastes pickled jalepeño slices other spicy yums   man server assume owner jolly middle aged Thai gentleman name Yai ?   he lacks ability speak English well he certainly character  He very attentive  family's table seemed best effort sure content  Boy beyond content!

Cons Limited menu Inconsistent heat levels   My husband prefers Stick E Rice likely ambience   He says menu larger but he always gets same thing sure isn't reason     They no longer offer free Thai Iced Tea appetizers your order   But if check Yelp currently offering free Thai Iced Tea $15 more order   Anyway if looking authentic food served relaxing comfortable atmosphere without breaking bank recommend trying Thai Food Go   Try Pad Woon Sen Green Panang curries! <EOR> The service ok  brought wrong fried rice first but quickly taken back kitchen right ordered  beef salad tasted fresh refreshing  crab fried rice pork spicy basil good any thai food town if better  daughter also loved BBQ chicken over fried rice  only downside carry 18 month old son since didn't high chair available  Also don't bathroom customers I bit taken back that    But least food good  <EOR> Went lunch special which only $5 50  It comes soup choice veg roll chicken something sure was  I dont sweet taste hence requested no sugar food  Yes people sugar used many American restaurants much no even notices it  Best Thai food Vegas  Great food made way without breaking bank   Either ways price its great food owners great  <EOR> I ordered salmon pangang  curry fresh shrimp spring rolls  delivered deep fried spring rolls caught driver before he left gave spring rolls took money back pay when he returned  Well deqlung owner whom couldn't deal because all he wanted argue ordered  ended just paying salmon pangang no didn't pay outrageous delivery charge $5  wish would jus gave all food back kept all money because 2 bites threw food away  dry veggies hard dish general no flavor  don't think even salmon dry fish texture but didn't taste all  Lunch FAIL sure  <EOR> Very friendly polite excellent take out Thai food  pumpkin curry pork drunken noodles beef both excellent! <EOR> Love ordering deliver little bit pricy but pay definitely!
