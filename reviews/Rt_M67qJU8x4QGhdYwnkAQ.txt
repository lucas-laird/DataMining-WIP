Not unlike every other pizza joint  set same way expected order slice throw oven few minutes heat crisp eat slice  Didn't quite way  Instead ordered slice took display case put paper plate handed me  This sorry luke warm excuse barely retained properties accurately called pizza  It decently sized slice give'em that   It when folded half bite more manageable realized just shite was   This thing coulda rolled into cannoli flimsy  I wager could Walgreens purchased frozen Tony's pizza slapped sucker Las Vegas Blvd few hours let sun bake would better option  Even drunk would recommend  <EOR> Do eat restaurant pizza cold no good let use restroom think people working whereSpanish no papers <EOR> Its probably frozen but its quintessential bar pizza when stumbling around downtown fremont 6 hours   does trick but nothing amazing  Nice staff  <EOR> This place perfect if love soggy pizza dining cock a roaches being overcharged    It's mostly own fault trying find food X Mas eve even Vegas difficult  <EOR> It late starving  Fremont desperately looking food joint  Came across Piccadilly decided try it  large half pepperoni  Spent over $20 it!
