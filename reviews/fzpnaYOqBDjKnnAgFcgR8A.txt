Well cooked delicious  beer always cold point  I'd already breakfast just potato chip fries  chips very good    CONCLUSION As bar gets four stars but only during football season watch Giants when already TV  all by  gave place three stars instead two 'Giants' bar because close Giants bar any other bar gets town beggers can't choosers  I'd give four stars if strickly Giants bar five if bartender didn't wear Eagles jersey  If you're football fan understand  <EOR> Great Pub!
