I ordered capistrami   Normally order pastrami very plain only meat lettuce mayo but time meat coleslaw Swiss cheese dressing   Completely made worth it! pastrami excellent flavor itself   coleslaw overpowering sauce tied everything together nicely     It slightly pricey far sandwiches but sandwiches huge!
