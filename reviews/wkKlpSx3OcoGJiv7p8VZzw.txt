Once seated waited approximately 15 minutes no service asked passing server if he might able help us   Thankfully he agreed did great job   cocktails creative well made time needed one   food also creative beautifully presented   Unfortunately portions shared plates very small expensive   If want bread instance its $6 loaf slightly larger baseball   Really?  other dishes range $12 $18 but small sharing really means bite something   The restaurant itself really well done great vibe lively crowd   surprised little seating though   Its good sized space but kitchen seems take most it    Maybe its just but looking forward end shared plates craze when into restaurant actual meal   Again excited try place would say great potential if wasn't already busy   Maybe its just me  <EOR> I hate leave bad review but 2nd time am disappointed   I love food  Any splurge purchase ever food related  love food much am cook profession am engaged cook  Hell even cook days off!  2nd job customer service  Needless say am good customer  spent over $300 last time visited  Tonight spent around $200 tip included   Same server but sure she recognized us  am say worth $$$  We time 8 30 reservation but no front  Later realize hostess running food   The oysters bangin  grilled oysters celeriac wasabi ones  If meal stopped would left  completely happy  ordered uni melt  delicious super fresh   Unfortunately oysters took over 20 min arrive  2nd course essentially sandwich nearly 20 min server finally checked ask if oysters yet  If hadn't would pretty terrible she hadn't checked sooner  20 minutes later skate arrived  sounded glorious menu promising Alabama white sauce  dropped off hostess struggled describe calling grapefruit dragonfruit  coworker reassured was  She came back later correct herself   A major turn off skate wing comes all bones  first glance looks just fork into but doing both mouthfuls bones  wouldn't unforgiveable if told upon ordering even upon being served  but no mention it  told runner cleared plates wish someone would just told because just dug into mouthful bones  He apologized but then made excuse staff still acclimating new menu  understand but warning someone bones fish pretty important  see picture MANY bones any less cautious eater could choke them  grapefruit actually really good sauce but skate itself borderline salty   At point regretting ordering much  devoured everything delivered within 2 minutes arriving hungry  server checked since probably looked very impatient informed trout dish being plated right now would 2 more mins  trout delivered chef owner himself he asked everything tasted  course said good food fine service terrible   Until dish  trout simply deboned butterflied served tiny dots two different sauces neither which could really taste unless ate them alone which did just sure wasn't imaging things  green sauce tasted very leafy white sauce still tasted nothing  it  No side anything explains why paid $26 it   Finally Japanese sweet potato sweetbreads came same time shortly after  wanted pack leave  fiance upset trout dish or lack thereof lost appetite  sweet potato which server upsold because brussel sprouts totally different imagined  basically loaded baked sweet potato  worth $12 when know $2 food cost  being generous  Why such dish come last?  Sweetbreads okay  came sweet sauce made think bread pudding  protein severely underseasoned veg plate virtually nonexistent    There no excuse wait  arrived 8 30 left around 10 30  small plates open kitchen reveals many cooks moving very fast  place wasn't even packed yet watched bar filled emptied before last course   Our server pleasant but really present other when trying sell more food  asked rest food check  runner picked food nd told pack everything  He didn't take other half potato which packed ourselves  None other things sweetbreads dish put into box which throwing $10 away  also watched server held long conversation table she obviously knew watched table much later check before even ours  ask corrected copy because charged brussels which of   server said Oh forgot take off? ? Aren't server didn't see print hand check? don't know why everyone treated stupid child doesn't know anything restaurants but guess because spent much money here  <EOR> So glad discovered place thanks Yelp! reserved table two but when changed mind asked sit bar glad did! two bartenders amazing  top drinks waters huge bonus bc over 115 definitely sync another's style  Great team effort part!
