Glad came! <EOR> The first time ate wonderful ordered Carne Asada salad really good today when ate let down Carne Asada Quesadilla skimpy side meat took back counter because thought forgot cheese  much cheese it  husband ordered shrimp Quesadilla much cheese figure   lol  think thing most if am thinking no cheese most would asked if would more added right? He just said yep all meat hiding it which case handed back The taste good but think should toasted longer when ate did feel eating Quesadilla  gave 3 stars because food tasty fresh but satisfying Quesadilla craving  <EOR> I VERY disappointed place  super hungry workout low carb meal plan  rated 4 5 stars decent reviews Yelp   Unfortunately experience tonight disheartening  ordered carne asada salad without beans rice requesting additional lettuce replacement   When order looked yummy! Then straight meat carne asada bland cold chewy  realize maybe serving meat cold default here  prefer meat warm salad am accustomed other Mexican places frequent  confident saying better tasting carne asada around town   Another point hardly any cheese all  Most Mexican restaurants hold back cheese  guess salad cheese used small amount garnish instead being part meal?  Overall staff service great  restaurant nice clean  plenty seating available when gets busy  may come around second visit try tacos comparison other Mexican eateries around town  <EOR> I just tried shrimp cocktails which biggest ever seen  cost 15$ tasted pretty good  cocktail comes chips saltines  free drink when check yelp thats great  Only thing restroom really dirty left without using it  <EOR> Four tacos many!

The nachos w cheese just that  Chips real cheese top  hoping someone tad more elaborate but didn't argue it  Maybe some pico de gallo side would made work?  The cheese quesdadilla spot on  best Vegas   The beef burrito pretty tasty  Once again would hope pico de gallo side better choice sauces  But tasty its own right   The prices Del taco cheap but comparable Chipotle   I say start restaurant am impressed good following already  think Frijole's alright  least once month maybe more if few minor things ironed out  <EOR> Everything delicious  juices wonderful  Carne AL Pastor definitely favorite meat  <EOR> Been driving many times finally stopped give try  very happy did  tacos beef  girlfriend shrimp burrito  salsa really tasty fresh  Real avocado served  little busy but service fast friendly  sure coming back  <EOR> Nice open dinning room  Clean bathrooms  nachos absolutely delicious  only complaint says jalapenos them menu which am currently craving  Theres none them even diced it  0 spice them  going dock them star though since still awesome  No chip left uncovered toppings  <EOR> I ordered burrito    Let start saying amazing  melted cheese flavorful meat delicious  outside doesn't look much but place really impressed me  Mexican am always extremely critical Mexican establishments can't ever compete Mom's food but say those beans melted cheese burrito really brought home! highly recommend establishments  mango drink      another yelp review itself  <EOR> Came right when opened  young lady working cashier very friendly  some carne Asada tacos carne Asada burrito guacamole sour cream  very good  Tried meat separately taco very flavorful  also aguas Frescas half pepino half strawberry delicious! visit next time Vegas! <EOR> Went first time other day  Staff friendly very clean environment  ordered chicken quesadilla tacos which alright  Overall food ok but nothing special  <EOR> Order shrimp taco!

I usually only trust Robertos carne asada fries but Frijoles does great job! worried first because theirs thick fries  Since drain grease fries really well don't end big grease drenched fries  fries cooked golden brown  Then fries topped meat cheese pico de gallo sour cream guacamole   meal within itself!   If craving Frijoles Sunday luck because closed  savor taste Monday  <EOR> I stopped just before closing Monday night  Everything really clean staff super friendly   They let sample several agua fresca flavors  All them delicious would back just pineapple one!! only 1 size $2 50  watermelon mango great too!  Along 2 drinks ordered carne asada quesadilla carnitas burrito Mexican street corn  Everything made order despite being end night tasted super fresh homemade  Chipotle junkie might Frijoles better  only thing missed cilantro lime rice portions smaller  everything spent under $20   The only thing didn't care street corn  unfairly compare all street corn Mundo's street corn which off charts amazing  while Frijoles probably more traditional version didn't blow mind Mundo's did   I would give place overall sure regular customer!
