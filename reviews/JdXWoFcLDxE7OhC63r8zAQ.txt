Wow must just happened because just 2 weeks ago   But regardless terrible  service flat BAD  ignored 5 minutes while 4 employees dicked around fryers   We ordered two chicken bowls order potstickers share   The potstickers looked deep fried testes  asked them redo them when initially served shriveled little balls melted wax paper stuck them because put them bag when covered hot grease  brought them back raw but dripping grease  actually said girl behind counter You've kidding me  The rice mushy teriyaki sauce ICE cold chicken dry mixed vegetables just bunch greasy bok choy limp carrots   This favorite place San Diego first we'd tried Vegas since moving last year   Totally inexcusably awful  If really closed good riddance  <EOR> This place sucks bad don't even know where start first come try order large dark meat advertise window cashier says  only weekends ? When try order something no eye contact no smile no nothing She then asked if wanted Togo said Togo then she says again said Togo please then tip thank anything ? WTH ??

Samarai Sam's definitely great white hope asian goodness  Ok here's teriyaki lesson Japanese teriyaki usually shaved beef chicken pieces  light sauce  Usually soy sauce sugar sake   usually thin sauce Hawaiians grill meat charring add sweet sauce base shoyu brown sugar pineapple juice honey sweeter  Samarai Sam's hell teriyaki wrap rice? Doesn't defeat purpose Atkins? fusion? basically cheap fast faux teriyaki bowls  is    it's McDonald's Teriyaki  good? Eh boring     <EOR> I just wasted 10 minutes life waiting someone take order!   The restaurant completely empty  Felt zombie apocalypse! heard someone cooking back sister decided wait little  Feeling Adele yelling     hello?!? No ever came out  tired waiting decided eat Teriyaki Madness across street  <EOR> I usually write some lengthy reviews    Today day    The food quality quantity price horrendous   Save your money   please elsewhere your teriyaki  <EOR> This food horrendous  even joking thought was  Please save your time stop here  Gummy noodles raw veggies   ugh I even asked veggies well done  better shape won't  open much longer  Just thoughts  <EOR> It's quick meal lunch but fairly unappetizing  am quite unsure why such long line leading entrance  place am definitely look forward visiting again  <EOR> My first visit couple months ago OK would given them three stars   Nothing write home about   convenient grocery store going needed something quick   good enough tried again while doing errands but highly disappointed time   ordered noodles salmon vegetables   salmon dry did taste fresh all verily any noodles entire bottom half bowl consisting mostly green peppers   took bowl let them know fish dry did taste fresh   He did offer refund money asked if just wanted something else    don't eat chicken beef pork even if did husband already complaining chicken verily warm told just wanted noodles which ended even eating those   threw almost all food he threw away half no longer eating restaurant   Convenient just threw $23 trash  <EOR> Found lot hair food  Looks someone haircut before work  GROSS!! <EOR> Gave lady tip she didn't say thank you  Messed order she rolled eyes if fault  Place seems dead which doesn't surprise me  No music unmotivated staff  Top off home food taste microwaved  Gross! Never again   <EOR> Was impressed all  years curious try again could bought ordered he freezer section grocery store  <EOR> I'll start saying used love place  haven't 8 months remember being just ok  wife today  sat car kids  She placed order grabbed drove home  sumo bowl white rice all veggies    bowl opened home sumo bowl brown rice carrots broccoli   it  wife normal chicken bowl cabbage  She opened hers  No cabbage  Just broccoli  livid because quite ways away am never going back there  never write reviews  download yelp app just rant much hate place am never going back  word mouth place going horrible  <EOR> I no idea Samurai Sams Vegas until just few months ago  Back Phoenix several different locations would visit  always liked food   This particular location close where work  ordered particular store several different occasions prior writing review usually way work  Sometimes close closing time when there  However every single time customer service pretty good  just again evening before coming work hour before close  guess enough times where ask if want same thing ordered last time actually remembered was! Salmon bowl veggies brown rice spicy teriyaki sauce those really want know always impressed things that    I commended them being aware order history but steak chicken bowl time around  However still veggies brown rice spicy teriyaki sauce   Their food service consistent here  least when gone  continue 1 2 times per week visitor  Good healthier food option good price very good customer service  <EOR> Called guy handling food bare hands  He took big Paw full broccoli threw bag  told he needs wear gloves  Amazing without customer knowing  <EOR>
