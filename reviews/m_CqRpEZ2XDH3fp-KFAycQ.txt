Order ALL EAT Just tell them don't like   and keep making most delicious rolls ever! YUM! Never let down before  Every time Las Vegas stop Sushi Mon    *drools <EOR> Got AYCE sushi dinner which $26 95 per person  Sushi quality selection both excellent  order came fairly quickly during 1st round but lagged bit afterwards  Unlike other sushi places where all sushi rolls taste more less same rolls maintain individuality    Get mochi ice cream Get mochi ice cream  They  something called orgasm sauce  really sure but probably blow your dirty dirty mind    Had dock star speed waiters accidentally spilled soy sauce friend's pants  gave wet wipes though  = <EOR> Great spot all you can eat sushi!  don't skimp list nigiri your order always happy some yellowtail unagi part AYCE   Also give delicious sake drink few other higher priced sushi items part package   especially place open until 2am   just wish didn't raise dinner price $25 95 recently   getting expensive! <EOR> Been twice first time bad second time dinner great maybe off day  Sushi bad service bad your sushi fix here  100X better then Sushi Yama which serves spoiled sushi  instead if want AYCE  <EOR> I love all sushi here! stop place every time Vegas    The sashimi pretty fresh two orders uni sweet shrimp included all eat too!! I wish allowed more   huge selection ranging nigiri sushi rolls hand rolls cooked food yakitori dynamite which looove but don't recommend all eat because very filling prevents eating more sushi sashimi    One favorite sashimi salmon since limited quantity ones tend order lot it  But noticed first order always REALLY FATTY tasty but order more more just gets less less fatty point where taste salmon gone  don't know why happens but noticed every time 5+ times    In end still place every time Vegas because just such good deal good quality sushi price pay  Good variety fresh sushi great price can't wrong that  <EOR> I came 4 friends hiking Red Rock Canyon all really hungry   4 ordered AYCE 1 ordered off menu   much experience AYCE sushi  only other sushi place AYCE     We placed quite few orders various Nigiri sushi some extra things miso soup shrimp tempura few other things I 4 piece Mexican roll    fish fresh tasty     Service good   misstep two when something ordered brought but given amount ordered guess could expect this     My biggest issue place small   5 people table all plates brought meant table quite crowded   made good conversation sharing ordered but amazed didn't elbow dining companions during meal   There 45 minute time limit lunch hour dinner but way scarfed everything down almost time spare although weren't watching time don't think either   The red bean ice cream dessert very good   wish mochi AYCE menu   Rather just three ice cream flavors   I come back sit sushi bar  my wife hater fish raw otherwise  and AYCE   Maybe slower really enjoy meal  <EOR> Whenever sushi bug where go    Let's face it  Sushi expensive   $2 3 per piece bit spendy IMO but hey  pretty much average cost nigiri   am hungry boy   am taste fish generally don't order rolls much less dip fish bits soy sauce   said usually all eat $28 30 dinner 1 hour price think quality fish quite good     For starters usually ten pieces yellowtail which fave always good 6 8 pieces garlic tuna also snacktastic! alone pays AYCE    Other faves tamago grilled eel unagi salmon     They also nice variety sides included menu usually least  three four things including shrimp tempura gyoza miso soup sometimes seaweed salad ahi poki     To satisfy sweet tooth green tea ice cream lychee sherbet because honestly why tough decisions when both ways!  Sometimes mochi too   When finally put sticks down generally put away $80 worth food   Cuz  roll  ha! bad $30     I always sit bar chefs attentive speedy   waitresses even though focused waiting tables usually pretty good getting your drinks side orders clearing empty dishes     The place kinda small little decor may wait bit weekends  If looking BEST sushi town probably isn't place you   If need fish fix want save few clams another ha! say charge it  <EOR> One best AYCE sushi meals ever first only AYCE sushi bar sat where food would come faster order  Their ayce menu consists bunch nigiri sushi special rolls some appetizers side dishes   The gf ordered mainly nigiri Yellow tail Salmon seared salmon Albacore Cajun albacore  shrimp tempura really good too  Although nigiri pieces sometimes small never unhappy fish rice ratio  also didn't matter if pieces sometimes smaller sat bar whenever wanted order something just yelled 3 more salmon! less minute chef would hand plate order  Usually any decent good ayce sushi bar gotta wait good amount time between orders plus you're given limit amount order time sometimes even pack rice try customers full  Sushi Mon doesn't this  say give 60 minute time limit which sounds cool first but when constantly handed plate plate whatever order guarantee you'll full within half hour  end meal gf 15+ stack empty plates front post picture soon  Highly recommended sit bar  A good 20 minute drive off strip but totally worth very satisfying meal friendly attentive servers chefs   Notes *They don't put full wad wasabi authentic Japanese sushi bars but put little smudge there  loved did since most American Japanese sushi bars don't nigiri wasabi it  gf didn't she requested don't put any wasabi nigiri sushi chefs gladly did her  **There another Sushi Mon more south Strip  asked chef if Sushi Mon other acquainted learned once but anymore  <EOR> When comes ayce place ok but did toro uni which great really fresh a+ that   sat table service great till started filling waited 20 minutes last order didn't feel waiting any longer paid left but hey happen any places   If would last order I'd give them another star     The sushi fresh all but last order correct timely doesn't always happen tables   Good selection nigiri seen special rolls most places now   Nothing seemed set them part any other place but 5 minutes house back probably  <EOR> Toro!  few places publicly tell people item menu   Most places would hide fact fatty tuna     I wouldn't call Sushi Mon best sushi place but certainly top 5 Las Vegas   only quality food attention service but hours!  would hope everything listed above because prices pinch wallet   don't care much special rolls always rice bottom fish straight top type person   quality fish serve fresh good   bad experience uni but replaced quickness     If order special rolls usually order half rolls if available just try other special rolls without getting full fast  <EOR> the service above beyond  waitress very friendly offered some good suggestions based off initial order  she came frequently see if wanted add more food order  food came fast even though busy  other waitresses came topped off drinks  place would perfect 5star if price tad bit lower if all fish came fresh  plum ice cream stay away over creamy green tea  <EOR> This where lost sushi virginity  place made overcome aversion raw fish   place where most paychecks spent when lived Vegas   think obvious LOVE place   quality fantastic    far best Vegas LA  Plus AYCE all you can eat around $26    pretty hard beat  Service friendly quick  they're open until 2am     Just when thought couldn't any better    My favorites 1 Miso Soup 2 Albacore tuna 3 Yellowtail 4 Super white tuna 5 Shrimp tempura 6 Tiger Roll shrimp tempura cucumber avocado spicy tuna 7 Rainbow roll California roll wrapped tuna shrimp salmon yellowtail white fish topped smelt eggs   The tiger roll must  texturally balanced awesome flavor combination   super white tuna dressed most amazing ponzu sauce      yet find comes close  Sadly don't serve strawberry mochi anymore which best tasted  All all favorite sushi place happy first <EOR> Awesome plce AYCE sushi if Vegas dont mind 5 mile drive north strip  Believe well worth it  fish very fresh tasty great service very clean inside  fact place run Japanese people really seem take pride thier business  would highly recommend place anyone loves good fresh sushi lots it! <EOR> My favorite sushi place eaten basically   I love Sushi Mon point where leave strip several miles place stuff myself almost 60 pieces sushi sitting feel sick afterwards  Well happened once least   There hasn't better place combines all you can eat sushi quality come across  balance great no slack variety choose from  Same dessert    I write review some hesitation though since don't want see any waiting front seated next time there!
