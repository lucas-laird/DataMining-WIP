Sweet Jesus!   So sure its good but above average  again? Um   see  isn't hood more likely not  any Baja Fresh again? Yes sure  <EOR> Super upset place ever since Indian Middle Eastern employee started working gone down hill  She can't take orders correctly gives attitude simply does comprehend  menu  Apparently she supervisor Jamila M 502    She always takes wrong orders    Today worse! Wrong order top beans burned  salsa's did no flavor ever! Never coming back again! <EOR> We just ate today Feb  4 2016 12 15p   used wife's favorite places when she pregnant    Wow gone down hill!  Two fish tacos soup chicken fajitas took 19 minutes receive     Tacos room temp no Pico De Gallo sauce  Fish cooked nicely just needed hot     Tortilla Soup completely cold spoons   sells soup without spoons?  Fajitas hot portion generous   But again no Pico De Gallo no sauce     The salsa bar no cups lids containers take out  Employee did answer when asked it     Sweet tea clear just sweet water     Restaurant very stuffy hot asked adjust temp employee did try but wasn't possible she opened door   Unfortunately now cool but six lanes traffic construction site made ridiculous     Never again  <EOR> We usually call order then pick up  person spoke phone today could understand single word she saying    at all  ask repeat everything she said 3 4 times then she asked name twice back back  She reading pre typed card  very annoying irritating  Clear communication phone customer service skill 101   The food ok time probably use another baja fresh future  <EOR> Great service just don't right noon  busy during lunch hour wait  Just wish didn't rid if low fat healthy bowls <EOR> I came interview across street   The girl front very rude   I coupon free burrito she wouldn't accept it  She said printed but no where email did say that!

Prices high side but if join email club send coupons regularly  <EOR> I must say Baja fresh veteran well Vegas atleast fresh Mexican food trend  If you'd rather others choose your burrito taco toppings palce since all already determined you  usually baja burrito steak pretty tasty  probably steak best compared thier other popular competitors   also recently tried torta chicken which new menu item   grilled vegetables nice touch bread pretty good too  But must say bread bit fluffy if any sense? prices $1 50 higher more less Chipotle's Qdoba because menu items automatically come chips  Unlike others which option  really love salsa bar which gives them little edge  more plus probably most menu options  also help community offering those Baja Fresh fundraiser nights shows care communities cater to  Sad say probably visit Baja Fresh least probably because food doesn't taste fresh others  <EOR> Stopped lunch $6 99 taquitos   Food okay most part but atmosphere just completely sucked   Loud ranchero music over over again point can't hear yourself think   good mexican food but place could better   Bathrooms weren't clean either  <EOR> Placed order paid waited 10 minutes before cashier comes table says close  cook didn't show up! Why couldn't shift manager least hop grill complete orders  busy  no excuse behavior  Then issued refund manager said he coming tomorrow  HORRIBLE service  location should closed permanently! <EOR> I just don't Baja any more  When high school would come all time  chicken burrito just OK  Way more tortilla filling  came chips large refillable cup but only nasty golden peak cartridge tea  Why can't people stick good ole fresh brewed    The staff super nice both when took order let them know ice  for 10$ meal just ok   <EOR> I try best fast food chains but place definitely different every thing prepared order fully customizable your dislikes usually tostada salad days which awesome filled your choice meat fresh romaine lettuce guac cheese pico choice black pinto beans crispy flour shell which hard eat whole thing flavors great everything ordered used rave chicken quesidillas but trying eat little healthier why only eat part tostada shell lol salsa bar regularly stocked fresh well beware tho queso chips which leave craving oddest times usually when closed !! rather large serving chips smokey chipotle cheese sauce dunk those freshly made chips Omg yummy !! way more health conscious choices available but lol ! if mood some freshly prepared Mexican food relatively good Taco Bell some tackily decorated mom pop shop where greasy king then place  gotta try !! <EOR> Really close work   you really can't bet fast affordable semi healthy lunch   really changed menu include health information   Helps more informed decision   staff location very friendly   Gotta love free salsa bar chips too!
