Well first time asked cream cheese took order given side  Little did realize charge$1 50 cream cheese  ripoff   So total paid  $12 30 breakfast  next person says fast food cheap should think again  <EOR> Excellent place! best coffee could ever bagel lax delicious!

Waste money didn't even back because would probably taken another 20 mins just sides!! <EOR> Service great compared other locations  even asked if want bagels toasted also skipped several times because cashier couldn't figure ring but made visit great just lack enthusiasm maybe just but smile greeting would nice  asked plate but dash sarcasm  Bagels ordered spinach Florentine which served better other locations dry!  guess we'll give other locations try but definitely would skip one  <EOR> Horrible service start! interrupt two employees' personal convo giggling ask where order we welcomed upon entry   wait super long order since kept giving items one one  remind drink maker request kids temperature drinks forgot give food items  added shot espresso drink still heavy eye lids hours later caffeine???
