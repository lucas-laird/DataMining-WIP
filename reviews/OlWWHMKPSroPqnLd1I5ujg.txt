Oh man bit tongue  didn't know badly wanted say too   Another time didn't utensils table forty minutes  food come ten minutes prior  mention stop eating just because refill didn't come felt hours   Still convinced place run nut job? friend today overheard waitress whispering under breath crowded was  location very spacious building but believe kid only four other groups people tables aside friend myself  Clearly woman never seen true lunch rush many others   But anywho want know moral story? Unless you're such die hard Denny's don't care when long if then save some time DON'T location  You'll wait hours treated horribly customer if even person all   If didn't enjoy Denny's food much would've seriously given place star  Maybe even zero  Never again  <EOR> I've coming place For while now but service keeps getting worse worse   After walking two occasions decided give them third chance  took 10 minutes just order drinks couple minutes later brought drinks asked order again    The staff fights front customers seems everyone having bad day definitely regret decision  <EOR> We EXCELLENT service Sean!!!
