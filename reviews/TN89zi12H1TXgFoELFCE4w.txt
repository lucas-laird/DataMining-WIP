Great comfy seating arrangements    gangster movies playing silent quiet background music allows good conversations  Ill definitely back! <EOR> This excellent faux speakeasy burlesque vibe   'hidden' entrance exit doors entertaining  The entrance isn't _too_ hidden  just follow crowd look bouncer  music outstanding  sometimes DJ sometimes live both great   shows lively bartenders waitresses excellent  warm friendly efficient entertaining   There's no food at least saw but drink menu very large drinks very good   look forward returning! <EOR> Whoa incredible    list bourbon!  Well hello nurse   mean such hard find bourbon   OMG really that??  Uhhhh  What???  A speak easy 1920's while sure Vegas Strip'esque you walk seemingly innocent bar only escorted into fantasy world beautiful women serves best bourbons States offer   Angel's Envy Elijah Craig 21 E H  Taylor Small Batch Pappy's 23yr old Grand Reserve which currently of    all taking if you're willing pay   pay your will   Very high  Vegas markups   Minimum charge seat table $50 if want stand but well well well worth burlesque show   racy very suggestive   Good audience mix guys gals all having good time   A true hidden gem night spot deserving try any bourbon enthusiast   Wait talking about     HUH     <EOR> The bartenders great   Drinks fantastic   So why four stars?  turns due change management policy little over month ago no more burlesque except private events   sure why hotel concierge or Mandalay's didn't know that   bartender spoke said may bring show back some point but foreseeable future   I later told change something drunk frat bros harassing burlesque dancers while being loud drunk boisterous in other words bros think totally sensible change   Still detracts allure place  <EOR> If you're going charge $3 ice least sure prohibition style ice  C'mon now   Lovely ambiance great service although asked if wanted Manhattan rocks   WUT?? Now know why    ice prices where try rob you well mixed drinks good alcohol selection decent prices drinks for Vegas    keep mind probably double you'd normally pay your own hometown   loved playing gangster movies 20s era music  gave nice vibe place  decor bit vegas ey but hey    VEGAS!  Stop charging ice might back  bring back burlesque! <EOR> Not worth cab fare  information date definitely hidden speakeasy vibe looking for  <EOR> Best kept secret strip  Bartenders exceptional cocktail knowledge welcoming personalities  cheers environment mixed kind cocktails modern speakeasy feel  I'd love shout all but shhhhh best keep low  <EOR> I came 1923 Bourbon Burlesque friend Prohibition Revolt party  Entry free RSVP 1920's attire encouraged  Sold! there! amped finally chance visit 1923 expecting great things  Sadly notions great night 1923 quickly quashed    ATMOSPHERE Most attendees dressed 1920s attire plus  Walking through secret entrance cool feature but novelty quickly wore off once settled inside  wasn't anywhere sit  Oh wait plenty seating but all Reserved   hate that! Especially if speakeasy type place shouldn't more lounge friendly? only place sit red  cigar room which surprisingly empty patrons  music playing business  Jazz band promoted event playing jazz  playing Top 40 tunes  Huh?  VALUE Cocktail drinks $19 menus ominously lacking pricing information  I'd expect kind pricing high end club speakeasy   BURLESQUE Ha! glad didn't stay watch act because according Nelson Q  sad sight bear witness to  band announced act would come 10PM  waited until 10 20  Nothing  Without anywhere sit without drink hand because refuse pay $19 cocktail said buh bye    As leaving horde people lined into 1923 part some party tour  course weren't dressed theme acting hooligans  exit perfectly timed guess!  2 stars because bartenders quick ask if needed help nice    Worth Return Visit?  No way Jose!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015 #23 <EOR> I visited establishment group friends all whom love burlesque should say ladies perform wonderful   management terrible  several avoidable errors involving group manager duty gracious well meaning polite    Also isn't burlesque club  lousy regular club which employees few talented performers    I would again recommend anyone any reason  <EOR> This place perfect your average club goer wants ordinary club experience  If don't mind exorbitant prices is  $50 head  If came through secret entrance expecting period 1920s experience forget it   The burlesque acts nice but few far between  90% your time involve blaring house music ego driven DJ something prove   Bottom line? expensive experience typically try avoid  Loud shitty music pricey pours  Stars wait staff performers  All else garbage  <EOR> We fun!  recent Saturday night  suggested come Husband when he heard words bourbon  burlesque he shockingly! all it!  Hey know man! wife year award? NOTE If sit front $50 per person minimum! friendly bartender kind enough warn us   Hey bored out of towners looking true Vegas experience   we're all in!    So three hours experienced talent  three different gals two performed twice each once   came maybe every twenty minutes  Please forgive math sober math good night trying drink wine $50 worth  Meanwhile Husband doing $50 bourbon part   know better ask math then now!  Also if sit front prepared pick your drink when gal comes she might dance bar front you   gals fantastic!  Very gymnastic!  very classy  Loved watching Husband's reaction!   Sad piano stage never used playing   Would loved some live music   more show like! gals sure utilized curtains poles however  As show bartenders alone incredible show   they sure hustle!  As club itself quite small   Small bathroom also  Biggest problem and could plus others SMOKE   Cigars everywhere  <EOR>
