I'd suggest call first  place seems business     replaced mexican restaurant  <EOR> When craving Chinese food Las Vegas always stroll down Buffet Orient  Although selection isn't comparable massive 4 Star Hotel neighbors down block Chinese food best tasted far city  If you're thinking going grab fast food think again    under $6 per person it'll salads entrees desserts  also just load your plate french fries  <EOR> I love chinese buffets naturally when am cruising around Las Vegas see try it  heard brother friend in  pretty nice place considering area  total buffet $5 76 tax can't price  food however great  didn't wide selection would liked  beef broccoli really good teriyaki chicken  don't started Chinese donuts! Phew! fried calamri very chewy tasted sitting all day which sure had  white rice steamer usually buffet wasn't fresh tasting  also amazing soft serve ice cream nice  would again    until find competitor better  <EOR>
