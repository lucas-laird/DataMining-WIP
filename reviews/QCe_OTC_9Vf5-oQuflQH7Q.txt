But does quite few tables lunch rush probably when most busiest Pad Thai Restaurant   Came wifey quick weekday lunch opting various specials only $6 95   lunch special choice several different entrees fried rice hot sour egg drop soup small house salad   bad deal per se but number all you can eat Chinese buffets around area Pad Thai Restaurant does fight patrons   Just saying!  Their lunch service quick really restaurant within 30 minutes   lunch special Kungpao Chicken bit underwhelming   portion size OK would expected more plate   flavor good overly salty but many undercooked crunchy carrots celery dish   enough time wok!  over crunch made dish texture somewhat off   favorite dish should gone namesake ordered pad thai!  fried rice very good though even if simple interpretation think touch fish sauce may adds flavor it   egg roll?  Tasty!  surprised might actually fresh made instead frozen   Props that   hot sour soup also surprise indeed hot sour but overpowering end   Even simple salad good house dressing   If guess some mayonnaise it   Tip add some black pepper salad kicks flavor notch   Overall enjoyed side dishes lunch special more entrée itself hence lower star rating   partially fault though why order Chinese dish Thai establishment?  Next time stay Thai!  Maybe curry!  'Thai' place fast easy lunch! <EOR> This place hidden back large shopping you've probably driven even realized it  $7 lunch specials very filling yummy  chicken Pad Thai  heat o meter painfully deceptive! heat food but decided cautious ordered Level 1 their scale 1 5 rather 1 10 most places   Level 1 gave quite bit heat  wasn't bad but wasn't prepared much heat  think order plain next time but most definitely return!
