Just fill container half full but full! Sheesh    <EOR> I've coming since high school  quick service  drive thru usually accurate  ambience fine  usually clean  wi fi works fine most time  usually don't stay long enough use restroom but few times pretty much expect fast food restaurant restroom basically clean graffiti some stalls usually unpleasant but overwhelming odor  customer service varies but some staff like shift manager Wayne really fun humors which experience more enjoyable  clientele also varies  issue because close Boulder Highway frequently panhandlers outside restaurant but usually leave alone <EOR> All bad reviews read place very true all them   Very poor service location  if try call complain don't answer phone   time set items serve lunch dinner items then switch over breakfast but don't them   Hey Vegas gamble if going good service  would somewhere else if believe just fine doing   Going try calling corporate but doubt if anything  <EOR> Kristopher nicest polite employees McDonalds ever encountered  iced tea drive through spoiled   parked took refilled new  none lobby but Kristopher apologized took cups handled very promptly  He polite smiled very professional  impressed  Usually employees annoyed because don't understand iced tea spoil couple days   Everyone nice lady taking money employees smiling asking if helped while Kristopher off getting new tea    Nice job McDonald's  <EOR> Busy location fast service  Its McDonalds  You've you've them all  <EOR> We morning ordered bacon biscuit dude kept saying bacon sausage biscuit said no want bacon biscuit extra bacon he just kept saying bacon sausage biscuit said look want biscuit want 4 slices bacon     he finally thought but when nope right 2 small slices bacon didn't even cover center biscuit   back  did place <EOR> Great food healthy options  great McDonald's always know you're getting!!! Love new sandwiches can't wait try siracha chicken grilled specially sandwich! <EOR> This probably WORST McDonalds ever to  First 2 occasions really upset me  point where call corporate due rude disrespectful employees  Second process using your app in store needs revised  issues EVERY TIME in  use app quite often  work right down street honestly just every other day  app really helps getting good deals coupons  But some reason always gives hard time when using in store  Third restrooms gross bunch homeless people drug addicts using restroom stall reasons shouldn't  employees know exactly people doing but should more aware cautious when allowing people use restroom  Isn't policy anyway?? u gotta purchase something first right?? Anyway lastly always long lines  Which great business but problem believe manager should way jump another register bring line down  waited longer then should line may times  while manager didn't take initiative jump register help out    I'm still customer location because convenient travel work lunch  But honestly should really work everything mentioned  <EOR> Worst service ever!! Night shift horrible gave complete order wrong come back home because forgot food plus rude own messed up!! lied saying parked when didn't also brought own workers lie when never even seen kid!! horrible am mad never going location again night!!!  NEVER NIGHT THEYA RE WORST!! manner didn't even guts show face hiding behind employees!! <EOR> I never thought would review McDonalds but stopping some French fries other day they still best realized really great customer service fast food restaurant  Unlike many other fast food dives McDonald's gets right manager down counter  <EOR> This McDonald's location never seem order right always forget something   frustrating   Today only did screw order food did prepared such sloppy manner couldn't even eat it  If could give zero stars would  <EOR> It's always drive thru me  fast fast out   This location no gripes about  employees friendly fast great job   I haven't inside attest cleanliness place but can't wrong drive thru here  <EOR> My wife try come mcdonalds anymore some reason never seem able order right time forgot 3our 4 fries  <EOR>
