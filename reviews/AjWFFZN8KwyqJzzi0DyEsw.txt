He barback never acknowledged anyone else really waited around further few minutes show over  walked ended finished leftovers instead  <EOR> A great place casual lunch without breaking bank save Bally's Paris since you'll straddling both money pits    focus clearly burgers but besides beef turkey staples also ground salmon ground chicken which unique   build your own tradition Counter except some pre designed selections   burgers fry less order side if want them     I ground chicken brie grilled shallots bacon Dining Buddy had   something unexciting beef cheese bacon mushrooms something    each really enjoyed burgers once able figure eat them   fresh lettuce tomatoes stack burger tall difficult wrap your mind your mouth around it   $40 two people two snazzy burgers double side fries which Vegas high quality burger isn't bad all   service very good though could see might wildly vary  <EOR> The food fine nothing write home about  took almost hour order only two wasn't busy  sure could find same burger better service anywhere strip  <EOR> Been passing place all weekend just look menu cute hostess comes lil seducing voice reeled in  Lol wasn't feeling eating burgers again but why not  waitress super good mood seemed whole staff really  Paris burger which ooookaay  place expensive bad quick bite plus place pretty nice  BUT Tbh only way see myself eating again if pass seduced again  Great staff but food good enough come back  <EOR> Surprisingly delicious cheeseburger French fries  friend both burger fries draft beer deal $20  spicy ketchup interesting twist fries    I wish burger came pickles also surprised quickness provide check waitress  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised dinner experience here  expecting just average burger fries but definitely exceeded expectations  ordered French onion burger side waffle fries sadly two don't come together aren't cheap but did waffle fries which awesome     The burger itself very well prepared  Medium juicy pink all way through Gruyere onions worked nicely top  didn't care bun options but wheat which fine  really nice combination  waffle fries fresh crispy lightly seasoned  single enough two people share but any more would double  <EOR> Had paris burger done just right Brie cheese done perfect onions perfect  Great service  Quick pleasant drinks great $$$ <EOR> You'll find nice atmosphere here  Lots televisions decent sized sandwich menu  But really overpriced even current Vegas standards  Really $16 basic sandwich another $7 fries??? Give break  then top off crappy service definitely find other options  <EOR> Decided try when received BOGO text message offer during stay Vegas   I thought would good deal would able try burgers          wrong!   The offer limited Les Entres section which choice filet mignon open faced filet sandwich supreme de poulet chicken breast cordon bleu sandwich steak et fromage french dip cheesesteak steak frites new york steak   decided supreme de poulet chicken breast cordon bleu sandwich steak et fromage french dip cheesesteak   The food good nothing rave but would preferred try hamburgers however husband suggested stick deal gone since bit pricey   Rather leave decided stay food good service quick employees attentive clean restaurant lots TVs   I did waffle fries bit dry much taste   Would come back actually try burger? ummm      sure <EOR> Great food service   Grilled Chicken Salad fantastic!  Don't know did onion rings but now mushy nearly good used be   crunch gone   For incredible onion rings try Marilyn's Cafe Tuscany Hotel Peppermill north end Strip  <EOR> Cheap food quality but expensive price hamburger ordered medium all them over cooked <EOR> Had The Paris brie bacon incredible   service slow considering place empty lunch but cleavage made then some  <EOR> Ok came hoping filet mignon burger 9 months ago  ordered Groupon filet mignon w as still groupon site  When no steak burgers all very very very very disappointed love filet mignon did settle Kobe beef being travel agent asked small consultation Free fries  Keep posted <EOR> The husband weekly lunch date  Groupon lead week  new menu set burgers no subbing allowed price @ 14 if need any changes forced use build your own @ 16 give cheese 2 toppings lettuce tomatoe etc spread   The food enjoyed short rib fries but since add meat cheese bowl would more effective cone use  should also use shredded cheese opposed big chunks used  burgers good despite being nickeled dimed  bacon however awful thin extremely crispy   husband says better Gordon Ramsey's can't compare  also did see few nats killed any enjoyment lunch   There potential but clean little more lient subbing  <EOR> Quick seating good wait staff  Food good however all sides fries averaged $8 extra  BLT 5 star most bacon ever seen  <EOR> I'm burger fan   big time burger fan   best ever had   My wife because hungry two for one drinks bar  Great upscale sportsbar atmosphere  Burgers fantastic  8oz freshly ground beef cooked seasoned perfectly  Bacon mushroom provolone sauteed onion bun  Fries tasty little garlic them  $50 steep but good back few days later   list must eat places when Vegas   Damn   Now want burger  <EOR> Although am interested super expensive burger thought place okay   Atmosphere nice bartenders friendly  <EOR> Really place  TVs everywhere food taste good  Burger cooked perfection salmon really tasty  Located

hot fresh fries really good  waiter saw cousin bacon shirt kind enough bring few extra bacon strips before even ordered  Touches hard fine    recommend Burger Brasserie anyone looking good solid meal good atmosphere  <EOR> The menu changed pretty drastically fully convinced gordon ramsayed  Let explain mean  watched enough kitchen nightmares eaten Ramsay's burgr realize time Ramsay done restaurant menu becomes short concise portions very exact just enough full combos speak non existent  Now don't know fact Ramsay anything drastic changes it's just theory but sure felt way   I enjoyed food but honestly really disappointed changes  isn't much unique place anymore  Before all sorts different options burgers lamb salmon chicken burgers even kobe beef option sort French twist it  Now everything pretty standard any other high end burger place  kind fantasizing lamb burger seeing removed menu kind tragic me  also somewhat annoyed third significantly reduced menu entrees hot dogs bratwursts  anything against hot dogs except name restaurant BURGER Brasserie   They also used combo options where could add fries and or milkshakes somewhat discount opposed ordering separately those gone too   I shaft bleu burger boyfriend french onion burger  Mine delicious but bit much bleu cheese taste  french onion good but opinion pricey just being gruyere onions   We also gravy fries chocolate nutella milkshake  thing thought odd all milkshakes menu alcohol which fine because didn't mind alcohol  But if didn't want alcohol would bit upset pay them include alcohol  liked nutella shake last visit lot better  Don't know why but wasn't good time  gravy fries really delicious flavor but unfortunately touch oily taste also said feel Ramsayed because portion considerably smaller expected last time when bleu cheese fries portion very generous bleu cheese fries also no longer menu   mean expecting them healthy any means they're called gravy fries pete's sake but didn't seeing all oil seeping out   Service waitress Nicolette wonderful  She walked through new menu came check enough but much she very friendly   The hostesses other hand   were just meh   there three them just kind huddled around stand  wait time seated even though plenty open tables  might fault though   I don't know if restaurant understaffed something   I don't know sure but regardless still weird me  When turn seated just called name  But didn't call very loudly think just chance heard because boyfriend didn't hear it  There's water fountain right outside entrance BB there's lot people walking through hard hear  But seemed weren't making lot effort    Overall disappointed changes  experience time really just ok hence 3 star rating  There's nothing special place really cause special trip anymore  <EOR> So ended eating because Groupon very happy choice   First waited 10 minutes told seat   served great waitress forgot name but she tattoo across chest she attentive knowledgeable menu very friendly   ordered panzella salad pretzel appetizer   salad big very good perfect blend dressing delicious   pretzels 2 hard sticks 4 soft very large nuggets 2 dipping sauces spicy mustard very good cheese dip   husband
