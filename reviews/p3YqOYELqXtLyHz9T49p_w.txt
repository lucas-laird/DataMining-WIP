No just telling is  Really talk customer? don't say just telling is  might given them second chance down road but now  never going back  ordered same thing probably last eight times going back last two years know portion used now  can't remember last time angry leaving restaurant  There's something three more identical restaurants city place lowered standards way much ever return  <EOR> I hard time leaving review but best experience    Service slower slow   staff super nice friendly but waited long time everything   even drinks   Placed order drool sampler 10 min later told crawfish   does crawfish place run crawfish?  Ok changed order   Once food started eating server informed now magically crawfish    Crawfish sole purpose going restaurant asked some   originally ordered sampler but because crawfish debacle bill now much larger would otherwise    Overall food good but rest experience not  <EOR> Great fast friendly service great seafood fun environment enough said! <EOR> OK REALLY REALLY looking forward getting Lousiana style crawfish seafood  missing Boiling Crab Cali  probably closest would since don't Chicago  little disappointed crawfish because shell super thick hard just something little different sauce  still ate beast don't wrong  mean little messy when eat your hands there's sauce everywhere   but think really would enjoyed lot more if crawfish give Boiling Crab  Maybe they're different region? really difference if shells hard difficult peel  taste crawfish meat even different! Almost lower grade seafood meat   Anyway also ordered clams crab legs shrimp  really enjoyed crab legs clams shrimp pretty good too  fries share which welcomed distraction tongues much spicy garlic y goodness  loved corn cob usual  <EOR> Recommend it!

Overall food tasted great! husband king crab legs fried shrimp basket daughter chicken tenders  Cajun fries definitely some spice them but enjoyed it  husband put off everything served bags except those listed menu baskets po'boy sandwhiches just aware plastic bib gloves food might bag  would recommend restaurant anyone but would sure knew bag thing  <EOR> I couple different locations thru U S  let down  talked friends saying going best crab legs ever try wrong     overcooked dry inside  barely anything meal but shells  waitress only apologized 3 meals crab legs each total let down  <EOR> I chance visit place while Vegas over Memorial Day weekend  saw featured Man Vs Food    tucked away Chinatown  ladies greet all once    Very nice    seat then hand very short straight point menu  ordered crawfish   bit pricey compared Texas $10 99lb also ordered snow crab legs which $16 99lb    sweet potato Cajun fries amazing well!  don't serve wine champagne glass purchase entire bottle $24 99  ordered hot juicy special spice level HOT! awesome! <EOR> $12 lb live crawfish $22 lb lobster  1 lobster 2 lbs crawfish today both big disappointment  meats dead crawfishes dead lobster  just ate crawfishes boiling crab yesterday difference very obvious  $1 more per lb boiling crab big deal  hot n juicy Falls Church VA  wasn't impressed unfortunately location no difference  <EOR> After reading excellent yelp reviews drove down LA day just try place   craving some crawfish finding good crawfish hasn't easy lately   new ride picked companion plugged iPod just hit road  way spend Saturday     OMG!!  Ultimately although wanted eat more refrained pigging out   stopped eating ate three pounds crawfish   and yes consoling myself fact three pounds included shells   yes  it!  And   no didn't eat shells   really only ate maybe pound actual crawfish meat   Anyway first two pounds medium Cajun boil served corn cobbette potato   boil flavorful light heat crawfish good size   When done ordered another pound crawfish spicy hot juicy boil   Great flavor particularly garlic touch   those mudworms large!  looked mini lobsters   actually ate claw meat something generally don't given small size   all limit just much work want meal  Now know just order spicy boil flavors since generally foods high heat   Before forget sweet potato fries good too   liked food server kept coke cups full staff checked often    My companion ate fried shrimp chicken wings potato fries   While he ate everything because he hungry he didn't particularly care it   thinking figures since house specialty crawfish  But unfortunately because items menu could use bit more attention hence four star rather five star rating   The restaurant clean importantly restrooms!

Hot n juicy mild king crab side butter squeeze lime salt pepper order rice  <EOR> The original Vegas  food itself amazing any location but say service far best location   From greeting once walk warm great night    definitely surpasses all other locations   <EOR> As going away dinner coworker chose spot eat chill together before head out  last week reservation made hold spot 20 people  Then morning called ensure area 20 we'd 630pm  Whoever spoke said   So here's complaint   I late because parking area sucks  fault but area where they're located pretty popular  Next walk into restaurant whole party standing  Uhmmmm why? Well because don't take reservations  OH REALLY? why did call sure reservation set tell all good? ERIC tell spoke because clearly spoke your ass  frustrated because supposed plan event your WHOLE STAFF failed communicate your facility does reservations  only did set back plans night but looked idiot when told spoke your sass   Next the party 20 sit 10 10 otherwise wait going longer WHY BABY JESUS WOULD WANT PARTY SIT SEPARATELY?  I bad attitude he added fuel    Eventually sit down everything smooth that  wish caught name waiter because he awesome actually put better mood   I'm only giving star because staff failed accommodate needs party host rude which put bad mood personally another restaurant extremely similar restaurant where people more friendly  <EOR> Oh well  test water *one more time* back because last experience good!   Terrible service  *once* did water cup filled entire hour there  All waitstaff running around frantically trying turn and burn when place busy almost always busy  seem hyper focused clearing tables seating new guests  happens between table service doesn't seem priority  ready your seat if actually need something  you're hailing taxi!  This 25th visit HNJ chain restaurants first time ordering black mussels  black mussels small shrunken orange meat variety  clams much better but unfortunately sold clams last visit  would definitely order mussels again   Call ahead sure protein want?  Taste note garlic Hot N Juicy sauce plentiful potent rawer side prepared if re dip your shrimp peel    <EOR> Much better  bad experience past but all giving second chances glad did  Everything point  Quick courteous service  Tasty good sized portions  glad came back because always loved flavor really bums when bad experience but nothing forever   it least hope <EOR> Been numerous times actually going hot n juicy before ever travel channel   And food good all other reviews says  seafood good size flavors wonderful   Now only gripe place service terrible seems getting worse  usually boiling crab because such crappy service hot n juicy now    Went tonight dinner food came promptly  everything ok but server literally inches away table never bothered ask if everything ok  He did few times saw looking table but he never said everything ok? boyfriends beer empty halfway through meal he didn't ask if he wanted another wanted water refill he never came  worst part finally put napkins bibs table indicating done he just looked then walked away bus table behind us  clearly wanted check  He then refilled water but done eating already    And know he knew done but he never came check  finally ask another server right front tab  guess because know people keep coming place don't care service    So sure nothing change continue hire servers don't care doing job  <EOR> If you`re SE Texas MS LA that`s Louisiana don`t wait your time money here    While ambience inside pretty good food terrible comparison region   7 party 3 LA Houston 3 CA 1 KY CA people loved except raised FL    ordered some everything menu maybe oysters half shell but   just shuck them but some lemon juice them   Seriously if venture SE USA keep your expectations low you`ll love just locals  <EOR> Stopped first time today yummy! seafood fresh server Loren super cool helped decide order  <EOR> I excited try Hot n Juicy Crawfish Vegas glad finally to  definitely worth it!

Pricing isn't bad when you're splitting!   Note charge extra sauce side! <EOR> Good food friendly staff! more could ask for?  This nice option if you're looking cajun flavored seafood  They provide several seafood choices different sauce flavor options   The blue crab hard eat especially when don't provide anything open hard shell unless want risk breaking your tooth chomping down shells    The clams okay  taste overwhelming clams being drenched sauce  little disappointing several empty shells bag provided even scrapping floor bag see if meat fallen off    I would recommend shrimp! sizes big tasty!  But overall messy but good eat! <EOR> I prefer location older original only because less wait more spacious  also tend little claustrophobic when am eating   I always go to when coming Crawfish w Hot Juicy Special HOT  Muy caliente  careful Hot your sinuses running  only level 3 out 4 Trust food spicy!

First would say recommend getting shrimp medium spice because gets real spicy that   recommend shrimp instead crawfish because more bang your buck less work your meat   I big group people 14 accommodated really well    When order your food comes big plastic bag filled tastiest sauce spices could ever dream of   un shell your shrimp whatever else order which may seem lot work but once take your first bite godly food won't care anymore because any ounce work always worth next bite   much food price worth leave displeased   never Louisiana but imagine must down if anything might better!  Give try you'll definitely want come back! <EOR> David server great! He kind friendly  Food came hot delicious  Crawfish's huge perfect size  <EOR> First time experience AMAZING! Never somewhere where tables covered plastic everything just thrown table! seafood excellent ordered king crab clams crawfish shrimps  sides ordered Cajun fries rice corn fritters corn cob everything but corn cob good  corn however horrible   didn't taste fresh probably frozen definitely over cooked warm mushy sponge! Despite everything else including staff wonderful   I recommend anyone visiting living Vegas try them out!!! <EOR> Hands down top 5 restaurants town  coming Hot n' Juicy least 10 years always leave satisfied  used live apartments right behind place OHHH bet devastated when moved because wouldn't walking distance gem  location Spring Mountain fine although location lot roomier!

My friends ordered 2 lbs shrimp 2 lbs crab legs 2 Cajun fries sweet potato fries calamari fried catfish!  We ate allllll up   My only concern crabs bit difficult crack but then again used cracking Alaskan crab legs   But other difficult cracking mix all seasonings just great fusion flavors really individualize seafood anything ever tried   And primetime when service pretty fast! Hope they're top game when busy! <EOR> What's better good? Great? No! answer Finger licking good! let tell Hot n Juicy definition finger licking good cause always licking fingers afterwards!   This place delicious  moved Las Vegas period time whenever visited city always always always eat Hot n Juicy least ONCE  always must! flavors unique different  No didn't come due Man vs  Food    fact never watched show  came because heard good first location ALWAYS packed! wait always humongous!   And yes actually two locations second location Spring Mountain  newer decor more modern ventilation should whole lot better first building    So don't crawfish?  fine  don't really preference them either  fact think they're really worth it  Each crawfish doesn't much meat     you'll eating few tons before full! Why? Well Hot n Juicy sells pound     little amount actual edible goodness comes huge clanky shells don't much  But no worries! SHRIMP menu!! course there's crab whatnot menu but  concern  SHRIMP recommendation fill sure!!  So sell seafood pound  choose sauce spicyness level between mild extra spicy  shrimp cooked sauce bring plastic bags  Yes different  Yes may being served food still bag  Sure may using your hands plastic gloves folks  But YUMMYLICIOUS  Prepare messy honestly worth try     adventurous once while  never know you'll come across!  I typically order 1 lb shrimp  Hot n Juicy special  Add corn that  spicyness level depends mood  tried mild medium spicy  Mild best mild traditional mild  actually spicier people would consider mild  delicious little kick gives oomph  Medium very similar mild     no real big difference  Now spicy  REAL kicker! GOOD  SPICY  FLAMING HOT  But honestly mild    I usually also order cajun fries  used them regular fries cajun powder top but now they've incorporated two? knows but pretty good    So sauces lot garlic them  You'll eating smelling garlic all night  sure you're garlic lover! You'll even take smell home careful wear bring in! sure they're all easily washable D   And tip   if you're using your hands eat sure ask waitress some limes lemons  finish eating wipe your hands paper towels rid ALL sauces your hands  Then wash rub your hands lime lemon  thoroughly  should take off good deal smell away your hands  Then just wipe your hands again rid lemony goodness wash your hands regular way!

Thank you <EOR> We're visiting town stumbled across place via Yelp  Loved it! Similar place San Diego same kind peel eat using your hands  Fabulous service great food good prices <EOR> I really hoping place going good reviews but say worst place ever crawfish at  Maybe because just use flavors Houston?   probably because good crawfish San Diego New Orleans  maybe just don't taste frozen crawfish? crawfish tasted over cooked lacked salt  Even though most popular flavor 'hot n juicy' fiancé 'garlic butter' crawfish tasted exactly same  send back  pretty disappointed because really wanted place  If wouldn't taken crawfish off bill would given them 1 star so thanks Hot N Juicy     Other crawfish think rest food good  friend snow crab she said good Cajun fries although received she practically done meal good too  <EOR> H N J good but best bag seafood had        We came Sunday hungry party 5  No line instantly greeted seated    Like real rocket scientists ordered large sample menu 2lbs Snow Crab 2lbs King Crab 3lbs Shrimp 2lbs Craw fish  The seafood quality no complaints size freshness feed  beef seasoning  many boil bag seafood places blown away taste  Yes alot sauce but some reason none stuck meat?!?
