Eggs = vegetarian?! also add pork them very small amount     Excuse but work there? If am sorry if offended your wife cooking although last time checked Yelp open forum people share individual opinions dining experience others   Maybe should use post constructive criticism rather resort childish rants women's 'monthly cycles' though would reason write post where continuously say may 'off day' chef    Regardless Stephen T  post wrote very unprofessional thus proves why recommend anyone eat Mr  chop chop  <EOR> One best deals Las Vegas $5 95 lunch specials which includes drink    some best yellow curry any price people fantastic   Wish still worked vicinity but defintely worth drive! <EOR> Great food   Spicy compared other places watch your order if can't eat spicy   Love pad thai crab fried rice any curry!
