Visited place first time just before new years   Food awesome   service very good!  again when am Vegas  <EOR> HORRIBLE FOOD HORRIBLE SERVICE  But hey female employees all walking body parts sticking pushing thinking ALL that!  NEVER back establishment ! <EOR> My boyfriend shopping Town Square decided try place  Coconuts restaurant Mexico thought maybe part chain but wrong   think 3rd 4th restaurant location sure long stay open     We greeted seated hostess friendly but may first job she really young   took 5 minutes acknowledged server guess weren't station because she took drink orders another server brought them us   ordered bean cheese burrito boyfriend fish tacos   burrito ok but lukewarm best cheese inside barely melted   didn't say anything because figured would just nuke when back would hot eat   chips salsa good but small serving charge them when most Mexican places just give them you     The atmosphere restaurant really targeting younger crowd maybe college students 20 somethings   don't think saw male server but male bartender   girls all cutoffs really really short cutoffs bikini tops   chilly sure when weather colder   also guy blowing alcohol onto flame bottle making big fire ball   Very entertaining     NOT!    reasonably priced if still college would probably great place hang Friday Saturday night   probably again try something else menu but won't regular place dinner me  <EOR> Terrible service terrible food! only thing half way decent drinks overpriced received  never pay chips salsa Mexican restaurant before charge $5  green sauce okay red tasted just canned enchilada sauce  five dining all ordering different items nothing tasted good  food very bland tasteless  When complained waitress manager wouldn't even come over table  All relayed could order something else if didn't ordered  early dinner maybe 3 other tables filled no excuse such poor service long wait receive food  <EOR> Was invited join group friends 4 foot Burrito meal 10 which given promotion  mistake!  The burrito served large cutting board best part meal filling which SUPPOSED beef chicken primarily rice beans   If paying full price $50 would very upset    The salsa chips $5 per small bowl red salsa flat tasteless salsa verde much better   Drinks expensive $7 draught beers  Happy hour 2 1 which reasonable price   The decor very interesting even entertaining   As left tried comment manager lack meat 4' Burrito He tried believe 42 oz meat it  No way!  The promotion seems ploy party ten buy obligatory drinks desperate attempt keep place open  Don't bother  many other places nearby better beer selections way better food    The staff very friendly but slow  Maybe laidback beach atmosphere trying create  advice them would dress resumes  <EOR> AWFUL!! wine n canvas event never again return coconuts wine n canvas  theme place really thing since don't wanna spring break when restaurant but  whatever won't knock them that  talk they're horrible drinks n food though  $8 drink tasted plain pineapple juice n friends tasted straight tequila ordered same thing  wasn't expecting most amazing food going into but even place w flip flops nailed walls pretty bad  no flavor n shrimp friend ordered tasted spoiled  advertise 1 2 off appetizers but don't tell u ANYWHERE only applies ordering bar  Save ur time n money  <EOR> Walked bad service no attention 10 minutes table then another ten no drinks  Trust reviews don't go <EOR> My wife ate hoping tastey Mexican meal   dreadful   beef burrito akin mom's pot roast shredded placed flour tortilla gravy over top   only evident spice salt   wife's cheese quesadilla equally bland     At fourth price Taco Bell closer Mexican this   never return  <EOR> I high hopes new place Town Square  friend having couple drinks somewhere else Town Square wanted see new place going like  say should gone somewhere else  Upon arriving noticed pretty busy thinking might fun  bartenders very attractive draw bar  Once bar noticed extensive margarita mojito list drawn walls  fun touch  finally decided margarita ordered  ordered same friend  First noticed margarita being served small plastic cup guess  cool if spring break Cancun but when paying $8 10 drink Las Vegas expect real cocktail  took sip realized worst margarita ever tasted  cross between cheapest tequila could buy fake lime sugar taste  asked male bartenders margaritas reply however want  think he thought he funny  forcing down drink call margarita decided switch Jim Beam Coke  figured mess up  Well    If consider Jim Beam Pepsi same thing Jim Coke then guess ok letting guest know don't serve Coke products  same drink me  Just saying    I plan back least order any cocktail  guess right when assuming Mexican grille keeping authentic because should stray ordering anything ice just order beer! place won't around much longer  Another flop Town Square  <EOR> Stopped some friends Friday 9PM  before but just drinks stood bar  time wanted some food few rounds  Waitress pretty quick ask wanted but drink orders delivered very slowly especially place being nearly empty  ordered Ranchero burrito which okay mostly peppers steak overcooked didn't enough sauce  While drinks expensive don't skimp them  Jack Coke ordered strong shots Patron practically doubles    One friends ordered cheesecake 15 minutes later found suggested flan instead  hour never receiving asking 3 times finally brought said would comp mistake  But when finally bill charged cheesecake  waitress offered split check which appreciated  Overall friendly but particularly quick  nice place hangout but food service just okay Price little high drinks $8 $15 food $10 $15 per plate  think would back but wouldn't expect much  <EOR> I dinner two weeks ago  First off am Mexican therefore don't tend eat Mexican food restaurants since high standards  But happened very hungry!  So ordered chips salsa Enchiladas del Mar  chips salsa came instantly salsa surprisingly good  spicy but necessarily mild  perfect  devoured chips    Next order enchiladas came out  looked good! put bit salsa chips enchiladas along black bean salsa came entree  AMAZING  mom never made any seafood enchiladas therefore best  shrimp scallops crab made excellent combination  Craving them right now     Needless say enjoyed dinner very much  would definitely recommend Enchiladas del Mar Chips Salsa  Yum! <EOR> Went 4 friends   done bet long place would open?   All food came once   appetizer soup pushed aside  staff very dumb didn't care long empty plates bowls stacked up   give food 4 10      home hungry just hit Millers Yardhouse!!!! <EOR> I hoping location would finally put together good Mexican restaurant   Unfortunately might worse Lolita's   place beach bar mexico impersonates restaurant before 10 pm   waitress really nice but  it   Chips salsa cost 5 00 chips cold semi stale   asked queso cheese presented bowl lukewarm liquid cheese   Fish tacos ok     I sure hope kill nightclub because place die same death Lolita's did if not   really hope figure out  <EOR> The food decent but staff very pleasant deal with  twice only because loved tortilla soup but each time gone waitress very snotty rude  couple other people mentioned staff general slightly lazy  would recommend food other people but atmosphere  can't see establishment staying open very much longer  <EOR> We love Coconuts  staff very attentive friendly food awesome! Definately try fish tacos! best Vegas!! <EOR> KEEP YOUR RECEIPT!!   Especially if your server short Asian Latina girl tribal lower back tattoo   Went Friday 11 25 restaurant com certificate $50 which required spend least $100  wife another couple  all strawberry daiquiri's shot Grand Marnier added it  Shared flank steak fish tacos plantains ceasar salad chili verde  order guac  Ordered more daiquiri hit wall    Our subtotal only $88 server suggested another drink but extremely short time trying show  suggested open charge $12 absolutely nothing just $100 mark  Apparently beyond realm server's comprehension because literally took 35 minutes time asked check    So bill $50+tax 18% pre discounted auto gratuity  Based server's performance $18 tip pushing declined add anything additional  bill split two roughly $36 each tax  Today looked credit card POSTED amount just shy $53  Needless say shady little server graciously added tip    I wish servers restaurants understood concept courses  salad entrees caesar tasted buttermilk ranch dressing  plantains breaded fried bananas but otherwise food quite good   I'm still giving three stars based food but cautious  <EOR> This worst eating experiences ever encountered Las Vegas  service atrocious food bland less desirable    Cocktails disgusting  <EOR> Fabulous drinks delicious food   Timing kitchen could improve   server Kelley fun  <EOR> So very busy night service took seemingly lifetime 1st drinks took 40 min    slow night   nearly same experience water sat empty 30 min ate spicy food   barrow partners water   lame! plus side food okay! <EOR> I saw Yelp review but came anyway coworkers wanted to  ordered shrimp enchiladas as mentioned yelp   asked waiter if corn flour tortillas told corn however flour when received dish  possibly worst spanish rice ever wasn't seasoned all tasted more just butter it  coworkers black beans cooked all way through she said crunchy although mine fine  red sauce enchiladas tasted canned  did fresh brewed iced tea only served Pepsi products am Coke fan myself  opted water  Chips come automatically table if would order them appetizer think $4   absolutely no heat dish all   We coupon otherwise would highly upset cost $13 lunch dish   However choice would back even coupon    On positive note although did look drink list heard lengthy drink list which hopefully work benefit opinion food not  <EOR> Don't bother  dinner place almost empty but hostess told wait bar would 15 minute wait  What!! Decided wasn't going worth wait still waiting 15 minutes  down couple shops excellent dinner crowded Yardhouse  <EOR> The only thing good visit waiter Jason    took hostesses awhile realize when finally seated didn't alert any waiter there    took awhile somebody come he made experience pretty fun over horrible customer service when he nice friendly! Gave good recommendations started good time  10 club opened around 11 so    woman came didn't address herself employee copped attitude told leave because dinner over she sat people table    We'll probably never back    many employees standing messing around tending tables    Hostesses feeling each other messing around instead making sure they're customers helped    Rude club hostess night doesn't know customer service if slapped face    many complaints obviously nobody cares so    Jason very nice but overall experience= place sucks    WON'T BACK    <EOR> Chicken tortilla soup room temp which never good unless meant cold   Chile jalapeño burger greasy warmish   Why nothing served hot here?!?  Left bad case indigestion   should've checked Yelp before eating here   Save your $$ eat somewhere else   Unless want see restaurant before dies  <EOR> Great food! Great service  Fun waitresses bartenders  Management friendly attentive grateful your business  Fun atmosphere  Definitely place check out  <EOR> Had burrito lunch  Checking yelp also scored free desert  Really clean place eat great break outside heat  <EOR> This College Night every Thursday    If want thrown into crowd strangers consisting mostly boppy eighteen year olds' actually chance come into bar day only then place you    I mean because lot 20 year old friends take them dancing time time until reach age opportunity Las Vegas  most part great time because goal night dance did  did buy any drinks because night only 21+ driving    does happen sure but OK  did purchase tiny 12 oz water twice because HOT all those people  However tiny bottle water does justice hydration process $4! mean would OK regular 16oz bottle being $4 but tiny little thing    The first DJ OK but midnight DJ's awesome  called Bombmakers play other clubs cool see them there  music most part good just first DJ did know transition all   fail  Bombmakers  win!   This probably bet only night ever until those friends reach 21st birthdays  find cool just grab drink   10$ gentlemen ladies free another good thing being girl but reality would never want bring guy friend because wouldn't worth $10 fee    Like said good those age fabulous Las Vegas Town Square which love place but all is  <EOR> Our server jason awesome movie only half hour he made happen wish food good service rice bland beans terrible need give some more flavor fish tacos ok girlfriend enchilada meatball soup really good but same complaint rice ans beans terrible overall wasnt bad though   <EOR> Happy Hour!!!

Great fast service food came little close appetizer but slow did order all once  Food 4 5  Come drinks appetizers mainly  little spendy but expect Vegas? appropriate pricing venue location    I sure back again nice cold drink! <EOR> Two stars being generous   We wanted night out   something different last night while Town Square walking around stumbled upon Coconuts Beach Bar Mexican Grill  Let just say place much better when Lolita's Tequila bar  sure why closed but shouldn't have    We looked menu wall outside restaurant figured we'd give shot    When walked greeted hostess next waitress complaining table she just waited on  Luckily able better server  feel bad sweet server had  She deserves work such better place  matter fact observation alone server appeared only place actually cared job    After being seated poorly lit area presented small dinner menu large Margarita drink menu  given water waitress took drink order  20 minutes later received drinks  boyfriend seated facing bar noticed first wrong drink made followed 1 drink coming then other    The food actually best part time there   We ordered guac chips  came quick decent  chips dripping oil freshly made  guac could used little more salt but polished off bowl can't complain much    For dinner ordered Carne Tacos he Del Mar Enchiladas    another 20 minutes food came time eat  meals came rice beans  Both delicious     The menu said Carne Taco's would served 2 corn tortillas  3 tacos single tortilla  meat amazing but covered onions way you'd cover chili dog onions   removing most onions squeeze lime perfect    The Del Mar Enchiladas told very good well     Because checked Yelp did receive free dessert item  Fried Ice Cream which wasn't bad either     Would recommend place friend? Certainly not   back second time dine? No way!    If place wants become successful dining establishment suggest getting rid lazy people don't care job changing menu bit bartenders know drink quickly  Oh subscribe Satellite radio rather streaming Pandora ad's  <EOR> Great atmosphere especially early afternoon  Very chill potential great party place  Ordered classic Mojito enjoyed every sip hot Vegas day  Prices reasonable staff only easy eyes but very kind helpful  <EOR> Stopped lunch today backup another place planning eat closed lunch   read mixed reviews but just looking some stable decent pseudo Mexican fare point   The short list deficiencies include burnt tasting tortilla chips boring salsa dry rice extremely bland al pastor tacos   canned pineapple chunks added garnish most exciting ingredient   The guacamole wasn't bad props that   service good   waiter prompt stopped frequently refills check us   He earned 2nd star them today   I guess expectations weren't heavily skewed   Definitely doesn't trump any taco shop chains massive corporate competitors   think first last visit  <EOR> OMG staff super slow rude food disgusting  never step foot again wouldn't recommend either  <EOR> This review overdue held happy hour event charity Coconuts few months ago staff awesome very accomodating  Jessy Wang manager made sure set appropriately even sent famous 5 foot burritos  servers hostesses very welcoming all guests even participated charitable event kids affected cancer  Very nice staff good attitudes  never full meal but drinks always great  <EOR> Terrible   service took forever   food cold meat very chewy over cooked   no flavor   place filthy looking tables wobbly almost spilt drinks just moving cigarette burns booths  would never step foot place again  Should closed!!! <EOR> Actually haven't eaten there   I lived New Mexico 8 years excited try The Best New Mexican Food Las Vegas but sitting down discusted find table sticky food drinks     We arrived right opening first patrons sit   wife wiped table wet wipe mom arsenal turned over find black filth   Normally table little leftover food doesn't bother but table disgusting   If can't wipe tables clean before open business only imagine kitchen must like   We left before even placing drink order headed over another nearby restaurant   never back   bad because menu items sounded good  <EOR> So media opening restaurant last week fabulous time  A+ service!!! gift card come back use   Came back last night walked no hostess  Waited around which fine because waiting friend  5 mins no acknowledged existence even though bartender server saw me  did see sign seat yourself waited  friend showed stood waiting again  Finally left Yard House   In area much restaurant competition would think would seating customers right away  looking forward chicken enchiladas all day I would only come back use giftcard if actually seat next time!  2 stars because fun first time around  <EOR> Shady acres place  Happy Hour apppears great deal 2 1 beers  knew Cocoloco would charge $6 PBR draft? Seriously record but place upscale cough cough feels its cool us  Bartender says more casual place now yeah casual cause lifeguard chair? $14 burrito's  Next issue 1 2 price appetizers  cheese quesadilla $6 chicken $3 making $9 right? only cheese considered half price chicken extra  didn't agree credit nice changed but bartender bit lippy didn't really look good tanktop put female back   agree its bon voyage place eventually  <EOR> When Vegas off strip   what? yep  Vegas New Years  During time clubs strip take advantage charge girls even! when normally into places free since know people know people lol   Well also couple people group sick decided Blue Martini friday  Boy    dead  walk across mall see Coconuts PACKED!  Yes hit spot  complimented bouncer Nixon watch etc FREE!  On Friday play top 40s but its mostly spanish music salsa cumbia banda bachata  good mixed crowd which typically dont expect latin club   space big enough spread enough dont feel claustrophobic    The DJ own booth its inside chopped off Old school VW van  Pretty neat  fun here  <EOR> Had great experience here   Came lunch family   server great!  He attentive friendly positive   food great!  definately come back when Vegas again  <EOR> I Coconuts few times now food AMAZING  4 foot burrito great partys birthdays feeds LOT people  really nice relaxing day time night blast  employees involved customers sure everyone having great time tell all employees really jobs  food great girls great its blast why wouldnt want Coconuts!?!?!? <EOR> Decor nice but food needs flavor  If bland Mexican you  <EOR> Coconuts Beach Bar   went Wednesday night dead  course 30 minutes before closing when showed but bartender super nice hospitable  Used free dessert checking churros    YUMMY! eat margaritas   The establishment very well maintained looked clean  definitely back again next visit Vegas! <EOR> Coconuts operates weird highly subjective much maligned zone between more authentic thou grubby Mexican high falutin' explorations Border Grill Mesa Grill et al  menu offerings shade more inventive standard Tex Mex they're throwing Velveeta everything please Joe Mary Tourist but if strong opinions Mexican food could workhorse winner something rant car all way home   Speaking Joe Mary Tourist visited Coconuts right before movie Rave across way which exactly perfect circumstance visit   Once cinema saw commercial Coconuts may well government run experiment cognitive dissonance  frat party big screen? boobie innuendos Hooters seem subtle classical allusions female form? Yeah didn't place  fact place I'd avoided ages based some reviews here    The place visited late afternoon 5 30ish full ordinary looking acting couples foursomes perhaps mid 20's mid 50s  Nobody dressed impress  Nobody some state undress  Even music peaceful gently tropical  I think soundtrack 50 First Dates  And although claw machine $2 try pluck lobster win they'll cook it gave moral pause admit overall atmosphere pleasant if they'd just hung items Standard Issue Beach Themed Restaurant Kit    If Coconuts would ditch Waitresses Gone Wild marketing angle could see being family place wink adults fully stocked bar  Family = older kids don't need entertained something other dinner conversation through meal without throwing things screaming  decor fun but isn't Rainforest Cafe  You'd never believe Lolita's same space    kind glad  quite liked food Lolita's which nothing all Coconuts but Lolita's always felt trying very hard sure its cultivated hipness maintained all times   This may well tale two restaurants attractive daytime scene desperate party night    Most appetizers half price during week between 4 6 husband little nuts ordering  he describes review chips very oily heavy  And aren't free norm but since getting great price other appetizers worked out  Salsa nondescript  guacamole okay but huge guac fan unless kind fancy shouldn't allowed vote that    What intrigued cheese enchiladas ordered they're filled Oaxaca queso fresco not unusual but always reassuring when you're middle road restaurant Jack cheddar etc  *and* Manchego less typical choice  Also choose red green sauce just sucker being able tomatillo sauce straight cheese enchiladas  many restaurants seem reserve tomatillo sauce more duded creations  Was meal great? Nah but all solid fare chips aside right price great location relaxed ambiance   One thing see people complaining might strength booze  almost never drink alcohol if drink every year I'd surprised but really mood creative milkshake  decided Almond Joy   The choc coconut concoction tasty hit all chocoholic buttons but only dimly maybe aware alcohol taste didn't feel anything all  almost always giggly flushed few sips booze including foo foo frozen drinks but smoothest alcohol ever served piss weak  Since made husband usually abhors even tiny bit alcohol taste try some he a thought good b couldn't detect alcohol all voting piss weak  didn't mind since dessert experience buzz but if you're paying $10 boozy shake might feel ripped off   I easily see coming back lunch early dinner when want grab sit down bite before movie without paying heaps dealing crowded bar scene dodging strangely limited menus  I'm looking English's  Britain fantastic country vegetarians what's your excuse? Would take out of town friends here? Only if culinary yardstick Mexican food experience more ruler  But much prepared dislike Coconuts surprised me  Re brand tropical getaway every crowd think could fill niche Town Square sorely overlooked  Hmm  <EOR> After looking place dinner girlfriend decided give place try   Before entered said place looks empty  7pm Monday night figured might just off time  decided greeted seated completely dark table asked moved table more light  Just another group seated dark table proceeded use phone flashlights read menus  being disappointed no free chips salsa girlfriend ordered tortilla soup chicken taquitos ordered al pastor tacos   first tried soup thought disgusting both said way better tortilla soup place  grabbed taquito squeezed oil soaked through tortilla onto plate  Completely soaked oil  Bland chicken inside  Although best things ordered would never order them again  Shredded pork bland overly oil marinade  Nothing traditional al pastor   Margaritas the best world advertised  Tasted cheap tequila sweet sour much sweet   Waitress prompt first but think she only restaurant took over 20 minutes food check us  done waiting check 10 those minutes  only reason ate food because hungry  leaving told girlfriend felt wanted throw nasty food eat somewhere else   Both left stomachs feeling sick she developed head ache  owners managers having meeting table while very negative vibes felt both without discussing it   noticed them checking female customers talking them   Very much opposite professionals  Oh yeah other thing song actually came while lyrics the Mexican food really sucks couldn't believe would allow something play but very fitting  think playing pandora something because radio advertisements would come every now then  Also weird  If good real authentic Mexican food disappointed  <EOR> Stay away! Dirty poorly managed just overall sense don't wanna   <EOR> This worst Mexican food ever only reason because husband kept wanting here  He disappointed was  charge chips salsa really bad  wont long if may cater college students  <EOR> This applies Happy Hour only  Picked place meet friends Girls' Night Out  town few days apparently place renovated  Yelp reviews mixed but decided anyway  Service okay server didn't hover but tough attention when needed her drinks okay strong red sangria but food great! ordered multiples ceviche chicken taquitos  Those things yummy! <EOR> This place clean food good  very affordable considering where its located  mean come 7 bucks nachos appetizer could feed 3!  great deal  fajitas pretty cool  they sprinkle tequila them catch them fire your table  Overall great experience  <EOR> I love place!!!  blast Wine Canvas event painting drinking some delicious margaritas!  food great nachos yummy!    reasonably priced staff really great!

CHARGED CHIPS SALSA! Really?  ridiculous  Chips salsa appetizer ALWAYS free any Mexican grill  ordered drinks margaritas came broken glass  guess place turns into nightclub some point because dance floor DJ booth inside Volkswagen van  should just away food focus party because impressed  <EOR> Pineapple Mojitos!

Yum as stated above ! service pretty good   All servers dressed beach style all pretty friendly helping each other out     Definitely worth giving try  <EOR> I'm writing review sitting wondering why even decided try place   First off greeted girl seemed nice enough though she wearing bikini top pushed boobs eyeballs   kinda clue your shorts tight when you're skinny girl yet muffin top over your cut off shorts    She ended being waitress  fair she seems really nice really trying please maybe since complained horrific iced tea    ICED TEA husband ordered iced tea which usual drink any restaurant  tea received opaque could passed Sam Adams beer  Ironically served beer glass  Any iced tea drinker tell should ALWAYS able see through tea otherwise over brewed ridiculously bitter  sent back requested water instead  She apologized said iced tea brewer broken brewed tea through coffee machine  REALLY?? does that?  Later she brought fresh tea received water asked sample see if good  time tea very pale tasted weak  told better but probably needed brewed longer  She proceeded tell just tried add water tea back  oh great     DECOR place definitely college kid hang out  Two big screen tvs played looped video presumably parties restaurant  top table decal stickers strippers pole dancing  Definitely kid friendly scene   Luckily didn't bring kids day  However family 5 came seated booth next us  two young kids  Personally wouldn't felt comfortable bringing kids but each own     SERVICE said under dressed greeter waitress  Seem seemed nice little interaction had  She only other waitress joint busy flirting table 6 college guys seated covered patio outside area other side restaurant us   FOOD ceviche ordered came top 3 tortilla chips gotten soggy juice  fun eat very messy  don't remember husband but ordered shrimp tacos  soggy gross   picked shrimp left rest plate completely dissatisfied  SUMMARY left place still hungry boiling mad whole experience  time did approached manager whole ice tea debacle  manager didn't know since watched waitress bring ice tea over speak it  Poor service poor management poor quality food  wouldn't EVER come back even if stone drunk which guess cater to  If people bothered take beer goggles off would definitely morning remorse  <EOR> Went Thursday around 6 pm hardly anyone there   beer cold guacamole burger good but found rest food little bland   mistake order fixed right away   sat bar bartender friendly   seats tables could use some TLC   Probably would return  <EOR> Honestly    any place checks guys weapons no me  Im really good around thugs hoodlems  little weird   once inside saw why   its tijuana meets southcentral LA   I also shanked nor checked piece carne asada  Just saying     The margarita disgusting sweet barely any alhoohool it  way expensive  Sorry     rather favorite hole wall mexican restaurant place  least wont shanked robbed raped checked abducted touched  <EOR> This restaurant located town square upstairs across movie theaters across Ranch house restaurant   Went lunch  very busy only 5 tables occupied  The hostess seat lousiest  spot room most room empty its pretty big place  asked seated booth  Wow seemed really piss off she brought booth pinned against rail next pillar  sitting down see holes booth seats cigarette burn holes  Really?? can't even smoke restaurant month 2 new  The decor kinda beach swap meet furnishings coming together bad way  booth table top Way high where your plate would chest high  Very awkward  post couple pics give flava    The menu looked sounded good but couldn't smell anything vibe bad left before eating   Normally give second shot but many things wrong short time  worth time nor deserve money  won't return <EOR> Can't say nuts Coconuts Beach Bar Mexican Grill    Although visit Town Square quite often first time here  wasn't choice but because couple girlfriends' birthday  What's funny bar wasn't first choice wanted shindig Miller's Ale House but couldn't because packed UFC fight    This place super roomy  But roomy many places sit down  probably because hold lot college parties bumpin' music whatnot  party stuck close bar  bar itself pretty large size but only guy running around serving drinks  Maybe another bartender but presence known    I ordered watermelon margarita myself classic margarita pineapple malibu birthday girls  three came $26  thought way pricey got  pineapple malibu served small plastic cup  two margaritas served margarita glasses but rims weren't salted  can't say anything classic margarita since didn't taste but watermelon margarita tasted pretty bland  definitely scratching head hoping swig tequila next sip  pink color pretty all but tasted single jolly rancher melted down full glass water    There advertisements all over town square 4 foot burrito   Sounds cool but hear doesn't taste very good  hear 10 people your party order them serve it    Speaking advertisements pre movie commercials play theaters Coconuts  If you've seen know two girls dressed teeny bikinis holding coconuts enticing people come food drinks  Saturday night no signs girls bikinis  Sorry break all boys but might well Blue Martini next door hottie bartenders if  you're looking for! <EOR> Absolutely bad some reviews suggest   Despite always being keen some other options Town Square wife scared off negative Yelp vibe which ranged between 2 2 5 star average only recently climbed 3  would say three stars just right bordering 3 5   We during happy hour which uncrowded food more decent  Service fine too   The only thing would suggest line industry standard free chips salsa keep guac optional extra pay for possibly something chips which wasn't keen on  bit oily taste seemed just wrong side being overcooked  Perhaps try different oil change more often  don't know  salsa could more interesting would love see bean dip   Overall though happy hour specials appetizers great bargain  enjoyed wings nachos decent price   I'm sure would seek Coconuts but if am Town Square fancy bit Mexican see no reason return  remarkable but terrible  some better chips salsa solid 4  <EOR> I really hate give any place bad rating try find good every place go  Having said review little sad but more then little cranky!  Note self If something menu then chances don't want order it!!!  mexican place doesn't nachos menu? Well doesn't unfortunate find good reason!   The food just awful! tortilla soup cold very bland version tomato soup      I don't think place last long unless am missing something profoundly different experience     very disappointing! <EOR> Like Lolita's before fear Coconut's soon fail    fate brought themselves   Walking into coconuts reminds tackier cheesier version Rainforest Cafe and yes said more tackier restaurant itself looks tropical run down beach shack  fake palm trees random flip flops wall beach theme which Hollister Co  pulls infinitely better Coconuts definitely deserves own page book 'How Design Restaurant '  The food average but priced decently Town Square  3 tacos side beans rice came around $9  could worse  food itself bad but wasn't impressive either    The service other hand great which probably why place isn't star  manager possibly owner brought food incredibly helpful  Though find odd pretty much everyone works required wear short shorts flip flops   From understanding place turns into College Frat party area cheap drinks loud EDM latin music certain nights  guess nightlife aspect could appealing but would definitely pass another Coconut's dining experience  <EOR> I love going Coconuts almost everyday  atmosphere people food GREAT! also love going events!  You should all come check least once swear you'll hooked  servers bartenders food even BOTH! <EOR> I few months ago really wanted give them 3 stars because waiter very friendly  Shout guy whoever are  did appreciate doing your best accomodate group but just wasn't enough rest experience    The girls working front barely looked old enough knowledgable happy hour policy restaurant german shephard seen walking outside earlier day  think paid stand look cute because  all good no offense girls whoever were I suppose if rating place solely bar then wouldn't harsh  happy hour priced Stone beer $4  bad guess  interior looks kinda neat tropical you  suppose could double your fun showing hawaiin shirt   Unfortunately did try alot food certainly impressed  suppose most tolerable food beef tacos  Kinda tasty bite  sized  really did care ceviche?? [Is its spelled?]  Well tasted before much better  chips very mediocre guacamole  I serious doubts whether freshly made  tasted stuff comes packet refrigerated section supermarket  value food wasn't bad but if mood happy hour eats many better options there  Sorry coconuts   you just didn't me  <EOR> We Town Square looking something different since Yardhouse packed   Walked Coconuts reminded bit Cabo decided give try   party 3   Service server kept apologizing lack service making wait long   He also never checked table food served see if needed anything  attention mgr refills drinks   tried free desert said because couple large parties but looked more lack communication mgmt didn't really care   Food burritos actually pretty good desert    only reason many stars   Cocktails Drinks much ice price   Moral story drink beer mojitos margaritas similar Mexico   Hopefully figure out   3rd restaurant location   Sink succeed   Service name game  <EOR> Visited 1 28 12 1 29 12  Tried come Saturday night around 930pm   Nope late kitchen closed 9 30pm    Seriously weekend?

P  I Coconuts first time boyfriend weeknight  setting full bright colors beach décor quintessential Spring Break setting  lot space imagine would fun place busy night  Unfortunately when visited 3 4 tables  Though missed some excitement fact wasn't busy prevented getting lost sea which sometimes happens when many customers enough employees   Right away compliment staff swift attentive service  slow night but full staff never wait ANYTHING  BAM! seated  BAM! received water table  BAM! [FREE] Chips salsa appeared nowhere  BAM! drinks ready! BAM! dinner there  top servers staff all seemed attentive polite  Oh ya did mention EVERYONE works gorgeous?!

Online sexy innuendo stiff drinks let tell you   just cute catchphrase  couldn't finish drink and trust love some margaritas ! You've warned! P S  noticed lot reviewers complained WEAK drinks! must completely different bartenders! Another thing chips tasted weird me  might crazy but detected faint ranch flavoring them  sure if seasoning salt tortillas chips made maybe taste buds just shot margarita   but wasn't fan  confess non pinto lover didn't try beans came side  Also Spanish rice sprinkled peas bit bland tasted microwaved  However overall quite impressed entrees  say really enjoyed cheese enchiladas topped red sauce served upon request $2 side seasonal grilled vegetables  veggies sautéed perfection made might ordinarily plain enchiladas totally scrumptious  boyfriend liked steak fajitas which loaded onion garlic other seasonings    Overall I'd say check Coconuts  Fun environment  Good service  Fine food  drink your drunk! <EOR> Fantastic service food drinks   Staff management very friendly    Ask bartender special drink   really liked beef enchiladas  <EOR> Went Tuesday night around 9pm very prompt service  hostess very welcoming server Clay very friendly gave excellent recommendations  never tomato sauce based ceviche before but tasted pretty good! guacamole appetizer savory taste well  extensive drink menu must say am fan Mango Mojitos  <EOR> HAPPY HOUR!
