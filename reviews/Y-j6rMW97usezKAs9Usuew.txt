BEST PANCAKES AMERICA definitely understatement  Managers personable visit all tables which think really cool  Everything super fresh taste when eat your food  Service also great didn't feel ever left without being asked if needed something  Can't wait San Diego location open! <EOR> I usually downtown location first time coming suncoast its close where live! Service attentive food came quickly  short stack egg which thankfully tasted exact same! only thing wish prices weren't high both downtown  understand downtown its tourist destination but being suncoast busy prices should bit lower  Or provide meal options different times day other midnight 11am short stack 2 pancakes 1 egg literally 1 egg shouldn't $15  <EOR> Du pars should renamed Sub Pars   Gone delicious food encountered last year while visiting Vegas   Service lacking well But food reprehensible  The sad part place good past looking forward having multiple times most recent vacation but once enough   We opted dine outside Suncoast remainder trip just visit subpars   Not sure continue support location given all options area  Pretty sad update  <EOR> This located within Suncoast visited twice  Each time great food great service  Manager Jimmy came visited checking food service  last visit enjoyed french toast eggs turkey sausage   The pastry chef needs bland taste buds checked but otherwise food fantastic  juices all fresh all foods prepared fresh onsite  <EOR> Bummer no shrimp cocktail   Las Vegas practically shrimp capital world don't serve here   left Dupars downtown shrimp cocktail on   Won't returning location   server nice  <EOR> Well well   another overpriced LA restaurant its way valley   First positives excellent coffee server very pleasant  And now other shoe exactly 1 week before ate Grand Cafe Red Rock paid full $20 less meal 3 people comparable orders food twice good there  mean tri tip cheddar barely 3 thin slices meat enough cheese fill mousetrap $14? $4 50 tiny slice pie?  This place belongs Strip locals casino  Bad move Boyd Gaming  don't give place year judging number empty tables  <EOR> After visiting downtown Du Par's location multiple times decided show some love new Suncoast location    Please keep mind to go order   My family wanted breakfast dinner ordered following full stack French toast blueberries full stack pancakes three orders hash browns  total came nearly $35   We assumed blueberries French toast would compote  Instead 10 fresh blueberries chillin' French toast  Okaaaaaay?!? The pancakes nothing perfect pancakes repeatedly experienced downtown location  didn't even clarified butter side  fact gave cheap butter gold wrapper  only good thing pancakes warm maple syrup    Our hash browns looked good  little crispy top but soft middle  shame extra bland! Even ketchup could lack taste   Although location conveniently located near home gladly drive little further downtown Du Par's  <EOR> I am updating review based Du pars lowering prices since did but step right direction  problem food which think average little better average but prices which high kudos realizing taking action  <EOR> Since Cubs last series game casino's big screen decided first dinner Du Par's   read advertisement Clock dinner specials 4 6 00 daily if arrive 4 00 pay $4 00    walked into almost empty restaurant 4 30 chose big red booths   Service immediate but don't tell you You must each purchase $3 00 beverage chose coffee tea it dark Lipton    coffee came small cup Du Par's then must wait til' refilled server   ordered salmon bed spinach w red potatoes spaghetti meatballs   white sauce contained no spinach 2 small pieces potato miniscule piece salmon   partner's spaghetti meatballs contained 2 tiny meatballs tasted just ground beef small portion pasta tasted Chef Boyardee   accompanied half white toast mine w o bread roll   Du Par's regular menu B L D expensive espec  big coffee shop   Even pies case look anemic size brag they're made fresh daily   Perhaps restaurant reminds oldsters good old days but just another rip off  <EOR> No more pancake egg combo  Now order full egg breakfast add short stack $6 00 side  little costly now    I would traditional combo back  <EOR> When friend Leo stumbled across Du Par's Sun Coast Casino last week finding treasure past  food writer pray find places where everything made home made attention detail evident every where look  Du Par's bakes best banana cream pie ever ate Leo agreement too  My dinner next night fantastic Gourmet Meat Loaf Dinner  <EOR> I Du Par's today daughter  no idea name history just convenient place eat  But ended being great experience!

It big pieces clams creamy  Good stuff! 4 stars because breakfast wasn't best  ordered omelets weren't bad except when order 3 cheese would expected  lot cheese but wasn't lot  And said homemade hash browns well far home made  seemed deydrated kind just don't cook enough outside crunchy but inside best tasting  Service pretty good waitress good she top everything  She did tell pancakes awesome maybe worth trying  Would back? I'd say maybe Wednesday Friday clam chowder again try something else sure! <EOR> Wow stoked there's Du par's Vegas besides downtown  those unfamiliar food they're known pancakes  batter different any other pancake ever life  slight chewy texture flavor amaaaaazing    It's bit pricey almost $10 short stack three pancakes but totally worth it    I really liked hashbrowns asked extra crispy eggs pork sausage links  corned beef delicious    Awesome service!   I'd definitely skip muffins  taste rally strange bread like batter rather fluffy cake batter  also recommended eat biscuit but looks brioche bun totally threw off guard   Either way always back simple amazing buttermilk pancakes  <EOR> Best pancake world! buttery melts your mouth!
