This location isn't bad  smells pretty bad summers though dumpster isn't far drive through speaker  <EOR> The main reason come Sonic Tater Tots   Man love those little potato barrel nuggets   Simple salty hell delicious   If need tot fix solid choice   But      tots just side well most people    Sonic also burgers hot dogs but they're mediocre   But town n' Five Guys why would order fast food burgers Sonic?   So leave burgers alone   Eat tots meal  <EOR> Normally reserve review writing restaurants serve great food exception time   Everyone knows Sonic isn't best place eat unless want your arteries clog your heart fail generally just come every now then shake tater tot fix   I happen drop frequently because big fan Rt  44 Diet Coke  isn't favorite Sonic  awesome Warm Springs Eastern but sometimes closer me    So drop day sit sit sit just waiting oh so difficult order soft drink  see person through drive thru then another then another  finally buzz asking where drink is  lunch job isn't easy delivering drink customer back it  wait see ANOTHER car through  buzz again  few minutes later FINALLY someone comes give drink  Without straw  Nice    So give dump another chance drop today  time coupon free drink  often deserve free every now then  some teenager attitude problem working Sonic course do confront ask coupon  tell use all time  He demands again  tell manager  manager barely speaks English comes discuss problem him  He PRETENDS he cares going fix problem    I wait wait wait  Nothing  buzz ask drink anyone see pattern?
