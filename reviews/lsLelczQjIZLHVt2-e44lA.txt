Brownie mostly sweet uniquely flavorful pretty standard stuff  But entree enough earn place 4 stars! <EOR> I breakfast Stewart Ogden two mornings row part because lazy but mostly because didn't know $10 discount first round come back!  restaurant located inside new Downtown Grand Hotel   small but character   breakfasts decent reasonably priced hotel breakfast staff friendly   The first day standard eggs bacon toast breakfast all fine   bacon particularly good but toast cold put your own butter know butter cold toast works out   Bummer   second day lemon ricotta waffles oddly also cool temperature wise    sure what's serving food hot    could server issue kitchen but disappointing   Both good flavor waffles came covered blueberries other berries kind half fresh half sort compote   little odd but bad   My husband big breakfast eggs bacon potatoes pancakes first day which he enjoyed ranchero scramble next day which seemed kind small but he said tasted good   He did complain temperature food but he'll eat anything   Overall I'd eat if staying Grand but doubt I'd special trip eat here  <EOR> I've gone twice now both times really enjoyed experience  restaurant very casual nice stop being downtown all night  sat bar both times Anthony bartender  He very attentive friendly few friends no idea order he suggested some cool drinks them very impressed  food good when ordered first visit fresh baked cookies awesome did food second time but back  <EOR> This place EXCELLENT  ordered caesar salad $7 95 grilled shrimp +$5 50 side steamed rice $3 whipped butter grapefruit juice  meal simple delicious restaurant really long time truly great value quality  Everything salad picturesque evenly distributed  grapefruit juice fresh squeezed unsweetened shrimp seasoned wonderfully  chefs clearly just terms letting flavors ingredients talking  service also on point professional attire approach attentive without going overboard checking in  love place really look forward future visits   I also ordered strawberry ice cream $3 double espresso  Fresh ice cream smooth espresso perfect finish excellent experience today   Unfortunately restaurant smokey adjacent casino without having doorways  course prevailing theme any Las Vegas casino but restaurant less appealing non smokers  Doors enhancing ventilation filtration would really help this  Still 5 stars easily  <EOR> This great joint dinner though most times late night food  great late night specials food which wonderful late night drinking before heading room   Everything menu great  advertised steak special superb price size    The only consistent complaint speed service   very slow   point accepted part atmosphere but does frustrating when waiting more water pay bill sleep  <EOR> Solid 4 star experience late night outing 2am establishment  restaurant now open between midnight 6am limited menu  new change   Considering 2am server Chanel great attitude knowledgable when asked questions  sweet but tough work shift Vegas Saturday night   I stayed hotel many times since open last fall never felt drawn eating called Stewart Ogden now going S+O   While loved decorations felt if menu trying really hard upscale when hotel sorely needed solid coffee shop   even Bellagio one   I pleased see lot smart changes being made hotel bring more people  some S+O apparent through hotel advertising  offer prime rib special late night breakfast $4 95 such bring people   Everyone loves good deal downtown  50% off regular menu locals discounted late night menu though So good  ordered some hot water lemon much cheap protecting throat  late night menu small but liked 2 95 3 95 4 95 8 95 options    Meatball sliders fries 3 95  solid little dish tasty flavorful  only comment server agreed need more marinara sauce  know chefs job keep kitchen costs down but don't want dish cheap feel cheap    said 3 95 gets just order fries some coffee shops   Taquitos 2 95 looked little sad upon arrival but once past lame lettuce garnish tasted good    Especially since ate sliders first sitting bit  sorta ordered them thought just see food 2 95  recommend chef serves pico de gallo maybe small salsa some sort     Creme brûlée 4 99 Chanel offered curious little sign said desserts $3 up It fresh berries added lot it   heard fave many guests  Solid portion sure   Wrap carouse around vegas am much more likely end evening S+O now offer late night  All tables around seemed happy  Remember late night always takes little longer but quality food way better late night stop jack box    If added more marinara solid salsa would 4 5 5 star easily  <EOR> My husband hung Downtown Grand quite bit last trip Vegas  checking menu sold butterscotch pudding    The service fantastic really friendly attentive  food really good well  pub cheese French onion soup fish chips butterscotch pudding  highly recommend pub cheese pudding  fresh baked chips served warm cheese dip amazing even refill chips finish off dip  everyday see homemade butterscotch pudding menu  might very top list but would eat again sure  <EOR> Great staff tasty food low price  Great place quick bite long night partying <EOR> Emily needs

applewood smoked bacon potatoes   bacon excellent pancakes above average   For $10 Graveyard Shift certainly no graveyard special didn't see any bargain prices diner   OJ $3 escaped $14+ bill before tip  The decor hurt eyes bet updated within year two  I'd try again but nothing your way for  <EOR> Our server Israel knowledgeable menu sold ordering Dr  Pepper Pot Roast which everything ordered amongst friends probably best  Those mac n cheese said wasn't anything special   tator tots perfectly crisp but gnocci little mushy   manager came table say hi which made feel welcomed  Overall satisfied but don't think am going frequent loyal visitor   Things would suggest improving if management include drink menus all tables I wanted order drink but didn't know specialties ended ordering diet coke portions larger mac n cheese more od side dish more additional signature items menu include some breakfast dishes I'd love come latenight omelet   Good service prices right  <EOR> Since last review menu expanded decor much needed upgrade  Well done!   With new additions still some execution issues tuna sliders cooked all way through  yeeek  but overall way better dining experience previous visit  Managers hand quick fix problem lunch     poorly made food off bill cinnamon roll waffles house matter minutes  bad   Looking forward next visit try more new menu which way more say last visit  5 star upgrade <EOR> So decided give place another chance because givin $10 off coupon hotel  decide sit bar since myself just wanted bar tender helping name Brian he very nice helpful  order mimosa $8 00 create your own omelette $13 +cheese  89cent  Once again did take long time 35 minutes food served me  Once did food send omelette back because still juicy completely done  Once food served back ate ok wouldn't say best but least actually food time stars 3 starts instead one  <EOR> I wouldn't recommend onion rings unless your tipsy  Chili pretty good fresh jalapeños it  <EOR> Came dinner Christmas  service spot based other reviews  waiters spend much time back waiting food when could multi tasking  waiting 15 mins credit card actually leave  Food good understand new spot but seriously don't plan leaving  <EOR> The night place just off    Service took long time take drink orders longer food order  Refills tough come waitress es seldom visible  stand 5 minutes waitress stand just check pay it  know late night when but professionalism throughout whole staff seemed less normal restaurant Vegas    Food nachos came less room temperature big glob coagulated canned cheese product slopped top  sent back  replacement nachos still weak wet barley warm  steak eggs granted only $4 95 but way overdone promise cut meat steak family  potatoes really good  toast   skillz    Price $12 nachos steak eggs coffee two waters bad pay for    Atmosphere spot casino even more    I would actually back if food credit maybe try something else menu hopefully then staff back sync replaced    2 stars Cuz those potatoes good coffee hot  Thanks nothing  <EOR> Have gone several times work $4 95 steak eggs  Well now $6 95  last night   live price increase BUT service abysmal! always little slow but when sat down last night when finally able check took almost hour half!  place maybe third full should no reason delay receiving food having wait check   work  service industry know meaning word SERVICE!

Probably myself personally but know company does business Grand premise events functions but food something won't take part in   I hope find consistency fix situation soon  young restaurant there's still hope them though won't eat again wish them success      now heard coworkers Hash House chicken waffles!
