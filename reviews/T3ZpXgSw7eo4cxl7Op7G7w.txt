El Patio offers okay food affordable prices  Complimentary chips salsa nice beginning meals  lunch specials poor college students  ordered tacos enchiladas burritos  favorite tacos flavorful hot  also offer $1 95 margaritas UNLV students holla! but never tried honest  But $1 95? Possibly great place smashed post finals  restaurant tiny but cozy quaint  sure if wanna visit soon though  Probably just el cheapo margarita  <EOR> I've always great service food's always pretty decent  really come though $2 margaritas  Woohoo student discount! <EOR> My 18 month old son diarreah 3 days still going well second day   passed few other Mexican restaurants way thinking trust quality more since across street UNLV but uneducated assumption must admit   If used cleanliness quality highly recommend avoiding <EOR> We Groupon  might know love Mexi food   This place right near UNLV strip mall   This time brood us  Its true hole wall  service just OK but food great!   Its authentic gets    They kid's menu pretty much wanted burgers chicken fingers quesadillas    My gf fish tacos which cooked griddle battered fried many places do  She said best she's restaurant  Big compliment!   I tacos lengua  Yes tongue! delicious! many places dish right    They two condiment sauces verde red  both ton flavor decently spicy   The kids enjoyed food too    All all great visit would back again  time just no kids! <EOR> Get bucket beer maybe few muppet shots chicken burrito call it   the beginning night  Its great place listen jukebox crazy  sure being empty beer bottle outside if plan walk anywhere surrounding neighborhood  may need break over attacker's head  <EOR> My receipt said Mazatlan but signs say El Patio Authentic Mexican Food   Yet another fabulous Vegas meal off strip   couldn't believe people waiting line across parking lot Chipotle when could eating here   decor tries hard   service top notch   chips thin tasty salsa mild yummy   veggie burrito verde sauce instead ranchero sauce normally comes with   deliciously flavorful filling   sparking water tax meal came $7 54   Fantastic!  only negative noise which first consisted TV then consisted another TV showing something different louder volume then finally drowned terrible song blasted jukebox  <EOR> Walking into empty restaurant always disconcerting   But figured weekday evening area bit dead beyond people nearby laundry mat   Immediately upon seating friendly waiter beverage orders   He returned also chips salsa   soon devoured all he asked if wanted more which gladly accepted     For dinner chose Shrimp Fajitas $12 50 which served rice beans tortillas corn flour    quite surprised generous shrimp   plenty definitely leftovers   The Husband ordered Steak Enchilada your choice kind also came rice beans tortillas   He also surprised tasty steak used good marination   real surprise winner refried beans   Husband loving version   good but guess fan refried beans general especially little cheese swirled    We also caught music videos while dinner  You don't see music videos anymore! Overall pretty good Mexican food without breaking budget   course helps when there's coupon Entertainment Book  They also other coupons available since mention 20% ? tip added bill before any coupon applied   didn't mind actually because waiter very attentive  3 5 stars  Sidenote also menu cakes sheet maybe lot business way too  Pics posted! <EOR> Absolutely Worst Service Ever!!! few coworkers decided try because purchased  coupon restuarants com  When showed owner coupon she rolled eyes walked away  When she finally came back take order couldn't order any lunch specials which indicated coupon  didn't even water drink  food decent however owner snarl face indicated she happy serving us  When she brought check totaled always she over charged $2 20  huge deal but wanted know   she snatched receipt hand sighed loudly she walked away  When she returned she fixed price where all added but instead paying $2 20 less she increased other prices them add up  point figured would just pay money instead arguing because she barely spoke english  gave $40 $24 41 bill  she returned $11  point try explain she shorted change additional $4 then she yelled oh god! snatched paper walked away  When she returned she highlight random parts receipt but problem just wanted right amount change  tell stop listen showed calculations phone when she realized she made mistake again she snatched paper hand stormed off keep mind give woman $10 tip because coupon pay 18% full bill before coupon   She came back dropped money table walked away   no apology no gratitude nothing  never never never eat again recommend no either   by way food mediocre portions skimpy  Eat Here!!!!!!! <EOR> This week seems week need twenty minute meal  Twice week walked into place asked think food outta twenty minutes? meeting to  Today planning running Chipotle grab couple tacos but place overrun UNLV students  no way going twenty minute tacos there  spotted completely empty El Patio decided promising   Walked stated demands  agreeable  asked chicken taco then realized needed more  ordered another then waiter suggested just lunch special rice beans $6 50  easy upsell ended whole sha bang    The meal came quickly promised must say pleasing  tacos little small but fresh warm soft tortillas doubled filled white meat chicken  chicken seasoned swimming sauce  beans rice good greasy heavy  chips salsa disappointing  perfect little meal job done   The décor atmosphere very simple  some classy college humor signs wall including such gems No shirts shoes skirt no problem  server friendly despite fact all three clothing items    With $1 95 margaritas UNLV students don't know why heck all those kids over Chipotle  Since when did college students start valuing chains over cheap booze? Kids today  I just don't know but know El Patio El Soliditito  Next time dedicate bit more time actually looking menu  such drive experience feel if am only qualified give solid three stars  <EOR> WHOLE WALL  Stopped work Friday night place empty surprisingly but just made all easier drink b much selection bar mood some El Jimador dismay didn't available  did however try shot Buchanas  recommended bartender  YUM D  Tried old fashioned margarita rocks eh ok  better  But cheap nice size around $5 50 waitress very polite even offered put little extra D    She recommended try salsa dip  tasted home made but way watery  wasn't impressed  bartender suggested try Guacamole DIP scale 1 10 I'd give 6! bad  Unfortunately all had    Aside being being very quiet slow night lighting bar kept dark chairs old overall place seemed little run down  BUT supposedly per bartender owner bar process  remodeling place separate kitchen bar  think place potential little fixing would neat little place relax some grub drink D <EOR> While searching food near school run into Mazatlan Yelp plenty times  3 reviews all 5 star  also say restaurant really called El Patio foolishly never searched reviews El Patio under name  Mistake!  Well yesterday 4 12 11 school+work+social days started 7 30 AM ended when finally home 2 30 AM morning 4 13 11 I'm already back school even 9 AM days today yesterday pretty much food because can't bring picnic basket worth food sustain throughout day  Yayo Taco believe wasn't open 10 30 AM yesterday decided try El Patio    I only person when walked other older guy came kitchen eat  friendly guy chef's whites asked if wanted anything drink asked water  He said it'd right back kitchen   A lady took order looked over menu  prices little steep get! ordered nachos asked if came meat  told yes  told no meat isn't included price listed menu extra  ended spending $7 something chicken nachos  reasons unbeknownst ordered pina colada    10 30 morning  didn't any sort student discount came $3 75  Yeah $12 something more wanting spend kinda sucks   So decided chill all lonesome copy Weekly passable pina colada while waited food  Between texting storm watching Spanish music videos 3 tvs wasn't bad eating myself  lady took order brought chips salsa which neither bad nor good  nachos when came weren't very flavorful  Unfortunately even place Roberto's place mile  tre disappointed    The staff friendly but food very bland  gonna stick Yayo Taco  <EOR> This supposed place drink specials UNLV students but night ordered mango margarita sugary watered down barely could taste feel alcohol it  While margaritas cheap enough would pass getting drink because margarita machines need tune staff which might add friendly despite poor quality food drinks doesn't know properly them The chips salsa bland well enchilada   Try experience but other Chipotle only but minute away  <EOR>
