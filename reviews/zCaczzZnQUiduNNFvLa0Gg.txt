Not family friendly advertised  kids under 16  MC lots inappropriate jokes nun pregnant priest drunk etc  <EOR> Don't confused reviews  great show but need interactive plays  upgraded VIP recommended better salad perfect view  actors messed table guests all around good humor  Some actors did seem burned but other ones made lack enthusiam  food its buffet style yes but expecting wine'd dine'd ritz! gave 4 stars  believe interactive play tough  work your surroundings did great job  Thanks Tony Tina's! <EOR> For almost $400 boyfriend parents seated behind pillar couldn't see actors  retrospect probably good thing since actors simply could act  boyfriend's mother sure former high school students could better job acting  actor particular sat just he supposed proceeded inappropriate comments religion  He then belittled spending money alcoholic beverages  guessing only way actually enjoy show drink lot alcohol during it  walked before dinner  Unfortunately tickets nonrefundable  Hands down   the worst show ever seen Las Vegas  Please waste your money! <EOR> I Tony Tina's Wedding Las Vegas NV 10 7 2012   inside Bally's Casino    first time seen it   great time   price VIP ticket $119 12 but add $15 00 convenience charge ? real amount $134 12   While price may seem high   both dinner show combined   sit table #3 some Nunzio family including father groom   enjoyed every minute it  <EOR> This show caught special through GoldStar   pasta really good chicken parmesean  much activity going during performance distracted finishing meal   interactive play dysfunctional Italian east coast families act large family weddings  Bon Jovi type singer did crowd sing a long dance floor  <EOR> Want something very unique memorable dinner date? recommend Tony Tina's Wedding  dinner show where watch Tony Tina married family feuds break during reception  really cool concept because actually guest wedding  talk actors actresses  attending funny dysfunctional wedding  full entertaining drama  does start off little slow but picks show on    The food just okay  buffet style  offer vegetarian option  sure if menu changes but served pasta chicken  Even though food just okay overall experience worth attending least once! <EOR> I love silly little show  Yes dinner theatre but seriously fun dinner theater  If enjoy weddings all silliness drama them then show you  great thing drama coming your family laughter acceptable  ticket includes food dancing lots fun laughter  <EOR> Pretty good show   it actually second time seeing show but first Ballys location   It really improved venue change food much better actually surprised portions big! husband aren't really big Italian food but theirs actually pretty good  show pretty funny random very engaging   we stayed general admission which think much better deal because VIP empty seats didn't seem worth it    Good show good food nice laughs! <EOR> Just came show    amazing!!! service beyond exceptional! accommodated dietary needs made special dish non dairy items just me  show hilarious made feel family event! <EOR> Ok originally Italian New Yorker   felt wedding back home except food wasn't good uncle Larry wasn't slipping kids booze   food pretty good but table ran salad before other friends never brought any more even though asked twice   laughed danced overall good time but wasn't something would pay full price again  <EOR> Kinda awkward but somewhat funny  Maybe just wasn't expecting dinner interactive  less show  and more interactive improv play  If your into then may better you  <EOR> This totally fun experience  But honest say  because only paid $20 tickets + free drinks really into it  If you're looking just sit enjoy show you  If looking your money's worth paying full price ticket you  But if low expectations cheap ticket want dance fun you   1 pay attention follow movements characters  They're always doing and or saying something  But keep where try hear they're saying  If your eyes only front center only listen dialogue broadcast over sound system miss out  funniest moments ones think most people totally failed notice   2 need into fun it  Interact other folks actors  dance floor  Party up!  3 Don't hungry  food stellar  most any real wedding expect typical wedding food  i e  Mediocre chicken bleh cake  did kinda veggie pasta though   Follow those three things could blast show  But know going into it  Some couples table looked absolutely miserable truly disappointed  <EOR> My sister came Vegas long ago  very excited seeing musical Broadway hit but sister told should see Tony Tina's Wedding  along but soon found myself regretting it   After going inside found table back away main stage  hard see anything actually happening  jokes dull dry    On top food offered really really really bad that's 3 times!   cheap fake food would never touch life let alone actually eat it    That only show saw hope never see again  <EOR> Show funny food good   As show wedding party little drama  As food some salad plate chicken breast bread veggies   Stuff person show rude   Show overpriced quality show food  same money way more other shows Las Vegas money left some nice food well  <EOR> I once while dear friend Damon it   He fell conked himself head backstage disappeared halfway through show   would say if weren't worried would more engaged show however don't think would been   It's no doubt fun but coming theatrical background kind seems improv game gone awry   But most improv games don't all eat Italian buffet!  Again flip side food really isn't all good   It's bad show but definitely glad didn't shell money it  <EOR> Had great time  fun definitely recommend attending Tony Tina's wedding once your life  hilarious! much cheaper order tickets Vegas com <EOR> Do waste your TIME $$$   someone else mentioned better waste slot machine   screwed your money lot more quickly painlessly   Saw show last night group girlfriends bachelorette party  wasted valuable time could napping before going later   We tix Groupon $49 but audience should really paid watch and or related actors  food bad even your own plastic water cups bar   actors table one groomsmen bridesmaids funny tried best entertain did bit times   captured spirit wedding in bad food crappy music searching one's soul feign enthusiasm bonding strangers bad show was     Most accents jokes bad uncomfortable watch   Maybe funny 30 years ago?

Upgrading VIP well worth it! <EOR> I can't believe people managed leech $100 attend unforgivable clusterf ck   The only thing imagine possibly rationalizing bad food bad entertainment bad venue that    well    suppose possible stereotypical Italian weddings really this    reason simply don't any due fact even close being Italian   WORST    SHOW    EVER  I can't adequately emphasize bad show was   mean just bad   BAD BAD BAD   absolutely reached new never before seen levels badness   Historians mark day day humanity's timeline where just badness but extreme prehistoric badness discovered     In order illustrate insane unbridled badness show let recant some thoughts during more memorable moments during show   [What the   ?  Why Sopranos type guy forcing take picture him?   $20?  photo didn't even want take first place?  thought going theatre some sort   Why traversing hallways along ass end hotel?]   [This sure long walk BFE   Wait    We're going outdoors    ROOF casino?

Really!  The actors very good try hard audience involved  confused random guy kept talking until realized he show! Awkward  The food nothing special appears buffet but each person gets small salad chicken Parmesan bread stick  No going back more food if still hungry  Oh wedding cake but snuck before cut cake    If looking cheap show don't recommend one! <EOR> The actors really nice but wow    this show outdated  Did know expect heard funny but twilight zone  really bad  show around many years could tell stuck back time  food bad too   Sorry but waste money time   revamp show! <EOR> Just good   Stereotyping comedic effect   Every tacky italian joke think of   know they're all classless gum chewing screamers   Pair really bad wedding food   Just good   High light evening Bruschetta  <EOR> I hate honest because actors seem really genuine sweet !!!    The food good tasted food you'd actually eat wedding nothing special    wedding cake great !!   The show pretty bad    absolutely no plot actors just running around obnoxiously pretending drunk no purpose   It very over priced    Wine isn't included meal $30 3 glasses    also don't any water yourself bar      If you're already Ballys yourself favor next door see jersey boys  <EOR> Ah interactive dinner theater   Some say where actors die   Well Vegas      it holds true  almost died TNT 2 years   it almost devoured soul   But review isn't body work let's move shall we? Tony Tina's credit oldest piece interactive theater around still going strong   tickets tend little pricey $125 pop but local deals just check box office   food bit dull side but much want   Buffet style all way   On bright side   going big fat Italian wedding hang some really funny actors   ready dance then dance some more   But opera really play matter   Don't expect master piece Amadeus proportions but    do expect bride slapped priest drunk gay brother prance    and maybe if you're lucky someone Chicken Dance all over your face  <EOR> Initital Thought Ooohh interactive theater show!  dinner included!  tickets half off Tix 4 Tonight booth?!?
