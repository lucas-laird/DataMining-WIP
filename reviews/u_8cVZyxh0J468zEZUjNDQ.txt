The atmosphere decor vibe Its small quaint simple  come order your slice enjoy! high pace though because many people all trying pizza once  don't expect gradually order  Everyone pretty friendly course clean environment!  The Service girls all dressed cute Pin outfits! nice most part little abrupt but sense why  hot some customers very demanding small space huge ovens emitting bunch heat   The Food very many pizzas choose but everything delicious! sauce very unique pizza slices giant  truly wish stomach eat more slice delicious! little expensive but isn't expensive Vegas? Also no gluten free options Overall love pizza wish bigger space but good! always come back every time visit Vegas highly recommend any pizza lover stop try slice! <EOR> one slice depending toppping $5 6 00 but also 10% casino discount  huge slices  everything made fresh spot nothing dirty cheesy    massive slices pizza small price    saw review las vegas weekly but in  girls dressed pinup look  since when 1940s ? <EOR> Ate first time while visiting Vegas 2 3 pizzas ordered wrong  confronting them pizzas told knew ordered didn't   I regret even trying argue them pizza wasn't all that  Yeah pizza very generous size  But pizza itself isn't good  would probably more satisfied Papa John's Dominoes  <EOR> Awful food awful Servers dressed pin way all Literally nowhere sit eat <EOR> The pizza pretty good! huge line but didn't mind because pizza before! previously purchased whole box $45 guess changed since then now sold slice comes $75 time very uncomfortable because employees! girl glasses tattoos she extremely rude customers  if customer giving them attitude respond but girl cussing NO customer service skills  When turn waiting patiently hostile environment she arguing few customers before us she pointed said you? Even other employees looked uncomfortable because attitude  couldn't wait there  <EOR> Ah new kid Vegas pizza block  Thanks Yelp bookmarked Pin recent trip  missed evening while navigating Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile made mission find following day  still early when ordered Sandra D  combo slice knot soda which reasonable deal  expected pizza slices enormous  When ordering guy expected two orders questioned just but honestly come big @## slice can't consumed person sitting  mean yeah sure but all good stuff try Vegas made shareable snack before hitting other places  pizza decent though garlic knot pretty good its size  Service quick especially since able lunchtime rush  just little confused where eat food  pizza joint lot space but standing room only inside outside follow corridor leading directly PH sportsbook  <EOR> OK pizza's cheap lot your money unlike many other places Vegas   But come people!  No To Go boxes?  There's no seating you've leave store eat your slice stand bar eat hoping knocked around people ordering   cool     Zero people skills two employees either   assembly line efficient but part any dining experience service even if just throw your slice into oven hand you     I'll back when really hungry need something hurry doesn't cost lot feel eating standing up   plus side tasted good   Was hoping more though  <EOR> I didnt mind long line really excited try famous pizza  price alright 10 12 bucks any combo  Once pay problem  cashier gave attitude threw food counter just because asked box go  She said limit boxes don't eat casinos whatever im wtf know hell ima next trying pizza    she don't know if hitting road back home something  Anyways didn't stupid services just asking box throwing food that    soda didn't enough gas but pizza bomb garlic knot   They need change staff lil <EOR> We happened upon Pin Pizza last Monday night while roaming around strip   and having very late lunch liquid dinner   we thought maybe slice two pizza would hit spot   We walked super convenient location right next Planet Hollywood Hotel Casino when saw slices decided split between us   We ordered straight cheese slice wow   sooo tasty!!  best best NYC say pizza held its ground some better non NY slices around including super secret pizza place over Cosmopolitan they bonus video games though haha Wish would read some reviews ordered garlic knot but hey now we'll back again during next Vegas visit!  Overall I'd highly recommend establishment   Grab huge slice hang outside some people watching  <EOR> Bringing New York Las Vegas they're about  Huge thin crust pizza slices which exactly looking late drunk night    Ordered pepperoni thinly sliced meatball pizza slice  Came couple cents short $8  crust crispy crunchy good flavor  Definitely hits spot when want slice pizza  Service friendly super fast    The slice HUGE  Could probably share another person well since pretty damn full having entire slice   Would back? Definitely <EOR> Great location fast service! Pizza slices huge flavors decent  two entrances you're greeted friendly service even those late wee hours  <EOR> Decent pizza quality quantity  need eat pizza fork knife    find way finesse bite without pizza falling apart  They're huge but huge part massive crust  Pro tip season your pizza getting drunk during evening  helps pizza taste little better  margherita pizza best  coming someone likes pepperoni sausage   So why star? service   One morning before heading river girlfriend counter ask when would open  3 guys behind counter each facing glass heads down  girlfriend said excuse three times  once did anyone acknowledge her  standing 6 7 feet away could hear clearly   Another example poor service when back night river  stood line underneath order sign  guy making pizza doing own thing  Then another guy came work other orders  No said word  Other people began wonder where order  moment someone walked register began ordering even though other people including myself waiting order sign first  asked where should order finally said would next   The hours operation yelp also incorrect  believe close 10 PM July 2017  Anyway poor service seems common topic amongst customers  able experience myself  <EOR> It's really good only cheap meal around PH Earl Sandwich  Both good meals but somewhat normal priced  eat $10 12 per head beverage   To main knock nowhere sit down  typically walk around lot want nice seat when eat food then carry two plates room  aside great pizza place we'll back! <EOR> Pizza pretty good but wait long wasn't even during meal time really  price filling meal  Just wish could find way through line quicker  <EOR> Not bad great but decent pizza  always real easy look servers serving pizza huge slices fair prices sometimes line long but over all pretty decent  <EOR> Good late night snack but cashier bit rude elderly customer big turn off  <EOR> Wow  Great pizza!
