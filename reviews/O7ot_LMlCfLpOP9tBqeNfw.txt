Personally fan fried sushi but gave try! roll oddly sweet wasn't liking however  Crunchy outside but soft inside   Vegas roll Actually kinda same taste Gold rush? but minus sweet flavor  SERVICE The guy served ninja!

Despite prices didn't feel wasted money sushi since good quality  feel wasted money chasu ramen  know know no idea thinking either      defense suffering allergies thought soup would help  Honestly bought 0 35 cent ramen Walmart tasted better almost $9!!!! broth watery no richness would expect real ramen  possible  soup base came packet anyone could easily found Asian supermarket $2  noodles also overcooked mushy   please use warning skip ramen! Monta Ramen Sora Fukumimi if you've taste some delicious rameny goodness   say sushi place they've great quality look forward coming back exploring more section menu but no more ramen me! <EOR> Second time visiting Kabuki dinner think its last time place   myself sat bar watch baseball game   First bartender took least 8 10 minutes acknowledge me  He busy chatting two ladies seating bar  Second asked     any mayo anything cream but would sushi roll spicy tuna   He could recommend any sushi roll requirements   Anyway ended getting chicken teriyaki bento box   Nothing special   3 stars <EOR> I chicken teriyaki plate brown rice also came miso soup salad! bad $8 95  Environment real cozy staff nice! Also if order any rolls come salted edamame! <EOR> I've plenty times family  Today tops them all! Travis very proper took care very well  love take children difference restaurants rarely high level service given us  Especially crazy kiddos  He very informative menu  good see someone really knows serving  Thank taking care family especially sons special day! would give 10 if could! <EOR> Our server nice but food very good  all eat sushi places better quality food  Stay away lotus roll  prime location believe only reason why customers because its busiest part Town Square  <EOR> It's decent first time here  Sushi pretty good  many other options just sushi  Vegas roll lasagna tako  really didn't tako much but other 2 rolls really good  loved peach iced tea  Definitely should try one   The price pretty decent expensive even tho located inside town square  The service point when server constantly would check me  Seeing if ok not! place pretty fancy comes cute little lighted candles would romantic date   The only negative thing would hot stone grill bbq thing  $24 95 order keep mind gotta wait 20 30 mins hot stone thing ready thought would big order but turn only 10 pieces meat there  no flavor either  Which disappointment me  If love grill BBQ might well ayce kbbq instead ordering this  Bc w 24 95 could afford whole new ayce  Other everything good far  back  <EOR> Get sushi sashimi   Forget rest   Solid offering all fronts killer yellowtail just buttery perfect   Very interesting tasty twist spicy scallop handroll my favorite nice little sesame vibe no mayo perfect level spice tingle lips without full tears    Salmon skin roll albacore both good unagi surprisingly awesome right off broiler none cold mushy stuff give sometimes    Spicy tuna wasn't spicy enough but still good fish   Sushi chefs great yellowtail chef's personal favorite while ordinarily something eat stuff YUM   Finished off tempura red bean ice cream good but think red bean mochi better   But still nice ending   Lemon drop cocktail good well  Only surprise?  No sunomono menu boooo   But if am ever Vegas again which doubt am fan just business definitely back   PS Northwesterners prepared exorbitant prices   SoCal sushi massively overpriced don't surprised if dinner two $100+  <EOR> Love Yelp check offer free California roll!  Alaskan roll super yummy lunch specials filling priced just right! <EOR> Not sure happened place last few months but certainly fallen off  food always delicious but service cleanliness taken dive     Management accommodating all  fact manager downright rude condescending  hostesses trip over each other don't acknowledge customers when walk act if annoyed working there    The women's restroom looked hadn't serviced hours  Toilet paper floor wet tiles reeked urine!   After two bad experiences month alone doubtful we'll going back any time soon  shame     place used favorites  <EOR> Pretty little place tucked into mall just off strip  hungering something wasn't buffet place nice find  started some hot sake which littler Large size would lead think  Sushi tastier sukiyaki ramen got  Well seasoned sushi rice fish decently fresh  sushi eel avocado roll omakase deluxe sushi set then shrimp tempura roll  Shrimp tempura roll little meh but other stuff oishiiiii  <EOR> Came lunch yesterday ate sushi bar  slow restaurant  Service ok sushi chefs really talkative customers  ordered lunch sushi special came 6 spicy tuna rolls four five mixed sushi rice  felt special added value since came salad  sushi fresh spicy tuna ok did much flavor  would definitely come back lunch try dinner menu  <EOR> Sunday night date night !!!!

Well atmosphere service prices say exactly  Prices over inflated considering food best there  better hole in a wall sushi places! Service rude often made inappropriate comments over certain food orders like unique oyster shooter   Service also slow helpful any means  end day overcharged credit card bill dispute charges credit card since managers servers helpful   Atmosphere trendy liking  I don't sushi place feel club thing  want enjoy food eat peace relatively timely service  didn't peace here  Oh no  hard peace quiet when techno music booming all around tables close together hear everything being said your neighboring diners despite annoying loud techno trance! Decor very loud well but good sense  hodge podge ridiculously looking booths pictures better club environment sushi place    This place scored 0 ethnicity since nothing ethnic Japanese it  Even food although good largely Americanized  no Ikura large caviar even offered! Seaweed salad good ask waiter twice miso soup even know if served was   I would recommend place  Town Square experience but would countless other restaurants before Kabuki again  <EOR> Happy hour fried calamari dynamite roll shrimp tempura Didn't  sesame chicken light cool drink     Ozeki Nigori must  !!!! <EOR> Awesome lunch spot! They've great special nigiri spicy tuna roll salad edamame 13 dollars  place packed all time but if seated bar gets bit better  menu lot options maybe many? But still solid fish  cut nicely  No AYCE tho  <EOR> This worst service well since Seafood Harbor Palace Spring Mountain  service horrible inclined write review mid dining! Seriously take 5 10 minutes review place same length time took server acknowledge then handle 3 other tables closing checks then finally arrive back table take order  No apologies   stickler   service anywhere should come manners   And first alerted wanting review place  hostess first person encountered lack mannerism comes service  think pains smile  poor woman could even muster grin courteous welcome even apology wait   The scene something We walk abandoned front counter wait 2 minutes  Grimace  we'll call shows herself acknowledges many? no greeting no smile   Then she walks away sit previous guest  She then returns asks again Did say 4? no thank wait did mention NO SMILE? Then finally Grimace sits us  Oh yeah less 10 word vocabulary she doesn't bother realize required kids' menus  Weird   In short poor customer service here  dine again  single star food   it okay just okay  definitely find better Japanese cuisine elsewhere  People don't belong customer service should working kind establishment  far more people earth willing work busy money making New Year's Eve better attitude  If management can't figure then oh well down paying patron  Sayonara  <EOR> An awesome Vegas find off strip expensive other places there  really enjoyed Tuna Poke spice salmon roll  extensive menu lots yummy options  If back Vegas definitely back there  <EOR> This place does very busy call ahead reservation   don't 5 stars because terriyaki chicken steak really isnt great plus dont fried rice just plain white rice   great service  serve edamame cold just add some salt better  date rainbow roll which he swears best he's ever had   also ate Tempe location last year sushi great! <EOR> Food excellent services also excellent  But place dirty booths filthy seats all torn  It's run kids way  <EOR> Wow! free cal roll edamame!!! Just checked though yelp  great surprise   Great deal   Love it!!! Spicy tofu good presentation enjoyed    Ramen standard nothing special  <EOR> Was going Town Square last night see new LCD Soundsystem documentary one word review inside review AMAZING huge fan Town Square dining options    Kabuki disappointed past seemed generic plates food synonymous chain restaurants    perfect time possibly experience 2 star meal could further expand rating distributions which lean towards 3 5 star reviews   PERFECT   We started trying Sake Sangria we'd recommended friend knows much Bachi Burger Sake Sangria    brought giant carafe lot fruit mixed throughout   far good    Tastewise?  even close Bachi Burger's version blows water    strong flavor within didn't sit well it   first thought possibly overpowered sake but dining companion suggested thought lemon peel    going lean towards being origin flavor because polishing off gigantic monstrosity carafe neither buzz    deal $24!  Strike but plus side 2 star review already writing itself!  Things took turn when food started arriving surprisingly enough me    First garlic sea salt edamame    bit overpriced $5 thought but amount provided well deliciousness made worth it   edamame perfectly cooked sea salt garlic mixed throughout extremely tasty   also brought extra bowl regular edamame which said house    Appreciated but little weird considering we'd ordered giant plate other edamame    None regular ones eaten unfortunately     Next Niku Kushiyaki appetizer skewer beef shishito peppers   thought meat tad overcooked but flavors nice particularly when combined shishito whatever sauce plate them    good choice $6   Yellowtail Carpaccio standard order sushi restaurant didn't impress but wasn't necessarily bad either   companion ordered king crab miso soup which tried bit greatly enjoyed   crab plentiful throughout thought nice flavor melded nicely standard miso   Lastly Sushi Omakase Special which assortment nigiri California Roll bowl regular miso soup    quite impressed majority nigiri    Most fish tasted fresh prepared well california roll was    well california roll but good version nonetheless   only two downsides plate Krab nigiri which tasted cheap imitation eel which usually favorite bite plate Omakase but didn't taste tender used which think sign might fresh    All other bites great though cleaned plate   So little indifferent feel   hand now still only handful 1 2 star reviews but other hand really nice meal!   It'd 4 star review if Sake Sangria wasn't disappointing also if hadnt mediocre meals past  <EOR> This favorite places when Vegas  salmon teriyaki delicious cooked perfection each time  sushi great  If Vegas want change $35 40 plate restaurants big casinos head Town Square hit Kabuki  <EOR> No no no    This supermarket quality sushi  Most people eating rolls perhaps knew better  fish mediocre quality questionable its freshness  no reason settle when many better sushi restaurants all over town  <EOR> While food always good become exhausted lack service attention receive there   money should good anyone else's   take give attitude getting old   plenty tables but hinted should sit bar because empty   Bachi Burger wouldn't let sit bar unless ordered alcohol   While both P!aces good food good wait seated half hour when aren't lot people there   am thankful lady front counter high horse today   Managements lackluster attitude customer service sent Sawa Sushi West Blue Diamond Road   mom pop unlike chains could cafe less   Bye Kabuki forever!  wouldn't eat ever again if free  <EOR> The most amazing squid cooked perfection   Wow place delicious Japanese food  Edamame sea salt chicken teriyaki awesome   Sushi rice also perfect   Great place cool ambience  <EOR> Place did satisfy  Food does come described menu when ask your server bartender don't see certain item proceed pick fight then tell saying don't want your roll any longer going take off time but just want let know theres nothing wrong it  sure think <EOR> This review lunch wife Friday afternoon  pleasantly surprised nice experience was  always walked never stopped in  think solid option Japanese if you're Town Square   We came just 12 seated immediately  Both restaurant bar busy but wasn't loud crazy hectic  Bernard server he did good job despite running 5 other tables beside during hour    Their menu extensive lunch combos toward back  also order edamame snack before your meal  omakase deluxe combo 5 nigiri 6 pieces spicy tuna roll $13 95 Vegas roll deep fried salmon crab cream cheese avocado $10 95   wife Kabuki deluxe chicken teriyaki bbq beef ribs shrimp vegetable tempura 3 pcs California roll $13 95   plenty food both us  no issues sushi especially liked beef ribs nice barbecued flavor tender   I would come back try more Japanese fare would come back happy hour movie before headed bars little food warm engine  <EOR> Quick easy pretty good sushi Las Vegas if you're shopping nearby   destination location?

The only con would say happy hour drink menu all three times order drinks off menu made them sweet prepared wrong one  Servers don't seem very familiarized drinks restaurant could something should work on    I love happy hour only great deal stuffed amount get  However wouldn't eat if happy hour isn't going on  Everything else menu otherwise overly priced being sushi bar strip  <EOR> DELICIOUS   A short drive away strip but way way worth it! Here's had 1  Deep fried calamari eel sauce  Perfectly crunchy chewy  perfect start good meal  2  Spicy ramen  broth really tasty  eaten many ramen joints but broth actually quite spectacular savory complex  wasn't desired spiciness level but waitress left bottle ground chili bring liking  thoroughly enjoyed but definitely wished piece char siu some kind meat  3  Sunkissed roll  Spicy tuna roll salmon avocado top  favorite dish meal  am huge fan sashimi fresh fish  spicy tuna okay but made happy brought joy huge piece fresh tasty raw salmon atop roll  Certainly some freshest salmon tasted   I happy meal especially having deprived good sushi half year  total ramen roll $22  Definitely steal compared those other pricey places strip  <EOR> Very good food  Wish atmosphere wait staff more authentic but food?

Thanks! <EOR> Kabuki offers sushi haven't able find anywhere else town NYC elusive Baja roll  essentially spicy California roll topped crab salsa drizzled yum yum sauce  Sounds little weird know but most unique blend cuisine Japanese southwest    Now general service usually crap  takes forever anything mainly check  many times when felt tempted walk because ridiculous even server's attention  did such thing but if left unattended such could cause problems all know hurts restaurant   Now reason put four stars because other day friend BEST service  believe server's name Robert but forgive am mistaken because he made night! Super attentive funny game  Kabuki want wait staff model    As sushi chefs past sat sushi bar jolly bunch know skills   Arigato gozimasu  <EOR> Awesome food staff   family going Kabuki years almost weekly basis   think food high quality won't anywhere else sushi   manager Tom awesome always making sure food right become family   can't without saying servers Travis Tim Drew Diane and  Angie Ok all staff made place feel home but without mess washing dishes LOL!!!  favorite getting Hamachi salmon sashimi thin sliced  NEVER tired place  <EOR> Love service happy hour menu!!!! sushi absolutely delish  <EOR> I really love restaurant! requested bar area seated right away service fast polite  The food world!

Overall 3 5 5 I don't know managed coordinate chicken beef raw fish fried crab dry day came but consider impressed  rest food okay while service lunch special prices redeem place  don't think place bad just think better when paying full price  <EOR> Come 2 30 deserted  Thou waiter nice  Food still pretty fresh  Good eat  <EOR> Kabuki good restaurant area  usually place end spur moment way movies taking break shopping  really enjoy poke tuna lotus fire roll sashimi always really good well! <EOR> Kabuki decent food  Nothing worth driving across city but area going movies member Red Mask club $15 credit birthday dinner tonight  Nothing exceptional except speed sushi chefs  seated sushi bar because told wait tables even though several open same area sushi bar guess claimed already   took exceptionally long time server come back delivering drinks dinner partner could order off menu instead directly sushi chefs meantime two rolls already sitting front me  nice sushi ready fast but still waited dinner partner food sat untouched quite some time  food good I'd come again but overall service slow seemed uncoordinated   Eventually finished all food drink flag down waiter ask check even though he just run neighbors' check  Seemed somewhat inexperienced but weren't hurry still left decent tip  OK food if you're area but nothing special  <EOR> Great location! Nice interior exterior decorations  Reverse Happy Hour   That pretty much covers major highlights Kabuki Japanese restaurant  food served okay good price average service prompt pleasant   even weekday lunches place still pretty busy the restaurant roughly 50% tables occupied   fact located conveniently near Rave Motion Pictures plethora shopping other restaurants bars undoubtedly contributed ongoing success national restaurant outpost   If vicinity Town Square mood some Japanese food before resuming your hunt perfect little black dress movie start would totally recommend Kabuki   Especially 3 6pm Monday Friday their regular happy hour lunch hour 11am 4pm daily    Kabuki also great place grab bite before spending rest evening getting your beer goggles on   reverse HH 9pm until close Monday Thursday 8pm until close Sundays Kabuki happy place start evening   The B B Q  Beef Ribs Kalbi excellent here  Even though portion particularly generous flavor grilled perfectly that  Many sauces accompanies appetizers entrees tasty compliments overall dish   only item would avoid tempura looks overfried greasy side   Location 5 5 Love it!  If regularly hang southern portion Las Vegas convenient location you   far Mandalay Bay if visiting Las Vegas end Strip far travel via cab   Service 4 5  Prompt service friendly staff   Ambiance 4 5  bar area looks nice rest restaurant coherent theme design decor   Price 3 5  Average non AYCE Japanese restaurants   Food 3 5 5  Tasty but otherwise average Japanese restaurants  <EOR> I've Kabuki several times but time wasn't amazed food  sushi bland wasn't anything extraordinary it  best cook but if attempt sushi would taste result wouldn't good  tasted rushed making food forgot taste good  However Server David did great job checking table see if needed anything  Thank David!  <EOR> I really disappointed Kabuki appetizer dishes rolls thought would only found hair rolls!
