Yum! <EOR> Came dinner recently you'll find your basic Hawaiian dishes   Kauai Cafe located off Tropicana Hualapai the Westside    Upon reviewing menu thing noticed prices   Price isn't bad   Dinner two set back only $20 which bad opinion   selection decent pretty much you'll find other Hawaiian location   However issue Hawaiian food there's ton them favorites already   let's review    As food Loco Moco since favorite dishes  Plus wanted something huge protein count   case you're know Loco Moco consist rice hamburger eggs gravy   KC mixes gravy mushrooms which good touch different   Seems boring but word order   delicious   order filled but wasn't done  always Spam Masubi Katsu Masubi least once when hit new Hawaiian joint   KC didn't Katsu Masubi regular spam is   little disappointed KC's spam masubi only because small tightly wrapped spam bit undercooked     The restaurant small cozy staff extremely nice   owner's dad even stopped table chit chat little bit   Okay lot bit  But he's cool just added dining experience     I want say Kauai Cafe just okay but really haven't tried anything else   still Kalbi try even though stole bite TR Katsu Heineken battered chicken Ahi Ahi can't remember if one    minimal amount reviews far Kahlua Pork known for   going tough judge since don't eat much pork   still way back try other dishes missed   knows?
