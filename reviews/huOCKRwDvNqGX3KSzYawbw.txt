A Gelato  Specifically gelato place  Even more specifically tiramisu gelato place while watch Bellagio fountain show  <EOR> Awesome pistachio dulce de leche  Customer service could improve prices outrageous  <EOR> The gelato really ok  creamy rich but flavor wise really ok  personally think gelato Jean Philippe Patisserie which also located inside Bellagio better  am always search good gelato ice cream give place try    I've gelato served paper cups plastic cups  also serve theirs plastic cup but very sturdy one  also nice location they're located inside across entrance outdoor pool  great way gelato flock coming  <EOR> You can't wrong Cafe Gelato   Fabulous flavors taste then mouth watering perfection cone all you   cheap for gelato but they're skimpy   Good luck finishing but worth try   Perfect those hot days shopping   Sit Cafe itself nearby comfy sofas main hallway  <EOR> I absolutely loved cafe inside Bellagio! offer many different gelato flavors sample many like! espresso great well   They lunch options everything displayed cases  Service quick  great casual cafe lunch dessert  <EOR> Horrible experience! Hubby right before closing Monday November 9th  2 ladies Lourdes sure name other lady behind counter looked disgusted being there  Neither friendly nor welcoming both lacking customer service skills  experience only disappointment while staying Bellagio  As far gelato seemed lacking flavor  tiramisu ok also chocolate cookie which HARD!  I Don't recommend! <EOR> Are KIDDING right now??? place hidden gem someone still trying stay somewhat healthy while visiting Las Vegas    Kinda tucked away down those long hallways Bellagio you'll find gates heaven aka Cafe Gelato   They've great selection pre made sandwiches ridiculously good desserts pastries making mouth water just THINKING them course shit ton gelato   What wouldn't think look SMOOTHIE selection  sugary milkshakes Jamba crap  talking all fruit veggie smoothies  place Vegas actually some spinach!   When stayed Caesars couple weeks ago walked Bellagio just fav green smoothie Fruit Veggie Smoothie   Seriously come here  prices okay you're actually getting think real food    All pre made sandwiches checked seem cheese them literally only complaint   Plenty seating  <EOR> Gelato gives taste Europe! conveniently open late serves more gelato think croissants wraps quiches such coffee other desserts drinks  pricey but LV! <EOR> This place very good gelato but bad service  asked banana split yet server gave sundae instead she looked really mad even though fault  did flavors wanted but want better service  She even gave dirty look if going place sure server acts happy before ordering  coming back someday  <EOR> We stayed Bellagio recently but did discover fantastic place until last night  word YUM!  relax  cool off enjoy treats   Well done! <EOR> Not bad but definitely favorite gelato  However favorite gelato actually Vegas   They give pretty good portion size price  hoping few more flavor choices perhaps few more unique flavors   Overall good place grab something quick show before returning your room especially since open late  <EOR> Yummy gelato!!! Banana Toffee Crunch Chocolate Amaretto  Friendly service  Located quieter part Bellagio  also sandwiches various pastries purchase  We'll back  <EOR> Located near arcade pool Belagio   Great selection flavors   only chance try Oreo Snickers   love place perfect place snacks  sandwich gelato same time  <EOR> I am amazed few people actually know place   actually kinda hesitant write because I'd keep little secret but gotta give props reason   The first time came kid I'm guessing some time 2000 so   I don't remember because there's arcade next door   dulce de leche waffle cone pretty much fell love place   since day vowed myself every time came Vegas more 24 hours I'd come some delicious gelato   Spring summer fall winter didn't matter   yes tradition continues day!  As gelato itself just great value   $6 49 scoop which reality TWO scoops waffle cone   town where rarely find good value money GREAT value money here   Personal favorites dulce de leche obviously blueberry cheesecake Oreo stracciatella   If you're looking spot right next pool   Just down hallway  next buffet you'll find it  <EOR> So FLAVORFUL!  Pistachio Gelato 5+ Chocolate 5 Mint Chocolate 5 Cappuccino 5  Nice setting sit people always around  <EOR> Dulce de Leche Croissant literally weighed half pound seemed cup caramel inside  Good value but can't eat much straight caramel! Breakfast panini meh cappuccino chocolate gelato great  <EOR> This favorite place Las Vegas MUST come every time visit Vegas   love tiramisu   little plastic box   traditional tiramisu looks cake   Check photos   really creamy layers creams wine   super good try it   Two other things order place breakfast croissant egg cheese ham   eggs just taste different mean way cook just really yummy!  daily soup also really delicious     I only tried ice cream once   Since big fan ice cream can't tell if really good not     If haven't try place yet please try it!!!   The price moderate when order three things above costs less $20  <EOR> We double gelato three flavors strawberry chocolate mixed berry   strawberry tasted artificial but chocolate mixed berry very good   $6 75 plus tax which seems bargain Vegas!    We also large soda which $4 00 plus tax but included free refills all day     The location nice quiet girls behind counter nice   only complaint other adult customers seem think appropriate wear skimpy drippping wet bathing suits places other pool but hardly hold Cafe Gelato responsible! <EOR> Update No more crab shrimp seafood wrap sandwiches 4 2011  No explanation why awesome value missed  <EOR> This cafe located quiet little hallway near Bellagio pool art gallery  seen place before while heading towards art gallery but never stopped check out  Finally Christmas Day while trying escape crowds casino floor remembered place existed decided finally time check out  Although line definitely much quieter emptier casino!   Besides carrying couple dozen flavors gelato also coffee soft drinks sandwiches quiches pastries other baked goodies  Because already eaten lunch decided just 2 scoops gelato mango blackberry cheesecake which ran 5 bucks  gelato good full flavor especially mango one  tasted real mango! self service ice water condiment station stocked small jars jams honey   Cafe Gelato nice quiet way escape hustle noise casino floor  look forward coming back next time Bellagio  just wished separate lines food ordering gelato only because line gets jammed when person front standing trying order sandwiches stuck behind them hoping would finish  Since gelato case located closer register figure wouldn't wait line just look order gelato <EOR> Always always always delicious  Great Italian gelato made cream  little pricey don't seem set opening time  <EOR> In need something sweet cold stumbled upon Café Gelato Bellagio located across main entrance hotel's pool  café offers both gelato traditional ice cream man ice cream good! tasting few ice cream flavors ordered Snickers ice cream single scoop waffle cone which totaled $6 75 but big enough feed both husband myself  couldn't help but indulge next night order another waffle cone time Oreo's ice cream  yummy! Café also offers panini's free Swiss jams honey side great souvenirs! addition in café seating hallway seating a great place people watch!    Go Café Gelato if love ice cream gelato! want warm sandwich want truly Italian experience people watching under façade ice cream consumption   Don't Café Gelato if budget no wiggle room because just pure pleasing gluttony! Otherwise hand over $7 waffle cone! <EOR> Had berry sherbet  It almost tasted real gelato  I know gelato Germany Italy  Cute place fancy colors all around  It's Bellagio! Chihuly Bellagio didn't looked same seeing Seattle  <EOR> Love place! coffee drinks bomb  breakfast awesome! Oh    gelato yummy! <EOR> It's gelato  wrong gelato  Most gelato tastes just same  only difference would flavors sometimes texture although theyre generally soft All flavors tried = good  standing towards side whole array flavors where see its reflection through mirror  Why? Because look serve 2x flavors  Don't fooled    Don't waste your money those yummy looking cones unless absolutely want one  gelato enough cones mediocre  white chocolate just typical worth extra cost  also tried peanut butter lollipop  Unless wanna eat extra sweet snickers ice cream bar lollipop no need try it    WARNING If come summer eat your gelato outside  brought gelato outside check pool melted IMMEDIATELY  Sadness  back into Cafe Gelato ask cup could dump cone gelato into it   otherwise I'd start licking gelato off hands grotesque  <EOR> Best Gelato Town!

A true gem madness Las Vegas  <EOR> My friend visiting Vegas buy 1 1 free scoop gelato here  stopped around 10pm night waited line  two staff members working girl guy  girl helping two girls front when guy called up  immediately asked sample cheesecake big mistake  guy seemed irritated I'd dare ask sample  No sooner did he hand sample spoon he begins chatting girls front us    My friend exchanged glances  waited moment then asked if she knew she getting  guy continued ignore us  finally said scoop snickers unsurprisingly promptly ignored  said second time louder  Without making eye contact guy continued talk women front scooped gelato placed cup counter  asked friend if she wanted order since he still ignoring said And scoop oreo  Again guy wouldn't even look he served scoop focusing solely women front us    He eventually able pull himself away long enough ring up  told reward he seemed offended didn't want pay full price  ended tipping nothing he seemed pretty unhappy making passive aggressive comments left    To top all off gelato ice crystals it    Overall I'd give gelato 2 5 stars service zero  expected better Bellagio quality service  <EOR> This review gelato only  Ignore rude impatience barista  Gelato good  Especially pistachio cappuccino ones  Nice place little break shopping  <EOR> Gelato good   However service terrible   Served Lourdes she horrible attitude  <EOR> Dropped notch compared gelato 5 years ago   told everyone visiting Vegas all agreed best  Recent visit no longer best crazy expensive now but still definitely  very good! <EOR> Conveniently located cafe right next Bellagio casino  randomly passed cafe walking casino drawn colorful gelato display near door  space well lit clean large keeping golden classical era theme Bellagio hotel    The gelato quite good  12 15 different flavors prices very reasonable $4 75 single which actually two scoops gelato $6 75 double which actually three scoops   tried single scoop Baileys scoop nocciola  nocciola delicious strong hazelnut flavor deliciously creamy gelato  didn't Baileys much which overpowering flavor Baileys took away enjoyment gelato    There some large tables sit hang complimentary iced water far end which appreciated while recovered casino experience  <EOR> Das Café liegt ein wenig abseits fast schon ein bisschen versteckt nahe den Gästeaufzügen und dem Zugang zum Poolbereich im Bellagio Hotel Casino  Das Angebot des Cafés geht von Frühstück über Desert bis zu kleinen Gerichten für zwischendurch mein persönlicher Favorit ist jedoch das Speiseeis  Eine Vielzahl von Variationen stehen zur Auswahl wer möchte und unschlüssig ist kann gerne nach einer kleinen Geschmacksprobe fragen  Wer nicht ganz puristisch veranlagt ist wie ich kann sein Eis auch noch mit reichlich Beilagen aufwerten hier gibt es von bunten Streuseln über Obst bis zur heißen Schokoladensoße ebenfalls reichlich Auswahl  Das Eis selbst hat geschmacklich einen erfreulich geringen Zuckeranteil und die Geschmacksrichtungen sind auch nicht wirr wie bei Ben Jerry zumindest für mich ein positiver Punkt ist  Hat man sich entschieden kann man seine süße Belohnung dann gleich vor Ort im Café oder vor der Tür gemütlichen Sesseln genießen und dem Treiben im Hotel zusehen  <EOR> It's expensive fattening prob should going here    But good! Right now favorite flavor banana toffee  But really doesn't matter which choose because all good  sit hallway check view pool area    nice way enjoy little time friend  <EOR> It's amazing! ran across strip fighting all water show watchers before closed  Worth run!
