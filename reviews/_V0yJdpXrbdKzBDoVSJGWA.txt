Thank 4 your attentions!!! Now Lucky Lady <EOR> I am rating Silver Sevens Casino under four different categories As hotel lowly 2 Stars As restaurant 4 Stars As bar also nice 5 Stars And Casino 3 Stars  First checked into hotel late  long road trip wanted restroom before heading back some dinner  toilet bolted down properly moved if sat bumped into it  bathroom looked clean but very low budget  tile poorly installed but oh well we're drink eat gamble no particular order  wash hands faucet also bolted down correctly  bedroom sink area nicer must say beds very comfortable  might gotten 3 if elevator took 5 6 minutes down floor  Every time elevator knew may rescued soon  guy bumped into inside elevator said he comes every two weeks half time service    We did leave room Sterling Spoon Cafe  expecting old favorites which were rack ribs NY steak Sirloin $9 99 but gone $14  did very good breakfast midnight specials which love Vegas  food very good Sterling Spoon couple more meals  buffet did look appetizing stayed SS   I wanted catch ALCS NLCS [go Royals since Dodgers done] played while small bar NW side property  couple great bar tenders fast courteous knew pour drink  Met some great people all parts world  Happy Birthday Mike Sweden great talk Joe Costa Rica  best part day even won little machines [before lose back somewhere else]   The casino kind slow  Tuesday but made way over craps table quiet  Some guy losing shirt recognized some stayed away  Played little slots but slots guy  want craps table BlackJack table  Tuesday again but no action no real enticement jump onto table   Overall Silver Sevens since Terribles  lot more often Buffalo Bills Whiskey Pete's Primm points help rooms and or specials  Now Terribles gone l seem doing little better  Its still great value  <EOR> Stayed while Vegas work trip  My 4th trip Vegas 1st time staying off strip Since several big things going area price room $180 night stayed 4 nights  shouldn't complain since work paid BUT     First night 9pm  every other comment smoke smell horrific  two different check lines frequent flyers Other line Random Joes me  Both lines 3 people frequent flyers helped first which fine  Shannon lady behind counter she super nice helpful making long wait irritation away   She pointed down hall way elevator 3rd floor room 3049  elevator labeled blends all other room doors making hard find room which suppose King bed two queens but ok me  Room nice basic wear tear older hotel cracks walls tile stains floor something gross smeared all over bottom bathroom wall wifi free but very spotty  Shower head super low hardly any pressure but shower shower   Next day use rooms blow dryer clicked turned really red hot started smoking black smoke  hurried unplugged it  Called down front desk lady answered super nice said she would someone shortly replace it  waited waited until no choice but work event  Came back room same dryer called down front desk requested switched before morning insured would switched felt relieved  Lyft Uber but better Strip  Next morning woke same blow dryer  Being handy lady unplugged un mounted dryer took down front desk myself where older gentleman listened safety fire concerns insisted take dryer back room someone shortly switch blower dryer out  day before nobody came  Next day still changed matters worse 2nd day requested room serviced  Cleaning lady took all dirty towels didn't leave any new ones which realized till shower she left all dirty dishes night fore's rooms service oh but don't worry she made bed  point husband over it  usually leave reviews anything less then 3 star because believe am patient understand things forgotten towels  But Putting safety concerns back burner OK  therefor am leaving review its only getting 2 0 because nice some staff Shannon easy convenient gift shop even though wished open later   ** really hope fixed blow dryer room 3049 before someone gets hurt** <EOR> I stayed hotel felt very saddened poor choice accommodations  Upon entering room foul wet odor coming air conditioner  looked floor next huge wet stain someone spilled something left soak heat cause foul odor   putting down bags entered bathroom live roach trying flip over since he stuck back  grabbed 3 squares tissues tried flush roach down toilet but toilet clogged  fact clogged 4 5 times 3 day stay there  ended buying plunger since didn't want call front desk unclog toilet every time someone peed  mention tip person unclogged toilet every time  think hotel needs work plumbing pests  understand its summer water bugs might start creep huge roach  Also concert no ironing board iron room tv would randomly darker longer tv wasn't able stay room  <EOR> We wanted budget friendly place stay Southeast end strip  place fit bill perfectly  always stay different places Vegas depending am doing location am with  admit worried staying considering very inexpensive price  However would say overall exactly would expect price point enjoyed stay here  First all staff very friendly way take care you  greeted Esperanza front desk she wonderful! She even remembered would wave say hi every time walked desk way out  security staff housekeeping also great   Pros very budget friendly great location strip large updated rooms smaller casino everything easily accessible ample FREE parking large well kept beautiful unheated pool area hot tub great staff free coffee coupons  Cons paper thin windows made lots outside noise stained towels I never ate can't comment that  did notice some great deals food though  Overall see pros far outweigh cons  would definitely stay again if worked needed trip  <EOR> Stayed 3 day weekend  happy booked advance because place seems popular choice    Affordable prices  $82 2 nights+$100 deposit read fine print folks   it's    My customer service experience check nice  guy fast friendly gave good directions  Even complimented husbands fine beard! Clean room Non smoking premium 2 Queen Comfortable bedding bed pillows oh my gosh  Ample parking  Within walking distance Strip which wouldn't recommend doing if you're wearing heels ah lesson learned   Elevator squeaky scary   no lie  Flickering lights all    We 4 people room definitely space friendly  Wish bathroom slightly bigger but more accommodating  However shower head very low water pressure sucked! specifically loved many tables room all junk  Plus nice wall mirror assist getting ready night out!   Aside pretty view would definitely stay again!
