Super clean great drinks management really caters customer  Give place try Friday  <EOR> I dont even know where start service bad bartender ddnt even know beer selection food  switch glass plastic just because event but allowed bottled beer contradiction right? owner tried giving some nonsense it  wonder why little business  start let bartender known wanted splt checks amongst three us  Then took 15 mins split checks  specifly asked owner glass beer denied then gave plastic  seems most employees incompetent simple tasks <EOR> Stick burgers! chicken picatta needed more sauce tasted OK but pre made little dry  pasta pretty hot reminded blazing hot pasta Olive garden  assume nuked  Bummer because chef  said recipe  Paymon's much better  Stay away chicken satay! Tasted really weird wasn't chicken  Dark meat strange texture  If again stick burger gigantic onion rings  <EOR> So over Mall purchase glasses stumble upon sports bar  NCAA when walked nice Projector big screen several new TVs decided drink appetizer  Liz very nice order chicken skewers Beer nice selection   Liz arrives over 10 minutes later inform chicken spoiled didn't know why kitchen didn't tell sooner  order hamburger hoping its safe choice 5 mins later am given Calamari laughed saying its mine  10 mins mediocre best burger w overcooked fries  favorite part half a**sed DJ booth 10 feet no hardly present place starts blowing thick smoke 80s Prince MJ video joke! All while Liz friendly apologetic  Icing cake bill settle overcharged $4 skimming mistake? saw later week  nice enough call patient said would taken care of  Today told capabilities refund huh?? Georgio informed come back taken care ehhhh good  Peace! <EOR> I stopped Hatari bite eat before flight Vegas am glad did  Very friendly attentive staff good food drinks  Good music but loud  Really great sports bar! Thank Hatari  <EOR> It's advertised sports bar and plenty screens but atmosphere more nightclub ear splitting music female staff mini dresses  credit bartenders extremely friendly even doing some flip tricks   The menu good variety classic burgers wings Spicy Moroccan flavor something different pizzas entrees  appreciate healthy options available veggie burgers roasted salmon dish few salads  veggie burger recommended staff fairly good able sub side vegetables fries without upcharge  There's interesting variety beers draft including Woodchuck amber Four Peaks Peach ale well HH specials     There's video DJ 7PM loud difficulty placing order let alone carrying conversation  seems they're trying people coming two very different things  area several times week come back try more menu but sure early avoid noise   NOTE doesn't seem way enter mall easily visible street  located right behind parking garage front side mall right main entrance  <EOR> I say hands down place best pizza town  all sport your heart wants new hang spot ! <EOR> Melody Christian Julio Liz Chef Brian AWESOME staff!! BEST TIME staff EVER!!!!  GREAT food AWESOME company!!!  New favorite spot     BOULEVARD MALL BACK LIFE SPORTS BAR incorporated Boulevard Mall <EOR> I live neighborhood really wanted place great  much bad experience back second bad experience then third  Well    three strikes out    On positive note food fine  stellar but fine  kids under 10 eat free which nice  menu states burgers 10 ounces which can't possibly true  Maybe 6 7? 10  Fries served sparingly also  menu selection ok dinner but pretty heavy lunch  Aside few salads all burgers big entrees  Offering some good sandwiches would long way   The main problem service  Three visits 3 different servers all terrible  There's never any more 2 3 other patrons restaurant when service unbelievably slow each time  10 minutes waters another 10 drinks place orders 10 minutes bring blue cheese wings while just sat getting cold  soda refilled pitcher flat soda mostly melted ice  Even jam packed night things shouldn't happen   Servers very little knowledge menu  There's  no beer list no tell are  server no idea if filet sliders ground beef actual filet  always something need ask someone else order answer question   Lastly check process happens tablets which fine except all three times problems being able pay via credit card instead cash managers assistance and another 10 minutes required   You pay billboards advertise all UNLV games want but if can't provide decent service you're never going people come back  <EOR> Great experience!  Came some friends some good food drinks disappointed! never don't think anyone ever either  hostess super friendly accommodating waiter great attentive well!  They played soccer game TV closet request gave some time look over specialty cocktail menu  opted first drink Menu which Hatari Special believe blue drink topped fruit lit fire your table However mine lit fire some accidents past  I ordered classic burger melted provolone cheese sauce everything   Literally everything   Simply delicious!  I definitely regular! <EOR> Nice place great decor awesome music food point   Drinks really reasonable here  waiter nice attentive plus manager came over checked us   food spicy but really good  <EOR> Great food ! Amazing service! burgers great ! chicken tenders cooked perfection  can't wait back try more items menu  ! Pizza amazing ! Drinks just keeping coming back ! <EOR> Great place hang friends found place JB Dance Studio Blvd mall best place ever  Staff fun friendly attractive social more ask besides great quality food  <EOR> I stopped place because originally Olivia's but Olivia's going through renovation  guy outside gave two coupons free meals decided try place out!  Cleanliness place immaculately clean  But slow Friday 2pm     Service mentioned before but staff really needs trained serving  don't seem know they're selling! asked recommendation server responded everything good! obvious attempt hide fact she knew nothing menu    Decor place very weird vibe  brand new but somehow feels dated? When enter place feels just entered nightclub 2007 music little loud    The reason why place gets star because absolutely terribly uninformed staff is  guy waking around looks male version Kruella Deville obviously manager perhaps owner came table asked meal going    He asked drink drinking  know SIGNATURE COCKTAILS serve  ordered Hatari Azul  supposed cherry blueberries came neither  top all off PURE SUGAR  awful!    This place would good if knowledgeable staff    The food alright  overpriced Applebee's without quality Applebee's    <EOR> It's sports bar doing sports bars do! Probably assisted relationship Olivia's which next door and despite bad experience must admit incredible food drinks service place great   Wonderful place wall to wall videos sports whatever put Dancing Stars even though am heterosexual but food simple but great  deconstructed calamari fried wonton great  Hatari burger better  Also great pay hour pool tables!  Close downtown neighborhood Huntridge  Thanks manager JIllian Wickham most welcome hospitality  place great hope succeeds!!! Also stop Olivia's before coupon free tropical mini pizza  Quelle tasty! <EOR> I stopped new bar restaurant boulevard mall  experience phenomenal! place looks great many TV playing all sports music legit! food amazing far beyond would expect bar  highly recommend chipotle nachos wings burgers  plenty bartenders making pretty much any drink imagine! <EOR>
