LESSON LEARNED NEVER START TAB!  I Mulligans Landing first time meet some friends Karaoke night  place clean lively besides karaoke two pool tables electronic dart board  ordered beer gave female bartender debit card hold tab  halfway through beer noticed shift change bartender gone home   My friends great time playing crazy team dart game while people sang  ordered another beer shot game pool  Pretty fun night overall   When time home asked bill  dude behind bar cash but register needed receipt paper  He through four rolls five minutes until he managed print bill  Instead normal printout where write tip he handed receipt $15 50  asked why he mumbled something being computer's fault  thought amount high two beers right two shots Captain Morgan bill!  I told bartender only two beers he said The girl shirt musical notes all over said put those your tab  She friends left few minutes earlier  thought he must just misunderstood because she would never would just settle next day work   It turns she doesn't drink Captain Morgan neither does any other friends there  figured just honest mixup learned lesson pay cash only   then final charges card $20 50!  exactly $5 00 more receipt! intentional over billing   So instead paying $7 00 plus tip two beers ended paying $20 50   almost three times should paid! glad didn't $70 worth drinks because math would ended paying $205!  So thought accidental billing errors really deliberate over billing  shame because good time planning returning regularly  NEVER AGAIN  <EOR> My girl headed enjoy mellow night while visiting Vegas   weary when saw karaoke set lifting eyebrow giving friend sideways look   Then music started thought juke box   NO WAAAY guy singing live?!?  few bad apples but most part truly entertaining   Bartender needed little teaching manhattan guess no orders them Vegas he never made one! but all all good place   second bartender made nice old fashioned   yes classic classy whiskey girl mode   loooove old airplane them bar fun playful decor!  would visit again mellow non strip kinda night  <EOR> Didn't even chance see whether place good chill spot because treated very poorly employee upon entrance  10pm colleague looking beer some dinner decided Mulligans sounded good place go  door locked thought might closed until saw doorbell  rang doorbell heard buzz attempted open door still locked  tried opening door several times heard buzz constantly going off if might even broken  heard woman inside yelling something door tried again  Still locked  Finally door opened Mulligans employee yelling door open insisted locked continued try open door  She put handheld buzz device showing she used unlock door explained tried however door still locked  She extremely rude clearly very angry didn't walk into locked door  never back again way treated hope employee aware terrible service attention brought towards behavior towards paying customers  She blonde hair mid length bad attitude  ended going another bar grill tipped graciously kindness wonderful service Mulligans did provide minute upon entrance  <EOR> Great service anytime packed not    Great food drink specials employees    Karaoke nights great well    <EOR> Been coming 6 yrs off on  1 2 times month month two off between  Only Saturday night mostly  When build relationship bartender another comes replace  unfortunately new doesn't know regular  Tonight when ask moving machine gamblers them  just much paying customer then gambler  husband left early where expecting spend evening watching kareoke ordering more drinks  sadden coming back  <EOR> Mulligan's Landing sounds familiar huh?  because did review Mulligan's Border just couple weeks ago touted Cheers bar because often everyone knows names  Well isn't Cheers Mulligan's but owned same people but twist  bar run people run Mulligan's however grill end run Wholesome Foods Las Vegas  http www wholesomefoodslasvegas com throws bit spin review because now review may Mulligan's Landing but really room run Wholesome Foods  it?

Nice improvement especially wanna diva me    So few days ago friend messaged ask if I'd tried food Mulligans yet     Food?  thought all fries   so Friday afternoon night date night husband popped over     Tiffany Skye behind bar friendly funny prompt service   Two Shocktops orange at   $3 25 $3 50 piece isn't bad all   we'd ordered noticed Kilt Lifter under $5!!!  getting those next time!  We took peek brand new menu Skye's recommendation ordered Loco Burger   also ordered fried mac n cheese balls    Food came pretty quickly REALLY good    for being bar food exceptional     The Loco Burger caramelized onions bacon green peppers mushrooms 1 2 burger patty fried tortilla shell served AMAZING cheese sauce pesto aioli sour cream side   normally comes guacamole but allergic left off     This incredible   burger well seasoned cooked perfectly   All toppings delicious   cheese sauce made scratch canned bottled   meal faint heart its rich HUGE   Recommended split someone   Its LOT food but really delicious    The Fried mac cheese balls awesome too   Bits bacon jalapeno gave great flavor inside creamy yummy   Really enjoyed lot but probably wouldn't order two items together again   Rich food upon rich food   it bit much   They're excellent but good pairing together   Lesson learned     Had opportunity chat chef Ralph proudly let know EVERYTHING kitchen besides french fries all made fresh every day   scores extra points me   Nothing beats fresh ingredients     I really liked Mulligan's Landing lot before   bar staff nice pretty prompt   karaoke Mondays Wednesdays Fridays now brand new menu   don't much days anymore but most definitely making point come lot more often  <EOR> Mulligans main Monday night squeeze    They host weekly comedy open mic every Monday 10PMish frequenting since December last year when comedy thang began  comedy open mics least twice week if more  don't even perform just going  Some comedians cool people some them good comedians But always good time   It's those bars where employees hang days off  ALWAYS good sign  Happy employees happy customers  top comedy also host karaoke weekends gang regulars come out  almost Cheers very nice bartenders  Although some them bit absent minded times may flag them down drink they'll smiling when you  assuming friendly smile mwahaha made wait smirk but really knows even cares when good cheap drinks    They lose star because kitchen closes early around 10pm  We're spoiled when comes Las Vegas bar food that  But pubs PT's Lodge area 24 hour kitchens Mulligan's should least consider nights events comedy they'd benefit keeping open until least midnight one   Check if you're area Monday Friday Saturday night prepared good times leave your frown home! <EOR>
