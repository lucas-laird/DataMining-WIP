Well tells many more enticing options  place ok just good enough come back   The place nice comfortable spacious modern furniture mix seating options  couches tables pub height tables  seems would cool place hang but unfortunately don't enough free time just hang coffee shop sandwich shop   So sammie called Mandalay Bay $7   version Capriotti's Bobbie    Thanksgiving bun  Well version wasn't good Bobbie  smaller used sliced turkey instead pulled roasted turkey  stuffing cranberry sauce good though  bread decent but little crunchy side  side some excellent pasta salad which bits sausage salami tomatoes it   The staff all nice friendly  atmosphere comfortable  But ultimately food didn't impress enough come back   2 5 stars <EOR> I really surprised age girl taking order but she really friendly helpful  When came eat place generally empty except woman sitting table eating  person ended being workers   Anyways ordered cafe latte sandwich  latte best ever I'd rather come any Starbucks Coffee Bean  Definitely worth stopping trying out  <EOR> love little wifi zone few laptops provides customer wait order online free!

Very friendly employees    However am giving them 2 stars because food just wasn't great took 20 minutes table even though only ones waiting food X pick 3 egg scramble $8 95 summer salad chicken $11 95 caramel macchiato food tasted something could home portions pretty small   prices listed don't match serving all    drink tasty though!   I would recommend coming meeting study while grabbing something drink but food unfortunately pass   <EOR> Disappointing  really wanted place but sadly did not  When walked daughter tripped floor because raised much  Huge hazard! waiting more then five minutes no else restaurant ordered Bellagio asked tomato avocado added  chick said don't avocado  No 'sorry avocado' any kind friendly remark  sat down family waited food    As sat looked layout decor place  seating awkward best  two large tables four chairs around them  Some couches higher chairs  Apparently don't kitchen storage make shift storage closet corner dining room  Everything would suggested place just opened few months ago  asked when checked long girl told five years! personally think unappetizing when see into whole kitchen  plates being stored 6 inches ground under stove    Our food came again disappointed  use cheapest paper plates serve sandwiches don't even double plates  would thought seeing all real plates under stove use real plates but no    As said earlier ordered tomato sandwich didn't come tomato  Well no tomato  bread good  chicken sandwich big basically flavorless  flavors fine but missing something  husband's sandwich very small croissant  flavorless chicken salad  Again chicken big    Unimpressed! back! <EOR> The owner staff sweet  place doesn't seem highly trafficked many coffee joints Summerlin love that  seating very comfortable whether choose sit couch watch TV bistro style tables   The wifi free faaaaaast  even few computers should just wander want check email   Oh yeah coffee OK  lunch sandwiches good bagels toasted griddle which few places still do  love that    I dig joint  Stay away place around overrun suburban moms  <EOR>
