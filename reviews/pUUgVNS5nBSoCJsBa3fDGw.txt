<EOR> I've coming since summer time enjoy great specials AYCE   Sushi delish great prices     Now under new ownership returning   came tonight eat family service terrible   food still delish but AYCE menu less which okay   real problem horrible customer service beginning   never experienced such crappy service life anywhere else      From beginning took forever come take order then when girl came she acting flustered hard write tally sheet wanted   She back bar took 10 min ask question   Once order finally put waited more time   Finally food started coming but lot appetizers baked mussels sushi pieces salads never came   When addressed issue told coming never came ! Then complaining again lasagna roll hand roll coming told cancelled    we didn't cancel anything ! argued least avocado hand roll told hour could only dessert     Mind count hour when order placed     take forever start give table  asked soy sauce spicy mayo table owner herself told enough sauce sushi     When cousin started ask waitress something she said minute rudely never returned     Just horrible overall   many sushi places Vegas   sure fail   <EOR> We looking place stop sushi came across place disappointed  all eat every roll perfect shrimp lovers particular  definitely back! <EOR> Mega bucks Taste ex Girlfriend some favorite rolls here  love all eat option!! But if  something want la carte option  lunch too  Great bento boxes  MUST TRY YOUR SELF!! <EOR> I very impressed Sushi  favorite Strip Salmon  amazing  Everything fresh staff very friendly  would highly recommend place all sushi lovers  back Monday more    <EOR> Went AYCE 12 99 sushi lunch special   The special rolls only which 20 select you're going find something you'll want eat  Nigri 50cents piece appetizers 75 cents 2 bucks  SERIOUSLY cheap  Service fine if little slow  rolls fresh tasty  only complaint food use enough rice roll feed orphanage MONTH  Seriously WAY much rice  However considering price something kind expect deosn't detract much   If aren't ready AYCE also cheap bento boxes some sushi combos  GREAT lunch specials   Will definitely back! <EOR> I came girlfriend two friends Friday evening  When first walked quite dead only customers  No big deal figured Friday evening rush it packed later on    When table seemed waitresses really eager take orders  fact eager point where thought trying quick  AYCE began ordering  Also price AYCE something $21 EXCLUDING nigiri  If want nigiri pay extra $5 person  think great tactic bring customers $21 AYCE price but also kind unpleasantly surprising when find nigiri isn't included  No biggie though bc most sushi places $26 28 AYCE including Nigiri balances haha   All fish tasted fresh all rolls great  can't really remember names but lot variety  also enjoyed screaming O salad but felt little drenched sauce  Overall food great!  The reason why took 1 star off because service  Whenever told waitress still deciding she kinda looked annoyed pretty much ignored thereafter  flag different waitress down when ready nearly 30 minutes original waitress ditched us   think waitresses bit more attentive less annoyed if aren't ready order   Overall think place pretty good  still loyal sushi koma but probably try place again  <EOR> Very tasty     Read review    Service excellent    very affordable    Definetely would recommend !!!! <EOR> My favorite local AYCE sushi place! five minutes house smack dab heart suburbia without being touch trends expectations   atmosphere always welcoming casual excellent lunch but also nice enough relaxed date   used play lot 90s pop but they've recently switched JPop  Honestly if someone really listening music if alone wear headphones music doesn't really difference me  going two years now always stay delightfully consistent    Pros the fish great quality price point location  consistent  good price pretty much everything AYCE   Cons The menu should more detailed the cucumber salad specifically comes sweet creamy dressing neither expecting nor cared for Nigiri apps etc all great but rolls unimaginative almost all some kind fried tempura component    Service inconsistent gets slow if busy all  Also if sit table bar service better slightly faster  <EOR> We continue continue hope going better  service slow always 2 hours  Tonight ordered food 40 minutes late  offered limp shrimp tempora  Still coming slowly   Once food came ordered more because first order slow  hour now food came wreaking metal plastic  tried say could crunch kitchen   We just wanted tried say oh atleast wait rest come declined because if roll comes smelling tasting metal plastic why would all want continue eat? They delayed bringing check  atleast only charged 2 all eat orders  tried explain isnt normal blamed chef  said no time seems norm last few times stuck due slow service slow cooks  She just kept trying explain  weary! <EOR> I really love food all rolls here  Lasagna roll amazing  Also there's good prices  But service very bad  Rude waitress always want cheat take extra money  really big minus place  <EOR> Well goes  Its really funny person major attitude ruin place love  third visit probably last  misfortune having Justin sushi chef bar  guy major bad attitude  He acts bothering if order! roll he made wife just fell apart he completely forgot orders when asked heads sweet shrimp he just said No  late   hell kind customer service guy trained in? made great sushi bar turn into worst experience! many choices around restaurants need customers treated way  If the sushi does correct rude behavior then everyone across street Naka Sushi   sushi bar where feel welcome! <EOR> All say yummm!  usual tempura appetizer order chirashi yumm o!  never cease amaze me! <EOR> Everything great except service  Seeeeeems ignored more more longer stay AYCE  I don't know if tradition AYCE sushi places but time seemed quite obvious no longer wanted take orders  Everything tastes very good when though  <EOR> Sushi tastes great   Service good   reason four stars because every time call order takeout   tell come 10 minutes but don't actually start preparing sushi till always wait which bad especially when hurry  <EOR> We visiting Texas looking great sushi place  Saw good reviews gave shot  disappointed!
