FINALLY!!!  I lived Tokyo three years loved frequenting curry restaurant called CoCo Curry House Ichibanya  first time Japanese curry made scratch amazing  knew curry could taste good!  It's ten years  Ten years longing spicy oh so comforting curry perfect warm side naan  course made curry home but just same   Thank God Curry Zen!!! place satisfied relentless growing craving since coming back states  curry savory but heavy  flavorful but overpowering  perfect   I really spicy food 8 thought could still crank heat  But boyfriend  also likes spicy food 5 said perfect  you  technically 100  Haha next time try 10   Also  Tonkatsu really great  Fried food point   My only problem though  which why 4 5 star review food came warm temperature  prefer curry coming piping hot! Still best curry states  just ask them heat little more next time  Worth it  <EOR> The portions tiny comparison other curry spots which pretty sad super hungry too! Haha  flavor good tasty though  mango cheesecake alright    nothing special  size palm  curry katsu chicken good well nothing special  <EOR> Ordered Pork Katsu Curry vegetables white rice takoyaki balls mango cheesecake lunch    This first time eating Curry Zen via Uber Eats but probably won't order again   First all only ordered Pork Katsu Curry because few reviewers favored over Chicken Katsu    Big mistake!   If all over again I'd order Chicken Katsu Sausage Curry only because they're cheaper but because Pork dry absolutely inedible without curry sauce    Second all curry lacked complexity flavor  did it  Loved heat but wish bit more balanced  Pretty good but definitely missing something    Third everyone raves takoyaki balls but didn't them  could just palette but didn't mushy fishy tasting were  If mushy fishy right your alley   Lastly favorite part whole meal Mango Cheesecake  Yum!! Other reviewers complained small cheesecake and yes small but thought well worth price  little mango chunks inside good  cheesecake quality taste all all very delicious    Ranking meal #1 Mango Cheesecake #2 Curry Sauce Vegetables #3 White Rice perfectly cooked no issues #4 Takoyaki eh   #5 Pork Katsu Yuck! <EOR> Yum! Since easier Vegas 808 some wholesome Japanese Curry glad discovered place  well  husband did he gets credit  curry definitely point  silky smooth levels spice just way it  love add things cheese corn! Yum!   I chicken katsu which remained crispy ate curry sauced poured all over it! back again sure! <EOR> Loved original place Chinatown finding place right down street made super excited! curry packed flavor  love getting chicken katsu curry comes rice  great! also side croquette think katsu batter but around potato   Missing star due experience outside food  felt bad workers could see stressed trying balance cooking food taking orders    all tables besides left dirty patrons before  friends clean other ppls mess  definitely should try some kind system flow everything smoother  Other definitely check some good food! <EOR> I've never eaten inside restaurant usually pick food way home work   You order Yelp use app 10% off first order send email  confirm time your order ready  really convenient ordering process takes just couple minutes max    The staff counter friendly  If plan eat seating    What order guessed it    Curry   You anyway want all options have Chicken Pork Vegetables Noodles Rice on    What is Chicken Katsu  Spicy 5 7 Add fried egg vegetables extra sauce almond slivers raisins side   With all food enough 2 people share just save leftovers    We'll back soon since become weekly pick staple us  <EOR> If passed Curry Zen street you'd probably want in  IN! those amazing hole wall spots serves some best tasting curry had! If sit take look menu    took some TERRIBLE pictures  But all delicious!!!  FOOD lvl 5 veggie shrimp udon  Simple perfection  great portion enough lunch next day perfect lvl heat me  also fried Oysters 3 5 naan bread I think type curry sauce comes but wasn't big fan that     SERVICE Fantastic!

Why does Katsu  fried perfectly golden while other burnt around edges?  I know flavor won't taste exactly same perhaps sauce might vary time time but qualities keep under quality control should stay under quality control  If then  just giving Curry Zen bad name    And why whenever there's horrible horrible odor coming bathroom?   Yes location close home but worth it? Perhaps if enjoy mediocrity    I say 2 1 2 but round score 3 convenient location  <EOR> I normally don't eat curry but bf craving decided give try say missing curry  pretty good definitely coming back  <EOR> First all would put Curry Zen Spring Mountain Decatur favorite restaurants  Nonetheless when first heard going open location near house ecstatic  being said really high expectations establishment  All expectations reached!! Ambience customer Service etc    Something fan fact don't proper plates utensils  BUT understand since EXPRESS restaurant  Another which think might personal problem but curry just doesn't taste same  Still pretty great! But same    Leaving good note totally recommend Curry Zen all friends <EOR> Quick  Delicious  Consistent  Friendly    Zen Curry Express favorite places eat! always chicken katsu small rice regular curry portion spice level 4  If 5 feels 7! deliciously paired     ugh always forget say the red pickled radishes white onion root    ryokyo ? sorry! location always clean food hot fresh   Typically order ahead 10 minutes pick way home location very convenient   My complaint    wish some sort loyalty stamp card lol! <EOR> Food great!

Different your normal Indian curry Thai curry place Japanese curry! love spices especially number 5 today  ordered pseudo loco moco plate  Japanese meat loaf huge portion rice over easy egg curry other side! delish! <EOR> Zen curry   a good place eat Japanese curry lol  Anyways quick seated just depends day your going   weekdays preferred  good spice level but bit weak usually three balance  Great service  <EOR> Yaaaaaasssss! Yes ALL it   The portion sizes pretty good  price point honestly little expensive  start $6 95 just there   I ended getting grilled chicken curry $9 95 added spinach $2 50 egg $4 50   Easily $16   I don't really frame reference another similar spot price comparison  would consider fair though   I'll back day hungry  even ask box put leftover curry because much it definitely some rice home finish off   The mix match possibilities endless   Excited return! <EOR> I really curry zen  They're bit small but doable  awesome service food quality just great original Curry Zen  set very clean inside  <EOR> Got sent wrong Curry Zen but still pleased quality taste familiar Spring Mountain Rd  Service super friendly able order a la cart exactly wanted options protons well  Spicy level 3 already pretty spicy don't know people any higher  Still must visit every time come Vegas <EOR> I love Curry Zen Spring Mountain but lot times going Chinatown such inconvenience because parking  glad Curry Zen Express side town its far house  place good Chinatown location but good enough  most part curry tastes same but sometimes feel bit sweetness curry  dislike because really don't think curry should sweet LOL   They all main toppings Chicken Katsu Kurobuta Sausage Beef Spam Steamed Tofu  If order take suggest calling your order because sometimes wait long  Also may want request curry side  Otherwise just pour curry plastic containers along rice toppings  first time ordered take didn't know don't pack curry separately they Chinatown location   When home rice kind soggy    Service always friendly parking problem  However complaint place 50% time don't any brown rice! Its always just batch call day  Please extra rice cooker more brown rice!  Very convenient definitely back  Closed Sundays  <EOR> The upside closer house   Good curry pan croquettes but favorite place curry house Los Angeles   place second favorite especially when need curry pan Bread fix lol customer service needs some work   great Curry House  take note curry zen   Otherwise good  Happy yelping xoxox <EOR> I ordered some curry zen delivery food really good! Chicken katsu still crispy when arrived which great! curry spinach scrambled eggs which always great  spinach curry healthier course! rice cooked perfectly fluffy    The only thing terrible Thai tea! bland! tasted 95% water dash Thai tea  could barely taste anything  messes Thai tea?! Anyways lose star that  Also asked some pickled shallots ginger side didn't those order either  lose star that    I wish future right write new review but man really put off Thai tea  <EOR>
