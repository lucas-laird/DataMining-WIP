Really? Ok guess could happen 10 00 pm   He prepares hands eat it   it eatable but WASN'T TORO!! regular old hamachi old mean tomorrow no longer good except deep fry  son sushi chef  know toro!! only downhill there  would only ever expect salmon skin used very small quantities almost condiment  ordered double down salmon roll believing description going some great salmon sprinkling salmon skin  Wrong! roll full  FULL  of crunchy salty salmon skin two anemic tasteless pieces salmon but mostly unripe avocado slices top  Disgusting!! felt chef KNEW distasteful he fellow chefs joking salmon skin he making it  Lastly ordered sizzling tuna sashimi  Sizzling apparently accomplished passing torch flame over pieces until somewhat grey lukewarm  don't know place such rave reviews but if someone going those reviews did should know isn't always great  <EOR> Came mom uncle Friday around 5 30  Pretty quiet still but restaurant filled finished   Food good  Hawaiian style Japanese    Eggplant Fries decisive winner  now!    The calimari tempura ok  pork belly good but sweet smoky sauce sour pickle lose pork belly goodness  chicken teriyaki bowl excellent  Very moist because used dark meat  ton katsu also very moist crispy  Didn't try sushi but looked some worthwhile selections    Overall good experience  Nice staff overly loud decent food  eggplant fries if you're interested rest  good! <EOR> Mediocre best  yellowtail sashimi good but tuna salmon tasted refrigerated quite while  Did taste fresh  32 bucks low quality sashimi special lot expensive  Give fresh sashimi ok price  <EOR> Nice little Japanese restaurant very spacious too    Wasn't busy night seated immediately  ordered Tonkotsu Ramen friend ordered Spicy Tuna Bowl  Service very fast waiter really friendly!  The ramen smelled delicious when  He brought out  However found broth bit salty  thick cuts meat ramen noodles pretty thick too  good but best  If less salty would enjoyed more    I also taste spicy tuna bowl wish instead! pretty big bowl too!   Overall good experience probably come back when happy hour <EOR> My husband night just try different Japanese Asian restaurant   We standing hostess waiting seated 15min no else line but although could understand she phone another customer lot questions  Regardless wish manager walking around just asking people dinner could given any many tables available night   After seated server took another 15 20min said she thought order taken already  She nice though but still expected little more that  My husband beef teriyaki couple sushis   His beef teriyaki extremely disappointing beef seemed old re heated  ok flavor but quality meet just terrible   The two rolls ordered just ok much rice packed into it  nothing memorable all  Paying more $70 meal would quickly tossed trash painful   The star giving restaurant server kind enough keep coming back re fill hot tea  Other would never recommend anyone know place waste money  There's lot other better Japanese restaurants town  <EOR> Love coming during happy hour  Price good food service  crispy shrimp roll desert fudge brownie good <EOR> Cant wrong sushi!

<EOR> $6 2 pieces salmon nigiri took 40min come table  Really over priced slow service  However gyoza pretty decent chicken bowl came quick    tl dr horrible but worth it   **edit** appreciate business responded says something management  Bumped 3 stars  <EOR> Do eat restaurant!!!! hostess server management all rude disrespectful  food below average but attitude employees really terrible!!! <EOR> Stayed South Point first time wanted sushi type food family decided try since inside hotel first time ate knew would come back  Sushi just good  Try catch them happy hour time though cause good selection great prices  <EOR> This little place located right hand side back South Point hotel casino next Steak'n Shake  First time year ago sushi great  Second time decided signature entrees  very flavorful portion bit smaller I'd imagine  But lovely service very accommodating don't feel bad experience because $25 off dining coupon Grandview  <EOR> This second time Zenshin  food excellent  gave 4 stars because seated sushi bar took over 15 mins someone acknowledge presence even water  However when server Emiko arrived she very attentive food came quickly  Service great earlier mishap  Everything delicious! She offered dessert because wait  Thank Emiko!  back again  <EOR> Soo disappointed   Last time Las Vegas received great service excellent food  But time received non waiter Garret cold unprofessional  He didn't pay any attention until 30 mins sitting down we even made reservation then forgot bring 3 drinks  received food another server he ignored until received bill  even tried flag down drink refill he ignored me! never back sushi place again! <EOR> I came many times never disappointed! menu perfect! pick easily something all your family! staff very professional nice! happy menu low prices  highly recommend Philadelphia Tempura edamame salmon cake    ! It's South Point Casino easy come easy park easy find! Enjoy! <EOR> This second time week! looking sushi restaurant date night wanted stay close house  never thought twice restaurant before because location which inside Southpoint but when saw positive reviews decided try it  new local sushi favorite least while! Everything very fresh unique rolls  big fan cilantro top sushi rolls few choose which sold immediately  rolls sized correctly most sushi places love rolls big can't fit inside your mouth but  case here  good happy hour specials they're open late which plus  also 10% off yelp check which always perk  <EOR> The sashimi wonderful!!!!!  Some appetizers over sauced times but really good   Recently added daily sushi specials which really nice  <EOR> The quick Service horrible food good    I dined party 7 maybe larger party size threw restaurant off? sure but service awful many ways  waitress consistently forgot party 7 only brought 5 everything plates silverware etc   She even forgot take orders 2 people present!   We shocked going thought certain being pranked TV show   but no such luck   One appetizers ordered arrived END meal  timing all food just awful  bill rung incorrectly top all off    Thankfully food good  didn't expect much sushi but fairly good  bites everyone's food around pleasant well  If edamame try chili garlic flavor or whatever non regular flavor is surprisingly delicious! <EOR> I'm type person quick only say share what's wrong experience when eat out   type person say share positives well  Honestly takes little bit more effort compelled say share positive negatives most people do    Zenshin's owner general manager reached negative experience   shared story replied felt sincere   handled situation fair well   am actually impress handled themselves towards because during communication via email still feeling bad taste mouth regarding service rest group received restaurant   Everyone knows first impression counts failed miserably category but lasting impression received left feeling respected   Thank giving Zenshin   definitely respect that   Moving on        here final review   food delicious like mentioned original review    If service good first time around would no problem giving Zenshin all 5 stars   So    the fact rating Zenshin 1 star 4 stars should probably give everyone idea food delight   Again thank you  <EOR> Good food received great service team led Christine!

Apparently someone else running card because she busy walked right minute   doesn't seem very good communication staff while sitting sushi bar heard many times people waiting 30 minutes more sashimi   Maybe just having bad night altogether   I am giving them benefit doubt 3 stars based off proactive manager even without saying anything   All other reviews seem pretty decent could just off night  <EOR> I really want give place more stars only because staff service excellent but just way many cons 3 stars being generous  Came friend referral local Vegas  Remind call friend later  Appears most locals come oxtail ramen  Sounds delicious hearty right?
