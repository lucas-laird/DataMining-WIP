Might try net time   I love fully saturated theme establishments   this no exception memorabilia Evel Knievel's insane life all over walls behind counter  fancy place   it's very NYC street feeling would expect find any neighborhood  <EOR> A very substantial addition already burgeoning food offers block Fremont  Specializing pizza could tell? place channels its inner Butte Montana provide visitor feels pizza joint decades but reality only moved last month    They pies slices  few specialty slices interesting rattlesnake which utilizes real snake pheasant meatballs  What's more metal snake meat your pizza?!  What's pizza without beer? bottles draft cans choose from  Good selection all  If you'd something little more heavy full bar available well wine   Great service when visited  They're doing good job working tourist crowd while keeping things inviting locals too  <EOR> I visit East Fremont frequently noticed new eatery opened previously occupied space  Frankly attention sandwich board offering slice cheese pizza pint PBR $5 00  Not bad deal per menu board slice cheese pizza listed $4 00 pint domestic beer $4 00  Evel Pie looks combination old fashion NYC pizza joint + neighborhood dive bar  inside comfortably worn but clean  decorated eclectic kitsch  most paying tribute Evel Knievel  small table games bar tables  bar good selection beers tap bottles can  also serve cocktails   But I'd focus pizza  You buy slices whole pies  liked best pizza crust  really good NY style slice crust thick thin nice crisp but dry when folded really nice crunch   topping good taste quality sufficient quantity   It wasn't crowded while there  Maybe because midday mid week maybe because place open less week  But see place being great place hang friends some day drinking    Bottom line If local nice place hang out  If visitor nice place some good food drink non tourist prices  <EOR> We walked thought end notice name Evil Pie  checking rating decided try  far East side Fremont really main section  Pizza great!

Pinball only 25 cents 5 balls 4 players lots fun  <EOR> Evel Knievel legend place theme needs live name  happy say place does!   Good beer selection Tasty big slices Fantastic decor  This hangout spot least once twice week me  glad place exists   Oh also $5 gets beer slice  Can't wrong when you're hungry downtown  <EOR> Punk rock pizza place  Looks super rad  cool vegan options but isn't much the slice  free animal products just veggie sauce only slice    Also can't happy hour special veggie pizza nor $6 slice PBR should least good veggie w no cheese option  yeah place almost perfect but $10 veggie slice w no cheese PBR little steep   The pizza sauce dope  <EOR> This Evel Knievel themed pizza place interesting place stop Fremont east  tasty New York style thin crust pizza other Italian cuisine  smell pizza cooking draws off street! pizza good quite East coast good but would eat again  full bar also  There's variety Evel Knievel memorabilia hanging walls glance while waiting  staff very friendly attentive  prices right quick stop off slice drink  <EOR> We stopped eat during Mint 400 celebration   If love biker rocker bar atmosphere place you   walls covered Evel Knievel celebrity memorabilia   best rock metal blasting through speakers   while good selection beer tap far best Root Beer!  Probably best root beer anywhere   The pizza good but better   fair am quite picky pizza nothing real Long Island NY pizza!  Evel Pie nice thin crust decent flavor sauce thankfully use sparingly   garlic knots roll things NO GARLIC whatsoever VERY dry   Grandma's Balls pretty good     So overall OK place pizza   better places Vegas pizza   But non offer delicious root beer tap fun environment Evel Pie offers  <EOR> Ok should written review few days ago but   love pizza doesn't right     well super picky crust theirs amazing light crisp      but gluten free missed pizza much gluten free pizza isn't good regular thought      ordered gluten free pizza kinda deep dish but better fan off deep dish tasted regular flour crust light airy add cheese around outside crust AMAZING!!!! ate two guys skeptical honestly don't gluten free crap but even raving ! posted picture see yourself !
