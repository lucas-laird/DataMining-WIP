<EOR> My continual quest recreate some best Hainanese Chicken Rice dishes during month long vacation Asia 2017 brought Flock Fowl   Every chicken rice dish Singapore my all time favorite Thailand Hong Kong Vietnam fondly memorable all its own unique twists representative countries origin   Unfortunately Flock Fowl came nowhere close bringing back those fond sensories long for     Interestingly Flock Fowl does attempt create its own take its signature Hainanese Chicken Rice $14 99    more nontraditional but nouveau take traditional beloved Asian dish   Everything made house ginger scallion sauce pickled vegetables chile sauce down even soy sauce   However maybe should continue retooling recipes bit before actually serving them   ginger scallion sauce which often made home cooks including myself downright bland   Adding some sea salt more scallions really would've given needed oomph  Conversely in house made soy sauce distinct medicinal flavor reminded potent Chinese herbal medicinal soups Mom forced down brother when little   Any Chinese kid experienced knows definitely something you'd want serve restaurant unless you're trying sway off customers ever returning   why would want dip your perfectly poached Hainanese Chicken into something that?    Now all white Hainanese chicken served skin very nicely done   Perfectly moist though small portion size given price   No complaints here  also liked perfectly prepared hour egg made sous vide    The rice which made chicken schmaltz also tasted bland did watered down tasting bone broth   Typically broth accompanies dish very flavorful but again maybe need back drawing board two items well   Wasn't fan ambiance much   dining area somewhat small long   perfectly fine simple lunch if work downtown but definitely wouldn't way dinner here  came Summerlin frankly disappointed made trip across town   Oddly did something annoying never seen restaurant before   When you're seated can't help but see large bottle Vero water placed each tables   look appealing when you're thirsty they're nice frosty bottle look may already chilled   However immediately asked upon being seated if wanted regular tap water if I'd purchase bottle $4 00   passed $4 00 water waitress quickly snatched bottle  **IMO some strange greedy passive aggressive sales technique contrived owners accost additional $4 00 more every table**! no problem all offering bottled water many restaurants commonly but really don't care sort annoying tacky approach displaying your goods sale right top table!!   Apparently chef James Beard Award Semifinalist   Note winner but semifinalist   Regardless says little final product served day day out   Numerous low keyed restaurants all over serve phenomenal food great settings but never recognition awards because aren't versed pumping public relations usually paid for playing political games necessary achieve kinds accolades     All being said if you're downtown craving Hainanese Chicken Rice then may your only option   Beggars can't choosers  Personally if given choice I'd opt instead Spring Mountain any day somewhere Chinatown where options plentiful much better tasting authentic better priced   quest continues on     P S   Difficult parking during lunch time  <EOR> Hipster  word comes mind when walking into restaurant  don't even take cash ok  ordered 2 chicken rice w dark meat togo total $41  complain much price but little much  mean just chicken rice  pass $4 extra dark meat?
