Vino Nobile fine mild  yet delicious  aroncini   But strozzapretti seemed thin sour   But Cabernet kept rich pasta   asked Gina bring glass Cabernet well enjoyed rest meal!  Gina claims no expert wines but golly she knows best menu selections!  more adequate selections menu wine list fully satisfy anyone enjoys authentic Italian cuisine   Las Vegans PLEASE support fine little establishment!!!  defintiely would want lose!

We restaurant encouraged all italian speaking customers must know something   waiter told none wines wine list but put anyway because new wine list new wines wasn't printed   bit quirky but he recommended Pinot Grigio decent   so onward   As first time asked waiter recommendations ordered food   fried bread mozzarella tomato sauce filet sole francese   Gf calamari recommended server else?! cioppino     My appetizer glorified grilled cheese sandwich nothing special but bad huge serving   gf's appetizer did come all   shared halfway through appetizer when asked waiter calamari   He said would ready 3 minutes   Obviously started cooking right then few minutes later came calamari entree!    Her calamari good   breading decent but squid itself not   dipping sauce however excellent   place some better tomato sauce Las Vegas     Let's talk entrees fish raw inside   If check profile love sushi but half cooked half raw lower quality fish   francese sauce seemed good but hard over mushy egg coating raw inside   side vegetables excellent but really starving something good say  pun? We asked gf's entree told would soon   30 minutes later left without getting fish cioppino   waiter obviously let down   spent 1 hr 20 minutes glass wine each grilled cheese sandwich bowl undercooked calamari   left $40 table walked out     Our waiter never admitted single mistake nor brought comp'd glass wine hold during wait   fact wine glasses empty between 30 45 minutes still did attention waiter   owner did acknowledge mostly uneaten bowl calamari entree sent back   When walked passed owner couldn't bothered even spare glance     This restaurant busy   no reason table six arrived 30 minutes did should finishing entrees when walked hungry unserved   Also brand new busgirl   She sweet but no training left own devices   She only saw unhappiness but obviously no position anything it     To quote gf romantic dinner turned entire evening sour  Thanks nothing Gina  <EOR> Great service!
