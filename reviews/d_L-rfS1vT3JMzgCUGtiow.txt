Our friends live Las Vegas recommend meet them brunch Sunday   able quick easy reservation Opentable even changed few times without any problems  We seated really quickly best waitress named Darlene   waiting 3 people group while waited Darlene brought complimentary pigs blanket   also wanted mimosas she suggested bottomless try different kinds kept bringing different varieties   The lunch menu did look good but brunch menu looked good that   basically small plates all share   There's much choose Darlene said she take control bring almost everything   she wasn't lying!!  much food felt bad wasting stuff when getting full!!!!  Everything fantastic!!  thing thought would good churro tots   bit underwhelming but still good     We celebrating two birthdays Darlene even sang table!!  She funny attentive everyone should waiter!!    I tell everyone Vegas because great!!! <EOR> We brunch Sunday morning reading Border Grill Vegas Rated magazine   $24 99 all you can eat brunch but isn't your usual Vegas buffet everything made order served tapas style     We started fresh fruit plate guava empanada   guava empanada heavenly   the filling almost guava cream cheese   Next tried chilaquiles green corn tamale   green corn tamale sweet delicious just little sour cream   followed Yucatan eggs benedict delicious all fellow Yelpers let steak eggs   husband huge fan steak eggs   I think he only shared bite   breakfast enchilada chorizo egg taco last   am huge chorizo fan did enjoy taco but breakfast enchilada amazing   chicken flavorful tender loved cotija cheese   dessert ordered coconut french toast which perfect ending fabulous meal   just right amount sweet     Our server tremendous very sweet always refill all you can drink mimosas only $5!    passionfruit incredible may overindulged!  Check restaurant com see if gift certificate available   $25 gift certificate $10 before went  <EOR> Food okay but over priced  waiter lousy only checked time when all finished  He didn't give take plates ask refills  When bill came around he immediately collect tip upset because he felt didn't give enough money  He even said Wow behind walking out  He tall guy blond hair glasses  prepared disrespected when walk into place  Last time sure tell story wherever go   If looking authentic Mexican food head over Javier's Authentic Mexican Cuisine inside Aria  won't attitude frustrated dudes hate job  Rather great homegrown Mexican service feel good paying for  <EOR> My wife really enjoyed place  Food kind expensive but well worth it    ate twice would again  No complaints  would love border grill home town  <EOR> Guac amazing!  charge water filtration system little off putting though   actually thought having wedding reception lower level area   Great food drinks! <EOR> If possible award eatery negative value stars would most certainly given Border Grill negative 10    I arrived company four other people late afternoon going Aquarium exhibit  all very hungry excited some Mexican food  We're Texas thought would interesting see Top Chef's award winning Mexican food would measure stellar Tex Mex food which accustomed    Upon arrival hostess cheery enough if bit airhead  being seated waited full five minutes before even being greeted server  Following perfunctory greeting brought chips salsa both lackluster bland wait another 5 minutes water  waiter nice enough but seemed mostly unconcerned giving good service making decent impression   The menu itself rather pricey  If you're place charges $ 4 50 fish taco la carte tortilla size drink coaster even smaller filet Mahi Mahi know won't able leave restaurant without paying upwards $ 25 00 per person per dish  food billed Mexican but no true Mexican dishes menu  Everything seemed more Central South American   Let preface actual food review saying waited grand total 35 minutes food arrive  point trying eat waiter already conveniently disappeared    I ordered chile relleno burger paprika seasoned fries fish taco la carte  asked burger rare because 1 cuts down cooking time ravenous 2 simply cannot stand overcooked rubbery meat patty   The other members party ordered 1 crab nachos 2 beef nachos 3 avocado tacos 4 chicken caesar salad   1 crab nachos adequate  self proclaimed grill specializing seafood meat rather bland tasteless downplayed plethora toppings heaped upon actual chip  2 The beef nachos already limp when arrived table  meat wholly bland kitchen chose under employ cheese making overall nacho rather boring  3 avocado tacos great disappointment  said consumer food idea avocado tacos excellent but actual execution taco underwhelming   4 chicken caesar salad probably worst thing served  might questioning world kitchen mess which essentially chopped greens simple meat fillet  Well when your caesar dressing taste consistency mayonnaise literally drenching salad tend look unfavorably upon dish   5 chile relleno burger probably best thing served  burger cooked standard chile relleno itself decent if bit bland  fries only really yummy thing served sure  something Mexican restaurant should proud of   6 The fish taco terrible  corn tortilla while homemade bland thick filet Mahi Mahi thick overcooked bland  guacamole tasted something could grocery store heavily salted    The overall really shocking thing lack seasoning  chefs behind menu award winning famed but don't know use simple seasoning food palatable    The bill wound being over $ 150 00 when checkbook finally made table paid left tip hell there  wound gastrointestinal issues later night  If you're looking good Mexican food highly suggest going elsewhere  give idea deeply disappointing food would suggest going Taco Bell instead  least you're only paying $ 99 taco diarrhea cheaper  <EOR> Sat Sun Brunch definitely worth $35   Unlimited Mimosas great tapas   this isn't buffet brining fresh tapas kitchen just pick things would did just tell them steadily bring things beautiful selection breakfast oriented tapas just keeps coming   favorites far Chilaquiles Shrimp Grits excellent   Also love oyster rockefeller fruit cup salmon slider  Sat downstairs pool outside great people watching because

This first time restaurant hype friends certainly legitimate  never any ones Los Angeles but supposedly according fellow Yelper Cori G  Vegas far superior    We came lunch driving all day peeked menu ahead time already prepared order Baja ceviche  waiter then informed if wanted could order all three mix two different ones together which intriguing  opted just but think next time try all three because totally blown away Baja one  bright acidic lots onion delicious tender chunks fish shrimp  mouth watering right now just thinking those tart tangy flavors just little bit spice jalapeno  Yum!  We also ordered guacamole couple plates crispy rajas tacos both equally delicious  guacamole could lot bigger opinion but did trick tacos very unique appetizer  simple crispy potato tacos accentuated salty cotija cheese sweet roasted corn  All flavors came together very nicely dish but shame only two $10!  Of course prices pretty high but expecting restaurant inside Mandalay Bay  Overall would definitely recommend place anyone area doesn't mind splurging little meal  am also really interested trying Los Angeles chains hopefully equally good  <EOR> Best Mexican food ever had  corn tamales real good Free Yelp check in   flavors dishes unique tell shrimps purple potatoes everything super fresh  even saw Susan Feniger owner celebrity check walking around restaurant   great Travelzoo voucher 2 4 people which made meal even sweeter  salted chocolate chip cookies dessert great generous 6 warm crunchy cookies  <EOR> Although really 3 star place am tempted give them 4 stars because wasteland overpriced mediocre food Las Vegas food scene place actually bad!

Service also spectacular  back sure! <EOR> My husband eaten before but time certain restrictions    medically careful food drinks    waitress managers made sure accommodate restrictions did smile face    looked your nuts when telling them u can't great    if ur ever Vegas place to!!! <EOR> If over priced bougie Mexican food place place you   don't even really know Mexican food bougie but place figured out   menus convoluted descriptions very basic Mexican dishes     Their tamale appetizer crap   supposed baked tamale but ended being mush   wasn't even cooked properly   If way served don't call tamale call corn tamalito corn mush   btw if wanted corn mush would Chevy's fine dining Mexican restaurant   They don't set table salt pepper which think really weird   When asked salt waitress said for?  Your chips? couldn't otherwise   When salt arrived served side dish   shaker   YET sell cookbooks  Don't come back restaurant cook your own food books  BAD marketing   This place isn't worth when many other restaurants don't need try hard Border Grill does   offer salt  <EOR> Was shopping Mandalay Bay friend wanted grab bite decided place  approached hostess she said happy hour bar     SCORE!!!!! 1 2 price margaritas  Wooooo hoooo loves some ritas! starting off fantastic  bartender came over very quickly drink order  ordered happy hour margarita jiff he came delivered  Talk fast! barely time drop off complimentary chips salsa!

Definitely wanted more  brisket taquitos delicious extremely filling  cousins chicken tacos fish tacos all raves good were  bar restaurant before knew signed VIP membership some sort mentioned Danny he took care taking believe 10% off bill  great  Highly recommend place! <EOR> I've add Border Grill list Top Chef Masters restaurants disappoint  joins couple other spots misfortune visiting Zentan Susur Lee Washington DC RIck Moonen's RM Seafood Room Vegas  Border Grill three times now quality slipped expectations risen because each visit leave less satisfied   We decided come family night  yup kid tow looking family friendly spot would happy good enough food happy  points having kids menu and also gluten free menu anyone looking that   Unfortunately food didn't thrill any us   The plantain empanadas $9 filled mixture roasted plantains black beans poblano peppers cotija cheese  sweetness plantains dominated flavor dish  love plantains isn't necessarily bad thing just observation  empanada dough more mushy then flaky which disappointment  four per order plan share   The Baja ceviche $15 huge order lime marinated halibut shrimp sitting corn tortilla slice avocado sitting top  much lime fish didn't taste all fresh  also seemed dish mass produced probably sitting around those lime juices quite some time   The first entree way table something off 'Specials' menu  shrimp stuffed crab wrapped bacon some sort cilantro pesto sauce something I can't remember exactly $26   sounded awesome but turned hot mess  much bacon no detectable crab near shrimp million ingredients over complicated dish   The Negro Modelo braised short ribs $29 much better  came two large chunks boneless beef atop corn polenta cherry tomato salsa fresca molasses habanero BBQ sauce  beef could more tender but flavors pretty good slight bitterness Negro Modelo sweetness sauce  wasn't overly spicy    The kids cheese quesadilla $4 filled cotija cheese I think?   Fine adults but 3 yr old developing taste buds    no  He wasn't fan  bad didn't just cheddar monterey jack cheese blend   Our little guy did scoop chocolate ice cream $3 accompanied fresh berries  He loved ice cream but still learning berries   The wife split flourless chocolate cake prickly pear lychee sauce raspberries $10   heavier denser expected but still rich chocolatey  crust bottom cake slightly overcooked hard   Along mediocre food spotty service  server friendly but very busy disappeared often  isn't fine dining but prices charge could step things bit  Little things clearing empty dishes replacing silverware would big difference  whole atmosphere more laid back then remember the last time probably 2+ years ago   almost felt small step Chevy's Fresh Mex those type places  also charge fifty cents water per person  Although son didn't water charged anyway     Another thing annoying decided sit people right next when most dining room completely empty  Why space people more?  It pricey meal but least armed restaurant com gift certificate  also tried use Border Grill VIP card which normally gets 15% discount but management said couldn't take both gift certificate VIP card  <EOR> I love watching cooking shows   just moved Las Vegas friend took Border Grill   Everything beans rice Shrimp beyond over cooked   am Houston grew Mexican food   all over Mexico Hispancis professionan cook better   then convention healthcare once again met Border Grill   Every appertizer good   served some thick thick pastey good filled serval different iems   If paying would demand money back  <EOR> This place best brunch ever eaten   don't buffet instead give list plates order many want included price many times want   aren't your traditional brunch items unusual takes guava empanadas   also add unlimited mimosas they several types just few bucks more  <EOR> I love border grill Santa Monica DTLA  shame service Vegas location horrible  <EOR> Every time am Vegas Border Grill drink appetizers   very best margaritas ever had   little pricey but case pay for  <EOR> We came recommendation friend finds hard find decent Mexican food Vegas    The good? pretty good service decent guacamole friend's scallops great just doused sauce  Oh she ordered blood orange margarita delicious!  The rest meal? Salsas quite bland steak nachos covered some orange sauce made stomach somersaults almost immediately   Strangely enough carne asada nachos better then carne asada plate ordered  Also specifically asked veggies came meal because said could substitute  waitress told squash zucchini  Perfect! friend both ordered veggies  When meals served she veggies ones plate tomatoes cucumber  more tiny Greek salad  highly annoyed  dessert just ordered toddler berries whipped cream  berries came bowl side dish  maybe dozen total  whipped cream side creme fraiche  toddler  Really? She's two  no kept coming mouth    Lastly pricing  paid $138 two appetizers two main courses tiny bowl fruit alcoholic drink two sodas  and only ate 65% meal  Huge disappointment  more confused pricing items  understand Vegas pay location  Seriously  it  But since when scallops shrimp same price quesadilla enchiladas?? admit quesadilla looked appetizing but soul wouldn't let order it  Quesadillas eat when need throw something together quick!  I would eat again  would rather spend more money indulge taste buds  think most don't enjoy meal when overpriced below satisfactory  bf barely finished meal words daughter said no it  <EOR> We came today Darlene suggest amazing tasting menu   tried border guacamole quest fundido chiles toreados octopus Assad plantain empanadas 3 different kinds ceviches Chloe relleno lamb adobo tacos grilled fish tacos lime marinated half chicken skirt steak Yucatán pork garlic shrimp scallops Brussels sprouts   Darlene exceptional knowledge every single dish gave great description every dish   She told local brunch Saturday sundays sounds excellent   definitely back most likely brunch  <EOR> Came brunch unlimited mimosas variety flavored! strawberry basil amazing! brunch all eat small plates gives chance try little bit everything  some firsts before   the Oyster Taco Peruvian Shrimp Grits Churro Tots voted owners Top Chef!

Most disappointing experience Las Vegas trip  would highly recommend going anywhere else  even cheapo food court nearby  Don't waste your time  <EOR> This place amazing! food wonderful although some better others service generally very nice  price fix menu a great option   parents 21st birthday never experienced such wonderful food  First appetizers sampler which since gluten intolerant altered   contained two plantain empanadas most exquisite thing ever eaten life green corn tamale  sweet just wonderfully delicious  Then came dinner HUGE perfectly cooked portion premium grade steak small fresh field salad mole aoli  Divine  Then dessert most rich wonderful gluten free chocolate cake ever  vanilla bean ice cream  place amazing  would recommend place those gluten intolerance because its amazing  But skip shrimp  <EOR> My friend ordered two different plates tacos absolutely delicious! atmosphere restaurant fun laid back overlooks beach pool  would highly recommend restaurant anyone staying Mandalay Bay  margaritas also delicious  little pricey but overly comparison Las Vegas general  <EOR> 08 08 2017  We met some relatives dinner evening  excited try place because remember seeing two chefs TV    We sat down wait served chips salsa  Additionally ordered homemade guacamole queso fundido  guacamole very yummy  the avocado creamy fresh!  queso fundido came three small flour tortillas cheesy stringy yummy goodness  make your own mini quesadillas appetizer    Little O Kid's Bean Cheese Burrito fruit side watermelon lemonade  burrito made black beans refried beans  burrito good size least size hand  watermelon lemonade lemonade watermelon syrup liking she switched big sister    H Kid's Quesadilla fruit side strawberry lemonade  quesadilla simple small side  But she also full all chips salsa queso fundido perfect meal her    CONFESSION many chips salsa guacamole queso fundido well stuck two appetizers  grilled octopus grilled elote Mexican corn  for meal    The grilled octopus cooked well over done tender  But wasn't fond seasoning flavors had  ended dipping hubby's crema came taquitos    The elote Mexican corn grilled good seasoning  wish more mayo cheese though     Hubby also ate many chips salsa he brisket taquitos  taquitos flavorful but sauce served over thick flavor overwhelming  reminded enchilada sauce  Then made taquitos soggy  Hubby sad  meal came side black beans rice  usually sample but said earlier ate many chips even so  LOL!   Our server Rachel very attentive patient group arrived shifts before complete party 7  water glasses never empty gentleman waiter did job very well    I would definitely come back chips salsa guacamole queso fundido  <EOR> Excellent customer service ! group 9 came eat Friday 12pm forgotten brunch bottomless mimosas only served Saturday Sunday  only did brunch Friday but also accommodated bottomless mimosas ! waitress Tiffany perfect  Made sure always taken care for  Also big thanks chef Mike agreeing accommodate us  Food delicious!

Amber K  suggested try good reviews Yelp since area said 'why not?'  walked quickly seated attended promptly waiter Lars remainder night   decided try soft shell crab tostada appetizer roll grilled mahi mahi tacos main entree   food very nice Lars also hooked some habanero salsa chips between each course meal   finished off night Mexican banana split which consisted mexican chocolate pineapple raspberry ice cream topped off little bit coconut   Overall food delish left sastified   Also just being locals Lars signed Border Grill VIP card which gave VIP locals myself 15% off bill every time rolled into Border anything outside happy hour   Good night?  think so   back soon try many other options available Border Grill! <EOR> Sooooo super disappointed meal  watched Two Hot Tamales TV years when could only find them PBS   pretty excited chance dine restaurants    My first issue property itself there's no restroom restaurant   only wanted wash hands more inconvenient trek down flight stairs out casino    minimum should sanitizer dispenser available   just hope staff some place more convenient frequent hand washing   Gross    Then service just so so   single refill during meal ask it!   Even then waitress took another 'forever' honor request   She came just heading bar myself    All could forgiven food remotely intriguing   But wasn't   guacamole some funky twangy creamy action going on   trued doctoring tomatillo sauce  friend's grilled fish tacos over cooked served some stale tortillas   Other flavors leaned towards bland   other companion salt carnitas   Turns he paid dearly selection  He spent much night throne  chicken quesadillas just 'meh'   better Mexican Tex Mex chains   don't expect much those comparison easily better   Really disappointing  <EOR> I love ! Susan Feniger but seems price gouging Vegas turned place into yawn   Way overrated upscale Mexican but still okay meal if stuck nay trapped Mandalay Bay need eat   I still can't fathom why restaurants away $9 tableside guacamole service cost 50 cents worth ingredients   should just hand over $10 bucks them punch face then tell them keep change   Guac perfectly fine but $9   Crab nachos good sized portion but light crab   Again no surprise given place stingy when comes good ingredients   Carnitas tacos tender succulent but ridiculous $17   literally $2 taco truck tacos   Mango margarita delectable time but memorable   I don't know kids   Maybe old grumpy but don't feel any stingier dough   just want pay gills if food absolutely warrant because going blow mind   Border Grill didn't blow mind much pay check   over it  <EOR> Rachel why keep coming back!

Tip if check free tamale! full didn't take advantage but worth try! <EOR> We initially visited Mandalay Bay aquarium but severe need meal drink  glad used Yelp decided drop by  steak quesadilla very delicious different since use some common cheeses cojito I think   steak nachos weren't bad either  fiance cucumber cocktail mojito  Both very yummy! Overall great experience here  <EOR> Salsa chips pineapple vanilla margarita tamales cilantro chicken carnitas carne asada tacos fish tacos mexican chocolate creme brûlée all super delicious! service great! <EOR> You've least once brunch place   $30 all eat add $6 unlimited mimosas!  also many different areas enjoy your meal inside outside covered patio completely outside pool shaded trees    love any place some patio seating   The brunch food comes small plates try lot different dishes your money's worth   guess best way describe would tapas   really enjoyed shrimp grits   Like   so much three orders them   other favorite chorizo egg tacos   complaint felt some dishes much egg them proportion other ingredients   only take much egg!  But Mexican twist breakfast favorites something really glad tried   The mimosas come different flavors classic orange pomegranite passion fruit   don't skimp them!  come some pretty hefty pour flutes!  You know all honesty don't know if I'd again just because quite bit money spend breakfast but would definitely say least once expereince this! <EOR> The black bean plantain empanadas yummy!! great vegetarian options  <EOR> Stopped lunch some coworkers while attending convention   Yum!  all pleasantly surprised!  Great customer service great food    can't lose   I Baja ceviche really took back Baja California   Spot on   seen Ratatouille?  moment critic took bite ratatouille dish he flashback memory when mom would dish?  me   except took back Carnival cruise took Baja several years ago I also white peach lemonade which delish but more sweet side expected   No complaints really still really good   Some coworkers blood orange lemonade swear talking remainder day    into next day   guess should've ordered one!  My coworkers all ordered different tacos all said much better expected   ordered guacamole share really good too!  expecting something along lines El Torito but significantly better  <EOR> Not expected caliber establishment  service sucked  requested items several occasions received none  ordered shrimp scallop dish  Shrimp over cooked scallops raw  told scoot scallops onto another plate re fire  Totally right  Brought them back still under cooked  Really? Then put super spicy chilis onto plate  almost burnt mouth off  Don't there  better! <EOR> I feel Mexican food joint white people palates but enjoy none less!  good bet if you're looking nice place dinner its good mix laid back fancy   few times tried fish tacos which thoroughly enjoyable but probably worth 23 dollars charge chicken enchiladas which delicious but 26$? But its strip did expect right    also market veggie quesadilla which tasty cheaper good choice if you're vegetarian   Bottom line place worth visit if you're area but probably wouldn't way it   lot reviews seem brunch maybe  where its honest probably deserve 3 5 stars but oh well <EOR> Sat down 11 35   still waiting food 1 03pm  Server sent over manager some weak excuse they're down 1 kitchen wait what?!

Wouldn't come back here  You're better off elsewhere  <EOR> Came brunch lunch last day Vegas  six girls all varying tastes preferences great choice! Mexican food always hit particularly enjoy really pleased when birthday girl suggested it! She'd previous trip Vegas recommended it   We came 11 00 because when started serving lunch  also offer all inclusive brunch small plates but another buffet before long flight home  did order couple appetizers guacamole queso   guac really good chips huge standout  Freshly fried super fresh difficult stop eating  came three types salsa all which good  None particularly spicy but all flavorful   queso bit runny side taste which also made difficult share   I ordered nachos lunch if know you'd expect this  nachos suffered structural issues construction  beans spread all over bottom plate chips top them  Toppings layered top baked chips never stood chance  super soggy time made table  flavor good but mostly picked chips top left sodden bottom layer  added steak nachos very good choice meat hot cooked medium made great addition dish   Other girls tacos  definitely would order next time  Enjoy crispy chips appetizer but don't recommend nachos unless special request re structure  waitress nice but pretty absent don't think type special request would well received although think would done it   We sat patio really nice there! covered fans even when warm outside good option some fresh air  <EOR> Came dinner friend before seeing show Mandalay Bay Events Center  Knowing busy Saturday especially night show made reservation OpenTable  time checked hostess stand  wanted inside seating because eating outside during Vegas summer isn't preferable while dressed show  However wait inside table going 20 30 minutes  Doesn't defeat purpose reservation? Since show reluctantly took patio seating seated immediately   Our server Carmie very nice  She very helpful when asked appetizer recommendations  torn over which ceviche order but she informed could split ceviche order half bit each  Perfect solution  tried Baja Ceviche Tuna Crudo the recommendation Carmie   Ultimately preferred Tuna Crudo  Props recommendation  Because we're locals Carmie suggested sign VIP Club which would 15% off future visits well current visit  Saving money always appreciated   As entree ordered Ropa Vieja off specials menu  braised beef short rib carrot puree mojo crispy yucca  Knowing eating Strip bit worried much short rib I'd $27  Once dish came pleasantly surprised portion  ton short rib  Very tender could pull apart without need knife   Overall good experience but perfect due inability seat inside even though reservation  <EOR> We usually stay Mandalay Bay when we're mood gorging another buffet Border Grill great alternative    really helps Border Grill offers certificates restaurant com    usually use $25 off $50 coupon   very good meal  1 2 price here!

First off bar sticky   a bit gross  Ordered pork dish but brought wrong one   the guy down bar mine    expensive place  really unacceptable    Rather fuss said fine    no offer free drink anything mistake   would nice gesture    The waiter did say someone mistake happened but both fine      He could much better   Overall good good but bit heavy   service total failure <EOR> Way overpriced food which isn't even authentic Mexican restaurant  Mexican food favorite cuisines but restaurant didn't deliver  Food ok but won't recommend won't back  <EOR> I admit walked restaurant many times without blinking never thought needed try food here   coworker wanted eat glad did!

Also tempted give star because saw bartender $12 margarita fricken last call margarita mix  unconscionably  Good few pools beach tho  <EOR> The first time called ahead found closed 10 showed 9 50 hostess few friends hugged chit chatted them while buddy stood there  few minutes later she asks if eat tell am then she says oh well stopped seating 9 45   Let alone fact no manning hostess both stood before she showed started reminiscing friends few minutes before that    Worst economic recession over 50 years started closing early?  So next week  some Filet lobster sauced enchiladas mean food salty if dad eat he'd into Heart Failure  Worse appetizer some little potato food thing size quarter two shrimp  worth it!

I would definitely back! <EOR> I love Border Grill   Every time visit LV brunch   give 5 stars overall experience because when something usually REALLY it    overall rating others though would probably give 4 stars       At $34 99 plus $10 unlimited mimosas think brunch expensive but dollars delivers good value    expect spend 2 3 hours being served small plates trying new old flavors mimosas     food mimosa menu constantly changing if something really pretty much keep ordering until full   couple years ago grapefruit mimosa good stopped eating could drink more them!  Champagne grapefruit honey little gin    very good    good experimented until recipe down myself    I don't eat beef chicken pork options bit limited but said when hit mark something fantastic SEASONAL FRESH FRUIT SALAD housemade granola * lime zest * cayenne yogurt * buñelo cone     only flavors but different textures dish perfect      The beauty small plates if don't something just stop eating something else    Even though  menu changes may serve something really liked previously fun try new dishes take time savor rate them  <EOR> You cannot foo foo Mexican food taste real Mexican food   bout cheddar cheese chicken nachos instead feta cheese   eats crumbly cheese instead melted cheese nachos!?  know rich people look crap taste crap fashionable but when heard really good Mexican food restaurant  expected   did nail high end price though $90 2 nasty dishes $7 Corona   If want good Mexican food don't even Taco Bell would better   However benefit inside Mandalay Bay play Blackjack throw win your money back wasted dump  <EOR> Unfortunately agree all so so reviews  sister dined Saturday evening  Although waiter quite attentive meal just cost   We ordered mole chicken Kobe beef tacos  split things often great did kitchen very appreciated  Both delicious items but worth charged? No  margaritas which quite tasty however just don't think whole meal worth over $100  <EOR> Great modern mexican food  Really tasty!! Gluten free options clearly identified regular menu along few items which also made g f request   Nice location inside Mandalay Bay outdoor terrace well  <EOR> Took family spring break looking forward some good Mexican food  Decent decor but waiter service mediocre well food   shredded pork cold paid quite disappointing   Monday thinking reason but shouldn't excuse Vegas caliber restaurant right     Hope all better service food but no desire return  <EOR> Got guacamole good but $9  little over cup  nachos good amount steak but nachos bottom mushy  nachos top good   husband burger said very good cooked perfect  daughter veggie quesadillas good  Server attentive friendly  <EOR> We ate when came Vegas without much spending money  really wanted try sounded best place eat area  ended drinking water eating chips many dipping sauces then splitting Tamale Sampler  felt bad waitress left nice tip  could sense she mentally rolling eyes when she heard would have  Next time all out!

The hostess' front very scattered overall restaurant just seemed poorly run   server however very friendly great customer service   told kitchen backed apologized getting little corn tamales  ordered gaucamole chips guac very good  chips salsa also quite good    Food otherwise very subpar but believe secondary busy chaotic restaurant was  heard brunch fantastic maybe try next time but dinner very mediocre  order fish tacos literally killed fish overcooked dry flavorless  Same thing green rice which dry kept taking gulps water between bites  couldn't even save rice salsa guac    Would definitely come back dinner    Strip prices bad food? no thanks!
