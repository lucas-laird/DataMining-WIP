I just love sushi biased when comes sushi restaurants however Oyshi Sushi new fave town! Ambiance beautiful big Japanese mural private room lovely look at   Service excellent food delicious price reasonable   Highly recommended!! <EOR> Starting become fond place  Always treated great service great food! Spicy Tuna Roll cant miss on! pot stickers unique taste really mind blowing sauce! <EOR> Loved vibe energy restaurant  really busy when but didn't wait long food drinks  Food coming fast steady  Cajun albacore must have  menu very diverse something everyone  back sure! <EOR> We came recommendation friend lives Vegas mentioning wanting Nobu dinner  I'm NY Nobu location   decor adequate but music really odd restaurant first songs heard eating pussy many songs n word  expect while club but while eating? Completely tasteless!   The service lacking but worst seen  point waitress came over check amount wine left bottle then set down walked away even though two glasses empty! food came very slowly but  typical all you can eat place where want fill between courses order less    The food itself extremely disappointing  Most rolls ingredients never real sushi cream cheese cheddar cheese other odd things  presented attractively but drenched cream sauces ones fried disgustingly greasy  fish fresh enough but even close quality used to    I guess if you've never really high quality sushi might enjoy place judging other reviewers but if appreciate only best sushi you'll probably want skip Oyshi  definitely won't back! <EOR> Oyshi Japanese delicious indeed place delicious  used work nearby place would default dinner spot when tired really town  food fresh prices reasonable  Service excellent    I've never anything did enjoy  atmosphere nice date  also great all you can eat set price which includes everything menu except sashimi    Maybe sentimental but now don't live area anymore sometimes find myself craving sushi here    If you're looking food off strip away traffic tourists place definitely worth checking out  far Strip  <EOR> Rice undercooked  Seriously handle rice living yet no knew?  salmon old  Disappointing  would've 808 Sushi but don't open lunch Sundays      next time stick 808 Sushi  <EOR> We back! Valentine's dinner Oyshi sounded good went  When ran into bunch people knew  Lots friends regulars there   Our server Steven maybe spelled Stephen very nice paid special attention started real conversations UNLV stuff   There only 2 re order ask couple things ordered same when big group but wasn't big deal because since only 2 full way faster glad use digestion breaks between eating   The creme brulee divine always  just SAD only give 1 dessert when order AYCE All Eat sushi  want AYCE creme brulee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And still came home smelling food  LOL    #foodcrew <EOR> Probably won't coming again  Fish rolls just weren't fresh flavorful  don't offer 1 2 rolls  <EOR> the hostess rude service over all extremely poor  took over 1 1 2 eat lunch  did lunch specials available nor did mochi ice cream  customers next order gyozas did I  sat down but still received food before us  Also order ice cream parfait took least 15+ minutes receive it  would recommend eating here! <EOR> Really bad service  ate AYCE wait almost 10 min between orders  watch verities different sushi rolls going other tables while sucked chop stick  Even apologized same thing happened  tired asked check surprise forgot bring check also  ended going them money paid register  Manager doing absolutely nothing didn't even bothered offer apology   Tip people wants restaurant sure already full  <EOR> The ambiance very nice but little pricier looking pay especially all u eat sushi  Its bad place eat lends itself groups well  But say only once never needed back  <EOR> We tried Oyshi recommendation Renoite transplant lives Vegas now expecting decent ayce sushi much ones Reno    not even close     Sushi The sushi just ok   fish wasn't super fresh some cuts fish thin cut poorly falling apart   Most rolls same notes lots imitation crab meat mixture all tasted same     Appetizers I'm fanatic raw oysters small Pacific oysters bit warm side very bland tasting flavorless even siracha sauce dotted it   tasted though bad rinsed tap water even shell oyster served lacked oyster liquor which isn't good sign   Needless say only able eat 1 4 ordered struggle keep down   eaten raw oysters jar raw oysters came pretty close that   told wait staff oysters bit off she replied  odd they're usually    manager attentive came table see if wanted more oysters stating wasn't enough sauce previous order why tasted way  If oysters fresh why would need drown sauce ?  The sweet shrimp side fried heads amaebi sweet which means weren't fresh   shrimp heads weren't prepared properly not fried well tough bite through it   After having oyster amaebi passed uni because if can't other 2 right there's no way going try uni needs super fresh   They pretty busy Tuesday night maybe just high expectations sushi maybe just Sushi chef training but if your your jonesing some great sushi place isn't you  <EOR> Generally speaking craves sushi  However find myself craving sushi Oyshi   taste presentation everything ever ordered amazing  You've definitely gotta try Japanese Lasagna Roll!    Great atmosphere  Great food  Great price  <EOR> Yummy! Love Seduction lobster roll    wait really long but food good however crunch roll just alright <EOR> My server tonight Odi! She incredibly attentive caring needs  When sat down she did outstanding job explaining menu checked consistently  If happen stop Oyshi your expecting quality service would recommend Odi plus she most contagious smile ever Oyshi truly best deal town your money unlimited kitchen sushi included All Eat menu  Definitely must list <EOR> AYCE Sushi! Service great   Sushi good AYCE standards   My picks if you're doing AYCE Seaweed Salad pretty standard kind small Tempura GOOD!  Agedashi Tofu good flavor but wasn't best had  MOCHI ICE CREAM only choose dessert definitely choose this!! Sunrise Roll nice spicy flavor  Wait staff really good handling large party 16   Kept track most orders checked often  <EOR> I dined first time last week   town visiting some friends family place large group   read reviews thought would great place try  Especially $21 all you can eat sushi lunch   The servers prompt taking orders   table second place orders thought would great service   NOT!  ordered cucumber salad appetizer three sushi rolls rattlesnake roll crunchy scallop yellowtail trio    Well took OVER 30 minutes cucumber salad arrive   say something TWICE server before came out   time appetizer just everyone else group already received eaten sushi rolls   Why did little cucumber salad take long arrive? Did plant seed grow cucumber?  brother in law sitting next even sushi roll before appetizer   strike one!  Now strike two remind server hadn't received sushi rolls   everyone else pretty much finished rolls   even reminded still took another 25 minutes rolls Yes timing everything    Strike three sushi rolls  Luckily wasn't dying starvation because some others group able share rolls able eat few pieces while waiting mine  thing noticed most specialty rolls stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over  don't mind sauce its great dragon rolls   But caused everything taste EXACT same   sauce SWEET   really killed individual flavors fresh ingredients inside each roll   brother couldn't stomach it   when finally rolls two rolls crunchy scallop rattlesnake DRENCHED sweet sauce   yellowtail trio roll nasty  tasted sour marinated fish vinegar something!  If sweet sushi rolls then place you   However never set foot place again! <EOR> Really good food  AYCE available  Only thing place almost always packed quite loud inside  <EOR> Visited 12 19 09 very awesome all eat $26   great time   visited recommendation others Yelp   Oyshi now list every time we're Vegas   Thanks Yelp! <EOR> Excellent quality sushi   garlic yellowtail tuna cajun Albacore   Very very good   Fast accurate attentive staff   Recommend anyone side town come enjoy atmosphere top quality sushi   Will return sure  <EOR> Sucks  fresh !! not Japanese style all  super Slow !!

Service pretty good but could bit erratic   always came refill drinks check take additional orders   It saddens journey Oyshi far but willing travel distance value quality offer  <EOR> I cannot say enough Oyshi sushi excellent selection never ending  highly recommend anyone finds themselves Las Vegas time enjoy some best sushi around  <EOR> When comes All Eat Sushi very careful  Low volume restaurants able cycle through fish making offerings fresh   good news Oyshi always busy allowing them offer fresh sushi every night week   2 private rooms large dining room extended sushi bar lot seating   highly recommend sushi bar! <EOR> A pretty good AYCE sushi restaurant  Rolls good lot great options if anyone doesn't sushi  Sometimes bit wait seated some waiting rolls   kids meal outstanding!! <EOR> I never come back place again   takes 25 minutes your first plate sushi another 20 next plate  take forever your orders   felt rush order quick hurry it   horrible happen 4 hours ago am still mad   Plus sushi worth wait   only thing say really egg rolls   don't recommend place   <EOR> I just love when AYCE sushi places only serve sushi but all different tapas style appetizers! Dinner priced $26 95   Service usually very good  Last time wait 20 mins table it little busy waiter did come around much hoped for  water teas never refilled without asking  But other times gone prior service fine   When comes sushi Oyshi ah better  spicy tuna mushy  spicy tuna when tuna cut into chucks then mixed spicy mayo  quite disappointed that  salmon nigiri fresh quite tasty though  try stay away rolls because huge become quite full roll    Whenever find myself Oyshi tend order few nigiris then ransack appetizer menu! lol  love steak  comes sizziling top cabbage onions  also shrimp vegetable tempura bacon wrapped asparagus scallop poppers oysters agedashi tofu etc   Oyshi used favorite mine AYCE sushi but discovering Island Sushi    don't know if back Oyshi  <EOR> I've going sushi restaurant little over 4years  remember place because where first date Valentines Day  opinions restaurant consistent within several years  love place  eat few times month because can't enough food! Some reviewers may complain service few exceptions service amazing  thing admire most restaurant service isn't limited just servers but owner running around serving people well  going long owner recognizes each time!   Food am obsessed Ian's Special Roll  multiple layers flavor goodness!   Things Try Snow Mountain roll Salmon Lover Tiger Roll Surf Turf appetizer Ahi poke Baked Mussels Grilled Asparagus Shrimp all sushi fish desire  Vanilla Parfait dessert pretty amazing too    I usually look forward Uni Oysters but reason why 4 stars 5 because times where available  really puts damper entire meal  doesn't want money's worth!   Overall great experience! When anyone comes into town first place take them all love much do! pretty amazing! tried many sushi restaurants state none compares sushi place Vegas! <EOR> When friend Vegas recommended eating All you can eat sushi place first thing thought Todai  NO THANK YOU!  But $21 lunch order ANYTHING except drinks  Man dined kings queens eating everything could  only thing yellowtail nigiri usually favorite mine pinkish color? huh?

Snow Mountain roll all baked stuff good tuna salmon nigiri really good  don't drench sauce all over cover quality which love   Desserts creme brulee pretty good  4 stars Mochi exactly mochi icecreams grocery store  4 stars Green tea icecream didn't but heard decent I think just liked fact included all u can eat package   Would DEFINITELY recommend!!!!!

Must AYCE won't regret   Price good selection amazing  Always busy  Call ahead table reservation plus  Friendly staff all around  Only downfall takes while sushi table place order  big first order  <EOR> Gave place shot because friends always raving it  hostess friendly  sat only two open seats bar  No greeting anything left 8 minutes awkward waiting  defense extremely busy  Maybe give another try when slammed   <EOR> While place nice close home huge fan sushi  always start spicy tuna before pointing handful other rolls menu  While course ate spicy tuna thought may ordered sweet tuna   Because only ordered more roll shrimp tempura didn't wow factor either  Reasonably priced nice location southwest area but nothing rave about  <EOR> A friend mine introduced place last year  selling point real Japanese people food  funny thing staff owners 90% Korean   Does matter way? Masa Jiro may care much but AYCE standards best sushi town best la carte Naked Fish  Service okay but gets little hectic when restaurant full capacity  No big deal  added bizarre surprise pint sized creme brulee greatest ever had  If resist cramming your stomach more roll sure end meal it  <EOR> This use favorite sushi place would earned 5 stars  However last two times gone daughter disappointed   only did take FOREVER orders but food quality grown accustom Oyshi   Some sushi tasted previously frozen  fresh all   hoping just blip time opened second location  otherwise find another place call favorite sushi place   <EOR> I came lunch  weren't much people  probably 3 tables besides us  food coming fast while sister waited 30 minutes until food started coming    Really slowly  guessing because look college students typically don't tip well  When orders started slowly come kept mixing food table next ours vice versa entire time  took hour finally 5 orders salmon eel yellow tail nigiri    Well never coming back super bad service received  <EOR> I usually come Fridays Saturdays service great foods great waiting time may long but hostess pretty nice updates when wait time gotten shorter  would recommend eating here  <EOR> Love affair baked roll favorite well Asian skirt sizzling plate  All eat $26 all delish  Don't forget order appetizers dessert all eat!

I've before sushi wasnt good but decided give another shot  Bad idea! lunch break ordered two rolls there  five sushi chefs  wasn't even busy! Took thirty minutes order right sushi just plain messy   should've gone Kobe down street  <EOR> We moved into neighborhood few months ago Oyshi several times  miso soup tempura veggies delicious  overall some best sushi had  only reason didn't give 5 star review because shrimp aren't fried order rolls  tiger roll usually favs but when shrimp soggy  <EOR> I come sushi when craving solid AYCE menu lot raw fish options  find if sit sushi bar just ask chefs your order menu very stringent happy really anything ask for  found service waitress pretty bad  drink only refilled once she very inattentive  Quality fish always good never problem besides full leave  other options also very good always order seaweed salad seared ribeye steak which comes sizzling hot pan cabbage onions great option AYCE menu those love surf turf  say food great price place only getting 4 value which something look for  But service lacking  Still worth trip! <EOR> I regular location over 5 years   quality service declined steadily over years especially hostess position   people hire absolute laziest seem more interested networking providing actual service   checking in host being told 20 minute wait watched people arrived seated   30 minutes asked possible everyone seated before me?  hosted blamed manager took name but never added wait list   seems whenever '20 minute wait' even though plenty empty tables   food AWESOME once ONLY reason keep going back  <EOR> The best AYCE sushi place  Never disappoints  nuclear bomb amazing  fish fresh  Even if don't sushi ribeye steak skirt steak many choices  staff always friendly  If still room try parfait cream brle  <EOR> My husband new favorite place town  live Summerlin still drive Southwest side town sushi   Portions AYCE would fool you  Sushi pieces generous balls rice enormous  appetizers good try Grilled beef asparagus!

<EOR> My husband ate lunch all eat option  nice variety sushi rolls various appetizers side dish options choose from  atmosphere upscale pleasant  server nice brought food quickly  Everything ordered delicious  Would definitely recommend restaurant all eat sushi  <EOR> It saddens write review because really used Oyshi  excited when first opened weren't any sushi restaurants nearby  came often really enjoyed it  time noticed changes staff service suffered  also busier thus orders taking way long    The food always remained pretty good in opinion   But good food doesn't bad service bad experience   The good news another location Sahara which farther away but less busy usually better service  <EOR> Oyshi definitely most expansive AYCE selections Vegas  Lots appetizers also included favorite being Surf Turf  fish always very fresh special rolls inventive delicious! few reviews specifically mention Monster Roll  but find very difficult eat due size  favorites Sunrise Roll Hawaiian Roll    I would avoid coming during lunch dinner rush unless you're sitting counter though   service tends really really slow when they're busy sometimes items order forgotten  very busy just keep mind    Oyshi far best sushi restaurant southwest side despite some slow table service during busiest hours some sloppy sushi making when extremely busy during weekend dinners definitely continue frequent when mood sushi   Oh sure save room dessert Green Tea Tiramisu amazing! <EOR> Variety versus Service headliner place   The menu excellent mean many choices fact many second visit think only tried eight items  Quality freshness seafood outstanding them roll sushi sashimi   The stand outs are Miso soup Ahi Poke Shrimp tempura Calamari Surf Turf Eel Avocado Creme Brulee     food four stars hands down   Now service most accommodating afraid say  Some cons last visit waiter forgot three orders Calamari reminded waited good twenty minutes grave sin customer service definitely  pros greeted seated very quickly drinks refilled readily appreciated fact waiter apologized making wait calamaris  end would give them three stars believe could better following order  <EOR> I'm going preface saying fan sushi but group friends are  Luckily Oyshi lot options aren't sushi large selections sizzling plates teriyaki like  don't even know got some kind chicken skewer beef wrapped asparagus entree menu  Both pretty tasty though wish more beef asparagus  Most everyone else AYCE sushi seemed love every dish came out  place trendy vibe eclectic mix top 40 music playing everything plated beautifully  service amazing prices really good wound feeling really special occasion when all said done  definitely recommend Oyshi! <EOR> If possible give no stars Oyshi would one  thought would give place second try being few years since first went  host quoted 30 minute wait but sat table pretty quickly  asked server Ploi if half rolls she did say would bar eating AYCE which did mention girlfriend myself both doing AYCE also let know girlfriend allergic avocado  first order consisted few appetizers but wait ridiculous 15 minutes passed nothing came while happening party 4 just sat next food less 5 minutes  Ploi walked asked if wanted order any more getting impatient decided order some rolls asked if half rolls she mentioned would sat bar AYCE which disregarded statement she made when first asked half rolls  Which stupid why only half rolls bar  Anyways put orders those came pretty quick messed couple salmon nigiri ordered 3 orders but only gave 2  40 minutes appetizers finally came but ordered 3 orders shrimp tempura only gave 1 order noticed kitchen coming plate fulls shrimp tempura every other table besides ours keep reminding food runners ordered more received  Another thing noted food runner gave rainbow roll did order which avocado girlfriend highly allergic avocado dont know why didn't sure going right table  More time passed made few more orders rolls appetizers but those took another 30 minutes tables next keep getting food right away  sorry but perception wise  okay  still hungry but did want wait another 30 minutes orders come  returning Oyshi  sushi places very volume chinatown more efficient running food servers better sense urgency  returning Oyshi  <EOR> A friend LV resident brought group here   blown away 1st time  $25 AYCE Sushi?!?! everything menu except sashimi    Food service great time   But 2nd visit longer wait prices gone quality down   all horrible stomach aches dehydration hours after   great deal but you'll pay price  <EOR> We very disappointed first visit restaurant  waited nearly 25 minutes seated when open tables scattered throughout place  Wine served tiny glasses beer served warm ones  Half orders executed improperly  temperature restaurant warm table small party  server checked watch several times while taking various orders  awful experience  <EOR> Great all you can eat deal! Food very good friendly staff  Highly recommend! <EOR> For $21 lunch $26 dinner indulge all eat sushi sides  difference between lunch dinner lunch excludes oysters something else list front menu  Aside indulge any roll hot item  Sashimi's off limits    Keep mind rolls regular priced run $13 each might well pay $26 ayce option sample much feel like    unless you're those freaks eat roll satisfied      The catch rolls suspected tons rice  roll loaded felt body refusing chew any more it  sushi another story amount rice fair  Oh sidenote you're charged regular price anything remove fail consume rice from    It seems best way fill without tapping early focus hot items sushi fill surf turf calamari ahi poke salad pick maybe two rolls sound good deny yourself them  could roll crazy fight yourself chew    There very tempting dessert options which you're limited sad! Bring friends share all four  mochi mango raspberry tiny but imagine refreshing treat  creme brulee friend green tiramisu  Both absolutely wonderful  green tiramisu first exciting eat  Creamy yet subtle yet sweet    The only qualm experience day when sushi kitchen hopelessly backed up  All hot food came quickly but sushi took felt forever appear  became issue friends didn't order hot food waited well over hour eat anything    Luckily two hour ordering limit applied else would fishy deal! <EOR> If wasn't stubborn friend would gotten earlier avoided long wait   friend said take 95 take 95 blah blah blah   Even waiter said take 215 friend INSISTED taking 95   waiter probably said whatever dude lost then wait longer your friends kick your ass before eat delicious buffet    another friend looked Oyshi Sushi himself found should take 215 did all frustrated driving 15 fwy traffic   In any case waiting getting seated table straight ordering all you can eat which includes 2 uni sea urchin pieces 2 amaebi raw sweet shrimp pieces 4 raw oysters   Yep there's limit those but must understand aren't many other places would even give premium sushi pieces   Just note uni slightly less fresh before   any case addition fresh delicious sushi   salmon yellowtail albacore halibut sushis great plus don't give much rice sushi other places   rib eye teriyaki also excellent dish have   tempura also very good   dessert all strawberry mochi ice cream which very good   All $25 per person   bad all   I only mention couple cons 1 dessert limit each person   However all ice cream want since considered dessert items   Plus find just strange place huge yet waste much space put tiny little tables center when bigger tables accommodate more people   Last con    service   bit slow   really busy night but still surprised took more 15 mins take raw food   2 hr limit but don't think pushed limit all much  <EOR> There's no other food say could every single day   much sushi choices ever tired eating it?! Seriously  When first discovered place enamored flavor service told every single person looking good place eat local tourist Oyshi Sushi AYCE!  I'm big fan nigiri highly recommend nigiri because ratio fish rice 80 20  fish use very fresh use huge slice! OMG! top list nigiri Cajun albacore salmon eel! every time   Also highly recommended Love Affair Salmon Lover Sunrise Red Dragon   appetizers awesome well but ones stick most some sushi bars don't are Surf Turf Potato Croquette grilled beef asparagus Unagi eel bowl! Mmmmm!  They also dinner reservations if large party coming  VIP rooms accommodate large parties if call ahead   sat VIP rooms chairs extra comfortable  dining area near entrance huge mural gives place feel vibe  If speak sushi chefs they're pretty funny too! if you're cool waiting little bit seated your Oyshi on! <EOR> I dozen times probably return  really quality sushi extensive selection appetizers  quality service however leaves MUCH desired  takes average 30 minutes sushi your table time order it  totally ruins flow dinner  Take today example  server came table 30 minutes taking order two dishes hands asked Did order Dynamite Roll Lobster Fair? which replied don't remember  long ago but take whatever you're willing give me  Good sushi  Nice staff  Inefficient business  <EOR> This place never lets down quality sushi always tastes amazing even baked dishes worth trip  last time tried AYCE worth money if hungry enough! <EOR> Dislike!!!! don't even know why even bother coming oyshi's anymore  gave them many chances swear last straw  think given many chances because close house    Oyshi problem waiting damn Long  order   1 45pm didn't order til 2pm  food order came 2 40pm  talk annoying getting super impatient  feel waiters talk much more co workers don't even care many hungry people there  top off never ask drink refills  never once cup coke refilled  ridiculous tell you  usually stuff myself good amount sushi but buy waiting waiting hunger just away    sushi wise alright!! greatest fish tasted  could better   only thing good say oyshi ice cream parfait creme brle dessert    I never back again  unless dinner gets paid for!!! otherwise just another disappointment  <EOR> So disappointed!  Went place lunch nd felt uncomfortable  asked seated bar bc alone nd pregnant thought good see handle food beside expected fun nd fast  did all u eat  Waited 30min app gyoza  chefs never said hi even looked direction care happiness  always greeted bar sushi bar least do  chef made silly comment soon arrived bar knew wrong place  4 different kind rolls would only came back 1 maniac roll only spice no sweet sauce fake crabmeat  Everything else just blah blah blah  service polite but slow nd confused  never refill water  management sushi chef seems kiss good looking well dressed ppl ass  Everyone else mistreated including myself  worse place ever been  would never come back once won't put best clothes just someone treat respect  Besides 1 single good roll??? Forget it  would prefer drive 808 sushi that' fancy but better quality sushi way better service    first roll monster every single piece fell apart when trying eat it  every single roll ugly tasteless except super sweet sauce super sweet crabmeat combination put everything  My experience place lasted around 1 1 2hour bc would take between 25 35 min every order  Plus 20min check  end say only good thing place half order     all  <EOR> This place good if u want easy all eat sushi restaurant  quality fish all eat kind not best but nice layout big room back large parties <EOR> After reading all great reviews came high expectations  all eat sushi  took 30 minutes receive each order  waiter didn't bother check unless he food deliver  Sushi warm  way better sushi other places then we're served Oyshi  oysters we're only 2 per customer  don't expect all eat oysters  stayed hour 45 minutes Oyshi  Half time just sat looking around waiter come refill drinks  best thing menu we're baked mussels  <EOR> This place amazing whenever order all eat tell waitress order favorite amazing job if seat bar chef ED does amazing rolls menu thank chef ED mucho spicy roll !! <EOR> We late lunch   place wasn't crowded yet service bit slow   seated sushi bar but sushi chefs seem engrossed work wait catch eye put more orders in   Good thing some kind shift change newer chef least asked once if wanted order more     As food started off nigiri sushi then moved specialty rolls   quickly realized fish wasn't 100% fresh when laying simple bare nigiri sushi   However concoct good sauces compose interesting rolls maybe compensate lesser quality fish    The weird thing noticed when ordered unagi    all other sushi bars unagi broiled few minutes before making into sushi give nice caramelization   skip while unagi seems slightly warm crispy flavor bit muted I think broiling intensifies flavor    guess next time ask them extra crispy   <EOR> It seems quality dropped service sushi  theory friend just gets bad peak times  Lunch dinner time weekends holidays   Understaffed maybe?   Our ahi poke seemed less Fresh  shrimp tempura seemed rushed fully fried  Sushi rolls took forrreevvver come out  seems creme brle serving gets smaller each time visit  <EOR> While visiting cousin Las Vegas decided try Oyshi Sushi   atmosphere nice presentations creative  great variety rolls well decent prices  all eat sushi menu perfection!  only downside only used imitation crab meat instead real crab meat  <EOR> I girlfriend brother girlfriends birthday last year  place pretty neat if ask me  restaurant nice plenty open space good music playing   We all eat menu disappointed  only few sections menu included all eat price but other majority menu free range  appetizers desserts countless rolls entrees place really feast eyes stomach   But only downside there's only much sushi eat before just gets gross  few appetizers 3 4 different rolls ready call night  experiences other sushi restaurants place mediocre  fish could fresher but guessing All Eat staple menu whatever fish throw roll   This place cool but long drive mediocre cuisine left wanting more sushi restaurant just looks  I'd back just wouldn't all eat offering again  <EOR> Well worth price delicious  location several times  Never disappointed  always AYCE  More fairly priced  $23 lunch $28 dinner  EJ server attentive helpful along assisting staff  Great timing   My typical order mussels potato croquettes vegetable tempura oysters sea urchin uni masago heart attack roll creme brle   Yes come eat! boyfriend usually gets down least 4 rolls plus AYCE appetizers which tally far more $28  Usually hear hip hop playing which if don't combo AYCE hip hop stay home   [no wants hear whine music selection] Just know you're missing out  They're open late night owls too  Check hours  continue enjoy place  <EOR> My boyfriend absolutely loves place  He's really into AYCE sushi places but he LOVES one  Me?

Love Affair shrimp tempura roll yum yum lobster crunch flakes  Scrumptious!  5 Overall Satisfactory  lot things wanted try but full  would give place another shot  <EOR> The sushi good! Ever since left craving sushi  definitely coming back ASAP   My only complaint wait while seated when waiters just standing around but pretty friendly patient newcomer sushi myself <EOR> This restaurant used okay both food wise service wise  sure what's going days but service isn't good used be  half restaurant empty making wait 10 min  Why? always tell myself last time when come here  time am 100% positive last time here  MANY other GOOD aye sushi places  suggest try them here <EOR> Just superb  Vince waiter did excellent job attending explaining AYCE menu works  place sushi  <EOR> Compared other sushi joints Las Vegas area would rather somewhere else  vibe ok good spacious restaurant loud music  But if you're into kind thing ahead    Food wise could cut back rice  rice put little much  judge sushi joint Unagi eel impress unagi here  little cold    Overall ok just okay <EOR> My daughter first stop when coming Las Vegas   Never disappoints   Staff chef's food dynamite   Making reservation suggested because fills fast but sitting bar watch chef's prepare your rolls sped quality   The all eat key   Thanks once again see next year  <EOR> All eat sushi known for  sushi good some best Vegas  location seems much quicker cleaner then others  bit over priced overall good value  <EOR> Went girl lunch HORRIBLE dining experience   worked restaurant industry over 7 years awhile since such horrible service food     When walked no host hostess greet seat us   waiting 2 minutes decided seat ourselves sushi bar   restaurant packed but decent lunch crowd sunday   Numerous servers passed pretty much ignored us   top 4 sushi chefs behind counter did acknowledge all   Probably 5 minutes manager came asked if would something drink   took probably least another 5 minutes grab waters   placing order took another 15 20 minutes any sushi ordered   Talking server perspective hard sushi??? no cooking involved!  When finally order very disappointed   quality fish very subpar portions very small price    All all restaurant itself nice nice ambiance but customer service quality servers sushi chefs waaaaayy below average   would recommend going here!! <EOR> WOW!!! Love place! favorite salmon skin salad all all eat option  More bang your buck! staff polite very attentive  place pretty much pack come early  <EOR> The sushi great!  fresh great preserntation   If both traditional contemporary sushi place go    recommend getting all eat selection   order appetizers rolls hot food dessert   $26 00 plus tip tax grea value   also private room small parties  <EOR> Omg   after all time passed am back again   same problem exists long wait seated even if came dinner time already  taking long seated only 2 us   frustrating disappointing  if guys thinking coming over sure bring lot patience! tell food nothing extra ordinary eithet  only reason am back because thought service changed  Double thumbs down again sad  <EOR> Used eat few years ago And must honest them much used much better Now they're okay Food okay Service Soso <EOR> I guess depends kind Japanese food want   Their rolls?  Fantastic   heart rolls volcano rolls strong flavor soft textures   However    nigiri only so so   I'd come if just want wild ROLLS   That being said service excellent   really try hard satisfy your needs here   atmosphere decor nice too  <EOR> Great service great food  First time Oyshi's tonight! All eat ice cream! Hell yeah <EOR> Hmmm   I planning lose AYCE sushi virginity Ms  Goyemon but two hour wait instead opted next girl available named Ms  Oyshi    I'd rather think didn't all way still saving myself former     For 26 bucks think definitely line Sushi Goyemon but happened company some friends well able some perspective proceeded first time navigating la carte ordering feeding frenzy   first few speed bumps which caught eye some ground rules listed menu 1  No sashimi only order oysters 4 pieces uni sweet shrimp allowed   fair enough  2  No excess rice shall allowed remain uneaten plate otherwise order counted extra final bill    have people discarding rice into large pile assembling massive sculptured mountain rice?  rice used prepare sushi highly variable quality soft firm mixed throughout various rounds ordering only motivated concoct creative methods disposing rice hiding tea jar breaking into tiny grains scattering across plate create illusion clean plate borrow technique friend disliked rice during early childhood placing said rice into mouth going bathroom dispose toilet trash    course none done but tempting nonetheless   3   Any orders which unfinished general counted extra orders final bill   this adhered yet strangely enough receiving final round food a modest 2 3 rolls server waited when rubbing bellies chimes two more rolls coming! none any idea where phantom rolls coming she then replies snarky shrug take them off your order if she doing favor    pure shenanigans  4  jalapeno poppers appetizer menu allowed included amongst AYCE orders    what kind crazy logic this?  Wouldn't good strategy fill your customers heartburn due fatty spicy cream cheese richness slow down intake much much more expensive items?  greatest jalapeno poppers history appetizers missed business opportunity    don't even jalapeno poppers but almost willing  eat just because condition existed   THE MEAL  The appetizers ahi poke spicy sashimi salad miso soup poke might well unseasoned sashimi whereas sashimi salad overdressed nearly drowning chili vinaigrette miso soup surprisingly overly salty anticipated but ended being surprise highlight meal   The big three uni raw oysters sweet shrimp    not exceedingly fresh but no risk possible food poisoning although oysters watered down quality them    only tasted good since specifically paid for   The nigiri sampled surfer clam spanish mackerel japanese yellowtail few other standards    there definitely something couldn't put finger but level freshness just seemed 1 level below would expect if ordered same items regular reputable sushi bar   thinking perhaps precut mass production time arrived partially dried external surface area each piece fish being exposed prolonged period time   The rolls Perhaps enough sushi experiences progressed beyond rolls since drenched much sauce seriously obsession orgasm sauce town? crispy shavings empty calories packed many types fish couldn't really differentiate any them sushi roll lineup much Seinfeld episode where George tries catch Twix bar candy thief SETUP! They're all Caterpillar rolls!! would try limit your roll intake focus other items keep your palate being overwhelmed and avoid server pulling phantom roll maneuver previously discussed Last but least figured successfully navigated through labyrinth extra charges until received final bill which charged hot tea   are serious???  you're telling could drank entire gallon miso soup instead measly cup hot green tea which cost pennies brew?  Perhaps some tea leaves taken Emperor's garden but would appreciate warning next time     3 stars only because definitely still money's worth but leaving few more stars earned since friends reassured Goyemon better  <EOR> I'm giving place 4 stars  rolls really good variety different ones choose from  think third done trying all different rolls   Last time very pleasant attentive drinks rolls came timely fashion  Which love cause nothing sucks more having wait AYCE  full faster  experience varied extremely different over first visit where felt couldn't wait leave!  I happily say Oyshi taken favorite spot side town  Nagoya hands down  <EOR> My husband going since opening week! looove sushi cant price! love affair tuna! Always fresh! Also try green tea ice cream  <EOR> We always come sushi food always good fresh   Just want say server Bess super sweet attentive just awesome  <EOR> Finally Oyshi yesterday as recommended friend    atmosphere pretty awesome   spacious seating arrangement colorful decor Xgames Laker's Game TV Techno music playing background not really expected Sushi joint    came AYCE @ $22 00 dinner   decently priced AYCE   price does include drink   selection food menu pretty good   good assortment appetizers specialty rolls traditional Nigiri not mention hand cut Maki rolls    am big fan Sashimi but 99% time Sashimi included AYCE   did however stock Sake raw Salmon Nigiri   Being favorite Nigiri found Sake Nigiri very very fresh   super bright orange tasted incredible!  dessert few different flavors Mochi but only one   If remember correctly flavors follows Green Tea Mango Red Bean   opted Mango wish could second since pretty small size   Anyhow Sake Nigiri alone would gotten Oyshi 4 stars but unfortunately service extremely slow   top only soup available Miso Soup   Udon AYCE menu?  Seriously?? also did low sodium soy sauce I know still 800mg per tbsp but  better 1000mg    Overall I'd come again    just hope server keep water cup filled  <EOR> Oyshi Sushi best sushi place town! service fast thanks EJ providing best service every time come here  would definitely come back just because food quality but also wonderful service provided  place clean very welcoming thanks Oyshi Sushi served well <EOR> I'm disappointed service tonight during AYCE experience here  understand busy but would nice your server check things going  once did server check table waited 15 minutes per order   Horrible! _ 2 stars bus boys! <EOR> Oyshi always pleasure eat your establishment  Great service awesome sushi  <EOR> We all eat AYCE awesome!!

If completely stuffed won't nickel dime if don't eat two pieces but don't put your server awkward spot charge you  The restaurant big open venue private dining rooms special events  play great music all day  loud during lunch  Dinner however more trendy music louder crowds bigger lights turned low  Expect wait Friday Saturday nights! quoted 90 minute wait! <EOR> I still love place  When want sushi want Oyshi!  With said here's rant    no matter night ALWAYS packed   gripe  Upon recent visit noticed took some tables put rather large hostess stand  place already small crowded why would take away seating???

For desert definitely try green tea tiramisu    The service also great very attentive  great recommendations based off your tastes  trust if you're Vegas give place try  <EOR> I am still love place!! Since just friend opted first available seating Nd ended being bar  while new environment when sit bar! If just friend recommend sitting bar  If your family large group stick table  But recommend experiencing bar when can    By sitting bar face face sushi chefs  may order your rolls directly them if daring just them rolls without necessarily going off menu AYCE guests only guessing   Since first time sitting bar both didn't know possible until already ordered world just bursting seams  did try fatty tuna sushi though which basically made tuna belly  good!!   We also bottle lychee sake  came wine sized bottle but decided take shots it  yum basically tasted juice  Which dangerous because same alc vol wine friend finished bottle nothing!   Here few things think would great keep mind while you're if friend looking hang enjoy great food social definitely sit bar chefs whatever your heart desires it's all eat definitely come empty stomach prepared eat world! BUT   on busy nights wait awhile if come super hungry once you're seated you'll want order everything once! may good thing cuz if you're anything you'll stuff your face done within 30 minutes  if you're paying multiple cards sure person taking your payment knows exactly going card  Although  thought clear instructions she still managed charge wrong amount! I'm sure if girl just wasn't paying attention just wasn't having because busy but remember she also being bit rude when she calling people tables <EOR> Slow service  also call 10 times literally no answer orders  first time don't answer phone  <EOR> One fave sushi restaurants! love service quality food its very fresh  menu point  really nothing bad say  few times both times point  Its worth trip  <EOR> I oyshi lunch Friday immediately seated  ambiance beautiful   The food really good wide selection rolls   love customize rolls if ask   nigiri really fresh but better  really stood desserts   Our server Julia bomb ! She really friendly answered all questions   Although she quite busy she still kept tabs made sure drinks always full tables cleared     Oyshi definately place want check food amazing service  <EOR> Oyshi AYCE appetizers can't find any other AYCE sushi place  beef asparagus skirt steak rib eye few other things unique oyshi  Beef asparagus especially tasty  rolls similar anywhere else  nigiri  think bonsai roll very good  Spicy tuna inside Cajun albacore outside  Probably best roll had  biggest thing green tea creme brle  No other AYCE sushi place this  good!!!! Without I'd probably give 3 stars  But green tea creme brle alone worth 1 stat!!! <EOR> Food good   but staff seems happy job   whole time eating didn't see single smile   place good little pricey but fine   don't think we'll come back here   <EOR> Awesome! Great all eat price  Tons fresh fish fast going through it   Amazing selection rolls  take picture menu give sushi chef back home he recreate them   Japanese Lasagna Garlic if fantastic! Definitely come back next trip through Vegas! <EOR> Honestly if review based solely taste food would probably 5 starts but service bad both times there  First all sat dirty table said would someone come clean it  Took 5 mins someone there  Another 5 minutes someone take drink orders  Now beyond 5 minutes before friends sprite hit table another 5 minutes coke  Why earth didnt come same time beyond why would 10 ten minutes pisses off even more  ordered couple roles some salads  salads came ate them then sat sat 15 minutes before could even someones attention say hey whats happened??  must known shitty even complaining becase when rolls finally did come told salads would complimentary due lack service  only reason 2 stars instead one  Regardless two shitty service experiences no interest returning  <EOR> I've three times now because close house  Food definitely decent but service slow Oyshi almost painful dine at  time took almost 15 minutes just check wasn't even busy  Service important but if 2 hours kill 1 hour dinner all means  <EOR> I love Oyshi Sushi! Some All Eat sushi places separate menu cannot order here  order right off menu exception sashimi included   large variety rolls sushi  tried many them all delish! usually wait but its never outrageous staff always super friendly whenever go  <EOR> This place's bad  just feel food taste any other place  price good amount eat  I'd ordered spider roll crunchy scallop seaweed salad green tea  Those aren't good cooked dishes  <EOR> Ok come Vegas reviews   yes down street house  Yes gets crowded  If bring more 4 friends off time meaning LUNCH CROWD BEFORE DINNER CROWD especially weekends    Or split your party but sit near each other  Trust won't wait salivate while others dining taking time  Just kidding But seriously every other Yelper good deal    Highly popular everybody  Highly  <EOR> The best AYCE sushi Vegas affordable cost! every roll possibly think selection sushi pretty good  always provide quick friendly service  Beware if weekends expect wait  Rest assure work hard turning tables quickly your wait painfully long  <EOR> Ordered take out  Restaurant never order app apparently  Even when shown receipt exact order order number still being charged wouldn't give food  then tried telling might ordered different restaurant when exact same address   I assure there's lot better sushi spots town if you're restricted more SW side town  cautious Oyshi  <EOR> My first time sushi place  great atmosphere  ordered all spacial sushi good except salmon feel was't sweet  Service good  <EOR> This place ALL U CAN EAT sushi!!!! And menu option pretty sweet! It's awhile since but every roll tasted delish!  portions good two rolls filled fast so no did all u can eat option! LoL I think Kaizen best rolls Vegas    for now atleast! And decor pretty modern stylish especially enjoyed eating here! <EOR> When arrived place noticed awesome looked! pretty spacious  ordered baked salmon baked tuna sexy roll  egg rolls delicious! server really liked hustle she asked if wanted anything else multiple times haha! 5 ended paying $30 each bad sushi! <EOR> Use favorite spot town sushi but over last two years twice food poisonining raw sushi 3 stars because am sure bring back very nice clean place your sushi  <EOR> Horrible dining experience   Service extremely slow  Ayce sushi but full hot tea waiting slow food  Never coming back  <EOR> This place always top notch! Typical short wait   Have multiple rolls all delicious  Hardest debate whether order roll all eat  end best deal all eat just prepare leave stuffed   My wife isn't big fan sushi she always orders ribeye  She loves tried glorious well !!!  Recently saw other locations town which always plus! Try here   you won't disappointed! <EOR> I love love love Oyishi!   The atmosphere modern clean always plays best Pandora Stations! going years seen change over time physically however food consistent why back!   It's located Rainbow Windmill which literally less two minute drive where live  super convenient southwest area developing crazy sure call ahead sure there's table if big group  Sometimes wait bit seated even 2 people high volume day but if call ahead shouldn't problem  They've improving seating people right away noticed past few times  Prices affordable also offer all eat  private parking lot too    Also during weekdays awesome lunch special  ordered chicken teriyaki which generous serving California roll miso soup vegetable shrimp tempura house salad all $12!!!! wouldn't stoked that?   Overall place great  recommend anyon <EOR> Keep coming back last time back Oyshi knew before  food great staff outstanding  only concern choice music if you're bringing family children   minor  <EOR> LATE NIGHT SUSHI ITS BEST At least tried far I usually don't off until 11 15 night time most sushi bars Vegas already packed called night shortly to  Oyshi! Thankfully place stays open until 2AM last call 1 30 AM perfect folks working entertainment industry Vegas   The All You Can Eat option $27 place worth it! Though great other AYCE places dined still boasts wide selection rolls hot food    I think favorite roll Yellowstone Roll which interesting Spicy Tune Whitefish concoction topped yum yum sauce jalapeno CHEDDAR CHEESE  haven't ever place cheddar cheese sushi topping   I wish dessert all eat well because would two mochi balls instead 1 but  small gripe   The alcohol did seem relatively expensive  buddy Sapporo $7 $8  almost seems obscene   On positive note Dad huge sushi fan he opted Teriyaki Chicken Dinner  $11 hhe Miso Soup Salad bowl white rice HUGE steaming hot plate FULL chicken teriyaki hardly any vegetables  fantastic deal! <EOR> The food fine but just don't all hype   food far complain worthy but why would eat when Kobe Bistro pay half much exact same fish!?

Basically everything menu minus sashimi's menu obtainable AYCE deal just sure finish everything order pay price  I liked fact fish actually cold touch when eating rolls not   it gives false sense fresher  Like most AYCE if big appetite becomes better deal but if only stomach two rolls max might better off ordering off menu skipping deal  <EOR> Generally wouldn't recommend place if wanted keep secret  would say something place sucks there  thought but then then might backfire place closes down  Therefore     Yes am big fan  biggest sushi lover some people but when good good  believe wide enough sample restaurants know difference  place definitely place would recommend    The place cool kind drive strip middle nowhere strip mall tumble weed crossings inside fancy much other kind  But really don't need care much long clean   The place all eat all pay for  More like    eat all set price within two hours   Three four pages menu all included price  let tell every roll ever seen heard along many many more haven't  But also all wonderful appetizers Rib Eye Shrimp called Surf Turf tucked all way last page very end  Ya ordered 8 those  alone would probably worth price    Between seven ordered more sushi could ever imagine  But wasn't much quantity but quality just impressive  different rolls did try  complaint  good any other Sushi restaurant  I'd into names ingredients rolls but if love sushi even if don't just imagine ones probably menu   Service pretty good considering many people eating all eat sushi restaurant  really did expect sushi come every half hour  But didn't even notice any wait between drinks appetizers sushi more sushi more appetizers finally dessert  fact upon ordering extra Miso soup seemed table before finished ordering it  fast   Eating good food releases endorphins your brain  good sign just good meal good friends much everyone laughing end  plenty everyone  only reason Its 5 stars because some really good Sushi but can't order because usually Chef Special other places   By way place sucks  <EOR> I can't believe never written review this  I've going Oyshi years!  Oyshi best place AYCE mainly because appetizer dessert selections     What love baked mussels sizzling plates asian skirt steak surf turf   If you're hungry plates aren't shareable but most time are   asian skirt steak hint sweetness it   comes bed lettuce onions cast iron plate cooks     The surf turf just few pieces tenderloin steak 2 pieces shrimp also bed lettuce onions cast iron plates cooks   Very tender steak shrimp grilled perfection     I nigiris salmon garlic tuna yellowtail   All fish tastes fresh   salmon orange marbleized should be   your tuna 3 different ways but garlic favorite   Yellowtail plain   Always good tasting fish     Rolls few good but none them really caught attention honest      Dessert Vanilla creme brulee   bite green tea creme brulee good well     Appetizers soups nigiris desserts well worth AYCE  <EOR> A couple dollars more expensive some other ayce sushi places but worth it! They're busy lot prepared wait little but  Again worth though! Really great tasting sushi good customer service  <EOR> I am huge fan sushi usually always AYCE option if available try many different option  first place gone where really disappointed  flies everywhere food just did fresh flavor am used to  All items tried pretty bland almost tasted stale  better sushi places around don't think returning <EOR> My oh say  definitely Oishi even if did spell wrong  I came vegas quell beckoning seven deadly sins  safely say left knowing full well Gluttony very satisfied there's some sort ironic word play but goodness never figure out   Oyshi Sushi definitely raised bar SoCal AYCE sushi restaurants  might even say comparable delicious very missed Kami RIP The SKINNY I came group 12  last show very surprised fact could seat 12 people  usual AYCE sushi ordering paradigm    i barreled through 4 seasons Big Bang Theory check list given waitress which dropped off chef eventually you'll nom noming your way through delectable bite size raw fish goodness  But no checklist order directly waitress  But amazingly almost all orders made 12 people satisfied! place amazing service very patient staff variety Nigiri Rolls deeply yearn california  26 dollars well spent friends    The Food Okay originally suppose Sushi Mon but thing led another ended Oyshi  better variety rolls most group prefers rolls     Hearing breaks heart but need many outweighs need few comply  But! hot dam place some unique selections just simple nigiri  Spanish Mackerel? Garlic Tuna? Halibut? Seriously Koreans owning local southern california ayce sushi joints needs take page koreans owning Nevada's ayce sushi joints  say all amazing exception cajun albacore  just good  But still better bad I point fact offer free order Amaebi Uni 4 pcs raw oysters per customer  Being most people apprehensive raw food ate more enough free orders  goodness raw oyster cravings won't start least another month seriously menstrual cycle  know disgusting    Everybody speaks great rolls sure pretty good  But honestly can't remember them life me  maybe more forgettable spectacular  But cares give another 4 pieces raw oysters dammit!  what's important here   The Service Oh poor poor waitress  She through much   good thing tipped generously and coming Chiense man   service actually spot given some dead times where food arrived bit slow but its minor issue  Afterall probably 5 sushi chefs taking care whole restaurant INCLUDING party 12    This place bit off Vegas Strip but cares all eat SUSHI  good! only reason why wouldnt come if said Oh ate much Wynn Buffet already   barely excuse  <EOR> Nasty smushy abacore favorite place  Just lunch today now im toilet w diarrhea every hour  mouth dry now  <EOR> I cant believe its taken long find place! stumbled upon sushi restaurant while doing some errands today hidden treasure! Usually sushi bars very boring decor bland music but place playing Trance music   awesome! beautiful decor wall art exposed pipes very stylish modern feel it  almost felt San Francisco   I ordered seaweed salad  very generous portion but only gripe completely covered sesame seeds which am fan but know next time request them left out  seaweed itself very fresh right amount dressing used  Then ordered Hawaiian roll soy paper  albacore shrimp cucumber inside wrapped Cajun albacore avocado tossed some ponzu sauce    heaven  Seriously best sushi rolls ever consider myself sushi connoisseur   The popcorn scallops amazing well  they're little scallops deep fried served wasabi ranch honey mustard sauce   I all eat which only $25 even included 2 oysters!

Hm overall disappointing experience   both gone many sushi restaurants list including restaurants Hawaii San Francisco California wanted seriously give place chance  Unfortunately Oyshi just did live hype!  On side note though waitress very helpful service mediocre but  it  <EOR> Frequent patron establishment    few sushi restaurants highly recommend  wait seated gruesome depending time arrival time day  Once seated though service always great  rolls fully stuffed careful easily stuffed just few  Start light few Appetizers then roll two  half orders also  always best way gonif just want taste new roll  Sushi always fresh hope remains way  coming place 7yrs now  first sushi restaurant experience glad its still around!

Great Service Nice entertaining sushi chefs most all yummy fresh cut fish!  Sadly Oyshi NONE qualities   First all hostess Kassidy rudest restaurant host ever encountered  5 45 pm Tuesday   12 open seats bar many open tables   She said wait because enough servers any more guests next server comes 6pm   said would wait till 6   appointed time she escorted very end bar where no visibility fish cases chefs 10 empty prime seats center bar   Really?  When questioned she rudely said don't rules bar servers split 2 rules  give first guests arrive evening worst possible seat????  She reluctantly moved stomped away huff   server only slightly more friendly   Oh guess can't speak chefs   order through server only comes around rarely   decided order la cart instead all eat because prefer cut fish      Unfortunately albacore fish gross mealy send back   poor husband ate couple pieces paid price morning   other fish plates cut thick refined   Most fish pre cut case making dry out   ordered grilled hamachi kamma cheek told would take 20 minutes   Well no wonder came overcooked dry because probably only needs broil 5 minutes   also covered masago eggs which hate ask them removed   rolls TINIEST cut piece fish ever gotten roll    asked seared tuna nigiri wrong order    also ordered eel nigiri grilled eel but COLD also grill ahead time serve cold YUCK   Its fresh warm juicy eel good  rice under nigiri sure what   whole kernels rice but some kind rice paste   could find kernel rice it   tasted fishy gross rice pulp elmers glue fish water mushed up   edible     At end meal waiting area full but 6 empty tables   hostess takes great pride little power SEATING guests   wanted tell them RUN!  save your money your tummy   bad attitude definitely sets off experience bad  no idea place popular when only decent thing ate edamame     We only because favorite place no seating being full tuesday night 5 30 pm   Next time reservations normal place spare ourselves bad treatment bad food     I see other recent bad reviews take note people     <EOR> Walking decor chic modern   music hip lounge style music swear someone stolen Upbeat station Pandora   staff young friendly fast paced      The food comes two ways ALL EAT ala carte  opted more modest ala option am flying solo   food tastes fresh presentation lovely delivery onto plate quite speedy   only complaint food rolls packed very tightly   loose rolls aren't awesome   understand AYCE would require trading speed firmness but would rather firmness especially via ala carte ordering    All all pleasant experience likely return  Four five stars is  <EOR> I gotten sushi past pretty good reasonable prices  Recently again extremely disappointed order  ordered off Sushi menu which done before  total came $8 65 which seemed reasonable two basic sushi rolls salmon spicy tuna received literally 4 bites see photo So disappointed!

Yes two hours cheapest all eat sushi seen Las Vegas myself  Some say service sushi tad slow but hey two hours  likes rushed when eating anyways? enjoy food would enjoy nice pace thank you  If your great company gives some extra time some intellectual exchange words conversation   Plus two hours give enough time let rice settle bit enough time try good portion menu   The service might tad slow but workers always pleasant  actually feel wanted there   other Asian restaurants   They also very knowledgeable menu which leads great sushi suggestions   The sushi Oyshi say best Las Vegas!  I would suggest RED ROCK ROLL due fact contains Orgasm Sauce  sauce rightfully named because climax your taste buds into ecstasy!  Conclusion   YES! <EOR> We thought we'd try place instead going usually sushi spot mistake was! service terrible server just wondering around lost puppy  waters empty several occasions ask twice much longer would until sushi then given confused let check look  Also told only did half rolls bar which no sense! sushi mediocre best  town full great places eat skip somewhere else  <EOR> Came bday dinner  and sat own private area side which perfect   $25 all eat pretty much included everything menu besides sashimi    many rolls choose also yakitori dishes bacon wrapped asparagus steak chicken shrimp scallops poke salads delicious poke bowls oysters mussels   great selection   Since big party order took some time some missed but servers more helpful made sure everything wanted   meals also parfait mochi tiramisu dessert  I would definitely coming back  Only downer pretty far strip if don't car its $30 cab ride but if split its bad   2 hours stuffing faces many bottles sake left stuffed satisfied only came $40 person! expecting way more! <EOR> Snow Mountain roll incredible! Service usually good though wait rolls long during dinner  Only complaint god awful music  Hip hop EDM all hear  Nothing against Ludacris but he isn't really sushi music  kills atmosphere  Would come more often if set better music program  <EOR> Chirashi good but prettty limited quantity fish   few fillers   Service bar great guys lively keep fun atmosphere  <EOR> Amazing place amazing food husband treated anniversary   Chef Ed super sweet  <EOR> Love spot  terms availability diverse food items AYCE sushi places place pretty great  Sitting bar chefs friendly waitstaff always wonderful  going years besides them having punch card AYcE place great open late! <EOR> This place yummy!

Many visits couple years ago   all slow service room temperature nigiri etc   actually only places told people sushi    and never understood why others liked much   A VERY reluctant lunch stop proved much better experience time around!  A few highlights Sea Scallops awesome! Super fresh buttery texture   melt your mouth!   Sake very fresh today! Beautiful cuts salmon    the Sake Yuzu very good well overpowering yuzu sometimes   The Ika Mint  really enjoyed combination   and noticeably less chewy most    Ahi  Fresh but another odd cut   the darker area bit tougher   should removed chef   Pic http www yelp com biz_photos oyshi sushi las vegas?select=UnVcwLiUog_Lmr ZkUaKwQ#UnVcwLiUog_Lmr ZkUaKwQ  Unagi  Nice crispy edges   good flavor!   Ahi Poke  Tuna fresh seaweed salad good too!  Sunomono  liked version here   thin cuts versus larger circular cuts most use  ginger sauce good too   Green Tea Creme Brulee  Delicious! Lots tea flavor   Service fairly quick considering tables mostly full   I would come back again now if already side town P <EOR> Tried AYCE lunch  Hated put much imitation krab mix almost every roll  Gross  <EOR> I love place! food good service great!!! definitely continue dine here! <EOR> Sigh  *really* looking forward all stellar reviews  Vegas many times always thought best sushi would some swank place Strip but Yelp claimed otherwise   The good food overall fine  didn't All Eat because wife wanted two orders sashimi salmon hamachi   Both excellent  Nice large meaty pieces well trimmed nicely presented  two rolls each which fine but nothing special  also two orders nigiri   The bad arrived around 2pm Sunday afternoon  restaurant MAYBE half full  more half hour before first piece food came out  40 minutes before saw any order  nice server came 30 minutes offered free miso soup help pass time  Meanwhile watched every other table place multiple orders sushi delivered  Completely unimpressed cost them several stars   Other issues asked if aji bones could deep fry server off find but never came back tell yes no  aji nigiri tiniest pieces aji ever eaten top  tasted fine but amounted table scraps all beautiful pieces sashimi wife got  <EOR> Who ever sushi chef tonight didn't really great job shrimp tempura roll   soggy crunch wasn't there   ordered two case maybe mistake made first time   second soggy if more   flavor just texture correct   I normally come cousins when feel sushi past sushi always top notch   But tonight think chef probably bad mood hence mediocre sushi    I also ordered sashimi salad   also great here   better other restaurants   Oh well maybe next time try might better   long sushi chef tonight isn't same next time  <EOR> Why three stars? Here's why     First let say busy Saturday afternoon took fifteen minutes boyfriend seated  took another fifteen minutes top waitress take order another twenty minutes sushi  heard oyshi being best sushi places town while sushi good tasty order restaurant in opinion five worthy deserving stars service needs good food   minus star number one    And!     would think 'all eat' everything all eat section all eat right? Including dessert? Well think not oyshi least  dessert per person only  Which technically isn't all eat  basically all eat sushi but dessert  Haha  would minus star number two    Now three yummy stars! When sushi finally came yum O! capital last letter screaming O! cajun albacore thanks friend recommended another sushi place become favorites next unagi  really full flavor love center attention fish rice bottom  gives plus star   The atmosphere restaurant laid back  Both boyfriend laid back mood place set mood relaxing time which always much needed long busy week  Even cutesy plate mats designs cutesy fonts cutesy flowers  Haha  Guess what? Yes! guessed another star oyshi   Freshness sushi another thing look for  boy oh boy does oyshi serve fresh  fresh prince bel air  'love affair' which everyone kept yelping about  kind affair feel guilty because think cheating your significant other  Oh yea  good! Total three stars modern looking sushi spot   I don't know if I'd come back though partly because service partly because ever longing eating lot desserts  Well wouldn't say don't know but maybe  Maybe service better experienced different time day  Maybe  A ok review but read other peoples reviews place  may change heart unlike me  =P <EOR> When pressed favorite AYCE sushi place most Vegas locals name least one  Oyshi Rainbow mine    I've lunch dinner myself dates  Most often roommates just roll much mentions sushi   The food delicious extremely fresh  New York where all you can eat sushi unheard of  and would pretty suss if did hear it  Less $30 seafood? fished Hudson River?

Wait time Saturday little none which absolutely amaze balls  group 6 came eat we're immediately seated  server Game sweet  He quick respond orders coming out  He apologetic end when some desserts available   Great time good corner table constant refills point    We ordered Rock roll  Veggie tempura  Quail egg Caterpillar roll  Coco Monster  Ahi poke Dynamite roll  App dynamite  Calamari  Red dragon  Hawaiian  Crazy Cali  Tiger roll Green tea = wtf Parfait  Choco creme brule <EOR> Consistently good food consistently bad service   say am torn   great menu rolls decent ayce prices ahi poke point but other hand many bad service experiences them count   would say better Vegas its worth looking for  <EOR> Waste $45  just flavorless proper sauces given   SMITHS market woulda better fresher cold!  fish room temp then fried roll outside gummy   just followed gut intuition SMITHS market next time! <EOR> I've sushi place 3 times   first two experiences alright   all eat reasonable price rolls ok  But third time came last week   very disappointed   First took them forever seat wasn't lot people   no line only few people restaurant  Then all around service bad  waitress took long time take orders once done dish multiple waiters bussers would walk still wouldn't take away dirty plates   Eventually dishes just piled up  Even when brought new rolls wouldn't take plates away   Then top off bad experience sushi subpar if that  could tell fish previously frozen took away flavor fish  very disappointed   whole experience bad  <EOR> 4 5 stars My trip Vegas would complete without visit Oyshi Sushi  Though off strip lucky best friend lives close enough trip every time there    My last visit first time done All Eat deal $26 WELL WORTH IT! only things DOESN'T include Chef's Special Sashimi all your appetizers salads specialty rolls desserts included  friends all ordered several share every course  Oysters delicious baked mussels while much mayo sauce die for  Tempura dishes nice crispy soggy heavy  favorite salad ahi poke top seaweed salad YUM! shared 6 specialty rolls all delicious own ways  Again specialty yum yum sauce yum yum but small amounts  mochi ice cream type buy store but again all part deal might well indulge! also bottle lychee flavored cold sake decently priced balanced sweet alcohol ratio perfectly   Service good unless its super busy wait staff always comes check your group sure your water filled etc  any sushi place baked rolls take longer patient! did forget orders point but since eating much gave time digest   If trip group enjoys sharing specialty rolls throw down eating Oyshi place go! <EOR> So yesterday late lunch early dinner friends wanted try new sushi place  He going drive said sure wherever want go  He other friend heard good things place  arrive turns other friend once but forgot haha hope isn't bad news     Turns really good  decor place music playing feel kind clubby haah  waitress nice let switch table bar could orders faster  all stuffed faces full sushi  Large selection sushi choose should find something like  Since day some cream cheese sushi am fan when saw menu try everyone cream cheese haha  dessert which gave friend strawberry mochi  He green tea ice cream   I give 3 stars  love sushi guys friendly making sushi waitress friendly too  far but if area place would stop at  <EOR> Excellent quick Service party 15 everything great food customer service Thanks Server Mono!

<EOR> I love sushi Oyshi's good but AYCE service leaves something desired  Service very slow orders come when chef decides prepare them when ordered it   Orders forgotten errors made repeatedly  Because its all you can eat maybe there's sense mistakes don't matter if accept dish since all same price     Those complaints aside food done well isn't oversized sloppy some AYCE places  tell chefs care presentation  can't think any food poor quality there     My tips place would to 1 come list 2 order variety items once  When arrive order next batch   3 sure everyone table agrees order batches otherwise everyone  sitting around waiting ages until your next lonely order arrives second order could take 30 minutes more! 4 save room tiny dessert  comes AYCE  <EOR> Owner shows late place couldn't open lunch just lost sushi fan due lack business ownership! <EOR> Were come all eat sushi means buffet which also means stay away  when Khatherine T  made sushi date she suggested AYCE died  Thankfully Oyshi Sushi opened eyes other side AYCE   Even though first real experience AYCE still ordered off menu LOL! Should would tried but BF begged bring left overs AYCE rules require finish eating everything order  Nuts! Next time BF own sushi going big going home!  Our server nice! He made several recommendations really good rolls mine spicy he knew which hot which hot  He even told roll stay away from  He attentive made sure always food front water glasses stayed full  Khatherine pro she didn't even look menu she knew everything she wanted ordered each time he came back table  She knew keep sushi coming everything came table looked delicious!  The sushi good amazing but good  tried Monster Roll it big hard time fitting mouth!

If don't mind driving bit off strip then come sushi place  only $22 lunch when friends Saturday   Sorry peeps   Sushimon still better me    <EOR> AYCE place awesome everything tastes great wish could more premium dessert but guess could just another sush roll instead?

Yama flamingo Maryland best ayce sushi bad don't stay open late would gone there! <EOR> I'm always looking new late night spots try Vegas because usually eat dinner around 11 12 decided give shot  especially love good late night happy hour but only sake food   Great service chefs really friendly always checking sure if needed anything  But food in terms good sushi authentic Japanese mediocre  those Americanized places where spicy tuna fried California roll yum yum sauce dominant menu where most cut rolls taste same because its all different variations same ingredients  ordered white tuna sushi sunomono salad well  White tuna decent sunomono something errr else   cucumber shredded thin sliced thin put sesame peanut sauce instead usual rice vinegar  Let's just say didn't finish waste food unless truly unappetizing  <EOR> Fat pieces fish nigiri ratio freshness beats all other sushi joints tried here  <EOR> My boyfriend received FOOD POISONING them  recommended no pays visit because next day pleasant  <EOR> Oyshiii! means yummy tasty Japanese  place does some pretty good food say though  live 5 minutes away always glad support neighborhood businesses  But place really worth time money  really ayce menu always specials  love salmon toro example sometimes yellowtail special well which worth trying    They also number great apps baked mussels surf turf skillet ayce mom loves them    I also unlike some other popular ayce sushi places area wait never crazy  If come regular weekend night shouldn't anything more 10 15 min wait    Lastly if small party sit bar order half rolls try more things menu  <EOR> This place poppin Saturday night!  We won last game day wanted celebrate team    I'll hella honest wanted hit plant based fast food spot around way  But being team player haha it? am along plan   We ate back rooms actually customize tables set ourselves because grip Samoans small room haha  My table did pick AYCE option but few veggie rolls yakisoba which did care but rolls really tasty fresh!
