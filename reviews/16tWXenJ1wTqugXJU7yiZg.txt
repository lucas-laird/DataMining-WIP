This place pretty easy find little strip mall southwest part Las Vegas far strip  Wasn't busy 3 able table 6 trust needed it  Sat around wondering if should AYCE $24 95 hard full sushi less $50 person choice easy  order la carte but you'll end spending way more that    Our waitress Val sweet innocent type still Hawaiian accent  She very attentive rest servers refills well additional orders  Tip * menu means only per person stands reason more expensive items  Didn't realize til end then missed ordering few things   Ordering simple front page mini portions appetizers entrees 2nd page rolls nigiri dessert  Here's had # number orders  I took photos almost everything ordered best upload them  Ahi Poke excellent much other little sauce ponzu sesame seeds 2 Agedashi Tofu pretty standard  Cold Tofu it's just tofu good palate cleanser  Edamame standard 4 Garlic Chicken good but didn't sweet sauce cooked also drizzled ordered sauce side but wasn't same Kurt F loved sauce drenched chicken each own     Miso Black Cod excellent wasn't planning ordering but did during last call sad when good couldn't more  very buttery flavor but chef said taste miso glaze sake 2 Pork Gyoza standard  Seared Poke not fan seared tuna but some reason raw poke better  Rolls think rolls general many dif flavors shy away them  Philadelphia standard  Philadelphia Deep Fried standard  Salmon Skin mediocre standard  Spider didn't try but heard good little heavy rice but AYCE just order another!  Alii I intrigued wasabi lime mayo but overpowered sushi which might point seeing deep fried white fish mediocre  Haleakala Kurt F liked scallops he stabbed hand trying take picture  Hawaiian Style really good would definitely order again  Nigiri addition appetizers mainly ate 4 Albacore excellent 4 Garlic Tuna excellent 2 Hamachi Yellowtail wasn't fresh enough tastes 4 Hirame Halibut has always faves didn't disappoint  Dessert you only order per person Banzai Special excellent best all dif choices Scoop Green Tea Ice Cream Dan Y thought cold  but hey ice cream! Scoop Vanilla Ice Cream  Kurt F  Jewish Chinese way home calculated much would spent  bill including tax tip $103 if ordered la carte $287  win! would more but Dan Y didn't hold end bargain stuff himself    I'm fairly certain Val tired running back forth getting all food but she awesome  Good experience next time we're staying off strip going AYCE time order Miso Black Cod first! <EOR> is Good but bad service very unprofetional Hawallan guy frendly very smal sushi bar think seven chair n everytime only guy working bar very unprofetional wont egain bad bad service hate said but real poor poor service <EOR> THIS PLACE BOMB!

Hamachi collar  Ask any chef she he knows best part fish collar except toro   fatty flavorful meat seared crispy outside but soft wonderful inside just me! Miso Cod soft buttery mild miso sauce  much better traditional miso butterfish which more shoyu it  version much more delicate  Salmon collar which intense amount fat meat  pure inddulgence  The nigiri uni unagi hamachi halibut all quality standards   During ending though felt overloaded msg think due natural fattiness saltiness Hamachi collar Miso salmon collar  Bad move eating all three sitting but try since first time here  Next time limit myself indulging all three   If baked clams crusty mayo sauce top would perfection!  Went Wednesday 2 large groups came luckily when nearing end dining experience  place gets crowded good reason! <EOR> One favorite shopping plaza near hole in the wall sushi spots  place score big points customer service first foremost  But even further love AYCE menu  much just sushi but items other side menu   poke tender delicious  tuna salmon collar is    is    good  If you've never fish collar you've missing out  unlike some other places AYCE don't try fill rice  hate when order roll roll huge need knife fork eat because there's whole bag uncle Ben's rice roll  808 get's quality food excellent customer service  <EOR> The garlic chicken very tasty ahi poke good rolls average  They having summer happy hour menu which prices bad  I would recommend if your around  <EOR> I give place four stars simple fact happy hour affordable!

I'd really rather gorge myself all eat sushi if avoid 808 Sushi's affordable delicious food during Happy Hour really me    Happy   I preferred rolls over nigiri  Really good unagi based tempura based modern style rolls they're flavorful great texture without being overdone    This all 808 feel more cozy neighborhood sushi shop visit familiar friends lunch without having deal long lines large menus all you can eat pressure rush more mainstream restaurants  For some reason caught happy hour 11AM 3PM weekday which doesn't seem listed anywhere website menus but common knowledge among regulars  sure details since friend's sushi place mine if know mean       but think adding 808 personal rotation now haha! <EOR> Best sushi prices during happy hour!

Fast Service all waitresses help each other everybody's top it! Also very family friendly <EOR> 808 Sushi skilled fisherman Hawiian Dad Japanese Mom but seems confused he really is    This fisherman clearly some Japanese blood because he offers freshest fish Vegas comparable Naked Fish  While he may best eel sauce he still apprentice  Offering very limited selection apps rolls fail impress me    Their house roll 808 special just okay  If they're own house special roll fails impress don't think other rolls impress me  also took half dragon roll since last order no complaints but nothing special either  Maybe just being sushi elitist   I given shrimp heads sweet shrimp lightly fried  could much better if fried more throughly through actually eat entire head 1 bite instead just sucking inside  Places Lotus Siam even Brian's Beach Sushi but Ichiza 808 Sushi    The ahi poke just couldn't bare myself finish it  Just something flavors made want finish hate wasting seafood   The hamachi kama yellowtail collar grilled crisp  just wasn't grilled right because all could taste burnt flavor  fair grilling seafood properly really difficult just right sadly fail properly  Hikari right   The seared salmon sashimi good but found unnecessary add hot peppers it  Salmon already very flavorful its own no need add additional spices mask its natural flavor    The gyoza came hot crispy tasty but request pan fried instead  help preserve more flavor lost when fry food   The uni good creamy texture but dark yellow color tells grade uni isn't great  But hey tastes great thats all matter   The banzai desert apple pie filling wrapped dough form resembles egg roll  Its deep fried then cut half served vanilla ice cream chocolate sauce whipped cream  Good but small problem this  Combining something relatively hot apple pie filling taking bite ice cream good combination  may hurt your teeth little because coldness ice cream hard hotness apple roll  Its similar filling plastic bottle hot water pouring then immediately pouring cold water over it  Try yourself see happens   temperature differential good you  Letting apple roll cool down fix problem   The fisherman also Hawiian dad takes over part menu  dad's influence great those don't sushi but those wanting more Japanese influence disappointed because no dynamite screaming orgasm soft shell crab oysters toro all eat menu   The sushi bar open kitchen but also someissues this  First if sit right next grill you'll some smoke it  also see owner ordering staff sure order gets out  While really admire push food just kind kills good vibe eating sushi bar  just bad vibe owner end meal despite having very good vibe beginning meal  quickly things change  Otherwise front house really attentive really friendly   808 Sushi another sushi restaurant but really seeing hype place  some small improvements additions see place being really special  Otherwise its just place all eat sushi limited selection happen friends don't sushi  Spend couple more bucks stick Hikari Sushimon your all eat sushi needs  <EOR> I definitely drop 808 Sushi time time  They've good selection both sushi well entrees appetizers    Regarding AYCE AYCE option only around $21 lunch which great deal  menu includes both rolls nigiri well things mochiko chicken poke gyoza etc  even if you're mood sushi would basically eat ALL APPETIZERS hot items you've yourself excellent deal    Lunch Specials They've started offering lunch specials awhile now most expensive offering $8 50 which includes mound rice w furikake full portion mochiko garlic chicken 8pc spicy tuna roll 3 nigiri salmon yellowtail tuna salted warm edamame  rest lunch bentos cheaper ton stuff too    In short great portion sizes good prices consistently good food  don't put ton rice sushi well which appreciate  doesn't blow mind but don't hesitate come AYCE take out  also only place know offers *reasonable* donburi katsudon oyakodon  I know place serves katsudon box barely fits 1 5 cups food    $8 9    One minor criticism point view spicy tuna filling more texture spicy poke  Instead finely chopping mincing tuna mixing spicy sauce large chunks tuna coated sauce  spicy tuna less spicy which sad  Prepared way isn't much different putting bunch wasabi tuna  Then again am type person grew eating spicy food people planet find bell peppers spicy    shrug <EOR> I wouldn't put 808 sushi top 3 Vegas but decent  employees always greet once come in  very big place there's limited seating    I've AYCE couple times  fish rice ratio hit miss always same  don't many choices appetizers but ones pretty good  usually order combination dinner teriyaki salmon shrimp tempura because good amount keeps full  teriyaki salmon favorite thing menu  used douse sauce but now much better!

And wanted pay $2 50 hot sake normal price when happy hour sake $1    more discount groupon!  And food OK  rolls small flavorless  worth any more groupon happy hour pricing  poke salad good tuna but  it  rainbow roll tiger roll blah    The service itself OK but waitress SHOULD given separate checks     just stupid part  Doesn't she want tip? Repeat customers???  Overall very disappointed  am always looking new happy hours   808 sushi list    <EOR> Sorry say place gone down hill don't know if new owners heck happened but portions getting smaller quality gotten worse  last time came fish tasted bad   only upside always gotten great service  Bring back original servers owner sushi much better then  sorry say looking another ayce sushi place unless quality gets back par <EOR> The wait wasn't long all  Amazing food great service! I'd recommend restaurant anyone #goodeats <EOR> I several times AYCE  few occasions tend steer myself towards hot dishes  don't really enjoy sushi  much prefer other options    I wish would allow more more orders kalbi limit per guest unfortunately  think probably favorite dish here  don't really think money's worth honest AYCE  Some rolls pretty good but nothing really stands place    I would much prefer getting la carte plus Happy Hour which would probably better  All all place just okay  If given choice usually don't recommend 808   It's worst best town  Pretty much just average book  <EOR> Moving back Southwest area glad grace establishment presence once again  sister ordered take happy hour menu spent $20 two rolls gyoza edamame!  deal half! Oh missed 808 special! gooooooooooooood!  Additionally servers always filled aloha spirit  feel back Hawaii since they're super friendly  glad restaurant still going strong! <EOR> Amazing sushi  Definitely nice clean quiet sushi spot  am loyal customer won't anywhere else SW!!
