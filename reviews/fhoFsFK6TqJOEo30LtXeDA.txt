Linda great! <EOR> I excited Halal guys came Vegas! literally last meal 2016  kind regret did though because worst halal guys had  dropped around 4pm 8 orders   At every other Halal guys noticed meat much fresher  Majority time meat came straight off grill  Perhaps place slower others because all meat warmer looked while  even burnt hard pieces bottom platter  also skimp rice lot compared others asked if could fill more but she said extra which little ridiculous  no extra rice option menu asked before other locations    Overall portions smaller meat fresh particular location  sure meal would taste better later gets night  However wouldn't recommend eating daytime meal <EOR> We baby shower over holiday weekend served Halal Guys delicious decided them cater impromptu Labor Day family lunch 2 days later  Couldn't easier order  delivered right time scheduled came everything needed didn't even know needed chafing dishes sterno serving utensils individual food signs lighter well made instruction sheet set everything up  food delicious devoured  Would definitely use them again future! <EOR> First timer here  definitely come back  combo plate jalepenos  white sauce great  red sauce ridiculously spicy!

NO  second visit worse first  Actually really same issues last visit except time rice crunchy  Really dry hard   ordered bowl mixed rice hard rice every bite   Halal guys okie dokie  say avoid it    unless enjoy crunchy rice  <EOR> The generic Greek food  give chicken mostly dark meat lettuce tomatoes  Wow    Also white sauce basically mayonnaise   But if you're looking quick fix Greek food meal ya go  <EOR> Being ny nj probaby biggest disappointment ive encountered vegas  Portion way less flavor off ingredients pre made charge way much  also charge $1 additional white sauce  <EOR> Decent late night food  Good customer service even though ordered last few minutes  combo platter baklava definitely worth it! <EOR> I absolutely love place! usually order via Uber Eats first time eating location  Service great food tasted yummy quick easy!  usually order beef gyro amazing delicious    white sauce hot sauce tasty! <EOR> Great customer service    They someone line explain things work    Food okay  combo chicken gyro meat  White sauce strong mayonnaise flavor  your normal white sauce but see why people love it  Red sauce smoking hot  Only tiny bit needed  extra pita bread $1 smells weird since sits top meat grill  Probably wouldn't order again  ones aren't top meat told later nice lady front    Fries delicious made when place your order very crispy tasty    Not sure if would back  But definitely worth first try someone hasn't there  <EOR> This place sucks  white sauce isn't fresh made delicious tzatziki  pretty much packets ranch dressing  Also 2 packs sauce contain 660 calories over 100% DV fat  Very disappointed <EOR> Very delicious generous portions  White sauce everything! Hot sauce seriously hot   as should be  yourself favor eat enjoy all all sauces unlimited quantities    Minus star visiting during slow time  If meats sitting little dry  still flavor love but become little chewy but nothing more sauce can't help  <EOR> Absolutely best Gyro Chicken Las Vegas  husband Gyro Chicken plate  Very delicious! <EOR> It truly pains write review incredibly excited place open  NYC first time last year ate some Halal carts gyros unlike any gyro ever had  never visited Halal Guys heard best best  When heard opening location freaked couldn't wait!  We last night around 9 pm wasn't busy  mean full line but expecting outside wrapped around building  all only took five minutes time walked until left order   I ordered chicken gyro combo plate white red sauces side  tasted white sauce before put food thankfully because revolting  assumed would tzatziki but basically liquid mayo  ended adding half packet red sauce which gave nice heat  Unfortunately hot sauce only great thing meal   The gyro meat more ground lamb sliced gyro meat New York meat itself very tasteless  chicken ok wasn't dry but again lacking flavor  rice extremely bland well all food pretty much tasted red sauce no flavor its own   It wasn't terrible meal just extremely underwhelming disappointment  Halal Guys came very hyped everyone unfortunately dish did come close delivering  If ever drunk China town maybe stop again but way better gyros elsewhere Vegas scratch itch  <EOR> I California recently happy see Hala restaurants   I looking Hala Guys restaurants because website food looks good couldnt find Anaheim Ca but few days later just driving excited see Hala Guys Las Vegas week 2x already food awesome customer service Great!!! am returning customer   PBTA!!! <EOR> The first time tried Halal guys originally NY Long Beach CA unlike anything ever tasted  orange rice chicken gyro lettuce tomato drizzled white red sauce all mixed together   Mmmmm   The hype real wanted back next day!   When heard opening Halal guys Vegas ecstatic dying again  However some particular reason just wasn't good first time Cali  location twice now ingredients don't seem fresh meats really dry well  white sauce good remember think red sauce little tamer warning it'll still burn your insides if consume much   try crinkle cut fries last time surprisingly good  Hot fresh crispy crunchy  Also if you're gonna platter large because significantly larger regular size just $1 more    The service always good  Overall would give place 3 5 rating but due friendly helpful staff am bumping them 4  <EOR> Been original cart 53rd 6th counting down days them open Vegas   Sure same cart NYC but sure original McDonalds way better 100 000's franchises around world   Food tasty   white hot sauce good cart   The only complaint portion size   They're little stingy inconsistent portions  <EOR> Thanks Savannah free gyro sandwich! accidentally put much hot sauce didn't realize spicy!!! she gave another one  Definitely gonna recommend! Look Savannah! She's very accomodating excellent customer service! <EOR> Trying gyros beef   give lot Sandwich enough fill up  taste good but restaurant noisy times when chopping he meat  Otherwise good place quick bite  <EOR> This place good most part far food concerned  customer service wasn't very good nobody seemed really know going took awhile order    I also wish Halal Guys more options other chicken gyro i e  lamb    Overall somewhat decent Halal spot  <EOR> I run errands area decided stop by  First foremost workers awesome  extremely friendly took time explain everything because first time  establishment itself looked pretty clean well kept  sauces all labeled day made which reassuring    Overall food quality bad but nothing amazing  chicken middle road  super tender dry  gyro meat pretty damn salty  started eating plate realized needed pretty much empty half bottle white sauce mask saltiness  sure much sauce can't good but sure done worse body  Baklava gave yelp check BOMB! Hands down best part meal    I kept reading spicy red sauce really wanted try myself  Let preface mentioning am Korean  love eating food lips numb break sweats  started off drizzling small amount sauce over plate but ended dumping ton red sauce halfway through meal  red sauce definitely lived hype loved much hurt  definitely going shooting fire ass tomorrow but worth it    The portion size quite generous  Two regular size combo's more enough fill up  Pricing $8 49 + tax each think fair price ask for  place offers decently good value your money but nothing spectacular  Imagine mediterranean version chipotle  Would drive henderson come here? Probably not  If area would try again? Sure  <EOR> Excited Halal Guys Vegas  Being east coast same back home  Prices little high  Order chicken gyro drink cost around $11 some change  even ask server put more meat pita bread  Over all getting value money especially Chinatown district you'd expect more bang your buck  Most likely won't repeat  <EOR> Wasn't even good  More drunk good food late night  New York must something better stuff  think people would more satisfied Taco Bell 5$ box  <EOR> Too much hype but disappointing end  food bland including famed white sauce  only exception falafel which exceptionally good  crisp dark outside green inside due generous use fresh cilantro  If again would order it  Nothing else's interesting limited menu  <EOR> Doesn't much better far gyros  typically enjoy slices better chunks but Halal Guys point nonetheless  infamous white sauce great tasty kick addition hot sauce fire sandwich  Throw some tomato lettuce think pita great lunch  $8 75 steep but think worth every once while if you're craving spicy tired typical chipotle panera lunch options  <EOR> So many mediocre reviews  many people love pick place tell difference between nyc carts  Yes eaten nyc carts many times yes food comparable  Tasted same especially sauces     You're being edgy criticizing best street food US    The food great price great now location great  All haters just butthurt because now can't brag alone eaten famous halal guys  <EOR> I'm giving 5 because service them cleanliness place spite location since comparing another branch California  vegas franchise course original 53rd 6th  but someone lives Vegas ungrateful having town  Combo only way even back New York even late night club hours! Beware red sauce now warned  generate love hate relationship your food but goddamn good white sauce have   Altogether know back  stingy white sauce all give 2 packets unlike California table extras if decide eat house   I'm sure other places your halal fix but trust me  different  <EOR> Came 2 AM Monday night looking something other typical China town sushi ramen spot     happy find place open!

Food amazing healthy fresh  Customer service superb fast friendly  Open late too! <EOR> Born raised New Yorker super excited when Halal Guys opened Las Gaygas  good but many other reviews stated quite same    First time ordered Uber Eats  Hubby never NY excited try it  Needless say he loved but still can't wait try legit thing    Second time today we're still waiting food ordered almost 45 minutes ago  First ran chicken wait that  Then when chicken finally ready realized didn't enough rice  girl behind counter subbed rice fries kindly refunded platters offered  Hubby disappointed since he ordered extra rice because he liked much    3 stars because doesn't quite taste same slow service  Maybe just used speedy carts NY lines wrapped around block sometimes  <EOR> Had check since people rave coming NY   Nothing SPECIAL  good but going extra trip out   Had combo small  Falafel bit small hard side   They quick but busy location especially parking  <EOR> Finally! Welcome Vegas  Halal Guys 3 times since its soft opening already  never disappoints combo plate  hummus okay nothing special  enjoy pita bread white sauce hot sauce be careful cautious!   light yummy but filling meal  only negatives experienced far AC being broken forgot hot sauce white sauce condiment bottles all empty stand  There's dozen employees helping but sauces overlooked   best part! Hope come back first bumps road resolved  <EOR> It's just HYPE guys!   If you've never real thing NY then maybe    But then again many better place Vegas spend your hard earned money on    Pros staff friendly sauces readily available soda machine food ok  Cons parking little difficult price high menu small only thing reminds NY name otherwise just looks random fast food joint   Wish could give higher rating because love NY guys but pretty disappointing  <EOR> I expecting something fabulous all hype but everything bland  Yes ghost pepper sauce give heat but beef chicken isn't flavorful begin with  understand original NYC locations featured LAMB which would totally step flavor quotient  loose beef doesn't cut white sauce adds nothing but moisture which good everything desert dry but again much taste  Sorry Guys wanted love you  <EOR> The portion little something over $10   amount rice put little even large order   If you're used eating location  NY 53rd 6th you'll really disappointed  <EOR> Had place back Chicago LA   Still good here   Combo Platter    Wasn't busy all friday night   Ample parking   always back   sure if good New York but still it  <EOR> My first time here! Even though everyone recommends combo plate just really craving sandwich  did disappoint  rarely eat whole gyro but couldn't stop one   red sauce good but liked white sauce much better  fattening eat regular but definitely back try combo plate  <EOR> Came around 12 30am last night  don't understand why food bit colder room temperature  suppose open til 4am but seemed close  definitely fast food joint  white sauce people raving very bland hot sauce wasn't liking either  could just still give shot  2 stars cause hummus pita  fairly good give good amount $5  ordered combo plater falafel then side hummus just try most had  If first time trying middle eastern food would probably never try Middle Eastern food again  <EOR> I am avid Halal Guys fan! used frequent street cart NYC when lived easily became those meals craved weekly!   I just first meal combo plate location did disappoint  Before posting saw review someone complaining food being cooked ahead time sitting until served clearly person doesn't much  ever chipotle? same concept  busy locations food won't much chance sit long those lines won't stop! sad someone rated them negatively beginning    Back food careful red sauce! If haven't before taste little bit your finger before adding your dish you'll thank later! white sauce where at  ranch tzatziki made love child  lettuce tomato help cool heat red inferno!   The location small but coming cart street where eat your meal standing 5 degree weather snow wind   I think huge step up! love feeling standing eating meal locations  just things  If you're going complain don't seat put your butt bring fold chair your car or eat your car save complaint    The A C wasn't working but haven't really opened yet  types things expected  fans cooling units inside help appreciated that  owners great! Very nice guys! even gave 2 free entrees future visit  staff all very friendly saw lots smiles not something used street cart lol !  Eating experience should look that! likely challenge finding parking  may wait line when weather great  If come those expectations you'll enjoy your meal even more especially late night some cocktails ! Well done Halal Guys! <EOR> Best customer service Angel does good job greeting customers very clean store <EOR> Halal Guys probably only restaurant excited whole year  remember first time yesterday it really only 6 months ago just finished snowing cold winds relentless proceeded optimistically cautious famous food cart see NYC location review details orgasm   swore myself day another bite its yellow rice chicken gyro meat white sauce  Thankfully THG become multi million dollar company expanded its white sauce deliciousness west coast and even Philippines    The combo plate yet failed only two visits could it?   only recommendation extra white sauce easy red sauce BBQ sauce if it  could its buttery rice moist chicken but sure other soon hundreds reviews that    What appeal ask? Perhaps its legendary name white sauce tasty cheap eats always its own pedestal above all others only way know sure if THG try    good NYC locations? don't think don't know why  NYC tasting decades grinding streets hard work while Vegas its byproduct flavors American Dream noted     At least fits macros though    50P 86C 30F combo platter white sauce 0P 0C 10F per 2oz WHITE SAUCEEE <EOR> Great food quick service  Prices reasonable high quality food  Beware red sauce liquid lava  white sauce fantastic though! If 11 30 lunch rush! <EOR> I love place open until around 3 4am  Working industry off late perfect place stop grab food way home  Always friendly staff always quickly  Don't forget your rewards card!

Their combo meat chicken gyro tasty    Their pita super soft yummy   Falafel just okay   Baklava perfectly sweetened delicious   Their red sauce hot few drops enough platter   Their white sauce    OMG best!!! generously poured all over platter! Hahaha  I simplicity menu generous serving sizes the platter 2 meals reasonable prices   The only negative limited seating parking   Other definitely worth checking out   they're even open til late! <EOR> When New York City everyone told needed Halal Guys before leaving  loved then love now Las Vegas! course same little cart New York but pretty good regardless    I gyro massive take rest go  meat full flavor but only thing didn't very much pita bread used  bread very thick making difficult eat gyro because felt eating more pita anything else    Like said definitely same NYC but still pretty tasty  Also if local 10% off !!! <EOR> A poor homage original 53rd 6th NYC   Having original countless times before seems skimpier portions overcooked meats rice more expensive original   Major props expansion across but feels more copycat real deal  <EOR> The Halal guys hype reason in    pictures look amazing reviews great needed taste! While seldom choose meat options traditional gyro meat platter    Well    when first looked platter thinking myself meat looked extremely greasy  made bit nervous    If dining bottles famous sauces bring table    White Sauce kind let down because expected some super tasty garlic y sauce but tasted plain ranch dressing   Red Sauce HOT! give fair warning! am heat connoisseur orders 8 Thai restaurants    stood very well  Its HOT HOT HOT but still tasty  Just eat side only start tiny drizzle!  They Tahini sauce well  Tasted pretty traditional par   So anyway Once whole bowl rockin sauces toppings greasiness meat leveled out  pita serve also kind greasy but oh delicious    They open late its clean inside would definitely recommend eat again  <EOR> Tried place friend Friday night  busy no place sit AC wasn't working well  Besides thinking whatever came food     I ordered Pita wrap combo side order rice bland tasteless  pita thick doughy  meat almost no seasoning whatsoever  Rice tasteless  veggies fresh but again tasteless  Even just tad cilantro lime would've helped  If wasn't white sauce hot sauce that pretty okay wouldn't finished meal    I really wanted place but can't  just another New York chain pop off LV yet impress me  <EOR> Just taste remembered back 53rd 6th! Although portion bit less NYC couple dollars more still best ever have   Don't forget add famous white sauce along bbq sauce if spicy just squeeze bit hot sauce bottle because extremely hot!    They also serve additional side dishes hummus baba ganuosh baklava  Yum!

Wow couldn't believe much bill came need come down price combo salad  stay competition others around town  also need sure dressings kept cool place all empty tables  Thought odd  <EOR> I'm big fan chicken rice unless kababs rice but place good its price! chicken tastes good rice made perfection  <EOR> This menu place similar another local place called Parsley   Mediterranean meat vegetables sauce rice   gyro bowl   really good   large enough bring leftovers home   staff friendly gave head's getting free baklava checking Yelp    again  <EOR> I admit Halal Guys Las Vegas doesn't even come close original location New York City   hype real just here  love NYC location portion size taste price   chicken rice bit dryer bowls smaller price little more   All being said still giving Halal Guys 4 stars   almost since least twice month   honestly say just okay continue Halal fix?  no longer Chicken Rice though   just come chicken lot it     Couple Tips   Service always great Parking nightmare The Falafel great when fresh   Hard nails when not  Protein only bowls range $3 $14   same bowl every time charged different amount almost every time  The White Sauce still bomb  I welcome other restaurants East Coast open Las Vegas   more merrier  <EOR> I've Big Apple but did OG Halal Guys location can't say close OG Vegas location is    all know it    I turned Halal Guys thanks Yelp event bestie Dyanna praising NYC truck offerings    I always combo plate add hella white sauce cause stuff jam stay far away hot sauce  no joke hear    Parking hellish when location first opened but hype died down second location open Strip making bit more chill dine at   Yelp Reviews 2018 6 100 <EOR> The food mediocre best falafel basically hush puppies pita store bought rice completely bland portions small prices outrageous  prepared nickled dimed every little thing  <EOR> Have eaten few times food decent compared others  Still would prefer gyro time <EOR> I tried lower expectations due insane amount hype place albeit New York City original cart but even several visits admit just fan  food just isn't very good    The beef salty all could taste salt salt more salt  guess  sauces but sauce dressing fan  guess sort purist because think if food its core tasty shouldn't drown sauce edible  going here  Heed warnings hot sauce H O T myth  overblown  mess light your butt fire!  The sad pita bread just gross  bread addict even didn't want eat it  sure if made in house but wouldn't surprised if not  nothing fluffy nor fresh nor appetizing it  bad  tomatoes lettuce cheese just your run mill straight off food delivery truck quality    The ONLY good thing plate rice clearly superstar  Flavorful light fluffy worth eating which fortunate because takes majority container ! place expensive portion size meat small costs  don't want pay $10 lunch consists mostly cheap rice!   The employees very friendly competent willing help crunchy falafels tasty vegan option serious vegans beware line workers aren't careful should cross contamination saw lady scooping meat then falafels same utensil     Adding problem subpar food horrendous parking situation  quite literally NOWHERE park  place located very busy Chinatown shopping mall spaces almost always completely filled all day all night making inaccessible place eat takeout  <EOR> Zero stars!!! First time life asked refund! Defiantly food anyone knows Mediterranean food!  Wow can't begin describe awful place is    When should known all food covered hidden shawarma already cut gyro pole covered pita all over    My friend took food before since ordered falafel wait five more minutes sense would gladly wait fresh food but wasn't all fresh! He took plastic wrap    The HIGHLIGHT when asked if white sauce tahini answered don't only mayo! guy preparing food wanted give hummus instead we already paid point cashier started arguing he charge extra    4 falafels already 10 dollars which way much! She started arguing they're suppose give any sauce  point mad told them falafel comes hummus tahini everywhere else  told them ridiculous no alternative mayo  Even extra mayo costs extra there!  They started talking 4 people came back looking confused  All drama spoon hummus    After minute them realizing customer always right asked full refund friend gave them food back out   I've never situation before   So foolish satisfy customer gesture already did awful job everything else   The place empty couldn't customer happy  Ridiculous  <EOR> Picked gyro plate yesterday spent whole night throwing up  Beware! should've known better  store empty meat laying out   RAGRETS!  it didn't even taste good even more upset  <EOR> The legendary New York street food vendor finally arrived Las Vegas  Rejoice!  Even if you've never tried food Halal Guys should require no introduction if follow social media all  must've friend two post photos rave restaurant whether original food cart NYC new outposts wave expansion  able experience them California excited vastly more accessible location last although requires U turn two lefts if you're approaching highway side    I arrived start typical dinner rush hours surprised hardly any wait  standing front powerful A C machine briefly perusing simplest menus anywhere waiting friends arrive own glance menu walked front line ordered food sped way cashier   Combo Platter $9 99 regular size half aluminum tray salad mix other half orange rice turmeric perhaps other spices friends mistook visually cheese rice covered equally chicken gyro  Quick note legendary lamb gyro isn't even available original Halal Guys anymore per multiple reviews beef meat presumably same you'll any locations   After sit down I don't see why you'd wait sink your teeth into right play grab white red sauce bottles then drench your food white sauce  Maybe move pita bread wedges way first but just rich creamy stuff into every bite  Then might try just touch spicy red sauce which legitimately spicy  Squeeze gently!  I must admit wasn't really picking all flavors first perhaps there's basis that  chicken far more coarsely chopped first occasion there's probably less caramelization  Plus peering into open kitchen didn't see chicken grill gyro vertical rotisserie perhaps meats just cooked batches then left linger  employees working huge pot rice though there's that  course baklava would baked ahead time portion seemed small skipped it    However did save leftovers all but most ravenously hungry should some ended devouring them late evening  Maybe palate just wasn't right earlier aside still picking all nuances first time especially sauce rice realizing meat bit dry happy enough leftovers didn't live see dawn another day   Falafel $1 99 2 pc little bit false advertisement considering sign says $1 presumably 1 ball   all fried chickpea balls among better ones flavor  However wasn't impressed texture because little mushy dense inside all crunchy outside  probably because they'd fried long before served just other proteins   Baba Ghanouj $4 99 decently sized tub pita nice spiced flavor surprising smokiness plus discernible vegetable texture  tub comes straight fridge cold  suggest waiting warm enough lose cold temperature's numbing effect taste buds  Although friend's order I'd amiss mention Stefany V right recommend side dish   I'm little disappointed overall but sure back sooner later when craving Halal Guys  Hopefully hit all right notes without forcing wait hours  <EOR> Few items menu but hands down best Mediterranean places to  beef gyro chicken perfectly seasoned cooked first time ate but chicken little dry second time around  always regular combo bowl which consists rice lettuce tomatoes beef gyro chicken pita bread  feel everything mixes well together extremely delicious  1 tip all newcomers use ton white sauce  calorie intake definitely worth it! <EOR> Amazing! glad don't travel NYC some Halal Guys  Yes exactly same experience cart but definitely does come close definitely does satisfy late night cravings  glad open til 4am great night drinking town   I love combo platters  chicken beef combo amazing top seasoned rice tomatoes lettuce extra extra white sauce  love getting red sauce side monitor spice  portions very generous well always leftovers next day    Great location heart Chinatown  Fast service great food open til 4am  Definitely check place out  favorites definitely repeat customer  <EOR> With all craze opening Halal Guys adamant coming grab bite eat falling love locations both New York southern California   Located same lot Krung Siam Izakaya Starbucks finding parking during lot's busier hours pose quite challenge  many parking spaces available lot itself quite small   Walking restaurant very small very many seating  line moves quick  menu giant print letters above where place your order could choose many items sell  looks provide same choices other locations visited  order first watch made then pay end   I ordered combo platter  two sizes only dollar apart  However smaller size more enough myself finish  comes salad pita bread rice beef chicken  Portion control something work on  Also noticed salad dominated platter location  Though appreciate them helping eat healthier don't think would pay almost $10 soggy lettuce mushy tomatoes    As everyone says don't forget load white sauce! can't much  However careful red sauce HOT  little long way  However even sauces piled onto entire platter meats dry rice hard borderline stale   Thinking just bottom barrel first time visited returned again week later give place another shot  Sadly just dry   Service needs lot work  first time gone lot confusion over order  did think took 5 people ask order  next time visited witnessed female workers yelling customer front me  someone worked multiple hospitality jobs no way treat customer  Especially asked no more question beforehand  appalled  However couple workers beaming personalities smiles saving grace  Though understand joint new still working itself customer service should lacking much did   As someone fell love Halal Guys New York deeply disappointed location  Hopefully more tweaks time updating review raving awesome place is  But right now think just wait until next trip coasts visit Halal Guys  Though Sin City sinning Halal Guys anytime soon  <EOR> 2 5 stars    It underwhelming regards flavor presentation  foil container food served fine but food itself left wanting really back unless 2 am area looking something veggie like eating junk food before bedtime In experience 2 orders falafel chicken entree  first falafel ready but second prepared  No problem down fresh food  issue when eventually food 2 fresh falafel balls 3 them completely dry old  friend 3 stale falafel balls  gave mine because felt bad flavorless stale old ones seemed be  itself sucks because first time first impression failed far    I don't think sauces anything exciting either   anyway  main purpose white sauce seems balance extremely unbalanced overly hot spice red sauce  sure history sauce itself but if pleasant eat then what's point ?  It literally uncomfortably spicy delicious well would thing  opinion delicious  Nothing could wash down either  Just hot hot hot  Honestly handle fair amount heat but just tasted tho made properly    The rest plate pretty whack too  stated other reviewers rice served entrees strangely dry unseasoned  There's flavorless overly watery tomatoes some bland iceberg lettuce  culture eaters  If original anything I'd stoked but all felt phoned speak  Just checking off boxes but following through proper flavor balance    Along side all seating comfortable if more 2 people your party  Tables close constantly being bumped other tables while people just trying sit down  overall space restaurant crammed just whack   I know semi new area but when asked questions sauces food staff member said hadn't food sauces yet        ??? Anyway if ever again ask fresh made falafel ask pray just fluke  $36 2 meals 2 drinks no happy  Dry falafel unforgivable when main menu item  Please fix guys!   Happy Eating ! <EOR> Foods always fresh hot made quality ingredients priced right! sauces very good too  I'd recommend place anyone to go orders great spot dine in because when chopping meats stove incredibly loud nearly deafening point where can't conversation lol  Also line take while if its more 3 4 people then usually don't wait  Another reason why doing to go usually better option! <EOR> Oh god  Whoever brought vegas most smartest most coolest person book  such fond memories hometown NYC gyro stands  wistfully look back remember walking all way 76th 34 ave  Just gyro would all way back sit park near home eat gyro  remember every break during shift looking forward gyro plate  never taste gyro vegas gyros back home  Thanks halal guys  fed maybe 17 times far month alone! <EOR> I didn't but ordered postmates  pretty decent  combo platter which chicken gyro meat rice lettuce tomato pita bread  also came side white sauce some hot sauce    First off hot sauce no joke  expecting something along lines Taco Bell del Taco level hot sauce     nope     some serious kick! nose running need drink type heat  really good though  those sauces  heat no taste  want jar it   The platter itself pretty good  rice way over cooked but also could being container 30min while being delivered  white sauce helps moisten everything   Overall almost taco salad  expected but definitely eat again! <EOR> I've tried halal guys Costa Mesa streets Midtown Manhattan store UWS NY boyfriend excited hear opening location Vegas and plus off strip in Chinatown because wouldn't deal parking strip   came few days grand opening still getting AC situation sorted out    meant NO AC    no ice drink dispenser basically dying   We when first halal guys reminiscent trip NY  beef gyro chicken combo sandwich he combo rice platter  staff really nice talk through if you're unfamiliar set warn red sauce etc etc  arrived just RIGHT before lunch rush grabbed last two bar seats against wall    Overall food good but if you've ever tasted halal guys cart just same when prepared restaurant! both finished meal there's no denying good  <EOR> Opening Day wasn't bad thought especially being first time actually going foodie opening day anything  Halal Guys located near start Chinatown plaza next Krung Siam Thai Starbucks Pokeman  Upon arrival parking definitely limited but lucky find spot nearby instead across street  waiting line decent especially around 10 30 11 00am+ wasn't massively packed  Employees offered small water bottles while waited under white tents within comfort fans mists hospitality aspect there  gave away branded restaurant shirts low key advertisements various sizes small extra large  also DJ next entrance bring vibe while hungry customers waited patiently line    When finally entering restaurant its actually quite small compact slightly humid   smell aroma foods rather strongly closer ordering  friends ordered while saved waited table dine since more knowledgeable menu tried New York    They combo platter which consisted chicken beef rice lettuce tomatoes pita  did soft pita bread hungry biting onto definitely heavenly  Chicken beef bit dry unless doused white sauce which added decent flavor meal whole  really wish generous tomatoes though portion seemed rather small but perhaps am just biased because love tomatoes lol  hot sauce definitely weak those typically order just mild spicy things skimped when tasted smidge ends fork heed caution!! friend platter drowned hot sauce bravely finished despite having red face full sweat refilling fountain drink thrice row haha!! Ahh forgot hummus maybe come back again try that    Overall decent experience opening day  would honestly only come if crave middle eastern cheap eats  feel if really want heighten experience though would actually try gyro food cart New York its fast paced industrial area better weather  <EOR> I've heard many tales glorious  'white sauce'   and must say pretty yummy!

Especially white sauce but today little different  Idk if because busy anymore but meat doesn't taste fresh  biting into few bites would encounter very dry hard piece  flavor still though still finished small platter   I'm totally down give another try 3rd time's charm   <EOR> After long day travel last thing wanted find something eat  purusing Uber Eats came across Halal Guys looking forward trying ever since saw them Munchies  ordered Chicken Combo plates  rice chicken definitely different any halal plate plus white sauce helped kick some dryness  I'd steer away having pita containers very soggy time delivered  just happened ordered side very warm delicious  <EOR> I usually love eat halal guys because food good service quick  However tonight's service just point  took over 30 minutes order line look unorganized chaotic  come back next time?

no onion Gyro anything without onion? When he told no onion said ok need wash hands back  thought needed cut some onion but when food no onion  Sauce packets basically poison soy high sodium other chemicals which assume entire menu does  Hot Sauce no joke Thai food your head sweat hot goodness  $2 69 16oz soda? need check food quality prices  <EOR> This absolutely best halal restaurant town  Gyro Time held standard gyros but location always issue   Along question halal? spite lack lamb gyros Halal Guys fresh tasty huge   abundance white sauce reason dine location   noticed number take out orders going door doing visits sign must place be  food staff extremely friendly cheerful  bad aren't allowed tips  think going them all some cookies holidays   Women's bathroom clean spacious   Enough room dog's stroller wide end  dining area another issue obviously most people don't know eat gyros  Especially crowd comes competition slobs  hope no else store when come nasty scene   No shade Halal Guys staff  <EOR> I've eaten few times now  first time really good but every time since then sick  Managers oblivious customer complaints  combo meal 2 big bones them the size quarters when paid $27 00 2 combo plates 2 small drinks  Nobody answers phone can't leave message    I can't believe place allowed open without AC July August Vegas! Now signs saying replace AC units next week! Signs longer that! Employees getting breaks heard manager Rene screaming employees! saw 4 quit once  cool! together! Employees friendly despite hostile HOT work environment  Customers pay attention treat your employees! why refuse shop Walmart    I don't china town location either  Hot small getting food only logical option  agree Rachel F 's review    Maybe try again future but many other places first AC! <EOR> Whether Cali Nevada Halal Guys way go  Nevada let squirt all those sauces yourself your heart content! <EOR> I loved feel addicted   typical white sauce usual Mediterranean places different taste may expect   However delicious   prefer dine much want     Heed other reviews tell HOT SAUCE HOT    Did say HOT    little tiny dab deadly     Somebody please take back Halal Guys today everyday    Don't forget Yelp check free Baklava <EOR> This those looks better restaurants    made sick  could hotter inside restaurant outside   eating hot food   plus hot sauce doesn't taste Mediterranean all   its just hot! spicy but Habanero sauces aren't hot sauce   tiny water cups didnt help either   its 4 ounces   luckily only food even little hot rice   pita bread cold   falafels cold   wasn't worth 10 bucks   even close   am sad spent 10 bucks food   although hungry craving good food still there    so    also advised seating almost non existent   if party more 4 people go   only 12 customers some them wating spot open up  if just eat suggest call order go    if want far superior mediterranean food would suggest Philly Steak Express Fort Apache   food fresh there   Halal guys before hand sits    gets cold    won't going back  <EOR> This fast food places go  Quality taste absolutely perfect  Everything flavorful plus staff fast friendly  am never dissapointed  <EOR> This place really good if love mediterranean food  service also amazing!!! <EOR> Been few times since first visit     Last time came rice tasted old   Texture off   asked white sauce girl working covered whole bowl sauce  tell stop because just much!   Also getting without salad because its just cheap filler   I leftovers last visit which never around eating because grossed old rice sauciness    I think next time chickpeas  They better quality meat rice salad portions double price  <EOR> I guess if food truck street New York I'd rave New Yorkers easily impressed which may case   Jets    But food best OK  Limited menu reflecting food truck roots    set similar Chipotle but without food poisoning    Very limited seating but counter seats several outlets charging phones tablets that's nice feature    Parking kind tight but  nothing new any shopping centers Spring Mountain     Would back?  Only if friend wanted try it   Would recommend it?  Sure bad just great  <EOR> The dishes described impossible know comes order  $11 ended platter mostly lettuce tomato 3 pieces falafel small pita hummus  No rice included plate  guess should ordered falafel platter but supposed know? good value  <EOR> Ordered combo platter chicken gyro disappointed! Love white sauce! careful hot sauce because pretty dang spicy  use sparingly  Honestly whole group ordering everyday trip Vegas  now fourth day lol pretty halal guy'd but show pretty tasty  Whether you're eating fresh microwaving later still tastes really good  know stop again before leaving take some togo friends family  Definitely must try if you're Vegas! ordered restaurant well ordering Uber eats satisfied food ordering both  <EOR> I honestly say impressed ever  hyped hearing word mouth but damn disappointment       the meat wasn't fresh off gyro rotisserie instead cooked oil stove top  floor kitchen freaking dirty disgusting    there food all over counter tops where separation suppose be     the only thing fresh tomatoes lettuce  gyro meat sitting oil chicken chewy     the white sauce good but other something missing spices wise  <EOR> Food subpar beef minced unlike meat NYC  Wanted place much NYC location no bueno garbage    <EOR> Did live hype? Slightly    meat good well seasoned rice cooked nicely white sauce amazing However believe meat overcooked  Some bits dry just pita bread  location tiny barely fit anyone inside place  You'll squeeze through everything  ALSO BEWARE RED SAUCE  underestimated added toooo much lowkey died  <EOR> Not fan  Did good service  Not fav fast food Mediteranean restaurant  <EOR> Been New York Costa Mesa location personal favorite  Decided visit noticed huge difference no line! Odd     combo plate while beef gyro fresh pulled chicken back already cooked  course tasted old stale   it would nice if fresh chicken  Anyway no wonder empty here <EOR> I'm long time vegetarian love falafel sandwiches which dozens times restaurants around country   In area already stopped around 4 30PM grand opening day      They're located small strip mall lucky find parking spot quickly  think some buzz place ends parking should problem other lot being kind narrow   As expected opening day place pretty busy but thanks rather limited menu 10 minutes    All staff very friendly expect now they're probably better knowing what's what   I ordered two falafels white sauce other hot sauce    cautioning everyone hot sauce really hot very glad suggested just give packet instead them putting second falafel!    The falafel sandwich consists 3 4 meatball sized falafels bed chopped lettuce diced tomatoes wrapped taco like pita bread then small drizzle whatever sauce want packets extra sauce 99 cents    Not liking tomatoes mine without   The price two $17 something   No drink anything else included    scenic location no ambience anything else special inside place maybe just old cheap bastard but find pricing very high    Remember falafel  mostly ground chick peas lettuce in fact  think put little much lettuce cheap 'filler' sandwich   pricing might normal NYC would LV Strip but location at   Falafels very little flavor   Most places season them paprika garlic onions something but place doesn't      Most other places gotten falafels onions add lettuce tomato  obviously onions add lot flavor    place doesn't seemed onions all    white sauce came falafel sandwich just very light drizzle probably equivalent half teaspoon full   enough especially when white sauce doesn't really lot flavor it     Thankfully part grand opening two packets white sauce hot sauce     give falafel any sort flavor used whole packet white sauce just dumb white sauce packet 99 cent option when reality requirement give sandwich even modicum flavor   Sadly even then falafel sandwich Halal Guys just OK   Part reason even OK simply because hadn't falafel sandwich while   Later opened hot sauce packet   Many foodies accustomed sauces described hot  spicy really being neither but only hot sauce truly very hot but also somewhat different flavor it   glad sampled hot sauce via drop finger instead pouring second falafel sandwich because don't really flavor yeah know but least being consistent    even if did would little hot eat when you've back work couple hours      So bottom line due lack flavor also lack value price doubt back unless falafel sandwich craving late night  AWESOME place apparently open until 4AM!!!   Hopefully last   For owner doubt you'll lower your pricing initial buzz dies if profits aren't matching your business plan please think including small drink bag chips bring better value least falafel sandwiches!    Also more vegetable options onions give some actual flavor falafel sandwiches   Your lamb dishes might taste great good value but falafels don't aren't     I'm happy write such review  really hoping find great new falafel place  open late but aforementioned reasons currently aren't me  <EOR> Oh PLACE!! Yeeeessss puulleeeaasssee! Delicious fault! Leaves full craving more! <EOR> I just found place off post mates decided come instead!! glad did!!

Once inside another line but pretty quick tons meat cooking staff ready serve large crowds  line wrapped around tent once lucky crowd again    I chose combo gyro platter try both meats  Seating limited taken anyways took go  Each order serves two packets famous white sauce small but mighty hot sauce  cold water bag skipped soft drink didn't plan stay eat because tables chairs taken said but time paid table opened son able sit down enjoy lunch instead car which gave chance feed son seal approval    The rice didn't much flavor but tender soft  beef chicken beef favorite two but chicken very tender  Smother white sauce you're heaven but very careful hot sauce  spicy but super hot put small amount side tried before poured all over food  glad did because man sauce no joke! Luckily put some chicken aside son along pita bread which he loved  Luckily girls opened store asked doing same helped outside helped bring high chair table said wasn't expecting hot sauce hot wished ordered drink but line just Long didn't want rude cut she gave lemonade  mom child appreciate small things especially making wait line again drink because when children everything tad more complicated  don't know your name but if you're reading appreciate helping more know helping outside helping sit bringing high chair midst craziness busy store appreciate more know!   Staff super nice kept great attitude through busy chaos all day  Seating parking limited would recommend taking stay if you're lucky enough score table barstool!  I heard few people say social beef minced original New York stand way better but can't compare never tried  When OG Halal guys halfway across country beggars can't choosers sure satisfy your craving  They're open late sure hip spot all party people close strip but sure would've done great anywhere  Welcome Vegas Halal guys! <EOR> Greasy max NO flavor small portions price!!!

Think people  <EOR> Contrary popular belief Halal guys horrible  anyone actually knows real Mediterranean food tastes it  Totally Americanized great quality  meat wasn't bad but strangely reminiscent tacos  sure why white sauce them famous literally just some blend mayo ranch  asked if tzaziki sauce she no idea said white sauce same thing  definitely Greek yogurt cucumber dip  Haha    Also prices way expensive mediocre quality  two combo plates side hummus 27 dollars  most plate consisted iceberg lettuce diced tomato rice Eg cheap filler   salad no dressing service also subpar  cashier nice but everyone else behind counter rude didn't even simple order correct  menu small  Definitely disappointed  <EOR> How lame  place nothing NYC cart  ain't complaining though   am still paying small portions higher price authentic experience   actually doesn't even taste very middle eastern either   getting combo platter half chicken beef   favorite sauce combo white sauce + bbq sauce   red sauce spiciest condiments ever very cautious one   Baklava decent sweet  Falafel also pretty good too! customer service always excellent here  Never worry long lines here   limited seating but usually no problem since take go  <EOR> Honestly does taste combo platters back East just maybe grade worse I'd say  Definitely quite good can't really point finger why   It slightly more expensive don't much food but if you're craving Halal Guys type Mediterranean good spot your fix   Just keep your expectations low   That said workers SUPER friendly place decently nice   It's definitely spot re visit club when hungry  <EOR> First time trying popular fast food chain chinatown Las Vegas  Food just good but nothing really special place  Love pita bread  super soft good when dipping hummus  <EOR> Great service employee Johnnie very helpful great customer service need promote employee! tell all friends place can't wait back  <EOR> Love place!  work right down street come often  great low carb options   Basically just ask no rice pita nice keto salad   white sauce zero carbs DELICIOUS   I'm also huge fan spicy food red sauce no joke   actually hot even me   The staff cool very accommodating   all time! <EOR> If you've Halal Guys off streets NYC then we'll you've already exposed heavenly flavor!!! yelper all experience small chipotle walk through middle eastern touch wasn't same stand line seems endless only your food your business  Oh let steer wrong chicken isn't same  point beggars can't chooser though guys    Drum roll must try especially if you've never been!!   Don't eat without white sauce  Don't knock until try it  seating limited  Don't skip hot sauce mean really hot but worth it  can't wait back once lines settle down course  <EOR> I've location couple times  food good but price portions really small  think food good white sauce  better Bay Area but Vegas nice place dine at  Well dine but take away because really limited seating  just wish would serve enough food last more few bites  would rather nice sit down restaurant pay little more come here   If just wraps sandwich  better choice then bowl  <EOR> Maybe fault   I heeded warnings previous posts hot sauce being spicy only applied few drops it    But few drops didn't add enough heat unleashed packet included order   It made whole thing inedible   I tried stirring all thinking perhaps would lessen heat but nah    Had throw out  The white sauce? I don't understand hype  I wish tzatziki sauce instead  The only thing memorable sauce don't ever care eat again  The free baklava delicious though  That worthy bringing ranking two stars  I am looking forward firehole leave crippled  <EOR> I've tried Halal Guys Philippines total disappointment  Finally try first time tastes way better  mom would always tell good place when she New York back then    I'm total fan Middle Eastern food platters worth money  personal favorite beef gyro platter also able request extra protein order  <EOR> If you've never Halal Guys New York City then place just alright mediocre best  If you've NYC don't even try it  trying mean harsh  simple truth  Before opened craved street halal ALWAYS  Now Vegas' version and yes am local don't crave ever because rather just until right big apple    I want say preparation  When order street carts throw grill your food nice hot  meat warmers if you're Chiptole  simply same  flavor same  if you're expecting your food drenched sauce NYC won't be   Don't wrong though  still better other fast food places  just par expectations original street halal carts caused have  don't know if fault branch's fault but wish could better  Super anticlimactic when excited finally try opened Vegas  Darn  <EOR> Love it!  Cesar Q  hunt bite eat close work   heard much hype Halal Guys decided time swing by   We opted 2 regular size chicken platters side hummus   food actually really good   cannot complain however rather expensive $27 fast food type meal bit pricey   place comes NYC charging NYC   Service point   3 staff members encountered friendly jovial  While white sauce tasty would suggest LOOK CALORIES FAT CONTENT   Holy Mother of    it's meal itself   Would eat again? Yes   Would eat if diet? Yes would just forgo bomb ass white sauce   All all meal could considered healthy sans white stuff can't off mind  <EOR> Halal Guys opened Vegas right time  having real thing NYC last February thought I'd only able if back  Since then Halal Guys started opening CA other parts country  Vegas lucky enough put map Halal Guys!    I recommend having Gyro beef Combo beef chicken platter  comes fixing meat choice rice diced tomato lettuce  Listen workers say sauce! never much white sauce but careful red sauce  Even if spicy kind person couple drops red sauce trick   After having gone few times unfortunately must say quality service consistent  however doesn't stop trying again since brings back NYC! don't think ever taste same same feeling having outside long day walking Manhattan  <EOR> The hype hype hype    unfortunately  all hype heard people talking place best new York open cali all cali friends said great well large combo platter rice 1 5 stars gyro meet 3 stars best chicken biggest disappointment pulled chicken don't pull chicken middle east white sauce chicken would dry 1 star 5 now reason give place 4 5 stars Falafel falafel solid 5 5 stars best falafel ever fast food joint If wasn't falafel sauce would most likely never come back <EOR> During first visit food really fresh  Meats juicy flavorful  time around chicken very dry  lettuce tomatoes bit lifeless  Fortunately famous white sauce saved meal  only took 1 1 2 packs white sauce trick  Just beware red sauce good packs mighty punch  thought would similar Louisiana Hot Sauce but whole other level  never experienced heat before! Portions generous you'll full hours come   Note sure check Yelp receive your free baklava  <EOR> Thrilled town now!  NY Halal Guys many places miss but  changed!  location parking lot bit tight but plan accordingly when prime time lunch    Each time probably three dozen times point place order ease waited no more few minutes ready!  Staff friendly   rice falafel always flavorful crisp tasty   Yes even without sauce which known for portion perfect size pita always crispy  <EOR> While am glad see Halal Guys doing well expanding CA now Vegas food still favorite  The prices descent portions but meats just very good  Still cannot decide which less chicken dark meat beef rather dry mix both seemed best  The white sauce pure mayo would much prefer garlic yogurt type sauce red very spicy but needed cut thickness mayo  Not bad but also worth returning for  <EOR> Been more once! white sauce addicting!! go to order falafel lettuce tomato pita bread  very filling delicious  staff friendly service efficient  <EOR> I came back tried again Showed around 8 PM place 1 table customers   Again remember NYC place lines till 4 am   I combo plate without tomatoes real new yorker  The guy loaded plate lettuce gave scoop half rice asked little more rice?  he says would dollar more    LOL  First off whole dish RICE DISH bed rice  MY plate literally half salad   Like keep saying guys don't right don't care much claim original  guys don't right shows now hype over people hardly show up   Part NY carts good business good food fresher   plates also bigger don't feel cheated someway   You guys other hand try give people full salad much much smaller plate   Then offer caramelized onions jalepenos olives end?  Am subway?  Be honest if any relation true NY cart would know  They charge 9 dollars per plate twice portions  You guys charge more half     But most infuriating food isn't even same   even if claim things little differently ITS WORKING theres no customers    so stop making excuses MR Manager  <EOR> Fast service great eats' more ask for  Dining area small but if all want scoot then place you  <EOR> I always wanted try food cart every time New York but when line always ridiculous  friend came visit she yelp noticed location  must fairly new because super clean! If check free baklava which tip worker much appreciated!! We shared combo regular size which chicken beef gyro all fixing  drinks white red sauce put much want  careful red sauce because extremely spicy! white sauce amazing!!! Combined platter sauce side hummus    died gone heaven!   Only thing wish could improve pitas    just pitas little bit crunch but  generally personal preference nothing establishment  <EOR> This little dive delicious mind eveytime drive down I15  Its open 24 7 priced amazing  always chicken gyro combo but someday sandwich seen them made  Biggest Gyro LV! reward plan local dicounts  Everything combo plate great veggies rice BOTH meats! If never looking satisfying trendy New York style plate food  should no further! Best olives also! Winner! need expand Las Vegas! <EOR> I've few times prior  when did Yelp Elite event where treated platter signature Halal Guys goodness    Whenever would visit NYC would always visit Halal Guys cart  Nothing beats getting yummy street eats even better when you're standing middle winter getting plate piping fresh hot food  ecstatic when found expanding  even Costa Mesa location week opened  Alas stores never original but still happy could to  Plus they're opened until late late! if need late night grub spot    sort of    The Halal Guys famous lamb over rice platters  But you're able chicken over rice even combo over rice  typically stick chicken over rice nowadays  lamb over rice essentially Gyro meat over rice  Gyro meat particular establishment little bit oily side sure if same recipe cart  chicken notice lot franchise places don't cut chicken into same small pieces original cart does  You'll occasionally find huge chunk chicken your platter    What enjoy location compared Costa Mesa sauce station  able put much sauce want  No else does you  typically put lot white sauce lot red sauce well  careful red sauce  NO joke  If think eat spicy think again  Don't squeeze crazy red bottle unless know spicy get  Without sauce platter nothing don't give whole healthy lot fat line  If your platter to go usually give two packets white sauce packet red sauce  typically    sauce station squeeze much want into platter then leave    There also upcharge $1 if want extra rice  usually skip veggies them put extra rice because pile half platter lettuce  mean didn't come Halal Guys eat salad  if platter mine it'll run $10 99    Overall pretty decent place  still miss original  ingredients definitely more fresh cart because turn over rate much higher  also give more food cart  pack platter full! However location still okay  sauces point definitely recipe  would still come if craving Halal Guys  definitely saves cost plane ticket NYC  <EOR> Having original location New York really excited hear come town  Unfortunately sadly disappointed   When first arrived place hoping same freshly cooked meats fluffy rice NYC  instead plate dried out rice reheated chicken which lacked flavor  am sure if over prepped food day trying rid happened but nothing tried made want back    Lastly number people 4 including two trash floor more dirty tables expected  guess wait until next visit New York real deal again  <EOR> It's time guys made way Vegas! anticipating arrival months now bet begged Hubby take Halal Guys Grand Opening   We've both tried food different locations but first time together Aww!   decided small platter beef gyro  Although prefer chicken felt obligated order gyro since staple Mediterranean cuisine  glad did since tasty! Hubby's chicken platter equally delicious   I made previous mistake overdoing hot sauce  poor tongue didn't stand chance  time around made sure only put couple drops sucker  Paired famous white sauce Kalamata olives bell peppers lettuce tomatoes rice pita beef gyro absolute perfection!  While others seem rather critical say loved it  Sure AC temporarily broken prices little steep but you're getting substantial amount oh satisfying food  generous Halal Guys even provided free water bottles complimentary white red sauce Grand Opening   all extra sauce could dream minus extra  99 cost!  For best both worlds good idea order popular Combo Platter both chicken beef gyro  crowds insane also probably good idea wait hype die down another visit  just don't know if Halal cravings allow so  <EOR> I haven't Halal Guys since NYC back 2011? Damnn can't remember   This straight drunk food hangover food    Gyro Beef Rice Platter EXTRA white sauce but careful hot sauce  Just drop ALL need  warned  just does taste better left overs??

Ask extra delicious! <EOR> Came during lunch  Ordered combo platter  First time here     The meat tasty distinct flavor  felt white sauce complimented flavor meat well  Without white sauce meat would probably bit dry side   Rice tasty pita bread  Very unique flavor    Knocking star off because seating arrangement  restaurant handful tables few stools  staff directing patrons where sit wasn't hectic but see being problem during really busy times    Staff very friendly seemed attentive    As far portions they're huge ! normal platter very filling lots meat  Definitely good bang your buck    Overall food delicious  Glad guys Vegas  words Arnold 'I'll back   <EOR> Every time New York City average more halal meal day but always just random carts Manhattan Brooklyn I'd never made Halal Guys' NYC outposts  naturally pretty excited them opening Vegas   It just didn't live hype  Almost every gyros street New York better one   The best part red sauce  warned spicy  generally thumb nose other people consider spicy dumped red sauce all over sandwich  kind spicy hits punch stomach   The pita fluffy but stiff    The meat which chopped finely taco meat bland  wasn't nearly enough it  sandwich pretty much all tomatoes   But unforgivable sin? white sauce  legendary Halal Guys white sauce freaking mayonnaise  thought going some variation tzatziki but spiced mayonnaise   I always saw Halal Guys' using slogan different  Putting mayo gyros different all right   I wish liked more  <EOR> Not good expected  Everyone told New York LA locations seemed very enthused but combo meal just did meet hype told me  bad but just great  Everything seems little dry somewhat bland  <EOR> This first time trying Halal Guys even though walked original stand NYC multiple times during travels  came day before grand opening ordered two regular combo platters baklava  platter comes two packs white sauce pack red sauce  drizzling pack white sauce over platter mixed entire bowl because hear  New Yorkers eat rush on the go  food tasted great  having few bites definitely felt needed little more white sauce reaching second pack  Just warning red sauce extremely spicy  Before drizzling your food definitely try bit first  platter may seen just enough portion surface but actually wasn't able finish entire bowl! Ate little more half stuffed  $10 regular combo definitely enough two meals me  However baklava quite small portion $2 50    The restaurant space pretty small  There's four tables each seats four small high top bar table against wall seats couple more  type food meant taken honestly small space isn't bad  hope fix air conditioning soon! service good very fast efficient  great experience trying food first time  definitely see myself coming back more during lunch! <EOR> Great sized platter price  always combo platter but halfway through always wish gyro beef    chicken good find gyro more flavorful  Great staff friendly helpful throughout stay  Used yelp check free dessert  Baklava little sweet but didn't stop eating it  Water machine stopped dispensing water which little weird but deterrent coming again soon  Also great late night food pickup delivered  <EOR> This restaurant definitely best grab n go food find all Las Vegas  eating place couple years now never fails disappoint visited Halal guys both New York L A  well honestly say consistency service among different branches truly amazing  would recommend future customers lamb Gyro platter along world famous white sauce!
