Genius ! Especially since none side town    It hard choice between place N but ultimately decided Pho since trying places haven't tried before  came 4 tables occupied  week opening doors nice see them picking business  greeted seated immediately recieved menus upon sitting  waitress Jan looked very young but very professional super friendly drinks super quick  already knew trying pho choices easy    Upon going over menu noticed some items scratched sharpie  If owner would menus redone those items taken off  Looks bit tacky but place still working menu probably going through trial error no biggy  surprised tendon menu  am simple girl always rare steak  Sometimes switch brisket rare steak but boyfriend likes pho all meats including tendon  why asked  She informed they're still working menu   All pho size  no worrying small large  If you're extra hungry maybe just order extra noodoo  it  Noodoo  Lol !   Spring rolls came first quick      Spring rolls Charsui Shrimp noodles lettuce basil wrapped rice paper  Really fresh shrimp wasn't shrimpy  Other places where felt shrimp shrimpier yes made word fresh flavor it  Everything wasn't tightly packed premade sitting fridge while  Peanut sauce yummy ! 4 5 stars   Every place different broth  Overall broth good flavor piping hot comforting  slightly sweet flavor noticed  sweet though    P6 Pho beef balls brisket flank generous portion meat noodles    P2 Pho rare steak  Call plain jane but enjoy simple bowl pho rare steak extra cilantro green onion  definitely put enough meat  Other places finished meat left only noodles broth  finished noodles first which means probably could added more but stil plenty beef left  asked extra cilantro green onion because just wasn't enough liking    We also ordered egg rolls but soup came which should ordered first  egg rolls came 6  Piping hot crispy  Could came more lettuce daikon but ok  Also lettuce pieces should tad but bigger because some pieces did fit around egg roll hard eat  boyfriend eats them without lettuce enough    If live side Henderson area give place try  Fixed pho craving left happy  still working kinks but gotta give them credit  pho'd ! <EOR> Broth sucks  Meat portions extremely small  1 whole meatball cut 4 times?

No questions whether questions?  menu very redundant nothing sounded appealing       After sitting while realizing bad idea walked Jack Box instead   Again hostess server child seemed unfazed if may happened once twice before    Oh well    <EOR> After nice hike Wetlands Park decided stop noon Satuday  closest Pho place where live hoping would place visit frequently   Located Walmart shopping area Boulder Hwy near intersection Nellis  Its northern part shopping area  mention only because sign made try southern area first    The restaurant very nice clean  Seating maybe 40  young man front taking orders  almond milk tea bowl Pho rare beef brisket  $8 50  No small large bowl choice    The pho came fast almond milk tea request again because missed original order  broth fairly weak maybe because just opened hadn't chance gain full flavor  end bowl flavor improved  Good amount noodles meat   Its best Pho town  Its worst  Service ok lady runs owns very nice  lot Grub Hub orders saw least 6 when there  <EOR> Seems family run business which most pho restaurants  young boy seated served no character  Almost robot like  older sister came later actually seemed she knew she doing  But all reviews Asian restaurants never based customer service    So far food barely any pieces steak tendon broth tasted almost black licorice like  Price wise average $8 small bowl  Vietnamese iced coffee good but can't really mess much  hoping home run place since its close house but sorely disappointed  Guess gotta keep trekking across town find perfect pho  <EOR> Well unfortunate leave updated review less stars before but place earned it  mentioned before pho bad but comes down customer service  obviously family owned business being said think away racist remarks being unprofessional customers    I called order pick upon arriving desk cashier made clear she owner's daughter having unprofessional conversation customer  She looked said Um help you? told picking she replies Picking what? told she asked if spoke mother phone which replied wasn't sure she made joke Asian accents while other customer just stood there  She said she away because she's Asian white people can't because considered racist    It's stupid even explain unprofessional dumb look representing your family's business  girl just seemed she lot pent aggression  Last time come here  just mind numbing deal with  <EOR>
