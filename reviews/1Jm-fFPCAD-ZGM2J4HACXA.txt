We staying Luxor figured would try buffet  Big mistake   the food gross much variety salad bar looked veggies since previous night    The only good thing buffet server nice attentive  <EOR> My family always enjoyed buffet eat whenever visit Las Vegas   We glad kept Egyptian decor even changed name MORE  <EOR> Let tell came eat terrible place     twice   give 1 5 stars because least didn't burst into flames eating meal   My first real trip Vegas came around 21st birthday   Day way   wandering around lost ended Luxor moseyed into Pharoah's Buffet   Terrible   Simply terrible   bad began question very idea Buffets Vegas   people talking if terrible?  Why would people intentionally food sub Golden Corral quality?  Well luckily found first awful Vegas buffet experience exception rule   Now flash forward five plus years   am back Vegas business trip decide hit Blue Man Group show which time Luxor   over hotel hour spare realize we're starving   combination time bit alcohol wandered second time life into Phabulous Pharoah's Pheast Buffet   Phorget it   making mistake third time   Time healed wound  <EOR> I some friends staying Luxor which allowed sample nauseating vertigo inclinators almost as nauseating experience buffet   Mayhap hit bad day but goodness just good all   friends stoked whole Vegas buffet experience but should steered them better direction   Everything looked it'd sitting under heat lamps hours unfortunately tasted too   usually put away quite bit buffet but managed only two trips   last purely dessert because hey even bad dessert good right?  Wrong   I'm pretty sure won't revisiting this <EOR> Rest assured no Egyptian food anything close it   once saw them serving falafel dinner nearly freaked   Other nothing overly unique classic Las Vegas style buffet   There two main lines serve essentially same things each side   decor consistent rest Luxor sand colors all over place walls made wannabe stone   only thing they're really missing bits sand dust falling ceiling   didn't feel pharaoh based way staff treated me   prices king like mere $25 could enjoy din din   Breakfast better deal sure its little less $15   The food good surprisingly incredible abundant but hardly step your average buffet any casinos   Its very bizarre hang pizza section where its tossed front while walking around feasts Egypt   feast usually limited Mexican Italian general American cuisine   nothing exotic enough mention other fact hash browns fabulous during breakfast time   Then again Pyramid Cafe upstairs  <EOR> Very decent buffet strip  Cool Egyptian theme clever name better Hometown Buffet  second time much better food cycled quicker wasn't wait  Definitely better buffets tried Vegas  <EOR> Decent place come breakfast cuz pretty hard mess breakfast  wouldn't come any other meal  traditional American stuff all you can eat Denny's IHOP  <EOR> There problem when only thing find appetizing all buffet tortillas but alas  happened when few weeks ago  Carnitas weren't bad but tough stringy tasty way  potatoes shriveled cold while pancaky things more thing pancake  least think so    The service OK some champagne Orange Juice which far warm even old stand bys let done  couple bites Corned Beef Hash bad  licking salt lick mouth full salt pork  did half enjoy fried rice plain rice gave carbohydrate feul gambling ahead    Not good  <EOR> Pharoah's Pheast Buffett $14 medium sized buffett two stations each  Located first floor towards Mandalay Place   Feels pharoahs tomb  <EOR>
