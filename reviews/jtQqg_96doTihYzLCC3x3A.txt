Worst drive thru ever! only car literally took 20 mins order  Then 15 mins pay food  happened twice already   Very upsetting! <EOR> If could put no stars would  Everything mess nothing cleaned  feel dirty when in  DON'T THERE!! <EOR> GO JACK IN THE BOX INSTEAD    I wish could say something nice location  trying find value Carl's Jr  more 20 years!   Tonight coupon Buy free Famous Star  asked extra lettuce tomatoes  charged 60 cents lettuce 60 cents tomatoes two hamburgers    I happy when meal  lettuce amount would consider should  regular Famous Star    Each hamburger two tomatoes   Wow! generous    I asked more tomatoes lettuce  No luck  manager would rather lose longtime customer rather give two slices tomatoe  Very short sighted customer service    I guess don't really customers satisfaction    So event mind would recommend going Jack in the Box across street MUCH BETTER VALUE lot cheaper    If stop eating Carl's Jr maybe they'll hint develop little common sense regarding value customer service    Jack in the Box thats where am going! <EOR>
