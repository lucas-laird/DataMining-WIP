I've visiting particular Lone Star quite often always enjoyed food service  Also whenever crowded that   The food great Lone Star very consistent its quality  order steaks medium rare they're always cooked exact same standard   For appetizers Lone Star skins amazing  Crispy soft starchy potato cheese just perfect  Taste Texas sampler pretty big plate Lone Star Skins Buffalo Chicken Tenders Onion Rings   The Texas Rose huge onion  cut deep fried rose  very heavy while might look good sheer size greasiness only viable parties 6+ people   Their salads nothing extraordinary but ranch dressing perfect tangy creamy wish could buy grocery store!   steaks themselves quite tasty very juicy  wasn't very impressed Porterhouse big steak but wasn't tasty expected  does fill though can't wrong it   My top 3 choices are San Antonio sirloin relatively lean steak  Peppercorn Ribeye amazing sauce ribeye itself very tasty  Five Star Filler mignon probably leanest cut very tender juicy   You order 2 side dishes your steak  Most them excellent   With steak always baked sweet potato cinnamon sugar butter divine combination highly recommend fact always steak! Simple MUST IT!   The lettuce wedge nice addition just right amount blue cheese  dressing spice letttuce   Creamed Spinach somewhat bitter when ordered it  I'd prefer creamier    The mashed potatoes lacking taste somehow don't starchy creamy taste  sure bacon cheese huge difference   For dessert big brownie extremely indulgent big size easily feeds 3 people maybe more classic combination hot moist brownie cold ice cream dessert highlight your Lone Star experience   Every time service amazing when Lone Star usually certain server proved most friendly attentive seen valley far  sure if Yelp allows write server's name can't mention he is  Definitely A+ service   Overall traditional steakhouse good quality consistent food great service decent prices  wrong? <EOR> Ick  Lone Star Steakhouse nothing horrible but nothing brag about  Staff kind but really just didn't act together  When walked hostess smiled but instead greeting reached pick phone  food mediocre if that  sorry excuse tenderloins wrapped bacon steak fries plate big black spot   they couldn't just thrown out? I'd location couple years ago remember everything being much better  happened??? <EOR> I love Lonestar  Great salad bread steaks good size pretty tasty   huge selection beer though   alot food pretty good price you'll definately full leave sure why even dessert menu  <EOR> Another FREE Entree E club birthday!!

The Texas Melt  burger completely different experience  burger frozen patty cheese wasn't melted all because grilled onions soggy cold PLUS bun wasn't grilled toasted either   I still gave 4 stars being FREE but its likely place open next year birthday!! <EOR> I restuartant twice both times food service excellent   The wait staff extra friendly could famous Texas hospitality The portions Texas sized  suggest trying instead mashed potato baked potato try Sweet Potato  amazing much healthier white potatoe   but Try place just east Vegas strip    Beats sitting noisey high price strip restuarant having put sloppy drunks cigaret smoke   ENJOY!!! <EOR>
