Thankfully majority party already there  seated upstairs high tables  LOTS LOTS TV'S = PERFECT!! Typical bar type food  Here's ordered BBQ Chicken Wings going buffalo wings but waiter suggested BBQ ones since  they're known for  good but nothing extraordinary  guess he hyped much? Idk  Ended trying friend's buffalo wings later  bad either  guess just whatever you're mood for   Chicken Tenders MISTAKE! You'd think   can't wrong chicken tenders right? Well here  didn't them all  enjoyed celery carrot sticks more  second round food made sure again   Fries Just fries  Nothing special them    Luckily waiter super super cool!

As result also partially because determined use some unusual adjective describe phenomenon just seem some kind odd simpatico sporting bars!  Part definitely when mood just enjoy general emotion noise fast paced atmosphere places   stressful work life places seem help disconnect bit way other places just don't might sound odd but believe actually works for least case visit just starting well needed vacation   Our server great both friendly helpful   He explained all specials going very attentive everything brought quickly despite fact quite busy while there   Definitely good place especially if you're staying New York New York hotel also your own adjective draws kind venue! <EOR> The chili cheese fries over top abusive 4 pretty full them   waiter refilled diet coke good dozen times   bacon cheeseburgers decent but amazing   I'd again  <EOR>
