I made beeline Elixir once saw word Organic its promotional sign parking lot where fresh52 Farmer's Market held  many Organic restaurant cafes Henderson needless say stoked  only recently opened a 'soft' opening don't full menu just yet but already plenty deliciousness enjoy    I started devouring sumptuous vegan chocolate cake since other people already finished red velvet cake boo! while waiting Caesar wrap spinach tortilla  cake wonderfully light fluffy adequately moist still quite hungry when wrap came out  wrap perfect  presentation lovely served little cup cold grapes pickle hot pepper  wrap itself most gorgeous tastiest spinach wraps ever seen whole wheat flecks spinach rather green ones seen elsewhere  Caesar dressing light tasty veggies fresh finely chopped  sandwich normally comes chicken but am vegetarian happy substitute tomatoes    They plan add hot sandwiches menu well breakfast menu yum  Currently variety fresh fruit yogurt boba tea smoothies well salads other sandwiches few other things can't remember  plan return frequently  Great addition neighborhood! <EOR> I very hesitant eat because reviews so so    very pleasantly surprised excellent service quality food   spring rolls hot vegetarian sandwich cole veggie chicken sandwiches all which excellent   My only criticism $2 99 plus $1 refills way expensive small glass regular iced tea    definitely return restaurant but probably skip drink  <EOR> Wow wait almost 20 mins hot sandwich minestrone soup go  If knew would long think would just gone home own lunch   My boyfriend hot beef sandwich  When home not even 5 mins away all soggy falling apart  sauce wasn't even sandwich yet  beef tasty but nothing spectacular  came grapes pickle hot pepper  He sandwich multi grain bread which he fairly disappointed with   I bowl minestrone soup vegetarian   thought minestrone supposed beans? crazy beans but I'd expect see few especially being vegetarian   expect full? soup definitely mediocre  noodles extremely soggy mushy! bowl $4 99 more size cup! wonder small cup is    The prices outrageous  boyfriend's hot sandwich bowl minestrone iced black tea came $19!! Next time driving road Raw Cafe some better tasting fresh food even if raw!  The interior decor looks sort mediterranean restaurant  some cool looking paintings  But tons shelves nothing them  seating ranges tiny tables two couch seating groups  also bar looking area where worker making smoothies drinks   Overall worth wait price  <EOR> Vegan menu ok   Most  entrees use fake deli meats   seitan like chicken ones better   Sandwiches could filled more   1 2 slices deli meat sprinkling daiya cheese really filling     Soups small size SMALL  Possibly 2 oz  $4   No more 4 5 spoonfuls   lower prices bigger containers   Boba teas good other fruit drinks     Desserts definately need improvement   Vegan carrot cake only dessert available months   I hate see place close but if don't start tweaking most likely will   bigger portions cut prices  <EOR> Horrible  seated immediately no menu  sat  waited  sat  waited  sat  waited  looked girl made eye contact  watched other girl 3 smoothies  sat  waited  looked other people looking back knowingly  Eye contact again hostess waitress whatever  nothing  sat  waited  17 minutes later left  never even saw menu  woman passed way food front looked said wish could that! any restaurant could completely ignore customer over 15 minutes beyond absurd  <EOR> Enjoyed healthy delicious lunch very diverse menue   Delightful attention atmosphere   Highly recommend alternative experience   definitely return     <EOR> This place awful!  groupon going expire today decided swing way home pick something lunch   I'd really wanting try because vegan options I checked yelp reviews lesson learned but very short time wanted food go  Having never before needed minute menu  girl behind counter less friendly never stopped actually listen order   literally follow she never really acknowledged said except tell kitchen really busy going take 30 minutes humus plate veggie wrap ordered  Busy?  two tables occupied entire place!? But okay whatever   already starving gone through ridiculous chore placing order     Then when showed groupon she said dine only  best part explanation due extra cost take out packaging   Unless they're wrapping cashmere really don't see 10 cent piece plastic could possibly cost more serving food plate then pay someone wash     So said fine bring plate but just ask box because repair man coming needed home let inside   response? manager right she's pretty strict it   she'd catch doing    Excuse me??  exactly would she it?    I just left never back  plenty other great restaurants fantastic vegan food city   no desire waste time any way contribute existence such insulting rude establishment  <EOR> I would give place 5 stars  food good love smoothie here  great place anyone trying eat healthy  would cpme back again <EOR> Went groupon very excited bc gluten free options  no hostess 2 waitresses just looked us  kept standing two little kids until finally decided seat ourselves  waters never came  Once food came she never came back table  GF vegan desert  apparently accidently ordered outside groupon menu charged it  asked why she didn't mention when ordering she just kinda mumbled   Took forever bill  No said goodbye us  awkward bad bc food ok  <EOR> Very disappointing   Elixir high hopes given menu approach food   We arrived two groups entire restaurant   waitress pleasant enough let know menu limited would expanding   ordered somehow took 35 minutes basically soup salads sandwich   time 10 minutes passed only group restaurant took over 20 minutes them tell ingredients orders   When food came pretty good   Soup bland salad unexceptional but veggie sandwich thai beef wrap both very good   Unfortunately despite incredibly long wait time owner building declined come say anything even more amazingly told waitress best she could take 10% off check   Most insulting waitress said owner said could put feedback comment card!  Wow   only guests new restaurant couldn't come out   Simply amazing   I can't even begin wrap head around kind mentality   She should begging come talk every guest during soft opening whether food took 35 minutes not   Then come introduce herself under circumstances just mindblowing     We back cannot support management such little passion guests  To brand new restaurant opening want come greet <EOR> This place good option vegetarians smoothies good  BEWARE   if allergic coconut coconut milk tell waitress when ordering shake smoothie use both drinks listed menu ingredients! <EOR> So far two poor experiences still yet eat here  first Lisa L when came shortly before closing given nothing but expletives cook then decided lot noise closing kitchen  cashier said sorry least apologetic tone didn't seem know care  Needless say left pretty upset  came again Wednesday 11 45 find place closed  sign says closed Mondays  employees inside ignoring us  only thing think why closed rain but doesn't much sense since every other establishment center open  yet use Groupon which expires next week last few questionable annoying experiences only reason going bother fact Groupon probably won't refund point  <EOR> Ok food ambiance decor draby waitress lacked personality really helpful therefore service ok   experienced better     friends return nor recommend  <EOR> Good food vegetarian eater Organic eater   eaten 6 times  Every time good   High quality casual food good service   when busy   see other commentators complaining speed service   food made per custom order specialized   food came soon enough put fast food   When take kid some competitors complaints   enough offering main stream enough appeal teenager exposed all crap others offer   plan back often  <EOR> Choose your own 5 ingredient juice $6 95 16 oz  delicious  Thai style peanut 'veggie chicken' pizza could've only better if onions cooked some sort asian chile sauce available Siracha?

Everything super fresh  Its awhile since but still think carrot cake day  <EOR> I waited 45 minutes take order   cost $45   service marginal best   drinks good but better places close by   ordered pine nut hummus $6 99 received approximately 2 tablespoons   wanted share wit friend but barely enough each bite   pita came 2 small pieces store bough nothing special   salad wrap bad   carrot cake never made into bag   When called ask cake let them know happy shuffled around talked defensive person general felt situation handled poorly    I want place but poor service marginal food must say never again  <EOR> Came Yelp deal $17 $25 worth  must say am quite impressed food serve here  But every other surrounding aspect cafe needs some sort improvement if more  First off graphical design theme restaurant needs MAJOR change  If didn't read yelp walked store would've thought joint some acupuncture office  Website also needs major reconstruction well    The service wasn't bad but waitress seemed bit awkward  say hinders performance waitress but she use little more personality    The atmosphere also didn't really remind cafe even restaurant  looked more furniture store  dead silent there  No music TV wasn't even on  waitress also seemed fulfilling duties aren't really resembled waitress  She spending way much time cleaning place   I Guacamole burger whole wheat + grass fed beef   juicy cooked point  Could used more guacamole since guacamole burger  But all taste delicious  other hand girlfriend Santa Fe burger whole wheat bread grass fed beef which practically exact same Guacamole burger    no idea why  Nevertheless very tasty  sides blue corn chips  enough fulfill side want but still somewhat good  other hand girlfriend baked fries which additional $1 50  recommend getting baked fries over any other side just because potato type guy but really complements burger well   Later cook came greeted check see liked food  felt very welcomed he definitely wanna come back numerous occasions  real note though restaurant needs major reconstruction other its foods because seem struggling just little  matters bit more difficult competing another restaurant same focus organic foods Green Proteins which quarter mile north Elixir  Nevertheless see coming back  <EOR> I came long time ago when first opened pick menu check place still looks same  cozy empty    I give them 5 stars food 3 stars service   Like most other reviews Elixir say service pretty bad  took sister lunch only two other people eating there  don't see why takes long even smoothies table    However sister LOVED food  sister panini which she thoroughly enjoyed  concurrence fellow yelper could filled more  came really yummy blue tortilla chips mango salsa  Cobb wrap which LOVED  often eat vegetarian turkey  Especially when comes rich avocado fresh veggies veggie bacon creamy blue cheese dressing all wrapped spinach tortilla!  My sister both smoothies don't remember she but something honeydew mint  sweet refreshing  definitely new favorite smoothie    Overall could increase portion sizes just touch need work customer service but sister enjoyed lunch definitely back! <EOR> On way vega wanted some fresh juice healthy food  stopped elixir  clean spacious although decor really very appealing  ordered fresh carrot juice ginger kids smoothie Mac n cheese  far just ok until coconut squash soup came   omg delicious  Nice some fresh foo before heading into Vegas  Also server super cool friendly  <EOR> I met friend Sunday afternoon lunch   atmosphere wonderful    both green drinks portobello salad   couldn't asked more friendly service water lemon clean beautiful restaurant lovely tranquil atmosphere   definitely back   If any criticism all found menu layout confusing   looking vegan options   portobello salad its own page all other porotbello meals   Next time ask server more help menu   definitely reason lower rating  <EOR> Went first time couple weeks ago surprised see big place was   some reason expected open door find small cafe few tables all which going filled people  found exact opposite  place pretty big sadly empty    This place pretty big menu  ended getting asian beef sandwich    forgot called exactly haha  pretty good but small portion price  also ordered fresh juices man good !   The service good first but kind became over bearing  Since friends only ones checking way often  mean appreciate sentiment but there's difference between good customer service being attentive    Would back here? Probably not  don't live near price ambience just weren't good enough capture attention  <EOR> Lemongrass chicken sandwhich amazing wonderful flavored tea  Carrot cake realy yummy too   Wish Vegas would more Vegan Organic cafes this! <EOR> For some reason review moved Yelp Book Club review don't know why   Made Yelp Book Club review nonsensical  posting again   Yelp sometimes such mystery   Came Yelp Book Club   fancy chairs couches even recliner rocks! large comfortable environment   servers nice kept refilling tea without interrupting book club   something going blender behind bar which little annoying but servers drinks   It closes 7pm which little early   But servers let stay little longer along other customers   Nice restrooms back even if single stall   Seems nice place just hang weekends  <EOR> The food Elixir full flavor tastes great! problems takes forever food smoothies  Also asked side mustard fee     for mustard? dollar didn't break bank but paying mustard new experience me  husband aren't vegan vegetarian but trying eat healthier decent start us  If time spare don't care old mismatch couches very small tables stop it    the flavor  worth live nearby  <EOR> I read reviews waiting 20 minutes sandwich but still wanted try place because Boba smoothies  would think smoothie would take 5 10 minutes  waited OVER 30 minutes drink! owner tried justify saying cook boba fresh    I ordered chocolate banana smoothie which chocolate banana strawberry  smoothie really good minus fresh cooked Boba  slurped around them  If you're used Boba traditional Bubble teashop skip theirs   Good product but worth wait  Many options within 1 3 miles  <EOR> We came groupon  smoothies paninis late lunch  lemongrass sesame paninis beef  great!! menu many options prices reasonable  4 stars food drinks 1 star groupon discount  <EOR> Super weird atmosphere  Waiter cook sitting @ couch when walked into empty restaurant  Just hubby baby carseat  He sat @ tiny table 2  Fine but put baby floor  Also fine but whole experience every little detail sticks unfortunately  Ordered New Mom smoothie hub ordered black coffee  He brought coffee water glass mentioned hot touch but didn't offer napkin perhaps togo cup   better yet coffee mug? Oh Well laughed off  He took order's Spicy Chicken Wrap Black Pepper Turkey Burger  He informed barista when she gets back she'll smoothie  tell no prob work restaurant letting all pass  Approx 10 mins later cute hippie chick comes immediately smoothie which DELICIOUS! Food came shortly after   that excellent  Small portions but very tasty  Downside?? No napkins forks etc  finger food but would've used napkin  THEN while watching waiter barista frolick behind counter unprofessional but amused roach crawled table  done then  interrupt frolicking check f@*% out  <EOR> Very good food unusual set slow service but definitely return more! If your looking something unique interesting definitely try place food great <EOR> I'm baffled place still business  first time came groupon entire place empty except friend I  ordered couple things all decent nothing mind blowing when groupon came again reluctant but since friend vegan close lunch spot us  time around however things different  Again place empty  ambiance atmosphere really strange large room old lady furniture couches outdoor patio furniture tables  ordered hummus platter cucumbers soggy watery middle celery old looking well hard ends  hummus wasn't great didn't know flavored I prefer plain old hummus only thing good pita bread  ordered turkey burger expecting ground turkey but came actual piece turkey panini machine dry gross inedible  still some money left groupon since didn't eat burger ordered mango lassi which tasted crap NOTHING mango lassi ice greek yogurt she then informed groupon dine only wouldn't able take smoothie would drink here  kidding me?

All food organic mostly vegetarian! portobello Philly  delicious! Nice atmosphere friendly waitress  also serve breakfast  going back soon vegetarian eggs Benedict fruit filled wheat pancakes! <EOR> My husband check vegetarian options because I'd heard lot them  2 kids place almost empty yet waitress hostess barista barely acknowledged took sweet time seating us  took 15 minutes drinks arrive but minty basil lemonade AMAZING! asked waitress some good vegetarian suggestions but she seemed annoyed asked nor could she suggest anything  found very offsetting frustrating  she took orders took forever probably 30 minutes food come out  family 2 small children long time  Once food came pretty darn good! husband vegetarian Italian sandwich lemon grass wrap veg  chicken  only accompaniment however tiny mean TINY little gherkin pickle pepperoncini  Say what?! Kinda ridiculous  could least give small side fries chips fruit something! Also waitress never came check ask food nada  She certainly wasn't Ms  Personality but maybe because she doing many duties there  hope place doesn't if business because I'd love try various vegetarian options food pretty good but seriously need change some things  I'd suggest staffing more appropriately sure  should minimum waitress separate barista  Also should offer some actual sides accompany wraps sandwiches  But I'd say overall service could most improved upon  <EOR> We groupon deal  First lots things menu  tried order 6 different things total of  hummus ok better home  pita bread delicious! both ordered grass fed beef burger tasted preformed frozen absolutely no flavor  baked fries seasoned nicely pretty tasty though soggy blue corn chips pretty bad  only 2 people place Sunday afternoon service extremely slow very helpful  wouldn't back  <EOR> I stopped over mom she hair done since pretty much starving   early afternoon only 2 other couples service pretty good   ended sitting small table two vs  nice plush couches sofas but maybe next time come back wanna comfy     I'll admit only tried place because Groupon but amount food deal couldn't pass  2 burgers wraps 2 drinks dessert $17     My mom ordered following Lemongrass Burger made grass fed beef Gluten free bread 2 orders chips mango salsa 2 Pomegranate Green Teas Veggie Italian Burger grilled Portobello Mushroom Multi grain bread Black Forest Cake     The burgers delicious yummy juicy   actually quite huge mom hard time finishing burgers blue corn chips n salsa   honestly thought burgers good teas refreshing service excellent  she came around quite often check us     However didn't appreciate fact menus updated changed order few times because menus didn't accurately reflect being served  burgers dessert options well tea selection   didn't feel wrap don't know if updated section not   actually only option dessert wish would've known prior walking black forest cake looked delicious but bit dry opinion had eat later since stuffed      I lucky enough find parking spot when did since plaza shares parking lot other restaurants shops   I place hope return another time since did food atmosphere service  also noticed stage setup may return some live music open mic?    When checked Yelp deal free garlic herb pita any entree but couldn't combine offer Groupon returning sometime take advantage too  <EOR> Wooed there no place took 30 min receive service then over priced food would accept groupon gift where given    buyers beware <EOR> Friendly enough staff sure but burden just want quick juice move on  pressure them order waiting 15 mins realizing started  Also location tough  Parking congested lot once find place little corner  Unfortunately open during Sunday farmers market shopping center which would bring folks in  Aside items very much enjoyed Denise she helped behind bar she made great veg juice ordered liking  When rush appreciate product offering unique big box strip malls elsewhere  worth supporting alone <EOR> First glance place somewhere feel comfortable hangin' out  seating isn't very comfy needs some decor assistance    Despite small hurdle food GREAT!

Kidding! They standard cafe menu soups salads sandwiches including wraps panini    list 6 vegan soups !! including vegan chix noodle minestrone chili lentil butternut squash   However only lentil available   Booooo!  There vegan vegetarian version standard menu almost exactly same  just replace meat and or cheese vegan version they Tofurkey Crown meats looks Daiya cheez    server told all vegan veggie menu vegan or made such    Yay!!!  They also juice bar various teas boba which organic sweet regular boba overheard discussion frozen yogurt   dine takeout   The service pretty quick seated immediately menu then couple minutes later brought little dish dried fruit gnaw while making menu decision   cute idea!  I opted Vegan Cobb Salad $9 99 vegan ranch dressing   admit little underwhelmed although fair came exactly described menu lettuce tomatoes only few croutons bacon bits fake turkey little cheez avocado   could used few more veggies carrots? cucumber?    But hell never real Cobb salad maybe  right money    Regardless good size very tasty  did skimp avocado!  dressing good   only gave little tiny cup but  really all needed     if they'd doled more would just slopped some unnecessary calories   salad also came some very fluffy whole wheat pita delish   just black iced tea drink which fine but nothing special and $2 99?!?    They deal going now half off your drink purchase entree   bit pricey but organic food you're getting really good quality   think place lot potential   I'd give 3 5 might rounding score 4 if next visit and definitely one well  <EOR> I stopped hair done next door   All green juice delicious   some reason really hard fresh raw juices   Thank god found Elixer   variety mixes welcome create your own   prices decent comparatively   Sadly raw juice expensive if own juicer know why!    Looked over menu items didn't seem bad   seem cater variety diets   Gluten Free option too!  place looked almost empty weird layout   Don't think great vibe dine but would sure take out   also back more juice! <EOR> The food very good liked organic but service attitude lacking  very strict stingy can't Groupon  No refills limited etc  wasn't generous fun vibe very tight  Maybe we'll try again sure  <EOR> I really impressed wrap got! hairdresser ordered pick when left her! She did say order ahead cause very slow! When pick actually liked atmosphere decided eat in! wrap best ever had!  Vegan vegetable! Told personal trainer she said never again! couple other posts she said service awful very slow! really hope place reads posts keep business! also surprised no lunch time? PLEASE ELIXIR post all similar should pay attention! Slow bad service? cannot wait back well see! <EOR> I bought groupon elixir back April  usually always yelp before groupon but course time didn't  Lesson learned! When finally did research saw all negative reviews chalked them being newer business figured would wait while them work kinks before giving them shot  Silly thinking business owner might pay attention yelp surely types issues people talking would dealt with    Well fast forward 4 months past Thursday when hubby finally chance give place try  walked little 5pm completely empty restaurant  tried push aside any lingering doubts keep optimistic attitude  sign said please wait seated but lady behind juice bar didn't much glance way acknowledge even walked in  started walking towards table while asking if would ok sit down  think she grunted something but definitely did give clear answer  sat down waited bring over menu say hi smile something!! Nothing  She continued clean whatever she doing behind counter then finally brought over some menus close 5 minutes  Sorry put out!   She took drink orders water lemon sugar cane soda hubby which she said b c Whole Foods it  Um ok  He asked just water lemon too  also ordered Vietnamese spring rolls starter  noticed came choice dipping sauces but she never asked which wanted hurried away before could tell her  She came back 2 waters no lemon  asked some lemon again she came back tiny wedge lemon filthy little bowl pic attached which unfortunately didn't notice until squeezed lemon into water Then realized no place settings therefore no napkins wipe lemon juice covered hands on  attention asked some napkins which she brought over but again putting out   A couple minutes later she came back take dinner order  asked if could chicken sandwich multi grain bun which she replied  comes menu several different bun options listed sure why default bun sandwich  guess if wanted another type bun would it    Another 10 minutes she brought spring rolls sweet chili sauce  Still no silverware guess good finger food  asked if could some peanut sauce instead she informed don't peanut sauce  mentioned noticed menu she said oh yeah manager really bad updating menu Way call your manager! O O  We finally dinners another 20 minutes so  Cobb salad wrap hubby Mediterranean grilled chicken sandwich me  Hubby's came 4 grapes tiny pickle pepperoncini pepper  Mine came some mango salsa no joke I counted 7 blue corn tortilla chips    The food itself pretty good albeit little pricey get  glad groupon! wouldn't mind going back try other things menu but could pay back sit through another dinner awkward uncomfortable slow was    I usually don't discount place service alone always understand people bad days  Yes even waiter waitress!  But when see yelp review yelp review stating pretty much same thing little ticked off  If some business owners took time read through reviews fix problems glaringly staring back them more businesses would succeed! <EOR> Calling all book lovers book clubs Elixir really ideal spot hang your book your book loving friends because something hard come around Vegas couches! seriously think may only other coffee shop Vegas couch Elixir plural    couchES  Big ones  Given comfy seating disappointed find no Wi Fi!
