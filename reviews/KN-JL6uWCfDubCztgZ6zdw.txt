I finally food took bite sorely DISAPPOINTED  Now know thing two catfish having fished them few times cooked myself  Biting into catfish po boy realized fish wasn't COOKED COMPLETELY  Deep fried catfish meant light flaky but bit into chewy rubbery more eating nigiri sushi! TERRIBLE mention FLAVORLESS  order spare intestines pull most uncooked fish sandwich leaving just bread which subpar  fries ordered also UNDERCOOKED crispy! Those aren't fries those soggy potatoes! other friends also undercooked fish soggy fries  Sad say looks deceiving    Not mention place ridiculously overpriced  Spare yourself Lola's instead DELISH po boy  <EOR> I really wanted place  food just average but biggest complaint ordered catfish Po Boy $10 barely any catfish it  didn't even whole filet but just few pieces seemed scraps  $10 sandwich expecting more  Very disappointed  going back <EOR> For being New Orleans restaurant being New Orleans    Red Beans Rice worth all   Unless want pay top dollar rice bowl no meat  Majority bowl content 85% rice    dish should severed   More beans rice some sort meat    The Gumbo chicken home made sausage   chicken good enough it  sausage tasted deer sausage   should pork sausage  But once again more rice e any thing else    gumbo should more soup  Less rice!!!!   On upside Shrimp Po Boy good potato salad good well  would back    shrimp Po Boy potato salad  But  if another New Orleans style restaurant around    They definitely over charging selling    Unless spending top dollar rice  Abita beer ridiculously priced  size Po Boy over priced  If bigger   Then definitely pay price    Not going good lie staff really kind  <EOR> My husband wandered finished teacher workshop LVA nearby  debris poboy husband shrimp poboy  Both delicious onion strings came side  decor super cute music fun  tables beautiful ambient lighting  super clean spotless inside  employees nice apparent all take pride work  would definitely return soon! <EOR> This overpriced ass food ordered Red Beans sausage no damn sausage am truly pissed disappointed!
