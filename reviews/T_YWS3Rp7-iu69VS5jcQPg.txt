Stopped lunch during Sea Salts 'Soft Opening ' Fabulous service food preparation presentation  I opted AYCE option instead A' la' Carte menu  add AYCE Osyters $9 00 but well worth 3 varieties Oysters choose from     today Kumamota Blue Point Purple oysters  The sushi fresh well prepared  chose Las Vegas Lasagna cooked Roll    OMG topped Lobster Crab  Warm but hot eat  Tempra Calamari cooked perfectly  ordered Calamari Tempra Roll   soo good! Service staff efficient friendly  work team help always just Server nearest   Management site very interested  'First Dining' impressions experience   Overall   Sea Salt's first few hours 'Soft Opening' pleasant dining experience   I stopped speak another Diner leaving  She waiting today's opening Sea Salt very pleased experience too! <EOR> What horrible experience! service really really bad  would think just opening would really try hard but pathetic  Serving staff stood around refused waters take drink orders even seem care customers there  When finally did order no suggestions waiter  When food finally did arrive 45 minutes later horrible  Cold  Limp  Tasteless  Don't bother place  If find yourself Henderson elsewhere  <EOR> If all you can eat sushi particular quality looking menu interesting variety other dishes try you'll likely okay slightly expensive but satisfying dining experience here    We stopped Friday evening dinner  weren't busy seated just few minutes  servers friendly good job making sure being taken care of  restaurant interesting cafeteria feel    So everyone should know there's always risk eating raw fish raw oysters  14 all you can eat oysters  Kumamotos Blue Points Purples  mostly tasted good but did some bowel troubles next day  girlfriend however unaffected  sense may quite discerning oysters some other restaurants  likely repeat AYCE oysters  discovered really want oysters more carefully curated me  <EOR> Service Sea Salt sushi oyster par sushi   Daniel hosts extremely exceptional moment sat down very second left  party 5 people sat almost immediately when considering busy soft open but never once did service lack   They constantly checked waters full even came over introduce themselves take orders made feel extremely welcomed   We all ordered all eat option $28 if want additional +$9 oyster option well  Let start saying very picky oysters usually don't order oysters sushi restaurant but sea salt definitely choice fresh selection   The kumamotos my fav sweet overly briny fresh most all!  Their menu plenty delicious appetizers side dishes keep satisfied while sushi way  really liked pepper tuna agedashi tofu one best Vegas super white tuna garlic tuna Cajun albacore    The ponzu sauce pieces whatever delicious Cajun edamame great side well  I'd say probably new favorite ayce spots now  must try   In future plan adding poke bar some dessert cocktails definitely want come back for  looking forward seeing new add ons soon! <EOR> FYI soda all drink  NO oysters soft opening! 90min eat  Our server completely oblivious oysters  Don't expect your food 10min ordering  4 chefs kitchen look clueless variety rolls  Poor sushi rice ratio  Roll pieces enormous  under control otherwise no back   *ask your 20% off during soft opening* The concept great  Can't wait till add AYCE poke later crab lobster!

None whatsoever  just left  won't back  <EOR> Just took 9 year old daughter sushi  Great service  Someone came clear plate take order every 5 minutes   Very friendly  all eat sushi great  baked muscles fantastic  daughter did California roll soy paper no additional charge nice   All all very solid first experience  <EOR> It Okay   Wish more Nigiri serections but interesting No Rice Rolls menu items  Sea Salt Tower reminded Yard House's Spicy Tuna Roll   without wonton chips  husband asked server if fry some did! definitely better chips since missing Crunch factor   They some other buffet items Orange Chicken Yakisoba Chow men noodle sitting side dining room  don't think never eat any those  eat sushi Panda Express  I think wasting dining space food opinion  <EOR> New restaurant need work quirks but pretty good overall  Unique atmosphere but kind bright new style rap music videos playing all large tables  We didn't opt AYCE Oysters $9 more time but 2 came AYCE sushi seemed kind warm but tasted okay  Dispite another review think fish quality very good rolls very creative yummy  <EOR> Food outstanding   Sushi very fresh   Friendly staff   Very trendy place grab bite eat  recommend teriyaki salmon apple special 2    <EOR> I want preface review saying first day opened 6 29 18 during soft opening expected service little slow understood things still need some fine tuning   also since soft opening still waiting liquor license    Very cool interior modern rustic seaboard decor  waiting place open since first saw coming soon banner few months ago since live near excited AYCE sushi place close   The food good quite bit flavor fish fresh  Orders came pretty slow since soft opening expected  place packed! manager mentioned didn't expect many customers  sat sushi bar which where normally sit because much faster cause place your order sushi chefs  ended placing orders through waiter because chefs slammed  need fine tune experience because waiters picking food bar which seemed weird should designated area bar pickups split bar into 3 sections chef taking care each section having 2 3 others doing orders restaurant again soft opening sure worked out     I pretty much only order Nigiri sushi complaint Nigiri MUCH RICE! Understand helps cover some cost but crazy amount rice piece Nigiri fish sliced pretty thin especially salmon which favorite ratio just way off  thicker fish less rice all other AYCE sushi places load much rice   They buffet type bar where grab food last nights selection slim soft opening but great idea  orange chicken chow neon available which told more options future  did add AYCE oysters but future seems good deal  two oysters fresh tasty    Sweet shrimp Uni Nigiri fresh flavorful  couple no rice rolls which limited 1 per person sea salt tower reminiscent Yard House's California roll tower without rice only downfall tower much sauce which sure fine tuned  Rolli Rice bowl menu which haven't seen many places love some rolli rice give shot if you've never it  Shrimp tempura nice crispy better anywhere else it  Garlic tuna Nigiri also tasty just little much garlic sauce   My favorite thing Cajun Albacore Nigiri favorite things order AYCE  Cajun really good but again just slightly much sauce but really really good!!   We definitely going back everything really good just some things need fine tuned which expect happen  manager came talk gave card 50% off apologized long wait times  Probably going give week two them groove  Definitely give place try won't disappointed flavor freshness ingredients  would give 3 5 stars if possible due some kinks but going 4 now may update 5 stars when see operate when they're movin groovin'  <EOR>
