Start finish spilled water all over deceiving coupons place disaster!! <EOR> First all taste food deserves 5 stars! But take 1 star off due slow speed kitchen  best advice Don't come hungry!  When arrived 3 tables occupied Sunday afternoon 1pm bit lighter expected  staff attentive restaurant clean  puzzled traffic   We ordered beef pancake rolls seafood noodle soup duck xiao long bao vegetable dish  feel XLBs lack taste but everything else tasted very good    But man took very very very long time each dish arrive! first dish arrived 25 minutes put order guess what? delivered mistake! someone else's order    we finally understand why don't packed restaurant great tasting food!  Worth try really just don't come hungry! <EOR> Menu Chinese which indicator place delicious af  Stop reading eat! <EOR> Was mood spicy Chicken rice noodle soup   ordered excited place looked authentic let down     The noodles overcooked soaked broth off bowl   no broth just fat limp falling apart rice  noodles   spicy Chicken top decent but enough flavor spice   accompanied piece broccoli piece mushroom soggy mung beans died yesterday   RIP mung beans   picked them put them small bowl covered them paper napkin said few words  <EOR> This Yunnan Cuisine anymore now called Noodle King changed ownership menu different well  GROUPON USER BEWARE! CHARGE 18% TIP IF USING GROUPON which didn't indicated Groupon website !!!!  FOOD GREAT compared w the previous Yunnan Cuisine wouldn't recommend noodle taste very raw hard cooked through   warned! <EOR> Food good    but oh god! 1 server sunday dinner time almost full tables table picture only left big party   And guy think chef just keep walking around even helping server!!!! kids waited almost hour 1 food served table! definitely recommend place people kids already hungry!!!!!!! plus called chef giving away appetizer chinese customers everybody waiting food come serve! Take note guests come behind treated very nicely!!!!!!! BEVERAGE WAIT 15mins EACH FOOD SERVED 40 45MINS!!! BOX CHECK 20MINS!!!!!!!! <EOR> So isn't first time remember being impressed being few years ago  According friends review late 2015  Came again recently family recommendation mother's coworker  thing notice name restaurant serve anymore almost borderline false advertisement   chinese name restaurant also ridiculously similar Joe's Shanghai NYC  same ! !   So back review  Considering location place NW corner Rainbow Sahara facing south adjacent Harley Davidson would expect chinese restaurant at  Upon late arrival getting off work no other customers besides own family restaurant  midst ordering food just sat down  thing called reserve beforehand tea smoked duck  Apparently theres limited quantity per day something nature    Rice served charged per bowl bucket  $1 per bowl $4 $5 options bucket rice  dont know difference between $4 $5 option but gotten $5 option gets 6 bowls rice    So food those actually find name match XD   Tea smoked duck ??? actually pretty good  Very nice tea smokey flavor skin meat  skin pretty crispy  only 1 2 duck all left night but enough or rather more enough 6 people   duck served mini steamed buns eat duck similar peking duck except only skin  flavor pretty decent overall think better items had    Chives pocket ???? pocket style dish housemade dough pocket stuffed chopped chives glass noodles eggs  flavor stuff fairly mild could use some additional flavoring but pretty decent  pocket itself well made good chewiness it  Add little splash vinegar yum yum ! Each order comes 2 pockets cut half 4 pieces    Beef roll ???? Green onion pancake wrapped beef some spears cucumber hoisin sauce  chives pocket green onion pancake also seems housemade outside seems quite good pan fried crisp but entirely  outside flaking off but inside still nice chewy  cucumber adds some freshness heaviness beef hoisin sauce which dish nice appetizer share  Each order cuts 2 rolls cut half 4 pieces  Water Cooked Beef ???? dish seems quite differently made compared other ones other restaurants such Chengdu taste Yunnan Garden etc  spice factor seems quite mild terms flavor numbing factor heat level but beef used very tender soft   actually taken leftovers added more ingredients day spicier XD !   Twice cooked pork ??? Fairly standard thin slices pork cooked large pieces leek onions bell pepper  Nothing special terms preparation flavor  Typical twice cooked pork least remember LOL  ok now uh im sure actually called     LOL   Cold appetizer cold appetizer consisted beef stomach some sort beef slice  think called ???? which made thinly sliced beef beef offal according Wiki   Lol  offal bit soft but overall flavor nice  Its served cold its spicy  nice mild numbing factor    Vegetarian thing     overhearing convo supposed vegetarian duck but more rolled soybean curd light dizzle sesame oil maybe some other flavor  Very simple light  Also served cold   Spicy noodle seafood soup thing    something definitely dont know name of  noodles housemade resembled handmade noodles  Inconsistent thickness  Nice chewy  If recall correctly name something stir frying but some odd reason soup form  didn't question it  soup base mildly spicy red  Various seafood inside mussel half shell imitation crab some other stuff  bad dish share eat alone  probably most spicy item  being said wasn't spicy    Overall place ok  Mildly way compared other similar restaurants  duck probably only thing i'd return if anything  <EOR> Over past year lot resto's popping around Valley promoting traditional taste regional Chinese cuisine  lot restaurants doing authentic dishes Yunnan Sichuan among other local provinces China  place believe doing best version recent trend Vegas place would Yunnan Cuisine   Located slightly divey strip mall west Sahara if walked door would think just another Chinese restaurant doing same fare most people country grown on  But looks deceiving    If you've never traditional Sichuan Yunnan style food before might seem brand new experience  advice? Order everything  No mean stick noodle dishes first disappointed   I decided order some appetizers  First cold pork ear strips  pork ears cut thinly gave great crunch chew dish  lightly coated red pepper flake sauce gave sufficient amount heat without overpowering pork ears  celery crisp fresh complimented pig ears well  spicy chicken cubes ok  Sichuan pickled vegetables which more pickled cabbage  slight tanginess them   Next some entrees  steamed fish green peppers came first  tasted used catfish sort very good  steamed ginger scallion broth topped some crisp green peppers  very addicting dish spoon constantly begging more  lamb pot came next  all star dish  slight sweetness dish combining savory aspects lamb created winning combo  no gaminess lamb whatsoever if would told eating beef   would believed you   Where think Yunnan really excels noodle dishes  even page menu dedicated truly specialize Yunnan rice noodle dishes  tried Spicy Chicken Rice Noodle soup  soon arrived table knew yum yums begin  broth wasn't spicy but provided enough kick looking for  liked fact lingering garlic flavor broth which enjoyed very much  noodles fantastic  Imagine thinner version bun bo hue style noodles rice noodles thin tube shape  second thought eating flour based noodles but indeed made rice  Well balanced all around   Another home run Chongqing Street Noodle Soup  saw pictures soup just try it  broth amazing well  liked balanced Sichuan peppercorns dish much but just enough elevate without numbing mouth completely  noodles chewy well cooked ground pork vegetables rounded all flavors   The service great new team but think find footing very soon  better every time visit  prices fair portions really good well  wouldn't necessarily call place dive but borderline places that  all Sichuan Yunnan places Vegas may favorite  Even though always places beef broccoli crab rangoons glad business' willing step box bring people more traditional foods taste homelands  Yunnan Cuisine 5 stars book can't wait come back! <EOR> Cheap good broth good noddles pancakes  hard find actually Chinese food American Chinese  They're pretty legit still cheap  <EOR> Very nice cuisine! food huge very affordable  signature plates noodle different noodle all other Asian noodles  called Mi Xian Chinese smooth when sip sticky when chew it! ordered beef noodle broth also strong taste beef  little plain add pepper salt ready table  cold plate also tasty me  come back next time  <EOR> Nice something good without venturing into chinatown  Pleasantly surprised portions  braised beef noodles point  handmade noodles delicious  Enough feed two  <EOR> I've twice recently really want place but just hard time finding anything really like  think another Yunnan restaurant left dust  eat eat hoping taste buds would find love but looks taste buds already found love another Yunnan restaurant just can't compare    The lamb hotpot looks great photos but when brought table find sorely disappointing  First smaller thought  When first walked into restaurant lady next booth eating hotpot huge  lamb hotpot lot smaller maybe low lamb today  Second under cooked vegetables enough lamb  don't know possible Yunnan cuisine but lacked flavor besides just being spicy    The noodles decent but nothing amazing  would eat if hungry but don't particularly care it  Chongqing street noodle decent but nothing amazing  also tried two beef noodles previous visit beef hotpot noodle another beef noodle stew  also rather mediocre    Service generally friendly decent  give incentive write them great yelp review meal discount free soda as seen menu   feel somewhat duped when saw higher expectations food  <EOR> I asked braised beef noodle soup  probably ran beef gave stir fry beef instead  also put mushrooms snow peas it? dumped stir fry into broth  wanted all  Could just said ran instead try money off me  also waited 30 minutes food things worse  Never coming back again  also talking Chinese assuming can't understand because don't feel comfortable speaking it  should read all reviews instead just looking rating  feel less alone only disappointed though  <EOR> They changed name yunan cuisine noodle king  mostly Sichuan spicy food  No longer yunan style cuisine  Noodles pretty good  sign mandatory 18% gratuity using Groupon  $1 more noodles when weekend nights holidays  But overall noodles taste fresh if u order mild actually spicy pretty clean  hidden behind buffet place  Inexpensive  <EOR> Small hidden clean nice staff good food  house special noodles very refreshing  <EOR> Above average Chinese food   ordered soup dumplings beef noodle soup   better soup dumplings   noodle soup flavorful full tender braised beef   prices pretty reasonable service very good   would return beef soup  <EOR> They C 3 months again food good Look bussiness ok location Just need cleaning safety first tourist state <EOR> Let's try restaurant yesterday ordered spicy beef dish no taste dish skewer vegetables meat  Also don't any taste  food may more suitable americans  Leave waiter gave $5 cash coupon followed handwritten next time need spending $30 use! can't understand! won't restaurant! <EOR> Noodle up! place very FRESH mean FRESH Noodles!
