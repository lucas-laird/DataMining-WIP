Beef Noodle soup   All worth trying price wise? SUPER cheap   If you're ever budget vegas drive down Spring Mountain Road find yourself China Town pick place any place  But definitely recommend Ay Chung! <EOR> alright place only taiwanese joints vegas  i believe there's other place  i safely say eat more reason any other  being taiwanese need fix every once awhile ya know sayin  however if really terrible think we'd pass no matter what   that said here's think place  the beef noodle soup quite good far concerned  the broth fresh just spicy enuf  yum! however beef bit tough  the noodles very plentiful  the pork noodle soup delish  the pork chops good but better certain days  the popcorn chicken alright crunchy enuf me  the sizzling steak chicken served noodles egg your choice sauce black pepper sweet tomato very tasty well worth whoppin $8 95  but sure ask sauce side cuz otherwise soggy noodles  the ba bao fan i don't know say english pretty good  the rice bamboo something other also very good  i think sauce does us  the rest just vehicle sauce into your mouth  ha! their drinks typically taiwanese much fresh fruit mostly powder flavoring  the boba bit overcooked   as service girls all very sincere friendly  they're very prompt don't attention dining floor much should but place still fairly new surely working some kinks  one thing i'd love suggest them need divide staff bit more evenly  each time there's always 3 girls behind counter making drinks only 1 girl taking orders expediting food delivery  there really only needs drink maker   all all we'll definitely continue eat here  the food satisfying prices decent   so   02   UPDATE eaten million times since posted review seems made comfort food joint choice   always beef soup clear noodles now minced pork rice   both delicious!
