Checked place Saturday night left unimpressed   place pretty empty but still seated very back corner kitchen all customers seated against far wall which felt bit strange    being seated waited 15 minutes waitress come take order   Throughout dinner waitresses all huddled around sushi bar chatting sushi chefs seemed annoyed any time needed check customers   Plus music blasting loud all night could barely conversation   The non sushi menu limited only basic chicken teriyaki etc   Also weren't any combo plates other places offer   ordered couple rolls fine the spicy tuna actually ok but all covered great sauces salty sour   chicken teriyaki came huge plate all breast meat   however chicken very very bland the chicken appeared steamed later topped little sauce pile green onions    Next time we'll stick Love Sushi   better sushi better non sushi better prices   Plus much better service  <EOR> It's while keep giving try but ever since Police tape booth removal gone down hill   Sushi usually good really good side but service hit miss   usually huge miss   really all time could stall around men's toilet?
