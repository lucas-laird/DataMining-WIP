I excited try buffet but alas left much desired   Perhaps because Boston spoiled when comes fresh seafood but found difficult find any appetizing seafood here  I started crab legs which weren't bad but bit stringy  moved onto cajan shrimp calamari   shrimp wasn't edible beyond fishy YUCK! calamari passable  Finally made lobster tails    ummm    lobster countless times wouldn't call lobster tails  greyish tint tasted rubber left very unsettling feeling stomach   Again perhaps spoiled fresh seafood east coast perhaps perturbed paid buffet buffet pass paid additional $15 seafood travesty but back  <EOR> Excellent Seafood  Top notch staff   server Cindy awesome!

Perhaps asking because around 8 45 person front assured continue bring food until 9 30   did continue bring food but less popular dishes just sat sat there   I don't understand why people come here   All eat lobster?  FOUND   think may found but thought crawfish  All eat oysters?  FRESH!  Avoid fresh oyster all costs   say oysters afrodisiac but there's nothing sexy watching someone puke  All eat king crab legs?  FOUND   Seriously where this?  only found snow crab legs   No king crab found  All eat seafood?  Yes but again fresh   found seafood more fresh Bachannal buffet Caesars although variety good here   But why pay more eat such crap food?  If you're strictly quantity you're someone likes puke eating ton food kind understand    Even if didn't sick would suggest coming here   Spend extra Bachannal Caesars much better enough seafood options keep satisfied   If did Buffet Buffets promotion definitely worth extra fee eat here   So became ill someone suggest contact customer service   sent them email telling them food poisoning buffet replied asking call some risk management team open investigation   would preferred if just refunded extra money paid part Buffet Buffets deal   But calling number speaking them mere $10 worth effort   Rio win   Take $10   hope puke crap somehow clog your sewage pipes  <EOR> Gross things ate chewy dried oyster fajita dried tortilla deep fried sesame ball which overcooked dried seeing pattern? crab raw something its claw don't even know    Tasty things ate Mediterranean cured salmon greek salad   OK  but unimpressive things everything else  <EOR> It's worth $43 bucks  If affiliated any sort event hosted sure grab some coupons  only thing liked oysters  Other could eat Carnival World Buffet half price still your crab craving fix  <EOR> People told did  discount if you're Vegas resident which big bonus   There much food choose all 3 loved it   Overall really happy expierence but since Rio little bit way strip don't know if we'll way back  <EOR> Seafood lovers spot you! offer pretty much all kinds seafood taste fresh delicious!

Cooked Mini Lobster Tails chilled cooked  Snow Crab Legs chilled Alaskan King Crab legs Crawfish cocktail shrimp just name few amazing seafood selections have  $45 per person   but thought pretty worth it  waitress top refilling drinks clearing plates baskets shells    The dessert selection amazing too    chocolate cups creme strawberries creme bruelee variety cakes pies cookies gelato  stuffed couldn't move! surely best buffet tried Vegas    I read some reviews seafood wasn't fresh guess admit chilled crab legs somewhat frozen   other then thought other seafood pretty good especially mini lobster tails  so meaty tender!  Overall if seafood guess only seafood buffet try! <EOR> Warning warning food pig human  worse part give only bowl puke instead three  <EOR> I've coming Village Seafood Buffet many years  debating whether trip Rio try seafood restaurant own hotel  craving seafood if drift   Well decision clear little attitude hotel restaurant headed over Rio absolutely made great decision  Yes buffet little less terms certain things compared previous years especially lobster oh long days mounds slip lobster tails     But all all   seafood everywhere great food little land kind foods prime rib  More enough then some fill mostly shellfish nice leisurely environment   The other thing stood compared previous years maybe Caesars Entertainment theme incredibly customer centric friendly service  cashier folks behind buffet also server  past years generally server would alright but other folks acted if did want there  felt welcome guest appreciated which made dining experience all better   Thank Village Buffet your wonderful people  <EOR> Don't it!

Yay   heart Village Seafood Buffet  <EOR> It's years since last dined here   selection food quality great back then even more now   girlfriend town short time made point dine here   4pm line started but wasn't long expected   host waitress friendly accomodating   variety seafood selection shrimp tempura crab quiche oysters fresh tasty   if  enough definitely need room desert   die for    literally melt your mouth    felt desert heaven   presentation well freshness won vote   I'm seafood lover point hit buffet whenever town  <EOR> This far worst experience ever  seafood lovers come place  price outrageous honest cost  told charged $15 extra per person but when came cashier wanted charge $20 per person  lobster frozen atrocious smell similar rotting fish  oysters clean filled ice  However positive note server friendly helpful  seafood lovers visiting Las Vegas area please fall into trap  robbed hungry overall unsatisfied food  <EOR> Ok place deserves some stars just because lobster ALL TIME  don't really crab legs every Las Vegas buffet don't wrong crab good but years years eating those every Vegas trip crave lobster     It's interesting lobsters small always thought illegal fish them young because want them chance reproduce first  flavor texture them know fresh lobsters but way cooked could've better    just adding bit more salt would difference    Some people lack common decency world line maybe 15 20 people waiting lobster guy 2 plates filling high up  Luckily still plenty pan tells small were  literally size large shrimp posted picture    As other food bad but think majority people come buffet lobster many other dishes popular gets dried heat lamps    Price rather expensive $45  don't come if lobster fan  am back just that  most likely eating myself since everyone know those better places  come mainly tiny lobsters  <EOR> I RIO Village Seafood Buffet weekday dinner $44 99 and if sign gambler's tracking card $1 off    It's grand buffet lots options   think non seafood buffet Rio $10 cheaper different location Seafood Buffet   The Seafood okay   Typical snow crab legs fishes shrimp other stuff   Lobster wasn't very good think what's called Mexican Slipper lobster which smaller tasty   I'd preferred also Dungeness Crab favorite those North San Francisco Portland Alaskan King Crab which higher quality Snow Crab which any Asian Buffet become common run mill menu item all buffets general   The prime rib roast beef good but know hit miss depending cut roast if overcooked done medium rare perfection   1st slice rivaled you'd pay $20 30 restaurant very juicy flavorful   2nd slice try later bit tougher drier style tasted different lower quality cut meat 1st   They international cuisine Chinese Asian featuring Roast Duck Mexican Italian American standard fare   ice cream well   robust salad bar nor soup options deserts brag about   It's always balancing act decision making when deciding whether dine buffet VS non buffet standard dining   factor 1 Price 2 Service Convenience 3 Location Convenience 4 Appetite 5 Quality   So roughly $55 tip 'em pay your tax question is   better meal where just order entree elsewhere?   For those can't eat $50+ worth food maybe answer no those eat lot also enjoys tasty diverse flavors so if restaurant ordered prime rib snow crab legs then added appetizer desert drink you'd pay more $50 most places good place   There other buffet options Vegas some cheaper some slightly more expensive 'tho $50 generally higher end all varying quality food diversity selection   generally Wynn's Buffet which same price   Rio's better TI's buffet may other places 'tho   I think okay deal $50 and gamblers flippantly peel $100's betting cards dice slots only lose mere minutes    treat yourself good meal should never cheap eating when you're gambling same more money seemingly recklessly    your priorities  straight eat well n' enjoy! If priced $30 below would right sized perfect opinion however   The Rio's location off strip need take cab drive generally  <EOR> This honestly waste $50  First off price  price quality food should $15 $25 $50   I tomato mozzarella salad couscous salad snow crab legs macaroons   The mozzarella salad bit grainy side tomatoes going bad  dented weird mouth feel them  couscous salad overcooked  overly dressed all vegetables all can  snow crab legs okay  only bad part them kept water bath which caused some legs become awfully soggy  Also cut legs half which really doesn't any sense  If gonna take two legs gonna take two legs four halves  Cutting them half also factor soggy ness allowing water reach more meat  macaroons didn't taste fresh think could all better filling  all very dense greasy buttercream filling which could all replaced jam dulce de leche nut butter   The room felt very dark dingy  very hard see   If going Vegas would recommend going here  plenty more places cheaper higher quality better space  <EOR> Definitely best buffet Las Vegas!! All eat seafood sushi lobster tail crab legs etc!  also great modern music playing which also made place fairly hip     The gripe fact 15% gratuity added parties 10 more   split group into 2    9 7     All food great   never lobster fan but baby lobster tails cooks well rubbery which am used to  <EOR> Stuffed!!!  all good!  crab legs alone worth trip!  Mediterranean food Delish! jambalaya outstanding!  oysters pretty damn good too!  wouldn't bring kids price but good treat grown ups! <EOR> This favorite buffet   so far  Boyfriend stuck off strip buffets since they're much cheaper alternative  wouldn't come if weren't locals discount 2 1! best come close opening line gets very long  generally moves quickly though    As food must remember buffet  food made giant batches left under sneeze guard until runs out  shouldn't expecting gourmet extravaganza  mind food tasty! learned halfway through first visit crab legs waste time  sushi actually decent although very basic  Every time gone fish fresh  generally hit sushi hard interspersing million other small things offer  favorite meals ones made appetizers love pick little bite size things  simply don't want waste tummy room big portions meat potatoes when sample small bits ton different things    Also adore desserts particular lemon raspberry tarte   so good  trying months find recipe approximates them home! <EOR> This reason even bother stepping into Rio begin with  Really  But whole trip such magnificent blur could eating garbage all know thinking great  those enormous margaritas sip while suck down scallops muscles oysters Cajun fried shrimp sashimi whatever frozen re prepared sea food could possibly want  course frozen we're desert Santorum's sake! any case enjoyed lady bringing drinks very kind  <EOR> Shucked scallops?!  good!!!!

No glance quick look but complete stare  struggled tad but giving orders because hard look see eyes fixated elsewhere! total shock just let tried cover more  he very scatter brained  He rarely came check if drinks needed refills grab attention another server couple times  believe truly just bad server because noticed another server serving another table quite pleasant    Now moving food!   If anything am! am absolute seafood lover! buffet specifically catering good variety seafood just heaven   If memory serves right buffet split into 5 different sections      far left right dessert which included 12 different gelato flavors pies creme brle cakes ect then fruits melons pineapple grapes  Then section which serves lobster tails famously advertised  lobster tails cooked colossal shrimps highly sought thing buffet  Because many people expecting full sized lobster tails many frequently asked where were  2 types lobster  Squat lobster which quite small didn't quite strike ohh factor but also good I'd say midsize red tail lobster phenomenal  Perfectly cooked  colossal shrimps cooked perfectly well!   Moving onto next section sushi sashimi available  epic sushi lover but admit more sashimi lover! rolls available decent  sashimi available ahi tuna salmon  salmon really good    Now next section where spent good amount time in  crustacean section  chilled crab legs oysters scallops! definitely enjoyed much tasted fresh  section probably second most busiest area  frequently refilled more each  lost words because think could say much enjoyed it    As continue though buffet some other dishes available saut scallops prime rib mussels jambalaya boiling crab shrimp stuffed crab stuffed potatoes  other dishes found really good!   I plans returning vegas before end year bet coming back here! <EOR> Where did rumor Rio best buffet from? don't know but does not    I wasn't very lucky last time there  wait line 40 minutes time could actually touch food appetite gone  able eat anyways but most food salty flavor less  impressed all    However agree variety huge should walk around whole chain first before start getting food  boyfriend trying little bit everything but failed because focusing first half much  boyfriend didn't experience bad did but both agreed worth it <EOR> If love seafood buffet  seafood but don't LOVE okay buffet   some folks all piling high crab legs but think crab much work  want able shovel food quickly efficiently struggle harvesting laboring just slows down man!  really nice sushi sashimi also all kinds dim sum shumai shrimp dumplings   highlight wheel gelato famous Elvis gelato  <EOR> I'm sad say this    great memories over years  However just don't know if going back    The quality gone down quite bit  great elements buffet just anymore  glorified hometown buffet now  <EOR> Lots stuff copious consumption folks devour almost $50 00s worth chow  2 years ago gone down hill popularity increased  say loved creme brulee though   Rich man's over priced Golden Corral  can't recommend better cheaper Buffets all around area   Sorry Rio  Well now 2 hours later all three steady customers toilet trots  Smells crabby patties ala Sponge Bob Square Pants employer's  <EOR> horrible sushi fresh all other reviews said   Lobster tail horrible too   did taste lobster more giant schrimp crab legs whatever dessert horrible   HERE    spent 41 bucks mad! <EOR> I first week July 2014  OMG disappointment  people work great!

Yes just said that    Don't wrong Wynn Bellagio buffet top notch well  much nicer luxrious atmosphere compared Village Seafood buffet    But came food  Perhaps because prior eating Wynn Bellagio LOT hype behind them  expectations super high all reviews experience yea good but it?   supposedly best buffets into Village Seafood expecting much all just heard good well but no hype high expections   The decor atmosphere well below Wynn Bellagio  buffet sections spread aforementioned places did look more dense amount choices  depends perceive it   They don't call Seafood buffet no reason  definitely more choices seafood compared others  course its trade off wit other items  But much pig argue missing other items because made more seafood   All food tasted great straight lobster crab course  sushi bad but good but no buffet even wynn bellagio produce good sushi    What really shines desserts  gelato wheel awesome! flavors all taste great refreshing  other dessert items absolutely superb well   The staff cleans your plates attentive no problems   A line does form well but much long more popular Wynn Bellagio    I would definitely experience hype Wynn Bellagio buffets give shot  <EOR> I must say place must seafood lovers want variety  wife coming years love each time  crab legs hot cold mini losbter tails  all crowded but people RIO keep food flowing nicely  <EOR> It's buffet can't expect much quality food but $50 per person yeah might well worth if come here  think overprice commission yeah seafood expensive but better fresher seafood elsewhere  worth price  Overall wouldn't say bad ether liked but think only time I'd ever come back if discount coupons something  good variety food try  bad  mainly came oysters crab legs not   some tasted good others tasted bit fishy just satisfying crab legs quite dried    Other I'd give second chance just when pay $100 two when food doesn't taste $100 worth  <EOR> Ok Now officially new favorite buffet Vegas  I am seafood lover though    definitely biased      I think ate pound salmon sashimi     hubby ate fill crawfish oysters   Also clam chowder delicious! <EOR> I've twice   Both times pretty good   tasty crab legs lamb good variety everything else   Desserts great   price I think around $30 pretty good value Strip   good value Mandalay Bay's buffet but bad     For quality still gotta shell Wynn Bellagio though   They're worth it  <EOR> Seafood   Buffet? more needs said  Seems brilliant idea  However horribly executed here   Behind faade great value world's best selection below average quality seafood  Basically everything looked great but tasted best average worst funky   Their best items cooked ones  Don't enticing raw oysters  Just don't  Stuffed crab shells yes  Oh crab legs  guess can't mess steaming some crab legs   They whole range other foods grouped ethnicity  check them but all seem kind same few rounds  All just bland below average foods some random seafood thrown them   The only thing place going desserts  rotating gelato bar? Uhm five please?  Before fall into trap recommend spending half your Benjamin another buffet only quantity but also quality  <EOR> Caesars Entertainment took five star seafood buffet merged two star buffet  Gone many seafood non seafood entrees made best Las Vegas  <EOR> The boyfriend big seafood lovers  We'd heard some pretty good things place friends family decided try first meal Vegas  $50 person expected better  Maybe disappointed because hopes because weekday? But then again New Years food should've best    They lot selections which included things king crab oysters lobster  bad quality food wasn't good  oysters weren't all fresh king crab just any other king crab any other buffet  lobster small tails mixed some shrimp very bland overcooked  Actually most food overcooked   Our first buffet Vegas disappointed  All all ok great  Definitely worth $50  quality food night probably worth around $30 person  If cheaper then it'd worth probably warrant another star  But suggestion pay less Buffet Bellagio better food  all seafood but decent amount good quality seafood fresh tuna Chilean sea bass king crab etc  don't know others but quality quantity  But if you're quantity over quality person then guess won't problem Village Buffet  <EOR> About month ago started craving Las Vegas's Rio's Seafood Buffet blue  Good thing slated run Vegas marathon few weeks later    As race day neared thought more more obscene quantity seafood would consume once finished marathon  all perks running 26 2 miles eat whatever want before race without feeling ounce guilt at least theory    Thus mild disappointment seafood buffet never really lived expected be  Surprising because before  Oh before      I'd say 6th visit seafood buffet all honesty don't know why keep coming back  $39 99 + tax tip hardly bargain  mean if seafood best ever might mind but good best   not even great    Yes baby lobster tails hot cold crab legs deep fried scallops clams shrimp well assortment sushi but end day all seafood could live without especially price  <EOR> Wowsers!  best seafood buffet ever!  literally mountain raw oysters usually eat 7 them   things oyster don't look all great because really pile them bunch seem refine when them restaurants but oysters all taste really good husband never stomach issues seafood buffet versus Todai I really Todai still    TMI?  But enough oysters   All other food sections great too   personally enjoy dim sum section but mom would mad if she saw eat anything other seafood because waste stomach space  The only down side buffet price  <EOR> Beware buffet  food poisoning food good  Overcooked dried up  <EOR> This best buffet Las Vegas all casino Hotel buffets  graduation vacation some friends stayed Rio wrist band deal where could eat any hotel casino buffet strip  hopped around all them pretty much but all liked Rio best ! Lots good variety Rio buffet great desert bar ! put just everything could two plates sample everything  impressed more half it  All buffets however did few items high school cafeteria status lol but still found Rio least flawed when came flavor variety quality ! <EOR> It's hard rate buffet 5 star since well don't think any buffet any 5 star food but give high which would 4 5  For around same price all other higher class buffets Vegas aimed giving everyone best seafood delivers!  Crawfish Lobster Oysters King Crab legs Snow Crab claws shrimp sushi and sashimi all available   There's also necessary prime rib chicken other ethnic foods but eats those!  All things eaten quickly freshly restocked continuously servers bring buckets shells crackers crab!  The desserts also amazing   Specialty cupcakes freshly baked donuts awesome gelato   only thing missing fruit uh yeah don't know why missed one   Overall favorite buffets gladly revisit anytime  <EOR> Back when $10 same quality food worth it   But prices I'd rather nice steakhouse order lobster side king crab   would cheaper     Don't wrong food decent but hardly value  <EOR> I'm big fan buffets but actually OK   If sea food died mediocre seafood heaven   mean 4 star quality food but good is   All eat seafood     The best part when alot people huge line    then when even bigger line lobster crab   doesn't effect rating because buffet Las Vegas   just feel dweeb standing when people bum rush lobster station when see new delivery come in     All remember friend pissed cause made he didn't want pay   He proceeded moneys worth shelling lobster shrimp crab piling into huge bowl drizzling butter eating cereal   It most disgusting awesome thing ever seen   4 stars buffet wise   the only buffet Vegas better Wynn <EOR> Way expensive offer  $45 per person   Buffet includes skinny dry crab legs chewy sashimi not fresh all steamed longostino lobsters shunken oysters egg rolls  Prime rib steak just so so well  probably better off made order restaurants  Needs lot improvements lower price  would expect something much higher quality price especially if California buffet really disappoint you  Service also needs improvement takes forever refill  many tables per server  <EOR> If see signs eat food while self serving everywhere buffet think place?  This place most expensive buffet Vegas $44 99 when Sat night  Rio's website promoting all seafood buffet  would think price big lobster tails fresh oysters abalone salad big crab legs 4 5 kind fishes etc  Am expecting much?  Guess what? only all seafood buffet worst if worst buffter Vegas!  First all only less half dishes contain seafood  seafood serve ordinary cheap stuff medium size shrimp shells medium size crab legs small clams mussels  Oysters? dry ugly  would eat them raw   Thinking lobster tail? none  extra small crawfish small your thumb medium size crawfish tails cooked Chinese style chopped half vertically   am very sure called lobster tails crawfish illegal catch lobster such small size   Interestingly no tag any dish indicating is  Does indicate something?  About 1 6 counter space Mexican food actually looked OK except nobody there  Another 1 6 dedicated Italian only shrimp seafood  Italian station looks bad no hardly there   The Chinese station? Oh man food looks night before no seafood either  Some roast duck chicken some pork buns  Looks very dry due aging    Besids cold seafood clams mussel oyster most cooked seafood havey breaded shrimp  mussel  Nowhere near quality Bellagio's buffet   The prim rib? Looks extremely low quality funny looking color  No taking Saturday night  hoping enough people would take prim rib see next piece would look like  No luck hour   They did even whole chicken turkey carve station  Only fat chicken wings!  The only bright spot grilled octopus  big good  source also pretty tasty   The salad station extremely small next fruit station  desert station OK home made ice cream   In summary buffet which should priced no more $20  child pricing only 8 yrs old $25 which strange also   My guess marketing trick lure just once  first last time am Rio   There really only 3 buffet worthy try Vegas strip 1 Bellagio's cheaper $36 99 Sat extremely high quality food also very very good coffee 2 Mandalay Bay's $30 quality consistent main stream stuff 3 Wynn's usually long lines expensive but food high quality  <EOR> I really looking forward buffet reading reviews Yelp looking all amazing pictures! sum experience   I wasn't disappointed nor impressed  biggest complaint buffet super redundant  mean that? Along buffet line and long cold shrimp four places whole cooked shrimp three places each dish varying slightly seasoning etc  claiming best Seafood Buffet Las Vegas lacking creativity imagination me  feel same seafood options regular buffet took much smaller chunk outta pocket book if know mean  layout buffet line slightly awkward cramped which evident if you've many large buffets your life  favorite part probably Gelato Wheel   the coconut point  But again being #1 Seafood Buffet Vegas favorite food item definitely should seafood  <EOR> It buffet course notch below normal restaurant   food good but nothing fantastic   If mood seafood buffet would recommend it   Next time Vegas most likely again  <EOR> I could sworn location buffet where World Buffet once was  guess changed  course excited first time EVER trying Seafood Buffet thanks D Block aka David B  Sin City chance try out   First foremost wait LONG  prepared unless come soon opens believe line good hour BEFORE really busy dinner rush   Overall nothing stood completely which enjoyed most but know nothing gross didn't taste right  really decent but didn't wow much thought would  seafood plentiful batches never ran out tasted decently fresh but straight ocean fresh   Maybe next trip think giving them another shot but if lines horrendous again just Hikari all you can eat seafood fix form all you can eat sushi sashimi  <EOR> It's very good buffet though pricey   much better Rio's World's buffet   Yes all sorts dead sea creatures served your gastronomic pleasure  <EOR> I would come Rio regular $25 price  use local student id discount  much sushi available desserts very appealing either  only good thing enjoy eating crab legs ice cream  Oh yeh also vietnamese Pho which okay  usually just take beef balls  <EOR> Its okay  bought buffet buffets stops  food very fresh selective  around lunch crowd otherwise wait horrendous semi ok mediocre selection       <EOR> I took hubby because he loves seafood!  price $40 per person but worth us   We ate little bit everything lobster crab legs clams mussels oysters etc   name tried it     This only  meal day because knew going eat dinner   Vegas didn't sleep until around 5 6 am slept until 4pm next day just time seafood buffet!

YUM! around $38 dollar per person buffet easily rivals Wynn Buffet most expensive buffet Vegas  checking hotel received coupon book $10 bucks off  could say no?   When first enter buffet looks sorta Todai YUCK don't ever there!! but lot better  highly recommend going Oysters King crab first  Also another great strategy would eat raw foods first cooked seafood later  would recommend using same fork raw cooked food maybe wipe off napkin  Keep stomach happy true AYCE specialist    Oysters awesome! No fishy taste smell means fresh! King crab legs claws butter heaven  cocktail shrimp pretty normal  hoping would jumbo shrimp Wynn pre peeled  lobster tail did blow away  expected something Boston lobster least lobster tail butter but instead received chopped lobster tail pieces shrimp  If weren't shells most people would able tell difference between mini lobster tails shrimp  did look images TV outside buffet  Keep simple don't fry lobster! method dries lobster point might well just cock shrimp its cheaper  Just broil give some lemons butter    There other items steak some Asian cuisine but recommend skipping those items completely focus task hand which concur seafood! other items delicious but save another day another buffet  Man vs  SEAFOOD Only please! your 40 dollars worth  Stock all days wanted seafood couldn't it  Another side note    desserts very disappointing  think more options dessert frozen section grocery store  No pies cakes just mini tart things mini mean MINI  gelato ice cream ever is  Didn't taste gelato ice cream frozen yogurt sure exactly  coffee gelato did taste coffee  taste more sbucks frappuccino ice melts its just cream ice water  Next time skip dessert just eat seafood  *Small disappointment   where Cajun creole food?? want some gumbo jambalaya least some Lobster bisque  service great!

Hilarity ensues  <EOR> I ate Village Seafood Buffet Nov  2012   craved idea eating unlimited lobster   read reviews both declaring good worth price  early head line quickly formed   cashier took several minutes processing through simple take money receipt? made Bee Line Lobster   off side readily visible ask food prep persons where were   knew going small but no said going chewy   lobsters easy peel shell disappointed lobster wasn't tasty lobster used but ate fill then concentrated tasting variety other dishes desert   Several people asked where found butter where certain foods commented everything laid benefit being easily found  Why butter lobster etc  ? left full but disappointed buffet overpriced food poorly presented food could cooked properly some overcooked cold hard locate   think everyone should experience all eat seafood buffet but also think could much better buffet if management listened customers   Also waitress did good job keeping drink full dirty dishes removed   No matter much eat buffet think customers same reaction    this buffet could much better pay   But eat if just once your life   Tip accordingly  <EOR> I haven't since remodeled place but remember loading plate raw oysters lobster tails   If you're big seafood fan   buffet must visit!  Sure expensive but consider seafood isn't cheap amount seafood serving equal more double initially paid for  <EOR> 4 adults 1 child 2 babies     $180   really sure fairs since only buffet able time around but amount available seafood guess wasn't bad   And say seafood because good was     let's face it  desert seafood wasn't fresh   crab claws bit frozen eventually fingers numb started hurt ya say though I'd rather experience numb fingers food sickness right?  I did enjoy asian inspired dishes or Chinese food if thought dessert area pretty nifty your choice gelatos   ladies serving particularly accomodating since 2 babies which also meant 2 strollers   give them props that   Would return?  Maybe   I'd probably hit 2 other buffets first though before coming back here   If when come back let crab claws sit little case need thaw few extra minutes   I tell ya thing something  being advertised Only Seafood Buffet Las Vegas could used more seafood buffet  <EOR> I actually haven't years but remember well   think if love seafood place totally worth it   much seafood didn't know eat   think everyone generally crab most friends did   Since never big Alaskan crab fan ended mostly seafood noodles   Pretty good seafood noodles but really just noodles seafood   worth because but definitely recommend those seafood lovers  <EOR> me walking fast can  he told we'd doing lot walking   dunno why wore those shoes  me Hmmmppfff     After all blood guts UFC fight famished   rushed crowd   Oh poor feet  next destination Rio Seafood Buffet   almost 10 00 pm Vegas resident cousin informed buffet closed 11   walked fast could   well tried anyway     After couple miles some blisters quick hop freeway finally arrived   10 10 pm   staff corrected information saying buffet would close 10 30   meant would stop serving new food 10 30   Hmmm   we 20 minutes AYCE $41 per person   was worth it???

Unlikely  <EOR> When comes seafood buffet Las Vegas Village Seafood Buffet Rio always wins top spot    Price per person $38 95  actually bad place offers sashimi easy peel shrimps hot cold snow crab fresh oysters butter garlic clams steamed mussels scallops start  Great selections hot plates such lobster tails shrimps dungeon crabs stir fried crab legs Asian Mediterranean style  mention prime rib toasted BBQ chicken charbroiled Ma hi Ma hi stuffed crab shells    If anyone going crave Village Seafood please plan ahead slow down  Try only half full before done entree  really need save some space deserts  miss berries fruit tarts other cakes made dark chocolate cheesecakes cream puffs low fat frozen desert many flavors    Besides good food excellence deserts great customer service also plus  Very attentive server  Well deserve $5 00 tip  <EOR> Awesome place eat buffet  favorites! Great selection seafood cold hot! All lobster tails eat! Deserts really good  also don't feel rushed eat leave  Reasonably priced seafood buffet! <EOR> I don't want give any stars trick! lobster isn't lobster mushy gross   wasn't worth price all   really wish hadn't insisted coming paying more less  crab legs only thing good but can't really mess up  Next time town pass buffet scene  <EOR> OK buffet pricey   Something neighborhood $48 think but if Tix4Tonight similar vendors buy voucher $2 gets into buffet $33 change total $35    $10 savings  bottle OK wine 12 bucks becomes really fun evening  Some complain food isn't prepared some 5 star restaurant but guess what    isn't 5 star restaurant    decent buffet where try little lot everything  just fun lot cheaper those fancy chef name places hotels  Oysters crab all kinds fish shellfish lobsters  all lots veges other dishes  really dessert selection but admittedly when am full wine crab scallops oysters deserts start looking less attractive  Food critics say like    restaurant fills nightly years years doing something real people like! Don't forget hit half price ticket place your discount vouchers before go! <EOR> Food sucked! Service sucked!  worth $90 paid 2 people!    When called server refill she gave look if bothering her   Never again shall return place!! <EOR> This second choice buffet Vegas next Bacchanal  Good seafood prime rib  kids enjoy desserts  Only negative off strip take taxi  <EOR> I few times before would give them 5 stars recommended  people come   came back again today  line short which hint   simply serve any lobsters any more  some tasteless lobster meat but before   come lobsters because none  <EOR> Right Buffet Wynn being favorite Vegas buffet! Awesome seafood selection! oysters don't quite stone crab claws bland but king crab legs shrimp crawfish always piled high plate!  The best part dessert selection! LOVE gelato station creme brulee must well  Really fun place group down messy = Everyone felt $42 worth! Don't forget free shuttles Paris Hilton  <EOR> 3 5 stars  We planned eat 40 minutes leave flight   ended staying hour wanted more because felt bad didn't finish all food  waster even buffet!   They only open dinners $40 per person  excited see raw oysters but shucked thrown together platter bits pieces shells pile didn't look appetizing  still plated few looked nice okay  really liked separated cocktail sauce horseradish since love zing bf doesn't but case he liked sauce better  hot don't you? Muhaha    My boyfriend tons king crab legs those both favorites  Very easy break apart since crack beforehand  few stone crab legs more difficult meat since shell name implies stone! Even though shells little cracked still took some elbow grease meat out  Then remove cartilage before consuming overcooked sadly bland stone crabs   I really liked white pasta shell dish made  covered baked cheese little tuna peas inside  Really lovely  back another helping enjoyed much  Near pasta green bean squash broccoli dish delicious because mixed butter  Way healthy right? Eat greens drowned butter  Oh yeah!  DO raw clams  don't think people usually them sat ice long time   smelled little rancid dirty butt which never good sign   Got slice prime rib asked medium rare  usually rare but time looked raw me   seriously raw red! medium rare surprisingly tender juicy  quite enjoyed myself eating it!   The desserts really good  strawberry shortcake love love loved great helping fresh fruit  eclair little egg ie custard little firm liking   actually noticed other Rio Buffet same problem eclairs too  probably desserts location send other buffet save time  Way efficient!  Overall enjoyed ourselves but price little steep  If weren't pressed time would enjoyed myself much more eaten pig while checking clock  Sorry people saw eating! <EOR> I think tell locals versus tourists tourists everything see locals just huge plate crab legs   Take hint them crab legs awesome thing  gives place 4 stars because man expensive  Still probably best buffets Las Vegas just ready long line if you're lunch dinner    Try desserts specifically little cakes much better version sorbet although having  server made pleasant experience  <EOR> KUDOS FRESH SASHIMI! think two plateful those babies because good!  The rest buffet items great  felt bad loading little samples every station buffet taking only bite leaving all dust  Sorry being food waster!  The snow crab legs clams mussels oysters many other sea creatures prepared various ways simply raw stir fried deep fried  Each station theme representing different cuisines all over world  Stay away sushi rolls! rice dry tasted day old  if you're fan seafood plenty other land animals feast beef ribs sausages prime rib   And can't leave table without having some dessert! FREAKIN' LOVE GELATO CAROUSEL!! Very whimsical felt being kid again screaming excitement ice cream parlor  Again loaded some dessert goodies only sampled bite eclair tiramisu roll but polished two mini cups gelato pistachio cookies cream   love gelato! server also gave cup coffee desserts which made dessert round 1000x better  coffee strong very smooth  Bellissimo!  To recap 5 stars sashimi gelato coffee! 2 stars rest buffet items   Averaged 3 5 but round good service  <EOR> The downside plates smaller other buffets  family seated table far food annoying having walk back forth because food didn't fit plate  Hahaha  But food mediocre  Wasnt worth money next time  thought would wider selection sushi price well  But service really great! lady served table kept cups full emptied trash basket frequently <EOR> This place always worth price    love dessert area  haha bf spend hours here    ok maybe hours but just really once left phone no stole it! even called Dad since he last number dialed pick up! <EOR> Over years before became member yelp dined buffet   used fabulous  but now    'not   tickets Penn Teller show thought would nice eat Rio before show   Back day lobsters but now lobster tails   lobsters   think serving langostino brought couple them table could eat them   mushy tasteless   believe hype serve lobster because not   did offer very large crawfish which would terrific Louisiana native however someone please! needs teach chef cook them   no seasoning bland again nearly tasteless   crab legs skinny sticks NO oysters   All all food EVEN mediocre service awful   originally added 20% tip when paid buffet but cancelled tip left few dollars   Casinos raking lot money   could least offer decent buffets   Making trip Rio Strip little journey but now no reason again  <EOR> I would never imagine paying much buffet  Remember seafood!  But BF come mainly seafood! other food Mexican Chinese pasta salad  But man oh man lobster tails steer wrong! thee best had!  much want!  crab legs shrimp! Where find bottomless seafood where live price? dessert bar good too  Every time visit Vegas take free shuttle Rio! now picks Harrahs every 30min  Come hungry early! <EOR> There no line all Saturday night visited which surprising since taxi driver said mom sister least three times when town  seafood fresh plentiful  favorites mini lobster tails lobster mac cheese ceviche crab legs sashimi  coupon only paid $31 each  Even full price great value because selection quality  also liked dessert station  tiramisu excellent several flavors gelato    I definitely back next time Vegas  <EOR> Sashimi super fresh good!! Line bit long but moved quickly  Great place Seafood  <EOR> Seriously overpriced! love seafood last time ate disappointed! freshness gone  crab legs still frozen heavily salted lobster tails gross smelled old  used best seafood buffet but no longer! sushi okay shrimp dishes okay but worth price! best deal lobster but sadly won't back! <EOR> Overpriced  Wish regular buffet instead  wonderful  seafood simply expensive   DON'T seafood buffet  REGULAR one  <EOR> Food really good   Clam chowder bomb   Also good cold shellfish except oysters  kind weak   Lobster bland  also no fried lobster when 5 years ago  boo   I'd eat again  <EOR> Unless if fancy fried seafood fish popcorn shrimp calamari Save your $40 invest smaller amount $30 towards weekdays buffet bellagio instead  <EOR> Easily best and perhaps only? seafood buffet Vegas    Mounds king crab legs slipper lobster cold fried shrimp cold steamed clams raw oysters half green black mussels sushi bar fresh sashimi loads desserts although no frozen yogurt machine reviewer pointed homemade ice cream bar  also selection hot favorites including prime rib chinese food dishes stew jambalaya gumbo dishes    The only downside line both inside out  count waiting least 30 45 minutes then once begin your feasting notice actual buffet lines begin deeper  Sometimes wait food line close 20 minutes    If crowds cleared bit fast then would five star review! <EOR> This place huge overwhelming  could spend hours here   good friends love lol   I don't even eat seafood   any meat matter   am still overwhelmed choices  all kinds pastas stir fry station burrito bar BBQ section huge variety breakfast foods    Nothing outstanding   but there's quite few items pretty good    I'm sure much charge regularly but came 24hr Vegas Buffet Package Deal   don't think would come paying full price    Unlimited mimosas coffee teas soda etc included which pretty awesome because could pretty much drink cost coffee mimosas haha    It's definitely no fancy environment   just gigantic cafeteria mostly filled Asian families filling lobster crab legs haha     They pretty sweet dessert bar which always favorite section! serve decent gelato! <EOR> The only reason giving 4 stars because lobster tails hard find buffet  Here's what's happening Lobster Medley AWARE  mix your expensive rock lobster tails darker red orange your cheaper slipper tail shrimp  All them DRY but still maintained tasty lobster flavor    Desserts Creme Brulee better most buffet's creme brulee    Sashimi tilapia smelled tad fishy tuna EXCELLENT flavor smell appearance a lot fresher tilapia   rolls weren't great    The rest food lobster dry overcooked  Despite major drawback where else unlimited lobster tails $40 bucks? <EOR> Decent but worth price paid  Didnt hate but wouldn't come back  Lobster tails actually langostinos  False advertising real let down but some good points   Pros lobster bisque really good  More cheesy textured sharp flavored most but  it salmon sashimi excellent Mediterranean section seafood bouillabaisse some sort spicy flavorful favorite  don't usually eat pasta but made exception because good big crab legs cut half easy eating  dry they're actually quite flavorful good  cold scallops buttery smooth  Cons expensive you're getting  joined card club saved whopping 2 bucks $100 tab  Woo hoo  most sushi icky salmon good but tempura shrimp rubbery hamachi tough eat came vacuum sealed pouch looked more tilapia tuna all tendons it  Stick salmon California rolls  gelato more shave ice texture favorite most fried things salty rubbery biggest con all false advertising lobster s  langoustines  seeing photos nothing even remotely available when inch half long biggest  kept seeing advertisements saying lobster lobster lobster  Asked staff lobster?

I am huge fan oysters half shell crab legs both chilled steamed crab claws shrimp easy peel delicious! day oysters seemed replaced refilled relatively often good sign  Yum yum yum! keep raw stuff pretty chilled no worries that!   For those non raw fans pretty decent amount food cooked including prime rib tasty! grilled fish among others    GELATO bar pretty decent selection dessert  However when wanted more crembrulee NO MORE!! Very disappointed if you're fan grab your crembrulee earlier evening!   The buffet put back little over $40 including tax dinner but definitely ate money's worth didn't disgusting post buffet feeling  Check place if love seafood! <EOR> This buffet oyster shrimp Alaskan king crab lobster shrimp  dessert area pretty good  husband liked buffet  Sucks cause away strip  Less variety compared other buffets  But Rio does another buffet there  If Buffet Buffet    both just pay extra seafood  <EOR> Only best  Local places back home  saying much  Sorry but if seafood yourself favor spend ten bucks more eat little less significantly better quality food good service same casino! Pigging frozen crab legs isn't always best deal  <EOR> Reading all reviews seeing LONG line place last time Rio years ago expected much more got   Being huge seafood fan really looking forward coming here   Sadly very disappointed quality selection seafood   friend Buffet Buffets card did $15 upgrade into place   Honestly if over again would ONLY if Buffet Buffets card paid extra $15   definitely worth $40 charge   If going pay much seafood buffet itself would Bellagio Wynn hotel instead pay extra $10 more costs better quality   We 8 pm Friday night waited 10 minutes line then another 10 minutes seated   Overall wasn't long wait   Once did scope entire place directly hot seafood   found very small halves lobster tails 3 inches long 1 2 inch wide each   course grabbed bunch it   redeeming factor large plump crispy which means fresh shrimp mix lobster tails   weren't many but picked lot ones saw   Then some oysters   sad disappointment frozen thawing   could tell because ice them when ate partially frozen   okay considering only buffet trip along w Paris PH even oysters   Once thawed smelled tasted clean though nothing very exciting   Honestly those only seafood worthy things ate   crab claws long crab legs just okay   tell seafood isn't good because mushy   Fresh seafood plump crispy for shrimp lobster juicy   only fresh thing ate shrimp lobster tail mix   Other cold shrimp elsewhere pretty small didn't look appetizing me   don't seafood cold honestly   Anyway only other redeeming thing place variety desserts   But even then good but great     If you're okay just getting small lobster tails few plump shrimp weren't many mix some once frozen oysters then place would worth your extra $15 add your Buffet Buffets card   But itself worth it   Most buffets offer cold crab legs if want that   Nothing else unique most other buffets offer same things  <EOR> I came family 1999   believe lot fried seafood lot shrimp cocktail the quintessential Vegas food raw oysters    worst case food poisoning ever had   drove down check bunch colleges cal   remember throwing multiple college campuses including UCLA school ended going to   Since 1999 back few times no food poisoning they're okay book again   think key overdo cold raw seafood breeding grounds bacteria  <EOR> It's love hate relationship place   You love buffet hate yourself afterward   buffet still think best buffets LV   Large selection everything! but most all live seafood selections   Super fresh shell fish fresh incredibly sweet     We booked Buffet Buffet paid extra $15 pp buffet worth it   eaten 5 buffets 24 hrs crab each but Rio biggest sweetest crab legs   Plus only buffet served lobster  <EOR> King crab legs lobster absolutely dry  dip butter meat out  Snow Dungeness crab fresh all  Meat fell apart firm all very difficult shells  eat alot know good fresh firm seafood none here  $100 bucks 2 wasted  <EOR> ive many freakin times      i honestly prefer carnival better   because am those little bit everything type much more there     but if just wanting crab legs oysters    place would fine! dont remember price difference but way less packed carnival     if want avoid massive amounts people busy vegas weekend    come instead    its just other side casino   also    try gelato any ur favorite toppings    its die for!  i usually coffee w heath bar top and pistachio butterfinger   YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! <EOR> I'm sure why took 10 years try Rio Seafood Buffet   cause all Vegas buffets tried notch top list   All lobster tails eat some small but cares just eat double crab legs crab claws etc which all dunked nice bath drawn butter!
