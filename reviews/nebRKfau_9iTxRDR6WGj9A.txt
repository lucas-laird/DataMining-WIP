But settled shanghai lumpia because can't wrong appetizer   As listened everyone sing found next door dancing  sat wowed nieces nephews noticed great list  songs different genres filipino contemporary pop rock R B   Another thing noticed DJ would deliberately place herself lineup list individuals singing    IMHO   if alot people coming sing Kapuso minimize amount times DJ sings? Yes granted she talented but don't know  started seem she showboating especially noticed she would deliberately sing anyone sang really well just try them  kept thinking hopefully someone nominate The Voice Anyhow overall experience okay  family time spent upped rating four stars   If dimly lit karaoke bars place you   If want listen everyone including DJ sing place you  If craving filipino food want sing Dahil Say Yo afterwards? place you  If want dance favorite filipino party dances macarena ocho ocho electric slide then yes place you! <EOR> WHAT BUNCH CROOKS !
