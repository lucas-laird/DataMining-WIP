Was pleased service food until couple few months ago   noticeable change   noticed Hispanics served ahead very very well compensated  When order same plate same entree items container decidedly noticeably less full   first time odd   second time bothersome   Friday third time mad   would recommend location clean food usually fresh   equality service equity though recommend only Hispanics! <EOR> Always honey walnut shrimp fave! Wish wasn't pricey being 2 sons eat more typical person lol <EOR> The food great love coming but lately few people working  come lunch break but time almost done lunch over! Its really upseting favorite store  lines also long! hope store speeds more poeple 2 3 arent sufficient enough  If nothing changes panda express losing customers me  <EOR> Great customer service! Food delicous entire staff friendly  Great dining environment very clean  <EOR> A Very good Panda Express !!  love Orange chicken  alway fresh just all others !!   Really good customer server taking care customers showing them new items   Very clean Resturant love those panda picture  just right when walk place feels peaceful calm <EOR> this location always line but moves fast !!  food ALWAYS  OMG fresh  delicious always SMOKING hot smells heaven!   they awesome specials tons emploies never run anything!  I love panda new fav location! <EOR> Food good but might well call orange chicken spicy orange chicken because place piles chili flakes    Kind disappointing when take bite expecting usual sweet tasty chicken then bam! spice hits  all taste no amount soy sauce help   Sad say never back  <EOR> I usually Panda Express  veggies rice noodles always good  However chicken more often tough  coatings stale tasting smothers tiny bites chicken  Otherwise decent fast food  <EOR> I hate panda ALWAYS mess order anyways always gotta check twice now on   But other alright <EOR> Usually lot better  time around around fried rice chow mein orange chicken teriyaki chicken chicken egg roll  fried rice spoiled  tasted disgusting couldn't even finish food  waste money  <EOR> I usually don't write reviews such corporate places but impressed panda express every fresh clean everyone very nice ying check more then once she sweet everyone  <EOR> I walk into establishment around 10 20 am  just thinking getting some teriyaki chicken check display there's chicken  ask lady long it'll take she says 10 minutes head think  fine there's 4 people ahead anyway    The lady front ordered order day before pick she payed online everything  worker says oh see order office but no told wow lack communication sure  she tells it'll 15 minutes lady fine it  if placed order day before ready certain time arrive time ready would think  rather inconvenient    Anyway 8 minutes later time order want some chow mein but don't any which fine  order white rice ask teriyaki chicken again work again the same one tells it'll 10 minutes  But wait didn't just tell it'll 10 minutes 10 minutes ago? She just tells well they're still cooking settle some other options hadn't even set mind to  whole time she acted she attitude understand might little stressed even though only 5 customers whole establishment but there's no reason attitude slightly rude    All all they're lack communication poor customer service really turn down me  <EOR> I've never happy place  all time but every time food warm old   restrooms always clean staff very friendly <EOR> Same Quality most other panda express' have  Line moves quickly always free samples if want try something new  Parking lot little crowded depending time go  But thats everywhere  <EOR> Usually food good but today orders fried rice teriyaki chicken all nasty burned taste  Unfortunate  <EOR>
