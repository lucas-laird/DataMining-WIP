Food all know good but sevice always great thanks guys! <EOR> I several times food except tortilla chips always spot on  staff always friendly  chips always stale    never fails    very disappointing   The location always playing super loud music which any type meeting phone call impossible  location well maintained very clean personally don't getting utensils common bucket individually wrapped take eat home perfect eat never  <EOR> 4 stars guacamole alone  enjoy much known take dish potluck gathering  am tempted say best guacamole ever wouldn't surprised if evil secret ingredient good  Every time visit am re surprised its quality chips complement perfectly    What else eat? standard order crunchy tacos vegetarian burrito bowl  most part all ingredients fresh vegetarian burrito bowl wonderful because onions peppers guacamole no extra charge  now carry brown rice!  The quality service vary drastically  Some employees no problem being generous toppings  Others downright snarly  Overall however when am loss eat need quick reasonable healthy bite nearby Chipotle just fine long guac! <EOR> Good food great service! love chipotle uses responsible suppliers  <EOR> The food course excellent exception need better job trimming chicken  terms customer service particular location horrible!  Huge negative attitudes most employees  When running low any ingredient especially guacamole would wait until replenish supply clearly skimp  When called AA lady nose ring she absolute bitch  grabbed card David Zena when called discuss transpired did even answer phone  am big fan Chipotle however would recommend staying away location especially when busy  <EOR> Yum! Chipotle!  One just opened corner West Sahara Fort Apache where old Blockbuster used sit  Today opening day resist visit? swing around 8 30 work find line around 10 people deep  few tables being used patrons but mostly people ordering go  inside looks every other Chipotle  Granted super clean since today grand opening   I ordered Chicken burrito $5 85 Barbacoa Burrito $6 10 friend  line process did take little bit since employees new  Give them week two feel then lines probably fly faster    The food pretty consistent every other Chipotle  say? Its chain restaurant! definitely still fan Roberto's but see myself dropping once while  <EOR> Well chipotle if haven't Chapala yet then probably left under rock balls burrito salad's tacos basic Mexican food there's usually long line weight because become proficient serving people  lot different chipotles every once while though your cashiers nice bad day but other then love eating chipotle usually every other week <EOR> This place allows select want it  burrito bowl tacos soft hard even salad  place great light quick simple meal know natural it  if watching carbs place nice option    Today Carne asada burrito  wasn't watching carbs week enjoyed big stuffed burrito extra chips salsa  comes rice your choice beans I black beans choose your meat carne asada usually tender seasoned well  mild salsa reminds pico de gallo then add cheese sour cream   pretty big burrito!  What place its commitment quality products natural fresh know eating hear feel more healthy! even if burrito way many calories   <EOR> I love Chipotle  know chain all but well! Northeast Ohio where line stretch door around corner   Southwest but  expected more Mexican restaurants pseudo authentic choose from   The fresh organic ingredients Chipotle real draw me  But admit gateway restaurant when falling off raw vegan whole foods wagon come because serve fresh organic whole foods bad be? But honestly slippery slope here     What love Chipotle chips taste fresh guacamole best all chain restaurant guacamoles tried far season foods nicely everything very flavorful  feel getting good deal $8  menu small but  fine bigger menu may cause them slack off quality  Can't that!!    I always Burrito Bol  even tastes good next day just guacamole sour cream side  <EOR> My very first Chipotle experience! The place itself very nice clean   burritos guacamole delicious!  Unfortunately somewhat difficult communicate order employees   example would ask cheese burrito employee would nod put on   Speaking them Spanish didn't seem help might just very loud side counter    Also bit pricey kind food is   buy free coupon but don't think I'd often regular price   I would given Chipotle higher rating but while finishing last half burrito bit into biggest piece chewy veiny    cartilage? Ew   burrito awesome but seriously turned off  Since never weird chicken parts food Zaba's pretty sure just keep going there  <EOR> I'm huge fan Chipotle just location  staff slow unfriendly seem auto pilot   We've several times  Yesterday most recent visit  only person line ahead but slow helping afterwards filled order faxed 4 meals rather offering help us  When finally asked boyfriend each twice wanted because didn't listen first time  When boyfriend ordered girl asked which salsa he wanted he told she then ignored filled 2 to go salsas another order then paused re asked again which salsa he wanted  obnoxious  He told light sour cream she again ignored piled on  He pretty pissed told but didn't want wait remake whole meal he just scooped off when sat down   As food good  things love Chipotle consistency taste quality  love burrito bowls tacos  Yum! <EOR> I Chipotle least once week employees always smiling making experience wonderful  Customer Service important location locked  want shoutout Mariah always smiling face kind whenever come in  She above beyond sure customers happy experience when leave  well deserved recognition! ROCKSTAR EMPLOYEE #chipotle #chipotlelv #lasvegas #employees #recognition #customerserviceatitsbest #customerservice #awesome #thankyou <EOR> I gave them star because ridiculously unprofessional are  just me  But another lady wad upset because both same problem them having certain item  lady going help back talking other employees  All could hear laughing  She leaning over talking guys  She came back  lady asked if making guacamole  She said oh! sorry  forgot  lady next said f* walked out  furious well but also hungry   Another time there  older Mexican lady making significant other burrito  When asked want  She would put very small amount burrito  both looked each other asked add little more  Then she rolled eyes  significant other shocked  Later day  called complained rude unprofessional she was  second time she did same thing  told but little more  She would reply going extra   livid she being way  Usually when see her  usually drive away because don't want deal bs  haven't back   Just today significant other off work  decided hopefully something might change  Maybe might possibly cleaned act  He inside place order burrito  He asked guacamole side  told didn't any  But going some right moment  He asked long would take? told 10 minutes  Other 2 people where waiting same thing  workers line yells need guacamole  other people waiting heard laughing being rude  all giving them stink eye  significant felt really offended sh**ty people being  20 minutes came guacamole filled cup almost full  top off lady named Brooke frustrated giving attitude  He came back really pissed off told whole story experience  Once again shocking hear explain just happened  <EOR> I hate restaurant    Steam table meats rice stuffed into store bought tortilla?  Yum!!!    Btw rice does belong burrito   Especially case since pure filler   use around 3 ounces actual meat burritos estimating   salsas suck hot sauces canned hate fake branding twee cool hip unoriginal appealing    teen agers   teen aged daughter   She loves Chipotle   noticed more she loves something worse is   it     This place fake bad pure filler  <EOR> Smart friendly people good food  Ask sprinkle cilantro fabulous addition your burrito paradise experience! Yumma! also love place where left overs still delicious know saying? Toaster oven bowl BAM! New meal LOL   I dig it  service people location just plus always smiling everything prepared proper flow fresh but ready go! dig it  Kitty approved! <EOR> Wow some meat salty  really really salty  am going continue consume salty  Yikes  Service pretty rushed disorganized too  bit more anal close $2 small dollop guac?  pretty nice profit margin them! <EOR> So nasty BLOOD STEAK BOWL!!!  I disgusted customer service terrible stood around talking 5 minutes before helping cashier clearly intoxicated strong liquor smell breath   MY VISIT HORRENDOUS NEVER CHIPOTLE EVER AGAIN!!!!!!! <EOR> That don't impress much! disappointed last visit  boy toys brought quick lunch while running errands  ordered chicken bowl sparse  ordered flour tortilla side wrapped foil  ask reheat it  gave replacement hot resolved    The food fresh just don't think consistency good location compared others  <EOR> The new Sofritas tofu mixed spicy peppers tacos pretty tasty  added 2 kinds salsa pico corn mine bulk them up  Fresh name game Chipotle also why place usually busy   Once place your order line moves quickly  options burrito bowl tacos meat veggie choices then customize your desired toppings  <EOR> Sometimes find difficult eat Mexican food because am such picky eater  love tacos nachos but made simple  Unfortunately don't beans tomatoes onions jalapeños hot sauce etc  reason Chipotle GREAT! order anything menu just way want it! fresh ingredients watching employees food  far favorites soft tacos salad  Very delicious! Usually need least small amount dressing salads but eat without it!   I only ordered take location but restaurant always very clean organized  employees very friendly well  During last visit ordered chicken soft tacos  Although looked enough chicken fill tacos kindly asked if wanted wait another 2 minutes fresh batch agreed    I'm sure much healthier food but sure better alternative Taco Bell Del Taco! <EOR> This convenient location decent service but few glitches during visit    The first girl helped very nice put order but then another girl stepped in  She seemed attempting expedite orders but all she succeeded doing confusing everyone making take longer    Since already made requests first girl little annoying she required reiterate order her  She misheard ended putting wrong proteins order  When told mistake she seemed annoyed then whole line discombobulated redo order couldn't figure expedite while handling all orders behind me    Once everything back track things smoothly but little perturbed attitude    Food decent once home everyone but particular employ fine  <EOR>
