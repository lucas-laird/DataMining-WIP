Sure we're students but jesting condescending quips all night isn't really wanted hear especially when nowhere near rude sarcastic   Definitely didn't appreciate vulgarities talking way probably reason why no on friday night nonetheless    food pretty good appreciated student special but being told 'F%$k you' all night long even if stale attempt humor definitely weaned away chances returning eat again    2 stars good food less welcoming attitude  <EOR> Tacos no flavor!
