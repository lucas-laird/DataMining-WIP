 white Greek lawn ornaments roof restaurant dance floor inside huge chandelier hanging ceiling   I ordered stuffed grape leaves my favorite small Greek salad   grape leaves didn't come any dipping sauce but still good   There crazy hamburger menu consisted heaping pastrami top burger patty!  don't usually order burgers restaurants just read it  <EOR> I always enjoy dining Mad Greek  love gyro calamari daily lunch specials  awesome patio which enjoy some beautiful weather blessed nothing better meal cigar if enjoy cigars    I order fried calamari often lunch which comes ample serving calamari rice fries love rice salad  They've always perfect light coating flour spices cooked perfection all know simple dish calamari miserable experience when prepared correctly  no fear Mad Greek your calamari cravings! <EOR> I'm writing review sections eating foods     Our order consists Gyro plate Hamburger wife Fried Zucchini Saganaki  Saganaki aka Hopa Cheese bitter no presentation disappointed The Fried Zucchini fairly decent but good ranch dressing   Hamburger leaves lot desired flavoreless   Gyro plate ok thought funny waiter couldn't pronounce   cool  didn't think place fast food style  Maybe caught bad day but won't coming back but craving good Greek food maybe try somewhere else <EOR> Appetizer Tuesday  Baklava amazing touch cinnamon sweet gooey others  Also pita bread light fluffy  Tz sauce best ever tasted  little noisy but food good  Very extensive menu  <EOR> I've read over some reviews feel place getting beating fellow yelpers   I wouldn't say Mediterranean food connoisseur but know good food   This place good food     My fiancé stumbled dinner Christmas day   celebrated family Christmas Eve all day Christmas wanted away some time   walked seated right away   slow because EVERYTHING Summerlin closed day people probably figured too   surprised HUGE FULL bar karaoke stage dance floor huge projection tv blue lighting made place seem fun festive   could definitely see birthday party there   Anyways ordered hummus pita lamb shank plate lamb gyro   EVERYTHING good   hummus pita which more no charge lamb GYRO amazing rice   Dang rice good!  I am giving them 5 stars because food AWESOME   Yes service could probably better waitress reminded things but SUPER nice but we're talking $11 $17 meals   arm leg    and you're getting generous portions fun environment relatively nice service   would gladly GLADLY okay service awesome food price   After all all food isn't it? <EOR> Definitely disappointed  Heard lot place couldnt wait try it  Sadly only tedeeming quality place fries  server very accomodating nor he knowledgeable burgers toppings  really just impression he didnt care  burgers ordered sloppy did meet expectations whatsoever  place really needs some better servers  dine again  <EOR> Everything perfect! Piping hot gyros yummy margaritas kindest waitstaff! <EOR> We looking another Greek Mediterranean restaurant but GPS took into area  When found wasn't place decided eat instead  starving noticed 50% off appetizers during happy hour right time happy hour    The restaurant itself decorated gaudy style murals Acropolis other Greek style architecture walls ceilings  full sized bar which during HH all drinks discounted even non alcoholic ones   We hadn't looked yelp prior visiting obviously but meal managed look reviews other reviewers spot regarding book menu  listings really confused Japanese Italian offerings well  namely sashimi pasta   We stuck appetizer menu which consists cold appetizers hot appetizers  taking 3 pages   Taramosalata  wasn't bad but taste caviar did come through  Melanzanasalata  something  eggplant dip  nice tart finish  Spanokopita  FAIL! Trader Joe's version far better  obvious originally baked then when someone orders popped into deep fryer heat up  Totally disgusting!!  Falafel  grainy but rather mushy very dense! didn't much  Dolmas  version meat rice inside instead just rice  also creamy ish white sauce which didn't enhance all  Pass!  Greek pizza  pretty awful even young man didn't want eat it  took back hotel but no even attempted eat ended throwing away    Greek cheese olive plate  winner  liked lot  Two types cheeses offered along Kalamata olives   Did think food good? particularly  But some items weren't bad rest just plain awful  If pay full price I'd definitely tell pass! worth it  However 50% off bill actually quite reasonable ate  even able overlook some grosser items  Hubby two drinks alcoholic Greek cherry juice  iced tea  bill? $40  Now double you're looking $80  $80 I'd say totally awful meal  $40? easier swallow!  2 5 stars  <EOR> Pita greek village salad calamari onion soup GREAT!!!  KEFTEDES   DOLMATHES STAY AWAY UNLESS U CAPERS YOUR DOLMADES BTW greek extremely salty KEFTEDES peppery salty   even sent them back chef he said traditional he them     Well never ordering them again  am greek Italian      capers Italian  forgot parsley onions KEFTEDES <EOR> Disclaimer review might offend if aren't Greek take jokes seriously    They should call place Bad Greek  Actually maybe name warning    if arrive happy Greek once try terrible food leave Mad Greek    don't know back making food but cook should sent live Turks Cyprus being impressively bad being Greek  Maybe place opened Turkish housewife passive aggressive jab Greeks  could sit nothing but speculate all day people truly terrible life but then would hungry eventually which might cause need eat more crappy food   Kidding aside Greeks very hungry people   If luring starving Greeks your establishment most important thing should know eating joke us   don't burn freaking spanakopita   Especially if didn't even bother put more half teaspoon filling it    ESPECIALLY if minuscule four burnt spinach pie nibblets doesn't even correct filling it!!!  Did someone drop some jam there?  Why sweet??  why did nibblets consist almost nothing but burnt phyllo dough?!  like  merely reminder could been   Everything else mediocre best    Pre made cheap Italian dressing Anatolia salad can't call salata unless want confuse them  Dolmades piled sloppily under sea bland mystery sauce loosely rolled though Taco Bell burritos filled unvarying smoosh appeared instant rice  Pre crumbled feta    WTF?  really lazy cringe prospect clasping hand few times break some blocks feta?!  None should matter any Greek reading this    Because audacity serve badly burnt spanakopita no filling   pastry version worst frozen potstickers you've ever eaten   dare they!!  What created charliefoxtrot clusterfffff Mad Greek worse spitting food    spit soul   Don't mess hungry Greeks!!!  cool   Every time someone eat someone's yiayia drops dead    save yiayia don't ever eat here!!! <EOR> I don't know decor restaurant but gives off sort sober feel ambience  Maybe all shades blue used    Now complaining way good parts  First all escargot! Oh juicy snail goodness! only perfectly cooked seasoned but provide largest portion escargot come across Vegas  starter sold  grill plate mountain meats seasoned rice  While wasn't fan meatballs every other item platter delicious  Finished off couple glasses wine you've very happy fat kid    The staff extremely accommodating offering suggestions even teaching proper pronunciation spanakopita  All all would say place amazing just cheer room bit you're set! <EOR> I numerous Greek Mediterrean restaurants point good reference should expect   Overall food good service time wait order   More specifically food good but any better other places more reasonably priced   am willing dish nice meal but prices place seemed little high considering getting   outdoor seating place seems favorite number chain smokers entire meal complemented fragrant aroma cigarette smoke   interior is    very Greek   unfortunately going back place  <EOR> Came armed freebie free gyro am tried say gyro small salty dry  but service great  but probably back sorry just cannot take much salt food    <EOR> Greek salad gyro snack $8 during 11am 7pm happy hour really more happy day no? do ya snack  $4 each okay  gyro meat standard fare  However experience explosion Greek decor equally massive menu  mere size menu leaves concerned things can't fresh psychological effect  really serve best steak freshest fish Greek egg rolls done right?    The seemingly low prices trick into ordering lot more before knew spent little over $40  tried babaganoush despite big hunks eggplant thought fair  pita would describe white bread equivalent pita thick doughy which good but appreciate lighter pita   Our server nice even though she did forget bring drinks until first round food hit table  can't really put finger but overall experience didn't leave eager return  think less clutter streamlined menu would big difference  <EOR> I really should checked Yelp review place BEFORE decided visit whim   I really wanted place  brother's wife's mother owns restaurant called Mad Greek which fabulous place  thought sure any place shares name would share food atmosphere  guess mistaken   So before walk look sign see if open  sign off probably should taken hint left but decided anyway  am greeted waiter middle taking someone's order cannot seem understand  just end walking patio area because seemed fresh air would nice  Well fresh air mixed smoke would do   So minute two later waitress comes gives menu look takes drink order  When she comes back immediately order appetizer baba ganoush  She seems totally clueless just ordered nearly yanks menu hands she take because she needs remember order  know WTF?  The baba ganoush comes nearly immediately  guess premade just slap dish go  tell waitress need minute decide entree  turns need minute equates don't come check literally 20 minutes! fact don't see waitress again until order comes back instead end flagging down bus boy luckily came clean table only other group patio    I ask waitress but he insists he take order very broken English barely understand  tell order he sounds confused  point two items menu  guy still seems little clueless but walks off repeating order himself only return moments later  He pen highlights menu items ordered takes menu him  point really unsure if even getting ordered if neither waitress nor bus boy remember very simplistic orders   After all said done food very appetizing  ate little but baba ganoush which decent ended taking okra home  told waitress box soup hardly touched  she asks Didn't it? point kind dumbfounded  Why else would ask take home  atrocious  spell out?  Now see other reviews don't feel horrible giving place star  seems consensus place  really need iPhone already check reviews before bad dining decisions  <EOR> If want stop off see worlds largest thermometer some food then stop you  Mad Greek itself ok place  two locations Baker near Death Valley then near entrance LV  usually packed if Greek food then may you  remember falalel balls tasty weren't overly fried  creamy Tahini sauce accompanies most dishes which perfect since weather HOT! restaurant designed roman statues columns outside can't miss when exiting  inside more greek cafeteria congested lot seating space people match  Baker stop option decent bathroom said before if look left Mad Greek see large pole showing temperature  only found America although boasts shows right temperature its actually off couple degrees  <EOR> That Strawberry Shake though!!  It'll fat girl jog!  LOL! <EOR> Really disappointed  lived area many years seen restaurant Change once Greek place another always curious   say now never again   We came early based other yelp reviews excited try happy hour menu  waitress hands most confusing menu ever seen  There's space piece paper new menu items taped over section black sharpie crossing things out   did see happy hour menu when asked waitress she explained no longer serve happy hour because they've updated menu lunch specials  found strange  Service over all okay but waitress seemed bit confused   On horrible! Bacon wrapped shrimp 4 tiny pieces charcoal delivered us  Shrimp1 looked burnt but bit close tail frozen shrimp 2 burnt outside raw inside  Obviously cook took frozen shrimp wrapped bacon sound put under broiler until burnt thinking shrimp would cooked  Babbaganosh okay best ever had  But only thing readily ate  Meat ? pita sure if beef lamb since never asked  meat wanted but again thrown under broiler over cooked really didn't matter kinda meat was  Everything else platter average  Ground beef cheese don't remember called menu  asked wanted cooked course extra well done burnt outside  seasoning meat tender good need serve meatball style  But cheese??? supposed Kayseri cheese but saw cheese nowhere   There some interesting things menu would try but there   clearly feel having million crappy menu items potstickers anyone better having attention detail handful good well cooked menu items highlight  ethnicity restaurant  <EOR> I don't understand 3 stars standoffish eating because it  experience around 1 15 pm great  great 7 plus lunch specials  Everything delicious   home made pita bread fresh tasting best pita bread although haven't eaten lot Greek restaurants dining companion agreed  She also ordered Baba ghanoush appetizer never but keep dreaming don't even eggplant much  chicken breast phenomenal! seasoning use delicious did overlook chicken perfectly juicy! very pleased much wish lived closer  would regular spot healthy lunch dinner  Here great tip friend least once week friends some kind deal going if buy glass wine appetizer if order bottle believe 4  can't that  if over obnoxious strange Greek decor Greek food place yummy ever reasonable  also patio if eating outside  <EOR> We stumbled restaurant last night we'll happily stumble restaurant again anytime!
