I've only once all speak two things ordered   I absolutely loved cumin spiced lamb skewers  lamb fatty side but juicy punches cumin very flavorful  If cumin you'll love appetizer wish 10 more them    I wasn't crazy other thing ordered vermicelli noodle side dish  But lamb skewers worth trip alone  Looking menu looks some great stuff looking forward coming back soon  <EOR> I saw place few weeks ago anticipating its grand opening but greatly disappointed  heard going Canton Tea Restaurant but boy wrong  yet another typical Las Vegas Chinese restaurant same menu everybody else town BBQ King HK Star etc    nothing Canton even HK style restaurant  even serve Pho which already quite place but didn't even available when there    We came day grand opening more half menu wasn't available order  veggies only lettuce nothing else wanted charge $7 it  Seriously? SF supermarket right next door  hard walk over buy some ingredients?  We ended ordering two clay pots which waiter recommended order because would feed five people but when came looked look pizza hut personal pan style servings  size pot looks wouldn't enough even person charging $6 it  Tony's review correct literally looks just mixed rice some meat added some sauce oil then put claypot  no crisp burnt rice sticking against pot    We also ordered beef dry chow fun which ok tasting but lacked wok air   still hungry ordered some salty fish chicken fried rice  decent but portion small    Service most disappointing part experience  understand second day operation but waiters literally looked just started working very first time  Menus given immediately when sat down  remind them give basic utensils napkins  Tea promptly refilled when out  literally didn't study own menu  ordered dish name didn't know menu item # where find it  might pet peeve mine but NEVER EVER received receipt check book thingy upside down   Honest say never come again would recommend anybody come here  only thing going them decorations which interior better looking before Ay Chung   <EOR> very nice clean place  very nice menu very much enjoyed lo mein tofu  Place open all nite think also    great swing shift workers     <EOR> I twice month because good experience first time second time didn't disappoint me  Before store changed Kung Fu Chef another Taiwanese restaurant  decoration doesn't change lot but menu totally different food even better   For two time experience both ordered clay pot rice shrimp sauce pork first  chicken second  waitress said needed wait 20 mins but understood supposed prepared cooked long  Also cheap price delicious favor willing wait  great through idea them small bowl soup served pot  When almost finished poured soup into pot mixed scorched rice sticking pot  really really nice attentive customers   We also ordered chicken wings goose intestines fried calamari  All tasted really good  did some problems fried calamari since added vinegar but friends didn't immediately made new dish  Very kind guests truly  drinks didn't put lot expectations it  liked almond milk tea but friend's coffee milk tea just soso   Overall worth 5 stars since polite servers tasty food enough lamplight certainly again  <EOR> Ugh   really expecting something better   stopped lunch around 1pm Monday service very slow   gentleman helped quite friendly obviously busy keeping place clean and very clean but even wait more 10 minutes just menus then another 20 food  We ordered twice cooked pork salt pepper chicken wing appetizer Mongolian beef lychee slush boba added  Though menu said choice soup pork lunch special brought bean curd seaweed   broth thickened much starch very little flavor besides salt   pork dish came before even second spoonful soup asked chicken wings   told don't serve appetizers first American restaurants   Hmmm really?   A minute later received Mongolian beef chicken wings right behind    I really wouldn't minded if food good   did all seem quite fresh but only thing liked refreshing slush   realized when ordered twice cooked pork actually pork belly   Perhaps fault but neither guest liked it   sauce rather good but fat tough bite through  The Mongolian Beef dish many versions worst iteration yet   lot onion barely touched wok raw sauce quite sweet thick though came straight bottle   served some fried rice unpleasant flavor  The wings bad coating crispy fried just right   didn't love flavoring which bit much 5 spice but least could eat share these   other two dishes shared even halfway eaten time ready leave  <EOR> A clean well lit place pho enjoy something tasty     Even though Kung Fu Chef predominantly Chinese restaurant also serve pho ever!    The Pho Tai med rare thin sliced beef maybe best Pho valley   bowl fabulous pho fragrant flavorful fulfilling   Vermicelli just right texture symphony wow  good flavors excited next bite   cilantro onion stood most soup since love both those things very satisfied    The servers very friendly happy answer all American questions usually beginning what's this? Kung Fu Chef all good tasting Pho diverse selection Chinese cuisine great value warm inviting atmosphere  <EOR> Came lunch today  regular menu lunch special menu  believe lunch specials $4 95  However decided order off regular menu which still fairly cheap  ordered filet veggies beef fried noodles wonton soup salt pepper calamari   Food overall just OK  bad but maybe worth repeat visit unless necessary    Servers overall friendly restaurant clean spacious    I think would only come back if usual go to places Chinatown closed busy  <EOR> With name Kung Fu Chef place doesn't pretend destination Asian gourmand but flexible late night hours extremely reasonable prices ideal pitstop LV local coming off long day's work tired cook home tourist down luck casino needing affordable pick me rally second round   As sat down bubbly server offered choice iced water hot tea which assumed complementary but also wide array boba drinks well   gravitated towards noodle soups since all priced between 5 8 dollars server recommended salted chicken noodle soup which turned steaming bowl thin cantonese egg noodles some chinese greens mild chicken broth served alongside sliced boiled bone in chicken much hainanese chicken brined herbal salt mixture perfectly seasoned throughout every bite juicy succulent texture   combination two eaten together quite harmonious definitely don't skimp portions either   definitely pleased modern decor space well lit Asian eatery standards   gentleman presumably manager made rounds each table checking all customers offering provide extra sauce chicken upon request pleasant surprise well     Definitely place worth *punching* into your GPS *kicking* back friends some good eats without *flipping* over bill  <EOR> Jade just happened stumble upon place   using Chinatown meet destination just happen see huge Lunch Special Banner hanging outside   walking around premises looking dining options opted Kung Fu Chef   Pros * LARGE MENU SELECTION PRICING tons choices all very reasonable prices   Lo Mein Fried Rice all variations ranged price $4 99 $8 99   also options Clay Pot dishes Seafood even ever so popular Pho   some menu items never seen before Salt Fish Sausages Brine Duck Tongue Lamb Stick just name few    even mentioned Andrew Zimmern would probably take liking place   If memory serves correctly Lunch specials started $4 99   didn't any specials but definitely some appealing options worth considering those dining budget    *  ATMOSPHERE atmosphere very well lit dining area itself very large size   tables large enough bigger parties just case wondering    Due excessive floor space seating did feel congested    always good thing   weird thing though restaurant appeared split into 2 different sections   think just due layout floor   *  SERVICE   server very nice informative when questions menu menu items   She provided recommendations very patient when trying decide order   Cons *  SERVICE   Yes service good when received but never really checked back us   felt Tea served ceramic tea cups good but Jade felt bland taste   dying some ice water but wave someone down it   sure if server would bring bill table few minutes waiting ended going register waiting pay     *  STEW BEEF RADISH HOT POT   Let first say Hot Pot dish new but figured we'd venture try something ordinary typical picks   Maybe those require acquired taste buds but whatever did taste appetizing   figured maybe its just but Jade felt same way   ended barely touching trying stomach did have   fan particular dish   Ordered *  SALT PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS menu reads Fried Chicken Wings but when ordered server said talking salt pepper chicken wings right?
