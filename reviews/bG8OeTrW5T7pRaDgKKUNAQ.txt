Some familiarity corner!   I think now most all people heard seen experienced food Celebrity Chef Wolfgang Puck  mean he even canned soups TV dinners available!   At small restaurant pre packed salads bottled specialty drinks fresh fruit snacks all available quick purchase register    They even casual restaurant section sit down meals offering pizza sandwiches beer tap vodka shots wine if will   Having unpredictability when flight going take off grabbed some snacks opted simple glass Cabernet Wolfgang's signature line    Prices steep expectedly being located airport  9oz pour approx  $15   Service really attentive quick  She responded promptly when asked bill closed tab  walking back gate everyone already boarded last few trickle in    Phewww!
