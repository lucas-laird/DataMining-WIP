He decided approach table just time because both agreed going hop over BurgerBar next door if somebody didn't approach table soon  probably should gone anyway but didn't    As food nothing spectacular  started caprese salad before meal  edible but delicious  mozzarella did taste fresh barely any basil  something I'd recommend  husband ordered fettuccine alfredo ordered eggplant parmesan  He said fettuccine pretty good  eggplant parmesan just ok  tasty but greasy    All things considered bother back Giorgio  plenty other places choose from! <EOR> After long day tradeshow doesn't want sit down friends booze some good food?  place perfect just that   pretty empty Tuesday night way it!  tried ton stuff all pretty darn yummy    #1 favorite Baked mushroom covered cheese garlic perfect  #2 favorite House red wine smooth just dr  ordered  #3 favorite Salad name but don't remember was   endive parmesan cheese some other greens   Yum  #4 Fettucini Alfredo heavy just right  ton pepper totally wanted  #5 Caprese salad wrong?

There no wait able table right away  service excellent  received bread food exceptionally fast!   I ordered caprese salad papardelle sausage tomato cream sauce  REALLY impressed! Because restaurant wasn't pricey other places gone expected quality much lower  But pasta wonderful! tomatoes aren't season now weren't great but mozzarella salad plus little balsamic vinegar made much better   This cheapest meals granted ordered 2 salads 2 entrees $54  If you're looking something more low key good place come! <EOR> Came reservations group 8   did somewhat tacky mall food overly casual atmosphere front restaurant   If table back restaurant where more intimate feel restaurant mall eatery   Otherwise Giorgio good!  appetizers fine service great violinist friendly    pasta special which parpadelle lobster lobster bisque sauce day delicious large portion!  Almost everyone table that  <EOR> Looking back nothing horrible Caffe Giorgio but nothing even slightly memorable  really wish ate Burger Bar again instead  <EOR> We pretty unfortunate experience place  Unfortunate because don't think should bad   Service pretty awful  server took forever even taking initial order  ordered appetizer then he came back table 5 minutes told he forgot put order just canceled it   The place wasn't even busy!  My friends gave food mixed reviews but fettuccine alfredo chicken actually pretty delicious   There definitely better places Vegas eat Mandalay Bay matter    but if work service I'd say good place some affordable Italian  <EOR> Thursday January 8 2010 third night Vegas On first night Vegas noticed restaurant shoppes area Mandalay Bay  hotel before eaten Burger Bar but never noticed quaint little restaurant  asked girl if she'd want eat there  actually tried second night but weren't seating anymore decided try again next night  Let start off saying food good really good price  liked wasn't packed wasn't loud  more kind restaurant used eating at  refined anyway but more   comfortable  Feels sitting down eat Sicilian family favorite restaurant back home which gone now   If want nice dinner good price  don't want seen would if celebrity chef restaurants pretty much dime dozen now Vegas  your spot  Try out! <EOR>
