seasoned cooked  melted mouth   I back again  <EOR> What nice place! am probably biased friends took bday celebration  atmosphere relaxing staff friendly  I tried Koi LA couple years back enchanted service  definitely better! <EOR> This review nightclub   My friends picked bunch tickets NYE 2011  When first already problem getting inside  early  seems missing arm bands  think waited 30 minutes before found person ran off them   When inside found main bar packed  took sometime drinks  But hey drinks free because package deal  walking around found multiple bars  No really knew bars other parts club  bartenders very cool  chatted couple them while grabbing drinks   The restrooms well say them  enough stalls venue  lines long ran down stairs use casino restrooms other side building  When another huge line  point wasn't sure if better off staying club not   Upon leaving club having good time despite all pit falls encountered another problem coat check  don't know happened but where night hell  staff calling random numbers looking people pick coats instead properly taking each person come  line  sure but one   After watching employees calling random numbers letting people cut line saying okay  bunch started voicing opinions  told move outside form another line   Everyone packed outside door waiting  even five minutes before another line formed inside just gave don't know shrug everyone outside  Seriously going here   Well bunch back forth hollering asking talk somebody charge finally coats  wasted hour twenty minutes life  Seriously am never coming back place  felt largest group they've ever had  just couldn't handle it  many people working door but nothing done right  Sorry guys if together am sure place well  <EOR> If possible Koi should receive zero star rating   reason BF along friends came because Planet Hollywood gave dinner credit being hotel guests   The ambiance nice being Vegas service wasn't shabby but food seriously lacking amount spent   6 spent over $100 each including dinner credit received   If knew less yummy meal would cost much would gotten spa credit instead   We ordered kobe beef roll quite disappointing   don't think real kobe wagu beef all   wasn't tender didn't melt your mouth effect   special crispy tuna crispy all   Sweet shrimp more baby sweet shrimp   half size back home least 3 times cheaper   don't prepare heads fried either   mention $12 3 little cubes adashi tofu   ice cubes ice water bigger size tofu   rainbow roll just home if any Korean owned Japanese sushi places but again 3 times more expensive Koi   very skimpy uni small portions   matter affect everything tiny little portions designed babies cost least $30 pop   By all means if money blow then guess come eat but food isn't orgasmic  <EOR> Ok review restaurant specifically refers experience semi large party 8 people guess take grain salt if only going two other people        seated promptly greeted waitress Robin took drink orders quickly rattled specials  sure special dishes actually though Robin every dish all ingredients memorized boredly pushed through list dished forcefully without pausing breath any questions  Upon being ask order told waitress wanted Seared Tuna Jalapeno Garlic Chips listed under Koi Signature dishes which she promptly condescendingly told appetizer  bit taken aback asked around table everyone else's order before coming back me  debating options minute sister convinced just because appetizer portions usually somewhat larger could share it plus gives shit waitress thinks   looked waitress nowhere seen   she returned ten minutes later only sister flagged down pointed she forgot take order before prancing off  Finally having wrangled asked portion size Seared Tuna made point saying going split main course  She hummed hawed but very specific attentive asking She basically said yeah fine wrote order down left         Waiting around food enjoyed atmosphere music  place really nice very classy  glancing around look toward sushi bar notice waitress trying unplug bottle Sriracha squirt onto plate  Now love some Sriracha but would say especially gourmet chili sauce found somewhat disheartening witness being squirted all over dish charge $30 for  retrospect think scene basically sums experience Koi LV         food arrives Robin waitress hands plate sparingly covered 5 6 tiny thin pieces tuna each chunk raw jalapeno few flakes apparently dried garlic  recap dish ordered called Seared Tuna Jalapeno Garlic Chips  Having ordered seared tuna several restaurants before being regular sushi eater expecting sashimi sized chunks fish good sear each side  pieces fish basically 1x2 inch slices deli meat style tuna   it thin see through  result fish did retain any kind sear typically steak y taste texture traditionally seared tuna  fish itself mediocre quality only dominant flavor dish jalapeno which would more successful diced evenly distributed fish rather chunk right middle  Furthermore exceedingly small portion large enough person eat meal let alone two people share asked certainly worth $16+ charged it   I  was  pissed  apparently written face because waitress hurriedly asked if needed something which replied felt extremely misled information she gave dish    She tried argue all sashimi came ultra thin deli slices that ! but having it  She then tried push order something else until told did intend spend any more money shitty service tiny amounts mediocre food         point think should mention parties 8 more charge 19% gratuity fee  feel extremely relevant experience experience other people party because very much those cases where knowing gratuity fee person waiting does totally lame job because don't work tip  Very uncool  all agreed server pushy condescending basically did half assed job entire time   and she still left $90 tip wtf       should also point dish only determined party inadequate portion size quality especially relation price paying it         Also several people said thought weird used crappy wasabi paste rather real good stuff         things tried liked I'd recommend Creamy rock shrimp tempura Tiger roll Chicken Yakitori Tempura Shrimp Roll All which good exceptional quality portion size    Final thoughts Head Koi if love lame sushi hate your money  <EOR> I fairly impressed food   Appetizers fresh well prepared   Service perfect   Sushi fresh very well seasoned   Only critique would rice mushy side  <EOR> If could give 0 stars would   impressed whatsoever   local sushi house Jax FL better sushi   wife ordered seared ahi tuna
