My family ordered chicken pesto pizza pepperoni pizza specialty pizzas which sausage peppers  Immediately noticed don't grated mozzarella simply just distribute ball mozzarella pizza  Other cheese they're skimpy toppings! pizzas arrived less 5 minutes placed orders each 2 3 small slices  Honestly price $9 $15 pizza would rather saved credit use next day different establishment  pizzas except chicken pesto bland crust extremely thin  also want mention some sort bubble pizza specialty pizza employee remade checked see if satisfied food  Great service!  If didn't $50 credit Monte Carlo probably wouldn't choose 800 Degrees  am however impressed exceptional customer service practiced establishment! <EOR> Fresh made pizza 90 seconds dream come true!!!  I LOVE concept place pick your fresh made dough sauce all toppings your little heart could desire    Cooked fresh 90 seconds!!!  Service lacking but fast food atmosphere  Prices typical ridiculous Vegas prices drinks things but pizza itself only $8 some change  <EOR> It's just ok    I love ingredients fresh choose on  However SELECTIVE  more ingredients add heavier more soggy crust gets  But only soggy center but burnt crust  Seriously burnt where peeled off pieces  weren't only ones overcooked crust  However people ordered only 3 ish toppings pizza crust good    The chopped salad good also! <EOR> Overly expensive Blaze Pizza Rev style pizza spot  Decent options     $1 50 PER topping forced eat specialities pies   usually eat vegan    but $1 50 forced eat boring type pizza $15  pizza  JUT pizza  <EOR> I am fan soggy pizza crust  got  liked taste fire cooked dough however soggy  Margherita Italian sausage  pepperoni  cheese sauce pesto onions sausage tasted good  ingredients looked fresh behind glass saw  ample seating pics posted show nice sized area eat  Dishes eat off soda machine  would try once again because love pizza  If follow them Instagram pizza day 50% currently  <EOR> A bake your custom created pizza less 60 seconds pizza place 800 Degrees interesting restaurant try  came during lunch hours group friends each waited 20 minutes before being able create own pizza  Once enter line opportunity choose pizza base add toppings  choose created pizza types    I decided choose classic Margherita pizza base added pepperoni each additional topping $1 50   employees very professional advertised pizza cooked very quickly maybe quickly    My pizza soggy oily many pizzas friends ordered  messy eat    Three stars because neat concept nice restaurant ambiance no TV way but probably would come again  <EOR> This worst pizza place ever    I eaten pizza Africa better  pizza served raw middle tried explain way supposed RAW! sent them back manager made knew ones wrong pizzas which again served RAW !   And cheap pizza 6 pizzas 4 beer 1 coke $200 00  So RAW pizza bad sauce Raw Pizza bad sauce wrong toppings left table uneaten  did money back because manager says raw centre it   WORST PIZZA EVER! <EOR> When think 800° name place believe trying pizza stands hell because  hot must hell! pizza just terrible! friends shocked just bad is  stayed Monte Carlo Hotel currently under renovation only place opened 11 PM  thought    Pizza?    easy  line impressively long likely because only restaurant open 11 PM hotel  slow service waited line quite bit which likely why line long  ordered margarita pizza also ordered Filetti pizza pesto tomatoes basil   option upgrade better quality mozzarella chose that  charge six dollars per pizza  The pizzas might well 'dunked' water  watery watery soft crust just disgusting  cheese came right off crust practically almost ate separate crust bread  margarita pizza OK except fact watery soft  other pizza just disgusting laden garlic overkill those tomatoes but nowhere explained menu   So why star only? Simple    Because exorbitant price such poor quality  total two pizzas small size pizzas two diet Pepsi's almost $50! Just no! Next time if stay hotel order elsewhere  would never try place again  Some worst pizza ever had  would waste money here  <EOR> Decent prices very quick! order crispy crust Tropicale gluten free Zucca pizza  gluten free crust great very thin which however crispy bit burnt  actually re make crispy pizza because first totally burnt bottom second still little burnt but whatever  great variety interesting toppings choose specialty pizza options pretty good  Tropicale pizza amazing pineapple fresh which appreciated  Zucca pizza much olive oil though dripping all down arm  Over all good experience! <EOR> My lady found place while looking places eat while conference  decided check since pizza diet staples    We greeted some most customer focused sincere menu knowledgeable restaurant staff ever encountered    The pizza amazing  ordered margherita pizza Gorgonzola salad two beers water  All $30  Vegas?

Yes   Would better if could rationalize spending $1 50 per topping personal size pizza? Yes    You choose your base which contains sauce cheese  chose Bianca which olive oil sauce mozzarella cheese    Then choose your toppings! 1 50 piece  What?! number similar places back home Chicago never pay topping  ended sausage tomatoes    Don't wrong actually pretty good pizza  just ticked ended costing much two people when hoping more low cost dinner  But hey Vegas guess  <EOR> We hungry  south end Las Vegas Blvd  mood pizza  Cue 800 Degrees spot seen many time but haven't curious enough step into until recently    I didn't realize build your own pizza kind place before studying outdoor menu  Though novelty passed still every now then    The pizza all right  service where visit south  exception dough master greeted beginning staff pretty much inattentive inefficient  practically fell asleep while putting toppings literally snoozing between ingredients grouped order another customer's lost sight before register when came time finally pay failed swipe M Life card placed hands  Give people some proper coffee breaks!

Each add on ingredient pretty expensive which really limits kind pizza would liked build   pizza pretty much meant enjoyed right away   thin crust pizza lot weight doesn't stay hot long soggy quickly if don't eat it   downsides 800 deg oven some not lot crust burned   really don't care much eating blackened crust pieces lazy pick them all off     Very cool try once   Now chain LA couple times    over it   better fast fire pizzas places also maintain very high quality ingredients better overall pizza lower overall price  <EOR> Für den schnellen Hunger ideal! Die Pizzen werden frisch gemacht und können individuell belegt werden    Dünner Boden gute Zutaten schmecken herrlich!!! Preislich sehr moderat! Freundlich! Wir waren im SLS Hotel 800 degrees gibts öfter Vegas    <EOR> 800 Degrees very special place heart because frequented its other location LA often probably 4 5 times month wish kidding being alma mater's neighborhood UCLA Westwood BRUINS   comfort food  brings back college nostalgia  Also really high quality pizza  almost fast food joint but fancy one?   800 Degrees other make your own customizable pizza places Blaze Mod Pieology because think toppings bases lot more gourmet  don't think place comparable because quality higher!  I always margherita base did same location  top added butternut squash mushrooms literally 5 types mushrooms blend kidding pine nuts soppressata broccolini corn arugula  Yes pizza aggressive but good  customize your pizza wood fired short time your food ready    **Note your pizza cooked little longer crispy because toppings tend slide off pretty easily since pie very thin  always eat pizza fork knife all toppings bite    Other bases marinara verde pine nut pesto bianca white no sauce   ton meats put top your pizza cheese selection also great added fontina top pizza before    Also eat entire pizza myself sitting but am pretty stuffed end thinking names food baby warned very full   The only reason giving location 4 stars instead 5 LA locations because Vegas little more expensive  sense given tourist location but still sad  <EOR> Don't know happened place  yesterday afternoon place filthy  only maybe five six other customers clean table  guy walking around bar towel spreading filth around each table  dirty when he finished before he started  Finally grab bunch napkins clean own spot best could  Silverware dirty looking covered spots  top off pizza very good   I highly recommend check clean table before placing your order  probably won't back  <EOR> Finally around trying place disappointment   place similar Pieology select crust sauce add toppings except while Pieology flat rate place better ready shell some cash anything other cheese   while staring toppings would nice if labeled   just picked obvious ones wanted because didn't feel sitting 10 minutes asking guy whats that   and that   and that?    Maybe just don't know high society toppings but would nice know everything was   So picking everything pizza's down assembly line into 800 degree oven gasp    bring pizza cut call people's number come pick up   let down pizza was   Some parts cheese didn't melted all way   Crust soggy   Everything blah   Considering basically $17 pie total bomb   If going rank among other pizza places tried would right below Little Caesars   save yourself disappointment Secret Pizza Cosmopolitan even Five50 pizza Aria   if you're still bent getting disappointment pizza CVS microwaveable one   least wouldn't total rip off  <EOR> So good! best pizza long remember not exaggerating ! Crust perfect thick thin full flavor sauce toppings fresh delicious  salad very filling top quality lettuce toppings very delicious salad I'd eat often if could same fresh healthy toppings pizza  Perfect place if you're starving vegas worth every penny!  I hope expand locations! <EOR> 800 degrees disappointment  Probably worst build your own sports ever too  light handed everything down sauce  Add ons 1 50 per topping still sit count your pepperoni  Pizza done quick but lacked taste department  $15 + dollars your money better spent  Only thing good place close proximity Strip MGM  <EOR> Good concept however location cannot execute properly   First all ordered cracker thin crust location no such option although listed menu   novices making pizza just novices   seems first foray into food industry seem apathetic overwhelmed   no quality control dough soggy   better training better staff tweaking assembly line place could good   think overwhelmed poorly trained staff cannot handle volume   Don't fooled video website experience pizza have  <EOR> So being LA same version your own pizza    aka pieology  Anyways going impressed selections add your pizza  wasn't impressed $1 50 every additional topping Your $8 pizza turn into 15 quick     Anyways being okay pizza service sucks !!! must order least 3 times three different people before pay hope third time don't mess your order which did  never experienced someone your table take your food give smaller portion  All say feel bad person touch salad me  worse part guy argued ordered  Keep moving people plenty other restaurants over priced probably enjoy  <EOR> I stayed Monte Carlo decided try place AMAZING! Bianca pizza added bacon basil Caesar salad  fresh flavorful delicious! But 1 50 added toppings little pricey but delish  <EOR> Great fresh made pizza! just returned fourth trip Italy haven't eaten pizza states since returning    Quick service interactive yummy!! Birra Moretti which also happy!   Come glad did! <EOR> This place similar Blaze Pieology if even those places  subway pizza  prices kind ridiculous thought  $1 50 every topping want  Also don't many topping options Blaze Pieology but use fresh mozzarella cheese  service just normal  would eat again because love pizza buts those places absolutely try when Vegas  <EOR> if you're fan thin crust your place  pizzas pretty reasonably priced definitely split between two people smaller appetites  Amazing crust fresh toppings    I see others complained toppings sliding off  good thing because means lot toppings pizza  True thin crust doesn't hold toppings well say Dominos Pizza fold pizza over keep all in    Service great everyone super friendly!  Will definitely come back place  <EOR> The pizza dough really good bit pricey pizza but does come fresh  other spots where cheaper same flavor  crust crispy soft middle cheese toppings  service nice friendly  <EOR> The pizza just ok  If build your own charge $1 50 topping  chose margherita base but mozzarella use chunks rather shredded cheese evenly  distributed    They good ice creams!   I gave them extra star 3 employees because all nice accommodating  Shout Thomas making pizzas! <EOR> Not sure hype place is    This subway pizza   pick crust chose thin which no taste     Then pick sauce   sure why call crushed tomato sauce when liquified catsup    They put hint cheese toppings   treat topping if going broke  Scarcely putting any toppings tasteless bland pizza      And $15     this place never visit again    And compliment tasteless product 9 people behind counter act working chain gang  No smiling interactions customers each other   all look pissed off being there    And bad attitude pairs lousy food  <EOR> Best pizza strip   Great prices wine beer choices   ingredients fresh huge variety topping options   carni must meat lovers loved zucca! <EOR> Huge portion delish made order pizza  Perfect crust salad fresh  romain bit wilted heat but fault billion degrees Vegas! <EOR>
