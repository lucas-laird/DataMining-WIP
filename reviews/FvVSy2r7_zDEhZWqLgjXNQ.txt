Because more just meal food ordered     I saw stuffed cabbage menu uder Starters thought would start that   also made mind pastrami reuben   Little did know cabbage would come size small baby served whole bagel   soon cabbage came table knew trouble   joked waitress may need to go box before day over   When she saw glazed over look eyes when sandwich came she looked said Yeah you're gonna need box   Let know when you're ready  The cabbage hands down best ever had   tender enough eat spoon   no choking down tough cabbage leaves   sauce tomato perfection   meatloaf within formed well held its shape better mama do   could perhaps even should made meal just cabbage   But no sandwich too    sandwich searching Las Vegas years   Pastrami stacked higher mouth allow covered gooey melty cheese soaked dressing topped crunchy mild sauerkraut   magnificant sight behold   battered fries macaroni salad pickle spear plate all added feast     At time surrender eaten half cabbage half bagel half reuben macaroni salad few fries   thought might need wheel chair roll fat butt back car   leftovers ended no less two more meals   meal remainder cabbage bagel   other reuben fries lunch following day   $26 meal soon turned into three more resonable $8 change per easier justify  <EOR> Let start saying food excellent   am New Yorker closest Jewish NY food all favorites Ive outside NY   being said am upset place   keep coming back since love food but each time remember why takes long come again   servers typically nice   wait promptly rude   its passive aggressive kind rude fake smile   nice server thats it   Most times takes them forever even come over initially  tables consistently well bussed either   time crumbs chair   asked wiped down politely told supposed wipe chairs huh?    totally didn't questioned she said isn't good seats only crumbs then wiped it   Seriously prices food entitled sit clean chair someone else's mess   Especially since price several items when sit versus counter   also didn't appreciate bones whitefish salad last ate though understand happens  <EOR> This review bakery side sit down restaurant       did eat but just picked some pastries bagels go!  There aren't many superb salt bagels talking good ones white granules all over bagel combination but fresh white salt granules!

Had such high expectations since am New York Long Island known joy real Bagel shops   Really Bagel Cafe your photos beautiful   your presentation enticing      You Hamentashen!  But left booth window mouth full Meh   SERVICE Counter help women very cordial seem disinterested helping answering questions  Stood while just ignored making own coffee being snobby  service business shouldn't people feel comfortable when come through door? wasn't just way treated  Watched other patrons similar cold attitude  IMHO  Deli counter staff men nice helpful  engaged    One waitress over worked   but cordial    FOOD BAGELS GENERALLY GREAT Coffee good  Bagels great  Lots Cream cheese options things put Bagels abound  There emphasis real traditional Jewish food which really appreciate finding LV! But although Bagel Cafe niche market offers loads variety       FOOD OTHER Ordered feta spinach omelet  came glob feta spot  Feta sour melted Greek style  much grease butter used cooking    Muffins large lovely but oddly lacking flavor   Took some other pastries home found them OK none wonderful taste rather bland exciting mouth  Eating bite cranberry muffin write   chew swallow try once more Nope still Meh!

If concerned saturated fats wouldn't eating any first place   I even gone far requesting lot extra fat always comes table trimmed tasteless  Without rich flavor changes Corned beef peppered beef  Completely altering taste drying meat out   I know most everybody being health conscious days would disagree but old die hards old fashioned way really best   If want decent corned beef now own   You really cannot find authentic place town having lived years speak experience   My Bubbe would rolling grave    <EOR> This place awesome   big fan breakfast food but place draws in   wide selection fresh made bagels cream cheese   great bakery   lover sandwiches try French dip    Also Matzah Ball Soup   parking terrible   enough spaces spaces small   prices tad high but still very reasonable   menus made look newspapers   bakery if nothing else disappointed  <EOR> HUGE PORTIONS!!

Bagel Cafe mile away another stand by   but anymore   First breakfast food sandwiches still great    probably never going change   But don't dinner anymore used to   Maybe don't order steak place called Bagel Cafe but last two times wife wanted steak while kids wanted Matzoh Ball soup stuffed cabbage! steak nearly inedible gristly thin cooked evenly would hate see expiration date meat tasted pretty rancid   almost picture Gordon Ramsay discovers something disgusting Kitchen Nitemares moment covering mouth over trash bin tirade expletives   Which brings other HUGE gripe Bagel Cafe    and pleasant   bathrooms   are disgusting   'nuff said   Maybe result huge traffic morning brunch simply can't stop check clean bathrooms during day??  There's no excuse disgusting bathrooms restaurant probably no greater turn off mention health issues   Clearly dinner target meal though still list many great specials least nights they're open past 5 p m  any day except Sun Tue thnk    fair traditional NY Deli type items still great yes love tongue liver whitefish other hard to find deli sandwiches knishes etc     Bagel selection?  Fabulous   pastries still LOOK good ever but sometimes 2 3 bites wish less sweet less BIG tasted little more 'special'   Matzoh Ball soup?  Excellent if rich thick ultra brothy variety sometimes even layer fat oil floating top   Now happen but today's finicky health conscious 2010 diner may immediately turned off    and watch occasional bone shard!   My last gripe Bagel Cafe?  tabletops small!  Maybe sense false entitlement comfortable seating but huge platter size dishes and additional plates 'sides' use 4 top 4 people even when 2 kids becomes challenge space planning creative plate stacking   OK maybe gets people quicker   but note legitimate complaint   booths slightly roomier but much   feel sitting back row Southwest 737 seatback traytable upright positions      I wish could nicer place!  servers friendly fun kitchen staff often comes yuks clientele   Maybe oughta someone also rounds bathrooms too      All adds first 1 star rating     Oh yeah   someone else mentioned cashiers   YES problems related also   2 years ago saw triplicate charges coming through credit card month dining here   resolved problem running credits through fact but bring attention   Also if watch your account you'll notice take FOREVER clear your payment which always indication internal controls policies may lacking  <EOR> Terrible service terrible communication Bob behind bar actually manager beyond rude  Screaming counter many cookies wanted he knew proper box put just take order dude then could put whatever size box   I drove all way strip come because reviews reputations never again food just okay former Jewish New Yorker just okay  OH PS if u order lox platter they'll serve u two measly ounces lox without bagel 11 95 bagel 3 50 if your smart you'll order counter eat home 4 ounces 10 95 bagel 1 20  RIPPPPPPOPP off if u eat in!!!
