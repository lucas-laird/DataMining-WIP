Yum yum yum  <EOR> My husband eaten three times first brought back food service great   second time ate another couple all very patient customers until service took forever noticed many items coming we did all eat    asked something hasn't come table prepared servers snob rest time pretty much throw food your table  thought isolated incident maybe just rough day them lunch time kind busy     It third FINAL time eating yesterday should no more 45 minute dinner turned into well over hour half   only 4 tables being served table 6 adults   Seemed average dinner time tell why husband ask able order more all eat he stand again inquire orders weren't coming    water refilled mine left third full no smiles no words ask everything going no apologies HORRIBLE service again food just being dumped table     If dine just hope you're only table they're much better mood usual  <EOR> I usually stop every two three months AYCE usually count everything being solid  visit missed service  family sat table instead bar where usually sit when buddies  came 8 Friday night able sit immediately  restaurant full capacity sat   My wife daughter loved teriyaki chicken combo boxes  combo actually comes half Stacie roll instead typical California roll  usual nigiri lineup couple hand rolls Japanese lasagna roll  No problems issues sushi good usually is   Some things Sin City cucumber salad crab meat fish topping salad oyster shooters soft shell crab mussels   The service pretty bad  two hours spending most time waiting eating  daughter actually fell asleep table because she tired waiting  three servers working floor  Two older women younger woman  wouldn't surprised if younger server suffered back injury night because she carrying other two women piggy back style all night  She working hard felt bad but when she cover other two customers really suffer  older servers spending most time caring patrons sushi bar busing tables other MIA twenty minutes time leaving younger server hanging dry   I'll continue regular visits but hopefully all servers work boots on  <EOR> Horrible service The old lady rings thief  When brought attention she refuses listen starts yelling another language  Horrible customer service  returning  <EOR> Excellent Sushi  pretty regularly AYCE great price decent size menu  Vampire roll must! OH! green muscles!! <EOR> Not bad didn't knock socks off   When only saw  6 people sitting sushi bar { 3 sushi chefs behind counter}  ordered first couple rolls {it's all eat} place slamming busy  big counted 35 people there  Looked lot 'regulars' b c appeared some sushi chefs relationships w patrons   3 difft kinds beer 3 difft kinds sake large selection nothing excited   Sushi wasn't bad can't order sashimi eat your rice which something stress signs all over place  hate being told need eat don't eat if don't going force feed myself finish rice  PS don't eat much rice when typically white rice did see option change your white rice brown rice which typically do   rolls good size though big just right pop piece your mouth hard time chewing it   I didn't any particular roll overwhelmed amazement there's some really good ones Love Sushi anyhow good enough  don't know if going run back anytime soon but if close sushi craving suffice  <EOR> Let start off saying don't eat sushi  kind odd place review  being said came 4 friends enjoyed dinner  ordered Teriyaki Chicken delicious  best but far worst  however many choices those don't eat sushi but complain when name restaurant sin city SUSHI?  As far sushi goes Two friends really seemed enjoy sushi but other two said although okay probably wouldn't return    The prices seemed fair service good  manager even checked couple rolls friends ordered when seemed taking slightly longer others   Overall good but best  <EOR> I rarely review places eat unless amazing terrible  Sadly TERRIBLE spot  service hands down worst Las Vegas  Food mediocre environment laughable    Our waiter couldn't speak English didn't understand English simply made experience unbearable  90% time waitress actually phone ignored request service  She very short when asked questions menu items looked annoyed when did order anything seemed she would toss food front when she served it  tend give people credit especially since worked service industry but couldn't ignore such God awful service    The food edible   all could really say it  paid AYCE all honesty 50% food looked disgusting   Now definitely put place bottom garbage heap actual environment  booths look recycled restaurant vacated location previously  There's random office cubicle near kitchen bathroom  there's shipping boxes stacked all around restaurant    If you're those people just read conclusion READ AVOID RESTAURANT EVERY COST  You'll disappointed food angered service questioning why sushi place hasn't folded yet  <EOR> I Raved Sin City Sushi past told everyone need try it       Well 2 visits last 2 weeks unfortunately                             You recommend place some more Come didn't really think going say bad did you? place nothing but consistent every time there  only change found lately getting pretty busy  But would rather busy wait few eat place stay business  '  The wait staff always very very good giving good service totally understand waiting little while service when place every table full people enjoying most delicious sushi around  guys always coming making sure everything good asking if anything change place better  Even when server walks your table when mid conversation all he hears mom coming town am buying gun he still asked wanted more water haha luckily enough enough just ask hell talking about    This place come through every time continue eat until run fish move away because see  service quality falling   <EOR> Food paid $3 more uni sushi osyter shooter   Keep mind each only order ONCE uni osyter   uni sushi only PIECE uni barely cover rice   Osyster shooters small cup size your finger   rolls cooked food okay   All sushi made THIN slice raw fish BIG piece rice   Couldnt even taste fish all when rice big fish cut thin!!! know all u can eat but quality very unacceptable   I'd rather pay little bit more some REAL sushi!!!

While sushi par other places tried service became nail coffin decision ever return    The AYCE fairly priced but when only order once entire 45 minutes checked nor could flag down hostess server cashier 2 woman pretty decent sized restaurant bit irritated    Sure if you're area don't mind sitting bar where sure chefs take great care you <EOR> Probably favorite sushi place town   Excellent super attentive service big selection decent price AYCE  place go to fish rolls <EOR> Quality food point good selection different things order  did AYCE sushi  think worth it  Was little weary first because when walked couple walking said good luck getting service   good first sign  still took chances glad did   This place seems family owned operated most part  Drink orders taken brought right away  food little slow come kind see where other couple coming from  oyster shooters which really good  surprising see menu  tend just order lot nigiri  fish good quality cold supposed be  Good portion rice wasn't getting full just that  Waitresses nice but would kinda wave them down if needed something  Overall even though service might little off would still come food  <EOR> Let's start off with   wow   great selection AYCE sushi!!! group did AYCE which included appetizers hand rolls cut rolls nigiri  order menu made order which means FRESH!!! ordered baked mussels fried soft shell crab seafood salad cucumber salad fried tofu edamame cut rolls nigiri  AYCE dinner approximately $25 per person includes dessert  server checked constantly see if wanted anything else    This restaurant only 10 15 min Strip  Well worth drive! <EOR> This place needs learn some customer service hire enough waitresses put demand  stood 10 minutes without being much acknowledged same couple next before arrived  two seats bar couple could've sat down   As party 5 expected wait but without being acknowledged point?  The two waitresses walked around helping customers obviously busy which under stand but really hard say hi right ?   I take business elsewhere  <EOR> Lunchtime work peeps want sushi  last sushi outing unsuccessful time consulted bookmarks  wanting try Sin City Sushi long but never around insisted there    We arrived seated promptly  recognized few staff now defunct Kai Sushi few years ago  decided order few rolls share then able little bit nigiri try well  don't normally order many rolls when AYCE sushi places but trying accommodating  food came pretty quickly everything pretty good  Some rolls ordered little over sauced but everything solid flavors really great  favorites probably salmon skin handroll mussels nigiri    Service friendly very quick  Definitely plus when limited time lunch  look forward coming back really soon trying more nigiri hot dishes AYCE menu  <EOR>
