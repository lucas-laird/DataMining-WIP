Ordered chicken pad Thai yellow chicken curry  Came faster expected greeted happy welcomes tended EACH EVERY question smile! All all loved it! Really found new awesome Thai place <EOR> My family came Father's Day seated right away automatic plus   only other table busy all which why don't understand why waitress rushing order  being told needed more time she came back only two minutes later ask if ready  Needless say bit annoying  decided Crispy Pork Spicy Basil sauce Tom Kha seafood Chicken Pad Thai Red Curry beef  food came quickly enough dug right away    The Crispy Pork Basil sauce very tasty but very little pork it  mostly asparagus basil leaves bell pepper  porj wasn't very tender either    Tom Kha seafood delicious but worth $15  only piece shrimp 1 mussel couple pieces squid little bits chopped fish  would order again but maybe chicken  Very rich flavor hint curry coconut milk   Chicken Pad Thai bit sweet liking  Again very stingy meat  didn't feel enough peanut taste   The Red Curry beef very savory  could eat just sauce rice did end having only few pieces beef floating soup countless bamboo pieces    We decided order sticky rice mango  waitress excited tell mangos very ripe  Unfortunately very disappointed when order came  sticky rice delicious but mangos nowhere near ripe  looked ripe but extremely sour when flipped over dark spots all over middle it    Overall food ok first glance think there's lot food  However they're very stingy meat  understand business but people come back if feel they're getting money's worth either  <EOR> First time coming gotta say if could give restaurant 10 stars would!
