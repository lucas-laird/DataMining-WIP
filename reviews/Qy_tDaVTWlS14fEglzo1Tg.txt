My mom decided order she wanted Ultimate Grilled Cheese mixed green salad wanted 1 2 440 Sandwich soup  While ordering mine cashier asked side she wanted she said sweet potato fries  cashier handed mom number sat table chatting waiting  waiting  waiting    Friends couples colleagues came ate while sat table mom commenting probably good place work lunch  While sat runners came told 440 does come ciabatta bread I'd wanted opted wheat couldn't told while ordering 10 15 minutes later? food finally came instead sweet potato fries limp French fries plate no soup  called runner explain he promptly brought extra serving sweet potato fries without taking plate back kudos having wait even longer  When inquired soup however another employee kept asking number no longer remembered  She finally able pull check said ordered 1 2 sandwich side didn't even know option menu especially since mom only asked sweet potato fries because she'd prompted  Seinfeld's No soup you! except less yelling I'd willing back again because think food other experiences fresh simple without feeling overtly expensive but Mama K probably won't coming along because she wasn't impressed  <EOR> Excellent place breakfast lunch dinner  Healthy choices  Smoothies good  Try Hawaiian Bliss  Coffee meh  <EOR> Everything delicious! use great quality products! Great sandwiches salads shakes!! <EOR> I really poor over priced veggie burger here  place full busy 3 00 afternoon apparently popular  give another chance but even salad sampled dining partner since mine bad just OK  <EOR> The employees miserable consistently provide crappy service but loyal customer because food good  However most recent experience food joke  ordered acai bowl horrendous  loaded granola couple stingy spoonfuls Acai bottom  might well call granola bowl acai garnish  <EOR> The tuna sandwich BEST!  Great fresh healthy food   place always busy always great every time go  <EOR> Agree reviews service  order took over 20 minutes wasn't even busy all  Many people came all orders before us  Then add insult injury put mayo sandwich which asked left off wait redone  french fries also cold when arrived  manager came apologized comped sandwich but still unpleasant experience  Food just so  Then while eating sandwich outside two really nasty looking pigeons going town food left tables  disgusting plates bowls inside suggest clear tables  few minutes someone came finally clear tables shooed away pigeons which then flew right over another diners table while eating  Thank goodness wasn't ours! fellow dining patron both mentioned hope good dishwashers!! Anyway must leave place pigeons going another table can't take anymore  Please if going outside dining clear plates often! <EOR> Ok frequent location N Durango something compare location to   counter staff friendly delivery table done smile burger over cooked but otherwise consistent Rachael's Kitchen quality   serving sweet potato fries seemed small but again very tasty    The lack coffee beverage area slight bummer great when added iced tea but maybe people NW area drink more coffee lol <EOR> Very good food very friendly staff   Really enjoy sandwiches lunch time   outdoor patio which nice when weather good  <EOR> The chicken caesar wrap sweet potatoes fries delicious  <EOR> Had lunch mom chicken salad delicious! helped very friendly Analisa way accommodate us!!
