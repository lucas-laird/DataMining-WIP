Been wanting check place since pretty sure first revolving sushi restaurant Las Vegas as miss places back Hawaii     Place very modern trendy vibe music playing I pads order if want something other coming conveyor belt   seated immediately around 7 day Christmas but 2 think larger groups could longer wait  If looking AYCE sushi place it    but if looking quick sushi fix fish fresh quickly served    My husband really enjoyed garlic tuna nigiri  tried roll shrimp tempura dont remember which one but stayed away other rolls because thought tempura tasted stale  Even though supposed sushi restaurant really enjoyed garlic ramen broth best while! <EOR> Great experience  bit slow service seating checking out  Special orders take lot longer taking belt but fresher course  wait 45 minutes seated  Overall great experience fresh food aside being slow checking out  <EOR> I don't any complain restaurant tastes but everything very small  If AYE sushi person may want avoid place  Your bill could double want normally spend  Two spent over $40 without alcohol but still hungry left  suggestion restaurant price should lower size should bigger   place more rich Asian people people small appetite  <EOR> This might new favorite sushi spot! When moved Hawaii 16 years ago wondered why no rotary or revolving sushi places now    there's one!! pretty excited try out  Monday afternoon considering reviews read surprised see wasn't crowded but maybe because Monday   Anyhow review  place big small   greeted seated soon entered   host explained everything worked basically all revolving plates $2 50 if wanted something else menu then ordered via iPad your table  Then little robotic thing comes stops your table beeps tells remove your order then you're done   The variety $2 50 plates wasn't bad all  salmon toro good really liked didn't put much rice sushi   also special ordered 4 pieces uni $2 50 per piece seared scallops mango salsa $7 95   Okay really only thing didn't care for  know uni comes different grades but lowest grade  But guess pay for   then scallops    they looked beautiful plate but when bit into still very cold middle  only thing worse would've if scallops over cooked   just decided wouldn't order those things again   Overall food good service good price fair  bill came $64 including drinks    love don't wait your food AYCE! <EOR> Nigiri sushi some smallest sushi pieces ever seen  Two pieces together big normal standard sushi piece  really paying $5 00 plate for2 pieces sushi since half size  But having said pretty fresh being middle desert  Service good  drinks good  instead two stars giving 3 stars  solid C instead D  <EOR> We area past Wednesday flying back home Seattle evening  location very convenient just off I 15 far Strip few exits away Airport  wanted something didn't sitting around waiting food perfect option us  around 1pm when inside restaurant seated right away  much busier towards end meal tables booths filling quick  food very good  quality definitely better any other conveyor sushi places had  ensure freshness removing plates belt every 30 minutes so    array nigiri sushi rolls other selections poke tacos popcorn lobster     All plates belt 2 50 which wasn't bad especially quality sushi had  definitely coming back during next visit! <EOR> What fun experience! first conveyor belt sushi experience Portland last summer fell love  Such great way try new things without committing whole roll  Nice ambiance smart layout  touch screens each booth order menu  robot brings right your table track  fun!

Less variety sushi if your into spicy sushi place however staff friendly revolving sushi dangerous if your diet     just coming coming coming <EOR> Great quality fish large selection prices which lower comparable competition fun environment place winner  small plates conveyor belt all fixed price charged many take  great because instead ordering entire roll discovering don't take small plate 3 4 pieces waste much money if don't care it  also order full size additional items tablet your table    Kids love place recommend if sushi lover  <EOR> A lot acquaintances visiting restaurant give try myself only revolving sushi restaurants Vegas  came lunch time Monday wasn't entirely busy admired attentive servers were  explained process ordering conveyor belt style iPad available each table order from  ordered shrimp tornado which extremely flavorful well garlic edamame  realized ordering iPad would give full size order rolls while grabbing items off conveyor belt smaller portions $2 50 which pretty nice  took popcorn lobster off conveyor belt because wanted try but review 4 stars because that  loved flavors trying present but lobster itself wasn't doing me  seemed almost all batter comparison lobster meat  Nonetheless enjoy place look forward coming back because quality seems fresh want speciality kitchen menu items  Overall full shrimp tornado roll garlic edamame mini popcorn lobster roll off conveyor belt price came $15 which isn't expensive all!

Soft Shell Crab Hand Roll Lightly battered crispy soft shell crab hand roll  pretty yummy overall over those soft shell crab  Never seen before  May prefer just straight normal soft shell crab appetizer vs handroll though  But thats fault  Just personal preference  Red snapper Nigiri Surf Clam Very typical nigiri  Yellowtail Salmon Taco special order train  reminded tostadas Soho used love getting happy hour  Small bite sized tacos fresh fish quite yummy  Good little bite sized snack appetizer !      if everything else wasnt bite sized anyway XD   Uni Nigiri creamy sea butter comparable specially ordered tray uni night before Santa Barbara    Toro Nigiri first found disappointing  expected toro like  grabbed conveyor belt  Quite lean called toro    Green tea roll cake Specialty dessert created on site japanese patissier    Toro Round 2 before into talking round here's some back story  talking freddy 5th time during meal he mentioned system should different selections grade type toro ordering  sense since there's theres typically chu toro o toro just different grades general  If grade first found would borderline normal tuna vs any part belly  round two sent completely different  Melt mouth fatty goodness  Even marbling fat color look completely different  toro should LEAST  fan otoro much fat point where its almost more fat flesh some thick banding fat  piece more similar chutoro  Which great !

<EOR> I really looking forward having rotating sushi restaurant Las Vegas used going many them Los Angeles    which gives pretty high standards    And know just opened but experience terrible going back    They did give discount because many problems over all night lack food conveyor belts slow service  But still doesn't want back    Pros The staff nice large space clean nice aesthetics    Cons 1  conveyor belts nothing 85% time there  When stuff conveyor belt only sashimi no rolls all any variety  Tried attach video took but doesn't give opinion post see if post some point around 8pm Saturday lot people  Also some times did items conveyor belt didn't match title card front them  Towards time leaving hour when started more items conveyor belt but again all sashimi nothing else 2  lot food no taste  3  pictures screens don't really match size get  example avocado roll size finger tiny looked much smaller picture see attached 4  iPads use orders don't swivel your direction very annoying stays perpendicular all times  screen sensitive if tap something mistake puts item your order list then when your screen double check your order before ordering things pop didn't even know pressed  delete them before press order  But very annoying    5  no descriptions any food  If you're ordering roll example don't know what's roll unless basic California roll something  If order specialty roll more pricey food no idea what's it    6  rotating belt delivery boat when order something off screen didn't work row but worked other two  All food delivered servers  servers kept asking over over which items received order which really annoying    In opinion very large conveyor belt sushi restaurant which shocked weren't prepared amount people night  first Vegas     you're gonna lot people  Any place ever tons food conveyor belts all times much smaller places people waiting outside 2 hours    When conveyor belt sushi restaurant want your food then very quick  shouldn't wait because there's nothing conveyor belt then place order without knowing half food then wait server bring you  some food self explanatory looking but certain items not If case could've gone regular all eat sushi restaurant lists all food ingredients only brought server    Take look Kula Los Angeles example run restaurant this  restaurants small super crowded sometimes wait outside two hours  But always food conveyor belts second sit down  variety salads rolls sashimi desserts etc  even sashimi isn't raw fish alternatives if don't eat fish raw fish other tamago  Though aren't perfect any means but great example always being busy being top food having conveyor belts boats work  Maybe doing research other conveyor belt sushi restaurants would help fix certain problems  <EOR> This fun son very similar sushi bars Japan  originally wanted come because serve Ramen  Most fish really good ramen excellent also comes very small portion  place definitely worth going if want little bit fun while eat  if want try Japanese style sushi bar  <EOR> Omg great Sushi  Great atmosphere   Great place family  Highly recommend  many times  Toney Elly servers both rocked it  atmosphere very comfortable too  If need help willing help you  <EOR> I don't pre made sushi idea  If want ur sushi fresh u better order make some item really sit long time heater weather imagine   miss <EOR> This place awesome!

Price $2 50 any dishes belt   Definitely worth stop while town   Good times thanks Sapporo staff! <EOR> I Vegas EDC weeknd came group friends  live Orange Country revolving sushi bar called Kula but place beats Kula whole lot   Reason why best revolving sushi bar yet  price can't beat  $2 50 plate!  extremely fair quality fish offered which talk bit   But even better during Happy Hour $1 50 plate  worth it   So comparing other revolving sushi joints to  carry fish your average type fish  Most places salmon tuna yellowtail shrimp eel etc  Your average type fish   Here Sapporo kanpachi baby yellowtail sea bream halibut snapper yuzu fav sweet shrimp uni 4 types salmon ccean trout king salmon New Zealand salmon belly smoked salmon  surprised didn't cherry salmon variety salmon offered  There's much more offer but can't remember all fish off top head  uni better some places before $2 50 piece! GAME  told friends place when came back Orange County now can't wait back show them hidden gem  <EOR> Finally! Revolving sushi Las Vegas  super happy finally here   I know seemed fading fad 90s but assure where am originally never style  Where moved revolving sushi made come back around 2013  But some reason never made Vegas until now  understand why when there's AYCE sushi almost everyone where Vegas   The layout Sapporo different am accustomed to   husband figured few minutes being seated three sections restaurant  Therefore 3 conveyor belts   serve same things just three different belts  if your belt running low dishes well other full  However can't just reach over someone's table dish because  just plain rude   normal revolving sushi restaurant kitchen middle restaurant belt all way around restaurant  way belt always full   Sapporo does nice system each table where submit regular orders sushi order dessert miso soup three different ramen options udon other items belt  fact family sat across two little boys  boys favorite dishes taco shrimp taco yellow tail  taco shell made deep fried won ton wraps  Because people snatching tacos faster could family submitted three separate orders tacos using tablet  tacos electronically zipped over family right above belt  cool!  The items belt your usual items tuna yellow tail crunch shrimp tamago egg crab leg philly rolls   also something called sexy girl   Depending roll 1 4 rolls plate  example tamago 2 items crab leg only 1 mexican roll 3 items while philly lobster crunch four rolls  Each plate reasonably priced $2 50 each  say pretty good  favorites tamago lobster crunch yellow tail taco  Damn! just realized didn't any gyoza! always gyoza! My husband ordered miso soup broth really good   husband also ordered bowl tonkatsu ramen which small bowl $4 25  thought broth ramen ok but would order again  think size price really good   The thing didn't desserts belt  order tablet menu  desserts slim pickings  There's no mochi ice cream but tiramisu which Italian ice cream pineapple sorbet vanilla pistachio green tea   Tiramisu $6 95 yipes ice cream $2 95 each   And although garlic spicy edamame belt $3 50  typical revolving sushi different plate colors determine price dish  Sapporo dish color set price $2 50 each  However edamame bowl  assuming anything bowl belt $3 50?? any case during visit only thing belt bowl garlic edamame   Get early really late close 2 am  husband around 5 30 when opened last section  However when left 6 45 lot people waiting   The service good  restaurant nice clean contemporary decor    I definitely price  average number plates revolving sushi 5  price right  However if husband mines where he wants try everything then dinner lunch date actually comparable AYCE sushi  <EOR> This place amazing cool!!

Don't see place lasting long way owner treats potential guests   Enough places eat town  bad looking forward trying place  <EOR> I always thought revolving sushi conveyer belt gimmicky but Sapporo very well decorated large booths groups 4 6  Some things still need work such iPad app tends crash but fun experience   One best kept secrets entire menu actually black garlic ramen $4 25  portion smaller would typically but flavor way better any other ramen shops around town    Each sushi plate passes run  $2 50 each most common pieces featuring two pieces nigiri  Some premium fish such bluefin tuna only piece  Unfortunately did having toro during visit  really enjoyed salmon belly yellowtail mini taco    All all bill still ran around $20 per person  If really want your fill AYCE sushi still might way little more but would definitely come back couple bowls ramen few pieces sushi! <EOR> What love place you're served instantly conveyor belt  Every dish pulled off belt tasted good surprisingly fresh  Now don't expect super high quality fish  C'mon only $2 50 per dish pay for  But if want dish freshly made don't see belt option order ipad  then shortly delivered your table robot  You'll know yours because stop front blink yellow  There many other dishes ipad sure peruse all items  few dishes tickled palate yellowtail tuna tacos peppered tuna sushi steak  As space chic modern spacious serviced friendly waiters  Btw there's call button ipad if need holler one  <EOR> When heard revolving sushi bar happens Las Vegas immediately came ans loved it!

Conveyor Belt Sushi loved signage leads sushi following   plates two pieces easy try new sushi $2 50 plate fantastic   Upper Level VIP delivery Sushi More If order sushi other items kitchen delivered via motorized tray rides track above conveyor belt   stops your table flashes yellow light robotic voice instructs remove your order  Very cool your social media fans love it   The conveyor belt sushi fresh sampling   sushi rolls ordered kitchen even fresher   half size ramen bowl scallops sushi tacos scallops steak flavorsome   portions smaller sampling sizes but good quality dishes great price   Fantastic   Ambiance Contemporary lighting decor dark wood tables black leather booths pairs well conveyor belt clean high tech look   Family night date night vibe works just well   Sapporo just cracked list best places first date   If vibe good order slowly try new dishes your date   Create new memory together   If vibe star order less dishes save money dessert dish delivered when time right   way conveyor belt touch pad ensures constant food possibilities all night   Enjoy food enjoy experience!  = <EOR> I kinda loved place   busy when but still service fantastic  mean over top good!  If order kitchen sure ask them send little mouse droid reminds Star Wars   cute touch   sushi better average conveyor belt sushi place   isn't significant drop quality lot others same model   Still if want freshest order kitchen more typical sushi bar   other menu items good too   especially liked pork belly although pieces little dry other two perfect   back! <EOR> This actually fast food sushi  Well long avoid waits just seated during peak hours   I heard Sapporo Revolving Sushi through grapevine almost chance try soft opening but fell through  Fortunately mentioning restaurant friend he suggested try weekend  showed 5 45 Friday night only wait upwards 10 minutes seat which fantastic light crowd materialized meal's end   The server strangely asked whether we'd eaten revolving sushi restaurant before friend said yes although hadn't which ended skipping tutorial  kinda added wait naively blundered way through tablet based ordering system note press circle around hi res photos food item until friend's gf pointed press Place Order send list kitchen let help other newbies say don't forget press Place Order when you're sure want order   That said tablet orders took 2 3 minutes come which insanely fast any restaurant anywhere  Most them arrived top rail conveyor belt system via machine travels appropriate spot lights signal correct table plays prerecorded messages prompting grab your order then press button return bot kitchen  Occasionally server would bring your order  much interaction employees aside ordering drinks removing lids finalizing checks   Oh  right lids  potentially faster way food grabbing off lower level conveyor belt which constantly runs clockwise signs naming foods followed small number plates containing said foods  Small appetizers nigiri half rolls all appearances each plate $2 50 tallied hand counting plates meal's end   No different colored plates anything restaurant's belt system   Now when said potentially faster mean some items weren't always available such various taco appetizers premium nigiri 1 piece per order 2 pieces hand rolls don't know even belt item despite pricing   Fortunately order everything delivery via tablet use abuse needed   I think waxed poetic concept enough  should probably say lot food usually talk each individual type fish but summarize time noting every single piece seafood which tasted fresh  talking upwards over 20 bites over 10 different varieties  Nothing absolutely best quality find town but almost everything least matches if exceeds expectations entry level sushi   Highlights included toro $2 50 1 pc orange salmon $7 95 more affordable yet surprisingly comparable version sake orenji mackerel $2 50 2 pc Branzino Carrot Puree $4 95 huge but moist tender w crispy skin caution puree may sweet some    Assuming maintain consistent quality Sapporo Revolving Sushi offers very solid balance between value price  just found myself wanting more value department seeing final check  wasn't starving but quite hungry sizing nigiri reminded all you can eat sushi experiences all over town which would cost less potentially gluttonous feast relatively marginal decreases quality  probably save future trips when craving particular foods and or only moderately hungry  <EOR> The food fresh delicious  Service very good people professional  Also place looked very nice clean  Robot serving food over conveyor belt big fun eat there  <EOR> Conveyor belt sushi finally hit Las Vegas! itching experience revolving sushi thankful finally arrived Valley!  The concept pretty simple  conveyor belt full different kinds sushi labels right before plates where pick food desire  seen most plates come 1 4 pieces  also note desserts available pick conveyor belts  learned conveyor belt actually sensors alert staff if sushi more 30 minutes replaced fresh sushi which settles original apprehension safety food revolving around restaurant hours  end your meal servers count many plates your table add your bill since automatically counted  Since come little later evening around midnight Thursday wasn't much going around conveyor belt  Because food through ordering system tablet   Each table gets tablet menu choose from  items include nigiri sushi specialty rolls tempura ramen appetizers dessert  menu extensive but surely enough  Prices pretty reasonable  $2 50 two pieces nigiri 1 piece some choices such toro ama ebi bluefin tuna little under $10 speciality rolls etc   After selecting items want order place your order wait chefs your dishes  took 10 minutes chefs complete each orders  receive your order kitchen via electronic track top conveyor belt  machine travels your table lights plays prerecorded message signaling pick your food returns back kitchen   Sushi quality pretty good tasted fresh  comparable most AYCE sushi spots across town  also able try salmon tacos enjoyed them  crunchy wonton shells great contrast compared fish   Service very limited  did interact any staff aside getting seated introducing ordering system occasional drink refill plate clean receiving bill when prompted ordering system  However interactions all positive   Overall price competitive AYCE sushi prices around town higher quality without inherent pressure stuff face food money's worth  would warn cautious if big eater though  Prices add fast if don't pay attention! anyone hasn't experienced conveyor belt sushi would recommend trying place out! Being only its kind Las Vegas place catch lot attention soon! <EOR> Great experience great food great prices pretty crowded but worth wait   black garlic Ramen amazing!  kids big kick watching sushi arrive little robots deliver your custom orders   back several times consistently great  <EOR> A wonderful place eat sushi  all kinds sushi fresh along conveyor belt special orders delivered along special highway above conveyor belt  order special items iPad set end table  Plates belt $2 50 plates ordered iPad vary price  service excellent sushi top notch  <EOR> Delicious fun!  Great customer service garlic ramen fabulous  Tons sushi options conveyer belt  Even dessert options came around  Don't pass place up  <EOR> I gave them 4 because first ever revolving sushi Las Vegas because FATTY TUNA!!! mean if you've Japan Fatty tuna best sushi there  tried other places fatty tuna Las Vegas course good but just damn expensive  $2 50 1 piece isn't really bad    I would've given 5 Star but last time all Fatty Tuna which totally sucked worth money spent without fatty tuna  Oh also train wasn't working where order through iPad brings sushi through train  Yes wasn't working    Overall place best when fatty tuna stock  hate call every time asking fatty tuna tho  sure it'll better through time being  mean did just open few months ago  <EOR> Came first night invite only soft opening manager surprisingly invited guests gastronomic experience  Freddy manager very first revolving sushi restaurant Vegas gave warm welcome upon arrival  Walking inside entrance seated booth right next open kitchen areas where executive chef sushi chefs did magic    The conveyer belts sushi split middle each booth  really appetizing see each belt filled actual sushi no empty plates huge gaps between  cleanliness level far good! Plus concept sushi go round restaurant always entertaining while grubbing your favorite roll sushi nigiri  also able place special orders nigiri special rolls appetizers side dishes gourmet orders desserts via tablet which each dish speeds towards your table atop conveyor belt Roomba but instead cleaning serves food!    Several servers would always stop take trays larger gourmet plates wouldn't stack table space  main server Jeremy very attentive provided outstanding hospitality  He definitely made sure nothing amiss glasses would always filled  Since first day management still working kinks even when conveyor belt system internet slowdown Jeremy able sure orders readily jotting them down specifically notepad until system came back online    To start cocktails ordered are sapporo sour matcha light alcohol without much bitterness tokyo summer definitely fave yuzu flavor hints citrusy elderflower it peach saketini pretty strong alcohol department would only if ready paint town red lychee margarita also somewhat strong but creeps later on    They $2 50 TORO!! Super duper fresh  Didn't even need much soy sauce soak most nigiris rolls plenty tasteful  also believe salmon belly nigiri  juicy satisfying every bite strangely filling  didn't over order all The sushi appetizer orange salmon extremely similar local restaurant's sake orenji but without yuzu tobiko thinly mini jalapeno slices which huge plus book  also affordable any possibility would come every week just dish favorite rest! Fresh juicy but overdose yuzu! just right especially portions share among 4 people    Gourmet dishes ordered but limited to ribeye medium rare juicy decent portion pork belly warm cute cube form also juicy black cod light buttery soft shrimp loved deshelled center easier customers eat means chefs put careful consideration prepare meals us   feel each surprisingly nicely presented dish array flavor however would see slight improvement black cod because mushy    Because solid desserts weren't available time opted try each ice cream flavors vanilla pineapple pistachio green tea  vanilla surprisingly lusterless plain all very creamy texture when mix pineapple its eating dole whip! pineapple honestly reminded yuzu sorbet  citrusy would love order between sushi dishes clean palate  Pistachio definitely nutty but did overpower tastebuds all  Green tea didn't bitter aftertaste all easy eat every scoop    Ultimately would definitely come back again salmon belly nigiri orange salmon rest dessert selections when becomes available! <EOR> As close come sushi go round Portland OR!

Very surprised  If you've fresh before would never want paste    Overall place very fun unique dining experience  Unfortunately food didn't back its modern style  Don't think repeat next time sushi craving comes back around   3 5 stars but round experience  <EOR> Too many good reviews Yelp tried but just so     Their sushi pieces small! cut whole roll into 10 12 pieces supposed sliced into 8 only  If piece regular sushi 1 inch thick 1 2 3 4 inch thick sushi's popcorn lobster this  hard time using chopstick because falling apart being skinny! Same thing diameter sushi small!  2 star customer service flavor taste food good but would rather spend $$ somewhere else    2nd pic tamago rice? Hiding because tiny seaweed wraps around skinny even tamago itself hold eat because would fall apart  That kid hand     You should try see yourself  Maybe read review would improvements  probably just came wrong day person assigned kitchen trained well slicing cutting sushi   <EOR> Very fun unique experience! Sushi fresh interesting roll menu limited but everything seemed fresh delicious  Still stuffed hours later reasonable! <EOR> My girlfriends decided give place try Valentine's Day which understand holiday! initially frustrated because under quoted wait time ended waiting little over hour when kept getting told 25 30 mins  Thankfully able some drinks bar  bartender super friendly gave great service! lychee saketinis girlfriend just ok nothing special  seated offered complimentary appetizers miscommunication wait times which very kind them! love concept restaurant but vegetarian very limited options! ordered jalepeno cream cheese popper asked before ordering if meat told no but crab it  All able try basic avocado rolls seaweed salad edamame vegetable tempura  would love see more vegetarian options! If more veg options offered consider coming back! Just worth price opinion! <EOR> This place QUALITY fish especially revolving sushi restaurant  feel usually stigma around revolving sushi fresh sitting around while but nooo! place great    I especially liked yellowtail mackerel albacore  tonkotsu ramen special menu broth fabulous!   Really great service clean space  <EOR> Real clean modern place  sushi good but honestly find better tasting sushi elsewhere but experience conveyer belt  <EOR> I family town Hawaii stoked dine since usual spot back home Genki Sushi same exact concept  host Christian not 100% name attentive most helpful staff during experience here  plan given three stars because him  server Caucasian lady really nice but wasn't around much? She came around once? Other busser host always answer questions tend water refills  During FIRST order Ipad ordered bunch nigiris ramen son two udon bowls nieces  probably three rounds orders through Ipad realized udon never came all  cousin noticed table sat maybe 10 15 minutes udon orders  definitely killed vibe since nieces long day cheer competition  first brought attention busser then host then server   Once cousin wanted take but again no around bring to go containers  Everyone party done eating while just started theirs  Poor girls  Don't wrong all nice but if came around more sure orders brought tables scarfed down into hungry bellies would've better experience  menu itself okay   I think generous we're used to  Hence I'd rather some sushi AYCE spot here  left hungry dissatisfied but tried best experience  guess HIGH expectations place   maybe  why outcome seems more disappointing  Would come back? don't know  <EOR> Nice clean  Friendly staff  Great kids  Bathrooms changing tables infants! <EOR> Sapporo sushi very good great customers great food fast serve time  very unique way serving food  train system we're pickup sushi but probably just use fast ordering system computer your order gets delivered robot train thing  Overall place very clean waiters patient tend check often  little costly but worth good food quality  <EOR> Came friends fantastic  Very fresh lots variety very reasonable prices  restaurant new clean trendy would come back heart beat  loved popcorn lobster roll  <EOR> I'm giving generous 2 stars fun food revolving coming automated carts    otherwise best item fried Brussels sprouts   The sushi meh   $2 50 per plate all kinds other items order off digital menu   Service weak   guys kitchen looked mean unhappy     Not stick delicious AYCE Sakana ! <EOR> Best coolest sushi joint to  Great food happy employees cool concept managed excellence  place gonna fat ter  <EOR> Nice Decor Nice everything really  But food smaller average sized sushi  Quality good except UNI which lower grade  I wouldn't say its unfresh just good stuff   I enjoyed time only problem portions  Compared sushi trains California  I eat twice many plates Sapporro   My only real complaint food portions  Each sushi half width  <EOR> The first only conveyor belt sushi Vegas  Despite roots reasoning behind conveyor belt sushi restaurants to sell cheaper cuts fish masses still neat concept me  plop yourself your seat wait food come you  If must eat might well all lazy!  I've only under 10 conveyor belt sushi restaurants other countries review would based those experiences   So hooray Vegas having conveyor belt revolving sushi  biggest gripe food selection very limited  Tuna salmon crab tamago spicy tuna sprinkling fatty tuna surf clam caterpillar roll few others + dessert  sure policy when comes taking off plate  around few times  iPad each table if want specific item order little tray comes zipping above your head alert though pay attention because might grabbing other people's food across you  If light your side yours  However iPads need reset lot   The quality fish just okay even during first week being open  Each plate $2 50 depending you'll 1 4 pieces per plate same price  pay based number plates  <EOR> I really concept place  Ordering tablet convenient picking sushi conveyor belt  enjoyed atmosphere decor nice restaurant spacious clean   When comes down quality sushi would say ingredients fresh but options fell short expectations  rolls pretty basic  would enjoyed restaurant little more if more extravagant creative rolls  Most rolls tasted same  Lacked flavor sauces  Hopefully future add more items menu  More variety  <EOR> This place amazing  service spot on  ingredients fresh affordable unless you're ordering off belt menu  There's ton seating even when busy doesn't feel you're waiting long move pretty quickly tables bussed  Came lunch definitely come again  <EOR> Have never done before  sopporo lunch while waiting seated   Encountered some less professional behavior some very rude actions beleive name cliff  being seated shot short note yelp owner   gentelman standing beside table within 5 minutes asking he could help  He passing car dm yelp stoped help  eat 3 times month food great fresh easly ever ask for But very effective appprach he took whole family's buisness  Im sorry did catch your name sir but more people country need take notice  Thank takeing such good care us  Must try mango creamed soda <EOR> Good lordt  Yes  Fresh  Everything ready  BLACK GARLIC RAMEN WASSSUP  place gots heart  <EOR> Las Vegas' FIRST conveyor belt sushi restaurant!   Came tonight some friends husband  soft pre opening something? Apparently opened last two nights well but invite only  super jealous some people invited!   I saw Facebook opened limited time Dec  2nd dinner 5 00 pm 10 00 pm  When saw immediately showed friends husband planned early dinner 5 00 pm  parking situation little weird because lot parking spots but lot them names other establishments word reserved them  Except there's sign front Sapporo saying park anywhere  really sure really goes   We bit early seated right away  told already food won't come until 5 00 pm fine that  iPad system all tables where order things if don't want grab conveyor belt  iPad also keeps tally all things ordered which great    As probably tell now conveyor belt different types nigiri  even signs before them know you're grabbing  did notice sushi starts middle room before making other side which kind sucks because if something wanted     but everyone else also wanted wouldn't able it  could order    but also noticed fish isn't consistent  Some pieces would fattier other pieces would more lean  wasn't enough salmon conveyor belt order two more orders but came quite lean  fatty salmon belly pieces! Booo!   Also ordering system custom cart stops right front your table your order when ready  also tells Your order here  Please take your order  Super cool  reminds some sushi places Japan does that    Onto sushi! focused mainly nigiris  rolls too  Each plate conveyor belt $2 50  hand rolls but order them  weren't belt  also $2 50  udon ramen order  nigiri mostly two pieces plate unless premium items toro king crab uni  Those piece per plate $2 50  Honestly toro price STEAL  Most establishments charge $8 10 piece toro  sushi quite fresh  think only thing didn't care rice  good but missing something  also packed lot where doesn't feel soft  felt bit more hard squished    Don't worry fish staying long  conveyor belt senors whenever plate gets put there  timer if plate belt 30 minutes hasn't eaten trashed!  You keep plates your table end your meal tally give your total  Service great  willing split check anyway want!   TIP If you're huge eater may place you  things add fast  would suggest AYCE if eat ton  Haha    This place brings back memories when used boat sushi back San Francisco mom grandma    Overall decent quality  Good service  would come back would suggest people give try  <EOR> Finally revolving sushi restaurant Vegas! several them other states excited finally here  late Friday evening  wait wasn't long less 20 minutes    Each plate conveyor belt $2 50 order other items tablet your table  took several items off belt also ordered tablet    Conveyor belt items Snow crab nigiri crab sweet tasted fresh Popcorn lobster roll covered mayo sauce heavily breaded Lobster roll doused sweet sauce couldn't taste anything else Seaweed salad refreshing good quality flavor California roll generous amount crab Gyoza greasy soggy flavor good Shrimp taco shrimp tart mayo sauce? wasn't into it Tuna taco poke tortilla chip shell delicious would eat whole tray them  Tablet items Udon soup broth really sweet some reason wouldn't order again Vanilla ice cream big womp womp us  put order ice cream tablet  Then waiting game began  5 10 15 minutes by  Someone finally stopped table asked if ordered vanilla ice cream  said yes but hadn't gotten yet  Another few minutes until finally bowl ice cream  Strangely person brought front house really sure where store ice cream  kiddo kind bummed didn't come automated tray runs above conveyor belt  C'est la vie    The service pretty good busy Friday evening  Staff attentive didn't feel rushed even though still line people waiting seated  experience little rough but I'd give another shot  tons items didn't try we'll back again  <EOR> The first revolving sushi place Las Vegas  Reminds Pokémon Stadium game Nintendo 64   The prices good  Each plate through revolving belt $2 50 ranges 2 3 pieces sushi per plate  fish very fresh   There also train brings other items order iPad  items iPad range different prices depending get  train belt above regular revolving belt  Try shrimp tacos popcorn lobster roll! both good! Sapporo green tea pistachio ice cream $1 50 scoop each   The ambience nice clean  staff very helpful informative  <EOR> I came unique experience  far know only place Las Vegas revolving sushi  concept familiar areas San Francisco excited see some parts concept being brought Vegas  pretty much nailed part Sapporo  However feel though quality taste needs some work   Because la carte would expect everything best would if you're paying 2 50 two pieces fish  However kind disappointed really isn't anything special fish if you're looking fish more quality price then suggest AYCE would better choice  don't mind being expensive but if might well worth every penny right? Unfortunately selection did offer case   My favorite sushi dishes place Salmon Belly Uni  Both memorably fresh mouth watering   My favorite sushi but black garlic ramen exceptionally good taste haven't tried other place  Definitely give go   There also dish could order forgot name but clams it  Please save yourself some money don't that  bunch flavored water surrounding completely unnecessary taste just salty rather savory    Overall give place visit satisfy your curiosity  But maybe just Black Garlic Ramen? <EOR> What fun place friends family! food great!

Sushi conveyor belt?  exciting must try!  However first time seeing concept expectations going in   I want preface first saying two amazing revolving sushi spots prior Sapporo visit 1 rural Fukuoka Japan where most eat sushi fingers chopsticks 2 Kula revolving sushi chain SoCal Texas   Both great thought nothing could better carrying bias little reluctant Sapporo   The food fresh nicely proportioned $2 50 per plate   If wasn't very hungry would great place quick bite   However suggest coming lunch did   Prior lunch foolishly came starving dinner Friday night waited 30 minutes before leaving eat somewhere else Sapporo gets packed!  Knocked off least star Sapporo's appeal through its tech   If doesn't work properly don't food   Aside belt there's iPad which order additional items more instance would take order see attached photo    When does work your order comes top shelf delivered your table    but sometimes wrong table did group next just watched food back forth passing them another table   At end day just another sushi spot   just conveyor belt   Game changer would if AYCE  <EOR> Loved it!  Good pricing sushi wonderful! The conveyor through kitchen where chefs preparing rolls new items constantly popping you!   Pick spot next kitchen where conveyor coming if eatting solely off conveyor first choice! <EOR> I've twice since opened  first visit already 5 stars  But waited till second visit review Freddy very friendly feel welcome  Learned lot just talking both visits why Vegas hadn't revolving sushi yet some info conveyor belts all works  He gave nice little tour around restaurant first night explain everything works  Very passionate industry all restaurants    Food delish even single dessert available  Can't wait them add more flavors strawberry  different looking toro first second visit chefs explained they're actually 2 different kinds toro probably request next time Overall love vibe atmosphere  Everyone super friendly nice pretty attentive your needs  back many times over look forward infinite amount new ideas implemented  <EOR> I'll start good service very good friendly professional  toro piece solid  Some other pieces enjoyable if particularly remarkable including tobiko sweet shrimp   The so so sea urchin particularly good  passed some salmon items because some salmon did look good quality  clearly farm raised fish   This better revolving sushi place Atlanta but would still say still place better enjoyed group more interested fun experience particularly high quality sushi  <EOR> My husband love place!!
