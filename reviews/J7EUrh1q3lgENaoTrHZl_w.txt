I am big fan Bradley Ogden going back Lark Creek Inn Larkspur CA   loved restaurant Caesar's until started tinkering menu its latter years  high hopes latest entry especially since its neighborhood I'd love see Tivoli Village some traction   Having said confess being mildly disappointed when wife stopped early dinner few weeks ago  Don't wrong   it wasn't bad just far great    We 5 30 Happy Hour play ordered both HH menu ala carte menu   starters fried polenta cubes nothing special   bland little seasoning recommend all grilled cheese bites  turned unremarkable grilled cheese sandwich cut into eight pieces plopped plate  skirt steak fish chips main courses  skirt steak well seasoned but little tougher expecting  no steak knife accompanying dish left tearing apart steak fork un serrated utility knife   On other hand fish chips outrageously delicious worth return trip solely merits dish   Happy Hour pricing very friendly $3 beers 4 $5 apps   ala carte menu quite value driven especially beverage side beers ranging $6 $10 $6 PBR   really PBR!?!    Anyway said we'll back fish chips but likely show during Happy Hour  <EOR> Very slow service   Purchased lunch special included beer   refused give beer stated cleaning beer lines   Poor planning should perform maintenance during closed hours during lunch time   would return there  <EOR> Went today business lunch enjoyed very much  shared Bibb Lettuce Salad which lightly dressed goat cheese crepe tasty  Also split Short Rib Patty Melt perfectly melty delicious short ribs moist delicious  food 5 sure however setting where place lacks  6 tables front reception area terrible no would want sit tables inside dining area much small food sit let alone try conduct any business  first people arrive 11 30a when opened seemed bit scrambled seated  twelve fairly busy service slowed bit but still acceptable  probably return food very good if tad over priced  <EOR> Going restaurant high expectations only 10 minutes arrived did decline rapidly  Service awful took ove 10 minutes drink order only 4 other tables time  Food okay nothing would bought ogden would put name on  Again log wait times between courses  agree ken h definitely business give 6 months  sad Ogden expected more  <EOR> On date night   we split mushroom polenta appetizer which delicious!

CONS Overpriced IMO   A sweet corn soup $12  Wouldnt bad if 1  corn actually sweet 2  more shrimp  If advertise shrimp dish let shrimp  2 TINY pieces pretty lame if ask me  The garlic mashed potatoes needed salt although tasty  If dont season your potatoes just dont taste good should  The grilled cheese OK but spectacular  size price point OK but definitely  I know silly but to    they servers provide own pens  Very weird but true!  I'd definitely come back try some other stuff  fish chips look delicious  summer veggie hash tasted pretty damn good me! didn't care grilled artichoke all  Maybe because usually eat artichokes stuffed  also didn't care dill cornbread  only did look offensive didn't care taste bit  Took bite didn't even finish it   know offer HH specials think I'd rate 4 star if came that  But pricing big part dining experience dinner definitely pricey me  <EOR> When comes fine dining restaurants Las Vegas compete any city  But city lacks exception Chinatown Spring Mountain Rd  casual moderately priced dining spots excellent food  Hops Harvest fills void Bradley Bryan Ogden's farm table concept    The James Beard award winning chef son created menu full comfort food inspired creative touches goat cheese stuffed crepe bibb lettuce salad brought back  items former restaurant Caesars Palace blue corn muffins Maytag bleu cheese souffle   The short rib nachos favorite dishes its great salty savory flavors  potato chips tend little soggy sauce  covering them but combo ingredients good dish won't last long  pork belly bites another hit its sweet spicy BBQ sauce cheddar ale sauce  tried both tuna sliders crispy chicken sliders wasn't disappointed time  heirloom tomatoes may small dish but combo tomatoes bleu cheese excellent   The bone in prime rib eye slightly overcooked but seasoning zinfandel shallot sauce made it  rarely order meatloaf but bacon wrapped version good enough want order again  also tried crab cake dish which pretty good but star dish carrot fennel slaw  good should offer sides menu   The butterscotch pudding cinnamon sugar donut holes both good  Each large enough two people share   There only couple things wasn't crazy about  blue corn muffins could used more salt something polenta bites bland   Our server Jessica amazing  Each time back made point request table section   I sad see Bradley Ogden's place Caesars Palace close while back but now glad he's back serving some Strip quality food local's setting   4 5 Stars <EOR> After seeing pictures being posted yelp really wanted try place  say getting inside wasn't easy me  confused which door main entrance  employee saw trying nice enough come outside direct right way  explained reservation he mentioned rest party hadn't arrived yet he said still getting couple things ready open day he gave lunch menu look over    I say inside looks gas station farmhouse  decor would expect find BBQ type food menu  Since Hops Harvest farm to table concept maybe thought decor menu would mesh but doesn't seem fit me  some awesome happy hour specials 3 6pm daily  bar beer cocktails wine menu  tables very spacious  sat booth table long!

would order something just put it    Beer cheese did taste much beer cheese   Basil aioli really good lots basil flavor   Drinks Watermelon Cream absolutely disgusting tasted dirt  No would drink sent back  People other tables ordered didn't drink either  probably wasn't good sign when watching them dump first time re do it  guess no staff knew it    The waitress didn't quite know handle lot screw ups going also didn't seem know menu  manager did come over apologize didn't charge anything sent back  If back would happy hour draft beer discounted apps  <EOR> my sentiments mirror lot other reviews   over priced mediocre food   burger   ordered medium came medium well   meat very good bun but 13 50 expected something truly exceptional   fries very good   companion grilled chicken  cooked nicely but zero flavor   beer selection small but good   strawberry short cake nice surprise   service almost interested  <EOR> Went lunch yesterday Saturday 6 8 13 first time  entrance bit odd because walk through dining area hostess stand seem though accidentally came through back door! definitely better layout previous restaurant space more secluded booths doesn't just feel big empty space way did before   I pretty impressed food! Thanks prior yelpers knew order grilled cheese bites  Wow wow wow  grilled cheese grated lemon peel which gives delicious zest comes awesome tomato mustard dipping sauce  literally eating sauce knife once finished grilled cheese  also tried burger short rib patty melt fried chicken salad  burger really good but just burger I probably wouldn't again   patty melt amazing  Crispy fried bread cheesy plenty juicy short rib meat   yum  salad weakest  fried chicken actually really good because very lightly breaded but dressing salad supposed buttermilk dressing way much egg oil buttermilk ratio tasted more mayonnaise dressing  dessert devils food cake light fluffy delicious sorbets mango raspberry really good   Bradley Ogden walking around restaurant stopped table few times  He said he eaten short rib melt breakfast! Then he shook all hands way out  Definitely nice touch he gets restaurant going  kinks still getting worked entrees didn't come same time but all very happy! <EOR> Theresa server last time ate here   great service outfit funny though because look gas station mechanic attendants more servers     The thing don't we're sat without being given menu hostess   sat looking around until server brought menu us   Both visits grilled cheese but kept butter bread layered another butter layer top grilled cheese yum!  tomato side alright but if came tomato soup it'd heavenly     They sold grilled artichokes both visit   The meatloaf wasn't impressive sounded good being wrapped bacon but sure if undercooked simple ketchup smear over top ruined it   mashed potato seemed made fresh cause chunks even half potato inside   Mash mash mash more please   second visit entree steak potato simple good but cost over $22     I've strawberry shortcake chocolate devil's food cake   prefer chocolate dish over strawberry shortcake   cake almost hard plate   They several drinks really wanted but settled Lips Faith beer which great tasting   ordered second visit probably order again that   though personally pricing just high   Happy hour way go  <EOR> Solid place but long last always empty Tivoli Village? First all chef Bradley Ogden know you're getting spruced fresh American food quality ingredients hat tastes good  only sampled appetizers happy hour menu mac cheese grilled artichoke chicken sliders grilled cheese fried polenta bites  grilled cheese good grilled cheese served creamy tomato dipping sauce also loved macaroni  artichoke sliders solid but outstanding wasn't fan polenta  well prepared just didn't really taste cinnamon or something there   The really good thing restaurant beer list  15 selections tap nary bud light found! Choices included Full Sail MOA Lips Faith some other keepers  didn't even look bottle selections which sure also excellent   The drawback Ogden's celebrity status everything little overpriced   EXCEPT during awesome happy hour! Half off draft beer wine selection apps $3 5 everyday 3 6 aaaand enjoy happy hour anywhere restaurant! Even your kids! Bonus because Chef Ogden actually came talk meet cute baby! <EOR> I don't way often but way movie Red Rock thought would check few places place caught eye   Chef Bradley Ogden great transforming traditional american food into amazing sensation done again opinion   only does great american food appeal but bit twist everything appeal all food foodie  types     We greeted seated booth back away action   Started look over menu drinks manger came over ask if needed anything   thought great service top great service already received   ponder menu really came point wow all looks good heck order?!  decided family style 3   waitress helped selections told each dish help decision   Our apps table included Seared Tuna Sliders set great tone whole meal   Great    Maytag Blue Cheese Souffle could possibly eaten whole plate!

Located off strip restaurant more upscale brewery gastropub different Ogden's usual white linen affairs   We Saturday lunch few girlfriends ordered bunch lunch brunch plates share  Saturdays there's farmers market outside main square  chefs purchase produce create specialized dishes based available day  Farm table best   We Farmers Vegetable salad containing thinly sliced well dressed pluot hybrid apricot plum carpaccio fried goat cheese cubes market lettuces  delish  Even friend dislikes eating fruits veggies fighting last pluot! Fried chicken sliders also great fried shattering crisp but maintaining its juiciness flavor  buns house baked which fantastic many places bake own bread let alone gastropub! Lastly shrimp cocktail  put quotes because expected regular cold shrimp cocktail served over ice but wasn't     shrimp served warm grilled huge shrimp btw over bed chunky housemade cocktail sauce which also warm  cocktail sauce complimented shrimp perfectly dusted light sprinkling lemon zest round acidity  If anything menu SHRIMP COCKTAIL   For entrees short rib patty melt which served french fries  afraid melt would heavy greasy often diners but nicely balanced amount short rib cheese  also hash fried egg which really well done too  hash potatoes mixed dish really well seasoned  appreciated accompanying sauce side plate but its own separate container add much liked it  But dish most highly recommended french toast farmers market berries  don't know made french toast taste light yet satisfying same time  Diner french toast     wasn't overly sugary heavily dense  Dare say actually tasted healthy?!  The thing appreciated all food weren't oily heavy tasting way lot gastropub brewery food     but full fresh delicious flavors really stand out  If tired overpriced food Strip take your car taxi ride     won't regret it! <EOR> We early lunch Wednesday Hops Harvest   famous blue corn muffins before while good didn't find them good others do   blue cheese souffle other hand legit   Believe hype   could take 3 4 orders just meal   warm perfect when arrived table   cherry sauce well them   Fantastic blue cheese flavor   must order Hops Harvest   To eat wife burger short rib grilled cheese   short rib winner   crispy gooey throughout onions added nice flavor bit crunch   Solid short rib well little crispy around edges but expect?
