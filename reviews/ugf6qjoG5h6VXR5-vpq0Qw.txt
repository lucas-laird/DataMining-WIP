Yes living past  hadn't Firefly until couples weeks ago mostly because bad first experience tapas hearing all health violations other store remember giving myself pat back never touching place begin with    Everything delicious except tuna tartare tried Marie T 's plate which fishy tasting enough sent back  shrimp diablo which fantastic fries which possibly best fries ever had  thinking needed order 3 5 dishes really fill but surprise only ordered 2 stuffed  also ordered pitchers sangria which phenominal everyone Yelp already mentioned    My guy live NLV very few places special trips but place dragging sometime soon  <EOR> I still love food     But service getting progressively worse! Last night friends gift card wanted pay half bill it  asked waiter just split check between gift card debit card  Well he comes skipping back hey guess didn't need split gift card enough entire meal! Really?!? Idiot! explain said fix it    He comes back ten minutes later basically telling same thing    Umm no want money back! took total 35 mins dropping off check table leaving! frustrated guy! If your servers can't understand basic math divide two    Then there! Anyways love food but hostess servers lacking  Maybe should just back paradise location! <EOR> I prefer location  guess work harder earn love keep trust Summerlin clientel  Due niche location more lose cannot inconsistent food service like feel Paradise location hit miss!   bacon wrapped dates stuffed candied almonds blue cheese DIE FOR   why order two because don't share  Tip Instead getting order garlic fries order filet mignon small plate bright idea ribeye entree which comes big serving garlic fries   comes same price but portions bigger  More share  see ribeye pic   Other octopus I prefer Paradise locations way preparing dry bland fresh would liked past Paradise location   Lastly ordered mushroom stuffed chicken chirzo forgettable   When back order three bacon wrapped dates ribeye entree ONLY  <EOR> Go hungry! Everything tried amazing  Especially sangria stuffed peppers bacon wrapped dates! <EOR> From reading most restaurant reviews notice trend me   think woman thing look experience good food maybe gentlemen focus more food itself   always loved great music Firefly used some pretty cool artwork flamenco dancers restaurant   starts off great mood   I met some Yelp friends work happy hour   time two sangria pitchers table  Thanks Vanessa N  tried white since red generally traditional very refreshing   am sure type wine used but very happy it   Next ordered tuna tartar shrimp diablo   While waiting food arrive River let share fries   could mistake because think ate probably half that!

Next veggie empanada regular roast pork empanada  sucker empandas couldn't wrong husband's number one pick  Each served different kind dressed greens making choices $4 50 each especially good value   After Spanish style tortillas which means something little omelette made potato onion egg  Three fave ingredients but point noticed wasn't any salt pepper tables   Finally tried stuffed peppers filled mozzarella garlic cream cheese tomato sauce  Hitting mozzarella center provided interesting chewiness but honestly tasted more should described cream cheese thick skin around it  Enjoyable bite but me   After full all plans mushroom tarts roasted potatoes spicy aioli tomato basil soup tiny grilled brie sandwiches floating away  didn't even Firefly fries! disadvantage going twosome won't room sample much   For friendliness Firefly gets 5  atmosphere 4 5 just because traditional dining tables where I'd rather sit next time looked little close together noisy busy Wednesday night but pretty space several seating options all bar loud  menu variety 5  vegetarian elated  husband wasn't but he's truly picky one  So check online menu first if you're Driving Mr  Fussy night  Now taste  say    3    I loved green apple manchego salad  wish next right now  But rest? While tortilla worst example everything tasted little bland me  wasn't lacked spice much true Indian Thai Mexican biases but flavours didn't offer any interesting contrasts when mixed together  Maybe missing ingredient side booze   Fair enough  still want try mushroom tart toasted brie sandwich ooo roasted eggplant cannelloni! definitely back but no hardship wait until Mr  Fussy owes favour  <EOR> Always terrific tapas great service!  Note take reservations weekends   Kind pain ass when 8 people  However let take over table 8pm reservation apparently them if willing pay $55 person friend works long gone then   Turns 8pm reservation friends ours   funny!  The red sangria awesome kept flowing   Good local Summerlin place celebrate doesn't close 9pm  <EOR> The food always amazing Firefly's bar staff always very friendly drinks very generous  However now dined twice location Summerlin both times received pretty bad service  most recent visit server quite friendly but almost absent entire time  first time server very unfriendly only came table once take order once bring food last bring check  gave 0% tip  second server received little over 20% because he really really nice he did look busy  would highly recommend checking place TACO TUESDAY spot  great tacos 2 bucks pop also latin night place open until 3 a m  Blah blah blah <EOR> They serve tapas which small appetizer sized plates  They're little pricey portion wise food ok    Service usually decent but really really busy Friday Saturday nights early avoid waiting long <EOR> This place isn't bad but isn't best  must admit must artichoke toast bacon wrapped dates albondigas fixing every couple months  atmosphere cool work hang out  much bar but snobby  <EOR> On very wintery day gotta say much dig huge fireplace    Our server chill very anti typical server meaning she own hippie unique lingo  wanna start some drinkage? imagine  she outside walls Firefly    Speaking Firefly here's ordered course Mt  Everest firefly fries very garlicy sure bring your stash gum later    I ordered 4 ounce Petite filet medium well nicely seared but side little bit burned assuming red wine  Next time order medium more juiciness  But allow say $10 item worth every penny  Besides its simply beautylicous presentation came good amount roasted potatoes mushrooms  should've stopped there    But also veggie empanadas balance diet  Packed spinach  popeye making culinary art work    The fish sticks ok  crispy texture made fun eat but spicy tarter sauce made extra spesh   i noticed almost each dish complemented some kind ruffage crisp romaine arugula    Fast forward dessert  bread cherry pudding topped vanilla ice cream  close   As far service great chemistry between server busser made experience smooth  <EOR> Good Job free sangria place going downhill fast    not even free stuff public come back   Fix health department issues first'  Farewell firefly <EOR> Excuse can't any specific recommendations  just closed eyes pointed menu  Everything FANTASTIC   The sangria wasn't expensive I think $15 pitcher?   quick dousing friend both feeling pretty good   The waitress helped very cute Eastern European think  She super friendly chatty but let help other people  Service prompt food came pretty fast entire evening   The place really loud but point made comment friend food couple adjacent eating  gentleman other table willingly offered plate because he full  really +1 restaurant itself but suppose crowd   Overall ended spending $70 left full stomachs while feeling pretty wavy well  Having arrived New York 3 weeks ago doubtful could replicate experience price where but find myself saying lot here  <EOR> I'm giving revised 5 stars Firefly based upon merits second visit we haven't back but because stellar customer service provided manager recent series emails phone calls   I delighted surprised manager Dave read responded less positive review   most amazing conversation wherein shared thoughts views customer service expectations customers he trains staff deliver best experience possible   It very clear he committed only restaurant employees but providing outstanding experience every guest   He extended very warm invitation visit again which plan do   Although Vegas only schedule 'weekend flings' we'll definitely back enjoy meal confident able post much more positive happy YELP!

Brilliant! Firefly fun place gather large group friends drink eat  decent selection many spanish styled tapas ensures find least few pleasing dishes  variety spice life sure ride all dishes best paired heavy doses pickling ones own liver! <EOR> My first time location  I'll start pros food still pretty good  ordered Patatas Bravas roasted red potatoes $5 5 Steak Skewers $9   steak skewers same delicious steak mushrooms remember served flavorful red wine reduction  potatoes seemed little more cheesy sauce them remember but still really good   I also still original red sangria  Red fruity deliciousness    The service good seemed attentive  servers did forget bring water but he apologized brought later   The cons One side plates table dried food before brought any food drink  menu also some dried food it    big deal but should more attentive cleanliness    When arrived only few sitting table asked if could own check  server agreed only sangria more people joined group server told cash group check  All parties six more must same check  doesn't really any sense quite inconvenience   Also table never brought any bread  didn't even think ask actually forgot until saw photo here    Overall food good service ok    overly fond rules but guess just need limit group 5 less  <EOR> I pledge myself every time visit Vegas drop Firefly  Food amazing wine list great sangrias best town  Staff if knowledgeable menu process ingredients   and friendly! feel local ambiance don't stick high prices    <EOR> After being huge fan Firefly Paradise location very eager try new spot while Plaza gets remodeled  loved just much time first  totally kind place would back 1 000 times!

Well case server took few mins long greet table didn't really care us     food came she didn't even ask if liked it    She didn't even top off waters!! She passing table didn't stop once she would coworkers register chatting away     tapas plates empty fast finished waited some interaction her  irritated speak manager then only offered drinks    She allowed same server serve she now being rude purpose  Friday night only maybe 8 10 tables people having bad customer service if full house short staffed sad say won't back particular location I better customer service old firefly wait elbow elbow tables full  The atmosphere ambience also bad    bright no music until addressed why there's no music awkward <EOR> I LOVE PLACE!  I frequent Vegas often but unplanned overnight stay Sunday due layover  ended going Firefly late dinner w friends around 10 30pm  waited less 10 min table four  menu lengthy side but very easy scan through which surprised me  lot words but descriptions point just tell main ingredients  Good enough me   Things ordered Ready set DROOL!

Both parents sister fiancé's mom members wedding party friends town all became severely ill extent visiting hospital emergency room! family ill able see family friends come town first time years   Once realized exactly happened called spoke restaurant manager when first hearing story did seem all surprised  He offered speak boss back us  When finally heard back having track down he offered NOTHING!  even apology!  spending quite bit dinner only family friends fall ill amazed   first Yelp review just let others know  plan special event restaurant! <EOR> Service excellent! ambiance very cool vibe  Love red! drawback food  tapas just ok  Nothing fabulous  lamb sausage tasty goat cheese  Also mushroom pastry little bland  biggest upset evening 40 min wait WORST PAELLA ever! Undercooked starchy mexican flavored rice overcooked seafood chicken meats unexpected  spice saffron rice super disappointed  might good place drink but eat  <EOR> Great food amazing mojitos  Busy location  Friday Saturday better reservations  bar seating area very noisy lot people walking all around you  location best enjoyed midweek dining area  Can't think better place Tuesday date night  <EOR> My husband made super last minute decision try Firefly every other dinner option we'd considered failed  mean list places try    but wasn't explicitly mood tapas night until checked Open Table found table available 10 15   We seated right away waiter magically appeared seconds later take drink orders before I'd even opened drink menu! glad took second peruse because three different kinds sangria decided try sparkling first  wouldn't again more sweet cocktail I'd expected I swear midori but yummy red sangria next made it  red sangria GOOD STUFF   We really hungry ordered 6 dishes enjoyed them all  tiera y mar skewers steak shrimp chorizo baked tetilla patatas bravas crab claw corn dogs i LOVED lobster escargot little lobster knobs scampi de joghne like sauce shrimp ceviche  Everything delicious!   The only thing really lacking service two girls hostess stand ignored kept right chit chatting couple minutes when first walked waiter could've friendlier but nothing egregious food sangria good enough come back MANY times  <EOR> Use any excuse check new Firefly Sahara Summerlin   larger space Paradise think great kids    I came lunch meet old friend noon right before lunch crowd started come through    never full capacity but did pretty busy   Service good but tell hostess wait staff still tryin feel best service guests asking every 5 minutes if ok if needed anything      Since only two shared 4 dishes   ordered babyback ribs mac n cheese thai beef salad terra y mare skewers   thought wasn't going enough but just right   Every dish good just Paradise   first time having mac n cheese really good flavor   Terra y Mare filet mignon steak shrimp chorizo skewers felt just lil overcooked but all else great pretty much melted your mouth  Can't wait back! <EOR> You must order bacon wrapped dates w blue cheese almond  Great music atmosphere staff  Outside patio area when weather nice  chicken salad filet sliders also must Firefly Sahara west side   course if thirsty mojitos sangria hit spot  <EOR> Lovely inventive tapas  shared tender octopus roasted potatoes skewers shrimp sausage filet amazing shrimp mangos soy ginger sauce   The sausage absolutely amazing  Everything perfectly spiced prepared    The space awkward set cold evening wind came through bone chilling  <EOR> We several restaurants while Vegas yes tourists only any good   If you're looking find something off strip  good mortgage payment check Tapas  <EOR> From California Vegas best friend now lives Vegas took here      reading reviews knew wouldn't disappointed! Sure enough fellow Yelpers RIGHT!!! definitely lived its reviews!   It happy hour luck! three best gals shared pitcher White Sangria which mighty tasty   We had Camarones la diabla [I think everything tasted best plate  really made dish delicious spicy chili sauce which YUMMMYY!!] Fried calamari [Calamari good buy anything exciting but Camarones la diabla SAUCE made delicious!!] Roasted eggplant cannelloni [I don't plan getting again love eggplant but goat cheese overwhelming] Firefly*fries [Never wrong fries sauce!!

AGAIN] Stuffed dates [Bacon wrapped stuffed dates sounds good if look salt sweet combination but dates much me! ]  All all although wouldn't try 3 5 plates again want back try everything else because service great plates tried liked    well LOVED!!   Can't wait back! <EOR> I cannot recall name dish ordered but its steak dish potatoes Marsala sauce  Anyhow completely different Paradise location  Same menu prepared completely different    Service Very slow waitress very nice  She snapped when told dish prepared completely different Paradise location  She said wasn't possible because use same recipe  She didn't ask if wanted anything else instead brushed off ate anyway  Later she comes back apologized confirming Paradise location fact prepare differently  Again she did offer bring something else    Conclusion Sangria awesome  love place just location  wrap story cherry top come find later restaurant gave themselves $20 tip! course disputed charge recovered money but probably never back location  <EOR> Don't know any business starts expand but once open other locations around town quality food suffers    Perfect example Firefly Sahara  only decent items olives tomato butter beginning Bacon wrapped dates   We ordered other following items which total failure taste execution Ceviche totally overkilled lime juice could hardly taste fish salt?  Boquerones When ordered Paradise location bread slightly toasted roasted pepper vinaigrette full flavor Aioli garlicky creamy time bread wasn't even toasted pepper vinaigrette barely noticeable aioli only flavorless but also runny! Aioli does run!!!  Mussels Ever mussel jerky? very well here  order almost all shells  when did find mussel honestly size dime! PLEASE SEE PICTURE!!!PLEASE!!!! idiot doesn't know cook mussels properly They're done right when shells open!!!!  Pulpo Asado No charred grilled taste whatsoever   more stewed peppers sherry vinegar    wtf?????  Firefly Fries free because table next did order them already order  Cool! Right? WRONG! drenched same tasteless aioli YUCK!  So waiter suggests Chocolate Tres Leches Banana Nutella Sandwiches      sandwiches forgettable tres leches total mushy mess! You're better off going Mariana's Cardenas getting real deal Holyfield Tres Leches fraction cost   Why all 4 5 star reviews?????Like Flava Flav says Don't believe hype!!!!     ALOHA!!!!! <EOR> I would suggest 10 orders ham cheese croquetas  Jessica best server earth  <EOR> Everytime Vegas favorite stop   absolutely love food service   excited waiting but worth wait   Best time probably noon early evening because anytime later waiting line  strip attempt walk there   wish private chef kitchen cook this   portions small each plate own special flavor   If don't something try anyways because would change your mind  example fan dates but way finished entire thing   writing review actually thinking taking another trip! <EOR> Always great food Firefly!!  best server name Mandy   she awesome great personality good sense humor    Hopefully she working next time because she requested  cool girl!

On flip side service pretty nonexistent all 3 times  Does your server ever come back check your food allow order more food? Rarely usually then aren't hungry more  Does your server bring water keep full? when sit patio     although female back waiter yesterday very attentive   seems only time good service when restaurant actually busy instead off time   bartender chewing gum mouth open while talking guests servers floor talking large groups instead working server even table cell phone good 5 minutes before he left table   also saw fabled creature manager first time well   But all above still awkward server forced some jokes seemed around when needed which welcomed change type service usually here   The food fantastic reasonable priced gourmet style service hit miss   back?

I admit girly girl    why sangria   light fruity tastes good   But other thing price   glass $6 pitcher $24   if during happy hour 3 6 pm weekdays drinks half price!  means pitcher less price drink many Las Vegas establishments     The food issue some people  hard know many tapas especially if you're hungry if you're planning drinking need something your stomach    why think works best group people split number dishes     That being said think everything menu good   never liked dates before but ones fantastic   I'd never tried octopus before but regular basis   mac cheese good especially if vegetarians your party    As service both good bad here   depends time day busy restaurant is   3 pm right when happy hour starts usually fine   plan being time regular basis   yes going walk much sangria want! <EOR> Went again afternoon Saturday lunch all food great except artichoke bread which did enjoy   waiter today excellent service outstanding   Kudos Firefly  <EOR> I've only Firefly couple times drinks nosh tapas  Well glad did since excellent choice  gets super busy come 5pm stays packed until close  I should know pass everyday home work  Try Firefly won't sorry did! <EOR> I think should all friends night restaurant  Share food macaroni shells! share drinks sangria! enjoy menu  Big parties better  Firefly does take reservations expect wait especially weekends! <EOR> I excited see Firefly added restaurant closer house! favorite place Las Vegas dinner too  love isn't chain kind  Even though sangria very popular mojito where its at  favorite mojito mango although passion fruit blueberry close second third  love all plates small portions  love going group friends family choosing many plates  way sample much menu without getting full  favorite chilled tapa menu apple manchango salad  If haven't tried yet must! petite filet also must try!

The service   oh boy where fail why lost many stars me   Our server won't call really blah   When he introduced himself he didn't extra mile talking Happy Hour any specials etc  he just simply asked we'd drink   sum saw four times first introduce himself second take order last bring check return change   did roll eyes when he asked Any change needed? Eff yeah dude!  However credit due food runners bussers ones provided spectacular service   wish could've given them tip instead server   Overall nice location but won't back we'd rather Paradise Rd  instead  <EOR> I've every firefly location town  particular location summerlin area couple times service really wasn't all great    I love everything tried menu which good handful items  cannot say anything bad food positive note  Personal favorites firefly fries crispy served shredded Parmesan cheeses really good dipping sauce delicate little bacon wrapped dates spicy beef salad calamari tomato soup sliders chicken skewers empanadas few others  every location food similarly presented every time absolutely delicious  prices little high tapas but few options shared still leave everyone full happy belly    The thing always when come group friends pitcher sangria passion fruit mojitos  yummy!   The service particular location however another story  never really outstanding  First all hostesses pleasant did really appear wanted working there    Our waiter hardly friendly did return once table check see doing when dined two hours  busser very nice either  She came few times see if done plates when clearly still eating when told she seemed really annoyed    We asked another serving bread cheese fondue dish she forgot that  Since waiter never came back once track down order chance order some Nutella crepe dessert have    I think waitstaff pretty important  big part dining experience contribute ambiance place  am trying bag restaurant all because know back food but sure hope waited people know impeccable customer service next time  <EOR> The tapas excellent   highly recommend dates bacon shrimp   thing most excited paella but when came cooked much water   result rice soggy just wasn't good  <EOR> Crowded Thursday night but really worth wait  fun bar decent but service average which Vegas code great food fair  few good tapas I particularly liked crispy duck egg roll thing most only OK special  Lots Asian fusion tapas which sounds would good but wasn't really except duck thing   much would preferred amazing Spanish dishes   I also little surprised inside almost exactly same old Z Tejas just new paint job  never liked step down dining room think complete renovation space would better   Quite frankly reason crowded because there's dearth places near Summerlin  Which made fun but rushing back anytime soon   B <EOR> Just call Firefly barfly! Love place  three locations now one closed reopened few metres away Simply put Best tuna tartare ever! Refreshing gazpacho delightful selection tapas   They nice happy hour 1 2 off cocktails bar area   I could but already! Read previous reviews It's fun tasty Firefly its just Westside! <EOR> Firefly oh Firefly love thee!!!   Been location twice now while doesn't same feel original Paradise food just good  could Firefly but lets just say favorite places Vegas highly recommend going if haven't already  Although if haven't made decision already based all other great reviews clearly picky!  My only gripe Firefly portion sizes seem change frequently often dishes inconsistent appearance extras dish  Most noticeably Eggplant Canneloni which gotten several times always seems different sizes  Sometimes big sometimes small sometimes medium    point   Outside no major complaints  <EOR> Random find tapas place but best steak ever had  $20 fries dipping aioli can't price  steak topped blue cheeses crumbles tender perfectly seasoned  boyfriend fan place until he tried sirloin  search find steak better theirs' haven't found yet! <EOR> I absolutely love Firefly Paradise review them already  crazy excited now close house because town spoils point where dread having drive more 10 minutes anything  does stack up??  Initially expecting ambiance even come close Paradise location unfortunately right  even close  But props fireplace  Even though off side nowhere sight while eating  looks typical restaurant would find neighborhood  strikes more Firefly people might bring kids which definitely wouldn't say Paradise spot  may due fact around lunch time  some reason average decor takes bit magic all  guess should day kids nice both options   The hostess very friendly  waiter other hand crappiest waiters had  guy reminded Andy Samberg minus personality  part don't really care about  mean should friendly service industry but if great waiter attentive easily look past lack friendliness  guy however never really checked anything filled drinks saw if needed anything all   he disappeared gas station play machines pick pack smokes something while busboy took care everything  busboy way also pretty nice  also came point where ask hostess tell waiter ready check    just plain sad  Now should note during lunch time  possible other waiters during lunch nighttime staff better but yet seen   The food pleasantly similar paradise location  quite par but close enough think  definitely prefer herb roasted chicken other location  menu appeared identical    I say Mojitos bit better here  don't crush mint where wind sucking mint particles through straw other one  Maybe argued supposed but crazy mind better version  usually much Mojito drinker but always tempted order them Firefly  kinda reminds Family Guy where Brian drinks Mojito while he's dating show  don't think gay drink  Mo jiiiiito  Lol  normal drink Jack Coke few times actually branch out    So there's overall assessment Firefly West Sahara  probably back  Plus if service isolated incident probably regular  <EOR> I feeling blue good friend took Paradise  fell love love love place! sangria sweet nectar Wino Gods!  normally don't dates but OMG!

However all Firefly locations Vegas area worst service   glasses would left dry long time   Nobody check sure enough drink   The Anthem much busier location yet service much better  <EOR> We Firefly Thursday night surprised crowded was   Good thing reservation   found why people flock restaurant ordered 5 6 generously portioned tapas including duck rolls tortilla espagnol pulpo asado grilled octopus apple manchego salad wilted spinach salad   plenty two people bill came $50 drinks included   left very satisfied dining experience   Firefly definitely worth checking next time Vegas  <EOR> Happy hour allows drink half priced cocktail list sangria die for  Every time Hubs try something new never feel disapointed  Some favorites are Watermelon skinny Sandia cocktail no longer menu but you Octopus pulpa asado Thai beef salad Stuffed dates Fish sticks  The crowd worth mentioning well bar staff  give top notch service  Cheers! <EOR> On Sun  11 24 4 arrived Firefly brunch time   only 6 others restaurant 1 server   all tapa orders only steak turned out   friend's eggs came alone plate toast burnt buttered   Myself another friend ordered same warm spinach salad sent them back because swimming very acidic dressing didn't contain any red peppers   exchanged garden salad but equally small didn't contain hearts palm stated menu   server chef forgot eggplant cannoloni half hour came only reminder   Unfortunately tiny portion mushy obviously overcooked   Since  serving pumpkin beignets weren't offered bread basket good almond butter   asked then received enough two weren't offered more   The restaurant never did see many guests morning considering faux pas many items ordered manager could offered future free meal desserts all glass wine   But merely asked if wanted anything else   As recent newcomer Firefly impressed no plans return neither Sahara location nor Paradise   K K I <EOR> I visiting friend Las Vegas he happened bring nifty little joint   and little mean quite large  When first walked chilly Tuesday night restaurant seemed poppin'  looking around realized most kids teenagers! WHY! where cool kids flock during weekdays Vegas?  The hostess seated few minutes took orders  FREEZING! restaurant heard thing called HEAT?!?! especially cold table because positioned right next patio door  Every time someone walked through   WHOOSH! slap cold air delivered directly into face  OK maybe exaggerating bit   but cold!  I ordered meatball tapa nice salad sliders  all extremely satisfying! especially liked sliders but bit full off other orders bread  friends ordered fries   and meal   was   wow  fries themselves weren't fantastic but when bunch friends table just talking   the finger foods inevitably eaten just because front us   So meal  little pricey drinks   the service subpar   and shivering most time  But if you're going catch some friends or new ones all means   go it!  I can't say again because don't live Vegas but wouldn't mind returning if someone wanted go  all all    mediocre   Bring jacket  <EOR> Delicious!

VIBE Cool Energetic Loud music played throughout Evening Hustle Bustle Staff  DRINKS Red Sangria great balance fruit wine which resulted very tasty concoction would expect good ordered 2 pitchers!   FOOD sweet nutty ALMOND BUTTER came COMPLIMENTARY bread OUTSTANDING!   **TAPAS incredible flavors texture just everything ordered FILET MIGNON Eggplant STEW thin Toasty Bread delicious EMPANADAS came crispy full porky flavors  **PAELLA Packed all sorts MEAT SEAFOOD could find single complaint tenderness flavors each element regard   RICH SAUCE encompassed every single solid object sizzling hot pan very HEAVY but overwhelming RICE cooked PERFECTLY however typically prefer rice fluffier but $18 Paella did its job far am concerned!   SERVICE only complaint somewhat slow times when trying some attention more bread water just ordering more food   server doing best but sympathize overwhelming demand service particular night   wait 40 minutes finally table understand perhaps understaffed?   Due quality price food able overlook slow service grant Firefly into Vegas Hall Fame! <EOR> Cam some friends enjoyed myself  huge group but service great sangria bomb! love keep flowing water  bacon wrapped dates always treat! Definitely recommend!! <EOR> First time particular location  great place small large parties drinks light bites  always fan tapas    Some favorites include macaroni cheese padron peppers bacon wrapped dates weren't good before hopefully just off night shrimp diablo    On particular location brought friend's 3 year old daughter  greatest location kids but running options good alternative  staff very accommodating ended being fantastic evening   Good company helps highly recommend place groups  <EOR> Ok let's thing straight when comes dining look 3 main things your experience pleasurable 1 service 2 food 3 atmosphere! Sometimes may totally overshadow other nothing really help it  happened when visited celebrate friends birthday  Walking into place dark but lively  hostess friendly sat right away  warned Saturday night busy don't take reservations FCFS  Well Jorge came started Watermelon Mojito eh bad   ordered Petit Filet Duck Roll Ahi Tartare Ceviche mixed Paella  Believe two people way much but necessary  All tapas ordered delicious  seafood fresh hot plates hot  favorite Filet Mignon tender juicy plus loved sides came with spinach potatoes  Everything came quick except Paella but takes awhile  While eating tapas hostess approached bc she needed table big party  does that!? little taken aback but said ok  When server came back move asked if normally he said few times? What? worked restaurants over 10 yrs never done that  move loss words  momentum gabbing lost mention ppl watching move  Anyways manager duty think name Carlos came apologize took care but still awkward  Paella finally came enormous! could feed six ppl  very tasty   also white red sangria both good but preferred white  alcoholic apple juice  dessert tarts which size dollar coins but just enough since stuffed dinner  food point  Atmosphere loud dim next time we'll eat bar  Jorge nice knowledgable attentive  But game musical chairs while eating no bueno! <EOR> I love love love tapas am new fan Firefly     1  Gather group friends 2  Order pitcher sangria 3  Order everything your heart desires 4  Taste little bit everything 5  Order more sangria 6  Take notes know dishes order avoid next time   7  Top off meal dessert more sangria!  With many tapas options menu obviously some hits misses   Personally lot more hits including Bacon wrapped dates sweet salty bacony always hit Manchego mac n cheese best mac n cheeses ever had Artichoke toast hearts basil aioli pepper perfect blend flavors Petit filet medium very tender but mushrooms red wine sauce favorite part  Tierra y Mar skewers shrimp filet mignon sausage skewer  Delish   But order your filet medium  Steak mushroom skewers another hit Camarones al ajillo recommended waiter star meal! Chocolate tres leches Cherry bread pudding both decadent desserts definitely order again    The items without next time Tuna tartare Shrimp ceviche both missing something maybe salt? Firefly fries if don't mind your fries soggy then enjoy Firefly's version   prefer mine more crispy which why didn't appeal me  aioli tasty though    And course sangria mojitos faaaaabulous  But may also because just baby first taste alcohol 9 months  Come during happy hour drink even more! atmosphere vibe great   service best encountered while! <EOR> We able slip into Firefly during lunch when crowded  group 12 lucky wasn't  However restaurant doesn't plan well larger groups tapas styles all plates ordering didn't fit well table at    The menu wide array items everyone should able find item like  personally enjoyed filet minon sliders good balance between sauce feta  ahi tuna little tough would better if just seared outside instead completely cooked  However tapas style great try number dishes didn't order add did such mac cheese which pretty good considering am big mac cheese kind guy   They also good selection drinks compliment various tapas  good wait staff good ambiance would say I'd back but only if drive bit way  <EOR>
