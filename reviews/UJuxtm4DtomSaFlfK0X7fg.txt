After debating where eat lunch friend decided try cafe out   simple yet classy but else would expect eatery inside Neiman Marcus   As soon sat down waiter came over took drink orders   He also served famous puff pastry side strawberry butter some kind broth   Since never before didn't know broth for   looked around see if anyone doing anything theirs We felt place was    didn't see anything just left it   later found supposed di pastry it   Anyway LOVED puff pasty   light delicious   Perfect little starter!  friend didn't care much though   Oh well   I ordered Chicken Paillard   couldn't pass all yummy veggies it!  All all good but nothing special   However under 500 calories really couldn't complain   tell many calories each item menu which helps eating healthy    Friend ordered turkey wrap I think she seemed enjoy well   Service decent   liked waiter wasn't overbearing yet drinks filled every time half way done   He attentive very nice   staff wasn't snobby anything   lady sat next didn't she ordered he switched no questions asked     If anything say cafe little pricey but again would expect cafe Neiman     Would come back?  Sure why not   absolute best place eat Fashion Show?  Probably but definitely worth try once  <EOR> This restaurant really hidden gems strip  favorite places lunch great service fantastic food atmosphere relaxing  <EOR> Nothing good place me  Asian Chicken Salad $18 nothing special can't even taste dressing  husband burger fries $18 well he said burger's dry fries soggy menu said special dressing   husband took Culinary Arts knew dressing just ketchup worcestershire sauce  What's special bout it? Would really prefer Nordstrom Cafe over Neiman Marcus! <EOR> Someone told NM Café popovers  popover! would otherwise never gone place  food actually pretty good  But if popovers could serve Alpo bowl still love place  <EOR> I stumbled upon solely due fact shopping Neiman Marcus didn't want fast food food court  asked SA recommendation close fast food decent she recommended it  bit skeptical because hey she does all work NM! pleasantly suprised    The menu mostly American some Asian fusion mixed in  can't believe Im saying but most awesome fries EVER  ignore sweets anything but fries other hand chocolate  fantastic  guess seasoning but way freaking yummy!   They great salads burgers sandwiches well extensive bar  Great little place if you're shopping area lazy did  very pleasantly suprised place  <EOR> I Vegas 8 years eaten quite bit   always very good until last 2 trips   may under new management something but food service taken real downward dip recently   2 trips ago wife both sent back burgers which normally mainstay menu thick handmade juicy delicious   mushy overlooked clearly pre molded frozen patty   Response shake head explanation  now  Also specially request popover broth pre meal   Last trip Saturday even worse experience   Started off ordering problems I asked turkey sandwich now burger no good inquired whether hot since advertised melted cheese    told no  but could hot if wanted   Also asked no mayo lettuce   Sandwich arrives cold lettuce mayo   send back lady brings back still lettuce then asks if am ok lettuce still being sandwich   Wanting eat family accept but open further inspection still mayo well   Sent back again sandwich #3 came back cold again time  no cheese snippy comment server which seemed warn favors   Ended eating half before quitting     Last insult bill comes no apology trouble anyone just free cookie no discounts bill   Also forgot mention basically bully way into popover bread again apparently out   Server wanted take hummus pita instead?  no broth maybe stopped that?  NM please straighten give back restaurant!  new version awful definitely worth $60 two person lunch  <EOR> My first time coming thought fantastic!

But no big complaints   Out all menu items settled simply cheeseburger fries  With all buffets Asian eats forgotten good burger could taste seasoned ground beef cooked perfection thick slab cheddar toasted ciabatta bread  Good stuff   There couple other things did surprise 1 service attentive without hovering   some reason assumed lunch going uncomfortable   pleasantly mistaken  and 2 serve popover start meal accompanied small plate strawberry jam cream cheese   warm tasty but wished given end meal because felt more dessert item starter   Overall liked NM Cafe   don't know if return since loyalties lie more trusty Nordies Cafe  <EOR> I decided few days back impressed cleanliness restaurant  quickly sat table near bar  sun peeking through windows thought lighting great! However table itself crumbs gave urky feeling   A few minutes later server appeared he seemed rather uninterested us  He put menu specials between friend  said he would return when ready order  He didn't emphasize drink specials specials menu  few moments later he came back ordered  When asked water he brought warm water TOSSED handed straw  unprofessional!  Anyway friend chicken paillard trout!  Both dishes massive cooked perfection   couldn't finish plate appetizer dish would totally work two guests!  The pomegranate lemonade refreshing!  would recommend it! <EOR> 4 5 stars The menu pleasant food big size taste   service minimal   tables crumbs them   But mall definitely alternative  <EOR> After fantastic day shopping Forum shops craving cocktails  leaving mall spotted NM Cafe decided looked great spot cocktail   The bartender friendly helpful she mixed some great drinks  also ordered some snacks more hungry would ordered full meal  <EOR> I lunch today 3 friends  bartender fantastic  She friendly made some great drinks!  server general manager came over see everything was  salmon tacos burger special salad fresh perfectly cooked  Only suggestion would screen some sort block sun  back!! <EOR> Great place reasonable price everything 20$ under  4x now every sandwich Ive amazing omg      crab cake burger fabulous orgasm mouth  Also salmon die try =D   Selection great food drink tea   The only con im young short asian 21 but look if im 16 17+ but know fact don't dress bad cause im logo whore Louie Prada Gucci know kinda service might trowing me  bummer note anyone reads food industry never know young teens new future especially web disposal <EOR> NM cafe perfect place illy Coffee break  illy Coffee served complementary popper strawberry butter  Mediterranean sampler great filling snack    They understaffed almost every time gone in   just server covering 6 7 tables  Although overworked waiter bus person encountered really super nice  Due lack staff eat when aren't hurry anywhere  food ambiance good lounging  <EOR> Very nice day retail therapy! always great soup day     bartender never disappoints opt privacy indoors sitting outside people watching @ Fashion Show mall  big fan bread but strawberry butter grand! <EOR> We some really idyllic nomming other weekend   DH started tomato fennel soup shrimps   yum   Then he tuna melt but just any tuna melt   light fresh tasting tomatoes beautiful slice american cheese salad side   ate strip steak tomato burrata salad   could better this?  appetizer salad entree all luncheon sized plate   nice sized tv could watch some football friendly barman   Nice but brief list wines glass lovely tempting full bar  <EOR> Bad service bad food  Meat hard  French fries over salted  table knife cut beef  <EOR> Went brunch Neiman Marcus cafe Sunday morning!
