repeated question menu added shall just find spot sit? she said yes   tried find table clean utensils but wasn't successful   only occupied table all rest them dirty previous patrons partial no utensils   Normally doesn't bother but 3 girls behind register area chatting cook seemed very busy also   asked if someone could possibly clean off table girls looked pointed asked what's wrong one?    needless say pointed table needed wiped down seat pizza sauce looked possibly salad dressing too   asked if could seated table since prefer sit booth she said well why didn't just say first place?    at point chose leave   Normally would let all slide IF I'd known food would worth it   perhaps she having bad day maybe was?  way won't going back choose street Maestro's instead    <EOR>
