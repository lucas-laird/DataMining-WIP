Why just keep making people love instead making them feel forced try something new? having seasonal items important but when quality food suffers  said lot wonderful regular food items choose but no problem taking off menu little no notice try something different may may work out  <EOR> we new years eve wonderful dinner drinks friends send meal back warmed waitress said no problem few minutes later Mgr came back New plate nice top off he took off bill amazed suprised want say much appreciated b back  thank again <EOR> Great food great staff great beer selection! restaurant concept does everything right!! <EOR> Went family   service outstanding   Jenny server   Very attentive very warm personality   pace meal spot very front if don't care anything want anything special accommodate    We calamari  not your typical battered calamari sweet tangy sauce it   Different but did enjoy it  entrée warm chicken focaccia bread  loved it!  tried some wifes pasta fathers Chicken Parmesan   If any gripe food tad bland side   Nothing little seasoning couldn't fix  Overall good vibe solid crowd   Would love sit psyio next time pooches  <EOR> Arizona amazing!!!!! mango margarita delicious  mom vacation loved place  <EOR> Absolutely delicious!  whole family enjoyed food atmosphere  chicken pot pie burgers black blue pizza chicken parmigiana all great  Service prompt friendly  22oz Pale Ales cold smooth  return frequently! <EOR> I'd give 2 1 2 if option  super friendly atmosphere inviting then things very wrong    Orders came 20 minutes apart took 20 minutes receive another round beers manager came over apologized but most unapologetic way  could reasons why never again sad because place nice beer good food mediocre best  never establishment again    <EOR> The beer sampler place start great beers!

When originally 1st plate fries disappearing fast  decided move fries back person ordered before disappeared front us  fries DANGEROUSLY DELICIOUS ! i dont say much   When 2 more orders came it  Very well seasoned  Deliciously crispy well made  dipping sauce wasn't even needed ! Best cajun fries ever !   Hair Dog Bloody Mary Vodka tomato juice black pepper fresh lime + horseradish garnished olives pickled green beans + celery  This brunch cocktail picked  haven't bloody mary ages thought worth try cost $5  Pretty good pricing  Granted smaller seen other restaurants offer but still fairly decent sized  tasted vodka tomato juice some lime since squeezed wedge lime into drink   Black pepper horseradish indistinguishable  Celery bit weird XD Surprisingly pickled green bean tasty  don't really olives but ate anyway XD asian habits wasting food   drink itself eh  ok  think better versions    Was pretty indecisive wanted order  much breakfast brunch fan typically didn't really know order  Especially Brunch menu  Country Chicken + Biscuit crispy fried chicken housemade chicken sausage two sunny side eggs housemade buttermilk biscuit cajun gravy spiced maple syrup  Aside eyes housemade carnitas + tater tot hash  Some other friends ordered looked really good  country chicken biscuit ok  biscuit pretty yummy  housemade chicken sausage good  Less bite expected sausage  fried chicken mildly dry definitely wasnt crispy anymore  gravy good mop biscuit  Couldn't really tell maple syrup spiced any different normal syrup  XD  My friend ordered pork fried rice  includes smoked bacon pork sausage veggies + cabbage topped egg omelette  fried rice very typical american establishment  Includes shredded carrots peas    Lol rice bit undercooked hard  omelette weirdest part all  Ok omelette top fried rice  Doesn't sound weird right? But omelette    like    dry quiche without all unique characteristics quiche ingredients   seemed thrown round pan thrown into oven long period time    even worse microwaved  WORST OMELETTE EVER !

Now  call good customer service  <EOR> The Skinny food tasty  Portion sizes price great 2 service pretty standard 3 value hard justify coming back when better tasting restaurants nearby way better price point  2 quick lunch weekday came away disappointed   Just FYI joint highly popular Summerlin crowd    I ordered chicken pesto salad which came little scoop sun dried tomato hummus two miniscule slices flathead  grilled chicken rubbery texture rather pale color some grill marks it  definitely tasty  Worse yet super odd pesto slathered in  hummus completely bland  honest prefer Sabra's yeah! listeria laced hummus brand over hummus tried here   marinated tomatoes unpleasantly sour mealy while portion greens rather small  Meh definitely better   The hubs ordered fish tacos which sucked  He only two tacos which featured dry bland mahi mahi  pico de gallo tasteless  served rice beans   hubs thought beans tasted straight can  He'd rather hit Rubio's    Service solid quick  tempted send stuff back but rush didn't want bother  Instead home could wash horrible aftertaste pesto mouth    It's hard justify coming back when food isn't even good  Portion sizes price also great but then again really want more bad thing? Avoid joint plague 2 starred review <EOR> Excellent food!

Sesame seeds gluten  should pose no problem  if why salad even listed GF menu hard leaving sesame seeds off salad?  But point argue people making food just opted fruit instead  Imagine confusion when bring salmon covered sesame seeds  also covered some kind asian ginger sauce  Most asian sauces gluten  GF menu did mention any kind sauce description  waited until waiter came back over check asked if he sure gluten free item because sauce  He assured salmon gluten free    I ate but shouldn't have  Later night severely ill usual symptoms when getting glutened    Yes partially because should trusted instincts especially when refused bring salad sesame seeds because supposedly gluten but then bring salmon covered sesame seeds tell GF   think if going offer gluten free items though need better train staff  pretty sure supposed include ginger sauce salmon  a soy sauce most likely contains wheat    The third star because seriously enjoyed cucumber thyme lemonade  <EOR> I few times now always sit bar   Food great every time   tried Brussels Sprouts Wok Fried Chicken Kung Paper bowl Sicilian Turkey Meatballs Sweet Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl all great   Service bar very down earth super friendly real good place great vibe   Pet friendly patio cool huge patio probably 30 tables loaded dogs    <EOR> Visited place first time April 30  Forsure return  Don't time it   Food 3 5 5 Chose beer appetizers should burger because definitely good decision  sin city say hello Amber pint  HORRIBLE taste dirty water  Definitely should replaced  ordered loaded potato hush puppies  Which awesome side dish moist potato bacon taste  Good enough share  Also Japanese cucumber salad  Which just bunch cucumber wish Asian dressing nothing amazing  friends say burgers exceptional tho    Service 1 5 This why return  booth right behind p o s  Which any given time 2 6 workers around it  received food checked once water refill time  Then finished meal eventually  minimum 20 minutes sat finished plates waiting     waiting      waiting  any given time no lapse 2 6 workers standing 2 feet away  eventually spoke servers checks  Which he basically said ok told another server even coming over table  waiter spent most 20 minutes another table 8 feet away having convo couple  She came over once happened  asked checks boxes  She brought checks  Which immediately cash card ready  Yet waited another 5 7 minutes while still minimum 4 servers standing 2 feet away  checks obviously ready standing  She came back took checks  Cashed returned all but 1 check which 3 dollar change but she assumed tip  no box  waited another 5 minutes before announcing group 3 4 servers need box  Finally box able leave  restaurant less half full over staffed yet no attention any server   There reason called lazy dogs Lazy workers    For most part pretty much yard house  Save your self trouble yard house  least until train workers properly management team keeps workers busy  <EOR> The food fantastic atmosphere great probably best food area town!

Peach juice small bottle champagne! decent but say prefer frozen version better    As meal decided pork fried rice BACON pork sausage carrots peas cabbage omelette top  HUGE portion definitely didn't finish it  take home  Unfortunately did really notice much pork sausage fried rice but definitely bacon  quite well rice  rice itself kind dry kind hard  dish also needed more flavor   the bacon could only much  also looked two toned  dish wasn't really prepared well  think used soy sauce but didn't use enough cover whole dish    just poured soy sauce into but did bother mix it  omelette top? Ugh  Overcooked looked prepared microwave  prefer egg mixed fried rice    I think if used enough soy sauce used some ham or maybe even spam bacon mixed egg into fried rice add some green onions add sesame oil some garlic bits    it would turned better  Oh better rice     might used rice old    Overall think service fantastic  server nothing but helpful definitely top everything  food impressed dish honestly really type place I'd rush come back to  <EOR> The atmosphere sub par arrived late evening during week seated promptly  Upon arrival observed large number large families groups  seated booth right across large groups which made environment loud  service okay  fiancé ordered cocktail server came back incorrect drink  service heavily reflected rating  Took awhile water refilled fiancés drink never corrected took extended bit time receive food  food lacked flavor  choose burger believed impossible mess burger  However managed prove wrong  burger dry lacked flavor filling  dish wasn't presented well granted burger but presentation aside food lacking    I highly doubt return impressed  restaurant plenty parking located northwest end downtown summerlin  adding more stores near which completed now time review may affect availability parking if choose come early   It okay but happier elsewhere  <EOR> Fantastic lunch!
