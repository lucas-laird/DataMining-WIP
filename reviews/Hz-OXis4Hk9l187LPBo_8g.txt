Granted all breakfast sandwich whole wheat bread but delicious   one best ones had  stopped way show fast filling meal  sandwich bigger expected   twice size Starbucks' breakfast sandwich  food court there's lots seating! <EOR> The food pretty good  lines always nerves but McDonalds next door even worse  just done enough space many employees should  sure would again  But maybe <EOR> This location just opened  May 24th 2013 first day business   I hadn't eaten Schlotzsky's many years being work area looking forward  having somewhere new lunch at   I've eaten twice now since opened  both visits fast very friendly  Being they're brand new  really wouldn't expect less stellar service   The food good real change pace available around here  <EOR> Fav sandwich pastrami Swiss! turkey guacamole awesome too!! Worth more just 3 stars ! <EOR> I dunno why listed pizza place believe Scholtzky's known more sandwiches  sell flat bread pizzas though along breakfast sandwiches chips too    I medium smoked turkey sandwich sourdough bread could hardly finish it pretty big  also pretty good sandwich too  random unbusy time sandwich freshly made pretty quickly   Located Excalibur's upstairs food court nice find something dripping grease some other fast food places around  <EOR> I ordered breakfast quesadilla decent  They give 2 pieces  huge portions    If you're going across way breakfast burgers spot meals come tater tots!  The breakfast sandwiches bigger other spot  would eat again bad food court meal   The service minimal! Don't expect smile warm greeting any kind good customer service skills all! <EOR> Easy location find Excalibur food court  stayed Luxor quick walk over  Plenty places sit even peak breakfast time   Onto food ate breakfast quesadilla sausage  tortilla bit flaky broke easily when tried eating it  Sausage bit bland I'd switch different add next time  quesadilla itself large worth price paid    Service unimpressive  Cashier seemed she bad mood took them close 10 minutes food made  categorize place borderline fast food close 10 minutes pretty slow  <EOR> This place wasn't bad fast food  only place open 4am between hotel club coming from  caprese sandwich flavour good bread fresh but cheese wasn't melted though which would preferred  <EOR> Don't excited! If you're Schlotzskys fan location disappoint you! paid $16 small original soda cup soup  dont where live looking forward it  When order called asked if pickle bag  I told pickles   bummed   sat down ate food disappointed quality   tasted nothing Schlotzskys! bread hard onions cold raw  Just tasted off  soup barely warm  wish hadnt wasted money  Id skip location  <EOR> I absolutely love Schlotzsky's  office mate back Rochester MN introduced fast food place years ago  problem closest Apple Valley hour away just shy Minneapolis  did quick trip heaven   Since then excited when see Schlotzsky's  bought original sandwich plane ride home Denver  time thrilled find food court Excalibur   I tend original sandwich which kicked assorted sub but much better  lean ham salami lettuce red onion black olives three different cheeses special sauce good  don't normally love olives but eat them when sandwich  detail also speaks volumes! also love French dip which steers away salami gives yummy roast beef  kicker pretzel bun perfect   My friend sitting down resting feet  placed order waited patiently  I'd say five minutes later meal  brought table sat down eat   My original sandwich yummy  ingredients fresh delicious  washed down fountain drink   I'd definitely come back sandwich fix  180 <EOR> I visited Schlotzsky's ordered Garden Salad Philly cheesesteak sandwich  Philly cheesesteak cold tasted fake  Ended vomiting immediately afterwards  things worse rude abrasive angry old bitter cashier lady displayed terrible customer service  personally would never recommend eating avoiding all cost!!! <EOR> The store really drops ball  Balsamic vinegar sandwiches store carries none  sandwiches mediocre without schlotzkys sauces since store does stock them should avoided  <EOR> Had craving bagel egg came here   total regret $7 plain bagel cheese roasted veggies   Bagel soggy egg veggies flavor less  Should gone outside casino something else because food good <EOR> If could give place negative 5 star rating would! Schlotzsky's always family tradition bring food home California whole family  food always amazing course never tried location  management service terrible  give Schlotzsky's bad name  messed order 3 separate times  way back California stopped Barstow quadruple checked order noticed messed again   First off don't believe anyone should check order even once  However fiance always check least once  third time think any competent person should gotten order right  Fortunately give manager Bahmin props he did refund sandwich never given us  Although believe asking picture fiance's credit card extremely unethical  should able refund card without images both sides card    Basically sum all would die before eating location again  <EOR> A soup kind day  Broccoli cheese soup Hit spot  Along sourdough turkey club perfect <EOR> This place looked going great option breakfast very few options Excalibur  line long food looked fresh    When paid $6 breakfast burrito expected substance since all other items menu cheaper     I incredibly dissapointed  burrito probably smallest burrito ever had  Even Starbucks Spinach Feta Wrap more substantial    Very unfortunate  If hungry elsewhere  <EOR>
