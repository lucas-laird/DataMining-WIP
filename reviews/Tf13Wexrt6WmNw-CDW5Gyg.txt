SPINAL cord injury which sitting painful only sit padded booth special pad injury  invited friend's birthday party before going called ask if restaurant booths padded seats told yes  party wait 20mins only booth open up  When inside booth wood bench padded back  asked speak restaurant manager explained injury called ahead asked seating  man 40s seemed very unconcerned if petty complaint  He dismissed issue only responding staff no common sense  said well then why don't educate them find new staff? He replied things changed just shook head said want it? said worked when 16 felt unacceptable  told he should least take care friend's bill birthday  waitress came over said heard birthday girl manager going take care dessert!! said no guy friend's birthday dinner  Many restaurants comp birthday desserts good business practice think manager could done much better job  restrooms also very dirty  No toilet paper wet dirty floor paper towels all over floor  going back!!!! <EOR> I excited try Meatball Spot but came away pretty disappointed   prices seem decent until see small portions are  full size salads joke sides ridiculously small   garlic fries cost $6 aren't even enough person   classic meatballs spicy meat sauce good but don't come enough sauce   bread comes them small hard very good   cool concept fails execution  <EOR> I think place succeeding   3 times past month half each time Its very consistent tasteful  don't understand bad reviews  Plus server recognized when sat down section which HUGE plus me  server LOVE when people return means your doing something right  friend tried meatballs special which buffalo balls those need menu ASAP  would love hands sauce recipe because some wings would amazing  Buffalo Wild Wings should take some pointers  <EOR> Terrible    Meatball sampler  Five dry fried meatballs  5 boring sauces  Two pieces toast   Pass spot   <EOR> As Vegas locals Saturday brunch 2 23 13   Let forewarn anyone like us keen family kid places rambunctious little kids majority tables   sitting back wooden bench kids at three separate tables all crawling jumping bench causing already uncomfortable hard wooden seating continuously bumped annoying little kid behind airplane kicking your seat     Our two drinks took 15 minutes   would ten but server forgot ordered vodka OJ then didn't know kinds vodka had     I ordered house salad which server smart enough tell salads don't lettuce   Weird but okay fine   caesar salad lettuce good     Then turkey meatballs fiancé meatball sampler garlic fries   Since don't offer spicy meatless sauce asked red pepper when ordered which didn't get   asking three times bus boy finally brought it   But say all food good   Way overpriced but tasty   For dessert ordered first thing menu Classic Chocolate Chip Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich fiancé milkshake ordered two espressos   waiting significant amount time served two large mugs cappuccinos  !!!

Seriously pre prepared meatball sauce salad deep fried fries   server took away coworker's fork never replaced asked hot sauce several times until received ask glass water twice  Minor issues but price food quality service above par   Conclusion Would ever back?  unless someone celebrating event some sort would require go   cost meal could easily Rao's Caesar's Palace ate I mean pretty much exact same meatballs   <EOR> Despite ton negative reviews decided try spot ourselves  Christmas Day pretty busy probably due fact wasn't much else open eat Town Square  short 10 minute wait seated   I checked menu online beforehand kind knew expect  However take note prices changed listed website  Meatballs $7 95 now know pizza prices different well  huge deal but something may bother some people   We ordered classic meatballs tomato sauce beef meatballs spicy meat sauce panzanella salad  asked server salad asked if traditional bread salad  He replied actually don't know  guess find together! Ummm what? He explained lot people order salads he's really familiar all them  Inexcusable opinion  menu extensive no reason know inside out    The food took 35 minutes arrive which thought quite long few meatballs salad  guess lucky though table next waiting well over 45 minutes chicken meatballs never ended coming out  server explained them kitchen very backed which odd received all other food ordered  guessing chicken meatballs forgotten    The food itself actually pretty good  Decent sized meatballs good flavor just enough sauce  spicy meat sauce really good however found classic sauce little lacking  salad nice however only three small pieces bread ours ton tomatoes  little less tomato little more croutons would perfect   During dinner waited forgot refill water when asked twice  He kind disappeared  other things noticed great  point server put large tray food directly behind unsuspecting diner  If diner gotten any reason tray going down  same food runner also didn't seem know ordered while he tickets tray he just placing food middle table letting diners grab themselves    We also felt really bad young guy handling dessert milkshake area  While waiting seated ordered two coffees bring excellent employees candy store review follow saw poor guy struggle keep up  point he ran whipped cream asked blonde server if she could run back grab some him  server responded coldly don't time that  walked away  Horrible teamwork there    I must say hostesses very nice great first impression restaurant   Will return?

Supposedly ingredients composed Meatball Spot's Meatballs all Italian themed believed contain more exotic ingredients such chopped rosemary tarragon basil cilantro parsley etc  If then Prep Line Cooks really must fucking because twice tastes regular gigantic sized meatball!

At least tell whoever making shakes them faster! fact before train them flagship dishes line should them learn all milkshakes first  mean DAMN some nice fucking milkshakes!  It took 25 minutes milkshake come eating some sort meatball sandwich  But man well made beverage work minutes later could still taste aftertaste peanut butter chocolate mouth  Even during closing 5 half hours later could still smell breath thats good thing     Have considered centering menu AROUND your great milkshakes instead? Milkshakes MAY made faster meatballs which required mixed prep station then boiled en masse line possibly refrigerated walk in further use following day  <EOR> We arrived around 5 15pm Tuesday night  place empty  The place did begin fill around 6pm  liked look it  waiter super friendly  Service decent  food pricing sucked  Way overpriced   I Chicken Meatballs spicy sauce  sure really expected 3 small balls meat but spicy sauce all spicy meatballs sort boring  ZZZzzzz bread side butter it  Yuck   also ordered $5 99 oversized cheese pizza slice because basically server told meatballs enough food  Uh pizza oversized  total rip off 6 bucks  bigger slice pizza anywhere strip!

Garbage Salad Special Meatballs Cookie Explosion shake perfection!! <EOR> They say 3rd time's charm but 3rd visit anything but   last review place first time came then came another time again just okay   invited boss try again today lunch meeting   She's vegetarian invited try because vegetarian meatballs   Imagine blow when told vegetarian meatballs   Being vegetarian doesn't eat salads she decided order cheese pizza mac n cheese   She liked mac n cheese but pizza stone cold     I ordered classic meatballs spicy meat sauce   kind dry just okay   also ordered cucumber tomato salad which actually very good   would given meal 3 stars but alas boss's experience continued downhill    She ordered vanilla ice cream sandwich dessert it   Again   she decided just cup coffee luke warm   server didn't even offer cream   Also while waiting order coffee dessert he walked said need anything else? person said yes actually before he could finish server said your check? RUDE!    I'm pretty much over place   Nothing worth return visit   wouldn't recommend anyone  <EOR> Written while back Last week bunch co workers  personally ordered beef meatballs garlic parmesan sauce  meatballs delicious sauce okay  good thing ordered side spaghetti spicy meat sauce sauce much better  Maybe wasn't cream sauce mood  thing noticed serving size spaghetti very small comparison price $6 99 quarter bowl    They garlic parmesan fries Rainbow Cookie time! made huge mistake ordering strawberry ice cream    ORDER ICE CREAM IF EXPECTING NORMAL ICE CREAM! more sorbet like disgusting taste  craving something sweet could barely through bite   The customer service eh  don't think personalized service smiled all  group tables together but ended seating group people end without addressing it  served strawberry sorbet instead ice cream first correct although maybe should stuck sorbet instead    All all not so stellar experience  only thing saving spot location meatballs  <EOR> Not good  boyfriend kept asking name never sounded appetizing but finally tonight said ok  disappointment  Before begin say place really cute  really restaurant itself doors all open Spring time when warmer quite cold tonight probably great when there's nice warm breeze  Ok walked weren't offered table some reason host asked if would sit bar  both thought because no seats said ok  Once bar wait no want table    sure if misunderstanding if bar empty he trying fill some younger people? Anyways    Waitress finally came over split meatball platter which 1 each meatball each sauce perfect 2 people first time here  Well meatballs good    all dry dunked them sauce just choke them down  flavor wasn't even there  when came Veggie meatball almost gagged  tasted nothing veggie burger mushy just inedible  wanted badly spit but swallowed huge gulp water even shoved extra sauce mouth  Gross! Even sauces lacking  marinara okay?! Nothing special though  also shared piece pizza    Nothing impressive kinda burnt being reheated  mention food came 5 minutes ordering betting all premade probably microwaved based dryness  wouldn't ever return     Should trusted instinct  <EOR> I think place moving Planet Hollywood website says  just townsquare 10 6 13 location closed down    We lunch over summer enjoyed place quite bit  service decent but food really good  pizza slices HUGE taste really good   Mom tried meatballs taste pretty impressed quality considering price  variety flavors   The big winner though pizza  price tons homemade brick oven style thin crust pizza    I am bummed moving strip though because likelihood would trip very low  Its good but isn't GOOD  <EOR> My wife ended complete accident wouldn't sad if never all   big fan Town Square feel restaurants overpriced much Strip   Meatball Spot no exception   server okay but he seemed more interested iPad way taking order actually taking order     As said accident because movie wanted see sold out   wanting waste babysitter decided grab late afternoon drink snack   $7 beer seemed 11 oz  pour wife tried play safe Sangria   Someone must playing mean joke because worst Sangria ever tasted   Sour sugary hint booze came right around $8   Awful undrinkable   For food portion decided share Apple Pecan Gorgonzola Salad pretty tasty but small paid for   then decided share 'Daily Special' Chicken Meatballs which weren't great   Three Meatballs little sauce tiny piece bread   meatballs moist but way spicy Spanish way sauce in   afternoon drink snack set back around $45 could better meal Sweet Tomatoes less half price  <EOR> I hit Meatball Spot lunch   didn't want pasta but meatball sandwich burger thought would give shot   lunch special meatball burger side parmesan fries $9 95   very good deal based pricing menu but mozzarella which added another $1 50   fries fantastic 4 star dish   Crispy full parmesan garlic flavor   don't know if would change anything them   The burger other hand huge win   bun nice soft but lost its integrity few bites burger when juices began run   ordered medium but did any pink it   Also burger dry only served ketchup side   ordered some mushroom gravy side glad did   excellent mushroom flavor but little thin side   However definitely improved burger meal overall   expected more burger which presume made into patty usual meatball mixture   I say service fantastic   Drinks served smaller type mason jars handle   order drinks extra ice filled top which like   But meant glass small drink nearly empty 3 drinks   didn't matter because server spot never close empty   Refilled very quickly without having ask   Also he overbearing trying upsell desserts anything   Excellent service    I'll probably return try sliders during happy hour   But burger did overwhelm me   saves place getting 2 stars fries service  <EOR> This review its HAPPY HOUR ONLY   It's nice watering SPOT Happy Hour over drinks bar food dishes $3 each  Its happy hour menu limited however   YELPIER DETAILS Happy Hours 2 30 5 30 9pm close M F  This establishment large inviting covered patio section  pretty spacious dining area attractive bar counter  its horse shoe shaped bar counter which eye pleasing well stocked liquor shelves  Well its barstools seem bit high however  enough Sports TV all around restaurant   HAPPY HOUR FOOD DRINKS selection $3 drinks good though limited draft beer 4 choices sangaria well drinks NO special offers wine    The menu $3 bar food includes pizza slice 1 choice toping meatball slider rigatoni spaghetti [ See pic]  Guinness Kellerweissen beers Meatball slider choice meat sauce slice pizza  Beers good expected  But different ratings bar food  thin crust pizza pepperoni topping very tasty slice surprisingly large See pic   Excellent! However slider beef spicy sauce good I'd expect dish reflects namesake restaurant  meatball somehow lacked texture taste well being bit dry side  spicy sauce spicy all needed add some red pepper flakes spice up adding little Tobasco sauce would even better    EXCELLENT SERVICE Its serving staff friendly efficient  barkeep super friendly attentive  hostess very pleasant greeting potential customers entrance patiently explaining them various menus items  mgr even hostess came over chat customers asking orders later said good bye customers cheerfully departure really making customers feel welcome!   Yes back Happy Hour  think good SPOT friends especially BEFORE and or movie AMC  BUT would probably stay away beef meatball sliders  second thought $3 only though just might try other signiture meatballs would ask chef spice spicy sauce before hand    <EOR> The waiter really responsive filled drinks when empty    We then ordered half tray pizza  Wow  large tray  same time thin crust cheesy pizza   taste kind lackluster   They really don't mind if take your time seated regular table  taste so so  try meatballs next time because curious!

However 4 30PM still very busy but seated quickly   ambiance modern    But same time cozy warm   bar area huge holding 30 40 people around it   rest restaurant all tables lined around outside centerpiece bar area   The modern theme exposed ceiling slightly cliche but added some those old fashion steel stamped ceiling tiles throughout most bar area least twist     Chairs comfy but luxurious any means   My only gripe two tables pushed together wobbly   Wifey poo fixed some notebook paper purse   Our server all over great attitude friendly smile plus engaged appropriate customer small talk   hovering all    but attentive   Shout Matt S!!!  fact all employees outstanding   sure sign well managed company   Our bottle Cab served perfect temperature   sign restaurant knows they're doing!

Maybe vote future meatball flavor combination? know little something keep people coming back for  <EOR> Thought we'd try place because reputation Chef Carla Pelligrino very dissapointed   The hostess sat 5 15pm which before major Saturday night rush   Upon sitting table she notice only set silverware which she said second set  would fine but she never brought second set   server arrived shortly take drink orders   Michelob Ultra water please    menu looks great   Hope food great sounds   The waiter came back took order   friendly all   While taking order he per occupied someone something else restaurant did eye contact once    wife ordered chopped salad which listed bunch fresh veggies mix   waiter warned salad did actually come any 'salad'   No green salad just toppings   OK     sounded interesting concept but fine toppings veggies salad always great   ordered three Turkey meatballs Peanut Butter Milkshake   Still no silverware   A few passes waiter while servicing other tables he finally stopped briefly tell Michelob Ultra   OK   Bring another beer please   Another quick stop forgot type milkshake ordered    Peanut Butter  Thanks  Food delivered server   Looks good me   asked server bring second set silverware  OK  right back    The salad was    salad   Sure waiter told no 'green' salad salad but ridiculous   bowl full crispy things few    mean few    green salad items few onions few avacado few tomato   Ugh   bowl crispy stuff little dressing!  No silverware   Another waiter walks ask set   He decides pick another pre set table give because he says we're silverware    washing back house right now   Use these  OK   Admirable    The turkey meatballs good but spectacular   I'd eat them again again but I'd rather them home myself   Nothing  special calls trip back   side steamed broccoli ordered OK but much garlic most people   Meal done   waiter apologizes salad offers take if off bill   OK   nice   waiter jokes visit asks if need anything else before leave would some more crispy salad? OK  He sense humor   But unfortunately won't coming back place   forewarned service restaurant preparation horrible  food B  <EOR> The meat Balls fine   fries worst Las Vegas  Cold tasteless over priced    A C did work very well  Warm inside  Service little better poor   took almost 30 minutes order come part wrong  <EOR> I written several reviews each time go  First most people food  service rolling dice 50 50 shot  great sucks problem place  no consistency service shame  Managers walk around oblivious devoid any personal contact patrons  Carl's JR McDonald's better customer relations  Yesterday around 12 15 beginning lunch rush while table noticed owners partners whatever having construction redo meeting middle restaurant some tables did bother much constant walking floor hanging over table talking loudly taking pictures measuring things  3rd time them hovering over table and knowing going buy lunch moved another table but floated around place more then annoying  While all enjoyed food service ok but lack common sense consideration customers say least atrocious  We may back may last time referring any friends place without warning lack customer service  <EOR> It always kills write negative review when idea execution good but staff full arrogant kids brought whole thing down boat anchor  worst part when happens usually starts good idea lots enthusiasm creative menu ton money     and wonder crashes burns if ever realize self centered staff actually did them in  Such case Meatball Spot  We arrived 6 30pm 4 people hostess stand  approached chatting amongst themselves waited  waited  waited  around 2 minute mark laughable wife says Should set ourselves fire?
