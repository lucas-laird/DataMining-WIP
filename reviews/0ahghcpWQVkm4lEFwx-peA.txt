Hands down food fresh tasty! Great Atmosphere Habib feel home establishment he way sure pleased!  Jim Szott Customer Life! <EOR> Horrible  lunch no else huge restaurant space  waitress brought two menus text other pictures some dishes  list specials all Persian names    none them English descriptions  asked waitress she doesn't know  she gets guy back proceeds read names dishes but doesn't say anything dishes actually are  ended googling dishes front order decide get  arrived 12 pm place empty whole time    didn't leave until 1 30! took long prepare two plates food two people  keep signaling waitress bring pita bread because she only brought two three pieces each time  asked hot sauce she brought bottle Tabasco put table  final bill before tip $56  best part meal now know never come back here! <EOR> we 2 nights ago  shocked  food worst persian food ever had  rice uncooked small grain smelly cold  beef lole kabob old color black no spice blend  barg kabob uncooked tasteless  only good thing decoration which part menu lol  worst nightmare owner Habib he rude dirty unpredictable  He kind crazy talking himself loud  repeating Mochakeram himself  He asking food before he serve food   He getting order bringing food check  waiter waitress seemed intimidated him  allowed take tips  He charging service charge which own pocket credit card  general never recommend place anybody  Doesn't worth food specially facing angry rude unprofessional person Habib  sadddddddd <EOR> Excellent service delicious food  highly recommend anyone enjoys Persian food wants try something new <EOR> I am giving Habib's 3 5  Overall new location bigger better old place  decoration still best seen Persian restaurant  definitely enjoy your time if you're little bit open minded  I'm giving a Atmosphere 4 5 5 said earlier definitely best atmosphere seen Persian restaurant  giving 5 because think owner could included more Persian art into decor but still looks really good now  Food 3 5 read all Yelps review yes food isn't maybe your grandma cook but think some descent food  didn't feeling eat something bad  definitely ate worst this! But key note usually always order side Hummus everywhere because tell first if Hummus fresh made second gives good feeling things turn kitchen  Well Habib's unfortunately use Hummus which ok certain people but me  simple appetizer should freshly done gives nice overview rest food   reason am giving 4 5 because think still improve food presentation preparation  Service 2 5 Service tends sporadic agree  really depends if know owner if he good day etc  same time rare also exceptional service Persian restaurant  pretty much culture  Overall 3 5  would still support them  might little overpriced maybe depending you're ordering end bill $70 $80 2 persons  <EOR> I took party 6 friends co workers last week when attending tradeshow Vegas     never again!  Biggest issue bill came noticed just 30% added bill tax     yes 30%!  When asked server he said includes 18% service fee 8 1% tax     explained menu   several issues 1  Shame reading menu fine print     mistake but if reading review don't mistake   2  Why am forced leave 18% tip?  tip discretion   If server helpful can't express myself any way     3  Why listed tax ?  bet most people even see add tip top automatically!!!  stealing!  4  Now gets worse asked server if 18% service fee plus 8 1% tax adds 26 1%   why almost 30% charge?  add 8 1% bill then add 18% tip top it   effective percentage tip higher 18%   Food no special any way   am very familiar Persian food   many cities many countries   look Persian restaurants everywhere go   restaurant bad but good either   food NO WAY justifies prices charge!  chicken bones cooked well   appetizer tadig which crispy rice cooked bottom pan two kinds stew   Tadig good but enough 6 people   Stews OK but again special   Service OK   server really pleasant smiling welcoming   He rude anything but felt bothering being there   place busy   service NO WAY justified more 18% tip   But think guy didn't care because he knew he tip any way     I recommend place food service being overcharged! <EOR> We dine average 4 nights week  pricey Sin City but when found Habibs found gem   Being Persian descent know food supposed taste like  Just right spices fresh vegetables much oil    One all time favorites Ghorm?
