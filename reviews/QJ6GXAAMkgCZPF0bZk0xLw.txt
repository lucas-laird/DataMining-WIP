Ever!  glad tastes evolved  absolutely devoured it    The lamb beef gyro meat which fella mildly disappointed thinking actually pieces lamb but he still enjoyed it   am HUGE fan gyro meat next time getting one  The spanikopita delicious flavorful served large helping tzatziki     The fries good but really loved falafel!  used falafel being super brown almost burnt sides very greasy    These not   golden brown flavorful greasy all which wonder if baked?  However prepared awesome    The owners nice ask sauces talking he said looked familiar    I haven't place 6 7 years he remembered me   even if vaguely still impresses me   She super nice constantly checked making sure other patrons enjoyed everything    I really wish closer side town but perhaps monthly outing family   great job guys! <EOR> What super sweet welcoming place! owner immensely friendly helpful  He even opened Snapple because hands full baby + copious amounts baby swag  nice! The shawarma plate very good fresh onions cucumber lettuce tomato  appreciated spicy sauce being placed side could experiment different intensities the sauce side owner's idea when let know planned share meal baby   pita might fresher hummus didn't totally knock socks off but garnish fresh garlic cucumber I would love to know else hummus delish  breakfast menu piqued interest looking forward trying salmon lox another visit     Excellent customer service really left impression Baladie Café definitely keep coming back! <EOR> I craving gyro weeks place made worth wait! owners very nice attentive made wonderful suggestions  <EOR> I tried Greek food first time  regular Gyro which very good  especially loved pistachio Baklava back just it  <EOR> Two things  1 Baladie Cafe best fries ever and 2 husband wife duo manage local gem some most friendly people you'll ever meet   I loved Baladie's ever since first ate there  friend recommended quaint eatery closest thing could German Doner Kabob Las Vegas  eating Baladie's husband confirm true! love Baladie's food incredibly consistent more importantly delicious! owners Algeria just radiate warmth  wife cooks meals husband entertainingly takes orders  almost every visit witnessed owners chatting customers old friends  Sometimes give hugs too!
