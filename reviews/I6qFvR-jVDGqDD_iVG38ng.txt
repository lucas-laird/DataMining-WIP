Anyway server quick nice  seated soon walked waters came right away looked menu  Good experience! <EOR> Pho tad oily but decent nonetheless   Considering Jenni Pho some regular joe shmoe pho restaurant Chinatown soaring expectations  mediocre meal decent service bad any means but slightly disappointed   First off still NO CREDIT DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS  just don't carry cash rarely 'em me  Jenni Pho why always take trip Bank America take withdrawal $40 bucks meal? Until slowpokes update system take some cash you   Secondly service lightning fast which many pho eaters may accustomed other venues  ask extra napkins because there's no dispenser table only give two napkins each person start with  tables middle terribly small joke there's four chairs around them because crammed tuna three people   The pho pretty oily  reason why liked Jenni Pho Rainbow because broth usually very clean less oily  pho location just tasted very thick saturated unnecessary flavor   Overall pretty mediocre meal  know better time because new  sure Jenni whoever charge straighten things eventually  HEY JENNI UPDATE YOUR SYSTEMS ACCEPT DEBIT CARDS OK?!! Geez  <EOR> No service  Slow service  Bad customer service  ordered beef stew pho  Broth no taste  beed no taste vegetable  complained server respond is beef stew serve don't know want do  asked exchange something else  response don't that  left no tip  Horrible experience! <EOR> Came Jenni Pho when visited Vegas boyfriend also came family past when visited Vegas!

Deliciosio  <EOR> My wife discovered pho 4 years ago Atlantic City   Since then I we eating fairly regularly   Am pho expert absolutely not   However eaten enough know good vs bad   Jenni pho very good pho humble estimation   Was Vegas son's 21st birthday he never experienced pho before figured he needed pop pho cherry   Saw billboard jenni pho decided give place try   Waiter figured flank steak pretty safe bet first timer seafood  Also spring rolls appetizer   Standard spring rolls good best worst  pho first all comes HOT hotter others tried   Gentleman works explained heat bowls just before put broth extra hot  noticed other patrons eating right away but opted let cool bit broth above average very flavorful bland any stretch imagination   meat son's very tasty cooked just right   seafood fish shrimp squid   fish awesome shrimp good squid best  note favorite seafood pho Houston scallops measure against that    sets pho jenni apart rest amount quality noodles   Many times pho find myself wishing more noodles   Jenni's most noodles ever pho   made heartier more filling dish   filling fact couldn't finish bowls   Very good value very tasty   So why choose jenni pho over others?  Service!!!  Granted very late night weren't really busy but far BEST friendliest service ever experienced any place serves pho   Everyone super nice helpful friendly   End result if looking above average pho very good value exceptional service then Jenni pho deserves shot  <EOR> Big filling warming bowls pho   I liked lot tea good also  waiter nice he built little plates favorite sauce combos  Super clean dining area bathroom  would back but try other pho places compare beforehand  <EOR> The pho disappointing  lacks flavor  savory all  barely taste star anise key ingredients pho  Other flavors also light missing  But bowl does lots meat  But quantity does lack quality    The chicken lemongrass traditional Vietnamese either  meat deep fried instead stir fried  Even though taste lemongrass find meat hard dry    The crispy chicken wings good although traditional Vietnamese    The service standard Vietnamese Oriental polite fast efficient but no smile  <EOR> Very flavorful food  rare beef pho which tasty broth redolent star anise   Service needs improvement though   waiter seemed he'd rather anywhere but here   Also he did bring table salad pho   ask time arrived halfway done meal   hard plate some bean sprouts basil jalapeño lime?  probably return hopefully service improve  <EOR> This place always seats properly never waiting way less packed then pho Kim long honestly better your pho comes very warm n cooked well delicious broth waiters all sweet pho place rate 5 because never ever bad experience good food well customer service came all time   <EOR> Average food awful service  guess two stars generous   I stopped few friends insisted having pho last week  Personally huge fan pho all tastes same me thus if think bad its probably absolutely awful everyone else  Unfortunately Jenni broth surprisingly bland noodles average skimped meat   load pho sriracha compensate flavorless broth  rare beef pho seemed low quality luncheon meat didn't even add much in    Service disaster start finish  only saw server when ordered when she dropped off check  Good luck trying attention if need something else  $20 minimum use credit card total BS  Hopefully never forced come again  <EOR> I never any complaints location whenever come by  recommended place pho if you're area    I hardly ever deviate getting pho when pho place but few times rice dishes haven't disappointed  personally am fan broken rice because small grains find them easier chew more enjoyable  pork chicken cooked fairly well good amount flavor each bite  pho itself nothing ordinary  noodles good meat good broth good more want?  The restaurant itself feels very clean orderly  Pho 1 food good well but everything always feels disorderly just feels could bit cleaner Jenni Pho doesn't problem    I'm loyal any pho place Las Vegas but Jenni Pho definitely added pool pho places city  <EOR> Pho savior those long mostly blurry nights strip ton places near Chinatown your beef broth power another night debauchery   Although others may seem more popular think Jenni Pho better ones   First all owner super clever name   Already kudos that   Second even if hung over drunk can't deny place cleaner other pho restaurant around area  May huge priority when trying oh yummy beef broth mouth into your belly but better safe sorry   Jenni Pho's pho actually pretty good  usual Vegas prices least aren't paying premium comparison   Also broth pretty legit right amount spices herbs  soup comes hot which always must when pho   Next meat noodle ratio pretty good  aren't feeling paid $10 bowl pho khong pho noodle soup   actually some meat! hungry look super size bowl sharesies friend   All all Jenni Pho hits spot when looking some good noodle soup  place clean parking simple location prime literally blocks away other pho places  Why somewhere else wait then come seated immediately same quality if better food   Also if aren't mood pho also vermicelli rice plates other noodle soup dishes such bun bo hue bun rieu bun rieu oc  <EOR> Came soft opening offering free entree drink different times during three day soft opening before actual Grand Opening  Tuesday night right before opening class around 4 20 no really around but time opened 5 line leading parking lot  when left parking lot full still long line out  Everyone loves free food!
