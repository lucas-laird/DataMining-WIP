Then two shared fajita side bean burrito bill 75 00 plus tip! dinner good but drinks rediculouse  Why try fortune alcohol because going good time  Hey maybe rent high drinks? If want people stay spend more money lower your prices stronger drinks! dinner average  <EOR> I just left Vegas all think Chicken Tortilla Soup dinner night before left   back end September already know dining again!  Business myself   love having option sitting bar where cooking prep done rather table myself  dining experience much more enjoyable     The Chicken Tortilla Soup wasn't spicy just enough  I don't want hot burns taste buds but want bit bite  If spicier tower hot sauces pick from   loved served it   broth cooked separate served separately   chicken veggies including chunks fresh avocado served together   They're combined your seat server any remaining broth left its serving dish added eat   tortilla strips served separately add yourself  no soggy strips!!  grilled lime julienne radish serve condiments add your taste   EXCELLENT!!!  I also craving Guac!  Again unique experience   brought basic avocado garlic lime concoction along separate plate containing chopped onion chopped cilantro chopped jalopeno julienne radish   decide want add much server creates final mix right front you   Very good!  freshness doing way but flavors don't enough time meld   imagine Guac would even tastier couple hours if actually any left!  Which didn't   This filling meal delicious!!  entrees saw all looked great huge platters   I'd recommend sharing everything lots flavors   Another diner admitted he wife shared guac each bowl Chicken Tortilla Soup   time entree served he full   forewarned!  The Service outstanding!  ran into bit issue trying charge bill room but Server above beyond resolve issue happen!!   I've eaten Guy Fieri's Johnny Garlics restaurants  mediocre food overpriced  so wasn't expecting meal experience did   pleasant surprise!

The trash stuffed chips soaked liquid cheese colored stuff then lightly sprinkled diced tomatoes short spritz sour cream sauce   Since all packed into tin only top surface gets smattering toppings   Beans say?

Vegas restaurant bar reservation system place extend your bar service people waiting line enjoy some cocktails  waited 25 minutes which fine but could time could gone much faster reservation ability grab drink two while line  Perhaps vibe you're looking but watched many people walk away short time line  <EOR> This big let down  food looks great but bland Margaritas worth money   We order chips salsa  red sauce more spaghetti sauce verde hopes spice none    Got jalapeño poppers might spicy but can't taste them due super thick breading    Fajitas beef eatable but no favor  vegetables where cooked all amount sour cream laughable  might well include all  Chili's better fajitas    $101 later    still hungry  <EOR> We tried Great Place fall when Real Estate Convention loved it!!

She sweet helpful fun! would again just Gracie serve us! <EOR> The food neither good really bad  bland tasteless  Devoid texture flavor all mashes together into some nearly unrecognizable homily frozen vegetables poor quality generically seasoned meat  Vegas deserves better  <EOR> It's Guy Fierri joint let's front  Don't expect greatness  Expect unappetizing names entrees atmosphere Mexican Ed Hardy store   I ordered Chicken Trash Nachos  horror arrived tin can  waiter then removed leaving jumbled pile appeared food waste plate  must say Trash Nachos apt   The Habenero Margarita watery would expect mayor Flavortown    At $35 plate trash watery marg   I feel violated  being said bad option beer before seeing Penn Teller  <EOR> Ambiance nice fun quirky no wait times  Very nice accommodating server  Food pretty basic good Mexican nothing really stood out  Portions really big plates small hold them things falling off plate   Probably would  return but if you're rush catch show want some decent Mexican food may good stop  <EOR> I very disappointed  Super slow service busy all! all ordered borracha beans horrible gas afterwards  Didn't expect beans really taste bottle beer  <EOR> The food great service Gracie exceptional  She very friendly very accommodating requests   She definitely keeper  <EOR> Food great! am verge blowing chunks but  only because ate wayyyyy much  really hard stop hence why didn't stop am now paying ultimate price lol <EOR> Price kinda high get  good but really any different El Torito Chevys  Actually think El Torito better  street corn which ok but wouldn't order again  chips guacamole bland chips strange texture  added salt 4 lime wedges  also Lava Shrimp tacos just ok too  much flavor either  $57 only entree  super disappointed because love Guys show <EOR> Came dinner during conference    Food fajita carne asada very tender flavorful  Check yelp free chips salsa  4 5 food  friend churro which very warm soft perfect balance sweetness    Service amazing service waitress Carolina  She full energy super friendly  Made dining experience very enjoyable  5 5 Carolina  <EOR> Checked place convenient Bonhams motorcycle auction  food excellent Mexican food grew Tucson  Reasonable prices combined great food service  <EOR> Didn't even table Hostesses pick choose want seat first  SMH <EOR> First ever trip Vegas  pick restaurant due being very close resort limited time  signs say close pool    but knowing where pool did entire tour main floor  No problem super cool atmosphere    seated promptly wasn't crowded  But waitress all tables last room interfered current flow  Waited until she cashed two table before she took order   Ordered chips salsa free when checking into yelp  probably best chips salsa had  maybe first taste carbs since being restrictive Keto diet  Then ordered quesadilla add steak  OMG!!! Yum city   ordered kids chicken quesadilla husband ordered steak burrito just steak cheese  amount steak kept happy quesadilla more then enough kids share    which did    also ordered coronarita  good l best ever but good    Thanks experience  <EOR> I hesitate place bc Guy Fieri's name being associated it  Don't wrong love show totally envy but he tends corny am fan authentic Mexican more now it  But completely wasted Drais ordered chicken tortilla soup steak taco some fundido  fundido wasn't really best but remember loving chips  really good thick too! ate steak taco 4 bites didn't picture but sure okay  soup favorite  Perfectly seasoned really wanted just drink whole bowl    would loved more cheese but  personal preference  saw infamous trash nachos but no table ordered them  Service seemed really quick nice considering post pool party lol      If stay Rio Hotel again would back  <EOR> I didn't realize could hate restaurant much until now  place simply sucks! staff food management everything  server Peggy didnt understand server customer dynamic  Most time spent telling couldnt far away table  end dinner she told because large party couldn't split bill  large party consisted 4 adults 4 children all under 11 2 them didn't even eat  When finished asked split bill she argued telling no insisting hostess explained policy when seated  When asked if did happen when should gotten left? She gave dirty look walked away  She also added 20% gratuity terrible service when enough  told am going sit back let rip off automatically applied tip  told own plates when food arrived own place settings  find hot sauce asked when she never showed back either  told considering service wanted decide own tip would be  told take 2 credit cards take them manager manager come speak me  manager refused speak but did split bill  anxious forget place didnt notice until left she split bill 20% it  far am concerned Peggy liar swindler manager inept restaurant might well closed  food all tastes processed can  swear chicken fajitas made form canned chicken  AWFUL! Stick buffet Rio nice dinner scene but food much better sadly buffet service considerably better yet another failure Guy Fieri! <EOR> The food nothing special  really didn't expect condition place  entire bar counter mess  Looks hasn't wiped down couple hours  menu food stains all over it  Very sloppy  Kind dive although triple D   food didn't suck but nothing above crap 1 4 price your local Mexican joint  Mexican corn cob incredibly over cooked queso fundito dip did work  cheddar all stayed top  sure where cheddar even belongs Mexican food  Don't bother wasting your money here  Sloppy mediocre  <EOR> Yuck! Save your money!  food mediocre best    trash nachos should gone garbage   Cute concept but tasted bowl salt velveeta  No creativity flavors all   overpriced bowl chips cheese  We also wonton shrimp tacos   disappointment     Tasted lot oil few bay shrimp      Either chef gotten big britches clueless staff did poor job  <EOR> Wow! Vegas open 430     okay   so dinner stop serving regular menu 830 due slow business   I thought city didn't sleep   crock   sorry guy W ont back   even 11 dollar margarita sucked <EOR> Michelle server  She totally rocked! great attitude pleasure waited her  food good wife kids liked decor  come back next trip  <EOR> I excited come idol food places first time somewhat disappointed fish tacos amazing enchiladas ok tortilla thick killed expectations wat pork fried carnitas dry overcooked kno should Guy where recipe idea from  but luv atmosphere beautiful great customer service  I'll back try other things bought book super dope <EOR> My family week ago sisters birthday  line short but took 20 mins in  When seated lot empty tables  understaffed thought making line would look popular  sister both ordered drinks nachos share  drinks great  She hated ordered another finished 1 changed water  nachos cool looking but great either  Very dry nacho cheese didn't taste great  Some cops very chewy well  mom fajitas enjoyed them  dad husband taco Tuesday deal  enjoyed most tacos since unlimited $30 lot  both agreed return tacos but sister both didn't drinks nachos  also brought dessert birthday wasn't good either   personally most likely never back  didn't feel food worth price  lot other restaurants strip same price  <EOR> We amazing service Manny food very delicious!  ambiance nice spacious very clean   choose place because super hungry just happened right place right time!

Sal manager awesome keeping all entertained line checked seated well  He much fun!   We ordered chicken fajitas pineapple habanero margaritas  delicious!  fresh! flavor which concerned reading other reviews !  It's your regular authentic Mexican food different take classics but flavors all work really well  <EOR> Had carne asada platter chips guac  Guac almost flavorless very disappointing  Platter ok nothing amazing expensive very basic  taste  <EOR> Bad food taste !!! Tortilla soup very salty no sour cream if want $ 3 00 little porción Acapulco salad add chicken $4 00  saw little porción then music metalic rock then fajitas bad flavor <EOR> Been few times last experience returning  Food decent just steep prices amount food  returning  <EOR> Overpriced  Blah  Terrible service   just three initial things come mind when think experience place  First off set bar hostess said back packed  False  Next waited 20 mins server come table ended ask hostess find us  Then Manuel came table acted inconvenience wait on  a party 3 ordered 2 entrees grilled street corn chips salsa order Garbage Nachos  Everything bland  cream corn tasted old which never good sign when talking dairy  Also chips nachos soggy! Right served disgusting  Also waiter never came back check table until flagged down check  Beyond hideous  <EOR> The Trashcan Nachos big hit   really enjoyed service   restaurant nice but such corporate franchised feeling  wish same type food but unique Las Vegas atmosphere   However recommend try it  <EOR> I would recommend coming drinks free chips salsa before Penn Teller show! Located kiddie corner entrance easy pit stop    I ordered Tattooed Mojito which essentially regular Mojito blackberry GOOD  fiancé Frozen Horchata drink which waaaaay boozy  sure if heavy handed figured would love if they're supposed made way but couldn't even finish 1 2 between two us  No bueno    The free chips salsa check in came pretty generous portion  salsa muy caliente chips more tortilla strips    Overall a okay! If ever stop see Penn Teller show again would gladly stop too  <EOR> I always walked but never walked because just assumed just overpriced celebrity chef restaurant Vegas  Today feeling tired burgers Asian food decided try instead take chances  also saw yelp check in special free chips salsa  Free can't bad right  Before walking asked front hostess Nicole if could see menu  She happily walked through menu describing she thought good helped try figure wanted order  thought great took time instead just handing menu  followed inside seated next window voodoo outdoor pool  nice view front where sat  Soon being seated waitress Rochelle came take order  She saw yelp made sure free chips salsa  also ordered table side guacamole  Both appetizers good couldn't stop eating them salsa guacamole great chips   planning order carnitas chimichanga but saw another guy next table huge! thought myself no way even half that  changed mind ordered carnitas enchiladas verde   good choice came 3 enchiladas which delicious  bite finishing entree but stomach said no more couldn't finish  happily surprised served great tasting food along great service  appreciated Rochelle Nicole's service because made dining experience memorable definitely back again because that! <EOR> This place SUX!!!! Save your money seriously   Guy Fieri must know good food tastes name attached place he no clue they're serving garbage     I ordered Rock Shrimp tacos which big mistake   shrimp cocktail sized shrimp chewy bland batter    can't believe even ate them just didn't want offend person took there     My friend Carne Asada plate which super chewy well   mention $25   rice mush something you'd expect campfire where little flavors ones disposal     And worst part IMO watching prep chef throw food into mouth entire time sat ate   no shame game  sure   find unsanitary unprofessional   He wearing blue protective gloves just popping things into mouth throughout night   gross    keep mind open kitchen!!!

Food drinks really good!! bartender made night!!! If u ever check place sure u ask Jerika!!! Best bartender books!! <EOR> Came pool party straight Happy Hour  couldn't drink anymore already feeling tired but definitely enjoyed Trash Nachos $8 00! added carne asada which think another $5 00 but worth it!  Service quick well! <EOR> Very disappointed! hours website clearly state open everyday 4 00pm 11 00pm  arrived restaurant 9 30pm doors opened however stated couldn't let because closed  paid cab over just visit restaurant because no longer free shuttle only door say closed when still people restaurant  Most people rely Internet when visiting places vacation change hours absurd  returning place which shame because food good but refusing serve someone when your hours clearly state open till 11 00 just wrong would rather give money other establishments  <EOR> We patronized restaurant early evening Saturday 7 2 opening 5pm dinner  nervous wait times due being line but all sat simultaneously  problem waiting 10 minutes put drink order but understood gave benefit doubt  also service industry  apologized made rest experience quick efficient    First start drinks  Yum! husband ordered pineapple habanero margarita Cadillac margarita  pineapple habanero fantastic! Sweet slightly smokey little kick end  would definitely drink again  cadillac good but just your basic Cadillac margarita  No complaints tasted just should orange garnish  Only complaint drinks price  Its served standard martini sized Cabo glass huge $15 each  stopped each because couldn't justify spending $60 drinks alone  Bummer  Would loved another round    Now food  Omg! better expecting  Orange County CA where Mexican food top notch  par being full service restaurant  Usually full restaurants skimp somewhere details  place does not! complimentary chips salsa start fantastic  chips fresh seasoned perfectly balanced spice blend slightly spicy sweet salsa  entree ordered machaca enchiladas moist flavorful perfect kick spice end  think smothered mole type sauce but could wrong  all worked well together cheesy! Yum! Brown rice standard course! beans perfect compliment side  able take half home enjoy later   husband asada burrito almost jealous didn't that  ended sharing everything! tortilla used tasted house made perfectly flaky grilled outside  Inside some most perfectly marinated spiced steak loooooong time  stuffed along side marinated sautéed believe cabbage which might sound weird but perfect texture compliment meat tortilla  He pico side he's lame lol but nice addition all mixed together  Now step son joined extremely picky food  tried    He doesn't budge  didn't simplified kids menu which bummer because usually cater simpler palettes  However server more happy accommodate him  just steak bean cheese burrito  afraid he going think steak much but he ate whole thing happy  Thankful that! hard taking picky eaters out  all half meal leftover later! Great portions sizes!  The experience whole great  ambiance restaurant nice  view people enjoying pool  also being able watch cooks action line open air presentation whole restaurant  tucked back most  only docked star pricing  famous chefs restaurant but also Rio which isn't fancy any means off strip  would loved appetizers trash nachos which looked fab but again could justify tacking another $18 plus $4+ meat add bill  bill three entrees two cocktails soda $103 before tip  tad high opinion but least food delicious redeemed problem    Overall hubby plan back! But next time might share entree app use extra money those extra two yummy margaritas! frequent even more we're locals if adopt good happy hour something! locals discount? Thanks yummy food Guy!

Also servers keep eye those dining course meal better   If soup hot very careful going take longer eat   isn't rocket science   diner should never appetizer interrupted arrival main course unless they've dawdled which assure wasn't   Note locals El Burro Borracho gives 25% discount when show them your Nevada driver's license   Strip plus Fieri pricing much more tolerable   The meal OK may back   many other places  cheaper more authentic  in town try many those before considering return visit  <EOR> Delicious!! place awesome decor wonderful food tasted good  wait staff knows gluten sensitivity means she even asked if sensitive full blown celiac which quite impressive! fish tacos delicious breaded  pay chips salsa but good amount chips salsa very good  Wonderful place! <EOR> Mediocre best  If want spicy salsa costs $4    Great food if think Mexican no flavor  Loud music slow service ordinary food    This turned off any restaurant name  <EOR> was Looking forward eating favorite food critic tv show  Rio casino burro borracho but closed early afternoon    c'mon  Guy cantina stilled closed early morning?

As far food      MEHHHHH      couldn't wait try those infamous Trash Nachos circulate all over FB   entire production those towering layers cheesy goodness could wrong right? WRONG!!!  Those far worse nachos ever had!!!  fact tried them 3 times before threw towel said just couldn't anymore   cheese isn't cheese some sort Velveeta floury sauce blend even near cheaply tasting nacho sauce   Wasn't good all!  Normally decent chips decent nacho sauce decent nacho but OMG sauce made nachos tasteless   veggies black beans did nothing disaster   DISAPPOINTED!!!  The chips aren't bad but basic red molcajete salsa bland!  could've tried other salsas extra $4 if wanted but figured I'd stick $3 chips salsa   BTW never paid chips salsa before Mexican restaurant     The taco's okay gringo version tacos   When came down $55 unlimited top shelve margaritas worth Taco Tuesday deal   food certainly $34 horrific nachos!!!

I going write great review until checked bank account saw tried rip off!!!!  I three separate charges card  original price $68 duplicate $68 then huge $240  Tried call them three times kept getting automated response didn't voicemail box  Contacted bank alerted them card fraud!!!  I've never ripped off restaurant before  <EOR> Came first time Father's Day 2018  debated size trash nachos opted large order without beans  also ordered guacamole basic blended margarita  server pleasant but very busy didn't see much  All food delicious but should ordered small nachos since just two chips soft very quickly  margarita great! All all good meal  <EOR> Had nice friendly service Kevin Pedro Sal   unlimited chips salsa great  fish tacos pretty good but heard shrimp better  <EOR> Sad say place overhyped!! excited being many videos Facebook showing those trash nachos guess left super high expectations    The restaurant located Rio Hotel pretty far off strip  unless car expect Uber most likely because walk brutal during those super cold windy Vegas nights extremely hot summers  Fortunately ubers Vegas seem flat rate around $8 which isn't bad all  Once arrived restaurant already line outside entrance which expected given prime dinner time around 7pm Saturday night  Fortunately line moved fairly fast weren't waiting long  Once hostess promptly seated  decor inside pretty cool pretty view pool nearby    Our server awesome didn't wait long all food  She even waited take pictures nachos before she took off them super cool saying everyone does it    The chips table actually super good way better your typical free table chips taste stale flavourless   actually tasted fresh full really good spice top  salsa also delicious! also ordered sangria but probably WORST sangria ever had  honestly super bitter assuming ratio alcohol off  sangria Spain Cuba Puerto Rico familiar proper should taste definitely lacking    TRASH NACHOS VERDICT 3 5  Okay basically piece de resistance Guy Fieri's restaurant trash nachos  didn't come unless ordered them  First thing note serving size super deceiving  look super tiny but reality probably fit good 4 5 people dinner meal  only two basically take more half home  price around 20$ which totally worth when think amount food you're getting  Honestly though while concept brilliant really does sure every chip bit topping just didn't me  Being spoilt good Mexican food LA nachos just didn't authentic taste regular nachos LA  even lacked guac which probably most important ingredient nachos if ask me  Don't wrong ingredients made definitely fresh overall delicious but just seemed overly americanised tex mex more anything  yes well aware nachos aren't even really Mexican but Mexicans LA just know them much better real carne asada some fresh guac over them So being said still think super overhyped but fair say should give try your own judge yourself! <EOR> Really 4 5 but 5 because overall experience   Just left Mexico few days ago ate Fieri's restaurant Cancun airport Guy Fieri's Kitchen Bar  some pretty good hot wings know TV shows why give joint shot   Was already staying Rio Hotel Casino just short walk through casino restaurant   Chose sit bar located adjacent cooking stations  Always love restaurants which kind seating  Allows watch everything kitchen prep cooking plating  Spent leisurely hour half eating enjoying show kitchen  definite 10 aspect restaurant!  Service great   Atmosphere seemed nice throughout restaurant but choice staring stainless steel kitchen  Once again excellent show watch kitchen   Complimentary chips salsa brought drinks  Great flavor chips salsa very good love charred tomatoes fresh garlic!  So many items menu looked great  Could've eaten least ten different things which sounded good   After chips salsa chose split dish  Chose Picadillo Tacos which incredible flavor every bite  lot going those three little tacos   Was told borracho beans lard them if worked me  very tasty   Cilantro lime rice Guy would say point! say would nice if would allow mixed plate tacos because many if them sounded great when reading menu  Love sampler type plate!  Would definitely return  Overall experience solid 9! <EOR> So experience Guy Fieri's El Burro Borracho may slightly unique  boyfriend found ourselves prior attending Penn Teller show Rio  expected shuttle take hotel over Rio running late night  found ourselves unfortunate situation having inform server running late needed food ready eaten quickly possible    Despite less ideal situation however El Burro Borracho able deliver  in terms both fast service food quality  sat down began eating complimentary tortilla chips which thicker normal highly seasoned very crunchy  then ordered enchilada platter chimichanga which arrived very swiftly tasted delicious  Although doubts considering neither huge fan Guy Fieri Food Network personality food really did transport flavor town  fact type enchiladas ordered usually don't even but sauce lime infused fresh delicious  boyfriend also expressed chimichanga delicious course couldn't help but notice giant even chimichanga!     While prices standard Las Vegas strip fare $15 20 meal only comes rice beans can't deny received great service great food  main regret did time indulge margarita some sangria  Also because restaurant very large expect wait seated even if only 5 10 minute wait  <EOR> YUM! good  didn't expect much because fan Guy Fieri food mom shared cheese fondue guacamole lobster <EOR> Our waitress Jeanette Hawaii PHENOMONAL!!!! She friendly helpful awesome fast service!! tried trash nachos awesome!! <EOR> Had flight reposado Tequilas chili Verde burrito very good tortilla soup very tasty  <EOR> We great time restaurant! Sal manager Peggy waitress very personable attentive fun  food margarita's delicious  Highly recommended! <EOR> Loved place staff very friendly informative food great a bit pricey all all great experence!!! <EOR> It's hard believe Guy put name place!!! am only giving second star because server really nice young man felt truly sorry he believed food coming kitchen good  came Saturday 4 2 16 supposedly night before grand opening public where man himself Guy there  told would 30 minute wait however most other reviews no pagers intercoms notify took seat chair behind hostess stand  noticed many open tables place wondered why wait begin with  watched many other people come put name in  three other party's came one party seven sat within 10 minutes putting names furious! hostess then notified could sit bar where full menu  Now worked industry nearly 10 years if true wait where place full could given option right away before allowing sit 30 minutes  husband then intervene pointing all people sat before came did hostess just looked she popped few many pills  young man then came would server begging front seat him  restaurant half empty when back yet telling people 30 minutes!    Now food Guy joking right?!!? Flavor town? Did leave behind when came Vegas? Everything ordered bland  ordered rock shrimp tacos crispy shrimp mushy server suggested put lime over everything bring flavor  First off lime which put grill dried no juice left if put lime over everything enhance flavor run because probably isn't any begin with  husband ordered overly priced $18 strip burgers which expect over priced being locals eating strip but damn bad   Yuca fries dried when husband asked some sort sauce mask taste server said recommended chef eat them plain  Ya no thank needs sauce just bite into them because dried hard   beans rice came along dish no flavor  appetizer which some ceviche taco 3 them $15 just tasted straight lime juice hard overly salted shell   All all appetizer soda two main dishes totaled over $60 including husband's beer while patiently waiting table  Save yourself trouble ding your wallet head over Flaming Fajitas off Tropicana Fort Apache! Maybe spoiled growing Southern CA but Guy travel better places eat your show then your own place stuck your name on  Your eatery hundreds miles way flavor town  <EOR> This place sucked!!!! Super disappointed service great food trash!!!

Expectations WAY exceeded  Jalapeño infused Caliente margaritas start   perfect heat but nice smooth  Chips salsa zesty  wife mango jicima salad loved it  vegetarian Tacos outstanding   smokey full flavor  son devoured fish tacos  full dessert  Service outstanding  sure ask Violeta  She lovely   very friendly attentive made good suggestions  Best experience ever Guy's restaurants  Can't wait come back  Definitely worth cab ride! <EOR> We apprehensive at best even resistant at worst Guy Fieri restaurant but REALLY GOOD!

When arrived greeters wonderful  told them party 6 when would leave check table another person would come asked if helped     The lady sat wonderful   she made suggestions very friendly   Then met server  waited 5 min till server came over  She finally did  and told wanted Trash Nachos Carne Asada   didn't see again 10 min   and never asked if wanted anything drink  flag down order one  barely saw finally ordered food no refills water ask another server for  saw when wanted order dessert bill  part group discount wristband   where supposed 15% off bill   she said only 10% off personal entree  She very rude it   Now    for best part   the food   Trash Nachos amazing!!!! 6 still didn't finish them   huge portion!!! husband shared carne asada shrimp fajitas  which also very good although didn't take tails off shrimp   dessert ice cream nachos   very tasty!!!   So food 5 stars Greeters 5 stars Service 1 star since she did order right  <EOR> Fantastic meal awesome attentive service all flavors flavor town  We started chips poppers  love dusting spices chips poppers dang best ever had  Stuffed cheese chorizo spicy    only downside margaritas  Ordered three all three prepared differently  jalapeño another stronger cilantro no jalapeño third much ice   The food totally made drinks  server awesome constantly checking in   lol  Forward return trip <EOR> The first thing note NO SIGN restaurant   further confuse things staff refers everything everywhere restaurant 'flavortown' clearly Guy catch phrase   You'll also notice staff nearly poor Guy impression through your stay giving 'hey cool relaxed place HIP' vibe only genuine all   neurotic Guy he imposes personality staff?      The food actually quite pleasant! two Mexican infused burgers guac truly great   would eat again recommend!  only downside food chips they're stale hard flavorless   If didn't need vessel delicious guac would avoided them all costs   The wait staff somewhat toss here   waiter Ok speedy stayed top things     However management clueless   During entire meal general manager bar manager hosted vendor Shane selling drink infusing gimmick could start making Mules bar he loud right next couldn't even hold conversation   bar manager even asked point when pointed she responded oh cool yeah we're trying Mules hardly appropriate response complaint   You'd think would business deals host sales events outside operating hours     Overall would give food 4 atmosphere 2 staff 2 5   short order your food go  <EOR> Hey Everyone    Salsa Tim Salsaking Arizona 1996 2010      Having opened worked several Mexican Food concepts restaurants expected more restaurant  three star rating service lacked some food items ordered very bland especially Mexican food     experience     We arrived restaurant inside Rio Hotel Resort around 6 15pm Sunday  greeted nice hostess wrote name notebook said would 15 mins    While waited admired Chef's jarred salsa publishings  wife owned Salsa business several years before selling 2010 www salsatimoteo com     name called second hostess wasn't personable but she explained Fieri Swag Tequila bar      Once sat greeted Lada     Very personable lovely little lady    She said call Enchilada very cute    Having owned Salsa Biz ordered Salsa Verde Habanero salsas try $4 2 3 ounces sauce small dish    salsa complimentary first basket chips tasty as well 2 salsas ordered     time ordering salsas wife ordered Mango Mojito Pepsi   Took 11 mins Mojito no kidding     wife said drink very tasty despite wait     On dinner    wife Picadillo Street Tacos   The meat very bland almost flavorless other disappointing part used pre formed hard taco shells street tacos     Pretty disappointing used Arizona    I Pork Green Chile Enchiladas Pozole I love Pozole     enchiladas presented warm best    Plate warm which may Guy's style but sue helps quality    Pork Green Chili tender decent flavor but where Chile??? Definitely enough Green Chile recipe    Tomatillo sauce ok too    Didn't wow all    Pozole 2 3 stars too   Again enough flavor Chile not heat chile but flavor chile     When eat Pozole broth should stain lips when use napkin wipes chile red     Again disappointing     With prices being charged food $5 Pepsi would expect better service much better food!!  Definitely underwhelmed would happy help Guy some Restaurant visits Arizona    even some original old Skool recipes amazing!! <EOR> Really enjoyed Fajitas huge portion sizes   Habenero Margarita glorious just right balance sweet spicy  Jaennette super nice! <EOR> The tacos high quality delicious  also tried nachos Appetizers section menu guacamole excellent   Highly recommend stop Rio  <EOR> I high hopes restaurant given Guy Fieri Food Network  He must know everything Mexican food he's tried many them all across national  But something totally lacking restaurant which felt great reputation celebrity    Honestly if wanted similar food affordable price would Roberto's  girlfriend burrito costs $21 which did justice flavor  Remember guys just because expensive doesn't mean delicious  learned hard way last night when found myself paying lot money mediocre food  chicken mole enchilada which started off delicious but lost its touch halfway  sure worked out  Maybe lacked seasoning? Nothing memorable entree attest better  very basic say least    For appetizer jalapeño poppers which thought going Gordon Ramsay's BURGR  wrong  breaded just tell sitting fryer wayyyyy long  fan because bland    The service great but looked she busy tending other people  felt sorry seeing running around she made sure everyone happy  Towards end meal she took while which understandable    After meal decided dessert even though bread pudding sounded delicious  really just didn't want disappointed anymore    Now just buyer's remorse  Don't me just Smash Burger  <EOR>
