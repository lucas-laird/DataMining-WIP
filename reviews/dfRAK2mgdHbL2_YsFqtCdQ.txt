I reviewed once yelp removed because said didn't include first hand experience   here's review first hand experience   there   and filthy dump  <EOR> I've meaning write review place quite some time seeing frequent saloon often when see bands perform   I give place 'one star' because well   it's horrible    The drinks some worst drinks ever consumed  ordered long island syrup water  disgusting  don't great beer selection any means unless favor more commercial pisswaters such bud bud light bud extra light   lime? Anyway     When bands play live sound system don't them any justice  Pentagram played recently even Bobby Liebling complained quite few times during set  Every band come see complain horrible sound system endure  way handle shows greatest promoting amount charge sound  venue thee worst possible place band play   Besides place being ghetto styled dirty cesspool would never come willingly if weren't bands no other choice but to  <EOR> Awesome local bands great prices drinks  <EOR> Place seen better days but least they've upgraded sound system  <EOR> While am big fan dive bar scene good place catch local show   friend's hubby band frequently perform came two shows     Wow bar roomy!  am used cramped dive bars but place quite large lots room even away concert floor    couple pool tables couple arcade games though those tend blocked engineering booth during live shows   pit front stage which acts concert floor    can't comment drinks since both times came sober driver   The sound crisp clear while smaller music venue audio never feels going blow your eardrums South America   If stand near bar pool tables even reasonably audible conversation   Shows cover but prices very reasonable often presale tickets less if know anyone bands   I large pet peeve shows venue never start time!  effectively dubbed Cheyenne Saloon time all shows start hour scheduled start time   second time came friend's band third lineup first band started just 10 PM   eventually 1 morning then all burnt just wanted home the second band awful stage hour compared most other bands play around 30 mins    Please start time!  Secondly since wasn't drinking alcohol wanted energy drink   didn't Red Bull but some generic brand never heard of   still cost five six bucks!  kidding me?  Some domestic beer costs less even Red Bull!  Non alcoholic drinks SHOULD cost much import brew   harder want DD le sigh   By way someone scratched passage Book Revelation bathroom filled typos    annoying English major fix it!  Personally don't watching concerts bars preferring exclusively music venue Farm but still good place catch show probably find myself coming again other shows   PROS Big roomy dive bar Clear audio doesn't sound loud distorted    Good setup shows  CONS Generic energy drinks pricey DD! You'll come smelling human sized Malboro Shows start late!    THE VERDICT Good live music venue but favorite mine   occasionally come back  <EOR> My first review start place familiar with    The only time Cheyenne Saloon shows particularly underground metal shows  During time 2 1 2 years seen performances Sadistic Intent Monstrosity Master Vital Remains Dreaming Dead Goreaphobia Deceased Gravehill Diabolic    all which well respected metal community  Now back review    I think place perfect shows  Personally bar setting shows  also fan stage being close entrance case Cheyenne  sure bar prices because don't drink when going just when drink more congregate parking fellow show goers store bought beer  bouncers pretty laid back critical when place gets rowdy front    My only gripe place smoke pool tables  place gets pretty smokey your clothes stink wards  pool tables could use some leveling  would comment bathrooms but really expect nice bathroom any bar type shows?   Words advice  Bring your ID carded    So if see show town want check don't hesitate check place out  <EOR> Awesome Shows Now cheap drinks Friendly staff  Bad part all way  North Las Vegas  Far! <EOR> OK dive   that happens live bands playing Jungle Rot Immolation! Beer prices very fair even weekends but don't expect premium drafts  few those available bottles but seeing watching weight settled $4 Miller lite! Had great time show always do  Never tried daily drink specials but bought pitchers here  Again fair prices  Here's favorite part close Savers! thrift store shopping then drink watch show love! <EOR> The Cheyenne hosted first Doom June festival  Awesome staff sound setup great  Pitchers flowed cheap  drove all way San Francisco bay area back next year Doom 2  Cheers saloon hosting all us! <EOR> The Cheyenne's around while now   first mainly country western bar restaurant   remember friend dragging when 14 kinda goth she wanted learn line dancing   Oh mortifying   Hilarious retrospect mortifying moment   Now serves mainly just bar music venue   small local place stage ain't bad   type music bring X107 5ish sounding stuff most part good job although if you're into doubt you'd stay long     Service tends quick even if bar's packed prices reasonable   I come see friends' bands  pretty much all would there  <EOR> This place looks ghetto durning daylight hours  Its very far Vegas outskirts North  Tons parking but watch your car don't broken into jacked  Tons homeless people front  dance floors nice pool tables back restroom  stage where bands perform good size sounds decent  <EOR> Simple bar nothing special  event watch some bands good time but place would come back to  Only person cool door man  Watch some people playing pool grab some drinks  <EOR> \m \m may look accountant guy but heart really metalhead! Now granted only lived LV year half but far tell pretty much epicenter metal scene town  far only once but definitely great time definitely back! Huge Fosters cans $5 which thought pretty good price during show  must add smaller club sound quite high quality  Some could argue when band Cattle Decapitation doing thing PA quality wouldn't matter but disagree  Despite massive sound huge vocal range couldn't hear any distortion guitars course withstanding   <EOR> I must clear beginning review   I'm reviewing Cheyenne Saloon bar but concert venue  don't drink all couldn't even begin expound whether drinks worth money if selection anything write home about  all musical side particular place   The Cheyenne Saloon fantastic shithole  situated not so great part town furthest corner nondescript strip mall corner Cheyenne Rancho  would never think would such great place see show but bottom line perhaps most intimate venues town shows usually dirt cheap Anywhere between Free $25    Recently stage area given overhaul room looks fantastic compared used look  stage much more wide open ceiling gutted re worked much higher less claustrophobic  Unfortunately air conditioning actually worse before   so place usually becomes sweatbox middle show    The pit front stage two feet lower main floor venue enclosed small fence quite easy avoid maelstrom sometimes erupts front stage simply staying main floor  sort nice feature becomes frustrating when trying watch band manage beverage sure no careening towards mosh pit   The only real downsides joint somewhat rowdy clientele pervading smell smoke throughout entire venue  DEFINITELY plan washing your clothes night show if want completely smell off you   Despite few downsides place really paradise fans metal music  While occasional punk show place tends lean towards bringing national 90s metal bands well heavier local acts  pretty neat see bands use headline House Blues Ozzfest close because nine times ten come off stage hang afterwards   great photo opportunities autograph signings may ensue   Just idea some acts they've venue here's some bands seen come through Cheyenne Saloon Mushroomhead Powerman 5000 Fear Factory Soulfly Paul D'ianno Blaze Bayley ex singers Iron Maiden Not all bad place heavy music fan be  Check show schedule! <EOR> Very slow service  Stood bar 20 min before getting served  Finally drink served those small plastic juice glasses! sat empty awhile before anyone noticed  Finally bartender's attention ordered another  time he took glass some water bottom melted ice added stuff served way! just looked shocked expression he asks What? don't want it?
