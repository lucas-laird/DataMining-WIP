All could eat couple bites   moved bacon sausage overcooked really really really salty   prime rib absolutely no taste even very generous amount au jus put it   Spanish rice very undercooked seemed little pebbles   sushi just plain disgusting no other words describe it   also couldn't find any soy sauce anywhere no matter where looked   ask worker he brought one   don't understand why didn't keep next sushi area   Finally just threw hands despair donut   plain glazed donut   figured probably weren't cooked premises better chance being pretty decent   Unfortunately Flavors Buffet managed mess donut too   stale     I totally understand why everyone bashes place    they totally deserve it   If fact workers very nice friendly would 1 star me  <EOR> Loved buffet!!  last buffet tried Total Rewards Buffet Buffets tour we four meals deal    shame didn't come first!  far breakfast buffet awesome price!!!!

Quality food good! Although few items didn't turn great but could just picked off time! extremely satisfied definitely feel money's worth!   I would recommend doing Flavors buffet especially 24 hour buffet pass! great deal necessary fuel all Vegas festivities  would come back but would also try other buffets part package  <EOR> Don't know why people hating place   Come buffet Vegas   said would come again again sure wear stretchy pants  filled twice random selections disappointed   Well hubby mimosas meals maybe clouded judgement   Anyway pigged prime rib roast chicken cold shrimp kielbasa  yum  this place doctor's nightmare   Dessert station did disappoint   Again returned table two plates hand   hand bowl mango sorbet   other hand cheesecake chocolate brownies   sheer gluttony motion!!  Hubby ate much felt nauseous afterwards   But would again?

If paying customer $60 price tag 2 would probably sit well me   Service also sub par   lady taking drink order took forever drinks when asked straws took same length time them     The bus boy also sucked   asked where bathroom he rudely replied casino   He didn't even give directions    I think best part buffet creme brulee ice cream bar  <EOR> Alright there's whole lot review buffet's service beyond clean bus ladies right top getting empty plate front food well organized easy find you're mood for    So let's talk food instead  Mmm Mm!   Round One Started salad  Just eveything could think wanting American style buffet salad kinda wished kidney beans but Ranch dressing made it  Ranch way restaurant Ranch supposed be  Creamy without being thick flavorful heavy dairy   Round Two Fried Raviolis wanted them be  fried outside overwhelmed stuffing could only eat two before bored  Hush Puppies tasted your mama's  Roasted Red Potatoes crispy but soft bite into spiced nicely salty  Steamed Veggies tasted vegetables are  Stuffed Shell Seafood Sauce  Stuffed Shell    OH GOD  delicious! wished I'd gotten just solid plate them!  Round Three Two more Stuffed Shells  told good!! Stuffed Ricotta Egg spices topped some kind white sauce just hint seafood some overpowering fishy taste then fresh chopped tomatoes top  yummy but filling  What? No room desert?  Ok Round Four slightly painful Chocolate Covered Rice Krispie Treat  Only painful because full!!

Bummer!! would probably try them again see if much better if missed something   But would pay full price * <EOR> Eat early around 5  6 7 gets way busy  Club card members cashier first come big group  2 nights food great  busy nights seafood fast  think should more drink machines around place allow own beverages because think all wait staff same place fill drinks place big drink cups would empty quiet while  Everyone friendly food great dessert bar amazing  sugar free options too  <EOR> There's reason no line into buffet yet Caesars line mile long theirs!  advertise unlimited crab though crab legs dry fresh tasting all   peel eat shrimp better but nothing special   roast turkey dry didn't much flavor   veggie sushi roll very odd taste it   being shown table never saw server again offered any drinks   Soft drinks juice water coffee tea self serve but if want glass wine dinner forget it!  only things really enjoyed salad bar shrimp coconut macaroons   Defnintely worth $34 per person!!  If you're craving buffet while Vegas yourself favor pay extra money more quality ones! <EOR> If could give NEGATIVE10 stars trust would!!  First off let start saying WORST buffet think ever encountered! Additionally also made husband sicker dogs   coincidence maybe but probably not! think could gotten better meal Shoneys!!  I chose buffet because crab legs  When finally seated 45 minute wait open tables everywhere might add buffet crab legs COLD   who h* ^ eats cold crab legs?!?!? apparently if want warm steamed crab legs VIP high roller Harrah's  manager duty Jermon came talk but offered absolutely nothing return other breakfast buffet next day which leaving morning   told he said let see left table NEVER CAME BACK!!!  Very disappointed especially since birthday  Big FAIL your part Harrah's hope others see don't come here!!! Don't waste your money people   trust me!! <EOR> This best place buffet lunch more 300 items everything might think eat  Insanely amazing must try quality quantity both aamzing  Staff awesome welcoming  tired eating but won't supplying food    Strongly recommended buffet <EOR> While no should eat amount food available well priced well placed pleasant buffet once year when am Vegas first nights dinner stop  food varied interesting  While certainly gourmet quality taste many different cuisines topped many sweet desserts  Well worth visit price IMHO best around  <EOR> Out all buffets Buffet Buffets poorest both service quality   wait staff non present getting seating made feel such chore actually made party feel tad awkward   The food while looked good just didn't taste right   Savory items bland soft items chewy only basic stables tasted correctly   did large selection sweets but time your'e done having salty search something good palate you're full there's no point! <EOR> We bought 24 hr buffet pass stops  average nothing special  could've cleaner sure down fall  layout okay decent variety  Drinks area little runned down  <EOR> As part Buffet Buffets came lunch   definitely would pay eat if wasn't BoB   variety miniscule food just mediocre   burrito bar where your own burrito carne asada chicken asada   Both meats tasted crap didn't burrito   guacamole didn't taste real avocados   prime rib ok all special   The service also pretty slow   waitress disappeared period time real disappointment here   Overall buffets would choose next time around BoB  <EOR> This buffet Vegas Vacation look good     One big waste money  <EOR> I've better buffets but Flavors decent  waiter attentive which always good  food okay some highlights fried oysters prime rib a bit rare side but liked it king crab legs cotton candy! There's okay selection buffet  <EOR> Been almost every time Vegas many count food good  very large selection different types food always crab legs shrimp YUM!   far best part dessert section  every kind pie cake could think of  also chocolate fountain where could dip strawberries rice crispy treats marshmallows bananas    anything really! good ate whole plate desserts things stacked top other things! always come back buffet = <EOR> We came Groupon tonight   great deal 2 people   $40 both dinner   included 2 alcoholic beverages per person beer wine      The buffet isn't super fancy   But thought food tasted much better looked!  Usually other way around pleasantly surprised   Maybe time day   around 5 30pm early dinner  only 2 couples ahead line   prepared disappointed but quite surprised everything     The crab legs nice hot fresh   Peel and eat shrimp nicely chilled tasted fresh   Spring rolls fresh lightly crispy   pizza when must just come oven take first slice   lightly crispy crust plenty cheese pepperoni   only last plate pretty stuffed then   But  good couldn't stop eating it!   The desserts kind hit miss   cupcake dry stale but red velvet cupcake nice moist   chocolate ice cream tasted little off though carob   didn't much chocolate y flavor     Overall quite happy meal looking forward going back  <EOR> This buffet used really good  favorites Vegas  All say come near closing time  None sushi seafood edible everything developing thick crust over top sitting under heat lamp long  Definitely worth money paid think twice coming back next time  understand coming near closing time but shouldn't discount if food isn't going par? don't mind paying full price but food fresh appealing  <EOR> I CANNOT BELIEVE DISRESPECT AUDACITY PLACE!! I NEVER GIVE BAD REVIEW NEVER OFFENDED HERE  AVOID ALL COSTS  SHAME FLAVORS SHAME   My partner bought groupon brunch buffet which excited for  around noon little when stopped cashier lady  She told groupon valid because breakfast option ONLY available Sunday through Thursday it Sunday   clarified groupon said valid Sunday considering only offer Brunch no breakfast option must valid during Brunch hours else why would valid Sunday    riiiight?!   She started annoyed telling leave come back day served breakfast  She also said FIND ANY BREAKFAST OPTIONS HOUR  TIME IT?! THINK THERE'S BREAKFAST BEING SERVED HERE? COME BACK SOME OTHER TIME WHEN ITS BREAKFAST  PAID ISNT WORTH SERVE BRUNCH BUFFET Though breakfast becuase its brunch     right?  brunch is   breakfast lunch  Also if didn't want people purchase groupons use them buffet why put them website?!  She kept yelling waving hands if slap partner  She angry waving hands partners face decided time left   NEVER AGAIN  IF TREAT YOUR PATRONS THEN DONT DESERVE MONEY    I SUGGEST EVERYONE AVOID PLACE  SOMEWHERE GOOD SERVICE  <EOR> Surprisingly good Huge assortment including American mexican Asian Italian  Food salty rare buffets Good money great shrimp fantastic clam chowder crab legs Dessert plentiful nauseating sweet Great location high Roller  No drawback  don't expect $60 dinner buffet but money best money buy strip! <EOR> Ok five stars bananas foster  Maybe because I'd never tried them before maybe because amazing!!! going stick AMAZING! cotton candy buffet which thought super cute idea but all awesome desserts time cotton candy  swear wanted try ice cream all other good junk all sole motivation going Vegas eat buffets but couldn't enough those bananas! think point burnt myself because didn't patience let cool down before shoveling down piehole  well worth third degree tongue burns!

Even dessert good many options all good ice cream freshly made  waffle cones  I recommend dinner selection lot better   lunch few days later  lot less  <EOR> We very very dissatisfied  Back days great here  Buffet really terrible very expensive Saturday night  Seafood tasted old seemed frozen long time  Prime rib bloody grilled  Service ok but superb  Self serve drinks  guess while since family visited Las Vegas  sure if buffets similar other hotels  <EOR> Decent food but limited selection  Asian bar noodles rice meat  best part desert bar  Homemade ice cream good choices tarts cupcakes  Good table service  <EOR> This good ! fish delicious  sure give them your total rewards card more points  Everything taste really good  If you're Platinum you're drinks included alcoholic but might well grab drinks off casino floor  The ice cream made house soft serve  comfortable booths tv screens there  bathrooms located OUTSIDE  Ask directions  good  3 $81 just give idea  I busy stuffing face take photos  Sorry ! <EOR> Yeah all buffet bashing  loved place pretty much anything your belly desired  into since pretty much everything  But short wait all things considered since most buffets long lines  price decent around $20 which includes your drink soft served ice cream machine  Great way recover extreme hangover  <EOR> They snow crab legs both hot cold  prime rib actually quite good  Other rest food barely edible  If stick two items you'll good meal  If venture try other things may regret it  desserts ok  Lots choose from  also sugar free desserts  Probably place wouldn't back but meal wasn't awful  <EOR> Customer Service sweeping floor  while dinning totally rude potentially may invert health issues emanating  airborne pathogen created dust   Food Selection Very poor $30+ buffet each person   Food taste give them two stars however because everything else wrong place outweigh rating reverting zero   Other reasons don't know why but hand written tip amount receipt plus place your table all your guests know paid them  Additionally put card table indicating amount customers case five  Which find totally diswelcoming  far worse experience any buffet  <EOR> Flavors decent but nothing rave despite earlier reviews! enjoyed seafood bar sushi  good but great  Overall everything else pretty mediocre bland just flavorless  However server pretty attentive sweet! average price buffet Vegas  seriously doubt come back next time town other great service  food decent best there's much else say Flavors   <EOR> One ServSafe sanitation class person swears off buffets life  until Las Vegas specifically until Flavors    First off Ultimate Buffet applies eight them various hotels  Sort stuff your face day pass if will  If all want meal pay much more reasonable fee  particular Sunday think paid less $20 each easily ate twice crab the point whole thing    There something everyone  Salads seafood pasta pizza carved meats which witnessed them smoking in house Chinese sushi Mexican Italian desserts days  Almost every single thing ate delicious definitely worth money wait  <EOR> Mediocre food    Lito guy serving ice cream friendly  first visit last visit  warm crab legs only VIP members  o <EOR> This place poorly run   The people register two lines platinum regular customers  Both empty thought it'd fine just ealk through platinum entrance because didn't want walk around corner follow some velvet rails but apparently isn't ok told line again anyways waste everyone's time  Then line waitress  kind buffet seating waitresses? never shown designated seat any type AYCA place isn't even busy  There's seating EVERYWHERE  Lastly ll utensils managed waiters  couldn't new fork second dish vastly different food  dont want meat forks salads because greasy   Foodwise definitely good looks  Rhe selection also really small price payed but Vegas expected much  least looks nice here  <EOR> Breakfast above average  lot options choose from  Fruit station great  very fresh  If discount using your hotel key card Groupon other deal definitely worth value  <EOR> This best breakfast buffet ever had!!! Phenomenal flavor everything tried! Selection biggest but flavor everything trumped far! Clean comfortable ambience  Would absolutely visit again when Vegas! <EOR> Stopped lunch  okay  No complaints flavor food but limited   item beef offered when there  small salad bar hidden corner passed desserts which made no sense  $24 99 per person lunch expensive food offered but  new Vegas     dumb! <EOR> I managed find Groupon deal flavors  Before Groupon told try places Wicked Spoon Buffet Wynn Bacchanal Buffet  Even though great ratings reviews still Vegas budget dinner buffet prices steep  Flavors pricey well but buying Groupon still made better regular price because AYCD alcoholic beverages included   The Groupon allowed jump reward member line special seating  great because line seated shorter  service very slow but servers very friendly  Maybe understaffed night but only able 2 drinks piece because drink server pretty much serve whole area alone  guess good two drinks piece versus zero Groupon wasn't total waste but still happy couldn't more drinks   The food really good!!! many options choose Asian Mexican Italian seafood soul food  all delicious  stuffed couldn't indulge desserts but boyfriend let try some ice cream strawberry ice cream bomb!!  It would great if Groupon next visit Vegas because would definitely come back  would try come dinner early would more time indulge food drinks  Hopefully service speeds well  <EOR> We all impressed!  To start off literally waited almost 45 minutes line even into buffet   Monday night wasn't all busy   thing really pissed off 3rd 4th line but Express Line   If pay additional $5 per person into Express Line ahead everyone else   quite infuriating see people walk seated ahead when you've waiting 45 minutes seated   Crab legs?  Yea them   fact  why went   But under cooked way overcooked could hardly any meat them   definitely worth wait price!  The best things spaghetti alfredo sauce big selection desserts   carved ham wasn't bad either   prime rib cold extremely fatty   I'm thankful buy free coupon because worth MAYBE $10 instead normal $19 99   We won't going back!  don't let crab legs suck in they're worth it! <EOR> The nonsense started waitress   cashier did take drink orders when paid meal   seated fairly quick Sunday night waited several minutes waitress way over table   She picks receipt starts complain nothing written down drinks   takes off clean tables across room   fed just yelled across tables but she just continued clean tables   Luckily another diner told self serve machines around corner   But other people sat down dinner same issue her   all she would say sorry just walk away   Plus tables starting fill dirty dishes   forget exact price but somewhere between thirty forty dollars person eat night   problem no family actually enjoyed meal all   Should walked next door White Castle  <EOR> I love Vegas buffet  know manager probably helps   save typical review focus points love most endless crab legs!  thinking   wonder former life   something loved crab legs   But could be?  eats crab?  Most crabs many natural enemies predators  Birds attack smaller crabs sometimes carrying them high into air then dropping them boulders crack shells   Fish powerful shell crunching jaws also eat crabs   Many kinds mammals seals raccoons also look forward crab dinner   Crabs many predators ocean  If larger species sometimes crabs even prey own  pinchers hard shells hard imagine finds crabs worth all stress  However perhaps ocean creatures know land lovers taste crab meat even without garlic butter sauce   Maybe octopus  The jaws octopus known beak  very sharp bite octopus may inject poison  First octopus catches crab landing top then uses suction discs capture finally bite into its hard shell  crabs bite fatal paralyzing crab no longer uses its pinchers thrash allowing octopus tasty crab leg dinner   I'm inject poison into death dance dinner   Maybe some other kind fish sea creature  Dog fish sharks striped bass jellyfish red drum black drum cobia American eels other fish also enjoy crabs  larvae juveniles crabs especially vulnerable attack smaller fish sea rays eels  grow older turtles munch crabs jaws powerful able crunch through tough shell   I'm crunching through any shell jaws picking little kids   Maybe sea otter seal  In addition crayfish fish frogs sea otters love crab meal  fact cape clawless Asian small clawed otters feed mostly crabs  Sea otters eat 25 30 percent body weight otters through lot crab day  Seals also feast crustaceans such crabs  fact crabeater seal Antarctica named its love crab  However mostly seals krill  Another variety seal loves crabs Weddell seal another mammal Antarctic  Ocean   25 35 percent bodyweight crab meat!

<EOR> Ate Flavors breakfast lunch recently while visiting Las Vegas   years past enjoyed buffet but no more two tries   Breakfast complete rip off $18   $5 breakfast buffet card Palace Station more tastier selections   While everything meh mediocre bacon stood being particularly bad   served bin bits crumbly pieces instead strips   waitress never came over serve drinks manager Lunch Again $24 complete rip off very limited selections almost non existent salad bar   None food would consider premium par if good Golden Corral buffet   Belileve if must eat buffet Strip near Strip similar slightly higher prices much better Le Village Paris Spice Market Planet Hollywood Carnival World Rio  <EOR> I thought buffet pretty good  table 8 waiter pretty good remembering drink orders  food pretty good best  But good enough back seconds thirds  Loved cotton candy! <EOR> Nothing spectacular line just long all other buffets   food edible but nothing write home about   only thing rave customer service received everyone encountered here   groupon offer decent deal  <EOR> Great buffet if you're strip  lot options choose different selections ethnic cuisines  also many seafood options   After finishing sure check selection desserts well! tasty look there's also ice cream available    For price would say place holds great value  wish alcohol included soda but might become problem everyone if available everyone! <EOR> The good    prime rib boiled shrimp vanilla ice cream bananas foster top  kids impressed cookies cotton candy  rest    Meh  But  okay because low expectations start with    Nothing special point come back but ate $55 tax incl family four which cheap cheap Vegas  Bogo buffet coupons w VIP tickets Mac King show  Otherwise buffet $24 each dinner  $55 dinner 4 great value grub go  did trick door more Vegas  <EOR> Run  Far away  Just away here   This place seems believe all tourists LV hungover know they're eating actually taste buds working order    Don't wrong plenty options just nothing edible golden y brown  Even dessert looked golden brown    I think  why pay walled off cashier area before stepping into buffet  no take look food run it    I made mistake eating don't to  Just run  <EOR> So friend town decided all 24 hour Buffet Buffets pass  next morning later start would liked stuck going Flavors since didn't much line    should warning!

I'd come back try dinner because sounds some good options  guess cheap buffet unlike Caesar's   can't complain much! <EOR> The food pretty decent par Bellagio  However lacked some diversity other hotels  did offer cotton candy which little bizarre took them but actually fun  Overall would recommend despite lack diversity based upon its quality  <EOR> Awful food    comparable school cafeteria  Even worse customer service  waiter came check take away plates but once entire hour there  He yelled across room husband ask if wanted more water  Wtf?! Then guy behind counter saw waiting ice cream    Made eye contact proceeded behind tray cart text phone  rude  never ever come back place even if taying  hotel  <EOR> Unfortunately nothing good say buffet  ate Tuesday April 17th  3 30 pm  flight fly back St  Louis 7  Started feeling wheezy sweating time boarded plane  Within 1 hour departure puked twice bathroom diarrhea once plane felt nauseous dizzy whole flight  four ate only thing ate didn't salad  must say never eat again  <EOR> We ate weekend Saturday August 20th   Arriving late brunch purchased 24hr pass two   Which way marked way weekends whopping 80 bucks person   Paid bill $160   told only could use pass Ceasars Palace but all others Ceasars group fair game    So ate brunch intent come back another location early dinner before hitting strip night only find ones found all closed until 5pm    So strip without dinner going come back around later evening only find once again some closed 8pm time another already closed    So didn't dinner all   much getting value 160 bucks     Woke next morning barely made Paris location brunch before 24hrs expired    So all 2 brunches each 160 bucks     It's 24hrs bill out    More 10 12hrs if manage find open     RIP OFF RIP OFF RIP OFF  I decided write letter corporate office   While did reply 48hrs   All offered 2 additional meals next visit   replied said would happy if offered 2 meals per person way felt would getting full value 160 bucks    They refused   much more treating Platinum Total Reward Member Good      Highly recommended pass    Especially weekend when jack prices 50 plus percent  <EOR> First time eating bad   Decent selection foods    love Asian cuisine   dumplings sesame seed buns!
