Thanks JJANGA!! <EOR> Last night second time location  First time two weeks ago pleasant experience enjoying dinner group workers of state corporate office 5 total  seated right away 6pm 7 30 done already paid wrapping when male manager approached table requested leave since many people waiiting seated  all disappointed request being first time ever requested any restaurant still did nicely politely    Last night 7 people dinner seated same section first time same server  all chose AYCE barely started ordering appetizers when again first time ever AYCE sushi place server said ordering much  could see later talk other servers taking quick glances table  Must say lost appettie over attitude? Food good but enough take rude comments servers being looked upon hungry gluttonous people  other AYCE sushi places Las Vegas welcome party 7 pay much did generous tip considering ordered items a la carte well give rude comments  <EOR> Not best AYCE sushi joint but worst either  sushi pretty fresh    but kind boring  nigiris different sauces garnishes  asked squid shiso leaf top which always other sushi places but lady didn't know talking about  But portion sizes nigiri    much rice fish perfect size well  servers really nice friendly  place close house come occasionally  But again favorite AYCE  <EOR> Really fun atmosphere music  Sexy Time roll Mexican roll both delicious  came group 7 service very efficient   Would definitely come back all eat  <EOR> I would give NO stars if could  place unorganized  Doesn't even courage say sorry when know messed up  <EOR> Great AYCE!

Love place   Very cheap quality! <EOR> Came try sushi burger disappointed  service awesome enjoyed happy hour deals  <EOR> Service impeccable  shrimp calamari tempura should crispy all soggy unlike some places  Loved agedashi tofu crispy outside tofu melts your mouth  order rolls brown rice instead white although you'd pay $1 extra even if you're doing AYCE  mocktails good concept esp those mixed drinks but without alcohol  arizone sunset mocktail added pineapple juice awesome  rolls I'd recommed Next Time roll well old trusy Johnny Roll  don't try skimp overloading rolls rice  Laid back airy spacious atmosphere service quick  ESPN all 3 TVs! 1 star off offering half rolls some bulgogi dynamite little burnt side  also wish no extra charge brown rice  Other awesome  <EOR> If review just based food it'd probably 3 5 all food simply adequate  Nothing outstanding nothing horrible just straight average sushi  Unfortunately experience service caused knock off extra star  came group friends dinner wanted ayce didn't even end getting enough food justify price paid  Food took far long table  servers' behavior much issue just fact wasn't enough staff food quickly enough dinner rush  Nothing gave any desire come back  <EOR> Food amazing usual staff location pretty attentive  Would given 5 stars but just keep asking much beer glass empty but no asks if want another  Then another beer but empty glass stays etc etc   just those nights  Again staff great getting something just keep asking basic things all   Will definitely back though  If want best sushi Vegas it  Period  <EOR> Sushi Burger whaa!!! fish crustation seaweed!

All classic sushi staples even some interestingly new different options  super white tuna AMAZING!! <EOR> My fiancé tried place lunch surprisingly delicious  bulgogi karai burger  sounds weird first messy but definitely worth it  sure panko crusted rice  Adds nice crispy texture  bit messy but delicious all same  If trying new food adventurous give place try! <EOR> Was worst thing ever? No  worth going back to? Probably not   The only reason why am giving three stars benefit doubt  could've experiencing bad day however experience cause never come back  coworkers dine in deal 1 classic roll 1 signature roll appetizer soup salad $12 95  lot food price but food just ok service bad   The soup salad came right away  Then very awkward 30 minute break before anyone came back gave additional food  Then rolls started coming before appetizers two people given all three items once while two given 2 3 items only given 1  wait another 10+ minutes rest come out  When woman dropped off signature roll pull really long hair roll which just solidified never going back   Could just experienced terrible day? Yes but restaurant wasn't busy sushi prepared horribly each piece fell apart when barely touched chopstick   taste fine but continue going sushi place plaza next Jjanga  <EOR> Great AYCE sushi! Excellent service  Diverse options  Lots unique rolls including no rice  Something everyone good specials  <EOR> I love place! Food amazing always fresh! Staff friendliest ever seen Japanese places! Specially server Antonio always nice! Thank guys your service! <EOR> I'm hoping tonight just very very off night due busy restaurant was    food last time pretty good but service completely horrendous   My sister ordered 9 items la carte 8 which ordered beginning meal  8 initially ordered waitress took order screwed 1 items twice somehow forgot write down 2 items completely  anybody capable doing 8 item order sushi restaurant especially asking customer repeat each item then repeating order back customer confirm completely beyond me   When she brought first plate she realized something off put table anyways immediately picked again  She then asked confirm wasn't ordered  next minute she asked 3 times tell item did order   When item a spicy scallop hand roll finally came wasn't hand roll    but cut roll  She put down said ordered hand roll didn't you    confirmed instead offering correct mistake apologizing she said Don't worry same price  point meh    still good mood just chalked full place fact Saturday night actually wants working etc etc  getting 7 items waiting bit last two though waiter walks asks if we're ready check  tell should another 2 coming a spicy salmon cut roll squid nigiri he checks sushi chefs comes back tells don't record those orders  fine confirm still want those 2 items he puts order   After getting roll waited bit then asked original waitress check squid  She checks sushi chef says no don't order  point we're just ready ask check which surprise surprise squid nigiri 2 people now told didn't order   I'm prone writing excessively long reviews but sheer amount f*uck ups for lack better word fact nobody really apologized kinda bugs me   Needless say won't back  Food decent but said lot places around town most which *might* even your order right first or second time around least boast higher 67% order accuracy rate  <EOR> I stamped card buy 10 1 free  7 stamps card 3 more free one   4 people but don't let pay 3 4th person free   Also manage nice all  <EOR> Having fan original location since opened stoked hear second location opening closer house   Still pretty new Kanji sign still easy find right next DW Bistro   only AYCE don't know teppenyaki stacks up    What liked Same menu original location bigger space seems cleaner because brighter colors option teppenyaki   What didn't like The teppenyaki smell leave your clothes I feel hair smells teppenyaki even home don't accept punch card original location only open dinner   The new location pretty consistent original same quality fish rolls rolled well hot apps come hot etc  Seems little fancier all ceramic plates instead plastic ones old location  Service same kind hit miss  Some people really nice some little cold but always flag someone down need  really love riceless rolls fact don't hound finishing every bit rice your plate  those people trying skimp rice shove more fish belly just don't want extra carbs female vanity thing     Overall great option if craving AYCE Vegas  tried fair share different places Jjanga far most consistent fresh well fresh AYCE fish no Kabuto Soho places  Pretty normal pricing AYCE but nice riceless rolls decent variety apps  <EOR> I'm town every 6 weeks work become tradition visit sushi place every Saturday done week!

We'll back see if service better next time  <EOR> I tried AYCE sushi lunch  Good amount nonspicy rolls compared most Vegas  However think rice fish ratio little poor more rice sushi  didn't give burritos try based off previous reviews  KFC very good  Also want mention any sushi lovers place does offer half rolls which loss star just that  <EOR> This place really good but wish knew language menu go  Don't bring kids if read p <EOR> I love coming during late night happy hours its super convenient Vegas locals  food fantastic well  All eat quality sushi lots variety only $20 95 can't it! Happy hours 3 5pm 11 2am! <EOR> This place just very good all around service mixed food wasn't good hoped would be  sorry  But place NO me  <EOR> Always big fan Jjanga work over original location down Spring Mountain Rd  heard through grapevine he expanded opened second restaurant over west side  Even more intriguing fact he taken over Kanji restaurant which known teppanyaki  group headed over check new place recently suffice say all good    hood!  Jjanga located west side over near Fort Apache Warm Springs  taken over space formerly known Kanji Steak Sushi  But retained teppanyaki location even if mood sushi your onion volcano fix here  interior definitely very cool classy  probably more upscale sushi spots town  If teppan route side restaurant very fun exciting   But oh let talk sushi because something should definitely miss on  Jjanga and also different restaurant top two favorite ayce sushi spots Vegas  He uses lot fresher product most other places he would willing send anything isn't standards  cuts fish used nigiri thick rice portions small   big plus me  rice cooked really well here  personally big fan rolls but Jjanga does some good ones  group ordered some able sample few conclusion really good all flavors balancing each other and also Jjanga probably best salmon skin hand roll town    A lot people take apps granted when sushi restaurant  would urge look over apps Jjanga because would missing out  Because same care quality he chefs put into sushi same great quality care being put into appetizers  first thing must order golden scallop  thick meaty whole scallop lightly battered simply fried  great way start your meal  baby octopus textural sensation chewiness octopus offsetting crispiness preparation  save yourself room oyster  would icing cake!

No  If did order much did finish he told once then charge waste no need repeat  Needless say finished everything    2 constantly person perhaps manager always walking table  Yes wanted sure no ordering AYCE sharing those ordered La Carte but walk many times? He might well sat down watched eat    Overall quality food good but service needs improvement  There's more subtle ways doing did say  Also asked extra sake cup napkins numerous times before things requested  times put La Carte items side 3 AYCE people sitting  even grouped ourselves things easier them serve monitor as doing but did work out  <EOR> Rice burger?!!

Whatever case wasn't quality sushi  thing liked piece sushi steak instead fish  but  sushi restaurant for fish  service also seemed lacking night  waitress didn't seem she knew English very well which really don't care but boyfriend middle asking question she just turned around walked away  just moved Vegas San Diego might bit spoiled when comes seafood general but all great reviews place yelp really expecting better  <EOR> My husband absolutely love place! food delicious wide variety choose from  recommended friends also love it  sushi fresh non fish selections outstanding  favorite menu choo choo special  YUM!!!

provocatively named dishes hilarious very vegas esque delicious  menu very nice variety  very pleased know could much mochi ice cream heart desired stomach could contain  Although mochi $2 some other items menu pricey would suggest dinning a la carte    The staff members very friendly extremely patient  would definitely dine again next time visit area! <EOR> Review based strictly sushi did eat seemingly popular teppanyaki tables   Sushi composed 2 basic components fish rice   If both stellar finished product suffer greatly   tried variety sushi rolls all which well executed   rice falling apart slightest touch!  fish ok nothing special   However oysters exceptional!  those first thought found real gem but sadly when rest sushi arrived seriously lacking quality preparation execution   much better luck other JJanga location near Chinatown  <EOR> My new favorite spot eat ayce sushi  many times  quick seating fast service its best non peak hours  usually try time right gotten seated soon walked waiting 20 mins  Once made mistake coming late night super crowded wait hour    Service always great whenever go  waiters waitress never take long long list orders  sushi very good may fresh but isn't dry some other places  Tried sushi burgers delicious!

Superstitious much? Once assessed purse situation let's stare menu  I sure loved looking menu offer  opted AYCE because sushi person right mind otherwise  Lunch rounded 21 bucks while dinner rounds 26  price WELL WORTH it! noticed offered sushi burritos part AYCE but listed under hand rolls  Which basically same smell   We ordered away  husband lucks because know those special 1 order person items sushi places implements never order any them anyway he gets 2! Lol  He extremely excited over seeing Tobiko served menu  color beautifully red masago look real dull  He just loves trying new things even though may taste same    I enjoyed all had  Please dont list AYCE order  hell remembers T anyway? know couple items ordered towards end thought useless  ate them nothing exciting came it  think they're place just disgustingly feel full  Hahhaha! Because last 2 orders made feel just that  tried looking online menu but some reason menu restaurant vs online could slightly different didn't see nor recognize any items being items ate made feel slob   Another thing LOVE garlic edamame  Love it  no really love it  However did love did like it swear swear swear    Also seated front two chefs while guy really friendly welcoming woman chef made feel she annoyed never bothered ask if wanted anything  ended staring friendlier chef hungry puppies until he caught drift  Lol  husband became really timid when came to ordering because he seated adjacent woman he didn't really order much he wanted because vibe  BUT   he still he came for    Another annoying thing is   plates other patrons places right front waiters waitresses keep reach front us  rather inconvenience borderline annoying  should create system where don't that  Why hate sitting bar    If your stomach can't handle isn't worth opting AYCE   they great soup salad appetizer nigiri options pretty cheap price selection opinion  imagined bringing children just ordering appetizers alone they'd covered    Overall highly recommend giving them shot  They're pretty good love menu options! Kid stroller friendly! Certainly return   waitress waiter please?!  Enjoy! <EOR> I'm die hard sushi lover place second none!!!!! Chef koo koo epitome professionalism fun!!

Oh don't worry though! They're same price though  Don't worry  Thanks?   I also ordered squid nigiri spicy salmon roll  Another waiter come asking if would check  mentioned missing items apparently never put in  look confusion passes over waiter's chef's face few moments  He says Oh! put salmon roll came but waited 20 minutes squid just ended asking check  original waitress came back asked if wanted anything else asked squid again chef never check squid asked them remove paid left   This probably worst dining experiences ever but If enjoy sh*tty service mildly rude waitresses JJANGA place you! <EOR> Jjangas nigiri all perfect size delicious   Rolls small but good when eating all eat sushi   Dine eat all eat sushi every once awhile also orders   Convenient sushi spot location close home  <EOR> Awesome sushi awesome customer service!

Hands down best sushi joint 702    Worth every penny!!! <EOR> If you've seen viral Facebook video sushi burger then know here   It's very similar sushi burrito  patties made rice  suggest getting Panko crust extra crunch   The sushi burger called Jjanga Burger consists spicy tuna crab meat seaweed salad  wrapped brown paper help keep its shape  burger alone $9 combo $13  combo burger fries drink  fries girl ALWAYS combo  fiancé other hand says he pass fries  I deducted star because first time fiancé picked he carrying 4 small size clear cups  He said don't any other size cups gave 2 each equal medium size  Wouldn't easier invest bigger size cups?
