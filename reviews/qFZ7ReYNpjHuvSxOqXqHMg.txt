Fish fresh  All rolls menu same 4 items no variety all  Every roll shrimp tempura rubbery soggy tempura  Cucumber Salad all cucumbers rolls overripe old cucumbers limp off color  Seaweed salad lot liquid just tasted off  Octopus nasty undercooked something   This favorite sashimi spit out   Overall Don't go!! never again  many other sushi places within couple blocks way worth wait extra block dollar yet almost all AYCE same price   <EOR> I first heard spot buddy said Jjanga honed skills before breaking into own restaurant  intrigued similar food going be  eating would say even though think Jjanga edge splendid sushi restaurant!  This place located deep southwest side town  surprised far but guess good located near lot suburbs  also noticed sign outside under new management some food might changed since Jjanga worked there   After walking noticed everything dark but cool modern way  sushi bar huge hold lot people  thing kinda weirded seems chefs hovering above eat due highness sushi bar center   I ordered lot items while thought pretty good nothing bad  fish quality using very good  really didn't rice much little sour taste   As far apps chicken katsu octopus skewer fresh oysters thought fried calamari really good  didn't care pork belly ribeye steak grilled octopus  thought udon ok   This definitely solid place would put same league Sushi Mon  would definitely recommend spot those living southwest don't want drive all way down Spring Mountain some good sushi  place also lot better original restaurant Green valley  quality place all around  <EOR> Ugh where even begin  Came part five around 5 Friday dead only guy serving  believe he also manager because he wearing business formal  Now when set down he just brought waters asked if ready   and course we're ready because literally just set down funny thing when ready he no where found even though restaurant empty  forth food comes he doesn't bring any ginger wasabi   finally flagged down 5 people he brings tiny tray serving wasabi just bit ginger    seriously? guy just bad he supposed wasn't even nice vibe he gave bad  flag down more waters order when dead  Food wasn't even great but service vibe made worse     Should gotten hint come when only ones there  <EOR> We eat often   moved Vegas 2 years ago finished dinner restaurant next door saw AYCE scrolling sign window   Since both enjoy good sushi noted should try them some time   Came back few nights later sat bar met great sushi chef taken good care over many visits   food opinion awesome atmosphere fine when sit sushi bar service great   If sit booth spotty   They Under New Management sign outside wall although understand management changed since before moved here   so over 2 years ago   Probably time take down although guess brings new folks want see New Management getting things done   Ever since first visit when walk greeted name which just adds another level service minds   taken several friends including some said really don't sushi all left very happy  <EOR> Another spot wife  Chenga Woody always take care us  Great Sushi!

Amazing service sushi!! Only bummer can't aj lunch    young sushi chef very nice adorable!!! <EOR> Never again  Really    can't even believe place still open decent reviews here  Its under new management    but red flag when realized sumo sushi 1 permanently closed  The food old tastes awful  I ordered poke salad saturated some type burnt hoisiny sauce  couldnt even force myself eat it  When let waiter know he oh dont it? which replied   no its dont its good all     He took away no appologee nothing charged everything   Poor slow service fully staffed only 2 other tables there <EOR> I often look forward trying new sushi places oftentimes wind comparing food service overall dinning experience  Sumo sushi 2 unfortunately would rank lowest sushi places would eat at  ordered CHICKEN TERIYAKI BENTO JAPANESE LASAGNA ROLL CHICKEN KARAGE  miso soup came bento box watered down not sure but tasted ones packet chicken dry tad burnt Japanese lasagna actually good however took 3 tries actually order right I don't eel sauce asked put but off course wrong lastly waited 30 minutes chicken karage come out   Food wise I'd give 6 5 7 10  think need eliminate menus though  menus table under glass plus actual All Eat menus provide with  just think much confuses customer  Meanwhile service needs whole lot improvement  seems lack communication between waitstaff because two servers kept asking same questions us  also repeat orders them because seemed some mix which probably could explain why karage took long when did look chicken strips take 45 minutes cook  Also think servers need better training OS because charged multiple times total nearly doubled    Overall probably come back here  save myself stress eat somewhere else  am however giving business two stars because Japanese lasagna pretty good waitstaff despite everything experienced gave complimentary sushi go  But sorry Sumo Sushi 2 impressed  Perhaps guys might try going Restaurant Impossible ask Gordon Ramsay save guys  <EOR> The fish very fresh although quality isn't consistent   Sometimes fish best city other times lack any flavor   best thing Sumo Yuzu Yellowtail   thing keep coming back for   tart juice yuzu gives nice refreshing taste     Service decent   busy nights service impeccable   Servers ask food if need anything else   But when very few people service very slow inhospitable   Strange   Make sure sit bar if AYCE   You'll more sushi faster  <EOR> The wait staff horrible  3 different people serve dined  Each seemed hurry confused each time interacted us  boyfriend drinking Asahi when waiters gave another beer replace he Sapporo remind waiter  Also asked ponzu sauce waited while then walk sushi bar table it  ordered sweet shrimp neglected serve shrimp heads supposed come it   we ask served too  Karaage chicken very dry served just regular basic ketchup  ask drinks refilled more napkin each got  attentive waiter would anticipate guests needs but staff needs more training apparently  <EOR> Our family loves place   servers great   rolls creative great!  also crank rolls fast  <EOR> Excellent food  all came fast fish very fresh   Great waitresses prompt accurate orders smiled lot  tell actually enjoyed living  Excellent service all way around  <EOR> really good ayce sushi love green mussels  cant believe all bad reviews service  usually 9pm later staff always very friendly me  remember drink order  left card young lady waitress keep me  really enjoy place <EOR> Same owner UMIYA SUSHI!!!

Sadly there's much report  completely agree everything Tony T  wrote review dated 2 10 2011  The price AYCE still + 25 bucks tax your basic drink isnt included    I very strongly would confirm Tony's final comment review Korean influence sauces  lot rolls special items heavily sauce dependent which did didnt work advantage few times    Throwing few things own Cucumber Salad Wasnt exactly fresh cucumbers swimming vinegar way long giving them soft soaked vinegar exploding result when bite into them  Deep Fried Baby Octopus Hope octopi reproduce cool because simply amazing  Remember comment heavily sauce dependent? Balance damn near perfect  Kamikaze Roll Pretty much spicy tuna some eel sauce  eel sauce poured top spicy tuna rolls rice soaked bar hopping Fremont street  Personal Preference but would better if sauced plate then added rolls  Cherry Blossom Yeah thing ordered didnt finish because didnt really much  best memory menu described fried soft shell crab outside Krab cucumber other stuff inside avocado outside drizzled some sort sauce  presentation excellent just beautiful look at  itself other hand wasnt exactly liking due personal preference due anything part  little soft shelled crab much Krab much sauce ended me    Baked Mussels Why ALWAYS baked mussels menu almost every sushi place but NO orders plate when mussels come guy orders he gets mugged? great even took time remove them shells cut them half more bite sized pieces  Also lot mayo before being baked  extra points book   Bacon Wrapped Asparagus Wait wait wait   bacon wrapped asparagus AYCE sushi menu?!?! 2 amazing     Cajun Albacore bit salty side Cajun dry spice rub  Albacore fresh   So yeah  it  would recommend place people enjoy sushi without serious love raw fish  <EOR> This favorite sushi spot Vegas    lot!! sushi chefs experience always welcome friends some kind celebrities    The food delicious rolls unique staff usually attentive but chefs phenomenal    My favorite menu items tuna karai something wrong 69 screaming orgasm lion roll mistake roll choo choo special    Friday nights best because always sake bombs bar!!
