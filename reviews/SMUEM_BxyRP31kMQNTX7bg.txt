Great little lunch place!! <EOR> Still classic lemonade   and if you're going junk food may well cooked order   $11 99 4 sticks 2 fries 2 regular sized lemonades  <EOR> Big fan Hot Dog Stick reason location didn't off since drive thru well       blocked seemed if where doing some fixtures  decided inside looks empty if just moved day register right next kitchen which wide opened where 2 girls working both register kitchen noticed girl take order's grab money straight kitchen food without washing hands place wasn't dirty but wasn't clean when gave food seen girls pouring flour container floor sanitary! When food girl forgot drinks mind 1 main reasons lemonade food good but just keep going mall while place steps game up  <EOR> I love corn dogs Hot Dog Stick!  Always fresh hot   staff friendly helpful   having mall satisfy corn dog craving huge plus! <EOR> Clearly way understaffed should take 15 minutes counter order just lemonade Hopefully management hire more employees happen other customers  <EOR> Completely awesome customer service  changed order couple times she completely calm happy help us  More amazing  Definitely returning life  <EOR> They use vegan veggie dog WIN! but then put egg milk into batter FAIL!
