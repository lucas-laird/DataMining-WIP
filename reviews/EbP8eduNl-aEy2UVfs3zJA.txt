After being seated took decor restaurant  Switch changes its surroundings every half hour walls rising down some side side even ceiling gets act! dance reveals new different motifs all which rather bland boring   Our waiter evening seemed more accustomed McDonald's fancy restaurant  he showed exactly 3 times entire evening  First take order then drop off food lastly check  guest ordered wine straight away came no less 30 minutes! food risotto scallops came 1 hour 15 minutes waiting! hell takes long two dishes? simply no excuse this  add insult injury food just average!

Going again during past President's weekend knew might some issues getting reservations made them well advance   made them far advance realized day would late dine husband 8 year old son   Yikes!  some doubt walked hostess 5pm asking change reservation 7pm   and greeted pleasant smile quick answer would pleasure  Awesome!!! Walking everyone hostesses managers servers busers incredibly pleasant made fantastic evening whole family   Some restaurants might turn noses down children fine dining establishment but everyone genuinely pleased in   manager overheard son asking olives martini   She returned quickly two olives just son   fantastic that??!!!  just tip iceburg all evening  Yes agree some earlier reviews food wasn't best there   But still good remember open two months!  Most restaurants never really into stride quickly   good service i'd definitely willing back try again  <EOR> One would say could really three restaurants because rooms change every twenty minutes  way food par decor  Both impressive    Appetizer Crab cake Scrumptious crab cake topped carrots fried perfection    Salad regular basic field greens basic balsamic vinaigrette  perfect balance crab cake because fried duh  Meal Red Snapper took into sweet stairwell heaven  Every bite filled bang each bite just brought more surprise ate throughout dinner course  grilled then laid top bed tomatoes onions  sauce tangy zesty  PERFECT prized fish  Oh love thee red snapper friend    Sides Yukon mashed potatoes Golden creamy whipped perfection  Just love mashed taterz    Creamed spinach sweet taste made palate jump surprise  But still delicious  Creamy sweet weird mixture spinach but worked    Dessert Bananas foster disappointed when wasn't lit but tasted just if New Orleans  could still taste rum off bananas pure bliss   Our server knowledgeable staff very friendly treated really well  snobby all but very respectful! <EOR> I'm torn between giving Switch 3 4 stars because really want say 3 5 but going err lower side one   Dining Switch interesting experience worth novelty but entire concept restaurant switching designs lighting every 20 many minutes actually distracting annoying while because dramatic music play during switch drown your dinner conversation   exactly fan but interesting least   More importantly food its high low points   order consumption bread good guava mojito probably highest note entire meal   really good butternut squash soup good but standard caesar salad also good but standard grilled octopus plentiful but little underwhelming bone in ribeye far outstripped expectations whole lot served alongside some curiously deliciously mind unfathomable garlic heads good ate all them monkfish also really good if tiny bit salty   tasted lobster standard mac n cheese most god awful cauliflower mush ever tried shove down throat which really surprised hearty endorsement waiter gave it finally dessert chocolate cake can't even remember because mediocre   The most important parts meal two entrees both very good beyond expectations but rest meal sort lackluster barring delicious mojito    entrees want give Switch 4 stars but remembrance unacceptably disgusting cauliflower side sheer annoyance restaurant itself prevent doing so  <EOR> The Vegasy gimmick walls fun steak delicious service impeccable   So why 3?  Compared other high end steakhouses just okay     First off selection steaks very small   steakhouse would expect broader variety cuts   only 5 selections including 2 New York strips one aged 1 bison steak    Second Cesar salad   Insipid   Bland   Watery     I'm glad experience but eating steak elsewhere next visit  <EOR> The stars mostly creative design atmosphere   see restaurant change before your eyes every twenty minutes pretty amazing    obvious alot money invested technology   walls shift ceilings cave form new creations music changes all once   pretty incredible! As food service okay   Service little frazzled disorganized first hard tell server   sommelier difficult locate   like 20 minutes maybe?  when he did come he unhelpful kind condescending would actually consider desire Argentine wine   Still stuck French bust attitude   But customer please least don't pull when just asking suggestion New World wines!   taste   grrr    Anyway Hawaiian ahi tuna poke light flavordul scallops wellington unique very good   did feel little miffed black truffle gnocchi   ordered half portion but still same price   understand am paying truffles but little less pressure would nice   dessert Venezuelan chocolate souffle also good but did blow mind    I would come Switch atmosphere but better places Vegas if foodie  <EOR> This place very nice  and being very nice price also very nice  pun intended However did enjoy experience here   gf took birthday dinner over valentine's day weekend bone in ribeye my usual selection steak restaurants might add she fish filet some sort   I lobster bisque soup gf caesar salad   trying both liked lobster bisque more salad   My bone in ribeye super delicious tasted around same way cowboy bone in ribeyes ruth's chris steakhouse tasted   gf's fish filet cooked over some mushrooms tasted even more delicious   Plus gf could stop raving over mashed potatoes   both agreed mash potatoes probably more twice daily serving butter order taste good   And sweet potato fries extremely tasty but eating entire ribeye could finish fries   I'd suggest ordering only sweet potato fries least two people because huge serving   Anyway giving five stars because service   made reservations week prior via open table which taken care seamlessly but waiter very stern very social all   would understand if he trying give each tables privacy but demeanor made seem lot snob  <EOR> The food pricey but well worth it! sea bass best ever had!

another vegan foodie friend very non vegan husband  started some cocktails she margarita good but nothing special Ketel 1 Basil Gimlet $12 which she immediately jealous of   fine fine beverage if tad sweet   basil flavor really comes through drink well balanced   both next round!  The vegan menu see pictures included right flap menu no need specially request it!  decided split Tofu Carpaccio appetizer then also split two vegan entrees Ratatouille Polenta mushrooms     The Tofu Carpaccio really delicious   Raw thinly sliced tofu topped artichoke hearts porcini mushrooms shaved fennel some ridiculously good sauces   sauces really shined all dishes   The entrees good but pretty over priced small portion size lack high end ingredients   ratatouille very good but timbale only 3 4 c food! topped almond slivers which tasty but would nice some pine nuts $28   polenta cake $32 also fairly small portion but came topped several good sized grilled royal trumpet mushrooms smoky earth sauce wanted lick off plate   polenta itself well textured but slightly underseasoned   After main course hovering between 3 4 star review but dessert pushed 4! split vegan brownie raspberry sorbet fresh raspberries $12    Whoa   wasn't sure first bite but just better better every taste   good! The hubs steak mac n cheese both which he said excellent then profiteroles dessert   Also win  I kind gimmick environs changing every 20 min although does tend stop conversation dead second while watch show adjust change     All all pretty great dining experience   service also awesome all servers seemed understand accommodate vegan needs   would definitely return try remaining vegan items give some new entrees shot if SWITCH menu bit   hahahahaha slay me  <EOR> I admit hard find chilean sea bass any menu fact restaurant served already gave few steps ahead counterparts   fish cooked nicely husband's steak also cooked right temp   food par expect expensive meal   honest probably same steak cheaper   all Vegas   But sea bass tougher come by   8 50 fiji water?
