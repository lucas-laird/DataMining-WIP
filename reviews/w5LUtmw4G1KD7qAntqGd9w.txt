Food great! First time trying place lunch definitely won't last   Service friendly   Will recommend place friends family   I chicken teriyaki plate believe  Great job <EOR> I wouldn't venture off strip but The Bachelore group required visit Yoshinoya     He lives Chicago whenever he ventures west coast he seeks Yoshinoya   never Yoshinoya states   only time location across Kabukicho gate   experience three stars   Meat decent cheap   However experience Las Vegas location disappointing   sesame chicken wings tasted fresh enough but force myself consume beef bowl vegetables    Uhm iced tea tasted fine  I always describe meat wet bacon overcooked rice   spot on   More fat meat   Rice clumpy fat water     To top off $26 cab ride strip back forth buddy bought THREE large beef bowls bring back Caesar's   give two stars since buddy smiling MSG drool next three meals   ack!  Only best The Bachelore   <EOR> Executive Summary Food's great but quick really really really cheap fills up   Did mention cheap?  No Yoshinoya isn't greatest food   haute cuisine   fact probably just barely edible but when consider price value proposition Yoshinoya should top your fast food list   much does value meal your typical fast food restaurant cost?  Probably $5 6 depending size you'd prefer your cholesterol delivery system    $6 crappy burger fries soda   Yoshinoya $6?  steaming bowl rice topped hot beef onions dessert soda   If could without soda desert could walk away Yoshinoya spending less $4   great bargain   Yes chicken same texture styrofoam container served but still more fulfilling Big Mac   If you're budget you're hurry you're sick burgers Yoshinoya you'll think twice ordering value meal ever again   Bonus UNLV students $3 99 beef chicken bowl soda   Bring your student ID  <EOR> I crave stuff       Every time Vegas eat much can   saying lot since casinos more then happy comp all meals   I always beef bowl  No chicken bowl no vegetable bowl anything else  Just beef bowl   I'm sure why some people don't but love it  think weeks before Vegas  <EOR> Came into location  lunch boyfriend daughter  Angus  beef plate walnut shrimp   Which good  Then beef bowl Angus beef bowl  Which order Angus plate wrong  beef bowls very nasty idk kind beef is  taste nasty no seasons  first n last time here  Thanks but no thank you    <EOR> Been eating Yoshinoya since little Im originally CA stoked see finally opened Vegas!
