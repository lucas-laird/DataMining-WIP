If ever back area its definite stop! <EOR> My husband decided try Egg Works some fasting blood work quite possibly worst breakfasts ever due poor food quality  couldn't more hungry but both meals flavorless   omelet strange burnt oil flavor though nothing seemed burned   Apparently restaurant uses liquid butter alternative translation margarine soybean oil mix instead real butter all imagine caused strange chemical taste otherwise uneventful menu choice  no real cream your coffee unless asked instead serve chemical non dairy creamer told when inquired ingredients potatoes come bag waitress couldn't really tell seasoning   opted side fruit instead   food tasted very processed gone seem days when The Egg 1st restaurant used serve homemade breakfasts actually wait for  because cooking them  to served  speed which meals served Egg Works also indicated truly processed meals are  ate little couldn't stomach taking food home though offered   noticed tables both sides also leaving much meals   When left saw U S  food delivery truck back restaurant suspicions poor food quality further confirmed    Items ordered Coffee Hash eggs Vegetable omelet w fruit side  We cannot recommend Egg Works based experience   least consumers need aware homemade food nor healthy  <EOR> Egg works does again!
