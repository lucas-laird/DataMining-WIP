Thats description Maple Tree recent visit   for breakfast course!    whatever reason we'd failed return Maple couple years   it's quite drive Downtown where always stay well know you're casino right buffet    First IMPORTANT   The Maple Tree no longer MAPLE FREEKIN SYRUP   and right menu    serve real WARM Maple syrup    Uh uh   sorry   I know MAPLE know WARM   this SYSCO COLD  Secondly arrived 7AM   they open   but only people cook owner    place absolute shambles   already cheesy indoor outdoor carpet ground into BLACK GREASY FOOD ENCRUSTED DIRT   the chairs flesh color vinyl but backs where you'd grab pull away table   was BLACK filth! As looked around noticed cobwebs lighting   the ceiling fans fuzzy least 1 2 dust buildup windward side   Errrrr matey   your galley ha scuttled O When identified myself owner Yelper! he rolled eyes back head said     Oh we're making changes around   The meal no longer mattered me   I wanted leave   but stayed paid $10 ho hum meal  <EOR> I French toast side corn beef hash  Hubby breakfast special eggs bacon pancakes   It wasn't anything spectacular  tasted fine but pretty average   It nice travel little bit outside Vegas stripe eat somewhere where residents eat at  <EOR> I really planned way around place breakfast earlier usual  little 7am because errands run near plus place bookmarked long enough!  I Asked server popular?   She says Monte Cristo New England Benedict I remember Yelp's quick tip list   fried bread but bit! I chose New England Benny because Monte Cristo before elsewhere  crab cake benedict eggs benedict but ham subsituted couple patties crab cakes instead  Clever interesting idea but wasn't impressed it  crab's flavor didn't me  hollandaise sauce typical satisfying  other half plate filled seasoned potatoes  edible just put lot ketchup pepper them! feel overcooked    The Fried Bread different story   more night day difference! Now may calorie packed creation BUT worth trying  looked loaf bread powdered sugar top maple syrup sitting bottom it  Oh Fried Goodness   Save room this!! Its Fluffy Sweet Donut Flavor! server also gave sample Pure maple syrup taste difference  Pure maple lighter flavor thinner consistency   regular maple fine   Server Very Friendly Courteous Place looked dated kinda runned down old dirty carpet lighting even worse value ok size but fried bread definitely worth it I may try Monte Cristo Maple French Toast If ever back   <EOR> I all you can eat places much next guy but much overwhelming   swear Vegas more buffets per capita anywhere else planet   Not necessarily bad thing but while can't help wondering if eating really worth paid for? Besides lot local gems if venture outside Strip   And tucked away shabby looking strip mall you'll find better breakfast spots Vegas   It looks more converted office space restaurant but food super friendly staff help forget your surroundings   I ordered New England Benny   crab meat wasn't sweet use but dish really benefited creamy hollendaise sauce   filling could only finish one     The wife fresh corn beef hash almost tasted pastrami   Good stuff   gave such healthy portion she couldn't finish breakfast either   At end meal asked if wanted leftovers  Leftovers? Now  something don't buffet  Unless course cookies accidentally home you  <EOR> First time guest service average food great  Monte Cristo Red Velvet pancakes very decadent completly worth calories  <EOR> I yelped place too   and little disappointed   only thing place orange juice super friendly service   waffles terrible!  couldn't even stand finish them!  Maybe just ordered wrong thing   point wished would've hit those breakfast brunch buffets!  even drove 5 miles strip place! UGH! <EOR> So breakfast Saturday     Wanted somthing bit less expensive hotel restaurant breakfast    read reviews Yelp figured we'd give try!

Business 101 = LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION <EOR> Checked place first time morning   little hole wall breakfast joint   Great food   Excellent service   little small but charming   would say food par Omelette House tasty kind diner style goodness   I bold New England Benny which crab cakes   Despite far ocean really tasty   They're english muffins world seems them scratch but can't say sure  <EOR> From some recent reviews really worried trying place    but searched near far around town Monte Cristo  hear best place it  Having before wanted good first impression Monte Cristo didn't wanna just anywhere! just breakfast place though closin 2pm actually set date when didn't work   Was looking forward dining while! Ending going around 1pm sometime late January  inside quite bit warm 2 other tables there  worried would dirty muggy inside but decent small old restaurant  Don't expect anything fancy!

He generally isn't fan crab cakes but likes bennys  potatoes came yummy!

Karen told crab cakes homemade definitely taste crab bunch stuffing   also add spices give nice kick   plate licked clean!  BF said next time eat he's going dish because he liked over Monte Cristo!

FYI won't accept two coupon printed 2011 Entertainment guide  learned small sign door says no coupons accepted  Oops missed way could saved embarassing moment when waitress into rant Entertainment guide group put them without permission  Well shit If owned business would honor rather making potential customer feel just comitted crime presenting coupon  bad did see tiny index card note door sue me! tacky anyways opinion   Anyways now let's onto food part     Had breakfast Omelette country potatoes toast  Toast over toasted denver style omelette dry   come really? Um impressed pal ordered pancakes sausage just ok  expect better ok restaurant many rave reviews does  understand ordered simple   however if sub par simple meals can't imagine outcome anything else    We ate paid never look back     There many mind blowing restaurants Vegas breakfast ever consider Maple Tree option   Service sucked food mediocre   They good coffee best part meal which saying much  <EOR> Went recommendation friend positive Yelp reviews   Food terrible service sub par   Menu items sound special menu though everything worse bad cafe fare   don't even provide spoons stir your coffee wooden sticks    return   If want FANTASTIC breakfast Egg Works Flamingo place awesome  <EOR> Went today breakfast purchasing groupon   hubby hollandaise skillet cousin red velvet pancakes starter omelet  hubby could licked skillet along cousin   fried bread way sweet liking   omelet good but country potatoes very good nice crispy   back again however service could use some improvements   Overall very friendly cozy  <EOR> Really good breafast food items  Love huevos rancheros gluten free pancakes  even made son mickey mouse pancake  Its hard find good gluten free food restaurants  <EOR> I wasn't really feeling place  already turned off when line door refused take names  understand completely inundated Groupon holders needed redeem but waitlist would long way  Instead everyone forced stake place line waiting seat  called groups based group size according big table available instead first come first serve which also bit off putting   After 45 minutes wait mom finally seated  drink food orders taken right away  looked around no food  good sign  staff clearly overwhelmed large crowd did best remain cheerful  waited waited waited  Finally orders came 50 minutes ordered  starving point just ate quickly wanted there  forgot fritter just them package go    The food ok nothing amazing but highly recommend fritter  fresh tasty  Everything else just basic breakfast fair  place incredibly small better organizational system would wonders them  Pleasant enough staff    I probably won't back though  <EOR>
