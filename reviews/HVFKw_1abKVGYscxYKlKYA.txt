I've looking forward trying Al's Chicago Beef since saw Food Network  found going business over  They completely Italian beef  settle sausage  Not happy impressed  Too bad  <EOR> Nope! They've missed mark one  If words Chicago  Beef name your business better bring it  did meet standards Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich  Perhaps if I'd never REAL Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich standards would lower  sausage bland beef bland mushy  bread fresh rubbery  only reason gave restaurant two stars did because service prompt I only restaurant  should red flag dining area clean  won't going back  <EOR> Well Chicago native raised Johnnies Connie's Carm's Al's looking forward true Chicago combo hot extremely disappointed combo  Call picky but cannot replicate original beef stands Chicago  took 20 min combo Johnnies would've 30 seconds  Needless say only thing I'd hot dogs fries  may Chicago signs name but far home  Buyer beware!! <EOR> Chalking review matter convenience location recently found myself West side Sahara near newly opened Al's Beef decided give shot  couple weeks ago friend took Braddah's next door someone mentioned Al's seeing check in  don't think would bothered coming but reading opening Eater then having suggested reader figured might well  Besides restaurant word 'beef' its name must serve decent burger?  The restaurant located old 50's diner looking building only some look carried inside well  space incredibly loud between blaring 50's music random TV dining room showing Dr Oz some crap volume turned way high  large expanse metal ceiling tiles hard tile floor certainly doesn't help quell any noise fact loud really yell order numbers multiple times customers point gets bit annoying  few tall stools bunch two top tables very loosely placed throughout dining area really lot open space here  menu stacked all things meat award winning Italian beef sandwich sausages hot dogs chicken sandwiches quite number pre designed burgers fries  those looking something bit lighter also offer many salads wraps   As usual kept order fairly simple could really sample basic burger offering Drive In cheese burger cheddar mustard ketchup shredded lettuce tomato mayo red onion Kosher pickles  soon ordered burger saw premade frozen looking patty pulled drawer dropped grill when bit into confirmed exact style  Maybe 'beef' Al's Beef refers more award winning sandwich  Still meat really great char flavor even its overly generic quality  Copious amounts ketchup mustard onions pickles made actually pretty good  bun fresh soft very well proportioned very large burger  recommend keep wrapping gets fairly messy  Overall bit generic burger but still quite good would even consider going back try more adventurous offerings   The fries really good natural cut some crispy skin pieces all cooked well  portion small size sufficient burger but would consider ordering large next time just eat more  all quite shocking expecting when saw patty must say pleasantly surprised  sure quality beef Italian sandwich some other items might bit better but $11 72 fries drink wasn't upset this  price point might little high many keep burgers well below $10 mark but overall size decent quality bad  <EOR> The most disgusting Italian beef ever taste shredded fatty beef jerky no flavor very expensive  no see why  Along rude cashier cook  <EOR> So second time tried place really wanted it  first time  ordered Polish Chicago Dog fries   sausage rubbery tomato pickle warm seemed mushy wernt fresh!  The second time figured ehh give whirl probably them off day!  Geez louise!  sucked again!

After opening wrap pretty soaked  XD dont want imagine double dipped would @_@ tried eating sandwich wrapped bottom but much hassle  hands =D lol    Juicy sandwich  Yes soaked bread  When ordered sandwich didn't know putting whole sausage vs sausage slices  Good bad  Depends it  Whole sausage takes space which means much beef  But if sausage whole sausage XD   As mentioned before added hot peppers  didn't really notice much  yeah overall little spicy not sure if because peppers sauce juice sandwich dipped in but wasnt spicy hoped  spicy D   Overall bad sandwich  May little small price comparison other places but cant really compare place subway anything  its just different  Would prefer maybe little bigger little more beef beef sausage combo    Service good  guy just going around collecting finished trays cleaning up  Didn't expect that  +1 D   The bathroom super cold !
