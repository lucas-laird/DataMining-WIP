Because Bobby sandwich can't help but say might best sandwich chain     I also gravitate toward getting Phili cheese sandwich  Boy load deliciously flavored meat! kinda wish could bit more cheese better peppers even tastier  Pretty awesome choice even minor flaws    If ordering two suggest going largest size sandwich splitting two rather individually choosing smallest more value  <EOR> I think must weird because knew Capriotti's won lots awards though recently far could tell wall decor reviews good too  But aside being relatively economical huge sandwich wasn't super impressed  If VOLUME your thing should drop you're doing because specialty seems massive sandwiches packed meat  small bigger prefer! But if you're interested eating healthy watching portion sizes as am all boring stuff sure I'd recommend Capriotti's  bit sad only shredded iceberg lettuce small selection toppings  bread good though  guess used loading veggies other ubiquitous sandwich place ha ha  Cap's just thing  But if took extremely chubby father law HE would love it  <EOR> This neighborhood Capriotti's  coming couple times each month since opened never disappointed quality food service  Several employee's know name know rotate between couple sandwiches try guess which going order day  Usually capastrami cole turkey  But sometimes throw them off philly even salad  One time line really long order lost within some other much larger orders  made medium instead small sandwich apologized profusely gave whole lunch free  Yesterday took good friend there  Somehow despite living town years he never Capriotti's anywhere  He said quote best meatball sub ever had! <EOR> Omg place some delicious sandwiches manager order sometimes during lunch always seem satisfy those yummy cravings  Totally recommend going favorite sandwich Bobbie  delicious <EOR> The best sandwich shop ever!

My first exposure them couple different work locations  sandwich trays catering  just kept poppin everywhere new work training location every 4 weeks   great thing catered sandwich trays 1  then free 2  try few different types sandwiches  Over time tried several  But favorite Bobby  turkey cranberry stuffing sandwich soft roll mayonnaise  mouth water  never stuffing fan kid those nasty gizzards turned off!   But nice bread cornbread stuffing without extra fluff  Damn great combination  just die for  several places around town could them just anywhere was  cant say ate them all often but used run plaza where dinner easy stop off here    Whether Vegas just visiting Capriottis  All sandwiches great but Bobby GOOOD just try out  if catering your work lunch think them all your staff enjoy   Capriotti's needs franchise bay area PLEASE!!!! <EOR> I thought found solution ordering Cap's Creation salad  year half seemed okay long ordering all toppings *except one * No major problems all time  Until today   I asked three times salad everything but hot peppers  But he kept asking want onions that? Everything but hot peppers  want dressing? Everything but hot peppers  He seemed offended when third time repeating myself asked if acceptable order  He assured but he still wanted argue it  gave left   If all toppings seems still must choose least two leave before accept your order without big argument  absolutely no idea why  <EOR> This chain sandwich shop never fails whenever LV   Regardless location taste always same delightful     I ventured off tried meat ball sub time   good but favorite still Bobbie chicken steak     Plus red velvet bundt cake delicious  <EOR> Best sandwiches earth!!!!!! love place always nice always put care into every order  feel welcomed d very satisfied when leave  <EOR> I really excited try place out  Ordered large cheese steak myself husband  While eating kept biting into something crunchy  kept spitting burnt crispy over cooked bits grill mixed into sandwich    Not best way experience sandwich suppose the best America most definitely turnoff yummy turning bite into nasty crispy whatever when hoping delicious  Really disappointed  thought found new place but instead found place stay away from    Such pity  $22 sandwich chip drink combo this  happy feeling staff doesn't care quality food served  Yuk! <EOR> Let first say am die hard Capriotti's fan life!
