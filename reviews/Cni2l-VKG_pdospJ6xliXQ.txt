Mina kollegor som inte äter fläsk bad att få byta ut baconet mot extra skiva ost vilket gick bra  På notan visade det sig att det räknats som en extra order och ökat notan med ytterligare 1$ på deras respektive burgare  Detta var inget de informerat om när de beställde  Riktigt uselt!   Om ni vill äta på en något poppigare Friday's är det ok  Letar ni delikatess burgare bör ni se er omkring efter något annat  <EOR> I think started new Vegas tradition!

I chose classic burger Angus beef skinny fries also sampled some boo's salmon burger  ordered burger medium well which think mistake because bit dry side  I think would've perfect ordered medium  However salmon burger which also ordered medium well perfect still very moist  Note salmon burger does come side  The staff overall very nice ambience great  think trendy spot really locals hang out  think place fun wouldn't mind going back but everyday experience because food quite pricey  <EOR> Beer selection great surprise   ordered medium rare burgers quite good   dessert burger fun   Overall nice but quite hoped for   OK  <EOR> This place simply amazing  Every booth table its own TV allows change channel your liking  service above beyond even text when your table ready  atmosphere great amazing music  American classic burger juicy delicious  However highlight skinny fries garlic aioli sauce  mention place renowned chef Hubert Keller  Overall place delicious must go to place if you're Vegas  <EOR> i veggie burger wheat bread peperjack cheese onion rings  great first vegas meal while waiting check in  prices reasonable service awesome  would recommend place if you're mood good burger would definitely eat again  <EOR> This place best thing Mandalay Bay  burgers delicious shakes really good too  gonna take more back into Mandalay Bay see MB review details but if craving burger Vegas would here  <EOR> Burger Bar On The Strip Dining being said really better dining options consider when you're south end Vegas Strip  burgers decent prices fairly reasonable    FOOD The burger choices menu appeal variety tastes  There's also option create your own burger masterpiece array condiments buns patties if none menu choices don't appeal your belly    On last visit kept simple ordered American Classic AC   AC basic cheeseburger onions lettuce tomatoes pickle bacon  also comes good amount crispy skinny fries  ordered burger cooked medium rare but just rare preference  medium well might better option    SERVICE I've number different occasions place always packed  When arrived Saturday afternoon before dinnertime restaurant already filled diners  choose ride those hunger pangs wait table grab empty spot bar served immediately  bar service fine but would've preferred sitting booth table   OTHER The restrooms located outside restaurant kind long trek just no matter if exit restaurant front back   OVERALL A decent dining choice located inside Mandalay Bay but would check if possible reservation advance  <EOR> Atmosphere 4 5 Service 4 5  Food 5 5 Country Natural medium rare Portabello mushroom Carmelized onion Onion bun  Juiciest most flavorful burger comparison other highly rated burger joints like Counter Kuma's Corner Fatburger Fuddruckers Five Guys Out  <EOR> We just finished your own Kobe burger cheddar cheese fried egg portobello mushrooms truffle mayo  OMG good  Among best burgers ever eaten  started off Nutella shake which also very good  Emma server very nice checked us  Thanks!!!!! <EOR> Don't order Chicken breast   it rubber tasteless   Skinny fries Kobe burger wings good  Drinks good  <EOR> So looking traditional burger bar girlfriend the yelp queen discovered establishment  thinking but hey lets try it  lamb burger jalapenos bacon   damn bomb! visit them again! <EOR> Love love love place    Its probably best burgers joints tried Vegas  American Kobe Burger super scrumptious!   My personal creation consisted of American Kobe swiss provolone avocado fresh jalapenos red onions Aioli     Above all service great! <EOR> First all most anyone probably pay burger lifetime least sure! But overpaying food humble origins just part Vegas thing good ill long made peace it  place accurate name bar because size place feel plays factor long lines  Vegas huge volumes people place smaller then allot restaurants around strip planning accordingly long way starving less  Personally say breaks place apart great places burgers much its miles better  But rather options assemble your perfect burger staggering possible combinations equally so  Think your shot burger your image then devour hungry god idea place  If your just ordering regular burger think surpass regular burgers back home might able but huge margins  <EOR> After hearing Burger Bar last two years finally chance try gourmet burgers very good  business associate both ordered Kobe Beef burger which according menu produced Snake River area  burgers cooked perfectly tasty  ordered buttermilk onion rings excellent  Maybe best onion rings ever eaten!

First off let preface saying perhaps palate isn't refined enough appreciate particular marriage ingredients   said thought blue cheese overpowering spinach gave burger unusually mushy texture slightly adventurous attempt traditional American flavor   onto something more positive   buffalo meat red flavorful when taste blue cheese wasn't overpowering   Also piece friend's Kobe Beef Burger which complete opposite far ingredients clean simple flavorful   All all think HK's burger just bit complicated may worked some just me   Everyone else seemed thoroughly satiated meals Hawaiian burger Kobe would recommend coming back? Perhaps  $20 burger pretty steep price but nothing trip craps table couldn't fix   Btw if you're thinking getting $500 burger+champagne fleur de lys SF note waitress try $60 Burger Bar which basically same thing just w o champagne pairing   Au Revoir! <EOR> Located Mandalay Bay 2nd floor Burger bar burger joint some cool offerings!

Indeed delicious  came medium rare requested first thing did try take bite without adding red wine shallot reduction  Mistake number one! Gotta pour sauce maximum flavor this  Granted caramelized onions blue cheese complemented each other well but need use sauce  Also liked bite red onions threw later barely noticed lettuce tomato which fine because just didn't want them waste plate   Did talk meat yet? Well  because saving its own paragraph  loved it  similar beef way but much cleaner flavor  somewhat hard detect unique flavor sets apart until piece mostly meat your mouth which finally did end definitely would call gamey anything  just something different appreciate because don't eat everyday well guess but can't bothered    The only drawback meal fries somehow just did burger eating two separate dishes entire time  think should've sweet potato fries instead  When tried few those friend sweetness called something would worked  those might wanna try Hubert Keller burger suggest try substitute sweet potato fries normal thin fries but might cost more? dunno    There no doubt great place Strip burger  If you're town and you're those deprived people never tried In N Out won't wrong making your burger stop  <EOR> We actually yesterday good! buffalo meat cooked perfection!

Although Rossini burger indeed tempting decided forgo $60 price tag order signature Hubert Keller burger $22   all why order owner's favorite burger? perfectly cooked order Medium rare tender flavorful buffalo meat spinach blue cheese caramelized onions lovely red wine sauce side  normally fan blue cheese but meshed well other ingredients  only slight negative burger really needed red wine sauce burger otherwise tasted lacked little seasoning  fries automatically came burger decent nice crisp outer layer   Maybe if strike big Vegas days splurge $60 gilded lily burger but now other signature burgers! <EOR> The wife took kid for Christmas day lunch  beef buffalo lamb chicken vegetarian  If want splurge $60 burger made Kobe Wagyu beef foie grais shaved truffles  Sounds amazing but would take lot pay $60 burger    Wife beef which good  Then ordered sauce sampler  Mind Hubert Keller restaurant know going good  5 sauces all amazing  great burgers well dip fries    What really topped off meal buttermilk onion rings  flavorful delicious  worked well all sauces plus housemade ranch    Go enjoy!!! <EOR> I meeting friend lunch near Excalibur hotel he's local suggested might try Burger Bar which located quick monorail moving walkway ride away Mandalay Bay he'd heard decent things it   It actually good choice!  seated right away ordered drinks ordered food soon thereafter   point service great waitress checked least 3 4 times during course meal ask if everything OK drinks never below few inches top glass before topped off though point staff did top off Sierra Mist ice water mistake    I classic burger fries which simply came lettuce tomato pickle   bit spendy $15 40 but honest best tasting burgers I'd while thought worth it   friend ordered sliders fries $13 85 also happy food   Soft drinks priced $3 75 each   Touristy Vegas prices perhaps but food good service  <EOR> Really delicious  expensive side burger if lot toppings but always delicious  Love truffle sauce every combination burger had  Service good pretty decent drinks well  <EOR> We ate location Mandelay Bay  just arrived 5 hour flight ravenous  salmon burger skinny fries very good  salmon seasoned well wasn't dry bun wasn't huge chunk bread trust difference   Now say again VERY hungry review maybe slightly off but would give another try  little pricey though but hey you're Vegas  expect? <EOR> This place joke  Hostess says order take 15 minutes  Now over 50 minutes waiting  Standing getting food other people order us  Asked 5 times where order is   Can't rate food havent tasted yet but worth terrible customer service  <EOR> For celebrity chef's burger restaurant very disappointing! sliders poor fair  First order arrived cold sent back refire cold too!

Those table burgers seemed lot more happy did    definitely burger if there  also intrigued build your own milkshake but HUGE amount food and seeing $7 price point wasn't mood one  Maybe someday! <EOR> I came Saturday two hour wait  asked when slow period said really obnoxious voice don't slow time   Um true  back during week waited 10 minutes even though empty seats walked several times during week when no wait all  key during week  OK far burgers burger cooked perfectly topping options wonderful loved caramelized onions   fries good but think would sweet potato fries next time  Also wanted shake but $8+ just crazy I mean made $5 shake Pulp Fiction appear bargain   All all good burger place would return back to  <EOR> Burger Bar?

Good sweet potato fries  Good beer selection   Highly suggest dessert burger!  Overall Good place meal Vegas isn't pricey satisfy most people    who doesn't burger?  Value Alright   with beer ended being pretty pricy meal burger joint  classy not    Quick Tips dessert burger donut cream cheese raspberry sauce etc Sweet Potato fries Don't order bunch ingredients unless order port shroom then its two burgers one  <EOR> I'd reserved lunchtime table advance group 18 seated immediately when arrived  reason chose Burger Bar aside its location full menu available us  Many restaurants Mandalay Bay Luxor offer scaled down menu group reservations which defeats purpose choosing restaurant broad menu picky eaters   I started Long Beach Tea which strong yet yummy  Then ordered Kobe beef burger cooked medium rare added baby spinach provolone  burger amazing! Its often remember menu description being 100% accurate but burger really did melt mouth  also chose steak fries which equally delicious  fact ate some cold fries over next couple days surprised tasty still were   Our server day simply outstanding  kitchen its toes well  hoping opportunity stop again during Vegas visit could try alcoholic milkshakes but unfortunately ran time  Nonetheless thoroughly enjoyed lunch experience Burger Bar definitely plan return  <EOR> I'm much burger person take review grain salt  friend really hyped Burger Bar expecting something amazing  end realized prefer 'n' Out   I just bleu cheese avocado bacon burger bacon crispy spectacular  whole though just okay  Considering spent more $50 two burgers two orders fries soda unimpressed   I've also tried Burger Brasserie Gordon Ramsay BURGR found them both delicious unique worth outrageous cost  But Burger Bar just didn't me  give another shot if someone insists but never choose place own  <EOR> My first impression place take perfectly good thing burger stuff goose livers lobster charge north $40 it  know badly want spend much burger but if find sheer force contain yourself regular burgers you'll very happy   worth 3 stars  fourth amazing selection hard find beers  beer list looks wine list  <EOR> Excellent burgers fare   Fun atmosphere   Highly recommend    Be prepared wait 60 90 minutes   don't take reservations   Best idea rotate waiting position small group friends check other shops surround grab drink wait   Great staff   Family friendly  Clean  <EOR> If want top notch high quality burger place it  turkey burger fry sampler sinful  Great onion rings fried zucchini melts your mouth  price wise affordable  loved every bit food here  still thinking it <EOR> It's really fair compare Burger Bar other Burger places  Only Strip Vegas blow $25 burger really care  actually good value considering  only 1 hand black jack most people  guarantee you'll enjoy burger way more hand black jack    The Burger bar celebrity chef Hubert Keller's creation  He few own burger combinations menu build your own extensive options  actually wish Hubert Keller would more own burgers there  only 6 listed menu  creating own but hey famous chef dazzle me    I've couple times report few different burgers  highly recommend Surf 'n Turf burger  sure says menu but think all burgers 1 2 lb  nice thick  Surf 'n Turf Black Angus Beef topped 1 2 grilled lobster tail grilled asparagus plain bun  Because believe all burgers should come cheese them add provolone it  Now pay attention next part because believe improved Hubert Keller's creation  Order some pesto mayo side  Mix together use sauce  Yum you'll never burger anywhere else    You choose different types meat your burger  trying Kobe burger last visit now  only way go  $7 more Kobe beef burger Black Angus but juicy melts your mouth  Kobe beef actually American Kobe crazy expensive real Japanese Kobe  American Kobe hybrid between Black Angus Japanese Wagyu beef  highest marbling any beef United States fine without importing actual Japanese Wagyu beef  also pick 5 different buns 45 different toppings  Toppings plain American cheese fancy pan seared foie gras    Just could try 2 burgers last visit cut them half shared them brother  Burger number 1 yourself Kobe burger  agreed provolone cheese caramelized onions sauteed oyster mushrooms onion roll  burger medium rare  result such juicy burger didn't need any mayo ketchup any other sauce  Just natural juices burger toppings perfection    Burger number 2 new menu since last time ate there  called Hubert Keller Burger  menu says favorite  buffalo burger blue cheese caramelized onions sauteed baby spinach aoli ciabatta bun  think buffalo least amount fat all burgers such found wasn't juicy  expecting maybe some different kind flavor but didn't  could just lean ground beef  also same price Kobe unless trying healthy Kobe  blue cheese kind medium which wasn't bad thing  very strong blue would over powered everything  3 far least favorite but still good    The fries ok but buttermilk zucchini fries excellent  those ranch dipping sauce  some dessert burgers menu must try sometime  use donut bun fillings cheesecake grilled pineapple example  hard save room them though perhaps deserve own visit  <EOR> Got off plane hour before showing didn't

Your line cooks miss fine detail lettuce washed cold water slapped dry stay crisp  3  Good job thin sliced red onions every thick slices onion ruins burger  4   Your skinny fries suck   If in n out fresh fries you   Also notice use stealth  coated fries them stay crispy longer   Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!  Your little square paper bags nothing more portion control tools  5  Whats funky square metal tin trays? looks cool gastro pubby but just another way some bean counter corporate figured tin flat trays cheaper plates  don't break  Buy some plates  6   Your prices beyond fair  $11 12 burger fries well done  Nice location  Nice ambiance beer coolers glass doors   Your beer taps should behind counter wall   Shorter runs less waste less foam also increase seating bar  7   good bad   Thank linen nice silverware   Next time silverware roll before eat half burger ask guy next some paper cocktail napkins wipe face? 8   don't expect change anything because place but alot people notice stuff should better  <EOR> I tried first kobe beef burger here  opted create own burger rather ones menu  decided keep add ons simple could concentrate taste flavor kobe beef  only selected carmelized onions lettuce tomato light spread mayo  liked Burger Bar offers array bread bun options  wheat highly satisfied bread beef ratio which more beef bread didn't run bread during last few bites usually case elsewhere    When done burger plate dry which earns major points because hate soggy burgers can't put down between bites because plate soggy soupy liquidy mess  also hate dry burgers but magical burger neither dry nor dripping! first!

Ordered Burger Bar Sliders could try three different burgers  Angus pretty good very basic  little dab mayo mustard perfect  next bacon burger which least favorite three because patty bit dry flavorful  last onion burger think reason Burger Bar popular  patty tender moist bite into oozing juices  caramelized onions enhances rich flavor beef mouth probably said oh em gee! If chance order sweet potato fries top off! <EOR> We lunch recently 1 day stopover Vegas overall found food really good  kobe burger fiancee tried buffalo burger  Both really tasty albeit bit overpriced but hey Vegas! If you're burger fan building your own burger then definitely try spot next time you're Vegas  <EOR> Nothing bad say place  waitress gorgeous attentive both signature bison burgers named some chef   blue cheese spinach wrapped ciabatta bread  OMG heavenly  think $20 burger but worth it   We asked seasonal Dogfish Head when she mentioned Dogfish Head 190 hooked  course beer $15 glass but made once year! both splurged helluva lunch  <EOR> Average  Average  Average  All American Burger allright but Nutella Milkshake ordered tasted nothing Nutella  bad but disappointed most part  <EOR> We waited 50 min dinner Sunday but able easily distract ourselves wait faster visiting neighboring mall stores   wait well worth it you'll study menu while figure order because only wide selection burgers drinks shakes choose but there's million different combos burgers customize   Luckily page specialty burgers don't those tough decisions   I stayed simple picked organic y grass fed beef burger cooked medium rare wheat added only swiss cheese tomato sprouts I wanted able fit burger mouth    probably shouldn't ordered anything else because couldn't finish it   But did decide do?  Since four each order four different type french fries all try each others' fries!  Fat fries skinny fries sweet potato fries seasoned fries think   few more people table probably would ordered rest types fries menu   fries good entertainment and filling but clearly burgers superstar here!  Unless huge appetite order JUST burger hard given wide menu selection you'll probably need take some go   Don't overlook drink shakes section   serve alcoholic milkshakes French Kiss Vanilla ice cream Godiva liqueur Kahlua chocolate Irish Coffee Coffee ice cream Kahlua Jameson Caramel Chocolate syrup Chocolate coffee beans    don't just drink Guinness beer   Guinness BEER FLOAT Guinness Coffee ice cream    If you're more Blue Moon beer person toss Raspberry Sorbet into glass Blue Moon   great way kill two birds stone having drink eating dessert    Learn mistakes leave room Alcoholic Milkshakes and or Beer Floats   didn't now probably excuse visit Vegas yet again try another burger variation finish off Alcoholic Milkshake! <EOR> Took bit locate Burger Bar but glad did!

He really knows create burger! ate Surf Turf Burger  Its Black Angus grilled half lobster grilled green asparagus plain bun  paired meal Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat beer   Good times! <EOR> not bad    bad     my boyfriend shared make yourself burger australian kobe beef $17 75 + 2 slabs foie gras $13 each + portabello mushrooms $1 50? + truffle sauce $5 50?   burger some reason came really lukewarm  mmm   no lukewarm  more cold if sitting awhile  kind bummer even though food itself tasted good  would much better delivered freshly cooked    i loved skinny fries  crispy delicious  ordered side truffle mayo dip $5 REALLY yum  also ordered pepper jack cheese shots which basically mozzarella sticks except pepper jack shaped into ball rather stick  those came some type buttermilk ranch sauce okay but again would better if come directly fryer    i give place three stars because located mandalay bay WAY far especially 110 degree heat because heat didn't translate onto food   but $13 piece foie gras    legit! <EOR> It best damned burger whole entire life thus far! Sorry Chez Maman you'll best locally  Anywho ordered mine kobe beef medium rare having cooked any other way blasphemy foie gras pepperjack cheese portabello mushrooms onion bun w truffle sauce  SOOOO JUICY  TENDER    With each bite succulent kobe beef juice would just drip end burger  Before each bite i'd pour bit truffle sauce into anticipated bite  Each mouthful pure bliss    I just didn't care sweet potato fries much although boyfriend kobe beef burger 1 2 lobster he said he wouldn't order again  other hand would DEFINITELY order burger made   Too bad there's long wait isn't San Francisco!!! Oh don't worry missing any games  plenty flat screen tvs above bar but each booth its own individual flat screen well! D  Be ready drop some dollar dollar bills y'all because pricey if eat do  Then again Vegas    <EOR> I realy thought we'd wait table long time but seated pretty quickly may 5 minutes around noon Saturday!  May most peeps sleeping night partying? I almost almost ordered grilled chicken burger since trying watch eat since getting married June but OMG glad wised ordered Kobe burger!!!   best burger ever date   ordered burger medium aioli grilled onions wheat bun  cooked perfection  didn't order any fries stole skinny fries df boy quite good! Just way them  Service attentive friendly    server really top things     My df FBIL ordered buffalo burger said very good though df thought burger could've cooked little more he ordered medium but looked medium rare    FSIL Christine T  ordered kobe beef burger also but she ordered medium rare  She said she should've ordered medium instead   Must chocolate burger!!  four shared just enough taste   If craving burger going hit San Francisco location hopefully just good! <EOR> I LOVE Burger Bar  much  local really try avoid Strip much possible  But place become staple family  When think burgers think Burger Bar   so well worth drive down Strip there   Depending when dictates long wait is  waited anywhere 10 minutes over hour  won't seat unless everyone your party present which appreciate having worked restaurant industry if you're waiting people arrive recommend least getting your name list  way when everyone DOES arrive just let hostess know your party ready your wait time shortened   It's usually pretty loud there  If you're looking quiet meal definitely isn't place go  bit sports bar feel sports games playing both big screens small TV screens inside booths  But everybody always seems having good time still manage conversation table without having shout anybody   They Chef's burgers menu also build your own options burgers milkshakes both alcoholic not   non beef options such chicken turkey salmon  even veggie burger specialty vegan burger along various salad options all non meat eaters there  All Chef's burgers come skinny fries but change those any other side options  I usually opt sweet potato fries  If build your own add those side options $3 6   I personally am OBSESSED Hubert Keller burger  mean dream burger  wake craving it  then bug everyone know give excuse one  buffalo burger topped sauteed baby spinach caramelized onions blue cheese  Each component burger compliments every other component  comes Red Wine Shallot reduction side just puts burger over top  took couple visits dad try he scared buffalo meat some reason but practically shoved bite down throat now he's hooked  Buffalo meat amazing!  A close second in opinion would Peppercorn burger  If you're fan pepper mustard burger you   Then course milkshakes  Holy crap! yummy! both Nutella Salted Caramel milkshakes  Both delicious  When ordering shakes decorated beautifully  Very artistic  But also order them to go they'll put plastic cup nice wide straw take you    I also recommend Creamy Cheese Cake burger  dessert alternative milkshake filled sweetened cream cheese caramelized pineapple  bun made fresh donuts! Mmm Mmm! They're little small though so   unless just want bite recommend skipping Let's split dessert part conversation just keep all yourself   We've never once bad experience here  servers always friendly mindful any modifications burgers always cooked perfection  Service little slow though  Depending busy may hard track down said server drink refills extra sauce  once take your order expect sitting twiddling your thumbs 15 20 minutes nothing table but beverages  also longer wait dessert burgers  But! cook everything order completely understandable well worth wait  <EOR> This isn't bad but isn't good either  going back forth should rate place decided five  following reasons    Food mean they're nothing really notable it  You  your own burger choose chef's special  Now take away extraordinary options vegetarian healthy food  guess  nice touch    I turkey burger while girlfriend hangover burger  turkey clean but basic price  $11 50 expecting something could bring wow factor  served burger veges side feels tad bit elementary  While burger pretty big didn't think seasoned well  basically rely ketchup heighten entree  meal also didn't come side bit disappointing   The hangover burger tasted pretty good but just turkey burger nothing notable it  side special sauce which couldn't live its name  meal came fries looks soggy made bad representation fries are  embarrassing    Overall don't think would come back here  good try but very basic  <EOR> Excellent burgers here  good return visit trip back Vegas  High quality ingredients great customizability  Tough burger here  sides onion rings sweet potato fries much less impressive  beer menu decent but could definitely use upgrade  If come burger don't want break bank probably best option end strip  <EOR>
