Table side guacamole fresh salsas quite tasty  <EOR> The food Cabo solid but nothing unique  same type menu items find most Mexican restaurants days  However execution those items pretty good  steak chimichanga tender flavor great  outside chimichanga fried perfectly  light crispy  didn't smother cheese  just right amount top  wife's chicken tacos lacked flavor but adding some salsa helped  speaking salsa chips salsa bring good along guac bean dip  cheese quesadilla appetizer big enough 3 4 people also cooked perfectly  service great  waiter always stopping check if needed anything refill drinks  good experience all around  <EOR> I still give 4 stars because food really tasty  minus salsa isn't very good I however bad experience when eating last time feel need know about   We ordered special time where Fajitas Margarita $9 99  When came time pay check server said she needed Stations Reward Cards discounted price $9 99 without your card don't price happened mine handy gave along $45 pay meal asked change  looked receipt when home noticed she used stations card pay meal point card cash which leads believe she pocketed cash  She did bring change back but said $7 told keep tip  wish would payed attention receipt then but just didn't trusted she said  I called Reward Center told them hat happened wanted points put back card absolutely unacceptable  She agreed assured someone Food Beverage would contacting me  Well 3 phone calls 2 e mails cannot anybody respond complaint  even person Cabo said person off would them contact me  This FRAUD  never ever back location   can't believe Stations which caters mostly locals would allow something happen?! I always check receipt any Stations now encourage pay attention well  just upsetting  <EOR> Ate while staying Red Rock  casino level hotel  OK say front already little drunk when here    but still good   The wait staff attentive    perhaps little much  felt little rushed through meal  slow eater especially when comes fajitas talking friends   The sangria good but best ever had    But still 4 stars solid plate food good drink  <EOR> Cabo Mexican Restaurant another example Red Rock could better    Come people Mexican food  Norweigan grandmother better Mexican food this   The special prices reasonable food edible just anything you'll write home about  made mistake ordering ribeye Mexican restaurant once  Probably worst cut beef outside prison jk tough all sinew   Still applaud $9 fajita AYCE tacos special    Like said edible just memorable  <EOR> I've several times but never reviewed before   tonight great meal   Standard chips 4 salsas brought   salsas tomatillo fire roasted tomato regular tomato salsa bean dip   They're all good but favorite fire roasted   We started table side made guacamole very good   spicy because wife ultimate gringa   put all peppers side bowl server finished   gringa she ask?

OMG please 20 something girls behind bar sadly lacked personality service skills     I gave 4 stars because food really good tacos quesadillas salsa's all very tasty reasonably priced but service star  <EOR> Strawberry mojitos taquitos great!! Wings gross but orders wings mexican place? Chips dip great <EOR> Hit place happy hour yesterday   Happy hour menu $3 $4 $5   Drinks food each price point but only good bar when 5 30 bar bumping     I tried guacamole only $4 happy hour!    Nothing spectacular but good thing chopped jalapenos side   friend into spicy food am just added ton guac plate   Woo hoo!

Foiled again!  Off Grand Cafe   I update now know close 9 00 p m  much early casino restaurant IMHO  <EOR> The chips very fresh tasty accompanying salsa bean dip also quite good  ordered table side guacamole quite yummy also  entrees somewhat disappointing just average  rice beans dry side didn't lot flavor  shrimp shrimp tacos very fresh but okay  price right but hoping something little more  <EOR> Cabo predictable  Good quality Mexican food prepared promptly without fuss  tableside guacamole memorable all eat tacos special very good deal  Service could bit better server bussing tables cleaning well serving food earned good tip impressed well he kept things running  don't blame server blame management staffing appropriately  ordered ice tea drink which kinda ho hum didn't sugar sweeten it  just those things  short   it's casino food but Station Casinos flagship property  missing seriously good salsa bar Cabo Sunset Station has   but overall won't wrong eating here  <EOR> Stopped quick bite during happy hour  ordered strawberry mojito best ever had  only $4 bucks  also ordered some taquitos  sure came fast! They very good plenty them  I bring hubby back next day pre Weezer drinking spot since HH prices pretty amazing  We able find spot bar lit before show cheap! awesome  Service great drinks even better  I set mommy's night end month much  <EOR> Let say I'd Cabo @ Palace Station wasnt impressed but willing try again since area rare occasion  I live Hendo SERVICE star deducted service b c guy mute  dont think he actually said more everything ok? maybe once  If water refilled silent  Plates arrived someone else  and she warned Hot plate   maybe 2 3 syllable rule werent told about     FOOD where earned star back  wow  damn  good  The chips first off those super thick delicious tostadas which means u count each eat overboard Salsa came form 3 types salsa 1 red 1 molcajete brown salsa 1 chile verde bean dip  omg freakin good  I ordered chicken fajitas die for  sheesh louise ate all chicken veggies no tortillas but came w guacamole sour cream side w cilantro  good    my bf ordereed chile relleno good but nowhere near realm goodness mine  wow  im getting hungry just thinking them but already ate late lunch    Best part meal check  $10 off coupon any station casino sent mail  Cant it  both plates around $12 14  2fer  Cant   beat  it  <EOR> Very poor service  waiter told no ripe avocados guacamole  When main dishes arrived two three them avocados which tasted fine hard  later ordered guacamole bus person brought some within two minutes  Won't coming back again  <EOR> The food good but service horrible   sad when ask 3 different times side sour cream 20 minutes drink   wait staff dropped off food vanished   sure if magic show restaurant   only thing know sure going back place  <EOR> I yet eat bad restaurant Red Rock hotel  They're doing something right  really satisfying meal Cabo  mention HUGE  Talk Las Vegas portions all plates bigger face    This first Mexican restaurant gives 3 different salsas refried beans your tortilla chips munch before your meal  beans awesome although farting all night  should taken those Bean O things because supposedly there'll Bean O gas  Anyway worth it  3 huge tacos w rice beans 12 99? shabby   Although didn't quite feel Cabo don't rush door great place come eat hang friends couple hours  also saw good number people dates well  back eat Cabo again since Red Rock pretty often late  <EOR> Don't know why particular Cabo over Palace Santa Fe locations but always seem end visits back   never seem time happy hour but pricewise par most chain places little better quality   Mom always said don't fill chips salsa before dinner but she never theirs spicier better  Good enchiladas plenty cheese fajitas tasty but easy onions next time   Dessert options so so just another margarita instead big into fruit ritas but strawberry hit spot   One drawback don't expect every restaurant Vegas 24 hours but best 9 weeknights? Just idea    <EOR> Cheap good two words come mind  rather fond $12 tender chicken fajitas $4 75 Modelo  would again  thus though generally avoid half star math think 3 5 star meal    The reasons didn't push through 4 star 1  atmosphere  am sure why exactly but main dining area feel am college dining room  back room private events spacious filled light but front space lacks character   2  Chips salsa  salsa trio didn't light fire   3  Delayed greet  odd pet peeves service  really bothers when takes longer 30 seconds greeted server took several minutes  Once greeted service good but first impressions matter!  Overall good meal  said would again  <EOR> I've tried Cabo's bar area couple times while waiting friends arrive movie dinner another restaurant really familiar full menu   margaritas rather potent they're kind enough Chip Dip if you're just sitting bar   can't imagine 45 oz  margarita would person but option destroy yourself there     I treated smash drink menu other day smaller form strawberry mojito best thing Cabo!  Next time order cool off 108* we're all roasting at  <EOR> we're san diego mexican places tough competition comparisons   margaritas great    perfecto pomegranate   disappointed   chips salsa good since give 3 different salsas refried beans   entrees just okay    carnitas especial   waiter attentive  <EOR> I  Would given Cabot 4 stars but 1st time 48oz margaritas $10 00 closed Last night dinner  still serve 48oz margaritas $10 00 The food very good service friendly knowledgable fast  Overall fun dinner experience  prices very reasonable recommend going <EOR> I liked place! came during happy hour mid week   found decor interesting which important having things catch eye  strange Disney looking pile TV screens hanging over bar certainly interesting though can't say its type decor clashed reddish orange theme space  I add aren't more colors red orange new restaurants? starting tired color palette! Anyway interior pleasant  sat bench style seating along casino sufficiently comfortable  don't tall bar chairs those too   place full all geeky waiter bit forgetful quite pleasant   tried every single happy hour appetizer offered embarrassing but night drown my sorrows night deserved them   The cheese dip good  LOVE cheese  must mouse previous life  real cheese Velveeta smooth stuff other restaurants sell food  guacamole good but add salt bring flavor  chips heat lamp warm rather freshly made warm but no complaints did job tasted fine  liked chicken wings crisp moist tasty!   I enjoyed chicken mini tacos liked them even better accompanying pico de gallo  quesadillas boring skip those next time   chimi taquitos all right fried rolled flour tortillas stuffed some kind meat  think full time them I'd probably little more enthusiastic  not  just all right    I prefer authentic Mexican cuisine but settle tasty chain restaurant level Mexican when need fun fix    may raving over food service could little more attentive but is  No major complaints keep coming back   If staying Red Rock I'd hang bit  <EOR> MMMMMM  I love place!  chips salsa yummy   Especially green salsa!  recommend fajitas   Every now then special $7 99 so    The only downside open 4pm   should open lunch!!!!! <EOR> Camerones mojo de ajo  Delicious! shrimp sauteed olive oil garlic chilies  combination yummy  asked side corn tortillas could own little fajitas  comes along side salad tomato vinaigrette dressing really good since never heard dressing before  side veggies shrimp came bit buttery me  must order homemade guac made fresh table  large bowl hopefully few people enjoy otherwise you'll find yourself eating whole bowl yourself  washed down meal raspberry margarita  little sweet side but good anyway! <EOR> This place totally unexpected  moving Vegas two weeks ago mood some Mexican food husband mood some Texas Hold'Em    Anyhow greeted promptly seated despite being 7pm Saturday night  warm basket chips 3 salsas refried beans dipping already happy girl    but then when searching drink menu type margarita wanted saw pink blue cotton candy beverage topped cotton candy try  pink very pleased delicious!  I asked waitress entree recommendation she said favorite chicken suiza  OH GOD  never EVER dish flavorful chicken moist ultimately mind blowing  Mexican food never impressive! husband ordered cheese enchiladas also pleased  would say though portions overwhelming  enough but much previous yelpers mentioned    For dessert fried ice cream  Basically vanilla ice cream covered corn flakes chocolate caramel sauces perfect! All desserts only $2 50 petite but perfect ending meal    Overall excellent meal back    Red Rocks quickly become favorite casino  Also if weather nice patio seating well worth it  Gorgeous surroundings  palm trees water etc  would guess ambience outside <EOR> I came Friday night just hang kick off weekend  seated bar because restaurant already closed @ 9?! bartenders umm well very attentive  Granted drunk @$$holes sitting next but don't think  good enough reason ignore me  When FINALLY order just chips salsa cuz kitchen closed! weren't sure if order ever put bartender  When confused guy came kitchen plate chips salsa pounced sure if order  thank god  salsa decent but beans which provide chips AMAZING!! Highly recommend!! kicked half hour later which capable drive yet  disappointed hours place considering CASINO! <EOR>
