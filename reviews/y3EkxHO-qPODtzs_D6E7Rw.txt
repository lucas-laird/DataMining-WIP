If China Hong Kong Macau can't really expect great service  sooner restaurant better more customers   good business  Don't expect smile warm fuzzies  But Pearl Ocean only 60% vibe  server smiley friendly apologetic hiccups  Whereas China if mistake mad pointing out   The food   there some dishes really well executed some just ok   Mongolian Beef Buns 3 buns stuffed Mongolian beef I feel just rephrased it   ok  Tasty meaty but greasy 3 5   Shrimp Dumplings XO Sauce Slightly spicy  Dumpling skin bit chewy 3 5   Pork Dumpling Chili Peanut Sauce bit misleading  did taste peanut all  spicy burning yet cool tongue if licked your skin Ben Gay accident experimentally lick strip Salonpas exactly that!
