Read inspirational message put wall above kitchen  Maybe should displayed kitchen staff chef rather diners  The food terrible  eaten downtown location several times much better! Ordered eggs benedict found them strange concoction chewy bread giant roasted tomato slice which took over all flavors thin slice weird chewy dry chicken breast replacing traditional Canadian Bacon sautéed spinach just OK very sour hollandaise  could tell house which nice but way much lemon it  Made whole dish sour  eggs overcooked but staff nice enough quickly bring 2 new eggs cooked right way   The roasted potatoes throw every dish such great success all left them untouched plates  sad  The grilled cheese sandwich greasy inedible  cheap cheddar cheese use inside shameful  daughter ate barely half sandwich before putting down saying she's nauseous feels she's going throw up  tomato soup came tasted more something some pieces bad mozzarella which simply turned into rubber heat soup  The Devilled eggs breaded fried which guess another chef's attempts being clever but only served dish greasy heavy  flavor filling very bland only thing giving some flavor Sriracha sauce Bacon sprinkle top  egg itself completely lost composition  The only thing managed right 2 sunny side eggs 2 strips bacon cooked right but then also came terrible potatoes 2 pieces burnt toast no couldn't even single dish kitchen without terrible flaws   Generally someone should tell chef more always better  Overcomplicating throwing everything but kitchen sink into eggs benedict doesn't improve traditional recipe!  with tax tip paid $104 4 people breakfast left all bit queasy   Again place very nicely designed staff absolutely wonderful  Unfortunately  enough really bad very overpriced food  $12 2 sunny side eggs 2 strips bacon some really bad potatoes burnt toast much  better Denny's less half price serve better potatoes won't burn your toast!
