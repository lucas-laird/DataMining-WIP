There's also gelato station shaved ice station coconut gel grass jelly mung beans  asian specialty  Very simple food yet complex flavors texture  Uhm oh yea  If you're used shabu shabu style eating    this little different  If your first time  little messy    yes if don't use chopsticks then there's gonna little mess  also different types noodles into boiling pot death  very difficult noodles pot   So really want back again  wanna try stuff menu just hot pot   also wish served liquor  But because other menu wasn't offered noodles hard pot there's no liquor    I'll give 4 stars  GREAT PLACE!
