They busy restaurant service good great   takes while waiters come take your order  <EOR> BUZZ Garlic Prawns 4 10 Drunken Noodles  I ALSO TRIED Tom Kha Kai w Chicken 5 10 Penang Curry w Beef 4 10 First off haven't written review really long time! love fact travel decent amount work try lot new places write reviews  Ironically because travel haven't able write any reviews lately  many jam packed 1 day travels might check hotel Yelp but knock 20 seconds then wake shower leave all while still kinda sleeping  Even meals rushed  business dinners might nice restaurants but we're having such fierce conversations work food might well just teleported into stomachs without ever being tasted   OK now  way little history  Pad Thai used thought Thai food was  Yes know Thai food but mean thought all Thai food was! 2007 Lotus Siam ordered all sort things amazing  Since then discovered more facets Thai food namely Tom Kha Penang Curry  Ever since tried those dying try them Lotus because touted some best Thai restaurant planet!  TOM KHA KAI Server asked spicy wanted then said scale 1 10  taken aback because  really wide range! Even though normally order Extra Spicy other Thai places numbers intimidated bit just said 8   It tasted fine but didn't anything would taste great  No landmines  good  chicken seasoned enough but dry  Tom Kha and maybe just style missing tiny bit sweetness come expect  spice first spoonful thought duped but then 3 more spoons heat started rise! enough grab water but enough where taking bites hot garlic prawns painful tongue  really seemed if just soup 8 would actually 6 but think higher number more pepper bits soup just higher chance picking those peppers themselves pack punch!  PENANG CURRY Sigh  missing almost nutty flavor come little ginger y lemongrassy like  Consistency much condensed milk spice level 8 tasted more 4  beef didn't really lend any helpful flavors but hey least protein! worst ever but just really disappointed considering many people favorite Thai restaurant  Then again could just different styles which admittedly don't know much about   GARLIC PRAWNS I remember when little friend mine used eat shrimp tail  mesmerized! never even tried before  fearlessly started trying eat tail almost point gagging  Fast forward 25 years am Lotus Siam    The shrimp comes looking letter w  left u shrimp right u shell shrimp both still connected tail  whole thing seasoned deep fried  Now Japanese sweet shrimp before where fry heads better eating shrimp tail many years ago but couldn't eat more 1  definitely better but took lot mental psyching determination eat several    The shrimp good  shell actually pretty tasty  all fried shrimp shell best  more crunchy crispy any other far  buttery flavor helped take mind off shell  if took bite shrimp bite shell tumultuous bite fight urge spit out  trick eat shell itself big shrimp chip  other thing keep mouth dry  Once took bite keep saliva away sorry technical definitely resist urge wash down  When shell dry crispy shattered easier which meant ground down finely easy swallow   like chip  soon moisture introduced shell no longer wanted shatter instead would just flex which meant when swallowed rough shell like texture made want gag    So all all happy tried but perfectly fine never trying again   LOTUS DISAPPOINTMENT I can't tell disappointed curry soup  waiting least 4 years opportunity come Vegas try dishes didn't deliver  say place isn't good  great meals but they're good fav dishs <EOR> Best Thai restaurant US?

The menu Lotus Siam extensive menu split into regional cuisine  Northern Southern etc  bf decided early would eat lunch buffet instead arrived around 11 45 am restaurant already pretty packed  Lotus Siam opens 11 30 am lunch buffet served 11 30 am 2 30 pm    For $10 99 person lunch buffet worth price because many different options steamed stir fry fried select from  your standard sliced fruit green melon watermelon pineapple salad  Thai food included steamed white rice Thai fried rice chow mein pad thai pad see ew chicken green curry tofu stir fry another vegetable stir fry  fried food included egg rolls curry wontons tempura delicious fried bananas! also 2 types soups available hot sour soup soup clear broth  bf preferred soup clear broth vegetables    For stand dishes pad thai green chicken curry! Both tasty green chicken curry large chunks both vegetables chicken  even back seconds curry!   The service good  looked only 1 2 people working front restaurant waters refilled    Bottom line Thai place may off strip but well worth drive good AYCE Thai food  If return probably order off menu next time compare AYCE food  <EOR> This place boasts itself being absolute best Thai restaurant Las Vegas  matter fact walk number awards accolades write ups place   I came friend ordered three dishes split between two entres appetizer   To start ordered stuffed chicken wings  least favorite ordered  lacked seasoning opinion   Next ordered Sweet Sour chicken beef Pad Thai  Both dishes terrific  Pad Thai came thinner style noodles normall expect Pad Thai but still very good!  I wasn't particularly crazy service didn't clear cut server kept changing weren't sure ask what  Also prices sort high Thai food but maybe because comparing LA?  Overall bad I'd actually again but knows many incredible dining options Vegas just may while before do   Food 3 5 Ambience 2 5 Service 3 Value 3 <EOR> Amazing fresh authentic food    wish I'd thought ask more guidance before ordering    would great big group order able sample more    <EOR> 3rd time here  would given 5 stars but reservation time opening 5 30 Garlic Shrimp par previous experiences  They cold harder fresh  Seems 2 hours pre cooked since popular dish want ahead  But since expensive best dish should fresh all time clients wouldn't mind wait  rest ordered dishes good always  <EOR> Takeout sub par  Thin watery curry raw potatoes really small portions all meat three dishes very dry  ok  <EOR> Why closed Sat afternoon oh Lotus Siam!

Even if biased hunger marginal thai food before   place fantastic would definitely back  <EOR> Once again surprised quality Asian choices once off Strip   time Thai Southeast Asian     But first alarmed when actually find place   very shabby strip mall well off Strip few crappy stores eateries few boarded places smattering panhandlers transients trying real hard politically correct    Look past all front door prepare pleasantly amazed   Very large restaurant crowded hell wine cellar in Thai place must Vegas thing    Bit wait but intolerable   Polite knowledgeable staff willing take time explain enormous menus really help your selection   Started off deep fried tofu beef larb off very good start   variety main courses just ridiculous amount offerings choose from   Finally settled Rad Na Nua Nam Tok Koi Soi all prepared well plenty eat enough share   good sampling future visits   Strong but strong Thai Ice Tea wash all down   Just remember suck your way inside   Well worth it <EOR> Scuzzy outside creepy parking lot 40 minute wait  tiny price pay eat here!

Must try all soups   Stuffed chicken wings something can't pronounce! <EOR> I love place  Delicious food such great flavors  dinner since some negative reviews lunch buffet am disappointed  ordered garlic prawns south Thai beef noodle dish Chilean sea bass flat noodles  Even though weren't hungry other food destinations demolished everything  wished ordered garlic prawns just myself because unsightly stab others hand fork fought last piece  shrimp fried well smart  mean actually separate meat shell shell comes shrimp chips  reasons coming back Vegas come back eat again  <EOR> I twice now does disappoint  came once dinner once lunch  Other bums parking lot asking money place spot when comes Thai food    I tried pad thai panang curry chicken amazing seafood dish assorted seafood veggies die sauce  Everything really good flavorful came pipping hot    This place super busy all time  did come lunch Tuesday gentleman sitting next told try soup day only served Tuesdays he said he coming back every Tuesday over 10 years  Next time am trying soup he suggesting  <EOR> Been many times great food line long plan come LA celebrate wife BD 14 friends called last week reservation Saturday accept reservation Saturday night  agreed Sunday night instead required minimum agreed said send email fill information require deposit waiting calling today no email them  We called another Thai Restaurant same street beautifully set Saturday also pastries chef beautiful cake wife venue clean beautiful  If happen same situation look around find restaurant try love place pastries food most important thing services  Adios Lotus Siam  <EOR> Bomb seafood soup padsee yew  Green curry okay felt better  bit blander sweet  Chicken great  Awesome service place ALWAYS packed  Great atmosphere <EOR> It become tradition fiance comeand eat every single time Vegas  service food phenomenal  cheap thai restaurant  actually bit expensive but worth every penny  ingredients quality food superb    You even see all celebrities well known figures coming restaurant picture owner wall  Even top chefs all over world come eat! seriously good! always prawns sausage suer tasty! am bit boting also pad see ew thai tea but its yummy just can't help myself  But more known Northern Thai cuisine highly recommend select specialties instead  <EOR> Its larger inside looks curb   There's no signage street because all storefronts face interior parking lot   boyfriend asked quiet area waiter sat corner larger dining room   Drunken noodles prawns larger dish seafood version but surprised shrimp fried   Even though told only several shellfish dish lasted until lunch next day   I enjoyed young jackfruit red curry catfish Northern Thai menu   I'd back here   glad decided keep reservation instead eating evening reception hotel   Mango isn't season couldn't sticky rice dessert   Thai iced tea wasn't dyed orange     The Chang beer comes branded glass   ordered beef wontons appetizer but sweet sour sauce could spicier despite jalapeno container   We'd probably take co workers here  <EOR> After hearing raves place Food Network shows stop during Vegas visit    We ordered Crispy Duck Panang Nam Prik Ong Combination Fried Rice  portions aren't huge you're probably used other Thai places but enough fill two people up    The Crispy Duck Panang clear highlight meal  tender duck crisp skin spicy creamy panang sauce  1 10 spicy level 6 perfect amount spice it  Definitely don't discard basil garnish  mix sauce eat your rice  Yum! comes small pot sticky rice don't really need order extra rice but fan Thai fried rice combination too   The Combination Fried Rice good  any better other Thai fried rices had  chicken wasn't particularly moist tender only came 2 shrimps  would probably stick just beef fried rice shrimp fried rice since chicken didn't really add anything dish   The Nam Prik Ong really came  I'd heard Ming Tsai raving Food Network's Best Thing Ever Ate  honestly underwhelmed  sure if just having off batch but wasn't complex flavorful expected be  expecting spicy earthy flavors herbacious Thai basil cilantro maybe some lime acidity  bit heat but pretty one note  reminded more tomato based chili anything    All all see why people flock place  menu really huge prices aren't bad considering you're Vegas    The strip mall located honestly really sad run down looking but once you're inside ambiance isn't bad  <EOR> been seeing place pop yelp whenever search thai  man oh man over 3 500 almost five stars!   i want say pretty good! but wouldnt say best ever does some pricier dishes    even thai tea thai coffee $5  seafood but even duck around $28 well  note ahead duck because really good   in fact just update review because hard find fried duck curry elsewhere  <EOR> Holy crap place good   having eaten mediocre room service food hotel food day half girls decided venture away strip eat dinner   Well worth it!

It hidden gem because isn't best areas plazas Las Vegas   But people know where because made name itself     It's small dining area which its cozy   All all if thai food vegas don't mind straying away strip would recommend going there  <EOR> Some people deem restaurant best Thai food world  wouldn't far fair share across globe but definitely better restaurants Vegas Thai  location far exceptional but staff friendly food extraordinary  If come weekend without reservation prepared extreme wait time  <EOR> Big Fan Mrs  Redd's pies!!! Every flavor especially lemon  But am missing them terribly since Food 4 Less closed Vegas Valley  It most unfortunate Kroger chain does carry every store   ie Smith's  Delicious!!! <EOR> All want say is    NO!!

Took mediocre photo bad lighting hotel room BUT food anything but  <EOR> This review based having lunch buffet which available weekdays $10 99  Long story short wouldn't recommend place lunch buffet because only food meh but service horrendous   When host asked many party seated  told them friends already asked if minded if took quick peek around corner see if seated already  host said no problem walked past him  looking 5 10 seconds he walks back front says maybe they're yet if call liars try seat anyways  walked back towards entrance call friends see where were  host follows around whole time if we're allowed walk freely lobby  He continued challenge even told nicely friends texted seated somewhere inside before even walked in  eventually found party which seated towards back  ignored host just made way towards them    After being seated impossible someone stop table ask questions buffet menu  thought ordering off menu but group wanted buffet thought why not? Once started eating only time saw server when needed refills water soda  No ever stopped ask doing took plates  even grabbed some plates threw them empty bar where nobody sitting because piling up  also grab own sauces napkins waiters' supply corner   no customer service whatsoever but Asian restaurant knows if even care  also very many people noon lunch hour compared would expect when experiencing lapse service  Maybe 2 3 restaurant full if even  restaurant completely full would've taken into account  also some confusion when paying bill seems hostess' don't know they're doing either   The buffet featured items such chow mein pad thai garlic wings mint chicken other typical buffet foods  selection small only 2 tables worth food  Most food bland pad thai especially some fried items 90% dough much filler egg rolls fried banana examples   only thing really ate more couple bites chow mein garlic wings   show really just filled wings  really would expect Thai restaurant   While eating already thinking going word review because unhappy entire meal  Keeping mind only buffet want back try ordering items menu  However service real turn off better service fast food joints today Lotus  doubt we'd back future  sure place Zagat rating because pretty sure service counts something  <EOR> Not particularly magical place bad 80's diner decor  food pretty good   but overrated  ricekrispy sausage bit thing appetizer northern thai dish jackfruit dried sliced fish then sea bass steamed red chili  lime juice singha beer  Sea bass best dish somewhat pricey $23 but served bed wilted cabbage which kind disappointing said vegetables   driced sliced fish recommendation waiter but flavor overwhelmed   Free rice which cool  I'd come again try some other things menu extensive  <EOR> Growing Southeast Asian cusine very excited place all rave reviews articles written posted all over waiting room   I confess came few times over last couple years which am embarrassed say   but defense Thai food lover midst didn't know where else satisfy Thai food crave    But last time there   I swore come back  I two comments place 1 OVER RATED 2 OVER PRICED  course qualifies worst Thai restaurant ever to   Don't know what's wrong those white people writing rave reviews place those magazines  snobs pretended know they're talking she probably fed them magic mushroom during reviews  You don't need Thai food know good  Don't save yourself some money take your friends family authentic place doesn't rip off because can  <EOR> Yes    good ratings suggest  Better fact  I live AZ am sad can't come daily  IT F'ING AMAZING! <EOR> This best Thai food ever had  Highly highly recommend soft shell crab drunken noodles crispy duck panang  Came Vegas weekend California grateful boyfriend adamant trying place  <EOR> Really popular place pretty good food   location absolutely terrible but guess kind adds experience   definitely don't want walk place las vegas blvd  if staying there   Don't think back  <EOR> A bit pricey but worth every cent! food excellent large selection choose from   appetizers soups salads chefs specials   a 12 scale 1 10!

Thanks all your reviews  just found new great place Thai!!!! <EOR> One best Thai restaurants Las Vegas US     encountered many Thai restaurants good one    Really crummy area but food worth it     <EOR> I returned lunch year  ordered roasted duck red curry fried shrimps pineapple fried rice stuffed chicken wings  recommended stuffed chicken wings  impressed first time visited  time experience totally different impressive   feel paid high price average Thai food  <EOR> First time customer came highly recommended local friends  Location situated very nice area which sister's friend conveniently forgot mention  Sunday dinner waited 10 minutes bar  spacious clean eating area walls full wine selection  Ordered only few dishes which Fried Prawns delicious $32 only 8 pcs Steamed Sea Bass not recommending dish very small serving Fried Rice very small serving well Chicken Satay appetizer  Its suppose family style serving but say portions small  Verdict its good try but wont back  pricey location scary  Reservation needed other nights sure  <EOR> Really enjoyed place  If venture your common traditional Thai dishes Pad Thai Pad see ew place you  really need venture when comes Thai food place gives perfect opportunity so    We drove off strip check place  plaza next some Korean Club Karaoke joint  going lie but definitely wanted check Korean place out  Maybe some other time    We bottle White Wine sticky rice appetizer Crispy Duck Panang Curry Garlic Prawns Drunken noodle crab    Honestly food phenomenal  only issue felt portions small pretty pricey amount food is  Obviously if restaurant Lotus Siam gets much hype probably charge whatever want  would definitely come back again  time hope win money Vegas order more food without feeling bad it  Haha  <EOR> Excellent local jewel close heart Las Vegas  size line outside doors before opening time indicator quality food inside  far best massaman  curry states highly recommend it  Panang curry wonderful well but watch spice level heat intensity high dish  Again excellent choice authentic Thai cuisine  <EOR> Having unique perspective being raised Thailand coupled 15 years food business could say am qualified authority Thai food however really true authority anything food drink taste buds person eating  most folks eat love it  Having said just don't Lotus Siam  Sure good curries balanced salads noodle dishes tasty but feel place more concerned reputation premier Thai restaurant area menu  tailored dishes farang foreign meaning milder palates  wine obsession? never experienced Thai restaurant anywhere directs such focus wine  bad thing personally enjoy glass Pinot Grigio Glass Noodle Salad example but comes off little snobbish  staff courteous but seem harried busy  service good but chat Thai server hostess just don't seem time  Those seeking authentic Thai food should try some other Thai restaurants town  Each different don't really favorite although beef salad Pin Kaow excellent curries Komol Kitchen mind blowing the pastes made scratch Larb Ocha best ever anywhere! Order sticky rice  few Thai places Vegas tried mostly because location relative home but money eating Thai means enjoying personality restaurant proprietor food  areas Lotus Siam little better average lunch buffet only thing eat if lunch break am need quick Thai fix  half hour back work time  <EOR> Food 4 stars   waiters enthusiastic but poorly trained  Area scary night   Restaurant very tired  Would probably back such big competition Vegas  <EOR> While being road Vegas grueling ten hours cousins very famished  wanted buffet but majority ruled getting something off strip  Then cousin suggested eating MUST EAT restaurants Vegas Lotus Siam!  We just restaurant just time before closing dinner service  hostess sat quickly hand menus  wanted try some popular menu items but hold back them  Since season Lent avoid beef pork fowl foods  Being city sin decided good Friday  hard decision but pad see ew   Our entrees served withing couple minutes  pad see ew composed stir fried wide rice noodles eggs Chinese broccoli all mixed black soy sauce  Although pad see ew egg item could while observing Lent  noodles nice chewy  Chinese broccoli crispy fresh  egg scrambled form but added protein element dish  complete melody dish black soy sauce gave right amount saltiness  Just favorite dishes Chow fun really did enjoy dish   I need come back again try other popular dishes when Vegas observing Lent  <EOR> We dinner year ago best Thai food ever had   searching something comparable since failed   Do eat lunch buffet   I'd give lunch buffet 2 stars   two different chefs  <EOR> I wildly impressed OFF STRIP food trip Vegas! place AUTHENTIC!!  sat down asked waitress send chefs thought best  ended most extrordinary Thai dinners anywhere   and spend lot time eating LA Vegas mention 6 weeks Thailand  place open late staff friendly expect wait unless reservations but run next door play pool while wait! advice wander away Strip eat local  only find some amazing food save big bucks! <EOR> The best Thai ever! Incredible service must 2 000 bottles wine miss crispy duck fried prawns coconut milk curry dumplings could on  sure your driver knows where cause definitely obscure location  <EOR> First Yelp review ever   This place way ordinary over hyped   Food critics gave place 5 5 stars   But real critics your own taste buds   Don't fall $100 meal two!  Stick restaurants cater your needs  your wallet <EOR> This Thai spot NEVER fails  could eat every day life  many unique authentic dishes try your head spin joy  Literally everything delicious  sure reservation though! <EOR> The food ok  waiters suck food pricey   politely asked few things water another side rice yet did come until asked third time  course when requesting check did come  desk  <EOR> I seen restaurant featured Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods America  any good?  My wife came early dinner  Needless say surprised see place packed full customers 6 pm Wednesday  even celebrity wall fame  ordered following Nam Prik Ong red chili dip $10 95  Isaan Sausage $9 95  Garlic prawns $21 95  Tom Yum Koong Bowl $10 95  Crab Fried Rice $13 95  The food very good  would say best dish crab fried rice  good balance egg tomato onions  dip okay  tasted spicy bolognese did spell right? sauce thai style dip fresh veges chicharron pieces into  FYI spicy level 3 1 2 5 taste menu stated least spiciest dips! Isaan sausage tasted good  Think sour longanisa but good way  did though take some unrendered fat bits out  Garlic prawns pretty tasty  could eat shells which plus  little greasy side extra napkins surely helped  soup good but something would order again  Overall would say Lotus Siam good experience  staff very attentive friendly  even pack your leftovers answer any questions menu short yet concise way  come again try crispy duck crab fried rice again   and beer! <EOR> must Lotus Siam said  best Thai food you'll ever said    Don't believe hype   I visited Lotus Siam small group co workers while Sin City business trip  arrived restaurant promptly 8 20 told table wasn't ready although reservation made months advance  Nonetheless patiently waited because would worth it  45 minutes later table finally opened up    By time all hangry quickly ordered food  array appetizers ordered table along entrees each person 5 total   top waiting 45 minutes seated even though reservation two entrees never came! politely advised 3 different members waitstaff missing dishes watched surrounding tables continued receive orders Garlic Prawns Pad Thai before us  Sadly 2 dishes never came   and employees could care less  didn't receive single apology even felt rushed vacate table    The food did receive nothing rave opinion  ordered Khao Soi entree dish before other top rated Thai restaurants impressed curry broth noodles  broth did much flavor just tasted coconut milk while noodles mushy tasted overcooked   To sum all experience Lotus Siam disappointing  food mediocre most service sub par  Honestly believe could five star dining experience once upon time but now merely tourist trap  eaten far better authentic Thai food home New York City  <EOR> First foremost very high expectations going into restaurant  Apparently highest ranked restaurants Las Vegas definitely exceeded expectations!  The restaurant itself complete dive  only thriving businesses strip mall where located everything else pretty deserted  constant stream cabs line people going restaurant  would definitely recommend making reservation! Otherwise wait over hour!  The food amazing  love Thai food definitely favorites typically ordered  occasion however chose order outside normal dishes  server recommended garlic prawns duck panang short ribs sea bass drunken noodles  all fabulous! usually fan drunken noodles but delicious  Warning if garlic prawns  love garlic perfect me  yummy!  Service great  two guys helping awesome  guy consistently kept water glasses full other guy great food recommendations    I definitely back but only if reservations  wait would miserable! <EOR> Just back lunch here  reviews expecting Lotus blow mind didn't   Don't judge place cover outside looks pretty ghetto inside MUCH better   After reading through some reviews ended ordering 1 Tom Kah Kai distinctive soup sliced chicken coconut milk straw mushroom galanga lemon grass touch lime juice  $4 95 cup good BEST but pretty comparable other Thai restaurants   2 Nam Kao Tod Crispy rice mixed minced sour sausage green onion fresh chili ginger peanuts lime juice  $7 95 lot flavor actually much flavor  pretty salty  first few bites really good flavor kicked hard eat  Unique dish though never before  3 Drunken Noodles Crispy Duck Crispy duck topped homemade fresh chili Thai basil  Serve top pan fried flat rice noodle  $21 95 dish GOOD could used more noodles though gave enough person hardly enough 2 people share  Most people want more meat wanted more noodles gave good amount crispy duck though  flavors blended together perfectly  Would def  recommend dish   4 Thai Iced tea $2 50 each tea taste stronger any other Thai tea if you're really into tea good thing  into strong taste handed over bf   Dinner came $42 exactly before tip  if dishes expect spend $50   no dessert  = The best Thai restaurant North America? disagree  ok but definitely best  guess  happens when places hyped expect much  If come expecting much maybe live hype  Sorry ya'll  <EOR> The best Thai resto ever to  All dishes ordered awesome esp garlic prawns which die for  wanna back already! bad drive 5hrs here  <EOR> Maybe came off day     maybe just good seemed reviews    I wish could take back 2 hours spent there   very thankful didn't wait outside table     Honestly experienced better   many places eat Las Vegas would last places would ever want back to   place looks gem compared everything else strip mall   Perhaps going hole wall effect  But overall prices taste don't match opinion     The service good   table next complained numerous times waitress getting food right  wasn't happy seeing automatic charge 18% gratuity being automatically added bill   only 3 us   know pleasant guests since very simple order didn't demand anything staff    What did order? Beef Penang ok Pad Thai ok Crispy Prawns whatever expensive appetizer called ok  I am person likes Instagram good food places eat   seriously didn't heart place    just couldn't friends  wouldn't want them waste time either    I hate writing bad reviews   But seriously am still happy time dollars spent there  money  always replace but time wasted during vacation never back  <EOR> Amazing place! soon open because place fills fast! When buffet everything superb!!! friends can't leave Vegas without eating here  <EOR> This restaurant door really place easy ignored  inside totally different big nic vibe  ordered fuck noodle soup usually every Thai restaurant  fantastic! picky boyfriend stole lot foods plate while enjoying lol    Great restaurant! <EOR> Every plate eaten delish! Braised rib anything duck panang curry anything match amazing wines  Holy smokes  service superb well! <EOR> Expensive  Over rated  Long lines simmering desert heat  No thanks   One two dish different  deep fried prawn dish good   Other would recommend place when many restaurants desert  <EOR> This hands down best Thai Restaurant ever eaten at!!! seafood drunken noodles die bar definitely raised eating here! <EOR> Love place!!!  Great curry!  thought would 45 minute wait dinner seated within 15 minutes   Really good service fantastic food   number times every experience consistent enjoyable every aspect  <EOR> This 2nd time Lotus Siam being introduced restaurant years ago friends LA  restaurant does skimp flavors  EVERYTHING bursting lots lots flavors   Now take some heat take jalapeños no prob even little bits habanero sushi  But mild level spiciness Lotus Siam's soup bit much especially chili sits soup while  order your own risk!  Crispy rice mixed minced sour sausage popular dishes mentioned Yelp deserved reputation  said BURSTING flavors   The crispy duck chu chee delicious!  Now no idea chu chee but crispy duck came red curry  Both duck curry very good  only complaint price tag $20 few pieces duck very much sauce  good though!  If took cab Lotus Siam sure ask cab driver card phone # call cab pick when check  does take some time cabs location if call when check shouldn't wait much longer you're done settling bill  <EOR> If driving easy miss place since very nondescript amongst all other restaurants strip mall  restaurant looks hole wall outside concerned might come bad area  seemed enough other people standing around waiting taxis wasn't concerned though did keep looking around walked car sure safe! Inside restaurant looks much nicer  glass enclosed wine cellar background photos celebrities eaten wall    Their menu huge sure didn't order most adventuresome dishes since wanted able compare dishes ones am familiar with    I mom gluten intolerant also can't tolerate spicy food  wait staff very courteously took note dietary restrictions actually followed them she sometimes order food prepared mild restaurants only find intolerably spicy eat   pleasantly surprised since some restaurants foreign or even domestic matter cuisine don't understand when request prepare things gluten free    We thai iced teas green papaya salad massaman curry mango coconut sticky rice  All food excellent    So summary might lost finding place but good place bring friends dietary restrictions  don't think food tried any more amazing any other good Thai restaurant but would definitely recommend place if looking good Thai restaurant extensive menu  <EOR> I excited authentic Thai restaurant sorely disappointed  only good thing Thai beef jerky  Everything else unmemorable literally can't remember else ordered   Very greatly disappointed = <EOR> What say buddy Jay F didn't say review spot?   Well town visiting San Francisco over Memorial Day weekend Jay knew bit foodie he mentioned Lotus Siam early trip must place dine  finally last night town seriously blown away amazing food was  price honestly cannot it!   I would remiss without also mentioning rather extensive nicely executed wine list  Coming form Bay Area must LoS did disappoint    In short   for details read Jay F's review otherwise trust when say LOTUS SIAM thank it   at least until you're finding yourself craving being 1000 miles away     Like Arnie Schwarzenegger once said     back! <EOR> Simply best Thai restaurant entire universe! believe world class restaurant could exist shopping center but does  Huge menu nice wine selections great service AMAZING food  probably huge wait best way spend couple doors down getting foot massage  <EOR> Hello  First time diner long time admirer    Okay somewhat incomplete report  didn't dinner nor did leave early  Nope  appetizer salad main course dessert  why incomplete?  Well over 150 items I can't remember full count there's lot try  first visit decided Thai lite  But worry dear Yelpers more visits planned  Luckily sister teaches high school just down street always excuse    So enough pleasantries  Time food goodness  start fried chicken dumplings  good though entirely memorable  liked eating but don't next visit    Also starters traditional Thai salad peanut dressing  don't need say much except brother law slurping dressing kept bowl dressing table salad greens removed  He later poured some steamed rice  Don't ask  For main dishes pad Thai good sua rong hai yummy grilled beef nice spicy sauce panang curry chicken my favorite three     For dessert rice pudding fried banana roll  Both if very good  especially enjoyed banana roll coconut sugar ? wrapped fried crispy wonton goodness  could've eaten just innards good lonesome if wanted save few calories  But why bother living all? just shove all your mouth swallow calories dammed  your minds gutter but double entendre understandably apropos  So nothing mind blowingly exciting but good solid eating  spent lot time looking other tables' orders whole fried fish battered shrimp caught eye  Yes prawn envy    But vow return try all other goodies  If first tastes good enough back before check even arrived then know likey    Next time you're Vegas stop some prawns  be  <EOR> 2 stars book  Once awhile you'll run across those overrated places me  first attempt awhile back but closed certain hour  believe open till lunch only then open again around 5 dinna    My group came few minutes open avoid long line  bet people already dining time  restaurant itself quite nice service great  All dishes presentable but taste wise completely different thought   We ordered typical dishes almost everyone would order when Thai place   Pineapple Fried Rice literally 1 bowl rice  rice bad but lack pineapple meat   Beef Salad did saucy made dish  gives salad weird taste it  beef proportion more salad which others might but me!    Pad Thai only dish no complaint with  your typical pad thai where order anywhere    Pad Sew Ew simple dish  Noodles meat some sauce  does look other pad sew eww dish but flavor completely different  if put curry flavor something  <EOR> A reservation documented incorrectly quickly corrected lovely ladies Lotus Siam  penciled Saturday instead Friday   seated despite mix before reservation time   Low behold am impressed off good start!   With all party seated accounted food server evening promptly took down appetizer orders  Much continued surprise stellar service Thai house awesomeness food arrived timely fashion orders only CORRECT but none forgotten!   The only glitch evening during dinner service two meals trickled behind rest  When inquired within explained several cooks preparing different stations timing each meal prepared always exactly point rest  being said all forgiven delicious eats    quite daunting task most restaurant establishments place correct order number let alone place forget bring all table same time   My take food quality this  Quite tasty  Being oh unoriginal ordered Pad Thai vegetable fried rice  know know   someone creative lot said creativity while dining  but digress   The Pad Thai exceptionally delicious dry noodles cooked perfection  Dislike server did fail ask heat level would dish therefore left absolutely NO spice ever  may unoriginal dining dish decision making but spice things up  with spices   In closing Lotus Siam's exceptional customer service attention detail ability overcome clarical errors hell attention large party general would coming back more  <EOR> If could give more stars would   place absolutely amazing   Wait 45 minutes which wasn't bad but 2 kids pretty frantic when seated   gracious waiter rushed appetizer order kids could eat   Also first time trying Thai food waiter made great recommendations   Can't wait back  <EOR> Some damn good food! buffet lunch great def try best thai food vegas <EOR> Solid food decent prices   stuffed chicken wings favorite! <EOR> you cant claim really know vegas unless know little gems around town receive acclaim featured Bon Appetit Mag hidden towners tourists    hidden understatement    its situated seedy strip mall but only guess shiznit back day seeing Las Vegas Country Club within stones throw away   anyways the GRUB downright tasty    seriously good thai food pad thai panang curry etc  drinks plenty    ice cold thai tea scorching vegas day pure heaven   the JOINT janky ass strip mall im surprised continue stay indoor dining room cramped sometimes poorly lit awesome AIR CONDITIONING wait staff owners nice genuinely

kitchen authentic recipes    but avoid night especially during full moons keep your wallet close keep reminding yourself still las vegas    <EOR> I am glad see only person didn't orgasm going place   starting think something wrong me     My client very well known food critic knowing much love Thai food he kept telling needed Lotus Siam next Vegas trip  The absolute best Thai America he insisted   So trust him   He knows ethnic food   next trip Vegas made point going Lotus Siam   only best Thai food America wasn't even best Thai food Las Vegas   Everything ordered way below standard country Thailand   Granted vegan food sans fish sauce but still damn good vegan Thai New York Chicago LA Chiang Mai   stuff didn't even come close   dining partner far say food disgusting  wouldn't far but really impressed     We ordered appetizers entrees even ordered famed  sticky rice mango several food critics glowed articles wallpaper entrance you plenty time read them all while wait your table  place packed    Even  wasn't good didn't alter any ingredients eat it   When came back LA told client experience   He shocked  You're only person ever met didn't life changing experience he mused     I  don't know   Maybe chef's day off    Maybe hate vegans   Maybe taste buds off    But last time Vegas almost empty Thai place across shopping center Lotus much better meal   guess there's just no accounting taste  <EOR> the lunch buffet usually awesome   Great place friends food conversation  <EOR> Absolutely AMAZING   Best Thai food ever states   Reasonably priced remarkable service  <EOR> Try come every time Vegas  Extensive menu all very well  Staff helpful provides great service  <EOR> Every since saw restaurant food channel wanted come try authentic Thai food  Thailand only once difficult determine if dish authentic not  But tell whether dish tasty not  Thai tea great  dishes very tasty  Unfortunately don't remember name dishes but attach photos food had  When came which around 1 45pm hour wait aware lines need bear before getting great meal  <EOR> I twice think food good but best Thai food every ate  think lot people place because see lot famous people eat here  But think food good but over price  lot choices such but still don't understand big deal maybe haven't gotten anything special why feel way  <EOR> I think some Thai food while stopped Lotus Siam lunch  I knew food good but portion small pricy  Anyway stopped found lunch buffet  It's $9 99  cheap all Even though wnat try buffet time  Pad thai ok taste good but noddle stick together Red curry ok vegetable fresh but much oil regular dish egg soup good fried rice ok fried banana fresh fruit good  course served more food such Thai style beef stew egg roll Fried Tofu Mixed vegetable  Also ordered coffee  wasn't good  I bet did warm cuz way much hot taste was        different  know wrong place order coffee but still    Buffet but gave 4 stars food price  <EOR> This probably best Thai food find US  Penang Curry Garlic Shrimp Barbecued Shrimp Soup     curry incredibly complex multitude flavors  could enough stuff  Garlic Shrimp flawless cooked perfectly perfection without being oily   barbecued shrimp served two sauces being spicy sour other sweet   waitress Tammy very helpful gives great recommendations  <EOR> Went Lotus Siam reading many great yelp reviews   located desolate strip mall looked bit sketchy   Once walked restaurant packed   Even 2pm all tables full   seem extensive wine list may good wines   ordered few dishes feel all good   egg rolls nice crunchy but bit bland   spicy fried rice noodles ordered good  Thai ice tea awesome second road    Since live bay area many great Thai restaurants felt place just good great expecting reviews  <EOR> I entered Lotus Siam knowing nothing real Thai cuisine  only really Pad Thai basic curries 5 star might taken grain salt   I found food delicious exciting   The crispy duck basil phenomenal tender meat uber crispy skin flavorful sauce   The sticky rice mango coconut ice cream enlightening  Simply but best desserts experienced   I also Pad Prick Ong egg noodles green papaya salad  next time Vegas eat dinner every night explore menu more   Must reservations! <EOR> Worthy hype! suggestions 1  reservation you're sure wait hour yes even random Monday night   2  Order drunken shrimp! Huge juicy flavorful shrimp flat noodles   3  Spice levels normal reasonable your gut!  4  Dress casually hella people come strip taxis dressed they're going $$$$ restaurant but  necessary!   Service really nice course pad thai also great  famous might well give shot! <EOR> It's early evening LV nobody wants leave timeshare    son recommendation Lotus Siam might best spot grab decent takeout   place excellent!

I've lucky haven't wait more 15 minutes table but would suggest calling ahead safe   staff very professional friendly feel very authentic   I always order Pad Thai because am very interested each place puts spin it   Lotus Siam very good Pad Thai but best ever can't warrant giving 5 star rating   I say menu very expansive price point great considering well put together everything inside all buzz going around town it   I find safe place take friends since many heard legend menu flexible something everyone  <EOR> TL DR Above average Thai food significantly above average price   Most Yelp reviews painted pretty decent picture pretty decent food restaurant but lot them fail acknowledge decently high price pay most famous dishes garlic prawns crispy duck dishes all nearly 30 dollars  portion size duck certainly significantly overpriced   The food itself almost good hyped Yelp probably better your local Thai place unless happen live somewhere Thailand  curries sauces flavorful most Thai places generally them restaurant offers quite vast menu many Northern Thai options don't often see elsewhere  lot people recommend crispy rice appetizer but each own since thought tasted salty sour crispy rice tasted probably just good description  don't drink personally but large selection wine too   The price bit higher your average Thai meal portions aren't especially generous  rice served small bowls probably weakest link restaurant  I'd say restaurant falls into common Yelped restaurant category serving good food slightly excessive price  place solid four star place worth couple visits but far cry five star location would regular book  <EOR> When visitors always want because them real treat! don't disagree  food great! always happy spot meet visit!

Overall catfish outstanding reason four stars  <EOR> I 2x's lunch  restaurant location shopping center appears bit dodgey but food consistent service excellent fairly priced  tourist trap great food  <EOR> Nice food! service    Wish would better remodeling place    But authentic feel    <EOR> We saddened tonight when headed take father some Thai cuisine which he never eaten before favorite restaurant Komol closed large dinner party        since already plaza figured we'd give Lotus try we really meaning eat but why venture away great stuff if open! sorry Lotus knocking down all but hard venture away your local spot once comfy! Ok inside say very brightly lit multiple chandeliers all over ceiling  Decor wise just every wall space filled some group's photo owner restaurant somewhere  really sure about  know owner restaurant featured chef competition aired recently can't even remember which honest Food Network   Moving crab cake appetizer steamed mussels crispy duck chili mint sauce crab fried rice rad na beef  Crab cake appetizer took surprise texture seemed more sponge compared european crab cake version  Very tasty but say just bit surprised texture  Steamed mussels oh yeah big hit! taken aback size mussels quite large but still very tasty! oh baby does sauce some KICK! enough fire department putting but good 'Woah THAT?!!! sensation  Crispy duck yup sure crispy! Meat very tender though chili mint accompanies dish very refreshing  alter your spice level if bit hotter would probably better but heat sensitive still hint heat  Crab fried rice nothing really fancy dish says fried rice crab it! Only thing dish say would chunk crab meat little more instead having long leg chunks mixed better ratio crab rice chunks  then rad na noodles beef  dish came wallowing pot brown gravy  admit disappointed lack noodles mix  barely enough 3 plates adults 1 toddler  Plenty beef served mind but would preferred bit more noodle  gravy well didn't really stand tongue palate just ok   Would eat again? Maybe honest  Personally find Komol bit better taste department but haven't all specialties Lotus can't really say  But based experienced some dishes WOW others 'eh'   Service wise busy tonight staff rushed could tell  front door sign asking customers expect 1 hr  wait food due large group being restaurant  lucky beforehand service quick but could sense staff little edge  server friendly polite enough but know scrambling stay top large group  Anyways word here  Happy dining! <EOR> Lotus Siam recommends folks reservations dinner couldn't agree more  place gets healthy crowd reserve soon decide go  Dress casual though saw table women ready clubbing all glammed up   Their unassuming interior won't wow but may notice strong smell Thai spices permeating dining room   While may shocked decor food grab your attention  All appetizers entrees tasty consistent quality  If requested dishes spicy came spicy   Shared many dishes which explains why don't much detail some them dined family style koong sarong prawn blanket $11 wish more! moo dad deaw deep fried marinated pork jerky $8 yum mussels spicy scrumptious salad ginger ground beef $8 think tod mun plar sour soup served its own cooker probably more $10 calamari salad not bad! green curry tasty overtly spicy something looked omelette noodle dish drunken noodle esque  Lotus Siam recommended many folks local otherwise  aren't best Thai restaurant claimed but sure comes close  If live average service first waitress seemed little curt but rest fine focus outstanding food you'll find yourself winner! <EOR> Been wanting try place forever finally opportunity during last trip Vegas  weekday lunch packed all  Service quick efficient  tried popular dishes everyone raving crispy duck panang curry garlic prawns  Yea definitely must try dishes  3 us  Would love come back try variety dishes larger party    It's off strip but quick taxi ride away  located random strip mall easy miss  But well worth trip  Would definitely come back  <EOR> Just simply great! Everything great food service  If know your way around may lost  Lotus location faces opposite direction street  Good thing place famous Taxis Uber drivers know it  <EOR> There's usually two schools thoughts Lotus   Most tourists enjoy sold consistent TV plugs Food Network other social media   If talk some locals they'll talk overrated food is   I'm definitely fan Lotus but encourage branch order mainly Northern Thai section which separates place anywhere else     However menu Cheesecake Factory way many selections which intimidating   should maybe provide pictures which would definitely help some novice Thai eaters   Stay away ordinary Pad Thai Satay's Curries opt new selections because  why Lotus shines   They also very pedestrian ABC Thai lunch special which decent is  <EOR> Honestly don't it  $15 cab ride hotel arrived sketchiest strip malls ever seen  2 gay bath houses swing club   When food came didn't  all come once 4 5 entrees arrived while fifth member party wait  Over all would say underwhelmed  refuse give outstanding rating when unwarranted  would call food mediocre better worse  nothing stood experience   Lastly noted cab right restaurant but worth noting wait outside sketchy shopping center 30 minutes taxi take back hotel  <EOR> I'd acknowledge family restaurant town long time helped turn area around  new businesses popping area because them  landmark lot famous patrons friends walls   This place would great come big family group friends but you'll need reservation far advanced  food meant shared   The food just good average  ordered famous duck dish $28  good  duck fried perfectly  husband ordered 5 10 spicy think because coconut curry sauce should much spicier    We worried order spicy because back east 5 10 spicy level serious business few local restaurants  mild  dish would more balanced spicier   I'm more veggie lover  ordered broth curry veggies also mild ordered 6 10   I would recommend come large groups try more dishes order things little spicier  <EOR> Hello name Anhdao am Thai food addict   habit started nine years ago when lived Los Angeles drive Thai town only 10 minutes   cannot more couple days without getting Thai   Any longer symptoms such sleeplessness lack work diligence even unnecessary irritation begin   Lotus Siam Holy Grail any Thai food addict   only Thai place outside native country accepts credit cards claims legions Thai foodie fans myself included   don't know if legends true former chef cooked Thai royalty   Legends town often spread wild fire without true origins   But Lotus Siam lie because food does lie   If undiscriminating Thai food eater don't recommend place especially if you've heard much its reputation   Lotus Siam's pad thai curries taste differently Archi's Pin Kaow you're guaranteed pay more here   But if missing those Bangkok street vendors want taste Thailand North America where go   Here some adventurous but risky authentic Thai dishes try Lotus 1   Yum Tale combination seafood salad seafood tastes if Vegas beach town price venture say don't fly seafood daily   But marinade dressing highlight best have   2   Plar Dook O Cha whole deep fried cat fish traditional Thai classic must try here   Although whole fish fins head eyes all may look foreign first non Thai eaters crispy on the outside buttery soft on the inside something catfish filets never entirely own   Lotus's lime juice peanut cashew topping good gets   3   Nua Dad Deaw Beef Jerky Issan Style deep fried jerky salty savory perfect pair sticky rice any salad   Many restaurants outside Thailand don't offer including all other Thai restaurants Vegas   4   Khao Soi Braised Short Rib Khao Soi type Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodles served curry sauce coconut cream   order chicken pork also   But short ribs divine   very authentic dish doesn't taste foreign   There restaurants one time affairs restaurants seasonal flings restaurants long term relationships   Lotus Siam

fellow diner Kabuto's     We 8 45pm seated 15 minutes   Three dishes ordered   Drunken Noodle Soft Shell Crab   good balance sweet sour spicy salt along fragrant basil   noodles overcooked dish well

Jackfruit curry $12 would pass if expecting something curry  very watery very little flavor  unripe jackfruit very good but watery curry little flavor   and again watery even more soup    Green chili dip $11 Hard pass  tasted muddled bell peppers  Zero spice any flavor other bell pepper  even sure real dish supposed taste but don't think it   Shrimp Pad thai $15 Good! Again small portion   Grilled shrimp spicy green sauce $12 probably favorite since least bland  shrimp big grilled very well  served top some shredded cabbage    Tom yum tom kah bowls $5 $6 respectively Very good! Loved soup here!  When don't why everyone else loves place so so tell myself probably ordered wrong things  definitely willing give second shot when back Vegas  always YMMV  Happy eating! <EOR> Love place never decide wife menu but great time loved food <EOR> Amazing Thai food Vegas  don't think anyone place   Fantastic line wine  Great business dinner well  <EOR> While usually traditionalist love prawns heads tentacles flailing beady eyes glaring * am willing give Lotus little hug   because if take fat juicy shrimp glaze them some sweet hot sauce wrap them bacon fry them until bacon crisp juices bottom dweller oozing you've yourself amazing dish should never passed up  don't care in authentic appetizer long screams CRASH BANG BOOM mouth  all really matters    And then there's vegetable dish complete various stir fried vegetables seems though they've sitting vat chili oil years  They're spicy juicy perfect  pepper seeds through dish let know Thai serious dish better damn well order sticky rice offset some fire ferocity    Lotus  flow  sweet pretty pink flower  innocent  harmless  turned mouth into raving lunatic  want back Vegas   but grand casinos sexy showgirls but bacon wrapped shrimp entree unbelievably piquant return   to know Lotus wasn't just mirage    *Kidding  hate things heads  <EOR> Next time find yourself city Bugsy Siegel built yourself favor leave bright lights Strip head Lotus Siam best Thai meal you'll ever U S !   My first piece advise ready wait  big place works well greased engine but always packed   Be adventures menu big things could sound scary some but trust your waiter like did won't disappointed   My waiter recommend three following dishes   Nam Prik Ong dish made blend spices herbs ground pork adjust heat your liking  three least favorite because weird eat without some sort lettuce leaf but in  Still very good see why Ming Tsai's favorite things eat    The Nam Kao Tod crispy rice mixed sour cubed pork sausage cilantro green onions ground dry chilies  ginger peanuts lime juice favorite dish night  I'd never anything before all components come together perfectly every bite  Tip Watch dry peppers For main dish waiter recommend Khao Soi Burmese egg noddles coconut curry dish absolutely perfect  Creamy but buttery spicy but overriding  Add red onions lime take dish another level   So next time you're Vegas hit jackpot Lotus Siam! <EOR> Absolutely incredible!!!!

During your next trip Vegas highly suggest venture off strip ghetto strip mall dumpy area full transients  When arrive inside Lotus Siam pleasantly surprised  place casual family friendly spacious clean great service  You find better Thai food anywhere world unless you're Thailand   It's deemed year year best Thai restaurant North America  no exaggeration    I ordered Panang Crispy Duck Curry Beef Pad See Ewe Stuffed Chicken wings  Each dish flavor explosion culinary delight  Prices very reasonable affordable    We took rental car strip quick easy 10 minute drive  Otherwise probably 20 dollar cab ride each way  <EOR> This best thai restaurant hands down   service pristine   food top notch every time   must order garlic prawn   myself shrimps prawns   but oh boy did some major damage   keep great work guys!! <EOR> I actually wanted give only 4 5 stars but no half stars Yelp!  Don't hate when happens?  I Vegas during MLK Day weekend boyfriend two friends   fun ate lot gambled lot drank lot   great way end weekend Lotus Siam   We lunch around 12pm MLK Day way back Orange County   bit fearful or least was luggage being car ate since plaza looks really ghetto   bit late being group extremely eager eaters half second before took last open table   wait wasn't bad expected other reviews here   waited only 10 15 minutes table   But being hungry all wait seemed eternity   We ordered pad thai papaya salad red curry dish fried tofu beef salad I think #58 something    Pad thai amazing!  best ever had   papaya salad good but better some other Thai restaurants   red curry dish good but spicier expect be   favorite them all FRIED TOFU!  just deep fried tofu think sweet sour sauce peanuts   doesn't sound very fancy but sauce just dish complete   tofu right crispness just melts your mouth   beef salad only mediocre comparison other dishes   I only want deduct half star because first no mangoes sticky rice w mango dish which half expecting   Second when asked fried banana dish instead mango didn't sticky rice!!! But fear   left still happy satisfied    We made staple any Vegas trips future <EOR> Came thursday lunch   place filled garlic prawns green curry both amazing <EOR> Lotus Siam located random lot off strip but don't let deter you! Yes wait but if stick rewarded! party 8 Wednesday night wait around 1 5 hours  Luckily put your name ahead time website under Reservations     After waiting around bar couple beers seated back room left peruse lengthy menu   ordered bunch things but favorites Crispy Duck Khao Soi Must get  khao soi great full bodied flavor crispy duck  DELICIOUS  Seriously couldn't stop going more long jean buttons begging mercy  honestly nothing else say except should definitely order it    Beef Penang staple Thai dish thought version good  mind blowing but think just biased because favorite dish  fellow diners thought absolutely delicious!  Cold Jackfruit Salad don't remember actual name dish but jackfruit ground pork lime juice among other things served cold slices raw garlic  Although dish admittedly little funky as jackfruit inherently is once used kept going back  raw garlic little intimidating first but actually really complements flavors jackfruit almost tones them down little    Tofu Pad See Eew Another staple dish just done really well  choose you'd tofu cooked deep fried because Vegas baby! Even carnivores table raving good was   Service good considering busy are! Can't wait come back sometime try other northern specialties! <EOR> I took group 12 friends based recommendation friend     some blandest Thai food ever had    The Panag Nua tough lacking flavor  true Panag curry but just seemed watered down  meat just sliced tossed in  Normally good Thai places nice chunks beef let stew all day sauce permeates meat just falls apart    The Yum Yai salad almost no sauce litte sauce did lacked any flavor   The Tom Ka Guy soup watery heavily lacking taste  chicken dry huge chunks just right soup  also lacked decent amount mushrooms   The Kow Pat Moo totally flavorless Thai fried rice  more over priced panda express Chinese fast food rice   huge failure  mean hard toss nam plaud sugar into some rice?   The Phad Thai soggy more consistency spagetti marinara then thai fried noodle dish    The saving grace moo sautee  nice small would streets bangkok  did taste good but then again  staple Thai places would your way screw up   All being said friends liked BUT none them ever tried Thai food before much less GOOD Thai food  think must case lot positive reviews here  other negative reviewer pointed simply no Thai people does tend good indicator if Thai place good  <EOR> I wish could give Lotus Siam 10 stars  good!!!!   Don't let exterior location off strip fool you  Lotus Siam favorite restaurant Las Vegas and vegas native hands down  quite possibly favorite restaurant period  follow them instagram just drool over every photo   My typical experience begins Tom Yum soup shrimp  pot whole table  honestly say you've never Tom Yum soup this  taste each ingredient separately but also all together  symphony your mouth!!!

I'm spoiled Thai town Hollywood consider slightly biased  service very absent food overpriced got  Only thing worth mentioning dessert combo plate sticky rice mango fried banana ice cream  Hit me! Hit me! sweets  Ok spending much time Blackjack table  Again! Bad Dani! <EOR> Dive location BUT great interior quality food great service  Pelegrino water only comes large $7 bad but could shock if you're eating yourself often while business traveling  Their Fuji water may come small bottle but ask <EOR> Every time Vegas come least once twice  Let's just say best thai place ever ate at! service great food good don't want stop eating! Gotta try everything menu because can't tell dish better! Everything good! thing need know need reservation ahead time because always long wait! <EOR> I'll keep short sweet  place doesn't need review  speaks itself    The food amazing  Well worth wait  issue becomes controlling your impulse over ordering   I believe really can't wrong anything order  only advice    think outside your comfort zone  Don't order would ma pa thai restaurant around corner which sure delicious don't wrong   <EOR> I told coworker mine husband headed Vegas would doing some touristy things first day would car  She immediately pointed direction Lotus Siam  She said amazing Thai place if car should definitely check out  followed advice happy did! husband isn't hugest fan Thai both enjoyed meal had  ordered more could eat and without having fridge hotel room couldn't take any leftovers us both very satisfied choices   I say first very intimated menu  more 10 pages long list your standard curries addition numerous traditional dishes plus dishes different regions Thailand add page more noodle dishes salads appetizers etc   enormous! took while but finally decided 3 dishes never tried before Spicy Shrimp Salad Catfish red curry without coconut milk Thai style sausage  also ordered Pad Thai sort control dish something we're both familiar   huge and rather impressive wine list but neither really think pairing Thai wine stuck beer Singha instead    First sausage delicious  country style sausage big pieces meat fat natural casing simply seared served spears fresh ginger few tiny but VERY spicy chili peppers fresh cabbage toasted peanuts  Both really taken surprised flavorful sausage was  tart sour almost citrus y taste meat pickled brined before being chopped ground stuffed into its casing  actually allowed sausage taste less dense it dry sausage more meat fat citrus whatever sour note cut through meat   Taking bite fresh ginger slice sausage made perfect combo  overall favorite dish   The catfish curry very good although similar other red curries tried  never curry catfish fish fresh nicely cooked not under cooked certainly overcooked   Unfortunately zucchini rather mushy even though green beans al dente  nice heat flavor there  Honestly just OK compared everything else   The Spicy Shrimp Salad surprisingly good spicy  shrimp just side cooked still little soft but completely cooked through huge  tossed chunky salad dressing kaffir leaf fish sauce soy sauce basil chili peppers probably some tamarind plus number other things couldn't quite pick out  all presented bed roughly chopped Romaine lettuce  could've done smaller pieces lettuce huge rib y compared shrimp dressing  Ultimately very good something would never thought order  wish served earlier other dishes more salad appetizer course rather last thing brought table   Lastly control dish Pad Thai welcome comfort  actually best Pad Thai ever before  balance savory sweet sour salty perfect  noodles cooked well add ins sprouts chicken peppers all nicely incorporated  depth flavor Pad Thai really made dish stand rest really wish more room stomach eat more it   The price each dishes comparable other Thai restaurants home  surprised number comments other Yelpers portion size  thought portions all easily shared two people possibly three  Believe neither husband nor starved night!   The service fine stellar but certainly ignored forgotten despite being seated small room just off main dining room  decor shabby yes definitely could use some TLC  least clean  Situated run down strip mall few blocks Las Vegas Blvd  opposite Strip but food would say same level $50 plate restaurants resorts  If hadn't other dinner plans during trip would've made another stop try more dishes! <EOR> Loved place    its off strip but worth drive here   The crispy duck awesome tons flavors awesome sauce   garlic shrimp unique eat entire shrimp shell all since fry shell melts your mouth when eat it!  The only cons would say service spotty times took 10 15mins even waiter order   But once did waiter pretty good service afterwards   The portions smaller average but then again portions gain flavor quality   I would suggest ordering 2 dishes appetizer 3 dishes party two   It little more pricier average thai place but well worth it! <EOR> Best Thai Restaurant too  Saw episode Parts Unknown Anthony Bourdain which craving really good Thai food  Made reservation dinner time which recommend cause first ones outside started piling more people  Waiting 20mins outside blistering heat worth just find shade   food expected just amazing! Great service food came really fast! Garlic prawns crispy skin   far best thing god put planet good! khao soi braised beef the beef fell apart tender nam prik ong which great kinda reminded thick meaty more flavorful bolognese sauce crispy duck panang amazing Sai Oua thai sausage very tasty  Overall very impressed satisfied  Would eat rather buffets  There's alot choose prices worth it  I'd definitely back next trip Vegas  wish delivered all way Toronto Canada lol <EOR> Food good any other Thai Restaurant to  The service terrible! The location isn't ideal sure park close restaurant  Saw some pretty interesting people looking into car windows    In conclusion personally don't think worth time money  <EOR> How much did want here? reserving dinner 12 week but couldn't wait upon landing grabbed 3 friends immediate lunch  Lunch great no lines!!!! food incredible always glad made quick stop before big dinner  <EOR> First all would NEVER know find place unless specifically looking it  off strip area town wouldn't normally want visit    mean unless you're interested transvestite strip club down plaza  knows maybe  your thing? Anyway    if happen read review someone Vegas a cab driver another local? recommend place good reason    simply amazing    You would never guess outside    matter interior unless examined ALL celebrity pictures down walls course place fact just simply amazing every possible way  wait staff knowledgeable extremely helpful food DELICIOUS full service bar even if food takes some time which experience doesn't enjoy some nice drinks    Best all? AFFORDABLE!!! five star food two $$ prices      Just all  <EOR> My wife LOVES place   only downgrading restaurant because location  sketchy neighborhood little hard find   But if Lotus enjoy it  restaurant 3 times now enjoyed every meal   Well worth trip  <EOR> So apparently Lotus legendary Thai Foodie Institution going review them based that  fan value proposition great one   Make reservations because otherwise you're going wait  Forever  maybe until next day   your fault because why would not? your life empty afford 45 90 minutes doing nothing no reason?

The thai boat noodles good but broth could more beef flavor   If dish should definitely hit Yum Saap or Saap its called Yelp West Hollywood   Its closest boat noodle kind thailand!  The Nam kao Tod something never tried thought pretty interesting yummy   Some people table didn't because sausage sour but its supposed be   If aren't fan sour sausage then maybe stay away dish   The Put Prik King also best had   ours pork flavor prik good!

Super reasonable  Staff? Attentive polite despite packed house always available  Vegas? Lotus Siam!! <EOR> I hesitated between 2 3 star  food solid three star  Value your dollar big fat 1 star  Maybe hyped much head because all rave reviews also long line waiting outside even before restaurant opened   We basically most popular items  Drunken noodles sea bass asked level 7 spicy good kick sea bass very moist tender it  However almost $30 dish very much  noodles just barely enough fish group 4 split  Crispy Duck Kha Soi Sp? creamy coconut based sauce egg noodles crispy duck  say duck perfectly cooked delicious noodles good especially coated sauce  Again price $25 barely enough noodles split between 4 people  The fried shrimp everyone seemed get  love crispy shells completely edible full shrimp flavor  looks big plate 10+ shrimp but more actual shrimp meat 4 5 pieces rest just shell   The spicy chicken wings just OK tastes Costco wings tossed Asian sweet chili sauce would skip next time  We red chili dip very smokey but only flavor really fan either  Ordered curry dish didn't coconut milk another lacking flavor didn't finish dish because just didn't taste anything just lot boiled veggies red watery soup    You'd think 6 dishes between 4 people we'd full but ended having order another drunken noodle dish but just veggies  Sadly second round good first sea bass  also mango sticky rice dessert   Overall some dishes very good but good enough justify price  <EOR> The ambiance much better inside must admit expecting lot more food  family love Thai food few spots already  leaving hungry wasn't good but still nice restaurant  fan feeling claustrophobic while waiting seated however still say food good but better  LOVE FOOD!

Definitely ask server pairing recommendations your order   3  PRICING IMO pricing very fair quality quantity food get  Order away good sir!  The negatives little bit restaurants control but still something take into consideration 1  LOCATION restaurant located rather dark strip mall closed off major streets  Don't worried but keep your wits you  dozen times without incident haven't heard any issues  Just looks little   shady   2  SPEED SERVICE Sometimes restaurant packed service little slow   too slow taste  BUT food outweighs negative deal it   3  LENGTH TIME SEATED prepared wait! Sometimes wait hour  Yes good      Would recommend place others? Absolutely   Would come back myself? Thinking going again tonight now written review!!! <EOR> Not big fan duck but tried crispy duck yelp recommendations found drunken noodles best eaten anywhere  always disappointed now trying Noodles elsewhere  even plain strip mall type location detract being 5 star experience  Kids loved expected bill much higher experience had  reservations! <EOR> Yes hype real!

We pre wedding dinner night before  love Thai wanted compare local favorite    I liked Tom Kha Gai  hint lime refreshing    We also tried several others dishes  asked medium spicy but felt wasn't spicy  However still best Thai food aside usual local favorite tried! We'll definitely come back!  One small note come when your rushed time  waiter food took little bit longer we're used but wasn't problem  <EOR> This simply best Thai restaurant thus far   Many said Best Thai continental USA think they're right!  Vegas week visited place 3 times   Loved it   All favorite dishes found under Chef Choices section menu   top favorite dish deep fried prawns shell pepper special garlic sauce   tried both versions deep fried prawns but garlic hands down easily best the other just okay      We also ordered Whole 2 pound CharGrilled Catfish 2nd visit   yummy but agreed wouldn't order version again   First takes 45 mins  prepare which told course    Second catfish skin bit well done burnt tastes and BBQ    cooked catfish meat very good worth trying   We'll probably try another cooked version  whole catfish next time we're visiting Vegas   I also recommend Chilean Sea Bass Crab Fried Rice Drunken Noodle whatever [insert meat preference]     The Chilean Sea Bass also excellent but equally good sea bass less price   super value dish but quality excellent   crab fried rice also excellent    crispy duck w drunken noodle good spectacular since being asian quite lot duck      Choose spice level your food suit your preference   don't tend spicy since fairly low spicy tolerance level usually choose Level 2   tried Level 4 hot halfway into second serving   those spicy just ignore warning whatever rocks your socks!

Stopping Lotus Siam truly treat your tastebuds  Food AMAZING  officially made #1 spot Thai food  Service fast efficient moment you're sat  Prices steep but really know cook amazing food  Best way family style sample little everything    Reservations taken but should made LEAST week advance  couple front reservations seated immediately  Note taken  wait worth but can't see myself doing again  SMART RESERVATION!! <EOR> I still think Lotus' poached salmon among best ever still huge fan drunken noodles roast duck curry  But decided update dock another star because service consistently gotten worse worse over years reality far more quality Thai options Vegas valley now even just few years ago including or especially those opened past Lotus employees    My most recent negative service interaction involved waiter losing leftovers we'd asked boxed we three leftover dishes waiter only gave two back boxes   particularly annoyed because only ordered dish intending take most home we'd barely touched it  different waiter came apologized told would cook completely new dish take  Honestly point I'd preferred if they'd just knocked off bill but decided accept offer wait new dish   But when home found completely new dish barely 1 4 portion original  don't even know if cooked new dish all maybe even just gave someone else's leftovers going throw away  any case just left really bad taste mouths  If you're going try your service failure you'd better right you're just making even worse   Ultimately becoming tough justify trip Lotus honestly even 3* might generous service really gotten bad  Sure time when Lotus standout Thai option Las Vegas but certainly case anymore feeling Lotus manages stay busy only because they're riding past fame  <EOR> I always heard place while Vegas but never ventured far enough off strip until recently try it    The place small strip mall  road slightly confusing feels you're factory  inside quite nice but small luckily no line   We ordered curry noodles dish  Serving sizes smaller used compared normal Thai place Los Angeles  Food good but worth hype   comparison still prefer normal place Los Angeles Original Hoy Ka Noodles see review    Worth trying hype northern dishes  Slightly more pricey  <EOR> As far Thai fair place definitely does job  food no way exceptional but very satisfying way would expect any decent Thai joint  The Panang Curry very tasty cleared sinuses nicely  What stood most setting situated derelict strip mall near DTLV seems everyone occupying very crowded dining room little local secret   Oh yeah price right  $50 appetizer two entrees two beers  <EOR> Pretty Surprising   Neat spot old shopping center perfect part town   Once over lack ambience outside restaurant awesome   Packed people clean busy food pretty ridiculous   Everything ordered recommended server made happy wasn't Strip paying arm leg food good   Fresh ingredients vibrant colored tasting dishes enough talking yourself over there  <EOR> Very Good food lots flavor service fairly quick   place busy reason  <EOR> Authentic northern Thai cuisine lots flavor dishes don't see typical Thai restaurants  great selection wines sake  service excellent  favorite dish drunken noodles soft shell crab mixed fried rice  favorite dessert sticky rice mango  <EOR> + win very Las Vegas 50% abandoned 100% ratchet AF strip mall  Mad Tasty  <EOR> Oh my   Thai food lover still awe last nights dinner   Wonton soup wonderfully light full rich flavorrs   Hot sour vegetable soup fantastic contrast flavor   garlic grilled prawns chile lime delicious    Chicken red curry grrat flavor    garlid fried prawns shell great comination texture garlicky goodness   Ordered off menu sauteed vegetables spicy chile garlic sauce off hook flavor   Service great always  <EOR> Having lived Vegas few years lot restaurants town hole wall upscale places everything between but Lotus Siam favorites   renovated interior few years ago nicer more spacious used be   also added extensive wine selection     I usually order same thing pad thai tom yum soup yellow curry Thai restaurants but restaurant also order different seafood dishes all amazing   recommend garlic prawns garlic squid seafood lovers   best call ahead reservation especially weekends   recently tried dine weekday night but no longer space reservations next day lunch instead  <EOR> Don't see what's big deal   Very simple place super packed 2 h waiting just average quality food   Oh served fast lol done 10 min     put under pressure leave coz next person waiting   <EOR> My impression Las Vegas super lacking edible Thai food edible sushi  But guess come California maybe    y'know   perspective   I waited 2 hours dinner Friday night  Yelp crazy place  friends crazy place  DENTIST crazy place  thought 2 hour wait must mean okay join craziness   But really just mediocre Thai food dressed nicely terrible restaurant setting  Really atmosphere kindof typical Chinese restaurant sub par service dirty tablecloths wobbly tables little noisy you can but not really hear each other talk etc   Maybe trick sell wine which nice  people eating drunk enough can't remember just spent $30 6 pieces tiny shrimp  Seriously Vegas grocery stores biggest shrimp cheap  sure where place sourcing ingredients unless they're just sitting 80% profit margins  Everybody recommends Garlic Prawn dish  taste *fine* but think  rip off if ever saw one   Also duck panang  good   it's just   I mean you're paying $30 such small dish    Is me? Am just pig eats more she should? Because just don't understand good deals people living Vegas???? single people portions misunderstanding because setting so   common? Honestly when pay $30 restaurant single dish expect super large super extraordinary least super comfortable atmosphere  dishes literally none above  don't know  guess just keep searching good Thai place  <EOR> Amazing food very flavorful incredibly helpful service advised against some items getting similar sauce then recomended something else amazing  price reasonable! Definitely worth cab ride off stip  <EOR> Lotus Siam  oh excited visit again  and oh let down   But eventually give more chance      Lotus sort upscale Thai restaurant  Service great but still paper napkins paper place mats   We order Garlic Prawns Nam Prik mild Northern Thai Larb Tom Yum   Tom Yum   they should name Tom Yummy soup   really taste lemongrass this   But spicey   We wanted try Northern Thai dishes because common   I think know why   just good      Larb seems stir fried  Seems almost Chinese  definitely taste spices herbs  But none tang its southern counterpart   menu does say no lime but surprised much missed lime!  Nam Prik mild version really menu describes   like spaghetti sauce vegetables dip     simple describe   i excited try this   fault going medium spicey version   Garlic Prawns   this disappointment night   dish before amazing   walked into restaurant almost every other table plate it   sure everyone else but thought very average   much batter enough flavoring  don't know if because many people ordered just sloppy but definitely good remembered it  $28 big disappointment   Overall give more try   but since expensive   one more try all lotus   Oh forgot mention   not sure why but everything came once  soup dishes     <EOR> Highly recommeded!!

First off wine list longer menu  which great sign because believe don't need great wine list unless great food first match it   We started Tom Yum soup which delicious full flavor fresh chunks mushrooms but only beginning   Our second dish Fried Pompano well flavored moist middle  not mention probably biggest pompano seen I expecting something considerably smaller but still managed tasty dry might expect large fish kind   The third dish Crispy Duck w Penang Curry  soo good but bad but just generally awesome!  described other yelpers let reviews drool   In end two left happily stuffed hoping back Vegas soon try more   all great food bay area many places outside northern California impress but am big fan place now can't wait back there!  Happy Eating! <EOR> For place tourist destination skeptical but execution service very high   All usual Thai fodder menu but many notable additions many into just head along try it   wine list mega extensive but end day just need simple cheap glass reisling pair delicious food  Four dinner glass vino each $150  <EOR> Rude somehow party ten      we need reserve two weeks advance   staff just stands around front discuss personal matters    When into back bar bathroom least 30 open seats huge bar dining area    Seems owner present owner doesn't care anymore since he's busy business doesn't work hard maintain customer base  Our party instead Thai Original BBQ down street   gave good food great service now know where next time visit Vegas again  <EOR> Was best Thai food well um no does work where at? sure no problem   Plus think such aura maybe expected much?    Side note Funny thing coming shopping complex years few Korean restaurants did feel really going Korean food instead Thai   Since bunch town Yelp Spring Break made point LOS list dos    and then quite few people set UYEs   go figure first thing lunch Friday   no lunch specials but $10 99 lunch buffet   guess can't vegas without buffet?  I know don't exactly Thai restaurant chicken wings but garlic black pepper chicken wings caught eye just couldn't let go   chicken wings is   couldn't alone some chicken dumplings well some steamed rice   bestie joined town Yelp Spring Break Yellow Curry did some sharing   Curry decent but felt veggies weren't really cooked enough   kinda felt just threw last 2 minutes warm them it   expecting mush but little bit more cooked perhaps?  Chicken dumplings fried nothing special sure gotten those before freezer section grocery store   But wings deserve 5 stars own   GOOD   some sweetness them but garlic pepper fantastic wings   cooked fried perfection still moist enough inside   Absolutely loved flavor profile   figure truly non tradition item thing thought best   I'd back wings but don't know if I'd willing other things   besides wings 9 bucks own 6 which bit steep when think it   Service quite good but forewarned if large group only split four ways good customer bring cash if you've large group pile debit cards   Parking ask?  strip free PLENTY all times  <EOR> Love Chicken Pad Thai try every time Las Vegas  spicy but only handle 6  Anything higher hot  <EOR> It's hyped up  sucker Thai having tried most Thai places valley Lotus Siam exactly looks outside  good alright  But don't follow crowd  more hidden gems Las Vegas  <EOR> I came recently admit can't enough place  love Lotus Siam  best freakin thai food ever had  friend even planning flying L A  Vegas just dinner here  place must when visiting Las Vegas mean c'mon just read all great reviews  <EOR> Worth wait!

Luckily checked other Yelp reviews knew order medium spicy   Even medium really spicy just perfect amount me   spicy where take sip your drink every other bite but spicy where your lips tongue fire!    I'm huge fan panang curry   usually prefer regular yellow curry   But reading other Yelper's reviews best dish try Crispy duck panang   dish alright opinion   crispy duck skin delicious but duck itself little dry side   Plus hardly any meat mostly skin     We also ordered Garlic Prawns   picture posted doesn't dish justice   Huge prawns shell still attached but slighty pulled back deep fried   prawn shells light crispy must find it!  Overall dish tastes very similar Salt Pepper shrimp Chinese restaurant     Lastly Pad Thai   Boring know   different fact used thin clear noodles instead wide linguine type noodles wasn't saucy   much write here    I've come conclusion come back bigger group people try more menu   lot dishes towards back menu Northern Thai cuisine yet experience  <EOR> If you're Vegas sick Strip's fare liking seems lack value able offer try Thai food Lotus Siam  some best casual food you'll find area    The location short cab ride LV Strip older little Asian strip mall don't expect much end  other hand food great prices good wait isn't long if pick good time there  <EOR> This upscale Thai place extensive wine menu  sure try northern specialty dishes! <EOR> I've quite few Thai places life but none compared flavor authenticity one   group friends them grew Thailand she suggested visit Vegas   noticed place popular before even stepped into door because saw bunch taxis outside   meant people heard place visiting strip etc   Overall amazing food great selection friendly attentive staff   defiantly coming back again next visit Vegas  <EOR> Just some lunch reading reviews  solid 3 star thai place me  best part very affordable pricing Thai Iced Coffee appetizer main soup $25    The iced coffee delicious always appetizer crispy rice sour pork cubes  eh  Just deep fried rice pork cubes really just cut ham could down street super market    I Northern style no coconut milk Tom Kum Kai chicken soup but subbed chicken prawns  good amazing really good just   good    I'd again but if you're into Thai food don't expect anything amazing other reviews would believe  <EOR> An absolutely great restaurant  eaten years always Vegas classic! service food always excellent would highly recommend anyone search fine Asian dining! <EOR> I've dreaming trying place since saw featured Top Chef few years ago  excited finally try place most recent trip Vegas    My husband came Tuesday afternoon around 11 30am  no wait but restaurant pretty busy! seated right away    Seafood soup Soup tangy perfect chilly day  came tons seafood!

Yes does   But when recommend place friends recommendation always accompanied footnote prepared lot sitting waiting  <EOR> LoS overrated  Quality maintenance harder quality attainment  don't think much staff lazy disinterested  just hard stay motivated cook aggressively ambitiously when clientele isn't aggressive ambitious its ordering dietary habits  fault isn't particular ethnic restaurants most high end restaurants succumb same pattern early greatness followed plateau then slow steady decline if ever reach heights begin    To fair food very good  extraordinary even top 10%  Fresh mushroom salad interesting idea half realized  two shrimp accompanied salad fine but same quality much more unprepossessing restaurant visited two nights later  salad itself bit monochromatic   I did enjoy dry beef liver entree though nearly spicy server averred  He helpfully provided some condiments recommendations    My server fact helped conclusion LoS wasn't terrific  I'd gone LoS expecting would overrated  But don't prejudge  server more enthusiastic recommending other Thai restaurants he talking own menu  mean he unprofessional he spoke negatively employer  just clear demeanor he prefers eat elsewhere  <EOR> Went while mini moon Vegas past November   strip mall sorta ghetto depressing tons parking though but restaurant itself nice quaint   heard tough table 10 mins before opened Wednesday   already two other people waiting them open well   steady stream folks filling seats soon opened   time left almost all tables full   The food good but honest didn't blow mind   think all hype set expectations pretty high   food still great though   ordered larb start   tasty but definitely lot more rice meat   also crsipy prawns which fave  take shrimp shell but still leave connected then deep fry part fried shell part fried shrimp   Really tasty   drunken noodles too   OK brothy pad see ew   expecting thicker sauce but felt more soupy saucey   didn't order wine but wine cellar HUGE bunch awards wall wine list   The service AMAZING!  Extremely attentive friendly knowledgable   really made experience great   also huge menu there's lot dishes choose from    Overall glad just say tried it   If we're part town ddefinitely again  <EOR> What great meal! crispy duck curry treat  Only reason taking star because food cold  warmed awesome  line door when arrived would suggest getting early  <EOR> What say? place awesome!! location which strip mall mile east strip quite uninspiring but food Lotus Siam anything but! heard dinner reservations very difficult come they're backed weeks recommend visiting lunch   did seated right away  Based other yelp reviews Anthony Bourdain well highly recommend order Northern page menu   restaurant specializes  why world renown  prices very reasonable flavors world! no means connoisseur Thai cuisine but definitely big fan it  being said far concerned Lotus Siam good gets! Definitely visit don't afraid take leap faith Northern page  Just don't frustrated if can't table dinner  <EOR> There part feels sad writing review   Why?  Because used love place much   while since last really looking forward great LOS experience   Several years ago ate often brought many people staff even gave free shirt   Alas those glory days over   portion sizes shrunk prices gone service leaves something desired     I arrived early dinner wait when party 4 seated only gave 2 menus no wine list   little while server came over take drink order   When let know wanted order wine but still weren't offered wine list   decided push issue just glass choosing instead bottle then placed dinner order   Our appetizer stuffed chicken wings   2 chicken wings $11    They're good chicken wings but $11 good   party 4 people surprised server didn't advise would only two   Try putting 4 plate then pricing might sense     The combination beef noodle soup very good  admit Asian soup noodle guy   Love pho wonton soup beef stew ramen   nice dish holds its own greats   Beef meatballs noodles fragrant broth garnished fried pork skin   Good portion very reasonable price     Our Pad Thai tasted great but portion size half remember them serving past   Since all sharing dishes wasn't huge deal but would take least 2 orders equal would most other Thai restaurants town        The whole Thai BBQ chicken meh   Seasoning okay but guessing left over lunch or earlier came kitchen room temperature only 3 4 minutes ordering together duck and before appetizer    stale chicken texture old supermarket rotisserie chicken towards end night when sat under heat lamps many hours becomes mealy   Although cut into pieces chicken somewhat small   humanely raised tasty farm chicken small though   parts look came 22 24oz Cornish game hen   My biggest disappointment evening came table form panang crispy duck   used favorite dish really looking forward it   When entree came fraction size its former self   duck fried order panang did same richness depth used to   horrible?  No   Would order again?  Absolutely not   asked server portion size only dish but rest them well he replied all appeared fine   asked why duck portion shrunk much he informed portion only supposed 1 4 duck   He said he hadn't worked very long but way long he'd worked there   1 4 duck totally unremarkable panang $25?  Yikes!  used whole roasted duck butterflied de boned then flash fried order price   The verdict?  Completely average food small portions big prices   now heading over Spring Mt Thai food fix when Las Vegas   wonder sort horrible Thai food other reviewers eating which causes them give LOS 5 stars?  Oh yearn days when LOS small hole wall still wig shop next door   The good news all this?  gay bar entrance Commercial Center called Spotlight which always still very straight friendly received full remodel inside recently   Service fantastic well drinks beer still 2 $4 during happy hour   if your heart's set overhyped mediocre Thai food still grab drink next door while waiting your table  <EOR> First Thai place ever seen line door!

Stone IPA drink menu choice two favourite bevvy's complete meal     They recently expanded doubled seating capacity easier used table too!  would recommend reservation Fri Sat     but if packed always trot over Komol some excellent chow well   I say though  vegan 7 years don't stray that   also generally try encourage others eat similar manner   HOWEVER when take meat eaters Lotus pretty much insist order off Northern Thai menu   Only item doesn't meat but dishes very rarely found American Thai menus    just already! If you're adventurous eater you'll probably love it  <EOR> I am glad chance visit restaurant   never heard place until most recent trip Vegas   Dishes more expensive usual Thai restaurant   Vegas going shelling tons money all over place   Maybe cut back few drinks club few lap dances less save few bucks try spot if would feel better    You find some dishes may encountered other Thai restaurants   place gets real packed   Non stop taxi's dropping off people every minute seems   reservation day advance if large group   very limited reservation slots     Ordered Sausage Deep Fried Garlic Prawns Fried Peking Duck Panang Thai Beef Salad Drunken Noodles Sea Bass     My favorites are Deep Fried Garlic Prawns nicely fried battered garlicky   Enjoyed eating every part shrimp   skin separated deep fried well   Fried Peking Duck Panang normally eat duck because certain taste but certain meats dishes may generally however prepared certain way might just fall love it   certainly enjoyed dish   Maybe because fried sliced into thin pieces thick skin   Throw panang curry perfect fusion flavor   Some group thought bit oily greasy but did mind   Thai Beef Salad rib eye beef salad thai sweet lime dressing   Tender beef good sauce   delicious    Sausage Drunken Noodles Sea Bass good but least favorite   Sausage lot flavor but did find myself enjoying more other sausages had   Sea bass cooked well thick piece but standard   noodles deep fried soft shell crab sounds something more liking   Maybe back order someday  <EOR> What  The  Heck??

Well misfortune 1 being dinner ate having gone Jose Andres' e' 2 being visited few months wife eaten Portland's Pok Pok   If weren't those two things would've five star review all way  But alas wasn't best meal I'd eaten 24 hours though yes unfair comparison let alone best Thai I'd which mean aforementioned Pok Pok  So let stop comparisons just talk experience  strip mall  a sketch strip mall that  Some my overly critical parents example might find turn off  Others a hole Yelpers example add points given genuine hole in the wall status  Thankfully sketch doesn't extend interior   We group six  We'd made reservations month previous few if any hiccups though did heed advice showing exactly time  wine list impressive hole in the wall Thai joint standards  Actually wasn't bad objective standpoint either  We'd ordered few bottles Reisling letting sweetness wine counter spiciness food allowing each diner bathe unfettered air foodie douchebaggery   I ordered BBQ Pork Moo Yang   tasty pretty pleased though kind one note  Also reminded pork I'd eaten Tu Lan's shady Vietnamese place SF  Now  bad comparison since LOVED pork but I'd expected something bit more   Thai   My wife ordered green curry dish  She said okay indeed sampling concurred  She groused though  reputation place expecting blown away  Yeah guess so  Then again some places shine unexpected dishes  their specials such  while phoning same ol' same ol'  guess could those places  fact hope so  really hard tell since majority group 5 different varieties curry route mildly disappointed   Sigh   The service good friendly  pork tasty  wine flowed easily  But most group perplexed questioned LoS's reputation  don't know man  Why didn't guys order whole fish if wanted see do?

For price Chef Choice dishes Crispy Duck Panang Garlic Prawns which over $25 each seemed pricey   Pad See Ew more reasonable $11 95 includes choice meat   also located pretty sketchy neighborhood   would probably come once every few years haha  <EOR> I'm hovering between three four stars but time dining Lotus Siam long ago stick four until chance back!  Having heard much place prior even moving Las Vegas decided check lunch almost immediately unloading U Haul  Ah good old days circa 2007! when kind free time would allow wait hour seated lunch! Yes most memorable part experience definitely wait time   By time table famished impatient opted lunch buffet  Nothing stood particularly mind blowing but none limited dishes bad either  believe minced chicken dish rice veggie noodle option chicken wings few soups along side some salads condiments  filled left satisfied but felt no overwhelming need return immediately   Based other reviews mouth watering user photos know need try again probably dinner order some more exciting options  suck advance planning come think did try come back twice found place closed once line halfway down block other but think LOS warrants another trip sooner rather later  <EOR> Really really good food!  matters right? Even $12 20 price range always find myself rushing back    But very busy  wait half hour so  But cool thing where text when your table ready could some shopping something mean time   I haven't loved service gotten there  They're busy waiter waitress doesn't come often food takes while friend told stories them forgetting dishes and or bringing some dishes hour later others  <EOR> You know when someone builds movie much when finally see your expectations through rough enjoy but still little disappointed  would say most accurate description experience here  read many hallowed reviews critical acclaim Lotus Siam while everything perfectly good Thai iced tea Pad Thai Green Curry mango sticky rice don't know more expected but didn't quite live expectations  Perhaps boost refresh ambiance push over top hopefully new location help regard!! <EOR> This favorite places Thai food   Whenever opportunity try bring friends family   incredibly deceptive its appearance doesn't look much outside kind seedy looking strip mall   just park near lights remember hide anything valuable   There bit long wait depending many people waiting a bit gamble when go    However always well worth it     I love food representative many different places regions   love Yellow Curry staple always order every Thai restaurant Pad Thai   curry isn't soupy but good consistency Pad Thai delicious well   While portions bit small compared other places I'm 6'0 190 three dishes usually enough 2 easy  <EOR> When members family came town solicited help me  years Yelp gave them full trust come recommendations around valley  those nights everyone mood Asian food decided take them here  taken food place before but never really sat ordered  great opportunity!

Nam Kai Tod $8 95 USD recommended appetizer  Crispy fried rice pork raw cabbage side  really interesting  never deep fried fired rice love crunchy taste  dish bit salty liking but did balance when take bite raw cabbage   Crispy duck Panang $27 95 USD favorite dish  crispy duck really really good! duck lean skin crispy thin without much white fat hanging between skin meat  duck meat tender  panang curry sweeter end stronger coconut flavor really well rice  Loved dish!  Pad Thai $11 95 USD Pad Thai chicken  decent amount chicken which good but overall dish portion small  noodles really thin but soft chewy texture  Flavors point  Tasty!  Khao Soi beef $10 95 USD The Khao Soi flavor similar Panang except less coconuty  Decent amount beef  Felt could use more noodles  tasted good but slightly bland if eat its own sure add some soup each bite enhance taste  Food good but wouldn't say best Thai food had  quite expensive considering portions small  Thai food authentic definitely above average though  Service good all staff very knowledgeable menu food items  <EOR> Once upon time search off strip greatness Vegas stumbled into lovely bar thanks yelp    Many returns later asked dependable bartender where he would some righteous Thai  Lotus Siam he replied without hesitation  This place now honor being 2nd favorite Thai restaurant far   rice paper then bacon wrapped prawns appetizer then gorged myself beef liver was      Superb  Very reasonable prices far most amazing menu seen  <EOR> Oh thank Lotus Siam being beautiful spicy delicious very Lotus Siam   Platonic ideal Thai food American restaurant experience   This best Riesling lists possibly world   wines pair just gorgeously spicy but not overpowering flavors just everything menu   This beautifully authentic thai high quality ingredients   Worth trip off strip   some loveliest food Vegas very best price stunning wine list     Do leave Las Vegas without appearance here  <EOR> Wow!

Note only accept 4 credit cards max  big problem 10 party group  <EOR> I've heard best thai restaurant America    Its very good but really didn't notice big difference between Renu Nakorn which time related Lotus Siam  Service very good though   its very solid thai restaurant but didn't knock socks off others said  I believe review would suffer unrealistically high expectations  <EOR> The menu very adventurous Lotus Siam but didn't explore outside usual Thai dinner   Pad thai noodle consistency near perfect but definitely over seasoned taste   Mango sticky rice fantastic pineapple curry fried rice nice   rest table enjoyed crispy pompano shrimp curry crab fried rice crispy tofu   definitely busy but service still managed decent   Considering very high ratings restaurant can't help but feel may missed whatever five star winner  <EOR> SOLID FOUR STARS    We crispy duck penang curry soft shell crab noodles both Yelp recommendations    Both awesome!!

Wait long always even Sunday night 850pm  However seated bar ordered drinks first  Thai teas all around course!

Cheers happy eats! <EOR> The last time Thai food good when Bangkok  Curry sauce 6 5  Holly molly gastronomically great food  <EOR> I'm partial Anthony Bourdain  Fond even  imagine narrating dishes poetic prose  Hearing he visited Lotus Siam put place head over family! 40 minute wait table but very excited   The menu large  many choices  Quality over quantity said  would appreciated server spending more time recommending traditional Northern Thai dishes but perhaps when spare attention    We ordered quite few dishes but came temperature didn't lead believe sitting front fan hot summer day   Spicy Chicken Wings Issan style Beef Jerky Tom Yum Kai Seared Scallops Chili Basil Leaves Drunken Noodles Soft Shell Crab Garlic Prawns Braised Short Rib Panang Crispy Duck Panang  I don't request dishes brought back any reason but find taste cold fried food incredibly off putting  prawns only dish asked of  would felt exhausting request every dish reheated  then there's question how? warming dish? microwave sparing few precious minutes wok?  Business good Lotus Siam thanks celebrity visits  Maybe some extra funds they'll invest better warming lamps dishes teach chefs runners better coordinate timing sending food out  There's much potential know want believe it  reason back try again  In perfect world temperature hot foods would definitely order drunken noodles garlic prawns again everything else uninspiring <EOR> Best Thai found Las Vegas  sketchiest little strip mall ever seen but once inside forget all that   I always bring out of town friends because inexpensive pretty quick DELICIOUS  <EOR> After reading many positive reviews place no stopping visiting   arrived 9 30pm half hour before closing Saturday Labor Day Weekend   seated almost immediately but restaurant packed more people waiting in   We ordered two dishes everyone seems talking soft shell crab drunken noodles garlic prawns   dishes came very quick efficient   drunken noodles disappointment because noodles lukewarm clumped together   battered soft shell crab warm delicious but combine noodles good     The crispy prawns other hand astounding   garlic batter insanely good   way fry neat peel shell off crab but all way leave shell connected tail fry entire thing   When comes jumbo prawns itself shell fried   bit calcium eating shell     It 50 50 experience   sure if noodles hot soft place would 4 5 5 star experience   Service good efficient  <EOR> The best Thai food ever Las Vegas   or entire United States? know Thai food anywhere but hear out!  TIPS Lotus Siam located inside little mall may hard find given drive around circles first looking entrance strip mall    FOOD Thai food delicious high quality! Never thought I'd say Thai food since most your run mill Thai restaurants super cheap fast food  However definitely taste quality ingredients Lotus Siam uses  Pad See Ew Usually greasy oily ton sauce  However Pad See Ew Lotus Siam wasn't greasy all perfect balance sauce  Furthermore vegetables weren't bitter tasted very sweet! Tom Kah Kai Soup Delicious but beware chili pepper hot! However milky coconut spicy soup perfect balance  Papaya Salad usually fan Thai papaya salad prefer darker Lao style since  ate growing up  However Papaya salad Lotus Siam delicious!   OVERALL Highly recommend everyone come eat here  <EOR> Amazing food! recommend reservation take while if just walk in    but worth wait  <EOR> This place awesome!!   Location Ghetto ass shopping center if night looks pretty docile empty everywhere else area   Food I Nam Kao Tod appetizer which great  Good amount food appetizer dish tasted amazing  would order again  entree Pad See Ew noodle dish over grilled duck  Since bachelor party sample many noodle dishes mine probably being most popular  If love duck love Pad See Ew MUST try! other duck dishes w noodles but Pad See Ew option favorite    Service We group 12 worked great  Service fantastic tended well  Everything came timely manner too  I'd def recommend doing reservations because serious  If you'll waiting long time eat   Overall One best Thai places eaten at  Def would back try haven't yet another noodle dish  Prices fair menu HUGE! only tough part since indecisive  However being large group sharing everything made easier night  Cab strip isn't pricey all! <EOR> We beef pad thai special #68 difficult remember spelling kaag omm? 20  Hidden gem fail  You'd think place would great delicious food ridiculously cheap price bc its some ghetto plaza but far diamond roof  YES! when  inside its beautiful  Pretty pictures nice tables huge selection wines  even bar  place needs downtown! Deceiving! ADMIT! pad thai tasted great  but if finish literally 5 big bites $10 NO WAY  Filler FAIL! 68 inedible  put many different spices right flavor when you're almost finished can't eat bc curry much spices crap  bowl CURRY which honestly soup lol but really bc its just without coconut milk size bowl cereal much when maruchan  haha place should called TAPAS Siam!!! <EOR> Went lunch Buffet GONE! Miss it! Lunch item prices should lower smaller portions but menu all  wise  Food always excellent  Service okay  Don't know when back  Just dinner  <EOR> It's far trek strip but if you've car definitely worth stop mid trip! I'd say   it's worth if you're driving heading back home thus would suffer through traffic lunch   Oddly Tom Yum Soup came last lukewarm however delicious  also love ask spicy every single dish order   The Drunken Noodles Duck fantastic  Classic Pad See Ew   They also lot Northern Burmese dishes which rarely found Thai restauarants  only other Kao Soi heard being served Portland OR  never seen Green Chili Dip anywhere else   They also inch thick menu just wines!

So would imagine food quality would suffer bit because volume traffic BIT! actually found subtle hints improved flavor profiles combination natural ingredients  There's no heavy salt powdered spices mask otherwise dull flavors most places have    Most ethnic restaurants ideology heavily spicing road kill people would buy it  But if really knew would puke before table  Anyway mean easily mess fish spice but here  really it   The menu vast complex those don't know much Thai food ideally want large group much taste    This also probably only Thai restaurant country know such well selected wine list  think know wine but when saw shocked!

Although small duck best ever curry sauce fried rice    Tom Kah Kai never quite soup really maybe perhaps because don't Thai very often  flavors tangy sweet always leaving bunch surprises every gulp    Fried Whole Catfish opinion real winner  ordered last minute needing something BIG full the dishes small size   always quite skeptical ordering catfish always end tasting mud paddies due where caught  However raise catfish themselves tasted amazing  suggest ordering first takes longest cook    Fried Banana w Coconut Ice Cream Sticky Rice Philippines similar fried banana called Turon however fails comparison these  fried banana didn't taste drenched glaze oil  also fresh! coconut ice cream tasted really good  Nothing those store bough  sticky rice greatly balanced between sticky just plain soggy nice meet middle     LIKED Khao Soy people spicy food winner you! could only take 2 3 spoonfuls before tongue started burning mercy  However within those few bites loved flavors produced sweeter mild  ordered chicken but bit dry    Tom Kah Kai also whole range flavors it  Minty zesty tangy  All say very complex  array flavors but just right  only thing times bit sour me    Pad Thai pad Thai good  Nothing more nothing less    DISLIKED Nua Nam Tok beef super dry unless dip sauce  problem beef main spotlight dish  Skip it    Thai Tea admit drink good  However just much ice enough tea really call drink?  In contrast entering restaurant mixed feelings thinking overhyped left feeling happy content    Also kuddos waiter he only yellow patiently dealt questions what's good good recommended  <EOR> GREAT FOOD very attentive accommodating waiters service  location questionable but care long food customer service great into hood! <EOR> I enjoyed dinner Lotus Siam but blown away   hearing lot place but other long wait doesn't seem different other local Thai restaurants   pad see ewe good friends seemed enjoy tom kha gai pad Thai   appetizer chicken wings ordered  weren't all that   kind dry lacked flavor   basically tasted fried wings nothing them because whatever topped wasn't sticking them   practically begging dipping sauce   Unfortunately busy didn't chance ask anything add them  I would eat again if area would try lunch buffet   now place just okay   <EOR> This place little overrated  maybe ordered wrong things  way Lotus Siam did live expectations!

Yes they're good but if you've ever pad see ew pretty similar way cheaper other places     So why five stars place?? CRISPY DUCK W PANANG CURRY GARLIC PRAWNS!!!! There's reason hesitate now whenever think going into any other Thai restaurant     want those two specific dishes no but Lotus Siam deliver   two dishes combined life changingly good me   Yea they're expensive yes portions COULD larger but pure crack tell you!  don't putz around other items unless isn't your first time wanna try something different somehow don't crack laced food   Drooling write review    <EOR> Felt ripped off chicken rama recommended manager just grilled chicken satay peanut sauce top  22 dollars  <EOR> Wow!!! reading reviews try it!

Yes know probably 17 other ones town but haven't those yet  The lunch buffet some basic items change others do  All remember enjoy going Thursdays Mondays  TIP If going during week lunch try little early just past lunch rush grab table stand around wait 30 mins before being seated  Recently just expanded am sure if still problem not  <EOR> Came Lotus Siam friend's recommendation told best thai places America  place very good fact most complete consistently good thai restaurant  several dishes pananag larb crab fried rice sea bass drunken noodles some others  larb favorite amazing! only negative portion size little small side but other food good  Definitely would back next time Vegas  <EOR> You'd never expect such small place great! truly a hidden gem   Hubby decided take some take way home ended waiting 40 minutes order Chicken Satay Chicken Panang Curry  busy even taxis dropping off customers site! only downfall restaurant entrance first impression it  walk into cramped entrance greeted three ladies weren't very professional good speaking English  would've nice explained certain other menu options  Although I'd say food definitely worth wait  Hopefully next time could try something new ! <EOR> One best town! dishes never saw other Thai restaurants <EOR> We Thai restaurant middle nowhere just because yelp reviews  place looked rundown situated dilapidated strip mall  But when inside bustling people which big deal since Christmas Day  spicy Thai fried rice curry which husband we're both very tasty  <EOR> The food good very good  outstanding? No but its very good  problem owner manager very greedy  cater mostly tourists sadly became tourist trap  dont offer lunch menu if tourist pay full dinner menu prices plus friendly all  owner manager huge chip shoulder believes he above customers he wont even answer questions    He un polite rude  if want but dont expect much anymore  shame  <EOR> Like most reviews am gonna limb argue probably BEST Thai restaurant US  completely agree all you    My girlfriend came last trip recommended yelp wow am glad tried it  area didn't exactly look promising but once saw crowd inside knew something up  knew awesome meal   Food started Nam Kao Tod which Crispy rice mixed minced sour sausage green onion fresh chili ginger peanuts lime juice  spiciness perfect although much spice sensitive gf but she still enjoyed enough brave through it  Yum  4 5  Then Tom Kha Gai recommended waitress  when knew rave place yelp  taste perfect  taste would compare all tom kha yum variations to  Noone else comes close  Seriously  6 5? lol  Of course try Pad Thai  girlfriend always judge quality Thai restaurant based pad thai  Why? Because every Thai restaurant probably most popular Thai dish thus every Thai restaurant should only but better deliver quality  did disappoint  best Pad Thai ever had  another 6 5   Service waitress Thai lady  She practically recommended all dishes ordered even recommended which spices use bring flavor even more  Such sweet lady =] she huge tip P  Price price you'd expect pay Thai restaurant   I'd gladly pay each dish  Twice   I need more stars place  <EOR> We came around 5 20pm before restaurant even opened already huge line! However waiters kind enough give water while waiting  We ordered roasted duck curry which just delicious    actually wanted order more but refrained  The garlic prawns perfectly fried  couldn't taste garlicky flavor much but dish good appetizer  The softshell crab druken noodle also really good  noodles perfectly well done  The service pretty slow didn't receive food twenty minutes but waiter apologized actually comped jasmine tea Thai iced tea which nice touch  I recommend place but sure line early! <EOR> Update pace just flat amazing   Food off charts great  Duck chu chee pad woon seen several northern dishes everything incredible   Wine No matter many times come am consistently blown away both varietal selection very reasonable prices  house cab wonderful CA cab Hoopes  price per glass essentially 1 4 price bottle bought store  sure but gives idea reasonableness pricing  always Riesling selection unparalleled    Bottom line don't miss place   city soulless restaurants Lotus Siam stands apart  <EOR> Excellent food service!  Ambiance lack sucks! seedy area but Absolutely packed Sunday night!

Crispy Duck Penang The duck amazing   picky hell duck   wasn't overcooked   very light batter super crispy   Skin perfectly crispy   penang sauce wonderful   don't eat lot Thai food can't compare other places but really good   only compliant its relatively small portion price also over $20   Shrimp Pad Thai I figured try Pad Thai done proper   Now can't speak towards actual authenticity haven't Thailand but easily best Pad Thai had   shrimp also really large perfectly cooked   portion medium sized but price only around $12 definitely worth money   The place really hard find facing main road work find but worth it   definitely stopping every time bounce through Vegas  <EOR> My second visit lunch buffet good first which year ago  hot sour soup amazing could eat bowls it   The curry chicken also great few excellent entrees lunch buffet  Another pad thai which did love  orange chicken also very good especially paired fried rice   For dessert cookies fruit YUMMY fried bananas wrapped dough   $10 99 could spend hours buffet try everything  really bargain everyone should try once! <EOR> Rumored best Thai restaurant America say hype isn't far off   You tell LoS born small mom pop restaurant expanded meet demand blossomed through word mouth alone  calculated restaurant reputation built merit food  Pulling into dilapidated strip mall parking lot small tinge where hell we? The garlic prawns feature Jurassic sized shrimp shells peeled dangle same tail  battered deep fried garlicky crunch    The Khao Soi curry bright curry egg noodles light coconut milk cut lime juice  Highly recommend getting roasted duck  where fat carefully rendered down each piece crunchy moist without excess fat  Tastes cut duck confit add curry   The Tom Yum Tom Kai soups very complex but very concentrated  Sharply sour incredibly spicy despite medium level spiciness   messing around     Admittedly papaya salad  while good its own right  little under developed compared other dishes  papaya wasn't thoroughly beaten soften thus unable really take flavor dressing  Can't win them all!  Lotus Siam place insist stopping every trip Vegas now on  <EOR> Food very good here  gone lunch buffet twice very please meal just $10!  The thing would say buffet inconsistent  two weeks ago dish really enjoyed again today wasn't even buffet  Disappointing but some other good options well   All all good food good price! <EOR> My dearly departed friend Mark Maher recommended place!  truly most authentic Thai outside Thailand ever had   sure visit every time Vegas  Try back portion menu! <EOR> The service good but wish would open another spot towards other side town because long trek fave Thai place  ordered $45 snapper panang worth AF! <EOR> Amazingly delicious! am now believer Lotus Siam's hype! steak tartare salad awesomely yummy! beef jerky world!
