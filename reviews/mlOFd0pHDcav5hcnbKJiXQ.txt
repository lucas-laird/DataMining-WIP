I really don't know if should even writing this  first order Kuben haven't really sampled much menu  But good review! no harm done right?  Wow! ordered unagi bento miso soup salmon rice ball  initially subtracted two stars miso soup bland no wakame tofu  salmon balls inexplicably spicy! course Korean printing label should given clue    The bento box however beautifully prepared presented  would preferred some steamed sesame spinach instead included packaged salad sausage bit off putting both appearance taste but fully SIX SUSHI ORDERS' WORTH UNAGI! If ordered 6 orders unagi sushi sushi menu price $6 50 per order 2 pieces per order     well math! bento bit more twelve bucks plus taxes delivery tip  Great bargain! eel wasn't prime grade but wasn't cat food either  really salmon rice balls although unexpectedly spicy probably made in house actually ample size very tasty!  So minus just star really dismal miso soup    A word delivery service which suspect said third party  hour later guaranteed  Yelp helped though very promptly too  just bit hard getting customer service section YelpEat24 app   Good place lunch! looking forward trying other items menu  <EOR> Presentation truly where place shines  Still same quality all other fast sushi places  bad but fantastic  Pleasant service clean atmosphere <EOR> I Ordered delivery UberEATS first time  bentos came surprisingly well packed lots delicious side dishes ?   ordered eel bento loved it  Portion great plenty eel pickled radish boiled quail eggs bacon around sausage really good too  husband ordered beef onion bento  He enjoyed all side dishes too  BUT unlike eel bento very little meat rice  husband wasnt even done half rice time he finished meat  mini rolls also good enjoyed dressing came salad  Packaging really well done  Overall enjoyed it  would order again  <EOR> I came bento box But somehow ordered bowl   haha Well just decently bowl nothing special  Just rice warm wit sashimi thats much well     Inside clean n bright which it  There bar counter eat in  Seems just fast eat place eat n leave quick   I try bent box next time! <EOR> Awesome place!
