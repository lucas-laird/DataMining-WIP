Well terribly disappointed    I Rad Na which usually favorites  just big mistake    The noodles limp  Usually pan fried little crisp them  mushy fell apart soon hit mouth  almost slimy texture them    The chicken bland tough  WAY overcooked  chinese brocolli undercooked practically raw  gravy very sticky consistency whole dish looked terribly unappetizing    The service incredibly overbearing  think 6 people waited me  Every 2 minutes someone table  tried push dessert didn't offer any apology when told them didn't dish    I very disappointed since heard many good things    Oh well  stick Lemon Grass Thai! <EOR> I used frequent place alot   Until noticed portions smaller service put bad taste mouth   Bad enough tell myself never come back     Tonight year decided give place another try did take out     Thai Beef Salad portion small felt ripped off $8 95   tasted remember but worth it    Chicken chili fried rice didn't taste authentic nothing ordinary   Another disappointment   Shrimp Tom Yum Soup Found hair soup   Called spoke manager she said she would give credit next time     But sure want back place meal   $35 later   so disappointing  <EOR> Yum!  I love chicken pad Thai crab fried rice mango sticky rice!!

Fried Rice soup delicious  Food served quickly  Ambiance perfect  Can't wait come back! <EOR> Food great but horrible horrible customer service never back location again  Rude ass employees work there  Never again business  Disappointed because actually food job near by  type customer actually gives good tips but service received lady wouldn't penny me  lady name Sammy she needs watch she treat customers  She even mad because asked another chili sauce cup ridiculous smh <EOR> The food amazing here  service pretty good well  love eating here  generally eat curry dishes catfish delight  <EOR> I've eaten 4 times far food very good particularly curry dishes   However service leaves much desired nickle dime simple substitutions hence star rating   On service Every time gone felt couldn't girlfriend fast enough   Honestly pushy demanding patrons   we're sorts flip drop hat   being said when restaurant rushed table waitress came SEVERAL times while perused menu when did order apps entre staged   entres came immediately started eating soup   that probably biggest pet peeve any restaurant   Don't bring entre until we're finished apps   especially when specifically ask having same experience previous visit   Mind busy occassions     Finally when asked check waitress came litterally tossed middle table she walked without word   I found beyond rude   Again busy restaurant   On substitutions haven't asked many 4 visits but only find particularly odd rice   Most curry dishes come steamed white rice lady prefer brown rice which usually issue substituting   this place charges $3 brown rice   $3 isn't going kill anyone but comparison other Thai restaurants prices expensive side surprised there's charge all this   Now food really good but prices charge its shame don't focus service which very lacking  <EOR> We last night dinner took dead iphone a swim Encore Bech club Monday took its life over spring mountain hopes resurrection  Decided drown sorrows some Garlic Chicken  Being new Las Vegas native prowl good thai food specifically Garlic Chicken because dont know home really sure where go  route home Rainbow lot good luck joints area Oyshi Soyo Bamboo thought would give go   Well long story short cream cheese shrimp tempura awesome although something besides cream cheese shrimp might made little better garlic chicken pretty darn good  would say being close home being pretty darn good place eat definitely back  <EOR> What's like?
