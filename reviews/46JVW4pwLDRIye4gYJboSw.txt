In summary cutting costs restaurant significantly dimished its quality   back  <EOR> The service great everything else severely lacking   Ambiance late dinner reservation big family next kid crawling around floor laying chair sleeping whole time he over 5 years old    Food even good Italian cooking which average best   Plus brought antipasto tray which did order then charged exorbitant amount bill   risotto which cooked well but flavorless   boyfriend pesto pasta which just completely smothered pesto looked jar   wine selection good many half bottles but extremely overpriced   Other restaurants Red Rock MUCH better  <EOR> My dad said If need look prices menu don't eat !

She didn't offer bf another scotch even though clearly gone      The surprise came when bill  waitress charged extra patron shot    pretty furious  Why? because cant afford many shots patron want but because margarita absolutely wrong first place! extra shot cost $12 somehow more margarita itself $11   asked talk manager because thought maybe he may want know server wasn't par she wouldn't bring over  left  would feel horrible support staff tipping but honest didn't see busser anything  actually didn't pre bus bread plates cheese plates all    I WONT BACK!
