The food selection dismal  wasn't much choose from  tasted sub par  mean really below cheesiest buffet could find standards! Just nasty!  If wasn't rubbery unctuous as lard     say everything looked good   especially desserts  But once put your mouth very disappointing  almost $20 Champagne Brunch total ripoff    The star giving nice service waitress gave us  point asked each other think employees ever wonder customers door?  Ugh  the Tropicana uh Tropi ghetto now call avoid  anyway  doing some hotel renovations which hope good thing everything service under construction but plain sight   mess    the Tropi ghetto mess! <EOR> Don't come dinner   see buffet line walk past restaurant doesn't look appetizing   breakfast however different story   Well really   $10 99 breakfast but just know 10 30am stick around lunch buffet   Yeah being Asian am can't help but sticking around lunch breakfast prices   Neither buffets all great   breakfast's highlight omelet which didn't because line damn long chicken fried steak   scrambled eggs runny potatoes tasteless   can't really mess waffles just ok   As lunch all dishes brought gross   meatballs good Costco's   sad that?
