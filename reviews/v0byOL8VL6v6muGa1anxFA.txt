Definitely order if you're date though  You'll both stinky happy! There's more garlic entire town Gilford the worlds garlic capital   If added even more wouldn't bother me love garlic  pretty powerful though!  The Greek salad pretty standard romaine tomato feta balsamic vinaigrette dressing  very good bit spicy but otherwise particularly remarkable   The Mediterranean garlic bread Greek flatbread melted cheese  looked very dry crunchy but surprisingly supple   The crudités crudités  carrots could bit more slender   This great sampler looking forward trying some full plates menu  hardly wait try different shawarmas kabobs    If order delivery GrubHub there's no minimum no delivery fee although kinda forced into tipping driver   Don't hesitate choose establishment when ordering delivery! <EOR> This restaurant generated some hype but food doesn't live it  Lebanon nothing heavenly hummus made its region origin  piping hot bread H Factory hits spot but hummus just average  kafta dry unfortunately chicken shawarma lacked authentic spices mess eat  zucchini fries hit but better hummus sharwarma koobideh elsewhere Vegas  <EOR> I say place fantastic service food cleanliness wonderfully decorated space   We ordered shawarma plates chicken I beef zucchini fries two kids pizzas Checked received free hummus which fantastic   If haven't visited establishment missing out  must!!
