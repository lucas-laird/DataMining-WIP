When walked smelled fish which immediately put off  way sure chose fish cooked burrito  choices protein crab  thought tossed some kind cream sauce when scooped up   It mayonnaise  mayo strong couldn't taste anything else burrito  over powered everything just gross!!   I'm disappointed!  don't recommend    Update comment management didn't yum yum sauce holding side won't fix fact crab overwhelming amount mayo it  <EOR> My first time today say STINGY  basically paid twelve something bowl rice smallest amount fish smallest pieces any local poke place pinch seaweed asked little more? told sure extra charge! some cucumber! Wow What little fish anything great? love some other poke places town but place NO THANK YOU!!! <EOR> Stopped work check since flyer car   service great food good  Portion sizes werent bad  Even build your own    They extremely nice even offered hold kids ice cream freezer until done eating  <EOR> Check place out! more could ask employees going way helpful fresh fish delicious food reasonable cost? <EOR> This place just amazing!!! love reminds homestyle poke bowl shop!!! staff just great always helping craving decision fix!!!!

Food awesome! yourself favor cucumber mint juice   It'll change your life! Highly recommended!!! <EOR> I agree w other posts serving sizes small cost  few poke sushi burrito places smallest seaweed roll ever seen  just opened hopefully adjust portions  <EOR> I built own salad  Base lettuce  Proteins salmon shrimp crab  Sauces spicy mayo garlic ponzu screaming O  Various toppings  very yummy fresh  thought protein portions generous  reason took off star because if more two sauces $ 50 extra  don't mind extra charge but if going charge more give generous portion little squirt  <EOR> I ordered through grub hub started good experience but unfortunately some hiccups  easy order delivered reasonable time  However forgot add 3 things rice scallions spicy garlic sauce  thing mistake but 3 things just bad  What's even more frustrating didn't cash tipped 20%  total paid $18 salad wasn't right  When called person answered phone nice but she started asking employee made bowl whether he forgot those items  bowl sitting front think tell whether anything missing  She said would give whopping 10% discount NEXT order  Yay! $1 50 off  just feel didn't rectify situation very well  Especially since tipped blindly having faith hoping would sure bowl correct before delivering  fair tasted good but $1 50 off doesn't undeserved tip incorrect order  <EOR> I could addicted     The Dragon Poke bowl bomb  All flavors just perfectly melt into each other   I sub seaweed salad pineapple because eww   But next time mosey into going sub edamame red onion   Five stars having vegan set menu   Us veg heads LOVE kinda shit don't build shit customizing the whole world of vegetables look some picky asshole   It just turn into bland dumb salad cool   thus shall return again again try very own special menu  love that  Yes am speaking all vegans whole wide world      I really Ginger Twist Sauce   This considered cheat day because pretty sure metric ton oil going on   like even brown rice seemed oily me  Carb fine but without all oil sheesh! sesame oil exact   The smiling young lady asked sauté swirl twirl tofu around bowl Ginger Twist Sauce marinate course said ok! Hell yes all fancy marinate hell those tofu bean squares! But think next time opt sauce side because its oil   I love she offered 1 2 greens 1 2 brown rice   but next time pass rice because personally think its oily   At end asked add crispy garlic keep those sexy vampires away  always love fried garlic places   but regret later   I'll never vamp'd rate  Darn   You add tip it ask % your card transaction    Four stars fresh food smiling faces  star cheat day extreme garlic no vamp attitude D <EOR> Very friendly staff  Fresh good sized portions seafood   Large variety toppings  Good prices  <EOR> My husband came Poke Addiction first time very pleased! came knowing nothing very welcomed informed every option possible  hard finding place vegan omnivore happy once   The food plentiful fresh  Toppings high quality can't wait back! <EOR> Tucked away next Whole Foods little gem spot  place super clean employees very helpful kind  couple options bowls burritos  build your own concoctions they've dreamt up  fish fresh spicy tuna excellent level heat  choose your base proteins sauces toppings  Can't $11 95 for large bowl   also kids menu which major plus! definitely returning  <EOR> What paid $12 bowl rice  ordered signature bowl Pride the flavor sauce strong which good presentation bowl nice but PORTION fish 2 grams! toppings cucumber mango etc all under gram! Wow  If want last long sure give customers worth money  <EOR> I start saying lot poke places Vegas none them annoyed much one  first two times service food okay but only few weeks opening  mind assumed because staff new getting familiar process  However tonight when exact same thing  only three scoops protein equivalent scoop just protein everywhere else charge extra veggies everything else think of  told kid ahead add some edamame extra 50 cents whatever was  He did even smaller scoop then first free one  When asked keep putting more he gave dirtiest look  honestly really disappointed closest poke bowl place house because returning  only good thing place spicy mayo sauce  Hence two stars  Why oh why Jaburritos far me? Sigh! <EOR> I don't usually yelp but     pretty disappointed  Staff friendly but saw them prepare burrito wrap its very very very careful small portions give  other sushi burrito places charge $8 way more protein choices  Tried probably won't coming back  overpriced  <EOR> This place AMAZING! best poke place town  am literally addicted getting poke bowls every week now  found them GrubHub easy order online everything want all best stuff your bowl without them charging extra everything  <EOR> I area decided try out  regular sized Build Yourself bowl  menu decent but when order     their verbiage confusing  example choosing toppings asked many toppings without extra charge  answer confusing  something effect choose all them but any extra topping extra cost  Ok does mean? some clarification choose any toppings all them but if want double same topping more $  Same much protein choose  three choices protein  verbiage should more clear menu well  guy helped mumbles talks under breath could hardly hear him  Plus if you're short which am not would speak over tall glass sneeze barrier  Over all clean nice decent portion size $14 Arizona tea  Would come back? wouldn't first choice  If only Poke store Craig closer Centennial Hills  <EOR> I've few poke places town! clean everyone professional nice  sushi burrito everything fresh delish!

Haven't seen elsewhere  love crispy garlic  also ice cream macaron sandwiches   However    over time appear consistency issues  Protein portion varies signature bowl options aren't best  You're better off customizing better value  Service also hit miss super friendly staff like Kim others barely say word  others said some ingredients don't match description red onions being described sweet onions some reason  hoping stick around location because convenient work gym but room improve  <EOR> I ordered Wrath Bowl asked no onions  When arrived home realized added onions didn't give any tuna  Pretty upset considering drove some distance try poke  <EOR> Fresh fish  choose 4 proteins unlimited toppings condiments  wrap burrito nachos use mixed greens noodles rice base  Food excellent! <EOR> I never leave reviews but since eat 5 times month figured should  always delicious  bad bowl yet  tried all menu ones well almost every variation BYOB  Delicious keep good work  <EOR> Omg!  place amazing  If love Poke even sushi come here  your own bowl wrap lot choices  Pick your fish then your sauce then toppings  Delish <EOR> The sauce choice amazing!
