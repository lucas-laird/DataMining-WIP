Well found out  First all ambiance fun lot great features Mexican culture  taco truck front place cool addition  Lotteria cards table cards cool idea  car seats booth seating pretty nice well stringed lighting feel you're backyard LA  ordered 3 horchatas  great recommend them! However literally child size plastic cup drink  Thumbs down presentation portion that  Then home made guava flan came out  bland  can't taste guava all  why even put there? Thumbs down  flautas came out  Presentation awesome! Portion perfect really really good! Two Thumbs up  Then main course  Asada tacos pretty good  say tortillas decent but little thick side them thinner  tried chicken mole good but don't recommend taco  Just dish beans rice because sauce think taco  very disappointing dish Al Pastor!! burrito taco style  both fell flat short taste quality  Just let know    PERFECT Al Pastor should piña chopped marinated meat meat should tender because acidity pineapple  Neither things happened found myself having worse Al Pastor ever life  Which very upsetting because happens favorite meat  Beans rice fresh  All tortilla chips overcooked burnt! Even nieto wouldn't eat them he LOVES chips! service  greeted female server very helpful friendly  recommend keeping because she's funny pays attention everything  going restaurant  didn't name but she's crazy  good way  sure you'll figure out  other server happens pregnant she opposite  She needs home work eatery people  She didn't look she wanted quiet looked tired which again if she's pregnant maybe she shouldn't work type job  Especially safety issue because if she falls!? She could hurt herself baby   She actually made experience little bad because she wasn't friendly upbeat place itself  feel bad because know must tiring work but enormous amount money being shelled patrons your overpriced food really need consider serving it! bill came $82  Yes $82  3 kid size horchatas 2 bland flans 2 flautas 1 burrito taco combo plate kids quesadilla which way asked gave box could take server never brought put said forget left behind 7 asada tacos  literally $16 5 tacos!

I found alcohol surprisingly pricey across board but some offerings   bar seems work progress opened restaurant did   bartender brought taste Riesling label I'd never heard 14 Hands   Terrific overpriced   All staff friendly pleasure   fish taco experience end being greatly insulted waiter inept attempt friendly and still upset would 5 star review  <EOR> This nice place grab drink some food  Careful though bill racks quickly   seemed bit pricey me  Bummer because great atmosphere bar tacos would good fun casual place visit more often  cost little less   food pretty good  experience slow service showed 30 minutes before happy hour ended hoped squeeze 2 drinks but just didn't service time   Anyway overall good would still come back time time  wouldn't call best mexican food around but bad all  <EOR> If could give place million stars would  tacos amazing! fish taco VERY lightly fried flaky fresh  shrimp taco bursting flavor!
