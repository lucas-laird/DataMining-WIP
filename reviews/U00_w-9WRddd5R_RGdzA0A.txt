It's hard find Chicago Style town but Pizza Nine really came close  Chewy thick butter crust quality toppings    Also try tiramisu  Real good! <EOR> So far very dissapointed most best pizza places visited Vegas  thoroughly understand respect  all VERY different opinions great pizza should taste like  dough type sauce ingredients amount cheese should have  Thin crust deep dish square vs round etc  But think all agree flavor quality ingredients proper combination them crutial execute great tasting pizza  Well think place met most expectations when comes pizza  ordered 2 medium pizzas first basic pepperoni cheese  Second Hawaiian style  crust amazing! Crispy edges yet soft doughy   right balance sauce cheese well toppings  pepperoni specially  tasty  family ate entire pizza all commented much liked it  pick order pizza arrived hot steamy  size pizza did dissapoint either  first time ordered considering some reviews restaurant am sure if lucky order if service quality fact improved recently based reviews if long time since bought pizza any restaurant around but experience satisfying definately order place again  <EOR> Ordered UberEat pizza arrived 40 minutes which reasonable however arrived cold no way order again  PS pizza didn't even taste standard !! <EOR>
