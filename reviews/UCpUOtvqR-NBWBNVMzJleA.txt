Service sucks! <EOR> Wow Blue Martini seriously joke now new management HORRIBLE!   Friends yesterday using lady VIP cards drink ticket checked facebook drink ticket used valet coupons drink ticket all which done before without issue i'm weekly basis   Well last night told exploiting them using those tickets because each 2 3  sorry YOUR loyalty comp program we're ones exploiting it?  But  worst it   decided move outside patio manager told finish drinks leave but manager came back right friends face YELLS her!!! He said moved tables try scam another server  ridiculous! Now cocktail servers tweeting saying two sides every story manager yelling warranted because management easy deal   kidding me??!! happened customer always right? Especially when completely calm throughout entire situation did absolutely nothing wrong   I loyal Blue Martini customer since opened but no longer patronize them when treat LOYAL customers way   As friend just commented Wow getting threatened taking advantage deals put place    because perfect sense  <EOR> We arrived couple drinks having dinner nearby   Took more 10 min waited on  had flag server   Placed two drink order right away   15 min later   NO drinks  20 min server hurried apologize stated bartender so     Busy    another 15 minutes left     No stopped us   No cared     Won't back   what waste 30 minutes time  <EOR> Nice little place outdoor patio  Mosquitoes gather when gets dark  great place cocktails lite fair  Servers could little more attentive  <EOR> I couple times both times really fun  Small dance floor but great music!

If policy boot your table once bottle empty then fine   I they're trying money   but least give option purchasing another one  guess pissed off most all fact tipped server WELL ahead time she still don't give shit attitude  Sad because if she would treated right would taken good care her  Even management didn't seem care only offered replace full drinks    not table  only person all back Hookah girl     bad customer service no matter look unfortunately left such bad impression likely never come back  big baller some work hard money when spend much expect better service  <EOR> Went sunday    Young Old crowd    its spacious drinks moderately prices hip hop music hookah    food  cool environment    alright couple cool your friends     <EOR> Just last night  wasn't impressed fact charge COVER    So you're telling pay 5 bucks into RESTAURANT?

Tips definition product proper service they're requirement good service=good tip bad service      guess no tip!  First chase waitress around order drinks  started going towards bar stand but security type guy stopped said waitress come table  10 15 minutes later he ended taking drink order himself      wait another 15 20 minutes drinks table   Than ordered some food took almost 40 minutes because some reason 1st time delivered another table!!!      bla bla bla ready move next venue easy because took damn waitress another 30 minutes check! Heck!!!! forgive anything but WHEN WAIT CHECK! Come people     want your money your damn overpriced drinks you?  So confess first time all years stiffed left zero tip  could insult course put few coins but decent mood even all crap  Am just bitching? May am     but customer always right isn't he? P S  While standing balcony witnessed nasty act hit and run b*tch trying turn around turn reverse turn hit car parallel parked right front BM  bad didn't see plate number otherwise I'd definitely turn in  Morale story don't parallel park center Town Square risk getting hit some drunk f**k <EOR> This really cool scene Las Vegas locals  ambiance cool there's always lot people  Mixed crowd    Drinks run $12 14 each but half price during Happy Hour  4pm 8pm daily  $6 each great deal because fill your martini glass then give shaker two drinks one    The martini menu expansive  tried lot drinks they're all good  only only ever didn't chocolate bar one  tasted straight vodka  But caramel swirl yummy!    The place huge I think three different bar areas  There's music inside  highly suggest checking out  <EOR> Used great place 5 yrs ago so     they cheap drink quality less liquor crappy mixers    hard find server even order most times  Very limited food menu    they attitude when enter staff seems pretty uncaring rude most times some still great though     happy hour really no great deal half price getting half price off overpriced insane regular drink price!  Good if never want try hook but much better places days Vegas  <EOR> Honest people! left CA Drivers License sent thru mail few days  Good food drinks being served  You'll feel safe because there's some Police Officer going around area check what's going on! girlfriends California much fun!

Nice atmosphere too <EOR> I friend happy hour   loved appetizers waitress great   actually nice experience  why 2 stars?  Well several Martinis different flavors delicious but no alcohol them   disappointed  Happy hour prices should interfere bartenders drinks  felt rip off  Especially since attended function several months later Marriott hotel Blue Martini advertising giving free mini martinis try promote themselves  Well mini martinis gave buzz   thing don't appreciate false advertising   don't drink alcohol very much   But when order martini expect alcohol   hate when hear bartenders watering down drinks   Bar tabs pricey why give people paying for    As much did enjoy atmosphere think pass Blue Martini  Bu bye  <EOR> Sorry yes give 1 star  5 friends literally here  Sat outside waited 40 minutes no waitress approached place isn't even busy  Come find waitress flirting other table  no gotten orders yet because she busy flirting  hookah lady said she orders but she forgot   Instead bar drinks  Service terrible   staff shouldn't flirting all staying 3 guys shining cellphones her  Finally sat different table  different waitress approached perfect quick  But already drinks bar less 5 minutes  Again terrible high expectations customer service especially Vegas  <EOR> Been drinks several times its good spot off Strip casual drinks  Good beer selection excellent mixed drinks  But isn't Blue Martini remember  must change management trying turn into club atmosphere  only thing missing rope line!  Unfortunately dress code 8pm its strictly enforced  dressed nicely polo shirt loafers but refused entry because won't admit anyone shorts  doesn't matter its Wednesday its 100 degrees Vegas tonight  Ridiculous if ask me   I drink less pretentious spot downstairs Yardhouse  <EOR> Love swanky open air atmosphere  Decent food  Seems high priced but shaker glass its more 2 2 5 martinis each  Fun place happy hour  <EOR> With review start off 5 stars start subtracting stars things found off place Start 5 stars 1 star $20 cover Wednesday night really? 1 star Wednesday ladies night but definitely sausage fest clever marketing team you've there    1 star pricey drinks place close strip Bottom line 2 stars  It's bad because wanted place talking friends live Vegas gone many times past   think happy hour specials but review getting around 11pm Wednesday night   told ladies night but guess bunch guys same memo sausage taco ratio skewed toward sausages   On top drinks pretty weak charge $9 Stoli mixer barely tell alcohol your drink   friends paying $12 $13 martinis but guess give little more since give shaker take pour rest when you're ready   Would come back?

However wait staff particularly Cassandra husband nicknamed Cum Sandra because she cared more tables flashing male parts wallets tables generally needed service  She never acknowledged everyone party multiple times chase down complete order  Because she just darted off without verification completion  She asked credit card hold tab which more fine but intent pay cash  She charged card when asked void receipt she could fulfill such request  could continue but if looking GREAT VIP host Jason your guy  But warned wait staff minimal level customer service expected  <EOR> Fun place good atmosphere great martinis good food!

First off $10 cover bar  off main strip eh   although did good DJ Gilbarba kept going well even uncoordinated white men bumping grinding   The lighting spectacular  bar set artistic  staff attractive sharp uniforms   But maybe worst service ever seen club this  started off high top just removed bar even though hookahs which should mean servers no stopped ask if needed anything  when bar drink bar top covered old drinks trash  As all high tops surfaces inside club  if every came ordered once then servers all home  disgusting eventually point where felt no need use ashtray   just use ground didn't care why would anyone else   I bar drink girl looks says minute   Did she serve another customer? NO she group friend told jokes giggled  When server stopped ask if needs anything said 'water' did come back? NO  must seen 5 6 different servers standing sowing circle bullshitting while entire room looked remains child's birthday party  Only once did see ploy assume GM way floor  even he pointed problems room remained mess   The floor plan interesting  There's outside patio area  kind nice  quieter removed section allows easier conversation clean air  But main room terrible set up  barely see dance floor dance floor  There's huge columns angles way clear view  best spot viewing anything good filled DJ just stands there  think need rethink layout  However having said all mix persons very cool collection all races ages personalities  dress nice comfortable casual dress when could see sexy outfits along stylish wardrobes jeans sweaters  kind acceptance feel you're always right place   In closing almost say place great spite itself   Although definitely more ladies place men least regards male female ratio    Would again?  problem  maybe if knew reason to  But just catch regular party likely  More 2 5 3 least far nightlife goes  saddest thing 2 5 could easily 4 5  Just needs someone hammer nails  <EOR> Terrible service!!!! First off Alissa did apologize once card definitely missing 15 mins since your server lost it  Also did accuse lying stating believe your server returned supposedly looked camera prove us  also extremely rude short myself raising your voice stepping back placing your hand face should never disrespect customer when your establishment misplaced lost whatever want call card  Also card found no help server lost  yourself  should stop making worse don't respond review wrong terrible experience end story  <EOR> Banning VGK jerseys? clearly don't support local community  Why should community support them? <EOR> Happy Hour still great still good place off strip nice relaxed but still somewhat classy atmosphere  Ask Conitra best bartender there! <EOR> I give place 5 stars local Las Vegas multiple Happy Hour places yesterday first time Blue Martini would say can't any where else    ambience relaxing mix drinks excellently priced food delicious n portions good company 3   highly recommend place those love Happy Hour   Must try Lobster Salad  <EOR> This go to happy hour spot years now  last couple times friends poor experiences    Service Servers always give hard time splitting tabs  When them seems though never correct re do few times before getting right    Eats keep taking things off menu good adding new items    Drinks strong  Plus used enough 2 drinks 1 martini one poured more shaker   Now you're lucky 1 it  Just don't give shaker when basically empty    You cannot happy hour hours 4 8 pm 7 days week still end regardless  <EOR> Happy hour happy anymore ahi app 8 now 13 along most apps almost doubled Tommy Bahamas better deal now <EOR> One fav happy hours til 8pm martinis fun delish half off!

Furthermore I'd them explain why because male shirt can't camouflage  Why does assumption penis attire any more harmful female counterparts easily could've wearing similar fabric  always easiest recommendation clients looking entertainment away Strip but we'd embarrassed suggest place someone spent time money traveling follows rules they're provided only turned away insulted soliciting bribes  experience shameful sexist unethical embarrassing  <EOR> So bar decent happy hour 4 8 half priced drinks reduced food costs  all positive things review have   Service very good  waited 25 minutes before even having someone take order then missed appetizer ordered  general hard service more few times request things drinks such multiple times   Our appetizer Caprese salad seemed someone heard decide but never actually tried real Caprese salad  salad greens mixed greens horrible choice clearly made reduce costs easier use those same greens other salads  mozzarella wasn't good way little balsamic vinegar   The food ordered lamb ahi tuna dish all impressive either  lamb ordered medium rare served medium well lamb wasn't seasoned very well along some pretty basic simple potatoes peas  seared ahi tuna dish fine but  all going it  sauces provided could should much more aggressive flavors  Again all felt someone read somewhere dishes but never actually experienced should be   The drinks meh  bourbon coke fine  Mango Tango actually decent drink  signature Blue Martini ok if all care lot alcohol anything else just avoid it  particularly pleasing combination flavors no idea why would main advertised drink   I can't recommend place any way  wasn't awful but really nothing worth even half paid  <EOR> Well definitely huge crowd when came here   really hard find place sit    Drinks weren't hard thought would people crowding around bar   food pretty good such lobster taco   place lot bigger would've thought  going be   Live music played   no cover before 11 30 but friends pay $5 in   There's small dance floor   definitely 30's crowd there   Drink prices felt close club prices   inside decor also pretty nice   Service food hard however   took good 30 40 min before waitress came back order food   much place chill since if hard find table   Some people tried charge $20 would've let take table   Obviously didn't take because going leave anyways   Atmosphere's ok   dress code   No hats shorts basketball shoes   Chucks acceptable  <EOR> Let's see rude inattentive staff crawling Kia drivers acting Ferrari owners older singles desperately trying hook yet acting aren't other group taken people attempting scam free over priced drinks some single fool  Safe say opinion if your spot then classify douche <EOR> Yelp paid off place  ordered pink passion martini appetizers crab cake spinach dip shrimp crab dip flat bread  Everything delicious  ambiance great  could place every Las Vegas visit  only down fall      it hard locator  <EOR> very nice place grace very professional service plus drinks bomb <EOR> Love place great food great environment beautiful people live music amazing LOVE band Barry Black definitely opinion  <EOR> I used come because friend friend knew some bar tenders but place kind pathetic  extremely overpriced frankly when order cocktail I'd actually some additions liquor   If wanted shot vodka rocks I'd ask it  happened numerous occasions last time server girl smirked though should able handle alcohol  Firstly alcoholic frankly even would trouble stomaching drink served  Secondly lived 5 continents bartended 4 think know cocktail  last few times service slow very personable any staff member  If looking buy overpriced drinks off Strip Double Helix just below place  servers friendly although drinks expensive least know mix them  <EOR> nice place   cool atmosphere   mixed crowd   lots locals   want come back! <EOR> This great place if looking club but want good music good drinks want smoke some hookah!

No matter state Blue Martini MUST ! just love place ! location also hookah even better !!! <EOR> What waste   towner MALES pay $20 in    least friends' experience   total rip off wedding party wanted appearance but forced pay     Crowded venue particular Saturday night December   Looks late 20's 30's crowd   much else say bar there's dance floor   you're Vegas       I guess place localers since mall setting away strip tourists   FIne but towner would rather spent $20 cover fee elsewhere  <EOR> While easily give BM two stars previous times in which customer service horrendous especially entrance decided give three sake Latin Night Thursday nights  sure if industry night every night if just Thursdays but group able blue wristbands could drinks 50% off  bad deal considering while most drinks mediocre best mojitos pretty good we all different flavors regular raspberry watermelon mango! Yum! Their dance floor little non existent but couldn't help dancing table latin beats  Latin Nights seem generate crowds admit music pretty good upbeat  live band which course themselves mediocre nothing entirely special mainly did covers top 40 songs   food little bland ordered spinach artichoke dip chicken beef rice plates lacked considerable flavor them    I would recommend people hitting BM Latin Nights Thursday nights seeing great time music company despite everything else plain jane  <EOR> Here VIP event Where  Great drinks food decent too  Fun atmosphere  <EOR> BLUE MARTINI! I believe happy hour 6 8  Half off all food drinks!
