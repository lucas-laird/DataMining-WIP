Meh  I'd rather down street far better finds Vegas  bad  <EOR> Decent fast food cheesy setting kind forgettable  place work its location convenient but would recommend going your way place    They stay open very late its good pit stop michies delivery    For some odd reason karaoke late night but doesn't look fun inviting  Unlike some other divey places Vegas place lacks any charm perhaps because servers unfriendly cold  Everytime young Asian American kids work bland hilarious cartoonishly millennial act but bad way  <EOR> I mean    If making delivering orders difficult maybe you're wrong business    husband put order food grubhub 10 54pm told accepted being made 10 54  said latest would food which ridiculous but do 12 05  Keep mind tipped 20% advance without waiting see service going apparently mistake   11 50 kind wondering where food because seriously ordered other Asian places way farther away gotten really good food within 30 minutes  Needing over hour pretty ludicrous  tried calling number three times each phones seemed shut off? very professional  Finally through 11 56 someone very bluntly asked address then only detail already delivery minutes   12 35 call delivery driver asking directions  husband gave simple directions follow but he simply couldn't comprehend them husband ended having street meet delivery driver food  took 10 54 12 38 food couldn't even door  least food amazingly still hot  don't recommend place unless want pay delivery person money when deliver your own food yourself  say though food pretty good  stars process delivery  <EOR> I'm feeling under weather today ordered level 10 tom yum shrimp soup love flavor other Thai resturant going years but really wanted good hot level 10 ok guys your point across!!  freaking amazing!!  customer life!
