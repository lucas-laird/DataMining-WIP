After tease shrimp shrimp taco wife during first time hell bent getting grilled shrimp burrito recent trip darned if didn't walk championship belt bell rung  partnered pineapple salsa which thought oh no recycled sauce burrito?!? but no experience WAY different before which tip sombrero to  No wants same experience twice unless positive   Ha ha  shrimp though far scrimped pardon pun between perfect grilling passionate seasoning packs quite punch  Please give shot feel El Jefe check arrives!  What hold head down fully experimenting dessert menu  date much disappointment waiter wife chose traditional Flan  Sorry if Flan connoisseur don't follow crowd when picking meal but next time sure am attacking immensely popular cinnamon churro ice cream sandwich  far Flans good but fair blown away pains more impressed   consistency bit thick more mimicked Flan mother law but personally prefer softer Flan  didn't quite taste kiwi but actually glad didn't since don't see why that'd Flan and  even being advocate kiwi   All all still tasty way wrap meal don't wrong but claim fame ice cream sandwich fine conform next visit   Whether plane train automobile cruise over Libre sway those hips A+ meal exquisite culinary wonders! <EOR> 1st time taco tuesday   means bottomless tacos margaritas $25  interior very nice outside seating   hostess looks supermodel  Fun times  <EOR> Come see Xavier Libre Mexican Cantina   He  recommend new favorite appetizer Corn Fritters made first visit Libre memorable  We'll definitely back  <EOR> Had work dinner drinks evening must say     The cocktails definitely worth trying  The Heated Moment couldn't enough!
