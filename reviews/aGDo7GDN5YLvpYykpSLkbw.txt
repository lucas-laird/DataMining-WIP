Hard where live unfortunately when travel usually try search see if any destination city   Did before recent last minute trip Vegas?? Uhhh NO!  But luckily sister stumbled across little gem back magazine   yay us!  I dubious place due its location   mean really good could be?  part crusty old Howard Johnson's rather run down dare say skanky? part town   not exactly inspiring!  But lure platano maduro cannot nay denied off Florida Cafe went!  The restaurant cute enough inside nice tropical feel perhaps bit tired but relaxed easy going vibe   waitress gracious accomodating service fairly prompt   No complaints   We started off ensalada de aguacate  large portion avocado nice presentation   it served dry missed ubiquitous yummy garlicky dressing come expect   made due oil vinegar available but just wasn't same  Still tasty though   For entrees both opted black beans rice course all time fav platano maduro!!   First off beans cooked perfectly   dark rich flavorful   Deeelish!   platano sweet ripe fried plantain heaven!!  uberyummy   soft sweet dark dark brown almost looked burnt but trust  good thing!! chewy carmelized edges   God live those crusty edges!!!!  Yea weird way!  Oh bread yummy too!  So best Cuban food ever had?  No reserved Versailles Miami lesser degree La Cubana Glendale   But really good   reasonable tasty very satisfying   though cannot vouch any other offerings more pleased experience am looking forward next visit Vegas Florida Cafe!  And yes did take 2 additional orders platano maduro home me!!!  God love shit! <EOR> I today Florida Cafe birthday disappointment order Ropa Vieja fiance order some appetizer food cold Cuban restaurant Las Vegas really disappointment since don't many Cuban restaurants area  only did food horrible service very poor professional would recommend place know one   oh yeah $3 soda really! <EOR> We around holidays last year  am very familiar Cuban food place mediocre put kindly  would survive Miami  Visit you'll see    For starters use low quality ingredients yet charge full price  steak ordered did even grill marks fillet very skinny  could find similar quality steak Mexican restaurant 1 4 1 3 off they'll stuff fixings e g  chips salsa which compensates    I ordered salad all greens iceberg lettuce very pale almost white  could thrown few pieces romaine butter and or green leaf lettuce s add some life color  asking escarole French leafy greens  Even buffets better less  paid mainly meat salad   disappointing because even homemade salads better this    Though don't eat bread relative told tasted okay but she's better  She ask real butter because gave margarine  waitress stated butter but relative explained difference between margarine butter Spanish   when she point  meat accompanying sauce very flavorful   why didn't give them 1 star    I sense nickel dime everything because they're Las Vegas Blvd  Technically Strip yet begun location because still considered part Downtown  only means badlands only few blocks away  If drive around night you'll see mean  Location everything   The service okay but waitress tried overcharge not lot money cool  <EOR> Food bad  However if planning taking your partner San Valentine arrive restaurant around Jan 2 because service extremely slow every single time  <EOR> I twice before mostly because love cuban food   better before but never great   liked maduros but it     I ordered amazon local gift deal like groupon where $20 food $10  Showed waitress before eating then ordered   ordered more usual because $20 voucher     When time pay told sure she took $20 off   She didn't take off ran credit card full amount said because manager wasn't couldn't use it!!!! WHAT?????  She told come eat another time use maybe manager would there     I politely said Couldn't call manager amazon com? She said really    She also said she couldn't refund any money because she already ran credit card   scam    I angry never back again   much repeat customer   advise anyone never go   Worst service ever  food wasn't even good  <EOR> This review Bar ONLY  didn't eat   This place laugh litle    decor interesting characters saw inside  Nothing WRONG just kind made giggle smile  Tehehehe   We attending very fabulous formal fancy shotgun wedding Little Chapel next door  early Chapel running late  Shotgun weddings booze hand hand stopped HOJO saw Cafe  Perfect  bar    The bartender friendly made some wonderful drinks! Granted only Captain 'n Cokes but hey some MEAN Captain 'n Cokes hit spot  thought maybe since inside HOJO close downtown drinks would cheap  Wrong  Try $7 each  Damn steep nearly downtown but guess technically strip     If ever area need quick drink definately stop in  Maybe even try some food next time  <EOR> This new Cuban restaurant  arrived around 930 pm Saturday night Fourth July 1 2 hour before closing  Plenty parking back  Friendly staff  Efficient service Micheal  Clean dining room  food very good  Would sampled bread but heard waiter chef already cleaned bread because he didn't think anyone else coming in  sad  tostones shrimp manchengo cheese appetizer delicious  entrees roast pork pernil sautéed onions  Very tasty  accompanied black beans white rice plate both excellent! husband  Ropa Vieja beef and he loved it   full try any dessert but definitely back again point saving room some flan tres leches cake cafe con leche  <EOR> So decided whim would try place lunch reviewing previous Yelpers reviews  all   my palate trust!  drove Howard Johnsons navigated extremely narrow driveway park rear   then sauntered into restaurant where promptly warmly greeted man shall refer Julio  Julio promptly seated then asked cursory restaurant questions asked he tell good lunch   Julio said everything  He then asked appetizer typical Cuban fashion he spoke friggin fast all caught fried   potato   and beef!  said sure  He brought appetizer fast thought he may pulled off another table   surprisingly very good tasty   I'd love tell proper name but again all heard fried   potato   and beef! The waitress came ordered chicken breast marinated citrus garlic covered grilled onions   She also spoke very fast accent thick apparently ordered avocado salad well   The food came rather quickly avocado salad turned fully sliced pitted avocado very small plate greens   marinated chicken breast covered grilled onions served white rice black beans   Needless say food although expected actually quite delicious   The decor very Caribbean themed music   nutshell I'd promptly back again just try something else off menu  <EOR> Very disappointed  large party dinner  also another large party around same time  service extremely slow  took over 1 1 2 hours food served  When finally served plates bad smell coming plate  smelled pork dish only find pork spoiled  6 dishes sent back  place would never back to  <EOR> I visited restaurant because wife insisted awesome    guess what   it was!!!!!!!!! show canot always reviews!!!!! service excellent guy came very cordial checked more once food hot tasty walked half mile ge there!!!! No complaints please try yourself before believe reviews   shame negative reviewers!!!!!!! <EOR> I love Florida Cafe! come every couple weeks always remember me  staff great Cuban sandwich plantain chips delicious! <EOR> I coming since little still continue come food!! food delicious but services SUCKS  No listens act bothering them when asking simple things  wish could give better review because absolutely love food but should really think getting people least act care customers  <EOR> First all service very welcoming   Saturday afternoon Solo dining sat bar mojito Cuban sandwich   Which never ordered because waitress bartender hostess never even inquired if wanted menu   Mojito average much lime stirred shaken   No love put there!    Heineken next then left   Staff feels bored don't jobs very much   each other   robots really   bartender waitress hostess definitely busting ass way harder anyone else   would give another try maybe busy night when dinner service full swing try food check ambience  <EOR> I looked forward eating but unfortunately won't back bread which good changed actually made nauseous  soup recipe also changed bad  <EOR> Used groupon place put additional charges meal including required tip buffet where grab your own food  food stale no vegetarian options no salsa!!! worst meal las Vegas date  worth money!!! eat there!!! <EOR> The service extremely slow  waitress walked many times without asking if ready  probably waited 30 minutes time hunt down   ridiculous! Then worse food terrible  some dish said succulent pork leg  don't know if way should cooked but pork pieces where hard beef jerky far succulent  didn't care that  Also portion extremely tiny  didn't care dark rice plantation appetizer no seasoning whatsoever it  When waitress did interact she very friendly  little late though  <EOR> Service friendly Cuban food authentic but prepared full potential  sure some very cool parties going on  But lunch just very average  <EOR> The service isn't greatest but food more it!  My husband loves house made pork rinds but favorite always Ropa Vieja until figure similar home  meat tender flavorful rice good too   He also tried loved Cubano sandwich daughter big fan Fricase de Pollo con Pappas    And don't know exactly mojitos but always hated mojitos until tried theirs  very tasty refreshing hot summer day!  The service slow side but if don't anywhere why rush it? <EOR> The sandwiches excellent everything else much  Meats dry tasteless outside two slices bread tender satisfying between them  Cubano well constructed well seasoned though accompanying fries just OK  Nevertheless sandwiches solid cheap Vegas standards option doesn't require off Las Vegas Blvd  Don't married though  <EOR> Excellent breakfast El Cubano cafe Cuban style best! back when return Vegas! Aloha <EOR> Came first time definitely back more Cuban food everything ordered delicious remind grandma's home cooking appetizers ordered main dish    Vine aquí por primera vez y sin duda voy volveré para más comida cubana  Todo lo que pedí fue delicioso recuerda much la cocina de mi abuela  <EOR> I'm going keep short sweet  service awful  waited seated staff walked passed when finally someone called ahead seat ourselves  OK fine  Drinks took forever watered down  food bland say least  thought whole experience joke  some point beggar dude started walking through restaurant asking money  said thought never ending joke every time we're looking new restaurant before hitting Smith's Center show laugh awful experience Howard Johnson's Florida Cafe  really looks place local hookers dealers serious people enjoy nice dinner  <EOR> I purchased Groupon deal buffet buy free   fine print says buffet Friday Sunday   However when server said buffet changed just Saturday Sunday   flexible enough still let use Groupon which very pleased with   husband both ordered Pollo Frito marinated chicken then fried   comes beans rice   chicken very good juicy   also side sweet plantains which highlight whole meal  <EOR> The food good but wow service awful  took 3 separate requests drinks right even then never sugar tea ended grabbing off tray another table  Absolutely no ordered  Steak sandwiches instead chicken entree chicken salads instead avocado side salads fighting whether plain steak breaded actually point plain steak same someone's breaded steak 2 plates over before finally brought breaded steak telling mistakes salad house then calling liars when bill came  never ordered  good whatever but citrus marinated flank steak  <EOR> I came once recently large party 25 people    food generally very good but service much   presuming reason sheer size group coupled being under staffed night but experience still rather bad   arrived around 6pm well 9pm before finally check paid   Some group couldn't wait asked portion check split which did but caused unknown problem later when rest needed pay bills causing nearly hour delay all finished meals drinks   also longer normal wait food   I authentic Cuban food before visit pleasantly surprised   thought meal really good which bit saving grace helping rest dining experience   would return small group just family but would recommend coming large group  <EOR> The best Cuban restaurant attended outside New York Miami  Great fun great food  Nuf said  <EOR> The servers super nice fast  However    food surprisingly bland  No citrus spices steak pork yucca fried plantains sweet almost under ripe  Drinks delicious!

Forgot also bakery night club same owners  <EOR> Florida Cafe should addendum it   should Florida Cafe inside Howard Johnson's    Food pretty good but complaint just Florida Cafe but all restaurants general   If your menu lists sandwich typically diners assume all comes sandwich   Please list things come sandwich then include certain ones   ordered Chicken Sandwich which came lettuce mayo tomatoes   no mention grilled onions which sandwich drowning in   don't onions   Learned lesson guess   Overall restaurant nice   Service very mediocre   point watched waitress 5 minute conversation boyfriend waiting area   only people whole room know she wasn't busy   Food good   wife ordered salad 8 bucks   which some chopped lettuce sliced tomato avacado   sure she money's worth one   Also those visiting Vegas restaurant technically strip but don't expect walk there   Take bus   thank me! <EOR> This probably O G  Cuban restaurants Vegas  best Cuban food but hit spot if your craving Agua De Coco Tostones Arroz con Frijoles Negro   The service great if your Cuban regular just so so if you're anyone else   The waitress hips showing thought classless  She also refused eye contact when needed something  she wasn't server but clear need The location music décor exactly should be  Maybe little run down some new booths order but overall disappointment  I Cubans cook authentic food pretty close just made abundance  cook your food order course but use cheaper ingredients leaves wanting touch more something  sure but ALMOST hits spot   They around years would suggest changing menu but simply upgrading few things  Maybe specialty week secret menu   This solid average 3 star place  Nothing super amazing but nothing truly lacking   They also offer live salsa music twice week   I am sure tourist keep them business but regulars same people year year  Places always home Vegas opinion  <EOR> I absolutely Love Florida Cafe  service amazing great music food delicious  addicted Los Pastelitos De Guayaba y Queso also bakery contacted café  Very nice environment mingle  <EOR> Ok   here's deal  service SLOW pretty awful  morning  only two other tables ask lady twice serve us  Once DID service however food amazing worth wait  Authentic Cuban food! Sand which amazing garlic mojo chips even better! <EOR> This place awesome!  Granted location could better  located lobby Howard Johnson WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY down strip   However totally worth ESPECIALLY if know good Cuban food! staff consist mostly Cuban decent which builds authenticity food DELICIOUS  portions could bigger but worth every penny since food reminded mother's home cooking of course pork Cuban sandwiches way better but good substitution since mother isn't around always cook them   really recommend place especially if mojitos then yourself down Florida Cafe because they're serving them Happy Hour 2 6 <EOR> When Vegas Caribbean fix papas rellenas milanesa bistec encebollado tostones !!!! Yummmm <EOR> Very excited stumble upon Cuban place Vegas   I keep reading $10 buffet which must come back but write some items lunch   The place located Howard Johnson motel Downtown Vegas LV Blvd   looks pretty seedy but there's something it     For food ordered Ropa Vieja which shredded beef stewed tomatoes bell peppers onions   Very flavorful     My friend ordered Pierna de Purerco Asada oven roasted leg pork marinated mojo lemon galric lemon lime orange juice   Very good too   Some other friends ordered some items weren't pleased but could because just don't adventurous palette   The cuban pork sandwich pretty darn good   you'd Miami but hard find great Cuban food anywhere   The menu intense  def back buffet which seems best pound pound value  <EOR> I don't know why everybody giving place low stars  staff super friendly chefs took time talk when he done work   Anything chicken awesome here! meat falls right off bone melts your mouth  think ordered Pollo Asado Cuban Spices   also comes black rice black beans  told just Cumin Parsley but tasted whole lot better that    Me friend also Mojitos here  Both drink lot frequently surprised buzz creeped strongly  another half glass pretty hammered   Prices bit expensive portions give but money worth quality food drinks  really close workplace just right Las Vegas Blvd   A common complaint slow customer service  thought speed service alright especially since came slow day Christmas Eve where plenty folks rushing mall late shopping instead   Will always come down here? No can't afford weekly habit but really chill place date atmosphere  <EOR> Great food stiff drinks  bartender really friendly good conversation I did because closest hotel Vegas didn't want walk far  Glad found place  <EOR> This family's place Las Vegas  If want authentic cuban food place haven't food since Cuba itself  Favorite part every trip! <EOR> This place amazing  If visiting Vegas want exception meal Cuban experience must stop place  <EOR> The restaurant inside Howard Johnson but next Shalimar Las Vegas Hotel close SLS Hotel  address Yelp incorrect  Correct address is 1401 S  Las Vegas Blvd <EOR> First time party 9 adults 7 children  waitress very good  food came timely manner considering size party  Arroz con Pollo      never Cuban food don't know if dish supposed dry but  tasted like  really looking forward Fried Plantains because love them everywhere else but ones also dry no taste  did however enjoy Tres Leches dessert Guava Juice  Everyone else loved food which also posted pictures but please don't ask name them because can't remember  Next time Shrimp dish looked supposedly tasted amazing  Overall gave 4 stars because service quality price quantity food given  back?

After dinner charged bunch stuff brought nobody party ordered analyze bill explain them ordered actually because keep mind some stuff actually ordered never made table      Save yourself headache Havana Grill  embargo lifted actually just Cuba instead  <EOR> I'm glad found little gem! establishment least once month now  papas rellenas ropa vieja very good  took star away because forgot put sauce husbands steak well because wasn't 5 star experience but maybe next time be  still amazing time all friends family  <EOR> The food great great selection pastries desserts but they're service kinda sucks maybe because weren't many workers came around brunch   took while drinks someone take order but once said something service server much more attentive    Overall come food service! <EOR> Absolutely best Cuban food city  others around town but don't even come close place  Hands down best  <EOR> Super tasty authentic Cuban food  set Thai food dinner but uber app took wrong place uber driver Cuba recommend place  tasty  mojito plantains sure  some shredded beef dish marinated wine onions bell peppers yum  Even though wasn't intentions am sure glad ended here  <EOR> I found place dad  He would always come trips Vegas now husband come every time come Vegas  pretty hidden Downtown Vegas  inside Howard Johnson hotel    Service excellent us  chicken onions rice black beans maduros  delicious!!   I think remodeled looked nicer remember  restrooms very clean  Definitely check place if you're Vegas <EOR> The food very very good  Florida sandwich la locura flattened chicken breast served giant round roll topped grilled onions lettuce tomato cheese mayo even skipping cheese mayo winds being good two three meals    The arroz con pollo delicious wishing some right now chicken flavorful yellow rice pimentos peppers incredibly flavorful made all more fact there's bit crisp rice bottom paella   Appetizers worth seeking include tostones ropa vieja chorizo frito  sopa de frijoles negros cravings ridiculously good soup topped pungent slivers white onion  recommend liberally spiking hearty soup green habanero hot sauce tables   So then why am only giving Florida Cafe three stars? Because may most consistently poor service any restaurant frequent Las Vegas  Slow unaccommodating absentee service frustrating when food good  Even when only customer restaurant can't any attention  <EOR> Sunday early evening marinated steak great appetizer 2013 Robert Mondavi Private Selection Cabernet Sauvignon  amazing dinner great atmosphere  guava cheese pastry way which completed wonderful meal  <EOR> Me encanta el ambiente cubano la música todos atendieron súper bien y la comida ni se diga riquísimo como entrar en Cuba en medio de las Vegas!! <EOR> Am dying try place reading reviews  3rd gen Cuban also curious   has anyone checked live music here? authentic Cuban music if when does happen?

The original Cuban sandwich banana chips oil garlic sauce AMAZING!!!  could eat place once week never bored  <EOR> 3 stars because potatoes balls stuffed ground beef delicious   Otherwise        Florida Cafe turned huge letdown me   years wanted try place keep hearing people seeing ads bus stops     So night CES made last minute reservations go   weren't busy   I mean seriously HoJo Howard Johnson dinner? Apparently they're also big weddings saw wedding party huge limo milling around parking area  As said starter potato balls great   even more excited actual food   shared following FC's Famous black bean soup Served quite hot which strike #1   and basically just   beans   big ole bowl black beans cooked long time   weren't great flavorful anything  congealed cooled 10 minutes no longer realm appetizing   Cuban Sandwich Unlike soup dish served lava hot   Even 20 minutes served still burnt tongues cheese   Though disappointing soup sandwich still underwhelming   no real flavor stood out  pickled veggies put sandwich weren't nearly noticeable   Beans Rice Ok   really?

Wrong   myself big plate terribleness   smelled instant rice tasted it   rice comes served molded bowl which lift away present you  Uncle Ben's rice scattered soon bowl taken away   What's point molding it?
