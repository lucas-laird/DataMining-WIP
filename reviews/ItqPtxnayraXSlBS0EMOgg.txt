Easy walk golden nugget  <EOR> Went yesterday lunch  Pretty busy little place lunch time downtown business crowd   Anyhow food solid but overpriced  Nothing exceptional but nothing bad either  salmon burger yesterday  shoestring french fries good am pretty sure fresh probably favorite part   salmon burger itself which recommended waitress extremely dry  hesitant try stated piece salmon   surmised salmon flakes filler aka would expect frozen section any grocery store  going back dry salmon patty salmon burger cream cheese which again am big fan but think cream cheese copious amounts mayonnaise helped offset dryness salmon patty   menu stated salmon burger balsamic aioli however could taste all burger did appear any balsamic dressing burger   did bread butter chips top burger five held top toothpick    total salmon burger fries no drink including $2 tip $15  just don't see going back price charge    I overhead another waiter saying hangover burger great friend hangover burger liked but just can't justify paying $13 burger unless BURGR like   If am going hamburger high end then am In N Out girl because hey  hamburger's all about    but digress    I MTO once before six months ago remember getting salmon wrap  Again remember being okay but nothing really noteworthy  split friend definitely big enough splitting    As side note serve beer $5 some good choices Dogfish Head 60 although also PBR question would really pay $5 PBR although friend pointed he noted resurgence cheap beer being trendy haven't noticed but pay more attention micro brews wine myself   But MTO seems attempt appeal sense nostalgia referencing wonder bread Velveeta amongst other items maybe justification $5 PBR? Anyway long story short okay try but don't salmon burger unless mood patty moisture Sahara desert expect pay premium pretty much anything  <EOR> Great food modern comfortable setting gaming areas city hall  Wonderful friendly attentive staff that's Rachel   some Banksy artwork!

The staff kind helpful  Donna gave some great recommendations other places eat around but back breakfast rest trip! <EOR> Service excellent even party 6 full house   Food portions huge beyond delish  MTO juice good morning refresher  Im still craving chicken waffles BLAT! Absolutely cannot wait eat again! <EOR> Has favorite breakfast joint Vegas  Very trendy hip most importantly delicious food  few things menu all very good  <EOR> Good food tucked underneath parking garage   both specialty juices which sent taste buds flying!  Overall good spot quick breakfast! <EOR> So high hopes based upon reviews  really disappointed  place itself really nice decor atmosphere  first server saw came sat then two other servers came asked if helped  may seem good customer service but way acted if no server rotation  Watched same server take next two tables while other servers doing side work  leaving two purple came eat 1 pm same server said closed five minutes even though anything saw said 2 pm   Now regards food single mimosa shows menu $5 95 but actual price ticket $6  may seem lot but when sell thousands adds up  lemon poppyseed pancakes did any lemon flavor them ordered burger bland overcooked  fries no salt them ever  Would eat again  <EOR> I tried chicken waffles dish good! Next time area definitely come back  meet owner he very friendly he genuinly wanted hear feedback opinion service food  Great experience! <EOR> Went brunch food awesome  small place very cute  staff very friendly attentive  did bottomless mimosas glasses never empty  There's little bit everything menu  <EOR> The food excellent staff amazing! chef sent taster clam chowder special day best chowders ever tasted  also loved all artwork atmosphere restaurant  definitely return friends family  <EOR> Went Saturday breakfast  Parked parking garage which cost $2 50 hour so  Husband huevos rancheros fat elvis  Nothing short amazing  green juice coffee awesome  love decor  Very nice   I'll back  <EOR> My two children lunch trip  To Discovery Children's Museum   Vegas native fun watch downtown start come life again past couple years looking forward trying MTO out   We walked ambiance very fresh modern open inviting   Service great too    Everyone very attentive   nice plus kids each chocolate chip cookie dessert free   Another plus place best ranch dressing ever had   Hands down   family loves ranch dressing MTO made scratch delish!  Now why given MTO three stars instead five   menu pretty limited   Granted kitchen looked small could reason   food good but great   something would drive downtown seek out   kids chicken finger kids meals   chicken sandwich   think called Bob   sandwich just okay   chicken kind dry   big smear chocolate sandwich   obvious someone cut sandwich half knife used also cut dessert   love chocolate but turned stomach bit   I also think MTO tad bit overpriced get   sandwich water two kids meals $40 tip   just don't think food quite justified cost   validate parking garage parking well which nice pretty much your only option parking but when left discovered only pay hour parking   garage digging change credit card pay balance wasn't expecting cars waiting behind me   Was MTO great?  No   bad?  No   don't think I'd seek again but wouldn't opposed eating if group people wanted try out  <EOR> MTO looks modern unassuming outside but when walk through door hip décor immediately draws want regular  Everything made order way should be  large selection breakfast lunch items juice espresso machine fancy coffee drinks  first visit work breakfast immediately returned following weekend husband tow    The lemon poppy seed pancakes killer only wished more blueberry compote  also love mashbrowns!

Then she said thought asked salsa which would reasonable mistake if she actually brought salsa   So then disastrous breakfast manager discounted only 10%  Really? would expected more reasonable resolution manager even come table apologize wait  watched server talk manager seemed laughing joking do  over hour wait EGGS watching other people come terrible service careless manager food worth wait  Very disappointed overall experience  <EOR> Been hearing MTO bit  found Downtown 3rd Farmers' Market  point really prefer places where know getting good ingredients  recommended folks work market told buying lot ingredients sooooo     I finally etch sketch 2 year old son play ordered bacon excellent fries gravy very good hash browns awesome! onion soup tasted made today fantastic caesar salad strawberry fields salad chicken  Caesar good maybe great  Strawberry Fields salad amazing arugula strawberries balsamic dressing!
