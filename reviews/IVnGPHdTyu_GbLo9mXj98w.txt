But haven't tried any desserts here  place worth try authentic Japanese noodles <EOR> This stuff good guys  Super good ramen comfort food feel!  Ramen Tatsu located busiest strip malls Jones Spring Mountain alongside other notable restaurants businesses  Parking usually very busy lookout!  After getting situated you'll find Ramen Tatsu tucked away north end plaza  Once inside met quaint space proper kitschy Japanese decor    The menu easy follow  food great  usually Tonkatsu Ramen side chicken karaage  Also beware! spicy levels no joke    definitely faint heart  love anything everything spicy but special habanero peppers no joke  <EOR> Food Cost We usually stop Asian BBQ restaurant next door but since closed vacation decided come here  glad did! Ramen full flavors where know boiling pork bone long time! true Ramen bland lots salt MSG etc  Cost very descent compared many generic Ramen places  taste flavors place its more worth paying little bit more anyway amount time takes soup taste way  portion kimchi fried rice ordered bit small price paid  Flavor good but nothing rave about  bit sour flavor due Kimchi which meh  think twice before ordering again though  would just stick Ramen  Haven't tried other stuff though    Service The only lady see working works champ! place small but enough capacity where think really help 2 people  She took orders brought your food refill waters without even asking your check  Even all herself she still quick service  Wow! wasn't until toward end saw another lady walked help  hope she just taking little break because otherwise heck leave partner chaos herself?  Ambiance Cute little place generic Japanese theme  much decor but enough idea your Japanese restaurant  Place clean AC good enough bring mood eat hot soupy Ramen 105F outside! <EOR> If SPICY ramen place be! flavor spicy miso ramen intense chili made habanero which gives intense heat! Don't double extra spicy dangerous level might able finish it!   and love spicy! Also spicy miso ramen came ground pork which thought odd second visit asked replace chaisu instead!

Ambiance looks good smells good tastes good but needs bit color pizazzz bowl   just don't feel magic     green onions only vibrant add spicy tonkatsu ramen   broth itself good n porky habanero infusion adds kick tastebuds!  When comes any Japanese cuisine come expect visual sensations well palate sensations come together harmonious combination flavor flair   know    sounds food snob but truth told!  Imagine California roll no red crab no green avo just white rice n black seaweed still look appetizing?  Back ramen maybe add some red daikon? Shredded carrot? Cucumber leaf?  Fish cake swirly thing? habanero slice? no seeds! no chef but know looks tastes good!  Ima give em another shot but next     *iromaru come  Try every Ramen joint Vegas?   Challenge accepted!!!!

Spicy Miso Ramen  super spicy tolerance maybe 4 10 around 9  Spicy but flavor point  Only place ramen! <EOR> Having gone few times bit disappointed last two visits  really need hire least more waitress waiter  only waiting all tables greeting customers table  Because service super slow  wait quite some time seated they don't clean right away someone leaves some time them take your order some time your check  1 star   restaurant being busy popular especially plaza would helpful if could more person working    The last visit meat egg really disappointed me  meat chewy tender filled fat skin instead meat   soft boiled egg bit over cooked see yolk  spoon black marks dirty  1 Star    For something initially enjoyed would've given 5 stars quite disappointed last two visits  Nonetheless return hope see improvements  <EOR> Two visits two days  says something! Came tonkotsu ramen  Amazing! broth better any place LA  Rich full flavor   His chashu unbelievable  Braised seared must try  The gyoza mini size but pack wallop flavor  Karaage chicken come huge pieces very moist great crunch   His cold ramen dipping sauces fantastic especially sesame dipping sauce  presented exquisitely   Asahi draft huge plus! Expect gracious hospitality amazing service   This now must list each time visit Vegas! <EOR> I don't really much say place except mediocre    I ordered tonkotsu shoyu average  boyfriend ordered katsu curry tasted below average  He ordered knowing wasn't going taste authentic because he's big fan ramen he didn't much choose from    Don't started takoyaki lol   The reason low stars because service  didn't approached till 10 15 minutes sat down    On plus side think cool more options like curry any other ramen place to    I probably won't visit again since much competition around them which yet try  <EOR> I wish open later!!!  Granted shouldn't eating late first place anger stupid acid reflux but industry person Las Vegas sometimes just want late night ramen stressful shift  Am right am right??        Now back business    LOVE place!!
