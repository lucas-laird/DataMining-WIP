service quick accurate however could bit more friendly  Overall very good!! used drive thru half chicken 3 piece chicken meal combos  use again if side town sure <EOR> Drive through service ok just other locations  does take them long time serve folks often forget important things straws sauces  skinless chicken breast steamed broccoli great post workout protein packed and low carb meal  less 500 calorie menu pretty good also avocado sauces  <EOR> So being nice person am decided give place another try   I ordered double avocado chicken salad  home find salad half slice avocado  called them person spoke didn't even apologize   She said well come back give extra side avocado hung up  chain needs train employees treat people better food they'll going business     This place order right   I've given them few chances but no just can't  Every time order few things least 2 items wrong   the staff doesn't even try apologize always excuse  said avocado  why didn't put any avocado chicken salad together people  <EOR> Horrible pollo loco  given them multiple second chances never order right  shouldn't 2 trips correct meal   they no problem charging extra shrimp but end using chicken  top give attitude wrong bringing issue  <EOR> This restaurant obnoxious   The employees all friendly never problem customer service   I few complaints   This restaurant NOISY     The big hispanic dude chopping chicken annoying   BANG BANG BANG!!! cleaver cutting chicken echos through whole restaurant loud   BANG BANG BANG!!! then he turns around flips few chicken carcasses over fire then turns back chopping block BANG BANG BANG!!!  know need cut chicken but damn    why does damn loud???  This store plays background music   music isn't bad   could worse it could some obnoxious mariachi crap   But always seam music turned really loud     And maybe design restaurant    maybe store some weird acoustics    but everything building echos   few nights ago could hear conversations everyone sitting around loud clear if sitting next you   This place gives headache   Did mention food?  The food good flavor but portion sizes joke   remember years ago when El Pollo Loco gave your money's worth   anymore   every other chain restaurant greedy give tiny portions   always leave place hungry  <EOR> Whenever stop leave happy!!! always nice all other choices close long way making decision easy! <EOR> Went 20 minutes before closing locked doors refused service  Waste time! <EOR> Went through drive through person couldn't hear window order upon arriving home order completely wrong point son burrito avocado he allergic he throw avoid going hospital  called talk manager which he said he name jerry he hold 30 minutes never came back phone  service returning location <EOR> And yet another extremely disappointing experience  Honestly if another decent grilled chicken spot around THERE!  I attribute visits son if he didn't request come chicken wouldn't! pretty sure when he grows realizes horrible service people he cease frequent spot well    We walk Sarah register couting money we realized later she starting shift she may verifying starting cash til   walk register making complete eye contact turns head looks other employees busily trying orders together  stand right front registers again Sarah standing directly front SILENCE  No hello no someone right nothing! 4 minutes later someone comes drive thru area takes order    When picking order asked cup since ordered drink again Sarah says nothing just stares  show receipt say see drink cup   She gets cup hands me    all again NO WORD spoken  No thank no good day NOTHING!  Seriously know its fast food place service definitely priority but if hate your job much new one!
