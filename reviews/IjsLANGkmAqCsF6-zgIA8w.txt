I recently married Las Vegas booked Best Best reception  read great reviews sure would great  Steve owner great talk very helpful responded quickly any questions had  Steve also did reception  He did great all song choices music genres wanted including extra requests had  He also paid attention everything wanted the bride made sure against wishes  only thing wasn't pleased DJ steves attitude towards guests  He quick deny guests song requests rude demeanor  signed contract 7 00 11 00   when actually venue space til 11 30 mistake     Everyone having great time asked if he could continue playing until 11 30  He quickly responded no then rudely stated need $100 right now  upset requesting additional money just didn't tone attitude guests he responded when requested additional time  He very personable friendly anyone  attitude needs more welcoming friendly during wedding where everyone looking good time great spirits  Other then rudeness music he played good  <EOR> Choosing DJs reception best decision made!! wonderful!! Super easy work music fantastic!! several children reception even played little children's music them dance  such cool kids loved it! made reception perfect!! would definitely book them again if needed DJ event!! <EOR> im complain but DJ Steve SUCKED     regular dj he knew keep music going but family wedding likes newer club turn music he did well  he nagged 3 weeks compose list songs once sent day wedding only two  that's right 2 songs whole list least 200 songs played whole reception  many family guest started leave 2 hours before reception over because nobody feeling music  he completely ruined wedding reception    THANKS RUINING SPECIAL DAY       if newer party music then PLEASE waste your money  <EOR> The company name true experience  DJ literally best best  He treated most respect super easy work did such great time getting dance floor moving! He knew read audience play song perfect timing My favorite part might ask     he let sing karaoke because bride hahah <EOR> Yikes! Unfortunately DJ only AWFUL thing wedding  displeased DJ Steve yes owner couldn't believe it  even 5 star reviews Knot positive video testimonials   We small intimate wedding but Steve DJ ed he club  lot shouting lot aggressive remarks just made all uncomfortable expecting  DJ should feel your crowd see type audience is    didn't happen  When asked if meet Steve before wedding assistant said he's pro hasn't met couple over 10 years didn't meet him  Wish could because would've clear personalities didn't mesh  filled four repetitive papers regarding music taste wedding reception timeline  also spoke Steve week two before wedding review everything  All disregarded night reception  arrived reception venue Steve pulled aside ask timeline would would doing bouquet toss etc  He jotting down handwritten notes papers but questions all answered previously  Steve would say remarks made guests feel bad guilty dancing which should've clear he wasn't playing good music  MEMORIES bride groom if dance also if don't dance  AGAIN REPEAT MAKING MEMORIES if dance     still see some people sitting down over there    COME DANCE! take hint people enjoying conversation families play better music people dance! Don't shout them them feel guilty! music shut off least 4 5 times response look face he didn't know fix it  song played tambourine it    Steve played part song longer brought two own tambourines shook them front stage felt 2 minutes  circus? He played music specifically asked play  When didn't smear cake over each other cake cutting Steve shouted into mic asked guests wants them again!??!?! Aggressive! He realized event he didn't some music requested i e  last dance song he picked own song followed Warner Bros  All Folks clip    TACKY! something he should've seen beforehand told pick another song  end reception he hounded groom fill survey he win award  He also emailed twice honeymoon saying Sorry bug while you're your honeymoon but we're award    Spend your money elsewhere book DJ  sure DJ Steve reply note say only fun your guests allow be    but take accountability your poor reviews change  People uncomfortable your antics  <EOR> Do really want party?
