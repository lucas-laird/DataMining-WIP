She made reservations avoid any imposing crowds  town square location nice hustle 'n bustle Strip vibe   We watched other couples drinking 36oz goblets sugary liquor Dana giving eyes would able finish this? Instead suggested order individual cocktails looked more tasty   She ordered grape crush root beer float  Mine tasted stronger which enjoyed and finished! They offered Vday prix fixe menu but opted regular menu since am picky vegetarian       I nommed rigatoni marinara which very good italian princess fettuccine alfredo chicken  appreciate menu V represents dish made vegan    Now dessert reason baby took here  Even though both fairly stuffed meal consulted opinion briefly promptly ordered signature fondue choice milk white dark chocolate  opted milk   It yummy indeed! Portion sizes pretty average pricing range medium expensive     Sugar Factory definitely provides sugar rush combined romantic vibe  next goal try weekend brunch signature lollipop  <EOR> The first time sisters birthday  inside restaurant looks really cool loved decorations  seated table directly front doors into kitchen  Waiters hosts came often huge distraction  happened frequently almost seemed way many people working pretty slow afternoon    We both ordered drinks which pretty good but food wasn't special  good but expecting something little more unique restaurant    As leaving least four hosts manager standing front door didn't even notice trying leave  said excuse hosts move own problem  Sorry just trying exit?    The second time came just drinks hoping service would better saturday night bar area   Sadly disappointed again  drinks great but bar tender awfully rude    I wouldn't recommend place anyone other drinks  But even drinks weren't good enough put bad service  <EOR> Wanted try place since heard opening  Brought girlfriend it  Ordered pizza  salad  some fries  food pretty good prices weren't ridiculous  server Matt extremely attentive entertaining!! He definitely made night!

Remembered great service good food!  My visit time because Groupon deal $30 $62 worth dinner drinks   We made reservations but running little late  When came hostess told she pretty much just threw worst possible seat outside  mistake assuming should've asked if wanted indoors outdoors if wanted wait indoor seats    Took 10 mins see waiter Justin  He took water order waiting friend told half off special night drinks  Took another 10 15 mins ACTUALLY water    Because waiting friend still decided order couple things $29 White Gummi Goblet $18 3 Piece Chicken Fingers Onion Rings friend's $8 4 Piece Cracker Sized Bruschetta   Our goblet arrives   they're suppose bring cup filled ice poor drink front you  Justin pours drink    Then DEMANDS friend sip because going over flow   DEMANDED told hurry sip because going spill all over table     W T F?!  Our food comes shortly uncomfortable incident good all but just worth paid for    We ordered another goblet Berry Bliss they're worth definitely good drinks  Although sweet fruity pack alcohol punch comes creepin' while drinking it!  Somewhere along time period Justin made really awkward funny jokes   made feel uncomfortable he did no flirty nor professional manner!  As closing time approaches Justin asked phone Groupon voucher he took discount applied bill  He came back dropped check literally ran off     Sooooo phone?!?!? Seriously took few minutes see him   When he finally noticed eyeing down asked phone?!   He ran towards manager dropped off phone AGAIN awkwardly unprofessionally joked manager looking through pictures   True shouldn't ask phone! Nor did he stupid joke!  I've seriously night wonder why he works there   To end night saw bill gratuity included    THREE people ?!? Because Groupon deal??? honestly didn't understand but would've really liked funny waiter Justin explained things    For record don't think I'd coming back     If       Nvm yeah def thanks Justin! <EOR> Scott bartender server great  Free shots amazing drinks food  If you're visiting local definite must visit! would recommend everyone know! <EOR> Before lived Vegas area dined other location strip   loved keeping fingers crossed new location   superstitious finger crossing worked!

I never visit location again because am mad ruined birthday serving lazy garden burger then executing poorly top that  know vegetarians aren't major focus business model but if going bother putting anything your menu vegetarians should half hearted effort elevate standard slop any bar Denny's 1 3 price  Then calling Ultimate veggie burger? Please  insulting serve restaurant claim gourmet     Let clear understand restaurants change recipes menus  totally it  But isn't menu change bait switch  promised ultimate burger but given crap readily available supermarket less $2  didn't cook heated up  Infuriating   The server very nice but inexperienced  No found suspicious didn't eat ultimate veggie burger  basically led believe location cheap reproduction real thing am both starving unimpressed    Afterthought phones actually did work while don't know if block service jammer if Town Square just crowded    however don't think your phone working enhances meal experience  Maybe should call ultimate internet? Boo place ultimate fail  <EOR> It fun experience but doubt I'd return  server great but really felt food totally overpriced  party eight but don't think any entrees ordered worth price  nephew ordered grilled four cheese sandwich tomato soup he didn't even finish it   this teenage boy finishes everything   salmon tasty but small  place gimicky really prefer restaurant focuses food gimmicks  <EOR> The Brie amazing dinner delicious!  staff extremely nice attentive!
