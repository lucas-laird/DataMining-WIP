Omg u disappointed if u beer u pizza   personally guarantee u that   Perfect location if u already downtown!! perfect beginning fabulously greasy tipsy ending night  or   U choose  <EOR> Very disappointed quality service!! Walking spotted Pizza Rock decided give shot  debated getting table just buying slice try it  finally decided just slices  saw people buying cheese slices pizza looked great  note young guy cooking pizzas awesome no name tag unfortunately     he very friendly charismatic type employee any restaurant would want dealing customers    if he only employee encountered service would great  Sadly he wasn't only dealt with   end felt bad him    apparently isn't fault he's forced overcook pizzas way   So ordered 2 slices pepperoni pizza  first two he brought just looked disgusting    weren't just burnt BLACK! said no    he offered 2 new slices   But then saw he put oven warm up    looked exactly same same exact large pizza first two slices   He handed them thought maybe tastes better looks  But first lifted up    bottom literally looked asphalt totally black bottom outer crust    burnt crisp    even pepperoni tiny curled burnt   each took bite off tip all could taste burnt char literally crunched mouth cracker    even good crispy pizza 'crunches' hard crunchy only tasted char!  No other flavor!  said No can't eat that   Why all pepperoni ones burnt? Why take sooner look cheese pizzas? guy said leave longer cook pepperoni  Really?  Why does NO other pizza place BURN cook pepperoni? just no sense sorry!  finally asked manager refund because he took another new pepperoni pizza oven looked exactly same blackened charred  The manager Joel we told later he never bothered introduce himself finally came waiting quite some time guess only 1 duty time     extremely sarcastic unfriendly entire time  He stated ONLY complaints he'd all day long  Okay  fine explained but eating burnt pizza offered twice!  Also wish thought tell right then    numerous other people line same time didn't seem care asked big group them Don't care burnt? reply We're drunk hungry could care less right now  Ahh near all bars especially big event town lots people drunk don't care eat     why nobody complaining!!  also starving point    we'd already waiting over 30 minutes 2 slices    but weren't hungry enough eat black charred flavorless pizza  After arguing burnt ness pizza Joel finally voided transaction refund purchase    then stated cooking 2 more slices different oven inside main kitchen    never asked point didn't want it    but he 'informed' walked away    didn't give chance tell 'no thanks'    we'd standing 40 minutes now waiting another 10 15 minutes another burnt pizza    worse  told NICE young man cooking please let know aren't interested we'd rather leave eat elsewhere   So if burnt charred overcooked pepperoni pizza place you   if plain cheese pizza LOOKED pretty good!  Just sure why can't cook them same    if pepperoni slices looked ANYTHING cheese slices nice golden brown crust bottom    we'd probably customers life!  Sadly cook pepperoni pizza death managers snide sarcastic downright unfriendly disappointed customers   no desire return never recommend place anyone   Shame because we're always looking good pizza places  We ended finding pizza elsewhere    guess cooked properly but burnt    imagine that! <EOR> First say pizza delicious! loud inside because play music you hardly hear each other but didn't mind  Just tip play music videos songs try play clean version songs  Keep mind if kids  Also took hour find parking  found parking lot which park if want pay $20 bucks hour  When first Pizza Rocks said wait 45 minutes but within 10 minutes  Still don't know why but helpful! Also only indoor seating  Overall though good visit! Try Pizza Rocks sometime when your Vegas! <EOR> I'm giving 2 star rating because service alone  group 12 4 kids  staff nice but ordered 4 pizzas could try different types then 4 kid pizzas  pizza took 40 mins first come out  Then came only time  over hour before all 4 pizzas delivered  then kids pizzas still didn't come  took 4 requests them then came Mac Cheese instead Cheese pizza took another 10 mins  Asking refill took forever  actually finally just bar kids refills  did end taking kids meals off bill but still charged mandatory 18% gratuity  Which wasn't deserved   Now other side pizza good when finally it  bit pricey think  $70 pizza salad Coke two Bloody Marys  asked if could buy slice said only if ordered walk window outside huh??? whatever   place nice inside  would never again group even kids point  if wasn't service which others mentioned too  would given 4 stars  <EOR> Delicious personal pizza side salad super great   ambience typical bar ish enough seating around TVs watch game  <EOR> My friend really wanted because she heard really good   margherita pizza because supposed best award winning pizza   terrible   better frozen pizza   service great though good atmosphere  <EOR> This some best pizza ever had  different types crust all ingredients top quality  also nice chilli oil table  wish restaurants closer home!!! amazing! <EOR> Best pizza dining experience Las Vegas!!!

I love pizza both traditional unusual reviewed many pizza places Dallas but never such interesting pizza here   Pizza Campari unique but good especially if Campari! Pancetta goat cheese sweet peppers escarole campari blood orange reduction what? crust also deliciously chewy lightly charred   Really did expect such good pizza  most importantly gluten free crust which husband  very much enjoyed   kind fore thought bring paper plates since certainly didn't think delivered right time  <EOR> The pizza rocks p Really exquisite dough done perfection toppings really top off  Picante man oh man! cheese meats deliciousness! Would definitely spot fancy pizza   Because high occupancy servers might find difficult keep but sure keep great service! <EOR> Bumped 4 5 stars  place serves great pizza nice beer selection energetic atmosphere servers take ownership helpful making selections   So two visits several friends updated thoughts   Classic Meatballs moist tender flavorful  nice start meal if unsure many pizzas order e g  should order 2 3 pizzas group   Using example would order large order meatballs 2 pizzas   Beer Battered Artichokes depends if artichokes duh   Batter light artichoke hearts tender  am fan   Pizza order order   favorite Cal Italia  Now if looking traditional pizza order this   However if open mind looking something bit different good choice  If traditionalist New Yorker  crust difficulty holding ingredients might use fork cut eat I know know Dante some lower level Hell those eat pizza anything other hands   But well worth breaking generations pizza eating tradition enjoy each bite  particular fennel sausage just right flavor pizza interesting   So if visiting Vegas take hour off Strip enjoy local favorite   If local should consider making Pizza Rock regular part your restaurant rotation   Enjoy! <EOR> Excellent!!! husband town Austin Texas NAHA searched gluten free pizza downtown fix impressed!

Unfortunately too    tired   to remember exactly deals times were   Oops   I know happy hour starts late night 10? maybe? sign front says happy hour only during week but menus say happy hour every day let order happy hour stuff no problem   think quart sized PBR $3 something ridiculous   The pizza good but nothing special   Probably better lot could area though   Great service   Several craft beers tap   Bloody Mary looked legit  <EOR> The award winning Margherita pizza full taste ate all  salad very fresh just good  Good service clean restaurant good music loud  <EOR> Great pizza awesome service  Harmony took care tonight think whole group impressed   She very helpful energy cool  Sicilian best tasted  Bonus points having great beer selection   Hope guys continue grow eventually SoCal L A  area  <EOR> Excellent lasagna huge portion  Great service  Would definitely recommend Pizza Rock downtown good old school Italian dinner  huge pizza menu well  <EOR> LOUD!!!  Pretty good pizza pie but prices just don't match   $17 margherita pizza   ouch   Also really really REALLY LOUD if paying little much your food yelling your dinner companions place you!  Recommendation happy hour throughout week lower prices knows maybe lower volume obnoxiously loud sound system   food good service very good music volume ridiculous   Fix volume first maybe price food seem its overpriced due overall better dining experience   Oh kids menu good but don't expect hear your minion over music  blasting   Did mention loud?!? <EOR> Top notch pizza whatever variety choose get! pizza very much artisanal variety people picky palates I'd recommend New Yorker pizza before moving more eclectic fare   Be sure try meatballs appetizer they're perfect! also carry jalapeno beer may sound odd unappealing first but beer connoisseur please yourself favor try it  <EOR> I'm huge fan Tony Gemingani only matter time being frequent visitor Vegas would visit Pizza Rock over Downtown Vegas    The menu virtually same Tony's Pizza Napolitana SF   includes famous award winning Margherita which cooked under 2 minutes along vast assortment pizzas NY Style Romana California Style Gluten Free   also includes famous meatballs pasta dishes well   Don't forget check burgers too   Same menu different setting case very different setting where instead traditional Italian restaurant look Tony's SF more heavy metal rock theme inside which quite fitting Vegas actually   being said pizza really top notch   although Tony's SF few times still lot things menu still haven't tried   friends decided Cal Italia Honey Pie   Cal Italia  http bit ly 1bGfTSF Gold Medal Winner Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge Asiago Mozzarella Imported Gorgonzola Sweet Fig Preserve Prosciutto di Parma Parmigiano Reggiano Balsamic Reduction  Although Tony's three times actually first time trying prize winning Cal Italia   very interesting pie both looks flavor   Very sweet savory figs balsamic prosciutto   really dug pie would definitely order again next time come back Tony's SF   Honey Pie  http bit ly 1kBVpvu Quail Hollow Farm Honey Calabrese Peppers Green Onions Mozzarella Piave Cheese Fried Caramelized Onions Serrano Peppers I've pie before Tony's SF ordered again share friends Vegas try first time   very unusual pie very sweet savory flavor little spicy kick it   If you've ever deep fried wonton Chinese restaurant dip sweet sour sauce  probably most similar taste compare pizza to   Although caramelized fried onions little burned still tasted delicious   But some reason wasn't tasting honey   One honorable mention recommend Burrata Burger   didn't Pizza Rock but Tony's SF   think very underrated because almost always overshadowed pizzas everything else   1 2 lb burger burrata cheese crispy prosciutto comes generous pile parmesan garlic fries http bit ly 1ePXy9t   Definitely worth trying out!    I think best wait time Pizza Rock considerably shorter older bother SF where wait time table least close 2 hours   Though could change if good word mouth around   looks Pizza Rock off great start its extensive menu popularity growing see doing very well Downtown Vegas  <EOR> We returned today Pizza Rock's 5 star rating remains intact  Easily too   As mentioned first review brought kids along  loved it  loved truck  Loved allowed write paper table cloth  Loved pizza   I asked 8 eight year old if she fun she said Yup   Asked if she wants back  Yes  answer   Then asked 6 year old same questions  She nodded head yes when asked if she liked it  She chewing some pizza crust  Return? six year old wants birthday!  When arrived checked Yelp  then received discount which saved few extra bucks gas money  Nothing wrong that! bad Mayor Carolyn Goodman wasn't time   Kids would gone bonkers    My wife girl scout troop leader noticed Pizza Rock offers classes kids pizzas  Hmm smell girl scout badge?

Apparently she assumed would sitting high chairs strollers   explained called ahead specifically strollers   Instead apologizing mixup she rudely tries show iPad prove she's right reservation doesn't specify strollers   believe person taking reservation screwed up   fine! But going right? now waiting 20 min past reservation   She tells sit tall bar top table   strollers?  doesn't work   see multiple long empty tables but we're told they're reserved other reservations   Finally she walks away   presumably she tired dealing us   find believe manager he finally finds table     Look it   probably wasn't best place bring 2 babies strollers  know now  But visiting town didn't realize vibe place   But fact called ahead specific reservations then treated rudely girl front desk long black curly hair unacceptable   wish gotten name but didn't   only reason didn't leave right then Saturday night probably wouldn't find another restaurant short wait time hungry!   Our waiter just ok service wise   only reason 2 stars instead 1 because enjoyed food   artichoke appetizer delicious pizzas I believe St Anthony Stout pizzas      Would come back? Hell no!!  pizzas good service HORRENDOUS   worth trouble opinion  <EOR> This new fave restaurant Vegas!! vibe place MUCH FUN! Especially Fri Sat nights DJ plays videos TV screens he plays music mash ups funny movie clips  great   Now food  order pizza obviously  ordered Sicilian style Peperoni pizza thicker crust perfect  Cooked just right plenty cheese serves 5 people! 4 party much left over think could prob feed more depending many slices each has  server wasn't bad  But she wasn't greatest either  times salad plates left table little long couldn't fit pizza other plates kind annoying   But other loved place! Great vibe great downtown area right next Fremont Street   Definitely recommend   Oh yeah also pick window front if don't want eat restaurant <EOR> Table maintenance cleanliness poor mediocre food  7 00pm Saturday full but really busy because staff congregating chatting back service station  only roll setting when seated then food delivered without servers noticing only person napkin silverware  Empty glasses cleared table  Trash floors  pail table held clean napkin roll dirty inside drips dried sticky sauce  Both men's women's restroom needed critical maintenance  There no DJ could see Saturday night advertised your website  <EOR> I start review letting everyone know idiot pizza place did order pizza    Since staying nearby business trip decided give Pizza Rock try seeing lots good reviews  Unfortunately single person pizzas large wasn't able take any back me  Instead ordered house salad meat cheese board  salad salad nothing special report  ordered lots charcuterie cheese boards before let tell portions prosciutto cheeses salami huge! mention two massive pieces bread  safe say barely put dent it    The bartender super nice let know personal pizza happy hour M F 3 6 10 12 I wish would known sooner   I'd love come back try pie because look amazing  Next time    <EOR> This place FANTASTIC happy hour prices LOVE happy hour would definetly come back every week  pizza fantastic fresh didn't take long either  fries little over done quite shocked would given old over done fries all having worked restaurants  But nothing can't simply solved! Still great place happy hour me  <EOR> I place 3 times   twice pub crawl once dinner using groupon deal     For pub crawls moment walk smell just absolutely amazing  Even if wasn't hungry made want chow some pizza  pub crawls great selection beers tap service bar fast friendly     love quality pizza happy actually try out  deal included beer pizza appetizer  app tried calamari  quite generous portion let split half half tried traditional calabrese style  calabrese style very spicy! Enjoyed app but container marinara dipping sauce far small enough around  far pie decided Romana II such cool concept pizza 3 1! sometimes challenge trying decide pizza  Especially because menu types pizzas also tad overwhelming when making choice  pizza thin crust style delicious  happy eat leftovers two days!   My reason giving 4 stars dropping down service waitresses  She seemed judgey beer choice when she dropped off beer  ordered bud light sweetheart still craft beer brewery never heard of  Then when some people walked took table while hostess away desk she copped major attitude  If your hostess happens someone walks grabs table cool it  No need throw your hostess under bus complain patrons  just leaves bad taste people's mouth completely unnecessary  say waitress actually served very helpful nice  <EOR> Some best pizza Vegas  many options different kinds pizzas    The only downside many options   takes good 10 minutes deciding pizza  <EOR> I eaten over past few years open always consistently good  food excellent  Usually restaurant always same thing but tried several pizzas yet bad one  also found service outstanding well  Happy Hour afternoons which provides great deals  Highly recommend! <EOR> So many choices but glad tried Michigan Ave Chicago thin crust   Great service great beer list   Totally worth going downtown Las Vegas Pizza Rock  <EOR> The Old Chicago favorite   Atmosphere fun festive   Pricey pie but Vegas  Would come again  <EOR> So two times last week  First time made reservations because tried going before wait time hour  Sat table once bar second time  2nd visit bartender very friendly but waiter table not  Music really good  food really good! Just need work over all experience  <EOR> Appetizers Coccoli sea salted fried bread puffs prosciutto burrata  die for! combination amazing! Must order appetizer!   Fried green beans perfectly fried seasoned   Meatballs hearty taste lovely marinara sauce   Pizza New Yorker their most popular award winning pizza  true crowd pleaser easy choice when many different palates please  soft puffs ricotta cheese add pizzazz    I dined location well ordered carry out  Fun downtown location full bar prepared noisy ambiance  Happy hour available  <EOR> The pizza good! hot fresh veggies plus  music kind loud but didn't stop folks talking yelling over music  waiter very accommodating since send back drink twice  He real trooper it  meatballs very juicy flavorful  place!! <EOR> I pretty shocked experience past weekend    mean place almost 5 stars 600 reviews! would think even off night they're pretty amazing  But alas very disappointing if back would only relatively quiet weekday night   We friends 30th birthday group 15 people  few other groups larger perhaps reason things chaotic  server stressed unfriendly but hey   I've there  know terrible stretched thin can't even breathe but some point disorganization pretty comical   Drinks food brought randomly people yelling people having raise hand  funny because long table LOUD happen sitting end where servers coming from  Seemingly none servers knew where anything going  All night drinks extra silverware pizza people would just come yell something    more likely quick response because nobody could hear them  bunch times wasn't even supposed table  service great   But all bad service redeemed good food  said know swamped server unless you're complete bitch then whatever  We're food  However The Ogden pizza just plain bad  seemed undercooked flavors just didn't come together all  Perhaps rushed but wasn't crispy all rather oily  Unfortunately birthday girl many others felt same pizzas   it just alright   The prices weren't worst but weren't cheap either  Because reviews higher normal prices guess expected much  Even restaurants high rating still manage blow away don't know happened last night  back weekend night? Never    I may try again lunch something but just didn't even glimpse fuss about  <EOR> Consistently pizza AMAZING pizza slice window  Augustine always cheerful happy see me! <EOR> This place good  Margarita Pizza Stromboli amazing  Caesar salad Italian Chop well  Service excellent fun atmosphere  Love music videos playing half TVs along sports others!!

You purchase slice to go which bonus!!!!! <EOR> Still great place locals even though seeing more tourists here  don't substitutions pizzas but work if ask nicely   Servers always friendly willing help suggestions ideas menu beers  Good selection local beers well  <EOR> The cal Italia excellent flavors cheese balsamic very well together if sweet salty your thing  Calamari which good but doesn't mean place isn't good  pizza alone good  never taste anything it  I promise  <EOR> Ordered margharita delivery using online ordering order cancelled 5 mins later due policy delivering napoletana style pizza   guy called sounded short passed off someone else re order didn't know rest order   Ended PICANTE which very meh quite literally ordered Dominos later day it   Maybe inside quality service better but don't offer online ordering food won't deliver only offer ensure high quality   refusing deliver expected quality wasn't there   The ceaser salad pretty good  <EOR> When San Francisco month ago gone Tony's pizza place find wait long   Pizza Rock LAS just fateful!  I Neopolitana style pizza lot   NY Detroit style   since PR known Neopolitana initially ordered that   However waiter said really big enough two ppl   opted Cal Italia   Great choice!  just right amount salty sweet   crust incredible   think use some sort special flour   Whatever chew perfect     All pizzas look good but things bit pricey   Though think today worth might  hard pressed pay almost $40 pie the cost sicilian    sell pizza slice though   basic slices $4 each which par NYC   But also offered specialty slices purple potato rosemary pesto   don't know if flavor combination works but tempted enough fork over $6 next time   there's def going next time! <EOR> The best pizza downtown Las Vegas   Head towards Jerky Store outside fremont see pizzeria straight ahead across street   I love pizza   New York style thin floppy crust     The best part pizza sauce   sauce scratch notice immediately   Hearty flavor!
