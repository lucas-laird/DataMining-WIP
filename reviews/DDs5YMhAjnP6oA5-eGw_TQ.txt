Second time ordered exact same thing time even mentioning last visit employee window ensured everything accurate bag before driving off  course everything should fine now directly communicating order mix upon last visit right? Hell nah cray cray that's slang crazy heard   home open bag instead double cheeseburger bacon plain double cheeseburger  no bacon no sauce nothing besides cheese  Haha what? time called spoke same employee apologetic put name down describe the book    Third time back last order repeated informing them name situation look the book questionable smirk   When home look inside bag straight french fries instead tots Now don't know exactly right mind Sonic order french fries when they're known tater tots but fries when explicitly said tots  put since could've simply peeked inside bag before driving off  However when home did call back gave them ear full because ya know hard it?  At any rate sure hell going location but proceed your own risk  least if you're using drive thru sure pull over receiving your items open bag examine your food if you're writing essay President because folks just can't seem follow basic instructions done right even when say they've gotten done right!   Other things notice particular location is Always dirty Trash laying around everywhere premises  parking stalls drive thru lane where bushes around gutters  mean everywhere  Nobody seems any pride overall look place outside kinda imagine what's going inside space no bigger car  Staff zombies employee's just given really unpleasant attitudes least every time been  would expect place where employees ride around roller skates would cheerful happy atmosphere? Nope here  Everyone seems down out  Drive thru intercom fail never hear employee speaking thru intercom never hear you  prepared scream your order your car if you're boot camp sounding off drill instructor  Lastly orders never accurate  Read beginning   I won't returning ever again  <EOR> We ordered 1 drink 2 ice creams waited 20 mins!!!! then asked employee going she looked deer headlights!! no clue! Then car pulls drop off employee another employee starts bringing them all kinds drinks!!! WTH u serious! sure we're getting free!! But paying customers couldn't NOTHING!! Terrible service! Well except when only kids working there!!! <EOR> I've drive thru more 10 minutes because employees didn't tell woman front pull over while long ass order prepared  If wanted sit forever would pulled into stall  disappointed today  <EOR>
