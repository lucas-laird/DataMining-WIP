When weren't only ones having overcooked cow problems   another couple complained pretty sure made them new order   way hungry send back taste wait another one   Baby would pissed tease food then wait come back   insides would bruised   Overall jury still if we'll back burgers but probably try custard sometime future  <EOR> You know am worst 'vegetarian' ever if am writing review hamburger joint but actually Create rather enticing salad selection  However did try them  Sigh  just can't work protein thing generally if friends want try new place where meat main attraction am happy give shot  just think friendly way be   Me Borg Hendee my artist pals piled into Camino the El El headed Create   think pretty nice environment  definitely feels part chain  very clean bright crisp plans more locations franchise opportunities however locally owned business  joint jumping mostly younguns i e  teenagers 20 somethings  wildly catchy pop soundtrack bumpin'  admit sang along more occasion   The menu little overwhelming because lot choices  knew wasn't eating beef though quickly settled turkey burger grilled onions mixed greens pickles spicy mustard side sweet potato fries  bill came little over $6 without drink which think darned good deal given side fries literally entire sweet potato goodness  best but am always very happy see them menu!
