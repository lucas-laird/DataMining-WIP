Sadly wasn't able eat much sandwich  fries really crispy nicely seasoned but no garlic flavor all!! Can't call them garlic fries if don't sure garlic flavor comes out  seasoning seemed more seasoned salt  bad but expecting  Really disappointing since paid around $12 combo    My guest also disappointed burger patty still raw!! middle bright pink  When he saw he quit eating burger  He did mention taste good but nothing spectacular something he'd come back for  idea Jazz fries great but he didn't sweet crack sauce  Being first visit didn't know crack sauce sweet kind sauce  if aren't fan sweet sauces fries burgers probably should ask taken off put side    The guy taking order helpful seemed really friendly but he along other employees just eating food right front everyone! always find unprofessional employees take breaks eat where customers see them    Not sure if back not  <EOR> May 26 2016 @ 3 56 PM   This restaurant owned Virginia high school classmate mine Colin class 1989   RAMS!  threatening visit food truck past ten years every time visited Vegas but never happened   Finally visit family made ate food but he wasn't there   Well maybe next time   The decor casual good selection board games puzzles play if mood   enjoyed posters paintings walls including some anime some local street artists   Chinatown section town under ten minutes strip     The cashier Chelsea very nice told #2 #3 most popular dishes   happy hour   ordered Fukuburger Buta burger Tamago burger Togarashi garlic fries Sprite Kirin Asahi draft    total cost food $34 40 beers being $2 50 $2 25 respectively   Chelsea called silly nickname Jasper when order ready   food ready ten minutes very fast service     We all agreed some best burgers ever had   fusion Asian sauces egg Tamago Burger made truly wonderful combination   bit messy but didn't care all since tasted good  patties juicy marinated nicely   fries cooked perfectly crispy outside soft inside garlic wasn't overpowering but nice hint   all agreed visiting again   If ever Vegas drive restaurant WON'T disappointed     See next time Colin   Great job wonderful fusion Asian American  <EOR> There seems bit hate train rolling through reviews section  While I'd agree criticism somewhat warranted still see more positives negatives   Fukuburger long favorite Las Vegas food trucks third shot brick and mortar success first positioned outside Strip  They've taken over former location Fresh Cup most recently White Rabbit  Customer traffic steady if somewhat slow around dinner time surprisingly nippy Monday night   The menu mostly same truck's menu although sure often carried all those fries options  also seem offer specials every often seen Instagram but tonight's Kennedy didn't sound exciting me  employee described Katsu Burger chicken mac cheese inside  try come back when they're serving something more intriguing   I Kinoko Mushroom Burger somewhat ill advised choice hindsight  hadn't Tamago Egg Burger recently but instead different burger I'd previously experienced  said don't remember mushrooms being tough chew  Mushrooms burgers need tender period thick but easy bite through   Let's back basics though  bun solid held onslaught sauces both inside out  beef patty gigantic oversized portion met challenge $8 price brick and mortar context food trucks generally overpriced believe not   cooked medium although did seem slightly underseasoned boring itself  But you're getting burgers because you're purist anyway pickled ginger teriyaki sauce wasabi mayo enjoyable burger overall   Also $4 jazz fries served same tray burger pretty dynamite  While isn't any sort cheese pretty sure they're better seasoned overall poutine tried certain shop long ago  fries crunchy brown gravy hot rich crack sauce some mildly addictive mayo based goodness   The dining area fairly small fans former inhabitants White Rabbit Fresh Cup may know  However above beyond offering free Wi Fi all well power strips high counters charging your devices    Even though I'd eaten long before Fukuburger visit definitely enjoyed meal  Despite own doubts they've transitioned truck's menu into casual burger experience its own niche among other similarly priced casual burger joints  Just remember funny nickname ready because they've kept aspect Fukuburger truck too  <EOR> Really spot if your anime fan TVs around watch naruto darling Franks etc  food Japanese take burger  katsu chicken burger light yummy  Topped lettuce nice dressing  fried chicken huge too  <EOR> Walked hoping shakes burger  Although don't serve shakes manager owner offered one  He left store buy ice cream milk proceeded daughter shake  Outstanding customer service  Ordered Jazz fries delicious Tamago burger very good Lucky burger daughter she too  Best customer service ask for  games play too  <EOR> The patty tasty fresh  Fries sauce die for  usually call orders pick them 'cause wait time your orser usually long  <EOR> Ordered Fukuburger first time visit great!  Everything expected   garlic fries sauce delicious  atmosphere fun service good   little pricey but  expected something quality  <EOR> Would good if meat cooked  boyfriend thought mushy cause all sauce stuff it  Until noticed pink inside  paid $20 fries basically  Well $24 including tip  Wouldn't recommend  cool place games stuff  But just cooked meal  sure meat cooked before eating  <EOR> Fuku burger great Asian burger fusion  sauces good burgers always cooked perfection    Kiki burger favorite onions some sauce delicious don't even know is <EOR> Great concept! We few times every visit pleasant burgers point  The place cool well maintained board games available pass time  Happy hour great cold draft beers great burger seasoned fries  Definitely must if side town  <EOR> Excellent burger fusion twist  Tried Kinoko mushroom burger  cooked perfectly nice juicy  Great fries too  <EOR> So most know drive uber sometimes  Anyway yesterday while driving picked dude  soon he jumped started talking food  always do!

Everything except seafood  He ok cool! need stop them handed biz card said your first burger super cool! am Fukuburger spot  Dude burgers amazing! Fries cooked just right! Colin fukunaga place new burger spot! Thank bro! <EOR> Fuku Burger would expect local burger joint  burger selection isn't vast but Burger excellent  fries also good cooked would hope good burger joint <EOR> Nice place  board games great kids entertained while waiting eating  katsu chicken which alright  liked panko breading but chicken wasn't im accustomed restaurant  huge portion though  Also Naga dog which super spicy  Good but spicy  buta burger which good but could used more sauce  Patty well done would preferred medium  jazz fries loved gravy crack sauce  keen bbq sauce well  Wife tamayo burger which really good liked egg   Came garlic fries which almost no seasoning them  Son lucky burger loved it  Fun atmosphere playing quality 90s early 2000s hip hop  Nice option eat family  <EOR> BUTA burger must try!

notice quite few things The bun isn't dry lifeless ball sprung dough simply made act vehicle slab beef hitches ride  bun actual flavor care put into it  airy light yet just enough crisp contribute towards overall mouth feel    The veggies actually cold  Texturally they've crunch snap only when product fresh  haven't sitting nor kept hot kitchen    This isn't just mayo mustard trope burger  Instead you've nicely balanced wasabi mayo call aioli if want along bit Fuku Sauce which smoky Asian BBQ teriyaki inspired taste pairs well mayo   This would probably enough inspire return visit  all more accomplishment somehow manage screwing classic cheeseburger properly  Yet there's another detail really difference between Sure come back  Wow place isn't others  somehow need excuse back sooner should allowed     BEEF  actually taste beef  Clara Peller stop searching found beef Fuku Burger where just listless humdrum prose protein  beef manages shine bright main character despite seriously solid fresh ensemble cast ingredients  thick patties aren't gimmicks meant satisfy your hunger well enough complain  they're star  Fuku means lucky which apt put mildly    I could stop here  now try yourself full confidence knowing won't regret it  however would mistake  staff certainly deserves mention they've tremendously warm friendly helpful every single visit made  illustrates itself true fashion when not if tip them when you're rewarded tasty take home treat show appreciation    Yes anything but roomy inside but still offer board games TV's anime going open 'till close surrounded hip cutesy Japanese style art adorning walls  Bringing large crowd intentions eating may difficult during peak hours no  no drive thru   remedied extended dining hours meal  certainly worth trip even if
