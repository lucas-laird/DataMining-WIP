TV monitor ceiling but there's light front creating glare plus room small doesn't help   crane your neck see around person front give yourself headache trying look up  no reserved seating early   Check in complete mess because staff confused which seats already taken just stood while  no sinks places wash up   Want know rinse your brushes? water cooler trash can  no places store your purse bag   can't put floor there's no room put next because cramped   small shelf looks intended bags but staff didn't mention plus only people sitting right next would able use securely  no outside food drinks   place more focused selling food drinks painting   really distracting waitstaff running around constantly   There's nowhere eat because cramped   Also eat finger food pizza sandwiches when your hands covered paint? bathrooms gross! put fan least clean them before class starts  no helpers   Most painting venues staff going around give more paint paper towels offer help etc   ask waitstaff employee paint since ran out   He rolled eyes grabbed plate no show  poorly paced   Seriously spent 90 minutes taking breaks eat paint background   When actual detail instructor rushed kept skipping ahead  worst all instructor   won't use name but call S   suppose some people think sarcastic Cake Boss esque humor funny but found rude obnoxious   She would just say stuff paint yellow line whereas most instructors would say mix 2 scoops yellow 1 scoop orange add 2 drops water paint line width pencil 6 inches long    you're encouraged creative but  why take classes learn   need guidance   Maybe if she'd reduced number eye rolling dirty jokes spent more time guiding actual painting experience painting wouldn't wound trash  class started late but she over top calling few people came late   She kept talking wanting home time   don't think anyone finished end   trying finish but both waitstaff started throwing away paint  Perhaps most insulting canned email sent afterwards inviting leave positive review Yelp address negative issues via email   Maybe  why reviews positive   I give them 2 stars simply because music level reasonable unlike some other venues think they're nightclub   Aside social media contest give away bottle wine weren't annoying photos social media other venues  <EOR> Today Design Dine Las Vegas location  sad say only new ownership vegan employee Avery checked made very snide remark vegans me  she checked name off roster she said before? aren't vegan now serve real food now  She laughed sarcastically  She also paint instructor session   I let know vegan she should choose audience more wisely if she doesn't know person lifestyle choices  She also played music pretty explicit lyrics during class kept referencing getting drunk vegas y activities   Very uncouth  I shocked unprofessional ignorant thing she would say  not even minute door! already paid online I'd probably just leave   So  needless say family won't supporting business anymore  <EOR> This first time designing dining blast!

Once seen upcoming class where sugar skull going painted signed class ASAP  Design Dine three locations valley attended Las Vegas location S  Durango shopping strip houses Zaba's Checkers  done maybe 4 painting classes total not all Design Dine pretty familiar types classes    PRO TIP early! class started 6 30PM walked 6 17PM  already really packed sit towards back  No worries though because Design Dine TV screen hung ceiling  focused instructor's canvas allow those back see what's going on     The instructor leads class step step recreate painting canvas  skull she gave everyone lot leeway creative expression  most part everyone walk away canvas  similar instructors  always feel behind classes but eventually catch up  There's 15 minute break offered class but seemed most people took time continue working canvases   Food beverages available order  menu mostly composed salads wraps sandwiches  those eating kind multi task room table where you're painting  servers take your orders beginning class bring food during break    GOOD KNOW stamp card  10th class free!  Worth Return Trip? I'm big fan group painting classes fact take piece art created home end night  Design Dine well organized instructor Jennifer great sense humor easy follow  Only suggestion I'd lower volume music stop skipping songs midway  only take much Top 40 guys   YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015 #192 <EOR> This fun place go  ordered some food which actually pretty good then sat down started painting  teacher precise didn't rush anyone  Overall pretty fun place go  <EOR> Loved fun atmosphere service provided food well drinks! Highley recomend it  <EOR> we great time  even first picture painted good  second time better nervous <EOR> Went first time past weekend  expecting fun experience quality food wine     all name design wine   1st wine horrible     When saw bottle buy walmart $2 97 bottle charge $6 00 glass   2nd food subpar frozen reheated stale chips   3rd did feel instructor helpful everyone  needed some guidance she walked past said oh no good  wanted pointer comment appease me   time experience don't think sister ever back  <EOR> Like others below disappointed didn't liquor license when which why gave 4 stars  However just license week imagine experience even better going forward   My boyfriend took Mom classes while she town  arrived right hour found difficult find 3 seats together but he sat next Mom across isle far  sure if we'd showed little early seating wouldn't problem fault  several people weren't time thought kind waited little bit started those people wouldn't totally behind   Our paining 'Welcome Las Vegas' sign  Apparently more difficult classes which hadn't known when booked but made feel super easy  instructors very nice lead class while another walked around helped  even compliment them well doing which nice because felt painting looked terrible compared instructor's   They patient step step simple instructions  painting lot measurements but made simple easy providing rulers even paper cups help circles  end all 3 pleasantly surprised good paintings turned out  made feel some real talent which don't but felt good finished products definitely going back again!  The only food ordered pizza which honestly good but others ordered sandwiches appetizers etc  actually looked amazing  only thing could made experience better would glass bottle wine but now look forward next visit!

All painters awesome but Melissa exceptional! <EOR> So much fun!! celebrate mom's birthday low price $19  Then hooked birthday crown cake!! painting instructions relatively easy follow  little fast but really everyone own painting pace  always moments where could ask help instructor she walked around see doing   The food tastes really good  portions okay  But gonna give 4 b c that   silly  Free refills sodas though!! 2 hehe  All all really fun time  sit commune random strangers around me! really nice atmosphere everyone stranger server teacher alike kind sweet  Needless say but shall continue anyway mom absolutely wonderful time thoroughly enjoyed birthday present  I enjoyed lots too!! keep paintings    Some Tips Food expensive trying save? Eat before come just snack drink soda beer free soda refills!! | trying save? Chow down! food amazing  Small proportions price doe   Bring seat cushion seats aren't all comfortable  Especially if don't lot meat your bones  You going paint your hands  supply aprons but wear expendable clothes    Be patient  You're gonna your painting right away  Remember you're artist or maybe are   case take deep breath just keep but don't freak out  It'll turn nicely  Still think sucks? Ask help another's opinion  littlest change biggest difference    The Durango location allows 13+ children teens young adults  Check Yelp!! great savings had  Change your water every now then once class  HAVE FUN Don't come judgey attitude  No likes sourpuss  Just sit back relax enjoy <EOR> My friend came girls night absolutely loved it! Monday April 14 painted palm tree scene  great night wine appetizers girls night socializing   loved paintings only issue wish pace little slower while instructor showed since never painted  Overall definitely come back! <EOR> This place very friendly atmosphere  instructor friendly always smiling telling jokes  painting turned better expected   I would suggest bottles wine group could purchase rather keep getting class glass  fun night painting novice painter  <EOR> What's better learning paint? Getting served wine food process!  I am such big fan whole concept  buy admission painting want learn while learning sip wine munch down appetizers entrees desserts    I received first ever Design Wine admission gift best friend  actual class started 6 30 but arrived 6 00 thinking going packed all good seats going taken  Fortunately pretty much empty able good seats reserve some well  checking give sheet which place your orders  appetizers not fond croissants along entrees sandwiches mainly desserts  eyes trailed alcohol section course girls moscato  super sweet! instructor even offered happy hour deal towards end class causing another glass moscato The painting lesson itself pretty easy  walk through everything even lend hand when needed  over different brushes if paint running your canvas if need change your paint water   You website choose painting want learn even reserve certain dates special events  first time going but definitely last   PS definitely look into date nights  your significant other or best friend work together paint big canvas  painting usually something long take 2 canvases  paints left canvas other right when put together becomes picture  <EOR> This really great experience! instructor very helpful funny  Overall wife result good time  would recommend check website before know painting  wife painted same picture but own twist  also group reservations paint all your friends  Definitely going again!
