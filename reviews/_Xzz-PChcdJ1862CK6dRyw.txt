Definitely if Las Vegas must try  Healthy menu all real ingredients no sugar added anything   look when eating out  place cutest decor  would totally decorate future home this  actually same pink velvet bench apartment  gluten free sourdough sweet potato toasts too  Anyways disappoint! <EOR> I high hopes place hardly reached expectations    This café modern minimalistic LA style clean lines subtle baby pink accessories pineapple wall accent    However taste food just average  ordered iced 12oz matcha latte signature Just Beet toast  All which cost $17 02 definitely bit higher end cafe    The toast itself costs $10 toast beet hummus avocado feta cheese some greens sprinkled top  good  Nothing stood out  didn't see sign if ingredients came fresh farmers market organic don't understand charging much it  sense if but if might well add side small salad small healthy cookie some fruit plate doesn't appear bare    I understand we're paying ambiance but $10 toast placed pink plate worth it  toast presented well 4 5 aesthetically pleasing scale but could home far less $$    What killed most place iced matcha latte $4 50   tasted cup almond milk ice  couldn't even taste matcha  sure if just today if consistently tastes this    The service wonderful though  They're very welcoming  workers opened door allow in  register also crashed while waiting line cashier apologized delay  Someone returned awhile ask if doing okay meal going    Café decorations wise place great foodie's instagram  Meal presented well but leaves unfulfilling feeling even more hungry unsatisfactory much toast costs  Overall good place try once but won't returning  <EOR> I've anticipating opening Toast Society toast popular right now couldn't wait right down street! second day opened luckily 10a wasn't anyone crowd came right after  soon walked AWE place absolutely gorgeous  color scheme chic beautiful yet minimal  greeted everyone helpful welcoming  opted flight comes three your choice  all sounded good! house favorite absolutely AMAZING  never tasted something more amazing! wanted come back seconds later day  also opted iced matcha unsweetened didn't need extra flavoring  flight came presentation mouth watering! already spread word friends  family! back least once week! <EOR> Met Yelp friend between various appointments paralyzed indecision ordered two toast flights 3 half toasts try all options  Add couple lattes tip breakfast $50 three slices bread some coffee which kind insane  did but still can't really understand why  actually quite nice morning   The service polite friendly toasts actually good  Lox Just Beet House Favorite top picks preferences skew more savory sweet  Turmeric latte mostly milk but props having alternative milk options available coconut almond   also smoothies yogurt bowls!  TLDR Modeled toast cafes California price tags style match  gorgeous spot don't wrong food actually pretty tasty but everything couple bucks higher probably should be  yet people come  <EOR> The space adorable very girly  food amazing bread dense yet chewy  prices pretty high def $$ place $ shown  Most toasts $11  toast flight which 3 half toasts whopping $16 50 but freaking good while home quality just isn't same  instance beet hummus    chunks slightly tart beet it  Never seen anywhere before  Generous amounts cheese too    The staff very nice service quick  Come see Natasha!! <EOR> Oh wow when walk enter into toast heaven sure  first heard place following RachelGoodEats she co owners place  unique creative idea cafe restaurant absolutely amazing just Vegas needed!
