I used love Roberto's aka Maria's because could walk decent consistent Mexican food good price  However last couple times food decent all  husband carne asada burrito pulled chunk fat probably inch inch inch  No exaggeration zero meat chunk  Sick  decided give Roberto Maria more try since many good times past  Once again meat gristly neither finished meals  Instead going across street 100% Natural takeout Mexican food now on  little more expensive but least actually eat it! <EOR> This used Roberto's   Now called Maria's   Pretty much same menu though might even same employees   I ordered california burrito cheese quesadilla   Burrito fine but missing guacamole   sure if forgot put but carne asada without guacamole just plain wrong   Quesadilla okay   would preferred more buttery tortilla more flakey though  <EOR> Not Roberto's anymore Maria's Taco Shop now?     probably because franchise pulled   Avoid  <EOR>
