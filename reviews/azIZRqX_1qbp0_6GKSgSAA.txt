The location Japonais simply awesome! If sit lounge area its outer edge Atrium middle Mirage hotel  your eating drinking excellent view garden 80s music playing background  Sounds odd but kinda feel your some beach resort instead middle desert   After having bad experience Shibuya in MGM previous trip though would change strategy visit Japonais  realized getting sushi middle desert where isn't much water around probably stupid idea  change things ordered mostly non sushi type items   * Crab Cakes Happy Hour happy hour pricing only single crab cake which isn't bad because looking try variety things evening  should know Crab C K  Yes real crab very tasty   * Calamari HH looking something panko crusted calamari but instead pan fried calamari two sauces sweet sour sauce wasabi vinaigrette  Different yet good   * Yellowtail Roll HH some sushi OK sushi but roll just compare quality Shibuya  expecting those horrible rolls drenched mayo might find non Japanese owned sushi joint  Instead very traditional roll  Yellowtail middle simple rice nori outside    something mom might made  top off fish good better Shibuya opinion   * The Rock pretty cool table presentation  Basically bring rock 500+ degrees sitting bed salt thinly sliced marinated new york strip steak another plate  take steak place super hot rock 3 4 seconds each side cooks meat right before your eyes  meat tender great  Only draw back need eat fast otherwise time last rock starts cold takes longer cook  Still awesome idea hit   * sweet shrimp diver scallop robata scallop OK but shrimp very large more prawn came table head all  Very tasty!  * pork skewer bad  average    My experience redeemed Japanese experience Vegas  admit still haven't signed off getting sushi middle desert because seems stupid idea begin with    Its hard fresh fish without being near ocean  Even though passed sushi food Japonais good great time good enough me  5 star food service ambiance  <EOR> You know restaurant just special meaning you?

For two main reasons   1   water down alcohol 2   pre make all sushi  I'd heard Japonais overrated but friends made reservation decided join   started some edamame the rock    Edamame good the rock pretty cool   loved being able cook some tasty meat steaming hot rock   But  where fun ended   I originally thought saki tini really smooth until finished realized wasn't slightest bit buzzed   told friend she agreed offered sip Bacardi Seven   Ummm yeah don't know but only essence alcohol it   point I'd already ordered manhattan my standard    When good color mixed right but when tasted weak   sucks   If paying $14 drink least put real alcohol it   I ordered 5 pieces nigiri 2 pieces uni 1 piece fluke 1 piece medium fatty tuna 1 piece snapper   Apparently used last piece snapper friend's sashimi choose something else  Oh btw 7 00pm   WTF???  You're already fish?  many options menu! ordered soy marinated salmon recommendation server   Overall fish relatively fresh but nothing special   meal 5 pieces nigiri some edamame 1 4 the rock paid $80   should having foodgasms that   wasn't   Throughout meal all huge plates sushi both rolls nigiri passing by   first thought might private party until friend reminded disclaimer menu saying might take longer sashimi fresh   Turns just adding reserves evening   Seriously never sushi place pre makes stuff   acceptable   wants eat raw fish sitting knows long?

Wow! conversation end Chef Thomas great lovely person! <EOR> Food service excellent!!! salmon GF duck  Both amazingly delicious  also Hot Rock need order this  Basically super heated rock use cook thin slices beef   The atmosphere modern elegant  sure walk t shirts shorts but why? Dress fantastic meal beautifully designed restaurant  <EOR> Japanese sushi high end prices   Prices listed per piece nigiri sashimi   double would pay Texas   The restaurant totally otoro chutoro fatty tuna but did state daily shipments just hit them night when didn't any fatty tuna shipments   Honestly if they'd said upfront probably would've gone someplace else since love otoro sushi   Ask them when you're seated if they're anything   Had regular tuna crab legs yellowfin unagi   quality excellent which when consider pricing lot sense   Drinks pretty nice selection Japanese beers whiskies but charge way much them   $22 Yamazaki 12 way much basic whisky cheaper Balvenie Macallan   really nice witbier Japan but $12 bottle making kind pricey anything more sample it    My basic summary place decent but expensive   If you're willing throw down money quality you'll great experience   If you're looking cheap sushi better options elsewhere  <EOR> My wife decided try place since staying Mirage looked some elements typically enjoy   reservation dining room but seemed morgue there   music barely audible no energy all opted lounge which actually appeared people alive eating walking around   The way drink menu awkward best   waitress wasn't much help she couldn't really explain could navigate white wines glass   eventually able figure own   wife ordered Floating Orchid Martini since mentioned here   She indicated average best   glass wine fine but again nothing special     Moving dinner decided try variety things could hit all bases   ordered Yellowtail Diced Jalapenos Ginger Garlic Soy Cold Appetizer which good but again nothing special   Snow Crab Avocado Roll basic   Lobster Spring Rolls change pace would give them 5 scale 1 10 but essentially deep fried lobster egg rolls   last thing ordered Crispy Shrimp Salmon Roll which thought best bunch would order again while wife gave solid Meh  waitress wasn't attentive all   She spent more time flirting lounge bartender never really stuck head see waving over   She finally came over moved evening   other table across same look faces which Hey leave now since bored drink glasses dried lack use  All in all very mediocre place competitive town  <EOR> I loved place simply can't think negative thing say it   First off menu states bring food continuously   Fabulous!  actually allows sit eat talk!  We two appetizer lobster egg roll raw tuna two entrees japanese short ribs duck    tuna amazing   literally just melted tongue   duck overly fatty but short ribs stole show   Our dinner ran 127 without tip absolutely worth money   Yum! <EOR> We dined while waiting late night performance LOVE show which great!   Easily cruised Val's day scored nice table bar area  bit noisy but bad would expected considering right off casino floor bump loungesque music  Boss enjoyed special drink night  flower it  sweet   all remember    As everyone stated prices high  unfortunate because food serve quite tasty  Boss split two sashimi plates  Both nice eel very fresh red snapper  But again pricey $12 2 piece sashimi plate  Ugh   We next sampled lobster spring rolls  came really nice mango garlic compote served great prelude meat  splurged 7 spice kobe rib eye  pretty amazing  Very tender seasoned quite well  Partnered sweet potato fries which also savory  steak approached $90  Yikes!  We finished everything ordered  Maybe  because portions small  But remember place definitely quality over quantity approach count something  <EOR> Wow!  Am really first review restaurant?  Did actually Helen Y  punch? Well give props making reservations place!  Awesome pick!  Let start saying few restaurants would actually rethink Star Ranking system   If could give more 5 stars would   but since can't might readjust all previous reviews based restaurant   Japonais all   great ambiance fantastic service amazing food!  start telling waitress Tomoko   girl perhaps best server ever had   She extremely knowledgeable menu Sake super friendly personable very thoughtful   say she really made evening without help eating experience wouldn't same     On food!  quote Stewie Griffin Family Guy  OMG there's orgy mouth! Tomoko started off 3 different types Sashimi each die for!  particular Kampachi Yellow Jack Akami Tuna extremely buttery melted mouth   asked leaner Akami swear stuff better and fattier some nicest Toro elsewhere   The next highlight The Rock  hot rock brought your table accompanied thinly sliced NY steak   take slice steak cook 3 seconds each side rock then eat  Aside novelty steak its ponzu ? marinade extremely tasty tender   only other place where experienced hot rock cooking method restaurant Japan called Serena   Also included meal tasty crab roll grilled Hamachi Yellow Tail sweet sake broth delicious strawberry dessert full details which can't recall moment   Tomoko's selection Sake also excellent   believe cold Junmai Ginjyo sake called Bichyuwajo  extremely smooth delicious   If you're ever Vegas love Sashimi Japanese food must goto Japonais   Don't think!

Overall would definitely come back bring larger party great intimate dinners large parties <EOR> Well food best sushi Vegas any means but friends did good meal some fantastic cocktails prior Love show Mirage  ordered drink gin ginger lime juice served amazing but name escapes can't seem find cocktail list website   Most rolls pretty basic but did yellowtail sashimi served thinly sliced jalapeños dish favorite mine  Getting platter seems way go  Even though little pricey end come ahead since individual items quite small portion sizes  also the rock which fun presentation cook thinly sliced meat hot rocks  husband also ordered skirt steak which he kept himself but seemed really enjoy  even carnivores find something liking here   Not best meal Vegas but definitely best place Mirage  <EOR> The food fresh nice try small portions great number things the happy hour pricing great    Drinks fun place packed     What really great however aside company beautiful decor great use subtle reds blacks curtained privacy booths nicely oriented  Service semi fast friendly    It's easy forget you're only steps away slot machines when you're oasis Mirage    <EOR> Had pretty high hopes Japonais but unfortunately didn't deliver  tickets see LOVE Cirque De Soleil arrived early  plenty seating restaurant lounge areas chose lounge  Lovely atmosphere   but lounge extremely cold yesterday   The server very nice hostess  kept food order fairly simple pieces rolls salmon roll avocado roll rainbow roll king crab roll couple pieces ikura salmon   Sushi decent until tried salmon roll  salmon roll 2 pieces salmon rainbow roll funky  in   something wrong  in     turn i'm    gross  never funky salmon before  2 pieces salmon nigiri fine clearly came different cut source   We pointed server she very apologetic assured everything very fresh delivered daily  She removed salmon roll bill said she going talk sushi chef immediately   Still   won't list another visit future  <EOR> We happy hour which includes $7 menu  Drinks food   kinda   meals tiny appetizers  end spending more food would if ordered entree   But if you're going appetizers then yes good option  drinks happy hour menu refreshing unique restaurant  Well worth $7 which bargain Vegas   The tables LOW LOW LOW don't recommend wearing dress did very awkward try sit without showing world your business    restraunt very neat super chic very posh  right next casino great opportunity people watch  Mirage very scenic hotel Japonais blends right theme place    We all great time definetly enjoyed tiny appetizers  Kobe beef slider just per order best thing menu  DELICIOUS!!!!  OH! calamari weirdest calamari ever experienced  recommend it  more calamari fish stick   it shape thick stick   not rings   so odd!!! <EOR> Japonais recently provided better if best sushi meals LV  Sushi Roku Forum Nobu Hard Rock also conversation   But Japonais intentionally expedited meal sushi bar before seeing show Mirage sushi chef service team great!  We fired away nigiri orders some customized while trying everything sight fish excellent   caliber gradations Toro delicious 'honest' which somewhat uncommon US   I'd happily chow alone future but everything truly high quality tasted fresh   basically ate exclusively nigiri exception lobster crab spring roll which good but missable   Desserts excellent well wife Japanese pumpkin cheesecake amazingly refreshing yuzu sorbet   Since didn't really even read menu can't comment non sushi items    But say given July evening sushi bar locked loaded sizable variety great fresh offerings wouldn't hesitate visit again if area  <EOR> Sunday night dinner close weekend   many drinks over years   first time tried food   Everything very good very fresh flavorful  special roll spicy tuna very good  <EOR> I really don't think place worth all money  Sure nice place some say fine dining food good but overall impressed  portions ridiculously small overpriced  felt dinner which included appetizers entree dessert still needed another meal  think case because Vegas people just automatically think okay pay much little  feel because Vegas expectations higher  If you're going charge much least your food really good decent sized portions  Three stars decor food presentation attentive staff  lose other two stars overpriced expectational food  <EOR>
