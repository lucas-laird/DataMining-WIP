I'd stopped into Planet Hollywood once before previous trip Vegas back 2001   sad say decor doesn't appear changed all since initial visit    which downright pathetic since restaurant butt ugly back 2001 looks even worse now   entire back wall restaurant looks like    like    80's   know  very vague description but there's no other accurate way say it   if Planet Hollywood designers took every tacky design principal 80's applied Hollywood mural famous faces classic movie moments   Trust you'll understand if ever see it   But hopefully won't   And off tangent but if you're creating mural pictures Hollywood megastars why hell picture Tom Arnold?!?  I bowl chicken noodle soup few chicken tenders apparently coated Captain Crunch   food okay but no way memorable   If you've ever wondered whether meal would taste better if sitting ten feet away rifle used Starship Troopers answer no  <EOR> Had dinner part dinner show combo   waste money   Forget combo find your own restaurant   Service slow  took 15 minutes drinks another 30 rubber chicken    at least beer glass take home  <EOR> Horrible service   Seriously worst years   Dated decore bathrooms bad   worth your time    WAY better restaurants spend your time in  <EOR> The first time Planet Hollywood Restaurant San Francisco CA  service slow food average but price wasn't bad  going San Francisco twice realized wasn't great restaurant  when moved Vegas couple years ago UNLV decided give Planet Hollywood second chance  Unfourtanetly same lackluster experience Vegas  Therefore discourage anyone tourist local wasting time going there  <EOR> In old location forum shops good atmosphere decent food  Now moved stairs atmosphere poor left decent food behind  tables now low floor which required sit cross legged order comfortable    The food down right bad  Texmex roll ups found tasteless consistency cat food  macaroni cheese more macaroni soup  All all if want decent food while Vegas going find here  <EOR> My goodness Yelpers  disappointed me!!
