Jose very talented Chef  We negative those wooden chairs darn uncomfortable! certainly don't feel lingering over meal   Sad admit but taken patronizing other local restaurants because find those hard wooden chairs unpleasant meal  <EOR> The food excellent  service subpar  Mother's Day 2 friends  reservations weren't able find but seated within 5 min nonetheless  person seated took drink orders but never drinks  20 min before server comes table take drink orders    After waiting seemed eternity finally able order  2 ordered burgers medium other medium rare  server initially going give right burgers but second guessing mixed burgers    When bill came charged incorrectly  server claimed only work nights but even though having brunch charged dinner prices    To restaurant's credit owner commercial came table amends offering chocolate martinis but spending 1 5 hours time go    Despite great food excellent bloody Marys can't say return  <EOR> I Elements less food although delicious more Martinis atmosphere  felt very welcomed home server very helpful  pastry chef owner even came over help dessert selections!  I also loved Martini Card which only allows remember which martinis you've already ordered but gives 12th free!   The food and especially desserts very special because chefs take time care try them little healthier customers using olive oil instead butter allowing natural sweetness season fruit sweeten dish rather processed sugar all without being pretentious showy it  If didn't ask would probably never know    I definitely recommend reservations here  fairly small place close bit earlier most other Vegas places  Although no trouble finding closed 9pm am rather confused why other reviewers didn't seem notice  <EOR> Just changed original review 5 months ago     Made when Jose Luis Catherine owned it     5 2  stars    Food still good   I guess would say decent    Some stuff menu changed better worst    Weird oil n vinegar wtf! never seen powdered oil jelled balsamic bizarre sucked! atmosphere nice but super creepy band actually lounge act new owner now    Only perk old barkeep Kevin still remains    But long?

Entree ordered night's special which wild mushroom chicken shrimp risotto house salad pomegrante dressing  Overall risotto wasn't bad but chicken little dry having those three items little much opinion just plain ole risotto    Dessert all desserts made daily changes out  night ordered red velvet cake  very soft moist but some reason reminded Albertson's cake  thought still good cream cheese frosting wasn't sweet didn't feel guilty eating it    This great little intimate place date just good night friends  would recommend making reservations since place quite small  only complaint felt did take while food drinks  Maybe didn't think would realize 2nd martini! However would try try place again hopefully extend happy hour stay open longer since operate 5 9 30 10 p m  Definitely great place Martinis! Plus martini card your 13th martini free! <EOR> I came Sunday 9 friends brunch bottomless mimosas  Off bat bad taste mouth cause waitress refused give any sort list 500 mimosa flavors offer   I started strawberry mimosa ordered breakfast burrito  Both just ok  burrito very bland no cheese which supposed come mimosa very little strawberry flavor   After all ate focused drinking ordered round pineapple upside down mimosas   25 minutes later them  good but worth wait  next round supposed blackberry but never came  fact husband bar saw tray mimosas just sitting there  10 minutes later them terrible  tasted cough syrup   Next round decided bar myself order directly assuming owner she wearing regular clothes whereas everyone else wearing uniform   She stood another 5 minutes drying off glasses asked if she working order since last took 25 minutes  She said yes 10 minutes later started making them  round cranberry mimosas also great    After last round ran champagne  What?!

Normal portion most places 2  Filet cooked perfect but beranaise sauce sour much lemon vegetables barely  cooked  House nice enough bring complimentary  desert but honestly would preferred  better meal hearty 75 00 bill <EOR> Great meal last night!

Especially dessert martini's loaded sweet goodies! sip friends martini tasty but definitely bit watered down  ordered creme brulee cheesecake share $8  decent size slice but tasted bit stale  torched surgar icing top nice touch but really didn't add flavor cheesecake  took 2 bites left rest never dessert    The service very good bartender nice friendly  decor contemporary very fresh clean looking  prices definitely high get  did hear quality food gone downhill since change ownership which such bummer  <EOR> Great value money   our table certainly took full advantage $10 bottomless mimosas bloody marys  server actually let switch between two which meant big brownie points us! Great place meet friends brunch  Generous portions well priced  See next time! <EOR> I'm basing 3 star review first experience but happy revisit once back proper meal    The doors open before dinner service menu available which kind annoying since ready early dinner  didn't tell until seated made due   The service lovely very friendly eager over menu detail  ordered off starter menu available which very limited  calamari best town  Light tender cooked perfectly  definitely again!  The cheese plate very disappointing  Super small portions cheese 4 pieces toasted bread hard blob fig spread  few fresh strawberries good  wouldn't recommend it    We looking forward trying dinner menu now know time there! <EOR> Elements real hidden gem can't believe didn't find place sooner   happy hour 5 7 when came happen catch right time 6 30 apM   Bartender even let order another drink right 7 00 PM same price during happy hour   cucumber martini dreamsicle   Decided adventurous didn't disappoint!

I therefore took friend loves fish seafood tonight ordered same things  called before arrived sure still serve Tomahawk ribeye king crabs   Before ordered confirmed server Barry sea bass  Barry told sea bass always menu   I hate say but fish chewy definitely sea bass  showed Barry picture took last time am Yelper never skip picture good food  Barry attentive told next time just show picture first kitchen same fish   If dish always menu why costumers need show picture sure getting same food quality??  The disaster hasn't ended  steak way raw didn't even finish quarter  king crabs warm most part but dry FROZEN part    Our server Barry only 3 tables time he spent 98% attention person 3 tables  reflected fish showed picture he witnessed untouched steak he just avoided table!! Barry apparently doesn't care clients previous servers met before   The only right thing tonight food runner RIGO awesome professional much more attentive Barry  RIGO greeted every table he served made sure guests satisfied RIGO only person asked untouched steak   Thumb RIGO!!    I am going back place no matter much lovED when no consistency food welcoming service  better way spend $100 + bills  <EOR> Elements place kinda confused identity  Once inside see bar lounge  comfy kinda tight spaced  Immediately left dining area appears fine dining restaurant  White tablecloths wine glasses tables  But tabletops brown wrapping paper  If don't budget change clean white table clothes top them glass better yet just rid them  Also devoid any condiments salt pepper  Just unlit candle holder    Only 2 tables served during visit but holiday less distractions    design place any bar talk audible throughout place also sounds kitchen  server woman show very good menu description attentiveness personality  menu some nice appetizers including scallops calamari but try keep budget $25 1 person  ordered day's soup which Cream Broccoli Asparagus  server warned didn't chunks she liked she right puree sadly  Good taste consistency but deserved more  entree chose Elements Jambalaya dish  good but $19 should stand out  portion fine enough shrimp but med  sized should use fewer but jumbo sized look impressive  grilled chicken great    but also said sausage found none dish  rice sauce mixture seemed sort off  something rice  long grain some wild rice mixed but closer risotto  dirty rice menu  $12 more dish should lose Popeye's    only visit give another try before form solid opinion but I'd some changes place   1  Ditch table clothes wine glasses tables  nice placemats wood maybe pictures feature dishes build expectations   2  rid dividing half wall between  dining bar  place look more open serves no function  bar good vibe while dining looks snooty   3  Re evaluate dishes price point look  place wasn't slammed time impress didn't  <EOR> Loved  500+ martini menu Snickers AHHHHMAZING Martini Club rolodex super cute idea small intimate atmosphere!
