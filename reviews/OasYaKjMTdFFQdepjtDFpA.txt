So back menu nothing tempting   finally gave settled just spinach salad which okay but nothing special   husband ordered Mallorcan soup  never understand why call soup    good but someone else mentioned didn't live hype   He also chicken kabobs also okay but somewhat skimpy price   can't remember other dish he ordered but both sangria which wasn't terribly impressive   think if you're going pay consultant write menu copy should sure items live over inflated descriptions   While middle eating salad waitress came over began clear table   fork hand apparent wasn't finished   mouthful salad could only gesticulate leave stuff alone including bread plate which she'd already taken   few minutes she returned hand dessert menus   Now pissed more little hostile when said We're finished eating! Monday night no waiting line tables restaurant couple hours before closing   kind rush job rude epitome poor service   We restaurant com gift certificate which stated 20% tip would added bill   Normally  we'd leave tip if service warranted it   most time city certainly does   But case NOT! Restaurants sometimes specify they'll add tip often don't even if stipulated   But first time ever seen number higher 18% first time real problem it   Unfortunately didn't know until we'd left restaurant since husband certificate paid bill while visited ladies' room   would quiet talk manager   We would probably return Cafe Deia   But many terrific places town would top list   would sure different server  <EOR> We made reservations open table drove find closed Saturday night   ended eating Sedona 2 minutes away excellent dining experience over there    Wish could give ZERO STARS  <EOR> I think time Cafe Deia could great local restaurant   early Feb 09 think still needs bit more time bake     They did everything right surface   Good location great atmosphere excellent service appropriate menu   Where fell down execution food        The sangria no fruit it   ceviche didn't come any chips crackers   stuffed mushrooms small barely stuffed   Everything tasted good but could just much more   final straw though Albondigas raw middle send them back   probably would given place four stars if hadn't that     The flaws easily overcome though try place again few months see progressed   huge fan tapas would see place improve succeed  <EOR> 12 08 started off Baba Gandoush baked eggplant pureed olive oil lemon juice served warm pita bread 3 5 Forks    next ordered Shrimp la Diabla marinated shrimp sautéed garlic red pepper white wine spicy delicious bacon wrapped figs  4 5 Forks each last order spinach stuffed mushrooms topped béchamel sauce Swiss cheese 3 5 Forks Classic Paella saffron rice mixed black mussels shrimp calamari peas carrots  4 5 Forks Service very attentive knowledgeable     09 09 second visit ordered total 5 dishes asked waiter space them appropriately   first dishes albondigas meatballs spicy tomato sauce 2 5 Forks shrimp ajillo shrimp marinated garlic olive oil then sautéed white wine parsley 4 Forks    next served bacon wrapped figs 4 Forks papas bravas roasted sautéed potatoes served spicy sauce 3 5 Forks    long wait reminded server more order come   last tapa fried calamari very spicy sauce   calamari lightly breaded very tender <EOR> Exploring new restaurant always interest   menu Cafe Deia caught attention along few other specials offering   Starting off White Sangria $20 pitcher found bit strong sweet enough   ask some simple syrup could enjoy morel   Amy S  mentioned could really use some real fruit there   sangria loaded fruit mostly lemon slices there   A pretty large menu choose but decided tapas all way   * Serrano Ham Manchego Cheese Thinly sliced imported Serrano ham served Manchego French baguette $9 Highly recommended waiter Chris   Warm baguette arrived few slices cheese salty ham  Yes good very rustic   Reminds kind food grab picnic when you're overseas   give more bread if need too!
