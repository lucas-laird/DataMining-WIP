Needless say kids because don't think care anything but logistical nightmare place ridiculous  multiple people working think just seem there's workers but don't really anything  amount paid going elsewhere next time  <EOR> Get early   Pizza better Cici's Chuck Cheese   Great place families   Bring your wallet $$  <EOR> Love place! $100 2 adults 2 kids all eat pizza fried chicken salad pasta deserts drinks  Also came 2 cards cost $25 125 credits 2 rides each  Las Vegas isn't much kids  when niece nephew came town happy Johns opened up  all blast stuffed full food  favorite game bowling  I'd say  stress reliever lol  sure points loaded card  Return later time cash them all once  Also love themes dinning rooms  Something everyone  <EOR> Love place never bad experience but better come 11 3 Monday Friday isn't busy Freaking Friday <EOR> I enjoyed when 4 year old 7year old nephews came into town  clean food great  best buffet but kids    this all eat heaven them  rides arcade pretty awesome too  I'd definitely back bring nephews nieces again! <EOR> I've gotta say probably worse John's Incredible too  used Rocklin Ca where machines arcade actually worked food hot n ready served  understand buffet themed dinner but pasta station spaghetti penne pasta etc  really cold even meat sauce   decided give fried chicken try but needed hot sauce asked station workers where some  She led cafe dining area handed empty hot sauce bottle walked away fast couldn't even attention  annoying because now flag someone else down chicken getting cold  children birthdays every year Rocklin Ca location service always good  expected more Vegas locations  <EOR> Fun awesome games food decent card instead actual tickets happy ! <EOR> Food terrible  Slushies basically blue ice chips  play right TV shows kids specific age groups place isnt dirty  lunch special baby  <EOR> Gross dishes dirty tables dirty food awful toke parents las vegas visiting emberessed terrible place  Dont unless eat pasta no meat burned chicked cold pizza etc   Garbage! <EOR> Nothing special place   1st time but kids before  Now see why   walk pay entrance buffet   Even if don't want buffet pay anyway reason number 1 why other game places better  must also pay drink credits rides if want rides   buffet basically Chuck E  Cheese without pizza right there   salad section semi healthy pizza desserts section   Reason 2 30 mins opening food didn't look good   chicken didn't look good all  Reason 3 2 ice cream machines wasn't working other could only vanilla  paid buffet but everything isn't par  Ok!  games same everywhere else  bowing lanes don't work correctly  your kids spent all your money prize section isn't all that  Needless say won't going back going back anytime soon  price isn't worth offer  <EOR> So place pretty cool concept looks awesome  Buffet multiple themed dining rooms private party rooms games rides prizes    facility itself nice      BUT     Came party Sunday afternoon CRAZY busy  watch your step you'll probably trip over someone    When first seems able keep food crowd    But time ready leave couple hours later lots ppl waiting around empty food displays   only ice cream dispenser working first time left wasn't working either  Otherwise kinda buffet especially kid party  But decent salad bar lettuce looking clean crisp   Alfredo pizza garlicky!   The play area huge geared mostly grade school kids but there's also few games play area younger ones    noticed several games order which kinda surprising given place relatively new      So think place decent place bring your kids busy day if exists town   may still need work handle crowd     And some tips PARENTS      Teach your kids share! If see line kids waiting play game don't sit playing OVER over    Play once or maybe even twice then back end line!   And      Just because all together group doesn't give 5 right cut front long line waiting KIDS because decided join lady kid actually waiting line in front   yea passive spoke yea didn't let cut   just rude! swear earrings come off hold purse! Haha totally jk    Yeaaah much better experience come midweek something  <EOR> This place joke if you're hungry  food terrible   the trick find clean utensils glasses plates  pizza ok  rest food below average  staff all friendly  But place very dirty   considering many staff members walking around! gaming area cool kids  lots room maneuver around  if your hungry extra cash spend might you <EOR> The food surprisingly good  Someone table every 5 min picking used dishes no complains  Friday noon <EOR> Bottom line kids love place! Picky eaters eat whatever whenever want grandparents sit drink parents enjoy quiet car ride home wiped kids! Every time staff very friendly helpful  Family friendly places many ammenities hard find just during off times! <EOR> To start    decided take kids Valentine's Day! Bad choice partly fault well!!! line wrapped all way outside entry doors took 25mins I didn't even want point but kids excited! Now we're yeah!!! We'll sort yeah! place PACKED! am talking over capacity kind packed! immediately took bigger two kids play while husband stalked around table  wait line every single game    Some games shift lines both sides games next?! 40mins decide find husband    Lol he finally found table 10mins prior finding Now he scared move because he didn't want loose precious table! some pizza    Pretty good selection! offer fried chicken but let's just say some fried chicken eaters house!!!! only saw chicken other peoples plates line long any! exhausting 4hrs decided head yeah! took little whiners At point some dessert!!! kidding me?!?! No anything left even scrap!!! Clearly somebody didn't prepare such big turn considering only 5 30 when left!  The concept awesome games too     Bad location iffy customers Go understand little pricy get! bought midrange game play card but then immediately realized card cannot two places once    2 kids 1 card  basically stuck buying each child I may try again weekday daytime hours coupon If offer them  Only because kids thought cool PS  If decide holiday leave your stroller home! Wear carrier instead! <EOR> I took daughter Friday around noon  place very crowded which plus  price cheaper during time  think $7 99 adults depending old child 0 6 $4 99  admission 75 game credits came $30 which wasn't bad  buffet ok mostly full  But when ran things took while fill back unless specifically requested item put back onto buffet  few interactions staff  fairly pleasant professional  Except when told managers machine did give daughter any tickets line questions led believe she thought lying  Other fun time cool place variety games  would back  But looking reviews weekdays probably best best less crowded = more food readily available buffet cheaper pricing  <EOR> Not incredible!!! Staff rude unhelpful! Food awful! Won't wasting money again  year ago ok experience thought should try again  time much worse  Needs new management something  <EOR> Why can't just experience games rides eat there? Dumb lost business since just gone lunch  <EOR> Cici's Pizza Chuck e Cheese put together    Place big several different rooms where sit eat  also play area kids    I never thought buffet style    Salad bar okay pasta selection sauces suck  Chicken no taste    pizza selection poor very little ingredients them    Dessert sucks well     I back !!! <EOR> Fun place parties  4 years since last booked we're pleased see expanded menu  used just pizza pasta salads  Now there's more pasta choices baked potatoes chicken more  <EOR> While food average place lost major points its lack cleanliness food areas well seating areas  Only half buffet open because assuming busy enough place fully functional but being said since busy night cannot understand why things weren't more tidy replenished sooner if all  When time visit game area everything seemed working nothing order  But enough attendants operating rides  more then few times tonight kids waited until someone showed able very few rides have  understand business demands dictate staffing but what's point purchasing unlimited rides 3 hours when your rides aren't being offered unlimited pace? I'd definitely seek other kid friendly places before spending money again  <EOR> not bad place decided try while living area temporarily slow 12pm everything line time but pizza choices bad pasta okay arcade carnival game area big  give place another try dinner soon hopefully try more varieties pizza dessert  Also alcohol section additional purchase across food line  <EOR> This great place kids families! Bigger better Chuck E Cheese  liked themed dining rooms  servers very attentive cleared dirty plates quickly  There's buffet lots pizza choices salad bar pasta bar few soups baked potato bar fried chicken dessert bar  food good obviously gourmet quality but good price  Gluten free pizza available excellent  also serve beer wine additional charge  kids great time game ride area $14 card good almost two hours three kids  We'll definitely back  <EOR> My kids love it! great family night  while vacation  Food greatest but decent  Lot's choose pizza salad soup potatoes fried chicken which really good lots desserts many drinks choose from  again! <EOR> I birthday party soon walked place struck dirty front desk registration area unorganized  group off side line guess waiting family payment hand stamps sorted  super loud obnoxious surprised staff didn't ask them little more polite  Some games felt greasy handles buttons etc  clean tables scarce  Food par fast food salad wilted  Soft serve machine splattered shirt  never come again  <EOR> We came food hours freahes thing ice cream never again spend money spent almost 100 dollars ice cream <EOR> Great family place!

When tried speak cashier happened she ignored me  Then when asked manager different employee manager never came   Nearly 2 hours visit ask manager again finally once comes dining area where seated  Low behold Manager identified herself Tamara which likely fake name since receipt said AMBER it ok though because video stating name account rudeness  She fact cashier   first thing asked WHY she charged drinks didn't want? children drink soda carbonated beverages which all offer besides coffee but even coffee machine wasn't working ! She said always charges drinks if don't want them take off bill  HELLO NEVER ASKED DRINK CHARGE SOMETHING DID SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR  She rude offered refund but said would leave refund because buffet price admission can't stay if aren't eating however bought play cards all kids!

Perhaps but did find some unique fun flavors snack on   Also cheap everything too!  Great price get   Also adults serve beer wine margaritas   If dull roar many kids wearing down least find solace sweet sweet booze here   Each room different theme  missus opted Tahoe style room cozy enough   But crazier choices room themes   place colorful without being overly obtrusive liked all styles   The arcade      Overall liked it   Bumper cars mini golf few rides few arcade style games   picky am professed child '80's remember days rows upon rows arcade games   know times change but classics row some Donkey Kong Centipede Street Fighter II Ms  Pac Man would long way   Is fun?
