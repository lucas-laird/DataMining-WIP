Having said really wanted place due all glowing reviews had   The menu very vast expected regular menu board specials day  came family appetizers ordered rainbow roll salmon avocado Alaskan roll sashimi platter 3 kinds fish takoyaki beef tataki split amongst four us  entrees shoyu ramen kake udon yakisoba poke salad    The octopus takoyaki little cold but nonetheless wasn't bad  batter nice light sauce dried bonito shavings good  None fish sushi sashimi seemed fresh all  beef tataki forgettable  Now onto entrees portion sizes seemed little smaller used but  fine because did lot appetizers fill bellys  broth ok but wasn't super rich flavor  little bland side  But right mom started eating kake udon she but into something crunchy spinach  She split see aphid spinach! She didn't want scene she just pushed away stopped eating it  But employees came wanted see going on  told them happened showed them bug just stood staring back us  Then waiter brought over another waiter examine both stood if unsure looking walked away  Even if aren't sure good customer service try correct your mistake  wanted but offer mom new take off bill would right thing do! thought counts instead standing gawking doing anything  just ruined meal  Even terrible service still decided give 15% standard tip which believe definitely did deserve  know hard waiters earn money but still behavior unacceptable    Food less great but still didn't warrant star rating until mom found bug food  If better customer service fix situation would helped but service inexcusable  need clean vegetables better  If mom found wonder many other things done unsanitary unnoticed  AGAIN REPEAT COME HERE  don't understand such high rating  <EOR> Food excellent   Services great   Small little place I'd absolutely return for   else say? <EOR> Love here  Foods cheaper side but super fresh!!

Uni  Takoyaki okay came 10 pieces but really didn't see anything ordinary dish  ika good flavor light citrus butter but crunchy uncooked texture rather tender texture ika butter kyaras tapas  wasn't fan texture since little more difficult chew digest  ramen burger wasn't very much impressive either  just tasted soggy ramen smothered pulled pork onions  sauce strong ramen buns very unappetizing texture plain flavor  Service mediocre waitress nice but when food came chef looked very annoyed uninterested spoke very quietly monotoned he just wanted leave sleep corner   Over all fine dining establishment didn't feel fine dine experience all left little dissatisfied  probably wouldn't come back but suppose worth try if haven't ever yet  <EOR> Not sure big deal place  Maybe because aren't many Izakaya joints area? food underwhelming  Usually there's some innovation Izakaya   some new flavour profile etc  menu very basic   the most basic sushi options typical deep fried stuff  Fried pork belly   was fried pork belly  Would way visit again <EOR> This great place quality Japanese food Las Vegas relaxed environment excellent service  menu bit overwhelming many choices but 8 different plates all excellent prices definitely reasonable  agree other reviewers crips pork belly unexpected winner! <EOR> 4 price points offered 3 overall  Cool offerings such sea cucumber raw octopus silverfish however quality freshness peak all them   Robata high point sushi rolls mediocre  Service surprisingly efficient fast  Fun Japanese beer selections lots reasonably priced Sakes  <EOR> Izakaya somewhere else great Izakaya!

The other note service 7 8 minutes placed order looking around restaurant dining solo tonight soak authentic homey decor  server must thought being impatient he then warned specific dishes ordered take while cook  concerned time but think warning would better suited placing order 8 minutes after   Regardless definitely plan coming back more people enjoy better variety awesome menu  <EOR> Authentic Japanese far strip  very crowded during dining hours  waited 30 minutes spot counter 8 00 pm January  Service okay  Only checked few times but when did check courteous kind prompt  food great except ramen  love ramen tasted Americanized ramen  noodles spaghetti broth didn't taste made scratch  other hand takoyaki best America   Come everything but ramen  street Ramen Sora Monta Ramen <EOR> I don't really understand place 4 5 stars  I've many izakaya places especially since am LA area most famous places around LA love good sushi japanese tapas ramen!   basically place WORTH money wait!!

Priced between 2 50 4 95  some reason first round pork belly tasted better second but still fatty delicious! beef tongue favorite but always favorite order  could've skipped shrimp lamb chop very tender juicy!  The takoyaki amazing came takoyaki sauce going guess mayonnaise? But altogether probably best had!  Their gyoza good too! gyoza kick lately really fulfilled appetite  came 6 if wasn't bf would've eaten all 6 them myself    The ramen burger prolly 3 5  messy soggy flavored I'd like  If come back probably wouldn't again  fries good tho!  And ramen itself good  spicy side but ended adding after  good! Loved actual noodles themselves  came same toppings regular ramen just smaller portion obviously  still egg pork seaweed bamboo which highly appreciated only being 5 dollars    All food only 60 bucks!!

The Miso Black Cod Salmon collar must gets enoki mushrooms   Good sashimi well loved sharing ton variety small plates    Definitely worth trip off strip  <EOR> Came dinner while Vegas!  I ordered salmon rice salmon roll  rice bowl definitely good  didn't enjoy all because salmon waaaay salty  didn't expect salty couldn't even finish bowl    Service service great  didn't expect them give anything when told them couldn't finish food since salmon salty  gave extra sashimi side complimentary    Overall great experience since service great but food didn't hit spot  <EOR> This poor man's Raku  solo terrible end bar seat staring register  Izakaya interior kinda but unacceptable  Very difficult served no assistance staff all  Love large mugs cold Japanese beer  ordered special fish flown Japan sea bream sashimi style  strange looks server took over 25 minutes come out  Actually all dishes took 15 minutes minimum  overrated sea urchin dumplings sticky overcooked boring  ordered 3 different yakitori 2  Those 2 seemed precooked reheated grill  stopped yakitori due no service just average food  more civilized options Las Vegas  <EOR> Pros Good food authentic Japanese Izakaya tapas good service  Reasonable price  Variety food   Cons Limited parking space but does stop come back    Try Tonight's Specials    Thank much spreading goodness Japanese food other sushi!! <EOR> Their miso ramen best ramen U S   Definitely hits spot hangover  <EOR> Tuna sashimi came warm slimy  Yellowtail sashimi half edible white meat half pink tissue skin   thought maybe I'd give chance try something new but common sense kicked quick first bite    happening   Server although nice disappeared 15 minutes     sure if dinner rush 11 pm just understaffed  <EOR> Food wise fantastic izakaya  menu full interesting things never tried before shark cartilage yam uni chawanmushi  Yes many things even Monday which when everyone seems recommend coming maximum freshness availability but many things chose back ups really no disappointment all except maybe missing uni dumplings we'll back that!   ready substitutions!  The drink menu presentation somewhat lacking izakaya  decent sake selection many unique sweet options but no shochu rather lackluster beer wine selection  think based other reviews info online may decent Japanese whisky selection but well presented curated menu unless you're sitting bar guess ask more detail    Minus another star atmosphere parking situation  know Vegas whatever but staff didn't need encourage creepy misogynistic bachelor party going table next taking shots them obliging requests show them tattoos etc  plenty more appropriate places stuff town  then parking despite location rather ugly strip mall looks should plentiful parking drive around lot few times find space even weekday  When finally space saw all spaces marked 80 minute parking  Seriously? strip mall?! Plan ahead arrive early! <EOR> Izakaya relatively small Japanese joint designed drinking crowd  variety food types sizes just everyone extremely hungry those just wanting beer some sides find need   That being said such extensive menu everything average when comes quality flavor which should expected given size restaurant  Just structural point view menu size complexity would struggle crowd serve  Don't wrong reasonably happy food received but wasn't blown away enough signify higher rating    The drink menu also quite extensive everyone should able find something them    Granted place quite busy expect reservations should made if you're hoping without extended wait  staff definitely friendly although could bit short handed sometimes few people covering whole restaurant    Bottom line Izakaya good choice those groups people varying food desires group wanting try variety Japanese style foods  Don't expect best version anything you've ever but think few places match restaurant terms selection options size  <EOR> Come some good Izakaya!

Their menu very extensive many other Izakayas  know yakitori skewers people's favorite but skipped all just ordered few dishes caught attention  When Izakaya always start Takowasa  dont know why but thats just thing  love raw food Takowasa just raw octopus smothered light wasabi  Its very good cant never wrong this!  Then started ordering other dishes them Uni Chawanmushi  Its very delicate egg dish  Its steamed egg eith some shitake mushroom tooped uni  really soft flavor wonderful  Though dont eat Shitake mushroom its flavor wasnt strong able eat them fine  But let boyfriend eat mushroom itself haha   Second dish ordered Zaru Soba?
