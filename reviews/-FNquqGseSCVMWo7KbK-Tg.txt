I love all ingredients tastes really fresh am huge fan guacamole! actually made fresh doesn't texture taste frozen ones! use charge extra guacamole your burrito bowl salad   etc  but now if vegetarian included! yeay!   Chipotle must try everyone consider healthiest fast food town  <EOR> First off Chipotle  already know expect when walk door  food consistent staff nice but place dirty  Granted filled college kids busy time them right classes UNLV around 4ish   being said hard over dirtiness dining area lack salt shaker hey found sitting table some kids thought theirs hold all eternity but maybe Chipotle should invest more one   Staff nice return again  <EOR> Possibly worst Chipotle town  Most employees served barely put anything bowls  asked little bit more steak lady literally scoops 1 piece steak  Cheese? sprinkle last bucket cheese next month  guacamole? Guac extra expect least proper scoop  She gives half scoop  Seriously? end feel eating steak bowl but rather vegetable one  <EOR> The chicken flavorful usually burrito bowl extra corn salsa hot sauce  good everyday school  <EOR> Chipotle favorite chain restaurant! doesn't matter if you're vegas California Arizona! food portions always AMAZING!

Overall top five Chipotles   oh wait think only five    okay number all Chipotles  Why? booze duh  Plus clean friendly staff  ] <EOR> Conveniently located across UNLV just short walk away school yourself nice burrito burrito bowl tacos Chipotle  serve everything any standard Chipotle  become busy times especially around lunch but if during non peak hours lines usually pretty short your food fairly quickly  lock bathroom ask cashier front unlock press button which unlocks bathroom you  Good food good place  <EOR> I love Chipotle but gave FOOD POISONING  Whoever talked corporate wasn't quite helpful although manager Chipotle very accommodating when reported food poising  They're  nice but quality when comes burrito great  would spill burrito wouldn't wrapped properly  prefer going other Chipotles one  <EOR> Pretty much exactly you'd expect Chipotle no more certainly no less   Being literally right across street UNLV normally pretty busy  Plenty parking off street strip mall esque parking lot though   Front line cashiers food makers very pleasant speak huge burritos very filling!   A nice change pace watching monotonous Sandwich Artist Subway literally weigh every slice chicken your already ridiculously expensive sub! Shade intended <EOR> Not usual Chipotle but always great food friendly service  bit more crowded being campus seating challenge  <EOR> This Chipotle nothing special  They're pretty good dealing crowds lunchtime usually pretty clean  deal homeless people parking lot sometimes  Most them nice people down luck but once while you'll hostile really put damper lunch  young college female usually try there? groups during daylight hours  <EOR> So came b4 class coworker   line long which no shocker chipotle  line moved pretty quickly when turn order asked enchirrito really cheesy burrito    say enchirrito   burrito builder tells busy would something else  said no I'd enchirrito  guys gets burrito breaks then says want regular burrito right   no enchirrito enchirrito finally someone else comes over enchiroto  annoyed but good  Ate whole thing   Totally worth having aggressive order across  <EOR> Place great  If u wanna b low key  serve beer here!!!!!

UNLV obviously lines little control during semester  tend hit during times when UNLV session  Even though busy lines does move quickly all pretty much no brainer menu if you've enough times   I tend always chicken burrito black beans little sprinkle cheese dash sour cream bunch lettuce  hardly ever disappointed Chipotle all ingredients fresh meats hormone free etc   The parking pretty ridiculous though  don't know many times pulled done loop end back Maryland Parkway drive back just head further back lots    Anyway if need quick burrito some other fresh mex fair you're area hit place up  prefer over other fast Mexican place which Cafe Rio down street  <EOR> Well came dine girlfriend today worst service  empty just standing yet told hold up  Then lady rushing messed order mind only two line clearly own music playing due explicit language playing song Drake specific   told didn't  any lettuce she responded rudely want re tone voice tell she didn't want just let be   P S served girlfriend extremely burnt pieces food  <EOR> worst place ever dog could've wrapped burrito better  if mess someone's burrito don't just wrap 2 sheets tin foil instead 1 pass off good burrito <EOR> I come Chipotle class sometimes though far less eat Student Union  Still proximity UNLV really cool place eat when you're neighborhood    The way Chipotle works simple walk decide want eat your food  bowl burrito form taco form  Then decide kind beans rice protein want followed lettuce cheese guacamole whatever    Personally think could wrong getting steak carne asada burrito  pinto beans white rice cheese pico de gallo lettuce  All those things extras though meat  meat main event does fail  meat good! seasoned well perfectly tender! chicken ok but steak king! <EOR> This place pretty cool come choose want put your burrito much better those other mystery meat burritos used to   Mostly college kids across street even weekends   Pretty basic clean chipotle  Parking lot shared strip mall looks bit shady but hey there's coffee bean right across really can't complain much  <EOR> I've many Chipotles throughout valley mixed experiences attitudes  however does skimpy portions which great! Rhr customer service always cheerful pleasant too  <EOR> As much place much when first came location did good job fulfilling large order  Located busy plaza across UNLV strongly suggest ordering ahead time pick up  could use mobile app online but way preordering best your food time  If need order pick next day start your order day customize your oder s then submit next day  can't place order future date point but least order started then just hit submit day your actual pick up    They don't adult quesadilla menu  kid's meal quesadilla site  if want quesadilla click burrito then pick only cheese and chicken if want but then roll burrito   kind weird but close enough  Would recommend  <EOR> This first time ever let down Chipotle   Everything burrito bowl subpar   Lettuce brown edges rice seemed undercooked carnitas  bad picked all off didn't eat it   almost Cafe Rio instead   Now wish would have  <EOR> It's over rated  ingredients fresh actually taste fresh onions even though hate onions hey freshness talkin' subway but mexican form  wanted order two but since line kinda deal hesitant even ask another   I ordered chicken burrito way made seemed half burrito  like square shaped burrito usual rectangular shape which made think jipped    I'd eat again but nothing crazy over for  <EOR> They still don't peel dead skin off onions! wonder if even read comments yelp <EOR> The hubby came strange time Memorial Day   no line   food excellent   largest burrito bowl ever received Chipotle   very generous   tasted fantastic   love marinate chicken   left very happy  <EOR> Below standard even Chipotle  Rice cooked all way  Food lukewarm  Salsas flavorless maybe fresh?
