Instantly friend freaked demanded he needed something asap because didn't want lose job but angry he done  He cocky said he would never lose job actually happens frequently!!!! Talk careless  unless carry cash only unless love going through hassle canceling your debit card because now hands someone else  Worst customer service ever! <EOR> If find yourself just wanting cold night drink night much anyways feel free stop most Offensively impolite lady staff only bar know if spitting drink means want kiss you????????   pass My long story short here  Next         P S only referring location other locations great staff <EOR> I decided give place shot Saturday 5 19 18 because wanted watch Basketball Play Offs  I arrived 5 50 P M  parking lot pretty empty which found odd   I inside sat bar  maybe 7 8 people inside total   I asked bar tender if he any blended fruity drinks   he said NO  No blended drinks period  like   Hmmm  OK   It still close 95* outside would hit spot   I ended ordering Mai Tai  asked food menu ordered 1 2 lb Pub Burger comes fries $7 00 which 24 hour special offer   Food pretty good  Can't complain   Happy Hour 5 7 P M  12 2 A M  50% off drinks Pizzas select few appetizers $5 00   Now   on basketball game situation  All say WOWWWWW  They huge screens pool table area NONE them basketball game on They 1 tiny lil tv screen bar game NO SOUND Every single screen Hockey Game sound on  SMH  No even watching them either   I never try watch basketball game again  Still can't believe it  Drinks weak hell served tiny lil glass   I ordered 1 more done food   Then left  Bartender wasn't personable all   and he dirty nasty band aid fingertip area   That couldn't help but notice he grabbed fruit limes etc  drinks   Ewwww   Maybe good place eat Happy Hour play pool darts friends   But definitely Basketball  <EOR> Food great even though timing slow but just due less staff working place <EOR> I used love going P T's Bar Grill located kind corner Bermuda Silverado ranch  3 pool tables large dartboard area great place hang hang your friends  night when drinking pretty heavily into altercation another customer things escalated very quickly when alcohol involved  patron ended getting face really total bummer situation but bartenders didn't seem mind again between matter could tell something going on  going drinking while didn't want into fight bar same time could used little bit help while getting into altercation  <EOR> Bartender super RUDE part customer service clear on  classic dive bar  fine but if want customer's come back need least hospitable  Super nice waitress food okay  <EOR> I really PT's  layout definitely better ones  Large square bar  Elevated pool table area  Some tables booths  dark  Very clean well kept  Molly bartenders super nice friendly attentive  Otherwise PT's  There's across street street  then few more down next street  But vibe particularly nice Molly standout bartender  <EOR> Their pizza amazing!!! also ordered nachos good thing boyfriend split them! huge!! delicious!!!

Food bad  Very chill atmosphere morning  But if arent big fan smoking smell isnt place but staff friendly constantly asking doing! Would definitely come back next time! <EOR> Beware PT's        star much most locations Crappy service   Dirty bathrooms   Cold food brought separate times friends food    place awful  <EOR> For those may new Pt's classic neighborhood pub found almost any Vegas neighborhood    I'm found Pt's because its close proximity house shuffle board good bar food pool tables bar staff  <EOR> Well USED great location excellent service  Alas winds change blew through place tornado    While very happy old manager Jason when he promoted corporate place just took huge dump he left never recovered   It just doesn't instill much confidence when see cook leaving men's room toilet plunger hand still wearing apron! Eeeeew!   One would also expect bar female manager female waitresses reasonably clean ladies' room all use too  But ladies' room always filthy    New manager chick also needs class customer service  Making sure everyone see your little boobies might some mileage male customers but own boobs  look them whenever want  Yours impress your poor service skills  <EOR> PT's Bar Grill fun place if want grab drink watch game play some pool  definitely cheapest bar town almost feel you're closer strip suburbs but nevertheless nice place lots room kick back hang friends  actual dart boards actual darts  lot fun play cricket other dart games boyfriend  3 pool tables which several TVs around them watch something while guys play pool    Steve late night bartender he normally top making sure don't wait more minute so  don't pour very heavy any PT's bar no exception  <EOR> Confused server upset husband brought camera take pictures group celebrate friend's birthday  Apparently she doesn't know already dozens cameras there  <EOR> Love place  locals favorite  pool games great  bartenders really good  Food good bar food  locals come fun place! <EOR> Mikey pours best 'Dirty Bong Waters' since Redhawk  Always takes care customers  Steve's pretty good when he actually works <EOR> Probably best pts Vegas  Also clean  Totally forgot bartenders name but she awesome  She suggested some new drinks they've probably become some faves  Gotta try buffalo hot wings which die for  <EOR> good PT's much more other PT's Silverado Ranch Blvd  <EOR> I prefer pizza rather wings here  lemon pepper extremely salty really needs lot ranch offset flavor   The pizzas good though  Can't wrong pepperoni mushroom pizza    Bartender alright  received better service other PT's but think rotate every location anyways  <EOR> Great service steve bartenders alway cool   Pool tables dart boards well kept  <EOR> The most unattentive bartenders waitresses PTs  If guy bartender isn't don't bother  friend finished beer least 10 minutes before did didn't offer refill until around time finished  wish could say just off night but usual case  don't post negative reviews but just gets unacceptable some point  If you're lucky enough comped drink start buying lottery tickets  <EOR> PT's delicious food    big portions fresh off grill great deals    drinks pretty great well  Happy hours really good prices Happy hour  If youre looking party say more laid back bar no rowdy guest no loud drinkers even during games  Its quite place eat drink   One thing put them map freakin amazingly delicious creative ways serve fried  OMG fries whole new category its own PTs    if just need quick snack try some fries  Dont wrong Ive tried other food its just good but those fries addictive!  The service isn't anything shout world kinda favor towards certain ppl regulars im sure but tend some bit more then others    but quite attentive rest just some more then others    dont smile much either    But never bad service here! Just laid back more quiet service bad thing!   Id say if haven't go! Especially during happy hour! <EOR> Ok no longer favorite PTs  would come work relax enjoy drink  don't same enjoyment place anymore   Rewind back few months  bf came night few drinks  order Bellini which champagne peach purée  bartender Carla didn't know made face making some absurd drink  typical champagne cocktail! plus you're bartender you're supposed know your drinks  She knew mimosa when ordered she should known Bellini was  Anyway 10 minutes later bf accidentally knocked over drink shattering glass floor  thoroughly apologized understand Carla annoyed she clean it    Now fast forward visit last night  order beer blonde bartender  Really nice inviting  enjoying time  Then Carla comes over says bf want another beer? Then he answered sure take another one  Then she replies it?
