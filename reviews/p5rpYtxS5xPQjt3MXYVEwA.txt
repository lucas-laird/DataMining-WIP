Thank team Greens Proteins making wonderful! <EOR> Awesome place healthy food options Henderson area  staff friendly knowledgeable products always recommend best new stuff try  always awesome too    I've many times usually green wellness drink but time tried acai berry juice instead   really good   Very fruity but still kale spinach super smoothie case you're counting calories need  your fruit  veggie fix  wellness smoothie also great choice since combines fresh fruit veggies together blend  really awesome well  think both excellent choices     For food usually bbq chicken pizza because delicious only 320 calories whole thing  nothing short miracle  something delicious healthy thethe Same  time? ? Boggles mind but still keeps coming back  definitely recommend  place anyone looking eat healthier but having trouble making switch  easy here  <EOR> I love food but NEVER going back location! mess order every time then feel bad then when remake ready he walked past 5 fuckin times he didn't see me! pissed! good customer service! What's point calling ahead if ur always gonna mess up!!!! <EOR> I eat once month  Great tasting food every time! Delicious smoothies ! Even better mix fresh juices! prepare your food any substitutions request always bring food your table  favorite jicama fries any plate  I usually still order another side them only item haven't yet tried ostrich! Don't count though  Maybe day   Lol <EOR> Disappointment     This place smart marketing ambience   just going give quick positive negative feedback Positives Space clean modern simple  decor  Easy sit chat while                 Turkey real sliced turkey processed deli meat   Negatives Food quality annoyed come across everyone  want think amazing healthy food   item menu organic   also don't lot alternative ingredients choose from  seem limited knowledge gluten free vegan foods  leads next negative                    Price pretty expensive   least 7 dollars smoothie least 10 dollars sandwich   would understandable if used organic high quality ingredients but no   ingredients cost much all therefore taking advantage people                    Environmentally friendly? First all don't use real plates  They care health but environment  use paper plates   Okay least quickly biodegrade   But wait! utensils crappy plastic ones   heck? consistent    Overall seriously feel whoever opened place does care any things market   think know being healthy trying bank it   should serving organic fruits veggies meats   should vast working knowledge other types foods substitutions  should using real plates silverware using all biodegradable compostable things   And should insulting intelligence  Needless say going back   I'd rather spend money place gives quality food normal price  <EOR> I never thought I'd see day where choose healthy green smoothie over Starbucks frap! Haha location right next Starbucks but trying eat healthier decided give try    The line really long  Almost door  kind stand off side because busy  staff extremely nice  menu items listed well calorie count much appreciated  decided try acai berry smoothie acai green grapes blueberries blackberries pineapple coconut beet powder spinach kale honey banana peaches   Yum!   The smoothie took awhile but delicious very filling me  also decided low carb Caesar salad   actually really disliked salad  recommended  Maybe Parmesan crisps top EVOO caesar dressing but didn't way tasted all  However decor very beautiful vibrant green chairs real plants along 2 waterfalls against back walls  Beautiful relaxing!   Pros beautiful decor friendly staff free wifi nice outside patio seating option complimentary cucumber water tv's along wall   Cons hard find parking long lines sometimes door   Would back? Yes! Next time would love try ahi protein salad chocolate peanut butter banana shake!

Even Yelp check in gives $1 off still could justify spending even $6 50 smoothie   turkey club wheat wrap tofu fries   wrap great tofu fries were   interesting   just kept wishing real fries but did say TRY eat healthy   friend vegan pizza she loved but she also regular customer much healthier wallet do   find interesting joint which promotes health wellness also advertises HCG friendly menu  isn't HCG unsafe illegal approved FDA?  Anyway overall if you're vegan vegetarian want take walk healthier side come Greens Proteins   certainly live name! <EOR> Great food drink offerings but teenage employees no hustle so ever  try again another night but impressed slow moving  Again may caught them bad night  <EOR> I thoroughly enjoyed place!  Our whole team stopped during 2 hour game break @ World's  wanted something super light   I ordered Wellness drink SW Tofu Soy Chorizo 1 2 Avocado  wheat wrap Which young lady confirmed vegan Raw Vegan Chili Cheese Fries Jicama fries sprinkled spices topped cashew cheese blended pumpkin seed chili onions diced tomatoes   Which split both sister super filling!

I personally think food little over priced faux fries bland texture just doesn't me    The smoothies pricey but delicious! <EOR> I yesterday morning 3 25 12 meeting work cancelled  wasn't best mood sister wanted grab drink Starbucks  craving something different decided check Greens Proteins because remembered seeing Yelp   Ummm    gurrrrl puhleeze  prices insanity  isn't drink should cost $7+ unless comes solid gold cup  spent long time looking over menu because family juices LOT many drinks things home already but 5x price    The staff friendly but honestly couldn't mind  settled V9 but little curious why girl making drink using jarred vegetable base stock drink  When asked girls behind counter  base said didn't know anything just held jar see  Flavor bases pork chicken beef vegetable bases chock full partially hydrogenated soybean oil transfat hydrolyzed soy protein MSG   No bueno  vegetable base Top Ramen flavor packet flavor drink   I disappointed drink pricey don't guts walk place especially staff friendly  took drink V9 even more disappointed flavor temperature good combination  Ice cold salty ramen flavor mixed wheat grass dried tomato seeds first noticed  couldn't drink any more but thought if took home heated might nice soup  ended giving dad juices vegetables 3x day he told buy drink again  He said cabbage giving drink strange flavor   As dietetics student UNLV would love see place rid agave syrup it more fructose high fructose corn syrup even MORE unhealthy! well I'd love see them scrap unfermented soy bean products stuff toxic causes many adverse health problems specifically thyroid reproductive organs no business establishment prides itself being healthy  If things gone would raise star rating  I'd love see raw offerings menu it line noticed ordered see drink prices decrease 2 dollars  Even though may better alternative Jamba Juice really says something when Jamba Juice considered affordable alternative  sad when checked paying dollar off coupon drinks  Agh! frustrating    The place pretty staff nice but restaurant empty  long prices high can't see being any place other splurge treat  may try place again but wouldn't reorder V9  <EOR> it OK  thought healthy joint cashier suggested bison cheesesteak ok know doesn't sound healthy! spinach wrap  Also wellness smoothie  Unwrapped meal home took bite pretty greasy lacked flavor couldn't even finish wrap  wellness smoothie other hand great! don't know if worth $7 99 price tag since huge bottle green machine naked juice costco $6  Next time probably won't listen advice young kid register ill try something else  <EOR> I meaning come long time!  After work starving despite Saturday afternoon crowds shopping center figured heard should worth it    When opened door put immediately line   wasn't long wait thought would be   ordered food took time really check place while waited    The place packed looked plenty seating Inside out loved earthy vibe bright green chairs  took better look menu noticed also cater those crazy RAW HCG dieters which pretty cool    As waited summer berry salad antioxidant smoothie pissed didn't order ostrich burger originally thinking about  Damn always tell myself gut first pick looked good  could see cook just everything brick oven    The manager owner noticed being nosy made joke told first time couldn't help it!

Although gone many times smoothies admit eaten only twice neither memorable price give them credit making difference give people healthy options but example    the tofu fries healthy just deep fried tofu sticks daiya cheese based vegetarian pizza good compared some places versions but only way truly vegan unless want served raw cracker gluten free crust substitute crust getting charged 14 99 otherwise if dont mind raw crust its 11 99 in opinion rather small inhaled just few bites say its 8 inches most very thin  great value If build your own custom meal let pick 1 protein 1 vegetable 1 grains great value plate very very small   although healthy tasting oily try taste better  but time lunch smoothie looking 20 00 minimum wont full after  Another issue find very busy lunch time only ever 1 person working cash register line door seats all taken during rushes  combine people asking questions menu being indecisive included I think should least 1 more register things running more smooth  <EOR> I chicken sausage pizza excellent  see other reviews liking portion size  other hand thought just right  If want piece cardboard imitation cheese sausage made knows 10 bucks there's plenty options  firm believer pay for  quasi macrobiotic diet plenty options me  layout very clean service prompt  back more  <EOR> Ok fat booty decided start loosing weight Gotta shape ladies right?? decided start going gym happens same plaza restaurant   When first time really didnt feel it  thought hipster central such but still wanted try did fell love some items  The tofu fries Margarita pizza delicious think taste better fact its only 320 calories whole 10 inches ZA!!!  Some things menu totally juices well rather juice home  But appreciate variety its mixed fast food joint table service  really nice owners super cool well   It little pricy but all healthy food thats sad  place packed but service still fast efficient Food comes cooked right far havent single bad experience   If freak counting your calories intake want some good food wont look jabba hutt stop stop  <EOR> Since last comment management wrote e mail inviting guest  politely declined but absolutely appreciate gesture  show right people read comments post try improve things  everyone happier  Nothing else returning customer could ask = <EOR> Loved create your own option chose great very flavorful piece chicken rice salad very satisfying  Wait time wasn't bad being during Sunday brunch lunch hour  <EOR> Great food drinks  acai berry smoothie ahi protein salad  Both great combination your healthy fix new year  Fast friendly service  <EOR> Great service good atmosphere strawberry watermelon drink great  family loves Cali grilled chicken wrap  <EOR> Teriyaki Chicken very dry  Fries good   Turkey club dry  Fries good definitely worth try   Recommend if looking new place <EOR> Came hubby first time  recently started working decided start eating healthier  ordered burger jicama fries husband ordered wrap tofu fries  Before coming heard such great reviews place  completely honest wasn't really impressed  food lacked flavor me  husband enjoyed because he felt healthy meal compared stuff usually eat  told healthy food also taste good  He recently back turkey burger said tasted dry  place couple blocks called Elixer Organic Cafe think much tastier  might consider returning try something different day before completely ruling out  <EOR> One aspect really enjoy restaurants when immaculately clean  Everything spotless organized  plenty seats outside patio if weather nice inside very spacious trendy tables nice wall backdrop running water several televisions  Service alright  Nothing going beyond means customer service nothing  bad either   If anyone raw foodie don't expect place state uses USDA Organic certified items just because named 'Greens Proteins' that's question going ask next time in! menu definitely little more healthier your fast food alternatives wraps pizza sandwiches salads smoothies juices works  pricing since could green smoothie Whole Foods  50 cents less one lot less sweeter     I purchased vegetable wrap green smoothie all which came $20 definitely cheap most health alternative restaurants aren't   pleasantly surprised delicious green smoothie turned out! While $7 50 little much same time cup generous size its price  very sweet agave nectar stevia nothing green smoothies Whole Foods which little more less sweeter end  even more impressed vegetable wrap filling size had take other portion to go came tofu like fries seasoning dip sauce side amazing!   Walking little questionable place even more price but tasting myself actually quite good here  debated giving three stars but reminded green smoothie definitely place I'd return when neighborhood craving healthy alternative other restaurants surrounding them! <EOR> This awesome place vegans those seeking eat clean  chocolate peanut butter smoothie delicious favorite! vegan burger also delicious must try! highly recommend place everyone <EOR> Decided try spot dinner gym last week  create your own meal lets select protein starch veggie sauce fairly extensive list  food well cooked healthy steamed fried   when applicable sauce fantastic  love menu good vegan vegetarian food options!

When server finally brought food outside she forgot forks napkins  She told need inside those did offer any assistance ask meal was  definitely return recommend friends family try somewhere else when Vegas! Decour inside very nice liked water fountains laid back atmosphere but food service absolutely horrible  <EOR> Not great opinion!   Cons vegetable smoothie V9 think water chewed celery   burgers much meat without any flavor meat only thing could mouth around   gives illusion being organic restaurant but isn't!  Pros interior very crisp clean jicama fries yummy would even better slice lime side   <EOR> If you're thinking healthy splurging place it  yes such thing  means staying track your goals while still getting some enjoyment your meal    We tried multigrain pancakes vegan buffalo chicken tenders  Highly recommend both    Prices moderately fair  only dieters may benefit place people low carb plans  If read nutrition facts mostly all items your daily serving day just meal proceed caution other place Win win  <EOR> This spot when lazy find food food  smoothies filling healthy ready under ten minutes  Service fine <EOR> Tofu Fries!
