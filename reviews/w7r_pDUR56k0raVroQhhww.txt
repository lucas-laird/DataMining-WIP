Then put pico de gallo top  Served poblano sonoma jack cheese quesadilla wedges dressing guacamole salsa ranch  We always ask both extra because together DELICIOUS!!! The salad really amazing combination flavors very good!! There bar far where seat people pretty loud  The thing noticed location very busy think while happy hour when sports maybe because many tables open bar very busy  Plus being busy servers very busy don't service would normally get  sat awhile before drink refills   Other LOVE going dinner good size bowl salad many times take home long did put dressing all over it   Check place out!  I hear pretty good drink specials during happy hour food really good!! always consistent! <EOR> Had Cesar Trojan burger     awesomeness  Wife Prime Ranch steak     awesomeness well  All sides great staff extremely friendly attentive   definitely future trips vegas  <EOR> Good food late night love dinning work  servers super nice but food always taken awhile arrive hence 4 stars     Overall nice locals spot beer some fun <EOR> Good local bat big selection  bourbon good food idea open 24 7 poker machines bar comp drink if gambling   <EOR> My first thought place super cozy! Steiner's all local pub should have warm atmosphere drink food specials  I wasn't impressed Reuben sandwich  OK but lacked true Reuben taste needed more dressing  Good beer specials dining mate enjoyed  place some nice holiday décor going think may leave some those pretty lights year round! A solid choice pub fare comfy atmosphere if you're neighborhood  <EOR> It often anyone finds bar pub tavern but must say would drop again future   So going away dinner friend leaving Las Vegas obviously another joint served gourmet burgers   Afterwards many party animals wanted turned casual dinner into more complete entertainment evening bar just across street turned fun hanging funeral other 2 people showed up   quick search Yelp app all converged Steiner's Nevada Style Pub   When walked place looked pretty dead   Luckily just section establishment shutdown time night which offered open if wanted sit there   Very accommodating   Bonus points noted   section bar lively good mix people just hanging having looks rather fabulous good time   Good sign   After quick looksee decided sit looks two long bar counter seating areas built right next each other complete railing splitting table into two halves   Since all knew each other avoided any potential awkward moments when two dudes accidentally made eye contacts fella across table   But construction social table elevated challenge difficulty sharing plates appetizers which probably bartenders looking when gauging which drunken patrons cut off night    While most others opted beers whiskeys other adult libations studied food menu under burgers section but made last minute play change time ordering Burger Month I am total sucker specials    burger prepared nice medium rare requested toppings all came together nicely very satisfied ordering decision   nachos somebody order good too   Would come back?  If read wrote beginning already know answer otherwise scroll back buddy! Why?  Service good waiter checked regularly even cook kitchen came check if liked burger nice!    Food good  place fun far where work   Plenty TVs watch whatever games Sochi Olympics while option chill hell out   Almost no brainer   Review #9 2014 <EOR> When find seat bar place bee's knees! bartenders couldn't more friendly happy hour specials off chain! BOGO beers 4 7 food specials 4 6  place almost always busy no matter time day  should tell something!   Shout bartender Nicole she's super rad! <EOR> Still decent place drink but gone downhill  Good selection beers  However service good used be  Probably better try elsewhere  <EOR> Always good atmosphere   Great service bartenders learn your name even If your first only time there  variety beer selection astounding mention food menu  If just few drinks maybe pretzel chips salsa  little more lamb chop appetizer awesome burgers  once become regular! <EOR> I left satisfied full   I came girls need serious savory fix long day decorating cupcakes   I ordered beef dip onion rings yum  big fan onion rings here  beef dip didn't much flavor hoped but au jus more made it  friends very happy meals well    We didn't drink particular occasion but looking beer menu good selection look forward coming back trying some more food drink options especially wings soup nachos    which looked great other people's plates passed way out   Overall very happy place  <EOR>
