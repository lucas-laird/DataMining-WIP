The front seating area All American fairly clean loud area big bar lots TV's open directly into equally loud slightly more hideous casino floor  great people watching Rio doesn't always attract most savory folks  especially great day burger NASCAR town  Need say more? back seating area restaurant bit 'nicer' if you're coming steak might want eat back there   Both lunch dinner menus fairly similar featuring wide variety steaks pretty much every generic thing offered all bars across country  choice day All American Classic Burger which sautéed mushrooms Swiss cheese standard lettuce tomato onions  gets served decent presentation but bit disappointed waffle fries immediately saw plate typically fan wasn't given choice anything else  meat decent flavor but way overcooked medium rare ordered while friend's medium cooked would liked  Did mix orders just cook order properly? bun good flavor but bit thick way dry  sautéed mushrooms peppery good flavor Swiss melted tasted good  while used maybe  lettuce provided all veggies fresh good well   My waffle fries mentioned quite disappointing kind stale very hot pretty generic  years coming All American remembered getting basket random fries some waffle curly skinny fat  would more welcome liked variety even if seemed always eating mixed bottom barrel   Overall burger good but nothing world  $12 99 probably right casino location such but think little steep is  Plus service typically less stellar every time there  think particular trip waitress took food order drink order same time  Talk being prompt  probably aren't many other choices off strip Rio but if you're property want burger can't wrong just don't your way come here  <EOR> Was town day April 13th family drag races  opted stay Rio since parking lot accommodating all trailers cars etc  place seemed would good quick bite much  Where start 20 minute wait seated turned into 30  Drinks ordered right away but waited another 15 minutes drinks dropped off before waiter came take order  Now over all food wasn't horrible but mediocre over priced best    think best thing version wedge salad Not hard screw up  Shrimp cocktail consisted 4 jumbo shrimp lemon wedge saltines tiny cup sauce $14  no thanks  Oysters Rockefeller $15 ate 2 6  oyster beyond small drowning much tasteless gooey sauce Long story short save time money else where  <EOR> I've eaten more times care admit   bad but great either   I'd give 3 5 if allowed half stars   good thing ton TVs they'll change channel game your choice if isn't already within your view  <EOR> Great place everyone very nice attentive  Clam chowder hamburgers delicious  Special Thanks manager Patrick your kindness awesome service he above beyond  definitely come back again!  <EOR> This only decent place eat Rio stayed last week January ate restaurant three times    The place just sounds all american food main focus aged steaks which didn't try since didn't much money spend  food alone going pricey no matter where eat   The service great server very attentive  bean dip couple times last night found hair dip lost appetite but nice enough pay dip  Cesar salads good shrimp  nights mini corn dogs fries which also delicious    Each soda refill isn't free which found when bill  But besides everything great   I would recommended others eat if Rio but don't think back since probably won't stay Rio again other reasons  <EOR> I LOVE PLACE  husband staying 10 days house hunting big fans strip dining thanks overwhelming prices super fancy food which nice but every day   However place tastey large portions comfortable atmosphere although prices bit high worth IMO  front more bar like tables bar booths video gambling bar tv's sports if you're into that  favorite back part spacious booths gorgeous fireplace also very quiet!

I ate cobb salad grilled chicken thousand island dressing side  Meanwhile chicken caesar salad looked pretty nice liked large flat piece baked parmesan came salad  companion said tasted good too   This restaurant definitely better some other places ate Rio gets props being conveniently located tower room being open 24 hours  Most basic dishes burgers salads sandwiches $10 12 range    But nothing culinarily amazing  Service adequete  Diners nearby table friendly too  But maybe because eating cute friends  <EOR> This place gets big points mostly fast service once seated fact gave three different kinds french fries below chicken strips!  We wandered over place fairly inexpensive burger great evening seeing Penn Teller theatre Rio   almost midnight Vegas which equivalent 3 30 afternoon real world there's 20 minute wait table two   first bit irritated because feet still killing all sightseeing did day but plopped ourselves some nearby slots while waited     The food great prices great too!  companion very satisfied burger chicken strips moist tender fantastic   mentioned before basket fries beneath chicken mix regular fries curly fries criss cut fries   Heaven!  They pretty decent menu good prices especially Vegas plenty distraction form 20+ plasmas showing everything sports news something random   only drawbacks lack favorite soda alternative raspberry iced tea since RIGHT casino floor rather loud  <EOR> Went simply because hungry late didn't want leave hotel Rio   very pleasantly surprised  first glance prices seem little high but portions huge!

The All American Bar Grill good place Rio lunch providing you're Rio already don't want stuff yourself buffet lines  If another casino you'll very likely find another place comparable food  <EOR> Stopped Wednesday 7 30pm dinner 3 us  asked if could table back hostess asked why would want that? politely replied front loud there's smoke nearby slot machine players  She said she doubted table but picked 3 menus walked back came back front then walked back hostess station without giving answer  She put down menus started helping server  asked table she turned he back face completely away restaurant  I pretty surprised she rude over simple request table  three seen each other 6 months hoping quieter spot talk  Well All American Grill now place we'll encourage all 107 000 coming WSOP stay away when getting food Rio  <EOR> Here trade show decided burger  cooked perfectly bartender awesome  Definitely going eat again <EOR> A burger joint Vegas  expect? I'd probably give 2 5 given opportunity but better 2    Get buffalo chicken sliders   good deal cause they're easily splittable amongst group  waffle fries tasty  Cajun Burger good HUGE  Way more enough two people  rule would order entree two people   The beer extraordinarily overpriced  But Vegas right?  The service friendly but touch inept  Took very long time single glass water  food beer before water  But server very friendly all all good experience  <EOR> We relative visiting holidays Spain decided bring AAB G experience traditional American food  experience poor even going spend lot time review  But highlights low lights contributed very poor experience  Seated bar even though 6 y o  AAB G meatloaf grilled served BBQ sauce it  eats meatloaf that? Americans  ordered Cobb salad no onions ranch dressing came onions no blue cheese blue cheese dressing BTW Cobb Salad made iceburg lettuce  If wanted iceburg lettuce would ordered Wedge Salad  never saw waitress food delivered even let know possibly received someone else's Cobb Salad grilled jumbo asparagus burned tried cover pouring lots kosher salad ground black peppercorn it if you're into charbroiled asparagus might you  Skip place  if stick burger beer  <EOR> New York strip amazing!

Call 911! If just said someone call 911 no would because no would know responsible   Waiting tables matter life death course but same rules apply     By way waiters' uniform polo shirt wide horizontal stripes   shirts similar ones host Blue's Clues used wear every show   that?  exactly most slimming outfit it?
