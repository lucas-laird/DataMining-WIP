boyfriend ordered chicken piccata  He loved chicken dish  liked Banzino fish dish but thought could improved  give plenty fish though  Fish cooked well but tasted little fishy still fish clean taste  Didn't care sides came under fish although arugula salad underneath refreshing  would come back eat outside patio because looked very cozy nice  <EOR> Bottiglia solid spot brunch Henderson  dinner don't remember being memorable  food done well but Bottiglia place where I'd return again lies sauces syrups  Where food lacks creating truly novel experience Bottiglia service ambiance atmosphere  restaurant generally good both brunch dinner but lacks something would truly stand shine  far all come aesthetically pleasing sauces syrup great   I've come twice brunch last most recent time cinnamon bread pudding starter pancakes cinnamon butter bourbon maple syrup two eggs any style everything bagel    The cinnamon bread pudding pretty good  your run mill bread pudding some decorative edible flowers top  thousand times better sauce  honestly think sauce really ties all together bread pudding something I'd want order again again  price okay  definitely something extra I'd order if feeling particularly zesty weekend  know channeling inner 'treat yo self' la Parks Rec   The pancakes fluffy done well  Again made much better bourbon maple syrup  flavorful rich lent nice helping hand making pancakes average slightly above average    Overall feel Bottiglia knows cook bake things well but true star food lies sauces  sauces small bit creativity lives  <EOR> Made reservation seated right away  Greeted live music man guitarist lady singer  Sat expansive marble bar  Received professional attentive service Alyssa    The bread  *smile* French bread olive bread cheesy cracker bread sticks honey butter appeared immediately   Our order came quickly stopped devouring yummy bread display  short rib plate seemed ever expanding soft fork tender chunk meat  shareable  comes 3 riccotta potato balls  Creamylicious  Its served brown gravy reduction   The cauliflower side beautifully browned pine nuts could actually taste  asparagus topped bread crumbs edible down base   So full couldn't dessert  <EOR> Bottiglia perfect spot date unforgettable  food ambiance resturant truly culinary masterpiece  When first arriving open waiting area furnished low seating couches chairs next bar  overall feel resturant modern upscale yet cozy welcoming    For food enjoyed charcuterie board consisting pecorino teahive cheeses accompanied prosciutto picante meats along calamari appetizer  meat cheese all freshly shaven served side truffle honey when honey spooned onto cheese mouthful sweet savory flavor  calamari perfectly cooked seasoned well  slight kick spice end each bite which quiet enjoyed   For entrees tried chicken parm rigatoni sausage  chicken parm huge portion definitely money's worth  crispy outside perfect transition juicy center which always left wanting another bite  chicken parm served San Marzano tomato sauce which light fresh if came direct Italy  rigatoni cooked perfectly paired well fresh sausage  requested dish spicy since am fan spice let down  heat each bite lingered mouth but overpowering rather left wanting more more    For dessert panna cotta fresh strawberries berry sauce  creaminess sweetness panna cotta balanced tart yet sweet berry sauce  If looking nice night your significant other then bottiglia best choice <EOR> Over years wished GVR would more restaurants since location convenient finally happening  Bottiglia isn't just restaurant great restaurant    Reservations seem must  first attempt come without reservation booked entire evening  time made reservation Open Table 6 00 dinner  restaurant pretty full time well   The

 When first looked dessert menu intrigued any item but pass dessert  Dessert Sampler seemed good item husband share option  Everything sampler amazing very good deal amount dessert  Tiramisu best ever lovely flavor  Strawberry Limoncello Pannacotta best item plenty lemon zest strawberries strawberry compote  donuts light perfectly textured nice lemon curd  if wasn't enough two delicious chocolate dipped shortbread cookies  Everything plate great dessert   The thing most worried trying restaurant service  terrible experiences service Hank's worried GVR curse  all  waiter attentive water glasses continuously filled all food came well timed manner  waiter did more tables wrapping took little time check but he apologized without saying anything  based experience don't any concerns service   There only thing detracted experience deal breaker if wasn't one off  Nobody else mentioned hopefully one off  When first arrived music reasonable volume  30 minutes later turned loud husband screaming talk each other  When live musician arrived didn't any better  restaurant just doesn't seem proper venue music loud   Overall absolutely loved food service design restaurant  <EOR> Tried enter building parking lot entrance since raining  Only find doors locked hostesses just looking wet  Finally came over informed open ten more minutes  When asked if could come sit bar cocktail while

She did offer take rock bump charge off nor any other incentive come back     This very deceptive pricing practice   caution anyone planning eating look other questionable practices Bottiglia Cucina Enoteca   certainly giving them another opportunity  <EOR> If want step away Vegas scene place go  food emasculate portions more enough plenty left over take home  service always prompt GM Javier amazing    The only thing resulted 4 5 stars desert quality  drinks appetizers main course every thing exceeds expectations  Sadly when dessert came expected something hold previous course standards    I definitely coming back since loved food  <EOR> I can't over aesthetically pleasing restaurant is!!!!
