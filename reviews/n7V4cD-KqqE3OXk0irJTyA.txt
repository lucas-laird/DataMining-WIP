Although don't DJ dance floor Insert Coins still good time   I also liked full bar drinks weren't overpriced  bowling alley also looked very intriguing but alas didn't opportunity bowl occasion    I think great option kids adults alike! Game On! <EOR> Amazing place  leave son hours  Last several times scored Groupon deal $20 all day pass  bargain  Love fact even play basketball toss skee ball pass  three hours basketball tournament grabbed dinner then came back another two hours  Awesome place awesome deal  <EOR> This place shell its former self  Game works used great place gaming   came son because remember teenager place being shit its former location Vegas but now location just isn't used be  son fun regardless but just thrown off basic its become  <EOR> Thank Shana your awesome service helping surprise cake daughter thank you     <EOR> We company party success! Everyone Seemed enjoy themselves especially children  Just want give shout Ron Arenas Manager all your help function crew! Awesome job! <EOR> Reading throughout reviews past year  Games broken still fixed  talked multiple managers game techs guess just refuse fix games  Terrible arcade management   also doubled ticket prices  most high end items Xbox PS4 iPads   Shitty arcade would reccomend    If broken game just turn machine off machines be  broken weeks weeks forever  Literally   <EOR> Pretty cool spot night friends day family  tons games bowling food drinks for adults   few times each time course kids left very happy and tired thankfully   games tickets which traded prizes end well room full computer video games  Games everyone!   They few pretty good deals games only but took advantage unlimited play hour entree    There some miscommunication between purchase deal sent around 3 different people bit frustrating  Only other downfall service restaurant  waited almost 10 minutes before anyone came greeted drinks then another 30 minutes food  master chef but don't think nachos cheese pizza burger takes long prepare  Also server less attentive  Nonetheless know people don't food its just added incentive while play games!!!!   Cool spot again drink play games maybe dine another nearby establishment though  <EOR> It's nice see Gameworks back Vegas since remember going old location strip  comparison new location ton newer but also smaller  nice see everything isn't falling apart all games clean actually work!  I'm sure though why made restaurant area large because Gameworks usually arcade first restaurant second  multiple locations around country all them much much larger gaming area restaurant  restaurant also ton wasted space could've used accommodate games doesn't feel cramped inside when you're playing  only thing restaurant TVs projector screens all around  great place watch sports!  The games themselves decent although whole lot seemed spark interest  Most them pretty expensive costing approximately 7 12 credits  Each credit 25 cents unless buy large dollar amounts such $50 100   Overall Gameworks Town Square good place hang kill some time but wouldn't place I'd visit frequently  <EOR> So always fan concept GameWorks since visited Seattle years ago  whole different arcade games some throwbacks current games interactive games EA sport area mention indoor bowling alley  forget little ones games earn tickets then redeem them later  whole bar restaurant area something but fan same time  nice offer good diversity food your basic bar menu grub all deep fried off grill  location GameWorks Town Square Mall strip  fact serve beers pitchers option!  fact tons televisions all over place bar restaurant area sports  fan bar area  hardly feels bar area lounge around relax friends  Your right smack next entrance see people coming going kids running around  could good thing free entertainment  LOL  service awful  two separate occasions first time  sure if he bartender bar back  guy cleaning glasses working once did he acknowledge me  literally standing front face whole time  Hi  Someone you  other two bartenders just whatever attention just drink  bar no personality feel counter top middle open space  restaurant area itself much better personality feels more cafeteria setting feel just open space tables couple booths outside  Service times it  fair came GameWorks friends wedding reception night cap together  Everyone showed random times  did fabulous job no reservations rearrange tables we helped moved them did ended over 30 peeps spread over three four tables  Well done    I some friends food  tried pretzel bites  ok  cheese sauce tasted can  nachos solid  loaded pretty much everything  Really all food saw coming table looked good    If playing tourist GameWorks place might stop again  If want throw back days 808 going Tilt Fun Factory local peeps would appreciate shout out would GameWorks  food drinks honest many other great spots Town Square would skip part GameWorks  <EOR> There bowling here  bad enough space families sit around hang out  downfall no working bar within bowling area  Made difficult everyone look belongings children while ordering food drinks  lol  Enjoy ugly neon shoes     I did however pretzels spicy cheese dip    Highlight photobooth   Spend forever personalizing your photos   Fun! <EOR> The games lots fun but food terrible service worse  Come games elsewhere food <EOR> By far worst arcade experiences ever Las Vegas local born raised here! would say 30% machines didn't even work jipped 250 ticket jackpot only ended giving 20 tickets bigger version ball drop game    Half basketball games row order  cashier rung rude didn't give card back right away  think forgot turn A C because sauna there    I would recommend coming all  I'd say circus circus pinball hall fame Dave Busters even Excalibur arcade better call because arcade opinion     If could give 0 stars definitely would  <EOR> This place absolutely atrocious!!!  seemed arcade graveyard  50 60% games didn't work didn't accept card just plain on  saw least 3 different occasions where 2 person shooter game only 1 gun    sat down another 2 person game start button only worked player  calibrations off couple games shooting far left crosshairs all way over right    basketball games sad deflated basketballs pieces ball literally falling off  football game did work again sad deflated footballs  However did see Tom Brady playing game those deflated footballs really sent over top high score  place literally biggest joke saddest excuse arcade ever seen  Las Vegas    your stuff together!

must say employees seemed pleased changes customer used come regular when less kids activities effort regular again especially if bring back Groupon deal which F B Bowling money making machine! <EOR> I chuckled when saw place categorized Yelp under Gastropubs   pretty generous   I GameWorks big group dinnertime outing  didn't any special rates just Dine Play combo  always available  $14 99 time cards loaded hour ten specially labeled items menu  also possible $21 99 two hour card but nobody chose option   Like some others Fish Chips because normally $14 50 which almost price Dine Play one hour deal  wasn't expecting much but cod fillets reasonably flavorful  unfortunate seemed little heavy rather fluffy batter wasn't crispy I'd hoped  chose waffle fries side rather mashed potatoes salad neither which really called chips  fries decently seasoned generally decent crisp some fluffiness but better   I also sampled GameWorks Nachos normally $12 steak +$3   suppose meat could construed ground steak instead ground beef  Nothing dish anything special  even prefer TGI Friday's nachos over this   I should note handled service rather massive table 20+ people just fine constant replacement water pitchers although condiments notably ketchup fries bit delayed   As arcade only partook round DDR Supernova 2 because I'd handed off card friend while playing pool $13 hr Sun Thu 4pm close but think weren't strict hour   pool tables cues seemed decent enough although someone noted rails seemed bit dead  Anyway saw friends play arcade nice selection shooting games air hockey crazy souped Pac Man inspired version air hockey some rhythm games some racing games  seen worse arcades sure   I should note all TVs set Monday Night football game audio available seemingly everywhere building  fun casual fans vocal Cowboys fans alike  also football game day food promo believe $35 large 16 one topping pizza 35 wings pitcher soda or +$5 pitcher beer one hour game cards $5 per person  also noticed offer $10 unlimited gaming Thursdays 5pm close immediately wished social taken place then  Oh well   I don't foresee myself coming back very soon but GameWorks some potential appeal arcade gaming  Just don't expect much food you'll fine  <EOR> Okay may big most expected but use space given  heard expanding since back added several more games along fixing broken games  Although may expected still happy going Gameworks playing games   The service pretty good except did find annoying when barista bowling area would rather texting phone flirting guy behind bar serving other customers  ask bowling attendants drink  understand slow but would nice if someone looked occasionally  But rest staff very nice helpful  <EOR> We very disappointed   restaurant looks just temporary spot  failed much spot other paint walls place chairs tables   few TVA  games    much more see   The food terrible considering only other family would think could better job  caesars salad soaked dressing soggy  chicken okay  husbands fish chips dripping old oil   But kids seemed chicken strips French fries  think only thing okay calamari aioli dip   The rides games extremely over priced  However  least service excellent  Laura waitress great made sure never ask refill  She bright spot   We don't plans back   Rather wait til travel place Dave busters  <EOR> our family  groupon $20 play all day unlimited pass  friend POGO pass use also  thought going fun way waste day all disappointed! normally Dave Buster's blast! 50%  Gameworks games  broken aren't working properly all times going Dave Buster's only seen game down repaired within couple days  hour half played games could bored   didnt even bother  food because if cant keep video games good shape cant imagine kitchen looks like!! only staff member nice Troy Darkride XD  <EOR> Yeah     So everyone else am very disappointed location  excited also! thought would great addition Town Square really hoping could live previous version Gameworks Strip   least little  opinion however does not  even close  Which understandable actually  Las Vegas Strip Location fantastic many ways  If  Town Square location could even 1 4 previous version could great    I agree first foremost place should games  also believe really failed design space far games go  appear lot cool games though crammed into corner  layout cool  clustered uncomfortable walk through when many players around    Staff all awesome very accommodating say  now   I walked around bit saw space back appears private events maybe? few empty rooms LCD TV's mounted walls  don't know but I'd rather see filled games maybe some themed rooms   another thing   space stark boring mentioned previously layout kinda whack    The bar specifically even restaurant serves alcohol should something kids walk through  difficult fix  should divider wall between those areas  couple spaces divided off over under 21 patrons  understand Gameworks draw many under 21 people but  Las  Vegas huge market adult kids! stands very uncomfortable sit bar  Your back walkway kids going just cool opinion  even looks uncomfortable bartenders servers serving there    I know people reading employees managers owners guests alike agree disagree every range emotion available reviews negative  easy opening new place  Going everyone knew high expectations    I can't even into much else without writing full website subject but feel Gameworks needs serious overhaul already  really look forward some major changes hope come sooner later  occasionally drop help support that   but cannot see myself spending money games until those credits drop some form unlimited play offered past   say $20 10pm until close adults something kids weekends?   I wish luck Gameworks! responsible great many happy fun memories earlier years! want part something great again! <EOR> Took 6 year old some kid fun  better gameworks use strip near mgm  cleaner seems bigger maybe its just set better but its really nice  video game room date video gsme consoles computers  Very cool cause its kids lounge area where chill play video games couches sit computer desk chair play games there  Also small bowling alley  small but price pretty neat  Only few dollars per game shoes  All games fun  daughter really enjoyed ski ball most  Some games more credits others little bit rip off way kept track your tickets made wonder because its all card daughter played good hour only ened small amount tickets made wonder track many ticketd per game  But fact daughter having fun made even car  She 500 tickets entired 3 hrs there  She 3 small toys prize area  lady said she 20 tickets over prize she picked but she just let dsughter small little cup she wanted  very nice customer service   mean figured if im spending $30 $50 6 yr old play games fact let walk small free gift shouldnt big deal since spent more money games toys  Lol  toy worth less  guess you're just pretty much paying foe experience toys  Thats better way saying it  sure bsck again sometime   She liked she liked it  its right town square too  nice location  Convenient also smart because probably lot teenagers kids cause its right near movie theater town square pretty busy most time  <EOR> Got groupon all day pass $10  play card  Many types games all day card allowed play couple hours eat lunch come back another hour half  much better losing slots  Came home Domo dressed bee  <EOR> Kids love place but allot games working   Upgraded games maintenance desperately needed  sure if old games them trying Retro cheap     Restaurant empty because food just okay service less desirable    It's average but potential  <EOR> Gave place 2  does deserve 2 because where located being fact Town Square second home  hours shopping kiddos deserve fun    Other that     new game works super boring enough games kids bored 20 mins into playing    FOOD crap  don't even option getting whole pizza old Game Works MGM  Only pan size personal pizza $14  Nachos string shredded chicken which no taste hardly anything them    SERVICE  Well wasn't great  call order since first time location lot questions menu she little irritated questions  then finally ordered  2 pepperoni pizzas chicken nachos    She told if added $3 more dollars each items would free play card  would've perfect buying more play cards  did add $3 special card play but she didn't mention until won least 10 000 points games wouldn't included dinner play cards    Not only did server place ruin dinner but made kiddos cry getting any prizes they've earned those games    NEVER AGAIN BACK  <EOR> It's basically smaller version Dave Busters  comes bar small dining area    Food food okay  Pricing alright portions get  wouldn't eat again  would just grab food somewhere plaza    Location Great area located right next movie theater  best both worlds  Teenagers kids adults all enjoy movie then come afterwards    Games Variety games play  winning tickets just playing multiplayer  Most games date new  still some your old school arcade games well  small bowling alley located inside cool ride inside well extra money  even those motion rides where seat yourself   Overall bad but still feels missing something  <EOR> Ordered pepperoni meathead pizza  Server Sahara awesome very attentive  Food average expected   Great place kids play fun when gets hot out  Better chuck e cheese far  draw back quite few games aren't working which bummer when only but several others playable  <EOR> Offered yelp check free app purchase 2 entrees  Game Works would honor fine play combos   This seems silly dine play combos cost more entrees  understand stacking promotions but game works business selling both food games  wanted buy both offering  doesn't seem promotion its any everyday offer  <EOR> Just reopened since old closed mgm This place would cool distraction night gambling They redemption games some pinball bowling I'm sure bringing kids here <EOR> I'm gamer but enjoy fun atmosphere drinking yummy cocktails trying new things which exactly GameWorks Town Square offered  Being new Vegas wasn't familiar GameWorks prior visit expect it pleasantly surprised all offer    The facility itself HUGE! tons tons games play favorite frog log jump Terminator one!! also ski ball basket ball shooting game  those faithful gamers even entire room set online computer games where play til your hearts content while sipping cocktails  favorite part full bowling lanes!!

Why pay much money all points if everything shut down? Ridiculous   Lastly if your children play enough games earn enough points certain prize want don't let them excited  couple friends spent just enough money win enough tickets LEGO pillow they've eyeing while  soon reached 1 500 ticket mark redeem prize  Then employees told them don't even LEGO pillows stock  Though few different colors them hanging walls   I wish could just open reasonably priced arcade  now sticking Pinball Hall Fame  <EOR> This quality expected come GameWorks   *Purchased all day pass errors reading card card replaced   *The advertised 24 hour unlimited play Groupon card only works 14 hours   *The staff very young inexperienced customer service   *Beware many games malfunction issues  three occasions gone GameWorks multiple machines found error messages  <EOR> What great place take kids couple hours while Vegas!
