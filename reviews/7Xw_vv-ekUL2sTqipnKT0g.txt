The review mostly service which lack better word TERRIBLE   waitress sauntered over while chewing gum if she doing favor took orders but did write anything down   She ask few times repeat while still getting drink wrong   Mind only two should such feat   orders came wrong wrong side dish but did mention anything point deal anymore  Overall she seemed more focused serving groups guys seated all around then any other customer  <EOR> I've very much wings beer phase moment excited try BWW recent Vegas trip  Compared Wingstop wings much better they're tender juicy yet still crispy crunchy outside many more flavors choose from  Caribbean jerk favorite 5 tried tons heat flavor Azian zing coming close second  garlic parmesan bit dry but did bring little cup sauce side    Not sure if all locations but many big screen TVs different games around room  Great place game day  Also only place gives more ranch could ask for!

Whether management just don't know where start should giving some constructive coaching to  most recent experience earlier week co workers just meh  starters quoted wait time table ended fact actually doubling  Once seated team leads shift managers came over introduce himself another server which whom he explained would also helping him  wasn't case though because never saw again until he left  When came getting drinks ordered all browsed through menu cocktails decided top shelf long islands  Now am long island drinker co worker actually ordered same thing  When drinks arrived could already tell drink made suppose be  color long island shouldn't look water hint brown  Anyways sipped drinks course all could taste sour mix  brought attention server even asked pre made mix drink actual hand made pour bartender  He replied No made fresh beg differ   know difference sent back no desire order anything else bar because evident whoever working night didn't know doing  When drink situation solved moved food order now  when felt things would better  tables wings dropped off again noticed another request wasn't fulfilled which wings tossed extra sauce brought just extra sauce pretty much said pour same thing  Already annoyed whatever whole meal ready just go  When bill came again issue because manager first server now off didn't properly promo wings Tuesday wing special smh  outta won't back   stick Warm Springs Durango location Hualapai area   would think location being close strip service would tip top spotty    <EOR> Where start review   while since visited but still need share this   To start place packed NBA playoffs   place absolutely freezing cold very easy   spoke manager issue he stated he contacted corporate but sent someone fix AC   After ordering drinks mother received wine glass which hot but least clean     We ordered food surprise stuff came wrong   fries ordered table came lukewarm best   When brought manager he stated he surprised since came 170* fryer or whatever temp he quoted us   Eventually fries back came piping hot next time dropped off   The salad asked dressing side but salad   When explained manager he asked taste dressing see was   Instead fixing issue he decided keep talking way long   He finally took salad back when came salad complete different chicken but least dressing side   salad did take way long come back well   When ordered wings requested ranch side which didn't come until asked another couple times it   surprised when bill came charged ranch   Lastly manager very kind before he actually took back   He trying place blame food cold salad made wrong   He should've taken responsibility right then instead taking forever take back food corrected   Needless say worst BWW certainly going back one  <EOR> Mango habanero sauce business! Watched NFL draft Cavs Bulls game while visiting Vegas [again]  wasn't crowded all server great   I really wish they'd open San Diego would fare very well considering love sports bars here  <EOR> This place WORST headass place ever worst customer service worst food  bye <EOR> This first time Buffalo Wild Wings location am never going back  service worst ever experienced any restaurant  When asked server explanation happy hour menu she told look menu myself waited impatiently until ordered  asked if could half half flavors wings she said yes ordered two different flavors lemon pepper mango habernero husband ordered two flavors medium sized order wings  ended getting four full orders chicken wings! husband could finish 60 chicken wings between two but felt bad because prepared already  Another server noticed did want agreed take chicken wings come back originally ordered  husband snacked appetizer half hour until different server finally served food again  Again messed order gave two entirely different flavors did order  didn't want complain again because if scared might something food because much complained thus far  point didn't even want eat just wanted pay home  original sever finally comes back hour asks what's wrong rude tone close walking out  first time complaining shit service because first over charged then attempted giving wrong orders??? still tipped payed but place worth anyone's money  <EOR> Mango Habanero hit but service sucked ass!  bunch workers standing around empty tables yet took forever seated orders taken refills food bill!  They open 24 hours though!  give them another try next time Vegas  <EOR> This first experience Buffalo Wild Wings nicest thing say great commercials   won't give 1 because onion rings good wing choices made good    Bottom line if you're mood wings suggest going Wings Things  <EOR> I waited 25 minutes drink  Horrible service  Bad worst experience Bdubs  <EOR> I've lunch happy hour UFC late night  Wings always delicious  Getting sauce side way go   way try many different sauces want  Spicy garlic mango habanero Asian zing favorites  Don't wings?

The menu doesn't indicate many wings is    You traditional boneless fried wings  Snack 5 small 10 idea  all increments 5  Your wings include side which found little annoying  <EOR> I hate bring B Wild down notch since formerly owned shares company totally bought into hype   However say really disappointed   place B Wild competition places TGI Fridays Chili's BJ's   particular fan Chili's felt place should wow beyond any particular experience Chili's   Chili's decent but heartless chain    B Wild supposed happy super cool bar grill chain but gives Mom Pop type experience   First issue seating   felt if enough boothes many standalone tables   Perhaps layout issue even fire issue but think bar grill should just ton boothes   more comfortable beer wings   Secondly food just really snuff   fries sort soggie little bit cold   real problem when serving shoe string fries   wing sauces fine spicy garlic Asian    actually Asian really good but thought wings little tiny side   Plus $12 49 18 would okay if wings little bit bigger   just did look impressive sitting couple fry trays either   burger meat okay but didn't option meat medium little burnt   know ordered cajun style but come on!  buns good but cold   Finally service needed little work   food took long while come might explain cold fries    Then some things forgotten side blue cheese wings salad   Finally know kind slow but servers standing around talking eachother rather watching tables   Maybe just off day    maybe better game day    maybe should pitcher beer   !  I suppose should picky bar grill but really concept appreciate corporate management company   hope some improvements if issue systematic   If just place then hope manager regulates location better  <EOR> I come reason reason only 60 cent wings Thursday   If wasn't special I'd probably never step food inside Bdubs   food ambiance service average best  Other wings nothing else really worth getting off menu  burgers sandwiches pretty meh overpriced get  Fortunately wings delicious good selection sauces dry rubs along them    I guess place watch sports but always feel image  projectors washed never quite hear whats going on  $6 7 beer more would want pay place Bdubs  location particular gets lot traffic especially tourists its just mile south Strip  Service decent if aren't busy but expect wait while table if its packed  <EOR> Why bother coming here  waited 45min take out  hell going on? all rude  Worst bww ever  <EOR> This BWW location visit most often  pretty convenient coworkers visit work considering work strip    This location stays fairly busy especially during special sporting events  Currently traditional Tuesday's boneless Thursday's wings priced 70 cents each  coworkers typically come during two days busy then too  usually big groups least wait 15 minutes but typically wait good 30 minutes  good thing don't require your entire party sat if person ahead your party reserve your seats would recommend that    A downside being consistently busy servers lot handle sometimes take while take your order come back check you   problem consistently came across but once see looks can't really blame them but problem still there  food just delicious any other BWW location if craving wings cheesecake bites just great restaurant! <EOR> The only good thing place fried pickles   service bad but   can't blame waitress that   place full she only running around   took 10 15 mins when sat down anyone ask wanted drink almost 20 25 min wait food  When wings cold dry   More staff service would probably better  <EOR> Mediocrity everywhere you're better off eating some wings Sonic's instead   The staff doesn't care customer really shows quality food service  <EOR> I don't think returning place   very frustrating when arrive see many empty tables your told wait  should sign   finally seated place order 15 minutes later beer ordered arrived warm might add   wife orders cup ice guessing waiting ice freeze   Because ask 3 times said 3 times   ordered wings 40 minutes arrive but didn't know because no sauce any wings   Avoid Courtney all cost she forgets you   Definitely won't back  <EOR> What terrible place eat  6 month old baby your allowed stroller dinning room which made eating difficult  table way anything having stroller would big deal  Since son asleep wake real pleasant deal that  ordered buffalo chicken sandwich which took almost 40 minutes brought blue cheese one  Girl said kitchen screwed but ticket said blue cheese  8 tables place full must more cook kitchen  would back  <EOR> I really wings specifically because sauce choice  favorites Mango Habenero spicy Wild spicy Caribbean Jerk medium Teriyaki mild Spicy Garlic medium also pretty good   The chips cheese cajun seasoning delicious   I almost always sit bar bartenders great  Dani Michelle favorites but guys weekend swing grave always great too  <EOR> Came work yesterday morning   good thing BW3 Vegas compared home    24 hours! only 2 other guys  some naked tenders veggie boat while caught Sportscenter  Honey BBQ medium sauce way go!

They recently renovated location more open feel also dark used to    If come during prime hours should expecting lengthy wait time if plan sit bar     Besides wings being focal point joint suggest others try burgers  nacho burger angry orchard chicken burgers die for   Also try seasonal beers!  The staff also very friendly haven't bad experience staff!  They try your food fast but most times backed up  normally wait half hour food out  restaurant business sure improve productivity but leave them !  4 stars food staff 1 star lengthy wait times!  Will back again! <EOR> Buffalo Wild Wings somewhere usually choose go     ended today default coworker's choice! ordered boneless wing lunch combo wings average but fries cold! service decent   Overall ok experience  <EOR> I feel bit odd reviewing Buffalo Wild Wings but foreign friends always want when Vegas always location     If you've Bdubs before pretty standard fair lots tvs wings other fried foods   only real difference open 24 hours which nice     Not surprisingly if going big sporting event very busy especially if UFC fight   probably hour more early and or tip someone heavily seat   Best things mini corn dogs wings   If order just those very pleasant meal   Sauces depend your taste spice tolerance but normally Spicy Garlic Asian Zing   My two British friends routinely spend 100 dollars between them pretty sure if anyone ever decided open London would printing money  <EOR> Love coming just hang chill food good service  good time spent deserts amazing brother loves lob board beers    !!!!! <EOR> Service server flustered many tables felt burden when asked refill celery sticks    mango spicy very spicy good garlic asian spicy jerk chicken spicy all!!  Overall very good buffalo wings though could just throw more celery sticks   2X celery refills =$1 20 seriously???  Beware  charged extra celery sticks even though stalk celery less buck each  <EOR> This Plan B when restaurant choice overbooked  nice seated within minutes  sports book ambience awesome!
