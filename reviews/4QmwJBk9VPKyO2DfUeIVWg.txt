Dropping F bombs drooling sisters leg being little touchy liking  takes 35 min food  food made incorrectly  She profusely apologizes but sitting last 53 minutes waiting replacement  packed all I'd understand if body body but not  order Spanish cook myself since drunk server couldn't  She offered free drinks said  owner didn't give shit food drinks all care poker machines  Asked speak manager told the motherf***er isn't site  Never return definitely left bad Vegas taste mouth  <EOR> Ken bartender hates job patrons  He greets smug face indifferent attitude  came warning friends already tried open thinking maybe something happened between them but no   same indifferent attitude  felt bad tipped anyway  Maybe dude just bad day maybe why haven't years because service  El Dorado is  <EOR> Today spouse wake cocktail long night travels  sat empty bar 15 mins waiting approached   Bartender KEN saw ignored us  sat while longer waiting he counted money  And still no service   Avoid coming all costs  several other establishments Las Vegas area no wonder ken works local gaming bar   customer service skills mediocre some obviously what's hindered working likes bellagio Wynn ect  <EOR> Great place come late night strip! place great atmosphere laid back locals plenty space comfy seating interesting 'americana' decor   I really enjoyed server friendliness group!

Personally chips w guac best  guac delicious tastes should like ripe fresh avocados     One great thing even bar place REALLY smokey   Overall decent bar  continue pop now then when area want drinks small bite  <EOR> This place great happy hour special!

I admit previous reviews made cautious but took swing anyway In summary   it sucks <EOR> Your late night server whom guy white exact he act liked racist he snatched menu asked few things he just looked liked stupid ! He also just rude didn't even leave tip think he really needs fix attitude towards black people ! cool ! <EOR> Tommy rockers always place you're done working can't find those places open during day  only bar but also restaurant  Years years ago used bar restaurant strip club  Just everybody knows when strip club happy portion business now gone   The bartenders super nice though sometimes busy hard attention of  There's always cool events going Tommy rockers some nights busy hard find spot but  want people actually having fun hanging out   There smoking allowed inside bar non smokers bit annoying when your food somebody sits next lights up   As far food menu full choices  possible healthy food such Mr  Feelgood chicken sandwich   also pick typical bar food well   Prices very reasonable most things coming between $7 $12  <EOR> The food average service okay   really smoky inside takes away experience  <EOR> Once upon time place rocked     always packed people great vibe   Then inexplicably became topless strip club    wth?  Where all partiers wanted sing along Tommy band go?  knows   Now no longer topless strip club but lost momentum once had   Which bad because really fun place meet friends few drinks shoot some pool some food sing along band   Well really sing along but bands much fun think Jimmy Buffet style couldn't help but sing along your drunk friends   I recently stopped joint see now   walked into place just didn't feel same   same building much changed inside bar but missing people made fun   replaced other people but just didn't seem right   Beer left   Despite losing luster momentum place best places during weekend Jimmy Buffet performing Vegas   Although Jimmy opened joint Flamingo many Parrot Heads still come here   Before Margaritaville opened Parrot Head heaven during those weekends   Will return?
