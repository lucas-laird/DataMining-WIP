Sinigang bland kare kare also bland    I'm disappointed name doesn't hold its reputation all!  understand most party 15 minutes late but still isn't excuse serve cold ads bland entrees    Its understandable only couple months old but management should've prepared such demand kind chain Las Vegas  town known its culinary trends    Also half restaurant half full yet amount people waiting entrance just ridiculous!  strongly suggest getting things organized because fire hazard people clumped door!   You should also train better bar servers bartenders  gentleman taken drink order didn't even know tap meant when asked u guys tap? He straight said  Sir tap? Tap water? WTF that? He also did know operate POS system much beverage was? Kudos other server assisted bartender    Overall wise back  But please remind kitchen afraid little salt pepper  if your kitchen staff wants learn use proper seasoning?  Let know ? thank you  <EOR> What love most Max's its consistency   No matter day time day quality food always very good   Consistency something don't find much Filipino restaurants least experience   tend order same things over over again pancit canton adobo laing fingerlings course fried chicken   Every time quality food always same   thing don't recommend leche flan blech! terrible!!  Regarding service staff super nice super friendly hostess server busboys   Just quality food quality service also wonderfully consistent   servers always attentive quick ask if need anything   tried bunch Filipino restaurants Las Vegas but settled Max's go to spot even though don't live all close  <EOR> So while ago some family dinner  woman desk said would an20 minute wait but seated within ten minutes  No problem    We order food drinks wait  Wait    wait   wait some more  When checked phone noticed waiting 40 minutes food  asked waiter much longer food would he said soon  Twenty minutes later finally food   We excited food only find cold  flavor good but when you're starving wait hour your food expect standard  fact cold kinda put all bad mood  Especially when people sitting next just came food before us! Really annoying   So food good but don't come if you're hungry because you'll wait long time  staff polite apologetic long wait  even little free dessert because waited long    Overall I'd probably come back because taste food  should give place try if you're willing wait  <EOR> To start restaurant way noisy  four COULDN'T hear each other thru whole meal  wait staff worst  Once seated took least 10+minutes before noticed waiter  saw two times more take orders when he gave bill  food no better   Go if loud noise crappie service lackluster food  <EOR> This place satisfied cravings no other Filipino Bistro  can Luv luv food Servers very efficient Prices reasonable So perfect taste  <EOR> Hope improve long line  Food ok authentic taste buds     But employees nice especially server  <EOR> This graceful 4 stars only cause Filipino nice quick spot close grab some memorable home cooked Filipino dishes other give 3  food decent but times gone consider hit miss place  renovation interior beautiful shame many people go  sure why could be  Would love see entire menu revamped well more lively staff maybe location change??? knows <EOR> Their combo meals suck don't choice want it  Also chicken adobo sucks  If chicken specialty then why does chicken adobo taste different sauce which also sucks  <EOR> The food customer service great here!!! Try chicken sisig pork sinigang!!'all great!! <EOR> I impressed restaurant! food ordinary but definitely overpriced  server attentive struggled grab attention  He displayed awful attitude towards us  certainly could spent money elsewhere somewhere better  <EOR> I understand just opened wait long but if customers willing try them wait seated served     think then least customer service should pleasant food delicious would receive repeat customers  But family did experience any these  portions small way overpriced  perfectly honest find whole fried chicken made order Pinoy Pinay Restaurant more delicious crispy very flavorful  fact family enjoy Pinoy Pinay 's food better without inflated price  <EOR> I love garlic fried rice!

Now finally located Las Vegas! just try it  establishment very nice upscale lot better most filipino restaurants but food service ok  sisig kare kare which apparently most popular dishes  super bummed find couldn't order since all looking forward to  Other dishes included chicken adobo beef steak pancit bihon palabok sinigang    You also divide section off parts place if you're looking celebrate big party which pretty cool  service good thy very attentive apologetic when certain dishes  However just dish but two   I feel poses problem if you're trying service your customers because expect whatever menu  <EOR> I'm tempted bring down two star review   However chicken crunchy goodness finger lickin' good!   But review waitress Colette   Sweet accommodating she made feel really comfortable when other items Max's Platter did not    So according previous sentence ordered Max's Platter    1   Chicken actually more  2  Rice actually very surprisingly good amount  Some restaurants skimp rice knowing Asian audience order more  But Max's takes care that   3  Pancit salty mine came cold   just gross   4  Random orange 5  Random packaged caramel bar  No thanks don't want eat something wrapped plastic plate    Okay Colette   I told pancit cold  she replaced without hesitation  guess everyone else sucky side lucked out! She checked food replaced told let know if wasn't satisfaction  Which kind wasn't because salty but  okay full anyway    So two things  Chicken Jufran Colette    Have nice Thursday reader  <EOR> I wondering why tummy ached came friends  month ago when friends visited me  craving some filipino food recommended should Max's  home tummy aching s***  Now know why shocking  They dirty dinning rodents dirty equipment nasty   Although food fairly good service though other hand sucks really bad   feels don't really care wasn't even busy night  took them 30 mins just refills  never ever place again  <EOR> I family birthday  food great served time  calamansi juice best Vegas far  staff friendly helpful when friend needed help picking order  oh chicken    very delicious meat falls off bone easily! love lots garlic garlic rice  <EOR> The chicken really delicious  palabok Kare kare excellent  service fast friendly  come back again  <EOR> Love ambiance place because once there's actually nice looking Filipino restaurant    Came family which party 11 split tables but informed ahead time nice  seated within maybe 10 mins waiting wasn't bad  menu doesn't very many options which isn't bad thing but expecting little better quality food kin disappointed  Anyways waiter took orders food came pretty fast    First egg drop looking soup bits corn carrots ham ? spam? alright soup  wasn't impressed since looked something could whipped easily maybe even better  But wasn't bad I'd give 3 5    Then main food comes which order pancit whole chicken kare kare lechon kawali   Pancit 2 5 very strong soy sauce flavor yet wasn't salty  really weird but really didn't could taste strong cheap soy sauce flavor  also very wet  used eating pancit just didn't think great    Max's whole chicken 4 5 nice crispy skin but chicken more dry side  wasn't crazy impressed but did think delicious but price think auntys secret recipe chicken much better  good just good enough come back want more    Kare kare 2 5 meh  served medium bowl looked soup veggies  barely any meat tons sauce soup whatever wanna call it  Again dish didn't really wow any way  just used excess sauce pour top rice  flavor just wasn't me    Lechon kawali 3 5 understand deep fried but really turned off amount oil just sitting place  usually LOVE lechon kawali but man some serious grease fest plate didn't even wanna touch it  two piece but just insanely oily  wish would maybe patted down something before serving plate    The service really great though  waiters fast constantly checked table  Super friendly  other hand food wasn't bad but wasn't best either  admit enjoyed chicken most but would only come back during family togethers  Filipino pride but Filipino food just greasy sometimes! <EOR> Tuesday Feb 24  Came family 5 adults 15 yrs old up And 2 young kids 5 yrs old 6 yrs old  We goin order la carte but saw something menu good 10 people party One full set $159 And half set 77 00 note server just assumed never asked if wanted full set good 10 half set good 5  just ASSumed!
