I wanted give guys second chance because first delivery experience just   meh   Unfortunately much better time spite previous good reviews read   wings barely any sauce pizza almost no sauce alfredo bland caesar salad really caesar all but just tossed salad   really wanted time but alas didn't happen   delivery man very friendly professional but paid way much bland <EOR> Ahh breakfast   What say? love some eggs!  I saw breakfast fries menu decided try it  Took while them bring out  Huge helping fries topped eggs canadian bacon sausage cheese  dash hot sauce even better   Good breakfast option  staying MGM just weren't willing eat $$ breakfas place last day crossed bridge found place  located South Beach marketplace  <EOR> Visited Tropicana intent eating Carla Pellegrino's Bacio but closed  downstairs Pellegrino Pizza Deli beacuse read good review pizza  Then changed mind bought hamburger  Best decision ever made Vegas! didn't tell them wanted burger cooked medium well  size normal 1 4lb  Didn't seem much $6 burger but taste excellent! Fresh lettuce tomatoes grilled bun pickle carrot spears side  French fries would another $4 upgraded $5 onion rings  Another best decision! Big fluffy battered 'rings dipped bbq sauce  All cooked perfectly none burned  basically paid typical $12 casino burger but best fast food meals ever town  Other places want care more burger's size rather falvor  Pellegrino decided emphasize quality over quanity couldn't more satisfied  only drawback alone  While burger normal size basket onion rings large enough shared  almost cried when threw away leftover 'rings but just couldn't eat them all  pizza slices looked normally see home town but course wasn't able taste them  saw other people very delicious looking sandwiches  Bacio supposed open next week little deli definitely made good impression  Staff also nice friendly  Thanks Carla! <EOR> Maybe just unlucky     baked ziti sausage meetballs    garlic bread cold  Noodles over cooked  Food overall very bland  Only meat ball sausage  big but worth $2 each   Fast very friendly delivery though  Its low 2 stars    also didnt parmigiano asked tooth picks  <EOR> Should still  yelp place if incredibly intoxicated while receiving services there???     oh well   To dull pain lack luster RPM consumed quite few drinks empty stomach  3AM desperate food appeared only 24 hour place eat   FOOD Ordered simple cheeseburger onion rings  gonna lie better burgers eaten  Leaning more toward restaurant quality McDonalds  meat grilled charred flavor even used real cheese  bun buttered toasted size comparable n' burger much larger patty  onion rings freshly fried absolutely addicting  friend ate every last bit food  No crumbs found!  SERVICE late night expect pretty bad service  Grave shifts mean deal lot drunkards causing problems  employees surprisingly friendly  took order right even cleaned done   If ever come back Tropicana again need bite 3AM certainly won't any objections stopping here  very least won't drive  <EOR> Awful pizza    bought $4 slice terrible  Salty dry burnt  No good  <EOR> This place appears open 24 hours  menu items seem very reasonably priced including pizzas soups salads  didn't really want leave Tropicana during stay seemed gravitate towards place  people work seemed quite friendly  would definitely stop place again if staying Tropicana  <EOR> We Tropicana show some time kill decided hungry finding restaurant wait came here wasn't much look even aesthetically pleasing ton people crammed into lines hovering around tables waiting someone could slam trays down claim seat    The pizza wasn't bad ny style cut thin well greasy meaning using cheap toppings GF ordered salad large salad ended splitting pizza salad between two leaving full    I can't say would ever eat pizza again but may try cheese burger people sharing table looked ooh good made sad inside missed it  <EOR>
