Philly best ever Las Vegas  just Philly guys much better OG city  7 99 worth every penny  <EOR> This place connected gas station  When walked only guy both take orders cook food  menu pretty simple only few items written chalkboard  wouldn't say place dirty but doesn't feel especially clean if any sense  hole in the wall joints really want rate place high but when over pros cons don't think able to  Lets see     I double bacon cheeseburger fries  wanted onion rings but out   Pro 1  bun think brioche bun  Very soft holds meat very well  2  Good selection toppings condiments fried egg grilled onions bacon chipotle mayo good stuff mushrooms avocado  3  Fresh cut fries definitely tell aren't frozen  4  Food handling Since only guy doing everything he started cooking food then another customer came he took order payment  nonchalantly could watched see if guy would wash hands before continuing cook food    he did    which much appreciated 5  Attention detail noticed 2 things kind impressive when watching cook burger  First he made point put cheese top burger patties finishing flat top grill could begin melting  Then once grilled onions done he lifted cheese slid onions underneath it  sure made difference burger tasted but thought unique appreciated attention detail  Secondly when putting burger together he took time stack patties lettuce toppings neatly burger looked good   Cons 1  Meat quality meat just didn't seem great  Didn't beefy flavor want burger texture didn't seem great quality   2  Fries Thought fries fresh cut very soggy little no crunch all  don't double frying technique down all   Overall burger good but great  first couple bites good but  time halfway through quality meet started disappoint bit  liked chipotle mayo bun  fries seasoned well but definitely soggy  I'd give place another shot because seem some good things going them if improve weaknesses think pretty good   I'd give them 3 5 stars if could but 4 stars would just high  3 is  <EOR> Food great! Robert burger master friendly attentive  Made burger order  fries bountiful delicious  crispy seasoned well  burgers great  Fresh toppings cooked perfection  Sure they're more expensive other joints but totally worth it  those griping $6 burger there's Mickey D's down street  Don't moan paying quality food good service  locally owned business great product  deserves your support  Robert deserves your tips  <EOR> I order cheese burger onion rings burger meat patty spicy mayo lettuce tomato cheese made everything fresh <EOR>
