<EOR> I honestly don't know hype place is  think dishes OK    The last time everything tasted extremely salty  recommended friend try bacon wrapped dates really huge sweet food kinda person if sense    But tasted really sweet maple bacon wrapped around = greasy sweet    I ordered baked tilapia alright drenched lemon juice salt   Filet Mignon sliders okay bread kind hard   The sangrias really good though tried sparkling sangria red sangria    I love tomato soup brie sandwich but probably won't back unless craving that    The atmosphere dim lit enticing bar lighting background which gives most appeal  <EOR> I visited Firefly last weekend Friday night say bacon wrapped dates!  best part dinner   ambience trendy service quick polite   Besides bacon wrapped dates which amazing filet mignon sliders which good but don't think filet mignon should served burger   takes away is   also patats bravas skewers which good well   tried sangria which good but little sweet light alcohol taste   reason gave 4 stars 5 because while waiting seated outside because crowded all smokers lightiing right outside door super gross coming nonsmoker   should designate smoking area   Also seated outside where no smoking signs posted everywhere yet saw some girls smoking side none staff people said anything  <EOR> Always favorite  Just tried Eastern Ave location loved it   View amazing day night staff super friendly accommodating   Food consistently would expect fabulous   White Sangria delicious   favorite dishes garlic parmesan fries beet salad meatballs steak skewers   many great dishes however   never disappointed  <EOR> A great tapas restaurant!

only apples slice orange   it  No grapes no other lovely fruits just apples single slice orange  Meh  still tasted alright but usual fruity goodness come know love  Usually love digging through glass fruit keeps getting sloppy drunk quicker    The service alright but ask lot things including waiter seemed disappear lot even though place almost empty  ask water order more food etc  point manager over when ordered some stuffed peppers perusing menu dessert he very nice even sent over plate flan since mom talked possibly getting apparently quite charming whilst intoxicated  alone kept 4th star because overall still wasn't completely impressed usual    I ordered tortilla la espanola warm spinach salad veggies lentils stuffed peppers fruit cheese plate dessert  mom ordered some skewers chorizo steak shrimp which she absolutely fell love she liked tortilla la espanola stuffed peppers mine she tried  warm spinach salad little lacking hardly filled plate  Usually thing ridiculously huge point where cannot order any more  veggies lentils most disappointed though completely lacked any mushrooms all  dish always because mushrooms prepared well deliciously taste texture biting into rare steak  But dish did single mushroom all  Bummer  Oh now forever only order flan dessert fruit cheese plate alright but nothing write home but am glad way  crumbly cheese particular gagging reaching all beverages table  want    If before probably would given same rating maybe 3 5 since did spend ton money between service bit lacking  When look around empty restaurant service your waiter only shows once being served ask if you're doing okay  great  Overall love Firefly but experience wasn't great  <EOR> A nice inexpensive Spanish tapas restaurant located off strip  friend Tabitha boyfriend three other mutual friends  pretty good mojito  All friends really enjoyed ourselves  yes open late  <EOR> Came friend's bday celebration weekend  Pretty good tapas place street parallel strip  Everything pretty reasonably priced food pretty yummy   After couple Heine's sangrias Millers bit rowdy but all fun other people seemed tolerable racket caused   Minus star being able sing Happy Birthday diners  ourselves great time  = <EOR> every thing awesome!

This place regret giving some other places 5 stars   good  Located off strip away lights glitz Vegas nightlife however guarantee anything but dull experience here   Absolutely fantastic   I am sure everything menu delicious but few tapas recommendations   Stuffed dates  Manchego mac 'n' cheese  Stuffed peppers  Steamed mussels Camarones la diabla Steak mushroom skewers Filet mignon sliders  For drinks blueberry mojito refreshingly delicious   whole pitcher killed it   I can't emphasize enough amazing food here   waiter fantastic well service great  <EOR> This place absolutely delicious! loved everything ordered especially mushroom thing! good!! Also sparkling sangria really delicious well     My only thing against place every time there's loooooong wait even when call ahead  Nonetheless still continue <EOR> Let first begin 5 stars service! most friendly staff ever! Very professional doting incredibly familiar menu  But food seriously lacking compared prepared for  ceviche tune tartare stuffed dates octopus spicy shrimp beet salad  Everything good but nothing great memorable  words come mind flat boring  Mind ambiance included discription  ambiance very lively drinking moderation recommended  world filled tapas restaurants top list  <EOR> I think found place unique Vegas  don't know true statement but didn't chain feel it   Located strip mall five minutes away Las Vegas Blvd  aka Strip spot serves some really tasty tapas refreshing drinks   thing mention tapas seafood dishes good  Firefly loud crowded totally fun   folks getting off work looking unwind chill groups celebrating b days couples enjoying setting crowded bar people waiting next open table   The staff fairly friendly very accommodating   especially cool request pitchers caparinias instead glasses   The only thing parking sparse since Firefly shares its parking lot Ruth Chris's  prepared search   Overall local should give Firefly try  <EOR> Mojito pitchers yummy tapas!!!!  best bday dinners EVER!!!!  recommend bacon wrapped dates VERY skeptical but damn    good!  Don't forget grilled potatoes! <EOR> Good tapas but overpriced think  Friendly bartenders great mojitos but cramped loud taste yes over 40      just fact place damn popular trendy annoys hell me    Glad tried but probably won't back unless friends drag me  <EOR> GOOD SANGRIAS! GOOD TAPAS!  my friends Vegas took locals spot away strip  interesting because never anywhere outside strip before totally different city  less chaotic normal city    Wednesday wait hour hour half table!  wanted somewhere else but said worth wait  While waited ordered pitcher Red Sangria  pitcher four each two cups each  pretty good deal!  thought red sangria just okay maybe because am noob when comes drinking wine believe wine used sangria dry red wine    when finally table ordered glass white sangria sweeter less dry very delicious!  little apple pieces  floating top   also apples red sangria but didn't really pay attention because kind blended in i impressed fact sangrias everyday restaurant    we ordered ceviche some kind carne stick? well seasoned complemented sangria drinking  everything very delicious   next time Vegas am mos def coming back here! <EOR> One favorite places eat Las Vegas!  if could way would always able order 50 small dishes nibble everything while sipping yummy white wine sangria     nibble mix food all time   When comes food options choices while buffets aren't thing    tapas always good idea me!

The place totally packed happy eating outside where much quieter hustle bustle chaos inside   So yup next all you can eat tapas Hard Rock favorite place eat Vegas  <EOR> Tried place last night  packed although friends enjoyed all food overall some serious service snafus  server hurried all top it  He should some help he made couple serious mistakes  ordered glass cabernet partner asked chardonnay  Almost every restaurant automatically serve 'house' lowest price wine when someone orders glass cab etc  server did not  He took upon himself substitute glass 3 times price house wine the portion wine also very small 4 ounces   When check arrived tried find manager hostess finally foind outside  He nice enough  said he would fix check  He reduced  wine portion $48 $24 still $4 more should been  server managed poor apology told he busy simply made mistake  Hmmmm  buying it  Another note rid crappy loud piped Spanish music add  some air conditioning thr restaurant atmosphete made all want leave asap  food 4 stars service 2 stars  <EOR> Great food cool environment stays open late good House Music Miguel Miggs Samantha James Kaskade Julius Papp recognized most songs played   Firefly twice enjoyed food thoroughly both times   My friend started off baby back ribs filet mignon sliders additional side order  portions small if wanted order little bit everything could definitely stab good portion menu  pitcher Red Sangria perfect wash food down with  ended evening dessert platter which excellent! Very easy taste buds     The service evening great  server great timing very attentive needs    you're probably wondering why docked star? Well   know place loud   but certain people noticebly loud even such environment   guy group friends obviously coked mind screaming obscenities over cell phone smacking himself face acting primate speed    ignored whole time but friend obviously extremely bothered it    stayed cool cuz understand there's obviously people can't handle even being Vegas without obliterating every part themselves them human    just wish staff may noticed least took time tell calm down    So other poor version Kid Rock crack rest experience fine  I'd definitely recommend place anyone wants nice fun dining experience without having sacrifice entire wallet  <EOR> Our normal tapas stop Vegas Cafe Ba ba reeba but decided try Firefly based Yelp reviews desire off strip      menu much more extensive Firefly Cafe Ba ba reeba very good    filet mignon sliders wonderful!

A minute later she sat bench outside annoyed  The seating girlfriends seated outside patio  good news next heater which much appreciated  bad news table pushed against glass wall such way bendies squish myself into chair which way lopsided kept smacking into wall ate  also right door every time someone walked into patio sister smacked back seat  future suggest waiting little longer seat inside restaurant    Our server Granted sure he getting worked but he gave off cocky vibe didn't even write down order  Amazingly enough most items came out    except one  end meal ready order dessert requested since last item clearly coming he cancel order  Instead cancelling he said he'd check if weren't cooked already he'd cancel it  didn't hear item until bill arrived 20 minutes later he said Oh  Yeah cancelled item  The redeeming quality food Delicious  much flavor packed into small bites  little girlfriends party 4 scarfed down Smoked Salmon Toasts Ceviche Wonderfully tangy fresh Tuna Tartare Bacon Wrapped Dates Ridiculously addictive happy almond crunch inside Mac Cheese Creamy cheesy evil tasty Albondigas Lamb Skewers w Lentils Chicken Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms Thai Beef Salad  The surprise item star evening  Ridiculously good large enough small meal one!

That's where Firefly stepped in  closed restaurant Saturday afternoon accommodate large crowd 125 hungover guests  gave gigantic selection food offer everyone made sure pitchers mojitos sangria placed each tables  Ultimately ended giving everyone choice between Steak Frites Herb Roasted Chicken Vegetarian Paella  When everyone arrived pleased see more enough servers take care us  given standard bread sweet butter olives entrees tables within 30 minutes so  kicker spent less $30 per person all it    Since then return Firefly every single time Vegas  happily tried every small plate menu always enjoy sangria because syrupy overwhelmingly sweet  favorite tapas are Firefly Fries Pork Empanada Petite Filet Ham Cheese Croquetas Manchego Mac n Cheese Patatas Bravas Stuffed Dates  I typically order twice many plates table needs somehow never managed spend over $75 during any visit    If you're looking place where locals Firefly Paradise  off strip some tapas! <EOR> I eat few friends  love tapas place great selection atmosphere  loved bacon wrapped dates caramel flan best! flan good ordered another  Definitely want eat again when visit Vegas next time  <EOR> I think twice past month am ready come back nom again very soon   big guy usually prefer healthy sized meals comparison plethora small entrees pick from   But Firefly seems every time   Camarones la Diabla Tuna Tartare all dishes ordered Firefly seem continually hit spot   Plus nice malbec menu nice price   more ask for??

So glad skipped buffets came instead!! pleasantly surprised find such delicious food away strip! took cab fare $13 PH bad  cab driver told Firefly fav restaurant LV gave list other local places try too  Def need check them next time! <EOR> I came Firefly before drive back San Diego Sunday evening   group 9 but seated promptly around 7pm   two rooms restaurant larger think   I've only tapas once before but general rule seems average 2 plates per person if you're big eaters   large group its always hard share small dishes split into smaller groups sharing   also ordered pitcher sangria 3 people     Recap Sangria good   lobster escargot presented same manner escargot extremely buttery delicious   Tuna tartare really average similar all other tuna tartare other restaurants imo   some other dishes but nothing really stood mind   absolute favorite manchego mac cheese   love mac cheese   never manchego cheese but now also love manchego cheese   mac cheese cheesier side compared most really gotta love cheese this   dish small but rich each person really only needs small amount satisfied   baked crust top perfect   Definitely worth giving place try especially if you're sick eating overpriced food strip buffets  <EOR> Jan 2006 We came really late watching O Bellagio waited bar while before table  Cheap drinks!   Tip If need cab back your hotel eating late night sure ask hostess call while dining  wait nearly hour taxi its way us  ridiculous  <EOR> Stumbled place accident  Thank God did!  Plates flavorful plentiful   Drinks weren't overpriced great atmosphere   Favorites stuffed dates clams chorizo   wife crazy gazpacho!  great night back! <EOR> Stuffed dates?

Happy hour bar fun give little appetizers   Totally recommend but does busy  <EOR> A great place visitors locals  local feel but proximity strip great option visiting crowd  highly recommend reservation if don't show early  located small strip mall lots parking   For three under $60 not including tip   food generally very good  However foul item baked tilapia  came recommendation but fish didn't taste fresh  tasted frozen filets Walmart   The mushroom tart really nice portion  fan cream cheese since Boursin cream cheese strayed away cheesiest parts  Anything puff pastry mushrooms good book hit tablemates   The tuna tartare delicious  taro chips nice addition texture flavor wise  three chips only lasted through half tartare would recommend save your free bread use that  Frankly tartare seasoned nicely enough no problem eating alone!  The ham cheese croquetas upscale hot pocket  three order just good enough taste  Good comfort food   The crispy duck roll hit but wasn't wowed it  just seemed shredded pork egg roll some hoisin sauce chopped scallions  Solid but won't ordering next time   The lobster escargots FANTASTIC  hope consistently cooked dish because everyone should try once  lobster cooked just enough super tender great flavor  definite repeat next visit   I paradise mojito based some other reviews  flavor nice but if you're fan chewing your drink minced mint would steer clear this  didn't become much issue but careful every time took sip small chunks mint didn't caught throat   Service great food comes kitchen very fast hour  left when happy hour ended quite few parties waiting table  <EOR> Incredible  Bacon wrapped dates Mac n cheese sorrano sliders crispy duck ham cheese crocquetas ceviche French fries  Eat all! <EOR> I bookmarked place while now seeing Rachel Ray feature $40 day  didn't manage eat last trip time around decided try first night Vegas  didn't reservation around 7 30pm when there  Even though Monday night looked pretty packed but then again where isn't packed Vegas every single night week?  Luckily table us  Before even ordered plate complimentary appetizers placed table    olives toasted slices baguette some balls cheese flavored butter couldn't tell really   Hubby ordered sangria $6   ACK awful tasted used cheap wine it  stuck iced tea  ordered food arrived rather quickly  Boquerones $5 toast okay  marinated anchovies weren't best I'd ever but hadn't boquerones long time now really felt some  Really awesome bocquerones no trace fishiness but ones did slight fishy taste it   Fried calamari also okay  pretty good although again little much batter liking  But wasn't rubbery plus  camarones al ajillo bad but hubby said could've easily made dish home wasn't anything which blew away   The duck rolls hoisin sauce pretty disgusting book  rolls egg rolls but stuffed duck  WAY much hoisin sauce making them just sweet  actually made mouth pucker just bite  did all    The last tapa ordered lamb chops which served red wine reduction  clearly star evening  Perfectly grilled sauce enhancing lamb chops instead throwing entire dish off hoisin sauce duck rolls  served very flavorful bed lentils zucchini spaghetti strands artichokes  would definitely order dish again   5 tapa 1 glass sangria iced tea lemonade came slightly under $55 before tip  Kinda pricey if ask me  Service okay nothing write home about  Now eaten don't think come back again future trip  just way many great restaurants Vegas return Firefly  Food mediocre but think if Vegas partying place great atmosphere good downing alcohol having small bite eat  However aren't partying type even if lil guy wasn't tow  All want awesome food reasonable prices or even awesome food reasonable prices Firefly certainly doesn't fall into category  <EOR> Why oh why does Firefly located 2 082 miles away home?  This place flat awesome almost everything perfect  The atmosphere nice looks deceiving because Firefly located small strip mall outside does look impressive but inside surprisingly cozy relaxing   outside patio where want long isn't hot sitting outside very cool experience even though isn't much look always nice enjoy good meal quality drink open air   The drinks delicious well least sangria enjoyed well Riesling friend enjoyed were   Some best sangria entire life sweet savory   The food awesome ordered 5 plates food only good but surprising filing most tapa places need 5 6 plates per individual but 5 plates actually enough party 2 full   smoked salmon toast delicious Thai beef salad delicious shrimp tempura delicious fried calamari delicious steak mushroom skewers delicious   part food miss all 5 plates flavorful utterly enjoyable    My only issue service main waiter wasn't very attentive also messed part order  asked lobster escargot but instead served lamb skewers which sent back   mean guess honest mistake both start letter L but come now can't mix lobster lamb   Even said overall service pretty good guy charge refilling water glass clearing plates excellent really likeable if only he could teach main waiter something all would good   Firefly must visit if Vegas don't care if off strip little strip mall food drinks overall experience awesome!

Passion Fruit Mini Cheesecakes came very close second place  thickness each little bite threw taste buds loop exciting kind rollercoasters! only complaint some portions could little more robust  well versed whole concept tapas being small plates but feel big thick flavors dish should that  only 1 drawback think lunch FIREFLY* success! can't wait back try more things!!! <EOR> uh maze ing  don't see many restaurants rated 4 5 stars very often  local friend recommended place favorite intrigued    The restaurant little strip mall parking lot nothing fancy  dress nice but casual don't need suit  no stuffy white table cloths found  sure appreciate elbows off table but love any restaurant where don't conscious proper manners  early around 7 30 8pm luckily group 6 immediately table  service great ambiance perfect food incredible    Order pitcher red sangria $28   delicious!

A free bread basket always good especially when comes amazing herb butter in house  Olives served side   The menu isn't huge but seems daunting  absolutely read titles descriptions each dish  Does Stuffed dates sound appealing? Maybe does but additional bacon wrapped smoked almond red wine reduction blue cheese can't hurt   Assuming you're party two you've waded through menu order least three things per person  course happy hour snack item perfect but talking dinner here  Some dishes other half never fail order Stuffed Dates sometimes order each us order gets five Chicken Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms Manchego Mac n Cheese Mushroom Tart Petite Filet  Some always necessary but love them Patatas Bravas Albondigas Crispy Duck Rolls Steak Mushroom Skewers  probably end ten different dishes every time there   I would through entire menu but go to plates delicious only able try two new things every time!

CONCLUSION If you're tired eating buffets want mix recommend coming Firefly! prices very reasonable food rich full flavor! say EAT IT!!!!!!!!!! <EOR> Make reservations!  LV seminar 8 pm reservations   Walked 7 30 hopes could take early but mob people waiting seated but lucky foresight reservations seated 7 40 before anyone mob   Everything amazing food service  am lover great wine hesitant order sangria code word wine cooler but  finally red sangria delicious   definitely order future  <EOR> Small plates yes  Tapas no   OK Vegas strip which apply sliding scale give place 2 stars in NYC would if Yelp allowed zero    It's crowded dark festive  OK far thinking we're starting off right  Then drinks  Way watered down  expensive  Then came food  If anyone does food prep restaurant ever Spain I'd surprised   I'm all innovation but only when results worth it  better tapas completely forgettable rest actually bad  Seriously  people give place good review ever eaten good food? drunk off weak crappy drinks notice? <EOR> I'd given higher stars never eaten tapas before which San Francisco lot better there  BUT  prices ridiculously low except wine markup which 3x bottle which always consider just inappropriate knocks half point off restaurant reviews   The food itself pretty good especially eggplant canneloni perfectly roasted eggplant skin  manchego mac and cheese could used tad more salt mac could just little bit chewier though whole good example whole let's play around with comfort food genre  aioli wasn't really snuff which made patatas bravas little sub standard    The real winner menu dessert which usually don't expect very good  But tres leches really moist flavorful chocolate gelato just right level dark something floral it  <EOR> We came hubby's Las Vegas birthday bash   We'd wanting come few years now but just never made it   Boy glad came!!  This place bumpin'    we showed restaurant already full   promptly seated quickly served    We big party all ordered wanted which meant lot food table   first slow clearing plates but eventually little lady came basically patrolled table picking empty plates soon last bite came off it   lady top filling waters clearing plates getting everything wanted   point saw someone departing party hand tip way out   Doesn't surprise me!  She awesome! We tipped separately Food time!!  I admit some hits some misses   But hits very much shadowed misses    Misses Tomato Bread hoping simple version all over Barcelona but turned over vinegary bread wasn't nearly substantial enough sustain topping became soggy very fast  Lobster Escargot dish overcooked lobster mushy fresh tasting all   seasoning enough sauce bread dipping worthy  HIts Pulpo Asado Roasted octopus   nice portion octopus perfectly cooked tender bite Paella haven't good history paella but daresay favorite version far   rice well cooked ingredients perfectly balanced each other  Ribeye topped blue cheese butter favorite treatments steak   asked medium rare served way perfect!! Mushroom Tart Mushroom gravy ish thing topping square puff pastry  exactly tart but delicious nonetheless   All all great time   sparkling sangria drink   Don't expect high octane stuff but great palate refresher  <EOR> The only reason Firefly Paradise because Rachael Ray told to   JK   saw $40 day Las Vegas just try out   ordered whole slew things but stand being veggie tomato soup   Here's kicker don't even care tomato soup   But some reason Firefly's tomato soup divine!  I'm going back few weeks am excited! <EOR> WOW! place off strip really nails it! Fantastically priced portioned  signature mojitos sangria down very easy  Open late serves food late! <EOR> Excellent fairly affordable tapas Las Vegas  hidden gem  definitely worth leaving Strip  <EOR> I'm fan shrimp ceviche stuffed dates duck rolls ahi tuna skewers mojitos! <EOR> Coming east coast visit wanted away strip lunch   friends thought great idea take Tapas Sangrias  course did disappoint!  1 Chicken salad chopped breast grapes smoked almonds creamy cider dressing endive   wasn't anything special just regular chicken salad if ask me   2 Smoked Salmon Toasts brioche toast dill sour cream pickled red onion capers   okay think expected fresher salmon colder would probably better   3 Stuffed Dates bacon wrapped smoked almond red wine reduction blue cheese   awesome dish   doesn't love bacon wrapped apps?    4 Padron Peppers flash fried touch salt most mild   Always signature tapas dish can't really wrong these   5 Stuffed Peppers Spanish piquillo peppers fresh mozzarella garlic cream cheese tomato sauce   thought okay     6 Manchego Mac N Cheese baked w baby shells   pretty awesome dish would definitely recommend dish   7 Tierra y Mar skewers grilled shrimp filet mignon chorizo sausage salsa verde   okay skewered meat    8 Chorizo Clams grilled shrimp filet mignon chorizo sausage salsa verde   bad flavorful toasts came great sauce   9 Filet Mignon Sliders mini burgers w Serrano ham cabrales cheese caramelized onions   thought only okay nothing special   And pitcher Red Sangria   really good recommend meal   I would definitely want come back again when come back Vegas  <EOR> I new favorite place Vegas that isn't strip club dive bar !
