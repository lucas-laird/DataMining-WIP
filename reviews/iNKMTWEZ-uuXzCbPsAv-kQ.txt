Very patient friendly staff  would recommend getting lobster bisque  <EOR> Let start saying really love Cafe Zupas food  very good selection food always tests fresh  review reflection food reflection service  would also add little high maintenance food remove add that but always understood may charged extra this  never minded paying extra because food way it  if you're customize your order little don't bother location    When mood sandwich always turkey bacon club  always order same way remove tomatoes add three cheese artichoke spread  When asked attendant she told couldn't because only add bacon avocados sandwiches  informed sandwich way every time order never problem before location any location  She seemed very surprised said still wouldn't allow add spread  also informed if needed charge extra artichoke spread didn't mind  She told per management she couldn't that  asked speak  manager when did requested he charge spread sandwich way I'd like  willing put spread sandwich  attendant manager rude when discussing but still very unhappy situation  don't understand why any management team would charge extra item add in  though they're losing money  very dissatisfying customer  thanking them time left without purchasing anything  <EOR> I love place  always gotten mango berry salad but tried couple sandwiches  All totally delicous hot fresh  taste every ingredient fresh really is    The only reason giving place four stars because ordering process kind hassle takes while  6 people asking ordered soup salad sandwich want then repeat again person cash register    Other everyone always super happy nice food delish  <EOR> Very disappointed first time here   ordered large BBQ chicken salad no onions go  lot lettuce barely any other ingredients but plenty of   ONIONS!
