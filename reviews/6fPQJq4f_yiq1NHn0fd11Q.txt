Right across little stand bar ahead order Paris souvenir drink while you're waiting  even grab delicacy bakery since little French bakeries lined along walkway La Creperie located at  <EOR> I recently discovered having serious issue Vegas some old dumpy hotels  came into Paris grab crepe before headed home only just fantastic endure run down hotels access places    There handful hotels Vegas really nice experience others just don't need step foot in   That being said probably find crepe stand but did stop off La Creperie  plenty times past  YEARS ago many many years ago when Paris actually fairy decent average acceptable hotel couple times last few years   I ordered Fresh Berry less satisfactory but boyfriend ordered Ham Cheese which actually pretty tasty    Definitely Savory over Sweet  something you'll very rarely catch suggesting total sweets girl! Love em'  Team Dessert forever! but disappointed Sweet options past couple times crepe here  ingredients don't taste fresh good quality strictly filler food  If you've two many drinks don't care many calories you're puttin' away order one  <EOR> Nutella your mind? better way eat creamy goodness crepe    or really flat pancake? it   no better way!  This place inside Paris hotel little ways back strip entrance hotel you'll walk through entire casino floor walk down past quite few other stores places eat  Also place hole wall no seating attached  You'll use tables shared among all near food places during peak times might find table   or eat euro style   that means sitting another group same table  Hey space limited happen   We tried Nutella banana foster crepes  bananas foster crepe okay  wasn't bad but wasn't great sounded menu  But Nutella crepe did disappoint!   I actually enjoyed only crepes but overall experience getting place finding seat open seating area  felt little bit actually being back Europe me  <EOR> Sorry but only 3 stars sis cousins I    This creperie Paris Hotel Las Vegas   Took uber because just seriously craving some good crepe!  excited finally crepes   Thank goodness no line but encountered very unhappy guy manager time     yikes!  mean no customer service skills all   No Smiles No Hello asked different crepes he told read menu    uhmm really!?

Thankfully accompanying whipped cream wasn't overly sweet   It great first bite but less consumed   sugar really catches you!  regretted getting water   Probably somewhat overpriced but service fast didn't put much ice dining companion's Pepsi  <EOR> Convenient location quick meal between conference sessions  actually visited La Creperie twice during week Vegas try 3 different crepes sharing friends  tried fresh berry caramel apple roasted chicken crepes  highly recommend all three but favorite caramel apple  Oh goodness    tart green apples tons gooey caramel    yummy All crepes $10 12 dollars days visited running special crepe fountain soda $10 cheaper crepe alone!   Side note few locations shops find bathroom open seating    take advantage  <EOR> I thought savory pesto roasted chicken crepe delicious! Lots chicken asparagus sun dried tomatoes maybe even little many sun dried tomatoes     surprisingly filling despite just being single crepe  Some friends sweet nutella covered fruit consensus everyone happy  Prices ran $10 $11    I've never real crepe France before guess don't know if legit but overall satisfying quick easy way grab something eat! <EOR> Very bad first impression  several other stores inside Paris Las Vegas counter facing street   walk window order served  Would work great incredible slowness staff today displayed  time entered line order until received crepe 30 minutes  When did didn't trays which isn't terrible except still all luggage since 20 minutes before 2 cup fill drink  30 minutes overpriced crepe poor service when could obviously see handful poor overall demeanor  Definitely single star visit     <EOR> I rush some quick filling food before going night  glad La Creperie close hotel room elevator else probably wouldn't found amazing place such hurry  seafood crepe everyone talking called Fruits De Mer which shrimp scallops mushrooms mozerella cheese fresh basil  delicious but could've seasoned seafood little more  plan back hotel room change clothes then eat taxi but ended getting locked outside hotel room ate sitting outside room waited security come let in  also ordered Forestiere crepe but accidently left room when rushed taxi didn't try The service quick crepes usually ready 5 10 minutes  All crepes savory dessert $9 99  <EOR> Best crepes town  came off time no wait!

Honestly whole new world    see ugliest side person   There's much tension hostility when people looking table chair   family lucky enough find table but just trying more chair took 20 minutes   Also while you're eating feel see people lurking your table ready grab your table once done   jungle   *Survival Fittest!*  However please remember during Christmas week   Overall totally recommend place! <EOR> #61 2016  The line customers didn't move quickly while cooks hustled wondered why looked busy assembling meal 1 star Michelin restaurant    So much activity crepes? Crepes simple fast prepare  I wonder if someone didn't show prep work? At any rate crepes good  breakfast crepe roasted turkey red onion béchamel avocado hit spot   My little boy all sweet whipped cream etc  tried redirect something protein but he vacation why not    Seating while plentiful drab dark room  wondered if could lighten add some Parisian street charm if didn't feel saying Finish your food get   out  Ha ha ha   Bottom line Creperie food  alright  <EOR> We stayed Paris ate breakfast twice! pretty amazing  both sweet savory crepes  service extremely helpful thanked stopping by  <EOR> Get Toulouse  C'est tresssssss bon!
