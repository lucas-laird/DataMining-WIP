GM responded effect put rush order then decided indicating fault  friend said Well wasn't rush order which why thought odd just thanked coming back  Then GM responded Yes thanking enabling staff enjoy some free delicious beignets  He say chose leave behind beignets which ready out  sarcastic mocking tone  stunned   I explain situation a  ordered dessert time spare assured twice male server would receive quickly b  25 minutes passed never arrived c  no service during time seek flag servers updates info d  since already paid came back   He immediately defensive  No apology  He started explanation busy during happy hour  certainly understand that  doesn't mean ignore patrons duration stay  Happy hour ends 7 30  6 10 when stopped providing any service until stood leave  Also service still poor 9 30   Pierotti also dispute factual account long things took  GM claimed order rush ready 3 min time leaving ready out  ordered 25 min before left  math doesn't compute  He didn't agree implying lying  He argued 25 min would ridiculously long only thing takes long time brie  said yes long time  why finally leave event time  also paid 10 min advance  even then math doesn't compute  could kitchen only first heard order three minutes before left when paid 10 min prior? If someone dropped ball forgot put order then simple mistake  Which brings back original issue great inconvenience all he offer apology ask he could situation better  Standard customer service  Instead he defensive rude condescending sarcastic accusing Customers! lying experience   The food fine  But won't return  never encountered GM would treat anybody way  He abusing power shame no overseeing hold accountable  <EOR> I feeling place some HUGE fans suppose see why   Town Square become relatively trendy destination all kinds people Las Vegas   surface wine whiskey lounge happy hour menu sounds great     However     This place seemed pretty confused me   didn't seem any real connection any menu items   decor clearly expensive but attractive   Prices high it seemed whiskey drink special day Wild Turkey which hardly seems special me   Waitresses dressed trashy did hostesses   see might allure some contexts but just seemed place here   The music loud really bass heavy which would seemed appropriate if dance floor but just tiny little bar   I don't know maybe missed something just didn't   would probably willing give another chance but am currently unimpressed Double Helix  <EOR> YOUR STAFF THREATENED PAYING CUSTOMERS ATTEMPTED PHYSICAL ALTERCATION Last night bf decided meet drinks some food before really loved it  Everything great evening on  At some point sure if bar tender bar back but them manages knock over entire glass ice water completely soaks jeans jacket  We sitting bar fuss napkins wipe counter but water already spilled whatever    I'm annoyed but do  bf other hand really upset situation  until 10 min later 2nd bartender comes napkin saying hey heard water spilled! Uhh ok thanks but you're little late  bf clearly upset kind just tells guys already spilled there's nothing do  bartender doesn't say another word  word hey let's another drink  understand don't offer round drinks house  But spilled whole glass ice water clearly customer upset yet moment say nothing repair whatsoever    About half hour decide leave  check everything paid for  offer leave cash tip which bf takes because he upset situation point  too  But also person always leaves 20% even when horrible service can't help it  LEAVE   The bartender then follows we're DOORS ALREADY starts asking BF problems he doesn't want leave UPSET  Ok point now AM GETTING MAD  feels bartender now just antagonizing KNOWING damn well he upset before left  only reason he stops because he didn't tip???? PAID BILL  every opportunity repair customer relationship sat long enough water spilled ample time dry time left  NO now decide follow because don't want upset   absurd! could done something sooner chose to   My bf angry point he doesn't talk guy instead walks away situation    And disbelief walk off towards car BARBACK now followed trying FIGHT BF  guy left JOB follow PAYING CUSTOMERS he could threaten attempt PHYSICAL ALTERCATION! absolutely INSANE!!!!!

I ordered pretty much everything happy hour food menu past can't really wrong  favorite probably Arancini everything  If looking only thing would recommend that    They indoor outdoor seating  During winter sit fire pit which haven't tried yet but list! <EOR> If looking place grab quick drink don't suggest coming here  girlfriends came just happy hour wait table because all sat but because understaffed  situation fault guest perhaps manager should step help run drinks whatnot?   Due fact understaffed service slow  When am sitting empty glass wine shouldn't beg take money  kind ruined vibe night   do stay another drink because company great find another bar?  ultimately decided second glass wine   The food great came fast  ordered ever so popular Arancini cheese charcuterie platter  smoked duck delicious cheese selection nice  would maybe suggest combining cheese charcuterie plate serving cheese smaller plate only made dish appear smaller but barely enough room 3 eat hightop  each small share plate glass wine glass water   nothing crazy    When came time pay bill server along most guests disappeared  still packed would little more understanding  almost common sense drop off check should check back within few minutes     UPDATE Tried place again Thursday evening took 10 minutes acknowledged same slow service  great happy hour deals hard resist coming every once while  <EOR> I am wavering between 3 4 stars  Yelp keeps happening me   please option! bar being middle open space mall loses points ambiance  just seems oddly placed  did drink selection highly enjoyed cocktails offer along definitely hit the spot cheese plate  Service pretty good I'd possibly come back glass wine if Palazzo  <EOR> Everytime party end getting overcharged something     bartenders end upcharging everything especially during happy hour    Even worse multiple occasions drinks added tab even ours   believe practices come direct management bringing any more parties business associates again   I believe honesty integrity best policy   not trying leach money people  <EOR> Double Helix Town Square elegant comfortable cozy place happy hour 3 30 7 30 DAILY its classy bar attractive patio courtyard  EXTENSIVE menu drinks $3 7 beer wine 1 2 price cocktails whiskey bar dishes $3 6 !
