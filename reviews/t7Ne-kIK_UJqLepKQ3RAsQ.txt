AMAZING!   Mahalos aunties!  Product Grade A Service Grade A+ Worth money grade A Overall Impression Grade A! <EOR> Wow checked twice first dukedom!  Woot!  know won't last long though     I saw place Yelp wanted sure paid visit during weekend stay   store simply set nothing fancy formal but sure variety stuff besides beef jerky   Chocolate candies dried fruits hot links bagel chips cookies pan     did want try popular cinnamon bagel chips but couldn't myself spend $8 75 $9 00 them I wish smaller size smaller price    Hubby ended getting peppered beef jerky $8 75 friend 2 different teriyaki beef jerkys $8 75 $9 50    The peppered jerky good but salty   Even hubby likes salty food said salty didn't deter eating though    friend's teriyaki jerkys really good    why second visit myself   hindsight should've gotten least 2 bags instead one   Hubby ate way home Cali almost gone now   Shoot   Las Vegas Jerkys back day  <EOR> Karen's Gourmet Almond Butter Shortbread cookies win    On way Vegas topic buffets restaurants desserts drinks clubs etc  talked but friend's friend raging shortbread cookies must ain't leaving Las Vegas  Sounds great idea them because sure don't mind leaving LV D!   Anyway place felt hidden  dont even remember found place but sure through flights stairs escalators cut through certain corners before reached destination    I feel ridiculous bit ashamed getting ANY jerky because whole time thought cookies only important thing try!   Shame me    hm actually thought creating whole separate yelp page Karen's Gourmet cookies but then sugar rush getting heavenly cookies all antsy when happens think just better stay put create anything any sort because something ridiculous might happen  Okay am just rambling non sense now    Anyway cookies definitely tasted traditional homemade rich  Every bite cookies tasted perfectly light texture nice creamy flavor kick whatever certain taste chose  personally chose almond butter mentioned earlier absolutely mouth watering! <EOR> The best beef jerky ever life  wish sold online wouldn't drive all way Vegas  beef jerky most tender easy chew easy eat swallow most flavorful beef jerky is  Period  <EOR> Cinnamon chocolate bagel chips light addicting!!! could probably eat whole container myself! Kinda pricey but since local worth me!   Worth drive strip getting lost lol  <EOR> I'd guess 3 4 more place's business visitors Hawaii   Strangely Big Island beef jerky made Vegas brought back Hawaii   little odd time new varieties cookies fewer choices beef jerky   No more 1 pound bags anything   But maybe because beef prices days   shortbread cookies bagel chips legendary those sweet tooths   easy spend $50 or more way more sure stop close end your trip if you're budget  <EOR> This must stop before heading home especially live islands  absolutely love cinnamon bagel chips but since ran containers  decided buy jalapeno parmesan bagel chips instead since bummed very good  Another must almond butter shortbread cookies  many other choices beef jerky dried fruit  Minimum purchase use debit credit cards $10  people nice give cute hand carry box! <EOR> Nitrate heaven   Salt valhalla   The jerky store called  me  I miss but never downtown early enough evening  They many different kinds dried meaty goodness hard know where begin I recommend peppered nuggets silver pouches   If beef's your thing clam ahi turkey pork  other jerkies well along dried fruits nuts candy Hawaiian junk food   Between 2 lbs jerky inevitably come home deep fried Twinkie Mermaids trips downtown starting pretty unhealthy  Note shop temporarily relocated Las Vegas Club during remodeling Plaza  <EOR> Muthaeffin' cinnamon raspberry bagel crisps crack!  never done crack but if good then you'll catch upcoming episode Intervention no doubt   The Jerkys other hand aight   obviously something Hawaii locals transplants jerky thing   Don't wrong am carnivore say least   Still if choose can't resist Chinese style beef jerky   Luckily place supplies but larger variety 99 Ranch 168 Market SF Market other Asian grocery stores lot less   Besides took full advantage purchasing dehydrator Bass Pro Shops during Black Friday now starting very own jerky trial error venture  LOL   The place acoomodates caters locals islands provides airline carry on boxes well incentives purchases over $100   Good gifts long vacay losing money   haha for Hawaii visitors    So if pick place would say local jerky queen Sun's Jerky Las Vegas   believe Thai style love heat muster out   others much   offer buffalo chicken other flavors must try   But until Sun's starts bagel crisps you'll find frequenting both places   why 4 stars might ask   try crisps then holla cha boy!  Grind! <EOR>
