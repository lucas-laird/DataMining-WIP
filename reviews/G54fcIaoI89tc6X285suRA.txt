The food different story  incredibly confused number positive reviews place    I ordered iced coffee partner ordered house brew  iced coffee tasted sitting back dirty fridge few days house brew just tasted burned gas station coffee  Also pretty sure creamer used off    The soup came 35 minutes ordered  bland tasted almost canned soup  actually sure soup received called because server wasn't actually server but barista    Almost 40 minutes soup served meal showed up  ordered ham Swiss sandwich partner ordered pasta primavera  sandwich literally cheap store bought hamburger bun slice Swiss cheese some prepackaged lunch meat  Also sandwich COLD?!   My partners meal just disappointing  vegetables primavera absolutely same frozen bagged kind receive hospital meals  pasta severely undercooked cold sauce absolutely no seasoning whatsoever    Ultimately never set foot place again  insulting place would charge prices hospital school quality lunch  Honestly name place should warned me  D'coffee shop really? stupid  <EOR> Everything restaurant made scratch house!! love it!!
