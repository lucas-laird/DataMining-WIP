I've baked ziti chicken which adore pizza both excellent but lunch love getting sandwiches bars  ordered hot pastrami sandwich for second time bf black blue sliders instead regular fries upgraded smokehouse fries  Note may wrong name fries  Basically steak fries melted cheese bacon chives creme fresh other stuff think The pastrami sandwich awesome! served marble rye bread my favorite rye crispy crunchy all soggy pastrami perfect comes melted Swiss cheese cole slaw on sandwich   combination hot pastrami cool crispy cole slaw divine  exactly way sandwich should made  hats off cooks  side regular fries which pretty lackluster bland  But never care fries    Bf said black blue sliders good wrong steak bleu cheese? but smokehouse fries very good  bite alright but very sweet    The problem happened food  server asked if needed anything else said no    and then he didn't come table again until made obvious needed him  He came couple times but never came us  Once even when done food clearly just sitting there  Finally he came took order table next other side asked if table wanted more beer eventually landed table  asked box check when he came back just handed debit card without even looking check  NEVER that  But afraid we'd never see again  He came back fairly quickly gave receipt  While going another couple come sat table no come them all 5 minutes  No acknowledgement no menus nada  mad left  could see woman telling hostess being pretty upset frankly don't blame her  would done same thing  server could least acknowledged her  He saw left woman stopped talking hostess walked  when he walked host stand inquire it  Nice    Bottom line if want eat bar area prepare wait  If wasn't awesome food I'd never back again  But sometimes put sub par service if want great meal  <EOR> Absolutely love place! locals stopped brew great time!

Beer good well liked selection    Prices Food average but beer cheap! 60 oz $6   how could wrong!??  Atmosphere Cozy almost at home feel dining area  think made service better  Bar different story  Just thing eat areas smoke  Just drinking? Sure   Overall would definitely back Chicago Brewing Co  but only cheap beer  <EOR> Okay place grab beer watch game  food average prices okay pricey but cheap  <EOR> This difficult review because if bar brewery only would EASILY give them 4 stars  think beer pretty solid happy hours prices excellent  few things irked but we'll them    I pretty large party suppose should take into account  Service wasn't exceptional maybe serving large party affects somewhat  manager restaurant extremely polite accomodating appreciate that  don't regret celebrating all  glad chose place  probably could done just well picking big ol' corporate BJ's brewery Yardhouse but always give preference smaller businesses experience unique spin food    I tried standard pale which very smooth but perhaps bit uninspiring  Perhaps could bit more floral but very easy drink plus  amber sweet comforting  Better bottle Fat Tire no doubt  also tried brown ale  Slightly less malty New Castle but again fairly easy drink  Trying beers fun would try more them  coconut porter looks especially tempting save next time   My food experience wasn't phenomenal but decent enough suppose  ordered italian beef sandwich because understanding its' authentic Chicago food item  meat perhaps tad more well done would liked salty but Au Jois adequate  macaroni salad pretty standard  chicago pizza others ordered looked pretty agreeable Reuben looked delicious  think choose next time    I think bit silly happy hour allowed dining area  Several party walked over bar brought back beers much better price rest order full price  don't quite see purpose policy but hey business   For birthday complementary chocolate pizookie served   am partial chocolate but honestly pretty damn good appreciate gestures such this    So does place stack BJ's Yardhouse? Probably even  I'd give them 3 5 rounded 4 because personal touch novelty brewing own beers  WOULD certainly recommend place event just manage your expectations suppose  cool looking fun environment celebrate thank them helping fun night  <EOR> Female bartender large blonde hair Shelly? rather rude giving poor service late  easier pass well because beer selection slipping  all other new brewpubs popping think mainly rely gambling barflies rather product  <EOR> This first sadly last time here! friend mine eaten several prior occasions suggested place  Since she spoke highly really wanted try it   At first glance very impressed decor but  only thing impressed me  dining companion said she only gets thing when she dines Chicago Brewing Company  Shrimp Cocktail  When brought plate shrimp out it previously served cocktail glass first thing she said the shrimp smaller price since last time ate here  wanted try Chicago Style Pizza ordered one  first came didn't sauce used although toppings quite tasty bacon chicken asked if would re make pizza time using white sauce obliged  second came but obviously under cooked  piece each pizza coke just because didn't eat much ordered root beer float   My companion both left unsatisfied  Within less hour became physically ill  reading reviews seems most people place but experience  Unfortunately can't agree everyone else time  opinion food mediocre best priced bit high side  complete total waste $40 talk something ruin someones day? Everyone entitled opinion posted accurate fair review  Thanks taking time read  Hope your experience if decide leaps bounds better mine was!  If business owner willing should happen see review would graciously accept refund but don't believe could ever convince return  <EOR> I mixed emotions when comes giving place rating  When first perfect nothing negative say all  Then last 2 times food cold fries old stale booze opinion kinda weird tasting  <EOR> Not bad but most smoking video porker   chicken enchilada soup which paired nicely sun down stout nitro  <EOR> This classic homestyle pub where always feel welcome when walk in  food well made reasonably priced seasoned well  sat bar wasn't loud wasn't smoky friendly  bartenders both personable very attentive I don't suggest gambling machines very greedy    My understanding cigar bar upstairs since don't smoke cigars didn't opt check out  However did notice lot traffic going stairs cigar bar which shall take positive sign   I suggest little gem nights when just want hang friend beer relax  <EOR> I place bookmarked seeing several delicious looking pictures being posted yelp  Hubby decided come dinner left full satisfied  beer brewed site won several awards Great American Beer Festival World Beer Cup  Did try any beer?

Vinnie server he great! Always checked made sure happy meal refilled drinks when needed  service good but then again only 3 tables 4 tops less may reason   As far quality food average  Nothing ordinary  reason 3 stars  menu doesn't excite nothing would ever lure back craving something here  more pub type menu but there's nothing would thinking oh should come back *insert savory dish*   ordered buttermilk battered chicken breast steak fries side buffalo sauce  chicken crispy well breaded but wasn't meal wanting more  steak fries weren't cooked thoroughly some pieces cooked well other pieces hard fries through    Also interior design wasn't enticing presentable  remodel renovation needed  menu needs work maybe revitalize menus received falling apart presentable  wasn't impressed interior design seemed little outdated worn down  another factor 3 Star rating  Customers want feel they're walking into well maintained design  <EOR> Based beer alone I'd give Chicago Brewing Company 5 stars   The selection beers great prices during happy hour awesome!
