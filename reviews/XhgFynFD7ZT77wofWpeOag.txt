originally sat bar but didn't stay bartender short time seemed bad mood  good server named Miguel patio  He seemed only happy work today  manager loud trying set wedding later afternoon which made feel rushed removing all furniture around us  He made obvious he wanted leave he could vacuum area prepare next guests  would understand more if hadn't just sat down table 15 minutes prior vacuum arriving furniture disappearing  need focus little more customer service if want repeat business  <EOR> After hearing lot other residents Las Vegas boyfriend decided drive Mount Charleston some hiking followed lunch  When first walked host phone noticed several servers standing around talking  Once off phone host informed since dog would sit dog patio which currently no service  She let know if didn't mind going bar order bartenders would bring food which no trouble all   Our experience started off fine until stopped bar grab glass wine lunch while enjoying view  While handed lunches boxes which seemed confusing host said meals would brought assumed would regular plates   Later meal two couples sat patio immediately greeted server brought water dish dog none things ever offered us   Another gentleman sitting dog waiting greeted he watched other table greeted  servers continued ignore until he finally asked served watching two servers help table four  Being servers turned off fact served all did receive same level service others mostly several servers sitting around could easily made good tip off serving us  impressed food service  <EOR> Great service buffalo burger juicy tasty advertised  Paul Bunyon wife buffalo  getting buffalo next time sure  great servers great lodge feel amazing views  <EOR> Road tripped friends Red Rock Mt Charleston decided some warm beverages here  Wasn't very busy all lot's empty seating but took 5 minutes seated party front debating whether actually going dine  left finally seated  asked if lunch mentioned all but some would eating  hostess made point say she could seat people just beverages  rules rules place probably gets very packed times but found interesting necessary thing say considering slow day also considering some drinks cost much food    We all ordered hot drinks ordered Irish coffee $10 expensive Giant Bavarian pretzel $9 which shared mother  friends ordered pizza mentioned bit undercooked  pretzel yummy but pricey  general food experience average best many decent options vegetarians nothing vegan could obviously out  floor under table filthy forks garbage previous guests everywhere  also only carded alcohol when another person drinking table  always flattered carded but if you're carding should card all should system just making sure all drinkers legal age  waiter service excellent  server way sure everything needed even another waiter serving checked us  thing doing right hiring excellent servers  I'd probably back again if area friends since really only options Mount Charleston but think I'd prefer hit bar instead restaurant  <EOR> We visiting some friends summerlin weekend when came spot  Nice easy drive mountains  Awesome views around entire place  Does feel vegas  fish n chips  Very nice big
