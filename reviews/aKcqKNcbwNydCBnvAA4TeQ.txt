The casino bit small but does job   The staff very professional welcoming    Our room 22nd floor  could music bar downstairs room but  given anywhere near Freemont St  room very modern spacious    We staying again  <EOR> I stayed lot if casinos Vegas off strip Downtown Grand just put lot properties notice  rooms nice without old vegas downtown smell often associated casinos downtown    The casino new games restaurants good overall atmosphere gives vegas something desperately missing  Outside 3rd street actually feels downtown  Hogs Heifers pizza rocks triple George adds all  <EOR> There much better places stay DT Vegas  hotel rooms they're definitely modern cute but    uncomfortable only way describe it  shower tub strange no door curtain just plate glass covers half shower  other half wide open meaning 1 you're reaching couple feet around glass just turn shower unless want stand wait warm 2 water ends bathroom floor 3 cold    since there's no shower door close help trap nice warmth  don't it  Nothing half door works shower  pillows also totally strange  They're almost tootsie roll shaped  know people different tastes but impossible comfortable pillow thick firm believe alone that  no other options available either  Seriously crappiest night sleep ever hotel! television does work either  only reason even trying turn because Fremont Street blaring right now  Yes yes Vegas appreciate fact noisy  But 14th floor facing away Fremont    REALLY loud   I'm fan blowing big bucks lodging Vegas since little time spent your room anyway  BUT when want comfy right?  place comfy! On top now there's actual fee valet parking? didn't even think existed Vegas  Simply put outrageous   Oh way casino virtually no table games  sure happened but place if want anything besides video poker slots   I'm staying again  <EOR> Make sure read reviews before stay here! stayed hotel March 11 13 while vacationing week between Los Angeles Vegas  While checking front desk charged card twice stay  supposed just charge hotel deposit resort fee  booked them through Expedia when called Expedia contacted hotel hotel admitted mistake said would reverse charge which turned extra $300 wasn't looking pay   called throughout week speak manager kept blowing off saying accounting issue just wait  huge inconvenience being vacation  point when id call front desk would tell manager busy would call back  then called Choice Hotels corporate office filed formal complaint which hotel 3 days respond to  didn't respond called corporate office back  able contact hotel told hotel would respond inconvenience caused me  Needless say spoke back manager Nubia  Nivea all she did offer upgrade next visit better suite because money gone back card     WHOLE WEEK LATER when back home off vacation  declined offer let know going somewhere guest appreciated spending money just blown off offered upgrade next time! them think I'd ever come back??? <EOR> I loved place! just returned staying 7 3 7 6   I really enjoyed place! Very cute hotel  Simple   clean   well decorated   great!!!  The Ogden StewRt restaurant seemed very pretty clean nice  But never chance eat there  Next time    I DID eat Commissary  Loved it  Really good bacon cheeseburger  bacon bit over cooked but beyond that   the burger itself REALLY good  breakfast strawberry creeps  $6 one  very big more likely fill up  didn't even finish mine  Mexican hot chocolate really good well   Very nice pool area  pretty shallow  Probably 4'   I loved room  Room 2135 Grand Tower  Nice decor  Clean  Comfortable bed  Good view pool mountains  Bathroom good size but agree all say shower weird  1 4th glass enclosure odd  drafty all openness the water pressure toilet very hardcore which cool  But water pressure shower weak!!! But most  shower being open would imagine low pressure else water would really fly!!!  I loved serve free coffee tea everyday 6 30am 10 00am Art Bar lobby   Also great location  Right Fremont Street!!   Be aware $50 per night incidental fee  pay $150 3 nights  Fabulous!!! no mini bar nobody uses room phones calls anymore  Why $150??? just sayin    <EOR> I really place! price paid its really good    The only con bathroom  don't shower its only glass can't close anything water everywhere   I also would prefer if self laundry service     Most hotels provide fringe microwave but hasn't unfortunately   Apart all liked place probably would stay again <EOR> This first visit Grand  Check very quick helpful due factor  originally reserved smoking room mistake but young man front desk very helpful correcting mistake   When arrived room pleasantly surprised nice room but heard little bit music back ground  didn't think until later night  music progressively louder thru night  sure wish asked room far pool possible   I thankful ear plugs provided but nervous use them due fact hearing fire alarm if gone off during night   It nice experience Freemont street videos but please note best place children due some people showing little clothing possible   All say might stay again but more specific where room located  <EOR> Major props security team Downtown Grand  phone stolen casino security caught thief took phone contacted husband within 10 minutes theft  thankful quick work!  Regarding hotel itself room spacious very nice  Price good location can't downtown  definitely back  <EOR> It's nice place stay but value declined   We've staying DTG since opened  Last week Monday Friday probably eighth stay  much want love place but continue quirks detract overall experience  If just want nice clean room bit removed noise Fremont Street Experience excellent choice  boutique feel unique among 15 Vegas properties stayed over years  well kept housekeeping good wifi works well rare Vegas property convenient all downtown   Our biggest issue pool public pool  even advertise fact billboard Las Vegas Blvd  pay $26 per night Grand Experience Fee including tax which key folder notes Includes Access pool during seasonal hours  Problem don't any priority over non guests limited lounge pool space  large pool deck  Last week very hot found pool lounges crowded locals came equipped pool toys coolers  no attempt screen people  afternoon watched homeless man arrive carefully put things day pack wash off pool shorts  talking night local woman East Fremont bar  When she heard staying DTG she said Oh yeah all friends use pool  Vegas kids school summer starting week bound even more crowded   It's also difficult find any shade unless rent cabana  used shaded lounge chairs along west side   now reserved cabana space too  Only few small umbrellas available if score constantly worked around   The restaurant third incarnation  now Freedom Beat  Main change features live music certain times  food fine but service inconsistent since DTG opened  Passing evening man leaving loudly cursing host worst service he'd ever experienced he'd never return  ate once visit without incident but awful service times past basically seated ignored and or food takes way long come once ordered once served ignored    The casino also mixed bag  pleasant smokey music isn't loud servers friendly frequent if tip them decently I think they're best downtown   reasonable table limits good video poker pay tables  But homeless people wander sit down put buck machine wait beer then cash leave  also use bathrooms toilets clean up  some degree problem all casinos but more visible DTG   Casino staff pleasant but often confused rules promotions  lead being told day hadn't checked results soon enough tournament when told Player's Club wait until day so  credit eventually straightened but weekly tournament confusion surprising  Also no could tell benefits other free parking accrue achieving higher tier levels club  Even online link leads Error 404 dead end   They seem aware some issues  Guest Services Manager Director Player Development even came over talked day voiced some concerns servers  apparently differences opinion within management changes needed   So overall if just staying chances you'll happy  If use most facilities may less satisfied  tack on $26 fee now second highest downtown Golden Nugget but don't feel experience improved along rate increases  <EOR> Had great time Feb 2015  Great little neighborhood block Fremont  Pit Bosses engaging asking stay etc  Dont remember happening any strip casino  Sunday Tuesday give 5x rewards slots even if lose buy dinner  rooms clean comfortable  guess some people think its noisy but didnt hear anything wouldnt considered white noise  <EOR> Best service 17th floor  Loved it  Miss Reyna needs promotion   best house keeper there <EOR> Rooms decent price good if free if players club card   Noise problem Freemont street hear bands all night   only ice machines every other floor which pain   room walls seem flush windows easily hear everything going rooms next you   ventilation bad smoke comes through vent   am non smoking floor but stinks   When walk into bathroom smells someone just smoked there   really bad    The casino smells less smokey bathroom which nice   If don't drink lot then place takes forever something drink   45 minutes craps table finally order taken only waitress never bring it   caught 15 minutes later she said thought ordered water    no problem if she wrong drink order but didn't even water she thought ordered   point cashed gamble elsewhere rest trip   If can't free drinks Vegas might well your local indian casino     Most people working floor clearly happy working here   get's worse everytime stay here   hard good time when energy negative   stayed lot but may last time   next trip already booked here  <EOR> I stayed property many times since grand opening   always relatively great time  rooms clean comfortable  amenities changed since first opened but still smell amazing   actually smell better opinion  lot food choices property but plenty close hotel   pool used called picnic now called citrus  bar area free herbs orange lemon trees  gives more natural feel  only complaint pompous taint biscuit made big deal trying leave pool towel windy slightly chilly  elevator room when told needed return pool deck return towel  could believe simple accommodation could made guest  didn't want towel souvenir just didn't want walk through hotel dripping wet bathing suit  towels Egyptian cotton  if don't want walk around your wet swim wear sure bring your own towel home  <EOR> My review prefaced information received great room rate Las Vegas   Check in smooth  Six parties including myself took around 40 minutes  Apparently hotel experiencing 'system upgrade' 2 days   All information input approved manually  assured all credit card information would shredded update complete  representative assisting frazzled terribly informative   Previous reviews stated rooms noisy  true   Hogs Heifer Bar being primary culprit   Earplugs provided   room main building 12th floor   Room requests granted check in because 'system update' check in  ice machine 12th floor broken entire stay 3 nights  aware if want your room cleaned must request it  informed until questioned representative check out  room cleaned once during stay   didn't problem parking garage being connected main building but stairwell smelled urine   aware all Las Vegas hotels charge daily resort fee but hotel doesn't seem offer much $23 charge  exercise room consisted 5 'fair' quality machines no gift shop just adequate pool area  <EOR> For skimmers nice clean new hotel  reserve 5 stars elite give downtown grand 3 5 stars overall    When stay downtown usually hit Nugget  offer 2 comp nights Downtown Grand figured nothing lose! must say pleasantly surprised everything downtown's newest offerings   We arrived 5 30 Saturday no line check in  Having done thorough research knew ask room facing away Fremont good night's sleep  accmodated room Grand tower 7th floor  view nil but didn't care  Peace quiet paramount it    The rooms done well  Modern but basic  Very clean pretty cozy  bed firm which prefer but could used another pillow  No fridge no minibar but 2 complimentary bottles water  Plenty accessible power outlets charge all your devices    First order business shower freshen up  sure you've seen numerous comments open shower bathrooms  must say really confusing design choice  Quite frankly looks way save glass when rehabbed hotel  last thing want Vegas look cheap choosing forgo shower doors does just that  shower pressure weak slightly stronger rainwater   Had good time casino played most night  pounded more share Heineken even dispute over blackjack hand resolved pit boss surveillance quick professional manner  Dealers friendly every employee encountered  Drink service quick casino floor pretty small  Good selections slots denominations didn't feel getting killed  decent live band playing casino floor which great idea   Complimentary coffee commissary Sunday morning welcome relief  traditional room service but room take out  Your food arrives Styrofoam containers bags  Ordered breakfast arrived quick hot  No complaints    I'd say I'd return Downtown Grand if looking stay downtown  felt welcomed valued guest look forward doing all again! <EOR> I definitely back  staff great rooms nice clean good food drink options casino floor  used valet parking loved text valet your car ready time downstairs waiting you  still noise Fremont Street but didn't find much bother  shower also kind weird  There's no shower door just glass covering 1 2 shower wasn't huge fan part  <EOR> This place wonderful Hotel Casino if you're into

Tip Request fridge iron ironing board check in  sure your looking good when hit streets  <EOR> I LOVE PLACE!!!!!! daughter 19 did staycation 1 night lovely time  convenience priceless but many other things worth mentioning  location perfect  Walking distance everything  Local coffee shops donut shop restaurants bars  Fremont block away spent evening people watching! <EOR> This review really only focuses casino   did stay hotel found service rooms just fine but happened casino something never experienced before   third afternoon row play blackjack escape 100+ degree heat   third afternoon inexplicably all tables minimum bet 10 dollars when all 5 dollars previous two afternoons   When asked floor supervisor whether any 5 dollar tables impassive stare told all tables 10 dollar minimum today   Played 10 dollar tables lost impressive amount money over few hours   Moved another 10 dollar table only see woman table playing 5 dollars per bet   When asked she told floor supervisor told she could play 5 dollars at posted 10dollar minimum table    Really unbelievable borderline unethical   course floor supervisor caught bad behavior let everyone table play 5 point while never changing 10 dollar minimum posted   conversation another supervisor rendered only feedback supervisor right those decisions   beware rules same everyone   wonder other rules bend supervisor's whim  <EOR> This review Art Bar Cute little space long couch comfy chairs   Couldn't find art work until Nick pointed ceiling   Cool!  Too funny but ordered wrong drink Mona Lisa    Imagine surprise when picked warm  thought Medori Creme de Menthe   Oops   So nice little bat but no cocktail waiters small menu  <EOR> The Grand very nice hotel located downtown Las Vegas probably best ones area   The place always clean staff friendly rooms updated  The prices super affordable  also free garage parking ticket validation   The only problem if room near Freemont noise ridiculous! Outdoor concerts happening inside your room offer ear plugs lucky am heavy sleeper but besides really enjoy hotel  You could always ask them put room opposite side where noise problem Another thing worth mentioning rooms pretty basic no coffee maker really anything besides TV iron  honest pretty standard Las Vegas anyway example Golden Nugget coffee makers but charge $10 coffee packets     I really enjoy casino well clean less crazies other hotels area  Perfect location if traveling Furniture Market   I would definitely stay again  <EOR> Good place stay if want stay downtown   Simple customer service but exceptional  valet customer service actually spot on! The rooms nice clean updated  Two feather pillows bed may need ask more if want propped watch TV   There continuous humming noise through walls annoying awhile  sounds someone vacumming but wasnt case  could hear loud music Fremont Street Experience through windows 17th floor which only 18 floors   I enjoyed free coffee but walk across street  But Pizza Rock across street fantastic pizza  So all all enjoyed room complimentary items but noise  <EOR> I'm lmao negative reviews   stay everytime Vegas every couple months Only complaint agree thur fri sat loud   Food good staff great  Free slot play tournaments during  day  valet everytime don't know its park public parking really 7 bucks isn't bad  Even though mine free  waiting 15 min car number text let them know your ready leave your car there  Grand usually don't leave except cross street pizza rock  best pizza ever!! Also play enough never pay room valet   wanna complain grand smell  Walk block El cortez never complain grand again <EOR> My family arrived Thanksgiving morning  happy able early check in   hotel beautiful but service sucks  bathroom floor wasn't clean floor needed vacuum  left today bit rooms never cleaned  Called housekeeping before left told done  Well day over room still isn't clean  Manager only offer free coffee which give every morning 6am 10am  happy service    <EOR> WORST HOTEL EVER!!! literally created Yelp account let everyone know unprofessional employees hotel are   I'm going skip big long story rude unprofessional could barely construct sentence without grammatical error just say point where friends left another hotel  manager very briefly spoke incredibly rude  When asked receptionist speak again she would come back out   They care guests see them customers take advantage of  am 22 year old student perhaps would acted more professional if businessman seemed important  WORST HOTEL EVER!  I would give zero stars if could  <EOR> When heard hotel opening while time back really excited promises it  Placed heart Downtown far hotel delivered expectations  live Las Vegas stayed several times since its inauguration  rooms clean brought date  restaurant downstairs offers good variety delicious food along full bar  staff always friendly professional  Recently stayed few days enjoyed pool area  Equipped full bar amazing staff Citrus pool all ingredients very fun and or relaxing time  Depending you're mood for  last visit fortunate enough Jessica server all 3 days when pool  She great making sure food drinks along helping find places sit friends I  surrounding area offers many things but when stay find myself spending most time property itself  Definitely look into hotel your next Las Vegas visit if you're wanted staycation myself  <EOR> Well stayed now three separate times  last time room cleaner bit better but overall experience lacking  just doesn't high end feeling customer service should have  Firstly resort fee ridiculous  amenities justify amount fee period  Slowest internet ever elsewhere able online  second time checked something wrong room last time safe didn't work  wasting two hours checking fixed battery dead want start off stay  Also some crusty stuff padded headboard!! YUK!!! told housekeeping three times  never cleaned  washcloth bathroom    NOT  okay no fridge okay homeless people hanging parking garage right new car! pick booze bottles under around car everyday! Billing all screwed bill manager gave major attitude  okay  Also light burned room entryway  Told front desk when addressed safe  Never changed it! Quality control here  checking rooms!!! things should checked regularly  The only plus location some time! music night loud  if want bed early good luck  Never heard hotel never done anything since started staying here  Even told them stayed 3 times 3 times things okay just ignore us  guess people ignore them  many places stay Vegas way better  bones but obvious management lacking  then heard people laughing bar saying first time made big stink upgraded!!

Located right Fremont street perfect! <EOR> Okay  Nice room   Really nice  whole hotel seems cool classy but check already put bad taste mouth  First time very late asked late check out check pretty early 11AM  told quite coldly can't anything till morning should call before 7am which course defeats purpose getting late checkout sleeping late right? Tried explain concept but just didn't it  ridiculous  Most nice hotels give little leeway especially when check late explain you've never hotel before want enjoy it    NOPE  seen cyborgs more personality  hotel really needs front desk upgrade  Oh course still pay 18 dollar resort fee even though don't really time actually enjoy resort   just might first last stay here   Update back late tonight spoke Roberto work mates does smile seems treat guests air suspicion  Roberto much haggling agreed give extra hour  then asked busy Sunday he gave look just asked if he now ever member communist party  He told harsh tone he's allowed tell busy busy look telling mind own business    Seriously people happened customer service? front desk people smiled welcomed hotel  Told gym pool free internet  Didn't mention there's free water room there's happy hour bar every day  Nothing  might well just checked into kiosk  now instead enjoying hotel all talk bad service is  now writing all let Yelp know all it   If manager reading Please tell your staff smile nice attitude long way  <EOR> Self parking little sketch but text valet your car service awesome   Room super cute larger expected clean didn't smell smoke old hotel which appreciated   It wee bit loud but provided ear plugs case wanted them   TV messed but call front desk fixed reasonable amount time   room great view half block down Fremont close enough yet far away keep craziness Downtown bay   Adorable lobby great little cafe open 24 7 awesome music pumping though place polishing hip vibe   Loved it   Would stay again recommend others well   but shower   It's just weird  <EOR> Well stayed few hotels since Vegas couple months Downtown Grand isn't bad all  very retro feel ocean scenic colors  also some very modern furniture would expect cost room  Flat screen tv full size closet cabinet dresser draws  Basically everything need except refrigerator     The biggest dislikes all those hidden fees  say free internet but believe  part hidden $12 daily hotel fee failed mention  Also there's $50 day hold damages if need be  Also if opt park across street self parking prepared look over your shoulder spooky garage     All all bad downtown Vegas  restaurants lobby consider par rest Grand experience  <EOR> After two night staycation during Valentine's weekend give Downtown Grand thumbs seal approval!  I can't say visited hotel when Lady Luck  stayed enough Downtown hotels little squeamish clean room be  But say meant standards  building still old but rooms kept well bathrooms clean  Booking online opted one bedroom king suite  prices very affordable if your budget allow upgrade  loved spacious living room master room TVs both areas most importantly TWO FULL BATHROOMS  Yes just two but all know much ladies appreciate all counter space guys appreciate seeing all lotions make nicknacks! loved red decor room gave modern vibe  red favorite color  *wink*  We requested quiet room  think being its location very hard hear street noise  5th floor could still hear but enough keep awake  I'd suggest ask very high floor if need more solitude  first hotel provided ear plugs your night stand   Hotel service A OK  requested foam pillows took 1 2 hour  maid did good job daily cleaning  Room service available 24hr cafe downstairs  There's no coffee maker rooms but hotel guests offered complimentary coffee every morning downstairs Commissary where also breakfast lunch bar  casino still resembles much majority Downtown casinos but kept clean orderly  Bartenders dealers friendly location great experience Fremont Experience just valet your car walk everywhere!  did  Man I'd forgotten fun crazy Downtown night life get!

<EOR> Whenever work brings Las Vegas always choose stay Old Town Downtown section because feels much more genuine quiet peaceful much newer overly glitzy hyped Strip section Las Vegas which located 5 miles south  While stayed over years several hotels Old Town Downtown past two years stayed exclusively Downtown Grand which first opened only 2 3 years ago located buildings formerly held old venerable Lady Luck casino hotel million years until closed circa 2012  Downtown Grand then took over property lain unused bit renovated updated very well opinion   I just completed lengthy stay hotel also stayed 10 days back September 2015  prior stay purposely reserved sufficiently high grade room Premium Non Smoking stay could request placed once again higher floor room Grand Tower which taller tower two towers located west side 3rd St  main reasons wanting higher floor room Grand Tower view mountains west also because higher floor rooms tower very quiet  noise Fremont Street nearby outdoor concerts barely reaches rooms    As true first stay hotel few months ago stay great  Check in easy fast rooms large clean housekeepers very friendly helpful  Oh hallways all very wide clean number large very fast elevators available    I am non smoker report even when took shortcuts through casino  which located ground floor hotel east side street  reach street grab taxi really never smelled any tobacco smoke  Likewise whenever eaten meals S O restaurant located also east side street just feet casino never bothered smoke    My check bit past 5 PM which occurred during rather busy time front desk quick smooth effortless  very few hotels which am aware uses very modern front desk check in system also features small touch screen keypad device use customers signing okaying various options during check in  result check in very quick easy  front desk staff always seems very competent quite helpful    The rooms very large least compared size hotel rooms back East Coast  bathrooms hotel rooms also very large    The main in house food meal options aside room service ordering aforementioned S O restaurant located near casino ground floor hotel east side 3rd street Commissary located ground floor west side 3rd street  hotel also operates steak house called something Triple George just few feet down 3rd St  Commissary also leases space large rather famous pizza restaurant yes slices also    located bit further down street Triple George steak house  hotel also leases space rather large biker bar located between steak house pizza restaurant   BTW if crave brains must tell sadly NEITHER restaurant located inside hotel offers any brain dishes nor Triple George steakhouse nor nearby Pizza Rock pizza restaurant  shame!

Although probably little more expensive some other hotels Downtown $120 night + $11 resort fee feel though great value money  pretty well located right across Gold Spike near Mob Bar Pizza Rock    The hotel itself very modern clean  definitely spent some time effort remodel shows  very close being boutique hotel  Getting into valet area little confusing guess two towers  but those small things  Check smooth easy   The room itself really pretty! isn't very large room but decor very lovely  Everything overall clean but pretty big red stain right door as if someone spilled paint never came carpet   large flat screen tv lots channels bed very comfortable  also provide earplugs which thought great touch since does pretty loud downtown  they weren't very effective but good idea anyway    The only downside room bathroom  While looked very modern inviting really wasn't practically designed  shower particularly poorly set up  only 1 2 glass door back half shower open  unpleasant few reasons  One felt never hot steamy shower! Even though water warm enough shivered through shower because draft coming open space   Two having open shower means water gets floor! wasn't flood anything but bit irritating   sink also very practically designed  those large shallow sinks rather deep sink which also meant water splashed counter if need full basin water isn't happening    The beds pillows very comfy but don't give blanket bedspread comforter  sure could called down housekeeping but wish provided somewhere room    One other thing pretty neat text down valet your ticket number bring your car around! send reply text ETA when come appointed time your car awaits! thought great service hope catches all hotels   We also visited 24 hour sportsbook deli cafe wee hours night quick meal  delicious! just fries sandwiches I ham egg cheese croissant really yummy    Overall did enjoy Downtown Grand I'd stay again! but please redesign those showers! <EOR> Very nice hotel  Recently updated  great stay  Wish bath tubs especially half marathon even hot tub  really nicely updated  Loved staying downtown  first fun  Restaurant breakfast fantastic  <EOR> My husband somehow received complementary 2 night stay coupon mail since cousins 21st birthday thought heck lets try it  am super picky person before already decided going dislike because off negative reviews read yelp   Boy wrong Downtown Grand excellent hotel staff super friendly accommodating  love text valet 5 minutes your car ready go  shower glass panel little funky but look pass that  definitely recommended hotel  staying future such great feel decor super chic    My husband such great weekend thank downtown grand!!!!! <EOR> The worst rooms service house keeping downtown Las Vegas  Absolutely least accommodating hotel ever stayed at  First would cancel 7 day reservation once found ugly rooms none good views way  Then moved another room threatened charge canceling   the receptionists security then proceeded evict when lost temper when gave non working keys new room  D right next door stay anywhere besides downtown grand  <EOR> 2 nights Sunday Monday $99 total billion fees   don't trust any prices quoted  Very clean new refurbished 2nd tower where wife honeymooned  bed seemed newish room clean art decor kinda flair  modern clean stylish  Staff minimal   Location beginning Fremont Street Experience   Which fun very short easy walk around area  wasn't any riffraff but downtown original Las Vegas being revitalized  city spent some money area  obvious  strip nice but quite different feel downtown Las Vegas  Each area should enjoyed   We room 1938 newer 2nd tower  didn't eat hotel gamble can't comment there  took away 1 star because lack friendliness welcoming establishment  own business am quite friendly customers  understand far courtesy respect patrons goes!

I saw lot reviews complaining check in process staff rude but pleasant experience every single person spoke with  entire staff grade opinion  Checking in super smooth room really clean  non smoker requested higher floor way smell nice view  very sensitive nose hardly noticed smoke even walking through casino  put quiet side hotel since music Freemont Street loud but still heard  don't think there's any avoiding but wasn't loud enough disrupt sleep  24th floor  There's free earplugs nightstand but no need them  beds very comfortable 2 queens unlimited free water  didn't eat restaurants but requested mini fridge extra cost since brought own food  Coffee drinkers could $1 cup downstairs restaurants unlimited refills until 10am   The only downsides hotel are mini fridge dented door broken but sure would've replaced bothered ask no coffee pots room there's only SHOWER DOOR! sure because many drunk people kept falling through! Wasn't necessarily problem just weird water all over floor  All all hotel very pleasant definitely staying again    Normally don't leave reviews but figured more people take time leave negative rather positive took lot time researching all destinations specific trip  If review helpful next glad could help Also trouble finding maps  searched Mob Museum maybe next person try Lady Luck Hotel Casino since prior name  <EOR> The development team 3rd Downtown did Old Lady Luck proud revamping property   Downtown Grand Las Vegas great hotel casino offering tons gaming dining options   limits reasonable prices food exceptional   many people know open but sure visitors pick once word gets around   would visit place again   probably free room based previous play   would appreciated     If you're Downtown Las Vegas must visit Downtown Grand Las Vegas! <EOR> Huh  dunno if just takes property couple weeks some reason complaint review whatever but eventually did Choice points stay paired off another stay bonus points <EOR> This review 2nd stay Downtown Grand  Both times very good experiences  very nice clean smoky casino  great food drink specials $3 hamburgers $2 Domestic bottles $1 16 oz Daiquiris! pool very nice though VERY cold  Service bartenders exceptional  Valet awesome  don't understand some poor reviews  Obviously Valet free when stayed but also free when just came play once  ability text when want your car texted when ready awesome  rooms nice except shower half door  only thing keeps giving 5 stars Front Desk  workers nice pleasant but only staffed 2 people during check check out  Why understaff both busy times?

Everywhere hotel new clean inviting!  arrived 11pm check in naturally very smoothly   room well above expectations   concerned noise Freemont St but higher floor didn't notice any noise as others reviewed but free ear plugs add nice touch   walk hotel Freemont St  short block well lit well traveled route indeed felt safe  self park garage just across street much shorter walk any self parking hotels strip  pool area awesome!  Very comfortable chairs crammed all together strip hotel pools tend be   All public restrooms beautifully renovated   We'll definitely back wished could've stayed remainder trip! <EOR> I'm rather torn whether should 3 4 star review  really time being I'd say its probably 3 5  I remember back year 2000 when first stepped foot Lady Luck  place pretty foul run down toilet casino  Still did couple fond memories winning some money when brothers visited road trip Phoenix time  Well fast forward February 2006 when closed Lady Luck  sat many years becoming carcass casino famously referred Oscar Goodman   glad hear doing something place when remodel began   Well since time couple times MUCH nicer remember Lady Luck  casino floor quite small  small variety slots including Family Guy machine giggety video poker well also fair amount tables  William Hill Sportsbook deli nearby    I haven't seen rooms eaten any food outlets yet  Although sure back try something days  seem alot specials locals available time time   My experiences far been  Machines peeled money faster could say Awww shi    those things set tighter frogs ass! People Valet Cage very friendly nice   especially guys Valet Kind blows no self parking available   valet only    All all place huge improvement over Lady Luck love seeing continued revitalization Downtown but place kind small theres nothing really set apart other options around town even Fremont    But back sometime   its   OK    3 5 stars <EOR> I love location Grand never any problems incident there  think Best Hotels Vegas  just opinion  <EOR> Stayed 4 nights  Check good check good  Food options adequate  Hotel room well appointed clean other few stains carpet  carpet some light coloring need clean room carpets more often  bed super pillows  request additional hangers wardrobe handled very quickly request additional bottles water  room very large desk area good work  eleveators all working well free morning coffee ground floor nice touch  Now    why only 3 stars??? #1 = much night time noise Freemont Street area concerts    even ear plugs nightstand late loud  #2 = wi fi worked well morning afternoon but bogged bit evenings  Perhaps need improved allocation management tool someone streaming movie doesn't take much wi fi bandwidth slow down others  Overall    things good hotel but Freemont Street noise music might limit return visit  <EOR> Great stay! 2 nights course hear noise ppl party Vegas! <EOR> It's sad give two stars stayed before loved it    First rooms great! However new management owners now nickle dime everything! Also sugar coated told parking free receipt  commissary but failed mention spend $10 day  Mind pool where group spent over $100 200 day doesn't count towards this  The blonde cocktail waitress heart glasses fabulous point  next day another waitress all sudden policies day prior changed  She also completely ignored area several times paid more attention young 20 year old kids   fail considering actually jobs afford drink  totally would've more beverages if weren't ignored much tipped big  bad she assumed group 36 year olds cheap tip  Unfortunately she 10% person tips 20% normal basis because lack consideration   Also asked pool boys if could move umbrella he said yeah long no using it  When friend started move umbrella security guard came told no explained asked pool boy  He then proceeded interrogate hasking name explained didn't know name but he wearing pool boy outfit bussing empties back bar  He basically calling liar don't appreciate when guest    The bell boys fantastic valet awesome servers diner down stairs awesome Saturday night Art Bar bartender awesome   Your communication skills your guests blows result end paying things surprise  think totally staying elsewhere now should consider too  <EOR> This place alright if your looking cheap trip Las Vegas  stay work convention but only smoking rooms left when definitely booked non smoking  I didn't even know smoking rooms still existed   staff helpful could but best experience  <EOR> Really enjoyed stay hotel   def could say lost looking room least 5 times    second floor then walk across different section catch different elevator    thank later <EOR> I thought good price through travelocity website but charges started adding up  stayed several days  $20 day resort fees for pool access which closed season coffee tea morning until 10 11am access gym small 2 bottles water per day spotty wifi we tried using but useless I asked them if still pay full amount since wanted use pool but said closed season  didnt 2 bottles water per day room  We also didnt tea coffee use small gym but didnt feel need mention   He told still pay  Ridiculous   Also valet $7 day stay  hotel casino does direct access garage parking cross streets which hassle dangerous! Some nights really loud music concerts  why provide ear plugs only pair bedside table guess    The room clean modern design but think would going other hotels preferrably closer Strip next time  <EOR> Right center downtown everything 5 minute walk away  price rooms outstanding modern  Wish tables open longer  Valet bell super quick kind  <EOR> You know REALLY cranky?  Condescending people front desk hotel  faint heart   Nor am pansy  However Vegas wedding  start shower guess what?  no hot water  take cold shower call front desk  tell they're going send someone right up  Really?  standing room nothing trying ready wedding time come room fix shower  ask guy send someone 2 when gone  He tells he would  back room 10 30 pm guess what?  still no water  worst part?  No  worst part snarky manager less apologetic wanted send someone room 10 45 pm  No thanks  tired just want sleep  Lucky person sitting next plane won't taking shower morning thanks lovely hotel  yourself favor  way many hotels Vegas waste your money raggedy hotel  <EOR> I'm very happy see new casino join downtown family shows Vegas coming back people really care downtown!  From walking property before dinner saw mixture plaza Cosmo decor the lobby bar screams Hipster all art ceiling   casino rather boutique ton machines tables which I'd rather lot low ceiling crammed Fremont St joints    I dined Ogden cafe some friends wasn't impressed  average entre price $15 but portion quality didn't worth it  Granted always adjusting menu but seemed bit pricey got  decor wonderful atomic furnishings colors!  As open other areas casino review could easily four stars  concept pool upper level picnic area  <EOR> It first time staying last night seeing $20 special hotel tonight app honestly would definitely given them 4 star because hotel really clean nice modern feel rooms larger expected everything seemed perfect especially $20 deal purchased  However SEVERAL issues service really picky all   First check took 25 minutes even though very next line Tuesday night  hotel dead  Second ordered Room Take   little confused title because didn't any sense but turns food comes styrofoam to go containers plastic bag  did receive any utensils napkins  No problem things happen sometimes forget but when asked some he replied Oh don't normally that  Huh?! Okay   so used hand towels room napkins    Next bottle wine forgot bring opener home guy told don't give napkins utensils asked if could borrow wine bottle opener he told front desk could help that  Again sell bottles wine weird take room dining service don't understand why couldn't just borrow one  called front desk explained said only bottle opener lent another room haven't received back  Okay honestly bottle opener whole hotel? load bullshit  Just tell don't lend them out! Then most ridiculous things ever heard told take bottle downstairs + O bars open then take back room  What?!?! Then starting annoyed said really want walk downstairs your hotel open wine bottle? can't just borrow places told send up?? he said no! Oh goodness   ended doing since didn't even receive knife room take out  Then morning when received car valet saw worker kick door open car completely hyperextending leg making door almost hit car! he just looked if way!  Overall good room stay night cheap but heaven forbid if need something guess you're luck  never given such weird excuses horrible service! Maybe don't realize Vegas enormous amout competition?

 It very loud night due music several bars clubs same street plays plan accordingly  Parking structure block away hotel lobby different building prepared walk  <EOR> Worst possible room experience   Incredibly loud Music felt room iuntil 3 00 am literally pounding   could tell every song lyrics   need step double paned Windows   Horrible night   Woman phone rude snooty even though husband super low key   She said couldn't move rooms   Also said posted web site referencing motorcycle event no doubt but motorcycle noise problem   flimsy windows music killer   way can't find any mention any noise motorcycle event web site she also apparently  does speak truth   Horrible horrible horrible!  Also hold 20 minutes when hung without answering   No coffee maker other amenities   Pretty decor but ruined noise  <EOR> I serious health issues asked late checkout which done several other times Monday Vegas refused without them even trying work me  Resort fee way more most  90% pool deck reserved there's really nowhere actually enjoy pool  better experience literally any other hotel stayed Vegas  <EOR> This hotel just okay Nothing really bad but nothing really great either  Some customer service team did great job helping giving free upgrade providing quiet room upon request  truly appreciate that  But some customer service cleanliness issues   Unfortunately fell little under weather during stay  bought some Theraflu but needed hot water order drink it  When called down front desk ask if some hot water could brought room told no without any explanation  thought little strange given staying hotel more week  down Freedom hot water myself order take medicine   Lastly wife found holes sheets during last night stay  disappointing because very late tired inform anyone   Like said location just okay  terrible  But wife already decided won't back  <EOR> Overall stay ok  stayed 5 days 4 nights room clean decent looking  casino bars looked nice although didn't utilize any them  few negatives me  Small ones charge $8 per night valet even guests  Although validate self parking which across street  Also charge $15 refrigerator your room  lighting room also odd because big stand mirror near front door dim lighting which isn't close mirror  rest lighting only being lamps  restroom nice king size bed comfortable  main reasons giving 2 star due having issues wifi sink being clogged  Also mostly due calling bellhop several times 45 minutes waiting without ETA decided just bring stuff down ourselves  Which difficult due amount stuff 2 people carry down  Excluding those negatives consider hotel average above average amenities  Would've rated hotel 3 stars if wasn't issues  <EOR> The Grand grand! Love set up  casino exposed catwalks eye sky used before casinos modern surveillance cameras  semi Chicago mob theme but modernized  Service good everyone seems smiling interact guests well  Now food CHEESECAKE!

The hotel itself MASSIVE two towers  warned if don't want cardio walk workout then stay Grand Tower trek valet hotel entrance! Also fantastic nightly rate but tacked $11 day mandatory resort fee which basically wifi though includes coupons various restaurants free bottled water room taxes rate ended amazing initially thought though $60 total night when all said done still decent rate kind hotel   The room great! king room bed super comfy set cozy but amazingly functional being 21st flr great view! also having love affair pillows! neck usually dread lumpy impossibly small pillows become new hotel standard but four amazingly plump large just delicious pillows all myself practically made myself pillow fort!   The bathroom roomy complementary toiletries fantastic Bee Kind products made real honey they smelled amazing!   only thing didn't shower didn't door shower curtain just half glass pane  afraid floor would flood didn't but showermat towel did overly soaked plus kind uncomfortable a c air crept even though showering running hot still chill   The pool wasn't yet open which shame because looked place above  also minimal fitness center ellipticals treadmills but much more  did ask water bottles supposed room both days but bellman kind enough some first night housekeeper second  staff especially valet bell desk very accommodating nice though girl check in bit dry cold  awesome thing where if valet your car QR your ticket txt your ticket number text back instantly number minutes take your car curbside  used 3 times all three times clockwork! gotta love technology when works!!

No complaints!I stayed 17th floor  Fremont minute walk hotel being said hear music night  did complimentary ear plugs but didn't need them  Even though noisy you're Vegas!

Even malls restaurants offer free valet   stayed downtown grand past valet free   Its money really its principle   nickle diming guests   Parking should included  $20+ resort fee     The website booked through stated parking free assumed valet still free   Well only self parking free!  If don't want pay valet park dirty smelly garage drag your luggage across street hotel follow ridiculous other ways free valet     Also why only thin blanket between two sheets only two pillows?!

The Hotel really come along way years past  only thing haven't done updated parking structure which detached across street  very very small elevator which absolutely disgusting mess very dirty dated smelled pretty awful     parking levels littered trash well empty beer cans bottles food stuffs jus filthy!  really didn't want nice car parked location another world compared hotel  offer valet service but didn't want anyone driving vehicle pretty sure don't park valet parked cars across street parking structure   Not time did see security parking structure checked car several times 24 hours parked  lot questionable people lurking around parking structure both street level various levels structure really needs attention visible security!!    The hotel did fact validate parking ticket free  Upon attempting  leave parking garage using validated parking ticket self service automated  machine attempted charge think 12 bucks more wouldn't lift parking control arm no person working booth  basically  holding  your car hostage waiting payment   I reinserted validated ticket several times machine finally released its clutches control arm lifted could escape without being strong armed into paying use credit card which would only way pay guess can't remember if money slot payment   Bottom line just didn't feel safe parking garage  bad forgot portion hotel      won't park again!! sure where would park would need further investigate other possibilities simply put without safe clean parking garage could keep staying great hotel future   The garage filled Sarurday nite very packed cars   The walking distance hotel just across street parking structure freemont street easy fast using pedestrian corridor well lighted   Can't location  hotel but beware parking structure         Check very slow 300 pm 330 pm  Saturday only two reps working counter but check quick 4 5 reps 11am Sunday morning   All charges matched quoted confirmed booking          If parking structure  elevator gets attention good steam cleaning daily maintenance along visible security hotel would deserve five star plus rating   My wife brought some food room hotel's restaurants 230am absolutely great hot fresh no issues eggs potatoes sausage pancakes syrup whipped butter club sandwich delicious   There it        Be mindful your surroundings if choose use parking structure   That's it!!       <EOR> We decided stay past Saturday night while celebrating birthday  room very nice spacious  recommend over all hotels downtown  Hence newer decor pretty upscale least area  bed pillows very comfortable  However others agree resort fee $20 control unnecessary  well daily valet charge which $10 when checked then $5 following day  mean you're better off staying strip!

Truthfully expecting much since 10 15min drive away Vegas Strip but wasn't bad  actually save lot money almost every hotel free self parking heck  If you're trying save some money while still trying fun then place good place because pretty nice  <EOR> We stayed between Dec  25th 27th   some things Downtown Grand right most part modern decor gave hotel nice feel   However weren't fans orange walls hallways hotel room floors   couple oddities place ultimately left bad taste mouth resulted 2 star review 1  no lot self parking only valet   Granted valet free however HUGE issue during busiest hours   When checked took hour car because many people checking same time valet attendants retrieve everyone's cars same time   mind shudders think happened visitors ended missing flight due fact took long them cars!  nice able text valet attendants before coming down pick your car but still no idea long exactly it'll before your car ready you   2  order check hotel need wait same line waited check in   don't one   many other hotels check via in room TV drop your hotel keys drop box   Why everyone required wait line just check out? <EOR> After all years visiting Vegas finally found favorite place stay  two minute walk Fremont street even closer favorite pizza joint Pizza Rock  rooms very affordable super clean  shuttle strip stops front which very nice  love hotel can't wait back  <EOR> This place really nice   people friendly courteous casino little smaller side restaurants well so   However downtown establishment quite nice! <EOR> I stayed 2 nights because very close course UNLV dental school taking over weekend    Location Just block down Fremont Street right next Gold Spike! easily walk places downtown  car able back forth strip  parking garage Downtown Grand charges parking if aren't guest but since validated  Valet also free but mean strip already process charging valet parking MGM properties might eventually spread!    Front lobby staff other yelpers say really slow  think first line waiting 3 people front desk standing over 5 minutes  guy worked checked really nice though  just found really funny odd when he asked 3 separate occasions span 3 minutes many cards need your room? He didn't even ask way where he trying apologize he forgot  He asking if he never asked question before   lady checking next looked chucked she noticed going through    Casino stuff hotel casino itself pretty small  didn't really care much going since always out   just sleeping purposes  little restaurant bar pretty nice swimming pool though!  Room Very clean! bed comfy big pillows very soft  even liked could extend table your nightstand place more stuff  found no issues room itself  perfect!   Bathroom really liked style shower  similar shower hotel stayed Chicago half glass shower door but think hotel shoulda considered making shower head come straight down ceiling avoid splashes outside other people complain reviews  think only complaint would sink because while does nice design noticed water splashing sink when washed face brushed teeth    I never issues going sleep sound going outside  But just may because night arrived late hotel ready sleep baby    Overall verdict If you're looking hotel affordable great quality highly recommend place! <EOR> We regular room 2 queens   room very large which nice but should really think getting larger TV   bed can't read even 20 20 vision  shower others mentioned only glass side door  mean only half door half water ends floor   Also solid glass door doesn't slide  short people can't barely reach around door turn water   if put shower hot?  Well burn your arm turn down   think hotel going modern look but should really functional shower     As mentioned whole lot space room   would think all space could $50 fridge room   coffee maker microwave would nice   They provide ear plugs noise outside   didn't seem bad but stayed weekday winter   Valet staff incredibly nice free valet   Oh yes hotel two towers   should really think color coding   Many    and mean MANY people lost trying hotels rooms   Including us   Then asked non English speaking maid she no idea another tower   Crazy mess   I guess all okay   would probably try another hotel next time  <EOR>     Ok admit stayed couple weeks ago   and   I really it   prices very reasonable did very good job remodel   very good   that said also stayed when Lady Luck well lot less pot smoke air time   hey don't look just say'n    <EOR> Not bad good   Rooms just basic nothing write home but clean   Front desk guy very nice made check very easy   think name Keith   Casino just okay   No action going but good enough wife   Very small casino strike charging valet    Come grand staying your hotel least cover valet   May back sure      <EOR> I grew family Vegas   mom's aunt uncle semi pro gamblers spent 80s learning keno Binion's bingo Sam's Town   being said love downtown   am going lie every stay wistfully long 1 99 steak eggs 50 cent keno Binion's but gas crisis over Reagan gone those days long past   Nonetheless stay downtown every other trip Vegas   Almost always Nugget appeases wife Strip like hotel   But time sought variety and deal Downtown Grand     Sure old dumpy ass Lady Luck   But redone nice   Don't let earplugs your room fool pretty nice room cheap drinks downtown and free drinks tables lobby slept heavily intoxicated baby  Remember smoking baby Indonesia?  slept that    We stayed premium tower beautifully red corner room seriously huge   Added bonus wife great view across street where filming some semi pro porn video another tower  No seriously she took pictures    pool area super nice liked free water room because know screwed stuff everywhere else    Ok why 5 stars?  seemed little short staff when checked only valet working waited half hour unload luggage   only two people working checkout long line   Despite all left pretty happy   definitely would stay again  <EOR> Nice place but definitely inconvenient   Loud shit too   No wonder maid placed earplugs nightstand every night   didn't eat use any amenities   If wouldn't smoking mobile hotels com discount would stay here  <EOR> The Downtown Grand just that Grand   Formerly Lady Luck property completely gutted remodeled modernized  Grand swanky hipster chic  all Vegas hotel casino combos tables games card games multiple slots sing dance light up  Grand also hosts Art Bar pro tip look when drinking them down Mob Bar several little decked spots casino floor  small diner located property Stewart Ogden Red Mansion which only open select nights host several awesome locally owned establishments across street Pizza Rock Triple George Hogs Heifers various other awesome places within reasonable walking distance   What's really cool Grand signs telling which direction places located  PROPS! Grand's pool called Picnic free access when staying which faux grass kid friendly variety specials   The rooms did disappoint either  $63 night you're furnished awesome views city large king bed large flat screen tv free wifi because downtown tends loud ear buds  rooms also updated modern touch until bathrooms  No big tub no fan when boo boo isn't anything really special    All all Grand great value just block heart downtown  <EOR> Everyone amazing  room clean beds comfortable only reason giving 5 stars being able hear others flushing only having ice machines odd numbered floors   Rafeal Brandon bell service  great  Skylar checked great suggestions   dealers Rick Adrian really nice too   Every person talked fun helpful very personable  <EOR> I stayed hotel casino tower high floor room 1535   Perfect location everything including pool casino restaurants lobby Freemont experience  Almost requirement sleep when bedtime other parts hotel LOUD ear plugs your room but didn't need them once Positives The price paid $39 00 non smoking king bed room early June    Rooms rooms underwent great remodel nicer finishes  Rooms look refreshed updated  comfortable items would expect including safe complimentary bottled water hairdryer shampoo conditioner lotion soap plenty room your stuff  some complaints positioning shower head location water temperature  didn't experience those issues perhaps showered early enough arms longer turn shower without getting wet   Location If downtown perfect  walk everywhere easy find your way  Literally next door Freemont experience Mob museum many great little casinos restaurants  Personally El Cortez gambling downtown but just where best luck most fun   The pool Holy cow  Unexpected downtown  perfect  Lots shade too  early morning opens 9 00 avoid party crowds heavenly   Staff super nice accommodating  Really great here   NEGATIVES Room cleaning towels Every third day  Um what? am probably spoiled but want room tidied fresh towels everyday  Very disappointing although supposed more green   Casino Small small small  Really if just want roll your pjs gamble free morning coffee commissary then fine  If want game selection   explore  some bigger ones close by  knew small but REAL small   Pillows AC Pillows Hard rocks  AC blasts all time no matter set on  mean it   is 112 degrees outside   but literally cover head blanket didn't pneumonia that bit dramatic but idea    Food two words Pizza Rock  right across casino floor  slice whatever late night when tastes best icy cold cherry coke  heavenly promise  other two just ok   the commissary + O  Didn't Hogs Heifers Steakhouse   Cab fare airport $40 tip  High  think town car same price sweat death cab line upon arrival  Bellagio around $28   Promotions New guests coupon book but really impressive  $5 free play getting card  should better considering small casino little people seem win there   So short would absolutely stay again  love location much rates super reasonable  love strip but totally different experience  If love downtown give shot  <EOR> We checked 1 00am two young kids long road trip see family area   first pulled front hotel valet told pay parking   If eating gambling would validate parking but if actually staying hotel!  followed directions around back park check in prior self parking   pulled could hear super loud music club across street loud motorcycles mention whole area reeked weed   When checked asked quieter side hotel clerk simply said nothing available quiet side   decided see bad bags brought room   When room just loud standing street!  fact room actually came two sets foam earplugs nightstand!!  told noise least until 3 00am every night   No going sleep walls rattling turned around lugged own luggage back down car demanded refund   clerk begrudgingly refunded resort fee brief fight Hotels com able full refund   If intend sleep all night place stay  <EOR> The views 18th Floor Amazing everything else sucked   bathroom sink hair left over front previous occupant   Light bulbs morning when asked some basic toiletries none available   think average motel 6 better experience   There's veneer nice hotel top but starts feel trashy pretty soon thereafter  <EOR> Still awesome next stay but did hear thump music room late  did see ear plugs night stand morning wish I'd seen them before  13th floor opposite bars still clearly heard bass thump  Going back two weeks update then  <EOR> i'll short feel if spend more 1000 words describing experience probably say wrong things Th place noisy night its middle Old Vegas theres plenty hookers walking streets theres few slots activities Hotel grounds no coming back  <EOR> The room nice front desk staff nice valet friendly but when came room service where problem was   ordered room service O restaurant when brought food wrong order  forever then wait forever again receive right order   But hey least fish good    <EOR> I liked Downtown Grand lot  While directly off Fremont quieter very short walk all action  If riding DEUCE off Fremont Street Experience Stewart @ 4th  latter closer stop but some lazy bus drivers try end route Fremont if you're only left bus   The lobby really nice without being pretentious overdone  casino small but no problem since gamble no more $5 10 per visit Las Vegas   My room 16th floor casino tower pretty much perfect  Spacious clean newly remodeled only minor complaints shower low water pressure overly efficient showerhead sink completely flat very shallow splashed quite bit tricky fit cup bottle under faucet    I stayed 4th July weekend hotel hosted special BBQ pool deck which way only rooftop pool downtown   food selection great definitely money's worth  customarily barbecues every Friday evening   During visit ate Pizza Rock across street S+O Stewart Odgen off casino floor happy both  Pizza Rock very overpriced but food ambiance worth it  S+O obviously budget oriented shows but $9 99 prime rib can't beat   This first time staying downtown experience Downtown Grand definitely encourages again  <EOR> My family stayed Downtown Grand past week  lobby very clean modern along room  stayed deluxe room two full size beds flat screen tv  no coffee pot mini fridge rooms   There enclosed bridge connects two towers    It within walking distance Freemont Street Container Park highly recommend if traveling kids MOB Museum which nice  did read another Yelp review if traveling toddler baby best request room opposite side Freemont Street being very loud hear bands DJ's playing throughout night  took advice since daughter 1 5 years old  asked further room when booked stay well requested crib pack n' play daughter sleep in    The reason given Downtown Grand 3 stars because told pack n' play would set room arrival date  wasn't called front desk 5 30 pm once unpacked told little behind but should way 20 min  No big deal    Then 20 min turned into 3 HOURS   I called twice within those 3 hours told should room shortly  When didn't happen down front desk complain  time daughter VERY tired ready bed  apologized gave $20 credit Freedom Bar Restaurant downstairs  didn't leave room first night due thinking would miss them bringing pack n' play up  very inconvenient    Reason number 2 pool very nice family oriented BUT almost half white metal couches didn't any cushions  if late scramble find other small pillows piece together put metal couches  if don't want sit turf hard metal couch frame should pool soon opens  <EOR> I'll keep brief I reservation booked 2 months   Upon arrival told no nonsmoking rooms available put smoking optional room  Really really thin walls   think could hear guy next door unwrapping condom package    I could see light next room under door   Pool roof top area fantastic   Hours 9 am 7 pm which isn't very late considering still 102 degrees 7 pm   closed early private party nights   resort fee non negotiable but included resort fee them apparently No self parking   used using texting option every time need your car   valets working crazy efficient   Mattress pillow hard   Tiny useless alarm clock   Nice big TV   Free WiFi which good but waaayyyy slow   planned getting work done night wound having leave find another place finish work   Lost  few hours due this   Maid service FANTASTIC   Super clean every morning   Stewart Ogden's great   Eat OMG burger     Casino pretty standard casino   No standing handing money   Overall place clean sharp new   Overall though funny awkward underlying feeling place just couldn't put finger on  <EOR> I sent survey

issues when checking in   am told mistake would honor promotion  provided copy web page offering deal along reservation   told toooooo bad  taking money elsewhere  <EOR> Will never ever ever stay again many reasons  wish I'd read Yelp reviews before booking staying    1 hotel most awkward street ever 2 pulled valet realized don't cash  Told valet gentleman he said park across street lot free  3 Played chicken across street  Remember hotel awkwardly located 4 lot realize as going higher more unsafe looks  5 call hotel FOUR DAMN TIMES pressing 3 reach concierge assistance  hold while rings maybe 10 15 minutes  Call back press zero operator   takes lobby where check in  asked if offer free valet let know don't cash  She tells valet guy supposed tell charge placed hotel tab  Le sigh   6 take frickin parking ticket car leave parking lot  But without paying 8 frickin dollars park 9 04 9 22  WTF!!!! 7 played chicken back across street  Pull valet see same guy  He's oh your back!! explain happened he's all yeah! put your tab  Sorry! should pressed help button garage without paying   Seriously bro?  8 lobby check in  Wait line 10 minutes  Check person same person spoke phone  Tell $8  She's all oh could pressed help button sorry didn't tell phone  complete eff!!!!! 9 talk manager tell pleased  Said dispute charge parking apologized  Great something else need do  No let waive your valet night  Nothing  Sigh  Whatever   10 trek room  Fine   11 opened door fucking tv turns itself loud fuck  Scared shit me  Why HELL would hotel automatic bullshit night!?!?!!! 12 hate room  Looks weird 13 all 40 minutes itched entire time  sure if sheets but am Itchy AF   take Benadryl   14 no enclosure shower  Just half glass window near front   15 room dark even lights on  only light bathroom dark too     I absolutely no confidence stay improve tomorrow  wish could home now but can't  never stay again  Cali native Vegas numerous times honestly think hotel worst experienced date  <EOR> Ah artist *cough* mean building formerly known Lady Luck    I know place aunt worked when she first moved Vegas way back 80s  remember wandering around quite few times young as teen wandered around Fremont St  general really   garish smoky monstrosity inside pink tube lighting mirrored walls ceilings  yet outside basically just looked big ol' office building  still strange charm though    Then closed  sat  Idle  almost 10 years  2013 FINALLY reopened Downtown Grand   It's nice corner no longer dark idle  also nice active 3rd Street Corridor leading Fremont Stewart where Mob Museum is  LOVE exterior  just adore Gilded Age Roaring Twenties influence going for   And yet upon walking expectations fell kinda flat  definitely expecting something akin exterior 20s sort vibe yet felt very sterile  can't quite put finger but something just seemed missing place   I would open returning it's probably inevitable way since spend quite few friday nights just wandering place place around Fremont anyway   rooms look fantastic heard lot's good things Mob Bar enjoy little Downtown 3rd area  popped but beyond eh   The Final Verdict  Pros Enticing exterior Helping rejuvenate vicinity Appealing rooms lounges  Cons The fun exterior just doesn't translate well interior    Return Factor 7 10 <EOR> a true value dedicated friendly people working there   first time older section

Definitely visiting downtown grand again! <EOR> Nice pool well heated perfect only downfall most off chairs reserved even though no during weekdays  Wonder why reserved? However didn't look menu anything  Just happy some tan before work! <EOR> What surprise! Id when lady luck great done place  would say easily 2nd best hotel downtown Vegas   Staff very friendly accommodating  stayed suite room nicely appointed  well suited vegas  <EOR> Well first review 2014  2016 apparently judged IF gamble but MUCH $$$!  wasn't receiving emails mailers anymore couldn't believe answers three times told no longer receiving offers because don't gamble ENOUGH $$$! stayed once per month two years lost hundreds each stay   When customers only count because much spend   and frequent stays mean nothing? don't feel valued customer feel cast aside loosing enough money!   Sad sad sad because really liked it  <EOR> Not horrible but nothing call home about   First off self parking free! But yourself favor skip spend money valet  self parking garage monitored security at least dozen times since DG opened never seen single security guard stairs access among everywhere else garage frequently used bathroom drunk people watch puddles unless you're into that   also find plenty beer bottles drink glasses solo cups empty cans etc really wonder if want leave your car place people driving around there  There's sign casino near front says many gaming points need earn parking charges valet included waived  sure if your best return investment you'd gamble $100+ save $5 parking    The casino cute very industrial feeling  small doesn't lot table games  seem remember more being when opened but last time appeared most replaced video slot machines    Hotel rooms eh  They're remodeled but very budget fashion  Yes showers only  Yes shower weird glass door doesn't close floor wet  beds pretty thin flat  But if going comfort wouldn't staying here  resort fee yes Vegas nickel dime everything  yes agree resort fee when book room  However doesn't mean can't say don't agree value it  couple bottles water access pool worth $20 day  If stay strip even some other places downtown pay similar resort fee 100x value it  use it? Maybe  But again back fact you're staying because cheap means probably just want drunk crash leave  should least waive valet charges  Ice machines every other floor odd numbers believe     Then there's Pizza Rock which must visit if quality pizza  course if you're local now Green Valley Ranch which 1000x nicer place Downtown Grand  bad none hotel food offers include Pizza Rock    Honestly decent place crash night  If want better experience spend few more bucks stay Fremont  spend couple more bucks stay strip your dollar lot farther there    Will going back?
