Cheers <EOR> Food probably 3 5 stars but customer service sucks  Also someone already stated many vegetarian options except falafel plate lentil soup salads  Would liked more selection vegetarian plates    Didn't charging policy poor customer service   Just note 20 % compulsory gratuity if party 11 even separate checks  charge 1 00 more sauce when falafel comes sauce should more i e  they're skimping sauce  normally sauce included Greek places plastic squeeze bottle especially prices charging food if item ordered should come sauce more it!!  could understand if food ordered didn't sauce part it   I ordered falafel plate specifically asked them falafels dry  asked them put more water use much oil whatever could falafels more moist hate dry falafels but instead thinking offer more tahini sauce skimp top charge 1 00 more sauce should included falafel plate first place!!    When falafel plate barely any tahini sauce  asked same sauce falafel he gave white sauce which guess thazini sauce  he came tahini brown sauce when mentioned sauce didn't want  wanted same sauce falafel sandwich  He came correct sauce  But both times he never mentioned sauce 1 00 sauce when didn't even want first sauce he gave me  When bill obviously upset  Instead trying right he said the sauce charge m menu thereby justifying why he didn't tell charge when ordered it   asked speak manager he said manager wasn't there  Wasn't least bit apologetic nor trying rectify problem but just left!!  I told would pay but didn't want  He finally conceded but happily  Customer service sucks!!  I cut falafels into strips falafels don't seem dry since such hugh balls dryness    <EOR> This place very popular just server which only downside experience but price portions great  sure try lamb amazing <EOR> My review based bad customer service walked restaurant 39mins before closing take out  male waiter sat down two plates food customer while telling closed  Didn't offer reason why apologize  Very rude  discovered market grille cafe very delicious Greek food  <EOR> The Fat Greek Salad grilled chicken awesome !

Coming San Diego local's perspective absolutely ludicrous price  Best Gyro USA too? Pretty cocky    My friends stopped EDC weekend craving some decent Greek food  Firstly wanted order slice baklava meal but checking prices friend decided just split gyro price itself  really bummed because would loved sweet road trip    But if remember correctly around $5 $6 alone? Come on    I decided grab drink opted Pepsi  sure if soda machine dirty Pepsi hadn't changed but drink horrible lingering aftertaste made stomach sick  bad even paid drink ended getting water instead The gyro stupidly mediocre couldn't believe even split bill much less paid anything all  bread tough dry meat bland veggies seemed season onions vile  sauce accompany sour pickle  professional any means but never tasted such vinegary pickled version sauce elsewhere  Needs much improvement    The only good thing visit very friendly employees working registers seemed pretty clean also restaurant bit cliche awkward but all all still charming  seasoned fries pretty yum too  think take cravings elsewhere Vegas next year  <EOR> Ate during Rockabilly weekend  food service awesome  four combo cold appetizers combo plate two   soup combo! filled 3 us  wished room dessert  server Peter if remember correctly friendly more helpful suggestions party  helper Joaquin also very friendly helpful   nice strip mall away LV Strip  Check place some terrific authentic food  <EOR> Great food service!!

Unfortunately place far often enough   tried dinner menu yet  can't wait! <EOR> I just found gem last week  twice week enjoy delicious food  I tried Avgolemono soup Greek salad gyro meat  Both outstanding! ice tea fresh tasted better most teas elsewhere   The service excellent start finish  <EOR> He may fat but he charmer  Charming word use regularly but perfect word Fat Greek  Regardless food bright blue interior perfect respite blazing desert days Vegas  Right down chairs everything perfectly coordinated blue white color scheme feel cooler climate    The service also charming  Everyone personable easy going  see regulars staff takes time check happenings lives  definitely could regular vibe  just darn charming  simply can't think better word!  The menu broad range Mediterranean offerings exclusively Greek but would expect fat Greek eat lot things right? shared bean soup falafel pita wrap Greek salad some gyro top husband  portions generous  example small Greek salad enough share given other items ordered  loved bean soup salad fresh nice dressing  falafel pita beautiful prepared way made easy eat  husband really liked but falafel much parsley taste seemed little overcooked  probably would order falafel again  However soup salad winners! Looking around kabob plates looked tempting probably worth exploring some authentic Greek options  just couldn't resist trying falafel!   Next time going appetizer combo plate  <EOR> Had dinner last night  gyro Athenian fries  Everything amazing  Even picky 2 year old loved it  Best Greek food quite awhile  <EOR> I spent 10 years Vegas looking best Greek food eaten several times !

Brought visiting friend California he loved well  Never complaint here  ! <EOR> I am LOVE Greek salad ! If could everyday would !! If ever   meal  Comes delicious Pita Bread dressing which die well! Prices reasonable  Definitely come empty stomach  <EOR> This place packed wait lunch time definitely great sign! Service friendly prices decent    Gyro Supreme $6 75 add $1 75 drink + fries rice   Great gyro meat soft warm pita bread tons feta tzatziki sauce! actually never gyro feta cheese but welcome addition ! <EOR> I write review heavy heart  used favorite restaurants town  There's lady used run register she extremely nice attentive  She hasn't last few times in  Instead there's couple guys give really bad attitude point insulting  spent lot money place over last 3 years treated poorly guys pretty mind boggling  food still great but spending money treated shit couple slimy weasels isn't really thing  Sorry doofuses hate your jobs but little pride find something else    Hey management rid guys bring back lady used work there! hope she's ok!  EDIT heard lady back  Going give Fat Greek another try! <EOR> I love Greek food!!!!  Filling full flavor   No wonder call place Fat Greek hardly stop shoving face when there   So Fat Greek pleasant discovery weekend when strolling shopping center during lunch time   cozy decorated traditional blue white some grapes but once sit down realize    you're eat   The Fat Greek family owned operated    and happy help choose  something wonderful menu   recommend bottle two Mythos beer oh yeah full bar  OPA! beef kabob appetizer homemade Hummus fresh pita's   WORD taste buds  <EOR> I craving Greek food week now  Living sw aren't very many options  Finally decided drive location  hidden away strip mall know food delicious  unfortunately did opportunity try it  Walking into brightly lit diner 6 tables eating food customer cash register  few minutes man working asked if placing order go  When told dining he said could sit anywhere  sit did  20 minutes  He appeared only employee working cut some slack  He running food finally gave woman line order  Once he done he disappeared  He walked table 10 times never received menu unfortunately never know goodness missed  If place busy pay attention customers elsewhere  <EOR> I quite liked place  ordered take can't say anything table service  came greek salad gyro meat top which suggested woman took order  originally going order Gyro Plate but she realized wanted more salad she said should just salad extra meat which great recommendation  lettuce salad nice! Very crispy delicious  meat also really flavorful satisfying  salad came Tatziki Pita which both also delicious  bread grilled but soft really good!  The woman counter friendly helpful suggestions just nice overall  came when wasn't all crowded Saturday night think if Vegas again craving Middle Eastern food would come back because seemed pretty high quality decently priced since farther away Strip  also tried baklava pretty good but usually pastry bit lighter but still pretty tasty  <EOR> Wow   best friend partner in dining Ana raved eating thought finally give place try didn't expect much but did trust friends' assessment  I am definitely glad did! restaurant tucked away urban shopping center without any special banner advertisement  almost didn't find driving past it  interior very average Greek restaurant  light blue white  colors Greek flag decorated inside  say place extremely clean meticulous which appreciated  food pleasantly surprised me  Greek salad very flavorful  Pita bread average  Babaghanoush good gets  Chicken shawarma slightly above average  but very fresh  Deserts die for  great prices too! Napolean  huge portion only $3  Incredible    I some food allergies both waiter chef came discuss which foods certain allergies etc  Very much appreciated!  Service good although did take little bit check  Overall very well above average experience  back  No plan come back within next two months update review then    Thank Ana introducing authentic gem  <EOR> Excellent food  Excellent prices   Good service nice people  Solid meal worth going 2x week which often do    <EOR> Came some soup because sick  chicken lemon soup die for  bread zatziki sauce great starter your meal  <EOR> One go to Mediterranean joints around work   Am only confuses Mad Greek Fat Greek though?  any given day no idea which which which prefer I definitely prefer though      The first time convinced best falafels I'd ever then Hedary's few days later bumped #2     noticed Misti review mentioned seemed overcooked    actually experienced them way few times but happen enjoy flavor falafels some extra cooking once while    Would now appropriate time present idea restaurant only serves burnt food?   Am only person would eat there?   But digress     So yeah love falafels love lentil soup well    also ordered Chicken Skewers thought those excellent well    Big chunks juicy chicken skewer sliced tomato over some rice   more could want?  Service usually fine but few times male staff seemed little stand offish me   Prices fair but any exceptional value either     Bottom line Fat Greek better Mediterranean restaurants Las Vegas    just hope no one ever opens place called The Bad Greek anytime soon  <EOR> The Fat Greek delivers  fancy restaurant  Fair prices  food good but great  good choice eat Greek comfort food Vegas  bread die for  chicken lemon soup  Cheapest wine bottle $ 28 00  back next year  <EOR> A solid 4 stars maybe little more  staff definitely imported need work friendliness little bit  did jobs well but seemed bit stiff side need liven just bit environment  Wifey big salad chicken she liked  Greek salad calamata olives feta few other traditional ingredients  traditional gyro no lettuce! very good  fries melted feta them outstanding! We'll definitely going back when we're neighborhood  <EOR> Very good place  quick lunch  Easy to  Staff friendly  Good fresh hot delicious  Affordable price  eat quick but feel fast food  Quality food great  Comes fast but doesn't feel rushed  <EOR> This place good all   friend asked beef gyro some sausage looking meat tasted gross mediocre food no flavor   service friendly ambience boring ordered lamb chops flavor presentation plate simple no effort whatsoever  don't recommend place going back waste money  <EOR> Great lunch spot   eaten 20+ times haven't bad experience yet   <EOR> Been few times food always great service top notch   Everything tastes fresh   would definately recommend place <EOR> I twice first week Vegas  Says something right  Quality food reasonable price  think Caesar salad best usually complain Caesar salads  Grilled chicken fresh cooked great spices  croutons Caesar pan fried pita!
