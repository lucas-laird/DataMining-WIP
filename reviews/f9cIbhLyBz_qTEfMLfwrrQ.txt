Way Better aloha kitchen once ive tried place ive coming back since wife loves egg rolls bbq chicken bowl getting chicken katsu <EOR> Ehhh place just ok now   seemed gone down hill since thought decent before  meats BBQ mix plate under marinated beef short ribs dry tough  actually use teriyaki sauce which never meat flavor it  mac salad weird yellowish color could've sitting bit but tasted fine  chicken only thing good overcooked  Hopefully just off day but going coming lot less future  Lulu definitely won't among top choices I'd probably only come chicken plate point  <EOR> Great place   menu lengthy prices decent   Service always very courteous helpful   Usually portugese sausage rice eggs   Great portions tasty   Also convenient location me  <EOR> Usually pretty good but today told them pick sat down no said anything ended waiting extra 20 minutes    Update unfortunately mac salad today hair it  hair curly grey <EOR> It's delicious love bowls around $6 comes broccoli full rice choose chicken beef comes fountain drink choice <EOR> BBQ short rib really good meal portions huge! Cheeseburger fries daughter tasteless if fries bun burger all came bag  Lettuce wilted just looked sad cheeseburger  customer service decent busy Monday Tuesday evening around 6 30  <EOR> This first time last  ordered delivery live 5 minutes away  chicken squishy under cooked  skin chicken slimy disgusting  Don't eat here  Food bad tossed trash  <EOR> We mood something different decided order using delivery Lulu's tonight  glad did! We Barbeque Chicken Plate includes 2 big scoops rice macaroni cup which awesome! Lot's food very tasty  Then Kahlua Pork regular plate really flavorful also generous helping meat  egg rolls ordered fantastic slightly spicy dipping sauce which really complimented rolls   The delivery time also half expecting! We're definitely going eat again   soon! <EOR> Everyone getting spicy chicken according reviews thought I'd try it  really spicy all find mongolian beef spicier  Expected more flavor bigger menu  Great service though  Very kind people  Did wait bit food but came fresh only sense  Overall would recommend place others area  <EOR> What strange little place! Don't wrong decent but just little bit odd    In effort grab bite before work event partner stumbled upon place  no idea hell wanted eat Lulu won vote simply because proximity  only thing needed see Spam musubi menu felt safe proceed gamble    Our order consisted two Spam musubis order kalua pork some kind grilled BBQ chicken plate  reading only difference between small large plate number scoops rice mac salad decided small would just fine    When food came quick realize something lost translation received pork some kind but definitely kalua  Time tight decided roll error when all said done a ok  chicken other hand looked run over truck  fact didn't look chicken all but rather piece county ham  plate weakest bunch thank goodness mac salad musubi reeled back bit    Exceptional? Nah  Did job done  Sure did! <EOR> Ordered Loco Moco served nice plate but flavorless food  Meat 0 flavor eggs needed something  Gravy salty  Overall disappointment sadly won't back <EOR> Conventional Hawaiian BBQ joint   enjoy deliver even though only w in 5 mile radius I'm safe zone    saimin isn't good L L's saimin but everything else good   Need mention again deliver? <EOR> Im always down try places assuming place would similar Aloha Kitchen L L   With said just ok  ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp Spicy Chicken Loco Moco  top off ordered Mango Smoothie Boba   The Honey Walnut Shrimp bit sweeter side  Spicy Chicken medium spicy bit greasy side  Loco Moco really good but some reason gave way much rice    Now Mango Smoothie extra boba  Waaaaaaaaay sweet! could only take couple sips done    They situated pretty nice location complimented Super Wal Mart across parking lot  set pretty spacious decent amount tables booths    Service decent  your food soon its done   So overall nothing overly good bad report  would probably once while  just wouldnt first choice  <EOR> The food always fresh hot  menu mail saw deliver which nice change all pizza places  food real quick around 30 mins  fact separate Mac salad stays cold  pot stickers biggest ever seen  Best Hawaiian food North Las Vegas  <EOR> I Hawaiian BBQ place because close home  bad but its great would say average  prices think bit much get  If side seaweed salad which love cost $4  would expect good side portion  However $4 only ounce maybe 4 ounces  Knowing portion joke large size Poki raw tuna my second favorite thing cost $12  side keep mind! Nonetheless pay because really good totally recommend   Lastly spam musabi average going price $2 50 believe  think spam rice ratio off  overcompensate large amount rice but hey its still good me! Again isn't favorite place but come back due fact close  <EOR> My grandpa wanted lunch plate birthday dinner decided come here  made great choice food tastes back home  Nice lady register gave free drinks cuz ordered much food!
