Seems off  looks there's very minimal marscapone dish  Maybe dime size amount ridiculous  main star  ask some she comes back tell mascarpone actually none plates but instead whipped cream  She does apologize but she more blames kitchen telling advance  she doesn't ask if want something else  she charges full price each dessert even though didn't FULL dessert mini cakes individually cost less full? Needless say disappointed doesn't begin cover feel  thought best restaurant we'd ever to  impressed Friday EVERYTHING amazing  But clearly place consistent    Our server attentive all  ask refill drinks she would gone long periods time  know holiday but table next server extremely attentive almost if she never left side    it ruined Mother's Day  We'd raving place guys fell short  didn't want fuss front grandmother but doubt ever coming back  Which shame because assumed we'd found perfect place intended frequent location    The bill wasn't cheap expect pay for  no problem bill Friday  even OVER tipped because service impeccable  But today felt Applebee's  didn't paid terms service taste     UPDATE        When say redeemed themselves mean REDEEMED THEMSELVES   They reached offered discount bad experience  manager amazingly kind seemed genuinely interested making experience better    A little insider tip ask Michelle Drew  Both servers epitome excellence  when pour oil your bread ask Parmesan cracked pepper  bread even better  If  even possible    And definitely chef specials menu hidden inside  no words describe amazing flavor is  take pasta home later  mention generous portions are!

Very rich!  I really dig atmosphere well! Plenty touches scream Italy Vegas pics Rat Pack whatnot    why 2 stars?  Unfortunately lackluster service issue  Nathan waiter evening  While service wasn't completely terrible several things amiss  Items requested forgotten even he verified request  Drink orders separate staggered instead together    I guess where all disappointment stems when pay bill leave  essentially 3 sets 2 people  When asking bills split just having 2 people put separate bill proved such apparently laborious task decided just settle last 4 among ourselves  2 bill came roughly $36 dollars  rounded $40 added $10 tip  charged flat $50 signed credit card slip    Nathan came back then told $50 did include tip  Mind he tipped all parties table  He taken care regards think quite well all things considered   He basically just stood over without saying word  did want gripe over $10 special friends birthday gathering gave another $10 cash  felt shakedown left very sour taste mouth  Everyone table agreed line inappropriate  alone back Maggiano's    I hope $10 worth because now 6 people sour opinion Maggiano's certainly seek other options regular togethers   I am still quite annoyed situation played ruined otherwise great meal great friends  am going give them 1 star simply because food very good    But back pretty sure friends just put off whole thing well   2 stars  <EOR> My daughter 16th birthday party last week  requested private dining room Sheldon explained unfortunately don't offer weekend nights but he did best put more private area  He even helped menu options week before party he helped decorate table  He took great care all needs  next time plan going coming back here  won't find any place better service  Sheldon accommodating  Thank you!! <EOR> First time tonight Father's Day  service great food matched! ambiance perfect occasion  Nice family place great big gatherings  lucky enough meet chef  informed server gluten free allergy  She assured would dish chef could me  great touch chef come take personal gluten free order  He made sure found Dish suitable needs  ordered pasta AMAZING!

Because dined while resident Chef overseeing kitchen cannot generalize whether food excellent when visiting Chef there  would still expect can't wrong Downtown Summerlin location since Maggiano's food tends very consistent across many locations  <EOR> The quality food service exceptional! seated promptly bar area as requested watch baseball game   Usually give some service when seated bar area but here!

Food delicious waitresses nice    I big fan Italian food but spaghetti ordered good!   And u free spaghetti gift when u order spaghetti!   If u r going call reserve table beforehand many people waiting line  <EOR> Great dishes but honestly Alfredo very bland! If can't Alfredo make? gets Alfredo sauce wrong??? much hype also very very expensive such fair sized portions  mean small nor big but enough if keep eating bread  Rather Olive Garden honestly  Good service great happy staff  Just food bit disappointing   Stars service server bus boy? <EOR> Maggianos always family favorite    Great food generous portions very good service  Tonight new location    packed ate bar    Michelle waitress she awesome    Even packed night food came fast hot      ordered some food take home    Upon arriving home realized missing half order     called manager recognized customer left without full order chased find us     He offered take care situation but most impressive ease taking care customers    always back    son loves place much catered wedding    nice see new Summerlin location holds same high service quality standards downtown location consistently   <EOR>
