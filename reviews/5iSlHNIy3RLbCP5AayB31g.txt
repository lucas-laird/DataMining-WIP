possibilities  Additionally charged full price beers even though arrived ordered around 6 18 per receipt    Food good but ever come again based solely fact customer service good better alternative Applebee's  <EOR> This Ruby Tuesday Really Gross Bathrooms  nasty Smelled crap  lost appetite ended leaving turned stomach  staff horrible asked manager didn't even come table see wrong   husband didn't even want salad bar gross  left right food came even cold  All across bored would never back location again  <EOR> Ruby Tuesday kicked notch pleasantly surprised meal  new Orleans style talapia

rack ribs zucchini Mac n cheese  Definitely worth $25  ribs nasty  give 5 circles zucchini Mac n cheese cheese isn't melted doesn't much flavor  If choose Mac n cheese your sides extra cost   only items tasted place can't review any other menu items  <EOR> I've many times past 7 almost 8 years food today just wasn't good usual  service little better usual though  Everyone table ordered meal chicken all overcooked just didn't taste right  Chicken Parmesan Pasta cheesy it never cheesy didn't enough pasta sauce  chicken pasta very hard dry outside  Chicken tenders also difficult kids eat  love restaurant but know won't going back awhile  <EOR> I haven't Ruby Tuesday's years but dad raving soup salad bar husband made point come just that   It pretty nice salad bar only $1 more bowl soup  total before tip $24 82 2 soup salad bars 2 ice teas   We definitely back  pretty good reasonable price  <EOR> This first time everything perfect  Kyra waitress she amazing  Very sweet friendly

waitress gladly help when she busy other tables  She always help find something menu if cant decide  <EOR> Service absolute 5 stars meal absollutely wonderful   am happy discovered Ruby Tuesday   Oh btw prices excellent well   Just $9 99 entree   plus salad bar comes free right now special   cannot that  <EOR> Just left place very disappointed   First off host seated table where other guests already moved another table took long time anyone address let alone drink  finally waitress Morgan come over  help us  She only bright spot otherwise disapponting experience   The salas good always but rest meal good   probably going back <EOR> Food very good service really good  Didn't catch waiters name but he did great job  Towards end meal husband ordered more drink waiter order drink then issue another table he needed handle  few mins he made back deliver check noticed he charged drink but didn't bring let know just asked if he could grab drink only did he forgotten drink he brought second house  also trying coupon online while restaurant having problems getting into he helped right away  only thing complain kids juice over soda but juice served very small glass free refills waiter did let know front weren't free  juice small finished before meal arrived  <EOR> One worst meals really long time  My wife decided try Ruby Tuesday's since looking something different rather typical fast food restaurants around here  When arrived hostess sat right behind booth waiters use ring orders when plenty other booths choose from  ask waitress if OK move which she obligingly moved another booth    We then ordered some strawberry lemonade's absolutely disgusting  tasted pure concentrated crystal light liquid sugar added in  sent them back wild berry iced tea weren't any better but didn't want send them back again    Our appetizers came 20 minutes later looked sitting under hot lamp entire time  would understand if restaurant slammed customers but only 5 tables seated time  entrees followed another 20 minutes later food looked disgusting  ribs ordered looked boiled then just dabbed some BBQ sauce top  only thing tasted good fries  spaghetti squash tasted old hash browns couldn't take anymore   We decided order dessert take taste mouths decided order chocolate cake tiramisu  could tell just taken cake fridge drizzled some chocolate sauce powdered sugar top called good  tiramisu even worse tasted old    All all stomach cramps food wasted $58 dollars meal should served pepto bismol disclaimer    Don't waste your time place  <EOR> I don't know fuss all about  burgers good  service above average but menu does me  no desire come back  burgers just street  bad note men's restroom stinky sewer problems think  ruined appetite  Sorry Ms  Tuesday any day week going cut me  am completely disappointed  <EOR> This first visit last  waitress slow forgetful  husband said food tolerable but would better if fast food  salad bar great tasty  However broccoli cheese soup disgusting   tasted nacho cheese 7 11 broccoli florets dropped in  <EOR> Staff always nice food really good prices fair  Their steaks always perfectly cooked  And appetizers bring before meal really tasty   If wanna relaxing dinner id suggest stop here  <EOR> First time family everything absolutely amazing  food delicious  No waiting nice employees  <EOR> Visited Friday 6 1 18 first time location  good menu selection atmosphere nice    Food *3 stars* Ordered hickory bourbon chicken asparagus macaroni  cheese macaroni melted  considered premium side costs extra nasty  chicken very small piece though good  asparagus cooked well  date ordered shrimp pasta disappointed came few shrimp  bother ordered drinks  spiked strawberry lemonade great only five bucks  top shelf margarita good well    The waitress very nice offered switch macaroni when she noticed hadn't eaten but okay leaving just won't order again  back give place another try  <EOR> The cost little high but google coupons half off second meal  tasty good  enjoyed meals  <EOR> Just disgusting  tolerate Anti American business any longer   Veterans eat too! <EOR> I into big chain restaurants since nineties when made appearance took over minds Americans places eat  am very picky chains Ruby Tuesday's chain would pick   Then why come only remaining Ruby Tuesday's Las Vegas? purely spend time friend likes chains hold against her  friend remembered when arrived avoidance big chains said forgot  into big chain restaurants  Great thanks friend! ok company   I ordered Coastal Mojito starting cocktail  think word cocktail stretching bit well word mojito  time mojito drink  Ruby Tuesday's version mojito more   very sweet did same qualities your normal mojito  NEXT!  My friend decided salad bar seemed safe enough  salad bar mediocre best  just your average run mill low cost produce setup bar  just chose seemed appetizing threw dressing  did take notch pay extra add ons salmon chicken  costs more but did add bit normalcy lunch  Both salmon chicken ok tasted salmon chicken  No real bragging rights  NEXT!  I still kept trying ordered Cheese Broccoli soup  NEXT!  That all say last remaining Ruby Tuesday's Las Vegas  just confirms why am into many big chain restaurants focusses price rather quality  market big chains though  each own  <EOR> I Generally would give five stars place failed service food  sitting 10 mins ask hostess if could ahead start salad bar  saw sever he seemed disinterested job  honest thought he busser first   salads hostess quick over table  Maybe he having bad night all let go  sever station next all over tables sat orders placed drinks quickly  When back look see if she cause she hustled   When entrees came GF chicken cooked all way through  end server manager look talk it  wasn't going complain service BUT while she did only let know going on  She took check refused let pay anything  Which intention! best part she didn't give million excuses she stated she could  No she took ownership restaurant server  Because back felt hostess sever next ours deserved five stars     <EOR> Went friend   appetizer sampler   Yummy   gave chance try different flavors   am big spring roll fan yet those favorites   friend burger very pleased   asiago peppercorn steak   sauce excellent   think could eat anything   overall excellent meal  <EOR> My grandpa doesn't much he Crab Cake Dinner last week   he thinking ever since  think because he eat some aunt's Lobster Carbonara mom's Lobster Mac Cheese some Tiramisu    I website joined email club  emailed 2 1 coupon $10 right away   This time ordered Ultimate Chicken Sandwich which chicken breast topped Havarti cheese applewood smoked bacon sliced avocado all trimmings  honey mustard dressing  Oh yeah ENDLESS FRIES! only refill time    When bill came card join email club said free entree  sure if means another 2 1 coupon coupon free entree   http pages rubytuesdayrestaurants com page aspx?QS=773ed3059447707deabda7bb9014e2bc76683fcf2ec10edcbf62b7dc638cf860 <EOR> Food ok  Tables made little people   not average sized people   Service just OK! <EOR> Our server nice pushing 3 4 stars  She really made seem she cared good experience  food good but great  small salad bar very well taken care veggies looked super fresh  would liked little more variety though  burger good but very salty normally add salt everything imagine many people wouldn't able eat it  biscuits also very salty excessively salty food main reason would only give 3 stars  <EOR> Great Staff!   Ordered pick up  assisted right away no issues transaction   Asked if needed anything else twice  Condiments napkins bag which good didn't ask    I ordered Salmon mashed potatoes grilled zucchini  Wasn't best SAlmon little chalky taste  Mashed potatoes point zucchini ehh    Another order bacon burger fries  Burger cooked well done requested fries ok    May return something new  Diverse staff which awesome parking available  <EOR> Food mediocre over priced  really only compare Applebee's chili's which both better this  restaurant slow server terrible  He only stopped take order bring food check  He friendly all  food came almost cold  don't complain restaurants just sucked up  When actually tasting food just wasn't good definitely worth price  <EOR> so chicken bella  white cheddar mash  spaghetti squash marinara   Mash great right hint seasonings spaghetti squash marinara bland  no flavor   Chicken good parmesan cream sauce little hint spice but enjoyed it  great addition portabella mushrooms  friend seafood festival mix  all looked good but didn't taste since all crab lobster am allergic  She liked it  appetizer Asian Dumplings suprisingly good  believe water chestnuts sliced big kind gotten way chicken goodness dumpling but  just me  place little more upscale chili's applebee's  food great service  Couldn't complain expect nothing more chain served American Fare  only left Vegas  Because Summerlin closed  <EOR> This place should close last here!  sure would missed!  ordered salad bc thought known fresh salad bar which looked unappetizing walked door   salad ordered fresh tasted awful!  husband some pork chop which looked appetizing menu but when came looked microwave porkchop bottled dressing poured over could literally cut fork   Nassssty!  Waitress never asked everything bc she knew gross too   I'd embarrassed serving such slop unfresh salad   entrees cheap either   bill 3 $60   NEVER set foot place again!   Wasted money wasted food! <EOR> Unlike previous experiences our Saturday night visit disappointing  The food ho hum portions much smaller  also eliminated cheese rolls  entree came 2 minutes side salad appeared   The server did ask if everything ok but left before could even respond  No drink refills provided  So disappointing Ruby Tuesday favorite! <EOR> So craving really good salad couple days ago course nice salad bar Ruby Tuesday came into mind especially hearing new 55 ingredient salad bar  husband came seated searched usual  quesadilla salad bar combo   After searching finding asked waitress it  She informed now NEW menu quesadillas NO LONGER menu  course shocked hard time knowing else salad bar entrée   So ended just eating salad   Don't wrong salad bar GREAT! every ingredient would want salad EXCEPT diced turkey  diced ham but  preference  Other delicious  even back second plate   So salad bar worth long run  But towards end dinner did request  quesadilla entrée returned addition diced turkey added salad bar  really hope requests heard acknowledged  <EOR> The food great service good parking good   only things might problem prices little higher side burger costs $12 only choose 1 side when your plate looks kind bare   Salads picked Salad bar commercials looks its 15 feet long everything   But fact less then bare minimum Salad bar   Just lettuce 6 toppings 5 dressings   mean when want salad want enough choices could cobb salad sort just lettuce dressing   Other then those 2 things pretty nice place  <EOR> Worst restaurant experience! place filthy ants crawling everywhere waitress rude food terrible! idea burger piece meat wheat bun burned pasta  fact place considered good restaurant just blows mind!   Apparently if put terrible food fancy plate more valuable          <EOR> First all just letting know no affiliation restaurant but let just say      Ruby Tuesday Craig Revere delicious     hard find great restaurant experience anymore especially very adequate wonderful salad bar     Everytime very pleased Friday night Feb 9       2 bill $48 change total     would lower but biggest domestic draft beer girlfriend biggest Chardonnay      chicken fresco bake potato substituted salad bar $1 99 extra instead 2 sides    Girlfriend petite sirloin mashed potato added salad bar also       walked feeling most satisfied restaurant experience long time     another gentleman complimenting experience he hostess also when left      knock Applebee's but food always over salted just never enjoyed enough want keep going back but Ruby Tuesday back    <EOR> I normally never complain anything just nature but weird experience today just thought should heads up  Last time Ruby Tuesday family great experience time decided come enjoy ourselves again    This time great  waitress nice gave refills nice kids everyone's order right but mine  ordered chicken strips meal the small portion which comes four pieces chicken side fries  added salad bar which yummy but then when food came missing side fries  She said she substituted side fries salad bar which something never agreed to  She said she could bring order fries additional cost!

My party three seated right away asked beverages right away  waitress nice polite us  served food reasonably quick fashion    Food Good moments bad moments The food served both best worst part dining experience here  enjoyed Appetizer Sampler which pretty good   fries mozzarella sticks personal favorites   I chicken crab cakes onion rings zucchini  chicken ok but buttery  crab cakes strong crab taste them  Yes they're called crab cakes but didn't taste much cake part  also ordered side zucchini but zucchini served thinly sliced oily pieces zucchini  didn't look appetizing actually   For dessert shared cheesecake sundae friends  great looked  thought since sundae would all cold  unpleasant surprise know cheesecake part warm  made consumption process little difficult since sundae kept melting me  Still tasted strawberry cheesecake ice cream but varying temperatures textures Weird huh?    Overall Would visit once blue moon I really place first time 2 3 years ago but guess quality food waned since then  won't stop anyone visiting place  no means horrible place but definitely weigh your options  great moments but unpleasant experiences come well  <EOR> This favorite place eat nice relaxing dinner  favorite thing place garden bar!
