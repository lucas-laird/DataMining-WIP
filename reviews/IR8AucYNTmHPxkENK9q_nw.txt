They also deep fried chicken deep fried sticky rice dish decadent especially fish sauce mixture serve with  We actually showed them picture dish another restaurant Westminster CA when didn't serve it   Nha Trang basically adapted same concept dish  If deep fried your thing then also order soup dishes   haven't tried them yet     Back deep fried specifically clay pot dishes  prawns caramelized fish sauce dish very good   However cat fish version dish Ca Kho simply amazing   am really sure cook whether purely clay pot if mixture deep frying fish then transferring clay pot but texture fish just slightly crispy caramelized fish sauce just right amount sweetness   would say definite must try   am salivating now just thinking food  <EOR> i wanted write review because its GOOD! started off Bun Bao  it amazing  then pho filet mignon  Their broth off hook noodles perfect meat great   even though its bad location pass place up   prices great food great <EOR> Unassuming little place nothing distinguishing it  Unless course eat some delicious Vietnamese food!!!! Although Vietnamese no idea Nha Trang cuisine but very surprised much enjoyed food here  sister ordered Bun Bo Hue Goi Cuon Ca Nha Trang beef an item special menu   Goi Cuon Ca unlike any summer rolls ever tried! just freaking good crunchy flavorful fresh oh amazing    Whatever did beef nice charred deliciously seasoned taste it  beef came rice vegetables  Bun Bo Hue equivalent same item found other Vietnamese restaurants   They offer free drink nuoc mat but didn't it  tasted watered down sweetened tea  Over all if want try something ordinary when comes Vietnamese food you've try Nha Trang! <EOR> BEST EGGROLLS EVER HADD!!! Seriously would come place just eggrolls  look super weird thought screwed them first but boy wrong  just cook different style    This best Vietnamese restaurant while as mentioned other posts problem inconsistent Vietnamese restaurants Vegas are   But good brother back couple days later am still wanting take friends  Haven't going long enough see if consistent but far good  Everything cook Nga Trang style little bit different usual  taste bit different  but still fantastic brother me  I family Nga Trang Vietnam used style sure non Vietnamese people think it    This seriously favorite place right now  If anyplace Vegas comparable Vietnamese Cali food place maybe on good days Pho 8  only thing would see menu more options future now quite sparse   I would recommend people very least try awesome amazing eggrolls have  <EOR> This review strictly pho fish rolls Nha Trang before changed name Ha Noi Pho   live next little saigon westminster CA however place BEST pho any restaurant ever eaten at  broth tasted cooking hours hours just good! fish rolls served tamarind sauce also favs!   A MUST TRY!   Tip 3 dish combo around $20 includes sour soup fish cooked clay pot salad! good worth it! <EOR> So far very clean modern twist menu     We ordered nem nuong summer rolls which definite must   sauce comes never had   ground pork meat based stew dip man good   husband used dip grilled pork chop made sure server didn't take away   fried spring roll wrap roll gave nice crunch   only thing might've lacked more fresh herbs cilantro even mint     The banh xeo VERY small unlike most places lacked lot flavor   sufficient lettuce but enough herbs   give mix them but very little 2 stems each herb   notice lot herbs dishes because enhances flavors brings freshness taste   The bun rieu needed more flavor well   give little cup mam tom shrimp paste but enough soup tasty   snails out shell course soup but definitely didn't need because didn't anything soup other give different texture   crab cake eating egg your soup   much flavor all   The broken rice grilled pork chop crab cake OK   nuoc mam dipping sauce really don't good job it   put loads hot pepper sauce which think watered down because putting full tsp still spicy all    If fresh garlic would've added some along extra lime juice   tasted salty sweet dipping sauce   The cafe sua da good gets   Just right amount condensed milk   I probably never come back lots good authentic Vietnamese restaurants Spring Mountain   might clean but food definitely better  <EOR>
