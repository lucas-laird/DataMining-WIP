My friend just eaten lunch Lake Las Vegas mood boba decided drive all way side town drink! Because let's face all know there's no decent boba spots Henderson   Loftti Cafe bit hard find if you're familiar area  hidden very corner strip mall  Upon entering Loftti greeted very soft spoken yet super friendly employee  She could tell first time way looked menu she offered explain options us    Of course ordered everything but boba originally came for! ordered two Frozen Cotton Candy desserts coffee flavor original Raindrop Cake  Frozen Cotton Candy actually really good  loved ice part dessert  tastes just Häagen Dazs coffee ice cream but smooth shaved ice texture  cotton candy nice touch added perfect amount sweetness but would definitely eat shaved ice itself! rich creamy    Something would definitely order again! Raindrop Cake however  different story! Two words Weird AF! technically three? try seeing being circulated Facebook timeline million times  definitely unique worth trying but something would eat again  concept almost Jell O but without flavor  soy flour sugar syrup topping definitely needed!  Overall really cute cafe catch friend some studying done! loved decorations shelves back    reminded bunch random things you'd find old attic! definitely back soon try White Coconut Latti everyone speaks highly of! <EOR> If milk teas try jasmine green latti which jasmine green milk tea add boba lychee jelly! yummy!! inside decorated really cute rustic modern look  Also workers very helpful nice  If lived vegas would definitely back often  <EOR> The place clean calm relaxing  great place study  beverage options flexible  enjoyed having boba balls tea  staff very kind helpful recommending products based mood craving  <EOR> OK LOVE PLACE!! workers nice cafe just cute! raindrop cake amazing only $3 25!!! 10 10 recommend!! <EOR> Customer service nice! pretty good teas smoothies too!

Maybe but considering something easily made home crazy over it    Upon ordering drink server told take pride drinks  Unlike all other boba shops Vegas uses all artificial syrups powders old stale boba use freshly brewed teas fresh boba every day  surprised hear because name least 5 boba shops Vegas brews teas fresh boba    My jasmine latti jasmine milk tea worst rendition had  unpleasant herbally minty taste which am most decidedly fan of  Boba glob disappointment  am 120% sure wasn't fresh  Wasn't warm cooked all way  fact very similar those cook home boba any Asian supermarket  little disappointed drink overall   At end same server informed free 16oz drink writing Yelp review  really fond idea luring people write review free things   perhaps ordered wrong items but won't way cafe  <EOR> Simple cafe tucked shopping center   Girls front really nice soft spoken  I ordered famous raindrop cake  The gelatin cake little sweet some strawberries little tang  dipping sauces enhanced flavor   I honeydew milk tea sweet delush  Usual pricing around part town  Parking little tight since several businees compact shopping center   Nicely decorated inside bench seating  <EOR> Their drinks good but favorite  great place study chill boba something  store itself really comfy there's couch!

Since main reason came Loftti already given going order that  However much help 2 nice girls behind counter able choose two boba drinks Royal Thai milk tea Jasmine Green latti boba  ordering sit comfortable sofas wait food   The drinks brought first  latti just seemed regular boba drink but pleased quality  However someone group pointed tapioca balls bit chewer usual   Next spotlight desert! all don't know raindrop desert $3 50 jiggly blob made mineral water agar the thing gives Jell O like consistency   Since cake itself almost no taste served alongside roasted soybean flour kinako sugary syrup called kuromitsu  When brought girls instructed mix flour syrup together before eating  Thankfully told because separately disgusting  mixing two create paste wooden spoons accompanying desert dug in!  Don't expect any flavor cake itself  All nutty sweet flavor paste create  say pleasantly surprised! flavor wasn't overpowering  Since size palm hand really pay amount get   Would drive all way across town sone Loftti? necessary  But would come stop if close some desert boba? Why not! <EOR> I've going awhile always love drinks  However particular day customer service horrible  First all approached counter guy working welcoming all  began greeting telling order  He then mumbled something which replied that? rude loud tone he told total  ordered drink boba which also said receipt but no boba when it  back tell no boba he told didn't ask it  showed receipt he just stared me  told add boba just pay it  No communication whatsoever  Fixed order but didn't apologize  <EOR> Really good coffee  LOVE iced sea salt coffee  BUT why open late??? would love more often but time you're open already coffee  really stinks come only when right rather purposely going morning coffee fix <EOR> Nice soft music very relaxing  Golden Medalist strawberry banana made real fruit smoothie very refreshing! Service very important Tiffany very polite knowledgeable  <EOR> Great local spot coffee tea!! met friend meeting discovered it!! Great spot wish opened earlier  <EOR> We tried thai tea earl grey cotton candy  Both good! Im returning try other flavors! <EOR> Decided come before dinner night Oh didn't know? Dessert before dinner definitely new norm foodies lololol XD since close 30 mins time week opening  Needless say regret nothing because when walked genuinely surprised delighted greeted adorable friend mine actually working whom haven't seen months Hi Namhee !! ! having cutesy moment nostalgia asked specialties best sellers she personally likes    I ended getting Blush Peach iced tea Serena Honey fruity tea drinks Earl Grey Cotton Candy shaved ice dessert start appetite night  sure mix shaved ice well won't getting full effect flavor  Blush Peach wasn't overtly diabeetus which good since barely drink iced teas  Serena Honey does well those under weather since honey hints ginger but wasn't overpowering taste either    The ambiance cafe reminded somewhat Cafe Darak but more earthly tones neutral color schemes  Some trinkets made nice touch overall atmosphere but wasn't overbearing either  background instrumentals point which gave cafe more subtle tranquil feel could possibly next spot students study cafes without much distraction  mean satisfied enough just coming drink eat memorable conservations friends haha!  I ended coming back following morning good company Scarlet shared Raindrop Dessert  few coworkers remembered previous night yay! Scarlet ice tea nice deep shade red decent taste blood orange but surprisingly neither sour nor sweet  able finish off pretty quickly lol  Raindrop Dessert wasn't amazing but its interesting say least  sure mix sauce til its moist before eating raindrop looking cake  tasted jello mixed grounded graham crackers which isn't bad but exactly something would eat repeatedly  also few sips friends drinks both being iced teas Sun Drop Emerald  Sun Drop bit sweet but almost tasted similar Scarlet  Emerald intrigued yuzu did enjoy citrusy flavors blended well together consider getting next time  haven't tried any milk teas rest cotton candy shaved ice but definitely near future! D <EOR> This place great really enjoy coming to  There's specific drink usually apparently only manager capable making me?? feel its bc other workers don't want try which real bummer when travel across town there    <EOR> Excellent drinks  Love fruity black tea iced green apple jellies  Cute atmosphere  Good service  Sometimes takes little bit drink made 10 20 minutes depending your order definitely call ahead if rush  Good quality fair prices 5 star rating  <EOR> What cute cafe! immediately greeted sweet young woman explained menu offer I'd never before  waiting friend decided order sandwich 16oz iced Carmel Latti  sandwich wasn't bad enjoyed buttery flavor croissants provided  drink REALLY GOOD really good  wasn't sweet could taste well see caramel    When friend arrived ordered came for rain drop cake  personally did it  flavor cake itself little bland soy flour red bean syrup did add any sweet qualities    Overall back  drinks customer service atmosphere amazing can't wait next visit hopefully try cotton candy shaved ice cream have!! <EOR> I came just stop check place but cotton candy shaved ice caught eye    It literally shaved ice cotton candy covering outside  earl grey flavor awesome where ice actually gotten flavor  Def worth trying  <EOR> I came first time Raindrop dessert which pretty looking  Instagram worthy   excited see could add Cotten Candy top drink!

If you're study hanging electrical outlets hanging above large central table just pull down  There's outlets next blue couch two others next bookcase back  tables kind small which only downside if you're looking study  But hey cafe library take it   I didn't try raindrop cake cotton candy dessert but hot americano 16oz white coconut latti milk tea instead  americano smooth pretty tasty overall  don't specialize coffee but if you're looking decent americano won't disappointed  comes high lid supposed pool coffee lid supposed cool down drink  thought really novel something never seen before   The white coconut latti amazing  usually don't any other milk teas besides usual thai iced tea jasmine milk tea almond milk tea but feeling pretty zesty weekend  doesn't taste artificial coconut flavor but rather tastes real thing  some density slight creaminess subtle coconut overpowering flavor   The customer service great  She very friendly helpful when came choosing drinks since first time  Overall employees very nice   All all cafe beautifully designed decorated employees staff accommodating friendly drinks especially white coconut latti milk tea great  10 10 would come back if didn't live far away  <EOR> If you're Asian don't laptop don't come here  always hate going restaurant only certain type ethnicity feel uncomfortable place  staff also looks you're alien   half Asian white don't worry definitely racist <EOR> Very cute place !!!

I think new boba spot now on! know another boba spot opened down road but probably coming LOFTTI instead!  EDIT raindrop dessert fantastic  explained should swirl powder sauce circle around raindrop then eat it  All flavor comes sauce  During visit also honeydew frozen latti matcha frozen cotton candy  honeydew perfect  perfect amount sweetness which complemented honeydew flavor well  frozen cotton candy reminiscent snow ice but nearly thick very light flavor  Everything yummy! <EOR> This place opened across street where live long ago wonderful hole wall shop   employees always friendly great atmosphere comfortable seating internet power   haven't food yet but drinks all very good   many drinks haven't bad yet!

There downside but doesn't affect rating place  location bit small does tend packed parking problem  remember having park further down just find free parking spot  Otherwise place really worth stopping checking out! <EOR> I love Rainbow turning into new Spring Mtn! Now find all fun places down street house    I try frozen cotton candy which believe just shaved ice huge cotton candy topping we did Earl Grey  great light nearly sweet imagined    I also tried jasmine iced latte  Perfection  love nothing overpowered sweetness most boba places tried  Looks usually deceiving not here!   We back!! <EOR> Came roommates because down street saw some yelp reviews saying great place to  ambience nice when walk comfy looking couches cool table set front door  asked cashier he recommended he kinda laughed asked meant that  rephrased question which thought very straight forward very strange someone answer question back another question  He suggested raindrop cake because he said flavor tasted strawberries golden lychee drink because  favorite also great lychee flavor it  took suggestions ordered them both  disappointed suggestions because both par he said  rainbow cake tasteless although when strawberry did taste strawberry only flavor cake but you'd expect strawberry fruit taste strawberry right? Anyway golden lychee green tea flavor but barely any lychee flavor it  sure if we'd come try place again service okay items suggested came disappointing  <EOR>
