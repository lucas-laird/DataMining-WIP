A co worker mine lunch last week   step inside notice decor warm inviting really dig lodge motif  also appreciate non smoking dining room    Ah might well honest am putting lot filler review because can't remember ordered day  remember sandwich but really am drawing blank here  The food really left impression me  LOL Anyway really bad place just need step game if want compete resturant category  <EOR> We dining Foothills lodge years addition bringing friends family too   This past weekend dinner worst experience ever  took waiter 10 minutes before he approached table he seemed struggle remember easy things silverware napkins orders without writing them down  We ONLY patrons dining area! ordered Fish n' Chips which looked cooked outside but frozen inside  Sent back order asked Chicken Fingers instead   as soon order checked sure enough raw pink inside  point asked check husband's food   waiter couldn't even offer decent apology mistakes raw food BIG mistake   especially when bring twice!! Disappointing because really liked coming Foothills  <EOR> Had best service Gwen bar  She very attentive nice  low rating due previous times poor service bartenders more into themselves taking care customers arent regulars  <EOR> we stopped breakfast while waiting car Jiffy Lube across street   It OK  Nothing great  another couple there  quite few patrons bar but separate area restaurant  All closed doors   The food nothing special  omelet small side now wrong enough think used some places huge portions when see regular portion looks small  potatoes crispy but wish peppers softer  BF pancakes eggs he said pancakes decent   I thought paid little much 16 00 two us   The staff very friendly   Would back probably not  would special trip there  <EOR> We stopped random Let's drink night    The place empty which don't mind  90's radio hits decent drinks friendly bartender male 30yo We good time bartender cool talk we'll certainly back soon! <EOR> I came retirement together  place bar lots seating but watch some wobbly tables   Decor lodge like if any sense   It Happy Hour 4 7 PM while slow first getting food orders quicker  appetizers good  tried chicken fingers chicken cheese quesadillas  Plus half off! Woohoo!  Employees servers nice  2 pool tables but 1 reserved tournament play only   This great place host small together  lot fun just enough room 25+ people  great  would recommend place  <EOR> My bf works across street O'Reilly's every time smell food across street  restaurant closes 11pm place changed since first review   staff friendly through orders   asked bartender if Cherry Pepsi did BUT she nice enough offer pour cherry flavor drink  plus book keeping customer happy A casually dressed young guy asked if ready order He cook  shocked   tried Grilled Chicken Breast $8 change  choice side baked potato again shocked nice through he was  He very friendly asked if I'd green onion bacon bits cheese  said skip onion load please   He sure did  hate sour cream but used actually sweeter used to  really good!  They both great people bartender attentive   place quiet 5 afternoon loved experience here! haven't experienced much service little bar awhile  think well worth 5 stars  women's room gorgeous compared other bars  Super clean too!  We left full happy   liked fact quiet other locals  <EOR> The only word comes mind meh  came quick lunch while getting brakes done across street just lunch  much food menu  chicken sandwich bacon fine  Just fine  service fine bar couple regulars  Cute little place but all options city really worth another look me  <EOR> Marginal   Food wasn't great service nothing special it    list again   far menu prices couldn't tell ya because knew wouldn't back long before check! <EOR> I don't complain anybody  But she REALLY bad  This even  first review @ yelp   It 2nd visit bar  First time breakfast there  ok  average  The bartender worked night June 22nd 2010 was WORST bartender ever seen life   I'm working 5 star hotel las vegas strip  know BASIC customer skill  Taking care your customers paying attention customers see if need anything once while Whole time only thing she did getting custome's drink order served drinks rest time she joking around coworkers just off shift drinking playing slot machine @her bar  easily noticed all customers @ bar pretty upset  lady even filled comment card her  BARTENDER did care all  She gave comment card lady back coworkers again  I COUD  believe she's getting pays doing almost nothing   There's many hard working people las vegas lost job recently   SHAME HER!!!!!! <EOR> Took gander bar during late Friday night  Surprised quiet but neighborhood bar guess  expected  great late night specials low priced drink food specials  CHICKEN NACHOS TOPPED W the works! Yummy!!  bartender friendly seats comfortable music plenty seating separate restaurant area  Overall I'd definitely come back again  <EOR> Pulled place couldn't figure why looked dead   spent many great nights enjoying killer happy hour   Once inside realized why no there   ended happy hour all together now only offering wheel spins high hands video poker   sad lose such great hangout close home   hope next bar revives happy hour business  <EOR>
