Located few blocks north infamous Strip and walking distance Fremont Experience Courthouse Bar Grill place Vegas fun neighborhood feeling     Spinning four kind wins free lunch!  sure try Courthouse Hot Turkey Sandwich if chance   won't sorry   Daily happy hour specials include Wednesday Ladies Night my fave where drinks half off  <EOR> If eat lunch near courthouse quick relatively inexpensive choice  But I'd rather pay bit more better meal   I chef salad which mostly big chunks iceberg topped chopped cheese lunch meat  fresh but very flavorful  co diners soups sandwiches none which looked appealing me   Probably first last time eat but if you're stuck option I'd stick salads wraps  maybe just bring some food home camp courthouse steps nearby    <EOR> Decent food usual waitresses busy but attentive   salads good but warned usually take just long if longer other food come your table   Chicken strips good hear wraps excellent   Other everything else good but great   potato soup very good but don't order often soup of the day 90% time   A decent option when tired to go food downtown area want something besides sandwich  <EOR> Had great lunch when visiting neighborhood work assignment! Gotta try French Dip fries duh some chicken wings!  Service very friendly thorough  Work coming area every month now couple days highly looking forward some more french dips future! ROCK CB G!!! <EOR> the service ok  better food  around 1pm lunch ordered french dip fries  everything bland except au jus  if only sandwich more just bread meat  maybe adding cheese sauce something would justify $7 50 price  also took awhile box because bartender back awhile when she came she chatted another patron 5 minutes before could attention  least she greeted offered drink refill  should've gone elsewhere tried something else  <EOR> I stumbled upon  Courthouse Bar Grill recently pleasant surprise  Family run nice laidback atmosphere enjoyed Southern Fried Chicken salad baked potato soup both which very tasty  service good ended being positive experience  much couple gals came back Ladies Night which happens every Wednesday where Ladies Drinks area half off  Talk deal!  I don't much going court but Courthouse   now  different story  Definitely fan place  <EOR> Courthouse Bar Grill decent place sandwich lunch 3 stars extra star added good customer service relaxed atmosphere   Around lunchtime you'll find place packed   seems center Las Vegas legal universe around noon   menu fairly standard lunch place burgers sandwiches salads wraps    food decent but remarkable   Burgers made frozen patties but fries tasty   wraps fresh worth try   There's few fried options  try chicken fingers which delicious but most chicken fingers are    Bottom line Courthouse Bar Grill decent place meal if you're downtown don't want drive somewhere   If order sandwich know it'll good enough   As workday ends place nice relaxed space grab few beers   good quiet place ramp down work   Bottom line food isn't worth writing home but atmosphere's laid back staff super friendly   4 stars overall  <EOR> Great lunch specials friendly service  back next chance get!
