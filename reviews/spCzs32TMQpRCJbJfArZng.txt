Anyway happy IKEA town where live! <EOR> Finally! Las Vegas IKEA store  use drive CA before  parking lot great  easy locate your vehicle because alphabetical signs every aisle  There's much merchandise chose from  Everything very affordable but yes must assemble furnishings your own  cafeteria great  Children 12 under eat free Tuesdays purchase regular meal  only downfall noticed such long line cafeteria   we waited 40 plus minutes just eat  many people waiting line but only 2 cashiers working? don't understand logic that? pretty ridiculous  plenty seats available!!! Other then everyone friendly helpful  if your hungry plan eat  Stroll through take your time shop  Note*** accept cash only debit credit cards  <EOR> $2 17 generously portioned Swedish American breakfast desert view!
