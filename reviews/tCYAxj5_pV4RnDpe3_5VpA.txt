Eat greedy yours truly Mizz Loveli <EOR> HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE EXPLAINED I area tried Sushi Bomb second time first time did well friends kids   Major disappointment  MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! Their AYCE sushi little pricey but Sunday late afternoon knew AYCE dinner price still value  kids meal also seemed good value  NOTE Hot green tea included $27 99 per AYCE adult sushi which seemed strange me  We told right away order ALL sushi once because would otherwise able without waiting 25 minutes each order    WHAT? All Eat supposed work  all felt cheated because time delay between ordering receiving food  needs fixed Sushi Bomb! Hire more sushi chefs servers must around 75 people little restaurant looked only THREE servers   THEN ORDER WRONG forgot items I never did blue fin tuna nigiri replace items other choices even though fish wanted advertised item table display served COLD HOT GREEN TEA which took over 10 minutes replaced mistakenly put last specialty roll another table WAIT LONGER tried influence cancel order as end dinner     The food quality okay UNTIL SERVED GOLDEN SCALLOPS which EVEN SCALLOPS ALL!! Golden Scallops made FAKE CRAB MEAT they later admitted fish cake but know imitation crab meat looks tastes like which OVER BREADED flavorless over fried very hard coating    YUCK!!! Gross!!! We asked discount check experience almost $200 3 adults 3 kids only given ONLY $12 off    why amount could tell but agreed least some amount taken off check   I NEVER RETURN Sushi Bomb  did enjoy it  We finally paid left but bad experience over yet     After all unfortunately felt victimized Sushi Bomb squeezed MANY TABLES place could walk through exit without knocking stuff off tables    which HUMILIATING MUST FIRE HAZARD!!!

She literally wouldn't let eat smaller portion made wait until new order arrived  kind place does that? Another guest ordered roll without cream cheese when came cream cheese server didn't apologize  Even if sushi chefs fault server should normally apologize chefs behalf simple Oh sorry that  All all food alright nothing special  wait ordering terribly long  many other options sushi town would look elsewhere your dining needs  <EOR> Great all eat sushi! even hesitant because every time all eat husband complains doesn't quality sushi but walked he said really good back! few favorites bluefin tuna jalapeño yellowtail whatever roll double tuna oh love fresh wasabi!

Watch rolls banana creamy sauces super rich fill quickly  <EOR> Bukake!  hehehehe! P   roll offer don't really know means     Now review   Maybe expectations high because location price saw dinner AYCE all eat $27 but dissapointed   ordered usual nigiri first three orders tuna two orders salmon order garlic tuna order scallops start   Uni!  would rather uni rather serve some bad foul uni some other places   When brought nigiri all them same plate which meant garlic tuna sauce contaminated rice other nigiri   While friend eating noticed kept rolls other nigiri counter wouldn't deliver food ordered right away   think trying keep nice eating tempo but I'd rather bring all dish right away especially if baked hot orders!  take star off that   The server didn't take order piece paper didn't all rolls items ordered    why some places those papers where jot down want   Another dissapointment     Mind only 2 other customers time expected service immaculate   far nigiri think noticed caught amount rice given used dab much rice vinegar   second order nigiri two orders tuna order salmon sweet shrimp oysters you only order two orders salmon roe   portions finally way liked fish covering rice rice looking nice comfy bean bag fish sleep comfortably on   freshness fish good they've right     After eat 30 pieces nigiri rolls but order half rolls which spoiled other sushi places allow it   don't allow here   take note that!  some funny names rolls   ordered two rolls which could 4 half rolls    them being some secret eel roll which did enjoy all because center spicy tuna   thought would all eel   friend ordered some other roll which puffy creamy ball top which bland   help clean rolls because she didn't enjoy it   actually thankful didn't orders right because rolls headed towards right direction   good roll which shrimp tempura middle but would rather ordered 10 more pieces nigiri instead eel secret special roll     You only order dessert per AYCE even though great company still great time eating okay food   drink specials other thing going them beer special accompanies AYCE   Drinking wise place would bomb  <EOR> Pretty good AYCE sushi side town!  There aren't very many sushi joints NW partake especially AYCE variety   probably count small handful places all them warrant repeat visit   happy say Sushi Bomb great option AYCE sushi near us!    I gotta honest though all various rolls ate   I cannot remember names any them!  forgot take good pic actual menu!  All tell night wifey Sushi Bomb ate good   Stuffed gills good   While Sushi Bomb top places AYCE sushi more enjoyable place go   dinner Friday night payday yay even 8 PM place lively lot patrons   lots kids too!

Chicken Yakitori  As rule thumb sushi rolls AYCE place usually stick higher priced items menu   Why Cali Roll menu if really don't to?  Come on   live little!  Try soft shell crab!  some crispy salmon skin!  Sample extra spicy tuna!  nice selection Sushi Bomb's special rolls tempura rolls chef special rolls baked rolls     Honestly remember all tasty!  know doesn't help wasn't all memorable but least quality there   rice fish ratio spot wasn't much rice   sushi rice very good gummy overly sticky   myself love those baked rolls   Something warm mayo mix comes under salamander just roll delicious   Wifey other hand though hates warm mayo passion   ha ha ha!  AYCE also comes dessert per person   But pretty forgettable because desserts par food earlier Honey Toast Tempura Banana   If see pictures both desserts look same!  Covered scoop vanilla ice cream chocolate drizzle   Honey Toast terrible!  literally Hawaiian sweet bread roll cut half baked few minutes somewhat toasty   Tempura Banana wasn't much better heavy batter thin banana   would skip dessert next time just scoop ice cream finish meal   Dinner $28 person before tax average other AYCE sushi places town   Service OK but bit rushed think because AYCE limited 1 hour   enough time though order another round rolls though wouldn't worry much unless huge party   We'll give Sushi Bomb another try   next time sure remember all those rolls! <EOR> I'm always hesitant trying new sushi places but glad chose one  bacon roll definitely reason coming back hole wall sushi bar  all eat bit pricy menu selection but food amazing  Left satisfied willing return more  <EOR> Terrible service tonight    rude tried leave early 40 minuted before its closed   tried give buy free   top all off    they put gratuity party 5 when clearly states 6 people gratuity   Om calling management im going complain    worse service ever  didnt bring all orders tried bpame EVERYTHING new guy   asked if split bill 3 ways fine but when pay changed ot 2 ways already wheb pay   dont want anymore   GREAT FOOD TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE   TOP TRYING MORE MONEY EVEN WHEN PRICES POSTED eVERYWHERE   Cheaters rude terrible <EOR> Sushi Bomb great! servers very friendly attentive  radish wrapped sushi very good!
