Total bummer     We wanted some really great Mexican food lunch but weren't sure another good restaurant Northwest   still relatively new town as far going concerned    trying install Yelp app phone but wouldn't install phone died before could find another good place nearby     So decided would try Dona Maria Tamales   salsa seemed fresh really flavorful nice bit spice too  It always gives good impression when chips salsa good looking forward lunch  I ordered two tamale lunch one pork red sauce cheese green chiles tea   friend ordered enchilada lunch chile relleno pink lemonade   server timely polite most part even though while during lunch wait more tea before able finish food   Apparently supposed some sauce tamales? Is fact? Well wasn't any tasted pretty bland   disappointed because cheese green chile tamale chicken no green chiles found literally flavorless generally unpalatable  red pork tamale just pork where red sauce filler simmer sauce where red anything?  My friend said she less impressed enchilada chile relleno   She let bite chile relleno tasted 20x better tamales lucky her!  ended dumping half container salsa tamales barely helped   rice beans just standard fare refried beans some cheese top kind tomatoey rice  I really don't stewed tomato flavor anything     Anyway if tamales without sauce green chile cheese tamale without green chiles some random chicken didn't ask really enjoy time unfortunately today didn't send 'em back if they'll let something else! Maybe some seafood dishes dinner courses better haven't tried them but experience today isn't likely return any time soon  <EOR> Nice place  Good chips salsa plus fast efficient friendly service  taco enchilada tamal combination lunch  Everything cooked perfectly presented well  definitely back more tamales  <EOR> Came during lunch sat immediately felt soon ordered where already receiving food!

The only negative Taco  expecting 'East Side' street style Taco but pre formed shell stuffed goods   Would 5 stars but taco dropped them 4 star   I couple times always work lunch time just good other visits   I coming back again would recommend friends  There's lots seating Full Bar   Margaritas    Just skip tacos more exotic items you'll happy  <EOR> The service always top notch   point dined often visiting family   love Cocido soup homemade flour tortillas fajitas chile relleno Ranchero sauce   ranchero sauce good anything everything!  Fajitas always come sizzling delicious   Atmosphere festive two separate spacious dining areas features bar other space even larger which perfect parties   prefer sitting dining area bar   watch t v  see view kitchen   Sometimes evening when making flour tortillas   become tradition order tamales Christmas  <EOR> First time eating take out  Delicious food fresh warm very tasty  Definitely favorite places Mexican food  Thank you <EOR> No gusta!  Late dinner evening friends unpleasantly surprised bland meal  absolutely love eaten tamales plenty times however fajitas de Cameron $22+ underwhelming  No flavor ever rice beans equally disappointing  Side note banana margarita $12 amazing!  The tamales worth ordering again near future rest determined    <EOR> Passed restaurant many times before  Decided try recently eaten original Dona Maria old part Las Vegas  special offer $12 95 New place priced higher see me  Lunch two dessert $41 50 tip  would back best restaurant area  Clean modern excellent service  <EOR> The prices much higher expecting best tamales mushy watery unimpressive  chimichanga good but all around food wasn't worth price  <EOR> First off service excellent  very welcoming door servers quick friendly  great refilling wife's WATER but did offer refill 1 2 full soda    soda costs $3 10 seems little ridiculous even asked refill such expensive soda  agree most reviews chips salsa not good all tasted store bought  both ordered famous tamales beans rice sides  Pork tamales lacked flavor spice  chicken ok but nothing write home again could more flavor  cheese tamal unfortunate although most flavorful no idea kind cheese it  cheese solid block very difficult cut fork  tamal cheese sitting rock stomach  Bland beans rice    Overall service good  Food     Eh     Price expensive especially lunch especially given food quality  wavering would almost give 2 stars but $3 10 soda outrageous  1 star is  Would recommend  Would again  <EOR> I don't think know anyone hates Dona Maria's  And if chances don't them anyway   This place around years quality always consistent  used come family lot when younger every now then come back around nostalgia   There's great artwork painted walls whole place decorated though nothing over top  There's lots seating perfect large groups  never crowded when come chances wait rarely long  bar doesn't seem open anymore but there's seating area off side if want see TVs    My favorite thing menu lunch combos combine any two three tacos tamales enchiladas etc  side beans rice  come standard shredded beef chicken cheese  beef tacos best thing seem them every time no matter many times tell myself try something new  For dessert flan always go to but also crazy churro wheel  served whip cream amazing   The service always very nice continually whenever eat here  Sometimes even manager walks around checks people  wish could come around more often but if ever craving quality Mexican food worth trip  <EOR> I don't know   Maybe spoiled couple better Mexican places   When first moved place because really close house remember thinking Wow! great close by  eat 5 times per week  But recently re visited came conclusion place pricy side especially lunch  It most expensive Mexican place since lived but keep mind only 4 5  The atmosphere good service good food isn't bad  But bottom line   The food just isn't worth price  Sorry  <EOR> Very disappointing  ordered chicken nachos appetizer horrible! Most probably worst ever had! son asked sour cream side meal charged $3 00! also charge $4 50 cup sopa de fideo an item free charge Lindo Michoacan when ordering entree   Lastly husband's stomach did agree food     <EOR> I never such terrible meal Las Vegas  chicken enchilada terribly salty almost inedible  margarita alright but great  server seemed super busy even though only 5 tables section 3 servers working section  He came arm full dishes said right you   It took 10 minutes order take  Another 20 minutes food poked prodded tasteless salsa left table  husband's fajitas served cold tortillas  Between slow service cold pasty lifeless salt infused food total flop returning ever  <EOR> this place YUCK!
