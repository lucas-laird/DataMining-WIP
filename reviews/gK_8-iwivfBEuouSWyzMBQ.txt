Great wings ! Great catfish! Great grape kool aid!! Reasonable prices fast service highly recommended <EOR> Walked small bite eat saw all kinds fried stuff  Wings fish multiple species shrimp gizzards etc   some gizzards but lady working said wing day   I looked all 19 sauces decided sweet sour very bland 3 5 wings undercooked  Normally I'd eat them but far being done   won't back! <EOR> Honestly love supporting small businesses whenever open city Las Vegas but if please come your game correct!  Wing Heaven just letdown     The concept great wings fish other fried delights   But where Wing Heaven fails execution all   Just would expect newer establishment   just couldn't give place more stars if tried   If better when first opened then Wing Heaven should back straight narrow soon keep patrons coming good clip     Wing Heaven drive bit way   Entering place nice enough   No tables if plan eating just few stools flat screen TV two catch sports while wait your order   boy did WAIT   weekend night wasn't busy all store   other couple ordering time   1 weren't greeted owner anyone place matter   2 couple front ordered owner them proceeded shoot SH!+ each other least 10 minutes yes timed them    once did ANYONE greet tell would right us   bit annoying   3 When finally did register place order owner wasn't exactly friendly welcoming wifey place   Could just  demeanor but still want continued business please least FAKE smile show some effort   whiff food gonna speak itself figure would just give chance   We thought catfish but favor Mario's Westside that but ended going pound fried pollock because special   seasoning chose Garlic Vinegar   know Filipinos lovin' garlic vinegar salt pepper   real reason drove down Wing Heaven because wife loves fried gizzards only places heard serve them regular basis   pound those well   Paid proceeded wait while order being prepared   long 10 minutes     Owner finally warmed bit asked if liked cheesecake   He said he going treat try out   Yay some life guy   few minutes later given cheesecake bite sorts chocolate raspberry sauce top   OK   But expecting something bit more homemade   seemed those cheesecake bites your local warehouse store just covered batter fried   Good effort but wish more original   Glad offered though only reason gave Wing Heaven another star   Upon take order arriving lifted bag   really seemed LIGHT   ask behind counter Bro sure fish pound? Guy says yes   did WRONG thing just leaving Thanks checking order   The wifey finally drive back side town sit down enjoy meal immediately disappointed   pound fried fish seemed measly!  looks included weight all seasonings BEFORE frying!  sad   fish pieces small much fish order tiny bite size pieces   Just bad!  Lots batter bits much fish   only thing good Garlic Vinegar seasoning gave good tang lackluster fish   wish remembered take pics but upsetting totally disregarded it   But wifey vouch fish being just disappointment   came tiny condiment container cole slaw but wasn't tasty either   Needed more vinegar less mayo   Tartar sauce?  Nothing special   On fried gizzards which letdown well   Granted trip eating area wasn't very far wasn't expecting fried items hold greatest because just everything Wing Heaven packed since no real eating area house    But gizzards rubbery!  shoe leather rubbery!  mean two things gizzards overcooked gizzards frozen type product fresh made   No amount Louisiana hot sauce could really save gizzards being yummy   No bueno   About $15 total order since opted meal route since first time Wing Heaven wanted feel food   really hate say but looks won't back anytime soon   Maybe off day them maybe some kinks one cooks seemed training but just didn't connect place   know Wing Heaven specializes wings but just don't seem special compared other wing joints   Sorry guys   Disappointing   Heaven not  <EOR> My favorite chicken wings far! love food service great  All workers nice too! love place  <EOR> I'm giving star  because wings actually DELICIOUS!   The reason bad review simple customer service sucked! guy register apparently having bad day    Lemme rephrase bad life! ATTITUDE start  asked big wings guy acted asking free sample! Then when asked mix match asked if could 4 wings separate sauce he snapped only 5's     if already knew   All all wings really good! Jerk Sauce honestly say very pleasing   Wing Heaven needs send employee learn some manners  If don't want deal people food service industry!

I also ordered Lemon Pepper Caribbean Jerk Wings  Jerk bit sweeter chain competition less spice bit dull flavor latter  Lemon Pepper good taste dry rubbed cooked well just difficult other chain champ Lemon Pepper!  Don't compare should enjoy bad Seasoned French Fries under cooked  Starchy limp    besides cook time could heavier seasoning   sure just bad batch but consistency issue during first visit remained unpleasant even couple days meal if catch drift   Come try Chicken Waffles! <EOR> Great wings but notorious having slow wait times  Also potato wedges cheese bacon really cheese whiz dried parsley  <EOR> I haven't even tried food yet but all reviews staff exactly right  both radio sports game volume topped couldn't even hear yourself think  called place order guy phone couldn't hear either  Then when come pick food several individuals walking around pointlessly but still didn't even acknowledge there  still can't over fact freaking loud was  If could take pic post would  <EOR> My new fav wing spot Vegas! chicken waffles around when first started serve them! Since then back 4 times all same order! always see people ordering seafood menu items  when might assume delicious well  try something else sooner later but chicken waffles hooked! Never dissatisfied order here  Once tried more items write another review  <EOR> Hands down best wings LV       3 stars because food good  However understand kinks any new operation it's expected   But over time some Kim's should worked out  first visit told much chicken many flavors order due restaurant being slammed informed would 30 minute 1 hour wait  Then when inquiring other menu items questions weren't even answered just kept getting told more food ordered longer wait would be  perfectly fine waiting since heard much place obviously slammed  Then finally advised only order chicken cause didn't time anything else  Completely disappointed  Don't tell much cannot order especially when willing wait prepared spend pretty penny    My second visit little disappointing well  ordered chicken fish fries mac bites  Well     am allergic catfish point throat closes making hard breathe  chicken separate container but everything else put into same container  assumed each item would put into different container considering all different no combos ordered  Now if eat food same container fish       let's just say today wouldn't gone smoothly did  returned inside orders remade gentleman very nice replaced food  He apologized said he would talk whoever Boles order  point all food should together container  Also did see any signs pertaining allergies seafood prepared sign could over looked it  Bottom line food great but still some kinks worked out  <EOR> What kind restaurant doesn't tables customers eat on? supposed eat on? guess just want customers just order food go  food wasn't bad wasn't great either  think season wing lot better then some other chicken wing restaurants but quality chicken isn't very good either  <EOR> Should named Wing HELL!! only order incorrect 2 3 sauces tossed when specifically asked side portion sizes EXTREMELY balance most boneless wings being nothing but batter pieces  <EOR> This first time ordering here  first all service good all  close 10pm arrived approx 9 15pm  cook young man loudly complained We're still getting orders? wanna here! exactly professional   then messed drink order forget fried Mac cheese order  Now food    extremely delicious! Everything fried seasoned perfection   catfish extremely mild didn't taste muddy all  we'll give another shot but if hear complaints taking order we'll take $$ elsewhere  <EOR> My boyfriend orders wings no matter where go  fact blame decreased restaurant experiences  He hates trying anything new isn't deep fried battered  Wing Heaven right alley decided would order Garlic Parmesan wings him  didn't want any fries Panda Express side noodles  He ordered Medium wings catfish French fries  garlic wings good but EXTREMELY salty!! realized instead using fresh garlic main flavor used garlic salt powder  Luckily Panda chow mein which normally bland balanced saltiness out  took bite catfish fillets wasn't impressed  bit rubbery luke warm  C'mon called ahead time cooked first cooked way advance  sat restaurant waiting food wasn't late picking up  didn't hot crunch normally freshly fried fish  expecting take bite steamy flaky fish  Instead reminded junior high cafeteria  FISH STICK FRIDAY  gave ranch dipping sauce dipped wing tasted sour like spoiled! threw away  last thing needed food poisoning  Ain't nobody time dat!
