Our waiter did keep vanishing long periods time very difficult order additional items refills   Hence only 4 stars   The prices made little wide eyed but wasn't paying didn't really consider it  <EOR> If looking terrible 6 dollar breakfast cost 50 dollars then your place! <EOR> This best restaurant Vegas!

Cafe Americano please look into your POS systems  Something going only imagine many people repeated fraud bank coming here  only giving star because very attentive waiter patio bar service good but besides never pay cash here <EOR> The 24 hour diner Caesars Palace   and keeping tune everything Caesars food pricey but above average portions   breakfast burrito waiter asked if wanted jalapenos responded did   Breakfast well lots coffee but bill reflected $2 charge jalapenos   bad should've checked first     Had nighttime snack drinks before bed serve Tito's bar no where else casino   Took few minutes bartender acknowledge but maybe he thought just trying free jalapenos   Good food but again bit higher side   Would recommend but check if jalapenos free not  <EOR> Great breakfast! Fruit platter beautiful delicious! Keith waiter he far best waiter Vegas! back just see him  <EOR> I would highly advise dining Cafe Americano's patio  server Allison fantastic but setup failure manager  She only waitress entire patio received absolutely no help bartenders empty outdoor bar manager  took over hour drink even though could see bottle Rosè sitting bar while bartender did lift finger  speaking manager experience he promised he would checking sure rest dining experience off without hitch  He never seen again   The food good though! <EOR> Great food especially pizza!!! Pricey food but 24 hours when need most  <EOR> Very convenient next Starbucks inside Ceasers Palace  Great food excellent service  <EOR> I did intend come but rather found friend wandered night town   didn't order food bc hastiness situation price omg everything expensive but did rest friends pancakes which must say amazing!  service also incredible even though just having water   waitress very attentive   atmosphere side hotel restaurant  open 24 hours very inviting upscale nature   Idk other hours day but 2 30am place point  <EOR> My husband $100 food credit Caesars Palace chose place  24 hour restaurant located inside Caesars Palace Hotel  prices reasonable super outrageous some Hotel restaurants be  pizza amazing wings fries good too  Mind partying 3 nights anything probably would taste good  Lol jk <EOR> Luis waiter amazing! stopped 4am leaving club  Even though 4am Luis great attitude very helpful  He made great suggestion he told try Short rib nachos  nachos best nachos long time  Everything delicious nachos  chips perfection  Even though appetizer generous portion  boyfriend happily full time finished nachos  remember if come during Late Night hours DEFINITELY short rib nachos  promise won't regret it  Thanks again Luis! made feel very welcomed first visit Cafe Americana  <EOR> Ask Saul! He's best waiter treat family!! He accommodated large group 14 grace expertise!! <EOR> I lovely waitress super sweet  think she left impression me  food ok  wasn't memorable if waitress wouldn't bothered write review  food wasn't bad but just wasn't good other places Las Vegas offer  <EOR> Love place if chicken then need try chicken sandwich always lot people full bar nice cocktails  <EOR> Although many options Vegas Caesars palace pick from   always gravitate towards Cafe Americano     Last month husband stayed Caesars week came several times    Even when late table middle night able order food bar take room   The fried green tomatoes best!  If love chicken order roasted chicken breast   takes bit long since prepare when order   don't breast meat but case   perfectly spiced tender perfectly roasted    plated roasted potatoes asparagus    literally kept telling all friends try chicken Cafe Americano    Yeah good!  No   better that!!! <EOR> If prices little bit cheaper would give place 5 stars   Caesars Palace everything expensive maybe shouldn't give them less star over but feel to  burger fries picked night then picked some la cart breakfast menu items morning leaving   food surprisingly good both times   Granted paying lot would expect good but still better expected   also very fast staff very friendly helpful  <EOR> After running through various options breakfast came because convenience  staying Augustus tower  menu pretty much your standard breakfast options   WHAT ORDERED Dirty bloody mary extra spicy pretty impressed!  Huevos Rancheros loved everything plate! sausage bit salty but beans surprisingly good! Very flavorful  even bean person!  Just those 2 items alone ran $50  Pretty steep especially breakfast  good but nothing different any other brunch spot cost fraction price  <EOR> The ambiance great but food took forever served very cold upcharged each person $9 person add meatball yes ONE very small portion pasta  Extremely disappointed returning  <EOR> Breakfast food good but little overpriced $76 two people  lot food cant finish  <EOR> As many other reviews mentioned great place people watch    The food itself mediocre extremely pricey get  ordered chicken tenders pretty average but whopping $18  Most menu items selling 50% %100% markup average prices  However quality wasn't even close being that   The place itself nice    great atmosphere service  If price isn't issue then nice casual experience here  However if price factor then would recommend place   Really nice 24 hour place though ! Fancier most other food places would open late  <EOR> Staying hotel debated between place buffet breakfast  ended incorrectly thinking Americano would bargain    That said Brooklyn Breakfast Sandwich perhaps most delicious egg bacon cheese sandwich ever eaten  eggy bun very delicious tasty very fresh   I bar service great  coffee good strong but bit lukewarm  only food related blip experience    The sandwich huge able take half away late morning snack  However plus cup coffee tax tip $36    The buffet $38 no doubt fruit other nice breakfast options  Probably better split both decadent healthy food   Glad tried but may buffet next time eat breakfast inside hotel  <EOR> This place convenient open 24 hours day great when want eat something can't find anywhere open  area huge cute trees lights inside  ordered pepperoni pizza pretty good  Overall pretty satisfied  <EOR> We ate breakfast valentine's day delicious! sat really quickly did wait long server either  ate huevos rancheros steak eggs side bagel cream cheese  both amazing  huevos rancheros tortillas bottom beans salsa your choice eggs top side hash   spicy all but full flavor  bf picked steak eggs skillet but given different steak eggs  Still good over cooked but still enjoyed it  would definitely back way  <EOR> Overrated overpriced   Passed spot couple times when Vegas  Decided try late breakfast  told serving breakfast anymore but could still order some eggs toast  Well 2 fried eggs 3 slices cheap white bread     Payed $14 bucks $8 2 fried eggs $6 some piece cheap looking tasting white bread counting tip taxes! Insane!
