Have eaten Sushi Boy Desu three different times last 6 months  Each time food outstanding! much food little money  highly recommend restaurant  <EOR> This place came highly recommended partner former co workers   opted all eat dinner $21 99 which DID include sashimi others stated   included 6 orders 2 pieces per order NIGIRI   Nigiri sashimi atop cold somewhat sweet rice just smidge   shall call skid mark?   of wasabe   Apparently you're supposed eat whole thing discard cold rice mound sits under fish otherwise you'll charged it    we didn't through that   Luckily waiter simply gave verbal warning   proceeded put all cold rice mounds napkin slyly bathroom toss toilet   007 style betch   Anyway rolls nigiri fresh tasted supposed to   nothing remarkable nothing substandard   overall good sushi good value all eat option   Besides sushi following items worth mentioning tastiness miso soup shrimp veggie tempura edamame served hot sprinkled salt   We definitely money's worth good value decent food  <EOR> Sadly place changed worst  wish written review when loved place but now its just disappointing  <EOR> I'm only giving 3 stars 2 reasons mediocre service so so presentation  restaurant located near UNLV which probably explains why everything only mediocre because caters mostly students  food quality prices great though  Palatability questionable first glance because presentation mentioned earlier  good promos 12 rolls 5 99 usd    extremely cheap good tasting food  <EOR> Never bad time but only twice  Definitely lunch kind place  <EOR> A decent no frills place sushi best suited lunchtime in and out   rolls la carte indulge all eat special   sushi isn't always freshest taking bit gamble one   Still never TERRIBLE experience when you've sushi crazing between classes where want go  <EOR> I usually eat Yama Sushi Flamingo Maryland Pkwy  brother eaten Sushi Boy Desu before recommended saying sushi pretty good  Well   lemme start off saying establishment EMPTY! No restaurant   that should warning sign us  Sushi okay par Yama ALL   We opted All Eat we came around 3 30pm waiter said we'd charged Regular AYCE  okay that   well   they thing where put Teriyaki sauce EVERY ROLL  best way cover taste fishy fish friends  very fishy smelling fish rolls fight back urge puke   Not only charged EACH DRINK  ordered two sodas when asked if wanted another said yes   unbeknownst charged $1 29 EACH cause yes canned sodas  would understand if waiter doing pouring pitcher but can? Seriously? total spent $5 20 4 sodas   way expensive if ask me   Our bill came $56  charged mochi well!  Service poor sushi average  Never come again  If want good food good service DECENT price Yama Sushi few mins away  <EOR> We tried place just because close Stephano's Gyros  should've gone Stephano's Gyros    The sushi below average while prices little high  stomach satisfied end meal  same price could've gotten fill twice over next door    We lunch specific lunch menu half selection dinner menu has  felt suckered  Most lunch items rolls sashimi nigiri    Bottom line return    * off strip non casino <EOR> This Nobu's  close    It some $100 person high end sushi restaurant higher end hotels Las Vegas Strip  No way   You know sushi buy deli section take home Safeway?   That probably lot closer   Sou desu! translation right! sushi restaurant within block UNLV  students value?   Cheap food!  So place specializes not so good but fairly cheap sushi    It Korean owned course  But many years somebody comes regularly  guess starving students want splurge sushi before finals     Or if blew all your money tables slots glitzy Strip Casino hotel then probably tighten your belt come sushi right?   You enough eat $20 here   That dish Nobu's  <EOR> Decent sushi served sad small atmosphere  Food served old dirty looking plates  appetizing when plated raw fish seaweed  Since Cafe Mitz shutdown replaced repulsive Teriyaki Time only place within reasonable walking distance serves sushi  offer student specials if buy more two roles chosen list  bit cheaper lot places but when you're done eating ask yourself Did really spend more $8 two roles?   Yes did then proceed slump your next class still hungry  UNLV desperate need excellent sushi spot there's lot potential here  Sadly Sushi Boy Desu can't deliver  <EOR> I am pretty limited only order thing wheedubop   Say three times fast!  countless times always want fine item   Usually when male waiter comment Only Koreans order smile   This bowl includes miso soup   bowl created part kitchen part sushi chef consists white rice lettuce nori chopped jalepenos seeded smelt roe sashimi red snapper tuna salmon krab egg yolk spicy sauce like bimibap sauce    refreshing uncooked besides rice haha part rice bowl part salad plenty eat   mmm! <EOR> I'm very picky sushi when area town decided try it  very glad didn't read Yelp reviews because seems most reviews written bitter customers can't follow simple AYCE rules restaurant  Making sure eat all portion without wasting rice etc  The place owned nice Korean family  pleased friendly fish very fresh  price right while didn't AYCE spoke them found unlike other places Sushi Boy doesn't place time limit your eating session    I would gladly return if area  <EOR> I twice don't really any complaints    The staff friendly all eat sushi dinner 21 99 yes includes sashimi fed quickly both times both times place dead  Which fine just means food lot quicker    Sushi seemed fresh decor? Well gives shit all food     Bottom line if your complaining prices didn't all eat special just put your foot your mouth     All all would back if place down street house would all time  <EOR>
