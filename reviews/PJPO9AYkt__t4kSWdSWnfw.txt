Would recommend friend also would return! D <EOR> Service worst part visit! menu seems really good tasty but if can't your order right don't serve everyone table same time kills your lunch experience  mother's order worst  She ordered teriyaki steak bowl  bowl came 10 minutes rest orders first all  Secondly she ended only eating steak because rice swimming literally swimming teriyaki sauce  teriyaki soup rice  mom wanting complain much didn't mention until all done she finished most steak  she counter just tell them hat messed order asking anything return but just them aware type dishes serving  husband ordered fries sandwich given salad  made giving side fries but fries he given looked bottom fryer fries all scrape pieces over cooked  salad ok but chicken didn't seem grilled more defrosted chicken now think sure if dressing not  Anyways won't back just hope work quality control  <EOR> So back friend knows order here   tasty lots food    A completely different experience last time although friend says other location waaaay better    My friend says eggs organic  Did hear staff please double check   The hash browns signature potatoes unusual unexpected  seems hash brown potatoes wrapped around mashed potatoes   Very unusual  kind taste few time  Liked It  Very different try them    The eggs absolutely perfectly cooked! Over medium exactly that    The meats special assorted  am spam fan waste    I wish option bread  skipped did friends  paid no other choice  think could improved on    The bacon crispy tasted great    I some kind chocolate carib drink very good     It menu could better understood photos  new person off putting   hope add photo menu iPad screen something help new people order    Sitting outside extremely pleasant    Definitely recommend  <EOR> Love MTO  Friendly staff several delicious options choose from  Good breakfast lunch dinner  sure check if you're around Downtown Summerlin  <EOR> Food tasty staff nice but didn't seem rush despite long line  took 30+ minutes two sandwiches other reviewers mentioned   asked box end waitress smiled said oops forgot! All well but when coupled slow movement staff generally realize complacency lack urgency location   Even 2 years reviews stating service mediocre doesn't seem improvement   Anyone listening?  don't see myself coming back here  <EOR> This place should better rating  Great breakfast brunch food  If you're area check out  <EOR> THE BOB organic chicken arugula roasted tomatoes jack cheddar pecan honey mustard wheat + fries  Everyone should basically just thank later  fries really good    Service friendly  Prices fair  A great casual restaurant summerlin much better other similar concepts nearby IMO <EOR> Oh gosh! died gone heaven! Chicken waffles best! glad block home! Never thought I'd see day mall restaurants would here! <EOR> Okay price  hen house which basically chicken cesar wrap  $11 came giant bowl fries  wrap smaller side feel paid more fries wrap  Both good but impressive  wanted try chicken pot pie but wasnt hungry enough  Maybe next time!  Service fair when did encounter staff  placing orders headed outside wait food  table 5 order numbers which understand quite bit group but server mixed few times  He grabbed wrong numbers take back serving certain items  caused mishaps somehow forgot order completely  friend back inside ask going on  said working but he didn't food until all pretty much done everything  odd since another friend ordered same exact thing!  At end meal back inside ask box take home leftovers  stood counter good 5 minutes before someone finally realized there  can't imagine annoyed would if walking  first time waiting order something! manager came apologize but could definitely work being more attentive counter  <EOR> Two words come mind overpriced mediocre   I MTO last weekend girlfriend son little brother  arrived around 11 place pretty packed  menu fairly limited but settled Hangover Burger ordered BLTAE little guy  choked when she told total   could served paid much less  guess use better ingredients but really can't tell final product   Our food came promptly expecting greatness  burger smothered some sort sauce maybe thousand island iceberg lettuce  whole entire time eating concoction thinking Smashburger's Sin City burger which half cost 1000 times more tasty    There no reason ever return  plenty other options DS  Skip one! <EOR> It's just overpriced below mediocre quality is  Even if moderately priced still good food opinion  burger would preferred any basic burger places it  good idea business model wise but don't know why think charge much money bland food is  didn't downtown location either  <EOR> Although staff friendly customer service absolutely terrible  ordered three simple drinks  coffee vanilla latte hot chocolate  sat down expecting drinks ready within few minutes just would wait other cafes  waited nearly 20 minutes until finally decided depart demand refund  time two other groups people served drinks within few minutes placing orders  party consisted six people which all ordered drink  demand refund manager openly said sorry  priorities backwards  Um? Sir if your priorities backwards sure should operating cafe  <EOR> Ugh want love you! good experience MTO downtown but pretty place failed bad just coffee  Which sacred me  cold windy MTO all its orange glory  walked greeted great smiles ordered simple latte  said dined MTO downtown ready enjoy coffee when tasted steamed milk  popped top off see looked steamed milk splash espresso  color wrong purchase  brought back remade again although slightly better wasn't should be  anyway     <EOR> Food delicious!!! menu awesome service wonderful!!! cronut burger amazing!!! give large portions!

Turkey Melt Sandwich shared 3 1 year old! don't eat much but plenty food! fries ranch chipotle sauce bomb according 3 year old  Lol <EOR> I WANT love MTO  But they're inconsistent take out food looks sad!  When dining delicious usually fresh presentation decent  When picking eating 5 minutes later salads pathetic contain half much food so why am paying same price??   fries limp soggy  way keep them crispy?    I also wish gluten free options just a sandwich lettuce wrap soup but gluten free wrap something more!!!    MTO could better <EOR> I've only once but ordered sweet spicy salad pretty tasty   friends ordered different salad ordered grill cheese tomato soup both liked food    wasn't anything spectacular place but good enough I'd back try something else another time <EOR> This place just keeps getting better! visited Downtown location many times Summerlin just great  whole atmosphere really cool    I'm lying when tell hard decide because everything just good  Everything fresh if try something Fat Elvis  can't wrong French toast sandwich filled peanut butter bacon Nutella topped off powdered sugar    This place opened only two weeks ago runs place  years  greeted second walked food came quickly  Nothing but amazing things say place!!
