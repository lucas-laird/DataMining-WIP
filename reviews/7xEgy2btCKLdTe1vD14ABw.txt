A differenza delle recensione sarò stata fortunata ma ho assaggiato l hambuger più buono di sempre  Lo straconsiglio sopratutto quello con bacon e cheddar la fine del mondo  Ci ritornerei volentieri se potessi  <EOR> Customer service terrible!  What's worst root beer float   She only give 1 4 root beer into cup  mean wrong her?  ask more she gets pissed off when fault! She's Cook Cashier he painted long blue nails when give coins she gets pissed off too!  Now restaurant allows Cooks food server painted long nails? <EOR> I'm impressed    This first visit ANY Johnny Rockets  terribly hungry picky   When hungry waiting your meal LAST thing want see crew table area dancing Chubby Checker   The burger passable but price expected better  Chili fries delicious made good gas later night  <EOR> I come Vegas several times year worst food experiences here!!!  I understand Christmas Day food court busy but service inexcusable! line just order 2 shakes  Then proceeded patiently wait family while watched many others orders  However did notice many other customers also complaining being mischarged getting wrong orders  observed workers started order filling couple plastic cups ice cream    but then left them open counter unfinished next 30 minutes!!!  After 30 long minutes and several other customers ordered full meals received orders workers finally decided finish shakes same old ice cream sitting out! Even then wait someone ordered 2 minutes ago order before gave shakes    So close asking full refund! Never coming back again!!! <EOR> I'm fan Johnny Rockets guess because ole Soda Shop Feel   probably bit disadvantage because where located   Bar only isn't any intimacy your date wife whatever   The staff friendly thought Strawberry Shake good   Onion Rings didn't really sit well though  bit crisp didn't care oil using  Burger good though great but ate whole thing least good enough that!  As all nearby places prices undoubtedly elevated fit location keep mind  <EOR> Just juicy burger place super pleased quickly brought me! waitress great customer baby loved her! We'll coming back soon when she's there <EOR> Good burgers  Ordered original burger fries  Reasonable price considering grand canal 10 76 dollars  would definitely say burger very tasty fries aren't bad although little thicker prefer  Also only annoying thing new ketchup bottles really hard time getting ketchup come out  <EOR> Was going through #thestruggle pretty much eating all day needing SOMETHING system   Luckily Palazzo still connected Grand Canal Shoppes   Which just happens contain food court  actually reasonable terms price options     Johnny Rockets probably best option all them which honestly really doesn't say all much rest food court   But Smoke House Double job done right before hitting club   Gotta them cals dying dance floor! <EOR> This food court counter rather restaurant many locations off strip  few seats counter then many seats food court area  looking something fast eat decided this  all enjoyed food  your basic diner type food which enjoyed  employees nice food quickly  food court also pretty nice clean  also quiet place strip   I eaten multiple times enjoyed every time  <EOR> Came family dinner  host upfront very good job but servers following good when came running all food together  Half table all orders 30 minutes before second half  Would recommend coming unless willing wait long period time  Shout soulless servers idgaf attitude  <EOR> This place run horribly  cheddar steak Philly sandwiches  <EOR> Okay folks tried Johnny Rockets vegetarian burger fries soda  first things first cost almost $18 that  freaking serious Johnny Rockets  $18 veggie burger fries soda  worst veggie burger life  should paid eat it  people hardly spoke behind counter  Plus place looked pretty dingy  Venetian which supposed kind upscale place  Now located canal Shoppes  Never ever  should pay if come eat there  threw over half away  Even fries sucked Fries never suck  Johnny Rockets definitely isn't used be  Wish could give negative Stars  <EOR> This worst Johnny Rockets ever usually Johnny Rockets  prices almost double normal price other JR locations    If Venetian feel urge burger n couple miles far more superior way cheaper  <EOR> only iced tea son milkshake   tea weak but strawberry shake pretty dang awesome   Pricey Vegas is  saw blue man group later evening good show but again pricey <EOR> We looking quick breakfast place came across place food court which also buy entree coupon Venetian Grand Canal Shopping funbook  Well probably only thing  good it  omelet awfully greasy nothing tasteful those greasy eggs  cannot even finish half them  guess paid for <EOR> Ol school good old fashion fat grease just burger should be  Visiting Vegas your Healthy California lifestyle? place might kill try subway street  Want fantastic burger you'll love while you're eating but regret later? get's no better this!

I would imagine if restaurant busy may frustrated long wait get   But think rest assured quality food same other Johnny Rockets restaurants   During visit restaurant many seats available sit at    the wait staff quick say hello take drink orders   ordered Patty Melt Onion Rings Iced Tea   my food par other Johnny Rockets restaurants   food service excellent!  My bill came almost $16 tip which believe slightly higher normal  Johnny Rockets restaurant's higher pricing probably due location Venetian   But nice know quality same each different locations   Four Yelp Stars! p <EOR> A quick lunch before hitting road  Located food court Venetian    Pretty much chose place since counter waiter service  No self service    The chicken fingers really really good  BLT totally loaded bacon    Our server attentive yet kept distance  <EOR> After four days going restaurants nice getting quick straightforward breakfast without having waited upon   omelet  good fresh made big portion size   definitely stop back if staying Venetian need quick breakfast without all wait  <EOR> I ordered shake while friend eating lunch   wasn't hungry   The shake    meh   I straw drink shake   Bad idea   back spoon   Bad idea   comes dilemna    spoon straw?
