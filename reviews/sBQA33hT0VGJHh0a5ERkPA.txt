Needing break Strip prices fancy Casino restaurants ventured found place  really pleased food portion size  Pho great flavor loved peanut sauce spring rolls  <EOR> Gave place because big grand opening sign front   walk decor modern quite few more upgrades typical Pho restaurant   food okay nothing special   breakdown thought Large Pho Ga       Broth 2 stars White pepper overload salty most places tried    Chicken 2 stars much but texture ok     Noodles 4 stars Nice cooked desired texture     Portion 1 star portion size big  large therefore still really hungry meal    My buddy ordered Pork Chop Rice looked more filling   probably should ordered instead   If come back restaurant order Pho but probably rice dishes    If salty peppery broth place you  <EOR> I pleased pho but other dishes fell short   I wanted try new pho place Chinatown always passed place but never tried it  finally chance eat other day  ordered beef pho shrimp noodle bowl spring rolls   The spring rolls OK  tastes unusually chewy texture threw off  peanut sauce looks home made because extra chunky which enjoyed much more  Other uber great peanut sauce nothing special spring rolls   The shrimp noodle bowl pretty good but some reason noodles clumped together looked unprepared  give huge serving but when half clumped noodle isn't appealing  Ugh   Thankfully really enjoyed pho  broth oily side but overkill  others may much but flavors broth very delicious  load broth many scoops pepper paste usually broth dilutes rather quickly  However still taste broth beyond pepper paste  Pleasantly surprised!  The other dishes hit miss definitely won't order spring rolls again  spring noodle bowl decent but nothing harp about  pho other hand very filling  probably again just pho  <EOR> Nothing special but some Pho price higher end  stick some other places    <EOR> This place received some poor ratings sure why  recently Mom both veterans Pho very pleasantly surprised  Good portions good prices tasty! ordered #20 basic rare beef pho very good  Broth perfect! under overly seasoned  very good  #4 spring rolls da bomb! just returned w hubby he agrees quality food flavors   MENTION clean restaurant restrooms most places Spring MTn  well kept inside  Even starbucks China town dingy gross    Get #4 Spring Rolls #20 basic Pho!!

Any hoo interior well kept pho comes lightning fast just long took type far    Marbling meat always scares but wasn't iridescent   rare steak bit  gamey weird but brisket never ending   broth clear did effects much MSG   Loads meat but no tendon maybe somewhere   I sorta recall piece while chewing but late confirm cause morsel being munched on   interior design did exemplify old Saigon ambiance me   but then again heck should know   verdict is    iss aight    <EOR> Never judge book its cover   I remember first time drove past place  saw big fancy red neon sign words grand opening just knew try place  just looked going delicious    So finally took chance day during lunch  walked inside thought myself looks clean looks nice don't think disappointed   I ordered oxtail Pho pork skin eggrolls The broth oxtail Pho actually decent  smelled good tasted good good balance flavors  oxtail left much desired  tough hard bite left many many strands meat teeth  soon back work begging toothpick and or dental floss   The pork skin spring roll wasn't bad just bit dry  Thank goodness dipping sauces    When check walked counter lady told total  asked receipt when she told total saw trying double charge spring rolls  think intentionally trying overcharge me? course  Did remove double charge once pointed course    So wasn't BAD first time experience nor GREAT first time experience  next time hunny decided going Pho told place off went    This time ordered special combo Pho did he  also ordered shrimp pork spring rolls    Never life did feel such dumb ass  Okay sure felt dumb ass previously life but point  told pretty impressed Pho both bowls completely bland flavorless  noodles soft meat tough if know am very particular when comes Pho  If hint silver tinge color meat just ruins appetite  Neither finished bowls Pho seriously contemplated going favorite spot but didn't want feel complete F A's just called night    Do let forget when both bit into pork shrimp spring roll immediately spit out  flavor off meat tasted old  Nasty!!  If flavorless broth then place you  If know good Pho then highly suggest staying away place   I thought would good place based soley looks  Lesson learned  <EOR>
