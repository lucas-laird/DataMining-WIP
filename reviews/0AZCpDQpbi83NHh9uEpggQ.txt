First off told kids eat free purchase adult entrée  Then told he didn't think computer going take them off because ordered 'special menu'  Excuse me? Um yes always attempted explain he kept saying he wasn't sure he new  asked if he could find case change order he tells he can't unless he cashing out  Ok ask if he could ask manager he told there's no manager duty  serious? business no manager duty? call BS that  Anyways tell fine just take ordered see computer does check out  Two minutes later he comes tells yes take kids meals off  Good  Well comes check time he gives bill full price milk didn't order  Try explain register he argues he did take 3 kids meals off yes did order milk  wife argue no he did remove kids meals no did order milk  He finally adjusts ticket amazing total $61 supposedly free kids meals $34 once he fixed it  During whole process ask again manager told no manager duty  think  unprofessional sounds he didn't want manager involved manager told them did want disturbed because doubt would no manager duty  Another thing worth noting wouldn't waste time calling server told someone phone would call back he busy people waiting him  Talk unprofessional! calling ihop tomorrow speaking manager provided there's duty unprofessional lousy service received now another location  also calling corporate office well  <EOR> Can never wrong pancakes right ?
