Then he all oh wasn't sure if wanted yeah ordered shortrib    He's oh but didn't waitress give sample   very confused   He said oh chefs decided lobster all night short rib      Ok     Why didn't tell when clearly ordered it??   So much confusion    awkward    overpriced  dishes well executed staff seemed well meshed  thought maybe when seated bar before reservation è awkward forgot seated é late even though very early    But apparently staff disconnect common theme here     <EOR> My husband decided splurge 5 year anniversary try molecular gastronomy cuisine place offer  made reservations month advance thru email printed signed scanned confirmation received golden tickets mail    We arrived host stand Jaleo seated bar while waited rest party arrive made drink selections  opted cocktail pairing mocktail pairing    We escorted into back room which decorated rather whimsically room lined library card catalogue drawers little doll cage  little weird but off putting   The chefs introduced themselves began creating first cocktail some liquid nitrogen  then each many courses assembled front then served fine dining style could all eat same time comment enjoyed dish  lot fun really everything good  Some standouts and don't menu front just put lamest terms blue cheese filled appetizer chicken dish pork dish  surprisingly also liked chocolate shavings olive oil which combo would never think would work but did! Anyway won't into detail every dish because sure menu changes all time don't know except but worth it    The cocktail pairing exclusively wine usual most restaurants but actually included few cocktails some wine beer coffee drink  mocktail included drinks similar cocktail pairing albeit alcohol some things tomato water watermelon fresca sangria  thought mocktail pairing really fun glad husband ordered both could try all it    The service impeccable  only complaint didn't see much molecular gastronomy hoped since most items already prepared ahead time then just assembled front you  Still worth experience $$$$ spend  Left restaurant feeling satisfied buzzed  Good times! <EOR> Such awesome experience!

Scanned emailed credit card information seats reserved   Now experience   When arrive they request least 15 min early seated near bar presented list cocktails wines ipad   give option getting alcohol pairings meal just ordering la carte   opted la carte since food wine plus costs almost much wine pairing food probably would added much more terms enjoyment      Once show time taken into secluded rather well decorated room semi circular table around which 8 seats   sous chef waiting gave brief introduction   Then began rolling 22 courses I still need count pictures right front eyes using various molecular techniques   technique which prevailed through multiple dishes process making purees and or drinks modifying some natural substance then dropping into bowl liquid form identical spheres liquid   prepared different temperatures show stable only low temperature but also relatively high temperatures   first cocktail enclosed rather large sphere presented soup spoon another pureed white bean enclosed small spheres presented shallow bowl broth     Overall experience both exciting educating   allowed ask any questions liked processes using   portions just right never felt waiting long between courses   did feel hungry end very satisfied meal   Some memorable dishes were Truffle flavored cotton candy enclosed cocktail turbot deep friend bone marrow saffron flavored ice cream chocolate shavings   drinks paired end gin tonic   Everybody raving tried one   AMAZING!  never liked gin before but balance nice overpowering gin   used large round sphere ice surface area ice less would end diluting drink quickly!

It paled miserably comparison 16 course dinners Robuchon though latter did cost twice much  Furthermore when returned latter subsequent visits relative disappointments well compared first two dinners back 2005 2006 when first opened  before Robuchon sold all other celebrity chefs started opening branches all over globe moving best people onto next new venture once latest established! Not digress further thought 16 course dinner @ e' poorly conceived executed! should two seatings serve only 10 courses may charge less attract wider audience settle open seating Robuchon does least did charge more cover cost really slowly savor nuances 16 courses assuming deservingly it! At e' while 16 course dinner lasted well over 2 hours feel being herded around helpless cows moving course next hardly time savor individual dish before your taste buds overwhelmed next  latter subject did think courses creative memorable either  other reviewers put well aimed exotic unique but failed being delicious same time!  I better dinners Bazaar Jose' other franchise LA third cost come each time more satisfied  Better yet even better service more creative bolder dishes Michael Voltaggio's Ink chef @ Bazaar before he decided leave write own culinary chapter   If stuck  Vegas yet want pampered truly great dining experience accompanied superlative service then vote Pierre Gagnier's Twist @ Mandarin Oriental! In conclusion e' bad but simply better sake your wallet taste buds both mention pursuit mere simple dining pleasure going elsewhere! <EOR> When came first time 2011 certainly very impressed even comparing jose's other restaurant Bazaar  Therefore when came second time kept expectation low feeling would able any better first time  Somehow able wow again almost different menu! Some dishes 2011 just creative tasty us  2012 version absolutely no complaints every single dish  usually don't write reviews unless dining experience really good really bad  E sure winner re looking forward again once change heir menu again  Bring your date impress  life time experience  =] <EOR> I'm very torn review Jaleo  Yelp!

WD 50 New York    place he swore would never go   heh heh heh      <EOR> We came dinner Friday before Christmas cool experience  First all only reservation e mail midnight PST 30 days before want go  Those lot rules eating Las Vegas but worth it  only 8 seats able 6 them  whole experience 3 hours pretty cool   We started frozen gin tonic which weird flavor  lime citrus but gin tonic frozen into ice ball  Snacks next first dish called Flower which raspberry purée petals made raspberry  looked cool tasted cool served plate shaped Jose Andres' hand  Then came beet ring which very delicate ring beet flavor gold specks top  sure would possess someone create beet ring but good  favorite snack Chicaronnes which honey glazed perfectly crunchy    The appetizer portion meal next  first dish called Gypsy's arm which green apple blue cheese meringue  meringue light fluffy but blue cheese apple tart  Then came nitrogen almond cup which topped caviar  then served crispy chicken skin escabeche sauce topped thyme foam  skin perfect foam thymy which probably word but should be   jamon Iberico topped caviar salty fatty great  meat perfectly cured caviar great bite  coolest looking appetizer Ferran Adria's olive  olive purée membrane outside olive liquid inside  final appetizer bocata del calamari which fried uni sandwich cucumber  sandwich delicious   Our next molecular alcoholic drink white sangria made cava came membrane  reminded olive except alcoholic very strong   Next show moved dinner portion menu  started artichoke purée which artichoke hearts topped black truffles artichoke purée  dish good but truffles amazing  Next came lobster which fresh cooked perfectly served side jasmine foam citrus fruits  chickpea stew rich fatty base chickpeas made chickpea essence membrane outside essence into chickpea shape  mushrooms paper served rosemary foam white truffle topping  chanterelle porcini mushrooms cooked rich creamy broth topped rosemary foam  dish great  Next came turbot plate  turbot cooked perfectly crispy skin side tender fish  also bone marrow puff pastry topped caviar  awesome compliment fish  Next came salt baked foie gras  When ate thought myself food should taste all time   perfect  last main course Iberico ham steak squid la pancha parsley air  pork chewy nice taste  squid sauce great   Finally desserts cheeses  cheese called torta de la Serena served toasted bread sweet sauce  Next flan oranges ice which light dessert most ice  oranges bitter but ice added texture dish There edible flower caramel flan  panko un chocolate which crunchy creamy bread chocolate together  arroz con leche cold rice pudding sticky outside  great treat chocolate truffle which chocolate outside but truffles inside  pretty light very tasty  Finally 25 second bis coco which light springy citrus paper which crunchy sour   The meal expensive service spectacular setting intimate  If reservation should go  worth every penny  <EOR> All all great experience food tasted good  everything hit ball park but everything packed flavor  many times tasting menu fancy schmancy restaurant end feeling tasting concepts rather good flavorful food  none here  While cooking techniques more avant garde isn't sense walk away with  Instead sense techniques used augment flavor food rather demonstrate technical proficiency  standouts night vermouth mussels black cod served fantastic sauce wagyu ribeye which likely best steak outside proper steakhouse seriously want try Bazaar Meat SLS hotel but likely different experience when go   My wife shared wine pairing which featured Spanish wines which well meal  Being light weight even sharing wine pairing left dazed ears ringing time left restaurant  if light weight may best option you   We previously tried Jaleo inside which é José Andrés resides very impressed even paella seemed lackluster but very happy meal experience here  Yes expensive side things forcing subsist bread water ensuing two months but view Spanish food through mind Jose Andres  would recommend bypassing Jaleo going directly é then learn really enjoy stale bread afterwards butter ketchup mayonnaise long way toward revitalizing leftover bread    A word caution however  sitting where everyone seemed want demonstrate foodies   woman could stop commenting everything best thing she ever all while trying drop hints much she knows food all previous conquests  She even did best replicate Meg Ryan's scene When Harry Met Sally when she eating ham cheese sandwich  saw free entertainment accompanied meal  <EOR> It's best meals life  Even

expertly creatively crafted  especially liked while all dishes wildly creative nothing over top weird just sake showing off technique  Everything purpose added taste texture dish  lot molecular gastronomy going throughout meal but none felt obtrusive    We wine pairings which probably unnecessary hindsight  None pairings bad but memorable either    One thing note meal served private room bar

Finally planned advance August 22  fun delicious would back but top notch should hype price  Also few things didn't experience explained below   The meal served small dining area back right bar  Eight people sit around small kitchen where some prep work done  didn't dark clearly done mood but beyond typical mood lighting made difficult see everything going on  am also sure felt seating arrangement  made dinner conversation bit awkward you pretty much don't feel comfortable talking much other food front strangers   fun able see some prep but truth most done front amounted plating pouring sauces squeezing filling into tubes etc  other molecular gastronomy restaurants much more theatrical table side shows restaurant did kitchen set bit disappointing   The food definite highlight! many stand out courses like salt crusted foie gras although portion tiny compared huge mass brought show before taking back kitchen cut!   gave lot really interesting combinations chocolate olive oil other savory sweet combinations even when combinations didn't quite work really interesting but most them really worked! A tip beverage pairing lower end one  usually just because don't think refined enough huge difference!
