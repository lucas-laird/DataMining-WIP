I hanging mushroom pool no idea other pools are  water slide lots kids adult pool back too  <EOR> I guess there's pros cons pool     Pro's A variety pools An 18 over section  music top 40s personally At 18 over section nice lounge chairs  Cons No shade Not enough lounge chairs and if find sore back laying it You PAY shade lounge chairs $35 2 chairs shade $5 chair adult section I kinda disappointed since already paid resort fees   Not sure if returning  <EOR> My wife rented cabana yesterday adult pool great time   cabana stocked Gatorade water assortment snacks  lounge chairs couch very comfortable  only real issue service good but great  servers very nice prompt when getting food drinks but did come around enough  felt look them more times would wanted renting cabana  Overall great relaxing day would cabana again especially price  <EOR> I came because town friends staying Excalibur   numerous pools choose from  chose 21 over pool  Water murky filled leaves  hardly any shade unless rent cabana prepared sunscreen   There top 40 music playing  staff member offers massages pool heat day everyone watching? The pool also near parking garage sounds cars driving didn't help promote relaxing atmosphere   There plenty comfy lounge chairs lay on  pool towels UGH! Small scratchy something would use dry dog off maybe?  Thank goodness town friends thinking staying another hotel when visit next time  <EOR> Great  5 pools 2 small hot tubs  loved it   Chairs aren't comfy but hey      <EOR> Zwembad bestaat uit vier zwembaden waarvan één betaalde adult pool  Adult pool afgesloten d m v  een hek  Tijdens mijn verblijf een zwembad gesloten  Verder waren alle baden open  Bij het 'hoofd' zwembad zal je de meeste drukte vinden en ook vrij harde muziek  Er zijn principe genoeg vrije bedjes maar rond 11 00 het behoorlijk druk  Handdoeken krijg je op vertoon van je hotelpas bij de ingang van het zwembad   Nadelen alcohol drinkende Amerikanen op en langs het zwembad  Heeft meer iets met hygiëne te maken dan dat je er daadwerkelijk heel veel last van hebt  Zwembad water ook wat aan de koude kant mei  <EOR> I laid free pools  perfectly sufficient  lounge chairs fine if lay towel it  crowds quickly definitely early morning snag better positioned lounge chair s   lot families children but also lot lifeguards watch  someone does rowdy children especially lot them together concentrated locale surprisingly undisturbed them just laid reading book sipping savory cool bloody mary   The water pool quite cold but looked clean both days went  <EOR> The pool area pretty good size which wasn't packed when arrived  bar didn't much wait but fun story bartender     My sister already first drink phones ID's little table next lounge chairs ready next drink grabbed ID walked back bartender he looked ID gave drink no problems  walking back realized accidentally grabbed sister's ID bartender didn't even notice double take all! sister don't look anything alike face! Just 2 years apart age both blonde hair  Hopefully he looks little more closely people's IDs when they're busier  If only tried when underage!   Later day other sister showed definitely picked drinking pace thought would good idea start drinking while pool     2 those huge souvenir cups alcohol later ass can't even hell outta pool! legs literally stopped working looked paraplegic while half drunk sisters tried carrying outta pool  But apparently once feet hit pavement thought become invincible began running back room drunken toddler through casino  Needless say sisters room but mom impressed    So yeah     the Excalibur fun! <EOR> I really surprised when pool Excalibur much nicer expected  When first entered hotel slightly worse then excepted  wouldn't say where beautiful people come hang more tired parents tourists dint know any better  pool totally different  4 pool areas connected another farthest being adults only pool music playing  thought would splashed kicked annoyed little kids all day but wasn't all  Excalibur sure made kiddies but lot centered around pool area other three mostly adults  lay enjoy sun peace  way don't hate kids  <EOR> Excalibur now updating pool experience Drenched    guess appeal day club crowd?  Geez   exactly expected     After walking Strip Wynn back ready cool off relax   no idea large pool area would crowded     My naïveté thinking would traditional pool folks just lounging   Turned squatters version day club murky water drunken college folks or those revisiting glory days people getting whistled back lifeguards taking beverages deep  resort fee hard work   Whatever      Smokers overdone tattoos galore!  Tons butt floss bikinis board shorts never seen board   relaxing poolside hangout all!  Better head your room turn shower on   #Yelp 365 049 365 <EOR> Excalibur Hotel closed huge swimming pools during winter months when prior coming informed pools would remain opened   Hotel guests instructed use Luxor Hotel's swimming pool 10 00 16 00 hours  <EOR> One top kid friendly pools Las Vegas   There multiple pools lot lounge chairs 30 000 square foot Excalibur pool area    The most exciting family friendly pools Slide Pool which cool rock formation along side pool includes very fun water slide well waterfalls flowing rocks onto edges pool    Another pool very shallow area which good lying sun while water having your non swimming kids playing water    You upgrade two plush lounge chairs umbrella bucket ice 3 small water bottles 3 bags chips $50 until pool area closes 6pm  <EOR> When comes pools Vegas Excalibur boasts lower tier options   The pool easily accessible anyone I think weren't screened anyone    doesn't feel comfortable leaving stuff dip   Every pool no deeper 3 half feet  fact told five curmudgeony life guards perch high above pool seem some most unapproachable people Las Vegas   But back point   3 half feet? barely puts legs water?
