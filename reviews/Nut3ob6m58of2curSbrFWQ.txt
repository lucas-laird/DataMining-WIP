Tired breakfast sandwich routine stopped Don Tortaco location Saturday morning breakfast burrito  very filling exactly expected  massive filled eggs cheese sausage potatoes  Piping hot very satisfying    The menu isn't extensive other similar places but typical taco shop goodies  place very clean salsa bar well stocked  love agua fresca fountain which HORCHATA  Mexican food + horchata way go  don't having counter ask refill definitely plus  extra star that  Check specials board some great deals  <EOR> Always clean friendly staff remembers always gets order correct prompt! <EOR> Had lunch last month ordered shredding beef taquitos combo  Beef bland tasted old only edible items rice beans  returning location  <EOR> The staff friendly but food mediocre  beef enchiladas which did much meat very oily  also tried beef nachos beef used tender flavorful used real cheese instead nacho cheese which made good  But guacamole average seasoned over abundance beans it  plus place open 24 hours  <EOR> Love specific location! Everything comes fast point! big diff competition way meats cooked decently priced menu! long    Roberto's! <EOR> I came Tuesday  ordered breakfast burrito bacon one  Very good taste great also ordered 99 cent chicken tacos Tuesday took them friends very very dry definitely expected definitely order chicken tacos again here  But wonderful selection burritos <EOR> The nachos BOMB!!! Very clean restaurant which great compared some nasty fast food Mexican restaurants  <EOR> I entering restaurant held door open lady worked she bringing trashcan disposing trash   ordered food afterwards watched same lady put trash bags existing trashcans kitchen   expected wash hands but instead she put gloves started cooking food   left amazement because lady taking order tag displayed Clark County Health District   thought wow now can't eat that   Fail Don Tortaco Clark County Health District   Obviously employees didn't learn thing  <EOR> Yay! am definitely fan!  After waking craving breakfast burrito coming across long ass line Lauritas decided finally check place out    I opted breakfast burrito w chicken egg potatoe cheese chicken while friend opted nachos carne asada  both impressed tasty all food was    and plenty! love aren't cheap meat here    HUGE portions!  The service friendly place really clean  don't think long winded review really necessary  taco shop but really good one! can't wait try more items menu here!

Pricing totally worth HUGE portions freshly cooked meat! always left overs next day  I loveeeeee Don Tortaco general but location especially great  staff sweet catered wants  <EOR> This probably worst Mexican food ever life staff unfriendly tonight nobody eat all wanted chicken taco chicken enchilada enchilada cold Taco crappy service suck Loretta's just down street food terrible never ever back !!!!! <EOR> Not bad  under new management owners  Fresh food head head Laurita's  give more details but open business  <EOR> The only way place could better drive thru! Standard Don Tortaco Robertos food  Greasy cheesy fattening goodness  girl front even remembers usual order  Maybe often    clean fresh yummy friendly cheap  could better? <EOR> This real Mexican food  menu only American people    1 Chimichangas burritos no Mexican  2 Mexican food never eat all sour cream yellow cheddar chease   Place clean personal nice <EOR> This step above Roberto's    IF same  Quality generic flavorless  noticed female staff quite attitudes towards customers   But today finally enough attitude  work next door sometimes  convenience never key  just drive down street actual authentic taco shop where food actually good service  <EOR> Breakfast burrito shrunk  Loved them before perfect size but think tortilla more burrito egg bacon cheese potatoe now  extreme regular    Might done  <EOR> Came late night grub  food decent  ordered carne asada tacos  However staff little rude  didn't care much since didn't dine but lady didn't seem she wanted there  <EOR> I come when great breakfast burritos red sauce nice spicy  favorite all Don tortacos town to <EOR> Food good always but does depend working  day   Erika took order today but making food but personality friendliness amazing     She loves job customers feel welcome when walk through door   Because Erika would back location plus fact specials every day if site through Yelp specials discounts which another plus place   If locations find go   Most open 24 7 location closes midnight  <EOR> Came other day since search NEW favorite Mexican joint since old now sucks place isn't new favorite even close BUT honestly horrible either    The customer service sucks when walk door No smile Just  kinda blank stare off ya your food  No thank come again But tip jar!!  Ha ha  guess guys haven't figured yet need decent customer service skills people want give FREE money nothing      whatever  Anyway    The carne asada scale 1 10 5 6 no flavor  don't marinate meat overnight properly some other places let beef absorb flavor seasonings taste something other chopped leather belt!!    I'm so  Cal almost all Mexican taco shops know marinate flavor  wondering if guys even know remove seasoning bottle add meat beef taste something? thinking maybe think since bought seasoning long its same vicinity food it'll MAGICALLY season itself!?  Ha ha   The salsa bar good though  Lots jalapeños carrots onions good flavor    The red green salsa good flavor tell canned    The tacos mediocre best  just flavorless beef guacamole watered down guacamole pick de gallo  long cover lime juice salsa salt good but nothing close south border guys English isn't great you'd think could better tacos but don't whatever    The breakfast burritos ok fairly priced    The taquitos pretty much just rolled corn tortillas VERY little meat    If you're craving Mexican you're nearby try yourself  restaurant clean  prices ok  But don't special trip other side town you'll disappointed    Still search GREAT Mexican joint but still haven't found but will!!  Also hard taco shells BEYONG hard almost shatter your teeth tearing piece leather break piece off because think The shells fried dats advance <EOR> Usually place order from  Never issue but last night ordered same food every single time    but time wet cali burrito guacamole it! Never does   gross wasted money because trashed guac brown because hot wet sauce top   Disappointed  sure when starving    <EOR> Let start off saying food good  carne asada burrito carne asada fries tacos al pastor torts al pastor all pretty decent  reason gave place 3 stars because feel room improvement  Especially tortas  tortas other places usually come some beans sour cream little bit guacamole  tortas Don Tortaco come only meat which them seem bit plain mention hard eat  When you're trying eat meat falls because their's nothing hold everything together  suggestion cooks add least some beans sour cream help keep meat place  Until improve way tortas ordering again  Besides think meat tastes good service also pretty good  continue but no more tortas me  think stick tacos  <EOR> Went around 1AM whim late night food run   The place dead being manned only 1 person   No worries though server cook cashier quick banged chimichanga no time all   Chimichanga cooked nicely outer layer nice balance being very crispy but oily   Topped guacamole cheese chimichanga really hit spot   Additionally rice served rice prolly best rices Mexican joint   Super impressed quick meal   5 stars horchata tap tho   Neverending horchata???  Come kid come back simply exploit wonder machine spitting cinnamon milky goodness  <EOR> I've location several times  Food always good  However staff never friendly  Even leave generous tip still treated Ike nothing  politely order food politely handover money lady working front counter completely rude  <EOR> One better Mexican places around side town    Location located near starbucks lee's alcohol gas station plaza windmill Maryland   Vibe layout almost ritually breakfast late night snack ALWAYS clean  place small but never really packed   Customer service food Always greeted smile which nice food gets very quickly time  bacon breakfast burrito dankkk 15 10  Super cheesy super eggy super stuffed   Chimichanga Huge point  Carnitas little small times but still taste good  All all never bad experience here   Protip take orders ahead time! <EOR> Great Mexican food cheeper Robertos just good   love Carne Asada fries   the staff always friendy good food   breakfast items great well  <EOR> I attended dance workshop Sunday Rock Center Dance when broke lunch decided walk over Don Tortaco   I've never eaten before close cheap   I ordered 2 cheese enchilada combo   Service polite location clean    The food just meh  cheese tasted funny tortillas didn't really seem done all way   I didn't care rice all     I'm really fan   take Roberto's any day week over Don Tortaco if given chance   wasn't awful but wouldn't first choice  <EOR> Authentic Mexican food  love place but don't ladies work cashier  attitude sucks she doesn't orders correct  charge extra everything  Overall best Vegas  <EOR> So far good!
