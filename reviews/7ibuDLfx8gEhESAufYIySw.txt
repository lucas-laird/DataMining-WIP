Whenever someone says found good AYCE Sushi place  respond good Sushi Mon  answers vary No Close but never better Sushi Mon   <EOR> Based reviews hubby decided pop Sat night   Although packed didn't wait because only two sat sushi bar   My thoughts  the Maryland location small ish you're close quarters everyone   bit fishy smell more other sushi joints  chalked close quarters place   they flexible AYCE option  first weren't sure whether wanted AYCE  Sometimes more sense especially if want try lots different rolls   But gotta ready AYCE i e  some drawstring sweatpants on   As debated chef advised he would tally amount once done charge whatever less whether itemizing rolls AYCE price  Awesome!!!  one best things loved let order half orders most rolls  really great when there's only two people eating  husband different tastes challenging eat multiple rolls myself  But love trying lots different rolls  Ordering half rolls great option us   that being said didn't l o v e rolls  Don't wrong  good but just didn't think *great * Some rolls kinda bland  Maybe just off night went  think willing give try again <EOR> I've coming sushi Mon past 10 years now  Whenever trip Vegas always sure stop by  past 3 years started decline taste quality sushi  Last visit week ago food terrible confused name another person's name waiting list  family wait another extra 35 min initial hour wait  manager extremely impolite hesitant apologize  Sushi Mon same years ago  won't come anymore  time find new AYCE sushi Vegas  <EOR> First foremost no sushi expert especially when comes where Vegas but first meal great again   quality isn't upper crust any means  However all eat sushi menu great variety IMO   made truly favorable sitting bar being cool sushi chef he would just hook omakase style!

Even though table next ordered far more she never asked them if done ordering  Once ordered food took very long time come even though table next ours she clearly favored food shortly placing order    The sushi alright definitely good used be  found presentation sushi sloppy inconsistent  average sushi poor service safe say being very loyal Sushi Mon customer sure if returning  <EOR> Always wait  absolute freshest sushi  Great service spite being very busy  Worth try sure <EOR> Everything place just OK  staff welcoming kind  Attentive most part  Atmosphere clean well sushi just OK  didn't taste bad but wasn't memorable also compared other sushi spots ate  If pick roll liked best would Royal California  Baked Mussels pretty good  really much say more but that  <EOR> I around sushi block say still favorite  wish wait long times service could better but think quality consistency fish incredible  <EOR> First all would recommend place start taking reservations  group lost 2 members due some confusion wait time  told 1 hour really only waited 20 minutes    AYCE sushi should warrant wait as 4 laps around parking lot before allowed sit down sushi prepared fresh   no rolls sitting under fluorescent lights here!

Come people! Its sushi sashimi  Japan piece fish HALF size serve America  course your going rice your fish  If dont rice order more expensive plate sashimi instead    With said extensive amount rolls choose from  price might little high $27 dinner but also stamp cards All Eat  Buy 10 11th free!   So good quality sushi comes price but its well worth it  always busy mean something  <EOR> Everyone argue which AYCE sushi best Sin City but sushi venturing tenure Mon best  Note OPINION sister franchise renowned Goyemon which disappointed terms service  practically no difference other infrastructure  because serve practically same rolls maybe some minor differences   Every visit top service  servers tend lack personalities but needs personality when great service? routinely begin rolls Volcano which take bit longer but Mon takes reasonable 5 minutes max Goyemon which took approximately 20 minutes  Why such discrepancy? No excuse other terrible service   My favorites Volcano sexy girl ecstasy philadelphia hurricane 911 warning very spicy hence name cynthia stacy  All cooked near perfection delight  Fresh avocado fish rice etc   Some tips Order half rolls unless large party  sure you're stuff yourselves but should take advantage diversity rolls AYCE menu  Diversity over quantity  your order subsequently receiving  Start roll then once arrives order your next don't wait long periods time cause sushi does take some meticulous care make  Chew slowly!

Usually favorite places because few chefs servers really friendly close house  recently changed schedule later evening which means longer waits table  Along comes bad service  gets later better chefs off bunch new people friendly good behind bar  also recently changed managers promoted server position which good change  irritates particular waitress usually takes over service sushi bar when she comes she would rather talk coworkers hide back then actually take care customers  loyal customer years food always good but service getting point where am starting look another ayce sushi joint  if want great service place you  <EOR> Ok   place OK   fish good options rolls good but 10 visits say service consistently hit miss just most other local AYCE spots rice overwhelming portions  bad all around though <EOR> Really? 4 5 stars 90 reviews  kidding me?

FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS  <EOR> This place much choices choose from   price bit pricey hour sushi desserts because 3rd dish already stuffed even 15 minutes   choices awesome though warm sake great never wrong kirin beer   food delicious except when tried spicy ahi DANG spicy  <EOR> i wouldn't think all you can eat sushi joint would any good but place surpassed expectations  can't say best sushi but good other dishes well   fried oyster baked mussels sake shots terrific   nigiri rolls devoured   agree price could bit less     they charge unfinished food  <EOR> Average AYCE sushi just another reviewer said  sushi AYCE quality  better worse any other place  probably returning again     but just know mean average AYCE shrimp tempura made anemic shrimp panko but regular batter it's plus uni but minus good quality plus raw shrimp  also plus deep fry head but minus deep fried head very oily bit soggy  perhaps oil hot enough? there's 1hr limit white tuna hamachi decent quality  i've definitely worse but also better  meh  <EOR> Finally tried Sushi Mon recently pretty good  Busy busy but seated right away lucky guess  Lots young people most part some hoochie mamas came wearing those tight slinky dresses no other comment other hec?   both All eat some reason waitress kept asking if would 1 2 orders sure all but declined full rolls  Overall pretty good but kind suspicious when took just few minutes rolls arrive  know whole lot Sushi guys behind counter but could several rolls different ingredients come matter minutes? Pre made? Say ain't so! can't confirm but kind odd all years eating Sushi  Some rolls kind oversized couldn't eat single bite  Spider roll softshelll crab ends but middles seemed unrecognizable oversized  really UNI but seems isn't popular item many places usually it  Sushi Mon but flavor just bit off maybe season? don't know but other Sushi Bars never UNI good should be  Overall good value price  Didn't really roll stood above rest next visit just random ordering since none rolls truly memorable but still good effort we'll back again sure  <EOR> I'm LA family staying down street over South Point  dad found before left vacation decided wanted try it   Originally he going la carte instead AYCE  He definitely does regret choice    Sitting bar better experience opinion because don't need order thru any servers  chefs all Japanese except even though Yoshi chef helped didn't look Japanese he's same city dad from  Yoshi made experience better because he made sure check every once while while still attending other people bar    As other servers some good some weren't  younger ones friendlier better attitudes learned ask them    Food wise everything comes quick even when order items takoyaki baked mussels prepared back  may because sat front chef would hand but even fried items came quick    The rolls mediocre  though order half order instead whole thing avoid getting full allowing try more food  Where LA don't option it s best big group you'll full off 2 orders rolls    My absolute favorite thing place though dessert included AYCE  don't know if it s Nevada thing but dessert always la carte other AYCE sushi places  dessert good  tempura ice cream mochi creme brulee sorbets  lychee sorbet definitely favorite but also tried yuzu sorbet green tea creme brulee    Overall really good experience wish LA place  Thank Yoshi three servers kind  <EOR> I must say food usually good  However service terrible  servers attentive all  bussers obviously aware fact should picking plates etc  throughout persons entire meal instead letting them pile up    Service sushi bar okay  Servers don't seem pay much mind those eating sushi bar   The few times ate received same horrible service  sad   Management should meeting staff regards service should be   Think tried last time always disappointing     <EOR> Finally AYCE sushi spot variety fresh sushi great service whole menu included  bit drive strip but worth trip especially sweet shrimp Toro salmon belly sushi   The best part only $26  serve its totally worth it  You'll spend inside hotel casino cafe easily  <EOR> MMmmmmMMMMmmm!!

I've often found any restaurant big small produce full house wait doing something right   Sushimon doesn't offer fine dining service  going blow away superior service   I don't know guys but really don't think matters   If you're getting AYCE Sushi already idea kind sushi want your preference is   All server's seen Sushimon good getting food keeping drinks full   You could some dirty place middle bad neighborhood Sushi $4 5 cheaper sure   But Sushimon offers almost entire menu AYCE All you can eat Dessert well    I know lot places mark off menu items only offer dessert   Things LOVE Sushimon  Nigiri Hamachi Yellowtail Salmon Super White Tuna Unagi  Other offerings Hamachi Collar most places don't offer sometimes run but if order it!

As majority sushi itself nothing all great  tried number different items found most them bit bland  Also all seemed variations same thing and good thing that   Presentation bit lacking well nearly every dish looked rushed fell apart while trying eat it  item which variation dynamite roll ordered looked skimped toppings then when eat thing turned mush before could take bite  Most food fell apart didn't seem cooked right something just wasn't right  Really let down evening    All all OK experience plain sushi yummy enjoyed small number rolls but bulk just would consider quality sushi  busy such good rating mystery me  But huge selection if willing brave some more interesting rolls then give least try might find more your tastes own  <EOR> I use visit weekly    Average Sushi poor service inconsistent quality    Do recommend visiting weekends  Wait time worth it  <EOR> Lots choices sushi fresh   nothing conveyor belt type   Service fast once your seated but if arriving during peak dinner hours expect wait dining area isn't huge space   Definitely would come back again if visiting Vegas   Beware   the 911 roll hella hot  <EOR> What's that?

Especially server JEFFREY  <EOR> I used satisfy Niku Udon cravings Shuseki but yesterday being desperate food decided give Sushi Mon another try last encounter did AYCE found hair food lol I know last time curry dish wasn't large portion Bun tummy ache dinner specials stayed away some time but yesterday being 1am wanted actual food   The Niku Udon sufficed hoping portion just alright  broth wasn't bad but over time leave funny taste  $9 95 meal before tax tip   I'll keep place mind when need food wouldn't drive far less 5 minute drive where live    which means definitely walk lol <EOR> Went place coz could table fav sushi place Fri night  love sushi having sushi all around vegas consider worst vegas   I firmly believe eat eyes first  if looks appetizing feel good  starters stuffed rice  Size few rolls big  kept bouncing off mouth  Very unprofessional staff  Smile dammit!!! when food ordered  Staff should friendly even when don't want to  U running restaurant  hire such people guest feel invited  gets worse now sitting bar some dude kept washing cleaning floor every 3 mins  felt sick seeing guy mop floor while having food  entire duration there  Very disorganized  No system track ordered what  sitting bar chef could remember order multiple times  given 3 4 rolls wasn't mine  chance peek back  floor covered some white power looked flour  Flour Sushi Bar????? May think cleaning kitchen floor once while rather cleaning bar every 3 mins  Slightly overpriced but don't mind shelling few extra bucks since love sushi much  But place just Blows!!!  Bottom Line back place only dreams nightmares  would rate 0 5 but yelp wudnt let My recommendation Yama Sushi Maryland Pkwy Flamingo   place best Vegas  100 bucks keep coming back place more  If digg sashimi definitely try Seafood Salad   Its world  Yummy   <EOR> Love food!  Love crew!!! Hate wait <EOR> This place decent service say because kind forgot order end then didn't bring dessert son when he done eating but him   She said she thought she wait until all dessert   service perfect other those two things   They blue fin tuna which good alone gave them 5 hen favorite scallop spider hand rolls   ordered all kinds sushi look photos delicious can't wrong anything here   The ice cream Mochi ice cream yummy yum yum!!  We back! <EOR> Well wouldn't know would taste because long waited   The man front told going 40 minute wait definitely willing wait but once clock hour 15 minutes into waiting time decided ridiculous left  Many workers came front didn't even acknowledge us  thought all good reviews would've offered glass water least sorry wait  shame people rude sure food would've great but unfortunately won't coming back due long wait time rude people  <EOR> Sushi Mon solid place AYCE sushi but creative new venture  Although some rolls same Goyemon Sushi Mon does awesome appetizers desserts other restaurant does    The quality fish same service better but variety lacking  If ignore minor complaints difficulty picking nigiri major problem night  ones sauce splashed top fell apart easily  Instead drizzling lightly fish put directly rice which caused loosen contact    The rolls nothing particularly special nigiri definitely way go  nice large pieces fish placed proportionate piece rice perfection    I didn't know use same stamp card Goyemon if your waitress ask if card give them card  looked she gave asked if could just Goyemon stamped but combine  prepared just add your preexisting one  <EOR> This fair mine hubby's favorite sushi spot  huge selection specialty rolls which fun try different things  love rolls cream cheese! But nigiri light yummy  don't know sauce put but delicious  would never AYCI  $26 95 dinner eat triple amount worth it! Even if super full end try mochi balls  Strawberry flavor best  always come back no matter because food bomb  Sometimes gets little busy servers distracted all over place BUT always very friendly understanding  Can't wait come stuff myself again  <EOR> I still consider myself sushi noob but AYCE Sushimon pro no time! Half rolls try new ones chef specials awesome names very tasty fish dessert yum tempura ice cream woohoo!   cooked sides kinda blah but might because mesmerized sushi feast  Order don't over order pay extra don't eat  They're open super late like 2am believe if crave your sushi midnight place your fix  <EOR> The fish fresh however wait staff worst    ask water three different people two then twice    all eat ordered Tempura Shrimp waited twenty minutes asked wait staff four times said would check slammed business   27 minutes  never shrimp paid bill left      Owen boss didn't seemed care!   back   many other sushi places try     failed me! <EOR> Probably best AYCE sushi joints town  come quite regularly when taste sushi  soon sit down drink order front me  sushi always fresh never stale slimy  Service wait staff very prompt  Sushi chefs very good craft say least   If come 5pm prepare wait seat  place always jammed people  Several times simply could in  <EOR> There many AYCE sushi places Vegas quite few them VERY good   Sushi Mon might pretty spacious friendly some other spots around town but definitely come through food   Especially specials   other night amazing sashimi salad AYCE specials board   Striped Jack tasty definitely something find most AYCE places around town   salmon belly yellowtail belly specials board too   AYCE Salmon Belly?  yummy!!!  nigiri all fresh flavorful   really don't heavy sauces mask fish flavors    Another favorite Salmon Collar   lot places around town over cook collar   Sushi Mon's always moist lightly charred absolutely delicious!

Sushi Mon's AYCE price $26 95 great quality nigiri sushi fun diversity daily specials but still wish more selection appetizers rolls! <EOR> Recently moved area browsing find new sushi spot fianc  came week ago seated right away  Its small location but works  Unfortunately wont returning only roll actually stood amazing flavor everything else mild zero flavor  Granted its sushi but some places tend bring flavor  fried rolls weren't liking all color seemed if oil may old being both felt very sick end evening into following days im certain was  Service okay clean location  next sushi place  <EOR> This restaurant staple sushi lovers including myself long time  coming AYCE only can't speak much regular menu  But say AYCE always solid consistent which why seems always busy which why your service may take hit  prepared wait seated small restaurant during peak hours occasionally wait your server sushi chef during your meal because tied up   They extended hours late night cravings  novice sushi eaters plenty pictures menu aid you  If you're sitting bar chefs more willing answer any questions fill any requests  Keep your eye chalkboard any specials also   This last visit sat sushi bar just opening Saturday solid meal appetizers nigiri  chef busy but made sure meal flowing smoothly  didn't any rolls all 30 pieces nigiri delicious enough satisfy me  two clam specials Asari rayu orange clam I took pictures both but pretty crappy didn't post them which both oil sauce respectively elevated clam which something normally don't order   Sushi Mon head shoulders above rest they're location convenient me  am still fan though continue frequent but most likely only late night if happen driving area wait looks reasonable  <EOR> Absolutely love place all eat sushi bomb!

'My response only if AYCE cheap  Sushi Mon meets both criteria  But best part fresh delicious! Some buffet style sushi taste cheap but Sushi Mon  magical experience left hoot bill  Pro Tip #1 Don't drink carbonated beverages  Straight water bang your buck   Pro Tip #2 Order Chubby Volcano rolls  Amazing  <EOR> I used love sushimon but incident happened other night never ever back  husband decided wanted some sushi around 930 Friday night  hostess tells there's 45 min wait although large table  open reservation   decide alright let's just take go  order few sashimi screaming orgasm 4 rolls which came 80 bucks! seriously contemplate just waiting 45 min having all eat $50 plus tip two us    15 20 min later pack stuff drive home  home give roll  wrong order then they're missing 2  give them call say food counter   we don't live minute down street husband asks manager if he just refund two rolls cost  offer give 26 dollar credit next time + another $13 refund  husband insisted wanted refund made drive back instead just putting back card  he gets refund   and would think trouble would just give two rolls originally ordered but forgot  Nope  horrible customer service  Even though sushi fine closest sushi restaurant place won't ever back  Ugh! <EOR> I'm little disappointed Sushi Mon tonight  boyfriend ordered takeout again usual but time also chicken teriyaki  couldn't wait home since starving   We ate sushi first good always  Next came chicken teriyaki    everything fine until last piece chicken  bone bit down hard felt pain tooth  immediately spit ran bathroom mirror  didn't see any damage but still feel slight pain    I just hope more careful future  continue take but think just stick sushi rolls   I would given them four stars but deducted star chicken bone  <EOR> What say    Other than   prepared leave self inflicted Sushi wasabi Coma    $28 all eat buffet Made order pre made sushi sitting tray bed ice  legit order roll eat  also order sides teriyaki chicken other normal items  am sushi lover say bring on   roll ill eat it     word Roll seems coming alot review maybe because when your done eating exaclty doing      Rolling door  Thumbs Shushi mon  prepared wait building holds 60 people fills nightly  <EOR> Best place come Vegas all eat!! love coming staff amazing ! <EOR> Sushi Mon definitely lives its hype  couple friends recommended place must stop Vegas  reassured place soon heard Japanese coming chefs   Can't more authentic right?   We came right opening 11 45am even skipped breakfast sure plenty room raw fish  only couple others waiting anxiously them open up  option sitting bar table latter accommodate group 4  server came immediately drinks started  decided AYCE sushi  can't wrong paying 21 95 good quality fish   decided start off salmon belly which melt in your mouth good   would highly recommend getting belly if see special menu  ran just 10 minutes   Everything else delicious fresh!  Restaurant filled quickly but wasn't much wait until left restaurant around 1  also worried 45 minute time limit posted everywhere  anyone eat 45 minutes when wait your food every time put order in? But luckily rule enforced   noticed plenty people ordering lunch menu    something I'd consider if local  But since take advantage all eat menu     Another huge plus restaurant insane 2 am closing time  don't think I'd crave raw fish past midnight but Vegas never sleeps right? another location closer strip Sahara  accidentally came location because came Yelp search  But local friend said other location original restaurant more crowded   I'd check other next trip   highly recommend place! Friendly staff + reasonable price + great food = happy returning customer! <EOR> Very good sushi quite variety choose from  usually order nigiri including ikura salmon roe if ikura isn't fresh disgusting  Theirs always fresh fish  They've never made mistake carryout orders place always hopping evenings crowded inside wait your order table   People wait tables chairs outside building   If you're Vegas heat doesn't feel bad but tourists probably think hot wait outside  <EOR> For once chose sit sushi bar rather table since seemed main highlight restaurant sit bar bar took most space   Skeptic sit bar due unpleasant first experience Hikari surprised find sushi chefs AYCE places attentively listen figure when you're ready order again orders quick pace  Thumbs sushi chefs  cuts clean thick perhaps even overpowering compared rice    Sushi Mon's menu actually quite large comparison other AYCE places specifically specials menu  pleasantly surprised find Takoyaki Appetizers section something don't usually see nowadays  also AYCE Salmon Belly which screaming inside pure joy! Bless! also customize your sushi when talk chef  appreciated fact he let rice less tamago  aren't many places you  some nigiri such scallops even added yum yum sauce just heck it  know try new things    I would love give place 5 stars deserve but sushi joint major downfall    The waiters    Super inattentive  seems whenever need something them water appetizers dessert BILL they're just never there  literally hawk eyes around restaurant first available waiter tell order before he back hiding kitchen  Several male waiters just kept walking kitchen ignoring customers needed assistance even raised voice kept saying excuse me! However seems friends visited evening needs met whenever ask  literally waiter right next just kept ignoring requests attention friend happened sitting right next group bar  Thanks service  guess    Despite hiccups restaurant's waiters food still solid enough come back  finish checklist other AYCE sushi restaurants  <EOR> This place favorite brother filled AYCE cards couple times  Eat ten times free! love lemon roll Sexy girl ecstasy hurricane rolls  dragon roll also good super white tuna die buttery smooth  <EOR> Been eating hear since '04    Used mad all u can eat they'd mad if your baby ate tell u no    Well kids 8 now usually take anyway   Only problem once fixed    Now big deal   Nice staff good prices good sushi  Spouse Japanese sushi mon gets approval good sushi!

Especially because 2 seater opened them needed both tables  hostess refused put both tables together rudely told we'd wait 15 minutes longer till more tables open 4 separate parties leave first =8 seats still  WTH? When done those two tables still unused  Dumb! If wasn't your waitress' making way would've lost Tip let alone business lastnight!
