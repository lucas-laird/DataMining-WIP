This Del Taco only 5 minutes where live  why here  food okay opinion nothing special more 'Americanized' Mexican food  Tables dirty well bathrooms  Staff considerate surprisingly customers deal daily basis  <EOR> I love location near home always great service ! vegan often picky complicated orders  workers always courteous provide excellent customer service  When allow myself splurge fries always want then we'll done crispy  only location gets right first time around   The drive through also fast accurate here    I enjoy 8 layer veggie burrito without cheese sour cream  currently 2 5$  wife enjoys fish shrimp tacos now available   Try 1$ strawberry lemonade real strawberries delicious  <EOR> I eat somewhat often since close workplace  food Del Taco offers  However particular location probably isn't best  visit tried order shake no shake machine down  Ok wasn't most polite response  Then once paid asked if I'd any hot sauce said mild don't mild  Lol visit soured opinion location  <EOR> It's Del Taco   enough said!  I typically pick large quantities tacos whenever need stop job site guys eat  Plus look really nice when buy lunch everyone! typically jerk lol jk  I mostly choose place because cheap! <EOR> Grabbed lunch off base gave wrong order wrong change! Coincidentally parked parking lot checking voice mail brought correct order  Would happy if  without fish tacos  Cashier bit frazzled but friendly service but neighborhood sketchy! <EOR> So why 3 stars? Well ordered Epic Chicken Chipotle Burrito Epic Carne Asada Burrito  think expected Moe's Qdoba quality price  more upscale Taco Bell but good Moe's Qdoba  burritos decent but just seemed lacking flavor   On positive note churros excellent! if anything recommend warm cinnamon sugar goodness churros bring  <EOR> Just worst Del Taco ever   Unfortunately Del Taco directly across street housing complex  Moving thought hurray  when want greasy tacos morose feeling comes eating fast food here!  I'm being facetious kind but actually enjoyed Del Taco past  tacos aren't terrible usually quite cheap  Quesadillas usually lots cheese spicy chicken burrito fave indulgences   BUT husband came week night sat drive thru FOREVER  top horrendous wait sub par food even fast food standards   chicken burrito half filled barely warm  asked crunchy taco place soft taco combo meal gave nothing! Yes nothing  just didn't bother give crunchy taco asked for   Very bad experience here  Oh but give GOOD military discount  <EOR>
