He then demanded angrily show order confirmation which did which somehow annoyed more   then found order prepared it  back hotel super disappointed sushi  Fish did taste fresh all all rolls overpowered imitation crab  did end finishing food because disliked much  Only reason giving two stars instead because did food poisoning kudos that! <EOR> First all place great food quality  family enjoyed food lot  But horrible service  When came around 6 30 told going take hour 40 minutes  But when mom asked again around 6 50 told only going take 20 30 minutes  dinner time all hungry  mom just look waiting list see when turn waitress front mom gave mom unpleasant look started talking waiter next saying lady won't just sit down she keeps wandering front mom some annoying person just randomly annoying her  First all mother just lady   She your customer despite fact restaurant isn't just straight rude giving someone don't know all nasty look talking them? just mad shocked treated mother    It just mom brother eat  eating see hear two eyes ears servers asking around food?  going far? yet all guys done eating? wanted kick bring new customers  know  Dinner time very busy lot minds but treating weren't going pay just take off staying hours which none true  Those services just started think because see mother single mom something? because just two weak women some 7 years old kid    Eating dinner outside your family means having meaningful time outside your family spending money  am sure mom did deserve kind service but terrible just furious  <EOR> We wanted all eat sushi 3 00 p m  only place open Saturday afternoon  took taxi hotel best food all weekend  Off strip but well worth trouble  Highly recommend  <EOR> My sister crave sushi every week normal spots Goyemon Sushi Mon Maryland parkway depending where are  friend mine recommended place checked out  sister said she liked better regular spots  Prices similar eat more nigiri anything  fresh rice proportion good  atmosphere nice more restaurant feel bc bigger space nice dim lighting  Service awesome but between lunch dinner time busy  appetizers better most ayce sushi places rolls decent  crab meat lot rolls which fan choices weren't great but couple rolls really enjoyed!

The sushi value worst ever seen sushi eating career   The sashimi probably half thickness should thin seem transparent  Hamachi lover roll super tiny   The only good thing probably agedashi tofu which decent quality   I never all eat but don't think back anything  <EOR> I come celebrations because accommodate large parties  Why isn't place more popular? pretty inside sushi bad  only complaint pack rice balls tight nigiri  think look less rice but I'd rather them because much harder chew each piece    The appetizers non sushi items great here  favorite crispy rice spicy tuna! good  Another favorite rib eye steak  Medium rare way go  served thin slice wooden platter some dipping sauce side    Service great here  party 17 prepared took orders table  pretty organized  able split bill couple times convenience  staff very friendly welcoming  No complaints customer service! <EOR> Just tried place last night  Sushi really good but menu pretty simple is  lot rolls renditions previous roll just addition removal ingredient   BUT if asked them change roll more interesting did without hesitation  AYCE pricing same everywhere else town wasn't surprised all price  environment really nice open doesn't feel crowded busy many other sushi restaurants definite plus  staff POINT tended all needs we're very helpful  couldn't even finish glass water before waitress came around fill again haha   definitely return place  <EOR> Solid AYCE All Eat sushi restaurant  Two shared spicy tuna roll tempura roll salmon nigiri orange blossom roll  Also ordered seaweed salad edamame miso ramen  Finished off red bean ice cream  Fast attentive service  Portions reasonable balanced decent sized pieces sushi weren't overwhelmed gigantic portions rice     Best sushi ever had?

Overall most food grea <EOR> When saw 4 5 rated AYCE sushi restaurant right across street hotel Palms knew family go   On weekends open 12 parents made 12 10  Good thing came early because place gets PACKED! 12 10 half room already full more people flooding in  only 2 servers during opening which made service really slow first however once more servers started shift more consistent  thing keep mind all servers work together you're just assigned one  totally kept trying attention first person took drink orders before eventually realizing every server attends every table  Wooooopsss!! Don't mistake y'all you'll save yourself lot frustration lmao   $21 all eat sushi yes plz  parents ordered assortment items both sushi bar kitchen  some items only let each person order but majority stuff free all  Although pieces weren't super fat honestly impressed quality nigiri point slice size didn't bother especially since could just order more  salmon sake extremely fatty which made all more delicious! DEFINITELY skip seared albacore though  dish very disappointed in  Other things would recommend getting include poke!! tuna chunks really thick seasoned very well  also really liked grilled mackerel grilled squid kitchen  Polished off palettes some yummy green tea ice cream too   Overall really Umiya  Except seared albacore everything fresh! Meats weren't impressive we rib eye pork belly but always nice option if you're craving little bite meat  tons AYCE sushi options Vegas but definitely feel Umiya best hands down  only major comment would but feel should least more server per lunch dinner rush though  servers constantly running around feel bad them!!

Why not? told would stand when 1st customer arrives but he said Korean accent no   Japanese food only taste but top notch service it  Avoid place if want authentic Japanese food     I could only imagine sushi low grade cats wouldn't eat  <EOR> Down side     wait time larger party     called but told no     waited over 30 min when told going 15 min     3 smaller parties behind before group   Food good     OK choices     good service <EOR> Excellent sushi bar  Fresh fish frendly great employees  highly recommend place  <EOR> This place terrible managerial service  know accommodate guests first come first serve basis  called put names wait list 9 00pm quoted 20 30 minute wait time but did seated until 9 55pm  seated guests came simply because benefited them more more revenue rather doing right thing  place does care doing right thing  Instead trying arrange seating your favor just bigger place  last time come place  <EOR> An average AYCE all eat sushi restaurant but fear won't returning any time soon  price AYCE dinner competitive $25 95 but just weren't satisfied appetizer selection quality nigiri    My boyfriend enjoy eating fresh fish nigiri trying few appetizers when dine AYCE sushi restaurants unfortunately nigiri appetizers shine  fish rice ratio inconsistent  sushi rice undercooked compacted under paper thin slivers raw fish  couple nigiri stomach felt dense full   good feeling good value    There few fish tried extremely enjoyable sweet such albacore salmon but paper thin sliver made difficult really enjoy quality fish  actually sent back salmon belly because offensively fishy old     I also felt very limited appetizer selection some items sized large feel comfortable ordering others just desirable    Here some appetizers enjoyable Miso Soup Baked Mussels Tuna poke    that's it?  Pass Jalapeño popper super dense crazy filling ok flavor Fried soft shell crab all soggy batter Most nigiri     I suggest going Sakana on Maryland fresh fatty cuts fish nigiri generous fish rice ratio big flavorful selection appetizers also creative juicy rolls  <EOR> I'm love!!

Plenty parking plaza but few street lights looks kind sketchy outside  But never judged book its cover because insides atmosphere sort club! Good music dim lighting! felt super rushed eating because felt all servers running around  Food came quickly dirty plates taken away promptly    I appetizer options offered lot things wouldn't normally see other sushi restaurants least none ones to! friends gobbled plate shishito peppers limit order per person plate quite few peppers them  did try them but friends said they're good taste bell peppers   THE GOOD oysters limit order per person   Quite meaty clean! didn't mouthful sand bits sand mouth eating it  all surprised big oysters were  baby octopus skewers  literally give tiny one soft shell crab  surprised good was! literally eat entire thing without having spit anything out  wanted order more since limit per person think but saving room rolls    THE EHH chicken skewers look nothing picture menu  hardly any vegetables skewer  Maybe piece onion bell pepper separate chicken pieces  Ginkgo lot Heath benefits came bowl 10 so  Tasted sort boiled peanuts bacon scallops  gave 2 pieces bacon crispy overdone    I'D SKIP mussels overcooked bit chewy IMO  yuzu ceviche limit per person would order again  fish pieces tasted really off kind mushy  ribeye very small  4 small slices over cooked    You can't wrong any rolls but nigiri way much rice  used 1 3 rice nigiri but quality fish wasn't bad  favorite eel salmon belly    Their dessert options kind limited  offer tempura ice cream green tea vanilla which single scoop ice cream  very big would recommend sharing! also offer different mochi ice cream flavors including red bean green tea strawberry others  ice cream scoops well    If rice ratio big deal then wouldn't recommend coming here  But upside offer variety appetizers food comes super quick!

Sushi Nigri excellent sweet shrimp included oysters sea urchin fresh sushi soft shell crab shrimp tempura   The only negative rolls very average  strength nigiri sashimi soft shell crab  <EOR> This place used called Kaizen didn't AYCE sushi   But Friday night wife looking AYCE sushi spot saw place everywhere else crazy 1 1 5 hr wait   decided try place out   immediately took because atmosphere spacious   wasn't crowded nor place most sushi spots where small compact there's barely any room walk on    The staff very friendly warm   menu very extensive! actually 4 whole pages food including huge amount foods aren't seafood ish   know many people would say why sushi spot eat seafood sushi? Well some people something called allergies don't want them excluded especially since brother allergic shellfish nephew allergic freshwater fish   really awesome plenty great choices those cannot enjoy certain aspect sushi eating   Including steak teriyaki noodles beef pork chicken dishes     My favorite Snow White Ono nigiri   But  Tuna sashimi w AJ sauce die for   wife loves oysters she said uni very fresh   food just all around very good fresh well prepared   We loved place much back family next evening   would definitely going back again! <EOR> We around 5pm no wait seated right away restaurant very clean dark lighting   All servers workers greeted coming in  whole service experience excellent ! wasn't other AYCE places where wait long time between every order   The server came check very often sushi rolls served just few minutes every time ordered    The nigiri rolls sliced thinner other places but fish definitely very fresh   lot rice either!  special rolls very delicious too!    Not many appetizer choices though     overall best AYCE sushi places been! <EOR> I came brother son niece last week some time  brother different preferences places sushi  He named Oyshi  picked place because higher rating  course he likes opposite he thinks Oyshi better doesn't believe ratings lol  personally love Sushi Hero ratings reflect it  started Yama Flamingo then Sakana  Anyway let's talk Umiya    I tend more kitchen stuff now rather rolls love kitchen food here  always need fresh oysters shrimp tempura seafood salad some sort baked mussels Tako  place Fish Katsu o_O OMG heaven just  menu even higher place heaven taste  Sashimi AYCE delicious well  bad only 1 order per person   Now negatives    1 They seem focus much making sure only ordered 1 order per person once when brother ordered 2 sashimi orders for daughter order she said already two orders  said 4 people   when brother ordered fresh oysters because he doesn't he worried would see eat it  hope don't trip because paid 4 AYCE no matter eats 1 order per person stuff 4 orders  don't trip little things price we're paying   2  know little busy but if you're gonna put time limit should sure you're  fully staffed enough people orders in  point time neither 4 any food eat LOL  First world problems know  but still   Time money   All all I'd again  I'd probably just sit table next time since really just sitting bar if order directly chef  don't really here  Okay bye  <EOR> Third time presentation service awesome!!!Our server very attentive food great! Love rib eye steak  Uni fresh also oyster!! If check free drink!!! need come back more often <EOR> From just combination underwhelming service mediocre sushi feel place deserves 3 stars   The moment sister entered restaurant quite busy none servers greeted us  only half hearted greeting sushi chef  Then waited around 5 minutes server seated but stood front counter awkwardly because server busy dealing checks talking walkie  For ayce didn't even look menu 1 minute before same server came back  He honestly seemed bothered presence all other servers kept eyeballing table first  ?? Throughout dinner didn't come check really see doing but more pick empty plates  rushed order more rushed finish fast  enjoyable    When ordering rolls came very quick nice server good refilling water   On food    only ones stuck Your Daddy appetizer First Kiss roll  other rolls tasted similar quite lacking eel sauce those ordered eel sauce  But then halfway through dinner sister noticed hair soft shell crab roll     uhh know damn well mine nor because hair pretty long while significantly short   Such inane experience won't give place another chance  <EOR> Wow disappointed place! $24ish mediocre food  Why does place 4 5 stars? inaccurate  quality sashimi good all  last meal Las Vegas regretted going crazy  sushi good  would rather pay full price good sushi bad AYCE sushi place  Also charge hot tea? kind asian restaurant charges tea many other places eat Vegas HERE  Waste your time stomach space  Also stomach felt kind uncomfortable afterwards   say liked sweet potato tempura though   UPDATE I food poisoning place  HERE  basically stomach flu symptoms dry heaving crazy  Beware fresh food <EOR> THIS FAVORITE SUSHI PLACE LAS VEGAS  tried almost all AYCE sushi places Vegas NOTHING beats place  don't even anything else say except fact am left speechless and pregnant food baby every meal here  <EOR> Been spot twice left both times wanting more! actual inside te restaurant huge!

Food came fast service good! <EOR> Our table 9 was      disappointed    So checked 7 17p didn't table until 8 8 10p   See  usually problem since understand we're large party arriving dinner time yes expected wait quite while  But 40 minutes decided sit inside restaurant  noticed hostesses absolutely no idea seating planning  entire table could comfortably sit 10 12 people occupied couple  couple  actually sat couple down table could easily fit ours    Moving on  ordered ordering already pain since seems there's certain people only available take orders seem disappear soon hold menu your hand   throughout night food kept coming spurts  4 dishes would come out  Then 15 minutes nothing would come  ordered nigiri 20 minutes accepted wasn't put in  ordered same thing again explained situation waitress  another 20 minutes still didn't come  Towards very end meal all nigiri came  really?   Annoyed sister's fiancé actually asked waitress if some sort system list cross off food delivered table  She actually said no  Which explains unpredictable timing food delay food just     chaos    The food itself alright  sister literally broke hives eating Umiya  drive find open pharmacy intense they all seem close 11p house   all parents child breaking hives BENADRYL  works faster! Today sister's doctor said food might fresh oil clean    Our waitress saw 2 little rice pieces rice nigiri she immediately prompted speech left over rice extra charge  Wouldn't better idea prompt towards END meal? Because dad planned eating sushi rice soft shell crab      I understand big party  always loved coming Umiya  But quality service going downhill steadily  hasn't actually affected until now  <EOR> One more solid AYCE sushi restaurants close Vegas strip  block away Palms Hotel Casino    Their spicy edamame best town!

Probably favorite part place but limits time order per diner  Bummer really   The service really stood me  staff didn't mind busy heavily focused attending every need  Water refills clearing empty plates off table letting server know wanted order more teamwork earned high tip since working AYCE restaurant seem annoying   The best part? Food literally come minute order  sure if good bad thing but definitely good since hungry  If ever time restraint come back  If looking quality vs  quantity won't  place its perks though  <EOR> The best all eat sushi town  2 hours $25  fish fresh chefs creative  ambience laid back  place its price quality  spot Vegas  <EOR> We came group 9  few maybe 2 spoon fulls left overs when done eating all eat sushi  3 people 2 bites salad  bite rice left  person spoon full soup bottom bowl  When done server came over told if didn't finish those last bites food would charge extra whole table  Really? if didn't food? would still eat it? Then server didn't know ring bill tried charging extra anyway  wouldn't recommend place anyone! prison camp where constantly watching eat checking plates take each away! good way keep customers coming back  Oh put extra rice every sushi roll full faster    <EOR> UMIYA ROCKS!!!!!!

Sushi eh  Another place packs rolls 87% rice   Sushi almost tasteless  wouldn't able rave anything other fried ice cream <EOR> Best service hands down! ate almost every mainstream sushi spot vegas normally they're kinda rude  place incredible  employees literally run everywhere  Your drink stays topped off every server helps regardless your waiter is  sushi your table before even remember you've ordered  place rocks! <EOR> Was LV recently business did visit buffet Bacchanal Wicked spoon etc first time ever  visited place Carson Kitchen based Yelp reviews    I ended eating back back nights once colleagues once all lonesome    I'm giving coveted 5 star rating because Service 5 stars + spectacular Best service sushi restaurant EVER   Menu 5 stars Lots options rolls nigiri AYCE   Taste 4 25 stars very good spectacular but service price only $25 AYCE Ambiance 5 stars Super cool chill venue sports friendly waiters  <EOR> Found place recommendations friends  couple times loved it  customer service point food taste great! Worth try! <EOR> There's many AYCE town gotta standout noticed  few things going them off bat right strip off Flamingo strip mall Palms casino easy industry folks tourist hit nicely decorated open late until 2am daily menu selection large offering unique items other spots terms appetizers  Probably good place take folks aren't sushi people when want eat sushi yet try still meet them halfway    Appetizers  Screaming O Salad seared salmon or tuna your choice spicy ponzu mayo shredded daikon mixed greens decent but think prefer without greens which most places it  Oysters briny varietal probably SoCal waters fan  Tuna sashimi w AJ sauce good but only 2pcs  Grilled Yellowtail collar awesome! favorite things but most places only order whereas isn't order limit here!  Soft Shell Crab another favorite theirs lightly battered but crisp tiny bit Japanese mustard sauce top   Bacon wrapped scallop skewer reminds bacon wrapped dates sauce similar sweet flavor  spicy rice cake skewer crisp outside chewy inside way prefer dokbokki Crispy rice spicy tuna large compared other places came 4 order!  Pork belly pretty good base  thin slices grilled KBBQ roasted big hunk then sliced   Nigiri  There daily specials ask server look small glowing board left wall sushi bar  specials today sea bream which fresh really good spanish mackerel which decent though thought maybe sauce slightly sweet giant clam which crunchy surprising way thin slice nori it  Super white pretty fresh here!  Seared Salmon more peppered style fresh torch some bars do  liked enjoyed flavor pepper ponzu sauce   Peppered Albacore good but thought seared salmon better  Yellowtail just OK different flavor it  Don't know describe just different BF didn't it   Tuna acceptable level freshness but nothing outstanding   Masago good but don't know when masago ever bad   Uni pretty fresh sweet pleased  Mackerel salty nor vinegary brine wonder if cured all? fresh though but accustomed to    Sushi  Snow White BFs favorite roll elsewhere think better made here  spicy diced soft shell crab avocado topped super white tuna  torched then Japanese mustard sauce   Salmon Skin Hand Roll wasn't crispy enough wasn't pleasing few bites chewy skin bits    Rice fish ratio very good more fish rice sure  No roll half orders except per person here  always stuff uni specials per person well    Dessert included  mochi tempura green ice cream   Service  The service very nice  male server checked super friendly explaining everything  also female server took initial orders also often brought plates  sushi bar also friendly asked if everything tasting right experience end meal  evident care customer which hugely appreciated me    I don't think stamp card least non offered us   Overall solid inaugural visit  think lot good things going sure back  don't think tops favorite spot but think good put into rotation  <EOR> I've eaten many sushi places umiya just favorites  just wasn't good wasn't appetizing whatsoever!

The hostess waiter entire crew friendly super attentative   3 4 members constantly swarm table taking empty plates away immediately replacing them more deliciousness    much try all came perfect   felt little guilty wife constantly ordering requesting stuff but crew quick courteous  now favorite AYCE sushi joint!!  Even beating all other favorites OC CA    Nice job guys! <EOR> Sushi rolls old bland   Nigiri ok  dont know people rated place high  waiters nice fast order tho  <EOR> Food amazing!

Kitchen food sashimi options yum yum yum!! Uni oyster part dinner deal too  <EOR> In city sushi bars galore finding good tough  past two favorites  which whose name can't even remember Lakes area closed many years ago  other Kobe since moved far away justify making hike AYCE lunch  all know could end being dinner time where currently live    So hunt began find new sushi joint  heard many sing praises Yama  wasn't impressed  Sushi Mon? Overrated  Ra Sushi? Decent rolls obnoxiously clubby trendy atmosphere coupled high prices lack AYCE  learned many no name joints where main sign literally just says sushi reason  Sushi 21 main go to while pretty decent but  it  Nothing mind blowing  Eager sushi but wanting something mind blowing led try place   Yes  place pretty mind blowing indeed  actually blows prior two faves water   Located strip mall appears slowly becoming Little Tokyo due all Japanese related businesses popping space fairly large but still maintains degree intimacy  music noticeable but noticeable  servers attentive friendly    As menu? Probably most extensive AYCE menu ever seen  starters no pun intended list appetizers long takes whole page  never seen before  There's also some very creative rolls indeed  chicken katsu roll? Again Mind  Blown   Everything came quite fast pork belly being sizzling hot right balance tough tender  chicken katsu being tiny most satisfying way possible  eel sauce off chain  lobster roll bit messy but  easily forgiven  mean chunk lobster meat all    The Final Verdict Pros Great ambiance dining setting  Large AYCE menu decent price 20 95 Lunch Copious amounts appetizers AYCE menu  Fresh flavorful creative rolls   Cons Messy lobster roll    but minor   Yum yum sauce japanese style mayo seemed everywhere   Suggestions Lay off Japanese mayo please   Return Factor 10 10  Already planning it  <EOR> BAD SERVICE  called ahead see waiting time like  Woman quick snappy hung before could ask another question  boyfriend anyways takes while seated  bad expected much    We waters lay down first round orders  okay but service slowed down  feeling little sick soon might've because quality food    We'd constantly overlooked ignored middle restaurant! I'd watch other tables serviced except us  Service just bad  let people wait front when clearly tables empty ready go  say AYCE only last 90 minutes but can't help long stay when no takes orders!   This second time eating service still just poor first time few months ago   Bathrooms dirty well  Food good most part just bad service  <EOR> So back Umiya more time bad experience last time  mostly back because favorite waitress Jeanie always provides best service knows order before go   going stop coming issues but literally stayed now because Jeanie relationship built her  She feel home    I told issue last time being able favorite roll gotten past year  She very surprised chefs made two them spot  Hopefully bad experience last time just new waitress bad mood some kind confusion although dont see could confusion Hopefully dont run into another weird situation  <EOR> Stumbled upon place since two hour wait Kaya needed eat ASAP! Definitely RECOMMEND place beginners advanced sushi lovers! <EOR> This excellent meal   3 part actually ate 18 rolls   All rolls great exception Hawaiian roll   sure wrong but bad really bad   Restaurant super busy however service excellent really didn't wait long any rolls     If Vegas would good AYCE sushi please give them try  <EOR> Always stop Umiya every time we're Las Vegas  must restaurant visit when Vegas  Great place fresh sushi great service  Staff always helpful smiling  Love place  never enough place  <EOR> I would give restaurant 0 star if can! Bad bad bad service  none food really stood out    we  3 girls eat  YOUNG manager charged 10 dollars 3 rice left over  If only 3 dollars would pay  ALSO he really bad attitude threaten he would call police if don't pay 10 dollars        end he throw check table  really scare he would punch face moment      Never come bk place    <EOR> One best all eat sushi places!  2 stars off spilling food customers   Seriously passes dishes over people's heads?

Just sub par AYCE sushi restaurant  Everything ordered seemed rushed slop  Nigiri maguro hamachi ono all cut thinly uneven if cut old knife  tako clearly over boiled fishy which suggests cooked frozen then thawed again  All skewers overly sauced taking any flavor being grilled  Miso soup warm time lacked any seaweed tofu  did order maki cucumber wrap instead nori  roll actually turned quite refreshing fun   The wait staff seemed wanted quickly insisted picking bill 3 times prior finishing rock hard mochi ice cream  Pretty persistent leaving considering only 3 tables dining 930pm Sunday night   I don't know if I'd come back here  Though fan most AYCE sushi joints I'd suggest Oyshi over any day  <EOR> One largest menus ever seen  Everything tried excellent  plan return next week when into town   So just came back ordered No Money No Honey Peter Pan Rolls  Both excellent  happy back  highly reccommend eating here!

Overall love appetizer selection  AYCE fresh but enough flavor satisfy  dessert good but tempura part tempura ice cream good all me    Not sure if come back sorry taking money elsewhere  <EOR> I came all eat sushi lunch time  wasn't super busy which nice cause sometimes then hard service if busy  Sucks some menu items only per person then can't order anymore oysters some other items menu  Next time think come another person only smaller items cause some main rolls could half order dang almost much  Mostly cause usually just want 2 pieces something then want try something else  Unless really good then want more  fav thing tried was    raw oysters baby scallops  didn't find any main rolls liked alot cause some rolls ordered where ones can't order half order with  <EOR>
