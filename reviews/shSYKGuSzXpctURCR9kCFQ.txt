I'd say worst lechon ever had!  served banana leaf rice which nice touch but oily rice soaked much oil   couldn't even eat skin  Normally crispy even hard but still good but theirs way hard rubbery chewy   I know new starting maybe better future  <EOR> Had try new filipino restaurant neighborhood  reading reviews though many bit reluctant bit say quite surprised pleased   The food very good  sinigang different typical sinigang home restaurants but good different very good different  portions large adequately priced    The service super friendly inviting  read couple reviews horrible service but did encounter all   Its going toss between Cebu DTs now since both next house    But sinigang   I remember yummmmm!! <EOR> I am Filipino but am very familiar Filipino foods Filipino restaurants  place looks really nice server great  Unfortunately down hill that    Of course try lechon baboy Cebu style because Asawa Cebu  regular order comes rice $10 99 order 1lb lechon $15 99 without rice  decided order regular order rice Caldereta  waitress told Caldereta doesn't come rice  Anu ba yan!
