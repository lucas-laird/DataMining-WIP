Then hit   waiter brought crab legs  all made sense when four them left less 5 minutes later    Welll apologies eating your crab legs but all seriousness guys didn't miss much  didn't think fresh price wasn't worth it   Shigoku oysters  oysters probably favorite everything ordered  fresh loved flavor  much else say other than   if oyster lover try these!

A modern hip take pho restaurant District offers items take level   known lobster pho which features whole bowl!  quite tasty broth delicate balance traditional pho exquisite flavor lobster!  However set market price pretty hefty price tag typically above $40 bowl   recommend getting bowl table sharing along another item per person   The Bone which features hearty serving bone marrow pho broth delicious to! Use straw slurp marrow out!!! Does come noodles   If looking something more traditional Oxtail Pho hit spot   Speaking oxtail oxtail fried rice favorite things here!

SIDEBAR ended forgetting wallet didn't realize until back hotel room Vegas strip  Thank much District staff integrity safeguarding until made back restaurant pick up! <EOR> The food unique special  Very fresh coming since day Quality !! <EOR> This used Cravin Cajun place  hadn't but headed somewhere else dinner place caught eye  thought maybe would good   It wasn't bad but wasn't something would back either    It upbeat atmosphere  Everything kind new inside looks nice  giant chalkboard somebody spent lot time writing signature dishes but chalkboard back corner being new customer much other noise going didn't even notice until halfway into meal  There's also 8 foot picture lobster pho advertisement also positioned way only hostess pointing would've noticed  dimly lit place types signs need highlight light noticed   The hostess asked if wanted booth but myself decided sit bar  guy bartender seemed eyeing he going take order  If sit bar order food prefer order server but never just flow  The lobster pho obviously something trying push  decided try that  price listed 'Market Price ' personal opinion when guest orders something listed label server should suggest price  Only ordered  why     A woman dressed plain clothes appeared manager maybe even owner because she sitting guests overriding register accepting delivery which strange 9pm Saturday night but   who am   But she casually walked while eating asked was  lemme that   the important part   The lobster pho full shell garnish  hollow but only thing gave dish substance  broth clean flavorful but bare  typical pile noodles bottom bowl but entire dish 1  Broth 2  Noodles 3  Lobster 4  Couple slices onion   from most least  flavor right but hoping more when manager asked halfway through couldn't really give correct assessment  If she asked moment service finished would probably more say but asking while mouth full indication something isn't right    Like said   it wasn't bad but wasn't anything knock socks off  Although dish actually more traditional Americanized versions popular only so  if bill going show $40 pho $5 tea would prefer known going priced because started dish dropped immensely upon learning value such    On side note bartender little personal questions  understand bartender supposed sort quasi therapist patrons but he acted more he reporter questions  wasn't ordering any alcohol  But he found involved community event beauty pageant girls  He told servers competing but think he trying grab attention  Problem while trying girls attention he pointed she almost running me  didn't recognize but she work clothes just wanted verify  He told name still didn't recognize wondering if same price pho   deceiving end disappointment getting Thai massage without happy ending    It's shame because broth good  place upbeat atmosphere but location bad prices little inflated being rundown area getting surprised fifty dollar bill soup tea kills any good taste mouth  know seafood cheap but thinking would sugar top  Instead eating bowl rice finishing finding actual fried meal worms    I don't think return again  <EOR> Delicious Ox Tail pho! Definitely necessity when your visiting Vegas! Perfect dish replenishing! <EOR> Came Sunday night dinner some friends  never heard place really excited dine here  Atmosphere really nice relaxing wasn't busy   We ordered some drinks bar before seated  hostess really sweet sincere  She sat big booth able sit 6 us  started 2 orders fish tacos  1 taco each person mini  Tacos good but literally teaser  then ordered 2 fresh springs rolls came 4 per order  your average spring roll but still very good  Then ready order ordered oxtail fried rice over medium egg  bf ordered District 1 combo rice platter which came short ribs kim chee chinese sausage your choice garlic noodles white rice  He chose white rice  Our friends table ordered Birds nest which crispy noodle chow mein also order grilled squid which really gooood rubbery  Everything cooked really good tasted even better   I would definitely come back place try lobster pho which most popular menu item  <EOR> The lobster pho okay think looks better tastes would order lobster pho next time glad experience but don't recommend lobster pho anyone else everything else menu pretty good very reasonable price great service very great atmosphere  back <EOR> Our waiter great he helped narrow down menu pick oxtail spicy hue broth which amazing!

ALOHA!!!!  Shaka Meter \uuu \uuu \uuu \uu  3 5   *Little more A Ok right now wiggle room improvement    <EOR> We wanted adventurous night decided try District One  Once remembered once when first moved but couldn't remember anything besides interesting drink menu   The decor inside kind mix between casual restaurant sports bar  lot interesting sounding dishes but unfortunately lot them live interesting descriptions   The garlic chicken wings probably last thing ordered came excited them whole time waited  time came pretty disappointing  Very dry no flavor outside  When asked any sort sauce thought could brought chipotle mayonnaise which really unappetizing does chicken wings   We short rib which alright but extremely salty point couldn't eat more few bites   We also ordered papaya salad boyfriend love love loves those he said worst he's having few papaya salads since then would agree  just made same way usually very little flavor no crunch salad   On high note garlic noodles very good steak tartare which believe titled vietnamese take dish found uniquely tasty   The dessert best part meal  Coconut ice cream inside half coconut very delicious crisp overwhelmingly sweet  <EOR> Pho pho pho     I'm big soups stews anywhere  serving some kind variation hit list  Broth 4 5 Dist 1 few times time thinking salt slipped cooks hands but most time broth solid  Meat always taste fresh tender though    Appetizers ehhh    haven't blown away calamri grilled nor fried  Chicken wings LOOKED better tasted  Drinks    yes! love drink menu  drinks unsung heroes! tried coconut mojito which comes fresh coconut big deal me   if fresh coconut it! good morning aVietnam amazing well   Last but least staff kind interior very spacious which love definitely recommend trying spot  Love bar here! Easily best off strip huge selection whiskeys cognacs  <EOR> In Hunger Games series District supposed holy land riches beauty  Er    maybe better comparison would first class flight flying coach you'll both getting same destinations just certain amenities first class experience all better  cushier seat dim lighting more leg space more flight attendant service  District should probably take cue Jet Blue    The service unfortunately gets worse worse each visit  first few visits started longer wait times food progressively gotten worse service experiences long time  No necessarily rude but lack sense urgency really killed experience  Maybe should seen coming when took day half waiter take order which usually big deal you're busy it    We told server orders less 2 minutes tried cancel fish tacos because even happy hour pricing cost value negatives    When asked response just put your order   know came table right placed but you're telling can't change order now because somehow past 2 minutes fish being cut fresh Pacific Ocean taco shell being made fresh obviously exaggeration because fish tacos took over 20 minutes tables which many would presume ample time tell kitchen cancel item     What confuses most orders repeated server yet 1 order pho tai nam order steak eggs missing? Maybe kitchen having delay no problem but ten minutes later followed steak eggs came within minutes perfect except fact rice should cereal box considering crunchy was then another 10 minutes later a total 40 mins waiting food pho tai nam came minutes later well     The check another hassle its own short party 4 split check 2 ways which wrote pen still messed up  took two reprints fix things  Water refills? Wishful thinking   So Kevin T obviously terrible service why 2 stars? Fortunately unfortunately D1 best pho noodles cooked inconsistently though food majority ranges acceptable great  Sometimes theres lots love food sometimes    none   Things order Pho any except lobster Mekong River Noodle Soup Beef Carpaccio  Wings Beef fairly crafty craft beer list Things pass Belly buns Lobster pho really? #onlyinvegas Expectations great service Fish tacos I dog treats bigger come back?

This well thought business cares quality! <EOR> A must try when Vegas!!! Very cool fusion Vietnamese food Wow delicious! local know food spots <EOR> This review Saturday night dinner service happy hour service   I guess am definitely minority but thought best thing visit serendipitously meeting Eric Lisa R having them join dinner  Beyond place mediocre food terrible service  moment walked through door nothing but waiting   Waiting host ess anyone acknowledge tell put name down etc  being seated ordering waiting ice tea which came everyone else's drinks served only prompting waitress  Then waiting everyone's entree  ordered bun bo hue green papaya salad which came order   The green papaya salad large steamed 20 25 shrimp instead dehydrated small bay shrimp which add additional saltiness dish   okay  bun bo hue good robust beef flavor spicy but missing pig hock pig's blood  When asked if forgot waitress replied out  Gee couldn't tell before ordered?! can't send someone across street 168 Market  buy some? add insult injury while waiting waitress refill ice tea see waiter carrying pitcher ice tea look empty glass walk table fill glass ice tea then walk away set pitcher down  Really dude?! know your table but guess would've died spot if filled even inquired another customer's ice tea   At end meal all waiting could leave place fast enough  <EOR> Been before service great  Food even better  HOWEVER time around lady counter skipped list waiting parties  She didn't even call parties name instead she crossed without knowledge  tried ask she rude  She completely ignored until yell her  She then changed attitude acknowledged mistake sat us     Aside service table great  <EOR> Our server nice gave samples beers see which good  sculpin IPA    We pork belly bao bone marrow soup garlic noodles steak eggs  wish garlic noodles more garlicky  food overall great    I'd recommend anyone come here  <EOR> Beef carpacio     awesome    Lobster pho   WOW     Why only 3 stars     service     horrible    sorry say     But would definitely return see else kitchen produce <EOR> If you're coming bone marrow pho come earlier rather later  person party disappointed find ran 2 30pm  Then he finds second good choice deep fried crab no longer menu caution!  We party 10  thought appetizers took few minutes long come out  oysters specials day menu 3 50 each very small  thought good but would rather caviar texture it  thinly sliced meat oil interesting  good but food room temperature doesn't really appeal me  Most family oxtail soup since bone marrow pho sold out  thought good noodles thicker used to    The most negative part experience food came very different times  Half party ordered rice dishes ended finishing eating soups made way out  came eat together watch each other eat   little mean but really did suck    Other food did order decent  Buy personally fan Asian fusion  Asian food is   for example papaya salad Thai papaya salad       But would still give another chance try bone marrow pho lobster pho!   Enjoy <EOR> The food incredibly fresh delicious atmosphere fantastic staff all very friendly accommodating  must go destination Vegas  <EOR> I don't love but it  fan Vietnamese food but place your typical Vietnamese restaurant  busy plaza Chinatown parking struggle    ATMOSPHERE District urban feel it  Place spacious loud three sections  sports bar main floor booth    SERVICE Courteous friendly service  server suggested some favorite dishes attentive entire time    FOOD Not much selection  Menu consist appetizer rice noodle soup seafood  friendly server told anything oxtail popular suggested Oxtail Loco Moco which menu  Along she also suggested Rice Combo Platter choice short ribs pork chop but both $4 extra Oxtail Fried Rice    Oxtail loco moco good! Hawaiian loco moco imagined buttery gravery  Gravy itself vietnamese twist pieces cilantro  plenty oxtail inside which super tender  All deliciousness sunny side egg    perfection    CONCLUSION Obviously item enough give place accurate rating but back try more adjust rating review  <EOR> We least three times week place far best most attentive servers  very knowledgeable very friendly  Food creatively executed perfectly paired flavors  <EOR> Food ok 4 stars lemon use PHO old lemon brown yellow coke flat but changed new better   Staff nice very clean looking place   <EOR> The food really good! Everything seasoned just right nothing under seasoned over seasoned  wife ordered 5 spice Cornish hen which shared pandan creme brûlée dessert  Cornish hen served tomatoe fried rice which plenty two people creme brûlée point because sugar shattered when tapped spoon which means done properly  Only reason didn't give 5 stars because took FOREVER just check wasn't even busy  Overall service pretty good food really good  definitely back <EOR> I give 3 1 2 stars   Maybe just ordered wrong?  super hyped District even braved cramped parking lot SUV just try place out   But came away just bit underwhelmed   No pop!  No wow!  Just long drawn poot   District hoppin' no joke there   Sports TV alcohol flowin' freely lots heads tables   Very busy but luckily no wait when visited   place nice modern vibey nice leather booths   Shiny new!  But food   eh   was bit lackluster   I love some Vietnamese food love some fusion   But while may good appreciated gotta sway back classics   good fusion if don't classic down?  Does learn walk first before trying 360 kick flip?  just approach Heidi Klum MInka Kelly without mastering art taking 'grenade'?  think not   Perhaps should ordered differently District because just didn't impress   menu looks delicious rice dishes soups noodles lots Asian inspired cuisine   But day really wanted pho wifey really wanted wings     We started off Tamarind Wings   Wow   $6 sorry say felt bit ripped off   6 tiniest @$$ wings ever seen!  $1 piece damn small   mean wings literally half size those see place Wing Stop   Nearly no meat!  guess wouldn't complained if some bomb diggety wings   but   they bland   Oh just bland   bit sweetness them but it   note   No mixing flavors no sour no heat no crunch no nothing   don't think properly seasoned well because didn't much salty flavor either   plain   app definitely left wifey hungry hoping main dish would fit bill   We both stayed basic Pho Bo Vien beef pho   came table steaming hot nice   But again    what's portion?  bowl smaller used other Vietnamese places around town   $8 each bit surprised   other decent places around town same price special pho more goodies bigger bowl   little plate veggies well sharing   included some basil bean sprouts fresh chilies   pho pretty good District some great broth   overly salty lots complex flavor good palette   But boy did crave more noodles more beef sop broth up     The service excellent   Server very attentive wasn't hesitant let know if any questions menu just ask     Water kept filled   Overall OK first visit District One   wifey left hungry eating again less two hours later   think place does warrant another visit but maybe next time we'll more popular dishes serve   fancy some Big Bone Soup some Oxtail Pho! <EOR> Was first time while Vegas absolutely blown away   Everything delicious   Wish would ordered more   Can't wait visit again next time we're town!!! Definitely must have! <EOR> Came long day seated almost immediately even though crowd  Once seated served drinks left menu look through    I ordered oxtail pho came realization also happy hour ordered porkbelly buns fried     needless say amazing  always steamed buns but having fried no comparison unhealthier version   The food arrived all together immediately tried oxtail pho tender soft bite  also very crispy spring rolls which wasn't hot inside able power through appetizer   In end very satisfied decision eat definitely bring friends family because ambience great loud even though there's sports bar  5 stars all way <EOR> I've wanted District but may reason why disappointed food  modern Vietnamese restaurant city talking even some country talking introduction whole lobster pho few years back   I didn't dig interior  reminds Boiling Crab log looking tables wall fixtures  emphasis sports drinking all TV's option watch sporting events   The thing District pho broth wasn't good  tried two bowls pho oxtail fries egg rolls  thought head really modern Vietnamese restaurant improved classic elevated but pho bland  Vietnamese pho am purist  add veggies  it no fish sauce no hot sauce nothing  hook broth much decent  oxtail fries good lots oxtail meat but good Bachi's  egg rolls small filling very dry $9 4 pieces hard no me   I give them props staff  lot staff very attentive you're only helped person   At end day would back District pho  If want good bowl pho would definitely try somewhere else  recommend stepping broth game otherwise nothing enticing  <EOR> Hype real  plaza Chinatown  Service friendly portions decent    Got Lobster Pho share 7 girls $50   Nice bite each try  Very flavorful lobster cooked perfectly   The beef carpaccio really good  little smokey flavor it   The egg rolls spring rolls ok  Nothing special   Now bone marrow pho  massive ton work  Ask gloves dig all marrow sure order side noodles because doesn't come it  DELICIOUS! <EOR> Very good   calamari might best ever had  ox tail fried rice lobster pho  Both very good  lobster pho came whole  $50 though should've asked market price before ordered  <EOR> I've eating District regularly since moved Vegas  There's something D1 keeps drawing back  Other food sure if spacious layout restaurant if trendy casual vibe feel soon enter  But way found regular customer me!  They're mostly known Pho but rest menu amazing! If you're willing splurge little extra your server bring Specials Chalkboard your table some options but otherwise you'll probably very satisfied menu!   SHARE Spring Rolls Personally never fan spring rolls until tried ones here  rolls taste fresh sometimes tell myself eating healthy whenever order these  also ask no mint just because tastes strong but otherwise eat them all day    Oxtail Fries VERY generous oxtail meat fries   all need know!  ENTRÉE Rice Combo Platter rice egg cooked your preferred taste sliced Taiwanese sausages option pork chop short rib  HIGHLY recommend asking both paying extra! They're BOTH good no should choose between other  hungry stomach you'll able finish plate feel quite full happy  But if you're hungry would suggest asking both meats sharing someone else taking rest! It'll more enough    Never issue service  know they're doing!  Can't wait back soon! <EOR> Is better place eat midnight?

Steak Eggs basically Shaken Beef plate  Rice bland beef sauteéd vegetable    but wasn't mind blowing anything  Double down Garlic noodle    didn't taste any garlic there  meat all whatever   Overall just no flavor  Presentation important but what's point if food doesn't pull through? <EOR> I've twice!

My faves Shaking beef tomato rice really flavorful Garlic noodle so simple but good love all garlic ness Oxtail fried rice order mine without onions Recently pho first time tried broth before seasoning your typical sriracha housin sauce yummy!  Going say      lobster pho price bit steep  know says Market Price definitely didn't ask much would assuming would $28 $35 but when bill taken back couldn't stop laughing  $49 bowl lobster pho! Yes lobster huge but think  over priced  Maybe because lobster doesn't cost much WA even big ones lolol  first L lose loss new year hahaha  First last time order lobster pho but definitely order ribeye pho perhaps try oxtail pho next time! <EOR> This place always good me   Nice clean seating ample comfortable staff always very attentive  Tvs view pretty much any table booth seat bar    Almost without fail order fresh coconut drink meal because yes  Once you're done ask them cut half all glorious meat! sure grilled whole squid! seasoning perfect shichimi I think? mayo matches well  Anything oxtail hit including oxtail loco moco oxtail fries  Bone marrow soup delicious some gigantic bones  Ask extra broth if end running out    Love hanging friends continue coming back sure  <EOR> Love place!

This place seriously must no questions asked!! <EOR> I love innovative dishes  Must try big bone soup  tried several dishes papaya salad oxtail french fries big bone soup grilled squid bun bo hue  also Hennessy cafe su da   Oxtail french fries look appealing but practical dish opinion fries way soggy oxtail marmalade just doesn't mix much greasier taste when loaded fries melted cheese bacon   If fries very crispy I'd enjoy dish   Papaya salad decent but big bone soup took show me  enjoyed lot taste  broth did need lot lime but own preference   presentation! Although should consider machine sawing smaller piece actually chew it    The bun bo hue enjoyable  But grilled squid wasn't great me  enjoy Cafe Moda's squid better chewy dry   They did forget Hennessy cafe su da but ended reminding them comped it  Honestly I'd rather place 3 3 5 stars but give 4 customer service   Place awesome decor definitely place try  But don't think coming back any time soon  price actual product served think place different kind crowd  Don't wrong bad place all! <EOR> We came birthday dinner twenty people mostly Portland Oregon  loved it! prix fixe menu oysters half shell pork belly buns cured beef dish fried rice squid fried fish few other dishes am forgetting  only complaint squid spicy liking over grilled  Otherwise everything else delicious!

Broth nice doesn't feel greasy filled MSG would other pho soups    We also tried pork belly buns which come 3 buns  give option buns fried regular since typically regular ones decided try something different 2 fried 1 regular  fried ones ok but if back would definitely stick regular versions  Overall pretty good  <EOR> The chicken pho great! Huge portion  Unfortunately very vegetarian friendly  friend hard time finding anything menu he would eat  did prepare vegetarian spring rolls garlic noodles which he enjoyed very much  Unfortunately no vegetarian broth pho which disappointing  Cool atmosphere great bar! <EOR> Damn mean Damn!

Wonderful selection drinks too  definitely enjoyed Yamazaki which quite hard find any restaurant  only wish Hitachino Red Rice stocked yesterday    Nicole coincidentally server both times she only helpful but knowledgeable both food drink menus couldn't made experience any better  table 6 bused frequently checked several times  However another server came over check informing she taking over section when asked server could order additional items  when ordered Hitachino Red Rice she took order she came back letting know out  asked other ones naming off other types she couldn't remember which brought drink menu finds IPA   totally understand any restaurant certain items low but would lovely if servers could check 86 list prior greeting guests  mention Nicole never informed Juliet taking over  However she did very lovely attitude beautiful smile I'd love server days!
