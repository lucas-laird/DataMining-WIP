meh  very meh  nice service decently quick school cafeteria level hot dogs  pretty good place someone Vegas doesn't need something fancy prestigious carnival dog  <EOR> I really excited see Nathan's stand Mandalay Bay  walking thru shark reef hungry thought nearby food court would great stop!  Seeing Nathan's own stand different  Looking menu all normal stuff hot dogs fries shakes  prices though seemed bit high everything between $5 $10 la cart  $32 bill 2 people lunch   So order food when arrived really disappointed came compared price  Thin tiny hotdog cold buns steamed overcooked fries much flavor anything    My local movie theater Nathan's hotdogs fresh juicy large hotdogs steamed buns  Why can't actual resteraunt delicious???? <EOR> Nathan ' okay stop but bacon VERY salty  Also hot dogs sell undersized dry juicy unlike other hot dog stands  Also very pverpriced  25 ish bucks kids meal bacon cheese dog bacon cheese fries which very flaky  3 50 WATER! very overpriced  Finally think should other neighboring restraunts  quick 20 39 steps away Johnny Rockets Pan Asian Subway  <EOR> Love food Nathan's all beef hot dogs always hit spot! Unfortunately today visit best  Maria helping family menu shows $4 bottle water location two different water options  both them $4 doesn't specify anywhere menu  picking more expensive undocumented water Maria began rudely explain water more expensive menu she talking down rolling eyes also overheard talking paid left  Very POOR customer service towards situation  definitely back place because type service family recieved  Would give zero stars if option  Please update your menu retrain employees  <EOR> Completely average food expensive price  cool spring night decided grab something quick before heading into shark reef  chili cheese fries didn't much flavor weren't good remembered hot dog rather messy  onions sauerkraut relish mustard  sauerkraut bit sweet didn't really taste sauerkraut  Overall place overpriced find much better food Vegas same cost  3 stars little generous but wasn't terrible just basic  <EOR> One cashier during lunch rush seems little stupid considering 10 min order but wait between ordering being served wasn't bad all  plus   I sprung foot long bacon cheddar burger hotdog itself ok  cheddar cheese topping more less nacho cheese paste which fine  strips bacon nice touch but kinda chewy break right away caused dog fall apart  Pulling bacon eating separately remedied this   Fries?
