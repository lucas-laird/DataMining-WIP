Appetizers fine we ordered three but once again especially praiseworthy  portabella fries good enough mention though  Crisp tasty might try making them myself   Entrees      this where so so experience totally fell apart  ordered steaks medium pink throughout but raw cooked ash  steaks arrived cut determined still 85% raw  Seared less 1 4 inch outside completely undone inside  Japanese call tataki if ordered would fine but did not  called waiter he immediately took them back said he would them cooked order  When came back charcoal   Since waiter brought them back don't hold responsible  He knew ordered am sure if he seen them he would brought them us  Another member team brought them look told all needed know  Still cut them check leather brown all way through ash outside  char but two fine pieces meat ruined beyond eating   It needs said Echo Rig butcher shop specialty meat  Hmmmm?

Genius chef   loved tomahawk steak   Whenever come Vegas place amazing dinner great ambience  <EOR> Authentic farm table concept   Creative cuts offerings  keep things relatively simple focus execution consistency   Very nice   Sit balcony if can   Downstairs offers fresh butcher items some delicious looking bone broth   Definitely worth visit  <EOR> I echo rig 3 times each time service exceptional   last time however Ricky Xavier made feel royalty   sat originally near door but Xavier thoughtfully offered move somewhere less drafty   decided corner table patio under heat lamp would most comfortable     Ricky server very knowledgable menu wine selection   am server well honest   learned thing two him   started pork belly which world   main course date Ricky's recommendation spencer steak   She found delicious but both agreed lamb chops best dish night   both impressed lamb put knife fork down dove hands   finished night off shortcake cappuccinos     Thanks again Ricky Xavier! <EOR> Great food great price great service once table   fully plan returning here    Everything delicious but steak ridiculous  whoa  c'mon man  <EOR> Great steak without going strip   Reasonable prices too  Kind boring inside but outside great! <EOR> Reservations Made reservation week came time reservation only told There's 7 8 parties ahead   wait 20 minutes past reservation time  Atmosphere ambience felt eating mess hall  close no decor big open room very drafty  seated close table behind elbowed them several times accidentally   Nothing even close resembling romantic comfortable setting  Food waited two hours reservation time until received food   Many wife's well done steak medium   friend's medium raw   steak cold never asked wanted cooked        sides cold replaced  Awesome        bread bland nothing special  Service AWFUL  manager came take drink order 20 minutes being seated because ignored   drinks often empty food took least hour time ordered actually receive cold       waiter Gone most service manager extremely condescending disingenuous   He no clue he doing no right being  manager       fed crappy everything sent steaks back snacked cold sides  offered two bowls ice cream cereal bowl kind offering complete lack culinary ability people skills  When brought ice cream stated something along lines Don't mad too! supposed cold  Price       rip off  would better meal experience if ate bag frozen White Castle cheeseburgers off ground public restroom   taking two steaks off bill almost $150 $200 all said done   Luckily favorite people us    this subsided some pain  Summary   wouldn't send worst enemy here  just wouldn't right send them place  can't name thing did right during experience  one  TERRIBLE  <EOR> Great service bar  Excellent customer service overall  fantastic wine list  kale salad hotdog favorite! <EOR> Short rib hash amazing! great brunches    chorizo menu but hanging butcher's window    simple request chorizo whipped staff us   Love thick cut bacon potato cakes well  <EOR> I came without reservation but Wednesday night bit slow maitre d seated quickly courteously  messed guest note put Mr  down girlfriend's name which funny because addressed girlfriend's name but  big deal especially considering great time had   Quick note restaurant layout restaurant itself upstairs floor lovely plenty spacing between tables nice view tivoli roundabout  loud  Very pleasant   Our server Ricky he amazing  friendly funny he gave such great overview menu explanation specific items  started two cocktails le passion which great very well balanced white lightning which way sweet taste but maybe shouldn't chosen cocktail brown sugar it  Then Ricky recommended portobello fries starter revelation  must try them   For meal kale salad which sweet light exactly you'd expect then followed tie dye salmon which incredibly moist perfectly asparagus coconut rice its served with  kitchen also sent cauliflower chile dish gratis but can't remember name it  incredible perfect balance sweetness spice  certainly order when back   We finished sundaes all three sorbets other apple sundae which tasted apple la mode  Both absolutely delicious but also enormous  expected them medium size other dishes but no things enormous  Definitely meant shared    Overall great night  I'd highly recommend place  if call reservation ask Ricky your server  <EOR> Went brunch Sunday  steak scrambled better half smoked salmon poached eggs  food amazing very well cooked service 5 star bottomless mamosas amazing would recommend atmosphere awsome  Finished off cappuccino Sunday over top  Prices where ok well worth far food service  Would def reservation Sunday people where starting come 11 10 perfect  <EOR> I'm fence place   first visit little group 3 seated immediately around 9pm Friday   ordered few appetizers ribeyes off menu   Stand appetizer portobello fries many other reviewers attest   steaks cooked perfection cut butter tasted great   The next time alone husband   arrived around 8 15 Saturday wait 20 minutes which fine   Wait staff quick drink orders   time decided take advice others selected bone in rib eye share  Appetizers came quickly but steak took near 45 minutes its way kitchen   Apparently expectation steakhouse should never mess steaks asking much   asked medium rare well done instead   whatever reason don't send food back   ate few bites even well done wasn't bad which testament cuts but ribeye's pre cooked weight 26oz cost $2 50 oz $65    couldn't sit still $65 piece meat called waiter over   He saw plate instantly recognized meat overcooked called manager come over   While waiting couple next sent back salmon same problem   waiter's reaction seemed indicate happening all night long     The manager professional situation   He told he would comp steak asked if would another   already running late movie opted just comp    We ended missing movie   Although manager handled overcooked steak most appropriate way think sin kitchen staff mess seemed multiple orders   relatively new restaurant give them more chance but if screw steak again no way could recommend place anyone  <EOR> Always love Echo Rig  food excellent waitstaff  But best feature outside patio  great view Tivoli  patio nice place date business meeting  <EOR> Well everyone else posted portobello fries star evening  aoili delicious   husband enjoyed tomahawk ribeye filet  also delicious  steaks kinda pricey size served  Mine overdone just enough medium instead med rare  chef did honor special request  cook steaks over red oak however husband does smoky flavor  chef agreed cook flat grill long could serve sliced  husband did enjoy it  also ordered side heirloom carrots   Barely tried them due filling steaks  <EOR> I very happy experience going back   something found many restaurants all cooks know prepare steak chicken well many don't know bring best vegetables   very happy find best dishes sampled small plates selection cauliflower browned chili crispy shallots portobello fries   Both fantastic    The wine list gets gold star some very reasonable prices both bottles glass  Our server painfully new slightly awkward but heart right place any missteps forgiven  missed order quickly corrected comped though thought unnecessary obviously aiming good customer service which more experienced some other restaurants immediate area that includes Honey Salt ahem   For main course rib eye cap truly reasonable $22 50   served garlic chips stuffed mushroom   steak good cooked exactly right   came complimentary sauce chose chimichurri   mixed feelings part tried both chimichurri horseradish sauce equally bland   also didn't really enjoy chips mushroom much but considering most steak places no longer give anything  your steak any sides usually $7 more thought nice something it  I finished off turtle sundae left happy   All food $50 per person before tip = happy diner  <EOR> One favorite places eat special occasions   Excellent steaks   Loved portabello mushroom appetizer   Also butterfish     They carry dark beer made locally very good  <EOR> I've many times count continue come back  food great ambiance beautiful prime location excellent customer service  All staff for most part attentive friendly professional but Augustine busser really stood out  He above beyond motivated write review  all visits remember Lauren Oscar also amazing servers  highly recommend brunch Short Rib Hash Breakfast Sandwich bottomless mimosas and pour amount champagne vs

At point ask recommendations  little confused steak choices  rib eye steak menu rib eye steak buy precut slices butchers cutting downstairs  Apparently difference quality them  also difference price major difference  just found weird  mean options great but little bit much decide  think should just stick whatever feel would taste best  waiter almost made rib eye menu sound something could bought myself supermarket  He really selling ribeye steaks brought raw platter  Maybe some people would appreciate did remind experience Gordon Ramsay Steak but prices almost same strip prices those cuts meat  almost felt would making bad choice if chose steak menu  Again why just type meat your menu?

No he did not  even glance  boyfriend placed steak side table hoping grab waiter's attention  More 5 minutes when finally Xavier assistant general manager addressed if problem boyfriend's steak  boyfriend told steak tough chew wanted order tenderloin instead  Xavier apologized graciously took request reordered tenderloin  When waiter brought tenderloin he told other steak probably tough because medium rare fat didn't render  information would've great while ordering since none knew this  also pointed waiter cauliflower burnt he apologized brought new unburnt dish  Round 2   again waiter never checked boyfriend see he liked tenderloin   Good thing Xavier he made sure boyfriend satisfied  Which he he said tenderloin very good  When time dessert waiter came dropped off dessert menu  He didn't put hand he didn't over different desserts he simply set menu table walked away  WOW  When read bad reviews Yelp customer's getting terrible service bet anything same waiter  Although service horrendous still tipped over 20% because  am  knows maybe he having bad day month year? All say can't believe 2 very opposite experiences restaurant  If wasn't great hospitality service Xavier night would've ruined  He reason am giving restaurant 3 stars instead 2  no doubt food delicious but dining experience only food but also service which entire experience  Needless say embarrassed recommended restaurant boyfriend mother said nothing but great things restaurant set expectations high  Unfortunately won't dining again  <EOR> It birthday Saturday decided come dinner  dining alone  walked greeted even vaguest semblance warmth  Just fake half smile two hostesses  asked table which replied Uh ok    told would 30 40 minutes but could wait bar  sit bar because y'know empty tables no wait  felt pawning off bar  didn't state going sit eat but since could wait bar thought would since TVs   I waited half hour sitting down then stand behind hostess station  hard hearing thought would better way  Reading far didn't take name which thought odd but knows operate  keep glancing but no attempt talk ask anything  all  Another 30 minutes pass small group comes actually gives name  finally ask status table  hostess puts fake look surprise sympathy tells Oh thought eating bar!

Then butcher asked customer else he needed customer named 6 more things knew Id probably able sit down meal before could broth called ahead just sitting jar cooler    I eventually able catch butcher's attention told needed asked just grab broth when he into cooler next items  showed money exact change ready told didn't even need bag cashed out  He responded well guess the other customers probably won't mind   Yeah sure won't since literally take minute longer just grab stuff called ahead for   Don't wrong understand if someone else first wait  But could least move sense urgency act care someone waiting  Additionally appreciate they're offering something different your grocery store butcher appreciate care put into do  However if service provide going take 10+ minutes help every customer should balance something else would allow them accommodate customers helped just few minutes  least could another employee like other kid behind butcher counter check see if he could help me  know he may equipped handle all orders but he could've retrieved jars broth cashed out  <EOR> amazing amazing amazing  cocktails all delicious  Portobello fries Aioli tasty  brussels sprouts pistachio salad perfect side  quality steaks amazing can't wrong any cut choose    They also excellent happy hour <EOR> I'm sure words sufficiently express fantastic restaurant but going give best shot    First must say only gave 5 stars because  most give  If able give 10 stars 5 would   I found restaurant other reviews Yelp  friends looking good steakhouse without spending arm leg  hesitant first due location it's good 20 min off strip $50 cab ride   convinced them could any steakhouse strip course going great why try somewhere different    When arrive pull most expensive cars you'll ever see your life person  plaza restaurant gorgeous  When walk you're greatest welcomed hostess checked see if table ready  right Butcher shop which closing  then made way upstairs table    The restaurant mostly empty only two other tables people  waitress Ally think AMAZING!

Simple things but opinion difference between average great! <EOR> Let start saying fan doubt ever back Echo Rig   came late afternoon other party restaurant   brought iced tea quickly refilled frequently while there   I looked menu online took some time decide once there   starter ordered portobello fries which served herb aioli   first noticed anything stated garlic should garlic herb aioli no garlic taste all   herb aioli good but missing garlic flavor   My wife ordered tri tip steak  medium  even though suggested she medium rare ordered hanger steak blue   She drawn tri tip because menu said lemon garlic neither which evident any way   Garlic fail number 2   All steaks come garlic chips no garlic flavor  garlic fail #3 mushroom Rockefeller breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap   The portobello mushroom wonderful light coating cheese shreds   Then waited   saved some mushrooms fries steak then waited some more   Approximately 20 minutes later server said steaks would right out   He took small plates silver away   5 minutes he stopped once again said steaks would right there   5 minutes later he stopped say they'd minute   time he right   When steaks arrived noticed both cut slices just cringed   absolutely hate when done   Maybe  why FEW places it   asked if culinary reason server said he'd ask   When he came back he told chefs said steaks more tender   steak good but cooked little more would home   wife's steak less tender because medium order which did steak less juicy fair amount sinew wouldn't expect   She quite disappointed although some blame needs placed door   But above all I'd say please don't cut steak   two year old infirm   Googled when home found only reason perhaps cut steak against grain right way   We each sundae dessert   OK   I left Echo Rig very disappointed   length time ordering getting mains ridiculous when place less 1 10 full   Tuesday afternoon  not date night USA 8 PM  <EOR> Been lucky lately  restaurant awesome every way!!
