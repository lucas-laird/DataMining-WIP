Stopped friends Wednesday night   service slow but atmosphere nice beer cold!!  always good thing   menu wasn't exciting but grilled cheese chips hit spot   did mention beer cold?  All all I'd back   Just ramp service could winner  <EOR> Just other reviews service awful  Being Chicagoan lover Goose Island disappointed service could continue bad  original waitress didn't come back take food order other waitress come take it   eventually  Once done eating continued sit without anyone checking additional drinks etc   private event going two waitress over looking some product versus helping actual patrons  Seriously? <EOR> I staying Hard Rock walked sandwich play some video poker  bartender Mady she awesome! Great energy conversation  She made visit memorable made feel very welcome! sandwich good caprese wrap  over dressed   but didn't even care because hospitality world! Thanks good times! <EOR> Service terrible great  Waitress wouldn't check if needed drink refills didn't asked if needed anything   Basically took order brought when ready if wanted more drink husband would try flag down waitress  He even flag down check  would given 5 stars if wasn't service  <EOR> What joke  fiance happy give place try  Boy did hopes nothing  should known would crappy experience since Budweiser bought them  walk surprised dull boring looking inside  Being Hard Rock expected something sleek modern  Nope dull colors boring  stand waiting few minutes since said hostess seat us  workers looking chicken heads cut off  finally sit then  all  sit wait  Servers all huddled around register ring up  sad  finally napkins utensils guy wearing shirt no name tag  unsettling maybe customer feels pain horrible service  10 min no asking drink order done  Maybe should bar area  less packed  Before bar thought seeing things when server comes casino tray food  Whaaaaaat Theeeee FUUUUUUCCK!!! Then another guy comes cart food orders  REALLY???? mean tell build brew pub kitchen connected lol  very unsettling knows kind shit your food coming casino  Sure lid but grubby ass person ask something distract server someone else fucks your food  Gross!!! If gonna food violated I'd rather same place im sitting lol  head bar grab spot order Goose Island IPA  sit wait  bartender looks then proceeds say someone help us  Really dude!!! just standing can't even take drink order  few minutes no helps leave  hoping great time check new brew pub all sour taste mouth even sure if would ever back give try  Horrible service cool  Goose Island draft most places im losing out  Anyways Till Next Time       Let's Eat!! <EOR> Great brewery!   I thrilled see own pub brewery wheat beer played some poker   If put 20 your drink comped   bad eh!  They serve snacks but nothing caught attention    Nice atmosphere great beer  more ask? <EOR> I stopped later evening beer Saturday because wanted try some other brews Goose Island while place handy   wife fan IPA however particular brew isn't style   chose 312 Urban Wheat beer pleased overall   pub unusually slow plenty time savor beer talk bartender all upsets college football day!  He also very knowledgeable beers happy let taste couple them before picked 312    I'd happy come back Pub another time more beer try food! <EOR> Besides food being good service waitress given absolutely terrible  literally place over 2 hours only checked once  ask water nearly bar drinks because waitress clearly doesnt anything  stand find ask check  Then she messed split  Took additional 30 mins correct it     only ordered 3 things  Literally watched stand staring off into nothing register 25 minutes doing shit    Dont wrong saw very attentive waitress hurrying around restuaraunt helping MANY more tables woman ours she doing fabulous  experience wouldve much better if her  probably special request waitress worth damn if come back  <EOR> the food great  higher hopes chicago type atmosphere  took husband celebrate birthday tonight worst experience  local moved chicago hoped friendly experience  told couldn't bring cake which understand  but told desserts  absolutely nothing menu them  also  took forever waitresses bring food  well if asked anything else ranch forgot couldn't even tell many times waitress told she forgot tonight  sad part is  wasn't busy all different waitresses coming tables  if competition spent more time gossiping then actually serving tables  then made feel inconvenience table 8  but obviously reason why many available seats place  even irritated when asked them turn blackhawks game  <EOR> Great tv's games   awful food service! realized no fresh food coming kitchen     the waitresses walk down another location your food    so food cold! Service awful    had ask refills did more socializing another helping customers     <EOR> Would love give place little better rating but three things preventing doing so   1  When husband first walked took couple minutes girls standing around bar simply acknowledge presence  Once did first walk said could sit wherever like  issue only two empty tables stacked high dirty dishes  She made no attempt say oh we'll clean you  2  wait staff took forever just stay hello standing around bar doing nothing while waitress ran around entire seating area trying clean meet guests   3  beer selection mediocre best  Which partially understand because only serve Goose Island    With said food actually pretty decent did enjoy wheat style beer did have  Overall horrible choice bite beer  <EOR> Ok beer awesome still give them 5 stars EVEN THOUGH CANT ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!!!      mad goose island   Your other beers available many places   MORE BOURBON COUNTY   need it!!!! <EOR> Walked greeted told sit wherever  Eventually just sat down   waited  waited  busy all few employees standing around  Drinks took while table food eh   good but amazing  menu seemed much smaller posted website  But real downer charged card THREE times  When called manager staff reluctant hand phone over  Once did manager she snotty kept talking over wouldn't listen  Didn't even apologize  filed claim bank right calling them    I would recommend  back  <EOR> The beer good but order fish chips terrible   We only party entire restaurant when walked around 2 00 pm Saturday think fish order reheated earlier time just old fresh  fish light grey color chewy very pretty nasty   I used love original Goose Island Chicago local LV pleased experience don't plan coming back  <EOR> Dylan goose island bar absolutely amazing!
