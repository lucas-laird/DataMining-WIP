Good service tasty wings great deals students!! building other returns kind threw off but place good  <EOR> Super bummed see Wing King gone vast variety sauces huge part appeal along service If you're going take over same space successful business offer same type food best sure provide product good place replacing  new place same level    Menu combos require wing orders over 10 pieces more sauce which frustrating WK menu 50 sauces cut down max 15 first place   Grand opening special 10 wings fries drink $12 offers two sauces    but told they'd limiting 1 sauce future  Bad choice management lose WK's former fans   Of garlic parm cajun wings former seemed close match recipe used Wing King but less cheese while latter more rub please note menu   Bleu cheese dipping sauce disgusting couldn't tell if spoiled but color off consistency watery flavor wasn't right  <EOR> Great wings yummy flavor interesting menu cool service little bit if odd location but niffty <EOR> Would recommend place all wings  First all weird location  located inside Campus Food Court West Charleston Blvd shares space Tacos El Jefe  ordered combo #2 which included 10 wings fries celery choice ranch blue cheese 11 bucks some change  opted lemon pepper wings since usually pretty safe option     When wings came under seasoned way overcooked  Greg K's review said similar chicken jerky! heck?! never seen wings over cooked! Usually issue would them being raw under cooked  definitely happy food  No wonder nobody comes Campus Commons place  Definitely would come back recommend! <EOR> Tried place first time today pretty happy everything  tried medium Parmesan garlic garlic teriyaki sauces  sauces all pretty good but picked order late everything pretty cold time ate it  give place fair review eating again but going pick food time still hot  Until then three stars  <EOR> Was feenin some Jamaican Slam Wings Sweet Chili Glazed Fries off place satisfies craving  Wing King  *Record scratch  Huh? aint Wing King!  Apparently its whole new owner he named 702 Wing Spot  Now being open minded Yelper am more willing give guys spin   What Rat Pack $9 99   sauce 10 pieces wings fries drink  wanted play safe just honey barbeque   When brought order only 9 wings noticed soon put down front me  said just ahead start eating bring other piece  first thinking bad first impression  But 5 minutes later brought 3 pieces because felt bad mistake  impressed    As wings bad  bad all  think more bolder sauces next time Mango Habanero  fries sprinkled some type cajun spices which made pretty good  good sweet chili glazed fries but good nonetheless  Lastly 12 ounce soda  bad deal 10 bucks   As bonus when check free dessert! time all desserts available because he just opened ended going cheesecake stick which normally sells $3 99  If refer pic nice sized goodie guys sweet tooth! rich taste just good cheesecake should be   Originally gonna give them 4 stars but service more made supposedly bad first impression  guys  bit different Wing King but am more happy recommend them  those familiar place located strip mall kind setting other food joints different ethnicity  Dont let appearance fool good food service coming back!
