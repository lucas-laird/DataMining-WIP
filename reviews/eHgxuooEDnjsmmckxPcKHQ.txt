The worst food ever   Poor quality chicken terrible sauce   Could eat anything except block rice  <EOR> Eh didn't expect much place first glance menu  Orange chicken considered real chinese food sigh    Regardless long day without food basically first restaurant saw Rio  ordered duck noodle soup because did sound bad  thought duck actually alright skin crispy actually large portion duck noodles  However lot less could said noodles  noodles dry hard   fresh noodles all more instant ramen texture  Considering paid 10 bucks could least use fresh noodles? Anyway say skip place unless desperate was  <EOR> My favorite Chinese restaurant inside LV casino   Wake hangover order fish congee beef pho soup  Even more incentive come also take Harrah's Total Rewards comps  FREE food = happy poor gambler  <EOR> Chinese Chow  We defeating system purchased mini Heinekin keg @ site stop shop Rio  Beer filled Starbucks cups hand walked around casino finally planted butts @ food court area right next sports betting    Perfect!  Brew Lakers game few steps some grub  hovered back forth two choices Mah Jong won but much   $12 hot dog verses $12 Chinese food   take YOUR pick    Highlights Low lights *Pricey but think where are *Ordered BBQ Pork Soup broth wasn't flavorful ALL but nothing LOAD hot hoisin sauce can't fix *Pork itself good but overly fatty *Lines long course wait lengthy well *Service middle road  *Lots condiments your taste buds pleasure  Yes WAYYY better Chinese food  Would back? Maybe if staying Rio again fill Buffet madness    Not bad but tooo good either!! <EOR> The food smelled delicious when there  ordered wonton noodle soup egg noodles  high hopes   I promptly let down  egg noodles weren't chewy all  overcooked soggy  wontons obviously store bought 99 ranch likes probably cheapest kind find  meager servings Chinese cabbage overcooked crunchy inside  don't started broth er mean water passed soup  no flavor all  would expected place great international buffet somewhat decent Cantonese food   Perhaps being harsh  Perhaps expect much  want 9 dollars back  only 9 dollars but served crappy ass plastic bowl nastiest kind chopsitcks find which ASK FOR gave fork! Did also mention NO WHITE PEPPER? aren't true Cantonese place without it!   Thank Mah Jong ruining favorite dish  <EOR> Not sure rate since Las Vegas but if visited place near would 2 stars   My meal only cost around $9 00 could feed two people  didn't time elsewhere since convention Rio   I thought three broccoli stems two shiktakki mushroom caps few shreds carrot Maybe fried slightly crispy block tofu slightly hard rice side but eating more discovered might Chinese broccoli because leaf discovered   The sauce mild flavorless steamed white rice hard crunchy   The Chinese broccoli steams very hard cut plastic forks give sauce mild enjoy    But Casino extremely low priced maybe better some people  low priced but would elsewhere If time  pinch  <EOR> For place decent casino ran Chinese people would think would pretty delicious   actually pretty plain   Had chance taste shrimp pad thai I know pad thai Chinese place? chow fun sweet sour pork   things taste better Panda Inn     Their versions Pad Thai Chow Fun good examples cook noodles   Both chewy side   I usually any kind sweet sour pork but salty gooey side   don't know why back try other items place should known way cook noodles   won't back  <EOR> So when Vegas need some thing before start drinking night away think getting chinese food  Why chinese food? theory greasy food better alcky doesnt soak your stomach  haha! first night rush head XS stopped down since staying Rio    The prices dishes range around 10 12 dollars main dishes  might think prices steep but its family style portions pretty big! general chicken which came bowl rice chow fun  Everything nicely cooked over seasoned which came conclusion probably wasnt MSG meal which always bonus  full stock condomints soy sauce sriracha garlic chili sauce hot mustard sweet sour sauce many more  also liked cooks back old chinese guys know food sorta legit hahaha   last night food again time gf split hot sour soup Singapore noodles  Now look pictures duck should ordered too  <EOR> Overpriced Asian fast food     It's only Chinese Thai Vietnamese items    which refused try  fan Chinese food outside Chinatown SGV  only came because fast easy   I BBQ pork plate $6 88 comes NO rice  cucumbers taste horrible too  small plate too  Very expensive get   Notes * actually made Asians tho saw them cooking back * fast *expensive  Overall    no thanks  <EOR> Fast food atmosphere but great food! order you're McDonalds but when food comes delicious  pick your order when your number called  Food served plastic bowls plates plastic utensils wooden chopsticks though   Prices high considering fast food ambiance but still well worth it   I started really good spring rolls  Then when saw size main course thought twice finishing appetizer  duck soup  piled high crispy fatty duck pieces  Underneath delicious soup full egg noodles  washed down Tsingtao beer    A confession when done didn't bus table would McDonalds all Las Vegas  <EOR> I told would back word good gold  First day Vegas stop favorite Chinese restaurant lunch  ordered duck plate descended happy place  duck cooked perfection sat atop bed white rice baby bok choy some pickled carrots cucumbers  hard time deciding between duck BBQ pork w egg noodle soup both equally delicious  decided try something new fantastic  cannot say enough good things place truly hidden gem Rio  <EOR> If craving Chinese food Mah Jong disappoint especially if staying Rio   All BBQ rice plates good even Sweet Sour Pork w Rice   Prices couple dollars more Chinatown but chef's very good  <EOR> Being place inside RIO I'd say pretty captive audience especially late night  being said its still decent little spot eat if staying here  ended staying Rio some comped nights new years found myself need some food soak alcohol system late night  tried few different things place  braised oxtail good but nearly good oxtail soup California casino downtown anyone eaten late night knows am talking about  best anywhere  Yang chow fried rice really good if some other dishes rice already    getting bbq pork without rice great option its twice much rice!   The only consideration if mobile car    right near huge Chinese food area spring mountain road where more bang your buck  Then again    when casino already know going pay little more hopefully gambled enough some free food comps    Don't look anything fancy here    really cafeteria where order pick your food sit down empty table eat afterward  <EOR> Came eat watching Penn Teller  Thought options limited settled quick Chinese food   To surprise noodles pretty legit  Definitely more expensive used holla some $3 won ton mein! but FAR better expected late nite casino eats  duck noodles satisfying considering third duck nice helping choy noodles only seemed expand ate    Would come back again next time Rio  <EOR> This inside Rio   The food good but prices high compared China Town   expected being inside casino  You use points food which plus gamblers   If want free Chinese food comps always there   Food order salt pepper shrimp sea bass salt pepper string beans <EOR> Even though dishes average $10 big portions   Great sharing   Pho $10?? pretty expensive right? But don't leave hotel if staying convenience    yellow noodles just okay liked pho lot better very surprise very generous portions generous 2nd time back request less noodles more broth   noodle soups loaded lots noodles lots meat beef balls which great since lot pay for   would definitely recommend sharing because big portions  Only thing didn't crappy bowl came in   It flimsy hard eat   Definitely great spot come cure hangovers if staying Rio   <EOR> We ended eating deciding wait hour line World Buffet line    This Food Court style sit down full service place  quite expensive format even more expensive many sit down restaurants   Example $10 noodle duck soup skimpy portions    The food good portions small  other choices area would skip eating again  across street Ping Pang Pong Gold Coast  <EOR> IMHO in humble opinion Mah Jong must have if you're staying stopping Rio   The fried flounder fried rice any meats poultry Chinese BBQ selection particularly pork duck outstanding  can't wrong any aforementioned entrees  Yes price bit expensive compared say Panda Express but its high quality located casino its expected  condiments area well stocked clean  Free soda refills = Its located next sports bar if Chinese food comfort food  <EOR> Inside Rio Hotel     I'm sick   shrimp wonton soup   good   But small   My brother combination fried rice   good   But small   For $11 12 dish should fan freaking tastic yummy served bigger portion  <EOR> Mah Jong Chinese eatery just food court type place   counter order your food then wait your no  called out   food bad but little pricey side   ordered Beef Brisket Noodle Soup which pretty good   also ordered Dan Dan Noodle only OK     You ask cups your own water pop machines   Sure saves some $ way   Better still order cheap drink casino then bring drink your table  <EOR>
