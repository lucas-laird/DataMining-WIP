Good news since became fan broasted chicken when first tried Boulder City six months ago   Chicken moist juicy skin thin crispy coating  All pieces fried fresh frozen state perfect golden brown  burnt  detect chicken skin mildly seasoned garlic salt  chicken meat seems brined because flavors down right down bone    Hardly any grease unlike fried chicken    It means less fat less calories less carbs because broasted method uses pressure fryer not bros roasting chicken which seals juices within coating chicken  Chicken Fricken good! ended ordering another meal take home   They sell individual chicken pieces ranging 2 24 pieces meal deals come biscuits sides  Some sides offered fries coleslaw very generous portion mac n cheese   Prices budget friendly  Well least was  2pc chicken deal mac n cheese free soda cost whopping $6!
