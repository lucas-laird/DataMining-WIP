I never written review but think service received Daddy's demands one  am staying Vegas couple weeks friend mine told Daddy's great pizza place but couldn't find menu online  Luckily next day found menu someone slipped under door  worst pizza place ever  ordered medium Hawaiian pizza some wings shake  said would take 45 minutes hour  very late  didn't give straw shake pizza wasn't hot  wasn't even warm!!! cold VERY bland  only good thing order wings  tried calling them back but kept answering phone then saying anything  definitely ever order them again no matter late hungry am  worth all! <EOR> This worst place called delivery  just called all said all deliver area? thick accent but also hint disconnect woman's voice she says slowly where live again?  start Sa     I'm interrupted Oh sorry don't deliver   Really???? <EOR> So looking rating distribution realize tend review spots love  Reward good behavior compliment super service cheer tasty fixin's  But really yelp also opposite too  Warn others horrible experiences bland food shockingly rude employees     Which leads Big Daddy's  Also think used just Daddy's Pizza guess he felt he needed little more healthy then became *Big* Daddy  dunno  Morale story skipping right over 2 star straight Eek! Methinks not  Here's scene  Board game night some healthy eating type friends  remember menu looked very tasty presented feeling super good myself knowing such responsible delivery options   Skip over hour late maybe 10 30pm food arriving  Fine tip guy little move on   Two four items completely wrong despite ticket being written correctly  call immediately ask refund credit something say can't only send more food    everyone already going home we're wait til midnight turkey burger quesadilla  tell manager call when she gets next day 10am  record two items right cold bland    being 110 minutes making guess     Next day Manager doesn't call finally track down  She said she would send driver card machine which only way refund  Things seemed fine    10 minutes until she called back     *Demanding* know still food we'd returning food her  we didn't  wasn't right wasn't tasty even worth fridge space  plus ever return delivery food?? She appalled would expect refund something couldn't return   only way she could ever explain manager take employees salary   etc  *yelling* we only asking refund two four items   thought being very reasonable    Finally said fine  she'd send driver right over  Driver never showed up      unless person ringing doorbell middle night 10 minutes  But don't answer doorbells middle night don't know   Order your own risk  Can't imagine $20 worth having star reviews but  call guess  food decent service would gotten 2 stars me  <EOR> THey standard Pizzaria food no idea like    I natural menu    I tried quinoa first time here  excellent  vegetables always steamed perfectly yet disappointed    The guys work aren't very nice ALL  But feeling stiffed strippers all time  <EOR> Well   2 Stars because seemed much potential   though take allot blame reading reviews before ordering  thing is   hour deliver food arrived cold order incomplete  top off charged delivery fee when stated free delivery app used order  Eat 24 7    extremely helpful btw   delivery guy came back called mention missing items   he showed another 20 minutes later  reading reviews happened before  saying order them    food good enough   but very specific recommend paying cash check order before leave you  <EOR> This pizza joint near strip  slide flyers under hotel room doors casinos  bit ordered medium pizza 3 toppings soda etc  late hungry  pizza arrived hour later  small cheese medium pizza box  No didn't check paid ordered  probably oops but could flim flam shop evidenced medium box weenie cheese pizza hiding inside  pizza decent memorable especially but same any other Las vegas delivery Za  But buyer beware    <EOR> This joint obviously changed ownership direction since last review   While still sell pizza new focus seems healthy organic vegetarian food  Which sense because they're located heart stripper row  right across street Cheetahs fact  Naked chicks need watch figures ya know?
