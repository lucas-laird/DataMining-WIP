Some favorite places Tivoli 2nd floor  right list!! Seriously people if Tivoli adventure 2nd floor missing out   Went meet some friends quick drink then gallery opening downstairs  We such nice time ended ordering snacks few rounds drinks force ourselves opening! lobster mac cheese yum! burger looked really good mushroom flat bread delish! Can't talk pricing friends snuck bar paid bill  Always nice surprise! But food seemed very affordable menu!! Mostly smaller share plates perfect place sit social!  The staff seemed happy see truth told probably were  quieter side Friday night  room cool cozy bar small tables over looking Tivoli Sq  Super comfortable quiet just lovely place sit friends! <EOR> Good place hang friends enjoy cocktail glass wine     It's bit hard confusing find if you're aware upstairs   signs aren't all helpful Tivoli Village   So    NOTE upstairs front building once upstairs you'll need head towards front building   Service really good!  It bit loud because open airy but really nice place just hang out   The food pretty good   Upscale Comfort Food way I'd describe it  tuna tartare nachos spectacular   I'd definitely order again     And     reason friend went    1 3pm Happy Afternoon which featured $2 mimosas bellinis bloody marys  <EOR> In View Cheese Shop $2 draft wines $3 select beer  Must order food item drink specials  <EOR> Finding bar great view wine list food turn frown upside down   View Wine Bar happy place seems secret if never push 2 button Tivoli elevator Brio restaurant building   very happy found place somewhere grab bottle Riesling few apps dinner   definitely back again   Find end bar hubby   We'll ones bucket ice few bottles wine  <EOR> We came end 2013  boyfriend meeting mom first time thought great little spot  ordered some appetizers bottle wine  asked few dishes made vegan  No problem  came sauce send back food runner  server noticed new dish table instead asking ordered if problem she simply took upon herself ring another dish bill  She didn't check table very frequently felt more bother  check left  food okay figured would give another chance    The end 2014 came happy hour night  wines happy hour  asked if Pinot noir happy hour  server said no seemed rather annoyed  He did suggest wine similar Pinot noir brought glass taste  okay  asked price because little heavier usual pint noir  He said wasn't happy hour 68 dollar bottle wine can't remember  Whoa whoa whoa whoa!!! Now am never really care price anything but if specifically happy hour bottle why would bring wasn't? if asked Pinot noir don't happy hour your bringing regular priced wine anyway why wouldn't bring your 70 dollar bottle Pinot noir? Ugh! beyond annoyed confused motives he trying do  selling great just listen your customer!! When say Pinot noir give damn Pinot noir option  left 5 bucks table sink waters left  probably won't returning while  Hopefully service together  <EOR> The View Wine Bar favorite spot Summerlin  love open space big windows watch people shopping below  Prices expected Tivoli think well worth split bottle wine two friends leisurely hang around  View open both lunch dinner grab glass wine anytime  <EOR> On Saturday night husband hoping nice dinner friends  never before high hopes based Yelp research  When arrived friends sat but mentioned table host poured them water hadn't seen anyone since    didn't think much time   We reviewed menu while server Kelsey eventually appeared  ordered drinks husband settled 5 cheese plate burger pan seared tuna me   Our friends opted risotto bites burger portobello burger   Drinks came shortly followed appetizers  while two burgers came then maybe 3 minutes later portobello burger   They started eating realized fish never arrived  everyone else table 3 4 way through meals server came check notified her  She said she would check it    She did come back give any status update explanation  point decided didn't want dish since everyone else eaten probably eaten weight cheese plate   When another gentleman brought food told did want he tried tell busy etc  Mind tables adjacent paid left restaurant packed   When server returned exchange she did acknowledge lack food asked checks   Of course when she brought them food check  mentioned told could pay it  She couldn't away fast enough before friend physically saw mouth certain plural expletive   Needless say returning  place needs reevaluate systems servers  <EOR> The entrance restaurant hard find side building then walk stairs  But once your way top great view Tivoli Village   I ordered Butternut squash soup specific butternut squash soup really reminded bland baby food no deep flavors    Avocado crostini if let sit few minutes crostini becomes soggy  menu description thought avocado orange tomato going sliced placed crostini bruschetta but similar guacamole  flavor still solid just expecting   Chicken pot pie nuggets piping not under seasoned   Mary's fried chicken really fried chicken but rather lightly fried chicken pan fried both sides finished oven  Chicken needed taken oven minute sooner because slightly dry  chicken well seasoned thought apple Brussels sprouts complimented chicken nicely    Apple cobbler glaze apples overpowering enough crumble average tasting cobbler   I actually ordered peach cobbler but brought apple cobbler  did notice until few bites then told waiter  He said he brought wrong one  would think way cobbler garnished he could tell which which  He said kitchen peach but take another 15 minutes  passed offer still ate it  He ended charging cobbler but would nice gesture if he removed bill  Other waiter pleasant left wanting come back again  <EOR> 6 friends gathered eat happy hour delighted meals  no complaints food ordered berry salad cheese bites angus burger more  All very delicious could complain $2 Bellini mimosas  downfall waitress Crystal  She very condescending us  While enjoyed atmosphere food extremely disappointed customer service  <EOR> I walked expecting love place  vibe decor great wine bar  ordered charcuterie board which nice spread  entrees where really fell apart  spent $70 food two people still left hungry  portions tapas sized but full entree priced  shrimp tacos $10 which tiny tasted something would theme park  Nothing special verging bad  wedge salad worst ever far  fries undercooked burger sweet flavor it  served everything tiny plates suppose look but made actually eating your food difficult  Never before left restaurant hungry  service poor  back  <EOR> Upon arrival greeted immediately hostess stand asked would sit  nice touch instead being taken any table  selected table adjacent window which afforded beautiful view courtyard  asked happy Hour told only wine cheese shop across hall  noticing only bar seats tables 2 available decided stay party 4   Overall service friendly water glasses refilled without asking   The wine list fair number choices  However price wine glass high side   A number  items selected small plates great sharing    Flatbread Caprese served warm similar Margarita Pizza  juicy full flavor  Wrapped dates almonds goat cheese proscuitto wonderful combination flavors served delicious balsamic sauce side  Meatballs 2 dipping sauces pesto garlic tomato chutney  meatballs  mixture beef veal  Great flavor well paired 2 sauces  Angus cheddar burger garlic fries  burger good but nothing special  2 burgers ordered medium 1 more towards well done  fries tender heavy garlic   The dining space comfortable conversation friendly until live music begins 7 00 PM <EOR> Not impressed food wasn't great  can't tell favorite  pot pie nuggets ehh breaded me  Tried triple angus cheddar burger pork belly  pieces pork belly thick kept falling off burger took off  bartender really nice though  But still don't think give place another try  stick Echo Rig  <EOR> Outstanding Happy Hour!
