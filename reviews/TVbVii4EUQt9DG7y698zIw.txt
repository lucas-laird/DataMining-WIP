Otherwise wouldn't forgiving give place two chances   Came last weekend wee morning Sunday some club munchies since only place open Aria where staying at  seated right away very pleasant hostess but everything downhill  ordered chicken waffles rib eye steak steak eggs  rib eye steak more medium side medium rare girlfriend's steak medium well rather medium rare  She asked another steak made medium rare but second also medium well  hungry wait forced overcooked steaks down throats  When paid bill friend realized wheat toast completely forgotten server pack us   Later afternoon gave place another shot it  first wanted some champagne but server no idea which champagne wanted  Since no drink menu available didn't know café carried surprised server couldn't tell had  opted traditional morning early afternoon dose vitamins aka Bloody Mary which isn't menu now see why   It lacked any garnishes bitter couldn't ourselves drink any more it  replaced them Hemingway which relief actually quite refreshing  tomato basil soup good filled up  Aria burger however salty taste  badger friends into helping finish it   If avoid place all cost  quality par prices service poor  always check Yelp before making any decision  <EOR> Came breakfast before heading airport  First star hostess offered hold luggage front wouldn't cart all over reastaurant    Second star seated immediately no waiting all  Third star server super nice friendly  She still let order off breakfast menu even though 11am cut off  Nice  Fourth star huevos rancheros freakin good! Omg learn them!! practically licked plate lol  I did deduct star cause coffee whack  Way bitter no matter much cream sugar added  Coke instead  All all definitely great meal <EOR> I red velvet pancakes wasn't bad quality but extremely overpriced  dipped gold cream cheese? <EOR> Given place reflection if aria hotel hence name location very disappointed  restaurant does live standards aria let alone good vegas cuisine   Service 3 5 stars  While sometimes waiters took little longer then we'd overall very friendly quiet take order did well keeping drinks etc    Atmosphere 4 stars  place looks amazing  Love earthy decor if rocks succulents outside  Very beautiful decorator did amazing job  Also love leather booths near back restaurant very comfortable luxurious    Now food    2 stars best  Lunch disaster  Everything bland low quality! Cesar salad must most boring salads ever eaten  Lacking flavor dressing rather watery  nachos ok something could easily concocted college velveeta cheese  spice nachos good though but also could starving since salad blah      breakfast other hand wasn't bad  Dreaded coming back breakfast horrible lunch but rushing knew obviously wouldn't busy  eggs Benedict bad well cooked hash browns pleasant surprise  Still nothing amazing though price  can't really see place improving unless totally redid menu recipes more likely then just continue open since hotels main quick cafe restaurant hopefully new place all together come in    we see  many great places strip don't waste meal let alone two meals place  <EOR> Great service  omelettes good but great  potato cakes aka hash browns unique good  Overpriced even breakfast Vegas  <EOR> While staying Aria twice breakfast   first time fine quick service good food   second time however convinced last time there   hour no food   server nervous he brought complimentary fruit plate   walked but before getting hold manager handled situation very poorly   Rather empathizing he asked back table he would look into it   Instead told leaving  <EOR> The Aria beautiful luxury hotel Strip  3 rooms very nice indeed  Aria Cafe falls short every category restaurant associated level accommodation  Hotel senior management should embarrassed asks its guests near place  Skip just irritated  <EOR> A little bird told best breakfast Vegas  walked 45 mins flamingo aria  ordered recommended items ultimate omelette  came shrimp goat cheese  throbbing brain both those sounded good  food came quickly very happy egg white fresh fruit substitutions no upcharge but quickly verified IMHO shrimp egg cheese good combo    Service ok course expensive $20 just omelette   Typical Vegas style   If staying Aria would eat again  Otherwise stick something closer home base  <EOR> Ate last night 11pm  Don't know why place gets such low reviews  husband helped served promptly everything tasted delicious! no time! hash browns!

P S  exaggeration when say Eggs Benedict ordered Café Vettro worst breakfast lifetime! entire lifetime! ham tasted air texture rubber  eggs sour runny   hashbrowns cardboard  staff least friendly though  But very disorganized  Wear your sunglasses since reflection off huge glass windows almost knock over  host even warn haha  <EOR> Loved red velvet pancakes!

We around 12 00am late night dessert  line but good did need wait because friend VIP ARIA  service slow  think enough staff night because restaurant packed all only half full   Anyway when looked menu everything seemed different  remember better fancier menu last time came for late night dinning   dessert section more variety but now only couple simple dessert                We only shared Chocolate Lava Cake $7 00 tasted so so     so disappointed!   I don't think back again! <EOR> I some breakfast yesterday since few places offered breakfast  didn't expect actual full service restaurant hesitant dining but it   As host took seat thought server asked wanted drink  asked water proceed place order but she said server moment  confused moment place is  Didn't know people only bringing drinks  server Luis shows takes order  ordered breakfast sandwich which consists bacon ham eggs cheese ciabatta roll thick square patty hash browns   The sandwich decent portions ok price paid for  quite shocked prices when browsed menu honestly felt ordering walking just some cheap mcd's but glad gave place try   Service overall ok  sure if I'd eat again though  <EOR> Let start saying im usually pretty patient but service just way slow   Took bout 20 min seated when whole place empty 20 min waiter come   god knows long food here      Definitely recommend rhis place never come again no wonder 2 star rating  <EOR> This great place enjoy delicious breakfast  If you're anything Vegas routine big breakfast big dinner!

Lo behold he offered coffee go   Wow huh?  But still most miserable meals cheap  V Day!  Ouch  <EOR> A typical hotel Cafe  came twice while staying Aria Hotel Casino   Cafe itself looks beautiful  Very modern large windows throughout restaurant thus providing enough natural  lighting most restaurant  furniture also modern comfortable chairs quartz table tops posh benches around booths   Now food  thinks mediocre best  first time ordered Deuce Breakfast  two everything such eggs toast sausage bacon pancakes coffee  thought breakfast bit pricey side  quality served $16 00 plus coffee  food more bland side  Yes eggs sausage wasn't good  bacon good but much fat it    The second time ordered Spaghetti Meatballs  think order $20 00  Again didn't think worth it  Proportion wise fine  Enough individual content  However whole dish bland  Tasteless sauce flavorless meatballs use plenty salt Parmesan Cheese spaghetti  finished only because hungry didn't want drink alcohol later empty stomach   Overall cafe really nice place  service decent while food took around fifteen minutes  waiter waitress kept filling glass water asked if everything okay  nice! But quality food needs improve  thought bit pricey served especially when its worst cafeteria food   Anyhow great place but mediocre food  use improvement please  Three stars  <EOR> I twice breakfast simply love it   The service friendly except encountered serious problem  requested more jam table which waitress brought  3 4 into meal she came took jam away without word  still toast basket  NICE Regina!

Was just waiter? conserve budget   <EOR> Having no breakfast plans Sunday morning decided mosey over Cafe Vettro Vdara   exterior seemed promising since line long figured reason its popularity   no rush decided brave line   Unlike many other Vegas hotel cafes very efficient line moved painfully slow mention exit situation mess EVERY TIME someone left maneuver through long line   Since line moving slow made WRONG assumption must totally full didn't panties wad   However hostess sat looked around noticed least 1 3 more tables totally empty clean   understaffed just plain didn't know manage large numbers people even though restaurant clearly capacity so   The environment nice huge windows provide great natural lighting decent people watching view   decor modern but already worn somewhat haggard looking which surprise given new resort it     We ordered Bloody Mary's equivalent  would served complimentary drink penny slots Fremont Street flavorless small unappealing eye topped green olive taste texture wet sponge   wouldn't minded all much other $10 piece!!!!    We both ordered huevos rancheros terribly bad but absolutely worth $18 per order!  fine order being smaller side but $18 expect least little flavor   The next day dined Bellagio cafe breakfast bill came exactly same price dining experience Cafe Vettro   ordered similar things 2 Bloody Mary's two southwest omelets    The difference?  meal Bellagio fresh tasty well worth price  mention line twice long waited less half time did Cafe Vettro   I suggest Cafe Vettro two things   increase quality serving decrease your prices   can't away charging Bellagio prices without delivering Bellagio quality  <EOR> Interesting all negative reviews here  think rate place is  place quick bite cheaper meal before town    I came 2 young sons dinner while mommy strip well known adult restaurant friends  First the hostess very pleasant very good mood she seated us  server Ron spectacular!

EXCEPT Vegas priced   Let's just say wanted filling breakfast before work tradeshow down early before masses  two person wait which super easy  two lines regular patrons advanced M life members  which totally normal thing Vegas casinos!  I seated comfy booth all lonesome  mentioned work bus person server really great timing speediness   I planned order very basic meal eggs toast bacon but when saw $20 figured $8 should just steak eggs which did!  Before food arrived server brought whole tray condiments  ketchup various jams hot sauces steak sauces  great little assortment dipping goodness   most which didn't even use   I also served carafe coffee cup  bonus soy milk which really didn't think would coffee  Bonus points   It honestly felt being served room service restaurant  Maybe silver covering tray food before set before me  steak which ordered medium well pretty well done time reached it  eggs perfectly over easy  However didn't say hash browns come square brick just said hash browns assumed normal breakfast style  asked extra crispy looked tried top bottom little more crispy but really good all! toast even warm butter couldn't melt it   As tore through steak okay meal  left lot desired but did trick filling before long work day most likely no lunch  service great no issue service all   It's over priced room service sit down order    <EOR> Server horrible  Apparently restaurant doesn't lemons  Every table around lemons  took 7 requests lemons before received them  great experience  <EOR> They changed name cafe but still equally bad maybe worse   Cafe Vettro now its Cafe Aria   Service good   waitress friendly she could but just many other tables tend receive good service   Food maybe average   felt waste time money   Sorry  <EOR> I thought would better place inside Aria  selection Ok but more 24 hour dinner  Some improvements might better place enjoy some great food  <EOR> We recently terrible breakfast based experience don't see myself ever eating again  service super slow food hot coffee hot food wasn't cooked requested   all all every aspect meal sucked! together Aria! <EOR> I loved eating here!  Great view canoe sculpture buildings   coffee shop rocks!  food good too   lemon chicken delicious daughter it   chicken wrap also good  <EOR> Cafe does place justice  its better most mid tier dining options strip priced too    Atmosphere love wide open humongous ceilings large packed earth columns  large windows face entrance roundabout  Lots great natural light  place fit tons patrons  quite elegant inside    Service service usually great  few times complaints right change shift peak breakfast lunch  and just service check order more food never food arrival   Food options plentiful range healthy dishes decadent  Another wonderful surprise presentation  all dishes pleasantly plated flair e g  Edible flowers deconstructed etc   All dishes massive probably don't need many any sides    Highlights  the chicken egg salad bright colorful clean  biscuits gravy rich gorgeous came three 2x1x1 inch pieces immaculate pork belly  sweetness biscuits seemed blasphemy first but really worked richness dish albeit could little less sweet  parfait gorgeous deconstructed plate tons fresh peak fruit  nearly many berries side dish didn't need order both  All berries peak freshness point e g  Plump intact blueberries   huevos rancheros tasty  All poached eggs came perfect    Price $15 25 most mains  complaints other reviews don't hold water me  first all Aria if want inexpensive diner meal shouldn't eating MGMs most expensive property  Second size food huge rarely see any table ate all food  Third pay more buffet Aria elsewhere but same amount food less  buffet bias doesn't apply  Fourth lastly quality food great here    I'll continue come back  <EOR> Had breakfast here  eggs Benedict excellent  coffee hot should asked replacement  waiter somewhat imigma first thing mouth would paying breakfast? Room charge said he then asked room number name!I think he then verified told extremely offended this! If said Cash would he ask see cash?! immediately deducted $$ tip! He judged appearance  BIG Mistake! BIG MISTAKE!  But cannot ding food very delicious! ordered eggs Benedict steak n eggs deuces breakfast! waiter really only negative did deduct star! <EOR> Like most everything else Vegas days place way overpriced get  food OK save corn beef hash which salty mess little corned beef mixed potatoes top more potatoes  service extremely slow  only because staying hotel  Otherwise no reason place  <EOR> After shutting down Queue Bar Cosmopolitan hubby stumbled over Cafe Vettro some steak eggs  Service fairly quick 6 30 a m  however food completely unsatisfying over priced  Usually everything just tastes great when you're drunk hungry but time  little remember 22 steak thin bland overcooked  Definitely going again  <EOR> No matter time service always going bit slow  When its really late practically nobody means less staff well  nearly hour because only two waitresses seemed serving entire place  steak sandwich just ok  huge pile nachos guy other table next looked lot better   The next morning when came back breakfast lot more waiters waitresses but course because busier still didn't stop table often  seafood eggs benedict pretty good  <EOR> We ate breakfast brunch twice while stayed Aria  convenient location much wait depending when go  only drawback exceptionally slow service experienced first time there  Breakfast should take hour half we're wasting valuable pool time here!  Our first trip all breakfast along mimosas bloody marys  once seated took forever waiter come over menus  took forever come back give water which ask twice  took forever come take order  took forever food here  sensing theme here? generally took forever   I steak eggs which phenomenal  scrambled egg whites mine which cooked perfectly  steak seasoned nicely cooked liking  hash browns good  mean cleaned plate  exactly hoped for   My friend ordered something jalepenos asked without jalepenos  did she get? Tiny pieces jalepenos all throughout dish  When she mentioned waiter he mumbled something telling cook took item off bill since mostly edible her   Our second experience much better fast service all around no issues food  all split bunch dishes chicken fingers nachos caesar salad quesadillas  Everything really really great except quesadillas  found ourselves longing quesadillas pool other day instead   Overall great spot eat Aria if right time! <EOR> I admit am bit surprised low 2 5 ranking overall Aria Café  put 5 stars given category put Aria Café experience relative expectations    I few hours kill before leaving airport 5 days all gamed speak  decided lunch Aria Café thought it'd most relaxing low key place  wasn't expecting much honest but service very good more importantly Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad extremely delicious  wish would discovered Café earlier trip would tried breakfast sure least another lunch despite fact inside    Overall very impressed  <EOR> We came looking breakfast food burgers night wholesomely disappointed    At first glance restaurant stunning  sweeping glass walls interesting architectural features intimate booths  Aria Café sight behold  Which kind told service food would match settings  took few minutes drinks which forgivable but took even more time hold real waiter take food order  Drinks overpriced  they're menu advised sodas $5  Stick water if you're going drink anything  menu itself sits around $18 plate ready shell $42 appetizer entrée    On actual meal loaded tater tots highlight evening  chock full lovely green onions nice mild cheese sauce thickly cut chunks bacon  However everything downhill there   ordered croissant egg sandwich cheese friend ordered without  She didn't sandwich much  cheese substantially better but sandwich itself wasn't great  wasn't worth $18 price tag top off almost choked inhaling flakes off croissant  good way start meal  Another member party ordered chicken sandwich which incredibly acidic tasted almost completely pickle she wasn't able finish  completely totally unacceptable  Also words potato salad tastes soap     Service good but wasn't very quick  manager kind enough remove check might understaffed  However food frankly inadmissible price  definitely miss Aria Café  you'll find far better options worth price just few steps away  <EOR> Not bad good   Little bit pricey compared serve  I batter places <EOR> Not very tasty but if you're gonna something albacore tuna melt sandwich tomato basil soup  Everything else sucky such ribeye salmon veggies even fries  mess french fries? Boo  <EOR> Given late clubs bars close you'd think Strip would tons choices late night eats   Although hotels probably figure late night crowd won't sober enough care   Which admittedly isn't worst bet Vegas     Located Café Vettro's old spot inside Aria can't say if ARIA Café just new name true replacement   way easily nicest 24 hour café Vegas its open space huge windows modern décor   Service pretty nice well but kitchen slow   Even though mostly empty when buddy walked late lunch still took almost 30 minutes food come out   Wanting something light yet filling ordered GRILLED CHICKEN CIABATTA served Pepper Jack Cheese Poblano Chilies Guacamole Tomatoes Spicy Mayonnaise side Fries $15    While sounded great menu sandwich fell short   chicken okay but relative lack guacamole mayo coupled thick ciabatta bread made dry dry sandwich   ended leaving most bread behind but least fries weren't bad a little salty    Although particular dish wasn't terribly priced saw several menu were   may Strip but $20 Beef Fried Rice?  $22 Fish n Chips?  Thank goodness reseort credit   ARIA Café might bad breakfast clubbing drinking The Henry Cosmo better but sure say same lunch dinner  <EOR> My husband came Aria specific restaurant but checking prices realized wasn't worth ran into Aria Cafe totally pleased food service <EOR> Gross gross gross meatloaf    You'd think fancy hotel would chef could somewhat decent meatloaf    The hostess really nice  waiter little annoying but somewhat nice  just grossed food    My meatloaf rubbery hunk something  husband easier time cutting steak knife  gross  Boston markets meatloaf thousand times better  <EOR> After waiting 20 min line table breakfast waited another 45 min food then left part Oder wait condiments  short place terribly run  <EOR> You would think huge line into place would indicate hottest coffeeshop strip   However line vegas illusion restaurant shouldn't even welcomed circus circus Reno let alone Aria which beautiful   8am should ready rock breakfast but didn't even instruments out   There nobody restaurant line BS   service could compared Denny's 3 morning   eggs runny coffee swill waffle plain zero wow factor   many options vegas please yourself favor take your business elsewhere put better food option spot  <EOR> Tried place breakfast during last stay Aria    The line long during 10am time but Mlife line if pearl above  Hubby stood middle lane an Mlife lane didn't actually find useful since hostess kept seating people lanes side  hangry watching 6 people each lane getting shown seats finally hostess asked why kept skipping line  until then finally sat    The breakfast menu pretty small just basics eggs toast potatoes pancakes  Definitely overpriced but Aria all  Hubby decided keep simple three egg style which comes potatoes meat I turkey bacon hubby real bacon toast    When order's came room style service where covered uncover food noticed three eggs definitely half egg territory  Hubby's egg portion much larger mine  If paying $17 simple breakfast better damn well full three eggs!! immediately called server then called another server both saw egg portion agreed no way could three eggs  She asked if she could take plate away show chef said no  already starving point no way going let take food away  she agreed bring another set eggs side  Eggs came 5 minutes later imagine 3 full scrambled eggs!!  Overall would come back  Nope  whole situation left bad taste mouth  tons other amazing breakfast places Vegas  <EOR> For such upscale hotel expected better fare better menu better service  More bar menu  The ambiance nice   but burgers wrap? Come on! I mediocre caesar salad   nothing special except price$$$   The Aria mall pristine upscale   as should be  <EOR> Food pretty good  Nothing unique memorable besides decor 60s music absolutely killed mood  need keep theme instrumental chill music  Ciabatta chicken sandwich ok  Bread lacked traditional ciabatta flavor  Sweet potato fries bit soggy  Hummus pretty good though pita tasted bit raw? <EOR> I few times during stays Aria but guess done review before   lunch before leaving airport   did wait few minutes seated but service quick   I ASIAN CHICKEN salad napa cabbage carrots bean sprouts cucumbers baby peppers snow peas crispy wontons citrus ginger vinaigrette   salad really fresh crisp   love wontons   Seems theme other salads order   I worked bit while sitting staff seemed fine it   checked occasionally handled check quickly   Definitely nice casino coffee shop   Good food good service   Lots interesting things menu  <EOR> Had very nice late lunch Super Bowl Sunday right before big game kicked off  arrived McCarran mid morning headed see Seven Magic Mountains before checking next door Vdara  time starving Aria Cafe short walk hotel lobby    We greeted seated immediately  opted fried chicken sandwich  perfect welcome Vegas meal  generous sized fried chicken piece buttery fried chicken goodness  served potato roll lettuce tomatoes pickles mayo  asked tater tots instead fries great  fried chicken moist great crust its batter hint butteryness it  great bite eat  Nice tasty  potato bread bun right call sandwich  tasted great held well  tater tots?  always good call  Great dipping some ketchup    Also ordered off specials menu thai bbq chicken rice meal  massive  Half chicken roasted served sweet Thai glaze served white rice  Good stuff    Complimentary bread beginning meal hints sourdough nice soft but whipped butter came bland  Service excellent  waitress attentive without being overly so  She checked often refilled water countless times thirsty brought all condiments asked for   Aria Cafe nice casual place grab bite when City Center area  recommend sure  Restrooms within restaurant towards back corner  Very clean expected  <EOR> We dined very late Saturday night  server Veronica seriously made night! She sweet energetic  honestly would given place 3 stars if weren't her! no wait whatsoever restaurant spacious well designed    My boyfriend ordered pizza ordered steak sandwich  He wasn't crazy pizza knew wasn't great when he left next morning  Everyone knows cold pizza always best  still picture tasting good sandwich though  mushrooms cooked meat perfectly  fries delicious also  only gripe little expensive but Vegas all! <EOR> We breakfast very good enough start load tank  just wait approximately 10 minutes seated service friendly too  <EOR> Surprised somewhat negative bias reviews  Going lunch worked very well bowl chili quite tasty service good too  tip pay bill exit through glass swing door into main entrance area Aria  does look exit fact if did see others would never know possible  <EOR> Another disappointment what's happening Vegas? Stopped late night snack walked away unimpressed  chocolate fondue massive let down  While service ok there's nothing would bring back place  *WHAT* stacks glass plates? look giant upside down plastic cups  PASS!!! <EOR> Another visit Aria Cafe once again great service excellent food  cafe Aria all inexpensive food fresh wide variety professionally served  Luis server time great! Just great   If wanted low quality food pay absolute lowest price possible plenty other choices  come pamper ourselves enjoy quality  Hence 5 stars  <EOR> Aria beautifully modern resort cafe decor reflect although color scheme little cold utilizing lots grays    The Good Our service great contrary many reviews     The Bad Yes Vegas expect high prices  However also would quality somewhat reflected price   Steak eggs $25 cut meat full tendons fat   Half edible   food coloring also made lose appetite to defense believe 90%+ restaurants meat good coloring    think becoming vegetarian   The Chilaquiles drenched Salsa Verde which tasted came can    eating salad drenched dressing   flavors didn't come through all could taste salsa verde   Most if eaten   Red velvet pancake okay   Topping overly sweet   Great if Buddy Elf   Being ably customize would good   sugar overload before adding syrup which did come side   The fresh juice highly recommended waitress   ordered without questioning   Afterwards found charged $7 lemonade more watermelon juice  fresh squeezed element good   But   for price would rather fresh pressed green power juice Canyon Ranch Spa   Lemon+water+sugar just doesn't seem warrant that     Total bill $80+ tip 2 adults   left hungry     <EOR> I rolled into Aria cafe 8 45 pm seeing Zarkana  Now first all 8 45 late especially Vegas fact Zarkana just ended should expected bit rush  Apparently didn't   When walked first two hostesses seriously two hostesses asked table she told would 5 minute wait  seriously nothing but open tables far eye could see  pointed hostess empty tables everywhere she said only two servers working    So literally same number hostesses servers?!?! kidding me  only 2 servers late when show letting out? manager scheduled should immediately fired   Once finally sat things better but only moment  did acknowledge immediately well take food drink orders very quickly  breakfasty mood opted omelet    The omelet itself quite tasty but hashbrowns accompanied omelet horrible  hashbrowns came round circles  seen before other wannabe high end restaurants  always suck  people table next also ordered breakfast lady looked hashbrowns said hell this? She equally unenthused tasted   I also toast omelet  serve toast dry allow butter yourself   great theory but here's problem   butter only melts toast when toast hot  time toast your table hot enough melt butter  would much rather butter when toast still hot butter melt  Even buttered toast still tasted dry because butter couldn't melt into toast   The service continued downhill point  Due dry toast drank soda pretty fast waited refill  waited waited waited  didn't actually refilled until finished meal dropped off check  Argh!  Additionally another customer ordered fish chips which say looked amazing wishing ordered instead asked malt vinegar put fish  pretty standard request fish chips but server absolutely no idea customer asking for  Seriously?  Honestly expected more restaurant 5 star resort   Now say omelet good but nothing special fish chips looked amazing entire space cafe very nice  solid base maybe some better management couple tweaks food solid restaurant but now just huge disappointment  <EOR> I ate 4 a m  completely famished hard say good food because let's face when you're starving everything tastes good    I ordered egg white veggie scramble toast  came some blueberry preserves little slice heaven  Aside preserves everything else just good wasn't greasy least  say couple eggs took FOREVER food arrive perhaps hunger talking  <EOR> We decided whim salad before attending Mariah Carey concert later evening  vaguely remembered LV Restaurant Week starting day arriving Vegas  did piqued interest when saw coincidental time initially said In! right away  changed back Sounds Cool trouble seeing any details online    Well once seated saw menu it! Thirty dollars per person within reason plus birthday Eve! instantly decided it  asked waiter if both order simultaneously he said no  Hubby Asian chicken salad which light quite flavorful   He also received bread butter salad   My watermelon salad quite tasty unique way plus also contained pistachios  watermelon itself sweet  Yay  always plus!!! salmon entree appeared immediately initial salad  way better expected  Salmon cooked perfection undercooked  Skin left top crunchy  gave portion husband enjoys that  Underneath crushed peas fingerling potatoes  Everything delish!  While still eating salmon entree obviously eat slow because came creme brûlée dessert  Oh my! dessert heaven made birthday even more special bc divine! extremely satisfied  should come back tomorrow? debating remember indecisive Gemini??? LOL <EOR> Again great looking place    Bad design way waitress waiter needs travel good 500 feet table   Descent prices until portions huge plates tiny cup size centers !!!   Salad stale lettuce did use practice lettuce before opening doors private party week before    Poor waitress agreed shortfalls   Had steak salad  steak came separate plate burned side   Did remove off tab   faux pas cause its new place almost three years build City Center could hired trained staff cook better   Sorry Aria    <EOR> Please call Ceviche Peruvian !! even close!! sadly bad custumer service lack knowledge! overpriced no reason! <EOR> This place pretty decent food selection quality but nothing wow  would say only 2 steps ahead cafeteria  Though pricey pricier  should be   Good place casual lunch  Especially most fine dining Aria does open until 5pm <EOR> This actually favorite spots breakfast Vegas ever since Aria opened  really good food beautiful setting along traditionally superb service Vegas restaurant but fraction price most fancy restaurants strip cost you   On most recent trip cinnamon french toast nothing short AMAZING  am also fan steak eggs    My wife biscuits bowl fruit avocado olive oil sea salt chives charred lemon  Everything fantastic    Highly recommend spot if want experience great food offered Vegas but without insane price  No cheap any means but good deal <EOR> We sat down late night very few people restaurant  Ordered meal three other couples sat down  all food before us  When asked waiter  He said dropped wife's plate  15 minutes later food sandwich very tuff over cooked  Manage did much fix problem  Ended paying way over cost meal  would avoid place  <EOR> I didn't plan coming but needed eat something quick since already Aria  Don't wanna drink empty stomach yannoe?  This place way big considered cafe  pretty high end cafe  big overwhelming pretty dead Saturday evening  Service pretty slow but staff very friendly  give them one   I ordered Rigatoni Pasta  Wasn't worth $20  Tasted like   Chef Boyardee something  gave complimentary breads   cold little stale? Oh well complimentary reason guess but good bread munch on  Wouldn't come back again  <EOR> My boyfriend came quick bite only tomato soup but delicious boyfriend steak eggs toast hash browns  EVERYTHING great  waiter Powers he little slow really understand why restaurant did look busy think he only 3 table total including ours knows  Overall would come back here  <EOR> ATMOSPHERE 3 4 Stars Very open west view  lucky u shaped booth cozy relaxed dining  SERVICE 4 Stars very attentive waiter   also two other employees check   FOOD 3 Stars Chicken tortilla soup Yummy just right spice level nice thick beans corn yes real chicken!

Kind tucked away passed entrance twice before noticed sign  <EOR> I usually come every time visit Vegas because breakfast simple  usually order fruit platter side yogurt parfait  Today unfortunately eating way through half fruit discovered grapes fuzzy mold  waitress snatched plate away still forced pay half bill deal stomach ache all day  Unfortunately won't returning  <EOR> Aria Cafe new improved Cafe Vettro   really no idea why changed name place when everything place exactly same   Whatever   Aria Cafe 24 hour eatery your standard eats   would only come late night eats!  There's many late night 24 hour eateries Strip   food pricier side   watermelon juice lox bagel fetched pretty pricey bill considering nothing ate actually cooked warmed     Regardless convenience having 24 hour restaurant does work nicely when you're drunk tired clubbing just need some food soak booze   Wish wait staff more personality but hey I'd probably sick tired drunks tourists too! <EOR> BY FAR worst breakfast ever Vegas!  Firstly waited hostess desk 5 minutes without being greeted we only ones line Dec24th approx 9am    Finally very pregnant gal came seated us   Turns she also waitress  She very sweet very hungry   husband played safe ordered french toast side bacon orange juice coffee  I ordered ultimate omelette  with shrimp spinach goat cheese water  It took 25 minutes breakfast  my husband joked them chasing chickens back eggs because took long such simple order  When food arrived stated french toast side bacon no bells whistles   ok bacon cooked all way thru  My omelette came hash browns molded into discs almost shape ramekin   COLD horribly greasy  Working food industry know institutional food shapes bought way simply deep fried left sit   mine unfortunately waaay long    My omelette ok nothing fancy $18 ticket price   Halfway through something omelette smelled little off couldn't figure out   nausea tummy ache rest day indicated something obviously turned perhaps beyond date  The coffee ok orange juice fresh institutionalized box $6 small glass  My beef whole experience  you're listed 5 star hotel 5 star price serve 5 star food!!! least please let food hot when arrives your best your guests ill  First time last time lesson learned  <EOR> Food good but little overpriced  Especially alcoholic drinks  Stick just food  Bloody Mary salty and salt small $17  Would eat again if wasn't another option available    Pros open 24hrs  good quality food  Cons over priced not big menu <EOR> Any place 24 hrs automatically receives great kudos me  all convenience if you're 24 7 then good  spending whole day swimming Vdara little group starving  needed something filling nothing took long nothing rageously expensive  Aria lot pricey options some places just dressed right for  bf great call when he said let's just café  didn't expect great but caught surprise  Service good décor vibe place awesome  All three ordered steak eggs came pretty quick  wasn't best steak eggs world but pretty damn good  $25 vegas Aria thought worth it  would definitely recommend anyone looking place 24 hrs day quick snack  lunch  <EOR> Not worth trip Aria  I eat whenever am hungry which every 4 hours around clock  Thus end eating places 2 30 morning    The Yelp description boasts largest 24 7 cafe Las Vegas  seems more half place unused while hungry patrons wait line seated  skip part line M life card which cool    They offer only limited late night menu  standard patty melt club sandwich  good edible but worth coming all way Aria for    I saw another table enjoying calamari which looked delicious    The patrons ranged families kids enjoying late night bite partiers looking sober up    Go Grand Luxe Cafe Venetian instead  Even cab ride over more affordable much much tastier more variety  <EOR> Strolling around Aria finding quick cheap meal isn't easy  stumbled upon Aria Cafe took look menu decided best bet   Your initial thought super open there's tons sunlight coming all windows  Love part   The service surprisingly lot better expected  perfectly honest thought place didn't stand chance  assumed over priced eat because we are in Aria restaurant  all know happens when assume ass me  Har har    Deuces Wild $17 So much food pretty impressed if finished entire meal  two eggs two pancakes two sausages two pieces bacon 3 hash brown patties 2 pieces toast  Right??? food good  Nice hearty breakfast ridiculously priced   Sure cheaper food Dennys IHOP but enjoyed it  I'd definitely come back  <EOR> I breakfast twice during stay Aria  Gorgeous decoration design sure rest hotel complex  However service quite slow food temperature cold two meals  Pricey served  breakfast Buffet better deal  would dinner but lunch could option  <EOR> Breakfast while stayed Aria  Prices fair  Service prompt   It wasn't amazing but filled tummy didn't kill wallet  If wasn't guest hotel never would considered dining however  <EOR> $20 burgers really shouldn't twenty dollar burgers! I while staying Vdara since only thing open close 3AM   am doing 3AM? Well lubricated hungry trying remain upright   I did enjoy fact space open   didn't feel restaurant   more open cafe feel it   Service great   lack stars price matches ambience but food choices quality not  <EOR> Like everything else Aria Cafe Vettro impressive modern decor upon first glance  loved dark solid wood tables booths  Those only things loved    The food satisfactory  bad great  little overpriced cafe food but guess you're paying atmosphere Vegas it    The service mediocre best  When arrived early dinner restaurant nowhere near full  group convention all day hadn't eaten anything everyone starving  ordered salad nachos meatloaf sandwich   four items took half hour come out  While waited noticed waitress station nearby bringing baskets bread all tables  asked waiter why hadn't gotten any bread he informed needed request it  Really? Since when bread butter something need request why did every table but ours?   My husband ordered spicy Bloody Mary which came no garnish even straw  wasn't any better more spicy Bloody Mary you'd drink casino bar    The food was    food  nothing complain nothing rave about  Cafe Vettro gets job done but don't come looking great food impeccable service  <EOR> The food decent albeit bit overpriced  atmosphere fantastic though if seated left entrance evening then find your dining experience incredibly loud obnoxious result bar club live music literally 50 feet away  Also bathroom doors weird look another part wall   If you're drunk can't decide group then because diverse range menu options  Meh  <EOR> Drove Vegas wanted somewhere quick good eat  Made way over cafe  patty melt  ok patty little dry  fries very good but couldn't patty melt     Service slow  Took while refills check    Might come back if we're hungry but top choice  <EOR> I keep going because OK environment baby when want shop Aria   But ugh every time wait long food never great always freezing   Why keep going back?  no buffet during week  <EOR> I came dinner night don't think yelp always right  enjoyed place here's why    The sandwiches chili good here  think club pretty good but can't really mess that  fries excellent though also special sweet potato fries great! cornbread chili terrible  Service average but least food comped  would come back try other things    Watch bathroom doors hard open heavy! Also hard see where optical illusion! sinks little tricky faucet automatic but soap not? wth? no paper towels? <EOR> Expensive but decent size portions tasted great very vegan unfriendly impossible though   Service slow now very friendly   Cafe itself once inside beautiful probably best part experience  <EOR> I don't know why place such terrible reviews since late breakfast afternoon during stay yes said afternoon Vegas people fantastic experience  both woke around noon wanting breakfast pleased see café all day breakfast menu  slightly more limited full breakfast but when mentioned really wanted French Toast waitress kind enough run back kitchen see if cooks would even though wasn't all day breakfast menu  agreed happy camper  hubby steak eggs which huge meal he said really good  both loved food service stellar  also really enjoyed all sunlight streaming huge floor ceiling windows  Even though face front entrance Aria restaurant positioned such way flowers shrubbery eye level rather staring taxi line your eyes drawn upward glass buildings skyline strip  Overall pretty relaxing pleasant experience  definitely back Café next time stay Aria especially since buffet breakfast day before pretty bad  <EOR> Went 3 day weekend mini vacation  But came back frustrated tired And disbelief  Over priced served come 11pm pay same menu few $ more In All menu items  Non marked healthy gluten free  This Coffee shop all food cooked fried poached but gluten free Including salads French fries Mexican food etc  All some kind flour dairy nuts name but gluten free For minute overjoyed ordered soup 2 minute later waiter stopped eating     rou flour butter      And waiter tried push sell fried chicken grilled but when checked if marinated dipped guess gluten      On other hand buffet lots choices gluten free But having set Menu similar everyday old easy   we tried breakfast lunch brunch dinner price different but selection gluten dairy nuts free    buffet recommended its vegan vegetarian some gluten free dishes   Lesson learn read watch tv shows any cooking books read know made off before even asking    <EOR> Lets remember place Cafe meant quick fix upscale eatery  being said very modern nice  lot done real fast  When order room service Aria where food comes from   We came just before checked hungry  Everything pretty good just above would consider mediocre Aria  prices OK especially if Aria paying The portions pretty big fresh bread amazing  menu little bit little bit that  steak eggs pretty good corn beef hash  favorite wings very well seasoned cooked perfection   I probably wont much due fact all amazing eats Aria offers  being said real good room service food  <EOR> Chicken donut must don't forget red velvet pancakes!
