We sat upstairs first visit   My second visit family  I wanted show them beautiful good food!  My mom's sucker views   I noticed many restaurants closing down inside hotel really hope place stays open  It might possibly because prices somewhat reasonable good range starts low high  I really wanted try N9NE but heard closed Alize gone too  RIP  <EOR> Had another AMAZING dinner Nove Italiano tonight   It date night meeting another couple   also first time seated area back restaurant awesome view strip   I started Pimmp's cup Pimm's Hendrick's gin cucumber strawberry apple    refreshing sweet but don't think ordering again any time soon   We decided eat everything family style pretty much order bunch food  just share   We house made salumi calamari fried squash blossoms shrimp francaise  nice try 4 5 different cured meats sausages salumi platter  Calamari served hot peppers fresh grated parm splash lemon   squash blossoms stuffed diced zucchini king crab then battered fried served nice lemon butter sauce nice change traditional ricotta filling   shrimp francaise yummy dipped nice egg batter pan fried i think similar if same lemon butter sauce   Chef sent some nice individual Caesar salads whole hearts romaine dressed light almost lemony Caesar dressing couple garlicky parmesan croutons  Delicious   For main course shared balsamic rib eye whole sea bass osso bucco risotto English peas Polenta asparagus sides   We ordered rib eye medium grilled perfection   marinate steaks olive oil garlic herbs before grilling them   tanginess balsamic vinegar complimented rich fatty ribeye well  2 3 slices plenty me   The sea bass served whole skeleton bones removed table side tasty served nice salsa verde   wasn't really fishy mood though   The osso bucco good   tender fallen off bone able cut through spoon   loved risotto peas served with    don't usually risotto but creamy rich perfectly cooked hard mushy   The polenta rich delicious served topped ragout meat sauce shaved parmesan   The asparagus grilled I think topped fried egg   good when pop yolk let drip all over place   I'm new whole wine thing can't properly describe or remember wines had   know red Italian white which bit bubble it thought sparkling wine flat nice dessert wine santo vino vino santo    said new also round Espresso shots some sort sweet creamy almost caramelly shot   DESSERT main event book My boyfriend LOVES cheesecake but bit heavy super rich meal   delicious though   Made mascarpone actual cheesecake frosted mascarpone cream kind butter cookie crust place traditional graham cracker   My favorite Strawberry Carpaccio   Thin sliced strawberries artfully arranged drizzled balsamic reduction topped toasted panko served scoop creme fraiche sorbet   Light refreshing delicious   Our friend ordered chocolate bread which heard stories but always forget order   Crusty grilled Italian bread white chocolate hazelnuts served generous quinelle dark chocolate ganache drizzled olive oil sprinkled sea salt   may sound odd some but trust works   delicious    Bottom Line It may pricey some but OMG worth it   boyfriend rarely date night without daughter but maybe 2 3 last ones Nove we brought daughter once no problems all just decided tonight food view service   All amazing  <EOR> High 51st floor boasts spectacular view city   fairly late all tables beside windows taken already   Upscale classical decor great variety dishes fairly romantic definitely place take your date to   vibe Nove little more upbeat traditional French decor Alize   see younger crowd Nove then Alize     The food unexpectedly pleasing well done   fierce competitive high end dining industry Vegas Nove probably typical first choice lot tourists however I'd recommend trying enjoy glitz city never sleeps some great food wine  <EOR> The idea Nove exciting high end Italian restaurant 51st floor view   Sounds great   But when took look Yelp reviews came across being kind hit miss   turns both those things true   The room very nicely appointed view great although strangely room situated maximize view Strip   view Alize the other Palms view restaurant better     The food better least more consistent   started lobster bisque which okay but rather strongly flavored taste   entree Veal Milanese   veal itself tender tasty but breading over fried detracted dish   Death Potatoes side though fantastic fluffy whipped potatoes mixed bacon I guess actually pancetta but tasted bacon mascarpone   could eat entree if back   wife really Caprese salad Lobster Mezzaluna     There also lot little things detracted dining experience   drinks stingy pour oddly scotch rocks did come rocks but rather came neat glass ice side   never seen restaurant before don't quite point   bread plate consisted various flavors foccacia bread but served without butter olive oil   expect would brought some if asked but again strange   Yelp warned very clear didn't want bottled water dodged bullet   Service acceptable but great   server Ernest friendly but pretty sure answers some questions inaccurate   Everything served timely good   But when check came all mixed up   Half listed reflected things ordered but other half seemed order some other table   time ready leave didn't want sit around while staff tried unscramble mistake total probably would come same just paid was   Still  pretty sloppy stuff   I struck fact room pretty empty   51st floor Palms Hotel could devoted half dozen penthouse suites would $5 000 night more found myself wondering long could keep space half empty restaurant  <EOR> We Thursday right when opened 5 30pm entire place ourselves   Very romantic   Sat window stellar view strip   service food excellent   Started Shrimp Francaise   best shrimp dish ever just advertised menu    couldn't decide between lobster ravioli risotto waiter offered give half plate each   the risotto even showed scallops which expected    Awesome experience all around! <EOR> We hungry 9 45pm last night  We sat bar Nove dinner split meatballs as appetizer sides portion menu   Each Caesar salad split Chicken Marsala  It very good  Eddie bartender delightful made perfect martini  having and sharing dinner when sit bar  Oh yes great view restaurant section  <EOR> I happy establishment  Originally dinner Nine Steakhouse  However due forces could control i e  hostess error incompetence reservations listed thus sent Nove  Although Nove attempted live reputation Nine however failed     completely   redeeming quality wine storage facility   pretty  changed colors    many times  <EOR> Gorgeous views    beautifully decorated dining room    wonderful staff   AMAZING food!!! <EOR> So ended place because arrived late evening Vegas Friday wanted clubbing Palms   Since eat before everything closed decided best way concierge find place Palms table service club hotel   Anyway when told place expecting overpriced although worthwhile convenience mediocre food   Admittedly bit surprised   restaurant high towers Palms great views Strip city good start   food all pretty good   ravioli but tried items friends ordered including tortelini sea bass bone in fillet steak   Everything really tasty mediocre expectation shattered   still bit overpriced dishes running $25 45 but satisfied meal   worth atmosphere if you're looking splurge bit  <EOR> Nothing but amazing things say Nove! may off strip but WELL worth drive $15 cab ride there!  This review ridiculously overdue but really wanted leave since food service BEYOND amazing!

Third asked waiter particular wine waiter gave completely incorrect description it   When later asked sommelier sommelier flatly contradicted waiter's description describing wine correctly   But means meanwhile stuck expensive bottle wine didn't suit   The food itself good but mistakes distractions throughout evening which meal could recover  <EOR> I am being generous three star review very disappointed service Nove  resident Vegas having other upscale restaurants many casinos surprised bad experience    Last night dinner mom's 73rd birthday tickets 8 pm show Pearl    I coupon $25 off $75 last night only made 6 45 reservation could o off work still time enjoy full service meal before show   arrived NOVE 6 22 checked time because knew early hoped maybe could seated early     We checked told could wait bar would come   waited until 7 05 before approaching desk seated yet even told running late    told next    7 10 seated    waiter came take drink orders told since show pasta best choice would fastest  chose skip appetizers pasta dishes skip desserts time ordered food 7 45 ate quickly asked check when food arrived could eat run  just made show time    What planned treat mom turned quick meal pasta ok but impressive enough way again     On Friday night show coupon going ticket holders should reservations can't accommodate !
