Great food great service  Food This place really consistent solid pizza  If you're mood pizza hesitate all head Grimaldi's  Probably some best classic pizzas you'll have  <EOR> This pizza best ever eaten   girlfriend said same thing  <EOR> I've another Grimaldi's disappointment  First off why hardcore full court press sell buy wine salads something bar? If wanted any those items simply would've ordered them  asked once order items but twice  pizza joint yet really felt going Olive Garden where pressured buy appetizer cocktail dessert order jack bill  Ridiculous    Now pizza   pizza mediocre best certainly snuff other Grimaldi's location too  Ordered large sausage pie but really light sauce cheese  actually sauce all over pie cheese well but cook just drizzled sauce then filled gaps cheese  other words entire pizza covered sauce cheese  Also usually put decent amount fresh basil pizzas but time  Maybe two small pieces basil entire large pie? Very disappointing result wife back location    I guess pay couple bucks more tryout Dom Demarco's across town  wife did order homemade tiramasu she said pretty good  5 dollars  1 other strange thing even know sit down restaurant does bathrooms??? also pretty serious turn off us  <EOR> As soon walked immediately hit we're mall anymore feeling red white checkered tablecloths small bar corner photos showcasing different areas New York  vibe cozy laid back almost forget mall    The service exceptional server very friendly soon she found Grimaldi's newbie she gave helpful breakdown menu gave plenty time decide    As food create your own pizza creation! options classic red personal white garlic no sauce but comes extra cheese yay pesto base  Sizes are personal small 16 inch large 18 inch   rest aka toppings? friend entirely you! choose minimalist big whatever toppings would like  ended getting classic red Italian sausage garlic mushroom green peppers  Since NY style pizza thinner crust wait wasn't long all before knew beloved creation came! Even just looking pizza tell made lot love perfect topping ratio  taste test DELICIOUS! <EOR> Service great pizza tasty appealing  Can't wrong good Caesar Salad brick oven pizza made fresh ingredients toasted perfection! <EOR> The place looks very interesting just ordered personal am waiting excitement!!!!

Honestly far best pizza EVER had! Ordered pepperoni pizza same perfection  cheese just melts your mouth isn't cheesy over powering  back! <EOR> My husband visiting Vegas  college reunion friends past weekend  girls organized dinner restaurant since all experienced real first Grimaldi's NYC Friday evening 8 30 pm   Since all Grimaldi's before in Brooklyn wasn't anything new exciting  more we're checking place see if tastes same?  My husband ordered large pizza almost couldn't finish! toppings pepperoni mushroom anchovies extra basil  YUM huge good  good remembered when real thing Brooklyn 5 years ago but worked  hungry since dinner late   We also ordered small mediterranean salad $8 feeds 2 refreshing good way couple pizza  total bill $32 pizza + salad  Quality pizza good food but probably wouldn't come back again  <EOR> Does anybody else think weird Italian restaurant inside mall?  between going location Palazzo one   I instead thinking would less wait plus closer hotel   no wait   service great   our server very knowledgeable pizza history Grimaldi's   pizza good   But friend told b c she said best pizza she's ever had   wouldn't far   but good  <EOR> Solid Margherita Pizza nice prompt friendly service right fashion show  didn't original Grimaldi's Pizza location NYC looking something Vegas decided give place go  turns owned cousins original Grimaldi's split off opened one  server told use same dough sauce recipe but expanded menu  own desserts including cheese cake selection wine cocktails well some salads  enjoyed simple Marg pizza  plenty topping options for additional $2 $5 each could easily build your own $50 pizza! kept simple which worked well thin NYC style crust  hard time believing Grimaldi's equals NYC location lines days enjoyed pizza but enough wait hours it! most other things Vegas imitation rarely good original! <EOR> I ordered regular pizza basil kept simple because wanted see pie tasted without other ingredients getting way also adding extra ingredients outrageous  made mistake ordering basil cooked into pizza per recommendation  dough fine but once hit crust extremely hard chew mozzarella plastic consistency tomato sauce didn't much flavor  Overall decent pizza but many small important details overlooked  <EOR> You Grimaldi's!  perfect amount sauce fresh mozzarella   NOM NOM!!!!!!! <EOR> i love grimaldi's but location isn't good   kale salad small margherita   pizza grimaldi's usually super crispy but not   also don't baked pizza w basil basil burnt   shouldn't placed pizza take oven? <EOR> Pizzas calzones salads all very taste  the place typical Italian pizzeria very cozy    <EOR> The only reason why giving Place  Three stars because  hostess rubbed wrong way  other Restaurants usually  hostess Very welcoming !!  felt She having bad Day just hates job   Super unwelcoming but foods great !!! <EOR> I always rated all visits Grimaldis 5 stars  instance Thanksgiving 2017 give 3 stars  Nothing fatal just pizza did come piping hot crispy other times  Vegas staple though back Venetian  <EOR> Staff nice pizza came very quickly  Sauce OK everything seemed very fresh   crust hand tossed thin crust New York pizza the original New York   all said good but nothing crazy great  would eat again no complaints but don't think would ever crave it   meatball mushroom pie  2 star rating meant dig but just didn't think anything special  can't believe really best pizza New York claim  <EOR> It's better Secret Pizza which why 4 stars would've unfair give them 3 although argument probably made that   But based prices fact Fashion Show Mall don't think I'd recommend going anywhere else bite   Forget food court overflowing 2 star options   There's Neiman Marcus its own restaurant places Maggianos Capital Grille but those obviously different price range totally different experience   Here personal pizza 12 inches starts $9 price point then couple bucks depending toppings add   think size could actually shared among 2 people if wanted to   thin saucy portion cheese crispy crust well balanced   It's cute little place sat bar but looked around brick walls fireplace all photos course red white checkered tablecloths   just some impersonal generic pizza joint mall   When think Grimaldi point forward instead Morocon royalty instantly coming mind think just likely thinking some pizza  <EOR> If looking good pizza want avoid high prices if LV Strip place you   located Mall across Trump Hotel   crust perfect!  Crispy perfect blend chewiness  won't disappointed! <EOR> Omg garden pizza die talk delicious coming back wifey  <EOR> Great pizza food  Love eating here   staff always great      except one  Teresa!

The crust pizza tad burnt  didn't bad but I'd prefer normal  dad however burnt bread type person he actually preferred way  each own! If cooked longer then you'll pizza here  Taste decent enough waiter nice  Checked every once while made sure doing alright    While place isn't bad wasn't anything stand place  your typical American Italian style pizzeria red checkered look lot them have  cozy little chain restaurant  enjoyed time wouldn't mind coming back if chance invited friend craving pizza while shopping  <EOR> What kind ex Brooklynite would came Sin City but didn't check place out?

We wanted Grimaldi's early dinner allow plenty time Kevin Burke's one man comedy Defending Caveman Harrah's walked into restaurant just 5   atmosphere convivial warm very New York Vegas sort way checkered tablecloths lots brick      Grimaldi's pizzas coal fired ovens   Why?  say pizza Calzones baked signature coal burning oven offers crisp crust unique flavor just possible using gas convection wood burning ovens handmade mozzarella fresh ingredients 'secret recipe' dough pizza sauce them most award winning pizzeria United States   Quite hype Carboholic's Delights serve Grimaldi's stand it?  find ordered personal coal fired NY pizza Italian sausage pepperoni garlic  Also Calzone pesto sun dried tomatoes mushrooms   Grimaldi's menu lacks any non veggie starters given pizza doesn't take very long cook  show stopper but sure wouldn't hurt if added garlic bread Bruschetta those eat carbs while wait carbs     We didn't wait long food but still very eager try mine!   Grimaldi's original venue built underneath Brooklyn Bridge long before personal Escape New York but never heard until recently made several decades overdue first Grimaldi's fix   Saving assumed would best last started Calzone   Ricotta cheese default Grimaldi's Calzone smooth creamy delicious!  Given over again next time include sausage but taste Thing carb intensive Beauty wonderfully balanced even without meat don't think ever tasted Calzone good!  Moving meat matter let's talk Grimaldi's pizza!  Unlike lot NY pizzerias Grimaldi's sells only whole pies no single slices available   surprised when saw thickness crust close personal money distinctly thinner traditional NY Pizza quite Neapolitan but getting pretty close   thin little concerned pizza's ability stand under another meat topping extra cheese just two meat toppings garlic no problems independent suspension first second slices   slight issue friend's third but nothing major   What did taste like?  scent basil leaf added enticingly pizza's delicious aroma took bite sauce yielded burst fresh tomato flavor cheese exquisite!  shredded pure white fresh mozzarella cheese melted surface into nice thick chewy texture   crust slightly charred coal fired ovens crisp chewy flavors sauce pools cheese toppings blended into deliciously satisfying pizza experience!

I love NY style pizza  love Costco pizza  love deep dish pizza  just love pizza general craving it  just great timing since way back car   Got large pesto pizza pepperoni mushrooms  delicious! fed three people comfortably but think should've ordered large salad split well  Portions HUGE  If really wanted small salad big enough meal itself  just wanted more pizza since delicious stomach didn't know if full not    Service little slow side but notice each pizza order most wait time definitely because cooking  never see your order sitting counter  <EOR> I've hearing Grimaldi's since moved two years ago but just finally check week when doing little shopping Fashion Show Mall   big fan New York style pizza super excited try place everyone told must have       Must forgotten flavor more it   We ordered pie spicy chicken sausage black olives mushrooms Mediterranean salad grilled chicken   pizza insanely bland   sauce really lacking flavor spice salt moreover whole thing just kind tasted bread honest   Here's did RIGHT crust although flavor just okay PERFECT amount crunchy    crunchy outside soft inside structural integrity hold toppings   spicy chicken sausage salad both good but didn't compensate overall lack flavor pizza   My advice?  Secret Pizza Cosmo   Best NY style pizza Vegas without doubt  <EOR> I work Pandora boss ordered 3 pies today store   When pick them spoke Toni manager did order   told boss ordered Toni explained bartender took order did place correctly pizzas sold other customers   She then told she would them house deliver them store   Toni gracious apologetic pizza well worth wait   She all manager should be she explained happened made sure follow staff order perfect timely   boss both very impressed Toni management skills   Keep good work! <EOR> Server nice knowledgeable regarding menu company  nice nowadays see employee take pride job  ordered beer wine small Cesear salad start  croutons amazing! also ordered small pizza pepperoni onions peppers sausage  Small perfect amount share  pay per topping but thin crust NY style pizza  don't need many toppings  fatty's also blueberry cheesecake   great!!  Only downfall place mall but imagine works best business caters tourists  <EOR> I'm New York can't speak authenticity but am pizza lover talk about  crust very thin crispy delicious  variety toppings built own onion garlic spinach jalapeno Italian sausage   toppings OK but sauce crust it  large 18 came @ $30 which bit pricey but having many chances eat pizza quality HI definitely worth it  would definitely come back if didn't fly 6 hours it  <EOR> Being New York albeit never having eaten original Grimaldi's little skeptical would Vegas but did disappoint  pizza delicious hot  classic margarita without fresh tomatoes top mouth watering  Perfect ratio cheese sauce  also tried Greek type salad which very good fresh  Lettuce extremely crispy! Great option especially if you're dining kids  <EOR> 2 stars service  5 stars address mistakes  3 stars pizza    My elite friends wanted try right before left Vegas  NYC supposedly use NYC water here  willing give shot  still dream NYC pizza 4 years visit I couldn't eat California pizza 6 months afterward just made angry little skeptical anything far east coast    It's small restaurant inside mall gets crowded quickly  party 7  see fashion shows restaurant   We ordered large white pizza large pesto large meat pizza along large Caesar salad  salad perfect  health conscious amount dressing used but perfect  started bringing small pizzas  told server ordered 3 larges since pizzas took long manager told ahead keep them house would bring larges  3 large pizzas more enough alone feed table much extra pizza  also accidentally brought extra large meat pizza but told keep well!  I wish rest visit just great  Before pizzas dropped off completely ignored  ask three times another beer because forgotten empty water glasses etc  Maybe could somehow tell much beer over weekend didn't need anymore but still!

Now let third bold one    #3 food good missed tiny portion order but aside waitress decided rush while we're still eating gave check saying NO RUSH even offered box pizza WHILE still eating  even common??? Talk being NO RUSH!!! fucking joke! #4 Well ended eating more slice husband paid bill walked discovered bit line! Know what?

Love crust perfect crunch soft  chewy inside   Service wonderful two different managers kept going around asking each table if everything's okay which awesome!

If server named Jilani beware!! may want ask someone else  usually don't name employees gave bad service reviews but guy made angry! came Sunday afternoon  perfect timing because just missed lunch rush wasn't crowded  hostess showed table waited 15 minutes until server finally showed up  annoyed another couple sitting right next arrived did  Yet serviced Jilani first  few minutes later overheard hostess telling came first waiting while  Thank actually noticing  He obviously sucks keeping track tables  Finally he stops table  No Hello  Welcome just would order? pretty much didn't see until paying bill  Other servers much more friendly brought drinks food  2 starts them! Jilani did care check while eating nor did he offer refill drinks  done waited another 15 minutes until he finally showed again asked want box that? No going spend rest day staring 3 slices leftover pizza  think?! few minutes later he dropped off pizza bill without saying word  don't even know why left tip  Although much less would left good server    Food 4 Stars  Not best tasting pizza eaten but still pretty good  don't know if came off day but pepperoni pizza bit salty  crispy thin crust fresh ingredients  Although once while cheese would completely fall off slice   If sign VIP newsletter through website coupon $5 off your next bill  also give free pizza your birthday   Hoping better service next time around! <EOR> The short it food average service good average prices restaurant strange mildew smell inside Palazzo hotel  The long it Bland bland bland! wanted more flavor kept adding salt parmesan cheese food  Definitely disappointing! Secret pizza Cosmo way better place   started Caprese salad which huge btw  definitely good two  don't season all kind just yourself balsamic vinegar oil salt pepper  pizza let half marinara half white  Definitely thought white pizza lacking garlic flavor cheese use bit rubbery  type cheese where nice stretch pull pull   know mean??? Ugh overall would come back  I'd rather Papa John's pizza  <EOR> I'm little biased since ate Brooklyn NY  deserves 3 5 scale 4 level if flavor turned just slightly pizza pie  flavor sausage pizza mushroom fell little flat  wanted pizza beer least over all being located inside mall pricing bad  Service good atmosphere pleasant wasn't NY but settle  <EOR>
