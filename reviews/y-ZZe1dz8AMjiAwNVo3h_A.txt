The fryers turned off   Don't close 9?

I tried lot places soho jaburritos  sure if place gets better  tacos displays though         Right now location looks busy but  because don't sushi burritos places around all  should try other places then you'll know difference  <EOR> The thing hate most when dining bad customer service slow customer service just your job people!! understand new restaurants takes some time work kinks but seriously management did train people hired them?! 5 people working no but friend restaurant still took ridiculous amount time tacos burrito  think guy spent 5 minutes trying put rice tacos watching rice stick glove  almost walked ate somewhere else    burritos tacos good but nothing better any other sushi burrito bowl place around town but wrap job burrito definitely needs some work   All all think place potential but definitely worth drive if don't live nearby   probably going wait 6 months try place again then  Hopefully then employees figure properly wrap burritos speed things bit   UPDATE I came back before said would 6 months thought maybe if give month better  NOPE only restaurant still took 15 minutes sushi burrito! HOW!?? <EOR> So good! Great food great service! love spicy tuna spicy crab good too! <EOR> Been few times fill poke craving   Fresh fish yummy combos would totally recommend sushi burritos bowls ! <EOR> I expecting much more flavourful food but everything quite bland  presentation advertise online nothing receive store  Pineapple Express just kind thrown together bowl just topped bits pineapple weren't quite ripe yet  staff extremely slow wasn't another customer store  sauces pretty good  food seems reasonably fresh  chunks fish meat really large chunks which difficult eat poke bowl because pull them apart unless want just five huge bites fish  <EOR> I greatly disappointed Shrimp Tempest  looking forward trying place weeks but feel just waste money   The Shrimp tempura looked plump juicy while he making it  When actually ate almost no shrimp meat dry jerky  wish more shrimp price pay tiny wrap  wasn't much flavor wrap general  More sauce s would perfect more flavor  Lastly romaine lettuce weird texture rest wrap  didn't seem cohesive rest ingredients just fell wrap anyways   I want give place another try try something else but Shrimp Tempest left lot desired  <EOR> Pretty good place! People very patient order since didnt know but portion size good esp large much meat some toppings no extra charge which like  Cute place pictures your food 'Gram <EOR> This favorite poke place  give plenty options very good amount fresh fish!  Delicious worth money!   5 stars! <EOR> Fantastic quality  Considering you're paying $11+ meal surely expected   make your own bowl pineapple addition   tip pineapple waste   might instagram worthy but adds no additional flavor edge pineapple impossible off eat just cooler looking bowl $2   thing bout Tail Fin don't skimp toppings protein   base make your own option 4 portions any meat all toppings world   sample 4 meats albacore spicy tuna spicy crab salmon   All fresh spicy tuna being favorite   Generous portions protein complimented tons veggies lettuce edamame carrot fish eggs   meal delicious especially topped some spicy sauce though definitely mild    Another tip throw some ginger wasabi more Japanese   Though many option fishy more sushi based anyone opportunity come something chicken veggie options offered well   The service extremely slow only person front quick process many options unfamiliarity ordering process ingredients most patrons   person behind counter nice enough recommend most popular sauces proteins slow pace really only complaint meal ordering process   Tail Fin worth money nice fast casual healthy lunch every once while   think best town tried   Though poke sushi burrito fad may away think Tail Fin stay  <EOR> The portions small sauces very tasty meat did look very appealing cut meat looked butched  ahi tuna did hold square shape well mushy whitish  service below average sushi burrito places  nice but overly helpful people may new cuisine  don't believe greeted walked in  Stick sweet poke soho  <EOR> I try sushi tacos  think great fun idea especially people love Instagram food  However harder messier eat  Maybe  just me  also doesn't fill much even if 4 6 sushi tacos    It's better just poke bowl   But if prefer variety then tacos  employees suggested try mangos toppings sushi tacos  best suggestion ever!
