Looking forward next reason dine there  <EOR> Excellent food good atmosphere great service!  waiter very attentive but overly so  <EOR> Food good  mom's birthday    Service however fine non existent worse    Went almost thirty minutes without server Ashley seeing us  During time drinks oil hot bubbling popping enough blob hot oil burned finger while clear back near plate    What did server do? Nothing    She nowhere found  called she did come called hostess seated come turn down oil  She kindly did brought refills apologized   When Ashley finally showed back told happened without apology first utterance correct tell hostess hostess but actually manager  She then explain she assigned another table clear other side restaurant    After she disappeared again while manager hostess came back mom suggested consider placement tables single server bit closer together  manager explain purpose don't hear all explanations over over new people seated around you  mentioned consequence instance almost thirty minutes without any service  listen several more excuses such staff based number reservations high number walk in customers night etc  She asked she could visit more enjoyable isn't YOUR job know    given restaurants service industry manager? Ashley seemed pretty mad  She dropped off dessert table effectively giving silent treatment    No explanations any bite sized desserts any usual pleasantries  She provided only caution when level chocolate gets low might extra hot then ran off    The bottom line? Expect same good Melting Pot food would other locations     Just same good Melting Pot service  paid over hundred dollars dinner two left own devices pot hot oil listen laundry list excuses why service sucked    And perhaps most importantly    Don't roll dice place special occasion  Awful service certainly put damper someone's birthday! spent whole ride home trying mind off it  <EOR> So first time trying place seen Yelp thought would cool different experience  reservations anniversary  also called change reservation time 15 minutes later then arrived original time    didn't give any problems timing sat right away  Since anniversary say quiet corner which very nice  greeted very nice waitress name Angelica  4 course meal which suggest everyone gets because u most your money experience cheese appetizer Wisconsin trio  prepare right front u  amazing  Then salads where only issue came into play   Cesar salad plate smelled fishy  husbands well  told Angelica she said most likely anchovies Cesar salad  made sense me    next course which main course    land sea he steak lovers  But same issue plates happened again even steak lovers  smelled wet dog      food very good nothing tasted tainted anything   greeted believe manager said he sorry salads then told smell plates he agreed plates smelled bad said taking care problem rehashing everything  He also checked again during meal explained he comped salads round drinks something else anyways huge part bill comped dessert plates smelled normal  yin yang great finish  Before manager came would returned however did everything things right  <EOR> TYLER BEST!!!

And Frankie best server in all fairness requested since Day 1 can't compare anyone else Lol <EOR> The Melting Pot really never disappoints    For last visit four course option   The first cheese fondue   ordered option special French themed menu   mix Brie few other fancy sounding cheeses bacon truffle there   served customary bread apples veggies   cheese option just OK   However gonna deduct any stars just because biggest fan cheeses fondue   would definitely ask waiter recommendation when comes cheese   usually however guy took order didn't seem knowledge experience usual waiters   He quickly replaced more experienced waiter when cheese came out   Apparently he busboy training waiter   Anyway always ask recommendation cheese   previous trips plans order special cheese waitress recommended against offered other choices popular   Try mexican style cheese fondue definitely best!  Gourmet nachos!  Next came salads which also don't disappoint   girlfriend always order house salad house dressings   good!  sister caesar mom house salad peppercorn ranch   both liked salads well     Although decided last time order entrees because just much food still them time   Coq au Vin oil seasoning broth mixture cook your entree in   far best option   all other trips would mojo which citrus caribbean option   broth all difference because alters flavor every dish   mojo good but only if don't mind citrus flavor every dish   ordered two special fondue fushion options   best option if interested ordering all four courses because comes more choices your entree plate costs same ordering la carte   came lobster filet mignon ny strip steak chicken duck l'orange shrimp little raviolis   Every single option delicious well marinated seasoned   sauces also better entree options when use Coq au Vin   Last but least original chocolate fondue   There's much say but perfection   seemed little cheap dippers usually come back ask if you'd any additional   asked some bananas waiter seemed little stingy when he offered some   But  ok   still delicious  <EOR> I LOVE MELTING POT!!

Also same person seemed upset cook own food    did think fondue was? isn't hibachi  Just safe don't cross contaminate cook chicken through doesn't take long   As far prices go  Yea costs decent amount money but sure everyone knows before come  Some meals $40 50 person well guys  fine dining prices but actually 4 courses  Also if you're want more order it! You're already dropping cash might well all out  Lastly if you're broken probably shouldn't your last meal before paid again  But yea prices little high but you're paying experience decent quality food  food portions aren't small! Last time aka March 10 2014 offered more veggies bread apples dessert dipping items   Lastly if want try eat more when $39 99 steak chicken dinner 4 courses unlimited meats during 3rd course  <EOR> I'm HUGE fan Melting Pot  loooove some cheese  If you've never MP before only cheese  seafood steak ugh chicken   salad appetizers 5 choices chocolate desserts  For would always choose Wisconsin Cheese Trio  IMO best  usually order cheese 4 even though only 2 us  Yea say want I'd rather eat cheese chocolate  maybe because full all cheese pass chocolate   Ambiance nice service usually very good  Feel free ask more apples carrots dinner same dessert  brownies best I'd prefer more those no bananas  The special time cheese chocolate 2 $22 per person includes TWO drinks!
