A OK World Famous which may really should Neighborhood Famous price paid vs  goodness   Oh forgot mention Staff = Super Nice Ambiance = Super Loud <EOR> Food really good but service extremely bad    I would probably try different location   Service very frustrating  <EOR> This place great food but everything else needs some serious overhauling    Famous deep dish attracted dine in  however order takeout instead step foot inside again  deep dish takes 45min make  service poor sure if because don't care if seriously under staffed    We stood front 5 minutes before acknowledged assume manager blue shirt but no name tag  He came kitchen retreated back entire meal  Several other customers experienced same greeting  waiter friendly  He seemed annoyed when questioned 45 minutes deep dish  He didn't check enough drinks weren't refilled hunt down check then again take etc  ordered Cesar Salad 4 thin crust 14 which felt took 45 minutes cook    If service point place would highly popular especially location but look customers' faces less impressed  truly hope place turn around before boat takes water  <EOR> Service very slow seemed server many tables  food came table order appetizer two kids' orders didn't pizza thin crust until those two items came out  pizza wasn't very good either  <EOR> I'm Chicago area anxious try out  very disappointed  each lunch personal deep dish pizza  sausage  friend cheese  Lots dough but much filling  Just Chicago style me  friend Chicago also agreed me  crispy enough either  reasonably priced no big loss  <EOR> New location never before wanted try because meatball sub sounded delish  Plus $12 delivered?
