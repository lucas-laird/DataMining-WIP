Only thing decoration  <EOR> It seems taken similar things other yelpers   idea sounded really good menu very inventive   While salt air margarita tasty twenty vegetable fried rice average average way over priced   don't know which food network chef thought best thing he ever ate but chef should more   Noodle dish weak ocean's nest but pork buns tastey   end all extremely over priced  <EOR> My review based Mexican side China Poblano   buddy highly recommended tacos try them put smile your face  skeptical because would Spaniard know tacos?  tortilla considered omelette Spain   But ran buddy's suggestion    I did find myelf identity crisis when walked because restuaurant literally divided between Chinese ladies making noodles left Mexican ladies making warm tortillas right   decided sit right side see ladies fresh hand made toritillas     I few tacos lengua beef tongue fish hongos mushrooms pork belly barbacoa braised short rib    All tacos high quality ingredients condiments meats   notable favorites beef tongue hongos   Beef tongue very tender seasoned well  Hongos perfectly sauteed mushrooms top fresh guacamole  Very tasty     Service slow but staff apologetic   would definitely back tacos again   appreciate Jose Andres maintained traditional taco did kill unnecessary fusion techniques  definitely did walk smile face  <EOR> This dish China Poblano ruined any other food  Ever  Nothing compares  Golden Pigs  Bbq pork stuffed buns served sweetened condensed milk  Sounds odd but omg works well! definite recommend! Service great  Recommendations server great  El Dorado cocktail  menu but oh good! <EOR> The only thing place going itself cleanliness restaurant   portions utterly small outrageous prices   egg Noodle wontons very disappointed  <EOR> I heard great things China Poblano thought I'd give try  Being local love trying new restaurants being able give visitors recommendations them! however recommend   The food good  nothing special  prices OUTRAGEOUS get  If going pay $10 per tiny taco I'd rather sitting wooden bench   The strong point meal salt air margarita  Delicious! And better $16 For 4 people bill came $240   and ate everything! worth it  Save your money somewhere better STK Mastro's  <EOR> You would guessed Chinese Mexican restaurant could exist delicious?  relatively extensive menu exists provide unique doing experience actually works!  vegetarian menu extensive however some fabulous options suitable any vegan vegetarian diner  <EOR> I ordered caldo tlalpeno soup supposed shredded chicken but wasn't  chicken chunks quality chicken terrible flavor  Nothing compared clado tlalpeno Mexico  portion caldo soup also very small didn't even fill half bowl  Then ordered queso fundido chorizo very sad say hardly found any chorizo again portions generous  Jose Andres let down twice  Same thing happened when visited Spanish restaurant jaleo poor serving portions expensive flavor quality there!!!! <EOR> Not impressed all  long night just NEED noodle soup  Since staying Cosmo noticed place performed quick Yelp  Ive noticed most reviews mentioned service lacking food good  complete opposite experience buy anywho  Eddie server through menu explained all really want noodle soup he guided swallow cloud their version Hong Kong wonton soup    Great love wonton soups  price portion small  Which branded chef am Vegas  first thing should when handed noodle soup sample broth  sure broth but might well drank water   broth tasteless  unsatisfying  little better use ALL chile sauce accompanied dish  Which fine because enjoy spice but next person cannot handle spice?  Anyways noodles overcooked  lacked chewiness noodles should have  Everything else tolerable    The only saving grace walking server served me  Eddie thanks making meal tolerable    No Bueno  <EOR> My friend talked Chef Jose Andres much sorta recent trip DC name stuck seeing tagged China Poblano Cosmopolitan figured destiny calling just try it    I'm really belief culinary experiences however life changing may should break bank just tell now two people drinks four small plates dessert came couple dollars over 100  but exception place because pretty effing good    Just know order    The 18 Monk Noodle amazing  don't even realize noodles whole wheat because they're just good sauce shitakes  waiter suggested opt Tuna Ceviche opposed Ceviche Pargo could've no wait  should've hugged it  tuna fresh  soy bathed amaranth seeds topped really enhanced fish way pretty indescribable    We also ordered Queso Fundido XO Scallops XO Sauce  wouldn't recommend because didn't really come melted cheese don't want pay $18 88 two golf sized scallops respectively  mistake  but don't yours! side note both good but great your hard earned dollars deserve GREAT okay?  After dollar signs kept racing through head tried figure damage wasn't really pay another double digit figure dessert but lady next devoured Mango Sticky Rice matter minutes thought we'd come far  #YOLO   Anyways incredibly good! your traditional Thai place MSR any means  light airy everything just works well write all really want drive down Cosmopolitan jammies order it    As far service given Tuesday night seated right away  waiter Miller awesome! He didn't shy away putting two cents when he knew making potentially catastrophic mistakes trying decide eat God bless it  <EOR> Everything try amazing  course famous 20 vegetable fried rice even when u order order veggie broth vegetarian usually made chicken stock   fav small bite When pigs fly  would definitely recommend friends  <EOR> Let Down    The concept basically glorifying street food China Mexico glorifying mean marking price 200% decreasing size portions basically nibbles   funny thing whole concept behind street food really good really cheap don't pay $4 taco size your pinky delicious  place turns truth its head doing exactly opposite  charging ton money mediocre tastes food  couldn't help but feel owners place bleeding patrons white bottom line people     For price food all press expecting place upscale   either  Avoid all costs     **This review based upon trying following  pomegranate margarita didn't all tart  When Pigs Fly  Dan dan noodles  Lengua tacos  Pork belly tacos pineapple  Carnitas  Can believe all $100+?

Anyone thought combining menu Chinese Mexican cuisine genius  perfect place if just want snack wonderful alternative if feel treating your palette more just your average meal  Perfect sharing friends  flavorful dishes disappoint but think only foodies really appreciate place  I always sit bar front open kitchens enhances experience  <EOR> Not fusion  affordable  creative   I could done better myself fraction cost better ambiance hotel room NY NY   Mediocre service icing cake  no water no silverware    Until tortilla line cook noticed just sitting debating whether use dessert spoons left place settings  handy meal mostly consisting romaine lettuce    Paris Hilton but paying $50 less 750 calories ridiculous    Otherwise food tasty given no expectations Jose Andres  <EOR> Apparently expectations tooooooo high   told foodies place must eat   However pool attendant said wasn't   First where fusion ?  menu food both places but nothing mixed them   waiter said best taco world   carnitas   Being San Diego just ok   salsa worth $5   main course Mongolian beef lettuce Kao Lao Loa noodles   told family style would plenty food   If consider 5 small pieces beef plate full lettuce enough then right place   piece off beef good   bad cheap actually family style   worst part noodles   When order noodles expect plate full noodles   individual coils noodles stood end bamboo steam pot   20 noodles tiger dipping sauce   almost spit sauce first bite   dirty water   Way much hype very little actually eat   never back  <EOR> Thought might fun try trip Vegas but would definitely give miss  ordered lot dumplings not great know dumplings! plus some noodle dishes soup bland broth Mongolian lettuce salad the vinegar overpowering sauce gluggy if bottle    We then some tacos much better especially carnitas duck tongue   Cosmopolitan seems full hen's weekends restaurant full big bridal shower groups scene  <EOR> Highly overpriced! $6 USD 6 8 oz imported soda water  Sounds mai ok but special enough $15 USD six pieces served oversized bamboo steamer over compensating   am Manhattan used pricey dinner meal items but quality special unique concept  Better off getting traditional dim sum  <EOR> This looked interesting restaurant cosmopolitan hotel  tried restaurant due appearance full crowd   big mistake should looked Yelp reviews before eating here  reviews pretty spot food tasted forgot season any it    The Mongolian beef tasted few pieces beef soaked watered down soy sauce  dish ton old lettuce really should called salad   The Twenty vegetables fried rice simply good  some other reviews said did taste fried rice  Adding chicken extra $5 mistake certainly did meal taste better    Lastly handmade tacos looked great being made  just tried standard chicken tacos tasted plain chicken no seasoning    The staff nice pretty fast  Might good idea keep walking past one  <EOR> I've twice both times pretty consistent   I'd recommend sitting bar which little less overly drunk 25 year old crew more focused food being able talk person next you   Service friendly attentive both bar table side   Things good salsa when pigs fly lamb potstickers stuck shrimp mojo that sauce tho! things ok langosta lobster taco open sesame noodles shredded chicken ordered both occasions good first few bites but lot it tuna ceviche huge letdown bc love good ceviche    server also recommended swallow cloud didn't bc didn't feel soup but sounds great golden pigs but haven't tried them yet   Drinks generous thoughtful   little loud table probably would sit bar again   Good groups well   drink chandelier bar afterwards  <EOR> Surprisingly good  above average expectations but still exceeded them  Menu large takes few minutes figure ut but everything good  Salsa different smoky tacos excellent esp brisket Chinese street sandwich great  Only complaints 1 server warned spicy some dishes but barely spicy and eats spicy stuff normally 2 wings good but underwhelming compared rest meal  Server good anti explaining menu otherwise  Server assistants other staff excellent prompt attentive friendly   If back Vegas stop again  <EOR> So start off staff service good   The idea place seemed good idea but group looked over menu none food expecting   understand concept place being all order small dishes share within group   waitress explained normally need 2 3 dishes per person fill up  Keep mind each small dishes 5 25 dollars   large party place worth you   Our waiting asked if would some chips salsa table  said sure brought two sets since 7 people  Then she bring some guacamole if guys would well  said sure  brought two bowls  I really craving tacos but noticed 5 50 10 50 one  asked big tacos she said 2 3 bites worth  Sorry don't care good taco was    worth price  better tasting taco east la taco truck    Their famous fried rice didn't wow either  Tasted something could any regular Chinese place    When check grand total 171 dollars pretty confused since only order taco each some fried rice  then noticed charged 12 dollars chips salsa then 15 dollars each bowl guacamole  Pretty shocked point  Cool    Got home looked bank account find 15 extra dollars charged debit card them  overall I'd never come place again  <EOR> Jose Andres revelation   He clearly works create perfect meal drinks dessert China Poblano no exception   Start off salt air margarita  brilliant idea you taste salt every sip instead having lick salt rim off glass well executed   Some favorites mushroom taco best vegetarian taco ever had brussel sprouts divine dressed scrumptious salsa verde hard put your fork down tuna ceviche shrimp mojo your table   Unlike some other celebrity chefs Jose Andres somehow manages maintain utmost quality restaurants it's no surprise many executive chefs gone onto own success   <EOR> Pricey but really good   bbq pork something taco blew mind  6 bucks taco but worth it   Plus really cool art design <EOR> Had swallow cloud very good  Soup very bland add some soy sauce it  Portion side super small price  <EOR> It pretty restaurant but good disgusting  don't Chinese food  <EOR> Baby pig taco pork skin  Fantastic  Chinese spicy tasty  Small portion size but pricey <EOR> I China Poblano family 10 00 pm Saturday night  seated promptly  waiter terrible  He didn't explain menu helpful all  Most plates shared but didn't know ordering  all agreed experience could lot better waiter helpful happy explain menu personality  If would caught name would definitely called management   food so   Definitely worth prices  <EOR> I cannot believe China Poblano such low rating   always loved Jose Andres never disappointed any restaurants   China Poblano no different now favorite all restaurants previously Zatinya Oyamel Jaleo DC    December 2012 while staying Cosmopolitan   very casual place fun relaxed vibe   ordered Golden Pigs lightly fried BBQ pork buns served condensed milk Har Gau appetizers   boyfriend skeptical milk being served buns but delicious!

Everything timed perfectly service excellent  Margs also delish  would consider more casual restaurant nothing fancy  Would def back  <EOR> I don't usually use star but man just bad   sitting down tell arent fusion probably all reviews great didnt want fusion anyways cant girl want egg roll cheese dip?? However place isnt Chinese nor Mexican!! start just wanted coke drink  All Mexican coke whats difference other regular coke 2 bucks nope coke 6 bucks!!! small little glass bottle  Just because imported Mexico  off bad start   The food anything but tasty  ordered cheese dip  came piping hot cast iron skillet just block cheap cheese  know kind buy refuses melt  could even dip your bread without literally pulling entire thing out! other dishes pretty tasteless too  ended going pizza spent 80 bucks place isn't cheap!   totally unsatisfied customers! Would recommend place all  <EOR> Even can't believe gave China Poblano 4 stars but did   Jose Andres' perverse juxtaposition Mexican cuisine Chinese cuisine works   would thought?  Like many Jose Andres' other restaurants China Poblano serves small plates   Thus possible try many dishes sitting   visit sampled among other things steamed pork buns Queso Fundido Shrimp Mojo Tuna Ceviche Cochinita Taco Barbacoa Taco Lucky 8 Sui Mai Beef     The Queso Fundido Shrimp Mojo Cochinita Taco superb dishes stood above rest   Queso Fundido wonderfully rich would expect accented well spicey chorizo   Shrimp Mojo nice harmony flavors between garlic roasted poblano peppers   Cochinita Taco everything would hope slow cooked pork taco would be     While three fore mentioned dishes deserve specific attention none dishes tried bad   mixing matching between two very diverse cuisines China Poblano keeps things interesting should something appeals everyone's palate  <EOR> While Mexican Chinese food might immediately seem best bedfellows menu wonderful    The dim sum great ceviche  Casual atmosphere nice decor  Great family style dining if want bring friends! <EOR> Amazing taste combinations perfect marriage exquisite handmade bbq pork buns try Golden Pig drizzle condensed milk savory Barbacoa de Res taco   Eastern Gin Tonic interesting but weak $18 charge   margarita good but also overpriced   Compared other dining Cosmopolitan place reasonably priced but still outrageous  If looking less taste but better deals try Holsteins next door 2nd floor <EOR> What smoking?  Why didn't yelp place before went?  disappointment      I read place magazine super excited noodle place nearby but duh J noodle places Bellagio Ceasars that probably way better      So went   Thoughtlessly!  Two stars super nice service but food blech side meh   Tiny overpriced size very boring   soup salty couldn't eat it   piglet hubby finished he wonderful man   server said soup comes mix I'm paying $15 soup MIX? WTF! must added even more salt when sending out     I feel totally ripped off   Vegas pay lot money mediocre food  <EOR> Not best but good  Guacamole really very excellent but $15 would expect be   The physical plates appear same use Oyamel DC but can't certain  Waitstaff great  very patient we couple members party come bit late took into consideration dietary concerns  Unfortunately really consisted leaving off bonita flakes dish just informing which dishes weren't vegetarian friendly and lot    Overall Jose Andres' restaurants quite bit while China Poblano decent wasn't anything really write home about  <EOR> Got 2 dim sum offerings mushroom taco   Shocked taco small mushrooms nothing else 5 bucks  nothing special unique fusion y but overpriced   The dim sum PF Chang variety   really dim sum very un authentic 11 bucks each ridiculously overprieced   The only reason gets 2 stars 1 setting both hotel restaurant itself gorgeous!

No    The second item ordered Ocean's Nest  wonderful medley vegetables seafood nestled top crispy fried noodles  Although expected soft noodles dish crispy noodles become soft lightly sauced dish saturated some noodles  wasn't big fan crispness noodles particularly when trying cut noodles easier eat  thought dish wasn't bad  would happier soft noodles but vegetables seafood tasty  Would order item again? Probably not   I did think menu prices quite reasonable ordered  Overall atmosphere nice conversation but better food found elsewhere  <EOR> Incredible experience!

Many vegetables indistinguishable another dominant taste soy sauce  beautiful look but  best say  much prefer $6 fried rice favorite sushi place back home   Tacos tacos unfortunately miss  chicharron didn't bring anything party Cochinita taco didn't care aftertaste either   Bottom line  China Poblano worth visit ambience certain dishes but definitely skip tacos  certainly looking forward going back try some Asian dishes  <EOR> We just enjoyed salt air margaritas lunch week  margaritas never disappoint  give shout Kevin outstanding service us!

We wanted try different restaurant last stay Vegas  originally going eat Wicked Spoon but line long last call 45 minutes  knew weren't going enough time eat    Thankfully only lunch weren't HUNGRY decided switch try China Poblano  first noticed owned chef Jose Andres  bad experience Chef Andres truthfully didn't enjoy restaurant over LA Bazaar  decided give another try   It pretty empty upon walking in  seated promptly service fast  First off decided order some soda because thirsty waitress comes dinky small soda cans!!! Those sodas $5!!! orders some ceviche tacos dan dan mien chilaquiles  overall favorite ceviche  Decent flavor good amount tuna  Nothing spectacular though  Different cuisines prepared different kitchens food comes off times  noodles okay  good kick spice but obviously traditional  chilaquiles joke  Basically tortilla chips sauce top  Looked cheap mans version nachos  Can't believe paid $15 it  Everything's lighter smaller side prepared eat light order lot!  After lunch it  Again nothing spectacular  Food expensive small  much more worth spend your money somewhere else  missing if haven't tried place Cosmo  <EOR> Where begin?  china poblano suggestion hotel concierge   He must payroll   Ordered several items menu must say chef needs rethink selections  <EOR> I Vegas several times year eaten restaurants galore city yay expense account! restaurant become standard go to   Mexican Chinese street food both done well   I dream Pozole Rojo soup here   Out friggin standing   broth rich little spicy big huge chunks pork   Alongside plate avocado finely sliced cabbage some pork rinds   cannot express love soup   meal choice city  <EOR> host friendly inviting perfect first impression excellent guacamole experience charming Nicolas engaged every step making delightful server Josue very prompt great menu beverage knowledge all recommendations outstanding pomegranate air margarita queso fundido con chorizo siu mai tacos de nopal Mongolian beef  Love place 10 10 would return food atmosphere service <EOR> one best meals years!

Nice fusion approach reasonably good food horribly expensive Vegas strip standards  Could better concept but enjoyed meal  <EOR> DO waste your money time!!  most disgusting place Las Vegas ever to!!  Expensive VERY small portions   overly salty  everything drowned soy sauce   you see am Chinese know REAL dim sum chinese cusine should taste its certainly THIS!!!  spent $50 3 dishes plus taco left still hungry  this place should business!!!  GROSS!!! <EOR> What waste money  portions small  understand supposed tapas but $8 88 pork sandwich circumference tennis ball? Really?? wasn't impressed place  ordered few dishes per person weren't really happy any them  Also took them half hour fill waters    The only plus nice GM came check us    Just head Spring Mountain eat something legit delish same price dishes full  <EOR> I Celiacs originally found restaurant list gluten sensitive restaurants Las Vegas  However gluten sensitive menu offers very few Chinese choices I'd say menu roughly 98% Mexican 2% Chinese  which personally upsetting since really looking forward gluten free Chinese food  Chinese food typically hard gluten free soy sauce contains gluten but gluten free soy sauces exist!! noodle option menu Kao Lao Lao oat noodles tiger sauce next option little asterisk just said contains soy sauce   asked waitress if soy sauce gluten free she said No kind chuckled told wouldn't recommend dish without sauce though because just plain boiled noodles  Ok  WHY WOULD EVEN PUT MENU?! only options left tacos  much Chinese food craving  Whatever  Heck even PF Changs does Gluten Free Asian food    Additionally  weren't totally sure but waitress never disclosed food would served tapas style arrive various times THREE different kitchens  known advance ordering case probably would ordered differently  everyone's dishes arrived separately within 5 10 minutes each other  Even all tacos came different times  Food just ok  friend 20 Vegetable Fried Rice which apparently featured Food Network everyone table aside wasn't gluten free agreed wasn't special tasted standard take Chinese food  kind basic  She also added chicken rice additional $5 however only able find several chunks chicken amidst veggies  worth it   All all food good great  Servers nice welcoming  don't think would back better places Vegas  <EOR> I always love trying new places menu sounded pretty interesting  Just stopped quick lunch ended ordering variety different tacos  Carnitas Barbacoa Chicken few appetizers queso fundido  food decent  Definitely overpriced pretty much everything becoming Vegas  Service great say that  <EOR> For price place pretty terrible    First warning sign 20 Vegetable Fried Rice  $20 doesn't even protein  $5 extra  Twenty bucks rice vegetables egg fried up?! Come now  just insulting   Next baked pork buns without doubt worst pork bao ever had  Try Noodles next door Belagio you'll find pork buns you're looking for  couldn't even finish them  insides tasteless outside chewy mess  Oh don't spicy mustard them want charge extra $2 some chili oil explaining made house  We're talking pretty standard condiments here   We also some tacos best thing could say them mediocre service  send 3 people back finally some soy sauce never saw waiter again taking order  <EOR> Really delicious 20 vegetable fried rice    super fun watch them dumplings fresh tortillas   surprised place doesn't more stars   thought winner! <EOR> Try reservations beforehand convenient text when your table ready nice right across sports book   Overpriced tacos but pretty good   full order least couple sure if would job prepping your stomach night drinking   place serves small portions even Traditional Sui Mai 6 pcs looked really sad its large container   pretty small size compared used traditional Chinese restaurants   soup since bit under weather Caldo Tlalpeno which shredded chicken rice peas carrots avocado chipotle   bit bland but perfect feeling   don't think I'd back China Poblano again unless same soup but certainly wouldn't full unless ordered tons more stuff   dinner definitely warranted another dinner #2 hour two later  <EOR> Amazing food  Great combination cuisines  Clever ideas  Loved lobster taco mushroom tacos  Shrimp cado cocktail gazpacho  Pan fried noodles good needed two orders  <EOR> This place overrated   People probably end eating because located newer trendier hotel   Top Ramen tastes better soup ordered Swallow Cloud Hong Kong wonton shrimp pork bok choy    wontons only things ate   noodles undercooked did absorb any flavor broth   worth $17  The Traditional Sui Mai delicious   price $13 but probably because sprinkled edible gold flakes   sure wouldn't tasted any difference   My friend couple tacos said pretty good   Unfortunately can't remember which ones   think carnitas pork belly a special      I expect pay little more dining Vegas   but type experience   give restaurant another try  <EOR> It Saturday Night met bro in law friends   eating counter first come first serve I think    Luckily 5 minutes chatting 2 people could sit  Bonus points purse hooks under counter! Since China Poblano located across Marquee crazy see long line 8 00PM!! I'm only rating few items because all try   ate good brunch some Sam Woo boo mid afternoon  so ordered only 2 tacos try   I ordered Pancita al Pastor Taco slow cooked pork belly pineapple $5 50 ate 2 5 bites! okay  NOT GOOOD hoping   didn't really satisfy tastebuds   But way sliced pineapple long ways thin interesting    did feel taco worth $5 50   My hubby ordered Viva China Taco soft beef tendon Kumamoto oyster scallions Sichuan peppercorn sauce $5 50 done 2 bites!  He said VERY SALTY!  Someone orderd Papas Fritas mole poblano Mexican cream queso fresco   Nothing rave about   Just fries mentioned above ingredients  The best thing tasted Salt Air Margarita   Think Margarita Martini Salt foam topping instead Salt Rim   Very eye catching too!  A few weeks later found surprise Mom's favorite Chef Jose Andres owns China Poblano which made little more dissapointing   The decor lights changing LCD picture frames bicycle wheels really different neat   don't know would come again because time Vegas again more other places try   PS   What's warm tap water??  would think would normal ice water  <EOR> pricey drinks but combination chinese mexican food same menu intriguing worth it   enjoyable atmosphere mainly friendly staff   would definitely back <EOR> Food amazing!!!! every food item ordered melted mouth    not fan table layout all tables very small only 1 ft away next table   so if stuck someone annoying become part your meal   not cool  portion sizes tiny wind ordering 3ish items per person which ok but doesn't work well when such small table <EOR> I intriged concept restaurant Chinese Mexican but fusion only two cuisines sharing same room but unavoidable anything else put together long period time eventually somehow mix create some kind new twist two    enter Viva China Taco   Viva China Taco beef tendon Kumamoto oysters item found some kind asian mexican mix  thought ok tendons thinly sliced fried raw oysters placed top  Te texture expected though soft outside crispy crunchy inside   next!  Silencio tacos made duck tongue another chinese delicacy talked its way into tortilla tasty sweet because fresh lychee tops taco but nothing memorable something would only eat once lifetime now done over with   After less stellar appearances viva China silencio tacos decided stick tried true  ordered carnitas baby braised pork topped chicharrones green sauce also ordered Baja style fish taco which ended being best tacos tried night but 6 50 taco expected those two bites better packed memories   This may chinese mexican restaurant two most economic cuisines but being another creation famous Spanish Chef Jose Andres prepared drop heavy peseta  Service awesome everyone hostes servers very attentive efficient   definitely chinese service  room nicely decorated very modern very colorful fun typical mexican sombrero wall   it more Asian theme    Next time try some Chinese dishes maybe try some other mexican plates why might just mood some CHINACAN order both  <EOR> Located Cosmopolitan say first caught eye place viewing window where could see them making pork buns also fact said take out  Pork buns + Take = Win! not quite happened but probably would gotten more stars case  Chinese cuisine + Mexican Cuisine = China Poblano  I'd say fusion two but menu literally its two separate cuisines order no mingling least eyes could see    Order consisted of When Pigs Fly 4 pieces steamed pork buns $13 88 Dan Dan Mian wheat noodles spicy pork sauce $12 00 Lychee Sour yummy drink $12 00   So waitress warned portions small should most likely order multiple things hence pork buns noodle dish  pork buns correctly portioned split order friend thankfully because she ordered single $10 Lobster Taco $14 Tuna Ceviche  waitress really wasn't lying small portions give credit honesty    The food overall pretty good  loved flavor meat pork buns but little turned off meat being lukewarm cold  noodle dish kind spicy enjoy but pace myself small dish swimming large bowl I didn't understand presentation lets portions look even smaller using larger serving bowls?   lychee sour probably favorite part whole meal  different type cocktail tangy yet sweet oh love lychee   Overall bit pricey taste given wasn't anything overly special wow factor  Perhaps I'd order steamed pork buns again take window given could request meat little more warm side  <EOR> Food good   Concept good   Portions bit small pricey get   family four ordered few things still hungry   someplace else actually more food  <EOR> I don't think wrong anything order here  friends best meal ever sure mango rice dessert  Mmmmm  Also if Sam your waitress even better!!!

Yeah neither   until visit   If other party male would relatively simple just speak say him  End story    But time person entered right next woman took only two empty seats right next each other bar section  Admittedly casual observer must appeared together    A nice server came over began reviewing menus us  She glanced back forth between recommended couple plates sharing  Usually loss words found myself struggling think say let server know together without sounding insulting dismissive other guest    Fortunately she took care saying smile Oh we're together  Thank whoever were!  Okay now onto review   so place well enough  very diverse unique menu blending Chinese Mexican dishes  Service smart friendly prompt  Based few recommendations server tried three dishes shrimp black peppers chicken taco beef tongue taco  Each tasty nothing spectacular but good  Beef tongue taco fine  If you've never basically nice cut roast    The portions VERY small  three tacos lunch somewhere afterwards  Think very light appetizers you'll along just fine    So based mediocre food very small portions going three stars  But service superb love atmosphere location right heart Cosmopolitan's busy second level  <EOR> Great concept but poorly executed  really unimpressed especially since Cosmopolitan houses many amazing restaurants   I dinner party 8  prices thought I'd some amazing fusion cuisine     Queso Fundido $10 literally just melted buttery cheese  can't believe paid 10 bucks this!

I'd rather pay little more buffet! <EOR> DISCLAIMER review doesn't anything actually food service but interesting read culturally ignorant   The food wasn't awful   Inauthentic disingenuine yes but wasn't food even captured attention   strange fusion decor really detracts mediocre fusion food   flashing pictures Chairman Mao next Dalai Lama fact Tibetan heavily oppressed Chinese government?   Actually read history China Poblana story young girl snatched home India Portuguese pirates sold into slavery Philippines odyssey took half way around world where dress wound starting fashion craze   She's known La China Poblana roughly meaning The Chinese Woman Puebla Mexico   She wasn't Chinese but old time Mexico anyone anything Asia tagged Chinese  If read top portion menu explaining significance restaurant's namesake claiming homage Chinese girl kidnapped pirates possibly raped assaulted forced spend life Mexico she known China Poblano  Sorry say but can't support restaurant capitalizes off historical inaccuracies pictures dictator next oppressed religious monk but then again Vegas where truth content respect doesn't really matter     Whoever came concept restaurant culturally retarded pecuniary jackass capitalizing off culturally retarded  <EOR> Interesting concept Mexican Chinese fusion  Some dishes come better others  Love shrimp mojo black garlic 20 vegetable fried rice  clams buckwheat noodles way salty heavy sauce  dishes bit pricey but dull  good selection cocktails but no draft beer  <EOR> Interesting menu  pork fish machaca tacos killer rice  Great margaritas bubble top  Recommend sure! Service excellent   <EOR> The food great service good  tried little everything but highlights Shrimp Mojo recommended waiter definitely favorite dishes night Dancing Eggplant we thought eggplant dish would boring but world Lucky 6 Sui Mai  Other highlights guacamole tuna ceviche both pretty unoriginal terms concept but when prepared perfectly take notice   restaurant does expensive especially alcohol  accounted half bill  would recommend eating but drinking elsewhere  <EOR> I high hopes place  Chinese Mexican fusion sounds awesome combo right??  Unfortunately service somewhat slow food average  Nothing special all I would say some noodle dishes tasted premade     The tacos tiny pricey! would say definitely worth even though some cool combinations Mushrooms Guac    The only outstanding items lamb potstickers  juicy unique tasty! <EOR> Over all very good experience  server Kevin incredible  He kept checking constantly he very polite made sure good experience  food very good  only reason giving place 4 stars because food did come table time  5 each food individually different time  Hope work that  Over all good experience <EOR> So when server tells We're fusion restaurant  When order your meals come separate kitchens call interested     The food great  Maybe starving but very tasty  regret getting queso dip I think dang table next rubbing face    The dan dan noodles good nothing write home about  chiqules I butchered another dish name amazingly tasty  Um Pappas delectable  20 vegetable fried rice also super yummy  dessert tapioca pudding ball thing great    Me really 20 vegetables?   Server promise fried rice 20 different local seasonal vegetables  Here's negative price size    Me fill up?  Server always suggest each person order least 4 items think tapas  wouldn't big deal if everything wasn't $9 more    So all pricey hey its strip but totally worth trying if don't mind taking mark against yourself   casino talk right? <EOR> Chinese Mexican weird combination but appeared work  Chicken Ji Song okay Chinese food  har gow disgusting  When Pigs Fly?

Ordering chips good decision though gave more variety appetizer just making quesadillas  chicken taco great flavor since asked guacamole side able put little taco use rest dip chips in  boyfriend no complaints mushroom taco  worth $5? Probably but Vegas $5 taco still cheapest options    Our friends opposite route ordered mainly off Chinese side menu  far less impressed  First started appetizer ceviche  $15 would think would served some kind chip scoop fish but just order chips queso order chips ceviche too  While table agreed among ourselves odd experienced other restaurants waiter insisted normal  can't remember exactly which other dishes tried but think steamed buns  weren't feeling dishes though  <EOR> There's large selection Chinese Mexican Chinese Mexican fusion foods  Swallow Cloud which wonton noodle soup  broth pretty bland watery only handful noodles  Overall average but pricey almost $17 bowl  <EOR> This restaurant confuses me  Perfect example bad fusion  even really fusion since just 2 concepts same restaurant you taco noodles     I open sesame which ok  bad good but definitely worth $14  Friend pork sandwich $10 TINY  he meal 5 minutes before already finished before noodles  Bad timing    The customer service good everyone nice but overall weird experience  Just worth money  <EOR> The fish tacos amazing   rest asian mexican fusion average   Some food didn't work some food just asian mexican fusion   looking fwd some creative mixes but found none  <EOR> So when heard Chinese Mexican fusion expected something different was  However wasn't disappointed when saw menu  broken into Mexican style dishes Chinese style dishes  server said similar tapas place small plates meant shared order two plates per person full meal  ordered Mexican asparagus Chinese Dancing Eggplant  asparagus amazing devoured all it  Honestly would okay just because pretty decent portion  eggplant wasn't really expected  covered soy sauce glaze fish flakes I forget actual name but smell taste really fishy   eggplant texture expected  hoping something would chew rather something just slid down throat  taste okay but couldn't slimy ish texture  them bring chips salsa table both really good  ordered classic margarita disappointed  If ever back really want try margarita flight friend did said amazing  server great answered all questions made some great recommendations around table raved about  He no trouble dealing 14 rambunctious girls bachelorette party all food came fairly quickly!

If already eaten lot places Vegas just looking someplace new then would consider going here    However if eaten lot places Vegas lot more other restaurants higher list around same price would try first  <EOR> I must preface review saying given knowledge on strip pricey gourmet small portions    just love fact could such variety food two favorite types Mexican Chinese    I love tacos noodles second visit stayed same noodles variety seafood felt just perfect sharing   noodles just right along seafood far more expected shared dish   tacos tried lengua pescado frito carnitas   While all delicious really love serving dish keeps them upright great presentation carnitas prompted myself friend order couple more sauce pork rind just adds right flavor     If expense meal pricey tasting delicious variety friends place eat  <EOR> This place should avoided all costs!

The food decent but service awful  would never recommend restaurant any friends  <EOR> Was expecting good lunch but awesome lunch  Food excellent loved loved margarita salt air foam  definitely come back next time Vegas  Chinese Mexican perfect hang over food all same place what's love  <EOR> Overpriced semi authentic fusion  Didn't really find actual fusion much offerings both cultures same menu laid separately    Tacos Lengua this  Delicious super tender  Cochinita overly salty flavor underwhelmingly one dimensional forgettable  Carnitas great texture concept pork rinds but dripping w oil hard eat   Chinese Dan Dan Mien tasty even if true form hand cut noodles yum spicy ground pork nice kick  Ocean Nest essentially seafood liang mien huang pan fried Canto noodles   Nice seafood selection lobster scallops king crab shrimp  rather disappointed presentation   Physical restaurant layout bit awkward no bar area major minus  Limited ambiance limited didn't care much awkward 'fusion' decor  <EOR> Can't enough place! food outstanding  carnitas tacos churros con chocolate world  Services incredible too!

Yes because tacos dim sum etc  usually thats problem  But worth it? Yes again   Atmosphere  casual  all partying dressing great dinners welcome change  People happy all around high drunk other casual eateries because don't serve cheap fruit punch cocktails here    Just cool that  <EOR> My first unpleasant dining experience Vegas    Service great but what's going food pricing portions    The food started off great! Chips included chips salsa delicious fresh  chipotle salsa much    Thee 18 Monk Noodles fine  Noodles very good but soy sauce way overpowering    Mongolian beef wasn't great either  Actually terrible besides fact Beef cooked perfectly served over romaine lettuce  sauce overpowering pleasant all    The tacos expensive bland contain little fillings    Tinga Poblana Carnitas tacos very bland  only thing could taste corn tortilla    We also spicy pork noodles  sauce good all made want continue eating    Overall very expensive bland unpleasant dining experience    I would strongly suggest waste your money here  <EOR> I place   think bit overpriced think would given 5 star review if didn't canned soda   food isn't super authentic but really good   service adequate but great   feel seem really busy but don't know why?  restaurant small don't appear given tons tables   guac buns   All tacos enjoyable   feel amount food its overpriced but its Strip   overpriced name game  Stop canned soda though kills me! <EOR> Guacamole AMAZING!   Wonderful salsa too! followed Chinese food which excellent <EOR> The pros food delicious nice ambience it's Cosmopolitan very good service water glass always full waiter attentive   The cons very pricey get  $5 tiny taco equivalent $2 tacos aI Bally's few days earlier lol $8 88 street sandwich which friend said normally $1 2 food carts  friend stuffed pepper pork pomegranate seeds   Both delicious but way price range pepper $16! didn't know going such small portions   I guess moral if money but warned all small plates  DELICIOUS small plates but small nonetheless  <EOR> Oh WOW!

Food salty poorly executed   would expect place features both Mexican Chinese food?  Only thing good place service  <EOR> If don't want buffets Vegas but still want meal would fill China Poblano place you  Basically portions extremely small considering prices pay  most disappointing dish Mongolian beef dish  thought going full meat dish  ended looking salad dish more lettuce meat meat extremely small sizes  also saw face neighbor's when he same dish  He shocked just when he received dish  thought Chinese Mexican food usually serve big portions  here  definitely worth your money middle class family  still hungry meal  embarrassment such beautiful hotel just opened week   I felt kind cheated eating here  Instead recommend take your money Cosmo  buffet  <EOR> I took kids dinner 5 hour drive 120 degrees weather  checked literally seated within 5 minutes!

Yes ok yes please  then comes extra small portion fried rice worth $20 then feel maybe waiter played fiddle  PASS   From Mexico Papas Fritas really didn't all but fair  001% nations's population doesn't particularly care fries  Also never really mole sauce because feels misleading  can't bill yourself chocolate sauce taste anything chocolate  sometimes forget doesn't taste chocolatey all try again UGH FLEECED AGAIN  But  neither nor there  PASS   In hindsight really sound hated it  Which totally didn't just very underwhelmed  originally DC area tried several Jose Andres' restaurants always absolutely obsessed all creations  maybe set bar high because such good things places before maybe just extra judgey because grew eating both cuisines much better cheaper prices before? Dunno  way despite being very hungry all just kind meh par other restaurants  Again nothing terrible just very good  think just isn't worth prices when many more incredible options just few steps away down strip  <EOR> This restaurant good but overrated  expecting amazing meal but special  Some really cool drinks creative items good tacos but wouldn't bother going back  20 veg fried rice best thing ever ate totally unimpressive surprised weak restaurant considering much hype heard its Jose Andres restaurant I would bother going back <EOR> We place Jaleo open lunch looking menu looked might it  server explain few items but once understood would ordering easy great share  Kao Lao Lao real find steamed perfection wonderful  also Unruly Monk favorite but Lemon Tree Shrimp real miss  understand others say service service just OK did appear server really happy there  Otherwise think definitely back  <EOR> As good friend Empire said the beautiful people didn't all disappear just all into hiding Cosmopolitan    Man she couldn't more right   Everywhere looked style over substance women trolling golden ticket men trying way hard look pensive staged photographs popped collars miles    and absolutely no sign furball creates one thing entourage daughter's deadbeat boyfriend   Let's face beast no sense style   Chewie's idea suiting picking birds trapped fur natty ass backhair   Fortunately black always no trouble getting into China Poblano which its surface presents awesome combination Mexican Chinese food all place   Why nobody entire galaxy thought before?  I say absolutely delicious   also say really REALLY should more it   Look part being beautiful people only pretending eat your food sure regulars hotel 2 bite meals more sufficient   Let's face though Nobody would ever claim needed eat damn sammich   if going pay 20 dollars damn 20 vegetable fried rice should substantial enough where more 1 little bit each kind vegetable   12 dollars object could eat bite?  Jesus Christ even WATER small   No seriously tiny glasses never even completely filled them refills   hell kind philosophy?  Made want Force Choke kitten    or least beloved Marie Osmond   But quarrel restaurant Flamingo Hilton   Sorry but you're claiming combination Mexican Chinese cuisine both which historically consist larger portion sizes   why try integrate tapas style sizes steakhouse like prices?  Maybe owner should focus more balancing value cuisine instead kowtowing perpetually pouty lipped 20 something gold miners looking someone enough mastery Force use Jedi Mind tricks Jimmy Choo salespeople free shoes   recommendation?  recipe SUPERB 20 veg fried rice readily available online   I almost never say but your own spaceship save yourself expense   3 Deathstars  <EOR> Went colleague dinner  Knew going small portions  Shocked small really were  good side gaspacho amazing 5 stars noodles ehh 3 stars   Service good but apparently didn't fit mold seated counter    All all won't back but worth giving try  <EOR> This become favorite spots Vegas! Mostly because Mexican Asian food top 2 favorite cuisines  When walk into China Poblano right open kitchen see staff making food Mexican dishes such fresh tortillas fresh guacamole  left another open kitchen where making some Asian foods such dumplings dim sum etc  sit counter which looks into open kitchens dining area which plenty small tables well large tables big groups  restaurant very colorful  Mostly red color lot interesting decor big portraits fun lighting    99% reason come Asian food! great selections siu mai which all very flavorful tasted authentic  However 2 dishes ALWAYS when come Golden Pigs Dan Dan Mian  Golden Pigs great if chinese bao buns  bao buns taken next level! buns filled chinese bbq pork then fried  served side condensed milk dipping  sum pretty much eating bbq pork donut  Yes sounds strange but forced all friends try dish all crazy over it! perfect combination sweet salty fatty fried  Great hangover food  Dan Dan Mian best Asian noodle dish ever had  noodles hand cut wheat noodles spicy pork sauce peanuts  addicting! pretty much spicy Chinese version bolognese  spicy pork sauce szechuan kick you'll definitely hint smokiness dish  love it!  However only reason gave place 4 stars instead 5 because disappointed tacos  People love Mexican food usually order tacos off menu since good variety tacos choose from  However $5 $6 PER TACO don't think worth price all  ordered Tinga Poblana taco didn't taste any chipotle flavor  chicken weird texture  almost mushy tofu  point wondered if even eating chicken  didn't taste all expecting to  also Refried Bean taco barely any chipotle salsa it  tacos also weren't good which let down since made fresh restaurant  definitely better tacos other places  However fresh guacamole spot on! definitely guacamole when feel eating Mexican food here   I'll definitely back but mostly Asian dishes  Mexican dishes use some improvement opinion  <EOR> Well     say tacos  AMAZING  If theres something would die life would probably tacos   lol jk   Im saying die for  why havent before ??   I tried couple different kinds tacos carnitas barbacoa and   My absolute favorite COCHINITA     delicious  also chips salsa salsa really good  lastly Papas Fritas con mole y queso   I recommend China Poblano anyone Vegas    also try Margarita Sal de Gusano    topped Salt air  its great <EOR> Not much recommend here  general rule come Vegas prepared spend cash going dock place being ridiculously overpriced relative your traditional Mexican Chinese restaurant  $4 $5 per taco $22 seafood noodle dish may seem steep but ok if food top notch    Unfortunately China Poblano fell short expectations  Al Pastor taco very little pork belly overwhelmed sauce  portion sizes small across board  guacamole pretty good but then again pretty hard screw guac    I would dine again nor would recommend others  <EOR> Loved tasting experience restaurant! Prompt attentive service every bite delicious  Loved shrimp 20 vegetable rice dessert   Great drinks too! <EOR> Wow interesting combination  love concept combining Mexican Chinese food two favorite cuisines    My colleague did some sampling different items favorite being chicken wings  also loved chicken taco ordered  20 vegetable fried rice really good also  even left add protein if wish    One thing wish would tried margarita sure delicious!  FYI probably won't want sit outside restaurant while everyone waiting line Marque Day Club able hear yourself think  <EOR> If out of world carnitas tacos yay pork rinds! think would given place only 2 stars   advertises itself chinese mexican fusion but menu really just split into various mexican dishes chinese dishes mostly dim sum variety   overall note think Mexican dishes much tastier chinese items if wrestling b w two would Mexican  Here's tried TACOS Carnitas yum yum yum   Definitely order if order nothing else   two won't share  A+  Viva china kumamoto oyster beef tendon sichuan peppercorn sauce taco   combo tendon oyster underwhelming if really love peppercorn taste you're going find much here  C Barbacoa ordered because came cactus paddle    Still no idea cactus paddle but awesome name!  beef alright though bit salty cactus unfortunately didn't really taste anything all  C fried fish taco fish fried nicely liked pickled onions came but close 7 bucks two tiny tacos pinky sized pieces fish probably wouldn't order again   B CHINESE  Fire Phoenix pretty much variation popcorn chicken pork rinds side The sichuan peppercorn salt really good fried chicken never tastes bad when fres but really wasn't anything special dish   C  MEXICAN  Tuna ceviche Comes bed ice looks delectable   Tastes pretty a ok too  think put soy sauce which gives nice depth flavor   A Coctel de camarones pretty much cold cocktail shrimp crab avocado mixed essentially cocktail sauce   love lump crab meat love shrimp but didn't come eat those things cocktail sauce   3 99 anywhere else   C  Shrimp mojo actually did taste fusion dish though bit heavily sauced   shrimp nice garlic y hint spice poblano peppers   Good but could used side rice something   B In nutshell I'd recommend just stopping sitting counter ordering some tacos especially carnitas ones then going somewhere else dinner   disclaimer didn't order famous twenty ingredient fried rice featured food network but taiwanese just don't feel right paying 20 bucks fried rice  <EOR> Kate awesome! mention every dish world  loved margaritas too!

China Pablano waste time  <EOR> First let tell place NOT   cheap although terribly pricey Vegas standards  If want cheap fast meal would recommend grabbing couple slices Pizzaria upstairs   really Fusion since most dishes clearly Mexican Chinese only couple successfully fuse two   also fine dining experience would expect some Jose Andres' other restaurants    However did enjoy excellent service very tasty often creative food  server very knowledgable menu seemed enthusiastic food  Service very attentive manager even stopped sure everything good    They two nice open kitchens where see homemade dim sum made next handmade tortillas  mostly tried Chinese dishes since plenty good Mexican LA  lamb potstickers juicy delicious beautifully presented   20 vegetable fried rice probably best fried rice ever had  also tried chilaquilles which delicious filling  tacos seemed pricey $5 piece but didn't try any  mango sticky rice very light refreshing but don't expect any actual sticky rice   Try tea two interesting cocktail  Overall very good dining experience although necessarily best value  <EOR> So expensive such small portions   they must high! least filling $120 lunch ever had  4 came $30 each   Chips salsa appreciate warm chips  salsa ok flavor but lacked some freshness  Maybe needs cilantro onion   Tacos ordered 3 different tacos pancita cochinita barbacoa   Nothing special way flavor  Every taco chunk fat it  $9 2 tiny tacos adds up    Lamb potstickers meh really anything better would frozen bag  light flavor  asked some sort sauce waiter obliged but reminded sauce doesn't normally come order  sauce added sssooo much  If weren't sauce would hard time eating it   Gazpacho something fruit salad  very good but again very small portion   Tuna ceviche didn't eat because don't tuna but heard better dishes lunch   Shrimp mojo recommended host pretty good but really oily    Overall wouldn't back  <EOR> Really great place  Def try salt air margarita individual street tacos 20 veg fried rice tuna cerviche mango sticky rice finale!  good group having tasting!  many more great dishes but theses highlights! <EOR> Best customer service experience long time! never thought would place but good great  golden pig chicken fish tacos  All flavorful fresh  <EOR> I little unsure place chinese mexican fusion combo made ask why???

After short wait seated seemed take awhile see waiter then orders in   meantime ordered salt air margarita   super tasty but $14 kind teeny   Especially when seems foam takes 1 3 glass   But really superb margarita   My friend ordered fried buns condensed milk glaze   wasn't sure them but actually kind amazing   ordered chicken poblano taco lobster taco   poblano taco really good   should've just ordered two three those done but lobster taco sounded enticing   Um much   wasn't great $10 highway robbery   All other reviews right   tacos all crazy overpriced they're tiny   We ended sticky rice mango dessert   all imagined but still ate every last bite   This place isn't bad just let down   high hopes looking menu bit underwhelmed food overwhelmed prices   wouldn't say eat just know expect  <EOR> The food very good but very expensive size dishes   told 20 vegetable rice Dan Dan noodles would more enough two but bowls small   terra cotta warrior dessert which okay   best part ginger ice cream but only came half scoop   decor great service good but don't expect much value money  <EOR> Very interesting combination food under establishment  restaurant offers Chinese Mexican fusion eats both available location     We decided give place try since staying Cosmo wanted find something within hotel  front restaurant very eclectic vibe many different colors Chinese Mexican heritage decor throughout  love all loud colors exterior inviting decor    The hostess entrance nice seated right away  server Theron point providing special recommendations  food definitely acquired taste  Don't come thinking food found you'll find some fast food because anything found fast food places  food definitely fusion kick being food definitely fancier side normal    The plates smaller side idea restaurant more tapas family style  idea order multiple dishes share amongst everyone table  All all ordering 5 dishes 3 alcoholic beverages bill just less $100    Would recommend friends try? Let's just say rushing tell friends foodie experience  Customer service great but think food fancy when all want day drinking greasy taco bowl shrimp fried rice  <EOR> You should know when dining celebrity chef's Las Vegas eatery most likely eating upscale Applebee's  Sure some exceptions but large quality subpar would find if say eating Jose Andres establishment DC  want real thing source cash grab restaurant deal  mad chefs done would exact same thing if position   China Poblano Vegas version Jose Andres' DC China Chilcano  concept  chuckled when saw $45 8 course tasting menu even ordered top few tacos  food  table side guac ok but would expect $16 much salt but think balance unseasoned unsalted house made tortilla chips  end works finished off  salsa heavy poblanos smoke but kept going back it  Mexican inspired dim sum great sweat pea salad  beef tongue carnitas tacos solid  20 vegetable fried rice mojo shrimp where off rails became evident just upscale TGI Friday's     The shrimp swimming mojo little undersized expecting  fired rice main course tasting menu  lot swimming oil  say liked idea 20 vegetable fried rice plan making when home just less oil   All all good everyone dining happy  But back mind couldn't help but think didn't live quality expected   Would back? Probably would many hidden gems off strip China Korea town  Would chose over other celebrity chef's Vegas money grabs? Yeah those tacos legit  <EOR> I truly no idea anyone could rate place low  Different strokes guess    But let tell shrimp mojo world class dish  Light full flavor creative perfectly cooked  Guac perfect balanced  Chips good lamb potstickers wild crazy must try them see   If nothing else try mad wonderful scientist Jose Andres give salt air margarita whirl  new fantastic    Service intelligent right on  She knew menu recommend all good stuff   No cheap but worth mouth happy hour!   I'll back try all spots  <EOR> The staff definitely friendly helpful   menu items indeed intriguing catchy names Swallow Cloud  When Pigs Fly    few foods like signature Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich whose ingredients couldn't quite decipher maybe braised pork belly char siu??? nor find another restaurant   fried quail rose petal menu item called Water Chocolate ! I'm fan movie    However overall taste disappointing   pork filling street sandwiches salty even when eaten bread   Swallow Cloud which really just wor wonton noodle soup also salty thought favorite Chinatown restaurant did better version cheaper    When served tea advised give few minutes brew    wish ignored because time poured bitter   lunch very expensive compared experience got   don't mind paying $30 person lunch but think deserve guaranteed least satisfying dining experience price   PS Even though fan Water Chocolate decided order namesake dish tasting foods started serving us   $15 already bloating check didn't want risk another possible disappointment  <EOR> I liked food here  Jose Andres very creative enjoyed all restaurants thus far  Highlights pork belly sandwich in indian bread   Please order especially if pork belly  other highlights carnitas taco  drinks if little kick smoke your margarita then special rim   also salt air margarita which fun tasty but actually preferred special rim  Hmm sounds strange say  Oh queso fundido pretty good    Don't order 22 dollar expensive seafood noodle dish  worth it  Also scallop shu mai just okay  friend tried 2 desserts neither impressive  ordered mango sticky rice  Well no rice  put tastes rice krispies top  Fail     Service good  Very friendly young male server   But hated seating there  Most seats no back them very uncomfortable  Good thing doesn't take long eat here  <EOR> I want live off salt air margarita  delicious missed  All Chicagoans extremely spoiled great Mexican food tacos favorite however steamed buns guac delicious  server Terry also worth 5 star rating  Las Vegas houses some best service country most all stars but he really made love time there  would definitely recommend place if need somewhere quick stop before grabbing later dinner show near Cosmo  <EOR> Tapas style Mexican food using Chinese ingredients vice versa  can't say anything price because ate employees 50% off   As far food just alright  Although admit some food creatively put together wasn't something would back for   If you're looking something similar try Jaleo which just upstairs  classified fine dining naturally more pricier but food definitely worth it  dishes much more flavorful more bolder more bang buck  <EOR> Once again Jose Andrés made impression another sexy casual dinning     Everything ordered expected complex yet simply delicious  only downside menu difficult read however server very attentive helped tremendously  Good stuff!

<EOR> One favorite spots lunch Vegas! love atmosphere  festive fun without being loud obnoxious  salt air margaritas absolutely die friend re creating them perfectly least year  takes some work air but totally worth it! favorite drinks anywhere   The concept Mexican Asian fusion seemed little bizarre first but plenty separation menu if adventurous eaters  fun mix match Mexican Asian small plates between   I 3 4 times tried variety dishes  Almost every dish small plate appetizer friends always variety options share  guacamole outstanding plenty gluten free options including chips which pleased gluten free friends  When Pigs Fly favorite appetizers  steamed buns super filling but delicious   I would recommend trying least sui mai options if indecisive try combination!

Har Gau's Whens Fly both great replicas would find great underground Dim Sum restaurant   For edgier 'Fusion' dishes Scallop Ceviche made day   very familiar Jose Andres' restaurants find 'fluff' 'molecular' aspects cuisine times detract flavors enjoyment some dishes but hit park me   dish served individual bay scallops served key lime half crusted assume margaritas more 'Sal de Gusano' salt chile powder roasted caterpillar yes caterpillar table side spraying tequila each bite   You're instructed eat scallop off lime squeeze suck while take scallop   Freaking delicious!  'Silencio' taco duck tongue rambutan another delicious 'fusion' dish feel doesn't enough credit because drunken bimbos wander night Marquee aren't going try 'duck tongue '  lamb dumplings very interesting satisfying well tasted baby lamb empanadas baked cheese crust   As far drinks try Margarita con 'Sal de Gusano '  hard ever back traditional salted rim ever again am therapy now gone   My girlfriend two occasions three days Cosmo favorite place   did tasting menu Scarpeta loved well but kind place could eat twice week   service also fantastic enough mentioned cool design inside also   Highly recommend place people know good dim sum know good Mexican open trying new interesting well! <EOR> We excited try place! menu looked fantastic hostess front gave thorough run down everything favorites were  Everything came good shareable size for 2 husband Mongolian beef bbq pork dim sum couple tacos then dessert churros chocolate sauce  Honestly only thing I'd again bbq pork dim sum!

Funny but good   However noodles lower price range Kao Lao Lao Dan Dan Mian least favorite  taste flat greasy boring  dont recommend  guess pay for    Soup   OK   Bartender super nice explained everything asked  <EOR> Terrific place  would 5 stars if weren't incredible noise   Very loud   Food delicious service impeccable   basically tapas Mexican Chinese restaurant   Price fair but cheap   must absolutely try both sides menu Mex Chinese both offer variety different variations some classics new twists respective cuisine   also offer variety specials each night  little kids sure  <EOR> You know when gas station pay using credit debit card before pumping gas? know gas station pre charges certain amount guarantee actually pay those 21 gallons gas your gas hog vehicle guzzles up? know those pre charges immediately returned your account once complete your gas purchase? Well China Poblano treats its customers' gas pumpers good ol' Gas 'n' Goods   Hold on  Let back write review actual dining experience before into real reason 1 star review   My actual dining rating probably closer 3 star terms food taste ambiance  eaten China Poblano before while date  food good drinks well made  didn't care time prices because date insisted whatever wanted  overpriced menu wasn't issue until return visit friends    During return visit chose items little more conservatively  Only cocktail some guacamole some duck something or other  total bill including automatic tip 20% for parties 6+ only $39  bad all really even though realized should just ordered twice much guacamole skipped duck whatever  LOVE duck always order when onto menu  wasn't watery mouth duck  over cooked barely recognizable duck  food isn't amazing would suggest large groups which only person pays  more cute place date place group friends paying separately  isn't even really fusion restaurant per se if craving Mexican Chinese should probably just restaurant crave   A fusion restaurant usually point FUSE two types cuisine into dish  restaurant merely offers items two different cuisines separate sections   Anyway restaurant cute  decor different  only chairs backs them booths  servers lazy  Oh wait what's that? Lazy servers overrated restaurant serves undersized overpriced food? No way!  Now better explanation why restaurant 4 star first visit 1 star second third visit friends ate meal paid meals individually debit credit cards spent rest night enjoying some Mario Kart room some hot tub lounging because well staying Vegas full week already night #5  seemed great night all around   Then when woke morning friends decided check account charges phone app  He panicked when he saw China Poblano charged extra 30%  He paid $39 including tip suddenly $51 70 charge  Granted wasn't insane amount money  Only $11 70  However when consider total bill table over $200 30% upcharge now looks more hefty $60+ charge spread over all accounts  all checked accounts since all servers restaurants before realize sometimes shady desperate servers add on little extra tip hope no notices stormed over China Poblano determined fix issue money back into accounts  least wanted genuine apology   When arrived restaurant asked speak manager extra charge hostess stated Oh yeah all time  Ummmmm what? complaint all time?  Well manager explained [cheap ass] credit card processing company use temporarily charges extra 20 30% transactions guarantee funds available  JUST GAS STATION  only difference gas station pre paying something which final price unbeknownst until done pumping  restaurant especially when tip included bill know exactly much paying right then when sign receipt  server then enters into computer no more need any extra charges    We tried explain ONLY restaurant ever encountered such ridiculous practices  only give customers small panic attack when check account balances imagine if someone special dinner reluctantly threw down $500 nice dinner your family when look your account charge $650 instead BUT TOP don't seem think big deal let customers know extra temporary charge ahead time  top all manager very condescending smug without apologetic bone body  <EOR> I'm torn  food ranges extremely good below average depending dish  menu extremely hard read dish selection very random unfamiliar service complicated 3 different servers slow price portion ratio outrageous trying mix two things which just don't blend  Chinese + Mexican just doesn't work conclusion general just way more complicated experience anyone looking Chinese Mexican wants deal with  <EOR> Very fresh authentic dim sim Mexican  Chinese Meican concept restuarant provides greta spot lunch casual dinner tweener  Very good small plates allow enjoy little everything open kitchen offer  Loved sticky buns veggie din sum lamb dumplings  Did try any mexican but looks table next can't wrong  <EOR> We came Saturday lunch only 2 3 full  menu pretty big including chinese mexican dishes  Maybe why some them outstanding while some them good   The duck tongue taco die for  favor texture garnish well together  come back only this!! the quail egg Sui Mai very refined really taste true meaning Asian Fusion  The wonton noodle soup just very ordinary but overpriced noodle soup  recommended   viva China taco worse meal  beef tendon sticky oyster fresh   the infamous 20 veg fired rice bad but special expected  great place visit once because very special  <EOR> DECEMBER 17 2016 ordered way back Venetian  Although thoroughly enjoyed ordered unfortunately did receive everything ordered    Guacamole absolutely DELICIOUS  even container taste freshness all ingredients  well freshly fried tortilla chips    Traditional Sui Mai little different actual traditional Sui Mai but still delcious none less    Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich No comment  Because never received order truly upset it    After receiving food grabbed bag rushed back Venetian ready night  When reached hotel opened bag only those 2 3 items ordered  Frustrated called restaurant back spoke manager duty  5 10PM Saturday December 17 2016 He asked if wanted come back sandwich but told all way Venetian would major inconvenience back  he offered give refund long he spoke person gave order  However he told said employee already finished left shift  asked appropriate thing he said he'd call back tomorrow talking said employee  he took number    The next day came absolutely no phone call whatsoever  top still paid sandwich    I understand restaurant busy but taking costumers money without giving them complete order practically fraud  costumer deserve better this  hope others come enjoy restaurant receive better because food great  customer service however be time mistake not  could easily resolved but wasn't  why am still upset  <EOR> I am surprised all so so reviews place  starving slightly hung over big NYE night Michalada perfect way start meal off    The tomato juice concoction excellent very unique am used to    Our server great offered some very good suggestions  started tinga carnitas tacos  Both fantastic  ordered dim sum sampler each piece bite heaven    The fried rice probably least favorite dish very underwhelmed especially all hype being 'not missed' dish  bad just nothing special    The empanadas great  am picky mole but great    The dan dan mian noodle dish so so  probably would reorder again but again nothing bad just very memorable  server said very spicy and love spicy but didn't much heat all    Overall good dining experience  Next time probably stick tacos dim sum maybe some ceviche  <EOR> I hate when restaurants claim specialize certain foods only extremely disappointed plainest tasting noodle soups ever had   name China Poblano would think Hong Kong inspired wonton soup would taste halfway decent  swallow cloud soup noodles dull just left them flavorless water like broth   wontons only edible item soup  Even Bok Choy flavorless  bowl noodle water costed $17 too!

Probably top 3 desserts ever eaten life   Don't pass if you're open trying new things  traditional but all done well   I back every time Vegas! <EOR> Nobody expects Spanish Inquisition     $5 small bowl white rice!  I mean know Vegas but charge white rice definitely takes cake  Especially when rice doesn't come saucy entrees like mapo tofu expect someone eat kinds dishes without rice?  Overall thought entrees overpriced given extremely small size flavors just okay not fantastic   parents thought food overall just really salty   I don't eat lot general but even thought portion food really small  dad ordered dan dan noodles while flavor overall bad although tad bit salty bowl only filled halfway noodles  ordered cold sesame noodles received similar portion size  flavor overall okay but definitely didn't feel full   For gua bao only give charge $8 99 very small gua bao size McMuffin  most places usually give two gua bao   The mapo tofu portion wasn't terribly large but still really saucy  didn't come rice mentioned earlier your very small entree really costs $15+   The hongos taco only came taco really expensive but sister said good  just incredibly small overpriced   Total five people $65 but still hungry afterwards  <EOR> Another over priced restaurant wannabe authentic taste  Five dollars taco? lol Sure tortillas hand made but everything else mediocre    Taste ehh aguachiles joke small plate couple scallops it   Not mention waiter over charged us  good reputation leave new costumer  Won't back rather taco truck  <EOR> I've passed place quite few times but finally decided dine today  service very attentive but felt didn't beyond teach table waiting 101  server asked if ready drinks entrees then desserts let know personal favorites each course but didn't actually describe any them  honestly didn't any problems service though food prices leave less satisfied    Guacamole $15 Although pretty pricey probably favorite dish night  lot large chunks avocado which something could never complain very fresh flavorful  only thing didn't waitress asked if done once chips ran even though still third left  just kind annoying she trying take plate away rather offering more chips   Large pot Jasmine Downy Pearls $8 88 Very aromatic tasty  would probably come just tea     Chips salsa $4 hardly touched salsa but ate all nice crisp chips guacamole  Definitely worth four bucks   Pescado Frito $6 50 very flavorful very fried  If going pay $6 50 taco expect pretty damn good    Dancing Eggplant $9 88 waitress seemed little reluctant when ordered this  She made sure warn bonito flakes eggplant boiled  feeling she didn't all  thought just okay   Traditional Sui Mai $13 88 really loved crisp water chestnuts added Sui Mai  edible gold flakes each piece also gave unique presentation    Don't Jealous Hot Sour Soup $8 88 most disgusting Hot Sour soup every had  seriously ruined palette  whole bowl soup just reeked tasted hot red wine  NEVER tasted Hot Sour soup before  couldn't take more two bites without feeling sick because strong wine flavor had  Don doesn't even Hot Sour soup but he could still taste much worse others    Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich $8 88 Way salty saucy  whopping $8 88 definitely worth it    Jericalla $11 ever Abuelita Hot Chocolate? comes package http beautifulspitup com wp content uploads 2011 12 abuelita mexican hot chocolate1 jpg containing tablets compressed cocoa sugar cinnamon http beautifulspitup com wp content uploads 2011 12 cut abuelita jpg  Well small amount custard bottom cup covered seemed ground tablets Abuelita Hot Chocolate http s3 media2 ak yelpcdn com bphoto V1zh1nc2VASkoNUsyJS5JA l jpg no good thing  felt ai just munching hot chocolate powder  mean custard sorbet alone good but couldn't eat those without eating all powder  Plain simple sucked    Overall loved presentation all dishes however flavors just didn't match  Hot Sour soup really killed me  only thing think worth coming probably tea but  still something would drive over for   Warning If look your bank statement day two coming amount charged lot higher actually paid because pre authorize themselves 30% tip but down whatever actually paid them when transaction clears  Why anyone would give place 30% tip beyond me    <EOR> This very bizarre place  service horrible! group ordered drinks apps then dinner  entrees came first then few drinks came then ask happened apps!

I enjoyed air foam topped margarita chili pepper spicy margarita  most unique tacos ever duck tongue lychee corn tortilla taco  Although really enjoyed duck taco definitely liked beef lengua taco more since duck tongue taco unique tastes  also loved Hao Gao dim sum insides combined pork shrimp when its usually just shrimp  Very tasty stuff  six pieces disappeared tummy quickly!  I also ordered carnitas taco but never came out  inform waiter he said never ordered it  could sworn did  happens next? receive check carnitas taco bill! supposed taco never ordered! think manager noticed dejected look  He came over asked if okay told happened  waiter never returned but manager helped correction bill sincerely apologized    My summary Food very interesting!

Definitely skip China Poblano  if want try Jose Andres' fabulous food  Washington DC    because certainly won't find China Poblano! <EOR> While staying Cosmopolitan decided venture away addicting Secret Pizza place same floor China Poblano on   Yes place definitely pricey  Newsflash everyone EVERYTHING overpriced Vegas if don't want spend money stay home    My rating based service selection quality food not price     We ordered Cold Tea Two combined flavors green tea tequila beer very refreshing interestingly delicious   green tea made feel less guilty drinking alcohol early day    Then ordered guacamole served handmade tortillas guac just mom's generous slices jalapeños! Best thing guac order huge mountain avocados choose spicy it  Guac meal itself but felt vegetarian pig ordered more     The vegetable spring rolls delicious waiter attentive needs he let know sauce fish made alternative soy sauce dip them into   ended dipping them into guacamole felt eating Asian taquitos      Then came Setas taco made wild mushrooms top MORE GUAC! supper yummy! carnivore boyfriend ordered Rou Ji Mo Street Sandwich looked more gordita carnitas   He said very tasty    Yes there's more    decided try Tres Lychees dessert took concept traditional Tres Leches Mexican cake added lychees three different forms Lychee Ice Cream Lychee whip cream fresh Lychees top  Perfection!

That said some clever dishes serve nicely sized portions   Perhaps came off night?  Only gave 2nd star due memory first visit   Proceed your own risk  <EOR> My boyfriend came missed lunch window Wicked Spoon   starving which usually allows crappy food taste little better just close   I should known Chinese Mexican restaurant would good idea   reason why never come across mix   because simply does work!  restaurant should focus making better Chinese food better Mexican attempt both types cuisines   I dan dan noodles some soup wontons the name escapes now    dan dan  noodles okay   soup didn't much flavor   only saving grace wontons   My boyfriend ordered lobster taco because $10 pop two chicken tacos mole sauce side    He said lobster taco good but chicken just whatever   Overall best thing ordered guacamole Mexican coke   chips salsa decent  <EOR> It theory all things mixed end greater two parts   ever seen Halle Berry?  Exactly   So during last Vegas adventure girls stopped China Poblano   the beautiful baby when Mexico China it   The decor cute  only mix Chinese Mexican iconography also mix casual tad more upscale  staff friendly point   Quick smiles conversation   But real pride litter food   We ordered Guacamole When Pigs Fly Beijing Glass Tuna Ceviche Mexican Mimosa  It all fantastic   First all guacamole flavorful smooth enough kick table Latinas eating nod appreciation  When Pigs Fly pork buns fluffy rivaled traditional buns had  Beijing Glass zesty refreshing  Mexican mimosa refreshing just right bitch slap booze interesting   But all dwarfed sheer awesomeness Tuna Ceviche   many textures flavors spices all could barely contain ourselves!  perfect marriage Mexican spice Chinese textures   exactly place all about     Next time Vegas it soon going back see little half breed more time  <EOR> The notion intermingling Chinese Mexican cuisine intriguing exciting when saw China Poblano Yelp seemed ideal late afternoon lunch  Any excuse walk beautiful Cosmopolitan actually motivation enough me  Unfortunately though restaurant ended being expensive huge let down    My initial impressions interior pleasing  space flavored festive reds other vibrant colors exuding playful ambiance  continued way inside lack ventilation become apparent  extremely warm  Peeling off sweater quick fix though  sitting down notice walls graced rotating projected images Mao Tse Tung random images Chinese peasant girls little boys Mexican adults  strange   After being seated shortly met waiter inquired whether wanted chips salsa  Without hesitation said Yes please!   chips served warm small basket admittedly quite good  accompanying chipotle salsa also tasty  didn't realize chips salsa $4 complimentary San Diegan accustomed to  couple next attractive bowl guacamole noshing on  wanted same requested it  Loved flavor but wouldn't ordered known $15! quickly ran small portion chips requested some more remaining guacamole  additional $2 chips  fault carefully reading menu but seriously would never expected chips guacamole cost $21!!! would?  We ordered margaritas  $13 each  Glass very small  put tequila margaritas? Tasted if drinking straight lime juice  Gross     Finally ordered dim sum item Sui Mai 6 piece dumpling dish $14   Dumplings very small salty liking  item would probably cost no more $4 typical dim sum restaurant    After parade disappointments decided cut losses treat China Poblano appetizer spot move elsewhere dinner  Unfortunately expensive appetizer experience Around $70+ tip  Overall restaurant just didn't live expectations all  Way overpriced portions even Vegas standards opinion  <EOR> There some tasty things menu but they're spoiled prices  understand restaurant certain amount money each plate but place exceptionally over priced   Tacos good pork buns tasty chips salsa ok   Unless you're bent going try another place  Quality price ratio wack  <EOR> Ok people fusion don't expect traditional taco  Also come LAS VEGAS off course over price! can't pay your rent selling $2 00 tacos! several plates flavor ok but asked cilantro cucumber  play around food just taco truck final result excellent   think restaurant should provide  extra condiments cilantro little servings salsa everyone part joy eating tacos  <EOR> Everything awesome fresh  Must try ants climbing tree noddles 20 veggie fried rice!! <EOR> Excellent Tacos de lengua Baos succulent desert awesome  waiter Kevin top notch super attentive present but overbearing  Extremely knowledgeable food  description desert excellent  The outside decor weird walked wondering if some cheap fast food   Almost did in   but hostesses nice helpful gave try regret contrary  But level cuisine even if deemed simple deserves better decor  Highly recommend when tired crowds long waiting time fancy restaurants  visit every time come Vegas business  <EOR> This review visit mid March  once before food wonderful! Unfortunately time  service left much desired  First when asked waitress margaritas flight experience she referred notes only listed two three said think third this      Did she confirm? No  odd LAZY  little puzzled she wouldn't check   One dishes dan dan mian highly lackluster  No flavor lukewarm just bad  She came back saw barely touched but just take away without asking if anything wrong  interjected saying dish wasn't good others  She responded Yeah   depending night hit miss      I shocked  Does Jose Andres think food HIT MISS? would LOVE hear say standing ear's length  Any chef would highly offended comment    The kicker? She didn't take off bill  took off tip    I won't coming back  any Jose Andres restaurant  Especially if he servers saying food hit miss   Yikes  <EOR> As gathering things touching down McCarren airport main concern course food  I suggested Mexican per usual while friend thinking Chinese  Well imagine surprise when concierge mentioned Mexican Chinese fusion restaurant within very hotel   This your standard Mexican  prepared shell lot money for each very small taco  However somewhat worth it  friends ordered Green Tea Sour cocktails edible marigold while tried new beer Moutai light exactly needed food    I tried Barbacoas Carnitas tacos  Carnitas quite delicious but am quite used consistency pork belly bit shock bite into something so    jelly like    We ordered Twenty vegetable fried rice because apparently some well known foodie list weren't disappointed all   Like all food light incredibly fresh made simple ingredients    For dessert Mango Sticky Rice  Coconut milk boiled cream then added shaved mango and sprinkled crisped rice create something incredible  Loved     decor inside China Poblano was    interesting  steering wheels spanning most ceiling altar buddhas near entrance low ottoman seating red orange color palette      What loved? bar Mexican  Asian inspired dishes  Each incredibly clean each dish served ready if order several things as need to place same emphasis some more traditional dining rules     While enjoyed experience for most part    think would again  definitely great place pop into if bit rush  particularly hungry else $6 per tiny taco just becomes bit annoying  <EOR> I wanted some enchiladas but guess didn't serve any  No problem just order something else  Bad idea    I'd willing compromise say disliking restaurant due denied expectations   However recipes aside food bad basic fundamental ways anyone could understand  started Queso Fundito which super tasty yet just melted cheese idk anyone could mess up  Speaking which literally JUST melted cheese small shallow saucer sized dish why $11? tried 3 different tacos each costing $6  carnitas dry fish rubbery tortillas soggy bottoms fell out  friend ordered Silencio looked she eating taco made arteries  ordered some shrimp mojo $18 eight overcooked shrimp swimming sauce  tasted alright first but each bite overpowering flavor much  didn't taste bad flavor just obnoxious shrimp rubber  tasted some kind sugary tamarindo sauce mixed chili paste but without spice  also ordered some other fried rice dish which look okay until waiter plopped sloppy runny cured egg top  won't say tasted bad but say flavor esoteric meaning taste something many people Vegas going understand enjoy  willing concede waitress did give small warning upon ordering guess fault  However ask why item menu if your staff going discourage people ordering it? restaurant states dish authentically Chinese which give them kudos for  However even sure authentic TRULY due fact Mexican food ANYTHING authentic  honestly could just some overpriced garbage dish being peddled profit  Most people Vegas would rather dish looks daring eat especially when bill came nearly $100  felt episode Fear Factor   All aside basic fundamental ingredients food disappointing say least  I'd rather LA where actual authentic Mexican taco without dry meat soggy tortilla $1 50  <EOR> The food delicious proficiency  customer service needs little more work  Overall greedy experience  <EOR> Had some potstickers noodle dishes OK   bad hotel food but would expect better Las Vegas  <EOR> Probably best meal years  quail egg dimsum absolutely delicious <EOR> Everyone's reviews spot on  place only OK me  tacos small  Chicken Mole Taco gross swimming sauce  Fish taco smelled fishy good sign  friend also extremely ill eating here   chips good but $15 guacamole? better guac place  Margaritas also about$14 pop small  most cosmopolitan    place overpriced  I'd rather run border  <EOR> WTF Jose Andres!  disappointed place feel he just opened restaurant uninspired recipes he found random places slapped name it     There nothing special all going here  7 dishes single excited me   Definitely pass  <EOR> Walking restaurant thought Mexican Chinese infused ingredients food flavor restaurant which would original creative  actuality order dim sum taco same time here    The Mexican food flavorful  guac perfect balance cilantro onion avocado  homemade salsa some kick Mexican meat tender    On other hand sui mai ordered big disappointment  almost point raw tiny compared typical dim sum restaurants  didn't fact just guac then took bit dim sum after    The biggest reason giving place 1 star never coming back seating arrangement  tables foot away each other when place near empty hostess still sat group men table right beside us  close them guy beside flicked menu turning over accident twice  empty tables behind behind friend  only excuse close half restaurant  <EOR> This place everything imagine China Mexican fusion restaurant!! started chips salsa along Dim Sum good!! Then Dan Dan Mian noodles Mojo Shrimp!! Both amazing but if picked favorite would shrimp!!! definitely recommend everyone!! <EOR> Steer clear  No bartender bad if any service  coming every trip Vegas  Since Brandon bartender left down hill ever since  last time hope ladies making dim sum find employment  Sorry ladies <EOR> Looking menu upsetting    I think set mood all wrong   $5 taco $8 FRENCH FRIES size n fries  $12 bowl SOUP POSOLE   Then screw hungry just going order  restaurant located Cosmo second floor believe  casual but pricey  Half restaurant Asian cuisine other half Mexican  came cause looked casual ambience nice colorful casual informal unlike many other eateries Cosmo    Food average great expectations $5 taco $8 fries  French fries just whatever small basket mole taste soy sauce dipping sauce  asked ketchup  NO KETCHUP?? But serve fries just don't understand    Soup all right  Posole  Usually posole but Okay  add bunch limes    The Hawaiian heart Palm salad unique  mom liked cause she never it    Overall would come back again   Only nice thing man gave disclaimer everything tapas style    I love tapas but place eat when you're hungry want good food worth your buck  <EOR> This place Mexican Chinese    hence name  first time really liked atmosphere  very casual considering location  upscale place but same time shorts shirts  services great   queso fundido fried wontons great!! tortillas hand made!! think prices reasonable  Even though only judge appetizers think place worth it  <EOR> Great concept food terrible failure! Fusion done wrong!  We ordered 8 items menu each $10 $15 tapas size  Presentation very pretty but taste just lacks flavor texture  Tofu avocado should same plate duck tongue tacos undercooked slimy  Pear juice super watered down    Jose Andres high hopes  unfortunate  may still try Jaleo but visit giving much encouragement! <EOR> Was little drunk hungry should set great experience but just ended disappointed  Everything really expensive portions small  Very tasty yes but rip off cost  eaten few Andres' restaurants some amazing meals sure didn't click time  know he commands some higher prices but just didn't feel getting good value    On side note pop culture worship famine era Mao wall juxtaposed $50 person dinner struck little insensitive but then again enough time passed since Cultural Revolution gonna do? <EOR> I hate giving negative reviews but place just bad     all great places eat LV should skip one  food good all 4 5 small things menu some sort dumplings fries covered toppings etc  fries worst thing eat 10 day trip  Also service horrendous    I did however excellent margarita <EOR> This place absolute gem must try while Vegas! always put list places eat while here  service impeccable food outstanding  tried over dozen things menu everything delicious  won't disappointed! <EOR> Tapas style Mexican Chinese food not fusion tho! meshing Asian favors Mexican flavors   recommended place but iffy trying because two very different foods same restaurant    wasn't sure if I'd but gave them chance anyways glad did! friend absolutely loved place!!! sat bar started awesome pomegranate margarita topped salted FOAM rather then traditional salted rim  Every dish completely satisfied we're looking forward next trip back Vegas eat again! highly recommend Tuna Ceviche Golden pig BBQ pork buns mango sticky rice dessert   Oh another plus server super friendly outgoing <EOR> $ 4 per taco?? Jeez  atmosphere doesnt warrant much price inflation   laid back   wontons suck overcharge because put gold flake them   Tacos good but $4 good  Salt air margaritas tooo salty  <EOR> We recommendation friend  concept innovative  Chinese Mexican  hot sour soup few other appetizers  thought bit salty very flavorful   but very salty  <EOR> I'm Jose Andres groupie when started going Jaleo DC over 10 years ago  When saw expensive option dining LV last week friend walked right in  20 minute wait but able take seat bar immediately  salt air margarita which FABULOUS  ordered few different dishes tacos pancita carnitas noodles something dim sum menu chips guacamole  food good  ambiance fun  bill margarita truly highlights dinner  Check option upscale fast food if near Cosmopolitan  <EOR> Had lunch few days ago started margarita orange accompanied chips yummy chipotle salsa  Yes pay chips but Cosmo expect pay more everything   Next dim sum selection tender light followed ahi tartare avocado chunks tasty!  Also tried BBQ pork taco marinated onions homemade very thin flour tortilla   return again next time Vegas! <EOR> I even going give place star   service horrible took over 10 minutes someone approach take beverage order then took another 10 minutes drinks which should cue leave   We then ordered chips salsa start which again took forever then why continued order more beyond but did which included queso poblano dip nothing exciting write addition two very small tacos which ok then some potstickers which son said horrible took bit he right   Anyway spare rest just don't recommend going live Vegas could recommend several other places better job    Very disappointed! <EOR> We ended coming because Holstein's crowded didn't want wait    If everything 15% cheaper would giving more stars but portions really small price pay  Granted Vegas everything more expensive but don't think food much better other similarly priced restaurants    With said think food very good really enjoy ambience restaurant    I first little weirded Chinese Mexican combo but reality dishes aren't necessarily fusion dishes but half menu Chinese half Mexican though little flourishes would fusion    There 3 each taco main dish  taco mushrooms crispy pork skin which pretty good also ordered Mexican knife shredded noodle dish which corn truffles mushrooms  very tasty  friends also ordered Dan Dan mien which very similar traditional dan dan mien Chinese restaurant didn't see any fusion aspect also ordered steamed buns  <EOR> Went lunch before left Vegas  Started guacamole which made order table great! taco black bean taco habanero creme fresh  Simple taco but craving already sit airport 20 vegetable fried rice  pretty good more popular items but starting full point  husband ordered lamb pot stickers whoa thought amaze balls  He wanting dipping sauce them but didn't think needed it  crispy lace design gorgeous! husband also brisket taco dan dan noodles  Great service! <EOR> We did chef's tasting menu  really good  only complaint much food!

The $15 guacamole should tip off     waiter swore good   so gave try   I'd say best might slightly above average   Unless its amazingly hard truck avacado into Las Vegas though $15 avacado some lime tomato making killing dish   Next salt pepper tofu  dish best described bland unsatisfying  love some good tofu but good not  Basically 4 pieces tofu doused corn starch fried  Seasoned some salt pepper  small chile garnish but pretty bland didn't give tofu any flavor   $12 88 gem dish  Disapointing   The waiter raved famous fried rice featured food network yada yada  really looking forward it    ok  appreciated vegetables nicely uniformly diced texture but man HEAVY  Very greasy dish   Again $20 expected something bit more sophisticated    My wife Gan Pung Ji Chicken which big bunch averageness $23 00    Another annoying thing place bring your food random times  meant wife done entree before even served mine  waiter explained just restraurant worked  WHAT?! Why? no sense  kind restraurant thinks normal?  Definitely would under no cirumstances eat again  lot other choices vegas provide MUCH better food MUCH better service MUCH better price    To summarize if Vegas want throw away some money  hit tables hit china pablano  tables lot more fun least chance may come ahead  china pablano however gauranteed loser  <EOR> I super stoked check place considering favorite hotel wuv some Chinese Mexican grub       super sad face eating though  food pretty decent but prices absolutely ******RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! basically tapas place don't 'swallow cloud soup' bland  But pigs fly dim sung delish! spent over $75 LUNCH let repeat lunch two people no booze!!

I love fusion cuisine small plate dining much next food geek but price build everything really fell short   chips tortillas tasted store bought or crappily made if actually done in house ceviche tasted borderline 'off' even queso fundido barely mediocre knew could mess      For price buzz heard total let down   great meal couple nice dinner drinks priceless household   But particular dinner two set back around $160 instantly regretted   stopped elsewhere grab much tastier filling bite before heading back room night     My advice grab drink enjoy vibe then move dinner  <EOR> $6 50 mediocre tacos? 20 kinds veggie fried rice $25 add chicken $5= $30 Tiny portion 8 pieces miniscule shrimp $29 shrimp pork dumplings 8pcs $25 beers $8?  Taste flavor so so best  Definitely worth price tag  <EOR> Sit dumpling counter   recommend traditional scallop shu mai  beef weren't good other two amazing   The rice noodles very good  great sized portion   mushroom salad amazing  highly recommend it  <EOR> 3 5 stars  Another tapas like place Cosmopolitan but serving Chinese Mexican food would've thought?   liked place more neighboring Jaleo owned same chef couple reasons Prices more reasonable Food general tastier for taste least It something hybrid between tapas regular entrees some dishes could order sizable enough actually fill Food came faster more casual experience overall  Still going cheapest place find Vegas place I'd dying back but all all interesting place try out  <EOR> We made reservation 3 people way advance seated almost 40 minutes  hostess said because large parties use 4 tops  However seating parties 2 without reservations  asked if 2 tops why push them together  She said could that  ready leave manager came more excuses  However he took table  Magically 2 4 tops open  More excuses  While food OK when start bad taste your mouth hard rid it  <EOR> Jose knocks park again  Everything works place downscale but crisp decor lobster taco Mexicana mommas hammering freshly made tortillas    You might think Chinese Mexican strange mix but food playful creative really tasty  just works flavor profiles fit hand into smooth fitted kid glove    The air salt margarita lemon drop served chopsticks because need them just icing Jose Andres cake <EOR> Yeah pay $5 taco    I am usually very anti fusion   fact operate under rule anyone claims multiple things well does neither well     I love Jose Andres   He's favorite TV type chef people   Anthony Bourdain also favorite TV type people when raves other good sign    I wasn't man enough try duck tongue oyster Taco but hear quite good   pork taco very delicious very appropriate accoutrements pickled onions just right amount bite   wife impressed fish taco but definitely looked good    The brussel sprouts amazing   charred sour notes just made sweetness brussel sprouts pop much more   unbelievable dish don't think could every replicate without being sour burned     The 18 monk noodles something behold  seems simple maybe little expensive but can't just hand tossed noodles anywhere   Also perfect blend salty sweet savory   worried would salty but perfect vegetables provided great textural break     Just spend $5 taco experience  <EOR> Holy crap eat here!

Tasted pozole chilaquiles tacos dimsum fries     all delicious! <EOR> What delightful surprise!  merely wanted quick lunch checking into hotel someone said Chinese Mexican place   tweaked curiosity tried it  food really interesting   best Chinese Mexican but all prepared unique stylish manner   Expensive entree prices small portions but well worth it  <EOR> The foods delicious excellent but portion very little  Therefore would pricey fill your stomach if you're huge eater! 100% recommended must try! <EOR> this place sucked! food salty expensive nothing very very small portions good food i mean better tacos this  its really rip off i mean reallyyyyyy  inhave tried orher restaurants jaleo felt thr exact same way not sure oversalting but when paying upwards $10  single street taco its crap then know basically getting ripped off  explains why place empty  <EOR> Service exceptional hostess showed table quick waitress came quick told restaurant small portions recommended good even manager popped no where offer some club soda friend when he some sauce shirt first time being great sorry all bad waiter waitress   BUT    the food just bad terrible overpriced Chinese Mexican food hoped would least taste good but nah ordered wonton noodle soup honestly screw shit said place overpriced could ordered same bowl 5 times tip local cafe   AND would taste better lol     place bad food come for     the people? ha <EOR> So agree several 3 stars am leaning probably 3 5 but can't quite put 4 down  list  eat visit awhile because its odd Asian Mexican fusion which does seem sense  place itself acid trip videos walls stadium seating bar bike wheels ceiling   The place all small portion sort tapas large meal prices   My meal Dan Dan Mian Noodles $12 really good great flavor great soba noodles sauce  Chilaquiles $13 Which basically tortilla chips sour cream sauce tomatillo type sauce  very close tradition version dish good rich  20 vegetable fried rice $20 best them all great mix veggies eaten such youthful form great flavor   However size overall probably 2 cups   Desert Mango rice $11 which airy very light cream rice flavor cold mangos   Drinks Singapore Sling Traditionally made perfect! where did America Salt Air Margariita Crazy good salt flavored foam   Overall solid meal however bang buck lacking  tip meal 1 over $90 say full end  food good but going order 3 items per person consider meal  <EOR> In location over top Cosmo Las Vegas wife pleasantly surprised lunch here  wouldn't recommend destination dinner but if looking quick meal lighter side very few options around without being stereotype itself   Good food fantastic flavors enthusiastic service  <EOR> First off robbed  Apart way overpriced food surprised see someone forged generous undeserved 30% tip credit card bill when clearly left 15% receipt  Second food mediocre best  started couple signature cocktails which fun creative but worth refilling glasses with  waiter kind willing however recommendations all fell flat palate  While food beautifully presented taste impressive all  started Carnitas tacos which bland extremely oily  Next came Lamb potstickers  lamb filling also seasoned  Lastly ordered food network recommended 20 vegetable dish added shrimp  Again protein bland unseasoned  While rice somewhat tasty something rave about  conclusion meal somewhat shocked see $85 bill amount quality food ordered 2 people  Despite disappointing food waiter nice returned table multiple times check us  believe mainly due fact order took long time arrive  Nevertheless tipped 15% clearly wrote total $100 receipt  Well when checked bank noticed 30% charge instead  calling restaurant today dispute issue  China Poblano overrated overpriced  Coupled billing issue overall experience very disappointing  Needless say giving second try  <EOR> Try 20 vegetable rice! delicious  really enjoyed carnitas tacos Mongolian beef well  Wash down orange margaritas! churro dessert hot chocolate glaze perfect ending very good dinner friends  would come back again  <EOR> It getting late at least still adjusting Eastern time dinner Friday night   decided China Poblano   We're big fans José Andrés restaurants food   However despite multiple trips Las Vegas hadn't yet dined China Poblano   Arriving around little 8PM wait few minutes seating bar come available   After quick look over menu decided keep decision making process simple Chef's Experience tasting menu $45 person Cocktail Experience $32 person    received nice selection food across menu Chips Salsa Tuna Ceviche Spoon Siu Mai Snow Pea Leaf Salad Carnitas Tacos Shrimp Mojo Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice Mango Sticky Rice    Likewise received four tasting sized thankfully cocktails cocktail menu Salt Air Margarita Ma Jade Garden Mezcal Negroni representing both Mexican Chinese elements   also ordered When Pigs Fly steamed barbecue pork buns supplemental item menu which didn't receive   However gracious server brought Churro Oaxacan Hot Chocolate service oversight   completely unnecessary but much appreciated positive reflection restaurant's focus customer satisfaction   Going tasting menu route worked well sample much menu possible without leaving restaurant uncomfortable full and or inebriated   Did China Poblano break any new ground anything better traditional Chinese Mexican restaurants?  much   certainly better Chinese Mexican food elsewhere most cases much lower price   However  misses point China Poblano why dinner   thoroughly enjoyable dining experience honored both Chinese Mexican cuisine thoughtfully conceived well executed food   same outstanding cocktails   However service facet experience truly impressed set China Poblano apart most restaurants  <EOR> We looking place eat Cosmopolitan stumbled upon restaurant interesting concept   seated quickly own table some tables common    If vegetarian much menu mostly everything especially Chinese side pork   very little your money   Siu Mai tiny soups legit but small mexican coke $6   biggest problem food comes different times friends tacos 3 4th way through meal   understand working different kitchens but come on     <EOR> Just China Poblano Noodle wonton soup  broth looks tastes beef broth  noodle crisp chewy  enough vegetable wonton soup supposed be  wonton fair  But overpriced  half portion most chinese restaurnat offer  Definitely need change  If looking authentic Chinese Noodle Dim Sum right place  Stay away Fusion type restaurant  If want good Ehenic foods try fusion restaurant  can't comment Mexican restaurnat side  But attempt based taste Chinese food  <EOR> We visiting Town over Christmas saw place Hotel Channels room  am huge foodie partner place caught eye being GREAT IDEA    My boyfriend LOVES Dim Sum all things Chinese Food while am BBIIGGGG fan Latin Food especially Ceviche    While wandering mall Christmas day stumbled onto spot pure chance decided jump all over it  seated right away initially noticed beautiful decor  Whomever designed inside place really solid idea mind colours bright themes meshes well Asian Mexican fusion    We ordered drink seen ad which Salt Air Margarita  really yummy  Salt Foam really does coat tongue give very different experience far margarita drinking goes     For food ordered Dim Sum Pot Stickers Ceviche plus Taco    Dim Sum Fair  Needed more flavor stuffed enough meat but lacking solid taste   Ceviche Bad  Snapper ceviche  very bland almost no flavor  ask Lime wedges add onto dish give some flavor  ZERO spice am fairly sensitive spicy foods  I'd HIGHLY recommend add some sort cirtus Cevich    Taco Decent  Meat solid taste really tender tortilla grand    Over all really great idea fuse two cuisines just think technique missed mark little  seem carter specific type person doesn't seem explore lot foods would great see them branch add more true flavors   Come drinks  food  <EOR> Though Mexican Chinese fusion food new the same idea done northern Mexican city Monterrey its upscale Chino Latino restaurant restaurant hold its own  decor modern kitsch very inviting  Seating limited night sure reservation  food actually fusion per se asian inspired Mexican dishes served own mixed   order pork dumplings carnitas tacos separately  believe idea lazy but would rather well executed authentic food rather failed attempt some fusion  Cochinita Pibil tacos delicious perfectly seasoned very authentic  taste very similar would eat Yucatan peninsula  course way overpriced served special taco gadget keeps tacos standing to prevent spillage would assume   Barbacoa tacos also very authentic tasting well Pork Belly tacos  also tried 20 vegetable Fried Rice we'd previously seen someone Food Network claim best thing ever ate Las Vegas  would far saying best thing but delicious  Mexican mimosas also very refreshing though no such thing Mexican mimosa     Margaritas other hand modern very tasty salt element done foam instead only rim glass  Inventive great  order Cajeta Flan NOTHING Mexican flan  understand chef trying add own spin traditional dish but believe he should stick he knows best  nice but should named flan more crema catalana a typical dessert Catalunya region Spain   tortillas hand made reall taste difference! back try Asian food  Overall portions tiny prepared order 4 5 per person  cheap same reason  But definitely come back  <EOR> We initially wanted buffet Wicked Spoon but told place closing hour decided check place near instead found China Poblano    personally wonder long restaurant last   did ambiance place   service good timely but food worth price    Okay first off server indicated no scallops no lobster no crab change initial choices   ended Mojo Shrimp Steak Mole plate I forget name sui mai quail eggs sui mai scallop  Mojo Shrimp slightly undercooked tasted doused soy sauce reminding Filipino adobo sauce not good way    sauce super salty   couldn't even finish green beans sauce   Steak Mole plate according eating partner cooked very good but tasted steak local taco places around apartment  live mission SF surrounded very satisfying Mexican food    mole sauce pretty bland  mushrooms onions super salty   sui mai okay   told could scallop sui mai but suspected no scallops it   quail egg sui mai probably favorite   But again live near Chinese restaurant does sui mai wasn't blown away  However quail egg something never tried before wished whole experience that   Eating unique dishes elevated dishes traditionally Mexican Chinese   dishes weren't unique enough price point   dishes overpriced small!  friend ended buying hamburger strawberry milkshake Johnny Rockets afterwards    wouldn't recommend restaurant anyone except deer salt lick  <EOR> Yuk  wouldn't chosen eat regular day but considering only restaurant cosmo didn't $150 prixe fixe menu NYE wants stuff face $150 worth food before dancing ass off NYE??? no choice  made reservation opentable  few days later called take credit card down since party more 8 fine  few days randomly noticed dropped reservation 5 30?! If noticed would've lost space    wtf  Thankfully called able change it    They also set menu which all shell fish pork NO substitute options  Two guests couldn't even eat half food  friends allergic shrimp accidentally ate some didn't benedryl hand    should standard restaurant  asked them comp meal kindly agreed but paid noticed charged makeshift substitutes served    wow thanks nothing!   Last but definitely least food  gross compilation food  worst vomit pepper    literally looked green pepper baby vomit didn't taste much different    Nope nope nope    <EOR> three kitchens everything comes when ready may together ok? Well   not really  ordered 2 tacos hubby Chinese Spare Ribs taco while he just sat long time food came second taco came he through twiddling thumbs  somewhat appreciate honesty but   no   bring same time  guacamole wonderful  order crunchy chips saw just ordered it other tables had  guac alone worth it  Pescado Estilo Baja taco good Carnitas surprise  good idea though if some your party wants Chinese some want Mexican    <EOR> While staying  cosmopolitan lucky enough easy access China poblano  first meal consisted when pigs fly  golden pigs   golden pigs awesome  sweet tender pork filling hint 5 spice think came house made sweetened condensed milk which delish  4 serving  but filling  when pigs fly same filling  only steamed  not fried golden  and came no dipping sauce  pleased  but would liked dip!  Second trip ordered 18 monk noodle   took since solo  I guess because took room  but noodles bit dry  and portion tad bit small  stand both times pork carnitas tacos  filling super juicy came two chicharones inside  could eaten 10  <EOR> I wanted love because Jose Andres totally awesome!  But wasn't good   comment price fine Vegas but kind expecting something great   eat dim sums every week new flavor profile me   Siu Mai very salty couldn't really taste other flavors shrimp Har Gow fine but hot sour soup truly awful didn't resemble anything Chinese flavor thick layer oil top just yucky  <EOR> Who would've thought we'd find best pozole ever little spot inside Cosmopolitan Vegas? server Kevin joked when ordered better your grandmother's  wife stopped last weekend having Jaleo couple days earlier which other restaurant Chef Jose Andres inside Cosmopolitan loved thought wrong? pozole chilaquiles both fantastic but pozole stood huge us  Kevin informed Chef Andres served same pozole Salma Hayek's wedding interesting little tidbit info there  any case if you're pozole fan yourself favor stop in This stuff part your hair tell ya  insane  actually left wishing tried something else but just couldn't force ourselves  There's always next time    Speaking Kevin the guy groovy mustache another Yelper mentioned he helped experience all more better  Right start super friendly vibe he above beyond wife feel old friends stopping own home lunch  He all over never left needing anything  He loves taking care people definitely shows  Stop ask Kevin  He provides five star experience all fronts    Although concept Chinese Mexican food being served side side may seem little odd blissful food coma great service entire team China Poblano made well worth stop  already plan dropping next trip  <EOR> My first time Cosmopolitan hotel hungry upstairs find restaurant!  Got seated right away asked server most popular dishes China menu section he told couple options  Bf ordered dan dan mian kind dry but still delish ordered twenty vegetable fried rice which very delish! I did feel guilty eating dish because full different types vegetables! <EOR> we only decided come because wanted light snack before hitting Bacchanal buffet boy place mistake   first place extremely over priced quality quantity food get         quality wise food extremely salty        quantity super small portion   lotus chips only delicious part entire meal crisp properly seasoned   the rou jia mo sandwich horrible buns fall apart oily  braised pork cut cubes SALTY   seemed braised nothing but soy sauce lack any asian mexican seasoning seems   such disappointment    tuna ceviche lack seasoning initial bite then salt creeps slaps face  50%  nuts filler fufu crap no substantial amount tuna  absolutely disgusting  imagined chinese mexican ceviche taste no explosion flavor lacked acidz    second service server Franco absolutely horrible  he rushing entire time if more people serve place practically empty   he grabbed plates before being finished      manager polite  she ended comping items due bad service food  she's only reason giving 1 star    definitely beware place  <EOR> Super yummy!  I ate lot different stuff here   Tacos pork rolls noodles rice    if anything eat 20 Vegetable Fried Rice ! heard several people   best fried rice EVER! Each bite different super awesome!  Very causal relaxed place great cocktails   Everything ate great! Service great! Seating easy!  Go eat taco fried rice pork buns won't sad! <EOR> My friends hyped place much decent Chinese food but far best had  least prices very decent being cosmopolitan  <EOR> First off food sounds better actually then portion way smaller average finally price really really over priced    The Food isn't really fusion mix food quality so so    The Portion super small salad 4 bites  Pork bun thingy 2 bites Price very expensive 4 bites salad    I understand whole concept quality vs  quantity but doesn't apply quality isn't really quality isn't really there  eating else where find quick bite because still hungry $80 bill lunch   Seriously unless money blow! time eat after! <EOR> Always staple anytime    Expensive but tapas style perfect groups    Asian side amazing   Mexican side also   Silencio tacos bomb  <EOR> Was disappointed visit great concept but ultimately food looked nice but tasted very bland worth price  golden pigs recommended waiter but pork filling literally flavorless just sort gelled consistency surrounded fried dough when dipped sweetened condensed milk ultimately tasted donut  lengua taco ok but really lot flavor  husband envisioned going enjoying variety small flavorful dishes but given price experience taco golden pigs stopped paid there  only ate 2 4 golden pigs hoped waiter would ask if liked but he only asked anything else? just asked check  glad started just two items record ordered them same time hadn't long don't think annoyed waiter  just sad wasn't delicious wouldn't recommend anyone spend money there  <EOR> Best margaritas Vegas!!! guac really good! bartender made special margarita Serrano peppers tamarind! amazing! he should name Lola Margarita     <EOR> Some girlfriends spent weekend 4 20 Vegas   which kinda amazing  But know lacked amazingness? place!  My friend REALLY wanted because she some kind foodie crush dude opened place  head chef  someone important that  all assumed going Mexican Chinese fusion but two sides menu and dishes completely separate   While atmosphere idea both super fun place lacks execution  fan soup while lemon shrimp bomb flavor didn't sit well later!  With many culinary gems city sin suggest indulge elsewhere! <EOR> Really really really wanted love this  came high expectations especially because am fan Jose Andres's style  He creative vision unique restaurant world  kitchen needs see same vision    The layout restaurant stunning  Two bars upon entry left right your direct sight dimsum preparation steamers  creative cocktails choose bar embedded part design hold spoon   then dissapointment began   Without being longwinded Salty! Over priced! Really dissapointing!   This order Viva China* soft beef tendon Kumamoto oysters scallions Sichuan peppercorn sauce  tiny taco only tasty thing but price serious turn off size  Pescado Frito fried fish ancho chile pickled onions taco  again just OKAY doesn't justify cost  Beef 6pc beef lime daikon watermelon radish  DIMSUM better  clincher Shrimp Mojo 8 pc shrimp sweet black garlic roasted poblano peppers  Salty  I don't know if kitchen off day but rarely send things back salt content powerful just say something  dish made fresh again sad say nothing changed   Our bill approximately $110 left starved second meal wasn't going leave high blood pressure  understand good quality justify higher priced cuisine but portion sizes abnoxious  should even slightly price give two tacos instead! Eating your eyes first step dining experience left hungry    I definitely continue visit Jose Andres's other projects but stay away China Poblano Cosmo when Blue Ribbon sushi satisfies lot more same price range!! <EOR> The verdict place   identity crisis?

Jose Andres flair menu but CP just doesn't feel special enough match food   simple space w almost fast food feel it    half expected counter order   Gladly did waiter service waiter pretty great  answering all questions coming check quite often    The food prices also don't warrant casualness   spent $70 half 'casual' meal which well worth terms food BUT price I'd enjoy dinner space feel warrants amount know mean?   As food duck tongue taco pork belly sandwich standouts  thought everything very good but noodle dish rather 'meh' also didn't quite see hoopla fish taco  fell kinda flat w much flavor     I'd also skip desserts   very lackluster    All all sure I'd return   save your $ Bazaar LA where true JA style shines through IMHO  <EOR> From gather China Poblano supposed fusion restaurant  fusing flavors China Mexico   But poorly executed   There's no fusion it   Chinese dishes come kitchen Mexican dishes come another   But they're completely separate concepts mishmashed into loud restaurant   Nothing blew any away   but check sure did   gather supposed served tapas style   but pretty sure takes away part love best eating Chinese Mexican foods over indulgence cheap   China Poblano misses mark  <EOR> Andre!s master providing delicious food fun environment very reasonable prices  usually sit counter bar order Modelo Negra just anything off menu since never failed delicious  <EOR> If Yelp  5 stars would 3 5 5   Food ate Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings Salty but flavor  Dan Dan Mian Noodles good flavorful but again really salty   While ordered two light dishes both saltier side  While high potential place wish redo menu more creative side concept interesting concept but results somewhat bland    <EOR> This place amazing perfect service even better food! I'd recommend lotus chips carnitas tacos when pigs fly 20 vegetable fried rice! <EOR> Very meh  Super meh  Everything lacked flavor would stick traditional Chinese food    Had pea leaf salad good but tasted every other Asian house salad anywhere Sui Mai trio best thing most likely crispy Buddha spring rolls they egg rolls asparagus twenty vegetable fried rice tasted regular fried rice Ants Log pretty good spicy cellophane noodles but nothing stuck amazing  Siu Mai extremely tiny but most flavorful   Our dessert best part night  churro which okay came glass hot chocolate  But mango sticky rice mango jelly cinnamon Rice Krispies ? cream  Bomb    Also everything dressed wilted watercress plates very small  server Angie very nice well    Tip if want better table would request ahead time  seated somewhere else asked move there's lot hidden corners restaurant wouldn't good entertaining  <EOR> Came friends quick dinner   Note reservation if plan Saturday night!  wait crazy long but luckily able sit bar   didn't really know kind food served wasn't put off fact didn't serve Mexican Chinese fusion some other reviewers     We ordered 1 Chips Salsa Nothing special but good 2 Carnitas Tacos Tasty moist messy   for least   liked pork grind  3 Gan Pung Ji Chicken best fried chicken while!  really liked spicy chili sauce most! 4 Sui Mai Beef lime daikon watermelon radish good but nothing write home about  5 Mango rice pudding dessert I can't remember name really yummy!  ordered another dessert chocolate figurine top ginger ice cream but waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better    This place little pricy side Mexican Chinese food warned   I'd come back again but just Saturday night  <EOR> Mediocre meal did wow factor hoping for    To start hostess attempted seat client both business suits obviously business lunch communal table where she said would probably joined other diners but okay because everyone family  glanced around restaurant noticed lots open two seater tables kindly requested private table since business lunch   hostess seemed bit flustered request but did let eat own table offering bar instead which declined     We tried chips salsa queso fundido langosta tacos lobster mongolian beef lettuce   best part meal lobster tacos   actually very tasty although small side   Everything else     expected such well known chef   There's just much say besides just being mediocre food   Both decided memorable meal expecting   all dining choices Cosmopolitan certainly try another option next time  <EOR> A total disappointment   Food bland small   expect need least 3 dishes per person minimum $30 person eh meal   concept good idea but backless chairs very small tapas style cuisine mediocre food would skip  <EOR> ***3 5 STARS***  Enjoyed it   Menu could still use little refining but amidst overpriced nature Strip place exciting food reasonable price   A few thoughts love decor inside   funky fun highlighted chinese fertility dolls middle center which also where people sit while waiting table  cocktails great   salt drink described others phenomenal  excellent service   Ali waiter attentive just very nice dude    And food really unique mix flavors   Loved tuna ceviche dish   Also eggplant really different in good way loved consistency it   If give place few suggestions would be little less red meat pork menu tacos described others little greasy while eggplant itself cooked very well sauce little heavy   Lastly CHIPS SALSA   Some best ever had  <EOR> Yummy food friendly service  Good amount vegan choices  I'd back  Try tacos 20 veggie rice  <EOR> Sat bar excellent service!

I've eaten China Poblano twice good opportunity try lot menu   real standouts fresh margaritas siu mai sampler garlic glass noodles spicy green beans guacamole best all mango sticky rice dessert which light fluffy version Asian cult classic    Tip Sit kitchen bar entertained while flip homemade tortillas  try visit between lunch dinner avoid rush! <EOR> I loved place!!! just moved Vegas Nebraska wanted try something different     sure different! husband birthday  ordered chef's tour  $55 00 person but 10 course meal  all very small but end both stuffed! Amazing flavors great staff made reservations right in  would recommend anyone!! <EOR> This place good! tapas everything small plate but everything tried absolutely delicious  Tableside guacamole amazing lamb dumplings husband's favorite  tried black bean tacos salad Hawaiian palm hearts  experimenting vegan diet place more accommodating plenty options  Definitely pricey side but being Vegas food excellent service exceptional felt worth it  Definitely check out! <EOR> This restaurant metaphor Vegas itself stylish point distraction creative wonderful conceptually absurdly overpriced  just every other Vegas restaurant eaten food just seems quite wonderful should be  case point dinner couple nights earlier Palm  eaten Palm  100 times probably 10 cities its always consistently excellent  Vegas good  whatever reason presumably quality ingredients desert yet holy shit thats good! moment dining Vegas even very finest places   Anyway back China Poblano  menu really interesting just everything sounds great  could probably eat half dozen times excited trying new things  3 dishes lamb potstickers which good  Beautifully unusually presented under fried disk something which frankly no idea was  edible marigolds top added own interesting flavor note It good basically Vegas thing where sounds awesome looks awesome but just tastes good  dan dan noodles  Also magnificently presented very rich flavor something different usual version  hand cut noodles distinct wonderful texture  taste good  Just good  braised pork tenderloin special  very complex dish meltingly soft tenderloin crispy outside chewy inside fried plantains added perfect sweetness complex mole type sauce some diced fruit not sure some couscous  very good   Now back eating half dozen times yes could but better bring big bankroll  3 dishes as recommend which just right amount although could eaten more light eater probably would leftovers  bill beer $60  While wouldn't same innovative versions order potstickers dan dan noodles roast pork similar portion size similar quality along beer would well under half fine Chinese place    If food wonderful concept presentation I'd love place even absurd prices  2 drinks or some wine more dish I'd pushing $100 casual meal but if its fabulous it  But haven't hit its just another line super creative insanely stylish but meh food restaurants defines Vegas  I'd back and say couldn't possibly think better hangover menu but only because its Vegas and I'd hope comp someone else buying! <EOR> We ended 4 00pm afternoon weekday being turned away both Buffet Cosmopolitan Holsteins   no idea why both closed but regardless 3rd choice dining massively hungry husband busy day running around town all day   As others said every dish except some salads noodle dishes served small plates   Everything massively overpriced however if ordering regular entrees   fan José Andrés since saw 60 minutes last year Anthony Bourdain's Washington DC show activism regarding Child Nutrition Act through Congress recently   He much heart passion food he serves made want come visit restaurants Cosmo eventually   didn't really see heart passion China Poblano   Concept wise cool but execution food doesn't really work   We tried both Chinese Mexican side menu   When Pigs Fly just steamed pork buns   husband ordered liked them but felt weren't memorable   He still misses pork buns Pike Place Market used all time   Har Gau ordered tiny   shrimp okay but because smaller pinky chopped fine believe flavor suffered   supposed pork belly but could taste it   Pancita al Pastor Tacos husband ordered thought highlight meal   bite thought okay favorite part fresh pineapple   Queso Fundido just melted cheese roasted poblanos   While good nothing remarkable it   menu stated supposed white tequila could taste it   Again favorite part poblanos but wish more   Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice okay ordered because concept twenty vegetables intrigued me   thought maybe would rice extremely light fresh   While presentation pretty see picture posted found execution rice very heavy greasy   kind disappointment   happy see added some silky tofu dish obviously created vegans vegetarians mind   inflated price almost $17 00 most expensive overpriced dish meal   My husband's barber apparently cuts hair manager restaurant  While no idea restaurants casinos operate he does work directly under José Andrés but Cosmopolitan directly   might where disconnect far quality food versus price such well known celebrity chef   Maybe José Andrés should visit Vegas more often sure staff knows cook food he puts name seen Charlie Palmer done restaurants when he comes visit every month so  <EOR> China Poblano fun place both Chinese Mexican items same menu   can't wrong chips salsa pork tacos any them vegetable fried rice you add chicken if you'd like    really sure why place doesn't higher star rating always liked it   Didn't take pictures visit but hope future visit  <EOR> Very random mix Chinese Mexican food but really good  food comes all different times which weird because everybody gets food eat together  <EOR> This place surprisingly good!!! Mongolian beef romaine lettuce meal super tasty  meet thick tender cooked perfectly  also carnitas burrito which phenomenal  prices very reasonable well  definitely come again  <EOR> The service awesome   food very different but excellent   Chilaquiles   Super! also Fried Wonton  If wonton good   definitely come back  <EOR> I seriously trying eat years but always really long wait without reservation   and course never smart enough reservation   girls needed quick dinner rather early hoping would no wait   Luckily right   When first sat down bus boy brought water immediately but then no came over seemed 20 minutes   eventually flag waiter down very apologetic proceeded provide best service ever!  only server very attentive rest staff   Even hostess came point check which found rather strange but funny all same time lol     We started fried lotus chips mole sauce   Just FYI fried lotus chips come mole sauce   waiter offered making wait believe sure am glad he did   fried lotus chips good but bit plain   However mole sauce delicious!  girls ordered pozole rojo which good but nothing compared caldo tlalpeño other girl ordered   caldo tlalpeño flavorful hard believe only soup   Here's warning if cannot take spice then caldo tlalpeño definitely you   Sorry sucker lol   ordered each lengua taco barbarcoa taco which both delightful   Lastly shared order diver scallops green beans XO sauce   love scallops green beans XO sauce   however tad salty   mostly XO sauce made due getting much sauce each bite which worked nicely     Finally forgetting waiter brought complimentary dessert mango sticky rice   love dessert anyway pretty excited when he brought but course twist it   Normally doesn't come whipped cream top but did seemed crispy rice treats inside   Anyway don't normally eat whipped cream since fattening but figured hey vacation   live little!  man am glad did!  Yum! <EOR> My coworkers ate recently while town conference   several times think best experience   Chef's Experience tour of China Mexico's favorite traditional modern flavors   menu when previously   much good food awesome never ending     We started salt air margaritas   tried pomegranate delicious   am margaritas normally but good     I think dishes had   All delicious    Guacamole made one one queso fresco fresh tortillas Cochinita Yucatan style pit barbecue pork marinated onions  When Pigs Fly 4pc delicate steamed buns Chinese barbecue pork Siu Mai Traditional 6pc shrimp pork jicama mushrooms peanuts  Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice fresh vegetables fried rice  Tuna Ceviche tuna amaranth seeds soy sauce pecans Churos chocolate sauce  I think few other dishes more dessert   good   definitely back  <EOR> So good!

SAD SAD SAD whether noodles pulled restaurant all around disappointing meal  <EOR> Have ever eat trash pay ? Well spot if know Mexican food Born Mexican know food horrible just looking prices  food pathetic prices insane 15 dollars chips guacamole come man   spends 5 dollars gourmet taco should gourtrash nothing special please step should've Golden Arches gourmet Big Mac <EOR> We seated pretty quickly table 7 7pm without having reservation two very hospitable staff  4 days Vegas first positive vibe picked front house staff very humble gracious genuine welcome change few other restaurants ate at    Despite warm welcome left sitting without visit server least 10 minutes  most restaurants would fine if just slightly annoying  But here's why much bigger problem China Poblano menu should order isn't easily decipherable without bit guidance or having before     I'd suggest managers CP staff seats stick around extra 15 give two line spiel menu divided portion sizes what's shareable shareable recommended quantity order per person  all started confuse each other actually started discuss leaving somewhere bit easier we're in vacation mode brains    Our server came just time before left explained all worked but then left proceeded give another 10 minutes ponder life well food order  He didn't take drink order  end sat 20 minutes before even drink order in  almost impossible sit anywhere Vegas long without being offered drink    Orders food starts rolling pretty much immediately  Highlights were Queso fundido Lucky 6 Siu Mai Gan pung ji chicken table fave Carnitas taco Chipotle salsa  Lowlights Viva china taco Lamb pot stickers Guacamole tasty enough but poor value few mix ups service some people didn't tacos till rest table pretty much done food  chalked shared plates approach but bit more attention could easily saved upset ignored diner  also missing side monk chilli sauce which ordered because still very curious WTF would actually be    Loved decor restaurant felt music very well selected  really sure choice project picture Frida Kahlo same time Chairman Mao  When take into account political decisions responsible 40 70 million unnecessary deaths      Maybe art irony dunno  certainly sparked conversation table where concluded designer probably more into superficiality icon Mao Che rather politics fact he's pretty much greatest modern mass murderers  we're looking while eating  Las Vegas  Ok maybe irony  Unintentional irony? Moving along     TL DR version interesting spot food generally tasty found priced pretty reasonably few exceptions  menu could use bit more explanation ideally immediately upon arrival table service could bit tighter attentive    I also think menu would benefit being slimmed down few items then perhaps divided portion size  <EOR> After looking other reviews skeptic place would but gave try based menu  glad despite others bad experiences because fantastic  18 noodle Mongolian Beef Lettuce both incredible  If you're looking full going cost lot but if you're looking try few things tapas style fantastic  highly recommend it  <EOR> The art decor restaurant drew in  greeted promptly seated quickly well    Our server Ali seemed confident attentive  gave reins ordering food us    The carnitas taco amazing! boyfriend Mexican himself he gave thumbs up  server also sent tuna ceviche favors bright refreshing   star lunch golden pigs  big fan steamed buns far best ever had  Sweet tender pork soft squishy hot bun dipping sauce icing cake    We time crunch he quickly  surprised attentive he checked during each dish  <EOR> We visited spot October its late post just because totally forgot spot really wanted forget!

The concept creative because lot options drinks menu looked good but food itself just mediocre  Maybe coming California set standard high Asian Mexican food but place little expensive just mediocrity  <EOR> It hard wrong noodles    China Poblano achieved it!!!

Did mention digital painting wall alternated between portrait Frida Khalo Dalai Lama? sculpture roughly shape human head protruding back wall onto which projected digital images Kim Jong il?  OK now right?  I agree other reviewers wish more fusion dishes   disappointed majority menu items Chinese Mexican but both   most food just average   Good but great   yes ridulously over priced  But hip restaurant arguably hottest casino hotel strip right now expected  now those still reading rundown ordered   Guacamole husband made comment even best guac he eaten day   am big fan stuff general but would see some kind twist something easy home worth ordering here   Maybe little five spice powder some ginger Asian influence   listening José Andrés? really need serve chips   Those tortillas pretty darn good but texture thing   Pot stickers Beautiful presentation   Really just gorgeous  even took picture   truly enjoyed flavors cool twist lamb instead traditional pork   But where sauce? Everyone knows best part eating pot stickers sauce  another little thing just made dish seem lacking also missed opportunity bring fusion experience little chimichurri mole sauce dipping? Hello? Coctel de Camarones disappointed dish can't even tell you   those ever true cocteles authentic Mexican seafood place just don't bother   If type enjoys salsa jar then might it   Once again though missing accompaniment  Traditionally dish served saltine crackers tostada shells  However when asked waitress if could some chips something eat she said supposed eat spoon gazpacho  wtf?  Chilaquiles dish authentically Mexican but really enjoyed it   husband apparently ordered without reading description did not  He expecting red sauce instead green but loved tangy tomatillo salsa cheese delish  But agreed really should meat eggs there  chips really cooked into dish more nachos anything else   Mole tacos both liked though little bland   guess everyone likes spicy but expecting least little heat   Gourmet tacos pretty common where live wasn't surprised price size but meh better   Palmitos salad saved day me   truly special   love hearts palm but weren't limp white tubes jar   Crisp fresh mixed other equally fresh julienned vegetables hearty satisfying salad   But dressing really blew mind   Sweet sour strong tamarind flavor   tasted those Mexican tamarindo candies    except more crisp organic   whole dish just clean brisk   know everyone's palate same someone else might find strong lot fresh lime juice definitely some kind chile   But perfect me  may return place just salad    if mood some ethnic Vegas style kitsch  <EOR> Everything place great  liked whole setup decor concept  Service fast superb chips guac tasted really good  bring all utensils guac front ask spicy you'd prefer it  All drinks yummy  presentation everything clean nicely prepared  first only mexican chinese combined restaurant really didn't know expect  thought place going mexican chinese food fusion type place but literally mexican food dim sum    The flavors everything great  ordered lots dim sum everything A1 This actually first time trying dim sum too   favorite traditional Siu Mai Har Gow  other favorites Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings  chicken wings kind spicy fried rice good well  Just wished option add chicken meat would've perfect    Dessert best part  mango sticky rice really sweet but whip cream really complimented cold mango  churros   Probably best churros tasted life  Nice hot crispy  didn't dip chocolate sauce cause didn't want heart attack but man desserts good   Overall solid place!
