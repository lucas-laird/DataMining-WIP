Saw some reviews but probably unjust  love place  Especially having bad experience another rival location  Bought $25 worth food tastes very good! <EOR> It pretty average 3 stars seems right me  spicy chicken sandwich barely tasted different regular would  fries very splendid however ranch dipped seemed old <EOR> This review Wendy's inside MCCarran Airport Las Vegas  some strange reason Wendy's location freaking amazing when there  pretty certain best Wendy's ever had  Pretzel Bacon Burger wife some sort breakfast flatbread sandwich  Everything tasted remarkably fresh bacon perfectly crispy  very surprising experience    Honestly food quality more sit down restaurant fast food joint   Generally Wendy's well enough  But far beyond other experiences chain much felt compelled give them Internet thumbs up  don't know if location always good but wow   unexpectedly exceptional especially airport restaurant   I did notice few reviews airport Wendy's 2011 fairly poor   wonder if management different now?  sure what's changed but place pure greatness when August 2013   <EOR> Good location fast  BUT sore stomach diarrhea having lemonade   some staff keeps coughing very loud back while sitting outside   Oh well   not going back again guess  <EOR> Standard Wendy's fast food   Nothing more nothing less   Visit brief uneventful  <EOR> I happy Wendy's airport therefore could eat some decent food but happiness short lived   The prices astonishingly high  Now understand airport food always more expensive but $5 69 cheeseburger seems slightly excessive you're getting  best deal 5 piece crispy chicken nuggets $2 49 each  nothing else remotely worth noting inexpensive standpoint   My low review  given happiness most fast food locations  stems many factors    Firstly service  service fast guess should but lacking any sort human emotion   I guess normal most airport places  also did receive any indication grated cheese chili would 30 cents extra which would nice warn most Wendy's don't charge!     Secondly food  food decent but standards just didn't seem high normal Wendy's locations  burger hastily put together complete mess mayo ketchup some pickles slopped in    Third accuracy  clearly ordered  and repeated cashier repeated  3 orders aforementioned nuggets but ultimately only received two as indicated receipt   major bummer when don't enough nuggets your day ruined   Plus also ordered hamburger without cheese without mayo lo behold came only mayo cheese BUT ALSO bacon  seems just completely mixed sandwiches something feel kind bad person expecting bacon cheeseburger instead getting regular hamburger   In end could believe walking away Wendy's less great experience  Wendy's go to sadly failed  case happens Vegas DOESN'T stay Vegas  world must know Wendy's lame  <EOR> If eat airport usually Wendy's   Sure twice expensive normal Wendy's but beats other restaurants here   Employees all friendly   Plus free drink refill!!! <EOR> Literally bunch old lady morons  Waited 15 minutes filled 11 others people's orders ordered me  didn't even realize skipped order only did because everyone else GONE staring idiots down  No wonder broads work here  Absolutely no brains  deserve less minimum wage  Can't even handle fast food  <EOR> Interesting pricing Wendy's  suppose expected airport though  forgive it    The food surprisingly good fast food  fries hot fresh  ordered double  good  huge  When say half pound mean that  <EOR> This far BEST Wendy's to  10pm young man waited very helpful very nice  food hot very fresh  prices more expensive?  Yes   But people your airport course opinion well worth paying bit more rather car look place eat navigation drive there  wanted eat car head straight home 3 hour drive  <EOR> Nice looking location but refuse honor T Mobile Tuesday deals all other Wendy's  <EOR> Twice price half quality  Cold fries poor burger execution  Bad experience  <EOR> Incredibly overpriced even airport    2 cheeseburgers coke = $15   Servers generally friendly   Food hot fresh   Limited seating might table during busy hours   I've stopped several times just convenience but prices pretty absurd  <EOR> As all fast food places lake f vegetarian choices found   terminal only restaurant Wendy's  feel lack options besides abundance clothing shop stores 'news papers stands'   Having only option healthy Little disappointing Come Wendy's time pick your game  <EOR> Juice watered down chicken nuggets greasy fries Horrible!!! <EOR> This best Wendy's could develop breakfast?  made long McDonald's   Meal Breakfast   Ambiance Filthy food court   Crowd Sweat pants everywhere   Menu American fast food   Service Contemptuous   Food Ordered Artisan egg sandwich seasoned homestyle potatoes orange juice   Food Quality artisan egg sandwich tasted grease bread   potatoes tasted grease spice   Finally orange juice revolting       Value Poor half price  <EOR> Overpriced  Register folks don't smile demonstrate no caring service   Waiting time order slow   Accuracy order more likely accurate ordered 3 times separate occasions each time wrong    Options food unfortunately limited elsewhere area captive audience   Sad   Airport authority should boot replace better alternative  <EOR> This friendliest most thorough service ever received airport chain  food hot order accurate accepted Wendy's mobile coupons manager greeted cashier seemed enthusiastic being helpful  Very impressive! <EOR> James Wendy's fantastic!
