Sadly though appears though location closing down = sign lobby directing patrons frequent Paradise Rd location future  guess means end Ruth's Chris dinners Vegas since refuse return other location  http www yelp com biz ruths chris steak house las vegas 2#hrid YfjHw0PU2ZRJiE4yItk5EQ <EOR> They update place! ambiance location par Sizzler's  Fortunately meal good   What Had Party three 2 orders crab salad Awesome!
