NOTE Yelp two listings business but even submitting edits remove merge them  other page under Jin Jin Wei  sure deal if  just translation  Former space occupied Island Malaysian #2 same building Ichiza   Now  way    Went grab takeout only customer dinner 7PM weekday  Small order took literally half hour come food mediocre   Ordered steamed dumplings lamb pancake  Dumplings mushy overcooked bland  Taste appearance identical you'd frozen bag grocery store boiling yourself  Pancake contained small portion flavorful lamb bad overshadowed all grease  Opened takeout box puddle oil  picked pancake all over hands bit mouthful too  Gross!  Service dismal best  only customer wait time unacceptable no excuse apology given  found frustrating dumplings only come 10 order cannot mixed matched other flavors styles  thought reasonable request possibly should consider light lack customers new business  Server barely spoke even when dropping off picking bill  <EOR> yum  Very authentic great price service excellent  friendly <EOR> Simple menu plenty variety  Liked spicy beef noodle soup alot back try more  <EOR> Try spicy noodle soup  Nice flavors  Soy milk fresh warm delicious  definitely come again breakfast  <EOR> Come lamb beef!!
