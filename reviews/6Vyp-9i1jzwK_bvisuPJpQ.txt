Definitely going back  If want spend money lunch rather Red Lobsters   <EOR> I Cajun lobster sub whatever   amazing understatement  could eat every day! <EOR> This place gets eh effort  friend ordered some things we staying Planet Hollywood planning eat room    We waited around 15 20 minutes food then rooms  When back realized missed 2 lobsicle orders worth half order   So back down ask them  comped drinks which nice  wasn't nice overlooked grilled lobster tails size index finger served plain cabbage undoubtedly imitation butter   The rest food signature lobster roll loaded crab fries ok if tad salty  also some crab shell fragments fries pleasant bite into   The people working nice but still wouldn't return quality food price and Vegas definitely lot better   <EOR> I stumbled across place whilst walking through Miracle Mile during vacation last year     Frozen icy alcoholic beverage hand empty stomach meant no chance would past place without buying something  little bit alcohol your body always craves something fried greasy better way sate craving fried lobster meat fries ??  Granted quite expensive snack still cheap if you're Australia used paying pound flesh when comes anything seafood ! would come back if passing through Planet Hollywood need quick snack! <EOR> A friend mine recently moved Maine torturing via social media constant pictures lobster rolls  Did know Bangor vending machines sell lobster dirt cheap restocked daily?!  crazy!  Lobster doesn't vending machines but lobster rolls stick classic Original Maine style touch mayo spices dare try new Beltway version Old Bay shallots chives breadcrumbs  Anything else blasphemous    If you're really feeling daring add chowder fries drink extra $6 they're chili cheese fries but chowder instead chili plus green onions bacon bits  They're downright intoxicating if calories spare   Bonus star quick service 20% off local discount smallish hot dog sized but meaty roll $17 which actually par pricing other landlocked states so minimal Strip markup? but discount especially nice  $20 lunch which pretty much minimum Strip quality actually really good food court style setting  <EOR> Tried Cajun Lobster Roll Lobster Tacos Lobster Mac Cheese    family enjoyed all if!

All good  Between cheese fries mac cheese preferred mac cheese  just seemed lesser two evils! Haha   I believe cashier server named Ronnie she super helpful! Definitely hit spot hankering some lobster everything  <EOR> The pics look good but really just ok  Lobster flavorless due fact lobster meat previously frozen fresh  Nonexistent flavor  Freshness Would've made world difference  Considering more fast food really pricey  $16 lobster roll $12 lobster Mac n cheese not baked anything neat just plain ol Mac n cheese lobster meat thrown top eh  Eh  <EOR> I super love grilled lobster tail here  flavorful yummy   $14 without tax 1 tail think worth price  also clam chowder which good too  <EOR> Had lunch today husband   ordered Diablo lobster roll lobster mac cheese 24 oz Corona beer   cost $18 $12 10 plus tax   goodness $10 beer???  nice restaurants only charge $6 7   lobster roll small looks more 1 2 serving ridiculous charge $18   lobster mac cheese also very small some bits chopped lobster bits   no cheese mac cheese could taste  lobster roll tasted good but portion just crazy little   Won't coming back  <EOR> It's $18 lobster chips slaw really good but worth price? If really wanted lobster pay $6 more some neighboring restaurants whole lobster     But if fan lobster rolls like am philly cheese steaks then worth getting then calling done  <EOR> Very good lobster rolls  bit pricey loster meat cold  Baguettes warm though  Worth try but similar quality less price but hey Vegas  <EOR> I ordered 2 lobster tacos   would lobster meat little warmer but still enjoyable   kid's mac cheese great   also ordered bread bowl cup clam chowder take home   clam chowder very watery thick all would check if plan order it   Very friendly staff  <EOR> Good service!

More seasoned ones East Coast but very flavorful sweet tender Lobster!   The others tried all pretty simple plain   just butter maybe touch mayo   don't need much more great roll!  But Lob does nice spice rub lobster adds great taste without being distracting     I saw also cajun rub which might good   gives reason come back try it!
