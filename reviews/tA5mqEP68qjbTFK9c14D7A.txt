Not cup tea  Although many other reviews people seem place  saying bad but am very particular hot pots garlic sauce similar boiling points condiments   This place does serve good food looks delicious but am sauce person similar joy pot popcorn chicken sweet sour spicy sauce  Something along lines flavorful taste don't just taste fried chicken breast   It may due many Asian fusion places area  Living SGV San Gabriel Valley which leaves drastic opinion based things others may even care for  But overall presentation quality pretty good but would come back  <EOR> One favorite restaurant dinner    especially during colder weather    owner Wendy staff Kevin always super!!

However dove further noticed much pickled mustard soup   What's point calling Sour Pickled Mustard Lamb Pot if there's much main ingredient present?  server came shut off fire didn't really hear when suggested lowering instead  Or perhaps lowering wasn't option? result soup cold quickly   Therefore don't really want drink broth when you're done   accompanying Minced Pork Rice really small portion would cost $2 more another bowl   chose medium spice level wasn't spicy     We also ordered Taiwanese Pork Hocks Stew $5 99    Biggest mistake ever   driest toughest ham hocks ever had   term 'stew' misleading because tender all! could barely pull any edible bits off needed some major flossing when done attempting extract some meat off those things   Another appetizer tried Fried Stinky Tofu $5 99    Average really stinky memorable   should mention Sweet Potato Fries $5 99 also menu totally random opinion   looked around many people finished order it   Overall Pot Tea Social House okay food experience   guess would back again if lazy drive down Spring Mountain   Side note loyalty stamp card   Buy 10 hot pots 1 free  <EOR> A friend told place  Finally came over today check out  Everyone friendly warm  pot special made container  ordered fried chicken sticky fried tofu spicy tofu pot  pot full items both stew pork rice vermicelli noodle  taste reminds Taiwan!

The last time friends also ordered Lobster hot pot  huge tail sticking hot pot! cool! But probably because nature being hot pot tail eventually became overcooked chewy  But can't complain   lobster tail sitting boiling hot soup long time   course it'll chewy   The only thing complain is #1 am used eating hot pot more variety sauces   having sesame oil minced garlic sweet asian bbq sauce   etc   mix own concoction sauce place doesn't give option  only choice sauce soysauce    #1 complaint is   prefer broth bit sweeter  broth Pot Tea Social House more salty side  But  just personal preference  fiance loves salty he no qualms broth all!  Overall clean tasty here  come back   coming back!  Boba hot pot   genius! <EOR> Found cutest fusion hot pot place super nice area  recommend place because food super yummy! Kimchi pot friends Rib Eye Miso Pots  enjoyed soup although only thing didn't enjoy asked if switch meat more veggies but said no would charge  didn't understand because bottom menu under add ons meat cost veggies  Regardless just kept beef soup  Over all tasty soup included clams crabs generous amount tofu would recommend place around 11 am left 12 30 only 3 tables filled but think because early Tuesday! <EOR> I restaurant several reasons 1  Taiwanese broth very good salty perfect eat minced rice noodles 2  Service fast friendly  3  popcorn chicken crispy tasty looked! 4  interior design nice   Try around noon faster service  <EOR> I really dying Pot Tea seeing I'd drive past ALL TIME  Because Brian P  doesn't eat seafood any kind once he town decided take 3 siblings lunch stormy hot pot sort day 07 05 14   Now sisters really picky  Because other two substantially younger copy us  sister turned nose everything menu did they   ended 3 orders popcorn chicken $5 99 piece BOGO boba younger two 1 Taiwanese beef hot pot $11 99   My hot pot okay  really full both younger two kids each ended liking tried  think because novel made big deal all different stuff pot    So why 2 stars? chicken tasted straight RANCID  $18 worth popcorn chicken should pretty great  Plus isn't popcorn chicken those high turnover items? Did think wouldn't notice  chicken supposed taste? really questionably bad especially because could taste rancid flavor despite being deep fried piping hot  Imagine smell chicken gone bad  Now eat smell   tasted   Unfortunately due popocorn chicken repeat business  <EOR> Good food atmosphere  Highly recommended if craving some good hot pot soup popcorn chicken  <EOR> We looking around town spot served stinky tofu because friends weird experience trying thought would funny see could handle it  Can't say good bad lol but tolerable  Would order again but glad say tried it!

Juni very attentive asks more 3 times food anything he us!!   4 5 stars interior  Very clean neat spacious environment dine in    3 stars food  Other popcorn chicken other food mediocre  broth hot pots light portion poor  <EOR> Food ordered chicken which yummy  Reminded Chinese crispy pork flavor some reason   I Japanese miso spicy level medium   thought good sized portion variety vegetables some seafood pork  also ordered extra side beef which thought also good sized portion  If spicy didn't think medium level spicy either   Drinks plain black tea which loved  boyfriend lychee tea which sweet super good!  We also strawberry tea which wasn't sweet but alright  liked lychee tea best   Service The service just alright  came later night around 9 server pretty preoccupied sweeping floors   Other everything great! Would definitely come back again!! <EOR> Vegas second home when heard Pot Tea really excited something Boiling Point Vegas  first time ordered rib eye loved it  loaded veggies beef flavor clean  Recently ordered seafood pot just tad disappointed  seems portion gotten smaller  still good but higher price no complementary drink lunch don't think worth it    I option substitute pork beef since don't eat pork much  <EOR> I came few weeks ago friend enjoyed hot pots ordered  believe friend ordered ribeye hot pot looked she enjoyed it  ordered seafood tofu hot pot some Ramen noodles side plus also comes some steamed rice ground pork top  Hot Pot itself priced 12 bucks bad deal! came sliced meat fish balls crab shrimp mussels etc just really tasty Hot Pot small enough person some leftovers well  total hot pot extra noodles plus tip waiter around 20 bucks! definitely back more hot pot yumminess! <EOR> YASSSSS!  I happy find Taiwanese styled hot pot place Vegas  If you're ever area looking delicious hot pot meal I'd definitely reccomend Pot Tea Social House   Service? POINT! super awesome!  I ordered Rib Eye Beef Pot pork rice Chicken Wings  Rib Eye Beef delicious! However overshadowed side rice pork top it    I tried chicken wings but just couldn't  didn't taste good weird taste  thought maybe chicken old if oil cooked bad  Regardless wouldn't order again   Great place though! I'd come again  <EOR> Pot Tea opened recently friend decided give them try  arrived around 7 Wednesday place pretty packed    I spicy beef hot pot fried ordered lobster hot pot well chicken wing appetizer  wings came first tiny  looked dry but surprisingly moist  lacked any sort flavor definitely needed little more seasoning sauce    The hot pots came surprisingly large  well versed cuisine but dining companion mentioned lack dipping sauces they only offer two definitely felt lacking  More options would helped quite bit think  spicy beef actually quite spicy flavorful  Opting vermicelli noodles over rice helped retain all flavor broth    Despite spiciness level being right nothing else meal particularly memorable  Everything  just ok  friend seemed less enthused lobster hot pot said she regretted getting rice instead vermicelli    The place new cut them some slack far service  busy severs seemed trying best  Everyone really nice give them kudos that   Make sure bring cash since currently cash only  <EOR> Such great service!! Food delicious!! twice both time such excellent service everyone very friendly family!!! Especially Wendy family oriented!!! definitely back again  <EOR>
