Hopefully finished soon    A friendly employee greeted when entered asked if placing order I was then proceeded answer questions menu  place control freaks dream come true  decide almost everything into your burger    type meat they serve turkey burgers size well cooked toppings most which free charge which nice   only thing didn't see option type bun  also salads wraps order similar fashion picking all toppings want   I ended smallest burger Classic added cheddar cheese plus all standard toppings like Lettuce tomato pickles ketchup mustard  seemed little boring them throw some sauteed mushrooms which additional charge    The food took 15 minutes prepare  Nothing unreasonable but next time call order place online avoid wait  Once back work ate happy but blown away  burger least      My birthday cake flavored milkshake yummy! heaven cup yummy  little runnier side but didn't mind good eating quickly thicker shake would just impeded progress!

We sat down behind couple guys finished Pounder picture taken put wall  flashed lights shouted whole place could here  entertaining    I'd say place gets 3 5 stars  Amazed amount toppings offer   but burger patty itself little disappointing  = The toppings helped alot enhancing flavor but prefer burger almost doesn't need any toppings then pile em anyway  lol  Loved guacamole included FREE toppings cuz usually its almost $1 extra  yum! Also onion rings fries  cheese sauce deeeeelicious! Fries fresh hot kinda crispy but toooo crispy  Perfect!

I platter which comes salad coleslaw rings fries  $12 which may bordering pricey but some reason did mind  salad came bowl a decent size iceberg! Brilliant!  And liked both fries onion rings  fries homemade sliced thin thick served little bit skin still on  onion rings lightly battered skinny delicious  Some people might prefer big fat onion ring but found skinny variety rather addictive  just easy squash dip then slam your mouth! Dangerously simple consumption    The decor retro diner which leaves neutral  neither adore nor detest theme    As service found pleasant organized fairly prompt given close 20 party! accommodating far could tell did mess anyone's order  rather impressive considering all customization going down! <EOR> We going few years take friends many times because Burgers great combination build your own excellent Firs Onion Rings variety shakes floats  What am sick Mediocre service untrained inattentive wait staff no clue treat customers  Waitress maybe 17 18 years old table ours yet couldn't manage find time stop refill drinks properly take order came wrong  She did plenty time hang grill window chat cooks other staff while drinks sat un refilled 7 8 minutes  The other waitress seemed top game but woman whom guessing charge related owners Manager oblivious on  Yet always time check your phone text because more important then paying tipping person whom 15 feet your location  Who ever hires trains people should ashamed but if good burger 50's atmosphere then give try  <EOR> Although ordered burger medium came dry tasteless  topping list great but many mentioned extra charges border ridiculous   When order $6 worth fries onion rings can't throw some sauce free?
