Eating inside gets free chips salsa bean dip but if want express going cost $3 50 no beans just chips salsa $1 95 if want add rice beans your order    Now finished being nosy express option decided eating inside would better us  seated right away drink orders taken  person bringing refills spot he quick refill chips salsa ask if needed anything but server lacked lot things  took 15 minutes even come over see then 5 more minutes until she came back take order  finished 2 rounds chips salsa before she came over us  weren't very busy all don't know deal was  chips salsa good bean dip amazing  tasted just remembered it  When came main course ordered Cheese Enchiladas made flour tortillas  came side beans I know said but beans tasty! rice  wasn't terrible all but wasn't spectacular  think could due fact plate wasn't very warm when arrived  able $7 99 showed players card  Currently if players card then weekdays before 6 pm 2 item combo just $7 99  meal would $11 deal  Score!
