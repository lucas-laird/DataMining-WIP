Falafels dry barely enough sauce around  10 bucks 4 rip off   I ordered Lebanese sandwich  Nothing Lebanese it  Looked 2 year nephew used diaper  straight garbage Fries completely uneatable  Soggy greasy barely warm  Screwing fries really do  Those garbage too   So ate 4 falafels 29 bucks  Never going back! place sucks <EOR> Great Middle Eastern food perhaps best ever tried   back house gets 5 stars because menu varied all food tastes excellent   front house gets 2 3 stars   wait staff means well tries hard but front house organized properly   wait staff multi task hostess cashier phone answerer table bussers   everything front house take twice long should   food great but prepared wait  <EOR> The worst food ever had!!! Everything way over salty if want Heart attack symtoms visit Khoury's  Meats feels very rubbery uncooked if your eating rare steak but kafta kabob!!!  Over priced junk food!!!   We  notifying health department swell  <EOR> So probably biased because actually lived Middle East worked cook while living but wasn't impressed anything ordered   because miss lot food used while living over hoping maybe place could alleviate some that   Alas be   ordered lunch meat combo wanted try sujuk kibbi rather disappointed it   sujuk came dry while kibbi rather tasty happy that   rice served fine but raw onion plate kind overwhelmed whatever tried eat with   Also grilled veggies served pretty much raw appealing   would say biggest issue pita overcooked period   Even fresh pita midway through meal crunchy bottom!  Pita should NEVER crunchy!  Also still flour something outside kind grainy particularly appealing   also somewhat annoyed find charged side pickled veggies asked without being told first server   Normally Mediterranean restaurants those pickles come everything kind surprising   Overall if end going back place probably try pizza heard better things them  <EOR> The fatoosh salad chicken shwarma amazing waitress April excellent! <EOR> We LOVE love LOVE Khoury's   live right around corner Khoury's good glass wine pasta except good glass Pomegranate Sangria fresh baked pita bread   Did mention delicious baklava?! predictable order same thing every time ok well do!

Most tables inside allow attractive view brick oven where pita made   We started falafel appetizer genuine highlight although ironically falafel themselves weren't amazing  prefer falafel cooked light crisp but most places seem serve falafel pretty well done no surprise ours way  delicious picture perfect chopped vegetables filling rest plate  both liked pickles actually liked Kalamatas which normally least fave olive  Kalamatas only slightly bitter nice tang  big surprise though pickled beets very crispy sour  lot more oomph! pickled beets past  Of which um two? expert but really satisfying  Mike ordered soda which always replenished needed without any waiting  asked if lemonade  waitress said did freshly squeezed  Count in! she neglected mention very best lemonade ever served west I 15    maybe even west Appalachians  terrific    Of course lemonade wasn't subject refills when despite attempts nurse all way through emptied glass during meal decided *if* waitress asked would splurge another whatever price may be  It wasn't menu  Otherwise would take sign stay frugal   Well she didn't ask when bill glad  Eight dollars two lemonades wouldn't really line particular dining experience  rest Khoury's pricing difficult judge  Many items pretty reasonable compared similar places but some prices seem high get  husband ordered Meat Combination $19 he plate would've run perhaps half most other casual moderate places   I ordered lentil soup because description menu  soup pleasant pebbly texture obviously prepared care nut also thought bland  where personal tastes may come in  used spicy Indian lentil soups course isn't fair judge Mediterranean restaurant those standards    For main course embarrassingly unimaginative got    garlic pizza  hear thud hang head shame? really craving salad maybe fatoush which elsewhere loved but salads all entree sized also craving something heavier main dish  I never good luck taking leftover leafy salad home later once dressed  half salad at half price would've solved problem  did eye someone else's salad though looked great  Oh well  only look stomach all things    The garlic pizza whose copy claims need mints decent enough  did appreciate weren't lying amount garlic  Again though think just wasn't thing  pita crust nice change but something need twice   Speaking pita before meal served fresh pita basket bread hot couldn't touch it  That's complaint  Miss Noob never seen pita when spherical only ever seen its pocket form  served olive oil thyme mixture which inviting sounds pretty flavourless alas  But pita itself good  But then warm bread usually sure thumbs me   Mike thought meat plate okay but he left wondering much food meh much just him   I don't think Khoury's let down but much lift just depends like  If back lunch prices  <EOR> Came dinner Saturday night   took while service beginning but service good that   hummus pretty tasty garlic mint yogurt   pita ok   pita comes warm but strange wheat taste used pita   does crunchy fast   They moussaka favorite dishes tried stuffed cabbage   ok   Cabbage leaves stuffed rice meat then cooked covered roasted garlic   couldn't finish all   texture little offputting   Very watery dish     My husband meat combination   meatball comes pretty good but everything else little dry   meat combination comes rice part very very good   offer tzatziki tahini side entrees take advantage that   tzatziki well meat   I offer Lebanese Moroccan beers   nice try something different   Also full bar lot creative drinks   But lot restaurants try part town   likely try different restaurant DW Bistro when am back part town again  <EOR> Best place middle eastern food Vegas far  am sure cause tried several places cause far where live somehow just come back here  Food service always good love fresh pita  <EOR> Great food strong sangria!  tonight dinner  can't wrong four course meal two   lot food $39 99  bad side service extremely slow  waitress very friendly but again very slow  All all good experience food sangria alone  <EOR> A group came lunch   food delicious   started off large hummus warm pita bread   appetizer must   few people greek salad gyro meat   chicken kabobs others gyro sandwich fries   kabobs outstanding everyone enjoyed food too   service little slow but excuse since place full people  <EOR> My second time restaurant  Must say love Pita Bread!
