If want happy mood take Stripsteak   We sat lounge time more intimate feel I guess birthday girl festive mood did deliver getting bit limelight main dining area  sat right next bar area which may lead consumption alcohol random   For starters given fries yes duck fat fries  Those some reason just always quacking storm  dipping sauces accompany seem add special dose flavor but fan house made ketchup  just tasted bit more tomato then prefer   As main event filet mignon partnered Mac cheese spicy pork belly rice  filet mignon cooked perfection melted away once again every bite  highlight though Mac cheese  well worth 3 hours every time highly recommended  noodles soft none overcooked which rarity  favorite cheese though  overloaded just gooeyness each bite sends your mouth into tailspin   I spend much main courses never sampled dessert but next time sure  must find new reason come back right? <EOR> I rib bye medium rare done perfect probably best steak years  Then  mini duncan donuts dessert served some type chocalate ice cream caramel dips  full all night worth every penny   Definately reservation  ahead time especially if big party  <EOR> My wife dined Stripsteak 2 nights ago average dinner  fried focaccia bread served skillet very good  Lobster roll appetizer very bland  bone Rib Eye tender but much taste  Del Frisco's 5 star Prime 3 stars Delmonico's 4 stars Craftsteak 3 stars   Del Frisco's numerous times never dissapointed  <EOR> I wish gave chance rate 0 star     1 1 2 hours before Kings playoff game first one's bar    Waiting game ordered 3 appetizers 3 rounds cocktails   Drinks good appetizers just ok   Then 30 mins into watching game getting ready order $300 worth Seafood told Manager Robert new group people arrived bar since other TV broken going change channel game MANDALAY BAY HOTEL POLICY always select whatever larger group people wanted watch   In case 5 people Russia wanted watch different game such told important once again MANDALAY BAY POLICY!  So changed channel 5 people could come order round water   LOL then basically said tough luck us   Imagine chock when called MANDALAY BAY only find hotel policy rather policy individual manager       So now no idea believe but if want loud overpriced restaurant where easily treated nothing if larger party arrives joint     If find somewhere else    reason why when every other restaurant packed waiting line place 1 3 full!    Hopefully MANDALAY BAY someday decide look into let reputation good hotel damaged such lack professionalism  <EOR> This amazing restaurant Mandalay Bay   First all start off fries instead bread basket   need say more?  3 different flavors garlic truffle old bay each its own sauce   bacon cream spinach which flavorful along flatiron steak which cooked perfectly   steak comes bite literally cornbread melts your mouth making crave more   dessert beignets chocolate chip cookie   used think beignets just fancy donuts but stripsteak proved wrong   crispy outside chewy but airy inside   came trio sauces which creme brûlée favorite   butterscotch bitter alcoholic taste   Definitely come back next time am Vegas   only took off star because waiter very attentive when ordered more fries came same time dessert rather during meal  <EOR> Great experience here!

Service A1 well! <EOR> Stripsteak great we'll definitely back next time we're Vegas  reservation but decided sit bar instead table  bartender Anthony very friendly attentive knowledgeable    The atmosphere somewhat casual such expensive restaurant TVs bar area but contemporary comfortable    Instead serving bread serve sampler three different types fries cooked duck fat three different sauces  can't remember all but liked them all  thought both odd interesting fries instead bread but enjoyed them    The only disappointment evening wedge salad  asked chopped split  and when arrived looked two $2 50 side salads Denny's  Seriously upscale restaurant should fancy wedge high priced blue cheese crumbles ample house made dressing loads freshly cooked bacon  Instead received small bit iceberg lettuce hardly any dressing cheese crumbles husband called bacon dust  couldn't taste bacon all  They should check wedge Mastro's see upscale wedge like  think wedge around $16  maybe more   Crazy!  Anyway things much better when entrées arrived  ordered yellow tail sashimi appetizer some most delicious sashimi ever had  super fresh tender  practically melted mouth  and prepared just perfectly just touch sauce jalapeño perfect balance flavors     My husband ordered filet cooked perfectly  very tender flavorful    We also shared potatoes gratin  large brick thinly sliced tender potatoes cheesy cream sauce no unwanted ingredients such onions   delicious    Finally dessert  thought beignets three different sauces sounded delicious but Anthony recommended apple crumble served vanilla bean ice cream ordered instead  Anthony right  it great  He also brought freshly cooked beignet try so nice him! delicious too    We left Stripsteak fat happy  Highly recommend! Just don't order wedge salad  <EOR> Overall worth money  Food 3 5 service 3 5 atmosphere 3   night started reservations 8 30   Did seat until almost 9 00  Brought own wine Corkage bit expensive $50 but still fine because wine personal special winery visited  What's okay sommelier having attitude job pouring wine  supposed high end restaurant  least through same motions if your wine  server pleasant  But she let down  Best part whole meal night play bread instead bring fries prepared several ways  Started beet salad onion oxtail soup both very good  4 people party salmon filet 2 scallops spinach lobster potatoes truffle mac cheese  Salmon okay scallops good sides good  where wrong high end steakhouse right? overcook filet? $80 price tag! ordered medium well done  Really? When showed server she completely agreed said she could replacement  Problem meal took way longer should first place waiting replacement option  when politely said would just muddle through she said she would sure take care it  Service overall polite but really slow  Everyone appreciates polite breaks between courses but way long  when check came she said took off half price steak just stared her  dumbfounded  just expect more kind restaurant  won't back  many other great steakhouses Vegas  even Outback Steakhouse properly cooked filet!  embarrassing  <EOR> Good golly miss Molly   Dinner StripSteak fantastic still thinking several days later!  We ordered west coast oysters crab cakes appetizers   oysters super fresh but could done without crab cakes   Don't wrong cakes good made whole lump crab contained no fillers but just wasn't anything write home about     I shared 30 oz  porterhouse Angus steak sister   ordered medium rare gloriously arrived table perfection!  even sliced knowing planning share!  literally melted your mouth   No joke   We ordered 3 side dishes shared them family style  Spinach Souffle Parmesan Cream Sauce Truffled Mac Cheese Blue Cheese crusted Potatoes Au Gratin   say all them exceeded expectations   Souffle delicate but flavorful Mac Cheese deserves entire review itself I worried going heavy noodles mushy overcooked but alas wrong! Au Gratin right balance creamy salty goodness   As if everything point wasn't enough ordered beignets creme brulee passion fruit panna cotta coconut mandarin sorbet   Somebody punch me   Although creme brulee tiny beignets warm comforting   panna cotta creamy delicious refreshing   Just everything ever heard Michael Mina restaurants expecting high brow snooty service but instead most attentive server pleasant downright kind totally normal   could tell he shared love food happy explain answer all questions!

YUM!  StripSteak also great fries everyone table liked but don't really remember taste just special specialty restaurant   place definitely more expensive most steak restaurants LV even tell $110 per person averagely but if looking eat nice steak restaurant great steak Las Vegas regardless price place place go!  Oh more thing don't Kobe beef hot pot thingy worth good but worth it  <EOR> When strolled into joint pockets bulging Mandalay Bay chips expected completely blown away  place nicely designed course usual eye candy ish host staff front desk learn expect fancy schmancy type places  young blond hottie proceeded seat right next another couple dressed impress while looking slightly better alley trash  first thought ask move but then decided since might bored any moment would just sit eavesdrop conversation    When gamble usually BIG play really conservative decided treat meal same way  pulled quarter gave flip  Tails cheap  Alright theme set  Instead ordering $180 wagyu 8oz steak opted 16? 18? oz $51bone in rib eye  side dish chose caramelized onion goat cheese scalloped potatoes which came $13 $14  also ordered WATER  Bottled water sir? No just regular water please  Oh steak please bring $18 glass cheap Cabernet  Would appetizer start off sir? No  salad some crab cakes? No thanks  really starving right now wait    So waiter rushes off proceed listen life stories couple seated next waited food  Ahem Sir chef sent complimentary fries three different types fries each paired its own special dip  Actually fries pretty good but if wouldn't spend 9 bucks them just wait them comped    Anyhow steak cooked perfect medium rare but little more fat bone would liked  scalloped potatoes excellent  little rich some people would suspect but good me   While savoring taste rib eye thought occurred When cook rib eyes over mesquite wood home BBQ seasoning them properly taste almost exactly this  Ahh well probably just overestimating own potential again    To give place fair review would probably kick more cash $94 bucks spent here  good  probably great place take date impress wife girlfriend mistress some special occasion   guess paying ambiance   good probably end again pillaging Mandalay blackjack tables but overly impressive least cheap stuff ordered  <EOR> This lovely steak house located Mandalay Bay great decor excellent service classy ambiance   why 2 stars?  Quite frankly steaks incorrectly prepared   First some background middling 5 figure salary can't afford eat $60 steaks very often   But when usually worth every penny   happily dropped $300 single meal because difficult find world class beef expertly aged prepared   I ordered ribeye medium fiancee filet mignon medium well each currently $59 spicy zucchini asparagus sides ordered two glasses Michael Mina's cabernet   When steaks arrived bitterly disappointed find ribeye overcooked somewhere between medium well well done no trace pink whatsoever while fiancee's filet completely well done     Our vegetable sides quantity over quality sure many fistfuls zucchini asparagus customary two people but zucchini hardly spicy asparagus elementary   certain could've made side home blindfolded   All work into designing executing such beautiful restaurant flies window instant chef overcooks your steak   When apex your evening town your dinner keystone your dinner your incorrectly prepared steak puts damper your mood   am send back food mostly because irreparably throws off timing meal but when mentioned server problem steaks she informed lately customers complaining steaks undercooked   She received authorization manager give complimentary desserts but declined   Please keep mind quality beef superb pacing meal comfortable   treated very well wine satisfying   review price nor value your money   simply two overcooked steaks two underwhelming sides   level no room error  <EOR> Definitely still fan!

I tried cucumber martini    which refreshing first but started taste cucumber y towards end   But once again extra star being innovative atypical   I'm big meat person ordered alaskan halibut   Nothing fancy just grilled some herbs spices top   But still very juicy overcooked ALL   My boyfriend ordered some steak special     forgot name but bite tender JUICY!!!   For sides ordered truffled mac cheese asparagus   Once again excellent   Great ambience great service great food    only downside prices    but then again suppose fine dining no negative points aspect   Probably best steak house Vegas tried thus far    highly recommend it! <EOR> All boys Vegas trip means need some red meat!!! wanting try Michael Mina restaurant friend recommended place favorites Vegas   turned better expected!!
