The espresso bad quality over brewed both  also disappointed lack variety non dairy milk they soy almond no coconut   Considering locally owned coffee shop would expect least offerings Starbucks other LV based coffee shops  also zero gluten free vegan options which also bummer    I also found rather offensive shop smelled strongly pine sol something similar  an employee mopping floors while sitting trying enjoy coffee  Personally feel should reserved closing opening duties  certainly isn't appetizing huff chemical solvents while eating enjoying beverage  price latte mom's coffee day old pastry expected lot more  <EOR> I've searching place bulletproof coffee fix without driving all way downtown  stopped cuppa was! ordered largest option available added cinnamon vanilla  less $5! tasted great kept laser focused hours  Vanessa barista she very nice recommended add chai next time  back sure now since love getting live recommendations  Extra star customer service  <EOR> This place super cute! decided try workout really place  hurry just ordered regular drink chai tea latte dirty  liked offered dirty no where else ever offers then forget chainlike that  did two shots espresso amazing  definitely back place  friend mango tea she also said drink really good  decor vibe really laid back love it  <EOR> Cute vibe!!!!
