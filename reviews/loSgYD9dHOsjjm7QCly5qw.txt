Front reception RUDE! Over seat servers service slow! Terrible experience <EOR> Pretty darn good  came lunch mood chicken sandwich  waitress friendly accommodating  made quite few substitutions no problem adhering all requests   My chicken sandwich stuffed full lots lots chicken  More ever before sandwich  Very good topped bleu cheese crumbles salsa bacon  wish tried tater tots instead fries but try next trip  Can't wait try some milkshakes well    Kudos them serving fries burgers well  Most fancy burger joints don't seem welcome surprise!  I didn't encounter any slowness other Yelpers complained but might because weekday lunch   I'll back  <EOR> We looking place dinner near Harrah's because catching show there  came upon KGB since unnatural obsession all things communist soviet burger into idea trying place even though Yelp reviews weren't raving it   Let begin saying before even decided head over Harrah's shoved face advertisements galore KGB brainchild Celebrity Chef Kerry Simon I'd never heard before  didn't think anything since common nowadays celebrity chefs restaurants all over Vegas  However when saw framed picture instant walked restaurant little put off  hostess walked hostess stand through dinning room couldn't help but notice poorly designed restaurant was  celebrity chef thought OK? felt awkward various secluded corners empty  Next add insult injury seated table right next plaque praising Master Chef   Really? Come guy     over yourself    I kept looking around cartoons painted wall unsure place waitress half naked half uniform  don't want see cellulite jiggling someones ass carry food around    The worst blow came when saw menu realized most part build your own burger kind joint  similar reaction Hubert Keller's Burger Bar Mandalay Bay except place very understated face name weren't blatantly plastered everywhere  menu also featured captain crunch shake  Come on     created Cookie Crisp shake when 8 put picture frame now?   I don't problem fun kitschy places serve burgers shakes but spare celebrity  master mumbo jumbo   The burger created delicious!!! chose beef patty well done whole wheat bun caramelized onions beefsteak tomato herbed goat cheese  also ordered side sweet potato tater tots side pesto aioli dipping  loved food would eat again   However   I still don't understand why chefs proud burger restaurants when creations concoctions aren't main event customers essentially building creating own burgers! <EOR> Amazing burger   you definitely taste quality meat! Special shout hostess Yanery spelled correctly beast! She everywhere running foos sweeping seating taking drink orders!!! Definitely needs promotion! service made great burger absolutely phenomenal!! Thanks KGB'S! <EOR>
