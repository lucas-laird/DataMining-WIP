YUM! <EOR> Am fond going Filipino eat spots unless they're highly recommended Pinoy friends picky hard please am when comes home cooked Pinoy grubs   TFC just recently opened recommended them high praises   prompted Yelp them found limited number reviews somewhat credible   Hence half hour Saturday driving venture across beltway much expectations   High expectations that!  I waked sat myself down two seater table right front tv showing obviously Filipino variety show given menu rightaway   Considering limited number tables small eatery somewhat busy unfortunately only lady waiting tables working cash register same time    noticed 3 groups Pinoy families enjoying late Saturday lunch   wait staff unbelievably slower endangered protected desert tortoise       After agonizing over two Filipino variety shows still neither offered water nor asked order   looked around saw wait staff serving desserts next table right then she served food family left   hoping she would notice but she oblivious presence   When family right finished desserts given bills family left starting doggy bagging food already down last ounce patience already waited almost 45 minutes waiting presence acknowledged   Hungry irritated but still keeping composure stood approached counter nicely told another lady ready order wait staff obviously forgot me   Bless heart she dropped she doing came over asked order     Now food   showed lady photo offerings Yelp   turned lunch specials version bento box special Chicken Adobo Lechon rice daikon cucumber slices    also ordered serving 4 pork siomai    food table less 5 minutes   lady helped served turned owner chef    given  complimentary soup but didn't bother asking   'hangry hungry angry ask complain further     The chicken adobo soupy bit overcooked possibly repetitive heating over heating    meat swimming sadly drowning its own watery sauce didn't usual vinegary soy saucy garlicky taste am accustomed to   lechon suffered same fate   deep fried more once lost crunchy skin moist meat combination would expect deep friend pork belly   didn't dare touch side salad daikon cucumber   looked they've sitting long they're turning darkish   ate 3 4 small bite size siomais   better siomai Chinese establishment    figured order halo halo would save day ordered regular halo halo   $5 didn't fare any different Red Ribbon's Jollibee's Chow King's   dining experience yet again another total letdown   should've expected much high    Better yet should've expected all     I stayed longer waiting served acknowledged actually enjoying food   finished eating less 20 minutes   Didn't even bother washing down food glass water provided me   The bill $17 24 paid $20   think tipped much such mediocre service    something amiss  If customer ignored stood asking service   Anyway  stood headed towards door left quietly possible vowed never return again   ever!
