I really enjoyed sushi burrito fusion offer here  first trip menu well laid out  think could spend eternity trying build your own combination ingredients pre designed models blessing   tried Redondo seaweed wrapped sans cilantro add ginger very flavorful   The staff attentive helpful recommendations  Portions right size not much little     My only recommendation little more variety pre designed rolls burritos quick ordering  liked layout menu highlighted protein each design first keep up! <EOR> Coolest  Concept  Ever  know others but first fell head over heels creative take favorite cuisine! Chipotle meets Quick sushi   will definitely staple household! Fish buttah    <EOR> Finally stopped tried sushi burrito  pretty much did 'make your own ' eliminating un sushi type ingredients regular items   big mistake think  tuna yellowtail masago cucs wasabi sauce  wasabi sauce wasn't spicy enough just cucs didn't give enough texture burrito  still good just good might if I'd gone theirs menu  Friendly staff stop next time area burritos <EOR> Is burrito?yes  How does taste?AAmazing! How eat it?Anyway trust you'll find way wraped? Sea wead sesame seed wraps  Is sushi? Yes! thats good best both worlds paper wrapping  Soft rice outside crunch inside  Is mexican food? would say 50 50  Salsa bar both salsa wasabi  !!! Woa!! What put it? say put $20 two people two different burrito Roll cut half switched halfs try little both Hip music very fresh feel check ! <EOR> This place fabulous  Food fresh refreshing tasty!  Such cool concept  Staff amazing first timers owner gm came chat  arrested Newport Bach style another great dish  Along soup  Would back again  sure  <EOR> Have twice many days  food wonderful staff super friendly helpful! totally worth 20 minutes drive  <EOR> Yum!! Definitely need your way there  Long Beach ! little crowded sure give yourself enough time if your limited lunch hour  <EOR> Seriously think overpriced  Portions small considering price  give small scoop sushi fish  Idk maybe bc used eating all eat sushi but full burrito wrap  prefer eat regular AYCE sushi restaurant pay $10 more 10x more food portions   then satiated  While food does taste good great sushi fish price your paying  probably wouldn't come again just bc pricing portions  <EOR> Ordered Rockport burrito sushi 3 times because dann amazing  crunch good spice wish access back California <EOR> I'm very ecstatic see Jaburrito open back much closer where live now!  However place 2 weeks old employees still new this  reason why reviewing 3 stars now   The new staff doing great job making but let slide    Except some few glaring holes One guy piled all brown rice middle seaweed wrap instead evenly covering whole square area see white rice  Doing cause burrito fall apart easily   don't put much your wrap lady counting pico de gallos burrito even kidding  told put more she still counting tiny scoops instead normal scoops! She doing 3 tiny scoops everything instead 4 last location normally do  Also put waaaay much condiments cause really soggy drowning flavours    I back once everyone settle when Taro chips available  <EOR> First all love burritos  Sahara all time  When heard closer excited  food excellent always  However staff sub par  many people behind counter grouped circles just talking each other  Another customer walks saying she order she needed pick employee didn't answer her  ready pay cashier turns around sneezes into shoulder facing towards food! If sneeze never sneeze towards food  staff seemed never worked food industry  disgusted cashier sneezing  Killed mood  Excellent food tho! <EOR> I can't stay away place    Good   tried something different today  Long Beach wheat tortilla    heaven  <EOR> Burritos + sushi = amazing!!!  This place great everybody nice friendly food    delicious! Definitely going back prices fare wacky most niche joints  <EOR> I your own bowl  chose Asada tofu made similar Broadway but Avocado Cilantro sauce  tofu cooked soon ordered  choose between white brown rice  portion very big wasn't expecting finish but did  jalapenos weren't very spicy  Veggies tasted fresh  Guac could better  go  container good keeping food warm but nothing microwave can't solve  want back try jachos  friend Long Beach green tea seaweed salad she loved it  <EOR> Great food lots choices friendliness helpfulness staff keep coming back! <EOR> Absolutely fabulous food!!! just wish you'd open place Henderson  I'd definitely many more stops  <EOR> All say BOMB!!!
