But seeing another table sat receive water before did thought needed speak manager  walked bar bartender said he would manager  5 minutes standing decided I'd wait manager table  order 6 tacos 2 margaritas arrived still no manager  Finished meal still no manager   #1  All servers should acknowledge guests  #2  don't care if someone's sitting section your section  Eventually communication between servers management going take party   #3  You're always going customers aren't sober  excuse but true  understand members but don't walk away without completing order  If anything call management deal individual  If see fit they'll ask them leave trouble away  case believe server just being impatient   #4  Managers where heck you?
