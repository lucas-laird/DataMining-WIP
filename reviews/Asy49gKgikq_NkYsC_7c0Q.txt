Staff rude place dirty run condiments chips water etc  wait long wash hands saw guy making sandwiches put hands hair then resumed making sandwich  health department should involved here  <EOR> While love capriotti's overall people should steer clear particular location  Overall last six months gone numerous times ordered both veggie turkey veggie cole turkey myself family   On each occasion food service steadily declined  Generally speaking employees appear general disregard customers indicated nice things said under breath    Although overlook rudeness when service quick food good ended today  waiting 25 minutes single sandwich when home surprise sandwich only mostly bread but made use term loosely made incorrect    Personally if manager owner would embarrassed  <EOR> GF asked if wanted Capriotti's today   remind bad location is   She kept asking why reminded unsanitary conditions memories long haired dudes leaning over making sandwiches   never ate sandwich   didn't response management year ago regarding complaints swore I'd never back   haven't   Then looked reviews last year previous comments sanitary conditions even worse     The franchisee obviously never location  <EOR> 1st time trying Capriotti's loved it!
