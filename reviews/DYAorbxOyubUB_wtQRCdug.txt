Esp iced coffee  When having gloomy blah days   once delicious iced coffee touches tip tongue happy fat kid holding two scooped ice cream cone   Not only does place plenty drinks offer seems endless amount flavoring add your drinks too  your usual caramel vanilla hazlenut chocolate sugar free   etc  THEN   you your passion fruit your coconut peppermint other syrup slipped mind because word COCONUT instantly won over   So did end getting? iced coconut latte  Now only different   it good different delicious drink!!!! Ahhh    love first taste!! boyfriend some triple chocolate blended mocha drink large size  Probably equivalent venti starbucks   Only negative thing MadHouse pricey side  Both drinks came $11!!!!!

But expected much since Matcha powder which expensive any grocery store  would say drink rivals Urth Cafe's Green Tea Boba blended drink may even surpass it  <EOR> The worst coffee ever  young lady works  cannot coffee  swear she did put drop coffee into caramel latte  order drink all time  She's 1 person cannot coffee  never again  She should fired  <EOR> A 15 minute wait coffee drive through line unacceptable only being car ahead   only writing review because 2nd time happens  So turns wait  long because people order food   Wouldn't more sense customer pull around wait front restaurant coffee shop employee run food whenever ready instead making everyone drive through line wait extra long time   <EOR> After swearing off caffeine last summer stuff calling morning   stopped delicious Red Velvet mocha non fat decaf boot   never before would buy decaf but now understand why need reformed coffeholics such myself   Very deliteful desserty is word!   <EOR> WALKED greeted right away   ordered Iced Chai   best iced chai life   so good want another actually   right now  back see ya later  lol <EOR> This place really cool  coffee delicious people work cool well  actually personal level them which really nice know  They'll remember your orders! hookahs where lost me  huge hookah snob  Allll hookahs cheap  use coconut coals which good but feel if $80 Khalil Mamoon instead $40 would 5 5 instead 3 5  You're going people don't know anything hookah people know very much nice least two nice hookahs just those people  $13 bowl ridiculous when coming crappy hookah  can't even enjoy it  Also instead wrapping foil which just isolates heat hard real easily should net cages way if drops wont every where won't harsh  tell owner doesn't know anything hookah good move part if they're selling it  back but hookah  <EOR> The atmosphere place allows high prices   Drinks 5 stars  fantastic frozen drinks great speciality drinks  enjoy them  monkey mocha favorite   Prices 50% more Starbucks another chain   Food 4 stars  Sandwiches other cafe food  Real quick but very good  Portions relatively small but then again cafe   Atmosphere 5 stars plus  great local art work other stuff  kind open 24 7   Staff average  quick work hard but way speak guests    I've coming 4 years now  place great place homework meet friends  <EOR> Fantastic coffee shop  almost every day always amazing  food delicious drinks superb people absolutely wonderful unbelievably sweet  owner absolute sweetheart loves customers   I couldn't love atmosphere more  Between music people beautiful art feature perfect spot just sit hours  completely unique refreshing being relaxing experience   The Japanese matcha green tea smoothie favorite order every time  Every sandwich menus delicious but soft spot Tiramisu French macaroons  open 24 7 perfect late night cramming night friends  Everyone brought loves it  go to spot 2 years now  <EOR> Love hot Chai Latte here!  order ours almond soy milk   Tastes much better Starbucks Coffee Bean!

My favorite coffee shop Las Vegas  Reno native used being surrounded local coffee shops  took awhile find place but glad did  art featured favorite group artists Recycled Propaganda knew second walked place me  Staff always kind provide quick service  Great drink quality   Cold Brew + Hemp Milk = Coffee Heaven <EOR> A different blend coffee versus your average Starbucks type  Prices much more reasonable sizes bigger  <EOR> I love nutella white chocolate blended drink yummy! tried French macaroons some days great other times suck just wish more consistency especially price  reason 3 star rating  <EOR> I place more Starbucks Sambalatte  There's good eats drinks even hookah  Tuna sandwich well green tea drinks  Hookah just okay but don't let prevent trying fresh menu item them! They're always really friendly  <EOR> Calm fun  good place study since easy stay awake eat without any overly active distractions  The most distraction would music busy kitchen easy fix headphones   They indoor patio areas   Indoor plugs only non window sides room  Although indoor area small large windows give spacious feel   Patio three eight tables umbrellas  The food options unique good quality quantity  happy sandwich more options usual coffee shops offer   The Hibiscus cinnamon iced tea refreshing yummmmy!   It's top return studying  <EOR> Ok 4 days row already  great! tea refreshing blended Nutella delicious blended red velvet heaven French macaroons yummy raw vegan brownies moist  Seriously try place  <EOR> My new favorite spot  Plenty seating access power open 24hrs  Coffee great though only latte    looking forward trying more  <EOR> Call coffee macaron snob but both just awful  couldn't bring myself finish purchases  <EOR> The menu decent opinion  red velvet frappucino tried first time good  doesn't seem many people during day but place definitely popular night  music people quite loud there  if you're planning focus without really high noise then wouldn't recommend it    I personally did loud felt yelling friend sitting next me  LOL but other really good place catch friends all cafes especially if you're planning stay whole entire night because late hours! <EOR> Very nice place late coffee  Good music nice service most important 24 hour busyness   Good spot hangout friends <EOR> There aren't lot smaller mom pop style coffee houses Las Vegas Compared Pac  NW where where almost every corner Mad House nice choice if want break Starbucks    They ton options many more flavors say Starbucks which great if want change up  reason giving them three stars instead more service  people friendly all but really really mean REALLY need some more training  Ordering huge task mess frequently  fact only saving grace kids window nice hard super fed them always making mistakes    My last two times order messed up  second time order messed up    happened several times    They also don't seem keen common coffee lingo  want medium iced latte medium coconut latte usually turns into them asking dozen questions just order right  If order 'iced latte' then ask 'what flavor did want?' 'you wanted iced?'    last time ordered non fat coconut latte 'so want latte coconut syrup?'    um yes when someone orders latte flavor means want flavor syrup  Trying order multiple drinks once even worse    I would think kids just haven't trained well but really just want hit Starbucks when ordering such hassle  But coffee good drive through window which nice morning way work but even loosing charm   When first drive through quick  But also seems slowing down  sure if due again staff just isn't trained well takes them long time drinks if AM girl window busy flirting guy car handing drink  cool friendly but when someone through drive through doing quick  sit 10 minutes while giggle session cute guy ordering coffee    This place could go to if just fixed few things  <EOR> For most part no matter order food various coffee items going tasty satisfying  However prepared pretty high prices   For example today ordered Ron Jeremy Sandwich medium Michael Jackson  Based off those names vibe joint  great sandwich delicious filling coffee rich delicious  great those two items together cost 13$ some change  little expensive side if ask me    However if looking great cup coffee delicious sandwich mind prices highly recommend groovy joint    Have baked goods yet but also look delicious! <EOR> Love coffee!

Starbucks doesn't even melt customers first  they just put matcha milk ice shaker mix best chunks unmixed matcha powder sitting bottom cup end  But say small size same price Venti Starbucks all those complain Starbucks over priced =P  Customer service HUGE definitely give MadHouse props being customer oriented  loved barista did best he could me  also loved he offered remake something else if didn't meet par though assured fantastic    I visiting every often <EOR> Not sure place  decided head MadHouse last night getting crappy information Sambalatte open until 10pm Yelp right info stating close 8pm Sun Mon Tue    For some strange reason ordered medium Monkey Mocha  basically mocha banana peanut butter  Extremely sweet but expected  peanut butter dominated drink's flavor  medium size 24oz same oddly named venti Star$  large 32oz whole ounce more also oddly named trenta Star$!
