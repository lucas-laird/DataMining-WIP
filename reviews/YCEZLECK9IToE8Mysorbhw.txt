Serious lack flavor here     Crispy Brussel sprouts crispy yes  but just okay    Quinoa Broccoli crunch much quinoa dressing sweet over powering  reminded pre mix broccoli salads grandmother buys Costco lol barely touched it   Watermelon salad earth mess up? maybe half tangerine 3 cuts cucumber along very little sliced apple  things look past  But couldn't understand must've soaked fruit topped tasted juice    artificially flavored extra sweetened juice  Just leave watermelon alone   Sweet potato fries good  But they're fries    We also ordered chicken egg avocado wrap all agreed bland  Even though says salsa verde very little couldn't even taste it  tortilla good     signature green juice which isn't shown menu something ask specifically  should promote juices! Anyways just okay   Overall disappointed most likely opt lunch worth $50 spent today  Maybe rotisserie chicken keeps doors open but didn't order that  <EOR> Congratulations!

Broccoli  admire Daily Kitchen bringing little spot healthiness Westside spot where don't wonder if whole wheat bread  fact everything comes whole wheat!   However dishes simply underwhelming  filled anticipation black bean burger but let down  patty promise but very thin overpowered whopping thick whole wheat bun ironic   bun isn't toasty delicious simply big prevented really tasting whatever else happening between  side salad meager underdressed  burger came recommended think thicker patty different bun could live its potential  However when felt if eating bun   I sampled husband's turkey meatball sub suffered more bread fillings well  fresh juice selection but didn't sample any visit   I love menu  love concept  just wish execution more delicious  <EOR> I 6 times 1st four black bean burger sweet potato fries 1x salad   really liked but agree Misti Y re bread being bit overwhelming  two+ months but don't remember patty being thin  thought good thickness enjoyed aioli red pepper vegetable not spicey red pepper flakes   next time maybe month ago wanted venture tried grilled veggie wrap w sweet potato fries  good could really taste freshness grilled veggies wrap whole slippy slimy veggies falling Rachel's Kitchen  However record Baguette Cafe best vegetarian sandwiches wraps IMO but Daily Kitchen closer house better drive bys    Now really ventured super impressed kale salad just few days ago  lot favorite things gave whirl avocado pine nuts dried cranberries really light citrus vinegarette mound massaged kale  Yummy! yummy stopped Whole Foods bought all ingredients could home   and consider myself salad person but kale super food am trying step comfort zone   Re service don't recall having any problems but maybe lucky? <EOR> When order $11 00 sandwich piece soggy bread sitting your wet lettuce  problem! Why earth would throw sandwich salad topped dressing? very least if want cut corners use doggie sized box cram your lunch pay 10 cents dressing container lid  boot soggy sandwich looked chicken leftover parts roaster   just when thought salad might salvageable taste dressing appears pure sugar  did call did apologize offer replace but sorry can't again  <EOR> I grabbed couple salads wished would stopped some where else   Both salads chopped iceberg romaine lettuce lacked flavor fresh   added tuna mine fish fresh fact didn't finish eating because feared becoming ill   sweetie ordered Thai Chicken Salad equally unimpressed   He kept finding ice pieces neither finished meals   returning  <EOR> Pretty good juice  Just sure machine clean before getting your juice taste last persons juice  Yuck! Also manager girl should watch mouth  She should yelling talking down employees front customers Rude!! <EOR> I place good healthy fare   think prices little bit much though sure recently happened but everything dollar   guess away because Summerlin   If you're getting salad highly recomend eating in   ordered pick before becuase office close dine size least 1 3 larger pick size   Also prepared eat outside dress accordingly if you're going during lunch time becuase inside area small almost always full  <EOR> Absolutely love place  want give five stars but only tried breakfast wrap fruit  new favorite place!
