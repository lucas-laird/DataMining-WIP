Came breakfast morning when really needed something simple greasy calm stomach  service decently quick but then again only ordered OJ hash browns  just okay    kinda bland pretty mushy but then again didn't specify them any particular way  did group friends very late night waiting food hour no least bit sympathetic apologetic  told manager they'd waiting inordinate amount time told want it?   So    maybe just don't late night  <EOR> This place completely adequate   food arrived ordered prepared just fine   I'd read some reviews speed did wait few minutes seated even though restaurant even half full   Once seated speed fine     Overall nothing rave nothing seek but if you're downtown need something decent eat don't scared check place  <EOR> Maybe service lot better day  first night eat computers down couldn't seat us   second night around 1am service real slow  food took long time us   could say food ok  If time wait around then place isn't bad  would rather eat snack bar golden nugget  <EOR> On 12 11 12 Carson Street Cafe ordered closed Southern Nevada Health District gross unsanitary conditions     including pest infestation  The employee dining area also ordered closed   http www lasvegassun com news 2012 dec 12 nv golden nugget infestation Reportedly management claims remedied problem satisfaction health authorities affected restaurants may reopened  <EOR> A serviceable breakfast choice bit bit overpriced get   Denny's food twice price   breakfast buffet cost same  <EOR> The Aloha french toast best thing menu   made Hawaiian sweet bread battered griddled   Served strawberries bananas   heavy fruit good complement french toast   thing order   Asian chicken salad nothing write home about   rest menu your basic diner type food   decently priced get   Would come back Aloha french toast sure  <EOR> Ate restaurant following afternoon gambling  The restaurant large decent menu AMerican food  The food good service spot quick  Not much say   Its nice clean inexpensive good! <EOR> Late night Rush Lounge watching Frankie Moreno Band  show all ready fourth meal!

WRONG!  Granted probably very few drunk idiots would actually waltz into restaurant damn near 2am order plate Asian style duck  Really does that?! grave mistake part horror trying forget   The flavor duck only so so bok choy even less appealing  only thing actually liked dish plain white rice apricot sauce  If you're frequent connoisseur water fowl word wise those little birds more bones shake stick at! sure imagine spells frustration near death drunk person already far more likely something stupid oh   I dunno   CHOKE!  So while boyfriend enjoyed every last bit heaping serving spaghetti meatballs garlic bread yours truly stuck dissecting weird bird didn't even taste great  Just because you're drunk wee hours morning desperate food don't try cool kid order some fancy sounding dish leave unsatisfied  only thing worse hungry drunk drunk  angry boot  <EOR> Yuck  night gambling 1amish  Pretty buzzed  know when you're drunk you'll eat almost anything  case here    They modified menu time since missing ingredients something  Ordered roast beef sandwich which basically generic roast beef toast which swimming tasted canned gravy  gravy incredibly salty  much bread practically falling apart soon received plate    Also tasted American Club sandwich  salty well  only thing passable fries    Service OK  great terrible  <EOR> Right across cafe lied Top 10 Best Pools nation  Ever since saw newly remodeld pool featured Travel Channel wanting take look   maybe dip   wanna down slide!!
