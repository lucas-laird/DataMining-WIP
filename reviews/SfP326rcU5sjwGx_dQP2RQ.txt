This place decent probably best place Vegas jjajangmyun jjampong   Although under new management now place seems kept same recipes previous owners  decent but nowhere near best had I miss living LA easily best Korean food   <EOR> Wow    can't believe noodles tastes similar restaurant SF!!! SF tastes better but isn't bad  Friend took lunch ordered special sauce noodle believe combo chow mein fried chicken special sauce pork dumplings  special sauce noodle good along dumplings  Both al dente  price reasonable  come again if craving noodles when Vegas  <EOR> I starving sick bad sinus infection    cravings something fried but also wanted some spicy soup balance two out  thoughts Tang Yook Jjampong!!!   We walked few minutes before closing asked server if she still serving    she back kitchen see if light still on  If light means Chef still cook luckily was!!!  I enjoyed Tang Yook which deep fried pork comes tangy jelly like sauce   similar sweet sour give side pour over  came steamy hot!!! Tasted fresh love tempura cornstarch batter deep fried pork delightful eat  oil used seem new made dish taste light perfectly crisp  Each bite pipin' hot delicious  sauce completes dish consists sliced cucumber carrot napa cabbage wood ear mushrooms onion  would say without sauce   would very plain jane definitely wouldn't good  Love!  My minus star Jjampong  Although chunks seafood lacked flavor tremendously  putting chunks cayenne pepper water heating up  spices didn't really felt some missing ingredients could done wonders soup  only thing wasn't great but did enjoy texture noodles soup very much    Their side dishes very limited only daikon kimchi  But kimchi very notable    Father loves kimchi I  Small bite size square cut shaped lightly seasoned crisp solid homemade taste  If sold jar would definitely buy few Delicious   This restaurant also very known Jjajangmyun  thick black soybean paste sauce diced meat pork vegetables mainly diced onion   Normally if ask Jjajangmyun sauce already pre made but ask server cook sauce fresh which called Gan Jjajang myun  If your vegetables cooked well then order Jjajangmyun  If your vegetables semi raw then enjoy Gan Jjajang myun  enjoy mine cooked well does Mother  Father other hand orders semi raw  don't think anybody knows order way just sharing Family order food choices here   The location somewhat hidden   tucked corner nearby 168 market   between Furniture Store Nelson Barber Shop  Even name restaurant written Chinese Characters don't look Shan Dong!! Good service great meal satisfies cravings Korean Chinese cuisine  <EOR> Of course advertised champong chachangmyun   little disappointed both   broth champong did taste familiar   dish all over place tasted different good way   lacked depth flavor   chachangmyun also little bland side   Since promoting dishes window think should nail it  <EOR> Most people don't think Chinese food when think Vegas but LV solid Chinatown  concentrated SF but TONS establishments all seemed offer legit Chinese food   I super skeptical place first since NOBODY restaurant but popped anyway since all panache Korean Chinese noodles  Turned great!  We had Shan Dong Spicy Chow Mein Za Jiang Mian Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup Chao Ma Mian All noodles made house which always treat  chow mein favorite seafood noodle soup good it's fairly light heavy flavor if  your thing      Just thinking chow mein YUM  don't know why order Za Jian Mian since don't feel dish isn't even great begin but ok it's just noodles sauce no cucumbers shop's version    They serve 2 banachan side dishes before serving entrees  Marinated daikon kimchi  Good stuff kept giving more more more    didn't even ask!  Service super friendly helpful  Would again  Now only if weren't 500 miles away    <EOR> This place hit miss   When hit 4 star when miss 2 star     Jjampong spicy only thing taste  looks great seafood veggies but  it     Jjajangmyeon have second time good   bitty  chunks look nice bowl jjangmyeon meat veggies   noodle nice chewy mushy  just right   2 sizes small $4 95 regular $6 95   small more enough me   Beef Noodle Soup The first time fell love   the beef tendon tendor along green healthy looking baby bok choy nice succulent broth accompanied nicely cooked noodles   second time meat tender wasn't happy   The third time   which time   was first time when fell love it   They serve  hot tea side dishes kim chi daikon your food   Service good   nice ladies     Whenever am mood beef noodle soup definitely call inquire ensure beef tender beef noodle soup prior visit  <EOR> Another weekend roaming around building appetite  cousin ventured place 168 Market shopping center across street China Mama   surprised store front sign only being Chinese Korean no English headed in  place very busy but owner greeted warmly into modestly decorated dining area light green walls several pictures various nature type scenes  cousin craving Cha Chiang Mein Jajangmyeon   He's inquiring all week where he could find dish thats led here  ordered Cha Chiang Mein $6 25 Kim Che fried rice $6 95 Mongolian Beef $12 95 Fried Dumplings 8 pcs  $6 95 AKA Wor Tiep pot stickers Gyoza    The Cha Chiang Mein http tinyurl com 2d8lbnq nothing look consisting black bean paste nearly really black sauce over noodles some veggies pork but very tasty similar Hoisin flavor  Everything very delicious priced reasonably $35 two us  probably back if cousin wants noodles again try other types dumplings   After dinner speaking owner Chinese grew Korea which points some Korean influences Shandong province near Korea well   Pros Quick service dumplings huge handmade  Cons want Mongolian beef spicy hot unsure why everywhere now its just sweet stir fry beef    Photo found place  http tinyurl com 22lmfqu <EOR> Had try place because jjambbong absolute favorite! Once again still no New York LA   far tried Greenland Supermarket Jin Mee Elephant Snack Beijing S  Eastern 2010 which more udon but still delicious      nobody 5 star bowl jjajangmyun jjambbong yet! If anybody knows another place should absolutely try please message let know!  As food general jjambbong bad  right same ranking Jin Mee Elephant Snack book  definitely better Elephant Snack  order small bowl jjajangmyun side enjoy best both worlds  friend he ordered fish black bean sauce fantastic a little salty   asked usual bowl jjambbong spicy humanly possible extra noodles small side jjajangmyun share friend  more generous seafood jjambbong well    think only mussel 2 pieces shrimp    The service nothing special     typical Chinese Korean restaurant Vegas  very friendly but rude food comes pretty quickly    The bill came $20 which great deal!   Honestly keep coming back until find place better jjambbong  meantime price reasonable food overall decent gets thumbs me  <EOR> This place used ok now just mehh  under new management think owners way Northern Korea speak both Korean Chinese    When arrived restaurant only 1 other table yet still took while server bring menus water  Service really slow everything ordered came least 5 minutes apart   Jjajangmyun black bean sauce noodle way salty enough meat portion smaller!   Jjamppong spicy seafood noodle soup bland    Naengmyun cold noodle soup Chinese style which made beans tasted kind really bland peanut butter soup    Weird! LOL   Yaki Mandu pan fried dumplings wouldn't know never brought out     The noodles all 3 dishes way chewy al dente taste    Hopefully food service improve <EOR> Not best value   Anything order 1 pack Shin Ramyun added something costing $7 99 upwards  If order something spicy menu guess what? just choose Shin Ramyun spicy flavor packet   The price something beef broccoli something nearby Panda Express $4 99 max over $9 99  would recommend Taiwanese place couple doors left really delicious meal lot cheaper  <EOR>
