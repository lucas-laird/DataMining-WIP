course many people $1 no big deal generally unnoticed time comes pay   However if look big picture if honest yet common mistake still impact   Take perspective example according business hours operate 92 hours week except Christmas let's say average 50 customers per day that's 3 4 customers per hour now let's say 15 those customers per day overcharged $1 each amount equates around $420 per month profits just lousy $1 overcharge mistake   If done intentionally then willful ignorance call this   only waitress though mistake   Any other time another waitress never any problems bill   seems shameful put down place used really love   used take many friends recommend place more others   However today last day eat here   food service GOOD!  never deny them but something feels shady   Now can't help but think many times happened where did catch initially   never bothered pay close attention trusted staff since regular customer   No person likes feeling somebody scammed them exactly feel money per se just code ethics between business its customers which current attention place seems lack very least employee s seem lack   The food worth eating but if choose eat just double check your tab sure charged accordingly   your right customer   If mistake called more often then perhaps help eliminate simple mistake completely  <EOR> Items Selected Pumpkin Nut Bread Sweet Cream Pancakes French Toast Chocolate Marquise Cake  Long breakfast to do list though particularly close home Saturday breakfast space known some Omelet House More but others simply 50's Diner saw sort food scene speaks era long past sounds Chuck Berry King playing overhead seems no matter name whole lot locals well aware place exists   Owned operated same family many years located just down way Boulder City Station 50's diner decidedly lowkey operation thrusts patrons back time décor well smiley service 'Please seat yourself' signage belies sort effortlessness never seems put dog eared laminated menus speaking oft ordered classics while specials rotate daily depending ingredients chef's whim   Open 7a 3p Seven Days week few questions answered order formed omitting biscuits compotes admittedly frozen canned order focus scratch made selections first bites morning paired repeat pours coffee restaurant's signature pumpkin bread flavor extremely natural none sweet sort flavor spoke lots butter nuts fruit plus just pinch cinnamon nutmeg   Unable resist pancakes some said some better ones city but happy set aside pseudo syrup favor 100% pure stuff Indiana brought home decision between sweet cream buttermilk led order former thinness three not unreasonable portion just $5 99 light flavors soft tooth undeniably pleasant French Toast white bread just bit cinnamon egg wash confectioner's sugar far less interesting such best passed   Offering any number shakes floats malts sodas dessert menu 50's Diner unfortunately limited only two options informed apple pie bought a local bakery but assured Marquise made each night house small rectangle graham cracker chocolate compilation ordered dots whipped cream serving garnish flavor proved quite rich texture unlike tiramisu nice way end just $2 99   Friendly without seeming fake offering good food extremely fair price 50's Diner certainly destination but worth checking if area looking good pancakes whole bunch omelets later seemingly quite popular those surrounding tables  <EOR> I've coming 50s Diner since 90s  If you're looking hearty meal won't break bank then you've come right spot    The service always prompt they're very hospitable  server least 20 years which speaks volumes   If love Elvis Marilyn Monroe color pink then you'll absolutely love decor    Now back food  omelets fried zucchini chocolate chip pancakes can't wrong    Just remember only open breakfast lunch  <EOR> This great place some good ole fashioned American eats backdrop pays homage 1950's  should definitely settle chicken fried steak side biscuits gravy substitute toast  I'd say quite delicious! decor hole wall diner wonderful its old tin signs adorn its walls along old style booths seats accompanied its own juke box  service great prices more reasonable  Definitely stop some good ole Americana!!! 3 stars good experience <EOR> I found place today! only 2 miles me  If looking local diner serving really good honest diner food place walked felt right home tell everyone just everyday servers very friendly efficient watched cooks line hustling but happy laughing thru it!

Different! !!!hashbrowns perfectly browned both sides but ask them way  ok brunch   Don't know back  <EOR> I place because yelp    Just know  took long time order because many things choose from  finally narrowed down French Dip sandwich   When server very patient taking order she asked if wanted fries spuds  little apprehensive spuds she gave free sample which consisted eight nine's spuds  sample both crispy spuds non crispy's spuds  realized surprise non crispy ones little bit more crispy ones ordered sandwich  excellent!  Now French Dip    past most restaurants order more serving au jus    advance ordered extra au jus  cup brought au jus large    fact large enough sandwich fit which isn't always cas  asking waitress she said yes she them fill cup more normally do  She said normally filled cup halfway   but see cup almost running over  perfect amount au jus!  The sandwich itself probably best French dip sandwiches ever life! don't know if meat bread au jus combination all three but each bite masterpiece mouth!  I pretty full sandwich spuds planning having dessert  However when server asked if wanted some Apple pie dessert told no 50s malt  then decided full thought  She agreed malt she brought menu  When looking menu saw something called egg creams which mixture milk seltzer certain flavors strawberry chocolate Creamsicle topped off scoop ice cream    said myself  even more 50s malt  Creamsicle egg cream  While good kept thinking wish gotten malt  brother would love he's more into sherbet ice cream    110% recommend place! <EOR> Service mediocre same food  Came party 4 told seat ourselves outside some run down tables cheap folding chairs which wasn't exactly appealing first thing see  menus hardly still holding together but least place pretty clean actually floors disgusting   There's only 3 people working service took forever took 20 minutes just check pay  food honestly average Denny's tastes same  waitress asked bluntly much going tip which extremely awkward  total meal $50 nothing leftover take home portion sizes weren't big would expect  All all won't returning but least wasn't completely awful experience  <EOR> The food amazing here! loved 50's decor music  definitely coming again <EOR> Really restaurant just wish came sooner! definitely isn't type place thought would find Vegas feels real down home mom pop type place    Had six egg ham cheese omelette potatoes  Omelette great potatoes meh nothing special    Will definitely come back see else offer  <EOR>
