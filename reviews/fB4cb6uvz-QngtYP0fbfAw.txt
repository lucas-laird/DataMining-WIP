We waited 5 mins tea 10 mins first order then another 10 mins 15 mins      at end just walked full plates table    I see majority customers American   maybe  where 4 stars came no offensive but  only reason see why   This place officially worse top 3 list sushi Vegas consider eat 2 4 times week     thats pretty bad  <EOR> Wow am disappointed       I wanted eat buffet @ Bellagio but decided come instead  bento box salad miso soup sashimi beef teriyaki rice couldn't really it   waitress nice first but she ignoring group guys celebrating bachelor party restaurant showed up   I never eat anymore  authentic Japanese restaurant actually Korean Japanese   kinda area though because lot Korean businesses there   2 stars!!  Tokyo Japanese yummylicious!! <EOR> There many reasons why someone give 5 star review  sometimes because food   Other times because service   I mood sushi   But didn't feel going restaurant strip would charge $20 roll   I yelped sushi found Tokyo Restaurant   For starters strip mall where located very dark evenings   sure only circles looking blue sign say's Tokyo Japanese Restaurant  ordered two rolls which ok   However came miso soup edemame some mushrooms top off Ice cream end   Where gives stuff free???? Nowhere   Stacy whom behind sushi bar also serves 3 nights week    She made place 5 star restaurant   She friendly funny charismatic   most sushi japanese restaurants people behind bar don't speak very much I'm sure being able speak English factor that but Stacy did   She G   She jokes ther clients seems liked them   The place whole wall feel it     Everyone nice feel welcomed   The people coming vegas good time but also watch spend place ask Stacy take care you   The food wasn't bad nor wasn't amazing   But experience good   I probably would given place 4 star but Stacy cool told going give place 5 star because her   She gets 7 stars   One last thing   owners take American Express! Very odd experience find whole wall Japanese restaurant takes American Express   Another Star because that  <EOR> My family family's family lot  always order chicken teriyaki tempura  awesome sushi very good selection  any Japanese sushi restaurant pricey especially if start ordering different sushi plates  end dinner always green tea ice cream give option getting red bean green tea  Haven't probably year since moved away apparently closed now because moving new location vegas  area where located commercial center prettiest location but place worth going to  waiters even wear kimonos when wait you  <EOR> This place seriously good!
