David Burke   hmm want say fan little more meaning behind it  However service some menu staples continues offer leave less enthusiastic then could be    Came NYE waiting until day open table see available  Having dined NYC location wanting redo chose come here  most part glad did    The restaurant itself considered high end however stuffy would actually far call whimsical decor  Lot's egg art everywhere fountain operating ceiling serves room centerpiece falls onto think red glass grass  cute!   The welcoming staff very friendly off great start  server however very friendly annoyed rushed  Considering restaurant wasn't completely full he really should bit more attentive better attitude  sure working NYE sucks when your 20% gratuity included maybe figure WTF going paid regardless but if don't then maybe time dunno   deal cards whatever else Vegas    The Food We started off amuse bouche butternut squash soup  When waiter put down thought oh great hate squash but tried anyway surprise very tasty!

Probably best carpaccio date   entrees opted Burke Box which combination appetizers  created fresh daily boyfriend ordered filet   filet really good however slightly undercooked taste   box very Pf Chang ish which why giving 3 5 instead 4   Everything fried   and all pretty forgettable   consisted some hush puppies chicken egg roll things really bland arugula goat cheese salad two very large shrimp some sort sweet sour dipping sauce karabuda pork corn dogs which actually pretty tasty   all deep fried liking   All all place potential but maybe needs more time shit straightened out   time because lenient come before 9 if don't want dine alone  <EOR> I really wanted restaurant prices themselves spelled DAMN GOOD!  But alas while service excellent food mediocre best   ordered truffled french fries which came amazing smell   quite delicious but overly salted!!!  ordered roasted chicken dish $28   $28 chicken better damn good well wasn't dry lacking much taste except salt   husband ordered filet mignon which cooked perfection but lacking any real distinct flavors steak could gotten anywhere else  <EOR> David Burke took forever deliver food when arrived cold   Additionally appetizer decent crab cakes but salad so  <EOR> Since town pharmacy convention bite bullet night dinner bunch coworkers David Burke Venetian   Luckily drug company's dime mine!
