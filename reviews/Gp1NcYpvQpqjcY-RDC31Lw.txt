During shift change 5pm tall blond lady server grabs beer lights cigarette also sits bar socialize  Now 2 servers ignoring table  When cook nice guy brought food table able ask drink refills  refills coming should   BTW food great! We continued neglected  No check food delivered  finished eating food  2 servers continue socialize each other watching tv screen if nothing blond continued drinking smoking   The old lady server checked off clock now sitting bar bottle beer cigarette mouth purse money hand getting ready gamble  But she never made sure taken care nor did she tell blond server us  When booth ask check old lady said off clock did know    don't recommend place dining during weekend  VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!! <EOR> Four stars based eastside options  surrounded pt's if want stay near home  seen place since kid never thought check out  decent okay change scenery typical pt stop  <EOR> This place awesome!

Highly recommend!  Also Shannon best super friendly really personable  <EOR> So living Sunrise Manor nearly two decades now place ever since lived yet never ventured in  would always shocked see neon purple lights STILL flashing nearly 20 years later  seriously thought place stuck around long because owner probably lived inside would always only see 1 2 cars parking lot   This time donned BGPs Brave Girl Panties finally entered humble quaint restaurant bar  oh ever happy to  WHY HAVEN'T VENTURED SOONER??!?!  Much astonishment place bad!! spacious open ample lighting tvs shuffleboard video poker center bar stools tables surrounding  reason why probably only saw two cars all time because there's ample parking north entrance    I only draft Newcastle perfect pricing $3 75  pseudo hubster Bud only $3 25  Next time sample some food those 4 stars may turn into 5! <EOR> Items Ordered Chicken tenders Blue Moon Bottle  This based off time visit    I didn't really good vibe bartender upon arriving friends  sure if because early 20s some girls looked young what    I thought would check place since 2 minutes walking distance    The food good prices decent but neighborhood bar you'd think would feel more home welcome    Maybe if friends convince give another review  <EOR> If East Sider Blanca bar want to  bartenders cool food Good slots loose! Its chill atmosphere lot returning customers  All bartenders know your name     show Cheers   Lol more ask for?    FOOD DRINKS I usually order chicken wings fries which always point  shrimp cocktail basic but still good  shrimp basket also yummy fried perfection perfect crisp every bite  daily food specials worth it!   The bartenders learned drink first visit honestly made want keep coming back  good liquor selection although drinks nothing fancy job done!   Only thing wished served lunch  If looking grab food only serve food during dinner hours  <EOR> This bar pretty cool being located East Side   came first time some family asked kind drinks could make   bartender Ron said he down anything ordered long he ingredients   He able BJ Alien Brain Hemorrhage B 52 like band lol concoctions own    They also jukebox love music selection!  played everything Queen Nsync ended night Semisonic's Closing Time  The staff customers awesome place definitely gave Cheers vibe where everybody knows your name they're always glad came   Check if you're ever area   won't disappointed! <EOR> they used steak fries special  but its months since gone never wrote review online browsing yelp tonight came across page just wanted give two cents  its very smokey  Bartenders prompt but food cooked order   haven't back yet really sure if want to  Anyways  all!!!! <EOR>
