Ordered medium rare perfect   atmosphere pretty little loud music playing but 10 00 p m  right next night club pretty much clientele  <EOR> A real disappointment  service slow waiter annoyingly arrogant food very average tuna accompanied potatoes tomato purée some kind spice didn't match very well over priced  Tacky decor too  Don't waste your time  <EOR> I made reservations online never recieved confirmation email  called before left dinner hostess phone told having technical difficulties call back 6 30 when reservations 6 00  just diaster waiting happen Gallaghers New York New York casino very good steakhouse <EOR> So arrived Besos opening night high expectations   greeted warmly couple waiters quickly offered drinks   indicated wanted regular water since anyone Vegas knows charge bottled water   Wine list presented ordered bottle later found did yet many bottles even some mix drinks drink menu   No big deal still lots choose from   decided order various different appetizers instead entrees order try variety foods   disappointing   big deal Eva's special guacamole only big glob mediocre guacamole costs $10   better $4   Then beef tar tare big glob diced unseasoned beef bed mashed potatoes   unappealing!  taco sampler ordering taco truck   Lastly fourth appetizer never made table   Whether forgot am unsure but when decided cancel took long return table updated bill almost find manager   apologized delay stating first night always problem kitchen   sad considering all ordered appetizers   admire tranquil beauty place however does ultimately less spectacular food doesn't really convey latin theme   Hodge podge different foods less memorable   wish could say something better but all boils down food   definately better places eat  <EOR> Sadly Beso LOOKS better really is  place beautiful its Swavorski chandeliers views Aria waterfall entrance dark classy interiors  But once take all there's much else ooh aah about     The service first great  seated right away find rest party already seated  first server 2 3 other helpers very attentive water poured right away drink appetizer entree orders taken promptly  server very friendly ready suggestions drinks appetizers  When questions entrees he very knowledgable seemed give honest opinions   The drinks bread apps came actually great  shared ceviche guacamole crab cake  All delicious  strawbellini heard yummy  mojito ok    And then came wait  waited waited  30 40 minutes between clearing appetizer plates entrees coming  during waiting even visit server host busboy ask if needed more water give update dinner  started wonder if everyone assigned table break home night    Finally entrees came  paella which just ok  rice cooked evenly some parts undercooked some parts mushy  probably wouldn't order again  husband ribeye which compared some other steakhouses town disappointing  Flavors both dishes just weren't there  mac cheese which server raved bland side  Again very flavorful    Overall Beso would great place drinks  vibe bar fun energetic loud  But if you're looking good food might better luck elsewhere  <EOR> Like other reviewers used promo Travelzoo   Not only did waste money but more importantly wasted dinner Vegas The good Great location City Center lovely area spend evening Restaurant nice decor 8oz petit Filet quite yummy though good Mon Ami Gabi Paris Good pre dinner pretzel bread  The Bad Waiter totally rude  Barely looked seemed pissed off  wait staff talked interacted seemed rude each other right near tables  Aren't wait staff supposed invisible?? dinner came champagne  served PLASTIC flutes  4 items menu sold it only 8 30!!!

All all would recommend place especially many fabulous restaurants nearby  <EOR> We group eight people ate here   waiter kept making weird comments being blonde guys work club upstairs kept saying awkward comments when walked by  yes just bit uncomfortable  food just okay  Nothing rave about!  only people normal polite guy came around poor waters people front door  Booo! <EOR> We ate Beso during recent trip Las Vegas   thought would good experience based menu ambiance   very disappointed   restaurant loud unimpressive compared similarly priced restaurants Las Vegas   pictures Beso website restaurant appear much nicer actually is   took waiter more 10 minutes greet take drink order took 15 minutes he took order return drinks hand   all waiting two drinks wrong he forgot drinks   food mediocre busy spices garnishes   waiter did pay any more attention table meals served ask another waiter refills drinks   experience good certainly worth money   could better meal better service elsewhere   won't return Beso recommend spend your time money elsewhere too  <EOR> I am very surprised bad reviews great time! best ceviche ever honest fresh delicious!!!  salmon good wasnt favorite but did slice friend steak YUM!!!! mac cheese say die for? waiter didnt even charge bottle wine ordered!!! service magnificent everyone VERY attentive very nice  impressed fact place fairly empty but yet reservation 9 didnt seated til almost 930 BUT did overall wonderful experience  would definitely back!!! <EOR> All all Beso did hit mark absolutely did love it   reasons We decided hold company dinner newly opened Beso tonight 15 people many may aware corporations usually limit meals per diem case us   admin made clear staff when she made reservation   The first thing rubbed wrong way waiter very intent selling Imperial Shellfish Tower $79 personally told no thank but he kept talking!  told no thanks again he said ok check back later case change your mind talk pushy!    15 minutes later totally saw exact same waiter trying upsell Imperial Shellfish Tower different person party person said yes comes 5 Imperial Shellfish Towers   Um $400?  most expensive appetizer menu!  clearly told no   That cool   The 2nd thing 2 vegetarians group asked waiter provide vegetarian meal accommodate those party special needs   waiter returned said don't worry we'll bring 2 veggie specials chef fantastic create something delicious disappointed   whole table gets food except 1 vegetarians   waiting while bring large platter roasted carrots asparagus pita bread battered deep fried green beans mixed green salad some sliced cucumbers apples   First all dish weird mix mismatched vegetables secondly everything but green beans pita served cold!!!!  lukewarm room temperature just straight cold   mean seemed guy slapped together whatever non meat leftovers he kitchen sent us   truly huge horrible meal   Lastly kept serving bottled Voss water all night which ended being $10 bottle   I don't recall being asked if would prefer bottled vs  filtered tap water   The whole night staff seem very intent providing great experience overly attentive annoyingly so   kept mentioning over over    really want great experience    honestly never upscale restaurant obvious pushy upselling most expensive items menu just straight tacky   course blew through per diem staff Beso even cared   In end total bill over $1600 guess great experience = let's try squeeze much dough group possible   If food die wouldn't feel offended but ranged mediocre downright horrible   probably avoid place future very disappointing look forward having dinner high end restaurant pay high end price but short changed food jacked service   Especially economic climate   If ELP I'd pissed folks representing such classless money grubbing manner   Yuck!  P S  regard location Crystals City Center basically high end mall Louis Vuitton Van Cleef Arpels Tiffany Prada Miu Miu etc some stores already open   Bring your big $$$$$!  some fancy stuff  <EOR> My wife a chef herself ate because right next hotel ambience menu looked appealing   which fact are  problem food  ordered chile releno appetizer couldn't taste poblano chile all due heavy handed seasoning filling overfrying whole thing halibut dish cactus salsa pretty good truffled mac cheese very good chile glazed skirt steak completely underseasoned cooked rare bloody instead WELL DONE ordered emphasized waiter potatoes au gratin gobs cheap cheese sauce undercooked potatoes which didn't eat graciously took off bill   service OK first until expressed reservations some dishes  point waiter started taking personal just wanted heck soon could  50% food poorly cooked including steak! good score restaurant price point    unpleasant eating experience overall  <EOR> How anyone screw steak bad am sure   Salads side dishes standard steak house fare bad but exceptional either   But meat feast be   strip chewy spit half pieces would break down swallow   mean really?    rest crew equally disappointed    left tip escaped fast possible wanting complain ruin vegas karma     If steak even little bit should last place ever go    Sorry Eva you're hot but your food not  <EOR> Last evening June 10 th  guest Beso  Steakhouse visiting town some very special friends  work couple days  evening put aside share friends nice relaxing dining experience  memorable experience all  First all all decide restaurant such high prices great location would think meal would outstanding all  reservation 8   arrived time restaurant empty  5 tables full  decor nice facing aria fountains  music bit loud  Well started cocktail order Paul  Nice guy friendly funny  drinks flagging down someone came  table 40 minutes later apology 2 3 times  ordered meal food OK  halibut awful  Crusted halibut dry be  Awful taste first bite  boyfriend try well  took some time before could flag down waiter Paul again  He seemed very flustered when told him  Paul put another order in  second order worse first raw pile salt thrown on this time dish arrived wen friends already finished meal then told special desert coming out  told waiter boyfriends birthday ok now no surprise  deserts looked amazing no candle  mentioned please bring candle deserts arrived  Paul back said oh right oh right  He returned 2 candles plate burning heck! candles weren't even put into desert! experience joke but joke pocket book  300 dollars later   <EOR> I'm sure why reviews negative one  dinner back back nights Beso Olives both Todd English preferred Beso  Having enjoyed several upscale meals agree Beso 5 stars but solid choice  service attentive seated right away  did stand purses which thought cute    I Ahi Tuna which recommended server wonderful! fish cooked perfectly nice spicy crust  crab polenta severed very creamy  also Blueberry Zoo cocktail which found quite tasty  husband 12 oz fillet he did say he wished he order blue cheese crust   cooked properly he enjoyed lot  plantain creme brulee which nice creamy  thought much better creme brulee Olives burned crust smooth     It did tend expensive side overall experience but food very good visit worth it  <EOR> Okay people listen me! see some reviews okay some very bad  Let first mention review Anyone comes because Eva Longoria owner mind  wouldn't know good acting let alone good food if sat your face! People   she cook! She actress word used lightly !   My wife Beso 8PM Saturday night  Marky Mark waiter yes he looked just which thrilled wife although he nice guy he belonged behind bar Outback Steakhouse  Just very professional over head higher end menu  ordered Foie Gras app  those never experienced enlarged fatten duck liver would strongly suggest giving try  opinion good but would probably better different approach  apricots vanilla sauce  wasn't sure if dessert appetizer?   The highlight meal followed  pleasure eating tortilla soup  Now tortilla soup thing try almost any restaurant am eating at  favorite soup far  opinion best every eaten  very simple but nice mix heat along suttle savoriness can't describe  without doubt AWESOME!   For main course selected bone in Strip steak  Ordered medium rare came medium well! Seriously? Mistakes happen know but TWO temperatures off just shows lack experience attention detail  flavor okay but could tell steak dry wet aged all  Just regular cut meat basic seasoning  Bearnaise sauce saved me  Now second part ties right along this  ordered horseradish mashed potatoes side dish  Literally unmashed lumps potatoes everywhere much horseradish made think eating shrimp cocktail St Elmos if don't know look   Just properly mashed? Cmon guys   even chain restaurants step right    For dessert wife wanted try Churros! MISTAKE! caramel sauce side very good even though ice cold  churros potential but maybe chef should change oil every couple weeks  just dirty could tell oil old    All all way over head place  Very expensive all choices Las Vegas would avoid place all cost  Paying over $225 overcooked steak avg service thing! <EOR> This place such disappointment!  read all reviews did homework but Eva failed one   give benefit doubt restaurant itself beautiful but food service prices horrible   YUCK! <EOR> Except tortilla soup which excellent everything else absolutely sucked!   person appreciates enjoys food tries new restaurants all time specifically Las Vegas am pretty surprised see restaurant great location famous owner bad   The medium filet minion burned outside dry cotton inside   scallops way salty dry well   wild mushrooms Au Gratin potatoes just terrible more Friday's     guess should known night going turn eating tasteless bread butter   Perhaps wrong people kitchen slow Tuesday night Vegas because restaurant only fifth full but service slooooow!    Anyway took Fillet off bill since did eat but stated bill customer did    would happy if ate say ethnic dish appreciative flavors something that   But hell screw Filet Mignon steakhouse?  then put customer?  Really?  Hey Eva least take responsibility add line bill says food sucked ! <EOR> I wish would read Megan P's review before decided cancel dinner reservations because offered COMP dinner Beso     Two girlfriends walking around Fashion Show Mall promoter approaches ask if we'd Eve Nightclub night   wanted Haze XS declined   promoter way name ANDRE offers comp dinner Beso Eva Longoria's restaurant Crystals Mall   guess what's catch right?  comp limit pay hit limit?  No set dinner   He sets everything promises he'll even walk into Haze XS afterwards which actually believed      Here's review ANDRE He tells call when you're restaurant seated   Well he doesn't even pick return text messages   Basically never even see again since he approached Fashion Show Mall   He never came give bottle campagne he promised either   he never shows walk into Haze set XS   top he gave number other promoters for LAVO without letting know   guess promoters paid number girls pull but definitely dealt more reliable promoters actually keep word     Here's review MEAL We party 9 girls   ordered cocktails $15 $4 soda iced tea etc    ordered Ginger Cosmo I'd say I'd definitely order off menu again  It highly recommended waitress way! didn't think any drinks great sipped friend's drinks     The meal included following Keep mind 9 GIRLS!!! 1   3 TINY portions guac chips   Guac OK but better felt chips little stale    2   2 plates caesar salad   mean can't really wrong caesar salad but don't think lettuce very fresh   3   2 plates steak potatoes   portion each plate enough probably feed 1 person imagine 4 5 girls sharing portion 1 person   mean yes Vegas want look good dresses but also want eat don't wasted   Yes steak good whole 4 bites ate!  literally 1 slice per person 5 pieces pre cut   I'm sure meal would better if actually paid dine Beso but honest promoters should just tell people comp taste sampling come eaten!  phone yelping nearest fast food restaurant eat more but comp meal only takes reservations 9 9 30 10 they just want Eve Club even if don't want to doesn't really allow time eat meal #2 before trying into club promoter promised walk right but MIA   definitely would rather paid eat elsewhere probably never step foot into Beso again     You win time but hope win long run yelp review  <EOR> Probably new favorite restaurant  Everything awesome! Ordered steak rice beans guacamole churros  full when left but everything worth it  i wait back! <EOR> Wow  good wow all   Did expect such bad food here  fellow diners said better steaks Outback possibly Sizzler Cocos   The waiters seem programmed try upsell everything  only amazing food menu kitchen highest priced items    Considering much amazing food available Vegas Beso sucks some major donkey balls  various managers completely useless   manager work Chad Jahn beyond useless  consensus he's ex bouncer doesn't even know manage drink much less manage high profile restaurant   There seems many staff running around pretending busy actually working   saw no less 3 managers pretty much walking floor doing nothing   None them any tables inquire food service anything would normally relevant jobs  many hostesses worried outfits make being seen    Now onto food  Again WOW  beyond awful  once actually came out   Apparently ticket dropped TWICE kitchen  did any manager come apologize try nice? Uh that'd no   That's where wonderful awfully helpful insert sarcasm Chad came over  he only came over because actually asked waiter where manager why he wasn't trying sooth things over us   Instead told expected service  Comped food steep discount free dessert coffee tea  least he competency guess some hope  BUT best part is  he wasn't telling us  poor waiter breaking news  Isn't manager's job?  The waiter trainee sweet trying help but honestly else do? think pretty much gave when knew much dinner going cut therefore reflecting tip  made sure compensated work  main tab? Aw hale naw   Took whatever discount gave us  Normally group would order 1 2 desserts share  Yeah call greedy bitter but each ordered one   sad thing is? Even dessert took 15 minutes come wasn't good   The star because waiter actually tried hard   Final report More style substance  <EOR> The Beso Steakhouse slightly hidden Crystals City Center Strip  Crystals adjacent Aria City Center  Take time find Beso upper level Crystals very likely regret it  entrance Beso very large but when enter restaurant opens reveal eloquent eatery  taken back corner  told corner where would put couples could more romantic  location made believe telling truth  felt more romantic sitting where were  moment seated service people took good care us  really enjoyed look Beso look forward going again   The appetizer course very unique something never presented way  meat cheese plate  plate came four types meat four types cheese crackers them The meat specially made Beso  tender freshly sliced cured meat provide  cheese came mellow sharp but all nicely creamy tasty   I ordered Caesar salad which very impressed with  full leaf salad subdued dressing  dressing very nice Caesar taste but very light tongue  flavor accented lettuce cheese overbearing all   The main course ordered bone rib eye wife petite filet  almost if didn't need knife cut rib eye  know kind cliche but knife through steak if butter  barley chew well  rib eye tender tasty  flavor meaty without being over top  steaks medium rare  rib eye cooked perfectly right amount marbling right amount fat perfect sear  would say rib eye if best steak ever eaten   Dessert equally delicious rest meal  perfect cap meal presented  wine wonderful  great taste  wonderful balance between sweet acid  aroma well rounded lingered pleasantly  am sorry remember winery cab from  also know restaurant cannot insure quality wines serve  But selection made Sommelier seems very thoughtful  wife enjoyed wine selection much enjoyed mine   I found overall meal well worth price  But four dollar sign restaurant  Because value 10 but still worth cost good value  <EOR> We last weekend while town   8 us   Although decor beautiful seated time took them forever take drink order then bring us   know drink prices expensive   but Red Bull Vodka tumbler glass small w evidently more Red Bull perhaps even full shot Vodka more expensive sister's glass Red Wine   Plus brought extra drink did order   but left anyway charged it     It took them forever take dinner orders   finally served although forgot half ordered   meat ordered so   plus two friends ordered fish discovered when meals finally arrived more fat actual fish brought   When brought server's attention   she argued then brought chef's attention response was     just way    Then another server came over much discussion took plates back requested chef prepare additional meals them but took really long time   finally fessed being mistake   they brought obviously recycled measly desert someone's birthday   who did want it   it said Happy Birthday it   No celebrating birthday kind uncomfortable really tacky   None touched it     To bathroom   you take elevator upstairs Eva's club    little inconvenient say least     All all   it pleasant experience when check almost fell over!  check close $100 per person plus charged food forgot bring extra drink which mentioned before tacky make desert did order   and did eat   Again argue   top that   because over 6 people   they automatically add 18% gratuity in   Believe me   they didn't deserve more 5% tip way treated!    To long story short   it's unbelievably Over Priced food sucked service bad!  highly RECOMMEND it  <EOR> We staying Aria decided dinner Beso   love Eva Longoria's restaurant Cali high expectations Beso   booths nice comfy but service leaves lot desired   filet steak just average prices very high cocktails started $14 up   app guac chips below average   mentioned love Eva's restaurant Cal but disappointed Beso City Center  <EOR> Okay COME ON!

Does he realize he first person potential customers see?
