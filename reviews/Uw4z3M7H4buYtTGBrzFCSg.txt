Anyway particular McDonald's located 'questionable 9 PM' neighborhood   tiny bit dangerous wandering around night   Food?  Your standard McDonald's over processed grub   greasy salty but likely bring back some fond memories   still Cheeseburger Happy Meal almost everytime   But now apples instead usual sleeve crack addled fries?  don't know one   Good try McDonald's getting through childhood obesity barrier but alas leave many kids whining fry fix     Nothing fancy McDonald's basic get   Looks just any other old style building one   Those newer more modern looking McDonald's?  Very shiek   makes almost think eating classy joint   Almost  <EOR> Stopped location due regular mcdonalds  closing drive thru because construction  course kind similar Lake Mead MLK location first window girl friendly  When pulled pick coffee girl asked if burrito  sure messed orders shouldn't show just paid what? Other awesome! <EOR> This place dirty horrible walked girls where helping instead where talking guys still nerve tell hold where cussing   food took ever kids playground disgusting   recommend McDonald's nor ever come back freaking gross <EOR> By far worst McDonald's service ever  staff poorly trained seems if don't even know customer service is  extremely slow serviced day night  need change staff fix before Wendy's takes over across street lol <EOR> Wow  Hands down worst McDonald's ever sometimes McDonald's already pretty bad  Ordered Big Mac happy meal specified wanted nuggets apples fries soda girl's toy  cashier took down specifies telling computer  when food boy toy milk no apples  Wow  Really?
