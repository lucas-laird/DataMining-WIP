I really liked decor  also really good ramen  shio ramen wife shoyu ramen  always end trading half way through all meals  Anyway would recomend place prices bad unique place  <EOR> *3 5 stars*  I couldn't help but notice sign place driving along Spring Mountain   cute little anime girl steaming bowl ramen name joint surprise Anime Ramen   made perfect quick lunch spot errand running Sunday   The place tiny but made feel welcome soon walk door   menu pretty simple just tonkotsu ramen order edamame sounded ideal me   pretty damn good    Fun anime movies play along TV screens while Japanese pop music blasts speakers   All kept thinking much 16 year old nephew would enjoy place   All all just would expect entertaining atmosphere decent ramen  <EOR> Blaah! place used good but quality down! Ramen awful   Service even great!! Never comin back!! <EOR> I food okay price  guess just deal certain people eat  listen psychotic teenage amazing personality drone many people crushes LOL  pretty annoying really fast  would say safe place eat ramen  would prefer going right upstairs ichiza but  just me  <EOR> This place gets 1 star ambiance  idea clever cute   But service food both seriously lacking  ramen HORRIBLE  no words  real ramen  world's most poorly made ramen  way stay away    As service early lunch place pretty much empty  yet 2 servers kept disappearing kitchen 5 10 minute stretches while going refill glasses  There's nothing quite uncomfortable sitting table waiting your drink come back while you're thirsty  tend keep staring back room waiting re emerge  wouldn't big deal if place hopping but again only other table seated whole time there   Between bad service even worse food place gets 1 star  some great Ramen places Chinatown strongly recommend finding another  <EOR> Just amazing! teriyaki chicken really good overall look place cool D much pick but hopefully more stuff added onto menu  overall IT! <EOR> love theme ! love takoyaki but tried miso soup could use some work therefore bf tried reg ramen he say great! maybe next time but coming back! hopely watch naruto eat ramen yay <EOR> One new spots now  really live furikake fries  ramen awesome well atmosphere great  More importantly everyone works dressed some sort anime costume  <EOR> This place runs solely gimmicks only matter time before gimmick stops working    Me boyfriend walk first impressions yet shaken  expecting anime wall art costumed servers  actually looks inviting  left notice small shelf else? manga some issues Shonen Jump  Interestingly some manga yellow labels spine indicate belonged city's library district some point  Anyways apropos reading material given theme place   We're promptly seated booth closest back even though there's some anime playing TVs few other customers notice its eerily quiet  Then realize there's no noises kitchen  None  There's also no scents food air  If blindfolded probably wouldn't guess you're ramen joint    I order tonkotsu boyfriend gets vegetarian miso mango smoothie boba  smoothie tastes sweet milky enough mango saw server dump sweetened condensed milk into blender  personally think its strange ingredient smoothies thats probably why didn't care $4 50 drink  Amount boba provided rather small   Tonkotsu arrives huge disappointment  pork broth barely flavor if any leaving caramelized onions greatly overpower ramen  noodles bland soggy  egg zero seasoning just hard boiled egg due its lack ANY flavor felt place ramen  ended finishing noodles because whole dish fail  miso vegetarian ramen reported also incredibly bland noodles  Check paid left   And service? servers looked hated job wanted shifts over especially waitress  She mostly mumbled when she spoke very much indifferent when she checked meal progress  Considering Anime Ramen's Facebook page 90% photos servers posing all cute peace signs being made whatnot other 10% being food shots zero percent showcasing menu I'd figure more effort would made service but guess its literally all style no substance  guessing ridiculous costumes problem? <EOR> Back soon?  guess habits really hard break   Anyway talked manager very nice very apologetic things told   Sadly kimchee vegetarian but could before since different brands time time   However miso vegetarian   no fish previously told   Good news girl!  So some Miso Ramen vegetarian style   leaves pork fish cake egg leaving behind corn seaweed bean sprouts tofu   really can't complain much ramen because such carb freak thanks Italian genes! noodles hit spot   However miso little plain kicked bit condiments provided table   definitely good way warm unusual rainy day!  My husband veggie fried rice now know missing Chinese options north   fried rice really good!  might stolen more couple bites him   Now feel good coming back excited another noodle soup available rotation!  Plus way home easy hit when mood strikes   Thank again manager being patient vegetarian   really appreciate it! <EOR> The food pretty good love tempura green tea!!! love Asians anime shoulda came 5pm  when Sakura's walked in  Restaurant should more decorated anime though  Name sounds better looks  <EOR> Cute little place  Don't mistake cheap stiff shrimp powder  offer decent menu fair   ramen teriyaki even sliders   Love ambience  Food cheap deliscious good portion size    Staff friendly polite  <EOR> Love place    Love decor    Love ramen    Love karaage   love free Thai tea boba    Hahahahhaha <EOR> Absolutely cute!!

Anyway  all cosplay see   waitresses kept yelling  Iraashaimase in high pitched voice    every single time customer entered left shop   greeting really annoying distracting 4th time     The decor simple reminded brother's room when he middle school posters all over    Anime posters decorate walls while Dragon Ball Z or Dragon Ball Z Kai  which ever was played two TVs    I ordered tonkotsu ramen well   I've tasted better   ramen noodles where soft soft soaked broth some time before brought table   flavoring wasn't memorable can't seem recall   Throughout meal couldn't help but compare ramen meal Santouka Mitsuwa Marketplace NJ   Santouka's way better way   The only great thing ramen shop waitresses really attentive   Overall experience food so so  <EOR> Other then fact am anime fan  daddy daughter day baby girl wanted some ramen  come greeted nicely ambiance great  Loved service made daughter smile  Great place eat food delicious  Next time gotta try sumo bowl challenge  <EOR> I've anime manga fan 25 years cosplayer 20  also tad snarky regards chosen fandom  seeing new ramen ya named Anime Ramen had give shot  lunch underwhelmed sadly  But staunch lover Monta expectations very high there's that    The atmosphere fantastic if adore Naruto current anime trends  blast anime video game soundtracks which fine but everyone's cup tea  place trying maid cafe concept Japan but bit lacking  girls don't wear wig caps head anime esque wigs look only low quality but VERY messy  friendly enough but seem bit scared things still  guess some first wait service job shows    food only average me  gyoza tasted frozen bag tonkotsu ramen okay but delicious Monta me  give 3 paper thin slices bland chashu ramen  thing loved ramen?

Anwyays yes menu small but more could want? ramen fried rice some appetizers bento boxes  they're portions actually decent size price you're paying   At $8 bowl ordered miso ramen tom yum ramen kimchi fried rice $6 usual teri beef ?   First off isn't Monta Ichiza but give guys kudos trying bring concept Vegas  fried rice better expected actually enjoyed better Shuseki's version  Ichiza's still favorite  only thing rice did contain pork if you're pork fan might want note before order it   The Miso ramen wasn't bad  guy ordered enjoyed very much said very flavorful  tasted broth broth nicely flavored  bland but also salty   I ordered tom yum ramen honestly couldn't stop eating it! love tom yum version very comparable some Thai places around town  Add some ramen chicken mushrooms winner winner chicken dinner  ordered spicier but alas still needed kick notch  Just thinking crave bowl  Normally can't down big bowls ramen which bit surprisingly since usually big appetite but did find myself scrapping bottom bowl  surprised never happens! full but determinded waste  top off Thai Ice Tea boba down great it    So being said yes Monta Ichiza but least give try judge yourself  concept especially since Vegas! Despite some might say think Las Vegas pretty decent Chinatown compared some other cities  need support places before away economy  <EOR> The best ramen ever had  noodle cooked just right soup phenomenal give plenty meat   We ordered Shoyu Ramen Miso Ramen both just perfect  also Honey Toast    yum yum yum  back again sure  <EOR> Great place grub  Loved food pretty much tried lot things never gets old me  Service awesome quick kind no matter picky needa be  Environment really supports name bu still keeps originality  Thumbs part! <EOR> I literally did illegal U Turn place when saw sign!

But doesn't end check cute collectible card if though actual trading card game anime! Did want more? calendar   But anyway service far best lately  Today when place settled busy server attended services very often even squeezed little time nice conversation along group six  If ever served sweet girl named Ivy then you're sure lucky   I've gone quite few times tried following California Rolls  never order them separately appetizer but liked having them extra little addition rice plates  nice serving despite only having two hits spot mild taste sushi simply just some  Also seems bit bigger pieces 'nicer' places  But said hits spot since included why some?  Teriyaki Beef Plate  beef could more flavorful but swear came close asking more sauce since practically picking off plate  Honestly better but bad   Tonkatsu Rice Plate  bowl curry bit confusing first glance  used dipping something  more closely related barbeque sauce type flavor considering don't curry much begin bit iffy start  But glad opened since along nicely cutlets  Mmm mmm mmm! finished every last bite!  Tonkatsu Ramen  far favorite bowl ramen also tried udon opinion captivate taste buds quite bit more simply because extra thickness noodles   Shoyu Ramen  bit boyfriend's almost good Tonkatsu although didn't seem fulfill nicely latter  Maybe just simply tad much stuff single bowl?  [Furikake] French Fries  Only because feed broke starving friend did sent table  Just tip ask bigger serving Japanese mayo before anything else  won't regret especially since really sweet compliment simple salty side dish!  Mochi Ice Cream  Nice chewy good way  They're fairly small but just same kind serving would find another restaurant such Kobe Ichiza    Honey Toast Ice Cream  Rich sweet taste gets taste buds just does when Ichiza's although quite different take  Both equally good however sweetness just takes place world   Strawberry Boba  Only tried sip two friend's glass don't regret it! overwhelmingly powerful but sweet enough give 'mmm' factor  love boba balls chewy glad did just that compares favorite spots boba Tea Station Volcano Tea   Overall consider Anime Ramen quaint little place great sitting back comfortably group friends great service nostalgic anime good relatively cheap food  definitely want place become regular spot visit close friends! <EOR> Cutest place ever! waitress helped looked she literally jumped anime  She dressed maid outfit looked super cute  Service overall excellent  greeted when came waitress checked frequently  food ordered tonkotsu miso ramen order chicken wings  ramen kind biased because comparing Monta   Miso ramen Kind bland  some miso flavor but overall wasn't enough  did though came bunch extra stuff half egg bean sprouts cha shiu onion etc   Tonkotsu ramen Kind salty! Pretty much opposite miso  lol  Once again did came bunch extra stuff similar miso   Chicken wings Yum!

Never noticed   I still quite satisfied meal earlier day yup In n Out figured dessert way here  Tempura ice cream sounded good  other words fried ice cream  Tried green tea version because other option just plain vanilla    I really liked presentation sizable ball fried ice cream whipped cream sprinkles chocolate drizzle  thick tempura shell crispy outside spongy inside also tended fall open blooming flower  sure if intentional but looked cool anyway  also pretty satisfying dessert   There's quantity food challenge Sumo Bowl  We're guessing around 7 8 pounds food total including almost 3 lbs noodles pre cooked weight gotta drink broth  60 minutes even if finish early stay entire time  Maybe want sure don't those reversals fortune something  think only six winners date probably know half them   Did Sumo Bowl look good? Definitely  long would need? Hmm maybe week   big ass bowl  Looks nice salad bowl filled brim noodles broth all usual ramen additions   There few types ramen regular menu along some tasty looking teriyaki dishes  hope back try them future date  <EOR> came back again delicious tonkotsu guess what? delicious anymore   soup ALL oil   almost point where its jelly side rather liquid   time find new place eat tonkotsu ramen because don't reason come anymore  <EOR> Food good however service slow  mean really long does take sushi mochi     if your business yelp better know provide service  Just sayin  food then service  People come expect atleast good great excellent services choice then maybe your customers give better review yelp  come back again 3 months re evaluate  <EOR> Food 7 10 Udon ramen taste prepacked but sure hits spot lunch hangout price reasonable too  Comfort food comfortable Drinks 6 10 Ramune soda gatorade    Alcohol coming soon should specialty themed drinks clean glasses Environment 9 10 Anime themed paintings adorn wall various popular anime series play 42 flatscreen anime music playing speakers    Im anime heaven!

Exactly aren't any  Vegas anime community may large LA NYC but its still large enough warrant themed restaurant two   where Anime Ramen comes in   Tucked away small 10x20 ft space corner chinatown shopping center Lies small quaint little restaurant  Even Restaunts window sign spills slightly over neighboring restaurants window space  didn't notice till owner other restaurant yelling owner place  Its small innocent can't help but wish good things place    Much building space servers cute petite friendly  Very helpful pleasing eyes  various Hooter esqe joints area plagued with  Anyone looking anime friendly place don't need look any further    BUT no point place if food horrible right? let tell food isn't horrible all  also best town  I'd say place pretty good its worth  Sure ramen portions aren't large other restaurant but $7 10 healthy bowl ramen fine  Don't expect eating foie gras some Kobe beef carpaccio  Ramen comfort food does its job just fine    My two friends tried all different kinds Pork seafood miso  flavor all 3 don't overpower you  smells good tasted good all agreed good food  great but good Regardless your opinion place others feel its mandatory any anime manga fan least try place  Since very sure things just don't come around Vegas all    Come food stay atmosphere  Possible good hangout spot anime manga fans alike  <EOR> It's cute concept but meh   The place clean service good decor engaging   But ramen isn't worth returning for   soup base bland noodles aren't anything special toppings decent but can't save nothing soup base   Another problem complete utter lack regular soy sauce   All available low sodium version  obviously know product requires condiments because give pile them regular soy sauce baffling  <EOR> The atmosphere upbeat wait staff dressed cosplay interesting  ordered Shoyu ramen husband ordered Tomyum w seafood udon  Both bowls noodles tasty   I wasn't all impressed calamari but idk if should expected more anyway  Mediocre best   We also weren't fans unsweetened tea  guess expecting kind unsweetened tea you'd most restaurants  Theirs Japanese tea better served hot cold   Also though music added environment hard hear waitress saying over loud beats playing overhead   On upside though really good mango bobs  <EOR> I thought place great idea but quality ramen lousy  tonkatsu broth did any pork flavor all noodles so  Hope better  <EOR> Went friend family some guests town wanted hit Anime themed restaurant before took off   The interior nicely decorated but look bit narrower Vietnamese fast food deli replaced  Quite possibly because havent long Kaya decided take some real estate   I know RAMEN house but didnt exactly eat any ramen  know horrible right   Anyway group decided order bunch appetizer sushi rolls man tell those add quick they're cheap  Drinks made order if you're coming large group then expect wait minute   Good note boba drinks willing mix flavors together but cant guarantee outcome    I'm willing give Anime Ramen another updated review  trip just catch some friends scope place future reference  <EOR> I admit place little intriguing when first heard read it  Waitresses dressed cosplay outfits serving ramen? Thats awesome thought! haha prices def decent serving sizes  far quality ill give 7 put 10  someplace ide def again just because  atmosphere staff all friendly play anime movies while eat  <EOR> If ever attended themed Maid Cosplay cafe Japan otherwise half time food isn't really typical standard regular teriyaki noodle house   oftentimes simple notion enjoying themed meal cute servers entertaining atmosphere     Thankfully when stopped Anime Ramen Teriyaki Cafe few days ago overall pleasant experience thanks part clean establishment chirpy genki esque girls pretty decent food   The angle course Anime   Giant prints hang walls anime Japanese Animation work such Kenshin Naruto Bleach other popular titles   Thank God twenties teens because if teens would lost mind all  the  time     I tried teriyaki sliders pork based noodle bowl iced tea which original mix theirs   tea pretty decent sliders excellent nicely presented pork bowl flavourful good chunks meat Udon noodles Which presented choice  sliders definitely best feature meal   Pho kind guy prefer Pho over Ramen more flavourful healthier depending venue far salt concerned  I wanted boba tea but boba no go   Apparently also liquor license way we'll see over     Service litle scattered but otherwise very pleasant   servers adorable girls wigs greet see typical Japanese phrases although ordering Japanese doesn't work don't try show off your skills if hanasemasu Nihongo  managed talk into trying Honey Toast which despite love Ichiza tried disliked due overly sweet only enjoy 1 3 actual toast which really good!  Think Honey French Toast every bit edible less deal with     So said quite pleased Anime Ramen Cafe but room improvement being business all three weeks old I would see better pacing meal i e  if order appetizer meal I'd appetizer arrive prior actual meal  My water refills little slow all three waitresses minutes within each other attempt talk into dessert even first waitress talked into it  A football game monitor?  Seriously?  People come geek don't put anything else but programs pertaining scene   Cute place decent food friendly service   your anime fan on  <EOR> Cute little ramen place friendly service cool atmosphere  looked place hang friends casual meal  Unfortunately food wasn't really impressive  ordered Tonkatsu Ramen tasted fine but just tad under seasoned  also ordered   Chicken Karaage  nicely fried but bland side  place potential but enough moment  <EOR> Came because saw anime ramen  Husband loves naruto but disappointment  Service but slow lacking  still menus hands bringing food  Then ordered food brought wrong ramen   ramen no good   Tom yum ramen didn't taste tom yum   Miso ramen didnt taste good either   wanted come back but can't do  <EOR> A few days ago friend running errands around Vegas saw sign  Anime Ramen  Being super responsible did stop but really really really wanted to   When call location dinner next night immediately suggested Anime Ramen  group 8 restaurant but delayed stuff conference for  grabbed more friends hour later joined original group  Another group saw squees foursquare checkins popped leaving   I think glancing sign least 60 people try anime ramen last weekend very very glad all did  location feel non creepy Akihabra maid cafe but tasty ramen cute sushi  thought noodles particularly well done  didn't care much meat  sushi really cute but fairly mediocre  really liked tried give them cute names them themed  loved favorite movie Spirited Away playing screens ate  Canvas wrapped anime prints nice touch  wait staff attentive adorable    I really wish place existed LA but am happy something new interesting visit Vegas  <EOR> I tried Tom Yum soup husband Shoyu ramen   Both ok   boba tea better   Lots flavors pretty good!    They offer tofu ramen which think unique   anime theme cute   service efficient   servers nice but  think server uniforms funny   those poor girls really wear those awful platinum blonde wigs?  The parking lot packed Friday night people parked fire lanes!  But restaurant dead   If need some quick food don't want wait hour Ichiza option  <EOR> Love place! You greeted smile every time  menu fun simple understand  don't ton options but thats ok everything great!  Tom Yum fantastic  Meso great! Pork Belly rice best ever day! even better CUT If love Ramen fun atmosphere great service need Anime Ramen Teriyaki! <EOR> this place dope tasty ramen great vibe!!  ramen lunch satay dinner   ask two pup special <EOR> Came finally see all hype though big anime fan  Anyhoo! The takoyaki definitely good  ordered seafood ramen tonkotsu tonkotsu shoyu  Food also good although left side ordered weren't crazy tonkotsu  Service wasn't fastest but decent drinks  Biggest complaint cold place was 35 F outside much warmer inside  Warmed ramen multitudes people came though servers super helpful  Might try again when no longer Antarctica! <EOR> Service good  just didn't care ramen food  Very bland me  Maybe just hard come when fuji ichiban Guam! Anyways love whole concept  pretty cool anime everywhere waiters dressed but probably would never unless friends wanted go  <EOR> Food bad all pretty simple stuff  Ramen fries some basic Chinese dishes  staff willing help need but seem quite timid towards customers shy times when question  Only certain waitresses The ambiance calm anime playing background times play Japanese music well  quite loud times but maybe just getting old    Price wise nothing complain about  Main dishes range around $10 although some drinks appetizers seem over priced amount get  food comes fairly quickly only if ramen all other dishes come pretty slow sometimes    All all good place if want quick ramen fix  <EOR> Food could better but nice all employees super fun dressed theme  loved Thai Tea w Boba good  Most places don't put enough milk taste bitter but put lot loved <EOR> When first walked into restaurant very interesting  restaurant decorated Anime pictures waitresses wore Anime costumes  really excited down some food menu started preparing big order  ordered Japanese pizza which very good but HOT let cool awhile before burn roof your mouth calamari which lightly breaded cooked perfectly  furikaki french fries interested but furikaki didn't stick well fries my suggestion add mild cheese maybe lite wasabi mayo help furikaki stick better   also ordered teriyaki sliders which good miso ramen tasty  finished off meal honey toast ice cream which VERY YUMMY!  would again but maybe next time skip all appetizer straight ramen  If wondering why 3 5 stars waitress took drink order never came back! waited good 15 minutes until waitress B FINALLY noticed came retake order  only table entire restaurant time  fan bad service since service industry  girls need step cause cute doesn't cut it  <EOR> I Tuesday night when first walked noticed COOL anime posters walls layout restaurant awesome! waitress dress anime outfit! hot that!?? taught wow place kind  order tum yum seafood ramen noodles $10 due seafood suppose  taught pricey due lack seafood actually bowl  more mushrooms then anything  Any dish good  service cool real nice laid back  definitely recommend if your into noodles anime fan! Enjoy! <EOR> It nice atmosphere  Okay service  Ordered Miso Ramen okay well  Also ordered salmon sashimi surprisingly fresh  cheap good food  probably most likely return here  <EOR> I came 4 pm 12 2 12 ate dinner I always wanted try Tonkotsu  ramen but im very picky eater little worried if would not  But gave try im very glad did   grandfather few different  things dinner all very yummy!  French fries ketchup japanese mayo very crispy hot just way them! mayo different then american mayo its more creamy little sweet little salty very good mixed ketchup fries   Tonkotsu ramen only pork very good! Creamy salty did nice pork flavor definitely worth try   Teriyaki chicken sweet good chicken flavor Over all very good experience glad tryed something new ! <EOR> I shoyu ramen surprisingly good! overpowering but very good flavor  did add cilantro mushroom which just made better  Another positive add ons reasonably priced Cilantro 25 cents mushrooms 75 cents   Personally could give ____ anime which why took while come here  lots walls menus made look anime anime playing TVs servers dress anime girls  think servers anime very weird wear wigs talk high voices when speaking customers  Even would certainly come again  Total shoyu ramen cilantro mushroom added $10 including tax w o tip <EOR> I tipped off friend heard Ichiza's chef new ramen spot worth try   Cute anime themed waitresses ramen even Thai dish too   try it!  Feeling spicy mood ordered tom yum ramen noodles   also ordered California rolls   heard owner someone associated owner used own Thai restaurants town   quite surprised tasty tom yum was!  expected more Japanese slant classic Thai dish but surprisingly pretty much Thai style   Lemongrass galanga root basil   broth nice savory flavor slight tang it   ramen noodles good tom yum which guess actually did give Japanese twist   friend thought noodles slightly overcooked but didn't detect anything mine   ordered level 8 spice level waitress thought crazy white guy   Well level more 5   Still good stuff though!  The California rolls generous size   tasty perhaps best tasting CA rolls ever but great appetizer     My friend did Tonkotsu but he felt noodles Chashu better 'that other ramen place'   would maybe say ramen just different style perhaps healthier 'that other ramen place'     I fun would again   service very friendly although perhaps bit inexperienced   waitress tough time splitting check between 8 people   Still she constantly checked even struck some casual conversation   She definitely serious job cute too    hard find combination town! <EOR> I've place twice now never found anything wrong food  gotten Naruto roll each time both eaqually delicious  also gotten ramen beef stew bowl both times also  some best ramen ever had  can't good home  Service always excellent  First time very busy service never suffered  Very awsome atmosphere excellent music always good anime showing tv  <EOR> I kind expected more place  huge fan anime since elementary school idea cosplay cafe appealed much dream  doesn't hearing J POP while eating?!  The ambiance place nice waitresses cute yes service however lacking  bf waiting quite some time some napkins wasn't waitresses noticed but some man suppose works well    We both ordered noodle soup tonkatsu bf some beef noodle  noticed bf didn't really enjoy much being first time having ramen outside home wasn't sure its usually suppose taste but ramen way salty liking  meat nice tender though however  gyozas ordered good well but pretty small considering price  <EOR> Ramen bland horrible service  If you're guy you'll probably better service servers  If want good ramen suggest Monta Ramen  Much better food  <EOR> There Las Vegas evo 2012  cruising around Asian town heading back hotel while saw it  think only reason why wanted because word Anime  night noticed anime pictures walls  Ok   cool  When inside seated all shocked amazed find all workers cos play  all guys into anime  only time see cos play during Kawaii con Hawaii  girls all cute Asian  lovely   liked most Ploy because she waitress  She cheerful cool  night Kpop playing  playing kpop songs kpop playlist ipod  also anime movies episodes playing    Now food  loved it     just need try  vanilla tempura die for  didn't share that    If back Vegas again  <EOR> Kawaii  This novelty restaurant   menu comic book style many fan art pieces walls servers dress up   food ok drinks little better   tend order takoyaki green apple boba share ramen   Cutesy fun theme restaurant closest maid cafe LV  <EOR> The prices decent first off!!!  ramen awesome!  friend both ordered appetizers first   ordered California rolls Gyoza munch  prior each $5 6 each which decent delicious!!

Japanese chicken pizza good but particularly special because tasted resembled more bbq chicken pizza traditional okonomiyaki  Overall great time watching anime while slurping yummy noodies   The restaurant located smaller section Chinatown plaza Ten Ren Tea Station Ichiza izakaya location convenient driving only $10 taxi ride Strip  only complaint flagging down taxi Chinatown takes forever recommend waiting taxi dropping off people larger Chinatown plaza  <EOR> So today Anime ramen very first time  ordered gyoza budae jjigae ramen  gyoza fantastic  ate chili oil table heaven  ramen perfect  Perfect texture perfect flavor  couldn't happier food  waitresses all wore anime style wigs costume  fun experience would highly recommend place anyone looking great bowl ramen  <EOR> The ramen alright definitely find better ramen other places  also wanted order Thai Iced Tea which menu but said ran out  decor wait staff really cute though  <EOR> OMG read other reviews honest HATED IT!

If muted taste buds then place you   I thought place would packed Saturday night figured would long wait when parking lot fighting spot    best part whole experience walking into restaurant being seated right away seems all cars lot Yagyu!  FYI vegetarians Miso Ramen states vegetarian menu Torrance paid extra $2 add chicken  don't meat meals no adjustment needed order  When soup arrived pork floating top noodles  don't eat pork    much being vegetarian    Hurry try place if love Anime just eat somewhere else before go   I suggest having $1 soda  <EOR> I expected place more bright n cute Hello Kitty all over place before walked but more small cozy cafe style greeted girls japanese animation character costume ? aware little shocked first trying hard laugh   they super nice though   food kinda pricey compare other ones even drinks least $2 more usually pay exact same drink chinatown  over all okay! <EOR> I'm fan because service good atmosphere fun  5 year old's FAVORITE restaurant  come several times ordered spicy ramen udon bowls  food A ok boba drinks good too  wish more stuff udon bowl    wish spicy ramen wasn't all color  hot dogs broth even noodles all just look same color  Some greens would nice   The decor very cute  TV screens playing anime  Waitresses dressed anime characters  Definitely cute cute  They're open pretty late night weekends too  <EOR> Best pick me EVER  Vegas usually means being nocturnal forgetting eat  Aka during EDC weekend somehow didn't eat meal 26 hours  Yes horrible planning part     ecstatic eat some filling ramen!!

Update back several times since say thing  If when first opened didn't broth back try again  They're constantly improving broth  Every time better last time   You guys think place may actually good Monta now    <EOR> Anime Ramen seemed pretty interesting  interesting idea but practice? don't know  just me  The servers came off standoffish barely said anything  No smile no greeting  created awkward atmosphere lasted through entire meal  As food pork belly rice which okay  better  liked pork belly wasn't greasy appreciated side salad gave alongside it   My server ended taking plate which sizable amounts food still it when wasn't finished yet  would think would ask first  Anyway bottom line am coming back? No  <EOR> At first uhhh where heck friends taken me   ? then DUG HARD!  good food cute atmosphere!!!!  wanna dress too!! <EOR> The kimchi potent but good thai iced tea delicious but food average  experience being served attractive women Cosplay flavor extensive menu  <EOR> Very fun space if you're anime fan even if you've game while just looking little nostalgia   walls adorned various anime posters Kiki's Delivery Service playing flat screen TV small bookshelf plenty manga sits near front restaurant though admittedly deterred looming presence extra large bottle hand sanitizer sitting top bookshelf    course also cosplaying servers dressed at least visit anime style maid outfits cheerfully welcome restaurant   The food surprisingly good   gyoza solid Tonkotsu ramen noodle soup some nice flavoring though unsurprisingly quality ingredients  particularly meat  doesn't compete some noodle joints Strip   honey toast simple savory dessert  toast three pieces bread cover them honey put scoop vanilla ice cream middle   Unfortunately ice cream frozen rock solid when came but eventually relented chipping away spoons   Prices pretty reasonable though can't fairly recommend restaurant its food alone   other hand if you're looking pretty fun environment usually don't see outside Japan occasional anime convention then give Anime Ramen Teriyaki try   side note little bit pain if you're visiting Las Vegas without use rental car but didn't regret making trek  <EOR> A second anime restaurant Vegas opening month apart? check out  small but very modern printed anime canvas decorate walls  fun showing off nerdy naming anime there  anime playing flat screan monitor  menu made look page manga  Pretty funny pretty cool  thought awesome place Vegan option! YAY!

Pink wigs  Blue wigs  Animal ears  waitresses cosplay adorable! And restaurant pretty  I ordered soft shell crab worst preparation dish ever had  some kind thick batter maybe panko but somehow tasted bad entirely inedible  The kim chee fried rice mediocre tonkatsu ramen  I'm actually sad food here  <EOR> ***4 5 stars***   I try place reading fellow yelper Tony T's review   When stepped into restaurant instantly felt Tokyo  cute little waitresses maid outfits reminded maid cafes Tokyo   only difference speak very good English don''t call customers Master     Since soft opening all menu items 25% off   sweet deal considering expensive Japanese food could be   But actually menu items reasonably priced   gyoza karaage fried chicken tonkotsu ramen miso ramen grilled salmon platter   All under $30 00 25% off    gyoza quite tasty but must say smallest gyoza ever had   karaage chicken wings came ketchup Japanese mayonnaise dip   good but probably would order again because deep fried   miso ramen   presentation ramen bowl very pretty just ones Japan   miso broth though could more concentrated but bad   wife tonkotsu ramen she really enjoyed it   broth excellent egg sliced roasted pork other condiments complemented each other very well   roasted pork slices ramen could sliced little more thicker   friend grilled salmon platter   came two pieces sushi steamed rice broccoli macaroni salad   She substituted macaroni salad seaweed salad   She also enjoyed dish   only thing didn't fact two waitress kept coming around wanting clear away dishes when haven't even finished eating   service little annoying side them coming every 5 minutes check us    But won't keep coming back food quite good authentic gets   needs Japan good ramen just step into Anime Ramen enjoy! <EOR> I decided adventurous grab take out completely different place   glad tried but completely sold yet   I ordered honeydew milk tea overwhelmingly sweet   Now know honeydew sweet but tried number different places know non saccharine version exists   I'd willing try different flavor future but would recommend staying away honeydew if don't want something excessively sweet   I ordered tonkotsu apologies if butchered spelling ramen   liked option ramen udon noodles really liked way packed soup take home   The broth rich delicious egg wonderful but stars crispy caramelized onions   thrilled pork little surprised only three thin slices   made mistake adding much magu again   apologies spelling broth flavor overwhelmed everything   I'm willing try again because think potential think partly responsible making underwhelming  <EOR> Finally chance try place cold rainy night  perfect time some hot ramen belly! place located Chinatown below Ichiza  neon sign anime characters outside hard miss   Right when walked greeted bright neon colors anime characters all over restaurant  Anime cartoons blasted flat screen TVs  cute waitresses costumes looked stepped anime  attention detail execution concept impressive!  I little ticked off first because waitresses took while take order  place wasn't busy seemed didn't priorities straight when sitting 15 minutes waitress sweeping    My husband ordered Karaage Chicken Wings start  He ordered Shoyu Ramen Tonkotsu Ramen  Luckily food didn't take long  weird brought ramen before wings but no biggie  husband tasted each other's soup although liked Tonkotsu Ramen better wasn't great  other Yelpers said just doesn't compare Monta The chicken wings actually boneless also mediocre    We Honey Toast dessert favorite part meal  always hear good Ichiza's Honey Toast but always full try it  don't know which better but really enjoyed dessert here   The waitresses good checking food brought initial annoyance away  also give them extra brownie points being darn cute!  All all Anime Ramen cute concept great place hang group friends however when craving ramen don't think go to place  <EOR> Good unique small dine simple flavors  <EOR> the weather finally cooled down better way celebrate some ramen  decided try place because anime theme sounded cool  definately different walking see bright haired waitresses Anime TV  Menu pretty small tried Terri Sliders Tonkatsu Ramen   The sliders tasty  cooked perfectly grilled pineapple chunk lettuce tomato onion 4 little ones $7  little overpriced  The Ramen very tasty  Broth nice plentiful amount noodles some pork 1 2 egg $8  I would back more ramen fix especially if other place crowded  <EOR> I love Place  Jenny best  even better when she dresses Hatsune Miku!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Vegas must now  <EOR> 3 stars novelty dressup staff decor   memorable   however food so   japanese   tried various ramen tonkotsu miso great broth   didn't karaage   sliders kinda amateur homemade but tasty enough   pork rice fine   oozes cuteness but  it <EOR> Anime Ramen? laughed bit but heck why give try   The decor pretty simple gets job  anime canvas posters wall anime window poster shade things side  girls work dress maids typical anime girl hair adds well overall theme restaurant    They nice but service needs little bit fine tuning  Waitress came read drinks menu when said water she took away menu without giving chance take look  seem nice girls though   Now important part FOOD!  I comparing food Monta lot because   beat   Definitely same level Monta ramen slightly more expensive @ $8 bowl   way serve ramen interesting spoon lays perfectly side bowl but soup filled only height noodles  Personally prefer noodles drowned soup  miso ramen somewhat bland but increase price come few extra amenities half egg corn  Tonkotsu ramen soup less salty Monta but didn't deliver  pork served also thinner Monta's  no problem noodles since cooked al dente  Lastly gyoza okay taste did compensate its smaller size @ $5 plate   At time don't take any credit cards other Master weird unless you're paying debit    I probably come back future try chicken wings but no rush come back  <EOR> I love place!    The secret gotta mood   coming since opened but don't everyday   If crave noodle soup your way home stops   service friendly   could Anime toons smiling while order   if walls TV aren't enough impress there's always food  regular shoyu ramen kimchi fried rice   But always open new menu too  Last week tried some deep fried battered balls Tako but forgot name   The girls pushing in nice way snag calender but didn't really catch eye   models beautiful  sure but background simple   didn't match  looked much homemade rushed  Oh well maybe next year but now just food eye candy  <EOR> It sucked  Food mediocre  Service even worse  two waiters   asked water 3 times <EOR> This unique place  Wall wall pictures anime including several TVs playing nonstop anime  food isn't bad  Mediocre ramen maybe bit sub par udon but if decor more it  There's big screen near back cycles through all girls cosplay uniforms stats favorites  Fantastic dinner entertainment some odd others  Waitresses dress colorful wigs cute outfits but watch pink haired she's feisty  Boss house kinda feisty    They sell calendar $10 if you're into sort thing  <EOR> It just indescribable lovely warm joint its staff smile everytime pay visit   The resto theme absolutely unique striking   All staff dress just live anime characters   cute friendly   The food isn't all bad either   joint tries hook variety foods snacks   real meals ramen teriyaki as name called    Also boba drinks desserts available   place great spot chilling     The speed delivered right timing   Thus spot also great quick meal if quick lunch break well  <EOR> 5 STARS SUPA COOL!!

I'll give cosplay girls credit though good job service   Attentive kind pretty point   No complaints there   But food just didn't leave any kind lasting impression me   ok nothing special me   I tried shoyu ramen night   $8 thought bit skimpy side bowl small!  really wish more noodles slurp up   broth rather bland tastes   didn't much shoyu flavor deep broth flavor any kind matter left bit disappointed   added extra soy sauce bowl tasted bit better but still good enough   Maybe broth could used more beef pork bones?  Perhaps more bonito?  maybe even dash MSG?  dunno just wasn't great me   I also tried teriyaki chicken rice plate   ok best teriyaki but worst   Chicken small size portions I am over 200 pounds people! but least rice good veggies cooked just right     There other things try little menu various other ramen bowls teriyaki dishes few salads appetizers including teri sliders furikake fries which heard very good   nothing over menu $10 so   Value wise sounds good but man those portions seem small!  place great lighter eaters   Me thinks unfortunately paying anime themed ambiance   place way more stock quality quantity taste your food   Size matters! <EOR> okay honest truth place  best food town?  exactly but good  love waitresses dress anime extremely sweet!

First off decided try boba milk tea cappuccino flavor which wasn't good idea  end taste little weird also made bloated I usually water guess shouldn't anything other that full easier probably different guys    The ramen pretty yummy  definitely liked it  saw beansprouts being little odd but actually fit quite well me  ramen $8 but came during 25% off soft opening special ended $6 us  tonkotsu ramen came pork egg   Service bit off cause ask three times before water  servers dressed anime outfits especially colorful hair they're friendly  probably try boba smoothie my friend loved strawberry boba smoothie next time some appetizers ^^v  <EOR> Ordered miso ramen  good  bad spectacular but good  Found black hair 1 3 way through entangled noodles  Jay son very apologetic offered another bowl comp however already lost appetite kindly declined  He brought honey toast house which pretty good  French toast vanilla ice cream honey  Excellent customer service nice atmosphere  Ok ramen but nothing would come back for  <EOR> Average manga themed ramen spot Chinatown Vegas next Asian restaurants AYCE Japanese sushi restaurant ayce KBBQ place   say manga theme because cute waitresses wear colorful wigs Japanese cartoon outfits modeled Anime magazines menu Spicy! Hot! popping cartoonish fonts    biggest draw though because food itself somewhat bland took long time come out   miso ramen split order kim chi fried rice karaage chicken but ramen tasted bland wasn't exciting   chicken oily meat dry but crispy   fried rice just ok but memorable   don't mean nitpick guess expecting some pop flavor excitement cartoon themed restaurant   wanted cute place waitresses really cute   suppose huge anime video game fan otaku? would crazy place want try everything menu whenever town   also serve boba  <EOR> I used come all time    place seriously suffering now    Found hair food    sent back didnt eat paid left disgusted!!!!!!!!!!!! The appetizer did eat disgusting well  Tofu didnt seem fresh   Never coming back  The young girls inexperienced servers well    <EOR> Great concept  Good ramen  You probably never see something your lifetime   I taken off guard place original feel was   walk immediately surrounded framed anime art anime playing flat panels cute servers dyed hair cat ears AKA Cosplay   felt kid nerd come really enoyable   The ramen quite good but real draw place theme atmosphere   only reason didn't give place 5th star because better ramen Los Angeles  <EOR> Now found best place hang girlfriends!! place super awesome  love atmosphere they showing sailor moon fav anime forever love staffs costumes services  love miso udon  love passion fruit boba slush  price ok everything under $10 think  kinda fair huge bowl ramen  definitely back again until tell stop going lol <EOR> It really neat seeing waitresses dressed anime costumes  whole place adorned anime pictures videos anime playing television screens  waitresses really nice friendly  menu seems very limited but stuff pretty good ramen is  <EOR> I am huge anime fan but know enough respect genre  am huge fan food new concepts serving food   Im going grade review both separately   The food wasn't bad but nothing stood omg  did seasoned fries but seasoning didnt stay fries made eating them kinda difficult  fried dishes lightly battered food fresh making delightful appetizer   Before forget not would ever forget bad was fried banana just right  Bananas supposed served cold eating hot mushy banana just kinda disgusting  would assume would eating hot baby food would explain few eating disorders young children   The Ramen dishes served large bowels great flavor  sushi dishes fresh but serving sizes kinda small  names amusing presentation plates cute  teenage girls loved hello kitty plate   Ok anime theme cool all caught ourselves watching different shows  wait staff sexy costumes very patient explaining different dishes rules big wheel have    We early lunch but allowed girls spin wheel gave them free cookies playing   We table 4 bill $65  Seemed bit high lunch tab but all left full enjoyed time Im considering money well spent  <EOR> This restaurant otaku's fantasy come true  waitresses pink purple wigs missing big eyes anime pictures hanging walls Final Fantasy Advent Children playing flat screen LCDs mounted wall menu designed manga  few fanboy friends would easily salivate hearing this   It mellow night when went  parking lot plaza sucks but most Asian plazas anyway  wasn't crowded all though table right away     The menu offers assortment Japanese dishes along your typical ramen your choice soup base  Tonkotsu Ramen    The ramen itself decent  soup rich flavorful  Cloudy just way it  noodles itself firmer texture prefer ramen noodles softer  few slices chashu half egg  order extra noodles fill up    I don't beats any ramen joints LA terms flavor  However pretty good Vegas's Chinatown  <EOR> Dropped finding new ramen teriyaki restaurant via Yelp  all anime characters outside might think video anime comic store but clearly ramen Teriyaki Anime  restaurant still its soft opening phase operation business still relatively slow 25%off soft opening promotion   When walked immediately greeted two uber cute very cheerful waitresses   place empty but nicely decorated although waitress said looks pho restaurant nicely decorated new pho restaurant many anime paintings art works wall basically picked where seated   The menu comic strip look nice touch     After checking menu opted try Karaage Chicken Wings Tonkotsu Ramen  chicken wings fried perfectly but served ketchup which thought untraditional chicken karaage also traditionally boneless    think simple wedge lemon would better choice   The Tonkotsu Ramen they source ramen same purveyor supplies Monta Big Wong but noodle prepared well those served Monta 1st visit  But also don't think hired ramen chef directly Japan either  now Monta's ramen still better ones served here   Finished meal Tempura Ice Cream   good size small ones served AYCE sushi places  But waitress told try Honey Toast which she said sweet ones served upstairs Ichiza I could remember if ordered but see getting next visit    Ordered Tom Yum Chicken Ramen 9 18 11 ramen cooked lot better tonight   broth yummy maybe 3 spicy level  Different waitresses talkative but still very pretty still positive experience   Decor Ambiance 4 5  Definitely sticking theme although still lot room decorating department such Anime related items decoration tables under sheet protective glass course photos cosplayers dine restaurant anime figures etc   Even some waitresses dressed maid outfits some Anime although some only donned anime colored wigs graphic tees    Service 4 5 5  Very friendly energetic attentive  I definitely gave extra star although your mileage may vary depending waitress your youthful good looks AXE application Food 3 5 5  Some items still need fine tuning but expected new restaurant soft opening phase   Would suggest serving more soup ramen lemon wedge alternative dipping sauce fried wings serving ramen WITHOUT spoon already bowl   Alcohol menu once proper licensing other requirements order   Price 2 5 5  All items under $10  Ramen san 25% soft opening discount priced higher Monta but comes 1 2 shoyu boiled egg  Personally think 25% off price competitive Japanese casual comfort food dining spot but harder sell without   Value 2 3 5  going win any Best Deals LV awards but break wallet either   Location 5 5  Very centrally located Chinatown far down street Palazzo Wynn Treasure Island  Just downstairs Ichiza few doors down Yagyu   Parking You've ask yourself question 'Do feel lucky?' Well ya punk????  Final thoughts could possibly great wotaku hangout Las Vegas just nice friendly place chill watch whatever Anime happened time  Waitresses definitely friendliest encountered around LV   yet wait table place larger seats more people Monta   Note Accepts debit cards only MasterCard moment which hopefully change Chase card processing also approved   As Oct 3 2011 no more 25% grand opening discount  <EOR> I few times already  only reason why end coming back because town friends want eat here  Anime character decor cute waitresses unique outfits but those only good things going place   The food needs lot work  tried Shoyu Miso Ramen broth very bland noodles hard  know bad when feel tastier bowl instant ramen home  Gyoza tasted frozen brands buy grocery store  California Roll okay  mean hard screw California Roll right? Furikake Fries interesting concept but furikake does stay fries  might well just serve regular fries only  Honey Toast Ice Cream probably best menu item  Nice presentation tasty sweet    The service also needs lot work  Other very first visit servers horrible  always ask drink refills nothing all  last visit ask napkins because forgot give some  9 table  Really?! Also don't even think ordering sliders because some reason take forever come kitchen  Parking? Nonexistent    If really curious place would say once see its about  If looking decent place eat don't waste your money here! <EOR> the ambiance definitely good place pretty big bigger Monta service good too  ordered 3 things menu shoyu ramen braised pork burger steak plate  food ok but say think Monta still better food wise  think more variety monta but Monta far best Ramen place eaten far  eaten ramen place hawaii still think monta better  only difference noodles already come all different add ons monta's pretty plain   but guess simplicity better  Price wise ok too  mean definitely worth try judge yourself  <EOR> Before talk quality food service Anime Ramen first want address something caught attention  lived Las Vegas long time noticed rivalry dislike many Asians each other here  read reviews below reviews many other Asian owned establishments yelp notice always group conservative Japanese Filipino mainland Chinese yelpers give negative ratings business all account owner being member Asian nationality dislike  Most family immigrated America 1800s Japan since beginning all Chinese Koreans other races Asians TOGETHER  endure Anti Asian laws discrimination internment camps mass deportation  banned marriage put concentration camps deported taxed just being Asian took houses savings rioted burned down businesses took away all freedom dignity  didn't care particular type Asian were   all same them  Asian AMERICANS ALL endure same discrimination TOGETHER   Instead hating each other should united especially due history enduring hate  America all right should all live together peace  If disagree dislike diversity then back whatever Asian country came leave Asian AMERICANS alone   Getting subject Anime Ramen   personally believe Anime Ramen better Miso Ramen much more popular Monta   Though think Monta best Shoyu world think Miso Ramen isn't great   all already know Miso Ramen favorite food world  Miso Ramen more crack various other narcotics just kidding but really love Miso Ramen   Anime thinner yet more flavorful Miso broth really enjoy  broth very similar popular Chin Ma Ya Little Tokyo LA        One best things Anime Ramen throw many sides free  Monta charge extra corn eggs 3rd slice Charsiu  Anime egg 3 slices charsiu corn all included  Also Monta buy extra noodles side because don't give much first place  Anime lot noodles bowl broth which probably 30% larger other Ramen houses Las Vegas   Surprisingly also really good french fries people can't eat Asian food  great because lot European friends just cannot eat anything comes Asia picky eaters   wish those Teriyaki fries Hawaiian restaurants but good enough  really recommend getting side fries!   The best thing place always seat open  Sometimes Monta gotta wait 30 minutes hour seat  never wait seated Anime      Maybe problem servers tend little creepy way much energy  soon took chopsticks paper wrapper Neon Anime Girl sprinted over took wrapper hand then ran across room threw away trash can  Then few minutes later used napkin moment put back down table she sprinted over again took then ran away  didn't even see coming time  literally looked she came under table  BTW use  napkin more just once know    weirdest thing told server thought Miso Ramen better Monta she all shocked practically told nice say bad things other restaurants even if competitors    I guess tell owner Japanese interior design  art displayed walls Japanese anime's popular America but extremely popular amongst Japanese anime critics such as Naruto  Pokemon  Sailor Moon   few years ago Anime themed restaurant which owned man Kobe  restaurant decorated art animes which lot cultural significance Japan such as Mazinger Z  Battleship Yamato  Galaxy Express 999  A Girl Alps  Cutey Honey  Candy Candy  Mobile Suit Gundam    first clue identifying if place actually Japanese owned but really cares that  Even if place owned someone named Marco Antonio Lopez would still come back everyday because service food really good  <EOR> if waitresses dressed anime characters then pretty much stop reading rest review since won't matter anyway   suffice say name all ambiance  hard compete when ichiza upstairs except when ichiza closed  house yaki udon which you'd expect  noodles veggies sweet sauce  prices super reasonable  if lived vegas i'd hang often    <EOR> I often but service okay   waitresses really nice but lot mistakes giving wrong people orders switching checks   food slow came different times   Some people would food first then others would wait another 20 minutes theirs   WATER GROSS tell ! Well tasted straight unfiltered tap water   suggest if water bring your own bottle   food moderately priced pretty good guess   would come back again day but hopefully service better because charge 18% tip check when didn't even give well service   should mention menu charge 18% tip  still find stupid though customers should able choose much feel waiter deserves  <EOR> My OG Ryan B date little foodie crawl decided check 28GO arrived disappointed find closed until later week  Thwarted decided head across town during rush hour no less check another spot he wanting check Chinatown  walked already feeling it  theme cute but executed well could be  atmosphere just left lot desired having misgivings before even ordered  Looking menu nothing really sparked much interest decided order spicy Tom yum udon tofu thinking relatively safe bet  Ryan B ordered beef fried rice tempura appetizer    Our meals came odd smell emanating bowl  Almost little dirty smelling?I let sit while could build enough courage take bite  kept trying trying even took two bites before totally gave up  flavor smell off  send food back reluctant it  finally decided let them know really didn't dish asked waitress return kitchen  server very kind apologetic quickly removed dish told she would remove check  really appreciated service friendly it  really didn't want send dish back glad weren't offended    While watched Ryan eat tried piece tempura ordered wasn't great  little over battered seemed frozen kind buy prepackaged store  Just fresh lacked flavor  He seemed enjoy fried rice  only saving grace restaurant friendly service but won't back  <EOR>
