Don took great care us! Made feel super welcome because found new local! Facility clean service great food drinks delicious! Keep great work!! D <EOR> Second time coming since opened  first time second day when first opened doors bartender served everyone else but us  He didn't serve until asked if some service which then he bought first round  thought ok maybe because second day  today some breakfast drinks  service terrible bartender just few patrons amongst myself she talking friend assumed because she hugging laughing gambling service slow shout excuse several times noticed  Def coming again  <EOR> We started going PT's when first opened absolutely loved Ashley bartender!  Since she left now manages own store quality customer service declined significantly   starting Rachel!  other night watch Golden Knights play video poker 2 machines use when asked deal Rachel said they're being saved just bank money !  said oh call save machine huh?! She says all know going drop ton money them! Mind  25 cent minimum machines nickel machines!!  questioned machines she other bartenders take care wouldn't even eye contact conversation 2 hours there!  She very rude friendly all unless course you're dropping ton money!!     more likely won't back! <EOR> Decent bar food bartenders really nice always put football games watch tv  <EOR> They still working kinks but server Chris manager steve way it  drinks great quesadilla good  girlfriend regulars  Happy pts neighborhood <EOR> The food absolute shit!

She suggested nachos chicken AMAZING!! <EOR> Tracie perfect example great service personality brings customers back! <EOR> I give place star ambiance  location just opened very clean  far customer service would give zero stars  attempting gamble inquired drink comps  bartender avoidant first then proceeded give run around regarding drink comps  seemed if he did want give free drinks even though friends all money machines betting least dollar  He made feel cheap asking even though Vegas about! Gambling free drinks! Needless say friends cashed Distill  <EOR> Waited hour half during Football Sunday food  All food came separately    Driest chicken sandwich EVER  Stale taco salad  fried pickles extremely salty  Everything cold  While waitress excuse everyone ordered once don't know restaurant should problem fries pickles chicken sandwich  even ran cups noon gave drinks styrofoam cups  <EOR> PT's lemon pepper actually almost unbearably salty need wipe napkin dunk cup ranch    This PT's fairly new bar itself nice yet smoky smelling  lot seating plenty screens  <EOR> The venue decent but food PT's great  wish served better quality food didn't rid all beer selections house craft stuff  house crafted beer doesn't taste bad but drinking Blue Moon!  There lots screens stay top games few video poker keno blackjack machines but only specific ones blackjack machines which favorite  <EOR> This PT's now officially closest bar home which awesome!   The happy hour great drinks 16oz beer $2 00  However happy hour food limited half priced pizza    I ordered bikini wrap sweet potato fries delightfully surprised  wrap huge heaping amount tender chicken  boyfriend ordered chicken tenders left lot desired    I love space Edison bulb lighting amount televisions but think wall art half naked woman overkill tacky   Overall happy location  rating 3 Star because think PT's mediocre best general regardless specific location  <EOR> I excited new bar close home  But service terrible! waitress passed multiple times never took order can't speak food quality because left 20 mins passed  Overall service changes aka better trained employees come back  <EOR> Just spent 25 minutes sitting table kitchen 15 feet bar clear eyesore all worked there  25 minutes acknowledgement  Although when bartender walked kitchen saw more people seated response shit ! sitting pass no less 7 times never word  Never water menu second ! never support another PT's second time month location where subjected worst customer service experiences  yes guy half hour being ignored your pathetic staff lost business way sure word mouth keeps people spending money your place! <EOR> My wife come every week great food drinks bartenders Ashley Claudia   The food great delivered awesome Terri! The service wonderful   They always greet when enter door usually remembering name   When come Sundays even when football team loses day made Ashley Claudia best bartending team Vegas    Thank continue customers  <EOR> Not only breakfast amazing but server Tracie equally good! Great venue great vibe great experience! <EOR> Overall nice property great TVs watching games but definitely gamers bar  stick shucks lodge future  <EOR> Friendly staff  Food okay    Ordered hot wings chose lemon pepper mild flavor  Salty wings  Lemon pepper worse had  Couldn't even taste lemon pepper  more salt  asked crispy under cooked   Pizza okay  beers good but truly beer drinker    Local franchise new bar neighborhood  Second time since opened  Ambiance boring very bright  When town Maybe come back if Distill crowded  <EOR> This review solely happy hour menu  Visited PT's during midnight happy hour say SRIRACHA CHICKEN BITES heaven sent! Perfect little chicken balls just right amount sriracha breading  Order ask sweet chili sauce recommended bartender side full pint blue moon your night made    Flat bread pizza good taste but I'd prefer little thinner crunchier but  just me  Loaded potato skins pretty good too  Haven't tried other ones menu though    Oh did say SRIRACHA CHICKEN BITES?! type dish definitely crave every often  Okay gonna some now! <EOR> First things first happy there's PT's  now   starting feel we're really part Vegas!   Just first time tonight   Friendly staff good atmosphere really clean brightly lit  Felt good there   Some PT's all dim smokey gross but definitely wasn't  HUGE plus me     That being said PT's  bar some food   already read some reviews bashing food selection which probably attributes low rating place far    Look bar   Sports alcohol   If you're expecting lobster your fault theirs   PT's burgers fries onion rings pizzas more likely best wings town!  Don't believe me?  Try gold fever boneless wings see if lying     This place great  just home 20 minutes ago debating going back right now another order wings     but why $13?! <EOR> Bartender semi attentive considering dead  Played $60 zero comp drinks  Eh  Convenient location but why come when Distill down road? Disappointed Bc close <EOR> I come every Sunday watch foot ball some beers  awesome bar can't help here  Ashley Claudia best ! favorite spots Las Vegas <EOR> This PT is   bar food sports setup local feel all it   If you're stuffy type isn't bar you   Honestly just save everyone hassle elsewhere   If want hang your neighbors good time without expecting high end cuisine good spot  <EOR> I love place  classy fun  Lots great beer choices especially because PBR!! Food great  wings great only thing can't pick if want flats drumsticks  big deal  Bartenders bit less friendly but maybe simply first perspective  Only reason why place doesn't 5 stars because but expensive  definitely back again  <EOR> Amazing location great atmosphere  happy hour every day 5 7 midnight 2 then half off breakfast 6 10 daily  Something fit everyone's lifestyle right neighborhood  Welcoming friendly staff just love neighborhood bar sets itself apart rest  <EOR> Wonderful friendly staff!
