Fresh pizza all time  Nice flavor reasonable price size   They should just work little customer service then love it  <EOR> This place amazing   subway restaurant pizza   down line your pie made 5 minutes later arrives your table fresh brick style oven   pass place way monorail twice day week every time smelled great   Probably 3 4 times during stay    Highly recommend doing pierise which adds second half dough ball thick crust   Great toppings selection 5 different cheeses available sausage especially good  <EOR> When walked via Underground MGM first time pleasantly surprised find Pieology  Vegan pizzas made to order days! even better attention service employees especially Adrianna Gina   Adrianna made probably three pies throughout stay all while flashing huge smile exchanging pleasantries each every time on totally separate days total glutton! Although entirely required she made sure only pizza on point but felt welcome each every time ordered   And Gina ever present assisting behind line but also keeping dining area clean comfortable  When snafu order she made sure felt taken care consideration ultimately made confident returning Pieology over over over   On next trip Vegas coming back Pieology whether staying MGM not! Hopefully sooner later hopefully Adrianna Gina working! <EOR> Great pizza option Strip!  Especially build your own option  for both pizza salad!  Great idea!!!  Tasty pizza casual place chill environment   will visit next time we're town sure! <EOR> The pizza good but service better!
