Must try price $ great value! <EOR> My sister decided try course today since $10 somewhat beginners  started off great! Then golfer tee unfortunately during tee she lost multiple balls  golfing tee sister picked looked ball wasn't it green fairway   verbally attacked men called vulgar names picking ball green  being called approached 2 men hitting ball green called manager  very agressive even point attempted hit golf ball  Due them being regulars felt untouchable  Which proved accurate    manager speaking men angrily rushed before did said  them weren't even drinking    he heard men tellinng girls meet them parking lot    I'm all cheap beautiful course  am ok being called vulgar names being threatened regulars pay $10!!!  Although cheap great deal worth if your REGULAR   Even telling them men waiting parking lot nothing done  <EOR> Played first time friend  Pretty much par3 course  First thoughts eh looks nice course   reality was  nice course only complain greens  kinda long pretty bumpy  bad course beginner  Good place practice your short game  <EOR> I play much essentially home course  Amazing value great condition more often not  <EOR>
