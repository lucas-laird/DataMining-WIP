hard find decent clean fresh salad! turkey salad! ton fresh lettuce two people share it  sandwich best Burnout  rarely eat red meat treat me  boyfriend originally tried convinced wonderful  Love dressing cole slaw it   Its much sit down type place order pick would your best bet  needs dinning room when good food anyways  staff nice seem remember even thought only twice  Its better many sandwich  shops to! <EOR> Sandwich great sufficiently filled craving however would agree previous reviewer bread philly cheese steak sandwich substantial enough stand fillings fairly mushed  would give 4 even 5 star rating if bread several more things really turn off  ton handwritten signs every available surface inside establishment pictures people filled meal stamp cards which could imagine LOT people LOT picture frames   actual official menu back wall marker where they've crossed prices items written new ones  did see any fountain machine any options fountain drinks just fridge drinks it   I know means shallow judge book its cover rather its content but case judge overall experience  While service good food great cluttered  sloppy interior lack fountain drinks just beats out  didn't see napkins anywhere either?? can't see myself returning place unless absolutely incredible craving philly cheese steak again then case wouldn't stay  Something marker writing directly menu being surrounded clutter just very uncomfortable eating  just never seen anyone operate that  <EOR>
