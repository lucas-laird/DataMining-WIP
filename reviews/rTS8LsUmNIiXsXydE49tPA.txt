No Shirt ? No Problem ! Telle est la devise à Margaritaville !  La ville de la margarita ? Quasiment et si c'était vraiment une ville serait prêt à y habiter pour boire tous les soirs une bonne margarita et se goinfrer d'un volcan de nachos !!! Oui se goinfrer vraiment il n'y pas d'autre mot car voir arriver cette montagne de nachos fait presque peur mais en se mettant à trois dessus et en ne mangeant que ça finalement réussi à en venir à bout ! bon j'était un peu tout seul dessus à la fin mais je partage la victoire ! En moyenne les cocktails sont dans les 10$ et les margaritas les valent largement elles sont bien dosées et il y des propositions assez intéressantes ! Le nachos volcano quand à lui est à 15$ donc pour 3 personnes c'est tout à fait acceptable vous repartez repus et fiers d'avoir terminé ce plat que certains mangent seul e s    question entrainement peut être     Seul petit bémol c'est très bruyant et assez sombre dans la partie bar est bien mieux dans la partie restaurant sur la terrasse avec vue sur le Strip mais là par contre allez savoir pourquoi    les verres sont en plastique !  Attendez vous à attendre un peu selon l'heure pour avoir une table mais ça vaut le coup de tenter l'expérience ! <EOR> We find table guy light blue shirt bar section extremely rude  Walked right acted he didn't hear then all people bar saw he brushed off walked away  Let everyone know this  home take vacation day  Poor service  back take pic guy light  Light shirt beard  <EOR> This place joke! Margaritas BLAH! No alcohol them  Chips Salsa BLAH! complained waitress she just blew off  didn't even order meal   we just left  never again  waste money! <EOR> I love margaritaville! Everytime come Vegas always need stop here  never actually sat down meal but bar entrance amazing! Today experience more exceptional usual  bartender named Jon if ever come find bar he's super friendly knows all Vegas hot spots super fun experience! highly recommend place anyone  great skinny margaritas awesome drink called habana banana I think thats called! <EOR> it took waitress 10mins come take drink orders another 10 mins them  Once she put drinks down she left wait til she came back orders  caribbean jerk chicken   not impressed! Way much sauce salty  carrots celery came better  <EOR> Good food good entertainment   Food good plentiful   Where Key West Margaritaville lacks flare place it  <EOR> Had great dinner first night Vegas 03 14 14   wait but only because top outside area reserved private party if sure would seated right away  Place packed but waited longer seated food  Fast good service  Drinks burgers delicious!! Ate again right before kitchen closing time next day closes 1 a m  menu options limited time but still great food  awesome band playing people dancing just great atmosphere  <EOR> What place!

Excellent service waitress Cyndra! She very friendly helpful when ordering  ordered fish n chips! best fish n chip ever had! jalapeño tarter sauce delicious!

Margaritaville good rendezvous point start night because easy find to   Don't stay long unless being butts nutts tourists   Maybe slightly better during week? <EOR> Often times Margaritaville seems older crowd  doesn't really bother know reason because live music  Kids days just want DJs  however think younger people would LOVE it  live music fun generally band doing cover songs everyone know songs  between sets play traditional club music hip hop whatever   free which love drinks generally pretty strong  food plenty seating which also free just sit if find open table  plenty room dance doesn't seem anyone trying s*x dance floor  people Margaritaville just good time which exactly do  just want hang girls meet some funny people act fools  Margaritaville happen while still being cool enough everyone group  Don't forget couple bars well  getting drink easy decor fun very nautical  <EOR> This place good  They good fried shrimp French fries   They amazing balloons your head   Longest wait ever <EOR> Pretty good food but prices very high  margaritas very strong which nice since moderately priced  server really busy took while checks leave  show every hour which things pretty crazy while trying enjoy dinner  <EOR> We came breakfast food pretty good  wasn't busy but only 1 server side which caused bit wait  waffles really good gravy chicken just right amount  steak lil tuff it may knife but flavor good  <EOR> I used come regularly  rating see changed  last two times came complete disasters  time isn't really fault but tells type people may encounter though would probably encounter them anywhere   Anyhow let back story  laid back place live band dance to  put sweater speaker which done many times before could dance without extra bulk  long story short sweater stolen  actually approached girl argued ran off it  kidding that  admit wasn't quick enough because shock definitely did expect all  workers course could help  Anyhow sounds petty but sweater ridiculous even happened  actually didn't come couple months because still annoyed that   Anyhow finally did decide another visit    Ok onto actual place food drinks music  All terrible last time here  fact brought some family friends completely embarrassed bad was  new band terrible  The old band used play same songs but least did good job   took while figure new band playing which ended being Yeah Ludacris   pretty distinct song bad couldn't even tell playing! Well since finally found table figured we'd hang even terrible music  everyone ordered drinks  ordered usual margarita rocks  Wow also terrible  Seriously possible everything change much couple months? fact became somewhat game everyone tried everyone else' drink see whose worst  think mine won  Actually can't even comment food because think gave drinks  I used always want nachos but afraid try time    So definitely recommend place come back and haven't since last experiences   <EOR> I hate place  hate because could checking different restaurant but am always coming back those freaking nachos! Ok next time try skip Margaritaville but won't any promises! <EOR> We met uncle late unch Margaritaville   cute touristy!  pomegranate margaritas rocks  tasted pretty good but glasses served just plain drinking glasses   impressive price   We land shark battered cod fries coleslaw   cod AMAZING!!!!!!  Although bit pricey huge helping fish  good!!!!!  fries very good coleslaw cilantro lime which sounded interesting but just tasted weird All all worth occasional visit  <EOR> We decided some food margaritas trip Vegas  Hands down best margarita life     watermelon margarita  servers weren't friendliest nachos just okay but I'd come back again drinks! Prices expensive but  Vegas ya  <EOR> Volcano Nachos!!!! best nachos anywhere hands down  HUGE! chicken tortilla soup really good well  Great selection alcoholic drinks fun atmosphere always good time  <EOR> My boyfriend wandered into Margaritaville checking Flamingo   time kill before flight I'd read good things nachos   seated right away server cool changing tables closer soccer match TVs   ordered nachos fajitas   server warned big nachos steered away ordering anything else   We're very grateful he did because no way could eaten any more massive pile nachos recieved!  gave them honest try even though pretty hungry only through half plate   weren't best nachos I'd ever but tasty covered jalapeños reasonable priced around $15 which isn't bad Vegas    If order them plan split them 2 4 people order side salsa  it   Also margaritas tasty should be  <EOR> Ok  Great service  Still call Bar Food  all seating good entertainment  Try something else    <EOR> This definitely place novelty   My friend shared plate Chicken Pasta  portions big enough share  won't feel super stuffed when try squeeze into your dresses evening! Hehe  pasta pretty good also substitute chicken shrimp too   Of course can't Margaritaville without trying margaritas! few friends ordered Tropical Fruit Margaritas Mango Guava   They're sweeter side but pretty yummy! Although you'd probably drink couple more decent buzz haha   This restaurant sort tiki Hawaiian sort atmosphere  between meal staff put little musical number    complete dancer sliding into pool or giant cup water! Even though little cheesy eating entertaining! <EOR> Ah Jimmy Buffett   sort your parents' Sammy Hagar  This place runs expensive took long time served due seemingly failing host staff direction came later held left behind credit card kindly when returned realized host dwells different location enter in   Looking really cheap meal volcano nachos which just such excessive amount food probably fit 5 people sure bring least 3 people prices won't sense  You're supposed drinks but items seemed pricey skipped drinks  Am missing something Jimmy Buffett dynasty menu expensive? guess you're supposed buy drinks eat quantity food huh?  Inside non stop video footage fun times man himself namesake island Florida   all around good place hang if kind thing nostalgic really kind thing but won't knock that  guess if anything Jimmy Buffett reminds sing alongs grade school way your parents envisioned good life   any rate nachos filling mission accomplished  <EOR> Boy REALLY wanted place    But shitty experience!   We seated quickly which expected because late Sunday night only 3 us  know Vegas but wasn't poppin' anything  seated window which normally would fine but AC full blast directly us  nice 2 minutes then all freezing   We waited 10 minutes before seeing waiter which shouldn't happened seeing slow and understaffed   ordered waters said we'd need just another minute menus  5 minutes later waiter brought waters  time asked move table under AC  He pointed table said once clean could move over he walked away  few minutes later moved ourselves over    It took 15 minutes before new waiter stopped by  Again okay  ordered dinner appetizer  appetizer came promptly told food would take 30 minutes because ordered steak cooked well which understandable   Finally food over 45 MINUTES later  take first bite mashed potatoes just lost appetite     FOUND HAIR  Gross    At point mom pissed  She asked see manager  He came over very kind wish would gotten name   He apologized multiple times said he'd kitchen rush new making sure  I'd happen   20 minutes later new steak sides  Funny came twice fast time     I super disappointed though  steak good  know Margaritaville isn't steakhouse but $26 99 you'd think could cook decent New York Strip    The ONLY redeeming factor place manager  He even took dish off bill    Definitely don't recommend going won't back! Bummer! <EOR> 1st time here  Service slow very friendly  shrimp linguine shrimp good pasta under cooked sauce watery bland  He Asian shrimp salad very good  Kinda those tried done! very appetizing return  <EOR> Huge disappointment   going Margaritaville since opened taking friends amazing mountain nachos  Parrot Heads Beware 9 PM extremely loud obnoxious bam bam bam dance music starts no more conversation  Taking some lawyer friends drinks conversation over when music started   couldn't hear server yelling across table communicate   Nothing terrific bands past  If management thinks putting obnoxious music increase business need look client demographic   back long continue ruin Jimmy Buffett atmosphere   view horrible business decision   Dozens guest around all upset volume music choice once clearly themed venue  <EOR> Margarita weak!  Hey Margaritaville!!!  Yay me!  My husband started sharing crab mushroom dip bread   cheesy good bread!  Yum!  Then decided share Volcano nachos!  both eaters but could finish it!  Glad shared!

If someone knew wouldn't cared much   The next thing happened ordering second round drinks asked beer didn't specify kind beer wanted server brought landshark 20oz cup wanted landshark but didn't know multiple sizes server assumed wanted large size extra $3 charge    If being charged $10 drink would gotten another specialty drink instead beer overpriced landshark  When confronted server he super defensive saying just wanted beer few friends ordered beers which fine but if made mistake least own argue wasn't specific wanted  menu only price expecting price size beer   His only saving grace showing another bathroom when main bathrooms closed    TL DR version Bad server never going back unless people know working  Expect attitude servers assumptions charge extra  If wasn't party would walked because bad experience was  Food average expensive <EOR> The fancy bottle flipping bartender running outside bar charged $12 2 beers?

[the minions cheer] Gru    the small Las Vegas! [the cheers stop] Gru won't even mention Eiffel Tower    also Vegas  Porter Margaritaville   ! [no minions no cheering] Porter    the restaurants Las Vegas!  Don't wrong Margaritaville fine place but extremely touristy   And didn't see fluffy unicorns gift shop either   Maybe could sell unicorns Jimmy Buffet quotes like     Why don't drunk     Searching lost shaker salt   don't know where gonna go  long pause LIGHT BULB! But digress great day folks  <EOR> Parking Park casino parking lot Notable Food NACHOS Margaritas Tip virgins margaritas if early alcohol  cheaper    Good Margarita varieties good atmosphere in  drinks small much paying them  Lots people just sitting around having good time  Lizards drink definitely flavorful taste alcohol   Get nachos split your friends  huge packed toppings  Food general pricey but hey Vegas expect  split nachos definitely cheapens your bill     Will come back late night snacks  <EOR> Let's just way right now nachos rock pretty much main reason continue back  order them once per Vegas trip   I came group almost 15 people  CALLED day before see if could some kind reservation told needed talk group sales but weren't going back until next day could leave message  left message basically just saying expecting group 15 25 people 6pm next night could reserve table if wasn't  table large enough least section tables near eachother? call back next day day planning GOING 10AM saying No reserve anything just walk whenever Okay but can't even hold section tables such large group? Apparently not   We before 6 explain situation  tell best table 10 30 mins some tables 5 aren't near each other  Neither worked  decided try back bar which totally EMPTY 20 stools took over    We started ordering giant margaritas spouts volcano nachos etc  People started showing late ordering various other things  couple hours later main guy supplying told he getting off could cash now   even though weren't done  told guessed could but rather irritated this  also added gratutity which weird since he wa just bartender but whatever fine  He didn't bother ever ask bring bill situation  clear ton people but he just kept adding things onto bill end $400 bill try break between 20 different people  Great  guess must eventually figured because didn't chase down strip screaming STEALERS!!  End points great customer service large groups huge margaritas really bad time    not enough tequila mix strong burned throat nachos delicious and always be still always b c such fun cool place nachos amazing but would attempt gather large group again  The end  <EOR> Las Vegas isn't really idea place come Margaritaville  place lacks awesome ambiance find Caribbean spots  Drinks small expensive food so so    Would all better if hadn't thrown 10% extra tax band playing  Listen mediocre band $9 beers became $10 beers magically  expect quite aware quirk before sit down else nice little surprise when receipt comes  <EOR> Good food good drinks   After all years protected hearing jet engine noise lose hearing few hours deafening noise band   132 dB peak well beyond produced turbine engines   Thanks lot  <EOR> Perfect margarita difficult finish  Atmosphere fun but way loud  Decibels 106  Ears ringing dinner  Couldn't converse party  If want drink plastic cups dance place ok  Anything else lot better  remind waiter drinks  Oh yeah moment served  Meals already out  <EOR> Chain Vegas  Food OK service quick bar  <EOR> This place tourist trap  High priced food deal when good  ordered fajitas steak chicken combo no flavor  onions peppers even cooked just little burnt sticking skillet  homemade guacamole good but tortillas tasted plastic  friend visiting town am local but don't mind going places strip if worth it  place not  music loud show dancing guys stilts making animal balloons did impress me  friend island pork wrap said ok but worth coming back for  service ok but great  <EOR> Went Friday night group friends   Good points Location Atmosphere fun people wanting party Our server great very ball Plain margarita strong felt $$ worth Food prices decent View 2nd floor strip night great!

Excellent performance staff making guests feel very welcome  blended chocolate vodka rum drink very delicious strong  fish tacos ordered really delicious well rice beans  Although $20 expecting little more fish tacos but otherwise nice flavor  come back try some other meals menu  <EOR> Waiter um exotic dancer margarita  Oh excuse me? giant 10 foot tall swirling margarita directly behind isn't consumption? Damn   I feel if Vegas brings nothing but mental physical exhaustion me  tired day arrival didn't even put whole Jimmy Buffet theme together until pirate stilts walked me   Decent 'ritas liked top shelf margarita myself food plentiful comforting   I little disoriented large Mr  Buffet occasional Jack Johnson towering above television screens but chick hook dropped down into Megarita behind really caught surprise   The men happy location choice but could see other females around impressed bleach blond bikini fish hook almost twirling way into burger buns  I'd probably come drunk fast but really kind joint unless surrounded equally drunk silly group people  definitely Vegas very chill encourages keep drinking  <EOR> In three visits Margaritaville never disappointed  such party atmosphere lots friendly people wait staff outstanding  eaten third floor patio inside building just doesn't matter  All fantastic    Due unfortunate series events last night morning am drinking iced tea  But great tea! Thankfully picked time small crowd limited noise    Not feeling terribly sophisticated morning decided should split Southwest chicken salad grilled chicken strips  salad world flavour  Plenty sweet corn black beans fresh avocado  Maybe but even greens seem fresher today  would really dressing recipe sweet yet overpowering   The chicken strips lightly breaded almost fish batter taste  favourite part light tender fish inside  crunchy soggy soft   We asked all three sauces fabulous  barbecue sauce tasted littttttle bit alcohol it  did not  honey mustard very good well ranch    Paul L  server he did fantastic job  He friendly hell he kept glasses filled know love that  <EOR> After visiting Vegas many years finally time check place  family  Upon arrival greeted friendly smile where told sit selfs any where we'd like  Once sat selfs waited 10min!!! anyone acknowledge their  attention many servers asked menu 5 min asking she brought menu  never saw again bad service weak attention customer service very poor no floor manager presence there's no sense leadership  <EOR> Wasted away   in Margaritaville   searchin' good time all found drunk folk!  Some people claim Sin City blame but know   it all Jimmy Buffett's fault!  TOURIST   TRAP   middle desert   Mr  Buffett no shame!  But lack shame and act being high lazy most time made very rich man   You're rich B!+ch!  Your tropical concoction so called restaurant called Margaritaville definitely blame   Kenny Chesney doing duet anytime soon?  sure rock big rimmed cowboy hat tight tank top Bermuda shorts some sandals ukulele   want some moolah pandering your beloved 'Parrot Heads'   Seriously Margaritaville tropics gone loco!  Nathan Drake Uncharted fame crash landed deserted island run by   um   Jimmy Buffett   Damn couldn't find better metaphor!  place mish mash tropical kitsch all rolled into one!  akin being Jimmy's LSD induced hallucinations   Although thinking might goal   Margaritaville probably place want if love island living I'm Maui but geez stretching it think all island dwellers wear brightly colored Aloha shirts all times day most actually run around shirtless spears use ti leaves cloth diapers no sense time actually most Filipinos don't sense time    Also if love song 'Margaritaville' probably love hanging Margaritaville   swear hour eating dinner heard song play LEAST 5 times!  Insane!  yes each time bikini clad woman sliding down gigantic margarita glass shaped slide into pool below   Drunk frisky men awe I might little bit awe well but respect bikini clad woman   a real gentleman gives credit where credit due    Margaritaville quite experience   Upon being greeted host stand showed another host stand downstairs   Now where night started   normal greeted African American teen sure   But being greeted African American teen Yo dawg doin'?  Four?  Right way  while dressed khaki shorts bright turquoise Aloha shirt parrots sporting bit gangsta lean?  Kinda hilarious   bit being shown your table members Wu Tang Clan   middle tropics   But hey am judge?  kid's gotta eat   However literally sat right middle entire restaurant!  felt each table around 10 feet away   Luckily server nice but tad unattentive side mainly because   we seated 10 feet away everyone else   she mini trek table     The kids amused Margaritaville all 10 minutes   Ooh airplane!  Ahh slide!  Ooo palm trees!  eh   Then all questions  Why noisy here?  come those people laughing loud?  Why playing song AGAIN?  lots salt shakers here   did lose it? don't know kids don't know   back drinking your margaritas     The food Margaritaville interesting concept but think execution comes MEH   Really average side   came mainly because kids wanted share round Margaritaville's famous Volcano Nachos   $16 behemoth really did resemble small volcano!  Ginormous!  Easily could feed 5 people mound tortilla chips topped chili cheese guacamole sour cream jalapenos tomatoes green onions   But honestly anyone nachos   tasted okay but best nachos ever had   Chili kinda tasted store bought   Biggest peeve?  hate when many nacho chips but enough cheese!  volcano nacho pile hardly any cheese when hit middle!  If wanted plain chips would asked plain chips   guy McDonald's your soft serve cone swirl big pocket air middle   Bastard!    Rest food there?  Overpriced!  Come $13 cheeseburger?  $20 coconut shrimp?  expensive live paradise!  much different fare your local chain restaurant   But drinks look tasty   Besides Volcano Nachos ended just ordering two cheeseburgers off kids menu   Nothing special   Margaritaville open daily 365 days year breakfast lunch dinner   Just way would figure crazy island tropics   your island fever fix just any time day   Just don't forget your sunglasses your SPF 5000   still Vegas all! <EOR> Spent lot time last trip Vegas good times!!  They really good Pina Coladas     however expensive but they're worth it!  Gotta love place more bar dance floor restaurant store    much going on!   The live band good played wide variety music   weren't many people gettin down dance floor though but once drinks rolling good time!    They weird lil game right before walk into store metal ring cord    can't work save life      The store much cute stuff found necessary blow some money = Saw guy passed adirondack chairs hallway    take note sit really low adirondack chair if wearing skirt dress    bad idea!   Funniest thing hate tequila friends but great time anyway!  Definitely check out! <EOR> Came recommendation friend whom advised Volcano Nachos totally rating  place specifically that  service okay sure some good items menu needless say didn't bother menu told waiter bring 'volcano nachos' worst best tasting but unfortunately plenty uncheesy chips left over since didn't bother menu didn't see cost until bill arrived $17 99! Okay definitely satisfied even if cost half amount  only nachos mediocre but way over priced even if give large quantity  <EOR> Sitting staring hostess waiting 35 minutes seated made reservation Open Table which honoring  ever happened the customer always right? probably wondering why just don't leave?

Price high but food margaritas amazing! <EOR> Jared server friendly knowledgeable but food bland hell  Margaritaville before food much better other cities  food no taste  think cooks need reevaluate seasoning level  Other wise service good <EOR> Margaritaville seemed perfect choice listening country music 3 hours while beginning Vegas your partner crime Tennessee  love country music but Margaritaville bit outdated  Decor didn't seem all realistic Volcano wasn't very impressive    Food wise nothing stood out  Burgers quesadillas famous mountainous nachos  nachos definitely hefty give but then again might want remember downing pepto bismol  wide range margarita flavors even huge souvenir glass which only gather dust sitting already cluttered shelf home around $35! Yes comes alcohol but just sounds insane me  Maybe still warming Vegas prices but prefer getting margaritas Fat Tuesday where 48oz Everlear concoction fraction price  More bang your buck sure    I only stand much watching Jimmy Buffet concert beach unfortunately no go me  defense hear lot more lively night performers restaurant  Otherwise please skip! way many better restaurants Vegas!

Score! <EOR> Always good time!  Since last April seems maybe menu changed because didn't previously notice many vegetarian options   time around several veg friendly options even marked menu which items could made vegetarian   Kudos that   However chicken salad minus chicken charged same price    huge issue but surely chicken would more costly lettuce sugared pecans mango?  any case food always good love nautical ambiance   Service par Monday evening visited no wait table   outdoor dining space excellent well fun view strip   only issue Margaritaville always freezing cold!  almost always prefer eat outside when possible since won't shivering throughout meal! <EOR> Come every time Vegas  spent Halloween New Year's Eve well  Always great time  Servers great food good music fantastic  kinda place  <EOR> Gets three stars theme fact volcano show Vegas well over top seen other locations  food pretty consistent location location  nachos huge starter fish tacos good enough happy  really enjoyed Blueberry Pomegranate Margarita!  On down side twilight zone check desk  friendly all  Also Flamingo itself where Margaritaville Casino Restaurant housed needs good implosion remodel when compare nearly everything else immediate area  <EOR> There two reasons why love margaritaville two only    The first reason Redbull margaritas  ultimate cure hangover maintain drunkness  Fuck yes  If sit long enough drink enough them suddenly you'll find yourself running down Las Vegas Boulevard full speed against traffic your shirt off remember damn thing  Good times   Second reason rare burgers  know fucking completely tired places cooking burgers all way through if specifically ask rare  assume risk might ecoli mad cow when eat rare meat  Needless say stoked margaritaville oblige give fucking rare burger    That's it  Just follow lead it  <EOR> Service good waitress very pleasant made sure everything needed  crab artichoke dip which amazing seafood Mac cheese which awesome well  portions very big could finish Mac cheese which good because leftovers!

Went Cinco de Mayo because margaritas able score seat upper deck which thought nice until told couldn't put umbrellas due wind baked unrelenting Vegas sun   Ordered overpriced margaritas tiny plastic cups filled ice well shrimp appetizer came exactly 5 1 2 shrimp   For entrée ordered shrimp trio which Red Lobster quality twice price $25    did spicy sauce coconut shrimp though     Service waitress nice but line stand if want table upstairs only marked lady seating people wouldn't tell people where people would come upstairs then stand front line front people waiting 20 minutes   comical watch   I'm target demographic joint take review shaker salt   equate Jimmy Buffet Ethan Hawke character film Reality Bites regard each disdain may color opinion  <EOR> Definitely touristy lots families wait seems pretty much forever or 45 minutes whichever comes first   yet ambiance great staff friendly food surprisingly good isn't very expensive  Gotta Margies course would recommend Jimmy's Jammin Jambalaya   Plastic accepted course  Music would better if actually *finished* Buffet's songs  <EOR> Well last week Vegas bucket list contained simple yet somehow elusive task going JB's Margaritaville having margarita I love margaritas share   half way cross off but really    After long night dying  Ya know Vegas did you well kind dying  But whatever power through  party 6 determined M ville did  Wednesday afternoon walked over Cosmo strolled into sewer smelling hell known Flamingo casino  seated right away seen right away    TIPPITY TIP TIP Request Ryan L  your waiter! Seriously guy only reason am giving ANY stars the food HORRIBLE into little later   Management if read please recognize Ryan  He nothing short fantastic! He would probably remember table probably only entertainment day   Everyone table going margarita except cringed thought he recommended time all specialty margaritas would same price Tower Margaritas tap operated 5 foot tall tube loaded ice traditional margarita would serve everyone 2 margaritas   of course friends opted that  only but he brought few flavors when two friends didn't taste regular margarita    For food all know needed food  Something  only redemption fact corn soup ordered brought right away  dish just didn't taste great but still knew needed eat it  did    However when all main dishes came just ordered boneless buffalo wings  hard this? Really? came them frozen but then kitchen them being cooked microwave entire duration since when Jimmy Buffet born  never more dry tasteless disgusting chicken entire life  could barely chew it  mention room temperature  ate maybe 2 3 12 let rest sit there  Absolutely pathetic  rest party ended nachos  massive heap tortilla chips room temperature toppings tasted old  Shame Margaritaville    And enter Ryan rescue kind of   didn't want complain  places go  but he craftily split everything table checks before even asked he split massive margarita into 6 nachos into 3 last minute pitcher margz into 2 another entree into 2 3  easy    As miserable felt felt somewhat better towards end thank soup water   forced myself least two drinks margarita  Unfortunately once again impressed  Sigh    Bottom Line Three stars service  Negative 1 food  Gross  <EOR> The decor fun airplane hangs ceiling think sharks too   seated area dark could barely see person across you   food okay carne asada taco carnitas taco  good but pretty basic   Nothing much them   drinks okay too   mango margarita which fine but again nothing much it  prices fair expensive   overall okay place  <EOR> Margs Strip!!
