Queen Bee latte sweetened honey topped cinnamon tastes amazingggg  friend jovi iced mocha latte which simple made perfection  tasted amazing well! Now moving food menu found back paper menu rather board  More extensive coffee menu offering few vegan choices well for those your interested   yet try vegan option menu maybe next visit    I've visited Neighbors twice jovi during grand opening ordered mushroom burger first visit salmon toast second visit  presentation food definitely fit modern millennial style cafe even most employees fit into type style if sense   bite mushroom burger OH GOODNESS  made beef patty topped onions bun some kind aioli sauce if remember correctly  Jovi ordered avocado toast declined offer try bite since mouth busy burger but she could over good either!

  One thing didn't know grab your own waters utensils napkins accompaniments sauces next order area  Didn't find until food asked waiter delivered    The 'Steak Eggs' 8 oz ribeye topped chimichurri sauce smashed potatoes farm eggs toast    Mildly splurged little due rare occassion  course steak medium rare over easy eggs  Toast? Sourdough ! Steak pre sliced stacked w layed chimichurri sauce  perfect cook but still tender juicy  Chimichurri sauce favorite sauces steak if any sauce used overall  smashed potatoes surprisingly yummy  Small boiled potatoes w skin cooked again skillet all guess pressed break skin create some crispy fried aspects edges  something wanting try pretty yummy ! Eggs perfectly cooked  Sourdough bread amazing ! better sourdough breads had  Crispy but hard exterior soft chewy interior  Great top mop some chimichurri sauce w rich runny egg yolk  The 'Old School consists 2 farm eggs any style choice double smoked bacon sausage smashed potatoes toast  Over medium eggs w choice half smoked bacon half sausage sourdough bread !  She said bacon bit overcooked hard eat  sausage really yummy  Reminds style breakfast sausage  Very juicy flavorful   We both thoroughly enjoyed bread highly recommended anyone tries place out  plating food amazing IG worthy hehe portion size price good  another reviewer said cali style vegas prices ! Heck ya !   Oh ! forgot mention drinks  OJ nice yummy  Drank having cappuccino made taste sweeter should be  Nice amount pulp ! Cappuccino pretty decent nice heart design foam  Fairly strong but tasty  Size wise cappuccino mildly smaller side though  OJ pretty good size    I wanted order coconut pancakes but being two people small stomachs first meal day yeah definitely wouldn't work  Next time maybe?   Friend mentioned people complaining overall noise restaurant  feel its fairly normal  Open kitchen  Open dining room  expect? library? <EOR> We visiting Vegas wanted breakfast somewhere off strip wasn't touristy    This place really trendy hip vibe  Entirely different everything else seen Vegas which hoping find!

The eggs fluffy bacon perfectly cooked arugula gives perfect crunch  sauce gives just little kick just right flavor  great! I also ordered queen b coffee  try it! <EOR> went yesterday capp avo toast side smoked salmon $19  took 15 minutes good  everything experience pretty good but disappointed become standard especially considering almost perfect rating   the concept order counter bring you  asked woman register good since first time  she recommended dish only description offered gluten free vegan which stated menu  ordered paid she flips screen around choose gratuity sign  four options 25% 20% 18% other  no way blame employees trying tips especially when establishments pay employees little possible  but counter service  live world where 15% standard 20% good service    the food comes wrong order  much instead side smoked salmon brought whole salmon toast dish perhaps explaining why took 15 minutes minimal order   said didn't order dish just small side asked if charged dish side  he apologized took dish back said he'd find out  5 minutes later he brought back side salmon  he didn't say anything else portion slice smoked salmon nicely  presented kind wrapped around itself if guess 1 5 oz  guess threw rest dish employee ate it    i started look around saw few dirty tables two guests done awhile dirty plates front them LOT employees maybe 12 guests seated total   then watched some employees gathered expo line enjoying themselves appeared manager since he dressed regular clothes standing entire time    like said everything good overall place fine  but those prices and expectations significant gratuity     standard think great? hospitality 20 years server manager working gratuity supporting servers much gratuity possible  newly opened restaurant its employees i am assuming manager maybe 3 4 opportunities better chose take advantage any them which probably harder swallow paying $19 a somewhat forced tip 15% capp avo toast 1 5 oz smoked salmon  everyone else thought 5 stars  ? <EOR> Nothing but great things say  Such cute new neighborhood spot! Loved decor  Almond milk latte brekky sandwich both excellent  back! <EOR> I met girlfriend breakfast  menu interesting but found portion sizes small unsatisfying  Also food okay nothing rave about  Probably won't return  <EOR> Steak eggs good come back two days later round 2! restaurant itself very cute clean  very modern contemporary feel  Love overall atmosphere  advised wait may lot longer weekends  Today Sunday wait line while order also wait even longer food come but overall another delicious satisfying experience  can't wait come back try more menu! <EOR> Amazing first impression!

Edit Breakfast sandwich super good    Coconut pancakes different expected but bad  Love coconut flakes  <EOR> Such great new addition neighborhood! Bright cheery place very pleasant staff super tasty food  Great place all around  Flavorful chicken BLT sandwich iced matcha latte side  <EOR> Neighbors great decor  struck walking in  lots natural light solid wood  nice balance terms occupancy capacity too   The match latte quite nice slightly sweet but cloying balancing well slight earthiness matcha   The steak eggs solid though wouldn't say spectacular hence four stars five   steak itself ok just particularly memorable  accompanying eggs smashes potatoes nicely done though   Overall nice breakfast lunch spot would definitely back again  <EOR> Stumbled upon place while car getting serviced am glad did  food drinks service all incredible  menu may short but options amazing and mostly vegetarian vegan friendly! lavender latte coconut pancakes  trying positive back again!
