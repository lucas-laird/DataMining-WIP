Take cue Costco better cheap eats   The newly renovated Del Taco pretty clean wellas bright inviting new color scheme   menus changed bit some new items added   Guess change good sometimes   big change now each table baskets already condiments arranged nicely them mild hot habanero sauces ketchup    guess goal seem you're more home meal     But quality food for cheapness is sure beats other taco place *cough* Taco Bell *cough* least opinion   food Del Taco tastes much fresher settles better tummy   dunno other taco place those damn Doritos Locos Tacos always leave feeling gassy light headed   Perhaps artificial ingredients shell??  The Classic Taco Del Taco favorites   crunchy shell filled seasoned beef fresh shredded cheddar cheese lettuce tomato?  only $1 each?  Yeah 5   wrapping yellow paper?  Ooh   almost authentic Mexican!  When tacos fresh greatness   eat cheap happy man   also plain old Bean Cheese Burrito red sauce    When beans fresh batch made store pretty good eats   Another favorite?  $1 Chicken Soft Taco   eat dozen easy   But say critically   only when freshly made   don't want mine made old flour tortillas old grilled chicken   Nope   Gotta fresh made!  If you're nice buying several Chicken Soft Tacos your order ask them cook fresh batch chicken sometimes oblige   Trust don't ones sitting there   Del Taco   eat FRESH!

Years ago became majorly sick Del Taco  Then few months different location sick again probably worse food poisoning had  Sad say handful food poisoning experiences but because food adventurous just hazard travel    I've avoided plague years  BF avoided well because 2 times he also sick    Leave kids cook your food right    specially when dealing chicken   I saw Yelp though when comes talking fast food kept popping up  know fast food nothing great but area very few late night choices Del Taco  curious if maybe better remembered?  We decided give try again    I some del carbon tacos chicken burrito  bad all  real chunks chicken instead cafeteria style chicken minced reconstituted into chicken strip fake grill marks which plus    I can't quite say fan yet but A OK    I'll leave them positive rating though poisoning though  <EOR> Not much really say del taco  step Taco Bell but still best while inebriated lol    The two times location both times drive thru poor customer service    The food good enough mentioned lol  I'll probably eat again if craving hits way home work <EOR> I start off saying gave them two stars because employees super nice  took picture taco because even full spoonful meat  food terrible! mean fast food but really?! expect something taco  back  see why dead most time  <EOR> It's Del Taco really say? food greasy heart killing  prices ok but mostly lettuce 15c taco there  suppose when don't feel making anything really don't care your health alright  But really people hard your own tacos internet find recipe sauces yourself now  know if your only valid excuse coming here  <EOR> Oh love  steak el carbon tacos Del taco just deliciousness!!!!! <EOR>
