After striking multiple times breakfast room service starting feel if hope lost getting decent meal anywhere within confines Suncoast  just happened looking another amenity that would Men's Restrooms stumbled onto two things theaters which we'd trying locate earlier Game sports bar restaurant former TGI Fridays found later which only steps away bathrooms theaters    So when dinnertime rolled around first try Mexican but closed no explanation given schedule said both Italian Mexican places closed Tuesdays but MONDAY  No help there  walking down St  Tropez Buffet resigned whatever fate might lie store when suddenly remembered Game much further why try instead?  I am HAPPY did   First let say am beer drinker never really been   Wasn't fond would now again just sociable   But own? Gimme white wine happy camper   But recently living Cali made acquaintance lovely little IPA called Lagunitas   a beauty pale ale grapefruity sweet kind finish  Ice cold draft?

Just few classic dessert choices would nice Apple pie w ice cream  Cheesecake Fried Oreos Twinkies Root beer float  What's cool bar cozy every seat bar view TVs  Your phone reception sucks Suncoast don't expect romantic texts anyone special while you're there  <EOR> This place BEST chicken wings ever! fried perfect crisp! always order them never disappoint !

But know menu limited burgers sandwiches some appetizers just salad  service very good  <EOR> For sports bar casino could worse   prices outrageous almost dozen TV's   beer selection very craft heavy changes every often some local selections $5 $6 per beer which very fair   wouldn't way bar but if Suncoast worst place spend few hours drinking some quality beer   if bet sports book usually give drink tickets used Game  <EOR> This favorite wing spot Summerlin  Bryan best great place watch sports  <EOR> Wifey little late buffet day ended giving Game try!  The Game occupies former TGI Friday's believe more several years ago   Theme similar though lots bar food lots alcoholic drinks!  Only there's more sports theme going here   Tons TVs all around restaurant playing all types sports screen even personal monitors each table watch want!  Don't wanna watch Lebron?  Then watch Peyton   Bryce   Oh hell watch horse race too   Came some vittles though  did   place weekend?  Surprisingly bit spare patrons   omen?  kinda thought but sure didn't wanna Subway right across way   Game stayed   Service well   Hella slow   mean took nearly 10 minutes someone even come table sat ourselves down!  guess Game supposed more home town bar full service restaurant?  No clue   Finally girls dressed referee no less greeted hello gave couple menus   Some decent looking grub ended ordering Philly Cheesesteak $11 Provolone cheese red green peppers Mushroom Swiss Burger $11 We fries both orders   Took 15 minutes but food came nice warm   Verdict?  Eh really just OK   Nothing rave average food   Wasn't bad but wasn't best burger type food before   Philly many peppers while being colorful bit bland   would preferred mushrooms onions instead   Wife did Mushroom Swiss burger but patty didn't seem house made more commercial kind buy already formed bulk   Flavor somewhat lacking well   bun buttered toasted though thankfully   side note fries did come cute paper bag!  nice hot too   I think Game would better experience if place actually PACKED people possibly shouting TV   Atmosphere folks!  Just sayin'   We might back Game again give another try most likely if buffet closed again next time hahaha   But if you're staying Suncoast Game worst bet make   would save CRAPS   Always bet black   red?? <EOR> By far favorite place eat drink SunCoast! Brian best Bartender great sports conversation with! If good beer food simple menu but food great sports     GAME place be!! <EOR> The Game sports bar oasis desert smoky casino sport books seem run over days new Vegas hockey fans  bartender Brian runs squared away bar kitchen cranks consistently good yet inexpensive bar fare  Cold beer wall to wall big screens ensure isn't bad seat house  Free WiFi easy access garage parking quick stop grab burger beer The Game super easy  If someone's list high quality yet little known local area sports bar destinations should be  <EOR> Tried place because didn't want huge meal but wanted watch game  many TVs bar area if sit booths personal TV watch whatever game want  menu small mostly burgers sandwiches but food tried tasty  also decent beer selection  most impressed nachos onion rings  nachos chili cheese tomatoes onions sour cream jalapeños  If you're into spicy food would recommend no jalapeños because spicy  also sliders which delicious three them came side order crinkle fries  <EOR> Great servers Bartenders  bad cutting staff menu  Great place watch sports! <EOR> We blast watching Vegas Golden Knights Game  server Ashley top keeping all hydrated favorite beverage  Thank Jimmy Weber getting all set great viewing party  <EOR> When place opened wasn't bad now customer service sucks    bartenders great but servers much   server home end shift without saying word   NEVER BACK        Now closed Mexican restaurant NO REASON BACK SUNCOAST <EOR> This review burgers only  Best burgers town!

Overall great experience! <EOR> After seeing show Suncoast needed dinner   Game only restaurant tickled fancy a little still open   This heavy duty sports bars TVs literally wallpaper pretty noisy   But unbearably     I didn't realize pulled pork ordered actually sliders   would love sliders if didn't So  Much  Bread   rare case order them usually eat then pick filling rest   But buns terrific substantial enough hold shape turn mush most them do   actually allowed myself eat two three  You millenials you'll doing before long too!    helped pork dry meaning drowning barbecue sauce   don't much sauce anything small cup sauce served side   pork itself moist enough didn't need lot sauce   really enjoyed it   My husband ordered burger Swiss mushrooms but he substituted chicken beef   sandwich fine but alas bun slider buns but more ordinary one   held together though he satisfied   He also fries which crinkle cut frozen ones but wouldn't expected hand cut ones made fresh order   okay   Prices fairly reasonable service good   We'd back again if reason Suncoast  <EOR> We little over hour kill before watching movie decided check place since right next theaters  advertisement said 25 wide screen TVs  Sunday Night Football why not?  We sat down tables waited while  service slow very busy  servers finally took drink orders brought menus  husband decided share Chili Cheese Fries bacon which part Featured Football Items  portion bigger thought  looked pretty good first  Unfortunately fries kind dry  chili cheese tasted very bland added bacon did better any way  glad didn't spend extra $3 00 add chicken pork!  Cool place watch your football games but its bad food horrible  also think should put sign entrance saying Please seat yourself since saw group customers standing around waiting service    I miss T G I  Friday's  <EOR> Great Sports Bar Sun Coast Casino  Our waiter Brian fantastic  food step above your typical bar food  recommend Game Brian  <EOR>
