FRIED tacos shaped empanada almost   good! devoured them before thought snap pic lol  Super happy def back!! <EOR> We came try vegan option great choices  those vegan want try some vegan food would definitely recommend try place although only three book mainly because inspired anything here   Ambiance small place two tables four three two   Your basic low budget seating if busier wonder fit anyone  Located small strip mall off Durango Spring Mountain Road  place fast food feeling it    Food both vegan options meat options    Meat Carne Asada Burito  Carne Asada Tacos   would say meat burrito basically unspectacular quite boring yet edible  found nothing special taste texture  felt something could self   Same Carne Asada Taco  mean Taco y Taco some awesome meat tacos brimming juicy taste aroma much better deal   Vegan ordered Vegan Enchiladas Veggie Crunchy Potato Tacos  Well if meat unspectacular tell waiting anxiously try vegan dishes  dreaming would created care passion full zest juicy morsels vegan goodness   unceremoniously very uninteresting pile food well would even considered pile more lilliputian anything else  Definitely edible however dry wheat toast   Ambiance Donde esta?  mean no air conditioning bland tables no accoutrements really unimaginable   Service only ones 2 00 pm weekend   took seriously long time over 20 minutes food    I say vegans deserve much better choice place however try place if all other 5 star reviews others    decide  <EOR> I've coming while now even back when Pancho's  They've downsized menu since changing name owner  disappointment discover no longer offer homemade juice options but vegan food still tastes great! Hands down best vegan nachos town  highly recommend vegan nachos crunchy potato tacos cilantro lime mushroom taco burrito  can't speak carnivorous side menu because never tried nor ever try future  vegan side menu deserves 6 stars though! Since  option guess settle 5 <EOR> So wanted wait write review because food but very poorly run  say upfront food tasty delicious but running business lacks needs much work  vegan options absolutely amazing delicious but  if food items available      My 1st visit mushroom tacos crispy avocados opted zucchini poblano tacos delicious enough return  2nd visit again mushroom tacos crispy avocado again opted zucchini tacos  Delicious but now starting question ability employees running store maintaining full stocked menu   Today came lunch 12 45 they're closed  sure what's going spot  under new owner new name but see experiencing some difficulty business operation  hope they're still figuring kinks menu potential but experienced myself cant see lasting unfortunately  gluten free vegan love tacos! <EOR> Soooo Fu@$!ng GOOD!!! authentic amazing VEGAN food  actually offer vegan cheese sour cream too  does that?! Every time gone they've gracious  beautifully clean see into kitchen which always comforting they're affordable! Couldn't recommend place more!! Try Vegan potato taco plate    you're welcome  <EOR> This place amazing!  both meat vegan options freaking good!  vegan options use Follow Your Heart Cheese not Daiya which really pushes them notch book!  We 2 taco plate crispy potato refried beans which came really well seasoned Spanish rice more refried beans   Other taco options include Poblano Zuchini Lime Cilantro Mushroom Beer Battered Grilled Avocado   also Veggie Bowl rice beans vegan sour cream vegan cheese avocado pick hot sauce lettuce All delicious definitely back! <EOR> Neat little shop next house! love sell Jarritos = Also check yelp free crunchy taco here! Pretty neato  Cashier cook really helpful well  <EOR> I ordered carne asada  really dry    Beans rice awesome!! Other dishes potato taco soggy but good flavor   The service slow but man working alone  Taking orders making food customers service  He good multitasking through!  We try second time hope carne asada better! <EOR> Delicious don't judge book its cover it tucked away regular looking strip mall so may jump you Las Vegas Mexican strip mall joints every corner   but REALY destination location   For vegans dream come true  this authentic Mexican food forget Zara's  Chipotle all time  No more asking if vegan they dedicated vegan menu cook separate grill away non vegan items  Non vegans fear   they regular options also Try something different   This delicious food   my spot lunch especially  It's full dining experience full service waitress music ambience bar serving margaritas etc  I believe don't even serve alcohol fact  Just cans soda bottled water essentially Be prepared  it's place where order counter sit down eat probably interact people counter  again    But   it truly hidden gem <EOR> Great authentic Mexican food! absolutely love beer batter avocado tacos rice beans! nachos yummy well <EOR>
