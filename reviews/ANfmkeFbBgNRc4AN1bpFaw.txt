Only 3 small spring rolls $8?! jalapeño poppers friend ordered didn't even jalapeños them! just baked puffed pastry jalapeño taste them  Once again 3 4 small jalapeño poppers $8! Geez!  The Pinot noir wasn't very good tasted cheap wine    a glass $7! Plus soda $2 50 which same price 12 pack mind you  top server messed order he forgot friend's soda she ask 10 minutes waiting plus when paid he bills mixed people across giving change  wasn't fine dining restaurant packed dining room shouldn't hard things right    So all all painting didn't come close original because started things own because instruction confusing unclear but wasn't total loss    Would recommend place would back? Maybe if different instructor server  maybe if let people bring water own drinks food within reason other painting places town  <EOR> My Kids took Birthday     reluctantly rolled middle aged eyes said Sure  BEST TIME adult kids!!

Which but don't them  then comes apparent free birthday dessert chocolate peanut butter which fan didn't eat  bill comes there's water bottle charge which whatever take  But then there's also wine dessert picked  just pretty upset that  Definitely dampened experience spend much food drinks didn't want expecting free  experience making reconsider coming back versus going different company doesn't kind communication breakdown cheating system where people order items expecting billed them then being billed anyways   My suggestion would another company takes restaurant where you'll know exactly you're getting still getting painting  <EOR> Not happy customer service company    couldn't class which wasn't full weds night because policy wouldn't give refund offer another class   emergency room all could say sorry   going did stop another even group going night     Shame customer service should come first always seems going down toilet Las Vegas  <EOR> this place awesome found hobby  food drinks well priced great  staff awesome  love Jen  she encouraging friendly hilarious  if need girls night place ladies   AAA+++ <EOR> Had class reserved but found just hours prior friend accompanying arriving later expected  called explained situation told no refunds no credits   period  wasn't looking refund just credit use later time  website FAQ section late arrival policy isn't clearly stated just 'you may asked reschedule another session ' which sounded if willing work you  Anyway back phone call recommended come if able before 7 15pm  7 00 caught within minutes  instructor wonderful all 'artists' room  Waitstaff attentive but food just mediocre  glad didn't let strict no refund no credit policies way good time sometimes just roll it    <EOR> I sister some friends  much fun  already planning next visit  did sugar skulls first difficult but instructor encouraged going look great end  <EOR> Went cousins first time painter but wouldn't able tell finished product   Great instruction great atmosphere good wine I would suggest more finger foods grapes cheeses easy foods    instructor fun thorough very encouraging!  servers doubled assistants equally encouraging friendly!!  going back again continue back family friends!  much fun! <EOR> I've seriously dying paint night finally made happen past Saturday  purchased Groupon immediately used voucher Tahiti Sunset painting session  Christina painting hostess coordinator she awesome!
