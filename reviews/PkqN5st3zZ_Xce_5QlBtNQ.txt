Lukewarm cute   Don't know if should said something while restaurant but probably wouldn't good idea seeing hard girls working apologize customers etc    I high hopes place but just way hyped up  Probably won't coming back  <EOR> I arrived around lunch time busy all  atmosphere quite homely roomy Hawaiian feel it   ordered Loco Moco Classic Hamburger very nice presentation  Looked standard Loco Moco seen  cut right through ease egg yolk dripping down rice  First bite noticed rice hard  enough water pot many days old rice  Half way through noticed rice even warm no longer  experience going downhill  really want place  Rice comfort plays major part hot meal  Preparation errors could costly hopefully correct issue  might give second try  <EOR> This food delicious!! guava pancakes BEST!!!

Everyone really kind staff always checks see if we're doing ok    I highly recommend guys check place ! won't disappointed ! <EOR> Here's reason 3 star came birthday because wanted somewhere new passed going Babystacks bad idea!! 1 10 min wait sit full service area not bad 2 5 min wait see waitress order not bad 3 35 mins food! Bad kids hungry means nonstop whining when getting food hungry which all parents know very annoying!! 4 food actually good! hubby Kalbi loco moco mine little fatty but flavor good  son red velvet pancakes he didn't them because he's use Babystacks but thought delicious! Very fluffy!  5 no kids menu order regular menu pay more! didn't since kids don't eat much anyways both different tastes can't share food   I would back anytime soon  Maybe when figure food much faster  <EOR> After having visited original Cinnamon's Oahu high standards vegas location all exceeded!! did some price comparisons everything ordered cheaper Hawaii menu would expect plus no 3 hour wait Hawaii   of course desert beautiful tropical paradise pros cons   Service friendly didn't even look funny when took food outside pictures fact excited!!   My husband short rib loco moco boneless Korean style short rib white rice scoop mac salad  short rib tender perfectly seasoned   I half order Kalua pork Benedict kimchi fried rice  same Benedict Hawaii honestly pork better Vegas!!! very happy choice   I wanted guava pancakes but once saw pistachio knew  have! shared short stack delicious super fluffy rich pistachio cream   onolicious!! Great place brunch taste Aloha! <EOR> Heard place daughter morning while doctor   Decided find maybe try out   Easy find location best but inside size place very big atmosphere very nice   Very limited decor because its new but nice workers very friendly helpful    Wife mixed plate kalbi fried rice noodles very small portion missing kim chee very small pieces spam looked tasted old   Kalbi very hard chew cut   farmers omelet which good supposedly buttermilk pancakes 2 ea pancakes tasted kinda bland syrup table   Gave try very funny taste unsure was  a mix lemon maple whatever   Coffee very expensive refills  no free refills place   Everything served paper plate why?  Total bill just wife came nearly $35 no discount   IHOP place not    I liked waitress work staff  very friendly helpful not mention pretty    need real better cooks know Hawaiian style foods the ones best   back maybe due very high prices just breakfast drinks   Best advice bring your own drinks drink water lemon  oops might charge lemon   Couldn't believe cost small cup coffee  WOW! <EOR> Absolutely horrible service when tell literally walked did helped 10 minutes while no customers just because workers talking  Left returning  <EOR> First timers came Saturday rush thank god! When walk hostess stand  big room full tables booths  Father right another seating area well  hostess greeted warm smile  She seated other room booth which preferred    I ordered Kalbi Loco Moco Kimchee Fried Rice boo ordered Kalua Pig Loco Moco Kim Chee Fried Rice  food came fairly quick looked delicious  ribs tender kimchee fried rice right amount spice  Kalua Pig Loco Moco delicious well  pork tender right amount saltyness just die for  time didn't pancake which all rave  But sure next time come try Chiffon Pancakes  <EOR> I breakfast girlfriend cousin town   restaurant really nice clean food overall really good   only reason gave them 4 5 stars because cousins girlfriend ordered banana pancakes when she received order literally only 4 small slices banana's top pancakes   pancakes themselves did taste banana either   Other then would definitely eat again would recommend pistachio pancakes! <EOR> What happy place! Service fast courteous  Music nice fits island theme    First time tried specialties chiffon papaya pancakes eggs Benedict    Coffee good solid coffee  Menu claims 50% Hawaiian blend but doesnt describe other half  50% mystery coffee  Folgiers? Maxwell house? Starbucks?   Pancakes exceptional  Fluffy lightly sweet even without syrups sauces  Unfortunately chiffon papaya sauce sweet could feel cavity forming just bite  recommend ordering sauce side separate papaya chiffon  papaya sauce fruity delicious  wish just sauce    Benedict Award winning hollandaise sauce ? hold contest? heard beer tastings but can't wrap head around room full people drinking cup cup hollandaise sauce  Maybe new bar theme? But digress     The lox Benedict very good  sauce thick tasted good me   But untrained can't trusted judge  I'd again    Overall nice Hawaiian breakfast joint  Servings huge calorie count off the charts  Enjoy! <EOR> The prime rib loco moco good   guava pancakes   Always great service   Such great breakfast spot Vegas  <EOR> Service somewhat pleasant but wait your food  !   Food meh    I crab Benedict kimchi fried rice thought good   Red velvet pancakes soggy banana pancake no bananas  although flavor there  I still prefer baby stacks even if wait long food better   Will come again? think not  <EOR> Everything service food exceptional! pistachio pancakes Portuguese sausage omelette  boyfriend hat kal bi short ribs all which amazing! best part food tastes homemade authentic  vibe restaurant very welcoming staff waitress Akila super sweet knowledgeable menu when asked questions! would definitely recommend friends family! <EOR> I Hawaiian omelet split short stack Guava chiffon pancakes  Leaving full happy  pancakes  goood  <EOR> Good eats  moco loco very tasty   Hubby two huge cinnamon roll pancakes said good  going back more!

First time helped would love son fights eat fell love pancakes <EOR> The reason why getting 2 stars because weekday experience  people only limited amount time eat due work  But didn't even food until 45 minutes later restaurant nowhere near half full  see enough staff even though did enough staff should informed long delay  Second Kim chee fried rice ordered came cold  unacceptable! also ordered guava chiffon cake but didn't taste guava all  food special hard cook would just stick other Hawaiian restaurants  <EOR> This great brunch spot  usually sweets but Guava Jelly pancakes amazing  mom short ribs great too   I shorted star because seating wasn't very comfy  charge each cup coffee which uncommon unhappily surprised bill  Though good coffee didn't intend buy 6 7  <EOR> Our waitress said Cinnamon's more express version others Hawai'i which visited often while lived Oahu   GM spoke second told he used work C's Hawaii took 20 years spot LV  Aloha spirit sure miss 808 even more  maller menu serving favorites  wife excited new place open 9th island  guava chiffon pancakes bombness Kailua pole benedict amazing  Great Aloha service hospitality  <EOR> Not nearly good Kailua version!

Really no complaints sure we'll back but somehow think food bit overpriced offered   Try see yourself  <EOR> Just came check place earlier Brunch  quite busy hostess said would 20 less wait  bit odd though bc saw lots seats available? wasn't anything major since taking time looking menu anyway    My partner ordered two similar dishes he Kalbi plate price upcharge kimchi fried rice substitute while Kalbi loco moco  overheard someone ask what's difference between plates server said presentation   kalbi plate everything own while loco moco rice placed under meat egg very top  also assumed loco moco always came gravy but case    I questions myself saw Yelp photos appeared macaroni salad but didn't listed menu side extra  server said only comes loco moco  FYI    Both dishes very delicious  kalbi bit sweet liking but balanced rice  macaroni salad pleasant well  taste partner's kimchi fried rice looked included chipped sausages    The guava chiffon pancakes amazing also  thought would guava infused pancakes but believe just buttermilk pancakes beautifully pink cream sauce all over whip cream  fluffy soft really divine  tangy reminded cheesecake    Our server Jill kept checking great  <EOR> I am disappointed your restaurant   coming since opened Marty wonderful manager  don't know manager now but she didn't even come over talk screwup order  ordered Farmer's omelet received Hawaiian  happened beyond me  even told waiter don't want tomatoes omelet  Also thought would potatoes omelet toast but all received toast  waiter said didn't specify just game toast  specify if wasn't even asked?  The coffee mugs way small coffee lukewarm when  served  Wouldn't better pots thermos table instead server having come over numerous times refills?  Btw food ok  great bad but worth hassle   I haven't awhile since last visit wasn't pleasant but decided try again case something changed   Nothing changed now now COME BACK AGAIN  way want deal mistakes Miss Manager? <EOR> The loco moco really good  red velvet pancakes fluffy  Almost cake  appreciate GM talking story  made difference  noticed other workers talking story others which really nice  Would definitely come back eat again <EOR> Called around 12pm Sunday see if crowd told party 8 could seated right away  showed already table all set waters us  never actually confirmed whether we'd coming but really nice see definitely made feel welcomed   We all ordered variety items but between bf myself ordered 'da moe moe moco ' Hawaiian style omelette side buttermilk pancakes upgraded guava chiffon pancakes $2 short stack pistachio cream pancakes  Waaay much food but everything good  highly recommend pancakes  the guava chiffon pancakes phenomenal!
