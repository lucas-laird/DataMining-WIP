Perhaps even better question is many public restrooms smell better your own room does? Magal's restroom does  burn scented candles restroom provide Crest mouthwash mini cups pour in  Ladies Gents definition next level shit right here    One only experience excellence when dining Magal  Alex's dedication constant improvement customer satisfaction sets eatery apart its competitors  first arrive establishment he hears friend joke picky eater he personally cooks entire meal ensure nothing but best experience  Further establishment provides innovative features such service call buttons all its tabletops provide next level service patrons  outstandingly bright friendly staff Magal outshines competition multitude levels setting new standard customer service serve proper role model other Korean BBQs sheepishly follow  Magal brings tried tested experience directly Korea Las Vegas streets China Town  Eating Magal taking part revolution unfurling Korean dining industry right Vegas  Don't left behind  <EOR> Very delicious!  twice service awesome!  server cooks all meat  plus me!

Meat very delicious <EOR> If baby needs sit high chair AVOID PLACE!

My boyfriend chose small beef combo  did expect having much banchan!!! portions generous too   loved both cold soup hot soup  OH! barley tea!!!! Such big deal because haven't since little girl when mom used going down memory lane each sip   The only thing would change pace servers cooking food  think should slowed down few notches just belly digest food before next round    but minor detail lack communication part  Also some meats could more flavor differentiate little more each other    Other service great time walked door warm greetings cups kept full tending grill left full tummies! David great server! Overall great experience! <EOR> Busy night did serve great but food still good Price fair  Service improved <EOR> I beef combo but dont really marinated kalbi taste weird  Overall food good  side dishes good worth try because still new service friendly  <EOR> First time here  decided beef combo $59 99  service okay  pretty empty when between lunch dinner but really slow  lot Korean bbq places place just okay best  side dishes pretty good but meat didn't really stand out  didn't know yellow stuff around grill  thought cheese but found late egg burnt bottom  Oops   the beef sushi looked good but didn't taste very good  liked grilled pineapple more all meat  pretty disappointed since came high expectations reading yelp reviews  Yelp let down again  Maybe off day them but still would back  plenty better Korean bbq places Vegas  <EOR> I've few kbbq place think average  Compared other restaurants offers limited sides  don't give fish cakes serve cold soup didn't much perhaps other enjoy but cup tea   This place isn't cheap  thing thought really cool torch meat front beef sushi serve you   Service great though play upbeat Korean pop music! <EOR> The food service phenomenal! thing cannot stand poor ventilation! couldn't breath all smoke coming grill neighbors grills  food great but couldn't even enjoy food  inhaling more smoke food! think would rather down street Hobak where food just good where able breath  really need something smoke here   Perhaps new exhausts fans Magal? <EOR> After eating Magal BBQ LA knew try Vegas!

Made no sense she obviously lazy didn't want prepare it  Whatever  obliged since hungry    If overheard employee down selling tables I'd enraged    Upon sitting down grill side bowls mayonnaisey corn salad unidentifiable sauce  later found egg  didn't look seem eggs because never cooked! soupy raw egg mess  fan salmonella didn't even touch it    She put first beef dish grill unenthusiastically pushed around  She wouldn't let flip meat would evenly cook  She announced first course ready eat  wasn't  wasn't rare gray raw    Repeat x2 rest meal  waitress even turned off grill before done! weren't even close closing time! rude    We made though picking looked tolerable left asap    home eat good food!  The food loaded MSG too  left itchy sneezing  maybe 5 bites food  couldn't fast enough  even serve HOT tea plastic highball soda cups! Gross    We also never offered included dessert which fine us  probably would've melted ice cream worse    Never again  disgusted  many great Korean BBQs waste time going here  <EOR> I came family korean BBQ  place all eat little pricey  meat dishes $25 $40 per plate  However did think tasty  beef brisket best tried  sliced really thinly thought flavored well   The sesame oil plus salt combo gold  favorite sauce combo korean BBQ meats   Prime short rib good   I thought beef sushi weird  Teriyaki sauce it   The side dishes bit lacking  didn't see much besides kimchi liked  really wanted potatoes fish cake!  The shaved ice dessert good  think supposed snow  condensed milk topping best  <EOR> This third time came here  Great food wonderful service all small pork combo much food hard time finishing everything  back again <EOR> By far favorite korean bbq spot Vegas  could eat everyday  beef combo 2 perfect amount two people 3 even  However 4 person beef combo bit much only 3 people  staff great day night  Alex super accommodating  always above beyond  Oh late night discount 15% off entire bill   I'm definitely regular but no longer come back  many times drinks spilled server   Nothing taken off bill  kept coming back food  But $80 plus each visit discount proper discount  Once beer bottle broken server glass flew all over table personally ask fresh condiments  Because glass everywhere  Super clumsy service  <EOR> LOVE PLACE!!!! place phenomenal!!! My new favorite Korean Bbq place! Maybe more 10 times since grand opening   Lol The waiter Andy such great personable guy    All staff include young manager awesome!!!

I didn't try smores end but friends said would preferred graham crackers instead rice crackers ? offered  <EOR> Avoid place! other day nothing but nightmare  When just walked place steaming hot  food server wasn't very good all  First all when arrived 6pm  told ran chicken day  only few options left because limited menu  Beef beef more beef non seasoned no taste  Couldn't refills water!!

Friendly staff  interior    definitely returning <EOR> Yung awesome  He attended every need educated well various meats side dishes  definitely back  <EOR> Two new  Korean BBQ restaurants opened recently Magal Hobak   They lot common Both provide very high quality meat unlike some AYCE Korean joints Gen Sura  Both staffed young Asian men women brimming positive energy  Speaking brimming Magal servers wear coolster fedora short brims Hobak hatless    Our server Troy sensational did all prep work all cooking engaging  clearly committed group enjoying themselves   Frankly Troy should running restaurant because people actually running restaurant heads asses which may why only ones wearing coolster fedora short brims    Here's why Magal does wine list brought bottle 2010 Bordeaux beef pork   When asked opened Troy informs corkage $25  corporate policy he says  top don't proper wine glasses we'll drink water glasses! WTF!  I ask see manager   He slinks tell two things 1 charging corkage when restaurant no wine own nothing short stupid punitive  2 Magal's main competition Hobak just street encourages patrons bring wine charges zero corkage   The manager listens  Says nothing  Then slinks away leaving noticeable trail slime he goes   Here's lesson #1 any business It's easier keep customer new customer   That means when buyer participating business transaction seller should sure buyer leaves transaction positive feeling   BECAUSE  THEM COME BACK BUY AGAIN!!!!  The corporate braintrust Magal must missed course business school   So which restaurant still business next 12 24 months? Hobak Magal?  My prediction soon pile used coolster fedora short brims dumpster parking lot  <EOR> Our first time experience great!

We ordered beef combo beef brisket chose prime short ribs vs  prime rib eye marinated short rib grilled prawns grilled mushrooms grilled pineapples boneless short rib sushi soybean paste soup   enough meat two people    I tell they're really trying service but more occasion server wouldn't really check meat would burn  Now if established cook ourselves then would just taken care cooking own food could easily prevented  But seemed though servers talk through best way eat like telling grilled pineapple marinated short rib etc   fan short rib sushi comes raw then server sears blowtorch drizzles sauce  beef practically drowned tasted A1 steak sauce could hardly taste quality beef    The differences noticed that your usual banchan received some scallion pancake kim chi salad black sesame dressing sliced green onions scallions egg corn pickled vegetable No rice paper available everything's encouraged eat side rice Grill set different egg cooked grill there's cooling rack your cooked meats  Overall cool environment very modern hip  noticed menu even option add melty cheese your food  felt didn't enjoy enough justify prices  Maybe just little more traditional prefer cook own korean bbq eat rice paper no need all bells whistles  <EOR> I doubts coming despite 5 star rating Yelp  thought just going average whatever KBBQ just satiate korean cravings    WRONG! MaGal surpassed expectations beyond  Everything point including server Cat sweet prompt  Meat flavorful delicious  Can't believe best Kbbq Las Vegas  Even Korean Kbbq hot spots NYC can't this! Everything super delish portions big service point prices fair  HIGHLY highly recommend!!!! <EOR> Wanted try out  Love decor   David server friendly but ask napkins refills side orders couple times   seated right next blasting clubbing music yell hear each other   However food awesome price reasonable  <EOR> Had dinner Magal last night   Wow don't know if Magal's AC just very inefficient but even two swamp coolers restaurant cooler outside outside nice balmy 110     made whole dinner experience literal pain   entire party hot sweaty mess sitting around cooking meat   Once again Hobak Goong place insists cooking meat you   Though servers nice enough find intrusive flow dinner conversation enjoyment meal itself   cook ourselves guys   Thank but no thank you   banchan ok nothing special particularly savory   going back  <EOR> First time Korea food great !!!

At last minute told item waiting available  still hungry but said last call 1230a when said close 2am  whole time hard ignore another server talking some other customers he'd much rather eat Hobak here  he used work Hobak but quit due liking management kept calling manager names  He also kept talking other people he school calling them fat ***  unpleasant experience  food wasn't bad but service doesn't deserve higher rating  <EOR> I eat place much its good  love change grills meat doesn't burnt  tea good!!

Food It's die meat very tender tasteful  ordered beef bbq small enough us   Service Sunny server lover she's very attentive friendly  Knows customer wants refilled side dish without basking her    Ambience quite but probably because slow very spacious clean  <EOR> They lot tables but wait still over 20 minutes  But friendly staff made wait bit more bearable   They lot menu  Different kinds meat different cuts bibimbap combos etc    We large beef combo  different kinds beef cuts prime rib brisket rib eye boneless short rib sushi shrimp pineapple  Yup shrimp pineapple  beef combo   The drama presentation short rib sushi pretty fantastic tasty too  All other meats delicious tender   We also bibimbap  Theirs bit smaller other places' bibimbap but perfect since already lot food   The service good  They'll cook cut meats you  But dinner 1 5 2 hours long  <EOR> If you're looking eat Kbbq full would skip place    If hate cooking your own meat place you  server very attentive cook your meat you  But downside imo can't eat your own pace    The dessert even brought table before finished meal which annoying because melted time dessert    Their side dishes condiments could way better   Even though high priced cheap side dishes    I would rather drive further down Chinatown AYCE pay less  <EOR> My first Korean bbq amazing! Food excellent service spot all around great time! <EOR> My friends waiting Magal open seemed forever  Magal actually several other locations outside Nevada  locations California believe location New York well  only thing feel though opened late they're disadvantage   My friends came dinner two days grand opening  decided two small combos  size difference between small combo large combo doesn't sense when calculate price it  more two small combos when comes down it  small beef combo small pork combo    For beef combo comes brisket boneless short rib rib eye marinated rib eye boneless short rib sushi prawns soybean soup  pork combo comes pork belly pork neck pork collar spicy pork skirt meat prawns rib eye sushi soybean soup    Everything decently good  didn't care much rib eye sushi because just entertainment  torch raw thin slice rib eye while top some sushi rice  some rice gets torched well then end pour some sauce over eat  more Oh  really cool! when eat Oh okay    Everything else pretty alright  meat quality really good  Also did love server constantly cooking  also constantly changing grills almost every time switched meats  grill itself ring around it  Two areas corn salad egg cooking half ring then area where put cooked meats  didn't egg portion though because if didn't eat right time overcooked  Overcooked egg meh  think would've preferred if put mozzarella cheese where egg would've better    As banchan didn't much offer besides fish cake kimchi  variety puny    At end meal really wanted order volcano fried rice  looked really interesting but if order order minimum 2     ordered two  cooked all front your grill  entertaining watch  flavor? Eh  Nothing write home about    Oh here's real winner night dead bug dropped onto head  felt something drop head just confused when put hand grab whatever     turned dead beetle  Great ending! did tell management kind enough take off fried rice bill compensating us  But odd  manager even said cleaned hoods morning he wasn't even sure where came from  Plus new establishment shouldn't dead bugs anywhere!!! Anyways    Overall think Magal opened really late  already two new KBBQ joints opened before them Hobak Goong  tried Hobak Hobak better whole Magal  Magal doesn't hold much difference many other KBBQ joints aside server changing grills every time  meat quality somewhere else  server cook also somewhere else  end there's nothing Magal would back     <EOR> If looking amazing Korean BBQ Las Vegas come here  won't regret it   While taking Uber around Vegas sparked conversation South Korean driver  thing led another asked recommendation best KBBQ joint Vegas  He said MAGAL   He expressed hard find authentic BBQ America but place does really well and super reasonable price   sold   We walked clean environment friendly staff  chose MAGAL combo food appeared almost instantly  Seriously freaky fast   At particular KBBQ restaurant cook food you  All sit back relax enjoy delicious food  first few dishes knew would coming back ASAP   And portions perfect  ordered combo two fighting finish every delicious KBBQ bite  I'd very surprised if left place hungry   This place's food amazing staff friendly environment clean modern     am struggling find anything negative place    I just hope chain grows grows pop closer hometown soon  <EOR> Nicely done interior inside super friendly staffs! Since BBQ grills inside generate much heat very warm inside  Need t work better Aircondition installation  no seats bar area waiting customers  Since restaurant over 500 branches worldwide must hard maintain quality food services   ordered beef combo just okay   food much sugar taste all dishes sugary could taste true beef flavor  hope all food could less sugary  Other torch baking Wagyu beef sushi great performance customers   Friendly staffs food presentation deserve five stars but food taste could two stars  could better taste BBQ some other places easily would give three stars  Hopefully taste beef pork would improve over years  <EOR> Great service great food more ask for! recommend beef combo!  looking great Korean BBQ finally! Thank Young great service  <EOR> Always great time here  Meats fresh servers great   Place happening tonight minimal wait  Went beef combo 2  Always when always think going enough but rolled stuffed  tried all 3 combos all great t worry if troubles choosing!  I didn't name server but he awesome  He said he bit cold said he sorry which change some servers carrying hacking right front you   Decor nice feels underground hang out  Dark bright lights around your table see you're doing  neat feature little red button when push sends server over assist whatever need instead trying attempt hail down next person   Well if you're mood some quick Korean BBQ tastes great won't mistaken! <EOR> The service friendly nice environment place   Food good but beef meat portion kind less compare other BBQ place    Overall place ! <EOR> I've many Korean bbq places but place takes cake! atmosphere service food all excellent! price isn't all bad consider all food price  many sides combo really fill some friends up! Highly recommend coming here  Also talked waiter **If plan reservation call 24 hours advance  wait walk during dinner time 40 mins   good is! <EOR> Great place KOREAN BBQ!
