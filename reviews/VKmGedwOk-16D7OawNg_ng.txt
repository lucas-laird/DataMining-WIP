Sushi roll offerings dinnertime extensive several special rolls though labeled prepared try lot able identify types fish don't like  Some nigiri available too  Lots crab preference salt pepper fried Jonah crab claws rather typical Alaskan    $13 person weeknight dinner outrageous easily your money's worth but place isn't likely blow your mind  Service also you'd expect Asian buffet no surprises there  <EOR> Yes cheap buffet food but great lunches Friday night dinners  Why? selection food lunch where else best bang your buck? great selection sushi beef shrimp frog legs ox tail soup   all good enough something under $10  Friday night dinner lobster crab legs crawfish here  Now lobster pretty good  crab legs crawfish mediocore  place always packed seats lot people  main room 3 other separate rooms  Why does such low reviews some people sure  Did expect pay under $10 Bellgio Wynn buffet quality? <EOR> My friends basically MADE come check place out  give 3 stars because large sushi selection  doesn't mean good just means offer larger selection most Asian buffets to  actually think sushi all same just assembled differently  buffet itself disappointingly small far food selection  roughly $9 lunch could've worse  lo mein best menu option opinion crab rangoons  <EOR> I give 0 stars!!! I just passed very hot day asked very nicely glass water  The Chinese girl front refused give she said she give a free water And buy  She very rude unpleasant would never refuse someone water left shocked <EOR> You pay  if budget don't mind eating limited selection then place  Service bad   <EOR> Visit every time Vegas  best location branch  Crab legs continually bought out  Love oysters sushi bar  Prices very fair  <EOR> Back August whole family came dinner grandmas birthday  service terrible  Today decided give them second chance  If could give them negative rating would  While eating lunch son noticed something slippery under shoe  He thought water  When looked saw vomit  moved family 5 another table told waiter going sit there  He said No can't sit there  said well vomit under table  He said clean broom sweep up  did want sit but he said to  sat back down husband could still feel floor being slick  He told manager   She said sorry no refunds  Another waiter came over told move he would sweep again  leave  husband demanded refund  finally manager lady called jerk   I reported them health district  <EOR> Lunch monday only $10 per adult?!
