Like previous reviewer also remember coming kid quite happy when stumbled upon location last year   Yeah chain but there's something pizza well good   I've only lunch buffet $5 99? Heck yes! Well right off bat good mood because didn't pay much if before 12 00 probably aren't many other people there  paying receiving two plates drink cup slide left survey salad bar  no strip sized salad bar but lack square footage selection  Then slide over pizza  any pizza buffet just keep bringing different pies   whats nice buffet little each  course there's always some jackass taking 10 pieces himself which 5 he'll actually eat he throw other 5 away  stay your toes if busy could hard pizza want if you're picky eater    They also offer garlic bread twists cinnamon twists glazing  really frosting sad thing don't put much because twists hot frosting usually melts off drips bottom basket great place gorge yourself cheap then roll your carcass back office schlep off rest day while your food coma slowly digests itself away  <EOR> The dining area looks employee break room BigLots  decoration walls wiring extension chords hidden inexperienced do it yourself er  But STILL 4 STARS  explained lady $30 00 budget proceeded order 2 small pizzas almost 30 dollars  She suggested extra large half half pizza  ended tripling amount food still able bread twists chicken wings well   My wait only 10 minutes but she offered drink while waited   People TALKING ABOUT! Shannon lady's name kind service  guarantees repeat customers  tip jug counter usually tells just gonna job nothing else gimme your change  But Shannon made wanna back home check book   Red Robin Denny's BJ's etc  take some notes  If think under tipping because only know serve food  don't know keep customers  When your mentality gets level then earning tips  <EOR> This some best pizza ever had   tried Montagues meat marvel which really good pepperoni pizza which amazing!  Service fast friendly    I highly recommend place! <EOR> One favorite pizza chain restaurants  remember going Roundtable pizza plenty times kid California  Great memories  love pizzas because great crust  sauce ingredients very tasty  always King Arthur's Supreme never disappoints  chicken wings also pretty good  only place better place Shakey's  <EOR> So done renovations    Meh    But pizza still spectacular! am thick crust pepperoni cheese fanatic! When evil crazy craving monster    Round Table pizza monster away  <EOR> When visited woman working cash register very friendly made sure ranch wings packets cheese red pepper   customer service excellent   XL pizza huge   Wombo Combo piled high toppings   decent tasting but outstanding   wings little bland bit dry   All all acceptable meal but nothing outstanding   took food but noticed decor little bland  <EOR> Horrendous overpriced  came hung over food still terrible  asked slice cheese lady responded don't sell cheese shredded cheese   Really?!? work pizza shop dont know meant cheese pizza? The place dirty smelled funky   Worst all bought small Gourmet Chicken pizza soda paid $17! Unreal  pizza disgusting  microwave better pizza  top took over 15 minutes in weird terminology blew pizza   I amazing Italian pizza New Jersey tell good pizza  place absolutely sucks priced top of the line pizza shop  wish could give place rating 0 stars  <EOR> The pizza solid but wings basically little dried chickens  salad bar small but all basics needed good salad  keep tables stocked all parmesan cheese pepper shakers could ever need    The decor bit    well nice just say dated  could use face lift  arcade area small enough sustain few kiddos while  allow control televisions huge plus me    The person taking order offered suggestions which always nice  She even helped most bang buck  particular night tone kids wasn't sure exactly order  ended going few large pizzas some wings  would say wings need some work but pizza spot on  <EOR> You always take pizza chains face value expect authentic New York Chicago pizza places but doesn't mean good   always come friends lunch pizza buffet   6 99 its more expensive then cici's but pay ten times over   pizza covered high quality toppings variety different pizzas all time satisfy all different taste buds   use cheese mix pizzas includes provolone just adds great taste pizza   garlic knots great when fresh hot if old ask new order placed never problem staff accommodating request     salad bar also included bad price all fixings dressings need good salad but don't fill up!  Another plus ability order pitchers beer wash down meal with   Enjoy pizza bring family  <EOR> Round Table alright guess   I visited Round Table first time California road trip 2002   remember being PERFECT PIZZA   guess mind playing tricks me   far perfect   Actually sometimes pizza downright icky   This first places visited when moved Vegas because excited near Round Table   Sadly never did live heightened expectations   Round Table half dozen times ordered basically same thing Guinevere's Garden     each time pizza vastly different   Sometimes cooked perfectly while other times crust almost raw middle   Sometimes pizza overwhelmingly greasy while other times light delicious   don't ever really know expect   really dislike inconsistency only visit Round Table pinch days   most satisfying meal ever but gets job done   2 1 2 stars but since can't halves guess 3 because workers always pretty friendly  <EOR> We ordered med pan maui zaui pizza 3 garlic bread sticks 12 buffalo wings drink 15 15 30 groupon Great deal w friendly service! although total came higher retail price he nice enough ring without having pay extra! Everything served fresh  Pretty standard every RT to  maui zaui favorite pizza  love rt  everyone knows taste quality  pretty far spring valley  ___   probably best rt to  keep guys  <EOR> If Round Table before then expect same great pizza  staff super friendly  only negative thing location inside  place definitely needs makeover BAD! If past run down feel furniture then enjoy your meal    I hope redo inside soon definitely more business  <EOR>
