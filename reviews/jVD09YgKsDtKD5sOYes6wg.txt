I tried Vietnamese rice noodle dishes   knowing exactly ordered pleasantly surprised cold noodle salad I anticipating hot dish    husband ordered pad thai chicken satae his Thai standards both par favorite So Cal Thai place very pleased  <EOR> Very good authentic  Everything full flavor came pipping hot  just imagine big wok burners use kitchen  Definitely your Panda Express Americanized Asian food   Service nice  attentive    Giving four stars instead five due price  Duck pineapple fried rice $26! But then again everything Strip overpriced  <EOR> Prompt service  Attentive staff  Tasty food sauces  brought 4 different sauces taste  pad tai sweet sour shrimp  return  <EOR> FYI restaurant closes 2pm opens again 5pm dinner  Kind weird   especially since located Bally's casino level   where everything operates 24 hours  Eh  but whatever floats boat guess   Food delicious  Portions plentiful  Atmosphere set mood just right  really enjoyed sitting next pond area lily pads floating  = Cute!  Wouldn't way just eat but if you're around area if you're staying Ballys your Vegas trip highly recommend checking place out  <EOR> This place hidden jewel mess Sin City  Definitely welcome change heat weather noisy beeps slot machines omnipresent chaos obnoxious young people  I'm going apologize just said deal it  however apologize obnoxiously rude annoying ways generation which am regretfully part of  review      Tranquil quiet serene  Almost felt stepping into spa  decor lovely  wooden seating area I don't think bamboo surrounding fountain where large buddha figure greets head  whole ambience very relaxing  Definitely something haven't experienced Vegas before    The food delicious! ordered Vietnamese vermicelli bowls pad thai green curry the rice came cute little pyramid shape! other scrumptious dish can't remember  Probably some variation fried rice  any case all excellent robust flavors  waiter shy quiet but very polite helpful  think anything ordered would just tasty    Definitely coming back again  especially open odd hour day when most restaurants take siestas i e  3PM didn't wait starvation hours working trade shows  don't know did but really brought some classiness elegance into Vegas  Thank thank you     <EOR> I honey walnut fried rice basil stir fried tofu  boyfriend ordered app papaya salad found 2 entree 2 app deal 49$  Groupon    yelper mentioned it! scrolled thru Groupon purchased deal ordered another app saved money meal  Thanks yelp!

Service friendly very efficient we immediately drinks refilled without having ask food arrived quickly    I personally really enjoyed food  highest praise give better your average NYC Thai food  flavors perfect love specifically control level spiciness  recommend medium which ideal since enjoy spicy food but when overwhelmingly hot  red curry outstanding but also kept dipping rice into boyfriend's prik king which equally delicious    My main gripe cost  Firstly menu link hasn't updated new prices  should expect pay somewhere between $22 $25 dollars typical curry rice noodle dish  Sadly doesn't even include rice which $3 extra small plate  quality obviously better cheaper Thai restaurant but hard stomach overpriced noodles rice  NYC Thai runs $10 dish average! portions entrees decent left very full least there's that  would recommend place if you're concerned sticker shock  <EOR> My friend made reservations restaurant second night Vegas  both big fans thai food must say restaurant did disappoint  ordered iced pomegranate green tea which unsweetened but probably could've guessed prior ordering  Pad Kee Maow which flat noodles which came egg onions bell peppers tomatoes basil chili  chose 3 spice level 5 5 being spiciest   love flat noodles dish awesome  would definitely come back order same thing again  atmosphere great  restaurant's seating area sort divided into 5 sections some sections more private others serve larger groups  love place would definitely recommend it  <EOR> Service needs improvement  Ambience good   Rice noodles rehydrated type least two dishes had   stuck vs loose   Tamarind Sea Food Combo great   remind them bring rice   Option white brown rice   Thai ice tea very good almost no taste   still back try more unique dishes   doubt try common dishes Las Vegas expensive eat available other cities  Considering Las Vegas prices mid low  <EOR> There weren't many dining choices Bally's decided try SEA  Ugh good   Cheap wine way over priced food very good  ordered Drunken Noodles Chicken bland sloppy wet  wife seafood bowl just tasteless looked more soup noodle dish  if want rice better order bowl won't it  cost eat impressed  <EOR> The food really good!

Did slurp directly shallow bowl finished rolls?! Only and dining companion    waiter know sure   The restaurant looks tiny knock off Brooklyn location  Which appropriate since opinion Vegas branch akin beloved North 6th outpost!
