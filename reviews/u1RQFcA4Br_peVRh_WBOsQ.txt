Groupon voucher gave some incentive try something new   disappointed   First some difficulty locating restaurant   I'd mapped Eastern Serene intersection but forgotten write down _exact_ address all hard could find barbeque place corners intersection?  Well harder expected because only sign printed banner sat well below Doc Holliday's sign building kept seeing Doc Holliday's sign missing Top Notch Barbeque sign!  So having found restaurant restaurant chose seats seat yourself place   looked over menu while decided wanted started place order    when server Ashley let know few things   First dinners better la carte because 2 sides price 1 Texas toast don't order separate Texas toast unless you're _really_ hankering it    Next burgers large take 20 minutes cook which may explain some other reviews' complaints waiting meals served   Finally alcohol served next door billed separately Grouponers should note alcohol _NOT_ covered voucher   So deciding then waiting very short 5 minutes served brisket dinner which turned full pound meat actually lasted 2 entire meals   brisket fork tender chock full authentic BBQ flavor even forgot use any BBQ sauce until nearly done   green beans baked mac cheese dinner sides both far better expected them be   Texas Toast pretty alright well   The wife herself half rack ribs dinner plate   Yup another pound meat WAAAAY more she could handle   She loved ribs ate until she couldn't any more savory goodness down she ended eating 2 6 very large ribs table then brought rest home dog just LOVED rib bones too!  wife did manage finish most side green beans but couldn't eat side potato salad because sweetened potato salad not confused potato salad made using sweet potatoes    Note strongly prefer mustard y non sweet traditional way potato salad failed principle least surprise test should warning potato salad  sweet     The dining experience itself really nothing write home don't ambiance   place really busy only 1 4th tables occupied Friday 7pm time slot   decor very lower end average maybe just bit rustic particularly considering prices would expected $50 ticket 2 people decor would par other restaurants same price range   service throughout meal decent but 5 star   server Ashley very very pleasant she even loaned smart phone able claim Groupon voucher when own phone didn't work!  So upsides are 1   Great great great barbeque meats cooked perfection 2   Amazingly large portions 3   Good sides exception potato salad 4   Warm friendly staff particularly Ashley just great! 5   Decent location 6   Groupon voucher incent try but sure tip appropriately!  The downsides keeps 5 star rating are 1   Poor signage kept searching restaurant far long 2  Sweetened potato salad no option traditional style 3   Meager decor especially considering area prices 4   Separate alcohol bill didn't imbibe but warned beforehand 5   website pretty mediocre online menu just isn't complete left guessing until actual menu hand 6   Apparently there's supposed wifi but someone forgot pay bill something which meant wasn't working when visited  In total I'd definitely eat again   Next time feeling need barbeque fix we'll definitely head back Top Notch   Considering price it'll probably once month regular stop we'll looking forward rest month  <EOR> The BBQ always moist great deep smoked flavor dry rub just everything better  ribs fall off bone goodness mmmm  brisket best tasted Vegas they're usually dry every other BBQ restaurant but Top notch's very moist delicate melts your mouth  BBQ sauces great well  Don't pay any attention actual building itself smells old furniture smoke residuals but food trip worth while  good!  Oh sides tasty too! baked beans favorites sweet potato casserole having dessert side your entree    satisfies sweet tooth <EOR> The service wonderful   came into place because GROUPON   men's bathroom disgusting   stuck floor walking around restaurant just seemed really good cleaning crew should come help restaurant out   food OK   BBQ really warm hot still hungry sharing large sampler plate Paul   don't think coming back place   But did try! <EOR> My wife tried place last night   ordered three piece meat platter Ribs Pulled Pork Hot links two sides Mac n cheese seasoned fries $20   waitress brought two plates which nice   super excited try !

Oh well order pork chicken   Both tasty!  shredded pork favorite     The coleslaw favorite side refreshing satisfying!    The restaurant setting bit unfinished but service food TRULY matters right? <EOR> My friend Groupon place decided use it  I bit skeptical given all disappointments food Las Vegas thus far   Upon entering oh great just need saloon  Lol We seated though little disappointed decorum lack ambiance could overlook if food good     ordered rib tips friend ordered slab ribs   When ribs arrived literally falling off bone   owner brought some try just order some good!!!! green beans really good  wasn't fan potato salad cole slaw     What appreciated just much goodness food owner came asked liked food really interested say   He admitted he some improvements side dishes he very courteous friendly   definitely return give another chance side dishes ribs really tender delicious    He much potential establishment wish much success   recommend place others    I meant tell stop putting silverware those tacky jars table   You're trying hard nothing cute it   Just placing them table napkins suffice  <EOR> Went order  took 35 minutes wait time  Beef brisket way much fat  Cole slaw baked beans sweet potato casserole very sweet taste  Pulled pork little sweet but good   green beans good   ordered 2 dinners which totaled $41   way line compared other BBQ places town  <EOR> Went during lunch  Food took forever come out  But when happy  Ribs quite good but star  chili cheese fries crazy good!! side lunch special blown away big portion was  <EOR> I bought Groupon ate Friday 11 1  walked first thing saw woman smoking electronic cigarette blowing 'vapor' stinking restaurant  girlfriend thought Hookah lounge stink bad  little hard find sign building right below another sign bar next door    Sorry write review  girls working very nice but wasn't thrilled food definitely presentation    I ordered rip tips meat falling apart very little texture  put mouth difficulty distinguishing between meet cartilage bone  no char almost if boiled long then thrown grill few minutes  food arrived lukewarm ask server reheat it  Seriously supposed professional restaurateurs directing traffic something simple food temperature    The barbeque sauce bland heavy smokiness which wasn't bad but  all there  Mediocre    Next thing ordered quarter bbq chicken  commonly understood 'quarter chicken' leg thigh  received 2 legs  No mention until arrived table which point late  hate asking things corrected could avoided if server would just informed issue early on  But again directing traffic  server asked if I'd take additional 2 legs said yes else could do? Honestly legs best meat still dry   You used roll paper towels instead napkins  roll greasy handprints top where previous patron grabbed roll  seems they're willing put food safety below cost savings  ask napkins brought over new roll paper towels  Ok compromise guess  If owner would napkins hand least replace disgusting dirty rolls wherever saw them  Instead directing traffic cleanliness   At point feeling hassling servers demands but honestly things should gotten far  If ownership done some simple housekeeping communication might 3 star review might given place another shot   My sides baked beans sweet potato casserole  baked beans pretty good casserole pretty good  Honestly read some reviews people raving sweet potato casserole just don't it  sweet pecans brown sugar  good great yet highlight meal   A 'meh' experience if ever one  Glad groupon 100% worth money regular price probably discount price either  If passes good barbeque food city  bad  <EOR> Where begin? Went Monday 1230   husband ordered brisket   but out? Really    already   at 1230   did just cook one?
