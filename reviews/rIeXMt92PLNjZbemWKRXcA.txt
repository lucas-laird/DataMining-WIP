Operations review First female chef cook came back several times talking iPhone touching personal phone  Any fellow biology major health food professional parent knows precisely dirty is hands straight phone wrapping making some type egg roll  Never washing hands  red flag    The kitchen shielded only glass purposely made eye contact she put phone down counter aka food prep line  She just looked down but continued use iPhone kitchen throughout service    The waiter young boy seemed inexperienced waiter  Very sweet young man but clearly server  Hence service slow flag down every time water left empty ask everything including to go box check  should mention he own far front house  He host waiter busser  Unfair employee myself patron  sat ourselves grabbed own menus    Unfortunately cute little glass pitchers serve tea tiny little Asian inspired decor table aren't enough win over service food wasn't great either     OH! ALSO TOOK FOREVER FOOD COME PLATES COME TOTALLY SEPARATE TIMES   What ordered Beef onion Pancakes  Chicken steak skewers Chicken chow mein Orange chicken white rice   Bill total $36 change   Food review Pancakes bit soggy  saw video review Yelp draining them but figured because beef onions they're bound cause liquid  Nope  plate totally wet under them  Fine okay  However flavor consistent  two cakes cut halves  gf ate half going but having hard time getting down  Something terribly strong overpowering everything else mine  Then noticed she grabbed opposite end  She tasted mine couldn't eat either  Weird    Chicken steak skewers cooked fine others may enjoy them but seasoning over top me  could visibly see covered seasoning    Chicken chow mein delicious gf said  looked good    Orange chicken crispy but ultimately tasted buy same bottle Orange chicken glaze supermarket when home  disappointing    Service 3 10 Food 5 10 Price point 9 10 Cleanliness 3 10  Likely return? Probably not  <EOR> This terrible service language barrier bad but understood since Chinese restaurant  Happen wrong food when ordered  Also gave them another chance waiting 35 minutes forgotten food  top off forgot food son ordered which led paying leaving  NEVER BACK !!!!bad service!!!!!!! <EOR> The milk tea great service good cucumber salad must  Recommend beer broccoli combo <EOR> I immensely excited when saw opening soon sign Mr  Chopsticks driving neighborhood day   tried dinner elated fresh everything tasted   seasoning just perfect amount beef onion steamed dumplings pork chop rice dish came w favorite Chinese braised egg Black fungus wood ear shredded chicken cold noodle  want take parents soon  staff members amicable warm  <EOR> The scallion pancakes outstanding   They're crispy light tasty   also steamed buns signature beef noodles chicken mushroom noodles beef roll   Everything very tasty   place looked clean service very friendly   food takes little longer come but probably because everything made order  <EOR> First time wife loves it   food taste great portions good size people friendly   People should really try place because thought going regular Asian place but turned fantastic would come back again tell others place no doubt  don't pictures food which wish did but inhaled before could lol  good food is <EOR> Not fan  way Greasy heavy me  ordered Mongolian beef wonton soup onion pancakes combination fried rice Lychee green tea boba some other pork dish  requested use less salt  still salty   All dishes oily  I received green tea literally 10 12 boba balls  Looks put teaspoon boba  charged $3 49 + $ 50 drink   Never coming back here  <EOR> If you're looking some good quick Chinese food  American take version certainly find here  Spicy wontons amazing! well tiny pots goodness    It really hits home but course good mama's  but good enough!!

Service setting good too   Jasmin green tea super tasty   Highly recommend  <EOR> Amazing food!! Staff very nice fast service deliver now! Asian pancakes delicious must try it! <EOR> Great food! Service sucks! Water comes first then menu table setting which need ask       They definitely need down     need work training waitress  Maybe grand opening    but back try other goodies see if service improve  <EOR> How provide rice entree?? Did take home no rice  called said included lol  Food ok last time place  <EOR> So far would say Mr  Chopstix probably most solidly consistent Chinese restaurants Vegas probably best southwest   On outside restaurant doesn't seem much just seems regular takeout joint  But once walk inside interior really well done  think previously café something  also liked open kitchen where see everything being made   After sitting down server take order  actually came couple times able check decent amount menu  good mix traditional styles food food appeals wide variety people  sucker honey walnut shrimp made there  sure if batter traditional but whatevs  think where really shine more traditional items  skewers really good particularly lamb beef ones  also liked traditional Beijing noodles spicy chili wontons braised pork eggs Beef pancake appetizer   This really solid restaurant  might somewhat tricky find but once think you'll it  believe prices fair value quality pretty good  <EOR> I came sister once end loving restaurant  near house food service very good   love spicy food ordered everything spicy   am again some food family  sure too  <EOR> This place last minute choice last Christmas Day open ordered take really all delicious decided eat 3 months after  soon sat down girl asked if we'd before said far dinning she immediately said if yelp them we'd free appetizer course said ok sure Free   Food bland clams fishy nasty  never again sometimes free isn't good neither Mr  Chopstick <EOR> It started quizzical name olfactory disorder permeating air  conceded victory luncheon companion when she bullseyed dirty mop soon found each other staring other silent yet unmistakable half rolling bug eyed glare suggested could embarking potential dining apocalypse  But determined stay put Groupon mad hankering onion pancakes    Prior ordering showed server Groupon only told no longer accept them canceled contract them  Some muttering 20% now 40% heavy sighs don't knows  Yeah okay don't really need know life full ambiguity already still want onion pancakes    Our server soon joined another server cook passerby as mentioned full embraced ambiguity reluctant deviate stance aid onion pancake ordering  picture pointing asking many pancakes came order big same process over over over again  Brain surgery should complicated onion pancake ordering    Then ambiguous reasons another server came renewed hope order rest meal  felt new dawn asked Groupon oh yes honor them  Then friend also surge optimism ask new plate since previous server ran fingers all around demonstrate pancake size during pancake ordering   enthusiastically pointed rest order under impression understood    Pointing worked China figured would work Mr Chopstix figured wrong     Our different fathers same mother ice green teas arrived different colors but similar taste  Then came soup never ordered sent back followed lunch specials didn't order but decided keep eat because all difficult exasperating point otherwise    Then came great debate when server asked food friend nonchalantly told fine but she ordered  Then came menu back table server pointing wrong meal friend flipping few pages forward show right meal culmination ultimate same page moment    In fairness server tried reorder meals but fine which think might chicken broccoli orange chicken all bit greasy but ok onion pancakes though stellar good enough rate solid 7    Whose meal anyway concluded greatly discounted final bill gesture requested but unambiguously appreciated  <EOR> It first time looking newspaper advertisement  Ordered kung pao chicken rice beef noodle soup beef onion gyozas all pretty decent  Its normal Chinese restaurant different fusion  restaurant vibe clean edgy server friendly  would come again  But say beverage glass cute  <EOR> Came because horrible customer service experience @ JJanga across parking lot  took Jjanga over 25 minutes them come order left since only 60 minute lunch break  Apparently lunch Gods looking down day  service horribly slow well flag down order when only 1 other person venue  asked separate checks when sat down ordered drinks  Most Chinese places fairly fast getting your food out  ask if lunch specials  Waitress said Special Rice pages menu supposed come soup day some kind pickle something else  write realize never soup day other stuff supposed come lunch special  $9 lunch special isn't really great deal IMHO when many other places fast service good food less price  Service slow  Each plate came itself  food warm least mine not  When check came all 1 bill  mentioned waitress asked separate checks when started ordering  She gave kind peeved look when mentioned but she did separate them us  None cash all needed pay card The place worked since bailed Jjanga because service same parking lot  Unfortunately repeatable venue  <EOR> I China 17 years  really love Chinese cuisine  Almost every day ate Chinese food restaurants Beijing Hong Kong China  recently returned States January   discovered Mr  Chopstix today  comforting see Chinese families eating Chinese restaurant Mr  Chopstix  means reason  kitchen open clean  decorations comfortable inviting  best part food  rare find good genuine Chinese food America  put over top quality food  Reasonable prices cheaper most restaurants Chinatown   I enjoyed pulled pork chive in special sauce homemade toasted muffins  lamb sticks superior China because meat higher quality  Beijing noodles bean meat sauce great too  authentic Chinese find same dish Beijing  staff watched served table well cheerful character                   we come back!  Gong xi fa cai!!! <EOR> I denied ordering lunch special Monday February 19th Presidents Day   No where menu does state lunch specials are applicable week day holiday     The male server did handle situation well all   am loyal customer but left disgust! <EOR> Great place Chinese food SW Las Vegas    If live SW dont want drive Spring Mtn   place go  <EOR> AC broke toasty inside  Brought table then changed mind moved another  Didn't ask if wanted drinks water would nice no air waited 10 minutes take order still didn't ask if wanted drinks  stop waitress walking away water ice tea  While waiting food listened EDC music pounding through speakers authentic Chinese feel  Then food wife came 5 minutes apart mine cold before could start  Food excellent thus 2 stars  But while eating waitress watch ax murderer behind kitchen glass  finished eating watched waitress walked around restaurant jabbering cell phone    she finally picked empty table sit which dirty  family came brought particular table cell phone conversation interrupted  Instead hanging she just moved another empty table which clean continued phone call  somebody else cleaned dirty table  WHY TAKE THEM CLEAN ONE!??? It seamed lots employees doing nothing  No management  P S  booth benches 2 feet table sit edge your seat eat   good luck <EOR> They refuse delivery if don't call basically when first open   close 930 which unusual  called time delivery 9 said no late  Then tried call tonight 745 said no again closing hour 45 minutes  Really?!?@? see calling right before close but almost 2 hours before? Tons more places more hospitable  Order them! <EOR> The pancake hype real! Mr  Chopstix may silly name but super serious pancakes  Sit bar watch your order made fresh open kitchen  pork chive choice but beef onion version gets lot raves too  Feel your anticipation build watch chef stretch form dough scoop stuff filling shape your pancake slap grill  Then wait seems forever because juicy babies take awhile  But worth wait piping hot savory pockets best enjoyed heap chili oil  recommend getting your own order because hard share  Better yet just your entire order  Add couple lamb skewers if want but really pancakes came for  cute drink cups    TIP There's back seating area more privacy if didn't come stare down cooking staff inhale your food  <EOR> My boyfriend randomly popped few weeks ago  live right around corner never really noticed place but poppin'  pretty picky Chinese food but thought food really good especially spam pineapple fried rice  menu good variety options including sweet pancakes milk tea boba  owner helps wait staff customer service excellent waitress host very attentive staff even way provide wifi password  love look design place fact see right into kitchen while making your food  bathroom super clean  look vibe whole place really nice definitely affordable  place new favorite mine  <EOR> 5 stars  Although food comes pretty quickly fast food  Very fresh handmade order glassed kitchen  Watch being made  Very authentic Chinese food  $8 49 braised pork egg delicious! Potstickers rolled fried right front fresh  Big portions excellent service  working way through menu  Highly recommended  <EOR> wait long time?Security very bad?After dinner car front crack windshield smashed?never come back? shave ice good? ?never come back again  disappointed <EOR> I gave 5 star rating because place very clean waitress friendly food excellent  wife friends agree comments  <EOR> My place weekend family lunch ! green bean dishes beef noodle soup pots stickers favorites  great having Chinatown some good Chinese food dishes homemade fresh !! <EOR> I always pass restaurant finally decided give place try  Food good! signature beef noodle soup delicious  broth good beef cooked right super filling  boyfriend steamed pork dumplings  ok  Nothing rave about   also beef onion pancakes but didn't come until done soup just go   Customer service ok  only server pretty busy too  He forgot add boba milk tea drink too  Speaking boba boba tasted weird  think might cooked long texture felt weird biting into it   Definitely coming back since nearby  Hopefully customer service better then  <EOR> Really nice ambience  Seems clean liked open kitchen! Ordered spicy beef soup good! Should totally try that  Though pancakes hard eat chopsticks fork    use hands <EOR> This review service lack thereof  perplexed why place even open lunchtime felt deserted service backed up  took two friends aren't Asian felt thoroughly embarrassed blatant priority placed Asian patrons walked served before us  hate see happen felt true when two other non Asian patrons came physically look waiter take order then again ask ETA food third time cancel order due long wait  Seriously disgusted obvious disregard customers aren't Asian  table served but only received food while guests wait finally insist ahead eat while cancel orders which vantage point looking into empty kitchen evidently being prepared  took mine left friends  <EOR> The most annoying waitress ever  frustrating seems don't understand menu when she's barely speaking understanding English  condemning someone learning language just understand frustration here  She also served only 2 servings water when we're 3 people  She unwrapped straws too!! sweet but don't u think I'd myself don't want people touching tip straw where going put mouth? ordered skewer lamb skewer beef she looked annoyed asked just one?

Egg drop soup besides spilling lacked flavor! Actually NO  Flavor all! Took taste garbage! Never egg drop soup tasted bad   Pork cabbage pancakes OILY!! must taken them fryer threw them into box because soak them paper towels myself  Wasn't anything special  Needed more flavor!  Wonton chicken soup extremely bland just egg drop! broth tasted really funny  threw away  Asked no seaweed guess most forgot    Chicken Skewers totally didn't even think chicken looked sausage  Small pieces no skewers  Totally tasted package taco seasoning  Weird know! Lol   Pot stickers Just ok nothing special   Orange chicken Just ok nothing special over cooked but nasty   Sweet sour chicken over fried still bit oily! But opted fried rice instead white totally wrong move! rice white clearly decided add soy sauce! Zero flavor! better fried rice Italian!
