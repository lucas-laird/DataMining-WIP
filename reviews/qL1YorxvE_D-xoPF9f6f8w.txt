Good empanadas     But every single time ask them extra cilantro salsa complain  just ordered them specifically asked extra sauce only one      cup sauce going cover 20 empanadas    Also waitresses always goddamn attitude  No reply when say thank faces if you're asking bother   service bad might well pay extra money somewhere else  only give stand service when owner restaurant  <EOR> My husband excited when met Colombian lady playground she told bout place  She hadn't but people said good  We're NYC where Colombian restaurants abundant couldn't wait The 1 star because waiter very nice attentive  being said food awful  wish kind person could complain but worked restaurants many years can't  just fast could  Arepas con Queso maybe OK  it  Chuleta Empanizada smaller palm hand smelled weird old tasted chewy came greasy fried platanos withered salad  $12? joking? Bandeja paisa? No better  Cold weird smelling sausage hard cooked egg questionable tasting meat  Bunuelos no sauce no dulce de leche nothing  disappointing  Why can't Las Vegans decent Colombian food? Someone does right could goldmine  <EOR> Muy sabrosa la comida regresaré y lo recomiendo los latinos que vivan o visiten las vegas  <EOR> Went again check new location  server told close because no else coming due colombian picnic  usually close 1 1 2 later but she serve anyway  empanadas half cold half piping hot??? Why? told mmm she did reply  Ordered some where good except last two dripping grease  food good but service slow  pay counter noticed two cockaroaches told floor didnt even faze she just said its probably because we're still remodeling moving things around  lame excuse!
