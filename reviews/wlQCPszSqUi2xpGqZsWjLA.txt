Seemed odd question course wanted eggs cooked! Instead taking plate bringing back cooked eggs she just brought two more eggs  silverware comes wrapped napkin contained dirty spoon but  scoop raw egg off plate replace cooked egg  Disgusting   When pay bill young man register asked everything was  told uncooked egg  response unsympathetic similar waitress said  bad   Really??? restaurant wants business would handled entirely differently maybe taken plate brought back fresh maybe offered some compensation bill maybe cared wasn't quality dining experience   We won't returning  Although location convenient much better restaurants there  <EOR> Best french toast ive ever had!

When walked waited 5 minutes before anyone greeted us   server finally came dining area seat us  It took hour before finally food   Server said ticket lost   Other customers came finished meals left before food  When finally food wasn't ordered   entree completely wrong another incomplete  Very slow refills  Had wait check  Cashier asked meal said very good   He never said anything no apologies nothing! Never saw Manager Owner during visit    Maybe part problem  I left server tip only because know she  needs them living  Taking care customer definitely important here!  always try support small businesses but least try take care customers  We obviously never back   many other good breakfast places Vegas spend your money on  <EOR> This second time eating breakfast here  The food great  only negative thing say food portion huge which actually good  prepare doggy back your way out  maybe just me  Because see some big people eat lot!!

Highly recommend eating anytime day! <EOR> There many breakfast spots Las Vegas hard choose one     My girlfriend told place called Biscuits Cafe she saw Yelp  made mistake tried out   We few tables actually customers yet drink ordering times slightly ridiculous  top table dirty when sat down  asked waitress clean she did half assedly remained dirty  When she left did come back 20 minutes asked bus boy if he could clean it  He did half assedly still remained dirty  eventually received food  think french toast eggs some sort  didn't really matter because plain tasteless just very memorable    The coffee good guess   We ate food paid left hopefully never return  <EOR> I breakfast once week usually weekend boyfriend  started going just because wasn't crowded other breakfast places  Waiting table restaurant bane existence would rather just leave eat somewhere else 99% time  Also always want booth because hate sitting tables place almost always booth me  food first few weeks just average decent breakfast food  Then two weeks ago tried bacon breakfast tacos  Pretty good!! seriously simple but delicious  Try them if ever here!  There few things would see changed   1 always order coffee water water comes dinky little blue plastic childrens looking cup  always surprising because am ordering water place buying drink  am buying drink give real water  bothers every time just can't figure why policy would give people want water coffee shot water  want real cup lemon!  2 always really bright  think some kind window coverings would nice maybe just some see through screens dim mildly  Sometimes wear sunglasses inside place    3 think some people work confused rewards system  first person explained said rewards earn points don't expire  sense because basically spend X X free system  Then other day birthday reward points reward girl told should use points reward because expires  actuality birthday reward should expires only good month your birthday which ending soon  If used points reward she wanted would lost birthday reward all together  far am aware right now points rewards don't expire  could wrong but would hope would put email something if expire know when  reeducated someone staff does  don't really care which wrong but don't confusion  <EOR> Not many people yet seated waited more 10 minutes before walked   I given water but no seemed interested taking breakfast order  Service lacking greatly no communication acknowledgement would take order  Disappointed hungry     <EOR> Super friendly staff open floor plan great scrambles!  The biscuits tortillas tasted fresh maybe home made  scrambles used fresh food produce cooked just right  Definitely 4 star food plus little   The hash browns pretty bland maybe underdone  only negative item  <EOR> Stumbled into gem almost accident  fiancé debating where breakfast took wrong turn or two found Biscuits Cafe  loved biscuits sold name alone!
