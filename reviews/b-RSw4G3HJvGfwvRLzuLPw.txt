cream dessert    Found bacon wrapped dates soft sweet  ribs also sweet side but still good would help many  'sweeter' dishes together  <EOR> My girls decided try Sugarcane viewing restaurant week menu  $20 prix fixe lunch menu great deal especially since items included offered regular menu well  If first time diner eat between now June 30th highly suggest restaurant because sample offer great discount  Even if cannot eat during restaurant week prices still decent especially being strip  Tapas range $7 22 more decadent dishes bone marrow ranging closer $28  also order full size entrees few dollars more  Plus great happy hour menu 4 7PM 11PM close offers half off prices many popular appetizers drinks  first experience Sugarcane definitely favorite dining spots Restaurant Row   Let's talk Location Ambiance It's bit tricky find because restaurant located very end beginning Restaurant Row depending where parked  access if park Venetian Palazzo but keep mind located end depending where you're coming from   The decor very simple elegant  Think beige leather seats dark wall panels glass window accents flower petal ceiling fans large mixology bar spans across length whole place  Lighting dimmed almost feels combination old English game room meets cigar lounge meets historic library room  perfect ambiance business dinners intimate brunch    Let's talk Food Sugarcane's menu heavily influenced Eastern cuisine  would say 80% items menu Asian fusion some type  food absolutely delicious although smaller size tapa style     Our first course Snapper Ceviche aji Amarillo sweet potato crispy maiz concha Salmon Poke seaweed sesame soy   Both dishes fresh distinct its taste  snapper more light citrus side whereas salmon savory saltier  Both very good great palette starter    **The second course Brussels sprout orange sweet soy bacon wrapped date linguica machego   two items stole show! first skeptical items because seemed very ordinary however definitely best pairings ever tasted  brussels sprouts charred perfection then glazed sweet soy reduction  paired orange slices added tartness sweet slightly bitter taste dish  perfect combination flavors  date wrapped bacon absolute favorite! date sweet outside stuffed delicious linguica Portuguese sausages  When eaten bacon enhanced smokey flavor both meats very well  actually anticipate going back just order item regular menu    The third course chicken thigh gem lettuce wrap sweet soy angus slighter Tonkatusu caramelized onions shitake   honest wasn't big fan either  But fair hard impress brussel sprouts bacon wrapped date  chicken thigh grilled well but tasted ordinary teriyaki chicken The slider extremely salty  way much wasabi sauce over powered other flavors  don't think I'd ordering those two again future    Lastly Torrejas dessert which caramel french toast topped caramelized apples cinnamon ice cream  dessert decadent albeit bit sweet caramel vanilla sauce  However wasn't bad any means    Let's talk Service Our server Russell think? great  He very charming courteous  However did deduct 1 star review mainly because overall service extremely slow unstructured  came during lunch wasn't busy time  took 20 minutes drinks arrive 10 15 minute wait between courses  many times stack empty plates table expecting someone pick but no ever came  runner dropped food completely ignored plates  He served new dishes walked away  wouldn't problem table small begin all those extra plates dining surface felt very cluttered  busser didn't come around until desert course  time water wasn't refilled even once dirty plates stacked even higher end table  casino restaurant strip service disappointing   Overall still recommend restaurant definitely back simply because food good  Hopefully next time service better  <EOR> My visits Sugarcane its current location Venetian only few days opened  sense disorientation evident most staff during time may due little incidental  being said bartenders interacted good attitude general avoided getting flustered easily far could tell  if looking fine rum cocktails nearby place surely solid choice  Tobacco rum Old Fashioned simple its classic presentation yet original enough stand crowd  favorite here  Hemingway fine presentation indeed but bit tart IMO  Rum n Bramble Beet Mojito decent choices yet seemed tad similar taste each other  Still atmosphere inviting during stay rum cocktails place's redeeming quality end  <EOR> The food awesome  instance Ceviche short rib korean style delicious  good lambchop too  service best but good  hard find waiter but people around able help well  only downside restaurant no restroom  just need use outside restaurant  Making very awkward coming back into restaurant restroom break  <EOR> The bartenders amazing undecided drinks he brought some try  frozen mint julep two thumbs would recommend  strawberry balsamic drink BOMB  <EOR> First time coming would say would definitely come back wonderful service aldana server food delicious !
