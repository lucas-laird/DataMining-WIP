Down side don't answer phone don't bother calling order  Minor irritation but ordered wish could ready when pulled up  <EOR> Food horrible   Soggy French fries hardly any meat burrito  Best bet order just chips salsa  <EOR> We decide stop last night give new restaurant  try  stood counter several minutes greeted host server  staff meeting bar area paid no attention  left without being acknowledged any employee   all excellent mexican restaurants town probably wont bother another attempt  <EOR> Friendly staff  far food concerned more authentic alternatives there  <EOR> I understand new restaurant but quality food service very low  guessing lot experience  food below average if you've good home cooked Mexican food understand   server put finger plate she handing no music playing which made overall bland experience  <EOR> I just ate order some garlic shrimp  Unfortunately shrimp over cooked super hard could even taste where burnt edges  garlic needless say also very burnt  pretty much didn't salsa beans all much generally could much better dining experience here  <EOR> While did think food better many local Mexican restaurants doesn't food good   Anyone thinks authentic cuisine probably never authentic Mexican food  best American Mexican   We trio fajitas he shrimp very tasty steak chicken fair   beans rice bland     For place called Chips Salsa those two things only adequate better buying those things Cardenas market   would say house margarita nice strong   So while better most local Mexican places LV really memorable all   keep looking  <EOR> I am love place! wonderful atmosphere!  great Wall decorations!
