I just don't appreciate dishonesty Red Velvet Cafe displayed  People rely accurate information eat if information available  Now cannot trust anything Red Velvet Cafe says any food  you? food may delicious but actions left bad taste mouth  <EOR> Every time come back into town absolutely stop here  taco salad  would recommend most definitely  used Sahara but always closer when visit now  service always great wish more hungry dessert but always love chocolate chip cookies no matter calorie count is    Love strip  if great lunch spot between shopping <EOR> I tried vegan tiramisu which favorite dessert   actually quite disappointed  dessert supposed very delicate light airy melt your mouth  bought Red Velvet Cafe very very sweet very very sweet eating spoon full sugar  no moisture cake  sorry but vegan tiramisu even regular tiramisu  <EOR> I've eaten many times  counter place your order  server bring your meal  Today wife shared Cuban press sandwich  grilled chicken turkey pickles lots mustard low fat chipotle mayo low fat Swiss cheese  comes small salad side  chose Chipotle Caesar salad dressing side  salad would describe foofoo salad lettuce  dressing terrific despite poor choice lettuce  Sandwich panini  absolutely delicious  dessert stuffed chocolate chip cookie  cookies decadently good  place excellent quality inexpensive very informal lunch  <EOR> Um Red Velvet Cafe heck happened? used wax poetic amazing red velvet cake much better any versions back home  original location twice mall location once last August  Every time red velvet cake great treat  Vegan! only 150 calories!

As soon put fork frosting disappointment frosting crumbled into pieces  Sure chilled cooler but nowhere near cold enough crumble way  taste didn't it  Perhaps spoiled Sprinkes Vegan Red Velvet could barely taste difference between Vegan frosting regular Cream Cheese Frosting  frosting cupcake overly sugary frankly cheap tasting   The cake dense dry    SUPER DRY could barely fork through it  consistency dried cornbread  tasted stale chocolate cake    I ended tossing hockey puck  going bring back counter refund but ask them nerve sell something stale  more week old  can't imagine otherwise  didn't bother saying anything  bad taste left mouth until reached favorite dessert spot not Vegan Jean Philippe  Now  good Red Velvet    I gave place two stars because feel guilty only giving but  really all deserves    Message management If specialize Red Velvet should made fresh daily  If fresh may want find another talent  Sorry  <EOR> Great healthy gluten free options close strip! happy found healthy gem! <EOR> Friendly staff good food not great but opinion worth price  $40 bill 3 people we ordered veggie pizza veggie wrap 2 juices all share     KUDOS being good vegetarian option! non vegetarian dishes menu well     I understand Fashion Show Mall thus shouldn't expect cheap prices but food opinion wasn't delicious enough pay much  would recommend looking food court elevators towards Auntie Anne's more wallet friendly mall session meal  <EOR> Finally mall food doesn't hate yourself eating! Fantastic healthy meals great lunch  see options cold case before ordering which helps dreaded decision making process because helps visualize you'd getting  Once decided heat grill panini whatever last min garnishing meal needs then put acceptable plate serve you  Service quick  Can't wait try cold pressed juices next time  am kidding back Red Velvet cookies  <EOR> Either use stale beans machine set properly  Whatever think ordering espresso you'll nothing but shot coffee grounds bottom glass  blame owner staff being able pull decent shot  <EOR> Vegan vegetarian options!

Perfect size split between two people  hope visit Red Velvet Cafe often taste other desserts  4 5 stars rounded <EOR> The only thing say calorie count controversy just because something vegan does mean its healthy   Sugar oil vegan     I give 4 stars because chocolate peanut butter cake chocolate chip cookies good but pretty expensive   Cookies come $1 each   may sound OK but they're only size oreo $5 99 box don't remember if 6 8 but definitely more pretty high   cookies 3x size Whole Foods $1 49 each less if buy package them   However among best vegan chocolate chip cookies had     But chocolate peanut butter cake NOT gluten free version really good   Again expensive $6 50 but its big enough 2 people share if compare restaurant dessert  prices its bad   But again compared nicer grocery store prices its high     I looked sandwiches nothing looked amazing wanted pay asking try them    Would back?
