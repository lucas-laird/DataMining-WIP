So would say disappointing buffet others simply past them  would head other new ones strip which same price  considered overpriced me  would pass unless just want something quick but pricey  <EOR> The food used very good when last time came Carnival World Buffet inside Rio Casino 2011   Back then more different types food taste good also  added seafood many different changes     I visited Carnibal World Seafood Buffet May 29 2016 dinner  Now when added seafood portion $15 extra around $50 regular seafood dinner together less foods regular price items food taste ok very flavorful  Since am local Las Vegas only give 25% off ID locals which ok  Back then always came because 50% off offer  Even change cut back salad toppings   The only food taste very GOOD DESSERT  many different types cakes ice cream Gelato desserts more  seems put more effort dessert other food cuisines   The service ALRIGHT  servers around table good because respond very quick  staff around buffet station seem grumpy happy work    I recommend if want try new buffet very HUNGRY eat here  If gone before try avoid buffet eat something else because worth price  <EOR> What happened buffet???  saddens terribly write today   Most childhood memories excitement Vegas involve trips here   Even today all trips Vegas include least stop Rio Carnival buffet   But weekend highly doubt continue tradition   We around 5 30pm past Saturday crowds   expected no line crowded many empty tables   However started off wrong foot when hostess tried seat party 8 restroom away food   repeating request two times seated closer she agreed albeit unpleasant attitudes   I haven't five months surprised drastic changes occurred since   Beverages now self served but live that   However can't tolerate fact no longer offer different varieties chicken skewers mine daughter's favorites snow crab legs now replaced blue crab legs standard price $34 99 unless you're willing shell additional $20 I don't think so!    amount I'd rather eat Caesar's Bachannal where food quality way better     Today place overpriced   tastes quality gone downhill   Everything tastes old   left 7 30pm line wasn't long same time year ago   probably lost lot customers   Goodbye Rio   am mourning 20 year relationship   But unless return your glorious days am moving on  <EOR> This place use best now just really expensive   Now pay crab alcohol bracelet sucks   drink bracelet all drink selection beer cheap wine champagne tiny plastic cup   Still ended buying custom ordered drinks   deserts great   buffet crab alcohol tip 2 $250  Bellagio Cesar's much much better  <EOR> All good things come end!  buffet use reason built trips Vegas    won't back!   decide charge another $20 seafood buffet creating seafood deficit regular buffet    shrimp extremely tasteless crab legs smaller leftover parts seafood buffet expending more energy dig speck meat then worth!

I came two separate nights while staying Rio business  seeking quick meal both evenings  usually buffets don't wait food don't deal much servers there's plenty variety     All those things hold true here  never wait queue table  seated immediately even without seafood add on plenty variety  And way plenty seafood dishes non seafood areas   nothing unique special offered basically compilation everything ever seen buffet wedding    Unfortunately food just bad  All food laid huge serving trays many dishes did look freshly prepared  fact many trays food crusting over cheese clearly re melted warming lamps yet vegetables looked limp lifeless  found food fill but mostly simple items fine re heated like pizza rice etc items deep fried  Even dessert area which usually glimmer light even terrible buffet wasn't great  gelato flavors tried just weren't good    The second evening tried some other restaurants Rio but all lines people waiting tables reluctantly headed back buffet  slightly better second night some food looking little fresher but overall same previous night    The best part both meals service  cleared plates quickly provided refills drinks without asking    I'd recommend going if need quick bite don't care quality food you're paying  Otherwise many better places eat specifically better buffets try one  <EOR> For once trendsetter among Vegas buffets now most disappointing overpriced AYCE dining experience town! Meat carving station NY strip cooked well done completely dried inedible roast beef tough chewy couldn't even provide fresh turkey day before Thanksgiving! Most dishes lukewarm temps best even if freshly placed consumption Mama's lasagna fettuccine Alfredo pork ribs   Desserts nicely done presented but single choice cake any kind flavor other cheesecake  STAY AWAY!!!!!! <EOR> $42 Saturday night food farther or further?! don't know! eye could see including crab legs? bad Vegas   You can't size variety buffet  Everything tried tasty but I'd ruined stomach night before turning 25 combining best friend's bachelorette party  Anyway liked saw  buffet favorite kid glad see still wow ing me! <EOR> Wow!

Should eaten dumpster Denny's!! use good place eat star many! <EOR> The fall once fabulous buffet years rio buffet seem fallen hard times hotel self fell little but once grand rio buffet laughing stock all other buffets genius charge scaled down Denny's buffet world  33 bucks really old dry lousy food 20 upgrade gets hand stamp entrance  poorly stocked seafood section crazy your better off hash house place sucks  Your best bet avoid place food bad service worse everyone's unhappy The place including hotel looks likes its fallen hard times  What's going Vegas your grand old lady's fading away late rio buffet died no cares <EOR> Omg    the WORST buffet ever eaten  And NO lobster crab  which advertise front  NEVER eat again! <EOR> I buffet enjoy coming visits  pricey but it  People complain person wants take your picture when walk annoying  BUT don't just say No thanks when walk in  reviewer says take picture charge it     true  If let them take your picture then find later ask if want buy print  annoying but don't it  Vegas do    The food always pretty solid think still biggest buffet town  new feature self serve fountain drink machines  super fancy video touch screen lets select your drink  enjoy prime rib ham turkey station very tasty  good seafood section not seafood buffet extra crab shrimp  wide selection including pizza salads Asian food  large dessert section middle buffet great   Sometimes run across some things aren't best but  way any buffet  haven't tired seafood buffet costs extra can't comment part  <EOR> There much menu but you'll find pretty much anything else walks swims flies cooked more ways one  am usually fan buffets but talked into trying buffet staff members named John Roberson   The possibilities endless  Including delectable innovative matrimonies such chicken lobster  The menu relatively large choosing tough prepared spend if you're vacation    I highly recommend trying buffet  <EOR> SO MUCH BETTER when two buffets separate!!! A OK food selections however did upgrade seafood side  Though attendant standing entrance VIP seafood area blacklight all peeped over partition see offerings  few sounded interesting but did appear enough charge extra $20  regular side selections decent  Nothing particularly jumped but your own pho pretty good chilled crab legs though prefer mine warm  service sub par  hostess rude server busgirl nice but could tell she exhausted day  Oh strangely turned music closing  LOL  All all mediocre  <EOR> Generic food overpriced  Only because food credit through Rio  Don't waste your money here  <EOR> Don't believe hype   we ate buffets harrahs paris rio last stay gotta say rios worst   think expecting Brazilian food   rio   not case   filled plate once tough   finished then left   Luckily bought all day pass took bus harrahs finished eating there   Do pay 30 dollars eat here   pissed off  <EOR> This buffet seriously declined quality  pay $20 extra things such shrimp cocktail crabs legs other seafood items any other buffet regular price  upcharge also includes lobster FIVE small tails which all eat previously  layout terrible long walks back forth your seat middle  Other food only so so  Dessert may best all items  <EOR> So Rio use really bring it  Then 4 months ago every time weren't making muscles crab  All sudden your own drinks theres only 4 servers witch fine but case why should tip server just only seats me   haven't back since if your going g sure want first cuz apparently just cuz advertise don't put out <EOR> For 35$ buffet place incredibly meh  True its name buffet offers wide variety ethnic cuisines    could probably find carnival  Chinese food section incredibly mediocre  dim sum felt cheap literally serve orange chicken honestly say far worse Panda Express  made to order noodles literally reminds instant noodles soups very cheaply made      seriously egg drop soup??? The Japanese cuisine also let down  offer different sushi such California roll     variations California rolls    The pasta pizzas good  Nothing more nothing less  taste if store bought some sauce then poured over pasta  Throw some veggies some meats boom World buffet pasta    The carving station fresh crab meat shrimp honestly only selling point  In terms main meal did think deserts decent interesting Honestly felt if just threw bunch fresh crab meat used jack prices  Besides felt everything else just filler food only cheap but also     noticeably cheap    I didn't try seafood section would've added 20 dollars each person  Maybe its amazing but 35 dollars felt sorely disappointed  <EOR> Robert server morning Diamond section  He great very tentative even replaced daughters soda when didn't taste right  He also recommended strawberry pancakes delicious!! <EOR> I mean    lot food  mean probably largest buffet to  But food average  Probably wouldn't back  $49 95 <EOR> **This review seafood buffet**  This actually favorite buffets compared some high end fancy buffets Vegas  endless options Seafood BBQ Asian Mexican Italian American Dessert Station Salad Bar etc  seriously far walk 1 end another which perfect burn off some calories while you're there!

Sorry guys    big fail   Unfortunately where celebrate Dad's 75th Birthday     owe Dad! <EOR> We ate both buffets last night food awful  best thing eat salad  All seafood over cooked rubbery dried tasteless  point Rio use best seafood buffet Las Vegas but anymore  seems bad ideal them combine both buffets  definitely won't back  <EOR> Definitely coming back food great Robert Nice Mimosas didn't stop coming  <EOR> Been many Total Rewards buffet but winner hands down  Robert attentive informative where do!!  staying Rio when come Carnival World Seafood Buffet ask Robert's section!!
