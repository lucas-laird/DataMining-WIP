Here reason personal boycott The Hibachi Grill Supreme Buffet claims give FREE buffet every 9th visit restaurant    Don't believe them using following trick avoid giving repeat customers promised free meal    Here do They hand separate card stamp per visit  If bring same card every visit tell 8 stamps proving your visits invalid denied your promised FREE buffet    I asked manager no satisfaction then asked boss told he here       Then ask bosses phone number she said she doesn't know it    Finally ask owners phone number she claimed she doesn't know owns restaurant    Does sound care your feedback?   So boils down this       This company would rather lose regular customer honor word bond customers    For reason would ask boycott restaurant until management begins appreciate customers    Honesty best policy    I return restaurant again    I hope find review helpful  <EOR> Let start saying place huge!! Where seen koi pond inside buffet?! Unlike other Chinese buffets haven't wait table  $14 drinks included!   My favorite things include hot crabs oysters sashimi baked mussels grilled items  also Mongolian Grill where stack your plate items want vegetables meat noodles egg etc give cook presto freshly cooked noodles! especially good when add garlic chili paste end!   The staff also very attentive they're always quick take empty plates table refill drinks lately noticed best quickly refill crab legs oysters since people taking 'em platefuls     Also sashimi quality gotten lot better!  offer mackerel salmon tuna other fish I don't know name but delicious! tried them all during multiple visits far haven't problems tums fish good book!
