Last time checked would cucumber roll costs less California roll especially fact guest allergic dictates reasonable accommodations made  waitress made big fuss finally told grab manager  She grabbed another server told no exceptions charge more because would use extra strip cucumber lieu crab  Once again kind drugs high think sense charge someone $2 50+$3 75 cucumber roll compared $4 25 California roll??   At point he told order chef asked speak he told chef busy he can't pull off floor  Instead he grabbed business card wanted email owner  Last time checked when guest allergic don't punish them certainly don't insult them refusing amend situation defuse professionally  Needless say next door sushi 21 which although smaller much better service  glad put 15 nigiri order already halfway done when when left haha   Ps  server 8 years 5 different restaurants never dealt such derelict managerial staff  beyond still stay business  <EOR> Being very avid frequent sushi seeker enjoy coming back Goyemon especially AYCE!

Service okay servers dauntingly slow inattentive  took forever bring check despite rushing finish meal   I might return Goyemon give another try but meantime no rush  <EOR> I've heard many good things Goyemon last night finally luxury trying it!

Because food poisoned enough restaurants claim best sushi city  appetizers  appetizers worth all eat  Stay away ramen  taste tap water  <EOR> Got salmon special! Wow ! much just $10! really good!

Also plus open till three am  <EOR> Horrendous customer service very slow unprofessional inept down right rude ! Mediocre food! Dismal portion sizes price!

Only edible thing calamari  Only reason why 1 star coz required lol  Wouldn't recommend place  Staff wasn't friendly either  Ignored when asked refill drinks  Charged extra item also didn't even order  <EOR> Goyemon go to sushi place   quality fish fairly good enjoy creativity different types rolls offered   great experience every time due service fast food delicious wait time not bad even Mother's day   <EOR> Food amazing  Monday night wait bit but  good sign me  Only thing food little slow come order times  But everything delicious once did  <EOR> I'm frequent Goyemon nine times 10 deliver   The service more times quick efficient   waitress very fond but most other servers bust ass daily basis   Food churned consistent rate but don't afraid top servers   there few times when order misplaced chefs     The wait times during peaks hours LONG   Expect Friday Saturday night waiting 1 5 hours seat absolutely take reservations   However wait very much worth experience   I'd recommend heading over PT's block down grabbing beer while wait them call tell your table ready   They're pretty flexible understanding may take five minutes back restaurant your seats   addition would highly recommend going dinner going during lunch   service food always better evening during day   The overwhelmingly majority time fish fresh gets Vegas good two visits months time during past year half partner going where freshness questionable   However temporary   next time visited quality excellent     often some very beautiful cuts tuna just die for   I find quite impressive AYCE restaurant serving quality meat   range items order AYCE menu insane but love variety   would recommend following if you're going doing all eat first time Nigiri Yellowtail Garlic tuna Super White Tuna melts your mouth   so good!  absolute favorite! Cajun tuna cajun albacore cajun tuna special run quick but find cajun albacore great substitute   Red snapper  Grill Steamed edamame I find garlic edamame far greasy stick steamed! Pork belly Super white it's special Yellowtail  Rolls Magma Sexy girl the cucumbers pair well roll Crispy rice Yebeisu Salmon skin  Dessert Red bean ice cream! big green tea fan but everyone tells green tea creme brulee excellent   If just want try bunch different rolls order half roll large majority items   Trust tempura especially baked items   you may want too!  For quality sushi dinner that just happens AYCE $26 dinner   it's hard beat   just know when hope don't waitress drive nuts! <EOR> This probably second favorite sushi joint Las Vegas I still slightly prefer Sushi Mon    Goyemon does everything right   Firstly vast selection rolls creativity certainly there   Additionally service good servers attentive made sure everyone party drinks filled all times     As far sheer quality concerned feel Sushi Mon edge   hate comparative review because sure Goyemon worked feverishly create its own image however feel just something can't help only because always feel need rank restaurants   gives better sense where especially if time constraints   I give Goyemon edge pricing which two dollars less Sushi Mon's   Goyemon charges $26 95 AYCE sushi which isn't bad relation charged elsewhere city   Goyemon also allows unlimited dessert orders which exciting especially once taste Fried Ice Cream Tempura   no shame saying enjoyed three separate orders   lychee ice cream also highlight meal     Goyemon great place satiate sushi urge you  <EOR> I think if first AYCE sushi Vegas would 5 stars   Compared other joints east coast place awesome   Fresh fast decent sushi without jamming much rice in   However first visit Goyemon being referred personal recommendation favorite sushi place good   unfortunately impressed all!  Sushi Rainbow superior every aspect except atmosphere   But sushi fancy decor left very unsatisfied   nigiri wet mushy rice bland fish   rolls prepared faster McDonalds burger lack time skill put into rolls showed   non sushi stuff good but again thats why came here   Very dissapointed! <EOR> Used good place eat sushi but just last meal there  While having sushi bar showing amputees boston marathon surgeries asked many times change channel turn off refused  0 customer service  <EOR> It first time here  Good ratings Yelp wanting try place  Waited 90 minutes  guess  average  wait system impressive though  When finally seated bar sushi chef wasn't very friendly  He fast though  Nothing off menu really impressed all  ordered ikura bad meaning spoiled  collection plates server never picked up  Nothing extraordinary  both ways  Nothing extraordinarily bad nothing extraordinarily good either  just expected more all high praise place received Yelp  <EOR> Amazing food really fresh fish BUT close 3 won't serve AYCE 1 30 even if try order everything beginning  What's point being open until 3 if won't serve you're known which AYCE?? 3rd time work time say stop serving AYCE literally changes whatever time currently is  servers just seem just want leave which understand because server but don't work if don't hours  <EOR> Protip remember Sushimon Sahara Goyemon both use same punch card! sure those stamps!  My go to AYCE sushi place! best? Well  subjective  If you're looking solid AYCE quality price it  Disclaimer Keep mind all you can eat quality sushi cannot compare super fresh level excellence SOME real authentic sushi places  wouldn't compare Kabuto other ala carte higher quality joints  strictly based comparison other AYCE places   AMBIANCE Decor clean intimate but without creepy silent vibes weird football jerseys wall  Low mood lighting laid back doesn't feel casual  don't need dressy either   SEATING Try getting seat bar! Intimidated order? eye contact sushi chef facing even he looks busy then say you'd like!   Service definitely hit or miss once while  place popular weekends especially during dinnertime  Last time still quite busy weekday dinner rush hour  Always expect wait! party 5+ very difficult seat! believe don't take reservations over phone but heard changed according some other diners  If you're just dining other person lot quicker especially if say don't care if you're seated table bar   FOOD countless times enough fill 5 stamps cards few paycheck's worth! fish always tasted fresh crisp  Fish portion generous  don't try load rice unless you're ordering mostly rolls  Love questionable super white tuna  ubiquitous americanized rolls usually on point large presented beautifully  fave moon roll!  Try ordering half orders case end disliking particular roll  way sample many types rolls  often see people next saying eating rolls because much didn't prefer it  end knowing order half! Ex say half dragon  half whatever   It varies your chef when comes execution  few times roll nigiri come looking beauty school drop out C sometimes consistency issue when comes presentation   VERDICT Although Goyemon hyped really because try bring better quality fish masses AYCE crowd  Service suffer when packed  Last time server totally forgot sitting corner bar! When he saw drink completely empty he tried diligently coming back checking since then   Fun date night spot small together  solid experience hands down favorite AYCE sushi spots  <EOR> I love sushi more specifically dragon chubby rolls  They're great  Sushi Mon used favorite AYCE Goyemon superseded reason reason only  Pork belly  no idea sauce put pork but perfect  same great sushi side tempura ice cream now pork belly  Sweet  <EOR> I say tried just every sushi spot all Vegas Goyemon far best  offer ala carte menu famous AYCE all eat   food absolutely awesome fresh  fish rice ratio point service just good  Nice friendly helpful staff  must go  <EOR> I waited 40 minutes thought turn instead someone slip host some $  wait another 15 min  Its sad but food great threre server extremely nice  why came back friend Bday everything perfect until end again host time  female host ask leave because seating over certain time  understand because wait friend cause she stuck traffic  m just wonder y table next same amount guess thier before   Y she ask but them still some desert comming yet  Even servers supprise  Places doesnt need kind   hosts just ruin business <EOR> After patience hunger best twice before third time ready wait   and wait did  waited 15 20 minutes not bad compared est  wait times seen past  Anyway ordered #14 Lime Roll #??

I thought lot rolls way much rice them especially 5 piece rolls soft shell crab Nothing really stood while quality fine wasn't blown away     For crazy place gets service very good   sushi chefs must some fastest town   60 minute time limit dinner which understand but don't like   Don't order much off big menu you'll charged leftover food even rice      Save room dessert tempura ice cream really great  <EOR> My absolute favorite all eat sushi place! Fresh delicious great service      Try ecstasy roll personal fave P <EOR> Goyemon favorite spot past two years never bad experience here  recommend cajun albacore salmon saba nigiri  if lucky Monica might your server  She very helpful when members couldn't figure chop sticks terrible teachers  might wait but  expect popular sushi spot  <EOR> After Las Vegas Santa Run 12 03 11 some friends looking celebrate victory accomplishment   My friends left decision making where eat think experience wont anymore    The customer service mainly reason why rated Sushi House Goyemon low  also see some fellow yelpers similar experience  hardly waited on  seemed very annoyed requests questions menu  also funny server told straight off bat 45 minutes order all eat  top off gave checks literally took more 30 minutes take payment  No lie could easily walked restaurant without paying would even noticed  walk workers near cooking station tell if would money  Sounds funny  But Smh    As food good  bummed miso soup wasn't even hot especially crazy cold weather! However did crispy spicy tuna roll hurricane roll tempura ice cream  all  <EOR> Most sushi bars some barely passable fish but Goyemon across board least great some fabulous   Salmon belly example treat   All U Eat bargain considering quality fish   also some interesting roles but order 1 2 roles keep enjoying variety  Goyemon gets crowded times but worth it sitting bar fine   best A U C E had   anywhere  <EOR> All eat AMAZING sushi  Need say more  Hands down 5 starts!!

Service nothing but wonderful  love variety  Orange County still haven't found place comparable ayce sushi place  <EOR> I'm usually fan AYCE restaurants   Especially when comes Sushi   Sushi Goyemon exception   This your standard ACYE sushi affair   don't walk station   no lines   Food does sit under heat lamp   Rather order desire menu comfort your seat   The menu extensive consists your standard sushi sashimi rolls   However also include variety appetizers grilled items specials desserts more   may come thinking you'll your value only based volume much consume   Don't fooled food delicious   You'll your value quality well   Some favorites menu are Sashimi Salad Seaweed Salad Super White Tuna Sushi Salmon Sushi Cajun Albacore Sushi Sunrise Roll Dragon Roll Sexy Girl Roll Volcano Roll Mochi Ice Cream  The atmosphere any other typical casual Japanese restaurant   Then again don't AYCE atmosphere   Just cautious long lines wait when arrive   don't accept reservations expect wait during peak times    The price dinner $27 which seems fair amongst competition Vegas   But given amount usually eat when come guarantee they're losing money   few places Vegas leave winner   Come pure Japanese gluttony great food   won't disappointed  <EOR> We loved it! Price good fish fresh lots variety  would come back  think JJanga little better  <EOR> This place food quality service getting worse fish fresh rice big server said charge extra just two pieces rice just let them charge take off tips!!! <EOR> Too busy mediocre sushi  don't know happened place   Used favorite sushi place now drastically decreased quality service  mussels fried shrimp head taste same but raw sushi blah  <EOR> Amazing  sushi fresh extremely savory  8 different rolls during lunch some nigiri some sashimi calamari special  Yeah ate much but worth it  hurricane roll far favorite  service great ambience great liked away strip  <EOR> Worst experience ever  fish quality Walmart quality  Disgusting fishy aftertaste  All appetizers horrible  Also charged more finishing nasty fish brought us  come here! many better options Vegas  <EOR> Best kept secret Vegas cheap! loved there  strip but worth drive! <EOR> Being SF Bay Area kid also spent few years coast south Santa Cruz may bit spoiled when comes sushi  mean sometimes just plain hungry grab platter sushi Trader Joes but know getting price paying  Now being Vegas being AYCE place wasn't expecting superb super fresh stuff  pretty sure would've better off ordering rolls but watching old Japanese drama mine focuses nigiri craving  Anyhow impressions were     [   Pros   ] Pretty nice sushi place only short walk place Pretty good price AYCE We lunch LOVE AYCE isn't limited sushi but includes appetizers desserts  Baked mussels pretty awesome  Lychee sorbet little lychee bits  Yep mouth there  Miso wasn't overly salty which sadly many places wrong  Tamagoyaki bit sweet side which love consider 'dessert' sushi  = Enjoyed seared sake salmon enough  Food came pretty quick servers generally attentive  Definitely ordered enough justify $22   [   Cons   ] Nigiri serving size  Now AYCE kinda let sure they're just trying sure people finish order especially when comes sushi but nigiri pretty itty bitty  Again probably should've gone rolls over nigiri  But even appetizers came pair servings  baked mussels forgive but tempura? Gyoza? Eh   can throw 3 4 pieces least especially actual size them  No inarizushi? = Isn't standard sushi place? tofu pouches overly expensive don't know why don't it    Also futomaki 'special' 5 piece only roll? would think more standard California roll which under 'Regular'  Sadly time noticed already pretty full  Oh well next time  Teriyaki sauce unagi? Tsk tsk    Unagi = unaju  All all decent place fill your belly cheap but wouldn't recommend nigiri unless its tamagoyaki then wild! Definitely order some appetizers along your sushi your monies worth more protein rice  Again mussels delish  save room dessert  When back definitely gonna try rolls    figure least step sushi  served buffets  just sitting knows long  <EOR> Was big big fan Yama sushi until found place  Yeah cost buck more AYCE but there's no stupid limitations mochi ice cream green tea ice cream   There's also no 3 Rounds Food most AYCE sushi places  worried service would slow but actually food came pretty quick  Overall very impressed visit again  <EOR> Let's keep short point   PLACE LEGIT!

NO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION!!! <EOR> I am sad say place gone way downhill  presentation horrible quality just isn't same before  honestly didn't anything choke down  Even gyoza full water steam   Very disappointed use love coming here <EOR> How served table 9 people under 60 minutes but failed bring table 3 6 9 plates within 90 minute time limit ridiculous  <EOR> Everything always great   Good those don't eat sushi well   Not five because awareness customer comfort <EOR> I liked place lot   close home pricey   ahve some really cheap liquor to   greentini's 5 dollars each 2 gets buzzed pretty fast   always sat bar blast    guess only complaint theres much more room seating table something that  <EOR> Most food good but overall experience 2 stars  start waitress very unfriendly barely even cracked smile  friend hair rolled roll when cut piece hair every section yuck! When finished all eat maybe 3 4 pieces left group 6 said eat rest would charged each plate  Then ate promptly kicked due time frame ahhh six everyone shovels food down mouth  Would never return again  <EOR> We definitely coming back again!  Despite extra long wait we told 45 minutes actually waited hour 15 completely worth it!  If anything wait time testament quality value place!

The only issue might tiny prepared wait hour table  Bonus they'll call down street drinks nearest bar until your table ready! <EOR> This used go to spot AYCE sushi     I even suggest when people ask where good sushi place is  But now probably suggest elsewhere because experience last night   server Pa gave lowest quality service ever experienced Goyemon   When party 8 sat waited 15 minutes before greeted drinks  She came table without hello anything  She no personality no enthusiasm only thing she say 6 year old son can't eat shrimp   Please take Po back mop floors clean bathrooms something   She doesn't belong front house   She ruined Goyemon now gonna ruin Goyemon anyone asks sushi restaurant suggest    Bye Pa  <EOR> I'm right now first time  guess true sushi eater bc only eat cooked stuff lol  came while waiting car tinted down road Eco tint  perfect bc 3 hour wait 13 min walk little over half mile  all eat lunch  much choose 50 special rolls 50 regular rolls appetizers sides deserts  crazy! perfect trying everything bc small portions u half rolls  Everything REALLY good waitress cooks great  sat right sushi bar could watch everything  honestly nothing bad say  only reason didn't give 5 stars bc appearance  very small well decorated there's no bar  first glance if wasn't pretty much stuck without car would've left  But glad didn't  back bring boyfriend  Thanks!

She offered manager because wasn't having it  once manager came over told didn't think should pay all roll hair she promptly agreed take off check but upon further probing she advised standard set upper management first offer 20% off when there's problem   absurd!!   I also ordered mango mocha received 1 strawberry 1 mango  Someone server brought told ordered mango didn't know why received strawberry she nonchalant she couldn't cared less   kind experience  service ice cold when mess something don't care  definitely going find different sushi place because worth sacrificing decent service good sushi  just can't back there  service just terrible  <EOR> Love place AYCE sushi cheaper la carte  Rarely ever disappointed except time sat table closest restroom think having plumbing problems night since then fixed problem  only thing part then AYCE hamachi collar  boo! yet try ramen 11pm  Favorites  braised grilled pork belly atama fried shrimp head super white tuna nigiri salmon skin roll Cajun albacore ikura quail egg salmon nigiri list on! <EOR> SO     INCREDIBLY     FULL    Got AYCE spectacular  ton specialty rolls TWO PAGES FACT all descriptions menu pictures each separate laminated menu  All rolls looked absolutely delicious lucky try many them  perfect seat bar right next sushi chef food came quickly able everything exactly way want it    I highly recommend ecstasy roll sweet shrimp unagi volcano roll  skimp quality rolls even if AYCE  rolls big fill real quickly if pace yourself  many choices come being prepared choose decisively your food sooner   Their desserts also pretty bomb well  talked chef he told only lychee gelato around  ordered green tea brulee  Both desserts incredible but especially loved green tea brulee  wasn't overly sweet loved green tea flavor crispiness top    It great meal I'd come again if area! <EOR> The best all you can eat sushi bar Las Vegas!

Yup certainly be   You see some very very real consequences associated actually arriving outer limits one's ayce threshold    One mine having rolled places  The other trying waddle around stomach into hyper drive desperately breaks down mass quantities proteins starched sugars etc    And yet       times places when totally acceptable find yours truly awkward predicaments    And guess what?  Sushi House Goyemon happens them places  Surprise! Well shouldn't could actually kinda insulted used such cliche  Anyways   Now did find 60 minute time limit somewhat perplexing? Yup but challenge   they're charging consider fair compromise   Did mistake ordering way much shrimp tempura instead purely focusing all things sushi? Yes regrettable did but foolishly next time   But real question sushi? All things being considered half bad  And food overall fairly tasty ayce   The serving size nigiri often wondering if inadvertently ordered amuse bouche section menu but thing morsel size portions works   enough taste decide if want more if don't you're stuck slab something don't want   Unfortunately none sushi super standout but Goyemon's defense many servings and sake taste buds become less acute can't really distinguish good really good   being said would recommend ordering half size specialty rolls ask if could them into specialty hand rolls instead   really fan hand rolls since seems better balance seaweed rice fish when rolled ice cream cone   And if still any room and even if don't try dessert  For love ayce try dessert   Well worth it  <EOR> The quality nigiri great   +1 chefs   However customer service HORRIBLE every single time here   friend both work food beverage department understand through   provide hospitality servers hoping they'll reciprocate same gesture us   lol    Our waitress monotonous lethargic inattentive forgetful items   She didn't greet smile once seated   I'd say more but sure point here  only six tables seated night took roughly 25 35 minutes server help us   Please take notes Timothy other server working because he knows properly job   The management needs better judgement when hiring servers  <EOR> My cousin recommended place glad he recommended cuz new fav  AYCE! There tons sushi pick also some special sushi every night which didn't know first time went  But second time seawater eel toro fatty tuna both them awesome! The sweet shrimp my personal fav taste really good  other sushi fresh taste delicious  After sushi dessert green tea creme brulee tempura ice cream delicious   My only complain waiting time  recommend order everything think first time hungry long time if order little every time server comes over  Also early waited 40 mins first time hr second time before seating  Other place great should seriously try out  <EOR> A bit pricey but other very high quality  Let off hook bit leftovers  Also caught sushi chefs handling cash gloves which thought he would take off before handling sushi again but wrong he kept gloves on  <EOR> The hubs major sushi lovers tried almost every sushi spot valley least once  being said Goyemon used favorite spots because nigiri perfect size desserts side dishes amazing here  past visit husband agreed would probably most likely last least while  rice hard which major disappointment because am majority nigiri person eat lot rice  fish also just didn't taste fresh seemed cut back generosity sauce poured over white tuna garlic tuna nigiri  rolls just okay  salmon skin hand roll ordered tasted burnt  pay extra share your child even if he's only little over years old  service lacking despite fact busy during time there  Lychee sorbet never disappoints! AYCE desserts also plus  sure if just because came right when opened opening crew servers sushi chefs aren't best but definitely missed mark past visit  <EOR> After first round ordering some stuffs party six us  ready order again then Asian male server asked quote guys sure finish all that?     *moment silence*     kidding me? Im trying mean but kind server ask question AYCE restaurant  Shithead  used server no empathy him  Totally ruined appetite experience place  came 10 waiting till 11PM just try ramen  10 minute ramen female host asked leave sit long according them  WTF? hope your business run well kind attitude  Never come back even might best AYCE town  <EOR> A new favorit spot mine all eat well! food awesome! service also good  group favorite grilled pork belly  Thats hands down awesome along mahalo roll! choke parking its hard find  might find yourself waiting usually wait due its small size but totally worth it  also sectioned off area bigger parties sure reserve someone little early resere tables  <EOR> This best kept secret Las Vegas  plenty all eat sushi places but best easiest town  plenty choices half orders available  open late show crowds  best tip eat bar chefs explain sushi great suggestions cannot tables  <EOR> Sushi Goyemon great place visit if want your late night sushi fix on! While seems best known all eat sushi lot more offer learned during visit    We decided against all eat $26 option since none hungry because only hour  eat pretty slowly doubted I'd able money's worth particularly seeing rolls reasonably priced average $9 $10    I crispy tempura shrimp teriyaki chicken tempura fried roll salmon cream cheese called Taylor Roll   roll nice flavorful reminded Vegas Roll other places   I also stole couple pieces friend's salmon salmon roll which just delicious  salmon bright pink wonderfully fatty soft smooth    The crispy tempura shrimp perfect light crisp batter outside sizeable plump juicy shrimp within  included dipping sauce also great    Overall all enjoyed meals each less $20 which incredible considering much food had   wanted room tempura fried ice cream but just couldn't it  Next time sure! <EOR> Best All eat Vegas!

The AYCE offered many choices overwhelmed options especially since stomachs eating themselves time  decided take slow order some rolls nigiri first  Some friends miso soup some gyoza  first orders came fairly quickly deliciousness meal overtook decided all out  ordered enough feed family 20    Some notable dishes white tuna cajun albacore seared salmon  also love unagi eel place did disappoint  think best things goyemon order HALF ORDERS  What!? Don't want full 8 piece roll? half order! No more leftover sushi shove down end  sure if other sushi places did but when waitress offered knew Goyemon cared efficiency possibly its customers' waistline    The service great  Although busy waitress always around waters always refilled  did wait 40 min per order some other sushi places  All all great experience AYCE sushi honestly say haven't many good AYCE experiences    TL DR long wait but TOTALLY WORTH IT  Half rolls galore! <EOR> I invited eat several co workers all which Japanese   first asked if eaten Goyemon prior visit which confirmed multiple times   first indication place wouldn't shabby   We arrived modestly decorated space fifteen minute wait six people 1AM Friday night   interior mood lighting gorgeous clean bathroom overall generic but pleasant decor     To good sampling restaurant offered decided spend 26 95 AYCE which isn't just sushi but included all kitchen food entrees dessert   way if sushi mediocre could pig entrees kitchen food     Thankfully case sushi pretty good   ended eating lot Americanized rolls which whole generally don't care but every once while end finding roll ton goobledegook enjoying it   sushi light distinctly smooth taste it   place worked me   two orders shumai steamed fried gyoza eight half orders sushi 1 2 order ramen Green Tea Cake latter which favorite part meal   yes read prior part right half orders sushi which loved since gave ability variety sushi rather stuck roll so so your ranking     In terms sushi Sexy Girl Cynthia Dragon all stood me     The only thing really didn't care service   started off fantastic   Speedy tons refills iced green tea   then towards end waiting waiting waiting refill water   staff pleasant food good very good AYCE  <EOR> If you're AYCE kind person then yes place you  load extensive menu nigiri tempura rolls dessert etc  totally satisfied   I myself am more purist  want best best wasn't all impressed  eating cut rate sushi place when really dreaming Nobu Sushi Samba   But really less $50 all sushi want complain?   I enjoyed 911 roll which boasted habanero sauce but totally failed deliver I take LOT heat take grain salt    actually ask hotter roll  chefs tried roll supposedly much hotter but barely registered tasted buds  fair raised habaneros whole life perception may skewed    The tempura delicious really all rolls ordered  fun look vast menu find something found interesting order it  If want explore all aspects sushi good place start    The service step above perfection  don't wait ask anything    This place definitely casual go to spot hang try good sushi relax  Definitely recommend  <EOR> The lunch special well worth trying place out  half hour into lunch time place packed  2 roll lunch special CA rolls comes house salad miso soup  delicious full only spent $8 50  wait quick staff very nice <EOR> I would leave no star overall experience   Cons Emptied dishes never picked table even table covered emptied dishes  Staffs unfriendly completely ignore customers  walk away even see waving your hands request  Foods take more 20mins even business slow  Mochi ice creams take 40mins arrive including time request desserts twice   Pros dishes served very decent good portion   Lastly personally refer buffet restaurant any friends  own customer service oriented business north Cali  seriously concern quality business if boss place when know staffs ruining reputation business     I hope owner business take advice observe quality your staffs  Thanks  <EOR> I getting cabin fever Mandalay Bay!

There's such thing called hungry eyes don't mean Patrick Swayze Dirty Dancing eyes satisfied let alone royal palette start off warming stomach usual orders nigiri fresh water eel salmon Cajun albacore seaweed salad green mussels! preliminary order satisfactory flavor but did notice put very little rice! liked part! noticed friends very happy service took toll experience    I believe restaurant MUST understand treat serve patrons well FIRST then deliver high quality food products! However service seemed bottom priorities least was   If friends aren't happy happy  when happy 2 stars! 1 being open during lunch 2 having AYCE sushi during lunch $21 95  sushi subpar appetizers decent but wow atmosphere welcoming friendly others Valley  cool sword men's restroom though! probably end coming more time because love AYCE sushi but leaning more towards avoiding place  next next one! <EOR> Goyemon become favorite Sushi place  drive 20 minutes Henderson regal all eat buffet  busy place expect wait table during dinner hours but worth it  order glass wine while wait   the sushi sizes generous endless possibilities nice challenge try them all! Sushi really fresh well cut portions generous service prompt  come 8 people service good fast  favorites hand rolled Unagi Salmon Skin  <EOR> So everyone know RAVES Goyemon  Whenever someone asks best sushi always mentioned  came realize place same menu Sushi Mon  all rolls taste same  If LOVE Goyemon then should LOVE Sushi Mon amirite? wonder if same owners?  I met friend Jessie lunch 1 21 16 around 12 30  busy but packed usually around lunch time  did take while receive food though  mildly annoying because only hour lunch but time able try decent amount items garlic edamame super white tuna scallops garlic tuna lemon roll lasagna roll domingo roll  The garlic edamame really good  doesn't diced garlic but rather subtle garlic flavoring top all beans  super white tuna melt mouth delicious always favorite nigiri items  also try scallops garlic tuna Jessie both very good    The rolls next  already love domingo lasagna rolls knew expect delicious  But lemon roll definitely new favorite! just california roll lemon top but light refreshing  ordered 2 but only 1 due time constraints  AYCE also includes dessert but didn't time either  AYCE lunch reasonably priced $21 95  <EOR> Goyemon still favorite AYCE sushi restaurant town  specials better better each time come AYCE dessert icing cake  wait really long most nights made point beginning dinner shift decrease chance long wait  <EOR> Not impressed  paid full dinner price but no uni no Toro just typical Nigiri sushi plates  <EOR> First thing note wait food ridiculous  sushi appetizers did arrive until 40 mins ordered  dining room packed but wait still unacceptable long time   With food nigiri pretty fresh special rolls good  sure if worth price though simply because huge wait before getting any food  Also order lot food time dishes come staggered random times  may full before using all eat option fullest   Another gripe requirement finish all food comes face penalty  amount rice overwhelming price customers should option just sashimi if want   Last negative comment I promise dessert menu pretty lacking options portions small order lot those suckers  <EOR> Goyemon best quality fish any AYCE sushi thus far  sets them above everyone also rice fish ratio which prefer very small  ordered ton menu items but some stood were Salmon Belly Basically salmon another level  If love salmon love extra quality fish    Super White Tuna fresh right amount sauce seasoning  Could only whole meal satisfied!

Reasonably priced because let's face eat 2 rolls you've essentially eaten enough call good  But why stop there??  variety excellent those places where all eat menu limited certain rolls EVERYTHING menu included  Apps sides rolls sashimi dessert! Wear your fat pants you're going need them!  Most pieces smaller you'd receive traditional sushi place but good number reasons  a helps able try more items menu without filling quickly b always order more c HALF orders!!    It required eat everything    no pile left overs put it     easy first  If catch leaving much you'll paying la carte  however roll husband ordered he didn't care gladly took back!  Super nice super yummy    Also sure other yelpers talking lack fresh fish      everything really fresh!  Try lemon roll! super yummy!! <EOR> The food good but service terrible  Every time come mess order wait over hour pickup order  say they're busy but they're always busy hire more help  <EOR> The best thing pork belly  Wasn't impressed rolls baked mussels dessert menu   love sushi Kaya way more  <EOR> Goyemon always hits spot   bite size pieces sushi just perfect much fish I hate when piece big warms mouth much rice I hate AYCE places trying fill guests rice!

Aside sushi also soup appetizers even dessert included AYCE price  eat many pieces mochi ice cream want?!   The fish relatively fresh best part don't give huge portion rice way enjoy good stuff  offer uni amaebi well but unfortunately those limited order per person 2 pieces which understandable    Highlight night 911 roll  essentially roll crazy spicy sauce  spice good but killed any taste fish  Spicy rice was  Don't try warned you   Service great  checked often tea refilled  Worth hour wait? still deciding but waiting long definitely worked appetite  <EOR> Ok if decide eat here   be very hungry expect long wait  BUT worth it!   As rolls   I don't know recommend order  Everything good  Nigiris fresh! may better off eating ordering fresh fish rather those fatty baked deep friend rolls    Pros half orders unlimited desserts  Cons Long wait good groups it'll longer wait Must AYCE Sushi Industrial Area  <EOR> This place ok  solid sushi place  Nothing blew mind but nothing gross  looks clean waiter wasn't very outgoing extra nice talkative really all lol but she wasn't rude she kept refills  am completely stuffed wish could give 3 half stars  I'd come again  Unfortunately Sakana favorite sushi place but dirty dining which broke trust can't anymore  But place better Yama  satisfied good  probably come back  <EOR> Had when first started business pretty good but haven't while now  Today just totally disappointing  sat down ordered bunch dishes nigiri  told ran uni  ok fine we'll two orders sweet shrimp instead uni + swt shrimp then? no can't that  What??  They constantly mess order bring things didn't order totally forgot orders  more importantly put MUCH RICE EVERY NIGIRI!!! fish slice thin sheesh might well eat bowl rice  See pictures reference amount rice per fish ratio  today's experience conclude come back agin  <EOR> We regulars   my wife would come maybe twice month   there's usually more grilled items dinner lunch  <EOR> Our favorite place Sushi  Its always packed especially night  first time 130 am wait 15 minutes seated  always come quick sushi dinner stop full buffet  Its small place  fancy but always hit spot  dinner specials $10 best deal  sexy girl rock roll favorites  <EOR> Even though some negative reviews but husband wanted Japanese food still decided give try Friday night   We arrived 6 40pm no need wait  think because came January which peak season lucky all wanted food quality wonderful   sweet shrimp uni limited order per person  Very fresh!

Sounds fishy o O  I dislike buffets greatly because quality food usually very low force yourself eat much paid if more  Nor gross overstuffed ill explode feeling after  Before coming confess didn't texture raw fish even thought eating something raw  O_O  Last January attended CES 2012 Vegas  friend hadn't eaten all day decided head off Strip late late 3pm lunch  friend crazy sashimi uni durian lover wanted sushi  remember co worker mentioned much she loved place  bit skeptical first  Sushi Vegas? Really? Sounds fishy me!  AYCE lunch buffet under $25? steal! whole time friend only ordered nigiri! haha really wanted sure money's worth! point server said know offer other items specialty rolls side dishes! P each bite nigiri appreciation raw fish greatly increased  All nigiri ordered very fresh delicious! first time trying other fishes besides salmon    fishes hadn't even heard of  Tai? Hamachi? Hotate? Saba? Hirame? Unfortunately couldn't order amaebi sweet shrimp uni sea urchin because wasn't dinner time yet Boooo    next time though!  Can believe still room dessert?

Bluefin's better  * Orgasm Salad  I'd take hundred screaming O's over any day  Boo  Weird medley assorted fish chunks doused puddle ginger sesame dressing few wilted greens doesn't bring orgasm mind all unless mean wet spot bed nobody wants sleep on     * Masago Quail egg I'd asked Ikura but chef assured usually made masago  Didn't float boat sink submarine     The interior nice lots warm wooden tones throughout low hanging lamps   The service could spotty  confusion over actually taking appetizer drink orders lot shouting back forth sushi bar servers    I'd rate 3 half star place  food isn't awful service wasn't consistently bad just didn't blow water  tempted 4 star but figured rounding down help counter ebulliently high prior ratings   I'm willing give them another chance try some specialty rolls but bit way didn't want dance belly joy end meal  <EOR> The best thing place stays open late  Definitely wasn't good experience good reminder stay away All Eat sushi restaurants  Quality service very poor  <EOR> Recommended Vegas Local AYCE sushi place best had  Though bit more expensive use buffet $26 person sushi tasted fresh    limit not sure if limit 1 2 don't remember Uni Nigiri sushi Sweet Shrimp   did charge extra requesting Quail egg top Masago Tobiko Sushi  <EOR> So last time came large group expected long wait  Tonight came group 4 including me  told wait half hour  ended waiting 1 hour cold    Because no room inside  very annoyed!

MikeB <EOR> My family based sister's recommendation all you can eat sushi lunch  $21 95 per adult thought reasonable price   One great things sushi place most likely won't waste food  Why? Because if order something don't eat end meal charge don't eat  smart business customers only order eat   We ordered ate lot between four us  basically everything menu  Tip careful when ordering  believe ordered four thing thought would four pieces but each thing three pieces ended twelve pieces sushi   Everything ordered made fresh think started taking time getting later orders because may relatively eating much  sushi more fresh enough considering you're middle desert   And when came time desserts which also included meal shared some mochi ice cream matcha green tea ice cream   In end all four stuffed single piece rice left plates  Recommended  <EOR> Sushi House Goyemon BEST All You Can Eat AYCE sushi place wife EVER TO  miss much now living Bay Area   We used live 10 minutes away Goyemon used once every couple weeks lunch $21 95 person dinner $26 95 dinner   some advantages going dinner 1 serve salmon belly nigiri which way better getting regular salmon nigiri 2 1 order uni sea urchin 1 order amaebi sweet shrimp 3 order ramen 11  Other three things pretty much order everything else including AYCE dessert during lunch   Our typical order when dinner includes following items 1 nigiri salmon belly hamachi yellowtail saba mackerel super white tuna uni sea urchin amaebi sweet shrimp snow crab meat unagi fresh water eel ikura salmon roe 2 rolls Sexy Girl Hurricane Sushi Mon Style Lasagna 3 side dishes steamed gyoza yakitori shrimp vegetable tempura sashimi salad miso soup baked green mussels udon ramen 11pm 4 grilled dishes grilled pork belly grilled super white tuna grilled cajun salmon 5 dessert lychee sorbet green ice cream strawberry mochi green tea creme brûlée  That order listed above might sound lot but trust worth it  try items  reason why kept coming back week week why first place want eat when visit Las Vegas  also why easiest 5 star ratings give Yelp  only complaint place wait very very long  restaurant all big if group bigger 4 take 1 2 hours seated  couple other restaurants owned same group other 2 restaurants called Sushi Mon    both just good soon reviewed well    If ever Las Vegas and still reading review promise you'll Goyemon Sushi Mon  Ok? Cool thanks! <EOR> This place officially taken Number 1 spot Top AYCE sushi restaurants  congrats Goyemon!  After reading reviews knew wait inevitable  place small! Very small space  Which explains wait time  35 minute wait but grab your number text when your table ready  text even says if need few minutes reply back they'll wait 2 minutes  don't wonder far   Automatically when sit down someone takes order  must know wait made extremely famished!

Thinly sliced   I would recommend anyone Vegas  <EOR> My expectations through roof but barely off ground   I don't know man must've bad night  MUST HAVE! hard imagine why Friday night such highly acclaimed venue would any bad nights but give them benefit doubt  down second shot place but first overall experience very very mediocre   The rice fish ratio just ugh   bad  No bueno  Yelling mercy  fourth sushi nothing could taste except rice  rice itself thin almost jasmine rice  Chinese food?? If rice least bit fuller texture wouldn't complain  also tell rice packed differently  sits small clump its hard break down when you're chewing it  very laborious completely takes away experience fish  No don't hide rice  eat them whole fish  Last night really wish didn't  Now think think did leave few rice clumps under dish  Hmm never problem Xtreme Sushi     The service nothing exceptional  waitress barely made any eye contact table slow take orders  wasn't bad but expected least par other venues  mean place even full waitress hard find rare pokemon Pikachu Viridian Forest anyone?   never issue Xtreme Sushi     The fish OK  say yellowtail favorite  glad yellowtail did disappoint  shrimp other hand good  Everything else mediocre  decide give last shot order uni sea urchin   really gauge quality restaurant eating sea urchin  Sea urchin spoils quicker other fish really easy spot bad sea urchin dull color foul smell  Would Goyemon pass sea urchin fish test? Hmm   The anticipation  Man killing me  wave down waitress put order   GULP!  Well wouldn't know until next time because out  What?!? kidding me   Although Xtreme Sushi limit 1 order per person would rather eat uni none all   So pretty much sums whole night  return Goyemon better experience? Movie sequels rarely ever better first unless Goyemon Terminator mediocre first EPIC second  Hmm we'll see     *Hint hint Xtreme Sushi Southern Highlands still best * <EOR> The wait time worth it   If wait long then should expect your food come fast no freshness certain time because all your food coma once no time pace yourself  strategy suppose eat fast full fast leave new customer  Repeat   Will returning unfortunately  <EOR> It really long time since but still remember yummy Frying Jason was! never baked rolls before quite amazed first bite  am jealous people live LV enjoy many buffets good quality good price  would travel Vegas again just food lol  Drop star because service  rushed waitress impatient rude  <EOR> Small place but good service food!  think only counted 10 tables plus bar   came myself sat bar did opt AYCE   would def come back myself but looks wait forever table   Which good sign food suppose  <EOR> Our first time eat lunch over but earing dinner here  don't service server PARAWI  she's down what  If you're feeling down sick yired even mood  Then don't work! think people morning person  expect good tip?!

San Francisco plenty Japanese restaurants  If really know sushi should taste u don't want eat here   service excellent but food terrible  <EOR> Recently ate AYCE  first timer reading all wonderful yelp reviews definitely thought treat  WRONG! Horrible service ever!!! server Gio obnoxiously rude  Food decent dessert good but never coming again because service ruined overall experience!! <EOR> Not sure happened chefs knew but lunch disappointing  toll didn't even ingredients listed inside which odd  Also tossed some roe top instead roll entire thing then put sauce    At least now know where eat sushi  <EOR> Really bad experience attitude waitress bad ask food there  No smile cold face! time limit but gonna wait long time your order  waitress told nothing left charged  Anyway uncomfortable dinner there! Always worried time waiting order  Cold face waitress i won't come back  <EOR> Long wait Las Vegas expected  If you're buddy chef staff then cut front everyone waited hours  Fairness ? here  <EOR> Fish portions seem getting smaller smaller every time come but good thing fish still fresh servers nice stamp card!!!! really good desserts order half rolls <EOR> AYCE sushi am big fan  AYCE  Sushi tried all AYCE Vegas       I high hopes place friends rave but its okay      Pros Kool little sushi place atmophere kool alot young people good service staff rolls good       The bad no japanese staff which may indicate lack authentic sushi nigiri cut weird unprofessional way fish always fresh wasibi always fresh ginger always fresh      freshness problem  If fix above place could 4 5 star      Fish freshness problem      There miso sucks     there rolls good      Kaya still king until try Umiya     but thats saying much   I'm thinking switiching back just eating sushi vs AYCE    <EOR> I place Sushi  gets pretty packed but wait system send text your phone when table ready  <EOR> SERVICE SLOW!!!!!!!!! VERY SLOW!!!!!!!!While order server slowly walking away okay??? Then took them 10 15mins take order  No even asked if need anything else even though table completely empty water! shouldve stick other sushi places  going back here! Oh everyone look sad af!! smile couldve helped understand horrible service even though its even busy!! think busser guy only person doing great job!! Also PLEASE use GLOVES when handling food NOT talking sushi chefs touch your face then touch food thats ready serve customer!! <EOR> I'm torn   sushi really good AYCE  pretty impressive   don't expect good quality AYCE   However service largely hostess service HORRIFIC only ones saying based other reviews hearing other customers waiting same time us     There queue give name table hostess running around answering phone doing everything BUT take names   easily waited 5 10 min just put name down and only 1 party ahead us    also few empty tables easily sat empty good 20 30 minutes before parties sat them   Part allow parties seated even if rest party there   place busy should allow this  I appreciate take your phone number down call when table ready   When seen other restaurants usually call when table paying allows 10 minutes back   does sense call table cleaned setup because then sits empty   Furthermore should allow tables sat if whole party avoids idle time where people eating restaurant making money   saw many parties actually leave bother waiting frustrated us  IN end did wait food great came fast!  Still unsure if would come back  <EOR> You would think should physically emotionally prepared gastrointestinal armageddon when presented all eat sushi middle desert but so!  Heck place beats socks off some sushi places San Francisco but digress     Overall sashimi pretty good quality all things considered   even uni amaebi 1 order per person didn't suck!  Some rolls nigiri somewhat sloppily prepared but then again Las Vegas Japan right?  also great also grilled pork belly other dishes menu AYCE just sushi    Service great waitress attentive very friendly and even encouraging order more    Reservations definitely needed larger parties but I'd reservation anyways sure take full advantage diamond Las Vegas rough!! <EOR> as far sushi place 4 stars imo  however gave extra star freshiness snow crab scallop unlimited green tea ice cream if still room is  also pro tip those dine friends sure keep track each person ordered else things may disappear front without even realizing it  service decent never seen ayce place without order sheet  quiet strange imo <EOR> Wouldn't feed cat  Food poisioning waiting happen  Nice place friendly staff  Started meal some nigri  tuna warm mushy  enough  Left bite  <EOR> The food does disappoint! Just sure come early if don't want wait  3 girls total including wait time hour! busy night expect tight squeezed restaurant  bad thing anything   Overall food great came FAST ! sat sushi bar sushi man taking sushi orders came faster thought  only reason why didn't give restaurant 5 stars because some side orders didn't come until later  assuming forgot it  example when pretty much finished all food brought steam dumplings but steam dumplings room temp cold already   NOTE If doing all eat give bill until everything finished off your plate  least  happened when asked bill when almost done eating  sat corner restaurant servers didn't check much didn't feel waiting them bill  Hence why asked bill  <EOR> I only Sushi House Goyemon all eat but fantastic!  am usually skeptical all eat sushi since often times quality selection suffer   absolutely case Goyemon   Their nigiri menu typical selections but huge number very inventive tasty rolls   version 911 roll spiciest anywhere since add habanero pepper well typical chili sauce   Another pleasant surprise all eat menu items available grill   grilled yellowtail pork belly both very tasty   The service always good multiple servers handling each table which much quicker large group doing AYCE   I try show before 6 since busy dinner even weeknights  <EOR> Out all sushi place town place takes cake  Although bit drive comparison local favorite kaizen fish die for  Mouthwatering fresh overall incredible  Can't wait come back! <EOR> LuV LuV LuV sushi bar!

Love open late night daily specials  also great don't give abundance rice small cuts fish  Seemed most rolls amazing and let half orders AYCE sample more! Must try Salon Belly buttery goodness! Grilled pork belly delicious fatty goodness Yuzu Sorbet tangy refreshing goodness  I highly recommend sitting bar possible you'll your nigiri rolls much quicker  <EOR> Just your average AYCE sushi place  place clean staff friendly  only thing though sometimes service spotty server forgets your order couple rolls once   The specialty rolls pretty average most places around town did notice most rolls generally favored being made cucumber it  Most specialty rolls tend towards ones avacado though cucumber made rolls pretty good  place average all around most part terms price food little better average service all around but where place excels fact its open late every night week til 3! If could give 3 half stars would but cant 3 is  Still great little spot late night grub  come back again! <EOR> Best AYCE sushi buffet!!! The wait long because restaurant very small  I think capacity seats only 60 people if saw correctly   But being small allows staff more attentive which great!  The wait around 90 minutes but worth wait   Also awesome system allows track your standing   It's different other AYCE buffets   servers still come take your order all stuff your faces lol     The quality food awesome  Everything menu fresh enjoyable  Some ones enjoyed most fresh salmon nigiris shrimp tempera eel 911 something ruby roll   sure half 4pieces orders try many can    Seriously think stuffed point felt sick    which don't recommend but definitely worth visit   probably place vegas!

I can't  believe haven't sooner especially because live relatively close by  Tuesday evening around 5p did wait  Friends told they've wait 45 min hour table  sense because very minimal seating    On food     this best AYCE places Vegas opinion  Between appetizers unique rolls numerous desserts something everyone  quality great even order sashimi which always case AYCE  highly recommend grilled pork belly  just melts your mouth  Yum yum yum! Every roll delicious fresh  Also let order more dessert which all AYCE places do    The service great! ignored plenty AYCE places rolls forgotten  Maybe because minimal seating servers sushi chefs don't seem running around crazy people other AYCE places  <EOR> This third time done AYCE sushi very very good   Tremendous selection nigiri sushi some specials board good     I sat sushi bar almost immediately Freda sushi chefs started ask questions suggest things   ordered first three nigiri selections then he made some recommendations there   Throughout dinner he very helpful very pleasant!  Here's list had   All nigiri except where noted Garlic tuna Hamachi Octopus Conch Cajun tuna Masago jalapeño forgot quail egg Paolo but remember next time  Crab snow meat Sweet shrimp  Salmon belly Spicy shrimp Scallop yum yum hand rolls Cold tofu 3 condiments Grilled salmon grilled white tuna Green tea crème brulée Green tea cake Chocolate mousse Tempura ice cream  Chef Freda saw much enjoyed grilled white tuna he made sushi version nigiri style   Service great   felt very comfortable first time started learn more order look for   also took suggestions several times especially when he recommended heads removed sweet shrimp nigiri then eaten soup make   shrimp heads soup superb! <EOR> The service good but food great!  Sushi fresh green tea flan delicious! <EOR> Wow last visit Goyemon made double take  wondered if wandered into wrong restaurant    Although still many items part AYCE menu items such kama no longer available  grill items specials available seemed hastily thrown together because cook busy chatting other co workers   That brings biggest change service! Service terrible especially sushi bar  would order amaebi ebi instead  Ordering ikura resulted masago  sushi chefs seemed more interested telling jokes each other getting orders correct  Worst all waitstaff  If sit sushi bar waitstaff doesn't seem give $h!t instead focusing attention tables  waitress responsible section left break basically own  Waiters waitresses would walk eye contact keep moving  Nearly fell asleep waiting check!

When wife pointed available visibly written specials wall reluctantly told they'll serve item only because left board she promptly erases off menu prove point but then later quietly reinstates it  Why???   Secondly everything took forever its place understaffed brimming people  even took 15 minutes anyone take payment ffs  advice manager running place check your staff could ruin everyone people choices Las Vegas  <EOR> Location 5 5 Close freeway off Tropicana Decatur  Easy easy find parking   Food 5 5 Been multiple times sushi always amazing  Very fresh  opinion its best sushi spot Vegas   Service 5 5 Always quick point  Orders taken quickly drinks refilled food gets brought quick   Ambiance 5 5 Casual very noisy  Very comfortable environment    Extra definitely coming back again many times  <EOR> I usually come when AYCE dates friends 6+ people   wait usually long during busy hours weekends  Despite having table reserved all members your party must present actually start sitting your table  But once eat no tomorrow lol!

Im just glad didn't push time limit disclaimer  Food great just step service please  <EOR> I love place  eat sushi every Sunday choose goyemon every time  think everyone gives place 3 star because service but good service all time  don't expect servers smile but very accommodating making sure orders  remember knows order kids  fish always fresh don't wait long  If anyone chooses sushi 21 over goyemon because there's no wait because dirty dining  die hard Goyemon goer  <EOR> This Holly Grail Sushi Las Vegas   First quality Fish  Exceptionally Fresh  give generous portion fish just little rice if come enjoy fish won't try spoil experience filling Rice   My wife favors cooked food said cooked food better two previous places no arguement making number place go    Sitting Sushi Bar enjoyable experience  Chefs interact try give anticipate always making good reccomendations  When tell them Chef's choice next call something never tried am disappointed    The help servers always making rounds anticipating your needs  Even sitting table crowded place never send signal flare track down server  Food service prompt orders always right    It priced going rate town $26 95 think very good value    A minor thing All help English Speaking good balanced mix both men women  Sounds minor point but helps assure your order right gir wasn't just hired looks thus may flirting group guys while wait service    Why Five Star? Because if 5 pm wait usually 30 minutes  nice busy because want see them continually succeed but kind bummer waiting long sit down    As date new home Sushi   friend Clint you're jumping band wagon just being smart your review justified  <EOR> Okay waited few days before started typing really give thought come objectively possible     First all no egg rolls    Says menu but don't carry them     however  main problem place      It's owned SushiMon which absolute terrible sushi restaurant Henderson terrible fact new name entirely new website far away name sushi sushimon messes       The major problem them extremely unorganized show any kind professionalism which why swore would never eat again     However Goyemon suckered made eat SushiMon Product    which kind made mad pretty darn disappointing being presented asked if any other restaurants area  when bomb dropped me   As far pictures website sure if hired food artist but those pictures portray versus night day would rather eaten food during night    PITCH BLACK DARKNESS didn't look absolutely no visual appeal but tasted okay since starving just finished watching drifting motor speedway OK back track   hah!

This first visit but follow few people YouTube place heard good things it  restaurant sits very quiet strip mall well least 9 00pm quiet  Hostess pleasant sat but when told all probably going AYCE she only gives 2 AYCE menus request more  She never came back w them asked server  He never came back w them  asked busser finally! Someone understands 7 people shouldn't sharing 2 freaking menus!  Our waiter took time taking drink orders even more time getting them us  Even longer take orders which bit frustrating considering place hour restriction AYCE! Needless say  service sucked   On eats  mediocre best  sorry but if can't garlic tuna right  WTF wrong you?! fav easiest f ing thing make  First off didn't taste any garlic more lemon tuna  then ordered cut roll more rice sushi    Goyemon understand you're small establishment want good turnover tables but if your servers suck take time orders stand around talking other staff members majority shift as did night came in then lift hr limit bc your price point rec'd quite upsetting    Ok bye  <EOR> literally nothing bad say goyemon  even sometimes 45 minute long wait 100% worth fantastic food service place dishes out    it plain see much thought care into every dish goyemon basic $2 house salad always fresh garden medley delicious home made house dressing $27 all you can eat menu  never bad food goyemon   my roommate strict vegetarian very picky when comes sushi but he also fallen love avocado cucumber rolls  everyone brought loved just much do    you know sushi restaurant good when full japanese people    goyemon always packed asians i hope no takes offense but think awesome     i highly recommend shooting star roll no longer menu but always green tea creme brulee    both die for! <EOR> The place usually busy cool   think Sushi Chefs rush much some sushi awfully put together but  okay am eating mouth eyes   bored place probably because certain restrictions order regards meat section but  okay right across street where live   staff attentive try interact staff   If looking just eat right place if looking creativity move along   price fair charge dishes would like it! <EOR> I just finished review eating but then  While eating desert already took payment soon happened service down hill  No paying attention anymore tried order more because done eating yet but no really paying attention us  took them another 20 min just bring Green tea ice cream  Which reality long does really take green tea ice cream  unless actually themselves  But other deserts came less min  normally pretty good but time little embarrassed because brought friends telling them pretty good place  <EOR> Not only place literally across street its great place sushi! many sushi entrées before thought would try something different     teriyaki chicken dinner chicken salad rice tempera potato salad miso soup cali roll all under $10  tempera sauce favorite! also love salad dressing great flavor  only downside need more servers goodness sake all white meat chicken option!

I called 1 37am sure last call still 2 30am   Woman answered said yes last call 2 30am  arrived 1 50am party 1 hostess manager says wait seated she can't guarantee seated time able meet 2am last call All Eat sushi!  Wtf!  drove all way tell that!!!?  She couldn't even explain phone      Ridiculous! <EOR> probably best sushi all eat buffet but gave estimated wait time 2 hours   Ridiculous  <EOR> Recently revisited place quality drastically changed worse    sitting sushi bar also encountered cross contamination different fish tamago egg being saved next day    <EOR> Came 7 hrs ago still full!! AYCE lunch until 4pm $21 per person worth it!! only downside 45 min limit but plenty time stuffed  If fairly small party we came four people highly recommend sitting bar  your food lot faster eat more =P if nice sushi chef Gian he recommend different things try!   We yellowtail salmon halibut eel some rolls well  First all rolls usually come 8 pieces per order but most them request half orders  nice because saves room try variety rather just few  also crunchy hand roll but pretty much customize however want just ask nigiri ordered fish very good quality give reasonable amount rice  favorite yellowtail probably 10 pieces myself if more! Halibut also good chef's recommendation wouldn't gotten other wise  also good selection sides order  calamari gyoza miso soup seaweed salad many more point  enjoyed all sides tried except maybe edamame  liked hot but buttery liking  Moving desserts   omg all eat dessert too???? mochi ice cream tempura ice cream 3 scoops red bean lychee green tea ice cream  Needless say all stuffed!!!!  This place worth every penny definitely back again! Unfortunately busy stuffing face didn't take any pictures =\ meh oh well  Until next time! =D <EOR> If followed previous reviews closely known MON group powerhouse japanese restaurants Las Vegas  another brainchild  place All you can eat Japanese buffet restaurant  however order off menu ala carte but never seen anybody actually that    First off understand place DOES take reservations strictly first come first serve basis  Secondly understand very limited seating  most 50 70 people would overestimate could observe   Thirdly understand all your sushi dishes prepared spot you  Basically place your order waitress sushi chef prepare your sushi spot you  small kitchen fourthly understand your food might take while arrive your table    The food however best value money sushi restaurants town   Each individual sushi probably half size would normally see outside take note although size sushi does determine its quality  Every single sushi prepared freshness ingredients sushi rice everything high quality  quality sushi definitely beats those found international buffets Caesars Palace Wynn    The choice raw fish extensive all common sushi find most sushi joints states salmon tuna albacore white tuna octopus scallops sweet shrimps even Uni sea urchin   number special rolls off charts  many different types choose from  Even desserts tempura ice cream found here   Why spend 50 dollars person regular sushi joint if hardcore sushi lover when spend half eating your hearts content place?  Just come earlier empty stomach leave happy satisfied person  <EOR> Came all eat sushi lunch   decent selection fish ice creams really good   difficult try lot dishes though since eat all rice raw fish    If tired eating typical Las Vegas buffet good place try  <EOR> With many delicious restaurants Strip usually don't take initiative venture explore other restaurants off it   But since trying Sushi House Goyemon realized missing out     Now let tell you   place truly best sushi places ever to   mean hard imagine city Las Vegas where Sand Cactus Trees predominate you'd find place Goyemon offers its patrons freshest sashimi ever experienced    So group friends came dinner Thursday night   all signed AYCE dinner special which little less $30   friends mostly ordered Special Rolls but stuck Nigiri   really enjoyed Goyemon's Garlic Tuna along Sweet Shrimp bad only order per person    still try some special rolls friends ordered hit spot   In conclusion definitely come next time Vegas attempt other restaurants off Strip   Heard Lotus Siam also must place    <EOR> Fish fresh staff friendly   it  wife ayce sushi which decent but rice lower quality side  son tonkatsu special combo dinner  meat dry no sauce tried substitute unagi sauce rice came even lower quality sushi rice  Probably won't back  <EOR> This place amazing! Did AYCE $26    Just clear don't really sushi now might wondering heck did give place 5 stars? Well other food point good  There's pretty good variety non sushi foods all good   I really liked even noted sushi didn't raw fish  considerate   The best thing don't overload rice if sushi  think other places load rice full faster but place light rice heavy good stuff   I stuffed leaving place few hours later wanted back good  <EOR> heart AYCE here!

A few favorites group were Spicy Tuna Sushi Max Orion Sunrise Mingus Baked 428  The other really nice option order half rolls allowed try many rolls without committing    Service attentive overly friendly  Plates cleared extremely timely beverages sat empty few times    Would definitely back  <EOR> We came twice within year   food isn't bad but wait service horrible     worth wait when somewhere else town same quality food less headache    I would even say Oyshi better place much drama here  <EOR> I love place! fish fresh food great  But proportions gotten little smaller must say especially sushi department  rice size thumb! pretty small hands  Also wait time sushi gets really long when full house  But server attentive quick helped more orders telling longer wait sushi    They pretty lenient AYCE times which nice because orders took while  back! <EOR> I still give five stars even waiting 30 minutes  place bit small buffet restaurant  small place only sit 60 people many chefs  food comes put fast ordering  won't give stuff didn't order   Lunch $22 dinner $27  same price elsewhere town    The sushi great everything crave sushi  dont skimp fish rice bigger needs to    many sushi buffets best  yes place totally beats Sakana sushi terms decor food quality service  <EOR> Pros Food came very fast really good  Very fresh high quality  reason 4 stars nothing else good but food great   Cons 1 hour long wait Tuesday 6pm  isn't exactly prime time wait just two 2!! people insane  When sat crammed close neighbors might well eating together  Took while server drink order took while drinks refills  Service lackluster no personality no smiles  Location isn't great easy to  Lot's douchey smokers front right outside entrance   This place great food but need expand bigger location if they're busy  plenty sushi places great food don't wait all night just sit right next strangers  probably won't back Goyemon despite good food which did come very fast ordering  I'd suggest try place lunch  <EOR> Food far none best awhile  sake on  Nice warm  sushine mouthwatering good  half rolls high fives all around  spot perfect groups  leave unhappy  <EOR> The service food exceptional  sushi delicious tasted fresh  very busy even if arrive early may wait  prices very reasonable  husband ordered all eat money's worth  <EOR> I've gone plenty times service always decent   I tonight closest friends before he leaves Hawaii  having amazing time server incredible  He very attentive food great   This ruined AWFUL MANAGER  only little over hour just finishing beer which only 1 4 left  She basically asked leave just because table came way wanted use table along already have  understand being busy needing table  why didn't want take forever even paid check soon last plate cleared out  fine asked 5 minutes wrap night finish beer  She rude abruptly said no  did appreciate gesture especially paid $80 two people gave no trouble everyone  special night friend basically ruined lack costumer service skills insensitivity manager  She ruined place looks other Yelp reviews she did same lot other people too  <EOR> Took some friends town dinner  wait only 30 minutes no complaints there  sushi good best but decent price  big problem FOOD POISONING!  Woke around 4am very sick  should note no else food poisoning except but nonetheless never gotten sick eating sushi before eat quite bit     I would recommend checking Sushi Kaya  never gotten sick eating very comparable if better  <EOR> Very bad service!! food ok  waitress never smiling nice us  Half desert cannot choose  worse experience jappenase restaurant   never come back again  <EOR> The first ayce sushi restaurant 5 years ago surprised never review place!  Right off bat I'd say best during lunch specifically when just open because pretty small spaced restaurant quite popular  **It's 99% chance you'll wait list during dinner!**  The wifey during lunch hour before dinner started probably only 3 tables open like   guesstimating 8 tables + sushi bar  gotten seated immediately young kind waitress serviced quickly beverages   She lunch special chicken teriyaki bowl $5 50 $6  course all you can eat which around same price every other lunch ayce $21 $22   The quality sushi top notch ayce standards   fav garlic tuna nigiri freshly garlic'd didn't even need bedded generous portion garlic ponzu ? sauce  Fish rice ratio bad  8 10  All orders came quickly well two servers + busperson attentive even paid attention if made eye contact them come help   very rare!   We finished 3 45pm yes we're quick eaters when check came mischarged dinner ayce price! But letting main server know she apologized charged lunch  also stamp card used sister restaurants well! I believe only sister restaurant know them Monta Ramen    Overall really great service pretty good sushi! recommend lunch special + ayce lunch forsure  Thank Goyemon  <EOR> All time favorite sushi place  Staff fast accurate when taking your order   sure if don't roll fixed   place awesome large parties well just call head time sure room   only complaint can't reservations would life much better! <EOR> My sister husband eaten restaurant few times when they've visited Las Vegas   Thought we'd give them try recent trip   It's located strip mall S  Decatur Blvd  south Tropicana Avenue    fancy but pretty full customers when arrived Sunday night dinner    They offer AYCE sushi less $30   also separate menu ala carte sushi rolls combination dinners   didn't want stuff myself opted teriyaki salmon combo which came miso soup salad California rolls tempura $10 95    portions pretty generous except 2 skinny pieces shrimp tempura   Wish shrimp little bigger   My husband ordered sushi combo $11 95 brother in law tempura udon $8 50      Prices reasonable ate  restaurant little dark cramped don't expecting much way ambiance service     I'd back again   If really hungry may even try AYCE  <EOR> The sushi no longer staff act they're busy provide excellent service  Sometimes when don't feel very welcome almost stay eat spite service  Some girls very sweet attentive but most staff just rolls eyes every time want take order  If owner won't hire more waiters don't take customers would prefer more people waiting tables  <EOR> The food great  all small portions  taste everything AYCE    You early otherwise place packed  can't wait back  price also very decent AYCE  <EOR> Great sushi!

Arigato  <EOR> I gave them 4 stars first visit dinner AYCE     and hoping would good lunch AYCE    no such luck   atrocious revolting excuse sushi   When walked bad feeling when saw two latino looking sushi chefs tsukeba   anything against non japanese itamae but fairly vast experience    it's good sign general boy right     Since Japanese don't order any rolls   always straight nigiri none those yum yum sauce fancy rolls bulshit what's wrong sushi    1 ugly   Cuts fish uneven small just very asymmetrical poorly balanced rice   When two pieces look different significant lack sense aesthetics more importantly utter luck skill   2 Sushi rice horrendous   things worse 2 sushi chefs seem using very inconsistent sushi rice   soft overly sticky other dry hard   Neither them proper vinegar flavor bland called sushi rice    obviously no idea skill proper sushi rice which just if MORE important fish it     3 Utter lack nigiri skill   Sushi rice hard   chew it   happens amateurs newbies proper skills maintain shape nigiri while having enough air within if falls apart mouth   4 wasabi issue embarrassed them   first order nigiris no wasabi   asked waitress non japanese need wasabi sushi   She comes back 2 minutes later most people don't want wasabi chefs cannot put wasabi nigiri   Let repeat THE CHEFS CANNOT PUT WASABI NIGIRI Let straight   Japan sushi chefs occasionally UPON REQUEST nigiris WITHOUT wasabi little children mean kindergarden aged kids  Never even consider putting wasabi adults   tell non Japanese waitress don't care most people want   want wasabi nigiri don't peel fish off rice put PROPER way nigiri   she back talks chefs finally comply request proper nigiri wasabi     It's very unfortunate whoever Japanese sushi chef allows sushi chefs let joke sushi customers under roof   asked waitress if any Japanese chefs lunch time she says depends schedule sometimes yes sometimes not   Well if real chefs can't properly supervise jokers then might well close down restaurant instead allowing atrocious nigiri's customers may palate knowledge real sushi should like     The management should embarrassed today   If people think kind atrocity sushi then am truly saddened   better restaurants real japanese sushi chefs town serve decent AYCE sushi   But if people numb enough palates keep going then it  <EOR> AYCE This second trip sushi house over past month  definitely worth all five stars   I've never experienced sushi house included many appetizer selections cost! Score!!!!  AYCE $26 95  I ordered Calamari strips nice thick fried perfectly    I ordered tons seaweed cucumber salad two rolls before tapping out    Highly recommended!! <EOR> Can start saying hate when places run uni! feel rip off considering you're only allowed per person anyway don't run out!

Challenge accepted  friends can't finish theirs? Don't worry you  If all else fails wrap napkins shove your purse  Then order ice cream   With all hype around Goyemon decided try few friends town  threw down many sushi rolls night    Restaurant small good parties 2 4 people but seems when big groups come trouble managing  Service bit slow but expected full house   Sushi good but  all say describe it  Very generic menu see most AYCE places down Spring Mountain  complaining but nothing really WOW factor  ordered 10 different rolls all  waitress stared disbelief some sort human garbage disposal  She's wrong   All all decent AYCE sushi place wouldn't way come back though think there's better places town  <EOR> My husband used work very well known sushi spot work would friends coworkers  always very good  really enjoy coming here  <EOR> What way begin weekend Las Vegas  craving great sushi and lots it man did Goyemon hit spot even better expecting such rave reviews local friends   We arrived shortly opening last Friday between 11 45am noon able table group 5  filled quickly while eating  drink orders quickly taken started sizing AYCE menu   Here's where kinda take issue Usually AYCE sushi table given paper where mark off items want tallymarks different rounds decide want then order second round once received items first  waitstaff takes orders traditional sushi restaurant  don't 3 reasons ordered plain edamame miso soup which start meal both   items very end meal when kind didn't even want them anymore  even ask waitress where edamame she just said way  already second bottle sake   My second problem waitstaff ordering method rather paper tallymarks things people wanted share really hard keep track many each thing wanted waitress implied she system but looking over shoulder notepad didn't see anything made sense  happily ate everything but would mildly annoyed if missing orders nigiri given many something especially something only wanted small taste like say uni    My third problem style ordering making sure received everything confirming things since adventurous  ordered some squid folks wanted tried thinking squid  Then something much more obviously squid came out  eaten earlier? world may never know  But form left table could figured somehow   Ok! Back positives  quality food fantastic  shrimp head miso added flavor gave such umami heaven  fish fresh really nice fish rice ratio nigiri mostly ordered   hate when places crazy rice AYCE fill up  place made pieces usual could really enjoy fish   Here's nigiri ordered and comments if ate it tuna maguro delicious fresh garlic tuna tasty but garlic sauce didn't really add much I'd skip plain super white tuna OH GOD PHENOMENAL yellowtail hamachi another great fresh fish refreshing tasty salmon sake favorite old standby Goyemon did disappoint seared salmon new favorite searing adds beautiful dimension meatiness snow crab meat meh good but keep trying crab keep loving much other seafoods should stop trying fresh water eel MOUTH meaty sauce sweet perfect  A couple rolls ordered table tried bit Ecstasy roll good but wasn't expecting orgasm sauce kick fan spicy sauce   We also yellowtail collar  included AYCE hot eaten garlicky sauce OMG  Without sauce really bland dry but sauce brings flavor profile  orgasmic  umami savory melt your mouth seafood dreams made of  just wanted more small flakes could pull chopsticks   The service besides weird ordering waiting forever couple things attentive polite diet coke regularly refreshed never hard flag someone down question  Overall loved place despite weird timing  10000% back next time Vegas every time just sure request miso edamame before any fish order  <EOR> This AYCE sushi spot Vegas  usually always wait when come don't come starving case takes hour seated  place big close party room sometimes wont use tables making wait longer = love Goyemon fish usually always fresh  Salmon belly ikura uni favorite  Udon yummy included AYCE menu well  favorites! many AYCE sushi places include udon menu plus me  dessert Green Tea Creme Brulee chocolate moose yummy!!

Rice fish ratio just right   Fish fresh AYCE   Service little distant but ok     Get when just open 8 if don't want wait  <EOR> Listing all food ate AYCE Goyemon would give carpel tunnel syndrome  think 7 cleared off 50+ plates   Best best Braised pork belly A++++ Masago w quail egg A++++ Each every fresh sushi A++++  Service So friendly attentive quick!

There seems limit certain things order  expensive ones ebi shrimp uni I believe all falls under cap  Ebi delish don't forget try  say usually ebi getter!  Unagi days was bit boney but flavor spicy ahi tuna hand rolls note being spicy needed couple water refills raw fish ying yang  ate anything everything including fried shrimp heads do fear shrimp heads they're actually bad even though you're eating face    So though raving why only 4 stars? Because major dessert fan tempura fried ice cream green tea ice cream did me  ice cream tempura batter really didn't taste vanilla ice cream kind consistency sherbert  Also tempura batter soggy crunchy when think typical fried ice cream  green tea ice cream came half melted resulting puddle frothy melted ice cream  made sad   Then again really don't come all eat sushi desserts  Sushi    Goyemon aced it! <EOR> This used favorite sushi places offering AYCE many sides desserts you'd like  Sad say service quality ingredients down graded greatly  Hopefully turn things around again  <EOR> I think AYCE sushi lunch around $22   dinner around $27   came around 12pm Saturday didn't wait   However came Vegas during off season   It's located corner strip mall far away Vegas Strip   Plenty parking   service good fast   food really good   place more SushiMon     Definitely come back again! <EOR> This favorite sushi place ALL Las Vegas   rolls just good!  prices decent never all you can eat any sushi place because usually eat less ordering individual rolls would cost two rolls fills up   best spicy tuna!  boyfriend always gets salmon special dinner combination plate comes soup salad little scoop potato salad big scoop rice shrimp vegetable tempura california roll teriyaki salmon $12   great deal! <EOR> There's lot buzz around place overall dependably good  standard AYCE menu rotating specialties  fish always fresh sides much better other places  recommend coming early almost always least 20 minute wait try pork belly it's worth cheating diet trust    The only real downside location service  Always friendly but slow undependable  may forgotten end your meal  <EOR> I never thought good Sushi Buffet existed   All ones past below average sushi   Sushi House Goyemon changed that   sushi par some best sushi hometown  kept track ate would've came $120 bucks!  sure if would've worth $120 even $60 but all food $26 95 absolute steal  5 stars!  YEaaah!!!!!! <EOR> Vegas best collection awesome sushi joints  abundance great sushi spots city every trip worth it  They're all located off Strip too  gotta drive some places locals favorites   Sushi House Goyemon another sweet spot  AYCE open really late simply heaven  AYCE includes only sushi but salads appetizers side dishes dessert too   Poki salad Fresh tuna addicting tangy dressing   Grilled tofu salad grilled tofu perfect seasoned taste   Grilled pork belly 2 slices tender melt your mouth pork belly   Albacore Above average albacore nigiri   Cajun Albacore favorite nigiri here  Super flavorful   Super white tuna Excellent but good Hikari's   Spider roll Very well executed here  Wrapped soy paper   Pixie roll spider roll more stuff  Also excellent   O I D  roll Baked roll salmon asparagus  bad   Being super hungry made fatal mistake ordering much fast  time first wave digested Sarah A  sushi hell  struggling breathe move  sure finish else you'll end paying more ways one!  Ironically ended night bowl lychee ice cream D <EOR> One best AYCE Sushi restaurant Las Vegas   Reservations highly recommended if party 10 more that minimum reservations   15 20 Tatami Room  Check daily specials board   Plum Wine Jelly awesome Lychee Sorbet good palette cleanser between orders sushi   One main reason great AYCE sushi dinner spot Las Vegas everything menu AYCE except sashimi    includes daily specials board hot apps dessert selections placemats   All ask finish order waste food   Sounds fair me!  I am going review every single item tried over last dozen visits   But great place dine experience totally improved if few friends   least way try more things menu before throw white flag wiggle your tummy find little more room desserts   Even if into raw fish some your buddies plenty cooked items available order  dine your foodie buddies without having feel left out   The staff great!  Even when slammed pretty much anytime 7pm still managed deliver good better service   Just show early some patience average wait dinner least hour   Food 4 5 5 food selection very good   Flavor 4 5 5 Overall very very good although some nigiri drenched much ponzu sauce   Service 5 5 never bad experience here   Decor 4 5 Pretty trendy decorative samurai swords loo   Parking 4 5 5 parking lot super big but usually find parking spot when drop dinner   Price 4 5  Comparable other local AYCE sushi restaurants Las Vegas   Value 5 5  Only sashimi available part AYCE   available selection crazily extensive   4 5 stars easily! <EOR> Honestly don't know giving two stars for   Maybe because host extremely welcoming eager seat even though jam packed 5 30pm Sunday did within first 10 mins arrival  among several groups told 30 45 even 45 60min waits but just lucky bar  first server quick busser    But many other AYCE joints once first order two taken don't come around anymore  chef seemed disgruntled entire time he served sad sad looking nigiri  Barely any stayed intact when picked up  He seemed better forming rolls  All food tasted fine but could presentation just least ALMOST decent? See pictures below can't complain dessert since Mochi ice cream pre made  bf ordered tempura ice cream which would great except took four say FOUR waiters bring spoon tempura already soggy  He still kind enough tip generously where admit might've kind  Other place looks clean  decor inviting  Beyond can't say anymore  <EOR> ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????22?????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?3???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  I gave 3 stars view point Japanese taste sushi  <EOR> I never fan AYCE sushi  Even reading good reviews place still wasn't interested coming since already favorite sushi spot! However family town few weeks ago asked bring them finally see all about  many reviews already try keep mine short sweet    A few things would point out      First lucky wait time  told would waiting 40 minutes  But because big party left opened 3 tables only waited 20 minutes  thought kind cool text link shows your place line long waited far keep track your time   Second unfortunately table close entrance door  crowded people waiting inside narrow entrance way as if place isn't tiny enough   annoyed because felt whole time strangers watching eat  Sorry but sucks when cant enjoy your meal because people keep looking over your shoulder!  Lastly sorry but sushi just wasn't great  ordered few rolls but nothing stood gave reason come back again  may sounded fancy menu but taste disappointing  However say this  rice meat fish veggies great  don't pack rice stingy other ingredients which some sushi places definitely do    Anyway glad finally tried but no thank you  don't mind paying more sushi definitely enjoy elsewhere! <EOR> Take all your vega$ winnings splurge folks! QUALITY sushi SUPERME   $25 pop granted unlimited amounts sushi including specials day   other words AYCE!  I won't hit every single item consumed but some key ones enjoyed personally were + Salmon Belly If listed Special Day menu hesitate order this!
