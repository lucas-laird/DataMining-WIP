First time wasn't greatest all  California Omelet which joke  Flat omelet nothing crazy about    My bf ordered country fried chicken actually real good   Not sure would come again least breakfast items  <EOR> Met client B fast  location access easy of  Another positive large selection specials everything cooked fresh order   I breakfast combo chose add pancakes minimal charge  sausage served patties lean eggs cooked medium pancakes yummy    Service entire staff friendly constantly refilling coffee cups   I satisfied brought additional clients following day  <EOR> First am fan Farmer Boy's  several them throughout California  So wrong today well walked waited waited then walked line counter person front being helped  did wait always say hello when walk through door? Then someone usually walks counter says may help you  No wait cashier even though employees all over place   I counter am greeted oh okay  Then another employee walks says hello  maybe judging quickly  My food came French fries ice cold  No ever asked if needed refill drink  burger much sauce runny  But still tasted good  Then big thing no cow bell door when exit?  I don't know come expect certain things   I would add gotten 5 star service Loma Linda Clovis Farmer Boys  <EOR> I've said before say again burgers Farmer Boys fine but favorite  feel over priced are  But honestly just come zucchini  burgers just more proper meal  trip last night even zucchini kind disappointing  first two pieces great  Firm  Hot  Crispy  Exactly love much it  third piece soggy side but still good  fourth final piece horrid  limp mass green yuck  breading wouldn't even stick it  seeds underneath breading brown  feel piece zucchini left long wasn't good squash begin with  way did eat last piece   In end big burger three pieces zucchini did eat filling  restaurant which looks Grandma's dining room back country very clean  lot crap floors  Mostly burger toppings  Many tables clean  trash cans over flowing  think understaffed  girl working counter also trying stock table condiments sweep between customers  person can't all  She tried though  giver credit that  <EOR> Place good any location gone seems pretty busy  Price bit higher burger joint but definitely better quality wide selection foods  Great lunch  <EOR> I ordered Patty Melt when gone other day wasnt bad but wasnt best Ive either  did enjoy bread used fries infinitley better most fast food chains  I  I back try another item menu keep open mind places products  Just because item isnt stud doesnt mean whole menu poop  <EOR> Honestly probably just ordered wrong item   think place could potential 3 star even 4 star fast food restaurant but experience trip pretty poor   I philly cheesesteak   pretty tiny considering cost $6 89 pre tax   bread more flatbread instead hoagie bread weird   bit heavy green peppers   cheese provolone steak ratio good though   meat gross though   bland mushy texture   thinking meat boiled instead grilled   My friends seemed enjoy burgers but also seemed bit small over $6 price point without fries    The onion rings good but once again sure if worth $3 39 price   huge actual onion ring not composite mushy stuff    guess rings just weren't good enough overcome disapointment cheesesteak  <EOR> Absolutely terrible support  Didn't honor coupon when ran bread bowls  Don't waste your time  Blame Rosie manager   This why stopped eating here  Crap food poor management  <EOR> Second try Farmer Boys      In original review said would back but Farmer Boys lured in  Mostly because close where work when off work limited options where eat  Typically try eat during work week but past week being lazy because head cold  cheeseburger rescue!  This time Natural Burger which honestly enjoyed much more regular cheeseburger  cheese really melted into patty which nice  But lot onions burger ended picking off  Next time just say no onions    Instead fries ordered onion rings but ummm really really did rings  just really style like  breading falling off before home because honest DID eat while driving down road   batter very thin rings very big chunky  think really just preference thing but onion rings me   New overall opinion A OK  Would back? Yes  Would order onion rings? No  Maybe just stick strictly burgers try breakfasts some time  <EOR> My upset stomach real right now   Why y'all that?!  Anyways friend today since she wanted breakfast wanted lunch  order burger sit down chop up    So she gets food people ordered did well  maybe mines taking longer because burger but friend insisted she would wait food before she ate    Yeah just told friend eat would ask  did look over heater lamp food only plate sitting but management kept asking back what's burger  gave no sorrys let's another order  Still super chill whole ordeal because understood even though didn't understand decide rightfully upset    Girl fries cold  But made friend wait no other choice but eat something    well did choice but y'all know mean  Management does come round see every thing girl over it  probably didn't want hear can't blame them    lemme stop  <EOR> I placed order almost 20 minutes watching others came receive food asked happened order???  I told accidentally gave order someone drive thru redoing order   Don't tell mixup just let sit wait nice   The manager did offer $5 voucher next time wait   I order headed truck   Once truck opened bag free cookie supposed come order FIRST item ticket nowhere found   I back inside told girl rolled eyes but mixups disorganization seemed haunting place today   She gave cookie smile apologized wished god day   Even manager seemed flustered today   food good being first thing ate today happy burger fries   am sure if stomach liked much headed straight bathroom when finished eating but brain happy   This only second time eaten am sure if third time    $5 off voucher he gave am sure passed someone else probably giving place another shot  <EOR> It's only ok  food wasn't anything write home about  Farmers burger lacked anything resembling taste honest wasn't thrilled felt hand  very stiff reminded day old AM PM burger    know coaster between rock hard buns    My wife breakfast burrito all she could say was    should gone Jack Box    don't think need say anything more    The employees really friendly fixed wife's bacon burrito when showed table no bacon    I would say try place maybe find looking for  far away justify mediocre food when N Freddie's just across street  <EOR> UPDATE waiting OVER MONTH phone call back area manager STILL didn't hear anything  called corporate she surprised but she never heard anything area manager either  Farmer Boys reaches via Yelp but once responded still didn't hear anything  Corporate helpful but nothing done issue  Terrible customer service    I came today ordered California chicken club combo bbq chicken ranch salad  waiting 15 minutes counter just ask much longer order going be  supervisor checked receipt back talk cooks then comes back says club sandwich takes longer because fry chicken  FYI chicken salad also fried but she never mentioned all   she saying though hear chicken bring dropped fryer wonder if order skipped over forgotten  20 minutes finally order but no apology anyone long wait  Once finally home order completely wrong fries cold ended being trashed  really resent place now <EOR> I've fan Farmer Boys 7 years try stop meal every time Vegas since don't locally   am always impressed excellent service  order your meal counter bring your table  Even though drinks self serve servers come check refill your drinks  love melt sandwiches soup fried zucchini  tricked myself into thinking Farmer Boys super healthy but now calorie measurements menu know food hearty not exactly healthy   But given fast food joint lot worse places eat  Watch daily specials good deal  <EOR> On wet wild Las Vegas Saturday morning delay pouring rain wild driving environment waited rain calm down Farmer Boys breakfast  would

things offer  While burgers looked good smelled even better trying watch eat thought I'd compromise Southwestern Salad     This wasn't compromise  salad tons iceberg lettuce few things tossed top look good  thing loaded good stuff all way through good start finish  Most importantly wasn't starving again 2 hours eating it   I'm also fan fresh squeezed orange juice  tried whim OMG good  I'd back Orange Juice alone but first experience overall good enough plan going back again  even bothered download app if scan your receipt $5 off your next purchase  Trust putting $5 off good use shortly    4 Stars  can't wait back try more stuff  <EOR> Love place location  food almost always excellent but few times lacking  However today extremely good service location  gentleman took order handled everything fantastic very courteous  food point visit refreshing   many other restaurants around town lacking basic customer service skills glad chose tonight  <EOR> I decided check Farmer Boys driven past several times noticed very cost efficient Yelp deal cheeseburger combo  Note future diners limited time cheeseburger combo $5 49 Yelp check in also comes some delicious cinnamon bites but ask them otherwise serve them automatically even though there's signs deal everywhere     The employee took order VERY confused Yelp deal took couple extra minutes punch but no biggie! also took 10 minutes order prepared but when ready fresh delicious! highly recommend cheeseburger well cinnamon bites    The only reason review getting 4 stars instead 5 somewhat slow service coupon confusion but bet next time update review 5  <EOR> Never finally chance try it  die for! cool plan if add app continuous food discounts specials  Just scan your receipt really cool   So let's talk food  more enough oh boy yummy  ordered Bacon Boy combo substituted fries Chili Cheese Onion  word DELICIOUS  They huge menu choose can't wrong  Can't wait back try breakfast heard nothing but good things  <EOR> Ordered two Daybreak sandwiches sausage bacon  both cases pictures speak louder words see pics   Wish could say tasted better look but would lying momma taught better  Greasy soggy buns missing pieces odd taste eggs  Couldn't take more bite ended tossing  If interpretation farm to table best keep farm  <EOR> First time treat! Service fast great  Price reasonable breakfast fantastic can't wait try burgers next! <EOR> It wasn't worst   all say that   Nah say few more things     The menu sure little over whelming first timer  salads which all look really good tad bit pricey me  lettuce c'mon peeps    Now  regular cheeseburger very disappointed  burger patty pre formed boo cooked correctly but bun cold tough  no likey  Nothing burger made mouth water   I ordered burger onion rings  Some people them thick some thin  am team THIN  Don't onion rings if 'em thin  over inch half wide enormous amount breading them  actually need cut them able dip them into any sauce   cut whole onion half began drop them into frying batter  much batter onion barely cooked  Gross    I may give them another chance because friend Mark B  real burger lover promised take try burgers    I would recommend place anyone wants blown away awesomeness  Rather if you'd revisit leather strap daddy spanked your buns child order onion rings  <EOR> Nice place away strip   Just short 10 minute drive  A great selection items  Staff very friendly  Would highly recommend it <EOR> Review update Still best fish zucchini ever had  portions still giant two meals me  Lots sauces vinegar girl happy    New management worked wonders excellent over the top service  star back plus extra invisible ones positive changes    Nom   nom   nom    <EOR> Fries undercooked burger dry nothing it  Burger frozen no taste  Dining room disgusting  NEVER back  <EOR> I came yesterday breakfast burrito no eggs extra hash browns no charge extra hashbrowns   very good but wasn't able finish boyfriend rest  He liked much decided back today another  2 time no eggs no salsa extra hash browns extra cheese  time charged side hash browns side saying split burritos woman named Rosie believe manager   Okay no problem pay whatever long ordered  burritos drive work  TOTALLY WORTH EXTRA $$$ CHARGED  manager none less  upset charged extra upset manager felt annoyed special order she felt need charge extra side hash browns which wasn't charged just YESTERDAY then didn't deliver quality food  guess cooks didn't read side note split burritos sent actual side hashbrowns then didn't bag give me  manager she should top things  Especially if you're going complicate things charging side items added then ensure ordered  experience yesterday would earned them 5 stars but tack today's experience   2 stars  none those Rosie  <EOR> Good food faster then most farmer boys! given coupon combo but would pay full price regardless  <EOR> Horrible Customer Service  usually love location but recent visit awful  cashier seem she paying no attention because she kept repeating order wrong when she repeated back right she still gave wrong  said vanilla shake 3 times she still gave strawberry shake  also ordered fruit side grapes mildew  Disgusting!!! spent 45$ manager only offered give 3$ back fruit  top all food wasn't enough good  Couldn't enough finish eating it  <EOR> So ordering through drive through! told no large drinks no ice cream!!!! confused!   see ice cream shakes sign!  once again told no ice cream all though see thrifty gallons   decide inside once inside speak manager Angel he  explains large cups prepackaged shakes thrifty ice cream   explain just wanted some ice cream  Angel says  just way she told that   responded take internet!  Angel said ever!!!!  Sign says hand blended ice cream    Hand blended shakes     would think could some ice cream maybe shake! <EOR> Like most fast food joints place repulsive  Props them having vegetarian burger menu though  Perhaps place wouldn't gross if wasn't coerced into eating much   first time thought alright but veggie burger wasn't impressive being oily just bad anything else make  revisiting place few times couldn't even stomach burger anymore  tried few other things menu including farmhand bowl some breakfast things   Even worse  great if you're starving hurry but unappetizing if other options  course awhile finally put foot down refused back never again  <EOR> Their food good but service really slow! visit 1 00 afternoon  know lunchtime but 15 minutes waiting asked them pack our order because daughter going late first day new job  She did time eat which really upset about  eat again because food but sure am no hurry  <EOR> We Alisa help us  She rare combination friendliness sincerity  Management take notice people should  taken care promoted try replicate level genuine service  Now food fast food but crappy fast food  Kind cross between fast food family owned places if sense  return  Gets little busy during typical eating hours  Breakfast served all day bonus  <EOR> I really food especially breakfast burritos chocolate shakes  service little slow sometimes  gone eat restaurant ordered same thing meal 1 2 3 4 meal eat there  When bring then argue say true  Whatever  continue but only breakfast burritos  <EOR> Drove all way down cheeseburger combo special she said  location??  Nevermind!  Thankfully Jaime awesome server made forget!!! <EOR> Good food great service  having worked service industry more decade becoming accustomed ever worsening customer service refreshing genuinely delightful customer service  <EOR> I stopped Farmer Boys other night give them another try   This time ordered Bell Ringer which 1 2lb double cheeseburger usual toppings some onion rings drink   I say burger time very good  meat much better flavor remember last burger toppings better proportion well  Plenty onions tomato time  decided leave bacon off time  sure if improved well but burger very good without it   As onion rings tasted good enough but IMO cut onions way wide  When take bite lot breading crumbles off because doesn't stick onion very well  Also even though probably end getting fair amount actual food weight order onion rings comes only 4 rings  feels you're getting shorted    I'll definitely back double cheeseburger though  extra star awarded  <EOR> Hmmm difficult parts impressed parts just fell flat descent burger good fries place would way for  <EOR> I always try most new places specialize breakfast  love breakfast! tried Eastern location  Really poor service slow  Two very small eggs processed ham tomatoe slices ripe cold toast the butter wouldn't melt average coffee    $9 89  won't back would say either  many places Las Vegas area serve very good bfast much much less  <EOR> Good quality food but overpriced  burger combo plus drink cost over $13 which hard justify glorified fast food restaurant  $3 medium sized side fries insulting  No gracias!  We used frequent Farmer Boys when first opened Vegas 10 years ago but prices increased dramatically since then  plus side new app give $5 back every $60 spent  <EOR> I used farmer boys all time today home which 15 mins away order wrong thought ok no big deal big company let call them they'll fix it  Instead manager name Andres really thick accent sure if he even understood but he pretty much told file complaint good day  used farmer boys lot actually 2 days ago always spend around $20 but no longer going he didn't even try fix issue surprised burger spot isn't cheap mc Donald's u would think would care more  <EOR> I new location Stephanie awesome!
