But overall worth getting rat race restaurants nice quiet chill dinner atmosphere    A lot people address poor customer service   initially same thoughts  But then decided since only tiny Korean restaurants where live where owner takes care don't worry menu maybe aren't familiar enough culture judge service bad     group doesn't eat meat ordered seafood dish given perceived bit grief  no help offered choosing seafood dish  later decided Korean server probably didn't intend service improved more group ate meat side dishes      Going Ginseng definitely cultural experience  AYCE BBQ 5 different meat choices if don't specify your preference the bulgogi perfection! they'll start beginning keep feeding until meat sweat coma   mean keep feeding lot! BBQ cooked grill your table pretty cool!   We didn't even look later pages menu where prices into $30 50 range  hot pots other dishes    3 stars because food good service okay but could improve menu confusing plus discouraged ordering they wanted everyone order AYCE   would back but we'd research we'd want order first!

 Seoul?  places where sewage open air   kidding   reminded New Orleans   also much smaller meat portions Korea   Now price pretty steep $30+ BBQ stuff but portions big enough two people   made catastrophic mistake ordering pork belly BBQ dumpling rice cake soup   meal two grown men     I love open grill table   real Korean BBQ   If restaurant no grill table fake Korean BBQ   wasn't entirely sure protocol but guess when waitress doesn't flip meat should unless want burnt meat   kim chee mild side much garlic if any   Now authentic but then again when you're Vegas really want garlic breath hitting women clubs?  think smart move them   food all fresh   I'd give them five stars but sure use grass fed hormone free beef decor bit casual   would liked less strip mall lunch cafe feel more dark dinner restaurant feel   Service excellent   also all major Korean beers don't worry price come large   hit place every time Vegas   would also see some Korean soaps TV least some K pop music  <EOR> While vegas craving some korean bbq food  never experience k bbq vegas looked yelp found place  reason why chose place because nearby hotel stayed strip its walkable distance  then made mind place  When wasn't busy  maybe 930 night  excited try place starving since knew going ayce going eat alot during day  requested ayce menu since wasn't handed me  gave regular side order menu most dishes average 15 20 bucks entree  knew would add few more bucks better deal    the inside pretty much section off into your own table seating four most kbbq tables  roomy lots space groups small parties well  parking back building  next club called krave sure if club still exists  but place hidden isn't easily spotted strip  sign red letter outside plaza  finding place might bit tricky  nearest casino would mgm if remember correctly    next sat down waited patiently food arrive servers break eating dinners  saw them eating k bbq food grilling up  brought raw meat placed all bbq cooked me  didn't much because each time try flip come over take tongs flip me  wish own pace then them serving all time  felt rush stuff everything face once  remember meat awesome good  texture flavor point  did ask seconds side dishes which bean sprouts pickled spicy cucumbers kimchi well  know some good stuff  when asked more don't acknowledge but bring you  felt didn't much maybe just tired  customer service kind rude if say so    i did good experience did eat few rounds before called quit  nice honor person customers k bbq  unlike some places LA where don't honor person ayce bbq  did satisfy craving kbbq vegas  did end finding much friendlier environment kbbq much more food vegas later on  if ask if would repeat place rather travel bit further strip some better more food ayce  Thanks reading  add follow if haven't  <EOR> Found place accident while walking strip family  kinda hidden alley few yards strip  very clean inside A C definitely keeping cool  If fan Korean place but managed enjoy too  <EOR> SERVICE Fantastic  don't walk into many KBBQ places hostesses cook serve food  hostess checked periodically cook meats sure satisfied everything else table  also helps ringer button wall ring them things water refills meat orders when they're busier less attentive    FOOD meats exceptionally marinated seasoned but spicy pork kalbi short ribs still very good  unseasoned thin slices steak tad dry dip bean sauce sesame oil  think least favorite meat All Eat menu pork belly  almost completely just fat  did enjoy however unlimited salad comes meal  chopped lettuce dressed spicy vinegar oil  Light refreshing perfect compliment barbequed meats  important note prices risen within past year so  AYCE option used around $22 24 person think  Now $30 eat your fill  why giving 3 stars though arguably 4 stars when taking everything into consideration ATMOSPHERE place off white tiled floors oil stains some glass round place no music anything  much look but KBBQ place opens 24hrs don't think 'atmosphere' should something concern yourself with    If you're looking some good grub 2am morning hard night partying recommend place  <EOR> If you're looking basic Korean bbq then would your place  lot kbbq didn't give those great flavors service lacking not many refills water didn't explain menu items well I e  carry Korean sides restaurants vary if $29 all eat worth it  party 5  <EOR> Food okay but managers harassed friends pay appropriate amount tip would accept anything less  Wasn't most enjoyable experience end very frustrated hospitality   <EOR> We bit hesitant try place due average 3 star rating nevertheless stopped early lunch Sunday  place nearly empty mind only 11 30am     The prices higher your usual K town prices but Korean somewhat limited strip  ordered Doenjang Jjigae Kimchi Jjigae Yook Kimchi Tofu  Everything surprisingly very tasty  Kimchi Jjigae favorite Korean stew order 80% time mets expectations     Service great  definitely back if craving Korean while Vegas  <EOR> Very pricy especially those spoiled LA AYCE but tasted good me   Definitely helps Korean  <EOR> Had group three being vegetarian she did want all eat two did  woman said she could anything other all eat because rest table getting it  told no point paying $30 eat vegetables rice  She insisted she order all eat well just did since already seated starving point  She never asked drink orders end price 20 dollar tip included bill which she claims states included menu which did see  place smelled disgusting walking in  Waitress rude probably due fact tip included  Also she told vegetarian friend  if she didn't want pay $30 AYCE then she sit different table alone if she wants order vegetable tempura  !! <EOR> This literally best service ever had  Ever  order everything dinner all eat menu served within minutes really want say seconds ordering  I'd definitely come again <EOR> 24 hour Korean BBQ Las Vegas strip?!?!

 looked other tables seemed normal proportions    When order dish Sam Kiup Sar Pork Strips should normal proportion dish meant table 4 full grown adults  But I think owner lady brought it she just brought 5 pieces  ! saying guh ji = homeless beggar take scraps gone     For group 4 adults + drinks + tip = $180  The taste quality food said 3  service received ZERO   gave sour aftertaste walked out  If just it  But felt embarrassed front customers  <EOR> I rated two basically bad service  food worth price but portions good amount  spicy chicken which really spicy  would share someone  I tried friends Cold Soup bring ice it  Very interesting never soup brought cold  no flavor eating ice cold soup just weird me  Nasty wouldn't order it   Its also nice because place open late night because everything taste good when you're drunk if you're craving korean bbq club would come   convenient right off strip   The only nice thing asked party of 10 if wanted separate checks paying bill made very easy   But overall service sucks food ain't worth price $26 spicy chicken  Tax tip included only good late night drunkin food <EOR> I've place time time whenever visited Las Vegas Strip  always closest Korean restaurant available near hotels didn't really care if food good not  Visited once again today nice meal nice workers greeting helping us  BUT ladies overcharged tip herself which over 20% meal  First all guessing she assumed Korean tourists she tried rip off  Second only party 5 SIX  shouldn't automatically charged tip when don't even more 6 people  original price should 73 74 dollars but bill came ninety something dollars almost hundred   try rip off food isn't even good lol  !       !    6  5   20       <EOR> Food delicious very friendly staff awaits you  Its great  its open 24 hours day  pricey but food extremely fresh  <EOR> It was    Ok  outstanding Korean BBQ  but case here  first impressive all pickled condiments bring out  Meat seasoned well  But grill pretty tiny group 6  Took long cook everything  Partially because girl kept coming around turning down heat  didn't want anything nicely seared    Just awkward grey color  also opted all eat $30 per person  meant all wanted eat  wanted more short ribs told already exceeded limit? Huh? only allowed 2 scrawny pieces person  bad    busy cooking rest group    Guess missed two pieces  Now think think turning down heat would eat slower  Then friends wanted dessert  don't dessert  Sigh    horrible however many amazing places hurry back  <EOR> Hidden gem las vegas strip   everything need your korean bbq fix   Although more sides other places   Otherwise brisket delish spicy tofu soup good   Got 1am no wait all  Oh yeah did mention 24 hour spot? Love it     Clean spacious  Good service good food  <EOR> Came some Korean bbq since family starving driving LA    Maybe came wrong day Vegas Korean restaurant runs business  Service okay but meat no where close good  ordered all eat   brisket okay no choice but galbi comes only 2 pcs each person just gross  thought highlight since waitress said only 2 pcs each person but bad none even touched taking bite  quality color meat just fresh  bad didn't even put grill  give star salad being open 24 7  <EOR> Man happened customer service here? used love eat when came Vegas  come all eat bbq first try order chicken without asking me  tell them no because know  takes longest cook order beef selections   When try order more meat again notice waitress swiped away menu without asking us   ask menu AGAIN order more food   when 3 waitresses try tell already ordered those meats  respond obviously know but want order MORE  short try intimidate order little possible which crazy all eat place  Sometime later AGAIN notice menu missing but look around all Asian patrons still theirs  shady practices against non Asian customers which sad pathetic  last time you'll see joint only because shitty service  <EOR> I haven't Ginseng Korean BBQ II long time   When many Korean restaurants Vegas used take friends visitors place because staying hotels strip very convenient them come warm meal show shopping   having much buffet food always wanted some Korean food last day departure  But still pricey don't AYCE Korean BBQ  My cousin town friends she wanted dinner Ginseng II   She said she really liked food every time she Vegas try Korean BBQ   Since she leaves Korea town LA pretty sure she must tasted greatest Korean BBQ LA   wondering why she wanted try food she could better ones K town? I agreed dinner Ginseng II right Christmas   place pretty busy all tourists   all shared some dishes including Bibimbap Kimchi Jjigae Kalbi Chadolbaegi brisket    amazed all dishes night delicious!  Especially Kimchi Jjigae outstanding all  Kalbi tender tasty   side dishes awesome   She right  food pretty good comparing ones LA    I'm really hoping food still great  next time come back! <EOR> Although most impressive all eat korean BBQ restaurant ever tried give place credit offering different all eat option standard Las Vegas buffets area   Visitors restaurant could order regular dishes standard menu select all eat meat options  tried AYCE option which consisted 5 meat options including brisket short rib kalbi bulgogi  meat good but good quality fresh compared other places tried past  offered good selection slides offered salad nice light dressing  restaurant charged $29 per person which pricier typical restaurants type but its high prices understandable given located Strip    The restaurant itself comfortable quiet unlike many korean BBQ restaurants east coast  Service also excellent well frequently stopped ask next meat selections refill sides dipping sauces    Tip even though might tempted try eat $29 worth meats far more pleasant experience eat only much your stomach comfortably tolerate  same mistake overeating did may regrets days afterwards  <EOR> Was seated asked ordered all eat Korean BBQ menu $29 99 but told 2 person minimum  stated anywhere menu outdoor signage  False advertising walked out  Poor business practices   don't support places this! <EOR> yeah dont know   korean bbq staple life long night losing money pleasant consonant chords free booze   said 'yes please'   admittedly also helped closest place still open   even piss drunk pretty disappointed   most places bring over dozen side dishes house made themselves!  think counted five most seemed canned   messed trusted fire them cook bulgogi   quality just okay   didnt seem marinade ran very deep   the service nearly nonexistent spite fact three occupied tables time   when came around vaguely pleasant give them that   also korean bbq expensive   place takes couple steps further really justified   overall feelings if you're going charge 'right strip' premium might well invest some cash into higher quality product    <EOR> The server charged tip card without even asking it  asked why she did asked cancel transaction but she said no      Well thanks <EOR> Plus open 24 hours right off strip fast food  much else say though  Service lackluster food mediocre overpriced we didn't Korean BBQ buffet   return  <EOR> Pretty good Korean food but over priced  Nothing special flavor  same quality most Korean restaurants  <EOR> About week ago family four visited Vegas Christmas great time great food city except one   It dinner time busy  being seated 20min try finally took order which all eat bbq  All you can eat hour time limit started serving food 20min without asking dishes wanted  Besides ordered appetizers separately finally served appetizers when almost done meal we rushed them serval times food   During meal served food very slowly never checked us  did really enjoy meal because rush food water did service them   The most impressive thing happened  paid cash 13% tip  I know should paid 15% dinner but did give service think reasonable pay less stopped leaving because did pay 18% tip  lady explained 18% gratuity party 6 more  table 6 people must pay 18% tip  told them did choose table only four gratuity rule did apply us  happy service put down amount thought deserved  Then she started being mad gave attitude said something angrily language    I think just very horrible experience trip recommend friends come because awful service  <EOR> Between hustle bustle strip only Korean BBQ restaurant but 24hour Korean BBQ Restaurant!  It around 3am ordered Bul Gi Galbi full taste fresh fantastic  portions HUGE  super hungry able finish both orders  But would sufficed    Also even though just around time drunks would rolling service great   Buffet day Korean BBQ night? think so  <EOR> Was craving tofu soup long day drinking friend suggested here   Considering vegas know prices aren't bad but still kind pricy when you're paying $17 tofu soup  good but nothing special didn't already added egg inside because don't egg soupy  tofu soup filled tofu! Overall good spot anyone Vegas craving Korean food but wouldn't pay $30 40 prices kbbq there  <EOR> Ayce $26 during lunch time  and again rerrible terrible!! Low quality meet tons fat  and banchan tasted old n weird  Dont come people r crazy serve crap n ask ubto oay $26 low quality meat overcooked rice n 5 dishes banchan fresh tasty dont serve any soups steamed egg ayce  <EOR> Great food!!! Lots it! Very nice staff    told them first visit helped explain everything even helped cook    very attentive needs  Filled drinks constantly  Would recommend anyone looking something different  definitely come back again when Las Vegas!!! <EOR> Service poor   would forget water side dishes meat quality cheap  Won't waste money again  <EOR> I LOVE place!

We shall return! <EOR> Food tastes just authentic Korean BBQ! very busy might why people problem service but great experience  sat right away served immediately  restaurant worth food! did all eat ordered 3 meats off menu all delicious  definitely back again! <EOR> Love love love Korean bbq  server really nice helpful  family vacation didn't know just decided stop by  glad did  <EOR> For Korean BBQ Strip Ginseng 2 Kimchi BBQ  Ultimately decided Ginseng 2 even though knew would more expensive  Kimchi BBQ's hour time limit self serve panchan recent closing due health concerns didn't seem appealing   They're open 24 hours arrived very late weekday only ones there  ordered samgyupsal pork belly spicy pork  Prices definitely higher expected also paid extra salad  Two bowls rice included but if more people cost more too  did come any kind soup ordered kimchi jjiggae side  panchan side dishes bad except kimchi! All super sour which disappointing  plus side meat worth price received decent sized portions spicy pork seasoned very well    Our waitress did all cooking she politely chatted us  She great refilling panchan needed  No problems there  best Korean BBQ experience but passable  <EOR> Food meh side dishes terrible service pretty much non existent prices ridiculously expensive  understand located strip nothing cheap but still  Long story short rather disappointing experience don't recommend place if you're craving good Korean food  <EOR> Open 24 hours middle strip! really didnt high expectations place coming 3 am  menu expensive due being strip  order bulgogi beef brisket share amongst friends  She first brought sides fish cake sides day which just ruined whole experience entirely    lol jk But since only ordered two types meat only came two bowls rice pay extra  wasn't served lettuce salad cost $5 more  type place just pay extra anything extra  guess expecting all eat type places more use to  Other meat portions plentiful    The server started off fairly rude while she finally warmed but already late leave good tip <EOR> I love place open 24 hours strip right next Krave  craving some beef tofu soup because rather cold outside  price tofu soup significantly more expensive am used paying LA but still good especially hard night drinking partying  thought banchan side dishes pretty good  only thing put egg tofu soup which normally leave out  Even though didn't want soup did enhance flavor soup  building located behind Walgreens may little bit difficult locate Las Vegas Blvd  <EOR> I forgot take picture place but reality something you'll want forget  never korean bbq labeled all eat then slapped 2 piece limit LA Galbi per person  place joke!   I brisket which normally good mean wrong thin un marinated meat? Boy wrong  super chewy tasted old  samgyupsal bacon same way  2 pieces galbi should world amazing since limit it  Nope! thinly sliced full fat  flavor off    I spent $30 bbq didn't even eat it  top within few hours felt completely sick stomach  Terrible! <EOR> The Ginseng BBQ located 150 ft down small street between Walgreen's Fatburger   directly across Strip Monte Carlo   short stroll under several palm trees likely reduces business level lot but readily accessible   There's also some parking right beside place no signs fees but might $5 during day   serve full menu Korean dishes including dinners hot pots barbeque   But prices run quite high individual items example Galbi included All You Can Eat $35 95 Bulgogi $27 95 while AYCE $29 includes unlimited 5 pricey items along full side dishes serving Galbi   deal!  The price increased recently $29 but still quite reasonable quality food quantity location   Sheesh across street they're seving fish chips $23!  Ginseng serving gourmet quality food   visited 10pm Thursday became only customer long arriving   greeted seated warmly looked regular menu before requesting buffet   chose only 4 five meat entrees knowing I'd lucky finish that   ate very little sides most main courses but appetite limited days   chose skip Chadolbaegi brisket due reviews Dakgui because chicken   Meat dishes include your choice 6 different items 4 beef 1 pork 1 chicken 1   La Galbi Beef short rib w  house special sauce 2   Bulgogi Thin slices rib eye marinated w  specially formulated soy sauce 3   Chadolbaegi Thin slices beef brisket point without marinade 4   Dakgui Chicken meat marinated w  specially formulated soy sauce 5   Sam Gyeop Sai Thin slices bershire pork skinless belly without marinde thick sliced bacon 6   Mae Un Dwae Jigui Grilled spicy pork  Side dishes 8 included white rice large romaine salad w tangy dressing Kimchi soybean sprouts pickled radishes broccoli grilled cucumber chunks another green pickled dish   All worth taste but enjoyed salad lot sprouts pickled items best  The menu doesn't list items mention they're included  There's also soy based dipping sauce possibly ginger based chunky dipping sauce     The waitress understood wished assistance cooking provided firing grill center table bringing sides water   She started Sam Gyeop Sai basically thick bacon laying full strips then using scissors cut strips into pieces   gained decent char both sides she started Galbi Bulgogi leaving Mae Un Dwae Jigui until last   bacon thin sliced steak short ribs then spicy pork   favorite Bulgogi which fantastic marinade followed Dwae Jigui which also nice sauce   short ribs more something you'd find chinese buffet bacon just bacon!  All good however   think could manage cooking myself next time bacon pork favor nice char others just need turned frequently fully cook   And another time   Ginseng just become place LV Strip never visit without eating least once   mean really sirloin steak $50 under $30 there's no contest   Plus can't down street San Antonio but looking now! <EOR> Foods services good  tipped only $5  She looks very unhappy  <EOR> i don't gamble   however love mixed martial arts   how could gone such stacked event such ufc 84?  even if most god awful name history full contact sports? ill    when first heard thought joke   mean friend ours jokingly call ill    even then stupid   one friends decided would good place miss korea brethren hop first chance korean food   being strip thought place would ridiculously expensive but bad   mean relatively   most essentials korean list bulgogi galbi soondooboo etc   i did think $17 plate jahp chae pushing bit though   mean fucking rice noodles veggies beef  overhead shit must obnoxious las vegas because should never over $10   anyway soondooboo [spicy tofu stew] friend girlfriend kimchee jjigae [kimchee stew] ttuk guk [rice cake soup] respectively   all came standard but bahn chan little meh   which reminds me  fuck all korean restaurants serving coleslaw bahn chan now?  seriously   hiring polish people back now?  the service pretty okay seemed handle non korean speaking customers [my friends] pretty well which best say most korean restaurants   also really cute waitress extra star that   hope she reads yelp because totally going ask digits next time come around [ie  when broke shit] she better ready  <EOR> 24 hour Korean food! Oh yeah!  Much better service food nearby Kimchi Restaurant  Yukgaejang hits spot long day drinking  Wife really likes dolsot bibimbap too    We stop place every time we're Vegas  <EOR> Came foursome late reservation but kept nice them  place difficult find because middle strip las vegas  Parking may difficult find am access people aren't familiar vegas crowd    The place okay athmosphere nothing special  dining floor restrooms clean  place crowded all tables seperated thoroughly evenly  ambience loud but quiet good mixture    The food good briskets bulgogi kalbi pork chicken  side dishes good well although didn't fish cakes    The service started good  She proactive helping getting food settled but towards end didn't exist all   why place 3 star lack consistency service   Would come back again? Probably not  place very inconvenient locals  There's other cheaper same better quality China town  <EOR> I didn't realize happy stay MGM when realized place located right next MGM!  THANK JESUS!

Service meh banchan sides so so but food overall    I hae jang gook which normally tons stuff but version napa something beef bits  Tasted good light but quite hae jang gook   overall still good though vegas    <EOR> If give lower 1 star will    visiting Las Vegas expecting good time but when stop Ginseng BBQ dinner place just ruin whole night  worst costumer service experienced   After seated automatically serve Rice Tea placed table  wife ask glass water waitress said Oh tea?
