I small burrito  OK meat little dry Spanish rice old tasted weird  husband tacos he liked it  <EOR> Havent good tacos while  wonderful taco 3 some deal ended going back buy 3 more dinner  service wonderful inside beautiful  Very welcoming staff  <EOR> The 1 star due fact husband myself friend arrived Chronic Tacos 8 55 tonight Saturday only find doors locked employees closing up  Employees saw didn't even bother come offer explanation  lack sign explanation being closed more hour early just bad business  <EOR> Have eaten Palms location many times assumption freestanding restaurant flamingo close 215 would fairly similar  Boy wrong  carne Assad tacos should called gristle tacos meat tough couldn't even chew mostly fat gristle  order very short drive home when unwrapped food nasty mess inside bag  girl assembled tacos wrapped them tightly paper everything mashed together  Definitely returning location  <EOR> I liked thought pretty good  3 taco deal 2 chicken 1 steak enjoyed it  would again if little closer home  <EOR> Rating specifically food    could better  just another Chipotle Zabas  Same concept  Overall though place very trendy bar  Can't that  Food needs little work  <EOR> First timers! Atmosphere decorations pretty nice but food average  When visited only customers staff seemed little prepare walked in  When food finally prepared seemed bit rushed processed  Overall question your money better spent elsewhere? would be  <EOR> I am fan place  restaurant always clean when visit really open ambient  The customer serve decent but could definitely little more friendly  While taking order making food carried personal conversation between asking would burrito which thought bit rude  My burrito however vegetarian burrito Baja style delicious  burritos very big wrapped well   The restroom time most recent visit smelled raw fish  Overall place good back  <EOR> This third stop each time food excellent plenty     restaurant nice appearance    staff offer suggestions if sure get   the parking lot usually full but additional parking back    <EOR> Don't waste your money  place horrible  hour half before closed only ones there  Should taken sign walk away  started off worst service ever  two girls behind counter really could cared less impressing us  didn't know anything food if contained lard it  ordered fajita veggies waited 10 minutes cook simply grill some bell peppers  No onions anything  going guacamole but then looked entire container black  know oxidizes but omg add some lime juice doesn't look bucket crap  Needless say worst place ever  back  <EOR> Major letdown     restaurant nice clean staff nice but food sub par   far being chronic    The food barely warm didn't whole lot flavor   Wish would've robertos chipotle     I back <EOR> I wanted love place badly but may last time here   Customer service lacking especially when obvious first time  Few female workers just blank stares waiting decide order  impatient vibe definitely welcoming all  only male worker pretty friendly suggested certain things meals    I ecstatic see Al Pastor since very common ordered bowl that  Scoops rice meat little bowl more salad full lettuce drenched salsa cheese sour cream  Al Pastor also advertised spicy no spice all  If anything simply salty    I ate half bowl thank goodness ordered chips cause just ate little scoops soupy drenched salty supposed bowl but became salad meal    Oh there's bar! But I'd still rather just local favorite casual Mexican food place  thought I'd find another alternative but sadly didn't  <EOR> Came Taco Tuesday ended staying few drinks  bartender Marcus made best Cadillac margaritas long time  Baja tacos jalapeños amazing  def back soon <EOR> This place okay  came taco Tuesday $1 off tacos which pretty good deal  Tacos usually 3 99 there  actually pretty big tacos  expecting them smaller street tacos more authentic restaurants  don't pay extra guacamole which nice  service eh  lady made taco wasn't very friendly she gave fish taco instead shrimp asked but wasn't big deal just ate fish one  fish didn't taste very fresh but liked prepared baja style   carne asada other taco slightly cold tough  think favorite chicken which good flavor    The restaurant itself very clean  <EOR> My favorite quick service place Taco Tuesdays  $1 off tacos   Chicken carnitas favorite  guac included!  supposedly no hormones nor antibiotics added non gmo  <EOR> Idk big deal is   everyone says good but just don't see it  Maybe fault getting tacos  nachos cold cheese and enough burrito big sure but nothing special   even homemade tortillas  No reason back  <EOR> Attempting lunch run place work no answered first time called called back told other customers please hold placed phone counter left hold few minutes then someone hung up  first time called no answer  Food good service sucks! <EOR> I love place!
