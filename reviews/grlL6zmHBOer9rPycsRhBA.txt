So birthday reservations  arrived 20 minutes early escorted upstairs but did seat table even though only customers there  Sat bar upstairs but awful sewer odor when asked told sewer issues should sit somewhere else!!! Well didn't choose sit there! asked table  We LOVE Kumamoto oysters always them when come appetizer  first time came oysters butchered shells all broken pieces w oysters! complained wait proper shucked kumamoto arrived  Second time came beautiful arrived Japanese pickled vegetables! Third time last time 4th shucked well NO pickled vegetables took forever  WHY can't consistent food sure done properly? upstairs began busy before hectic server took order  upstairs now full many tables came getting food but far oysters it  table came while waiting!! Finally some food begins show up  sushi rolls sushi very good  fish very fresh but LONG wait   WHY? Happened last time too  flag someone down husband could another beer  NO recognition birthday all  noted reservation  food inconsistent  which sucks but worst service  really hit miss  pet peeves new restaurant caring enough consistent both food well service  Also supposed receive cash back through Yelp Groupon  yet receive this!

I don't know if arrogance ignorance but think remember your order without writing down   And then screw up  Their attention span 0 0   So if take incident time only thing you'll think over reacting but last three times there   Owners don't comprehend people dining EXPERIENCE  My experiences suck there   Tonight sat bar ordered 3 same type roll miso soup cucumber salad  Waitress brought cucumber salad knew just looking old  I took bite just sure  It awful  I gave guy behind counter take away   At some point he told waitress she came over asked if wanted another one  I said no  She brings anyway  Get drift? Does girl pay attention any level?  Then when sushi came before miso soup asked soup  I said did hear ask miso soup? She said yes she heard but forgot  I said yes because didn't write down!  You're servers   Write shit down! At least TRY right  I mean only three customers whole place!  So she came over check me  I told done place  She replied everyone mistakes   Not if write order down pay attention!  That's it  I am breaking point place every other shitty restaurant here   This ENTERTAINMENT capital WORLD  People come all over world hospitality school   Don't think cuz Tony Hsieh throws some dough know own restaurant   So then she asked if wanted anything else  I told would never again  She replies in high whiny snotty girl voice OK! said yeah ok cuz don't own place  She says she does   Even worse  Good luck chick! <EOR> Love place   use comps D great combination crazy good rolls traditional sushi happy hour 30% off everything!

We asked Chef s ever wanted   inquired likes executed perfectly!   If want great Sushi joint it! Irish mug  <EOR> Great place   best sushi ever your life but definitely better 90% sushi places city   staff always really friendly much even when mistake handle nicely doesn't matter   restaurant also always noticeably clean   When comes casual night sushi to   Considering sushi spot area find quite lucky good one  <EOR> Legit 5 star sushi place downtown   place great attentive helpful wait staff   Awesome sushi chef   Two sat sushi bar   Fish super fresh made care   Loved Dragon Roll   tuna truly some best ever had     Great place definitely back   <EOR> This place totally spot  friend probably come once week  gave 3 stars because everything bit overpriced  hit miss service  Basic rolls 4 5$ more average    NOBU prices! half dozen oysters 15$ ive literally bit into pieces shells they're tiny! Even hot sake asahi expensive! location downtown which awesome because aren't many sushi places over there!   Their baked mussels eaten many shells inside baked mussel rolls rock shrimp sake die for! Service usually hit miss  literally bar demand service  last 3 times only 3 tables upstairs always forget everything order! absolutely love second floor karaoke bar area  interior layout place sure win  <EOR> I sad give such low rating experience  starters quite promising excellent garlic edamame steamed shumai  However service simply terrible  wife's plate brought some 20 min before ever received food  She finished well before even received own order  did escape another party arrived placed orders least 15 min did ordered same thing myself  chef preparing food bar front simply waited did dishes same time  sat through whole lunch watching wife finish meal before mine came exact moment other party's meals delivered   No apology all nothing said before paid bill left   Moreover sushi sashimi combo entirely average best  fair price but disappointing nonetheless  Only days ago enjoying delicious sashimi some favorite places California  Avoid place  other options better service  <EOR> Do hang watch everyone's food getting made?  Then place would spend 2 3 hours   bring your $60 nice night  If don't want your food take 30 45 minutes made spending $40 60 person eat then should choose other 50 places walking distance  Also if don't loud music spill over upstairs karaoke rooms then best place spend your evening  This place stays busy just sure crowd before visiting  <EOR> I'm always downtown quite some time good majority regular patrons wanting sushi spot finally venture  Sad say Bocho did leave good impression   I looking forward trying ever since rumors began surface sushi restaurant opening downtown  heard mixed reviews friends since opening rather take others words finally decided check out    The sushi bar downstairs if basic reminds something may find Los Angeles New York where space premium  very well lit walk greated chefs  also upstairs dining area bit more spacious accommodate larger groups also private room available cocktail bar also located upstairs    As sat down server greeted quickly asked if we'd drinks  Water beer ordered brought table promptly followed complimentary edamame  Quite few things ordered off menu say fish very fresh flavors sauces condiments used rolls very tasty no complaints there  major thing issue anyone loves sushi should issue hard dense undercooked rice  mean you're sushi restaurant use rice all day long  could your major ingredient under par especially since base all your dishes  Again fish fresh delicious but can't good sushi restaurant if can't produce good rice!   Our bill split 3 which server did mind doing but she very attentive when came keeping water glass full checking sure things going okay  3 people ordered separate orders some them mixed together sushi   When asked server clarify she very flustered said she did know differentiate rolls  Also table next big group asked server take picture them which course would've bothered if she practically climbed table take picture them even excusing herself still finishing meal very unprofessional    So overall back??? Maybe possibly  If cook rice properly  <EOR> Outstanding   Excellent   Great value   Good service   Fresh fish   Anything else?  back again again  <EOR> Great sushi amazing environment  Great date spot well  sushi really good especially Poke Monster <EOR> Restaurant lied when called saying order taken driver 20 minutes ago order already way late should any minute now   30min later notification saying driver now left food order took total two hours nine minutes instead hour both othe restaurant GrubHub confirmed  Sushi OK but definitely better sushi places better values throughout Vegas   Definitely ordering GrubHub again  fight myself give 1 Star just because sushi wasn't horrible  Just ok  <EOR> This place amazing  visiting CT staying new part Vegas  waitress hotel recommended place which frequented locals  She wrong  Bocho waitress Cindy friendly knew menu well didn't even look it  She described favorite food items said 'yes!' wish knew had  But all sushi fresh tasty  Also some fried chicken which very good but heavy compared sushi   The ambiance very laid back  Reasonably priced  very delicious  <EOR> Went co workers lunch even though only people restaurant food lover 30 minutes come out  Then when did come shrimp skewers raw fried chicken soggy  mention removed sushi soup for  bento box    Fish quality average  customer service atrocious  Many better places real sushi without crappy service overpriced items  <EOR> One best sushi places to  serve within 15 20 minutes  place nice atmosphere  staffs really friendly! wish branch California!
