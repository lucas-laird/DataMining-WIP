Adriana staying Wynn celebrate anniversary opted Grimaldi's first night just because such good experience when town last year exhausted 45 minute flight Burbank    A Lego Store just opened next door K'ayum already heaven  scored last outside table  OK outside 'cause you're mall but outside restaurant  it?

Note self Lego store BEFORE consuming carafe wine    I hear there's location Southern California going look up! But then again Grimaldi's PERFECT excuse Vegas road trip    <EOR> Excellent pizza authentic ambiance server Jamie great!  Prices decent reasonable probably only reason giving 5 star review  <EOR> Grimaldi's very generous birthday gift if email club give large topping pizza free! No other purchase necessary! allow add toppings additional cost $2 4 depending topping  sausage mushroom black olive  also kalamata olive  would preferred kalamata bc sausage wasn't overly salty lot places black olive actually wasn't salty enough    Still overall very tasty pizza  Very thin crisp crust generous toppings sauce while thin very flavorful little sweet   Even though large thin crust still two pieces leftover take home  also reheats really well   The only minus seems only guy pizzas  busy time while still took 25 mins order  <EOR> Best pizza Las Vegas friendly staff great location  place regular stop couple times month  <EOR> I first tried Grimaldi's Brooklyn   Brooklyn location pretty crowded   waited line while enjoy communal seating grumpy Eastern European servers   pizza good but exhausting to  local Grimaldi's great food none annoyances   If insist thick crust Chicago style pizza don't really care people throw your pizza then seriously doing?  some frickin research   But if thin crust pizza high quality ingredients place you     I suggest asking extra cheese   mozzarella always bomb worth every penny   All ingredients high quality end paying more your pizza but imho worth it  <EOR> It Grimaldis  never wrong Pizz place  Create your own brick fired pizza munch antipasto spread just standard pepperoni  Nothing else planet   Service always quick  quality always tops   Always remember tip your server <EOR> What disappointment! Having eaten Brooklyn location huge expectations but fell short    Don't wrong pizza wasn't bad but wasn't great  just OK  crust thin crispy just plate wasn't covered orange grease when done  which another positive    But pizza which started great became increasingly boring piece piece  don't know possible but both sauce crust lost some rather most punch cooled down bit    We ordered  1 2 carafe house red lovely service experienced exceptional  No complaints there    When shopping Boca Park would great stop lunch hubby agreed we'd return Grimaldi's rather usual lunch spot Cheesecake Factory but probably won't planning any dinners again    Oh outside dining fabulous! Very nice little area great people watching  since Vegas such small window 75 degree weather gotta jump find place decent patio  <EOR> Good pizza could used more garlic bottom crispy kinda soggy   eaten Grimaidi's New York fantastic  <EOR> The cheese calzone marinara sauce very cheesy good   also white pizza mushroom sausage pizza big hit  ordered food enjoyed hotel room    We waited bar area 25 30 minutes while order made   bartender consistently checking even though only ordered beer while waiting   Nice little place mall eat family  <EOR> Fun atmosphere great service  Gluten free crust good lots great toppings choose from  Caesar salad tasty small enough four starter salad  Passion fruit iced tea refreshing  <EOR> After 5 hours walking shopping LV Premium Outlets worked big appetite  drive home decided tacos guacamole Chipotle could quick easy dinner but passed newly opened 1 month ago? Grimaldi's Boca Park made last minute decision give pizza spin   We order small house salad $5 large enough feed 3 4 people two plenty green eat  house vinaigrette very vinegary but tomatoes mushrooms fresh whole green olives good quality  order large traditional Grimaldi's pizza onions garlic jalapeños $15 + $2 per topping = $21   wait pizza quick survey pizzas other customers' tables little nervous coal brick oven Grimaldi's over baking crust  Every pizza see restaurant dark brown black burnt crust edges  Thinking take really resilient dough recipe withstand level scorching very impressed if crust actually chewy crispy! pizza shows up  cheese looks great stark white color good Buffalo mozzarella  Bonus fresh basil middle pizza! No visible grease puddles under pizza! Overall topping quantity isn't terribly generous but compared Settebello's 'authentic' i e  totally skimpy pizza topping distribution find no reason complain  first bite any thin crust pizza pray pizza gods crust perfectly 50% crispy 50% chewy  Unfortunately Grimaldi's crust 80% crispy 20% chewy time pizza half eaten 4 slices left stales becomes 100% crispy much crust texture Tombstone frozen pizza  did happen?!  The edge crust unacceptably crunchy flavorless and burnt! second half pizza left wondering wrong pizza does pizza crust take total turn worse only 10 minutes into meal? could easily left 2 pieces togo box next day's lunch but found ourselves better eat it now because it stale situation crust already surprisingly stiff  actually heard crust *snap* all way down middle when folding last slice!   My favorite pizza experiences North America included few special pies Lou Malnati's Chicago Pizzeria Bianco Phoenix John's Pizzeria NYC Frank Pepe's New Haven Pizzeria Rustica Miami   Vegas good luck Metro Pizza Rocco's NY Pizzeria pear gorgonzola arugula proscuitto pizza Sammy's location Sahara consistently tasty choice  respect Grimaldi's could say maybe bad pie but judging dozen other over baked pizzas saw customers' tables think baking time yeast adjustment could really help flavor all crust just needs little chewy tweaking! Service friendly very attentive  Apparently cheesecake Grimaldi's homemade good NYC Stage Deli's    <EOR> Dinner great even though off very bumpy start  waitress total doll super attentive  why able laugh off spilling glass ice water all over tables right beginning  salad supposed come first but salad lady behind oven going fast came same time  waitress brought kids pizza right away even offered remake pizza if didn't want salad same time  offered free dessert water salad issues manager came personally check us  food great love space much better Eastern usually to  <EOR> Went eating SE side town Brooklyn   Overall very good pizza   crust crispy thin nice flavor oven   toppings good flavorful used real mozzerella   kind discinctive look taste it   downside pizza expensive filling   wife split antipasto which excellent large pizza 3 toppings $35   two ate every last piece exactly full   pizza very thin honestly 16 large much two   If appetite need more 1 pie  <EOR> Came Mother's Day two year old friend treat  Never tried place but always wanted to   Service fast friendly brought some play dough literally pizza dough eggless y daughter play with    One thing annoyed but its lots restaurants stuck kid section  real section labeled but know purpose  no coincidence four different groups including use we're sat left back side restaurant  Parents won't bugged other kids guess mentality  ended working though seeing kids eye contact talk keeping another entertained   Pizza good little thin liking but know  authentic style  pesto rich really laid on  Delicious especially once paired sausage top  daughters picky she loved it  Folding pizza half worked kept mess minimum  personal 12 inch fed left two slices leftover came 12 bucks  Pretty good! <EOR> We eat few times month  usually order small Mediterranean salad which feeds two Don   topped sausage pepperoni meatballs  thin crust pizza quality ingredients very tasty     No complaints service ever  There's usually longer wait Fri Sat night don't show starving  <EOR> My wife ate week ago   moment walked door greeted smile  place tops customer service everyone mean everyone VERY friendly helpful  first sat bar while waiting table bartender explained menu seated waiter great manager even came spoke while other customers well  Its cheapest place town pizza but very good customer service OUTSTANDING   drinks appetizers pizzas desert including trio deserts total bill around $70 00  back  <EOR> I personally location over other ones town  really nice outdoor seating area cute water fountain right view  atmosphere calm quite no overly loud obnoxious either  But if always sit inside if weather unbearable  There's bar area watching game and boyfriend glued always twice far each time service great! attentive watching sure drinks filled give boyfriend updates foods  second came pizza ordered took little longer boyfriend's  brought mine took another 5 10 minutes longer  Normally would've kinda peeved but server came apologized even offered reheat boyfriend's pizza because he waited mine come!  call quality service!

Really??!! obvious instead telling he didn't know margherita pizza server wanted b s  me  point he suggested try both pies  Against better judgment along him  Needless say both pies wrong  most interesting two pies east coast pie which did basil it $40 worth! Since experience made trip Brooklyn original Grimaldi's where knew exactly Margherita pizza is  Must some sort disconnect between mothership franchises     all being said Grimaldi's does serve good pie worth trip  serve always good wine list some nice choices well  Just remember if want margherita pizza write down instructions made! East coast west coast!! <EOR> I pretty high expectations coming location mostly upheld but wanted better  The pizza pretty solid but service lacking little bit  I showed earlier rest party Thursday lunch sat bar drank ice cold glass water morning round golf  heard manager talking saying he giving table first timers comped order canolis When seated outside beautiful great  hostess offered iced tea water maybe Peroni She didn't ask if first time offer describe menu prices try upsell anything appetizer garlic bread salads  decided split large ladies group gonna split small pizza small still plenty share  girls also decided split small caesar salad  ordered everything normal  pizza took little longer anticipated being very thin crust very beginning lunch hour but came nicely proportioned plenty meatballs onions plenty ricotta cheese pepperonis other  pepperoni nice spicy meatballs full flavor nice large too  When came time ask if everything going well clear plates checks hell where service lacked  server disappeared good 10 12 minutes when done eating took long time check clear credit card back sign   other things bugs Grimaldis each topping least $2 4 personal cheese pizza starts $10 large $18  If large 2 toppings you're already looking $24+ just pizza  Add two drinks salad you're looking $45 tip lunch   Also kinda place doesn't serve ranch? asked side ranch dip crust when pizza came she said don't even serve restaurant  salad menu serve ranch? America right? love ranch dressing  Disappointing 3 stars probably try again but probably soon since 25 mins away house <EOR> A large pizza definitely big enough share 2 I think something density if base   Even though thin crispy base   tastes thick dense   just really filling! although burnt oily still tasty   ours pepperoni mushroom onion tomato based sauce use yummo   We'll back! <EOR> Grimaldis pizza always good  expensive however but if sign online give free large pizza your birthday  nice atmosphere pizza delicious  personally love ricotta cheese meatball pizza most  <EOR> We stumbled over place decided try out  Very open layout everyone super friendly  concept pretty straight forward  pick your size sauce then choose your toppings  little anxious seeing some prices toppings $2 pepperoni $4 Italian sausage etc but received order made sense  pizza incredible portions generous  wife could only eat 1 piece sheer determination ate 2 remember sticker shock? determined worth it!   ordering 18 4 toppings pepperoni black olives sundried tomatoes Italian sausage 3 drinks bill came $50  worth we'll back future <EOR> If pizzeria passes young munchers taste test good pizza  seen young kid pack away much pizza before life!

The first thing you'll notice neat looks inside  Wine bottle chandeliers various accouterments adorning walls  rather odd business model  base pizza includes dough sauce  Yes  right   cheese topping  Rather silly way justify charging more money your customers  would preferred pay same amount cheese built into base price pizza  least wouldn't felt intelligence being insulted  Although suppose possible might some lactose intolerant customers take advantage opportunity cheese pizza     Anyway you'll also find price starts rack rather quickly begin adding toppings your creation which you'll simply place this  chose mushrooms meatballs pepperoni  quality ingredients apparent  meatballs juicy flavorful definitely frozen crap came factory  tomatoes sauce allegedly organic did find sauce full flavored  mushrooms also tasty chewy delight  cheese takes some getting used to  Ricotta pizza cheese definitely unusual choice but did enjoy meal over all  lack grease plus  also really liked way watch them put all together  pepperoni kick seemed something might find nice Italian deli rather Pizza hut   The originality place combined quality ingredients certainly merit return but falls short five star experience  <EOR> Bomb spot  Great pizza  Bring NE good find me  Yummy pizza Devine <EOR> No wasn't choice pizza  Underwhelming usual  Only great thing Tuesdays 1 2 off bottle wine  <EOR> Even though lived Las Vegas few years first time eaten any Grimaldi's spots  sad haven't eaten sooner because pizza delicious  don't really care type pizza authentic may may be  only thing really care tastes  pie mighty good   We started mediocre  small Mediterranean salad $7   large enough three four   The pizza tried small white garlic $16 two toppings pepperoni mushrooms $2 each   crust excellent decent amount charred expected brick oven place  Even all cheese pepperoni pizza bottom crust held well wasn't soggy providing crisp crackling texture every bite   The small pizza more medium large enough two share  personal pizza others would consider small   The most annoying thing place toppings same price no matter size pizza get  Obviously you're going more pepperoni example if large pizza  But if personal pizza less but pay same price  pies aren't cheap when start adding toppings price ridiculous   I'm sure back location just because finding parking Boca Park always hassle  But stop another Grimaldi's spot pizza fix  <EOR> I eyeing Grimaldi's while  Feeling pizza glad Grimaldi's came mind  Parking bit chore but usually parking lot  wait table short 5 minutes  dining area inside smaller then expected can't even imagine trying come Friday Saturday night experience long wait    We started off small Antipasto   $9  really liked fresh mozzarella whole thing general  easily shared between 2 people  pizza decided custom  ricotta mozzarella cheese sausage meatballs  only thin pizza since NY style  crust thin but crisp held toppings well  did enjoy meatball sausage but much meat eater did end picking lot toppings off people party wanted meat wanted cheese ahhhh compromise next time would probably personal pizza just cheeses  pizza cooked using coal brick oven  total $37 antipasto pizza 3 sodas  didn't think bad all!

But supposed known pizza's? If crazy really good pizza come just experience guess! <EOR> I odd experience Grimaldi's  never meal start star level then gradually slip into another star dimension  If taken hot bite jumped write review would probably given pie solid 4 stars but happened  pizza slowly became hot rather cold mess    The place cute old wine bottle chandeliers  bottoms cut bulbs contained within bottle  clustered around ceiling quite fascinating  took minute server show greet some reason Saturday evening being stickler service bothered bit  quite possible brightness wine bottle chandeliers made hypersensitive  bar area might more comfortable   We ordered small salad large pizza onion garlic jalapeno  Based scent profile pretty obvious already man  small salad huge good value $5  dressing wasn't standout lacked vinegary punch! Then pie arrived  other local pie joints underwhelmed volume toppings  might start showing own  Just start pulling baggies onions mushrooms purse  Anyways first slice pizza great  sauce little sweet crust tad crispy but still good chew  No burnt edges which meant ate all crust  However pizza started cold crust became stale    Perhaps yeast oil deprivation  pizza least greasy pizza quite some time but would trade stale pizza big ol' greasy pizza any day week  Maybe weak dough day am revisit but now 3 44 star deal which sadly requires rounding down  <EOR> Tried Summerlin location   expensive pizza    pay toppings   Veggie toppings $4 00 $3 00 meat toppings  husband don't same toppings tried order 1 2 side 1 2 other side   charge full price still each topping even if only 1 2 pizza    Pizza looked large but filling due thin crust   small two toppings set back $16 00 bucks   shopping Fashion Show mall friends wanted try place   4 calzone's 4 sodas later set back $91 00 without tip   Ouch   Could gone upstairs food court same items payed 1 3 payed tasteless calzone  <EOR> Love love love   pizza great   Perfectly Thin crust   Well made   whole family loves pizza too   Location great inside boca park very convenient  If weather nice sit patio overlooking boca park   If reduce price little would much more often! <EOR> Excellent food  Ok service  felt nice restaurant didn't any servers  took forever someone come could order  Once did order no ever checked if needed refills anything else  food absolutely amazing good! service pretty blah  would probably back location try different location better service  Don pizza die for!

There's very pretty fountain front outdoor patio seating which great during nice weather   interior somewhat dimly lit but  actually relaxing hot Vegas days   decor well designed  there's tables along  few booths tucked there     The pizza thin crust tend more thick crust person however thin crust nicely executed just enough crunch but tough chewy   expected bit more oven smokey coal baked flavor little disappointing although huge drawback  sauce okay every now then sauce tasted somewhat meat sauce you'd put  spaghetti rather typical  pizza sauce but nevertheless good   some people pointed cheese habit coming off bite rather sticking crust   Again huge drawback just tad annoying   Let's put way better pizza also lot worse Grimaldi's certainly provides pizza  worth checking out   I also ordered in house cannolli   seems case cannolli most isn't very memorable filling didn't stand any particular flavor   contains mini chocolate chips which tasty  mainly taste cannolli   won't hold against them though because say most cannolli some reason seems run mill   recommendation  would  try different dessert such  seasonal cheesecakes tiramisu    They also serve wine beer although didn't try any those offerings   Service outstanding professional friendly helpful   FIVE STAR that!    I very  happy opportunity try Grimaldi's if when trek  second try would more adventurous pizza toppings per some suggestions other posters   Bottom line if you're looking visually pleasing nicely upscale area pizza located Boca Park  friends family spot would certainly consider check out! <EOR> Since moving vegas last year wife found place  If new york style pizza love place  good  Seriously  swear crack sauce addicting   Last time wife kale salad dang good  straight pepperoni best  Margherita decent  Canollis amazing just big enough  <EOR> Smelled pretty good she walk pepperoni sausage jalapeño yummy sure   Also pepperoni mush room   remember jn ny but pretty yummy yum yum if gun pizza <EOR> Came dad  birthday coupon large topping pizza  Ordered few beers 2 salads side  Everything came delicious even left overs  seated outside because full inside  Even heaters bit cold  Other no complaints  Thanks <EOR> Been multiple times never bad experience   pizza while bit pricey never dissapoints  salads very tasty too  <EOR> If pizza calzones salad looking place   Thin crust allows enjoy cheese toppings   Personal salad could easily feed three if ordering personal pizza along it   Sorry couldn't fit dessert   limited selection   Staff great hostess server anyone else helped     <EOR> Great pizza!!

Great piz <EOR> Tried reserve table two  informed only accept reservations four  Hung pulled Yelp Dom Demarco's clicked reservation two  Presto!  We're in   Hey Grimaldi Stupid stupid does  <EOR> Now most college students pizza something eat regular  Maybe slice Metro Pizza cheap $5 00 Little Ceasars but often place wanting more just your average slice  Grimaldi's Pizzeria place more average slice!  We decided visit Grimaldi's brief business meeting didn't run quite brief planned  considered going Monta refer past review great experience but based size group decided somewhere little more open would more suitable  member group mentioned Grimaldi's great place some pizza took vote Grimaldi's came top   Once arrived pleasantly surprised decor  place really gave off classy vibe while still being comfortable fun  chandeliers weren't diamond gold empty wine bottles talk inventive! older pictures framed wall really made feel place something authentic going which suppose did  only design flaw came mind group only restroom both genders  really much issue when busy but I'd imagine unhappy line people during high business hours   Now whats first thing look sit down restaurant? Many people might say table case you're probably right  But first things take good look menu  menu night first little confusing  Grimaldi's don't list pre built pizza every pizza built order  three types base pizza  traditional pizza white garlic pizza pesto  Following list toppings including items fresh cut tomatoes meatballs even anchovies  Knowing menu bit daunting waitress very quick inform everyone table ordering process went  only very helpful quite entertaining well  staff excellent very knowledgeable menu  waitress also helped decide would split check before ordered which great because most places we're left end 5 people need pay card no pre arranged plan so ever   Being new place side table decided try something don't usually see menu  opted Large 18 in  white garlic pizza Meatballs Italian sausage sun dried tomatoes artichoke hearts  wait food little long but understandable considering table far ordered 3 large completely custom pizzas  pizza arrived amazing  toppings tasted quite fresh flavor fantastic  crust enjoyable cheese stringy delicious just it  standard condiments table parmesan crushed red pepper but also joined few others garlic powder  Each pizza cut into 8 pieces since 6 people check decided good idea order second   The second pizza ordered large Pesto grilled chicken roasted sweet red peppers freshly sliced tomatoes  If haven't eaten pesto pizza before maybe Grimaldi's should where having dinner tonight pizza amazing  full flavor fresh pieces chicken complimented flavorful pesto while sweet red pepper really brought balance whole ensemble  waitress told people order combinations similar see why did disappoint least   Grimaldi's Pizzeria bit pricey side average large pizza build comes around $30 00 each but when break down each person bad  Grimaldi's over all great experience definitely good place if you're looking more average slice pizza want daring your choices  <EOR> Love eating pizza here    Always large pizza meatball mushrooms! overload topping cause thin crust soggy!
