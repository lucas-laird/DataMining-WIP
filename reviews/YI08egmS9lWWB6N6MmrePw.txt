So recently came horrible experience  Mind am regular teriyaki madness customer  Maybe much location  But come very least once week  Because closest location home  anyways horrible bowl made week ago so  thought horrible  But making 1 star rant review  yelp  owner location Randy messaged it  going back forth him  Instead just taking bad customer writing off loss he seeking solution     A couple days later he messaged saying He using different chicken other location almost every day using  Keep mind guys just update fairly location Sahara Decatur already using   He forward figured problem calling owner Robert Sahara Decatur location just find going Causing think bowl wasn't cooked fresh etc      So end result keeping review short possible  give Randy taking step figure going fixing issue having  He took care bill dinner tonight saying try new updated chicken all locations now using  Just he approval satisfaction    *People don't wait times   * BUT say everything menu cooked FRESH  Therefore everything tastes amazing!! give waiting times some slack because couple extra minutes wait guarantee worth it! Also hopefully Randy doesn't kill saying but giving option add avocado bowls plates beginning 2018!! Now  cherry top amazing food already serve! Please if haven't ever tried TERIYAKI MADNESS  Please give place try! won't ever look back!!

I call ask speak manager some lady accent heavy she barely understands me  5 minutes going back forth she says 'bring food back they'll cook another one'  Why should drive ALL way back because your mistake? tell am unable that  She then tells she'll call boss see if she refund  She calls back much later says ok come down pick money    I paid card   I'm going drive down cash when void sale and or credit card back  I know fact doable because worked restaurants 10+years told wasn't going drive down just void credit card back  She says OK no problem   Fast forward week   still charged card  call speak manager Robert tell situation  He proceeds repeat himself talk idiot  He tells he give discount next meal  serious? He says he refund money because didn't leave house bring food down there  piece work  ask speak boss he directs teriyaki madness website  He wouldn't provide any phone number  then he hangs me   Be careful if eat here  food quality SUPER inconsistent  food poisoning once nearly again  manager rude unprofessional  <EOR> My Usual Teriyaki Plate noodles macaroni salad    It's fast food super dee duper goonie goo goo good!

Don't know if return location  Might drive Maryland Pkwy Silverado Ranch old neighborhood  <EOR> I ordered spicy teriyaki chicken plate  great charred taste kick spiciness  did teriyaki sauce because strong ginger but did chicken overall  edamame perfectly cooked    crispy tasty  lot places tend overcook theirs soft  very happy this  It's great quick bite  But don't expect anything more  dropped star because thought it'd better mall chicken teriyaki  <EOR> A little more expensive think warranted  Noodles good forgot ask add veggies she didn't ask  <EOR> For chain place pretty decent  love Crab Rangoons Pot Stickers  staff friendly service quick  dining area super clean TVs  mine go  visit first looked good place eat type food  think Teriyaki Madness moving forward  definitely back  <EOR> I love place!  Great quick but healthy alternative standard fast food Chinese take out  always same thing    but delicious     why mess perfection?   Spicy chicken bowl brown rice veggies side edamame   Yum! <EOR> I'd say Teriyaki Madness better Teriyaki fast food joints around   offer variety meats chicken pork beef teriyaki chicken katsu orange chicken    food isn't really authentic Asian anything but sure beats Panda Express!  My favs beef chicken teriyaki   say grill everything perfection they're sort right?  Everything always cooked pretty good!  never dry very flavorful   teriyaki sauce really good perfect consistency   also getting mac salad   better just getting plain garden lettuce salad side     If trying eat healthy pretty good option quick meal   Just chicken breast sauce side brown rice veggies   Done!  I also love gyoza's   kind small but bad deal less 3 bucks   Their plates around 7 8 bucks bowls around 6   Quality food but kind pricey   kind add if try customizing your meal brown rice veggie add ons etc   portions aren't exactly huge anything each plate just enough person IMO   2 people you're looking spend least 20 bucks dinner which kind lot fast food   If price would give more star!  This particular location Warm Springs pretty nice compared used frequent Eastern Maryland   Its clean service quick nice  Always keep eye coupons groupons    always see coupons newspaper online  <EOR> Food always satisfying hits spot  Chicken katsu bomb!
