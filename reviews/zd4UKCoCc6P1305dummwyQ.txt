But most egregious during meal   good waiter waitress knows interject see if need something   two girls restaurant really strange habit hanging near table until all three stopped talking look direction because creepy staring   Then instead don't know asking if needed more water?  would comment conversation   tried polite but third fourth time started making things them more water tea soda napkins just could continue conversation   helped much    It such relief when other patrons came busy hover     The food good enough take orders but most certainly won't eating again   Creepy  <EOR> Cute restaurant food mediocre authentic   I guess place caters gringo palates  ordered samosas which pretty good  naan bit lacking flavor  Myself companion familiar Indian cuisine ordered matar paneer vegetable kofta  Food wasn't bad but lacking spice deep traditional indian flavor  disappointing specifically requested food very spicy  rest party ordered lamb korma chicken tikka masala generally pleased liked food milder side   The owner acted waiter stingy rice  He brought bowl five people gaped when asked more mid dinner service  being greedy but size cereal bowl  when most indian restaurants give serving bowl He then proceeded bring  half cereal bowl full rice then said ok guys all have   REALLY   He then paced around restaurant then glared until left  I understand came hour before closing which annoying most restaurant staff but also two other couples dining  Way your message across  want f*ck out  Noted   So quickly finished left  Needless say returning  better Indian Food backwoods North Carolina    Service  fast food ok pinch if you're desperate  But Indian Curry Bowl Indian food Taco Bell Mexican food  <EOR> Service good fast  Food great owner suggested korma because never tried did disappoint  <EOR> We take pretty good Las Vegas indian food   3 different dishes each them delicious   nan okay garlic nan could used little more garlic   Overall good though   Check if area  <EOR> Service awful!! mean owner should not Be serving place  He rude just grumpy  love previous person owner should building! food excellent though ill back  <EOR> Yea curry naan good but way overpriced dishes  Service also slow  <EOR> I craving indian food evening favorite indian restaurant North Las vegas Saffron still temporarily closed   really heading Fresh Easy pick few items when spotted Indian Curry Bowl   curious place while looked reviews Yelp   remembered microwave issues yet man thought having large table inside good sign   thought having only 1 table 6pm Saturday bad sign   To long story short ordered vegetable samosa lamb samosa salty lassi chai garlic naan sweet sour curry  way no longer serve curry bowls  Right ordered heard microwave on   okay probably water chai  microwave 3 times   Now please understand kitchen open   If did cook anything fresh would hear so   Nobody cooked anything fresh   microwave did all cooking   salty lassi only item made fresh  chai tea bag  chicken curry tandoori chicken cut chunks strange   samosas lacked flavor dry   chutneys okay  Again used microwave cook   As bill well charged garlic naan never made table   time ordered only table being served   time bill 1 2 tables total 4 people    man called over said never naan   He looked around table sure because he didn't remember if he made naan  Really?    Using microwave cook=1 star <EOR> Ok place really good food!  portions huge but 'enough'   said its little pricey most items run $12 $15   dining room very dark walls orange its really style  service friendly food comes pretty fast  <EOR> First few times  tried place liked usually order which chicken korma curry rice naan    I'd only when I'd urging curry bc neighborhood but I'd spend easy $20 even just small lunch always thought overpriced      I pleased see lunch buffet 9 95 during week 12 95 weekends   twice now each time little bit every item which all nicely flavored   Both times finished everything plate super happy  spending $20 weekend buffet drink tip worth bc try everything instead just item same price      Service ambiance always little lack luster but must reading reviews bc old man no where found wife super welcoming friendly attentive bus boy help out   think need some nice Indian music playing kill monotony    But  glad still open neighborhood!    I'd recommend trying buffet during week best deal  <EOR> Great buffet lunch  Must try butter chicken rice  <EOR> It's 2 months since last visited Indian Curry Bowl sad say because quality food seriously gone down   Back approximately year ish ago bomb   thought owner Andy funny sarcastic grumpy old man   Rita wife would come ask food was   sad read he's coming across grumpy condescending definitely see why     In last few visits gone now consistency   No more fantastically flavorful curries yes portion sizes getting smaller   Even naan comes soggy   Conclusion Please bring back tasty Indian Curry Bowl knew well  <EOR> Food mediocre best   Chicken tikka masala creamy very little chicken no real flavor  Saag paneer relly runny cheese tough  naan good   but screw naan?   Severely overpriced   owner acted he doing favor prices said he new menus already printed higher prices    I definitely returning  <EOR> We back January   service really slow  food ok but very small portions price don't big servings!  cook better Indian food home  <EOR> There Indian restaurants simply don't visit twice maybe they're quite style service poor ignore  then Indian Curry Bowl Indian restaurant bad turn into Neil deGrasse Tyson  want grab people street yell 'Have heard this?!'
