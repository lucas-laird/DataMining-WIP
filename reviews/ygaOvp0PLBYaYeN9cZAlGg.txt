Going group great way explore many menu items without filling just couple items    Believe solid Chicken Pho those aren't fond Oxtail tendon other mystery meats your pho  also try each grilled spring rolls which okay also tried mix grill assortment which fun but could little awkward where you're situated even dangerous hot splattering oil when excess liquid raw meat seafood comes contact oil  CAREFUL!!!  The Lotus Salad Banh Xeo Vietnamese Crepe other very delicious options try  Service spotty first visit but much better waiter second visit Tallest Asian waiter glasses speaks perfect English another visit ordered Bo Luc Lac Shaking Beef Red Rice pretty good generous portion well  menu dessert selections look slim but waiter nice point other dessert items front cash register  Vietnamese Coffee Float I call Vietnamese Affogato 0 great way end your meal lookout expansion dessert items future!

Well forget place  taste spices you'll probably wonder much put why other places don't same but believe when say pho amazing  <EOR> At point thought gonna many friends all pho taste same ugh  becoming true lackluster bowls noodles most joints  Then District came along spot adds some love each bowl smile face satisfied belly but service pretty terrible became hard back often  Fast forward year Viet Noodle Bar opens same family runs District One  Focused more traditional styles Vietnamese cuisine but same amount love D1   Like ramen pho made bones if your lips aren't glistening deconstructed bone marrow then might slurping soup blocks  Using soup blocks pretty easy some places offer $5 95 price point  Although its bit pricey VNB they're shorting portion size especially if you're meat lover load bowl maybe much ! Bun thit nuong great alternative when you're feeling soup pretty much Vietnamese pasta salad grilled pork best fish sauce    VNB definitely isn't messing around its food SNHD wins cleanest Vietnamese restaurant award  Can't give same award service though lunch service fairly disconnected its dinner service  Regardless its bo approved back all winter long  <EOR> Wait time out  San Jose? Vietnam? really Vegas eating GRADE VIETNAMESE FOOD! Absolutely loved place food cleanliness service!
