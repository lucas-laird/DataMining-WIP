So    know authentic NY Chinese Food should taste having grown wasn't it    even close!  I ordered several items off menu all equally terrible! No flavor extremely bland small portions pay  pricey just NY but don't serve much worth money  food tasted stale weird chicken beef tasted old also    Oh place charged 2 dollars extra delivery total $4 00 saying area when only 0 3 miles guy showed scooter     WOW!!!!!
