The only thing improve another location closer strip  <EOR> I two times week Pure Bowl almost every time   obviously love but occasionally frozen chunks berries did bet blended   understand organic fresh etc angle but very pricey   Almost $12 Acai Bowl   Again really good but pay it   would more frequent visitor if bit more affordable     All aside place great Acai Bowl all Las Vegas  <EOR> I'm happy place opened! Mint Chip smoothie amazing! love hummus bowl well  healthy drive through Las Vegas genius! <EOR> I finally ventured off try Fruits Roots glad did 3 times just week  quality ingredients definitely high organic healthy which market   offer acai bowls fresh pressed juices superfood smoothies bowls wraps food    So far only tried Chicken Gyro Wrap but good haven't wanted try anything else! Grilled chicken chickpeas feta red onion romaine lettuce Greek yogurt dressing  acai bowls incredibly refreshing love smoothies  detox smoothie 'different' flavor think due ginger green tea mixed fruit honest but weird flavors still enjoy it  gummy bear most popular banana kale coconut pineapple all ties together really well healthy yet flavorful boost   The only downfall place opinion price  completely understand pay but 2 smoothies 2 wraps $50  all fresh ingredients but  little absurd!  They drive thru which convenient restaurant inside very clean  <EOR> I FLUSH JUICE AMAZING  The cease salad really good   They just opened last behind counter making salad extremely slow   But now regular juice bar !! <EOR> Chicken Gyro wrap world mango bar acai bowl where amazing   Can't wait back! <EOR> Fruits Roots just okay  probably won't returning unless already happen area some reason   I ordered Sweet Greens juice Earth açaí bowl comes fruit toppings   Both pretty much expected typical juice bar but higher prices most places been  açaí bowl average size 10 oz so but $10 50 seemed all bowls around $9 11  juices around $8 50   When visited Fruits Roots relatively empty complex only two other customers inside  Despite still took more 15 minutes prepare açaí bowl  juices already glass bottles don't require any prep time  main reasons juice bars frequently convenience  If takes long wait açaí bowl could home  seemed fairly standard fruit granola toppings well    Overall quality didn't justify price opinion  Also if stopping somewhere grab something don't particularly anticipate want wait 20 minutes especially given store essentially empty  can't imagine long might take if more crowd  probably continue going Pressed Juicery instead higher quality more unique ingredient combinations faster service similar price point  <EOR> I wanting try place since first building  finally today father  no before lunch time  island bowl father detox smoothie  dad loved drink enjoyed island bowl  can't wait try other items menu  used drive all way summerlin pitaya bowl  now spot delicious refreshing meal drink way closer home  <EOR> I now 5 times love all different juices bowls tried   Everything really fresh actually tastes great!

Maybe being sensitive but if better attitude wouldn't feel way  She made 'Island Bowl' well when finished she just handed turned around walked away    The bowl pretty but taste whatever  feel healthy eating though  pitaya tasted bland fruits didn't look fresh  bananas some brown strawberries dull  Thinking toppings just top tried finish rest pitaya bottom  However entire bowl filled granola bites making dry  might come back try juices out   but all bottled pre made before freshly blended juice prefer   UPDATE did come back give place second try  experience quality better last  <EOR> What bright happy spot! welcomed sweet smell house made freshly baked granola  most delicious granola adorned perfect Acai Earth Bowl  fresh excellent! Island bowl fantastic too  Very bright refreshing  Even though menu says comes blueberries doesn't  Heads cold pressed juice also perfectly balanced refreshing made cells dance    They also offer beautiful made order salads without meat  Dressings also made house too  also offer excellent variety nutrient dense smoothies     On occasion atmosphere pleasant inviting 70 80's music good volume not blasting still good conversation  Sadly another occasion music blasting EDM music rap music  Doesn't seem appropriate healing environment  certain days some staff friendly generous smiles other days no greeting no thank you  Little better training needed Thus 4 stars instead 5    If crave organic goodies brighten soul your spot  <EOR> I stumbled upon perfect spot yesterday couldn't more pleased!!! food absolutely delicious!
