Seriously exact type pizza looking for!  crust perfect slices large thin sauce actually really good! large cheese pie 14 99! bad considering casino plus dinning credits Palms pie only 5 36! Woot!  I also tried garlic knots which 5 1 99 didn't pay attention see looked first but once home opened them theyre basically small bread knots    small though  Lol  your typical knot! aight   The pizza def fave far search pie finally found wasn't 20+ dollars!  I sure back even mind paying full price! Also customer service awesome! guys both super nice helpful!  Yay! <EOR> I usually order garlic knots    can't eat without them  hesitant order meatball sandwich because thought might taste generic  wrong    it actually tasted better then most  reason liked much because toasted whole sandwich  wasn't most places where meatballs hot bread cold   really good! may menu item now on! <EOR> I grew often survived NY style pizza   spent 4 years away NYC region found myself spending few months Las Vegas   During first week Palms putzing around casino   hungry just checked food court   Thought would give place shot   enjoyed taste very much   don't know if tasted better since deprived NY pizza several years what   worked near Palms during time rest stay Vegas probably hit place once week lunch  <EOR> This some really good fast food pizza! garlic knots amazing coated garlicky butter  also tried pepperoni cheese stromboli which simple yet tasty  great place grab quick bite when you're Palms casino  <EOR> Was good come back more later same night  could've gone back third fourth time  would suggest getting least 2 slices once   The price isn't great but expect Palms?  The staff nice  <EOR> The pizza great flavors cheese just melted sauce awesome  service great slices pretty big $4 slice  <EOR> I don't know happened but pizza isn't good use be  last time bring back entire pie carry out   My son didn't see pizza before taking home  Once home opened see bright red cheese pizza!

Needless say Mike stuck crazy story he wasn't last night he didn't talk son last night new cook last night! This entire Red Pizza Pie sick mystery Mike claiming he's innocent anything everything! The truth nothing but truth definitely lacking FAMIGLIA PIZZERIA <EOR> While getting tuna melt over Earl Sandwich boyfriend popped over pick some grub   He decided pepperoni stromboli garlic knots  food ok also small portion over priced course considering located casino food court  Even MC Donald's 20% higher stand alone stores   I tried garlic knot impressed much prefer those villa pizza which more true garlic knot   My boyfriend hungry long good vote food portion price ratio!  It just ok however returning any time soon if all  much more flavor bang buck elsewhere  <EOR> The location pretty good  located Palms food court  pizza heated pretty quick  ordered 2 slices done pretty quick  am really sure long pizza sitting but oven pretty quick  pizza pretty good but don't know if $5 slice good  <EOR>
