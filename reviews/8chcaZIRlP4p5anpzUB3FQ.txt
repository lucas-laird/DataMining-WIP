Please adjust let your restaurant restaurant quinceanera favorite color teal  Okay no  most important food clearly is   We glanced over menu saw some awesome looking things  Lady table next great looking frittata style dish that  But first saw Scone clotted cream jam  bounced idea since love European baked goods fact came clotted cream epic! Well waitress suggests heat scone because cream gross top  top? Cream side traditionally served asked? No she said  Okay took suggestion  Scone comes no clotted cream jam triangular flat hard glaze over it  Ummmm wtf? zero any scones clotted cream jam  try fork almost broke off  Hard rock  Literally  could throw against wall  tell waitress no cream jam hard rock want trade out  She's confused  Says she bring cream cheese jam  What?!  clotted cream  now dreams warm scone clotted cream which if you're wondering point we'll divine  smooth spreadable slightly sweetened marriage whipped cream butter  Usually served cold next warm scone  now see why bummed  ask chocolate croissant because now really wanting feed pastry hankering if restaurant going display case great pastries well trying  She brings then only then offers warm it  Uhh ya doesn't want warm pastry? returns warm try stick fork yet again stale hard gross  WHYYYYYY?????? offering such great pastries your menu but they've refrigerated hard rocks?! Then served nothing described menu? Come on  Okay just appetizer which point eaten neither  dish comes served small side salad which identify yummy raspberry dressing local grocery store  Definitely homemade   three things eaten now clearly freshly made restaurant  made there? eat quiche frittata dish hmmm damn    no luck here  egg just straight mush  full liquid worried even edible  hungry though favors good but texture just gross  fully cooked  completely struck never return  Such bummer because seemed cute chic menu  really gotta hit drawing boards again before serving another dish  <EOR> My new spot!   doggies loved service here    no doggie menu bring your own treats but bring water bowl    coffee smooth strong bitter   turkey sandwich which fresh   Love avocado smash bread   friend Ceasar Salad    it generously loaded cheese he requested bacon rather chicken accommodated  Also ingredients fresh organic     While service great! more impressed owner coming asking if everything ok he warmly greeted dogs  <EOR> The food tasty but service terribly slow  waited over 50 minutes food  During wait saw least three tables walked because long wait  claimed only cook but first all excuse customers problem kept taking customers which couldn't afford help  Obviously owner wasn't experienced business he would try seat 4 people when he wasn't even getting table ready them  piece advice leave plenty time wait  <EOR> The food ok  Portions small side price  Expensive breakfast  small omelet $11 50 came w 1 piece toast small salad  Another person waffle yes 1 waffle cut into fourths  fruit extra $10 50+  Nothing side unless ordered sides menu  Coffee great  service slow disorganized waited forever coffee refill food sat counter while chef tried server's attention took forever check  room very unpleasant smell sure  about  <EOR> My girlfriend decided try place last week disappointed!

Give them shot! <EOR> I tell food DID look photos    Came lunch being only table raised some concerns  French toast madam sandwich  sandwich tasted cheap biscuits gravy but maybe just spoiled Paris? But bechamel really grainy texture just basic ham  French toast good but nothing brag mention wasn't any guava cream cheese menu advertises    The pictures really made want come unfortunately most likely won't coming back    On next food venture! <EOR> Unusual name unusually tasty eats! Another cute new breakfast lunch option Vegas creative menu Hawaiian influence  Breakfast Special riffing chicken waffles Lunch Special salmon! unique options several flavors textures prevent food FOMO  If you're into sweets side guava cream cheese which tastiest version come across! Prices couple bucks higher warranted but food itself solid  Avoid acai yogurt bowls    Bring friend catch because other reviews mention place runs island time lengthy wait times typical  two different visits just lady serving hostess server food runner busser which bit much any person but especially difficult during busier weekend hours  Check Groupon Yelp deal before visiting knock off couple bucks  <EOR> Great place good service excellent food   allow dogs too   great time!!
