Avoid place!! servers punks! <EOR> A few friends decided stop some food  Naturally  When first shown seats weren't given menus  asked if non all eat menu weren't given either  just ordered some bulgogi  regular order water  Finally time pay  friends gotten all eat totals came around $28 00  However single plate bulgogi came $38 00  Why did pay extra thing when could just payed less multiple servings bulgogi  Personally would again simply because prices having menu prices single servings  However bulgogi great  $38 00 great? much  <EOR> We table 15 service sucked  waitress checked very little during time all plates stacking end table  refills also took long time  Even order more food <EOR> We ate dinner service bad because kept walking past hard attention the food bad but service is and end dinner when check noticed gratuity added automatically what hell!there only 3 us 2 adult child we going tip anyway but then adding gratuity mad i would understand if more but 3 people  so regardless tip anyway lol never going back ever again and recommend it! <EOR> I'd say 3 5 stars lol Like mean food good all but fact charge 18% gratuity parties 5 LESS! bs group 15 split into 3 tables know? charged    The service alright  seated took time ask if ready order giving menu    If someone does please please read menu bottom  They charge gratuity parties 5 less guessing show fck load people order service charge   There's also 3 different menus  Nevada 15 95 Locals 19 95 And think vegas 25 95   The selections alright prices but mean rather somewhere else told only certain selection certain amount money   The signs restaurant also old told new management therefore everything else restaurant old being managed someone else semi old policies <EOR> As soon enter restaurant bad service begins  doesn't end there  Here's break down parties seated random order don't keep track came when there's good chance you'll wait longer people just walked in if order English as did you'll probably ignored but if order Korean as husband did chance they'll least write your order down though won't actually bring all it's nearly impossible drink refills also difficult servers bring essentials chopsticks straws napkins table if clear already worth noting servers inefficient unfriendly say least but despite bad service most shocking part **THERE'S AUTOMATIC GRATUITY PARTIES TWO** maybe because service rarely warrants any tips? In end disappointment because food good but service perhaps worst ever experienced  <EOR> Eve server fantastic   coming decade love it   Located Chinatown park walk second floor where also amazing bakery dessert if room Korean BBQ     The menu simple food fresh server does all work cooking grill your table so tip well    If you're new Korean BBQ then highly recommend place!

The brisket fantastic  bulgogi delicious  spicy chicken amaze balls! really enjoyed side dishes too  Service okay  owners really nice hospitable! When your grill gets dirty replace you  Everything near perfect   The only reason why didn't give full on five star review because service slow   didn't give rice tongs grill hot  mention constantly asked water re fills  service deducted star review  Also when pay cashier guy rudely looked said Umm   doesn't include tip  ___ seriously? know  read  shouldn't ASK tip your customers     Other rude guy server mishaps night still would eat place  owners kind food delicious!  I MUST ADD can't AYCE KBBQ unless there's two you  Bummer know  <EOR> The low star reviews aren't warranted    People complaining waiters take forever put food grill? universe in? cook your own food ayce kbbq!   People complaining 15% autograt? 15% pretty low! planning tipping?   90 minute limit eat? Welcome every AYCE ever including Stations Casinos 2hr limit  There's no ventilation?

Honestly other reviewers some heavy nonsense    Went 9 9 16 Friday night around 8 45 pm having 90 min + wait Tofu Hut Magal Gen etc  called Korean Garden asked wait time was  no wait starts $16 95 dinner  sold   Walked in  Pretty basic looking looks decent  While menu smaller other places thought great cheapest option doesn't include seafood  don't eat seafood why pay extra dishes weren't going order anyway? Anywhere brisket pork belly whatever available marinated  Bulgogi $20 menu stuck marinated pork  also steamed eggs which came fast!  Service fine  kept food coming changed grills quickly without asking  more expensive places asked various items multiple times waiters forgetting  didn't experience Korean Garden    Ignore garbage reviews place fine lack wait takes over  top  <EOR> I love going place  two AYCE options cheaper option costs bit more but more selection  Both decently priced might add  cuts meat pretty awesome always chose more options shrimp soup everything delicious  servers great too! They're always attentive sweet  <EOR> I am sorry am type even give star but place most rudest place world! service horrible server rude mean! there's no common sense when they're bringing meat two people expect eat big plate food!!!! <EOR> I've numerous times never really problem until last visit  restaurant LOT open seating  never time where wait seated  nothing special place really stuck me  Food average  Customer service lacked really bad  big thing if don't amazing food then amazing service that  Vice versa    Our servers barley paid any attention but constantly checked other tables surrounding us  weren't busy all when dined in  few things made upset when server finally checked ordered few more items boyfriend still talking server asking refill water since completely empty he just walked away middle sentence  Secondly paying bill he says the rest change me? felt really rude say considering business giving us  ever tip understand since work food business well  always sure leave least 18% every time dine in  But felt time around didn't deserve tip  Tip voluntarily  The only thing place another alternative when tofu hut gets busy since down street  But overall lacked food service  would rather wait seated another kbbq restaurant  <EOR> This place really good! Would definitely recommend anyone! Friendly staff free beer <EOR> This best Korean BBQ restaurant US   Food authentic felt back Seoul   Highly recommended! <EOR> If wana stare grill no meat then come try place out  You'll eating air awhile come prepared    Servers helpful first then ignore you  sat waiting trying servers' attention  girls literally looked walked away  Didn't even bother ask if needed anything else  Also order steam eggs only took 3 servers ask finally it    This place bad service coming back  Tofu Hut instead  Even service better one  <EOR> This such wonderful experience!!! tried beef pork belly spicy chicken!!
