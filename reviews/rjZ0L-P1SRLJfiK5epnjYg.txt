Forgive thinking   I find good Margarita Pizza cannolis  Mission accomplished no lack satisfaction finds  Ness found some lobster mac 'n cheese! Great stuff! Maybe pricey side     There live entertainment  Pretty reasonable entrance fee  parking fee well however plentiful  If still looking forward next year's San Gennaro feast  <EOR> I'm 100% sure but think may first time San Gennaro Feast held empty lot next IKEA Las Vegas  haven't San Gennaro Feast in    least 10 years but clear huge improvements made since then  admit however did read Yelp reviews before going yesterday worried I'd made bad decision group friends invited come along me  BUT! pleased lot changes see made since even most recent back May  A side note bring cash  Parking $3 + entry paid door cash only  don't forget your coupon website  and some vendors support card transactions SO first all ground paved food tents areas  although still unpaved games rides areas don't know sure but saw some past reviews state ground dirt painful gravel everywhere which lot people disliked especially windy days   wore cruddy shoes Festival anticipation pleasantly surprised see ground actually paved time wasn't going even ugly shoes dirty   The tents offered plenty food options but other Yelpers pointed all food tents actual Italian food sadly I guess could be?   happy though food tents did pick good food luckily wasn't disappointed anything ate although friends didn't everything had  best suggestion shop around avoid any food choices you'll regret  Look other peoples' food too! Your nose your best friend here   Yes expensive  Entry coupon still $16 couple  food inside cheap  scoped games found couple fun affordable most importantly beatable  group stuck some fun things worked us  didn't stay hours upon hours but ate good amount food played couple good games  guess always know anticipate food festival things always little pricey planned accordingly   All in all I'd say lot fun more thought would actually   personally some great food the Italian sausage peppers stand front park really good fresh squeezed lemonade think I'd back again next year if bunch friends wanted again  <EOR> This place deserves no stars security awful event believe when people say nothing place italian because all saw tacos grilled chicken maybe puzza there  group friends assaulted security guards just because wanted stay ride before closed If your going shut down ride let people know don't waist time line then threatened security guards   am many people never back Italian Festival if even want consider that   <EOR> Last night took monkeys met some work buddies  expensive but yet find carnival wasn't  looks pure joy babies eyes while going down running around all rides made worth every penny    If online print coupons reduced admission two adults $14   instead $18 $5 off unlimited ride band which puts $20   Another really cool thing night where mommies ride free which lovely because little dare devil daughter wasn't quite tall enough some kiddie rides herself  know tonight Thursday daddies ride free    The food pretty tasty yes its pricey  highly recommend Fat Sonny's booth   they super nice made nice plate kids shells marinara cheese meatballs must try real restaurant   Also   I wanted try s'mores funnel cake but just didn't any room tummy  going try again   just watch weekend   its absolutely CRAZY good kids all  <EOR> I wanted many years  I NEVER again  I pay then pay $9 $15 everything wanted try  $9 single slice if cheese pizza?!?! wasn't even great! I paid $10 extra long sausage hot dog roll  might look good taste OK but worth price   I feel though since food vendors traveling along feast town town don't really care food tastes like  I recommend anybody wasted $60 just 45 minutes  <EOR> Gross  Thought would church based  Italian food feast and am religious just looking authenticity found tacky overpriced flea market  ten dollar Philly cheese steak cheez wiz  Yucky  <EOR> This year Rio which okay but food kinda expensive   $10 Lasagna $9 Sausage Pepper Sandwich etc  looking booth sold Arancini which favorite but guess didn't show year    Overall just okay probably gonna ridiculously expensive next year   ALOHA!!!
