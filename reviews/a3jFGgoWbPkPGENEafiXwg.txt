Okay auf den ersten Blick wirkt das Binion's Cafe     ähm     etwas *rustikal*  Es auch kein Café sondern eher ein typisch amerikanisches Lokal  Es ist mitten im Casino untergebracht und wird nur mit dünnen Papp ? Wänden abgetrennt  Immerhin gibt es Fenster hinaus Casino  Wenn man das Lokal betritt wird der erste Eindruck nicht besser  Es sieht alles etwas verlebt aus   Da wir aber Comps hatten und das Essen somit fast gratis war haben wir uns trotzdem Burger Fritten bestellt  Die Bedienung ist typisch amerikanisch aber nicht typisch Las Vegas = nett aber nicht aufdringlich   Das Essen kam nach einer Zeitspanne die vermuten läßt dass es frisch zubereitet wurde  Das hat mich ehrlich gesagt etwas überrascht da ich wirklich geringe Erwartungen diesen Laden hatte  Noch mehr überrascht hat mich allerdings das Essen  Die Burger waren wirklich gut vor allem wenn man den Preis bedenkt 5 95$ und die Fritten sehr knusprig mit einer Art Panade wie Burger King sie vor einigen Jahren mal hatte   Die Burger werden hier nicht fertig zusammengebaut einige Zutaten Salat Zwiebeln Tomaten Gurken liegen daneben auf dem Teller kann man sich seinen Burger ganz nach dem eigenen Geschmack zusammenstellen  Zum Burger gehört entweder Kartoffelsalat schmeckt tatsächlich ziemlich deutsch oder Coleslaw gute Qualität die Fritten müssen extra bestellt werden ca  1 50$ extra   Die Getränkepreise sind Las Vegas generell etwas höher hier sind sie für Las Vegas Verhältnisse etwas günstiger Softdrink 3$ Bier 4 5$   Comps werden hier grundsätzlich anstandslos akzeptiert trotzdem empfiehlt es sich die Rechnung genau zu prüfen  Comps Gutscheine bekommt man auf verschiedene Arten Als Nicht Binions Club Mitglied Players Club z B  über den American Casion Guide oder direkt am Casino Eingang als Flyer die Hand gedrückt  Um diese dann zu nutzen muss man kostenlos Mitglied im Players Club werden  Falls man eh im Binions Casino spielen lohnt sich das doppelt  Denn man kann dort täglich seine Clubkarte swipen und Comps abräumen Freeplay Slots oder Tischspiele 2 für 1 Gutscheine 10$ oder 15$ Gutscheine fürs Binions Cafe oder täglich wechselnde Geschenke   Auf dem Flyer finden sich noch weitere Gutscheine für ein Gratis Foto mit einer Million Dollar gratis Spiel Slot Promotion Automaten mit der sehr geringen Chance ein paar Tausend Dollar zu gewinnen einen Las Vegas Kofferanhänger und 2 für 1 Drinks  Als Binions Club Mitglied bekommt man Comps regelmäßig übers swipen seiner Clubkarte   Ich würde hier immer wieder essen und sogar den vollen Preis bezahlen wenn es nicht viele Comps geben würde  Den einen Stern Abzug gibt es weil es beim ersten Mal echt Überwindung kostet den Laden zu betreten und dort etwas zum Essen zu bestellen  <EOR> I'll keep short sweet since doesn't deserve full treatment based get  many frequent readers probably know recently moved office downtown area which opened opportunity try whole slew new places  Today's review comes tip regular Twitter friend sent supposed hidden cheap gem Binion's Café  Cheap good wasn't   Binion's Café located right middle smoky casino floor completely open noise slots savory Fremont St patrons  somewhat defined space seat yourself free all two four top tables well small diner style counter facing kitchen  definitely place ambiance fresh smells  lunch random weekday totally packed  24 hour menu features appetizers soups salads burgers sandwiches many breakfast items  hangover breakfast burger menu comes topped fried egg 2 bacon strips 2 slices American cheese lettuce tomato onion sweet pickle $9 75 but sounded bit much hung over meal   Instead $4 95 Binion's Burger some Swiss cheese  can't even explain burger much detail but instead give analogy if put burger side side blind taste test McDonald's angus burger would probably lose  generic dry foul tasting pre made patty hard stomach sweaty cheese barely melted salty previously frozen tomatoes seemed barely ripe  bun fairly fresh flaky grilled but thin did nothing save burger  generic frozen fries cooked ok but didn't taste great also nothing speak of  $4 95 burger meal quickly escalated $10 84 addition cheese fries iced tea  Going back McDonald's comparison would better far less  <EOR> Terrible food steak house upstairs ribs same floor but fixed soy burgers cafe awful  <EOR> Alright asked friend works MGM where town could awesome burger  He told check Binion's Cafe  did WOW!
