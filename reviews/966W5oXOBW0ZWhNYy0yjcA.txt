Clean good takes credit card payment actual Chinese people inside   C'mon buddy    this can't real   But is   And Las Vegas all places   mirage people   Show some love   Don't eat XLB though need New York that  <EOR> Wendy's Noodle Cafe great place very authentic Hong Kong eastern western style dishes  Being Hong Kong New York having eaten lots restaurants similar styled cuisine I'd contend Wendy's genuine gets valley   A warm atmosphere prompt friendly service very reasonable prices pleasantly varied menu delicious foods restaurant favorites   After long chilly day holiday shopping stopped dinner  ordered pork salty fish salty egg hot pot warm ourselves up  cold winter evening nothing tastes feels more comforting hot pot saucy food bed steaming rice  <EOR> This isn't first time here  fact all other times pretty pleasant  However seems place gone downhill since   I family give complimentary peanuts tables munch while waiting food  party 9 only gave small dish  asked another server said need charge extra dish keep mind parties 2 next able same sized dish had   Then she back brings extra dish saying nevermind here's another 'FREE CHARGE'     seemed she already annoyed us?  Anyway wonton noodle soup  Simple enough right? Wrong! broth noodles nothing special just you'd expect  came piece vegetable  mean come expensive toss another piece two right? But real complaint comes wontons  tasted sitting least week fridge meat started bad  couldn't even finish first one   Then rice dish served clay pot  where server brings mixes then serves bowls  Upon first bite aunt found strand white hair immediately notified waitress  then service dropped significantly  She did routine did want change dish something else? which decided change fried rice dish which fine no complaints   Later she came back said bad attitude wasn't hair piece glass noodle just stomped off   First all family works food industry  DEFINITELY tell hair 'glass noodle'  She never apologized attitude nor fact hair food   When received bill charged fried rice rice dish clay pot which refuted because only took bite returned it  gladly pay fried rice dish but definitely clay pot dish   manager owner? over everything sorted out  least she helpful apologized server's behavior hence extra star   never such poor experience place  Probably won't back again  on side note all other dishes ordered edible quality  udon noodles xo sauce fried chicken wings chow fun etc  best but least edible  <EOR> They cool noodle bowls carved into chairs!  Ok time talk food  First thing liked place lunch includes Chinese soup actually pretty solid flavor good amount meat Chinese veggies it  just watered down flavorless soup usually starter    The Stir Fried Udon Seafood XO Sauce surprisingly delicious  noodles chewy coated XO sauce  seafood included plentiful fish shrimp squid  Plus 7 95 enough food two meals!  My aunt uncle rice plates tasty huge portions well  ended finishing any entrees due sheer amount food give tons take out next day    Good eats  Great value  Awesome Hong Kong style cafe  <EOR> All reviews terrible service true   noodle shops rocket science most work already done   No chit chat needed don't even need friendly take order bring food   Noodles good enough won't way rush back  <EOR> While good beginning seems though quality food going down  feel price should reflect quality just all anymore  charged extra eggs rice cake but made very watery  <EOR> I bookmarked Wendy's Noodle Cafe way before made move Vegas months ago when happened area knew way over see all hype about  When finally found restaurant parked lot saw real party across street  little shopping center across way packed people  chance drive over dinner but finally give Wendy's shot    We seated ordered most popular things according yelp reviews  including steak cubes ramen noodles! some reason always looked intriguing when finally arrived table rather disappointed  wasn't horrible but definitely wasn't deserving all raving yelp reviews! also ordered chicken wings okay  Also some beef noodle soup thing can't remember name just okay  When ordering asked server difference noodles she just said noodles  uhhh okay  know asian should know asian food but am noodle expert  soup decent  mean its soup  wrong soup?
