Having complained service must say food quite good  Sadly service really pulled star rating way down  Again having read other reviews think off day  <EOR> I highly recommend restaurant  feel welcoming staff friendly inviting  bartenders Chris Alex usually hump during karaoke night making good time delicious food drinks! Best place town! <EOR> Would love review restaurant but unfortunately when tried dinner told would 45min wait  place lucky quarter full empty tables throughout  server told could eat bar but could sit any numerous empty tables! Obviously couldn't bothered having any more customers  Wouldn't bother trying again  <EOR> For price really can't place  other overpriced restaurants Strip eat your fajitas filled without getting your pockets emptied same time  Bring your appetite portions more large enough  <EOR> I'm sorry write review because wife Yolo's often enjoyed it   own store Miracle Mile shops which attached Planet Hollywood often   Froday September 9 first told could booth because reserved   During entire stay booths remained empty   Then chips old stale  Finally mahi mahi came big cube absolutely raw center   sent back said just wanted leave but still charged other entree also eaten    Unbelievable!

Compare your cereal  sitting milk bit vs cereal right when milk poured it  soggy crunchy    Tortilla strips meant crunchy  Ask few slices avocado squeeze lime  Mexican way eat it  adds greatness    The guac isn't very good  needs more salt onion jalapeños no tomatoes over blended  Leave some chunks texture  wouldn't recommend getting if guac opinions    I've also ordered tacos Yolos  surprisingly pretty good  I'd order them again if wasn't into tortilla soup    The drinks good  staff welcoming attentive  only sat bar area but restaurant area bit more concealed being right smack casino  <EOR> Yolo's great!    4 starving and quite dehydrated ladies couldn't wait seated table sat bar where Chris bartender tended us   He GREAT super friendly!

The margarita ordered literally size head    ok head small    but still      We started Guacamole  fresh right your table!

Food service excellent! <EOR> I really really impressed place  walked way back north mid strip Luxor bite eat midafternoon  appeared really basic hotel type restaurant  mediocre food high price  But hungry 4 5 hours until 9pm dinner reservations  just needed snack   The chips salsa really good the chips came hot hurt little eat them first guacamole good both ceviche good taquitos fine  girlfriend claims strawberry margarita best she ever had  use real fruit fruit margaritas suppose all surprising   The prices perfectly reasonable   Vegas' latest trend appears sexy mexican restaurant  but tasty    surprisngly so  <EOR> I just wanted take time recognize both bartenders Chris Guillermo Nico customer service! fun friendly!

Love love love it!! <EOR> So easy review place because only came thing drink  bartender sweet chatted made marvelous mojito start off afternoon  even free shot cachaça when asked it!

No thanks  Instead bang buck Yolo provided whimper   You only live once    eat somewhere else  <EOR> This place okay fantastic  Especially when many A+ places eat Vegas  would maybe eat again becuase aren't many nice mexican food places Vegas  food good but very americanized  prefer traditional mexican food it  say margarona great  margarita corona    worth trying!! If your just looking drinks appetizers then place good spot  <EOR> I never high expectations places Vegas but pretty good  Decent price good food kinda reminds Pink Tacos for all LA ppl located inside Planet Hollywood  Came snack which turned into full meal  fajitas pretty good  There's 6 thin strips give all goods put into your fajita sour cream guac beans rice etc    The guacamole fresca pretty damn good  front just basically guac chips    I don't know thought place pretty good but also starving point think anything really good    But recommend place if just want afternoon snack don't feel splurging fancy restaurants <EOR> After finding would 2 hour wait Gordon Ramday BurGR decided hang inside YOLOS they no wait drinks appetizers  first impressed large long booth sat at  quickly changed when people table kept kicking each other  no room under table sit comfortably  server quick take drink order gave plenty time look over menu    We ordered Quesadilla priced $10 Empanadas priced $10 snackage  quesadilla jack cheese onions peppers inside  also came side salsa sour cream guacamole  quesadilla good but average  If want beef chicken shrimp then cost $4 $5 more  empanadas well liked hubby I  stuffed chorizo green chile avocado salsa underneath them  only complaint dish size it  put enough green chile avocado salsa plate why add just 1 more empanada even 4? If cocktail party could understand small bites portions but wasn't case  4 people table awkward hubby just ended splitting them  margarita did taste decent!   They lunch specials during week right now start $9 95 Happy Hour bar well  Also beware music inside place  very loud hard conversation people sitting right your table  <EOR> Fantastic street tacos tasty mojitos friendly staff  can't wrong here  Located inside planet hollywood right middle casino  back <EOR> I never truly know if food actually good if just hungover   But time freshly made guacamole fabulous everything else   Felt wait staff minimal though took quite while refills  <EOR> I visited restaurant around 4pm practically empty  hesitant going but glad did  started table side guac which delicious  chose side car tacos which excellent  Everything seasoned well every bite flavorful  drink mule which wasn't very strong but still tasty if ginger beer course   Service excellent well  would definitely return recommend good meal  <EOR> This place does name brand chef true that  price line food served considering Vegas strip  2 ate $54  bar tab 2 delicious Margo Ronas $24 pushing tab tip up  Perhaps feeling pinch because similar drink DC would cost more    For entrees Pork Pibil 4 25 stars Steak Picado 3 stars service Gustavo 4 5 stars ambiance 4 5 stars drinks 5 stars   Average = 4 25 rating  a okay city many big name chefs prices  If buffet grazer very decent alternative   This restaurant inside Planet Hollywood Casino near PF Chang's  <EOR> We stopped just some quick appetizers before long night ahead  chips salsa great mini chimichangas whatever actually really good  price good service ease place during lunch time pretty fantastic  also came before myself dinner equally good  <EOR> I know friends say    Chris why did cheap secondary restaurant Vegas when ball hard motherf***ers wanna fine s*** crazy s*** crazy   Well friend ours loaded he couldn't even articulate name let alone probably let into CUT over Palazzo   surprisingly amazed quality food   started off Salsa Trio group then Street Tacos Dinner Chicken Breast Pork Carnitas Mexican Gulf Shrimp    Honestly good   place dirty cheap   People getting upset regarding cost must used eating Fat Burger N' Out   four guys ordered meals boozed under $100 bucks   DISCLAIMER drinking most day and previous night probably slight sun stroke around $400 bucks   feeling pretty good hope does bleed over into usual unbiased recommendations  <EOR> This place just nice delicious!
