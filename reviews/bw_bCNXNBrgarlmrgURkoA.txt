Hello?  Common sense courtesy anyone?  Both highly lacking here     I pulled around window gave money gentleman nice but overly friendly   big deal   However when woman obviously gem drive thru speaker I say obvious because she only headset on came window she literally handed bag food did look eye single time started close window   word spoken   No thank you   No enjpy your food   No come back again   Nothing   wondered if she suddenly become mute   said thank she handing bag she literally kept looking over car into street  Annoyed point she closed window yelled Hello?  said thank you! She looked blank stare walked away   Again word spoken her     Unfortunately food didn't redeem horrible customer service   fries obviously old tortilla grilled chicken wrap hard around edges ended just taking everything eating salad which honest wasn't bad but wanted wrap dammit!    husband did enjoy burger but fries old too     Look eating fast food joint hit miss understand going late night even sketchier but there's just no justification employee acting most definitely no excuse food old hard   If you're open until midnight 1am should able food late  fresh if come dinner rush   sympathetic fast food employees thankless job they're paid well quite certain lot customers especially shady area town real pains ass     With being said mentioned before am pain ass when ordering food any restaurant establishment most definitely if ordering drive through fast food place   If being rude condescending all means dish back me! don't expect treated well if treating well   But if nice friendly respectful much ask same?    And now close being longest Yelp review ever placed   Whew!  coming air if you've made all way end salute you! <EOR> Seems only hit mark morning very early afternoon NEVER location night STRAIGHT GARBAGE SERVICE DoorDashed left instructions wanted burgers pretty straight forward no Tomato Jr Bacons no tomato asiago chicken sandwich also no mustard ketchup baconator mayo only pretty damn simple right?
