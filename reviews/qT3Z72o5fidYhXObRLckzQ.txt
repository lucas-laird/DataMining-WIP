Watery tasteless broccoli cheese soup   Turkey sandwich made remnant turkey pieces slices   All around gross ripoff!  Avoid! <EOR> Last Tuesday Bobbie sub   good but dry   There's place Eagle Rock CA serves Pilgrim sub   same ingredients Bobbie but add gravy sandwich   much juicer sandwich tastes better   wife regular Turkey sub comes coleslaw  it   coleslaw cold almost seemed frozen  <EOR> Oh my    From cashier cleaning grill finally taking order lack acknowledgement order no thank no offer chips free dessert never experienced caps   Oh gave all change $1 xx tip zero recognition?  ordered fries but told would more 15 minutes before could hope any  switched chips  selection kids lunch bag 1 oz chips small    Then loaded everything request ignored slice meat slice tomato each side 12 inch very little lettuce NOTHING else  does loaded mean anyhow?  The sandwich dry    The price since last time  $9 49 12 inch sandwich valued 3 99 could find 7 11  No joke    My last visit met 8 veggie coming wife turkey meat  Wouldn't think ask being faked real turkey  wife vegetarian years  But due lighting cold she ate some it  told when brought attention staff she ate most did expect?  Upon notifying them mistake expectation replace did staff said ever expect would replace again she ate it    I'm disappointed caps suppose many previous visits met future visits two very negative experiences    Seriously?  want pay much?
