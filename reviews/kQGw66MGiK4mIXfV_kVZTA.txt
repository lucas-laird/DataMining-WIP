This blast! Trekkies heaven non assimilated really enjoy too  There 2 separate experiences   Klingon Experience far superior Borg IF you're only going there's no doubt  do  Also if buy tickets online ahead time good year save $10 ish don't stand line if your tickets printed out  <EOR> My boyfriend closet Star Trek fan enjoy episode fun   Trekkies love non trekkies least find ride entertaining   The admission price bit steep but must admit museum 4 D experience well executed   sure use coupon free 24 7 Las Vegas books save some green   gift store restaurant hoot  fun  <EOR> When teenager still totally into comic books would comic conventions hotels back late 80's   Sometimes comic conventions would mix Star Trek conventions crowds would sorta blend in   People would dress Star Trek characters Star Wars characters there'd all sorts Star Trek stuff sale posters glossy photos replica phasers uniforms scripts    and comic books   A lot time would even meet your favorite Star Trek movie character actually autograph picture them well   You could just lose yourself whole other world wasn't real world problems come that!  maybe  made fun   In place OK geeky super beautiful   OK actually science fiction comic books   didn't popular special     So sadness read Star Trek Experience closing doors permanently   I visited place back November 2005 blast! The tour Quarks bar Borg experience great   But thing totally rocks visit was          I sat Enterprise Captain's chair            me captain Enterprise                  and still photo!  It's something never happen again once close doors tonight but keep memory foreverrrrrrrr!  Hailing Frequencies Closed  <EOR> OK confess being sci fi fan sci fi fans unsurprisingly most exhibition  However believe enjoy exhibit even if you're hard core trekkie   It's nice arrive Hilton futuristic ish monorail  reception hall models various Enterprises hanging ceiling continuous loops various Star Trek episodes playing large TV screens  Downstairs you'll find Quark's Bar gift shop which accessed without ticket  food Quark's fun names but looked generic believe better food options   With ticket gain access museum Trek memorabilia also timeline future integrating all Star Trek franchises  Absolutely fascinating someone but see won't much fun non sci fi buffs   However real core Star Trek Experience lies its 2 walkthrough experiences  choose both your ticket choice  Now really enjoy suspend belief just pretend you're episode  don't understand people into something cynical attitude start   I liked original Klingon experience highlights being able stand bridge Enterprise transporter room  ends motion type simulator wild ride back Earth guess which town end landing in!?  However preferred Borg experience  watch carefully see happens all your fellow crewmen when Borg attack  highlight feeling being assimilated don't want spoil surprise   Both rides ended back gift shop  spent good 2 hours there  reason awarding 5 stars attention detail  actors wandering round whole Experience area dressed full klingon Borg gear stay completely character whole time  example klingons speak fluent klingon only know few words maintain superior air tone conversation you   So 5 stars trekkies 4 stars non assimilated  <EOR> closed !?!?!?!?    no !!!!!!!!  you Hilton mofo's better open kick ass replacement ! <EOR> The experience close forever September 1 2008   all actors crew ran experience made Star Trek Nerds dream come true Thank you   It worth every cent ride ride behind scene's also picture taken 'the chair'   You fondly remembered missed  <EOR> Aw just read article said Experience closing its doors today   Very sad   glad able enjoy once   Still awesome able 'beam' bridge     I'm huge Trekkie   only into when TNG air but still scooped into world Star Trek point on   It sad see go   Hopefully paths cross again elsewhere  <EOR> I've Trekkie that's right vintage Trekkie new ageTrekker 35 years    every episode every series dvd well every movie   Also collect NIB MOC action figures over 325 them    never Star Trek convention don't wear uniforms pointy ears all nonsense   That being said couldn't wait opportunity visit Star Trek Experience   Unfortunately didn't happen until March 2007 return visit July 2008       but now gone!!  other reason could visit off strip Hilton??    This Trekkie's paradise   bit pricey thought but lots paraphernalia examine uniforms props gadgets aliens    thought both rides pretty cool too   spent long time gawking everything display     Quark's bar quite different too    but service sucked when there     Heard some rumors attraction going re constituted some form Neonpolis downtown Fremont St     sure hope so   In meantime RIP Star Trek Experience  <EOR> I think need really into Star Trek   or young enough jaded whole experience   Sort mix show ride     Yeah   it's your thing    <EOR> Many people don't understand once buy ticket ride rides over over   Which great because first time just wondering heck going on   Then second time fun expected anticipation   Then if ride again might end ride child says Ohhh never space before! always cute   husband just say good bye didn't realize would sad   Las Vegas bit far every weekend but some people bar experience bar hang at   people all over world   lot actors employees since opened   very sad   sad emotional current running through place   lot weddings occur space planned   Sad studio decided close place   missed because awesome experience  <EOR> I am uber Trekkie going Star Trek Experience definitely pilgrimage me  excited knew going best part going Vegas me  am happy disappointed  Since girlfriend converted into Trek fan well getting cheap tickets half price ticket places anyway decided all full package both rides Klingon Encounter Borg 4D backstage tour  take review parts   The rides fully immersive characters full costume awesome special effects some see screen some experience yourself super detailed sets  believe when beam up  coolest effects ever seen  If Star Trek sci fi general just thrill ride enthusiast NEED rides ST Experience  say though young children enjoy Klingon Encounter but could scared Borg 4D ride  Just heads up   The backstage tour really fascinating see everything works rides including beam mentioned before  lot into those rides both people working technology all possible tour made really appreciate rides even more  also awesome since guide real Trekkie well he knew he talking about  only problem told could take many pictures wanted except when wanted take picture Enterprise bridge wasn't allowed   Lastly gift shop where deposited rides awesome selection everything Star Trek  picked couple great shirts some Romulan Ale  <EOR> Sadly spot closed doors September 1st 2008  According CNN http www cnn com 2008 TRAVEL 09 01 star trek voyage ending ap index html the attraction's owner     Las Vegas Hilton its landlord couldn't agree new lease   C'mon really?  Looks lifelong dream  marrying hottie Trek fan bridge Starship Enterprise and then having marriage immediately annulled  crushed   Who wouldn't want married Enterprise? <EOR> I give 5 star review based solely fact allowed stand bridge Enterprise D   The Borg experience also scared living hell female companion while classic experience world  especially transporter room   I'm first admit much attraction 100% cheese but just cool walk around corridors Enterprise   If any future upgrades hope actual integrate experience harkens back original series films! <EOR> Totally forgot Yelp Star Trek Experience during recent trip Las Vegas     My friend both Trek fans decided spend day here   made entrance   say impressive   could spend hours reading everything cool museum filled all Star Trek artifacts   Me snapping pictures anything related Star Trek Voyager  The best them all!  Na na na na boo boo! So if everything great why 2 stars?  Well!  rides just Deaf friendly   Most shows scripts ready Deaf people least provide interpreters   those don't provide any kind accommodations we'd discount money back   friend suffered through shows the Borg show missing everything   Although 3 D or rather 4 D stimulations interesting   After show look through gift shop headed back front money back even if partial   Oh no wouldn't even dare think refunding money   dead set non refundable policy regardless may come   Even manager wouldn't even consider request   So just left bitter taste mouths people Star Trek Experience understanding even willing listen experience   Blah!  For fun suggest check Cirque de Soliel shows    <EOR> Hmm call it    show? ride? both?  I mixed feelings Star Trek Experience   life long star trek fan enjoyed getting see exhibits uniforms props but no indication signs whether original authentic props created specially museum  would guess mix each but didn't say signs them trying hard clever being written if museum distant future  Cute but unhelpful   I Klingon Encounter ride Borg although pay both  chose Klingon first because never much cared Borg episodes then afterward didn't time other ride  Despite ride itself being only 20 minutes wait start then if you're going back your way back wait other ride  Unfortunately didn't time both   Klingon Encounter fun mostly  won't spoil details but let's just say close any going come really visiting world ST TNG  slightly hokey but pretty well done overall some impressive live special effects  motion simulator ride part Klingon Encounter  While some ways fun did start feel being jerked around rather lot end did feel tiny bit nauseous  weak stomached hereby warned  I'm normally subject motion sickness if tells anything  I did pay extra fee photo taken sets  Warning eats lot time  wait time they're doing which may interfere your schedule seeing other two rides may just inconvenient time  It's every half hour  If you've just missed you're waiting 25+ minutes  Then takes half hour photos actually taken then wait while they're printed put into folios en masse before your print  sure lot faster but if rush problem   Overall I'd suggest trekkie friends but wish whole thing little cheaper better organized take half day  <EOR> There star trek exhibition San Jose thetech org museum pieces old experience??? <EOR> We during TREKKIE convention last weekend saw tent card Free entrance Star trek Experience participating Blood Drive Monday August 18 10am 5 pm Captains Lounge   info www bloodhero com Sponsor code Star Trek call 702 562 2166   I recommend least checking Quark's bar before both close Sept  1st! <EOR> The boyfriend Vegas Star Trek convention yes Trekkies girlfriends Vegas enjoy whole scene     The boyfriend trying indoctrinate into whole Star Trek way life part going 4 D Star Trek Experience   thought shows little short but beyond one time thing quite bit fun   Great 4 D effects take surprise   Good teens older bit much younger children  <EOR>
