Knock few bucks off prices   Lets hope eventually put something good spot  First Fish House then Lolita's now place    try next spot because gluttons punishment  <EOR> This place kind weird me   nothing inherently bad place just odd   only once didn't good time   saturday night Town Square absolutely packed busiest ever seen place just dead which super odd   walk bar 7 us even though wasn't busy still took 20 minutes drinks even though two bartenders   managers assumed managers kept walking around hanging each other but never really checked people mainly concerned adjusting vests hats   did seem nice people though   light scheme odd music wasn't best drink menu very limited   bar crawl excitement fun seemed slow crawl when here   Half people left another place     don't think coming back here  <EOR> I really hoping something would succeed since many businesses failed past location  decor pretty nice place potential but    going even talk bad food here   My biggest gripe any business bad service  If just right friendly attentive staff customers overlook other shortcomings   Well Neche bartender acted didn't exist  only 4 people whole place besides friend I  bartender spent whole time other end bar talking  When could finally attention order something would mess order  Then wait another 30 minutes attention again could order fixed  pretty sure worst bar tender ever seen   I wonder evening when busy  Early day ghost town    bad service  <EOR> I've stalking place months when heard finally open made sure check out    Neche suppose huge restaurant ultra lounge 2 bars indoor outdoor patio dj conveniently located upstairs across some already popular night life spots Blue Martini Yardhouse McFaddens   The cocktails excellent made strong kind cocktails  beer selection wasn't bad  cocktails wines seemed little pricier compared Double Helix  Really didn't lot food besides few items under share menu  Fried green tomotoes tandoori chicken satay hummus sampler  good  3 items totaling $38  price didn't justify quality quantity usually should other lol neither  wouldn't recommend them see pics  would probably try other items menu under share  Hopefully its better more filling  tandoori chicken satay only 2 small pieces  server overheard little upset able add 2 more pieces which very nice cause only casually complaining among ourselves she took initiative own   Their happy hours run til midnight 25% off alcohol share food  Double check your check before paying cause discount but wasn't even close 25%  slightly understandable since they're new business   They weren't busy but really potential  Excellent drinks friendly staff  I'd probably back business picks update review  Heard they're having big grand opening event soon  <EOR> Theeeeeeee bomb DJ tonight New Year's Eve!

No local discount either! <EOR> Nothing Vegas looks feels quite modern youthful upscale Neche  Its location Town Square only contributes its distinction surrounded eateries bars such Blue Martini McFadden's ambience carefree refined   On Sunday afternoon boozy brunch way go  red velvet waffles indulgent delicious! chicken lollipops succulent bursting flavor fried jerk chicken vivacious Jamaican flavor  think all being made hands single chef seemingly doesn't tired!  The staff hospitable inviting attentive music provided live DJ spinning nothing but upbeat hip hop most tasteful decor I'ever laid eyes on  Hard believe spot exquisite instead among gems City Center   even Beverly Hills! <EOR> We dinner first time tonight  new think only opened last month but maybe 10 other diners saw when arrived 8pm  staff mentioned picks late  dj booth left around 10pm cannot attest scene that   We started drinks  cucumber collie amazing  Highly recommended!
