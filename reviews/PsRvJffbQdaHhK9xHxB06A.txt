I thinking giving place 2 stars because cashier lady friendly  she seemed genuinely concerned making sure alright  But food speaking loudly actually SHOUTING me! go     5$ Pho Ok lets talk broth  talking Top Ramen peeps  water + powdered soup base   it  Mental picture here  Noodles Pad Thai noodles  looks weren't soaked cooked properly possibly old because slight woody taste   rare beef? Overcooked well done meaning past medium thick slices flavorless beef  Finally cilantro top   all folks  Plus tender stomach last night whole day today   The owners seemed very nice pains this  But wouldn't recommend place anyone  very fortunate hit lot bullseye's foodie quest Vegas  also hit some ducks along way  Quack muthatruckin' Quack! <EOR> Across street Stratosphere hotel casino dive bar place  If Inn missed part it  Looked fit more seedier side neighborhood surrounding Stratosphere  When gist it  Looks dirty worn somewhat sleaziness unsettling someone appreciates more    BUT      They serve $3 50 Bloody Mary's hooked  beer $1 bartenders nice  no issue anyone there  buffet some sort food options didn't explore   FOR ME    the drinks enough A OK  location convenient If anywhere else doubt I'd even set foot inside   While Bloody Mary wasn't strongest enough keep things moving  <EOR> This review solely based food environment   I ordered Beef Pad Thai just didn't cut it   I'm big Thai food just didn't it  far traditional taste used to  was   ketchup y  sauce just off liking    Secondly  place reeks cigarettes  Now Vegas good number places specifically Casino's Inn's smell just offset appetite even more  If don't mind smell then all means    They wide variety menu  burgers Mexican food etc  maybe just made wrong choice day sure burgers fine   Thai Tea good  Good portion unlike other places fill glass 85% ice    They also desserts here  almost ordered cheesecake    Service very decent considering only customer but he looked he handling some gaming side well  Experience well  <EOR> This place reminds hole wall seen Vampire movie  people nice  Avoid timeshare people since honest  Alex owner did even try resolve mis communication made staff Michael tried change offer disadvantage  opinion cons  offer dinner vouchers but fact restaurant com discount certificate which most certificates stock value which offer attending presentation  seller reps nice apologized  TLC presentation selling RCI foreclosures  RUN OTHER WAY AZTEC located stratosphere !!!!! <EOR> The drinks very cheap food excellent! desired crowd keep your purse your person  Quin excellent bartender works most nights great attitude  Definitely worth checking drink between hotels  <EOR> Lemme straight first second time visiting restaurant  service except breakfast  also didn't know apple juice small bottle thought suppose glass  mom dad didn't food all except me  background music sounded calm  Probably coming back all  <EOR> INEXPENSIVE Pizza Salad Pasta Buffet!  SITREP  There NOTHING Spectacular location across street Stratosphere nor menu QUITE ordinary    though does sound stellar recommendation someone go out of their way come if close hungry stop definitely worth poppin for    SETUP  As guest Stratosphere first noticed Aztec Inn when walking Circle K and should review Circle K cause very cool saw $6 95 all eat Pizza Buffet    pay when pizza buffets Roundtable Mountain Mike's back Sacramento   THE MENU  This buffet much better *  big selection pizza slices including substantial amount veggies pesto based sauces *  big selection leafy greens lots different salad toppings options *  pasta bar couple different selections usually meat sauce then another marinara alfredo based sauce *  bottomless soda also great plus     Being casino also allowed many patrons take advantage FULL bar nearby which own separate cost but usually spirits beyond normal beer wine available most pizza establishments sometimes even beer wine    THE LOWDOWN  Sure very quaint all elegant but if you're trying mind your money don't want stuck putting $50 $70 buffet wristband strip anchor only handful food diversity options three days then little way places true gems enjoy  <EOR>
