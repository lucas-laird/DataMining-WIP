Probably when town <EOR> I always jjajjamyun which always good price  Huge bowl delicious  Good place eat before grocery shopping  <EOR> I found jja jjang min black bean noodle place Las Vegas  place located inside Greenland korean supermarket   I ordered jja jjang min combo spicy seafood noodle sweet sour pork  only $13 all food  good two people share  delicious! did take star off because sweet sour pork came all different sizes  Some huge some itty bitty    The lady took order nice  ordered two same combo she personally bought second tray table  service!

Definitely come back here  <EOR> I love food place very familiar some dishes but owner hi wife  very helpful recommending items menu  Also great kimchi <EOR> Red Gate serves Korean style Chinese food Greenland foodcourt    The best deal combos noodle dish black bean noodle seafood noodle soup 50 50 bowl both plus meat dish sweet sour pork spicy fried chicken $11 14 easily feed two people  Otherwise think Chinese food prices seem high ish but haven't eaten much menu    So black bean noodle jjangmyeun + fried crispy chicken combo  noodle decent aside needing tiny bit more seasoning salt  fried crispy chicken isn't expecting but battered fried nuggets sweet sour type sauce onions peppers  give side kimchee yellow pickles black bean paste sweet raw onions  portion again feed two easily very hungry mofo    I think combos bad spot but don't know if want delve into rest menu  guess different since its Chinese cooked Korean style niche don't see anywhere else  <EOR>
