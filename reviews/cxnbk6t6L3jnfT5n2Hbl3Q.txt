Oreo shake amazing  course all Oreo shakes amazing but place did skim Oreo's! That's made amazing  place cute clean looked really nice  definitely going again  <EOR> I still excited when come across new place no told hopes discovered some gem city  But guess rule if no mentions place probably good reason least located part town no would ever find it  case SinCity burger yes word think latter would apply although former equally questionable   The location definitely greatest right next gas station Russell Decatur where no really lives only handful office parks exist   interior bit sparse needs slight retouch handful small 'vintage' Vegas posters really gets lost walls  menu painfully complicated options including Sincity Burger 1 2 Burger 1 3 Burger 1 4 Burger Dbl 1 2 Burger Triple 1 2 Burger   that's just way many choices  also Sin Sandwich chicken wraps hot dogs plenty add ons the menu amazingly adds apostrophe word on's    I tried keep simple ordered Signature Burger which 1 2lb burger topped Swiss cheese green leaf lettuce tomato sin sauce grilled onions grilled mushrooms  soon ordered saw cook reach into drawer pull looked pre made patty off piece wax paper drop perfect circle meat onto grill  encouraging  arrived table few minutes later looked better anticipated though  bun really soft deliciously grilled buttery great  Although meat looked generic good flavor seasoned lots pepper seemed  mushrooms really good along onions although might bit overpowering  Sin Sauce decent maybe chipotle may something bit kick it? Overall wasn't bad considering all variables   The fries sadly lived non hype extremely generic reminded carnival fries  such common gripe mine apparently hardest thing most restaurants right burger meal  whole meal ok enjoyed burger would lot more if fries halfway decent  price wasn't bad $9 you're given isn't question again could even more reasonable if fries good quality  don't know if I'd tell your way now think Farmer Boys down street much better bargain  <EOR> This great burger joint! French fries best ages fried pickles die for! pickles absolutely awesome stood burgers too! 1 4 pounder husband bad ass burger fried egg bacon grilled onions mushrooms cheeseburger   Pretty good burgers but sides really stood out  Next time try fried Oreos! food little pricey burger joint think red robin rather Burger King but well worth price  also chocolate shake Oreo shake onion rings can't find bad word say them shakes pretty thick  Only complaint should napkins more easily available considering much fried food menu! Seriously try fried pickles can't wait twinkles available again love good fried Twinkie! <EOR> Great food great price!  def again!   Deep fried marshmallows die fried Oreos too!!!
