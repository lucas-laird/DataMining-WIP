No hello  No sorry wait  No hi name is  told leaving she looked blankly walked away  Saying nothing  Told host leaving she said ok good one  left  Starving pissed off  nice way express things went  Especially since everyone around getting service  Making sure no know puts own negative yelp review  <EOR> We came wife's Birthday following review based experience Good The food good prices line would expect type restaurant a fair amount people use groupon cut cost service good  Portion sizes good  chef's did put good show   Now bad  prices pay restaurant definitely need facelift  outside look really nice but problems appear when walk through door only which working time visit walls dirty could use repaint floors dirty fume hoods above each tables could use good cleaning I could see lot rust just looking menus need replaced  menues also need replaced  Ours ripped half all menues table pretty bad shape also laminated dirty  look menus would cheap restaurant where spending average 30 bucks more entree bill $92 00 tax tip drinks  also ask server clear dirty plates table lot room those tables would think would priority    overall view place mixed   gave three starts actually should 2 5 but no rating that because could better much better if repaint some cleaning replace cheesy menus  definitely place romantic dinner   good place take family if kids  Don't if less 4  because community seating   said Wife's Birthday seated table 4 adults 2 kids breast feeding infant  people table friendly but knew would seated would gone somewhere else occasion  Because cleanliness issues don't think back  <EOR> Osaka Summerlin lost long time repeat customer  am really sorry didn't read other reviews before going back last night  restaurant needs some serious help!   Honestly feel place turned into roller skating rink dance party sushi side  service beyond horrible  being seated sat least 10 minutes without anyone even coming over ask drink orders  finally sent husband find manager told no communicated wait staff seated even though every waiter manager looked directly several times oh did mention only other party Teppanyaki tables restaurant couple sitting bar  food just okay exception Crème brûlée don't try gross way overpriced   amenities restroom just hideous   it looks all money tapped unnecessary disco lights trying hard place decor wannabe club scene joke bar way loud music  owners Osaka Summerlin really sorry guys but just harsh truth failing awesome hopefully turn around  <EOR> Came dinner husband hibachi but asked seated table instead grill   don't smelling food date night  restaurant very nicely decorated which created great ambiance  played good hip music  server Robin also very friendly professional attentive  He came check frequently but much annoying refilled sake cups water glasses soda without having ask   wonderful customer service!   I ordered surf turf filet mignon lobster  Hubby ordered seafood combo tiger shrimp scallops lobster  both ordered fried rice additional $3 50 because hibachi entrees regularly come white steamed rice  enjoyed whole dining experience but taking star off because although food good flavorful little greasy  lobster also little dry over cooked  We'd definitely come back again  <EOR> Visiting California food okay  3 5 stars  Service 1 STAR  Chef 4 stars  waiter did come around often keep calling whoever saw passing by  <EOR> We came sushi weekday dinner  able sit table right away   Food service just okay  But expensive quality  <EOR> The WORST service EVER!!! If could give negative stars would negative 10  friend 5 30 reservations 5 40 party no reservations taken care due them slipping young man $$  when complained he said Vegas your going waiting while   service industry 30 years Vegas! know take care when called for   what joke!!! <EOR> DO USE GROUPON PLACE TOTAL SCAM RESTAURANT!!!! First off place 30 min away main hotel resorts  Groupon's fault but read fine print  standard menu only few choices choose $32 allowable  ironic everything else nothing fancy $34 $35  Asked if could pay difference told manager no next time read fine print !! expect pay $17 extra $2 charge PER ITEM which already paid kidding me!!!!! Also 4 drinks included??? ordered Coors light Miller light THOSE charge!! Really those cheapest beers far being unreasonable!!! matters worse CHARGED 18% gratuity only 4 people  Come find ONLY Groupon customers IRONIC!!!! SAVE $45 cab ride somewhere else food also average!! <EOR> I enjoy sushi place surprised see other reviews ratings  only unpleasant experience because mom seated booth next obnoxiously loud females wanted throw food at  But weren't worth sushi   stomach worth sushi    <EOR> The reviews scared buying Groupon but well worth it  portions decent  fat man didn't leave hungry  wouldn't pay full price honest but restaurant very nice bar awesome drink menu far boring  scallop filet tiger shrimp hibachi all enjoyed  Worth trip  <EOR> This review might little confusing but basically here's intro paper plastic menus exactly same just plastic menu took sharpie changed prices crossed rolls     I walked looking paper menu prices menu attracted place happy hour items prices very good  happy hour when walked sat down gave plastic menu saw most rolls paper menu gone everything else 2$ more 3$ more then said paper menu   showed them paper menu compare plastic said yeah haven't time change   Um then why don't just give paper menus anymore until change it?  attracted place looking menu but then guys switch different menu? cool!  complained them honored paper menu price rather then paying 3$ more but wouldn't roll wanted other menu    Will coming back  <EOR> Grabbed Groupon deal   Excellent food great show   Excellent service!  place great! <EOR> The restaurant manager refused honor terms Grroupon she started arguing when pointed discrepancy  She rude walked while talking  Worst restaurant experience ever  never come back again  <EOR> We 9 30pm close 10pm  rushed order eat  food rushed everything cooked perfection  last people restaurant made feel very welcomed  Service great food great definitely back soon  <EOR> We Groupon still felt cheated  advised   when using Groupon charge 18% gratuity menu prices service mediocre best  waitress inattentive failed come check give drink refills  Probably because she knew she guaranteed 18% tip regardless  soda water drinkable terrible taste   soup ICE COLD when told server he just said ok ?? food barely passable  reservation sit waiting Teppan table almost hour before served  place dirty chairs well worn uncomfortable  Food over salted  chef failed give sauces until asked  Overall good! <EOR> On mission find good Teppan grill place fell short unfortunately  Nice atmosphere start but bar somewhat split into two areas rather small  wine selection beyond minimal say least  manager time seemed rushed abrupt really care service received seating ordering dinner  menus laughable   a clipboard laminated sheets choices  Seriously   invest menu  Then when show began found noisy  Honestly many teppan grills never complaint   maybe bad insulation? food mediocre best  being generous  give bad yelp reviews usually but wanted honest helpful among rest  <EOR> I normally write restaurant reviews but sign Yelp just warn people Osaka Summerlin   think you've seen all warnings other reviews Groupon deal Hibachi misleading charging extra $17 if exceed lowest Entree choices   also charged 18% services table two others  don't mind tipping full original total but 15% 18%   reason really hated experience Sushi Groupon deal which ordered not Hibachi worst Sushi ever seen  plate extremely small   miniature playtoy Sushi   misshapen child formed them   Normally Sushi chefs take pride form  <EOR> I tried coupon groupon $42 two persons  food good tempura small tempura sauce lacking taste  choices limited coupon but good saving because price bit high   We around 6pm see chairs dusty maybe its best night when its dark appreciate place  Hibachi might specialty because regular food wasn't good expensive price  cold green tea though! <EOR> It just average habachi  think better ones Las Vegas  <EOR> I've going Osaka years! lived right down street now currently live across town but still ONLY sushi restaurant eat Las Vegas! Best sushi! Gorgeous fun atmosphere! absolutely  best hospitality ever had!!!

Horrible feeling!!!!! = Plus   a few days later stomach didn't agree food  Don't want TMI but ugh   my stomach gurgling type this  Back high school    this whole cook in front of you thing awesome! Now   this doesn't appeal much  Plus much food  Thanks but no thanks  <EOR> Had really great deal Groupon  tried out  used work sushi bar basically know look for  place dirty dusty using online radio station commercials know free  menus falling apart numerous price increases marker  time upgrade menus  being said food average but pricey  Fish rice barely there  Still hungry three rolls  going back spot used work better quality better prices  <EOR> I'm usually wordy but place gave lot say   Having Sahara location sushi several occasions saw Groupon Summerlin location figured why not? Definitely lower end hibachi experiences trust share  say no complaints service only saving grace being 1 star review   But rest experience   meh  Walking into restaurant welcomed Pandora ads playing throughout restaurant speakers  love Pandora but couldn't spare $5 month ad free subscription? Although came food music tacky   We seated fairly promptly own grill couldn't help but notice food used chop sticks floor adjacent tables  point willing forgive appearance floor hoping food brush off  waitresses suggestion both ordered martinis disappointed  $11 drink expect able taste vodka martini   Soup salad come shortly drinks  miso soup fine  salad just lettuce watery dressing super thin carrot slices it  No tomatoes cucumbers might find elsewhere  Although maybe minor thing complain lettuce seemed little warm just sitting out  All know definitely didn't come working refrigerator any time recently   Ok chef comes out  Personable guy does all usual tricks nothing ordinary  chicken shrimp she ordered scallops  fried rice  veggies average no complaints  meat portions small  know portions small because both finished meals  usually case places this  tiny chicken breast 7 shrimp  scallops small sea scallops probably closer bay scallops size   for comparison's sake maybe half size you'd expect Benihana being generous  worst part? tasted way fishy obviously fresh  considered drafting review waiting see felt morning but thought I'd post now hoping just case die someone sees Yelp review know sue wrongful deaths   When check came blown away $98 dinner  Maybe need look window realize restaurant strip  regular hibachi place LA I'd filet mignon lobster same price chicken shrimp here  No thanks Osaka Summerlin stick your sushi Sahara  <EOR> I would've loved give zero but wasn't chart need start rants dinner family few nights ago Andrew amazing waiter however ocean she young lady brought food somebody else's order best part no manager supervisor site even complain did find owners name Joy called next day show concerns she am little bit shocked owner run business this  am business owner if complaint am phone instantly try resolve issue no wonder why coupons keep business running  food amazing waiter Andrew amazing however when ocean through food didn't even explain Andrew came back said wrong order unfortunately just canceled reservations eight people sure Osaka Sahara would love business!!! <EOR> Best sushi ever had  chefs creative rolls taste amazing  I'd recommend trying Kiyoshi SOS those favorites!

My opinion if looking teppan Musashi paradise Hamada flamingo much happier  <EOR> I took time day download Yelp create account since Osaka family owned there's  no corporate speak to  would vent warn others save them wasting time energy hard earned money place  First took 15 minutes anyone acknowledge even there  busser call waitress where took another 15 minutes drinks  now 8pm we seated 7 30 supposedly only two cooks whole restaurant night waited  While waiting physically switch plates next empty table because dirty greasy  tell two bussers them pull dirty plates out  now its 8 30 cook comes  food decent  Joe pleasant  only part visit enjoyed  Ana waitress okay she tried but hard time understanding she obviously hard time understanding since few things wrong order  asked manager refused speak because lady worst attitude whole night  She no manners very rude whole visit  didn't waste time getting name all know she gap front teeth  Whoever hired should ashamed  man spoke took few minutes nothing much say but didn't want money back anything else that  never come back Osaka any other branch sure everyone know either  Pure waste 200$ plus spent  Maybe if fix your staff wouldn't need groupons  <EOR> Extremely slow  made reservation hibachi hour arriving yet started cooking  miso soup good but salad came some chunky orange dressing didn't taste good  <EOR> Poor guy just could first night  hungry thought could chew arm off  hour didn't even rice  finally mentioned starving he handed half lemon  Might last time eat here <EOR> I groupon restaurant  took family hibachi  told server right away groupon  server Jess wasn't pleasant explaining groupon works  groupon good 2 $32 entree fried rice 2 drinks  Most entree $34 more  if u choose entree  more $32 u need pay charge $17  Paying extra $17 just paying whole price  didn't really save money  whole groupon scam  just people restaurant  didn't read reviews restaurant till late cancel groupon  figured guess no choice but check out  When Jess gave check she added 18 % auto grat  asked why since only 4 us  menu said auto grat 6 more people  She said because groupon  read back again groupon didn't say anything auto grat  did say tip generously!!!   I tipped cook George since he great  He very friendly great job  Food so  Sauce could better    So tipped 30% coz additional 18% auto grat Jess did  would taken care took care cook anyways  Lying face auto grat just unacceptable  restaurants misleading groupon server terrible    I usually don't leave bad review but experience needs heard  Hoep u guys don't same mistake <EOR> Giving them 3 stars only because waitress  She rude needs lesson discretion  food good chef Jimmy funny interactive   deal Groupon great  gone before back November without Groupon dughters birthday BEST experience  when saw Groupon deal excited take some friends never there  waitress however rude seating  When she came take orders explained 6 having hibachi 1 would ordering alacarte because he vegan  She told needed wait tell chef but rude it  When friends ordered seafood combo she literally raised voice looked my husband across table very loudly said would $17 charge btw price difference between seafood combo included meats only $6 menu made friend feel terrible! then we're served soup salad but wait 1 hour 20 minutes before chef Jimmy came start hibachi  Jimmy worth wait  He friendly great but wasn't prepared vegan son order lacarte  wait more he could back kitchen  Previously November ordered when ordered ourselves prepared meal back while ours hibachi but time waitress difficult delicious dinner she brought check decided announce total everyone  only table but entire restaurant  husband tried call closer more discreet paying friends but she didn't hint  He told dessert? wanted order dessert even offered! friends pulled credit cards told felt bad being charged charge wanted help pay  embarrassed  worst part girl also training another girl shadowed all night  wasn't just table  pretty much knew much every table paying meals because loud she was  tried calling restaurant afternoon speak manager 2 30pm but no answer  <EOR> I don't even know where begin    My friends decided wanted some hibachi tonight thought Osaka checked menu online said Sundays happy hour hibachi all day $15 could pass up   right?   We arrive Osaka stand entry no lie TEN minutes before even being acknowledged  meantime bartender back forth between bar dining room doesn't say single thing someone right even hi  FINALLY seated then sit table 15 20 minutes before even being acknowledged again getting any drinks even water  point contemplating leaving    So server finally comes takes order friend asked if could half steak half shrimp she said she would ask chef   she never asked came back answer just surprise when he started cooking  Once dinner done hour half later bland tasty  You'd think waiting long would best thing ever but no    So finally check charged $18 hibachi dinner then additional $3 50 fried rice which apparently isn't included dinner  never informed another lovely surprise end horrible experience    Seriously don't here  many other sushi hibachi places good food good service no hidden fees nice environment  If could give review negative stars would    The only good thing experience chef funny Sergei busser nice actually top things    You would think happy hour bring more clientele lose more already have  Yikes  <EOR> I am poochi le de pooch pooch otnwas good  Noy bad actually  Its sushi but exactly siushi  <EOR> This very disappointing review write because server first time excellent sushi delicious ordered platters prices reasonable  negative strong never again there  reviews sometimes state big fan Groupon  try many many new places because eat far more average person  But anyway take kids 14 20 21 year old friend amazing sushi platters since we're all really big sushi fans happy show them place  let server know Groupon wanted order sushi platter she informed no longer accepted those platters  showed details themselves posted she brought owner  hear she daughter owner original Osaka  explained situation she said she honor because she meaning change Groupon page  Normally they'll just honor admit mistake then move on  She became really argumentative point being offensive  escalated would just used Groupon would end  side note now states valid platters  Sadly heard other horror stories reviews Groupon use mostly tepanyaki side  understand why businesses enter into partnership groupon new business then proceed treat those using them badly  even much discount  paid $26 $40 worth food platter $90 counting drinks appetizers  said eat lot $14 really adds but am no means getting free meal  Plus always tip full amount  Again food really good servers good but management could really use lesson customer service  <EOR> I high expectations Osaka outside looks high end japanese restaurant  local 14 years many japanese restaurants  usually stick spring mountain area when eat Asian  Perhaps mistake  My husband came dinner sat night  ordered favortie spicy tuna roll  wasn't spicy all  tasted just tuna roll drop tabasco  We both ordered dinner bento box  beef cooked nicely but both agreed 'teriyaki' sauce very muted almost watered down  think teriyaki tv dinner would more flavor  only reason why gave 2 stars because tempura alright  dipping sauce tempura absolutely no flavor either  waiter very attentive when came refilling drinks  Maybe teppanyaki better otherwise would still business? would advise against ordering regular dinner menu   Thanks great ambiance loud music free smells teppanyaki grils  But food wasn't expected  More something would no name fast food strip mall  stay chinatown  Nice try Osaka  <EOR> Made reservations Sunday 4 pm when opened  Gave them name phone number  Showed Sunday group 4 us  NEVER OPENED  other people waiting reservations too  Waited till 4 30 pm calling no answer door left  never again  bad business  should called told me  waste drive Henderson  <EOR> I wish would read reviews before coming here!

Just ounce dipping sauce  If waitress any common sense she would notice portion dipping sauce enough she should least asked if wanted more dipping sauce   But sad fact most food servers today just going through motion guess should blame management lack training also chef cook prepares food should also more intuition food prepare  Only positive comments restaurant booth comfortable    I understand waitress works Tips but still feel Tips should taken granted initially reaction just give maybe dollar five but bill $80 guess should put all blame hope posting read management better train staff   left $20 because felt sorry her   much other restaurants choose know definitely return back place  <EOR> Great food reasonablly priced  waitress very friendly helpful   Calarmari Agadashi Tofu excellent sushi  very fresh   next time back Las Vegas definitely stop back Osaka  <EOR> Great food not decent portion clean ¡¡¡¡REALLY HIGH PRICES!!! order 3 different dishes 1 extra side shrimp 4 beers 4 sodas ending paying $310 95 dlrs  Oooohhh!!! poor service!!!! <EOR> Warm beer raw chicken $32 plate  Chef didn't interact all  He such hurry finish he failed cook chicken all way  returning! <EOR> I Osaka location W  Lake Mead under impression would similar experience Osaka S  Eastern   even close comparison   found Lake Mead location isn't owned same individual runs Eastern Sahara restaurants     The sushi chef did know some basic menu items asked for Uni fresh?

Troll 2 Birdemic Manos hands fate   etc  think those movies best metaphor restaurant  bad now tell stories people bad was may seem hyperbole crap department honest truth   Starts making reservation regular table not teppanyaki 6 30  surprisingly hadn't written down reservation  once again read all other reviews came no unknown variables   invalid girl front says Oh sorry happens sometimes table ready  EVEN KIDDING  basically saying Oh ya screwups know whatareyagonnado? sit couch 15 minutes which point ask troglodyte happened table  Mind 2 other groups entire restaurant girl says Oh wait wanted table? she TOTALLY SERIOUS! Actually mam just decided best interest sit uncomfortable couch eastern european level sweatbox pass time  don't enough room into everything service but just imply entire meal more same    knocking over drinks touching ends your hashi stank hands having shoyu just talking way statements magically become questions using higher inflection end each sentence la valley girl   The food SERIOUS garbage  could understand type sushi coming $3 99 off strip all eat sushi buffet where people just abandoned all hope eating good food but someplace uses name once stellar Vegas icon  Plus super expensive was   Let clear something Osaka sushi chef think some kind romanian perhaps? Sushi only consists 2 things Vinegar rice shari anything else neta   Anyone ever good sushi tell secret cooking technique quality flavour rice freshness ingredient  Well rice no vinegar it    no flavoring all   I would say chinese take out quality but would offensive chinese takeout  so    basically missed 1 2 essential ingredients sushi     Next rice wasn't cooked properly  think just sort dumped rice water decided meh looks right  then put dish steamer which where mind believe cook rice   Finally didn't even roll sushi correctly  nori inside nori cheap didn't binding but before plate even gotten table fallen apart  When gave server look wtf? she just shrugged gave hate job anyway nothing say feel worse already because here  look back me   The tempura cooked technique 8th grade cafeteria apprentice batter clearly wasn't cooled because greasy could all vegetables consistency toxic waste guy robocop    Lastly people party sick   Verdict rise really bad japanese restaurants Las Vegas few exceptions maybe new trend going towards really bad sushi really steep price but drown blasting trendy music    But if actually want advice stay far away place unless want hilarious story caution downfall restaurant industry  <EOR> The only thing saved second star food   Truly delicious   Everything else service drinks attitude waitress Ocean truly unacceptable   celebrating friends birthday recovery surgery   No manager duty 20 mins take drink order no offer appetizers because length time mom's blood sugar dropping drinks tasted terrible dirty dishes left table thru entire meal  costs over $150 should 1  Feel full 2  good excellent service 3  should feel special   felt forgotten almost unwelcome  <EOR> Had restaurant com voucher decided try place out  am glad voucher because would hate paid another penny place   staff friendly though hate write this   We instantly greeted seated given option pick where comfortable  First all don't understand decor all point where found myself looking details getting little annoyed  White snake print seats green backing Indian looking lanterns Japanese setting?

Which seems pleasant enough but strange greeting restaurant  When replied two she apparently expected tell whether wanted dining sushi bar hibachi grill she seemed annoyed she ask hadn't originally specified  wouldn't even bothered if rest experience good but no such luck       atmosphere which usually last thing care very lacking  Dirty seats walls  Paper instead table clothes  Instead dim lighting adding ambiance seemed covering dilapidated interior       menu completely different others chain  did favorite dish spicy chicken chose chicken teriyaki  chicken dry very flavorful  rice no where near Osaka standard come expect  prices nearly 40% higher Sahara location        waiter decent but great  didn't even stay dessert which favorite Tempura fried ice cream! Yum! didn't want further disappointed       If want really experience Osaka try Sahara location! <EOR> Hmm  dont even know say place  Its mehhh   Food very mediocre same service  Save your time money appetite something else  If restaurant flavor would vanilla  Super plain basic  <EOR> I haven't Osaka awhile still same great place loved kid boyfriend enjoyed Monday night hibachi happy hour special! service quick which loved because hungry food couldn't better  definitely become routine thing us! <EOR> Great food great service great deal  used Groupon app hibachi dinner 2  chef entertaining fast service  surprised see many bad reviews Yelp place  But experience great  <EOR> I good time friends couple weekends ago   used Samurai family when kid Ohio first restaurants I'd heard where food prepared teppan style your table which actually grill   Samurai overtaken Benihana's which never visited Osaka nice reminder fun used Samurai   Before all group arrived couple sat bar where friendly waiter showed pictures place during evening DJ event  Twice week laser lights DJ'd music apparently pretty fun DJ even dances bar must pretty lively sometimes  gonna check out!
