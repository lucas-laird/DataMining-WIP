This first time fell marketing gimmicks  Lets see Cantina Bowl XL Steak Nachos XXXL Steak Flatbread thing  All total fails  guess only person blame myself because keep thinking maybe mistake somewhere along line use actual ingredients  Then scratching heads why all sudden people lining truckloads   So closing gave two stars because only thing ever hope Mexican Pizza  never let down before even if does percentage making sick very low  Maybe because stomach grown tolerant it? Gahh sounds scary  Notice never mentioned service  Fyi yet find worthy mentioning location no different  Memo TB corporate stop smoking weed try real ingredients  least put some weed your product think its good when just actually hallucinating  Plus munchies when high which turn help sell more tacos  no dont weed  Well voluntarily anyway  Sometimes smell secondhand weed smoke munchies well  gotta now think DEA knocking door   Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #97 Puff puff pass!
