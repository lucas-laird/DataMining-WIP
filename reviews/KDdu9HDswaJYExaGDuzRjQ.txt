I definitely back give another try really rooting place but need step flavor  even picky eater between two didn't finish food  <EOR> I've wanting try Veggie House long time when heard mastermind behind launching Vegeway ears perked up  When heard opening NW neck woods knew fate   I imagined would just burger until saw friend's IG post bahn mi sandwich   y'all literally car drove there    It did disappoint! meat great texture flavor delicious would loved filling mixture over rice some steamed veggies more sauce good! Definitely going Veggie House soon! Since Fryday felt duty try sweet potato fries  great very fresh hot    Tiny criticism would wish sandwich warm did stop next door pick tea Perfect Scoop drive back house but fries still warm there's that    Anyway would definitely stop back  veggie burger sweet potato fries again  <EOR> I'm even vegan but wow very good  burger curly fries ranch white chocolate peanut butter shake  next day same thing  Very impressed quality tasty all is  Highly recommend place everybody just someone vegan  <EOR> Wow  LOVE place  sad moved bruddahs but great replacement left full  staff friendly interactive  defiantly going back soon <EOR> This place       I pulled Drive through dog ordered popcorn chicken some zucchini French fries  My eyes bigger stomach ordering pretty easy but drive through window isn't easiest access  Anyways    least 30 minutes paid waiting food     expecting 5 10 minutes   I home am ready eat few bites realised beyond greasy!!  Seriously !? dripping bag!!!! food itself isn't bad but cooking oil correct kind  Pretty tasty guess timeframe fair considering fresh ??? Unhealthy vegan food     when you're really bad  <EOR> PREFACE vegetarian vegan  just average run mill omnivore  perspective which reviewing place  decided check place because live nearby support local businesses felt eating healthy particular lunch    First impressions service bit lacking but only saw 3 people working  may just understaffed  thing really caught off guard just basic menu is  didn't realize before came place basically vegan take fast food burger joint  Literally menu is Burger vegan burger vegan fish sandwich vegan chicken sandwich vegan fish tacos vegan beef sandwich vegan chicken wrap then few sides salad biggest surprise me  vegan restaurant only salad? Very interesting   also don't appear any particularly creative signature dishes   Because burger  knowing exactly expect burger pretty average meat eater standards but blend spices reminiscent Mediterranean food even something middle eastern  wasn't bad but also wouldn't say made burger amazing  curly fries good any standards    Overall giving four stars because instinct 3 but also incorrect expectations menu  gave them extra star leeway  try again sometime update feel going intent  <EOR> Very friendly staff! Truly best veggie burgers ever life  took bite Genuinely thought having real meat burger  milkshake amazing too  back long wallet handle lol! Highly recommend!! <EOR> First time ever having vegan burger new plant based vegetarian diet new say pleasantly surprised! slight taste realized few bites cheese didn't care for  Reg fries fresh cooked perfectly  Staff nice knowledge  definitely back  <EOR> The menu all meat substitutes burgers chicken sandwiches  fried zukes some best ever definitely best fast food  owner place owns veggie place China town really good didn't know affiliated until here  food quality would expected known A+  Service acceptable  staff friendly but poorly executed taking order said would bring table then called counter  only people restaurant sure why would offer then follow through especially wouldn't expected without them mentioning it  Some things which could see did greatly impact experience way other but telling restaurant run several sodas fountain order water cooler wasn't stocked tv off floor needs sweeping tables need wiping we only ones long dirty?

No compensation apology offered even though did receive actually ordered  disappointed especially considering did even taste good  used frequent but probably won't back  <EOR> I wanted bad place  But fact resorted watching episode Grey's Anatomy Netflix while waiting drive thru line  Pretty much tells bad was  finally drive thru 25 min wait lady took sweet time then scoffed fact didn't tip them  Now chicken tacos got  Looked good!

Also curly fries crispy well seasoned  people drive thru we're also nice courteous well    The bad under high expectations vegan burger patty  didn't expect taste meat but feel whole burger soggy just husband  ok Vegan patty burger should solid hold well rest burger  Veggie House beyond pleased both food service  expected same because chef Kenny initially opened location  Maybe under new management quality compromised?  All all coming back curly fries milkshakes  burgers stick In N Out  <EOR> Basically restaurant takes something good deep fries it  expecting something else  food super greasy! fries soggy limp fried zucchini  meat sandwich actually good along cajun dip  staff member kind rude but rest staff extremely friendly  friendliness rest staff meat sandwich reason 3 1 star  probably never visit place again  look other vegan vegetarian alternatives area  <EOR> I single veggie burger  Very tasty but think next time opt no cheese add pickles  curly fries hot delicious! drivethru bit slow but least all food fresh!

Thanks being vegans still want eat fast food! <EOR> I've trying find more vegan places around side town glad Vegeway isn't far away  mentioned other reviews menu does many choices but personally simple  person just starting eat more vegan food am overwhelmed many different options  prices reasonable didn't wait long food come out  Restaurant fairly clean organized employees friendly    I ordered vegan beef sandwich sister ordered chicken ranch burger  vegan beef sandwich little bit spicy some kind chili sauce jalapeños sandwich probably ask no jalapeños next time  But overall foods flavorful portions just right  definitely back soon! <EOR> The food ALWAYS amazing! love everything menu  Except take long time food ready you  Perhaps larger staff? Regardless visits worth it!! <EOR> The food itself good but nothing all other location across town  must changed recipe something because 1 patty bit mushy looked lot different before 2 flavor more vegetable taste way burger tastes  If didn't already expectations last location probably wouldn't anything complain but just bit disappointed see different was  Customer service okay just little slow  Overall still good though  <EOR> Seriously spot used good last two times gone miserable   first horrible time didn't 80% menu only found paid ordered because cashier ill informed inventory  then took away 2 better things offered curly fries popcorn chicken although replacing popcorn chicken seitan nuggets   literally cannot tell last time returned something restaurant just gross to   looked nothing picture advertised tasted burnt flour dirty fryer oil   while returned them waited least 5 minutes before employees finished gossiping notice standing counter help out   Granted nice let something else   Ugh together   top two big dead bugs just chillin bathroom no toilet paper    greatest experience   horrible loud music playin   simple plan? chemical romance?
