This establishment poor service bad attitudes food ready  place just horrible  teenagers running around all over place employees just ignore you  saved table family sit at  employees took two chairs  told saving those chairs family employee said needed close bathrooms still took chairs  move different table point    When finally food which same every other panda moderate tasting  end dinner started hand cookies ended giving proper number cookies  Then cookies didn't even fortune it  technically screwed two cookies! Just topping horrible time! <EOR> I don't frequent panda express all location did help alleviate trend slightest  Customer service very lackluster  Servers appeared lifeless unamused would pass information another  repeat answer asking if wanted plates 3 times 3 different people  mention failed inform wait would take items just let idly sit by   It doesn't help food isn't exceptional either  probably some driest fried rice ever misfortune experience  Avoid Panda location    better yet find better Chinese restaurant  <EOR> They stingy food its even funny  Then gotta pay 1 25 extra fuvr pieces shrimp rice tasted old never come again tell ci workers either <EOR> Rose nicest lady ever cashier   rest staff totally ignores loud personal conversations  took 10 minutes bring child's cream cheese rangoons  frozen middle  finally came around time ready leave  Panda should fire entire staff besides Rose start over location  never eat again  Overpriced small portions fully staffed cocky high school kids  No thanks <EOR> This location quick lunch usually fairly quickly  Staff friendly restaurant clean  bit overprized likely Town Square location   <EOR> Town square Panda Express   place clean  all going it  food soggy charge dollar more give less food other locations  Save your stomachs else where  <EOR> This town square location  called place order lady just answered could answer question asked speak someone else she said hold on  waited 5 minutes while she full conversation days she working someone else  She then picked phone hung me  tried calling back instantly picked hung me  tried back third time where just left phone sitting without greeting now they're phone off hook  guess take business somewhere else  Horrible costumer service  She very rude could barely speak any English  <EOR> Bbllllaaaahhhhh! food mediocre same no matter which panda express to  line long long long even when through line lady loud she couldn't understand very well   Once food some beef tasted burnt sitting under heat lamp  chow neon chow very blah  Probably won't come back only came kids eat quickly before movie  <EOR> I've written review 2 stars before  am updating review  Still worst panda all pandas to  lot trying eat bit healthier normal fast food  did say bit know fast food unhealthy  But lunches short if forget bring healthy lunch choice expensive restaurants pretzels panda potato hut btw potato hut worse panda    So anyways stepped Kung pow chicken spicy now!  plus! But ran goons dry cold  don't them fresh when order here   Kung pow brought hopes rangoons brought them back down  Oh well  shrimp cold old  chow mein needs some flavor  Still no brown rice    Little Mexican girl really nice  Poor girl slammed food  <EOR> Quick  Customizable  Affordable   expect when eat Panda Express  Since visual person particularly food nice wide array dishes choose readily available freshly wok'd  sweet fire chicken hearty choice balanced flavor pineapple chunks offer sweet notes glaze over crispy breaded white meat chicken delicately cuts through just enough bell pepper spice  If you're opting lighter dish try chicken greenbean entrée which less caloric yet satisfying  <EOR> Pretty much only place eat break because fast convenient  only but staff work location very friendly always greeting customers constantly asking if everything okay food  may little hectic sometimes but hey expect mall lots foot traffic hungry customers  Overall place awesome always clean  General Manager great guy <EOR> So ordering food threw drive threw ask lady please give broccoli but broccoli beef broccoli mixture just wanted few pieces beef broccoli mixture without beef when pulled she told dont around saying every Panda Express because can't recipes  follow she said attitude      name GEMMA  she also very bland threw intercom      order your food she stays quiet don't know if bimbo getting your order      she sits hella quiet       RUDE no wonder she works panda she would never able work casinos attitude   Hope someone talks review   SMH  coming back hour again see order threw again  <EOR> So Panda Express same any other Panda which good all but couple things know location Town Square  right next movie theater only budget friendly food entire mall always very very busy  Everything else fine dining sit down fast food place fast but  really fault just something prepared for  fast food monopoly there  Other then expect normally would Panda  <EOR> This Panda Express located Town Square south Las Vegas Strip between AMC Yogurtland   I some friends location Saturday night before watching movie next door place packed  Walking place filthy  All trash cans overflowing tables topped pieces noodles rice spilt sauces =T understand busy night but many workers kitchen maintaining front    I stayed line ordered always order Panda tofu eggplant orange chicken half noodles half brown rice  people front ordered noticed each complaining weren't being given fair amount food each sides well noodles rice  nice enough add more actually fill plate but you'd think few complaints would realize doing something sketch  When turn server did exact same thing everything half full lol shaking head    I gave them half star because food fine but because brown rice gave them extra half =]] <EOR> I am fan Chinese restaurant lunch special  However good Chinese restaurants serve lunch specials everywhere  includes Town Square Mall Las Vegas  I'd settle Panda Express    This past Saturday lunch Town Panda Express  record few fast food restaurants Town Square  record regardless close five years old newer Las Vegas locations  Situated AMC Theater promenade Town Square relatively small location provides row booths tables  Saturday afternoon tables nearly full capacity  only imagine seating capacity issue weekend movie night   I started off review saying am fan Chinese lunch special  must emphasize although am fan Chinese restaurant restaurant lunch special generally regard Panda Express favorably  following paragraph review compares Panda Express experience Chinese lunch special   The first difference method ordering  When visit Chinese restaurant generally order off menu then wait cook food  Walking into Town Square Panda Express food presented tin trays that's call them   kitchen made food now warm tray  problem presentation call Panda syndrome  when item low cooking oil dominates tray  mentioned couple earlier Panda Express reviews unappealing  couple times walked Panda Express because this  matter fact passed over eggplant tufu because Panda syndrome  second difference between two pricing  general lunch special comes between $9 $10 tip  Panda two item combo small refillable Pepsi drink came $10 65  difference price nothing remarkable  However difference dining experience noticeable considering fast food other full service restaurant  third difference familiarity product  majority Chinese restaurants Las Vegas excluding China independently owned establishments serve own style food  fried rice XO Chinese Restaurant might taste better China Wok  nice thing Panda Express food identical each location  good thing  appreciate fried rice chow mein noodles fire cracker chicken other items  humble opinion soft chow mein noodles far better many independent Chinese restaurants  ordered soft chow mein noodles entrees while making fried rice side dish  picture shows half plate fried rice  second entrée ordered fire cracker chicken  Lastly Panda Express packet sauces play greater roll experience Chinese restaurants  always top off fried rice least two packets soy sauce fire cracker orange chicken two packets hot sauce   At conclusion dining experience walked back outside AMC theater prominade temporarily filled satisfied  Regardless dining experience falls short many Chinese restaurant lunch specials enjoyed city rate 3 Stars  <EOR> They Great customer service  Every time walk door greet me  every time u leave always say thank u  all such great people  <EOR> This Panda Express located Town Square next AMC theater  mean Panda Express Panda Express  feel they've gotten little more expensive used be  came when just opened day all food made yet  wait 5 ish minutes entree wanted  Staff friendly good customer service but nothing above average    I think everyone knows Panda Express works  Asian Chipotle lol  normally bowl fried rice Kung Pao Chicken spicy chicken peanuts way many vegetables   orange chicken good but majority time super strong smell flavor wise  mushroom chicken good but kinda watery    I'd really only come Panda if there's nothing else eat if really craving some friend rice Kung Pao Chicken  <EOR>
