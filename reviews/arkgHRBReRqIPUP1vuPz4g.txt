He kept barking saying Eat24!? Eat24?! Mind ordered yelp twice  then wife asked if she could dipping sauce fries  He yelled saying didn't order fries hand gesturing come where he standing resister only find receipt did order fries  He said did order fries they'll done min  Didn't even apologize being jerk  Food fantastic but service joke  Oh hairs already styrofoam  <EOR> THIS VEGAS MUST!!!  If you're area just grab yourself arepas Viva because those things no lie best treats find!!  I've tried few arepas ones stand most woodfire chicken pork butt  Both loaded flavor meat tender just melts your mouth! pay little extra cheese avocado but think still worth overall!  I've both locations disappoint! <EOR> First last experience here  always wanted try place because  heard great things  food greasy couldn't finish ordered  Tonight all feel ill  would live try arrows again just here  <EOR> I absolutely love place glad decided open another location side town! only chance location off strip every once while  new location slightly hidden but don't let deter you! new design really clean  Also everything menu affordable  big plus!  My family almost always order same thing Wood fired beef Arepas beef empanadas tostones  flavor meat point there's nothing wood fired meat! also give some squirt bottles avocado cream sauce green salsa compliment all food quite well  sometimes order Reina Arepa which chicken salad arepa unique delicious! mouth watering just thinking food  those don't know Arepa well may compared Mexican gordita but much bigger more filling shell lighter color much denser  good enough fill but always order another split it  forgot take pictures when because excited food then forget  definitely next time!

First time ordered online picked 2 empanadas fried plantains!  Wonderful     back soon <EOR> This place AWESOME    When walk smell burning wood place clean spacious lots seating    The man counter very helpful he let know popular items let know arepa looked tiny but very filling  Each arepa menu around 5 7 bucks depending what's inside it  add extra toppings cheese fried egg avocado  50 $1 00    We ordered shredded chicken beef plantains beans  Came around $12  Sure enough when picked them really hefty  Check photos! arepa itself nice crunchy outside but really soft kind crumbly inside  Overall great mouthful paired perfectly well seasoned meat  almost reminded gigantic tamale but 10 000 times better  also serve them side green hot sauce garlic cilantro mayo both which recommend   They also give bunch napkins you're going need all them because things REALLY messy really quickly  Next time might use fork knife just help tackle all meat    Thankful able try place definitely back! <EOR> Being Miami Venezuelan descent arepas near dear heart favorite stomach  happy discover especially close gym good motivation work hard lol! I never seen such layout multilingual menus before in Miami just spanish lol   Plus staff very nice made ordering easy  carne mechada arepa empanada queso  piping hot very good  sauces also excellent watery thick    My only gripe used queso guayanes arepa which very thick cut semisoft cheese doesn't quite melt giving extra texture arepa  sure type cheese used but thin melted through  good but never before  If provided and perhaps ordered wrong would perfect  <EOR> So tasty! Arepas those amazing foods lot people haven't discovered yet  Even if though Viva Las Arepas must try! They're friendly quick give plenty sauces dipping smothering your arepas in  <EOR> Just ate food ok good Las Vegas blvd location tipped 9 bucks anyways asked guy refill small iced tea he wanted charge two bucks  Never mind   somewhere else next time  <EOR> Their second location Rainbow Charleston clean spacious  Order counter food served fairly quickly  haven't waited more 10 minutes before receiving orders couple separate occasions  favorite far Pabellon $7 filled savory beef black beans plantains cheese  roasted pork butt arepa would benefitted more seasoning but combination tender pork tomato slices still made worth getting  wasn't big fan garlic shrimp served cold but certainly filling  side fried plantains nice addition mild sweetness  <EOR> My first time eating food Venezuela very good   arepa chicken also fried yuca looked thick French fries but yuca root very good passion fruit drink amazing  But made even better  great customer service friend very friendly waiter named Toni very kind he explained all questions different foods friend  lots  questions but he if way help explained all questions had   defenetly back try different dish  highly recommend them  <EOR> This seriously favorite dining spots Las Vegas  made recent trip last weekend forgot badly missed eating arepa  always La Reina Pepieda which scrumptious chicken salad mix made chicken avocado cilantro cream  also carne asada arepa queso avocado order side plantains  dough holding meat made corn mixture almost Mexican sope tamale fusion   taste unique delicious coming back more  <EOR> Totally delicious!!
