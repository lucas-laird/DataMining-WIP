You're acknowledging fresh? Okay thanks  He literally didn't care  He shrugged off  Then he started patronizing chips  He said could keep chips salsa without queso   He definitely wanted charge it  weird vibe no longer welcome just asked take it  paid left    Then he yelled halfway across restaurant guys leaving? Yes Juan  We're leaving  Six minutes into dinner   Went Macaroni Grill next door currently having fantastic time  Happy bring money elsewhere   Avoid all costs  <EOR> The food great servers wonderful!
