Am right place??  A true hole wall   hiding bar could pass EVERY single day never notice let alone see ethnic restaurant hiding dive lol   When first walk see tables chairs but no real obvious sign restaurant inside bar here   long hallway brings kitchen  where someone's attention place order   We decided eat in   but think mostly to go kind place   Maybe if gambling drinking darts pool would sure order here!    They ok Little Foodie Dude eating restaurant side   wasn't overly smokey side but still don't think would bring again   First Thai Mint $8 Pad Ka Pao     GREAT version here! Tons flavor Chicken good amount heat spices! better versions dish town opinion!  Pad Kee Mao $7   good overall! Lots flavor noodles   packed bit heat scale but much  Good stuff but Pad Ka Pao wins round!  Thai Beef Salad $7   good rendition   beef tasty done well  Salad ok overall   Good choice!  The portions little smaller some other places but prices most everyone town!  I'd rather full splitting 3 entrees instead 2 somewhere else same price   Check em if area <EOR> During school break past few weeks  think safe say couple Thai food Netflix pjs parties  First foremost if ordering delivery perfect  deliver fast food always hot!
