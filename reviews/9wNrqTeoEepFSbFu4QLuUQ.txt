When walked unsure whether wait seated could just seat ourselves no sign posted should do  stood front counter quite while  could see into kitchen where 3 guys standing talking each other totally ignoring us! Finally girl came back asked if helped  told wanted sit down eat she said just sit anywhere  sat down waited 15 minutes someone come give menus silverware ask if we'd beverage  decided wait 5 more minutes before we'd leave  5 minutes passed nobody ever approached table leave  reached front door 2 girls behind counter talking  walking girl said good night thank you!   said thanks what? never ate!   continued door turned take last look girl spoke she other girl laughing! Rosati's would better off firing your current employees going back being strictly take delivery restaurant! Do even think eating there! <EOR> I love pizza here  put toppings under cheese just right amount sauce  pizza place  Thy happy hour 3 6 dine our  sure if deliver but definitely recommend coming in! <EOR> Best pizza town! Walked ordered large pizza beer while waited every very friendly pizza delicious! Next time dine in  Great job!! <EOR> I tend enjoy writing reviews along everyone else seems saying but left little choice here   Chicago style pizza good since Chicago style hard find worth going for   said someone remind guys cooking cheese allowed Chicago style pie?  thin crust easily beaten both flavor price Verranzano's Grimaldi's    The service?  Well might better off using order counter put number your table method   Two servers duty night neither seemed gave damn doing job   Passed several times over 10 minutes before being acknowledged   Poor management likely here  No reason sparsely populated dining area should receive little attention many tables wiped down   Also observed other tables having ask checks instead having brought them offer dessert   However wasn't case check prompt asked box left overs   I'll give them another shot take out when want Chicago style but if can't find cheese that'll end it   won't dine again kind sad  <EOR> We 3 times The first two times food decent service mediocre  understood just opened appeared trying settled gave them benefit doubt   The third time 4 1 2016 absolute nightmare   We walked saw plenty open tables  great also now liquor license another bonus thought    young lady asked seat ourselves she let know server would shortly   I looked around surprised Friday night only 2 other party's seated  very large group appeared wrapping other couple new bar area   I cut chase! We ordered drinks food  table next pile dishes previous guest check  sat 45 minutes waiter returning every 15 minutes apologizing delay  50 minutes no food appetizer ordered  asked check! They said no charge drinks  left money anyways      We live 5 minutes away we're happy new pizza place close home  very disappointed level over all service busy all  pile plates dishes table next remained entire  50 minutes waiting  heck going on???  Hate say won't back  <EOR> I wish closer house! Best pizza service playlist!  You guys need downtown location! <EOR> The pizza great but service terrible  called order quoted 25 minutes pick up  arrived restaurant exactly 25 minutes ordering  paid told would ready 5 minutes  Understandable  Sunday night during football season extra 5 minutes no big deal  But almost 30 minutes later still no pizza  kept being told would 5 more minutes   the worst part no apologized no offered beverage while waited  just sat there  No seemed care  Pizza good but shouldn't take long  Especially Ben quoted 25 minutes  <EOR> I came twice day once pick catering order work second time dinner boyfriend  Both times received outstanding customer service! When came dinner server fantastic even made recommendation calzone delicious  <EOR> Deep dish basically meat pie  don't skimp toppings  mountain toppings each bite  barely any cheese would've liked more sauce top  dough delicious  Pizza tasted good next day too  <EOR> I gave two stars because starving ate it   if cardboard crust square cut spicy sauce meatballs really didnt taste meatballs pizza  place you!  am more New York Pizza type person isnt place choice   Best luck Rosati's! <EOR>
