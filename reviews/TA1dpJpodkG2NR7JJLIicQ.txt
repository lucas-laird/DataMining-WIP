After waiting over 20 minutes table ready even reservation seated directly next bathrooms which made high traffic slightly annoying location  booths incredibly awkward fit 3 people comfortably but party 4 they're forced place chair outside circulation area  space also incredibly loud no soft surfaces anywhere if you're Friday Saturday night dinner prepared shout  There's bar front seats maybe 10 people those crappy booths along left side bunch loose tables filling rest space  There's some sort upstairs area wasn't opened yet time visit sure it'll didn't ask   The Poppy Burger came based Bibimbap Burger which voted Greatest Burger America Eater 2011 read more here  hoping burger which based something such acclaimed title would represent little more  four ordered almost identical burgers but came four distinctly different burgers  First all look insane amount lettuce placed girlfriend's burger no idea why any chef thought looked ok enough send out  Two burgers ordered medium rare two them medium yet none them looked similar each other unevenly cooked medium rare burger cooked bit more spots  great way test restaurant's consistency which case total failure  Also if clicked link above see original burger based looks nothing it   As burger meat bun ratio completely off way much bun  bun grilled actually very tasty great sesame flavor but way big fell apart  meat ok flavor but nothing great  charred well outside but char didn't really standout flavor  pickles really good flavor but egg sriracha weren't noticeable  incredibly messy plate give completely flat very risky meal  Napkins put place dam stop juices sauce spreading onto table eventually us  Overall burger total failure general ten fold if know based compare other Asian themed burgers often speak highly about  three bites actually spoke simple nope response no one's question table    The fries looked tasted almost McDonald's upon first bite  didn't great flavor but cooked ok  salts whatever seasonings present but all noticeable  kimcheese sauce gritty flavorless really great longed ketchup most time  If kimcheese sauce when comes eat quickly because cools becomes really gritty nasty   Between less stellar appetizers absolute failure burger can't say way back try anything else  love Asian food menu certainly plenty great sounding items would normally bring back but case  burger fries $13 which would possibly acceptable if good  meal four couple drinks two appetizers four burgers came $120 which way much unhappy walking out  While restaurant very full night fully chalk fact brand new 'hot' place don't expect lack draw Tivoli bring anyone just rest places there  If Chef Sosa truly wants great Asian themed burger he should down street Bachi take notes proper size bun form patty apply your toppings  Until then don't bother coming here  <EOR> One best dining experiences ever food cocktail menu incredible sat down bar immediately greeted which shock usually unexpected bar bartender julien knowledgeable food cocktail menu few specialty cocktails then made some specialtys own all incredible  miso salmon which fantastic meatballs unfortunately small portion but delicious  definitely back! <EOR> Amazing!  came lunch opening day!

Coconut crab toast points amazing! guys impressed date which always plus! <EOR> Horrible Bartender place  Most people grab drinks before trying menu guy behind bar made wanna skip menu  Rude unwelcoming first impressions  Angelo Sosa rid guy your food deserves it  2 stars food   zero bar  <EOR> The service super slow  took bartender 21 minutes 1 drink us!! menu strange   Asian flare all items some them looked just plain awful   Stay far away place  <EOR> I'm love place   Decided hit place Alma C  before Yelp Elite Event  Ha  hungry  Defo hungry  Ordered following items Peking duck scallion pancake MUST ORDER! Ok duck already taste dip sauce gets weird taste  Eat duck scallion pancakes itself   Curry crab dumplings interesting but memorable  can't even remember taste it   Pepper glazed chicken wings just right amount glazness! Three pieces chicken  Good amount   Ramen ok bad idea  salty   I'm definitely love place  Especially cook came check if we're enjoying food  Good service  would love marry cook Alexa   <EOR> The Skinny unbalanced flavors seasonings miniscule portion sizes mar Angelo Sosa's new restaurant 2 service attentive but some missteps 3 value given so so mediocre offerings exorbitant pricing place big fail 2    We ventured off Poppy Den friend ours opening day lunch  Suffice say joint lives its inauspicious name Poppy Den? right mind would name Asian inspired restaurant this? British did turn generations Chinese into opium addicted zombies? WTF? Anyhow colonialist aspirations aside seated promptly shown table  ordered Market salad soy truffle dressing $7 Aunt Carmine's Fish Fritters $11 Amma's Homemade Tomato Soup $7 Poppy Burger fries $11 Grandma's style Roast Chicken $15 Steak Potatoes $18   also sampled two desserts Chocolate Molten Cake Strawberry Sake shortcake   The Market Salad $7 only summed 1 word = weird  little much basil which pretty much overwhelmed other subtle flavours mixed greens  boiled egg thrown top really didn't any sense such heavy item no place amongst delicate leaves  Added fact heavy addition really unbalanced dressing overly tart salty massive fail   Amma's Homemade Tomato Soup $7 didn't arrive hot hoped  Serving such shallow bowl made cool off rapidly which didn't help  soup overall sweet tastes  kind diluted ketchup some curry flavor mixed in   Aunt Carmine's Fish Fritters $11 perhaps highlight meal  Nice crispy outside fish mixture married well aioli served with  Unfortunately cost dish rather high considering small number fritters served   The Poppy Burger $11 flavor good but some major issues dish  Because sharing amongst three people hubs cut burger into 4 equal serving sizes  But this? When he cut burger into quarters quarter no burger meat it  repeat no burger meat it  meant burger bun ratio 3 4   sucky ratio because when bite into burger want taste everything    just bun    The fries thinner variety small sprinkle togarashi top  okay but nothing special  kimcheese alright we asked side because didn't want sauce mar crispiness fries but nothing would say I'd specifically yearn again more aioli cheese sauce per se   Grandma's Style Roasted Chicken $15     f$ king insult person's intelligence put such dish under supposedly large plate   large any means  Really portion size chicken 1 4 boneless thigh off regular sized chicken  am s *tting small  Served some pickled vegetable fail see anyone except 6 month infant would consider meal  actual preparation roasted chicken okay edible but given price ought much more this   Steak potatoes $18 only ok  Texturally little tough very underwhelmed offering  Served bland au jus togarashi seasoned potatoes definitely forgettable   Finally dessert tried both strawberry sake shortcake molten chocolate cake  strawberry sake shortcake overwhelmed oversaturation sponge large amounts sake  good  chocolate molten cake very good nice gooey inside but again price small   Overall wanted love place but many flaws dishes warrant return visit  Even if place half price double serving size just wouldn't come back restaurant fails many levels flavor textures  Sorry 2 starred review  <EOR> asian fusion?
