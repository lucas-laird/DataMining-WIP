Nice dining room attendant guy offered drink refills which nice   Finally spicy burger again chicken dry coating soggy lettuce tomato  Won't rush return  <EOR> CHICK FIL A SAUCE SHIZZZZZ nazz   ** 2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #8 **   I waiting waiting location open kept driving wanting every 3 times made way physical therapy Charleston  location PRIME location sure   inside neat clean expected even little live carnation flower center pieces which cute! drive threw ALWAYS seems packed just inside order    The staff super nice  There's guy always helps he SUPER fast knows stuff     I always 30 count nuggets which only $15 99 8 sauces w which literally main reason freaken CRAVE place much!!!   The frozen strawberry lemonade AWSOME nice Hot summer day vegas while still tangy but creamy too  Something addicting!    This might good everyone but honestly place beats all fast foods vegas especially since sense healthier since its all thick battered chicken   My growing w place back CALI may take some consideration obsession! =] <EOR> This location Chick fil A convenient visit downtown  restaurant doing brisk dinner business 6 PM Most tables occupied The order line non existent order placed immediately delivered table fairly fast  counter staff helpful friendly   We ordered  Chick fil A  spicy Chick fil A  deluxe sandwiches order waffle fries    The sandwich breading perfect coating chicken very moist  spicy sandwich comes slice pepper jack cheese which adds some heat  Both sandwiches come tomato lettuce pickles tasty chicken sandwich  fries hot greasy oily  Nice crunchy fries  tried Chick fil A sauce prefer sandwich without sauce  slight smokey taste  <EOR> Ok never place before heard amazing  Well opinion all  all HYPE  Don't wrong product good  just NO DIFFERENT any other chicken  Defiantly better McDonald if  compliment   The drive through took exactly 24 minutes sandwich  Totally wasn't worth half hour life  girls working drive thru amazing  Very sweet polite kept 30 minute wait cars very well organized  kudos staff   A huge NO NO member did compare sauce Raising Canes sauce   thing don't competitors compare your own product theirs  long run Canes sauce much better but shouldn't said staff   I'm sure hype die down  But until then 4 Canes choose same quality food if better lot shorter wait    Keep great work staff!! <EOR> Amazing help  Amazing food always fresh delicious  ecstatic you're town   Busy location but toes barely waiting  don't scared if there's lines  Thank chick fil A!!! <EOR> Love product really love breakfast options  dont love when im three cars line when window pay told pull drive through park front parking lot  Someone bring food me  Huh? bringing carhops bavk? Thats wanted  Pretty sure didn't order anything extravagant just basic chicken sandwich  sit 15 minutes watch car car roll through drive through them forced park front  Eventually inside complain  When did asked refund no seemed care why asking refund  Manager never spoke cashier took card receipt refunded card  No apology whatsoever  Terrible customer service start finish  would love someone respond why wait front parking lot when chose use drive through  holding breath   many other options risk going back location  measure 1015 Tuesday   exactly prime lunch rush crowd  Anyway 30 minutes pulling into order left empty handed hungry disappointed   Panama bread next door business now  <EOR> I've Eastern  much hype around place which took them over hour drive thru MONTHS grand opening  Luckily location only 10 minute process drive thru despite long lines way closer house  <EOR> The food heavenly dream waffle fries Chick Fil sauce Polynesian sauce    The service fast customer service top notch food clucking good! Hehe  love fact two drive through lanes where order  speeds things gets snacks quickly!   Not sure why only 3 5 stars  Give shot! prices reasonable considering quality really there! happy them Sin City! <EOR> Seriously? Why all five star reviews?  Judging long lines you'd think some fast food offshoot French Laundry something  Something  Anything   What ok  place chicken sandwich fingers much else  If someone your party wants burger something elsewhere  service quite fast considering lines again WHY? quality ok if selection quite limited  cleanliness which might attributed its newness give 3 stars instead two  But really just ok fear many Yelpers drunk kool aid  just low expectations general  <EOR> Didn't me  all hype pretty disappointed such mediocre food    guess other people but personally feel wasn't worth wait all <EOR> Well say chicken fresh great  All workers friendly nice  hate traffic drive thru but guess worth wait! <EOR> Amazing service amazing food! Reynolds took order provided great information really helped quality service order I'd expect favorite fast food chain  Keep up! any location available well because its good! <EOR> My first last time visiting location  process drive through people quickly possible  But fail quality check when hand customer food especially through drive thru  When say quality more quantity  very upsetting when back work hand food four main items missing  drive back wait line start process over  new location new staff but standards bet am only happened to  <EOR> As pull two lane drive thru notice left people ordering through intercom while right live person  opt right no particular reason  Three cars gone past left front looks long winded conversation between employee person driver's seat car  While am huge fan human interaction good customer service ten o'clock pm just want chicken strips soft buttah  also thinking myself just don't want wait line employee gives doctoral dissertation   Finally immediately feel guilty being impatient  girl chipper sweet polite  taking order she clearly deserves five stars being nice having deal public  drive give money another chipper employee calls first name  Nice touch    I drive food window two more employees chipper prompt both call first name  Five star drive thru service game   One star missing because sweet tea sweet enough tasted water  Also particular location does carry coleslaw  guess am only likes coleslaw fried chicken? SUPER pleased try super food salad glad opted large  coleslaw disappointment immediately dissapated trying salad  think need package nutmix  buy bulk  Delicious    I really can't tell hoopla Caine's  prefer chicken Chic Fil 100% more  much more tender sauce can't beat!   One friends won't eat restaurant due political stance towards company  Super glad live country where all voice opinions  opinion few companies left dynamic positive culture shown through through way employees interact public while also serving consistently good food  <EOR> Don't say didn't warn drive through situation complete cluster fuck  Unfortunately due traffic but location's unsensical placement traffic cones order taking  management location needs take some lessons learn deal volume  creating issues nothing  line becomes two then again speak three different people just your order Jesus Christ shouldn't hard  just want pick goddamn chicken sandwich drive away  Fuuuuckk! <EOR> My new hot spot!

Food gooood! <EOR> Very friendly service spicy chicken sandwich nice hot very juicy wife grilled chicken sandwich she enjoyed very much   <EOR> It breaks heart leave review  am avid supporter Chick fil A really never bad experience  Granted haven't amazing experiences every time gone chick fil but most above average  wasn't point  Food good gave them three stars  Knocked two off because customer service wasn't snuff  wait line 5 minutes upon arriving when register order  delicious sounding watermelon mint lemonade advertised asked if extra versus standard lemonade  kid register said no  didn't wait long order sat down  looked through receipt sure enough extra charge lemonade size small btw   Well decided honest mistake don't worry it    just eat off  hard think bad thoughts when stuffing your face delicious crack nuggets! lemonade good! good ran refill  GUESS WHAT!!!? wouldn't refill watermelon mint lemonade!! Yeah heard me  team lead tried explain free refills just watermelon mint flavor  perplexed asked plain lemonade which ok refills on  sat down enjoyed ice cream again ran drink  knew wasn't able more lemonade watermelon flavor but still didn't understand why couldn't when single place menu advertisement stated free refills prohibited  also noticed big wig manager dealing lady clearly perturbed something  overheard saying e could give anything she liked right  said myself guess only having issues today attempted talk original team lead why couldn't watermelon mint lemonade? Same answer dismissed basically  hindsight should've talked big wig some answers but looked he having bad day already  Perhaps high standard experience seems petty but being former chick fil employee heart Georgia know service customer satisfaction goals chick fil guys don't it  just opened month two ago recognize most kids new and aren't hospitable south but concerns questions customer matter when pay extra money something am told can't free refill when specifically stated cannot then gonna satisfied  matters worse drive almost 30 minutes eat here! invest time money place love but if treated dollar sign instead person just another establishment  pray chick fil opening north Vegas point! Good food mediocre service annoyingly horrendous parking lot situation people smoking outside tables in front employees landed visit weaksauce 3 star review  <EOR> yummy chicken sandwich delicious fries! staff nice well  Every time Vegas stop lunch my Kids loves well  <EOR> Went first day food when done paying literally  Great service great restaurant chain  <EOR> The line wasn't bad but confusing employees seemed confused  took 2 people take order which simple  moved Midwest know food should taste disappointed  sandwich looked some stepped it  top bun almost non existent pickles tough take them off because couldn't bite through it  kids meal wrong but course realized when home 25 mins away  Hopefully work kinks step quality  <EOR> I grand opening quality food marginal place very disorganized   would recommend place anyone just bunch greasy nasty food <EOR> This place want frequent when crave chicken Food great!
