I also bummed no longer offer vegan soft serve which still advertised menu   really looking forward trying all honesty real reason wanted first place   If you've never vegan pizza don't often recommend trying it   just wasn't  extremely amazing compared others in LA    Basic crust veggies diya cheese    But must say grateful offer vegan options!   Ps   olives super salty don't them ruin taste and love olives   <EOR> I live near downtown looking forward trying place   First time thought service kind slow 5 mins slice but since wasn't any particular hurry didn't matter   pizza pretty good but pricey   today never going back   Incredible jerks operate place  Ordered slice then sat down   Wait wait wait then finally counter don't even decency come over apologize making order   Guy behind counter says give 30 seconds he shoves slice oven   Apparently wasn't only screwed over   While he discussing another botched order customer he takes slice oven then shoves over counter without word if magically know  me   Kinda service I'd expect new york but here   If don't care your customers then somewhere else     This time pizza pretty mediocre   wasn't hot 30 secs oven   Crust rubbery sauce tasted can   Probably because sitting all day reheated it   Definitely worth $5   If you're town don't waste your time money eating dumps this    pizzas look decent maybe they're good when fresh but considering service mediocre slices worth trying again    There's better places around town pizza    BTW brunette behind counter both times obviously hates job doesn't dealing people maybe she's complete nit   Since live close asked if took phone orders did validate parking    going hassle plaza parking pay but hey if pizza parking few hours then might worth it   She says 'no'   used but stopped   Now your ticket validated casino machines she points down hall  Okay validate parking but machine right? She says don't know then she into long rant used stamp tickets blah blah blah   Geez lady c'mon simple question  <EOR> Every time visit Downtown 3 4 times per year stop PopUp getting couple pieces Fremont style pizza   Love it!
