So glad friend lives right <EOR> The breakfast sandwiches breakfast burrito tops  people happy friendly every time gone  lady New Awlins accent calls everyone baby obviously badass   The layout could more efficient  seen lot people unsure where order even though Lulu's people try attention  Seating little sporadic   The plastic tops put some to go containers melt need replaced something less melty   Overall place 5 minutes house pretty dang happy new breakfast option  S O B  sandwich kicks butt probably eat everyday forever  <EOR> The place hard find but literally hidden treasure  staff all friendly personable  dinner sister whom spilled coffee nephew helped clean up  ordered nice dirty chai sister black coffee  When ordered breakfast the New Years resolution Benny came quickly delicious food  bbq sauce bit sweet but all beautifully prepared  When tried free sample French Loaf immediately grabbed go  mean perfect  Buttery fluffy mmmm mmm mm  definitely going back!! <EOR> Best breakfast joint town   Menu die bakery take home other goodies once all done eating  <EOR> Ahhh mazing! eaten twice cappuccino perfect Seriously hard come breakfast sandwich filling    return buy bread  <EOR> I'm sure all hype about    impressed  Came today wasn't busy able order right away looking menu realized wasn't much eat  When eat vegan primarily pescetarian without eating eggs dairy  Needless say very limited options those dietary restrictions  Coffee also sub par    I thought layout strange another restaurant connected pizzeria believe  No idea if same owners if even more weird  asked if Lulu's served mimosas not  However restaurant connected Lulu's huge bar  Could ordered bar brought over? No idea no direction given  Again going back being very strange layout   Another reason bad review because workers very unprofessional  Eating dining room during shift break  understand people need eat employees breaks  However almost certain if health inspector came saw happening Lulu's would fined certainly given downgrade code  work service industry biggest pet peeves  Eating front guests no no    If avid Eater Vegas reader seen Lulu's place read also please think again if live far worth drive  live downtown don't believe worth drive there  <EOR> Lulu's great place breakfast  sometimes hard find good meal off strip vegas place hit spot only fun yummy but services excellent too  <EOR> Lulus proves yet again getting away Vegas strip yields reasonably priced gems  Tartine version eggs Benedict several options ingredients best part flavors aren't destroyed over smothering hollandaise sauce  Homey wood floors travertine table tops exposed beam ceilings  Worth visit assuredly new favorite breakfast spot  And blessedly      no smoking  <EOR> As others said place great younger staff great but older woman sun glasses rude  Doesn't social skills all  Tossed straws receipt then walked away  really funny but rude be  Wont again unless she leaves place but idunno if she manager owner  Grumpiness emitting women turn off no place Lulu's imho  <EOR> This place super cute! feels homey welcoming soon walk in  cutest items foods sale  ordered egg scramble potato hash great!

Once figured girl behind counter asked if she could take order   started tell she turned started talking someone else     Even though only 4 people front took 15 full minutes time ordered time paid system flawed   When asked water ordered most complicated drink ever   Then course water thing empty   Waited another 25 minutes food which course came no silverware   then all food good!  husband ordered egg sandwich he said fast food restaurants better ones   frittata which came salad grilled bread   salad soaked dressing inedible   frittata no flavor   did chocolate croissant yummy give them that   Otherwise total disappointment  <EOR> Tried place first time today  Every other breakfast place around packed boyfriend decided give shot  Nice hipster look but confusing ordering process  order counter pay your food before sit  U sit wait your server bring food but able your own coffee but cant your sugar silverware  weird  But food great!
