On brighter note sunny side eggs looked beautiful  pancakes came hot maple syrup side  tasting everything some good news but mostly bad news hash browns surprisingly way looked tasted terrible! Greasy grease tasted OLD! YUCK!! eggs cooked perfectly although no seasoning them all which easily rectified shakers table  pancakes overcooked  When cut into them top layer separated rest chewy  If they'd just cooked minute two less     Hubby said omelet good decent size  tried chunky potatoes which good great but markedly better hash browns  portion size potatoes small too  toast fine    Our server never came tried food ask things were   We flag down check   We disappointed experience Blueberry Hill especially hearing such great things it! might back more time try again  Maybe just having bad day? If post another review then  <EOR> On way home work day saw restaurant way parking lot seemed pretty packed decided inside  When food came waiting waiter 15 minutes  overall size price good but taste seemed below par  If want breakfast place would recommend IHOP over place anytime  <EOR> One word Roaches! saw 2!  Living Vegas all seen share roaches there  However because roaches nocturnal see walkway between table bathroom baby roach then walkway back door table way much! just all 11 am  Isn't sign infestation? tried somebody's attention but staff busy stop! just left  extra observant left noticed areas under cooking surfaces disgusting! place needs health inspector terminator  never said would return place until today!     Oh before roach sightings asked waitress fork  She gave one  dirty!  husband finally gave use      never would written review overworked staff  management fail  But post roach issue!  The food good but cant help but wonder much flavor added roach droppings!  should start using bathroom BEFORE consume restaurants food!

That's reason why giving place 5 stars  Very rarely place find something absolutely love first time trying it  those places  It bit more expensive thought going but worth it  I would definitely again recommend others too! <EOR> Place real busy but 75% time good dinning experience time service little slow even when place empty but food always good side give 6 10 may 7 <EOR> Since moving Vegas looking place this  all fairness only ate breakfast   wait am saying only ate breakfast  fantastic  But just saying did eat any lunch dinner options  Based menu though look good selection  diner family restaurant feel  reminds restaurant back SC used regular  Anyways pancakes country fried steak etc  very good  best Vegas see another posts but easily second book  Definitely worth visit if there  only small complaint service little slow she tried deliver plates another table  But very busy  return though because food darn good! <EOR> Will come back eat again see previous review but BF quest try all pie Vegas closest convenient stops    We took whole cherry pie home selection 4fruit types few cream filled ones selection day  more extensive pie flavor selection rotate special order 24 hours notice    It pretty decent but standard American diner pie  Enjoyed didn't love next spot    For solid pie though bump star A OK  <EOR> Breakfast Breakfast Breakfast  seems might recurring theme life here  I seem eat breakfast ton!!
