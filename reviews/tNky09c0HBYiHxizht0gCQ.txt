Anytime craving fresh healthy mexican food head Zaba's  no longer Chipotle!   I love Zaba's choice wheat tortillas brown rice  Last time Chipotle which awhile ago don't think brown rice  also Zaba's add fajita veggies your bowl no extra charge  also all supporting local eateries vs  chain ones   I agree others parking kind sucks there  doesn't even connect shopping center Marshall's Target  around other entrances    I normally chicken steak shrimp bowls  All cooked wonderfully seasoned well  recently trying tacos which fat tacos filling always falling cause much  <EOR> Excellent  Basically Chipotle but larger menu its local chain national one  cheese dip some kind lime friend didn't loved it  each own  burrito fat packed dripping goodness  Absolutely going become mexican enjoyed restaurant better Chipotle Roberto's large margin  <EOR> Although see comparison feel Chipotle say huge fan Chipotle limited menu though admit long time since there    Moving big fan Zabas eat often point husband didn't even tell them order would just know when saw him  usually shredded beef tacos burritos though taquitos they've recently added menu really good well    The staff always really friendly cost reasonable get  Highly recommended  <EOR> I love zabas its few places eat repeatedly   The chicken wonderful seasoning its subtle first but more eat better is     I find steak bit bland times save when just looking little bite   They added shrimp few months ago omg don't even seafood shrimp anything but shrimp tacos here? Wonderful   very nice alternative beef chicken normally eat   I own combos some favorites   For breakfast breakfast burrito wheat tortilla made chorizo real eggs potatos teensy bit pinto beans lot cheese   For lunch tend flour tacos chicken little bit pinto beans cheese cholula     If different mood might steak chesadilla drip some cholula along little bit pinto beans side   Its awesome   Many coworkers another commenter love fish tacos personally bit afraid sea food but day take plunge maybe   o_0  Everything made fresh chips guac the fresh guac awesome unfortunately being allergic onions avoid except small amounts salsas chicken beef   Nothing comes bag premade except tortillas!    Wow wish could over time I'd some tonight  ^_^  Oh iced tea lovers use fresh brewed shrangri la brand iced tea which personally find nonbitter drink without any sort sweetener  <EOR> So Zabbas other night usually fish tacos which awesome especially chipoltle ranch time decided just side salad change  When asked extra scoop beans because asked no rice worker rude could believe it  ask 3 times asking extra nice just she would finish making nicely  actually 4 salads total nothing special extra but asked dressing sour cream side bc taking them go  worker girl tells girl register give sides Spanish  didn't think anything until paid filled drink then  put some napkins bag  noticed all she put two sour cream sides chipotle ranch  back ask more she extremely rude  Took two containers barely put any ranch them pushed them over did something wrong  Wow Im sorry I'f your having bad day but why taking me? never known them rude Stingy before  really food ill probably back but really hope those employees better mood! <EOR> The food solid people generally quite friendly  local Las Vegas based version Chipotle but seafood options  generally when complete disregard cholesterol order 3 shrimp tacos loaded rice potato sour cream chipotle ranch cheese  Try 'em way you'll Guy Fieri calls Flavortown    Just kidding  You'll still Henderson  But tacos delicious  <EOR> Always friendly always fast  Fish tacos amazing you wait them fry but worth wait    Best quick Mex place town  <EOR> This first visit Zaba's  Without Yelp wouldn't even known place existed!

AT LEAST KISS GIVE SOME VASELINE BEFORE SCREW ME <EOR> First all just  point Zabas comparison Chipotle wait      right   no comparison! Zabas  more options choose fresher food all around better service    always Zaba Bowl shredded beef lettuce potatoes cheese pinto beans   I even ventured shrimp time  also fabulous! friends bring often burritos never heard complaint any them  location or any loacations actually never offered any sort bad service lack great food  if ever come visit Las Vegas   highly recommend stopping Zabas! <EOR> Really guys?? 1 07 extra cheese?? don't even tell before charging me  so just paid 9 00 burrito??  I didn't notice charge till home getting ready dig in   I've coming 2 3 times week nearly 3 months seems bit cheap unnecessary  at least warn youre going tack extra charge    My Zabas kick oficially over  I won't back  <EOR> Quick tasty fresh options   This fast food pretty healthy depending options pick  This Subway where build your own taco burrito bowl salad quesadilla nachos    whatever  You tell them want don't want included  They usual chicken beef    but also shrimp fish  So    put together all kinds combinations   Plus quick 10 minutes even if there's line  Note    if order fish    takes bit longer because cook fresh its ordered  <EOR> Zabas    your best friend   When anyone says Vegas always ask them oh know Zabas?    hundreds random dining places choose but every time ask random burrito joint 10 miles strip  Why? Probably because Home favorite burrito world   Steak beans fajita potatoes cheese lettuce plenty hot snaauce   basically Chipotle lack better reference steroids   Picture good ol' Chipotle but bigger burritos or bowls tacos quesadillas more options meats fillers sauces   Did mention potatoes yet?  Sweet fried   Great quality all around     Tip F r e d  P o t t o e s   Yum  Stop reading  Go  <EOR> I very disappointed   really wanted place being locally owned run but food par compared Cafe Rio even Chipotle   ordered fish salad saddly breaded flavorless   salad small unimpressive   wife fish taco's did tortilla nor fish also   sadly would repeat  <EOR> I can't believe people call rip off Chipotle just because similar business models  Qdoba Cafe Rio among others  isn't reason dislike restaurant it? Plus+++ Zaba's locally owned operated something those other folks aren't   Best build your own burrito town  those nachos die for! salsas made fresh daily good true  Wheat flour tortillas white brown rice regular sweet potato  great selection made fresh delicious food  could easily eat Zaba's every day week  <EOR> It's Q'doba Chipotle baby then American family adopted baby  Seriously great idea sweet potatoes roasted potatoes ingredient options!  You through line would Chipotle choose your entree type taco burrito salad etc then choose ingredients sauces  If you're mood healthy version Q'doba burrito side queso sauce taste delicious familiarity without fast food calories    Anyway salad chicken burrito chicken both ridiculously fresh good  try tacos next time smaller portions because those burritos ENORMOUS! <EOR> If could give less then 1 star would  chicken Zaba bowl lunch break only discover red roach chicken ate half bowl  took back manager looking solid minute told over over chili he tore hands  definitely chili  uploaded photo people own conclusion  Everyone shown agrees being bug  disgusted NEVER eat again  gross! <EOR> I love burritos Zabas actually prefer them over Chipotle becuase offer more variety such wheat tortillas sweet potato  meats always tender well cooked  only negative charge little things extra cheese sour cream but overall solid burrito  Inside clean never crowded  <EOR> Nice alternative Chipotle  offer whole wheat tortillas brown rice cant imagine healthy but tasty cabbage your burrito  chicken very good cabbage huge  fish tacos also good  Want try bowl sometime  <EOR> I am going give place only 3 stars   reason today ordered Vegetarian bowl people behind counter NO IDEA meant   did know included guacamole tried charge it   Even though fajita vegetables bell peppers onions apparently included Vegetarian Bowl place want charge extra     So guess Vegetarian bowl eyes same any other item but without meat   menu even specifies guacamole included but clueless   If vegetarian items include any all vegetables available see point visiting place again   lot competitors give desire without question   Hopefully someone management read respond otherwise RECOMMEND place Vegetarians  <EOR> First impressions always great ones  Zabas left shrugging shoulders thinking just don't   walk looks copied Chipotle decor layout wise  didn't copy Chipotle offering diced potatoes whole wheat tortillas did see sweet potatoes?   My burrito made fast but chips no chips guac me  weird placement fountain drinks kind awkward enough napkins if multiple dispensers even stocked which weren't    So grab seat start massive burrito  while good wasn't great  Even going back getting hot salsa pour didn't help  chicken just blah  Compare Chipotle where add some minor spices found myself wishing little bit more seasoning    Overall wasn't bad but wasn't anything jumping down joy thinking found local alternative Chipotle either  3 Stars   ho hum may back try again may not  nothing would special trip for   I've drove 110 miles way Chipotle more once  don't see Zabas getting kind love me  <EOR> One few places eat regular bases still keep body shape  Healthy food taste great  Chipolte thought going here <EOR> It does remind chipotle but many more options  fish tacos which pretty good fresh! However didn't taste authentic other places to  Also pretty pricy $8 3 tacos  some sister's quesadilla which delish! <EOR> This school cafeteria places where behind glass ask want   Well salad shrimp   problem think almost 10 00 salad wayyyyyy over priced   good but doubt if ever come back   Unless someone else paying it  <EOR> Found recommendation plummer hidden Eastern but worth investigating quick meal take home food good!! Better then Chipoltle opinion better variety portions large dissapoint staff friendly helpful  guac could eat spoon delish    Try ! <EOR> One best things remember high school numerous trips Zaba's friends weekday lunch dinner random weekend excursions  Since going college whenever back home always want Zaba's point during stay   Similar Chipotle its menu cafeteria style set but light years better taste quality selection  Zaba's offers many options health conscious brown rice wheat tortillas sweet potatoes fajita vegetables killer as well super fresh green salsa  menu spans typical carnitas carne asada chicken alternative shrimp fish vegetarian options     Yeah may Chipotle Seattle  I'd rather just wait come home eat Zaba's  <EOR> I'll way first see comparison Chipotle but personally don't even Chipotle but really enjoy place!   The menu much larger Chipotle's some yummy things haven't seen other places  sucker pesto sauce incredible  also offer sweet potatos regular potatos your bowls burritos  queso pretty awesome always side it! Prices high side but quality great  When low carbing bowl smidgen black beans white meat chicken lettuce tomatoes sour cream cheese pesto sauce happy camper indeed! <EOR> After long drive CA Vegas needed food fast! Eastern Ave easy off highway stop before getting into mess strip  I saw Zaba's local Chipotle style chain stopped here  Were many restaurants now would likely give 4 stars but most places just better Zaba's Sure  two kinds potatoes add your bowl burrito taco salad but rest standard nothing really stood taste  Take back Cilantro Pesto put salad AMAZING!!! The rest boring  Nothing really warm food piping hot  I salad everything except meat fine all due pesto  The man burrito didn't say much assuming fine stellar  My son kids quesadilla potatoes super cheap $2 99  Service bit lacking no really understood much english but place clean spacious  $17 lunch 3 great but don't think would bother come back much good food area  <EOR> Very much Chipotle but I'd give Chipotle higher reviews   Guy taking orders very familiar menu definitely 'training mode' but wasn't anyone assisting slowed process down   very close where work wouldn't drive far again eat there  <EOR> I lived Vegas 9 years ago frequented Durango Zaba's worked same plaza  always amazing service always wonderful  also Eastern W  Flamingo locations trips visit  just great  Now moved back  all think about  People compare them Q'doba Chipolte    But there's no comparison me  While Michigan frequented Q'doba because Chipolte does nothing us  But now eat Zaba's only option  Chicken bowl wonderful fish tacos amazing  <EOR> I remember back day when location first opened  We're talking few years back  awesome manager comped meal every time brought new customer insisted they'd better Chipotle  always agreed   They still doing great job come whenever chance  Food amazing fresh  noticed fixed menu haven't seen before  try veggie burrito  am used building own  <EOR> Visited Zabas neck woods last night    that? Did just ask if wanted Wheat Tortilla?    brown Rice      Hmmm Something did seem right  chicken breast delicios warm wheat tortilla brown rice HOT salsa  place pretty good  see resemblance Chipotle when walk but food beats chipotle far  parking lot tricky would only complaint  Great Food comfortable atmosphere Crappy Parking else ask for!? <EOR> This place reminded another Chipotle  friend ordered fish tacos  supposed best there  didn't Chipotle Ranch dressing though  tacos ok corn exterior cabbage lettuce interior Btw fish takes 3 minutes cook  Everything seems made fresh order  Most workers didn't speak English another worker repeat translate preferences filling several times  Overall tacos good  could them any four salsas mild pico de gallo medium fresh corn salsa green tomatillo salsa hot roasted tomato red chile   also other items balsamic vinagrette chipotle ranch homemade guacamole  Everything supposedly fresh! all looked pretty fresh tasted fresh believe it!   The food bit pricey get  fish tacos 3 already cost $8 tax! Geez! could gotten more authentic tastier bigger tacos Fausto's!  We actually arrived 5 minutes until closing able accomodate us  service! felt bad left 10 receiving order   why giving them 4 stars! <EOR> I love place!!! hidden gem plethora fast food options around area  fantastic toppings sweet potatoes some very yummy dressings  If you're need something quick you're mood Mexican forget chipotle here!! <EOR> Love Zaba's!!!
