Lola's burger never frozen lean beef patty lettuce tomato mayo mustard  Knowing typically gets served shocked see puny burger show front me  meat ok flavor but no char totally overcooked beyond medium rare ordered  bun thin small way generic  tomatoes very red fairly weak mayo mustard barely present  Overall nothing juicy online menu claims really questioned whether need try burger every single place town just case secret amazing burger  starting think answer no  Everyone put burger menu satisfy odd person group doesn't want eat amazing Louisiana food  served pizza everyone else getting but if nothing great then what's point? certainly exceptions rule but need start limiting myself restaurants know sure provide something least somewhat worthy reviewing   The fries other hand actually pretty good  sure if entirely fresh but cooked really well skin decent amount seasoning  lots little crunchy bits but wish bit more larger pieces weren't many actual fries chow down burger  meal came $12 42 iced tea extra dollar completely melted swiss cheese basically far much burger meal caliber  don't think need reiterate shouldn't come burger plenty great Louisiana style food can't wrong just stick that  <EOR> This actually second time here  first time phone died could check in  Shrimp Grits Garlic Bread Gumbo why came back 2nd round  love all things NOLA close without heading south  always stop list  Also love off strip no hassle plenty parking  <EOR> Some friends Lola's weekend  same group friends traveled NOLA couple years ago  When heard place give try  place very small like would NOLA employees very friendly  soon walked greeted very nice hostess  She didn't table but offered but very attentive while waited  took advantage opportunity enjoy Abita Strawberry while waited  Once table ordered gumbo crab dip appetizers  Both selections good  should asked some file gumbo but good  crab dip delicious  Main course jambalaya shrimp extra sausage waitress's suggestion  Full NOLA love looking for  split bread putting good measure  took while cab busy day but no worries just ahead ordered some more Abitas chatted staff let good times roll  definitely visiting again  plans second location near future  Keep good work  <EOR> No frills good Louisiana Southern cuisine   Red Beans Rice cooked low n slow just mention hold scallions LOL  Now meat review would've given 4 5 stars back fire due seating location   curbside table ever busy W  Charleston Blvd left sucking down exhaust while eating good food  <EOR> The yelpers came through again  chose place based mostly highly starred yelping  lovely lively little place very good food  hit tail end weekday lunch rush   tried shrimp grits   scrum! Really moreishly creamy grits perfectly grilled shrimp spicy oily sausagy sauce  Just right size portions too  Left room desserts! Hubby bread pudding sweet potato pecan pie chantilly cream  Both divine but mine took cake!!   Only very minor drawback couldn't really take parents because they're low sodium diets  food brink being overly salty it's outside realms possibility am more salt sensitive general populace but spice balance otherwise excellent  defo back looking forward trying more delectable looking menu choices  giant menu but really hard time choosing because everything looked appealing    Ace place   go see yourself! I'm updating 5 stars  back many times since first visit can't find fault  bigger second location would fab  Hope success continues! <EOR> Shrimp grits delicious!!!!! Gumbo good  roast beef style sandwich was    ehhh  I'd give place 5 star if cheaper because portions small  Don't let big bowl fool you   its pretty shallow  Good customer service! <EOR> Sure there's plenty great food near Strip but sometimes good away casinos check rest Sin City   Lola's good excuse so   Had catfish grits brunch   grits cheesy perfection flavorful creamy   catfish seasoned well nice balance salty spicy smoky   fish itself however betrayed LV's location middle desert   hadn't gone bad but clearly wasn't fresh river bottom  guess should expected much   Friend etouffee   Reported tasty but best life   The service prompt friendly   Decor curious mix sports bar meets family dining   Unassuming could call it   Overall nice little restaurant when want moment calm collect yourself before throwing more good money bad  <EOR> I've come handful times but haven't chance write review until now   food very good seafood always very fresh   po boy some other dishes   jambalaya better gumbo pretty good too   only reason took away star price   $20 tip bowl gumbo drink   little pricey lunch especially considering hungry again few more hours  <EOR> My fiancée coming off little over year  restaurant pretty small which both good bad good because cozy intimate bad because often takes 30min+ seated   Lola's taken some creative approaches finding places seat more people vacant corridor next restaurant outside front other businesses etc  While commend ingenuity unfortunately service falters when sitting areas   last note given incredible business Lola's receives expected sturdier table perhaps candle atop ambiance would've inexpensive investment business  The po' boy Guy Fieri ate DDDs indeed delicious but $11 49 expected bigger sandwich   tried most menu point addition being unreasonably expensive flavour also lacking   mention most come 5 shrimp literally cup rice then whatever accompanying sauce may be  Here's biggest secret Lola's most compelling reason return bananas foster bread pudding! simply most delicious dessert ever had! If come Lola's if nothing else try dessert!  If hostess friendlier food more reasonably priced portioned better would've given Lola's 4 5 star review but feel restaurant coasting DDDs visit tourism rather perfecting dishes customer's experience  <EOR> I ordered blackened salmon green beans French fries  Though portion size salmon huge flavor extremely bland  bland point salt pepper didn't help  green beans sad  won't elaborate  french fries good  Ate them all  Ummm overall wouldn't recommend anyone  <EOR> What little diamond rough!

We lunch pleased menu   offered lot yummy NOLA specialities things remembered home especially Po Boys   Let tell nothing beats good shrimp Po Boy book know ordered that!  also catfish Po Boy because second best sandwich world if say so   Well food came good little better average but didn't blow socks off   ate everything plate meaning entire sandwich each all fries but still little hungry   didn't time dessert because crazy 18 month old didn't sample any desserts which did look good but enough deal crazy monkey   It seems price paid sandwiches $12 each would full eating every single scrap food them   know Lola's imports bread seafood NOLA am sure why prices little higher would expect especially Downtown   think would worth if extra piece fish each sandwich maybe extra piece yummy Gulf shrimp price little more reasonable   actually talking neighboring table lot same comment price order entrees red beans rice gumbo   food good but little high actually opinion   I would given Lola's 4 star easily but service rather lackluster   seated 10 minutes before server came over us   actually more interaction server next section because daughter crazy 18 month old mentioned above flirting blowing kisses   never any attention anyone unless she around!  Anyway if waiter think would better time but server just swamped something   hardly saw when did she seemed really care just bothered us   am sure why because super nice great tippers oh well loss   So probably give Lola's another shot next time Downtown hopefully better server  <EOR> My first trip New Orleans group co workers ones birthday   Well maybe New Orleans   Lola's celebrate over lunch   excited try it   wanted quite some time but haven't really chance until now   tried while back met disappointment particular day parking lot absolutely zero parking spots available   Today another story though   parking many seating options outside   four seated under canopy just close enough entrance barely hear music playing over sound traffic nearby Charleston Boulevard   asked if reservation but did not   did matter day seated right away   took few minutes each decide lunch day but once did waitress right took orders   chose Mama's Red Beans Rice   asked if wanted extra sausage but turned down   hindsight perhaps should considered extra   very wide but somewhat shallow bowl food showed only piece sausage resting scoop rice   menu says containes andouill smoked sausage   Something missing equation   Regardless actually very good   beans tender could be   soupy sauce well seasoned just slightest hint spicey heat   bowl coleslaw side good cabbage bell pepper liberally dressed creamy style   But stand French bread served side   buttered grilled point could see marks grill grates   gave bread subtle smokiness unlike fresh grilled burger   No doubt picking flavors grilled meats past   small scoop beans lovely ham hock meat bite bread just way go   Overall am happy first experience   wish given more slice sausage but co worker pointed ordered red beans rice received   acn say relative certainty back some time try perhaps sausage chicken jambalaya   Also desserts sound insane   bread pudding   bananas foster   even bananas foster bread pudding those can't decide   am group restaurant goers   would order heart beat   Two favorite desserts rolled into one  <EOR> First off am real Cajun Creole food fan find salty fatty bland side  Lola's overlooking ugly busy Charleston Blvd Las Vegas simple quaint inside however  definitely fancy place  Party City Mardi Gras decorations fleur de lis decor cheesy feeling bayou Creole music somewhat charming  ordered apps grilled mussels coated some tasty buttery slightly cheesy topping good but drop your knees good white baguette slices flame grilled green salad decent start  dark beer tap really good though making happy  blackened grilled chicken ordered fair again nothing spectacular  people commented enjoyed plates red beans sausage crawfish crab cakes  hubby jambalaya which he said pretty good but very big serving  He finished chicken French fries  Entrees come 2 sides your choosing green salad literally 6 7 pieces lettuce 7 8 pieces teeny tiny cucumber fragments think sliver tomato red beans coleslaw French fries  desserts looked good but shared Bananas Foster which actually delish! rum brown sugar syrup over warm bananas cold vanilla ice cream tasty!

Suggestions made try catfish grits  delicious! don't even catfish!!!   I personally ordered gumbo couldn't stop eating it!   We yet try banana bread pudding  Again heard worth it  However just luck did night went  The only things size restaurant being tiny felt very cramped  Since busy all time almost felt tiny bit rushed watching people line waiting tables   probably just though   my guilty conscious    Can't wait back try more!! Wish patio would take reservations though  <EOR> Came doing google search Diners Drive Ins Dives Las Vegas     craving cajun food specifically jambalaya opted try here   A Small divey restaurant interior adorned lots New Orleans memorabilia  paintings ornaments New Orleans Saints items etc     Along dim lighting put back time setting Louisiana     Service fantastic   outgoing server helped think aloud decision order   pic crabcake looked interesting but didn't think could finish along entree   discussed Po Boy which featured Triple D but craving good jambalaya long time   ultimately jambalaya   Big mistake   The rice jambalaya extremely mushy   Killed whole dish   Obviously freshly cooked sitting huge pot sauce hours   where chicken sausage?  Sparsely added    Why 3 stars instead 2?  Mushy riced jambalaya should never served if charging people money eat it     Just 2 cents    <EOR> The dining experience gone downhill  ordered Cajun chicken which nothing more cooked chicken breast Cajun seasonings could grabbed your own cupboard Very bland  Husband ordered Jambalaya maybe 5 shrimp which served dish small enough side dish  Some chairs black masking tape them  If you're hungry might think twice coming overpriced place  <EOR> Get'em  Get'm out!  Another stop DDD list   am sure why keep falling this   course food Killer! everything Guy seems eat   Well crab cake started Killer  mushy under seasoned tasted texture more paste inside lump crab    I shrimp grits friend blackened salmon both totally edible fact weren't bad   wish sauce grits little more viscous   began watery end   friend enjoyed Salmon but apparently slightly over seasoned areas     My partners main complaint portion size did match price   price maybe salad should come meal   Also they're grits crying loud!  cheap hominy corn   Put some more them plate four shrimp   entree right? long does take cook your grit? Joe Pesci fans Unite!  They special memorial day dessert troops course tried it   advertised cobbler but ended being more shortcake type dessert   Never the less delicious gobbled up   The final downer being rushed but we're rushing atmosphere   hadn't even full ass seat before waitress asking wanted drink   bring some water menu   almost stabbed bus boy fork when he attempted grab plate before last bite gone   Actually last bite friends salmon but jeeshhhhh ASK!  may wanted lick plate really but keep options open! Plate Lickers Unite! <EOR> Small intimate place decorated very cute staff friendly  coming back because place some if BEST blue crab cakes ever had  texture just right  come over leafy greens which good but didn't eat all spinach  it just bit much  Other then crab amazing   friend Fettuccini Alfredo topped w grilled salmon tried also very very good  Taste just right  sweet tea bomb especially heat   5 glasses  If you're Vegas local would def recommend place if you're looking different ambiance some good food  <EOR> I just say right away OMG!
