I finally decided indulge self serve wine bar  full serve Chianti looked couple sips but whatever  $19 Bucks???? OOOOOOffff!  I'm regular but wine home before sitting down dinner   Still great value dinner Summerlin   Hands down  <EOR> An incredible place   Great food HUGE wine collection  <EOR> We love coming Nora's group friends   order family style enjoy tasty meal some excellent wine   Sangria great too   Plan spending least couple hours since food made order doesn't come right away   ambiance worth wait though bring some your closest friends hot date ready nice dinner!  This restaurant definitely nicer places eat Summerlin don't your swimsuit your ripped jeans b c you'll just feel place   Staff friendly attentive   your plates table more 2 minutes once you're done eating   After dining Nora's head over Paymon's Hookah Lounge some drinks relaxation  <EOR> Love Enomatic wine system here  fill credit card card money then wine wine paying tasting go  food great servings huge feel free share  lot friends happy hour always find seat bar good time  don't know bartenders name always but he's very knowledgeable always offers suggestions food wine when loss choose  <EOR> First time several years ago wife really enjoyed it   service attentive server knowledgable   tried return couple times since but asked wait long periods elsewhere   Tonight Mother's Day made reservations seated immediately   Other everything disappointment   wine ordered asked see wine list again   Instead server practically tried force drink some other wine he declined identify   Then asked cheese charcuterie plate   what types included told just put bunch stuff kitchen  Really?  But worst when more hour ordering entre's server returned told wife Gnocci she ordered   Huh   ?  took them hour figure out?  No apology any server nor Manager   back recommend Mastrioni's Hualapai nearby instead   same price range always good there  <EOR> Just OK    Wine selection vast particularly glass but actual selections inspired no bargains   Food wants high end but just succeeds being high bland   Bread selection shockingly weak some regular italian slices some over salted focaccia  elaborate pouring three olive oils doesn't cover weak selection   From now original Nora's Flamingo better food better prices less pretension  <EOR> I've Nora's couple times guess favorite restaurants didn't realize favorite restaurant   time back because Groupon    $40 worth food $20   think menu changed because didn't seem familiar all   Much more tapas oriented now which OK us   We started torta fritta which fried dough served meats cheeses   Then arancini which baked risotto balls mozzarella cheese   girlfriend loved dish   Next polpette agro which swedish sweet sour meatballs   Also delicious   Lastly pesto gnocchi   craving gnocchi when but little disappointed Nora's take it   Just texture gnocchi craving   Overall very happy meal   Total bill $45 before taking off Groupon which means paid $25 all plus tip   server Julio pretty attentive though bit difficult understand   Wish bought more Groupons! <EOR> This place much better   Had lunch yesterday few friends   server attentive never very long without anything   supposed pouring taste wine didn't hurt     Speaking wine Nora's Wine Bar allows corkage long don't same wine stock   waiter originally told would $10 per bottle but showed $20 final bill   No biggie   brought 1999 Duckhorn Three Palms Merlot 2004 Blankiet Estate Cabernet     We things rolling slowly ordering three bruschette roasted garlic onion tomato basil mushrooms roasted peppers   None three really stood being amazing would crave   tomato basil especially disappointing just wasn't whole lot flavor it   Next ordered artisan cheese platter three selections   can't remember called but soft cheese much brie but bit more nuttiness   chose truffle cheese twice because well truffles   soft cheese good but nothing write home about   truffle cheese good great earthy quality black truffles wish little stronger flavor though   platter came candied walnuts yum some kind cranberry sauce meh delicious honey   While ate cheese saw big antipasto salad delivered neighboring table decided order it   Meats cheeses plentiful lettuce crunchy fresh tomatoes nice ripe   good salad but could used more pizazz maybe more flavorful dressing use heirloom tomatoes something   guess salad but doesn't plain   To finish meal ordered serving four lamb chops   things big meaty   ordered them medium rare could cooked more perfectly   Whatever seasoning delicious!  Maybe just salt pepper but felt licking stuff off good   It's good joint some interesting menu items   But lot dishes just don't stand very crowded competitive market discretionary funds sorry watching much CNBC lately    food just does warrant higher star rating  <EOR> The wine great meat cheese platter fantastic everything else menu made salt seasoned salt served bed salt topped side salt  felt going heart attack halfway through eating eggplant dish wife couldn't even far chicken dish    While wife would point stop work wine appetizers least once month gave trying order anything else just tasted salt lick  <EOR> For those who've eaten before aware there's considerable changes menu wine service enomatic machines    December virtually all enomatic wines changed italian wines many lacked any written descriptions supposedly because changes still getting tweaked      Kinda hard stomach paying 3 buck range only two big sips wine know zero about   back forth bartender ridiculous first exchange when simply wanted put cash existing enomatic card   New menu mentioned previous reviews   Bruschetta variety still yummy ever great snack variety mystery wine samples   Has once uber popular place now jumped shark?  You'd think times any tweaking theme somewhat pricey restaurant needs place more clientele friendly less     Oh yeah nice host Nate gone too  <EOR> ahhhhhh      mediocre best! literally tried place  5 6 times every time am trying give them benefit doubt but NO MORE! recently ate wife sister boyfriend against will! grilled artichoke start way over oiled salted oily grilled disaster  then entrees come out steak  ordered Medium came rare side Med rare but kicker next entree didn't come out literally 13 minutes after!! said something waiter he just uhhh yeah uuhh    right sorry   Um really?!? wrong answer! waited other food steak cold terrible! only thing decent Penne ala Vodka  2 other pastas BLAND lamb nothing special all! then    bill came $220 almost fell chair!
