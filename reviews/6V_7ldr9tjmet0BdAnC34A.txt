Everything staged rehearsed many times actors  think steered little bit more towards children but still entertaining adults nonetheless  favorite part show outfits all knights dancers   The show little bit shorter other shows Vegas  But still good time if you're into rowdy environments cheering king belongs section you're sitting in  also cool effects use throughout show fireworks  But warn those aren't into loud interactive places kind show isn't everyone  <EOR> Okay unexpected surprises  husband gluten free he thought he would able eat much set menu  waiter very nice  He way all way other restaurant kitchen not part tournament show brought fresh fruit desert  Amazing service  OK need restock gluten free beer because when there  kids enjoyed show but really loud  would recommend ear plugs if sensitive loud noises  <EOR> This really fun show! long short  food much better expected  Tomato soup lots flavor served piping hot  Game hen nicely seasoned melted your mouth  Potatoes veggies great  very full end  would recommend show anyone! <EOR> Dinner show fun!!

Vegetarians  Just tell waiter when first come they'll bring pasta instead whole chicken  Giving finger typical take yourself seriously Vegas just having good time  People don't care historical accuracy slightest  Czar Russia pledging allegiance King Arthur's son Chris ?

Yes if your tickets comped and or kids   If actually pay show and or aren't going kids I'd recommend seeing another show because lack content poor food choices high cost  <EOR> Amazing performance theatrical setting! storyline great kept entire family entertained  think better Medieval Times due its story line performers interacting audience throughout night  <EOR> Tournament Kings lot fun! ridiculous cheesy but all right ways  knights great eye candy!

Front row seats waiter great food hot lots food show great kids enjoyed it  kept feet thanks!!! even meet knight show take picture  <EOR> Very few family friendly shows Las Vegas   even fewer dinner shows!  Last dying breed  Tournament Kings all dancing singing sword fighting jousting maidens knights food drinks! I recommend show anyone looking enjoyable PG 13 rated dinner show  <EOR> I would giving show 3 1 2 stars If could  entertaining food good arena authentic I suppose could get  gotten tickets 2 $75 deal would definitely giving show 3 stars  Vegas many times brought husband first time something always interested seeing when saw deal tickets  show very lively! left high spirited ready fun night  also really good deal dinner included  full rest night!   What disliked show thought WAY short! could few more scenes maybe comedy scene bit more tournament  show definitely needs bit more bulking even if only 15 minutes longer  Also found waiters waitresses very distracting while watching show already blocked view because person left would sit back chair servers would also come around block views which found really annoying  felt rushed service bit could easily bused tables until show over  came give food bus food bring desert bus desert bring ordered drinks which took forever then bill back change  very distracting!   I would seriously suggest watching BEFORE plan LOVE any other Cir Du Sole shows because probably bit letdown if see Cir first  <EOR> I really enjoyed night out  isn't much bad say it  Servers super expedient getting drinks alcohol dinner dessert check throughout entire show  Story easy follow actors made very fun always involving crowd  Dinner quite delicious chicken very moist tender Jell O shots fun touch  very kid friendly abilities purchase lit swords  Overall would absolutely again when family friends come into town visit  <EOR> My friends suggested see show but didn't know wanted see  Tickets 35 00 bucks person  oh come guys 8th grade medieval larper nerds good looking people going MGM clubs going come over pick just being outside door  Just high school all over again    With said am happy went  much fun!!!!!

Much modern Las Vegas tries bill itself very sophisticated upscale   But sometimes just want fun exciting show no matter quaint dated may seem   Tournament Kings doesn't try pretend something other is just fun time entire family  <EOR> Great family event   first trip Vegas kids specifically them but hubby good time too    isn't cheap would think must better coupons $10 off hotel gives you    food better expected   If want chicken finger French fry meal child reserve advance   didn't know but very nice accommodated us   all liked little whole chicken   cooked well tasted good   Dessert apple fritter thing     very loud if bring very young children just beware  <EOR> This great show  pyrotechnics  family dined kings Windsor  <EOR> We staying Excalibur advertisement show all over place   decided give show try $10 coupon ticket came $58 which included fees tip  The theater located downstairs same area arcade kids area  arena isn't very big but time show started theater only half full   The show itself very good  actors actresses did great job getting crowd involved  prepared cheer shout more involved more fun show be  show entertaining but seemed very rushed only lasted hour half  think some parts could expanded on  The food only ok  started tomato soup reminded chef boyardee  Very soon soup main entrees brought which consisted cornish game hen potatoes biscuit    which eat without any utensils   overall tasted average  Dessert strawberry strudel  food nothing really talk but again very rushed   very little time between each course felt being rushed eat faster   plates being cleared very quickly if watch show much may miss dinner  Near end show when getting really good hard see performance since waiters busy clearing off all plates  would nice if just waited show end before walking front clear tables   It nice experience    good show mediocre food hence just three stars  <EOR> + Norway hot    everything else     PROS it's show comes food   show pretty interactive very family friendly if kids i'd suggest show    food actually pretty decent   but bland if wasn't salt   CONS can kind cheesy but bad      WHY DID GO?? I newbie vegas pretty much said down everything friends wanted do   friend suggested dinner show which hesitant say yes begin mainly because $70 taxes fees included rather spend little more money super good show   which kind turned true   granted showed little tipsy LITERALLY fell asleep during show but friends said king the section sit in Norway pokin fun drunk girl passed second row   so glad provide entertainment everyone   but dinner show ok   probably wouldn't see again just because type thing   unless kids then i'd take them see cause fun  <EOR> I love show but service very poor  servers RIDICULOUSLY rude unfriendly  better note food still delicious! <EOR> Horrible Food hospital Food Worth money  way better shows vegas!! <EOR> I family family friends all impressed  Food worse buffet food Vegas  Show particularly interesting engaging  Medieval times outside NY few times loved both food performance just well much worse  Disappointing really  whole ordeal short  less 1 5 hours  fortunately!
