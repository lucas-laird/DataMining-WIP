Service also bad  Would never again  <EOR> One first places tried upon moving LV  early avoid crowd around 5 30 Monday   seated immediately ordered drinks  First tried House Tripel which good if tad malty taste  Then North Coast Pranqster absolute favorite beers golden fruity  decent price $4 pint since HH  Drinks food arrived fast  Baja Fish Street Tacos incredible! very big portions but combined beer enough fill up  definitely back more  Can't wait try again friends  Highly recommended  <EOR> I don't think would ever tried place if someone hadn't given gift card but am glad did!    Looking outside kind place   don't drink big noisy crowded bar restaurant known beer selection didn't really appeal me  But said     gift card hubby gave shot   We've TWICE now extremely impressed both times     The first time sat patio which really nice comfortable   little chilly day worried would cold but hostess really nice let see felt before committing outside seat   turned just fine because little space heaters which worked perfectly   On Yelp recommendation ordered truffle fries appetizer or snack think called it    delicious but found later if your entree comes fries upgrade them truffle fries as well garlic fries sweet potato fries onion rings just dollar more TON fries  way more $4 snack portion  if you're interested trying them would route instead   Anyway hubs favorite thing earth Mac n Cheese he disappointed   tried bite agree pretty darned tasty   grilled cheese tomato basil soup say    most delicious grilled cheese ever life    some big words cuz some pretty good grilled cheeses time!    About halfway into though started feel arteries clogging looked small puddle oil collecting plate feeling really guilty much enjoying it   think must slathered each slice bread full stick butter then used 2 pounds thick cut full fat cheese   No WONDER tasted good! pretty happy dessert menu crappy because wasn't even least bit tempted order some more fattening food   On visit #2 took inside seat which still nice but very loud   If you're date would suggest taking patio seating which seemed bit more quiet   But warned    even loud   isn't quiet restaurant any means   This time started lobster crab artichoke dip   Another good choice   husband some kind monster sized burger garlic fries here's where found upgrade crab cake sandwich onion rings   Nothing bad say any that!!  I feel price good quality food level service receive here   ordered appetizer two entrees each visit both times bill came $40 $45 tip   Well worth fabulous meals some leftovers eat next day   We'll definitely back  <EOR> So walk 1 AM hostess asks many people tell 2  Then she soon realized became 1 01 AM proceeded tell stop serving 1 AM but failed tell still drinks BASICALLY kicking minute 1 AM? joke right  going pick 2 menus right when you're walk around seat decide late?

greasy Kim chi top made cold soggy     probably give them another chance enjoy chain's food  <EOR> I've twice combined rating both experiences   The first time April 6pm girlfriend   ordered Chilled Edamame Grilled Sweet Korean BBQ Beef half portion Ahi Crunchy Salad  also ordered glass pinot noir large bottle sparkling water  can't recall friend ordered only going write experience  waitress seemed friendly enough however she spoke fast difficult understand her  placed order didn't see almost 20 minutes  runner delivered friend's drink sparkling water however pinot noir no where found  Then edamame came friend's appetizer still no wine  asked another waiter not ours bc still couldn't find her if could check wine  next courses came  Korean BBQ Beef which hot tender great sweet tangy flavor white jasmine rice hot perfect stickiness   started eat but wanted wine meal ate slowly  10 minutes later ask yet another waiter status wine find waitress finally brought wine 15 minutes later  Korean BBQ Beef still good though even though cold waiting pinot noir  salad came shortly yet another waiter then original waitress came said she transitioning table another waiter since she going break which laughable bc she break 45 minutes  new waitress asked if wanted order dessert which did scoop caramel ice cream  GF also placed take away order husband bring home assumed while waited food waiter would bring dessert  But instead brought dessert when brought take away food  eat ice cream really fast take away food wouldn't cold    Food Score A Service Score D+ Atmosphere B+ a little loud but fun ively The second time  YH Sat night during Memorial Day Weekend  place packed put wait list then bar  Fortunately 2 seats opened bar decided eat bar instead which good bc knew drink would come much faster time  bartender friendly took beverage order right away while looked menu  both Stellas then ordered Onion Rings Tower Hummus start  food came pretty quickly onion rings nice crispy hot but hummus runny slimy weird taste didn't finish dish  liked Korean BBQ Beef dish first time ordered again main while husband ordered Spicy Jambalaya Brown Rice  food came timely manner however dish very disappointing husband's came white rice took back  Instead replating scooped white rice put brown rice same plate which now total mess  husband hungry didn't want wait he ate anyway but both couldn't believe didn't replated  really looking forward dish bc good first time however time beef dry much smaller pieces almost shriveled lacking any juicy flavor last time rice also dry cold  hungry ate anyway  afraid send back bc could've worse especially happened husband's dish when he sent back  bartender asked if wanted dessert told wanted caramel ice cream she said didn't it  She told must mistaken bc menu  told last time April she said didn't but instead recommended salted caramel butterscotch pudding  ordered instead we're glad did bc quite good  Still annoying though she said didn't caramel ice cream bc just checked menu online ICE CREAM vanilla caramel mango sorbet java chip mint chocolate chip  Food Score C Service Score B+ Atmosphere B+ a little loud but fun ively I really wanted place based previous reviews  husband both hospitality industry support local businesses may give more try especially since conveniently located  Hopefully third time's charm service food both good  <EOR> Many dollars $$$$$$$$$ many years later   employees amazing food average when doesn't smell grease lousy management  Sorry Allen Hope  you guys awsome <EOR> great beer selection but just touch above average bar food  reasonably priced happy hour  <EOR> The yard house almost any beer could ever want try!

We ordered California Roll which actually just large cake sushi   supposed fancy but opinion lame staff should let people know your typical roll   Also ordered without wasabi soy sauce naturally doused it   also ordered chopped salad which unfortunately covered disgusting dressing later found bloody mary vinaigrette  missing menu description   When waitress noticed hadn't eaten much salad she asked if liked told No dressing harsh flavors don't work well together me  She replied favorite things menu shrugged shoulders   Sigh   hoped maybe she would offer remade without dressing something   But she busy waiting heck $10 waste money food   Dinner bit better   margherita pizza which admittedly pretty difficult screw up   husband some orange chicken which he said decent enough   eaten 2 pieces pizza when waitress came around asked if need box   Almost like please home now?  she brought box she left check said No rush  Which literally made laugh loud     We paid entire meal left quite disappointed fashion   going back   would've happier going Roberto's! <EOR> The food OK apps little overpriced disagree which just fruit chews cheap red wine little overpriced <EOR> I've back handful times since last reviewed Yard House time definitely earned another star me  walking door waiting seated paying bill getting to go box service great  Even when slammed wait table staff taken good care us   We big fans variety beer tap lobster garlic noodles staple table  usually visit variety people different beer preferences offer something everyone bar  server Jerri also did good job making some drink reccommendations found actually brews menu    I've ordered seared sea scallops orzo pasta wild mushrooms white truffle sun dried tomato sauce twice  first time really good which why ordered again  second round just ok  good remembered it  sea bass pretty good really organic tomato basil bisque  bisque consistent can't wrong  back soon order again  <EOR> I fro burger   rest family ended pizza   Good food  noisy gemes on   Service good  <EOR> EVERYONE PAY ATTENTION  I would give zero if could  My family came good treat week  wait fair considering asked outside seating  Although wait almost 10 minutes before being greeted  son husband ordered burger medium rare came medium well  When remade them still right temperature  just ate anyway since waited them long  Everyone else done food time ate! can't believe didn't even offer anything inconvenience  Table presence key good service here  didn't really want come back place because service  hate being profiled  gave chance since great beer selection   Which way did timely manner  pretty much hate place now!!!!!!! server lucky still tipped 15%! eat lot  COMING BACK HERE!!! <EOR> We nice drive Red Rock Casino decided hit HH Yard House   started off Victory IPA buffalo chicken wings   then proceeded try some lettuce wraps chicken pizza poke stack spinach dip seared ahi   Everything excellent especially lettuce wraps poke stack     Next beer list Boulder Beer chocolate porter nitro   Smooth delicious very creamy   remember drinking Boulder Beer way back when always thought beers very tasty no exception     The service bar excellent bartender game I believe name Aimee very attentive needs  definitely stop back try few more beers try some tasty appetizers missed  <EOR> Poke nachos best!!!

think Yard House those places if plan being sober  However excellent beer vegetarians! <EOR> We great visit Yardhouse last week   While getting some much need space kids decided spend date night Red Rock Casino   other location's mixed experiences past   night decided sit side patio misters just right temp     I selected Jambalaya she Gardein Chicken Sandwich   Throughout entire meal comparing recipe mother's home made Jambalaya first little disappointed   Once heat started kicking chunk's chicken sausage craw fish started blending mouth thoughts changed   recipe fairly respectable far Jambalaya's concerned   Nothing beats momma's home cooking but very good dish would order again     The Gardein Faux Chicken sandwich pretty decent well   Gardein products really try mimic meaty texture vegan veggie lover mind   felt texture fairly chewy juicy real breast chicken   Avocado sandwich refreshing made perfect flavor combo hot summer night    YardHouse great place try if veggie lover your group because something everyone excellent beer selection well  <EOR> I love place  happy hr great good music great srevice  food yummy  Thank all  <EOR> Consistent good food service atmosphere   My only gripe would corporate feeling it   Seems rules place staff follow force follow them whether sense not  Example 1 carded friends dad 82 years old  Sorry card everyone said   Example 2 wanted sound games  Sorry only put sound Monday Night games <EOR> My first experience Yard House fantastic one  recall having better customer service any other restaurant  hostess waiter bus boy    Wow! made feel special   I entered via entrance within casino directed front restaurant seating arrangements  hope future able seat customers both entrances   They asked if preferred indoor outdoor seating  movie two hours prior chose indoor seating just case weather acting again    Our waiter fantastic  ordered he recommended which jambalaya mac cheese  fried calamari okay still think Olive Garden's lot better  Don't forget ask extra marinara sauce   The jambalaya tasty two large shrimp atop bed linguine or jasmine rice if prefer   tasty usually fond spicy food   The mac cheese good  think better elsewhere but personal preference mine super creamy mac cheese dry if baked which think was  supposed bacon but did find any  chicken mushrooms great additions    My boyfriend raved jambalaya but mac cheese only okay  back try more entrees   Overall customer service made experience good me  don't know if due them just opening but hope stays way  <EOR> Well love Yard House  vegan selections look carnivorous  eat wings vegan wife chicken strips can't tell crazy her   chikin menu fantastic mostly morning star brand but doesn't being able eat table accommodates most diets  location standard Yard House quality definitely return  <EOR> I'm fan Yard House Las Vegas several other locations visited   review focused Las Vegas location Red Rock Casino Summerlin   I haven't tried anything don't menu no matter kind beer mood they'll something satisfy   menu something everyone beer selection even bigger!  love also chalkboard beers  special seasonal brews don't usually carry but on hand short time   sure ask since list changes often   The waitstaff always top notch friendly fast willing spend time chatting favorite beers food menu   Food comes hot good time empty plates taken away quickly your drink glass never empty   When bring young son seems always find time say hello specifically  a nice touch!

Almost buttery    garlicy mushroomy goodness  great meatless option if need one   Oh some drinks refresher he el picante marg  Mine name would suggest very refreshing!! But hubby's star imo  peppery n spicy salt rimmed sugary perfect blend! declare all margs now should come charred jalapeños!!  Oh some point also some pineapple cider    verrry pineappley hubby loved it  Lastly ended would say weakest point creme brûlée dessert  know right?! could be?? Well put banana slices top brûlée those  bananas don't wrong but think two side pieces would sufficient lacked nice crust wanted because actual creme did torched all  <EOR> About best thing say food Yard House Red Rock Casino very good beer menu! If bar food Yard House extensive menu offerings but everything recently tried less mediocre   much better bar food restaurants there      Our party four shared two appetizers Fried calamari which worse fried calamari ever had   Overcooked absolutely no seasoning bland dry disgusting    Lobster crab artichoke dip chips pita which unusual flavor quite crab dip quite artichoke lost somewhere middle  Pretty bad    one taste enough me    For entrees tried Steak sandwich which very tough flavorless cut beef bun filled fried straw onions  Awful   Turkey pot pie which undercooked pastry crust served dish seemed big wagon wheel  Way much food although filled tasty chunks turkey veggies  bad good but edible    Crunchy Ahi Salad which decent quality Ahi seared quite nicely   best dish received    Fish chips which greasy sort bland  Edible but lot going it   Service good again beer great   waiter removed calamari bill told tasteless    We won't back except maybe beer  <EOR> I am normally fan Yard House but really impressed location   Devin server awesome really made experience great one   ate lunch bf's family party 11 she able accommodate large group effortlessly   bf split hot chicken sandwich delicious!

The plate arrived least foot long piled high Fries very generous amount toppings! empty tummy's dream come true!! some reason other people table assumed share    it heartbreaking but knew needed seem nice person show inner fat self  Sharing husband hard enough taken years practice  But stilled enjoyed them immensely would certainly return eat specifically!!  We also shared salad glad ordered large because don't run quite big loaded fries  <EOR> Great weekday HH! three girlfriends all able split chicken nachos spinach dip plenty around everyone  Just sure early since place definitely fills fast  <EOR> I say never particularly impressed yard house but experience turned off much yelp account!   I would start positive say old 43 incredible drink  simple boozy enough balanced delicious  Also lettuce wraps while best ive satisfying flavorful sauces elaborate wonton bowl aspect    However service received bar left really bad taste mouth  Sorry use such hackneyed metaphor but case its stale nature fitting    Our bartender josh didnt start off terribly but made no attempt friendly but when came time pat bill he took cash then disappeared  When pointed another bartender she tracked down he made big fuss busy he clearly bothered blaming other guests saying weeded he was  am sorry but work industry textbook handle being slammed   dont say guest!  Anyway he left change overheard complaining another employee !! making exaggerated annoyed gestures direction blatantly rolling eyes  Then when he finally came back he asked much money id given him  take someones money lose track much gave still audacity them feel its fault?  The icing cake when he  finally managed give change  he said easy fix bro no apology eye contact immediately giving annoyed cold shoulder  insulting!

I've two dining experiences restaurant completely different another  enjoyable much  asked myself why  atmosphere maybe time frame?   My first time dining Yard House 3 years ago around 7 maybe 8pm  Let's just say cocktail hour  Haha  couldn't stop drooling over huge selection craft beers  Again 3 years ago  Other restaurants didn't such variety time which made beer list quite impressive  tasted ever beer least once some few times  I ordered crab artichoke dip appetizer fruity cocktails main dish  date appreciated dim lighting  think candles even scented  Maybe just buzzed  way enjoyed evening   My second time yesterday 2pm  opinion restaurant loud lacked intimacy  disappointed  Due slow service only time 3 cocktails  brewery goodness sake  felt school cafeteria  didn't know whether eat food start food fight  terrified  Kids running around everywhere  waiting servers trampled    I never step foot Yard House before 8pm  <EOR> This place usually better two stars but when two days ago wasn't really impressed   The food good but wasn't happy service    Our waiter messed order charged wrong things  He back changed but just wasn't impressed service  He just seemed lunch really paying attention needs  busy Friday night need professional waiters know job  <EOR> Went myself Monday night   gave table far door where could feel cold wind blowing main entrance   immediately told hostess did want sit might well sit outside     At new table Joseph C took order then came back tell he going 10 minute break   meal very good but quickly ran water   Joseph C finally came back did refill water   Then he disappeared again   finally walk side station own water   Another waitress came over helped me   She asked if needed waiter said no ignored whole meal why would need now?    So now Joseph C shows behind asks if want some more water   said no just bill   love he brings bill behind he doesn't face again   restaurant busy but well staffed   wouldn't show face if done such terrible job ignoring guests   no reason such poor service       So overall while food great front house staff really dropped ball leaving bad taste mouth   But money saved no tip Joseph C some great ice cream Ben Jerry's  <EOR> We enjoy draft beer tap  amazing draft variety  great food great service  assistant manager Daniel Hadobas very helpful would welcome anyone come food beer draft!! managers helped through entire process  Come restaurant great service food drinks  <EOR> I don't through casino because 2 entrances   Yard House list places frequent only Happy Hour but regular menu   haha regular dinner menu bit over priced bar average food but doesn't matter because only come HH !!! several occasions Happy Hour late night Happy Hour cusp Happy Hour lol   Things enjoy Chicken Lettuce Wraps them mushrooms instead chicken mmm Hawaiian Poke Stack watch sometimes tuna fresh though lol Spinach Cheese Dip bad but good Chicken Nachos quantity over quality   huge portion great sharing Pizzas pretty tasty Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat tastes Fruity Pebbles Light Lemon Drop Martini low cal tasty strong Spinach mushroom salad appetizer portion not HH but delicious cheap!

This second visit Red Rock location  much quieter doesn't look party going Town Square Yard House  Both restaurants friendly staff great atmosphere plethora drinks had  My favorite dish Miso Glazed Sea Bass  both visits Red Rock locale first time perfect   this time smaller bit dry don't know if off day them if quality dropped  know next time which case  giving them pass time  My husbands favorite Pepper Crusted Filet I don't blame delish time little dry also  My mom Caesar Salad Clam Chowder   both average nothing special either  No complaints drinks though    <EOR> This first places ate when moved Vegas still reigns favorites! When going eat Vegas being many options rare same place more once especially being new wanting explore  But crave place keep going back to Red Rock 2nd location Quad cool bar vibe tons beer options which where introduced new favorite Leinikugal however spell it Sunset Wheat tastes Fruit Loops! wait staff consistently friendly menu big book   and  only complaint narrowing down want order feels trying life altering decision  Ok dramatic but keep going back try all different things menu made salivate just reading  food tastes fine dining quality without stuffy restaurant ambiance  can't sing place's praises enough hope coupon something heart felt review cause still 20 menu items need try <EOR> I say frequent place least happy hour week  favorite beer choice 'blend' Rose Gaarden  bright red tastes full bodied fruity beer  half price apps marvelous deal! crab cakes delightful little bit heavier prefer yet tasty nonetheless  spicy tuna roll standby because consistently delicious  deconstructed roll course enough 2 share  Another favorite Chinese garlic noodles  egg noodles sauteed garlic butter shitaake mushrooms YUM! poke stack also delectable  also honor lunch specials until 5pm  tried lunch portion mac cheese came highly recommended friend mine  found heavy  flavors weren't bad just left feeling bowling ball belly  think mix chicken mushrooms cream sauce just much    The atmosphere loud bar  outside dining high tops much more reticent  weather afternoons lately made perfect spot nosh enjoy beer  <EOR> The food really good! Hawaiian five o which really good definitely tuna roll! Yum!   The service however wasn't very good  Olivia  She 5 tables only attention ever 1 2 hour so  restaurant 2 hours friends b day party  But isn't even fault am giving service negative review  fact 3 servers walk while raised hands tried speak them attention  servers only serve section   it  only able attention training lead  Unacceptable    Hopefully time fluke    <EOR> Really good food awesome selection beer  Especially carry Deschutes brews   Could 5 stars but its noisy suggestive sell way hard   would still back  <EOR> It decent  Love all selections different beer but food wasn't great fries cold when served them  Probably won't back because overpriced wasn't good  waitress kind rude too  Reason why getting 2 stars because least lot beer selections <EOR> Never good choice   Always feel rush pushy   food good but atmosphere negative change  <EOR> Yard House always great place eat during anytime especially Happy Hour during regular 3 6 late night!  I've all locations Las Vegas  tucked away Summerlin Red Rock Hotel Casino  Great ambiance spacious atmosphere    I've tried variety foods all great chicken nachos salads turkey sandwich calm chowder bbq chicken pizza poke nachos new favorite poke stack spicy tuna recent try gardein fried chicken strips which favorite liked regular version better    They great choices drinks always ask sangria since enough wine variety even though menu  <EOR> I while visiting family area recommendation   super thrilled service tap list   Poke nachos awesome truffle fries pretty delicious too   handled young niece pro all whimsical demands smaller child   I actually wound skipping beer list since still working off hangover but lobster mac 'n cheese since I'd heard good vitality picking appetizers   eating 1 5 mac 'n cheese decided take rest home since stomach didn't seem task hangover thought    stomach churned bit rest day felt little sick until next morning   figured I'd finally hydrated enough felt great all day until fridge late dinner    ate half remaining mac 'n cheese felt great within 30 40 minutes   stomach churned again next day     I know tough pin down bad meal didn't serious food poisoning anything but tough say mac wasn't blame   All other meals weekend shared no else any issues   stinks because mac 'n cheese looked really good big chunks lobster really enjoyed Yard House other cities before but feeling ill tough overcome   I know back beer next time town but might take some convincing add lunch schedule  <EOR> The beer selection but besides food just OK   several dishes none memorable   pricing bit high but place always clean great vibe   service OK but again nothing write home    much prefer BJ's if looking good food wide selection beers  <EOR> Place great   Beer awesome  DOES menu much Cheesecake Factory anything think it   sat bar some lunch   Ordered lettuce wraps start came meal no biggie   Bartender attentive place very clean   My only issue place nutrition   Unlike Cheesecake low cal section menu  remiss find Turkey burger yes turkey well over 70 grams fat   If homepage find nutrition facts   several meals over 100 grams fat no kidding!  They also nice lunch section more moderately priced items  <EOR> The happy hour bomb diggity! 4 6 10 12  There many beer choices tap my favorite being st bernardus abt12 appetizers half off during happy hour delicious!  usually stick gardein wings sometimes pizza onion rings also The seared tuna standout usual bar fare offers flavorful tuna steak wasabi really good!  The atmosphere nice place clean smoke free  People around bar usually super friendly well dont shy! Strike conversation while indulging great beer enjoying game s multitude televisions over bar <EOR> Alright first time huge group co workers early because take reservations every time co workers come shin dings wait ridiculous amount time  But time seated quickly served very fast out   So review based mostly fact very good vegetarian menu even meat eaters love  am talking most amaze balls buffalo tofu wings ever eaten ever  Some co workers even some themselves taste bloody great  veg menu much more salads veggie burgers fish 'n chips chicken wings fried wings even meatballs    They also some very good truffle fries California rolls app huge circle rice fish ginger  those alcohol huge selection draft beers wines  HUGE   Down sides take reservations lighting very dim especially outside wait staff slow times  once water filled all over twice told them just bring bunch am eating buffalo wings cripes sake! Anyways other few hit misses place good place come bunch friends but pretty pricey considering  <EOR> We frequent Yard House Town Square Red Rock pretty often but last night first time new menu  4 decided order several appetizers share  chicken nachos good  Possibly best nachos ever  2 sauces   a green red beans chicken guacamole sour cream CHEESE! Real shredded cheese processed cheese sauce  diet    I read few reviews yelp several people raved searing ahi tried well hummus garlic noodles shrimp lettuce wraps mushroom lettuce wraps  hummus ok but salty side  tuna disappointing say least  last piece put mouth such repulsive texture spit immediately  guess its good thing texture fowl because if swallowed probably wouldve gotten food poisoning  seems tuna previously frozen and possibly artificially dyed bright pink wasn't great overall but piece absolutely disgusting   didn't any lettuce wraps but friends said mushroom ones super salty   bordering inedible   garlic noodles decent   We really Yard House but think tries menu please everyone instead sticking really well  bar food   bf loves giant selection beers service always very good  going steer clear Asian menu items stick favorite bbq chicken salad   or when want splurge chicken nachos  <EOR> I am fan yard houses general but great   all yard houses menu choices expansive varied all appetites  tend beer menu  which gives many choices explore  review though service  time when service very hit miss restaurant team excelling  several occasions service dictate your dining experience  staff well educated menu beverages protocols  During visits even compliment server manager   that good impression he made upon us  Well done management staff! <EOR> Love happy hour here! Every time feel having drink usually sit bar  servers very friendly very good giving suggestions when comes drinks even let sample beers  favorite poke nachos very flavorful little bit spiciness because sriracha mayo top  serving size big two people share but finish everything myself  time thought try something else ordered pepperoni pizza  flavor ok nothing special also super greasy  Check place especially during happy hour  personally wouldn't regular hours unless craving Ahi Crunch which really good too  <EOR> Went last night three friends sit bar happy hour     Ray Josh bartenders awesome!    great night forgot much loved YARDHOUSE Red Rock!  Thanks guys     <EOR> Always good time Yard House  beer selection winner food definitely more so so across board  best meals Cuban sandwich Prime Rib dip sandwich  Garlic fries also very good  <EOR> Everything great   Crab artichoke dip always tastie snack tonight's Mac Cheese w chicken bacon great   Though seemed kept eating never smaller take home again    Bummer! <EOR> The food good but neither dishes actually hot off stove  jambalaya luke warm still tasted very good though boyfriends chips part fish chips cold  never brought water asked beginning meal before appetizers  When brought bf beer gave dirty glass literal dirt rings around bottom wasn't chilled all  When brought cocktail rotten brown mint leaves it     honestly young kid seemed training server did better job assisting actual server did  Maybe next time we'll try yard house town square    <EOR> I wanted love place since know everyone else found way to  waiter slow  Halibut asked without Bok Choy   it came way overcooked served top Bok Choy  don't understand why many dishes Yard House come Bok Choy   it's exciting side no flavor way serve it  <EOR> This yard house location great   hesitant trying because very mixed reviews but great time   came week night wasn't crowded   didn't seem many tourists which nice    This time around tried Tangerine Wheat which really fruity refreshing but expected little more tart bit less hoppy    My second choice House Honey Blonde loved it!  very light smooth lovely honey aftertaste  My boyfriend told would probably Boddington's tried well   very unique super tasty   kind Guinness but light   creamy feel very enjoyable  The bartenders very friendly attentive experts pouring pints  Overall think if price Yard House experience isn't deterrent then should definitely stop by   If stop during happy hour   drink specials appetizers half off   chicken nachos personal favorite  <EOR> I've various Yard House restaurants now even though chain can't seem enough them!  This location located off strip Summerlin which more convenient to   Red Rock Resort also great spot visit along mall nearby  Good food friendly staff great selection all types palettes  Love beer wine selection too  past visit pork burger no bun which they're happy do side chopped salad   Good stuff!

Darden really gone downhill  food serve especially managers hire  Since near computer overheard few servers talking miserable working here  Something managers purposely don't listen employees availability servers written smallest things  used food server when restaurants am always aware busy server dealing etc  never problem service seems morale management food overall quality just down  hard enough job servers why harder them? Especially when can't even your own job  cherry sundae when older manager came table getting ready leave  She looked stressed all wide eyed stated your burger right am sorry  Uh    hadn't even ordered burger told her  Damn managers better together wouldn't know your own tables restaurant you're managing ? If you're into happy hour checks above 50$ person then over priced chain dump you  sure don't summer you'll visited some cockroaches sure  Yummy ! <EOR> I've eaten several times since opened food always very good  service lacking times though even less busy times   location Red Rock casino keeps coming if someplace else I'd probably another restaurant  <EOR> First last visit any Yard House location  Server all over place  She wasn't even sure she gave correct beers  husbands Club sandwich redone 5 times time right tasteless Steak Sandwich cold  Fries we're served cold tasteless salad served no dressing  Manager payed sandwiches only   still pay side fries beers may right ones? Keep mind 40TH Birthday lunch  Thanks Yard House <EOR> Met some friends catch up  good service kept drinks flowing  Good time  <EOR> I've Yardhouse during happy hour regular hours! personally would rather during happy hour prices course cheaper give generous portions  ordered three four plates during happy hour cost around 20 dollars!
