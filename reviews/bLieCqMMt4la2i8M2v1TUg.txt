If charge airport prices staff crew could care more making sandwiches good   Soda's ice completed melted time sat down 4 handfuls lettuce waaaay much mayo    Not Jersey Mikes standards   Still best sandwich but Vegas airport location disappointing  <EOR> Run different vendor    Don't waste your money here   Money spent Philly Cheesteak  wasted   Sandwich edible  <EOR> For fast food airport thought quick tasty fresh!  Most time food airport prepared earlier day hardly ever fresh  <EOR> Anytime am flying stop their sandwiches   food top quality staff is very friendly   just wish more airports them  <EOR> This place reminded subway days but WAY better!

Airport food never same real thing some reason but worthy 4 stars nonetheless     Finally seating location  <EOR> I neve even heard things before she being much more adventurous decided she try one  few bites say tasty ass sub  assuming pricier most because airport but even if was't ten times better say subway  least Philly Cheese steak was   She said she watched them slice all order nothing assembly line bins  moist bread soft  Anyways am Nor Cal never heard joints before  fan  If close I'd again  <EOR> Jersey Mikes going on! remind subs Miami  I guess East coast subs  the real deal  them toasted tho  Miami most submarine sandwich places pizza ovens stick them closed toast outside bread upon tequest  take home stick toaster oven   they won't toast them store you!  Big bummer <EOR> Food pretty good   little attitude service   Floor behind counter could use some work but sure any different then rest places around here   Food 4 star rest brings 3  <EOR> Airport food usually mediocre overpriced  excellent subs lots real roast beef fresh toppings  place definitely worth checking if you're hungry airport  <EOR> Loved Philly Cheese steak  Definitely more legit ones had  Took little while sub but grilling fresh front patient  Comparable Philly's Best  YUM <EOR> They ran bread we're trying charge full price bowl instead  didn't tell until wasted bunch time line    then most other options closed  Boy pissed off this  Adding more insult already delayed flight    Definitely new last airport option  <EOR> Great sandwich place inside airport!!
