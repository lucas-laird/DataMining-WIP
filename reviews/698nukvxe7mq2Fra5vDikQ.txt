Try Steak chilaquiles Desir server  Very attentive sweet  <EOR> If hearty breakfast Rise Shine your place   I stopped Flamingo location give red velvet pancakes try  The parking entrance set confusing   parking side behind building   There's sign directing ramp but found easier walk through section parking lot   Once inside seated quickly   dining room spacious all kinds great eye candy hanging inside   believe building used house Joe's Crab Shack they've done great job making forget that     The menu huge   Every breakfast food imaginable menu   My server male forgot name wonderful   He busy many other tables but always kept drink filled made sure completely happy meal   The red velvet pancakes monster sized!  I'd guestimate each piece easily size frisbee   three pieces   wasn't crazy cream cheese dressing tasted hint cinnamon it   warm fresh maple syrup delicious its own but little sweet particular pancake which dusted powdered sugar contained chocolate chips   I'd definitely recommend place breakfast lovers large groups anyone mood try something new  <EOR> Omg!!!

Plus waitresses wearing  pjs loooove it!!!! <EOR> The entrance place bit confusing  You'd expect somewhere facing parking lot which ramp handicapped access but main entrance around back facing freeway  walked noticed right away dining area very open spacious high ceilings variety seating arrangements  Saturday morning 9am seated immediately  bad   The hostess seemed training  followed table entire time she kept looking someone else sure she picked right table  would've appreciated more personal greeting some eye contact  server better refilling coffee every few minutes checking see if everything okay    The menu very confusing  expected see STEAK EGGS yet first thing noticed entire column dedicated freshly squeezed juices  What? Apparently full service juice bar corner  Graphically menu itself uses hundred different fonts just things look busy nothing really leads your eye very small selection actual steak eggs   I opted loco moco  always try loco moco places because usually unique spin it  know traditional loco moco tastes trying something new always fun  place does use ribeye patty gravy yaki gravy  IMHO am fan gravy  regular brown gravy teriyaki sauce separately but attempt combining two just totally took away overall simplicity loco moco should be  terms taste almost but quite  think needs another pop flavor tie everything together  ribeye patty other hand cooked medium rare perfection  Props chef regard!  The payment process such mess  awkward enough verbally ask much you'd tip card but way girl handled receipts being sure which receipt hang such just put cherry top overall awkward experience  <EOR> Such great breakfast brunch spot  waitress Ashley excellent  knowledgeable courteous attentive  She also kept ordering more then biggest pancake ever seen  Haha  Ashley made experience special one  <EOR> I took mom family breakfast couple weeks back  You'll spend some money place but service great food good portions satisfying  five star reviews spot on  <EOR> On Saturday morning only waiter entire patio area  took good 10 15 minutes just coffees table 3  service extremely slow food just so so worth wait    Maybe rough day something because manager came thank tables around patience  think would more understanding if comment made course meal instead end when settling bill frustrated  wasn't very good first impression don't think back  <EOR> Food great! Even little parsley cilantro mixup   Service fantastic environment comfortable   definitely back! <EOR> The overall atmosphere pretty quirky cute but  only good thing could say here  server want say Amber Alexa although positive if name really didn't seem care us  service really textbook straight script which would fine if she wasn't actually having interactions other tables sections maybe because 22 year old couple 7 month old baby seem unapproachable? maybe because weren't elderly couple talking juicing  way pretty off putting service aspect  Anyway ordered loco moco medium rare ended crispy outside almost raw inside burger which fine until garbage disposal method eating started slow actually tasted consistency temperature difference outside inside meat felt kind sick it didn't actually sick also kind found irritating hostess tables waiting when tons open tables  All all won't back 2 stars badly cooked burger but other decent food but impersonal service isn't good but don't interested table robot next  <EOR> Best chicken fried steak long time!  Try Chamucos Jalapeo sauce local Henderson NV    it sneaky slow burn  Luckily before crowd   this place gets packed  <EOR> Extremely large portions served wait staff pajamas!
