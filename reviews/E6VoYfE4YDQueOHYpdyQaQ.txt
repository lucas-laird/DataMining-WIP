When asked she pointed plastic bins behind counter full bagels apparently they're made another location delivered = impressed  3 different size options cream cheese containers sealed when ordered scooped another container no idea where other container where came from  waited pay items behind counter straight restaurant impossible show  place expensive bagels not freshly made cream cheese possibly Costco when mentioned prices cashier she said give your money back the other bagel places boil theirs bake ours     ummm but know bagels delivered knows where when ¿ unfortunately didn't time another shop reluctantly took paid for    the bagels sliced     thanks option that    yeah customer service = sucked! <EOR> I think they've some best bang bang for your buck breakfast bagel sandwiches! haven't tried lunchtime Bagels but breakfast ones delicious  typically Ultimate perfect amount food your choice meat potato patty add grilled onions  Superb!

Add another $2! does cream cheese cost more bagel?!? No coffee    this place just doesn't sense  <EOR> Their food tastes great but they're little overpriced portions give you  personally wish closed little bit later but they're breakfast lunch place sense lol  normally 2 bagels bagel burrito coke  drinks quite expensive though! coke vanilla nesquik niece day came $10! Food bad because it'll fill just overpriced size food  employees very nice friendly  5 minute walk house only come if im hungry want something quick don't feel traveling far  <EOR> I update review because feelings changed originally given place 5 stars because love sandwiches te everything bagels but today came prior ordering wash hands restroom drop soap  first thought obviously employees aren't washing hands using restrooms returning back work  Ugh stomach turned  told girl behind counter wasn't any soap te bathroom she shrugged shoulders then told another employee Spanish no soap bathrooms neither them seemed bothered  left never return  Good thing hepatitis vaccine      Like another yelper said hard find good bagels West coast but Brooklyn bagels favorite town  favorite bagel everything bagel pet peeve when bagel places don't put everything both sides bagel here!   My favorite sandwich uptown turkey fresh sliced cucumbers tomatoes alfalfa sprout scallion cream cheese spread if you're watching carbs tastes great wheat bread but if course everything bagel then    Service well greatest  seem same scowl faced girl hates job but friends   My only complaint wish would open southern highlands! need bagel shop!!! <EOR> My wife bagels almost every weekend breakfast nice cheap delicious breakfast sandwiches reasonably priced  Recommend anyone area  run pretty fast come early  <EOR> It close convenient office decided try breakfast morning but never expect much bagel shops outside NY NJ  2 girls working counter didn't seem very friendly but rather interested own conversations which lost them star I'm big fan customer service   ordered plain bagel which decent  Fresh enough still good eat 3 hours later lunch  also ordered power wrap breakfast wasn't huge fan  All all would return simple bagel cream cheese but  it  OH sell large containers coconut water which liked  <EOR> Quick look Unlike any deli's Empire State Empire Bagel's versions stale bland stored looked plastic garbage bags  sandwiches best described mediocre best    In depth review Instead waiting line busy Starbucks next door decided lunch someplace new Empire Bagels looked ideal  NY assumed business advertising Empire State name would bagels tasted used back home sadly wrong  Entire place empty except table 12pm lunchtime Monday  should tipped off    The menu board looked messy someone tried change prices w duct tape paper  few sandwiches ingredients also changed covered up  sign above drink cooler telling smile camera honest pay beverages nice welcoming touch  loud inside shop two large industrial fans blasting overhead  also nickel dime charge additional 50 cents use credit debit card  sandwiches already cost $8 $10 average exactly reasonable when add extra fee    The sandwiches made fresh took 10 minutes before ready  if pressed time nay want call ahead  Asiago Cheese Bagel California Club stale crunchy saltine cracker  avocado slice sandwich turning brown starting oxidize see photo thought made fresh? Why serve customer brown avocado? turkey wet dripped water bottom when attempted eat it  wife also complained plain bagel also stale tasteless  She also wet meat sandwich dripped all over when trying eat  sandwiches edible best did give good sized portions    Summary bit disappointed first visit here  Expected much more place called Empire Bagel's  Most likely stop back if side town again    We still hunt perfect bagel Las Vegas valley reminds chewy tasty bagels grew back home    <EOR> I see other people great experiences wish could say same  such potential being close home considering much love bagels  However roommate staff cold best  weren't friendly inviting  store itself dingy open consistently  even took hours off door don't know when they're open when close  bagel stale mountains cream cheese  scrape some off  Also there's fee if use your card under certain amount which believe violates agreement most companies Visa MasterCard  prices entirely expensive you're getting too  personal experience never want back  Other people seem good ones though  Maybe try yourself judge  sure write review though  curious other people think  <EOR> I am honest BLT bagel lover  place isn't any different another but bagels right  Prsonally having BLT everything morning when grabbing chai Starbicks next door  bagels schmear good too  think nice stop Sammie some bagels toasted  amazing but nearby staff friendly  <EOR> Awesome delicious!

Of course have! But if you're you've probably woke closer lunch few times same desire   Empire's taken care of  They'll turn your hopes bagel breakfast into sandwich more appropriate lunch hour   Sure they're first offer bagel sandwiches breakfast lunch but seem them fresher tastier some others especially chains    also regular sandwiches look pretty darn good but haven't tried those yet    Me cousin came other day tried place first time   kind small place only two employees working no else eating but around 1 30 most bagel loving crowd probably flown south now figured     The ambience wasn't bad but almost creepy quiet was  Empire if you're listening some house music going hire some mariachis something  don't hang total silence   looked started decorate point then just kinda gave up   But other there's nothing pick on   The food actually much better expected   Tijuana Hot bagel sandwich because party all things spicy  did trick  Tasty little jalapeño bagel cream cheese jalapeños fried egg bacon melted cheese   If think sounds delicious because also know live   My cousin traditional nova lox bagel sandwich which also really tasty  lot more fish then expected plus sure   Prices $7 $9 chips drink   little pricey but least fresh delicious can't complain much   Great little spot breakfast lunch! <EOR> How place any 4 5 star reviews beyond me!!!
