Keep mind restaurant even full house lot people restaurant when eating but food took FOREVER come out  8 people table but still any other restaurant bring foods faster especially when food easily made  latte only came super late while everyone else coffee  Usually drink latte before eat way just chill talk girlfriends drink latte  Instead friend flag down waitress tell waited 25 minutes latte she gave bullshit excuse saying must line cause there's only machine  Right     No body girl  Also waiters most orders mixed way wanted food cooked  example friends wanted scrambled eggs instead over easy  Just stupid mistakes  Didn't service food ok  still wouldn't come back  <EOR> Don't order chicken  disgusting  love Steve Wynn support everything he does  However tell he doesn't eat terrace cafe inside casino  Steve order chicken waffles when bite into you'll know immediately talking about  Definitely won't pass your texture taste test  Hardest piece chicken breast ever had  Didn't taste good either  really disappointed  orange juice supposed fresh squeezed Natural  didn't happen either  straight can  know sour Taste anywhere  Worst breakfast ever Las Vegas  sorry but am being honest here  <EOR> I thoroughly enjoyed lunch Terrace Pointe Cafe during recent stay Wynn   I'd dined before years ago remember food being good happy confirm once again is   seated promptly nice comfortable booths   Though given water right away did take awhile waitress come take orders   She did see frazzled pretty slow service overall but food good overlook slow service bit   For lunch lemonade chicken club wrap fries   know sounds ordinary but honestly good   lemonade perfect wrap gouda cheese awesome   don't know but love it   Hubs BLT also enjoyed quite bit   It's pretty simple if Wynn want nice relatively inexpensive lunch would definitely consider Terrance Pointe Cafe   I'd try sit outside next time though really lovely  <EOR> My family likes brunch when we're all together Vegas   casual dining Wynn style   place great sunny relaxing feel it   roomy tables spread far apart   service always wonderful   love salads here   menu changes whenever everything ever tried loved   best lobster salads ever life here   really enjoy place continue visit highly recommend  <EOR> Super disappointed  high hopes place  waited 15 mins table worth it  pancakes super thick good all  huevos rancheros very good very bland   Service good server came once he didnt even deliver food  just wasnt good only decent thing waffle  wouldn't come back recommend  happy all  Overpriced! <EOR> Vegan chicken waffles need say more?! If you're vegan willing spend pretty penny taste some delicious breakfast should stop here  cute cafe situated pool Wynn great treat while vacationing  <EOR> Worst reuben sandwich ever $13 boot  Slow service  $7 Fat tires  <EOR> This hands down best place breakfast if doing buffet Wynn   If weather nice sit poolside pampered wonderful wait staff bring newspaper read bottled water to go cup lid cup coffee take when finished    this making sure your coffee carafe always filled! fresh squeeze house orange juice best ever tasted  dined inside last time because winds blowing crazy outside   Autumn awesome server terrific sense humor friendly efficient manner   continental breakfast came basket several delicious pastries croissant Danish chocolate muffin all made scratch   coffee terrific too   yourself favor stop if staying Wynn Encore just area  <EOR> Always solid spot whatever feel eating! late breakfast early lunch  Some wanted breakfast although restaurant already turned over serving lunch  servers Heather Jose spot restaurant always amazing service friendly staff!! ordered huevos rancheros side sauces spicy well crafted! presentation all dishes beautiful flavors divine!! hubby beautiful burger which if want fries another $5  given burger $18 $19 seemed little chincy fries but hey     quinoa veggie bowl which hot dish vegan menu amazing!

But said food really good always well prepared! back all time!!! <EOR> I wouldn't surprised if lot patrons more quitters Buffet line next door didn't patience wait 2+ hours in   25 30 minute wait outside cafe actually great alternative comparison   Overall more 3 5 stars   line seated slow could've handled better   plenty empty tables almost felt intentionally made wait outside create illusion cafe really happening place passersby   kind stuff some not so happening SF nightclubs   The food itself quite good   More 4 x star quality   Ambiance quite pleasant too   mushroom truffle burger tri tip sandwich chicken tenders crab lobster club   All high quality satisfying   tell restaurant cares food quality quality sides   Even coleslaw done well enough usually doesn't care coleslaw actually enjoyed it   I'd recommend over Buffet next door  <EOR> Beautiful poolside atmosphere huge selection food but all need Vegas lunch beautiful Wynn  Fits genetic based lifestyle <EOR> Ate last weekend large group food barely mediocre  Service good though slow atmosphere nice    But food husband lobster eggs Benedict which very bland definitely worth he didn't finish it   ordered pancakes french toast table share both so so  price expected much better    The real clincher reason probably won't ever back ordered simple breakfast eggs over medium bacon hash browns toast coffee my personal favorite   bacon was   odd tasting thin crispy  eggs over cooked yoke completely solid  hash browns baked fried good either  Unfortunately very disappointing breakfast  <EOR> For being Vegas coffee shop locals call such place hard beat   When arrived greeted friendly hostess seated quickly   surprised offered separate vegetarian menu   Vegas typically don't offer much veggies    But place did  surprisingly   good views pool offer near poolside eating seating   server friendly woman suggested veggie burger   took bait    glad did   massive sandwich   patty moist flavorful   spicy hummus offered nice kick heat   artfully presented delicious   can't believe hyping veggie burger Vegas     But strange times    <EOR> It's absolutely worth wait outdoor dining restaurant  wait dine for inside outside seating but relatively quickly  hostesses very polite hospitable    We came breakfast although told restaurant serves breakfast upon request all day    Our server extremely nice everything needed throughout dining experience  lovely view pool enjoyed breezy sunny breakfast outside terrace    We each glass fresh squeezed orange juice  small juice glass $7 each which find absurd but when Vegas     I huevos rancheros  sauces served dish both extremely flavorful really enjoyed them   especially avocado cream sauce  much needed because actual dish needed bit more seasoning even if only salt pepper  am person rarely even cooks salt pepper NEVER add restaurant add salt saying lot! Mom Belgian waffle served berries she thoroughly enjoyed dish well    They extensive vegetarian menu which nice see because most places few choices vegetarians  Upon ordering also ask if any food allergies    I highly recommend restaurant breakfast  lunch menu looks delicious well but didn't chance return lunch during stay  several visits past never disappoints  miss banana foster french toast  no longer menu MUCH better version currently being served Tableau    Try out   you won't disappointed! <EOR> A little disappointed back weekend dined again lunch    Would give last visit 3 5 stars   Ani tuna tartare appetizer completely flavorless served some rice cake crackers appetizing least  PASS sure   Had mahi mahi grilled fish sandwich entree which good great    Service bit slow    You cannot location restaurant though sat outside patio overlooking pool enjoyed beautiful weather   Overall decent but should better considering prices  <EOR> This Wynn expect everything high standard Terrace Pointe Cafe doesn't disappoint   starters strongly recommend $20 glass bottomless mimosas refilled frequently   isn't huge menu but all need great lunch brunch variety half sandwiches soups salads   tuna sandwich just right size generous bowl fresh fruit   appetizer shared chips guacamole salsa along tuna poke all more satisfying   thing love all Wynn properties vegan options brunch mates enjoyed did well vegan banana split     I would recommend waiting outdoor seating nice day service great expected without anyone trying rush off enjoy your food weather view  <EOR> Fancy shmancy cafe good food great ambiance but way pricey  expect Wynn guess right? decided check Terrace Pointe since none hungry enough buffet it's literally right across it   wasn't busy but opted outside table short wait  Btw if weather good highly recommend sitting outside  overlooks pool just really nice relaxing   Service point food good but prices steep  BBQ burger already costs $17 doesn't even come anything! pay extra $4 add side fries  prices alcohol aren't cheap either  $12 michelada $21 bottomless mimosa  Last checked just cafe! guess you're paying presentation atmosphere but dangg  paid might well just gone buffet!  Bottom line lovely outside seating relaxing environment  perfect night food isn't bad  But when you're paying over $70 just two burgers side fries essentially 2 beers probably pass next time  <EOR> Great place breakfast  highly recommend steak hash browns  outstanding! orange juice great well  service always great food comes hot fast    I eat least once every time Vegas  <EOR> Lobster eggs Benedict enough said  <EOR> Located just past Wynn Buffet Terrace Pointe Cafe offers modern take classic American dishes  entrees $10 25 range welcome alternative higher priced dining options but still manages keep some upscale charm you'd expect Wynn brand   You'll given choice indoor outdoor seating upon arrival  outdoor seating overlooks beautifully laid Wynn pools  There's lengthier wait time outdoor seating but you'll enjoy laid back vibe pool scene  You'll take advantage shade patio umbrellas  toast yourself under bright Vegas sun  while sipping mid day pitcher sangria   The usually immediate indoor seating isn't total wash you'll still able most likely enjoy pool scene through floor ceiling windows if you're able successfully fight off rest your party grab pool facing seats   As you'd expect service top notch  When nearby diner asked server if knew if going UFC fight particular weekend she quickly excused herself informed hostess inquiry  hostess walked over table two minutes later able confirm details match weekend which she gathered quick call concierge desk    Good food great view service willing extra mile guests  always five star experience book  <EOR> As usual food Terrace Point phenomenal  time coffee vegetarian lettuce wraps table chicken waffle   The chicken waffle extremely unique tasted fantastic  waffle bacon chives savory chipotle syrup interesting sweetness smokey kick  topped fried egg which added great richness    The lettuce wraps fairly standard tasted similarly ones PF Changs    My friend steak eggs steak perfectly cooked very tender    The service only which isn't normal somewhere Wynn  took really long time food just long check when done    I'll still back again again waffle!   But seriously WAY over air conditioned  Dress warm  <EOR> Always enjoyed breakfasts here   thing witnessed last visit last week led put hopes seen someone address it  While finishing breakfast staff started remove coffee cups tables   problem removed them picking cups thumbs inside cups  Hopefully someone address this  <EOR> It overall ok   service par prices reasonable considering Vegas   food let's see    Red Velvet Pancakes Lobster Eggs Benedict Country Potatos   Food ok   trying see if combination various corn asparagus flavors mixed bacon waffle hollondaise sauce came together but even when full couldn't put finger why just didn't taste well altogether   Ho hum   other Yelpers loved definately recommend since does include lobster     No drinks ordered boyfriend take 3 4 pancake b c large rotund    Beautiful relaxing fiew pool outdoor seating   nice romantic place breakfast  <EOR> I lunch bf just before leaving las vegas  good bye las vegas  good casual lunch  <EOR> We came quick afternoon tea  First decided sit outside enjoy sunshine however burning forced come back in   we signiture cafe fruit plate both liked lot  Waitress very attentive well  <EOR> Great food excellent service!

Probably better options hotel strip  food mediocre  <EOR> extremely overpriced breakfast food  I watch everyone pool while eating  Service just ok  Hummus trio appetizer good but enough veggies  Tuna fish average  Caesar Salad boring overdressed  Typical Vegas food    <EOR> OMG couldn't believe girls wait line 30 minutes table  didn't even wait long into clubs vegas night before  well wait wasn't all bad  took turns waiting line making quick purchases mojito's resort wear  waiting line hostesses brought water bottles everyone waiting line very thoughtful considerate     enough wait now food     their chinese chicken salad  thinly sliced napa cabbage red bell peppers scallions julienned carrot grilled chicken breast tossed sweet tangy sesame oil vinegar dressing  Very impressive their burger  am eating  Don't bother kind good burger  med rare sharp cheddar my choice cheese lettuce red onions tomatos  perfection served crispy brown fries  mayo mustard served side   their chicken parmigiana  evenly thinly breaded processed mozzarella cheese topped thick dry chicken breast topped so sorry blend tomato sauce served over overcooked pasta  am sorry but ordered this??!! kind dish  Banana split  I know sounds plain but OMG  don't even know start  totally amazing  Caramelized bananas served scoop real creamy strawberry gelato scoop dark chunky brownie chocolate ice cream scoop light French vanilla mix between ice cream gelato  huge share others although probably won't want share once bite it   <EOR> Stay indoors!  While may seem nice idea actually breakfast outdoor terrace nice weather overlooking Wynn pool would strongly recommend against account serious problem outdoor portion restaurant birds specifically fairly aggressive  and hungry  great tailed grackles   grackles perch themselves top umbrellas then come down any opportunity pick leftovers stacks cleared plates   pretty unappetizing watch five birds fly down table next pick whatever get   requested moved inside turned mist machines which seemed help temporarily but sure enough birds returned undeterred   if must dine outside no means leave your table temporarily unattended   waitstaff watch over your food if else may return find your food having picked rats wings   That all said once moved indoors breakfast okay   Croissant decent very fluffy though particularly fresh   same croissants serve breakfast packages throughout hotel   Eggs Benedict Trio decent standard Eggs Benedict together lobster version served quarter Belgian waffle pork pepper jack biscuit Jalapeno hollandaise   pork probably best trio  <EOR> It tough find casual sit down breakfast option Wynn Encore where staying   ended Terrace Pointe Cafe  party hostess suggested might most comfortable sitting bar presumably because wait two tops  hurry said ok    I wanted Benedict but only two menu lobster version pulled pork passed  ended ordering bagel cream cheese Greek yogurt berries granola    First some confusion among bartenders bagel which wouldn't known if hadn't each asked if other getting bagel  Then when came burned  would crappy even if weren't blackened bagel seriously best available Las Vegas?  right because if better bagel would think Mr  Wynn would found right?  saving grace cream cheese which definitely tub    The yogurt berries granola better but way big probably justify $14 price  Seriously y'all?  yogurt couple dozen berries?  blueberries blackberries strawberries over some bland yogurt asked vanilla but think plain   star dish some seriously amazing granola which told roast fresh every day    High prices but some nice elements pretty setting   I'd back  <EOR> Enjoyed beautiful weather sitting terrace Wynn but service horrendous  right back translated into back 15 minutes    Same your order right meaning even put your order into kitchen yet  took 35 minutes food ordered food impressive   omelette subpar hashbrowns inedible french toast tasted almost burnt   However black angus burger delicious tasting husband's burger knew made mistake ordering   Don't if hurry sit outside if weather nice least atmosphere crappy service mediocre food  <EOR> The food decently priced view over looking pool outside both beautiful day night time must say coming Wynn beautiful  open 24 7 which great not so 24 7 Las Vegas except getting alcohol casino course place comfortable wait almost non existence we came around 10 30PM?

Cos food based quantity  Hotels offer buffet loads profits even if think cleaned tray whatever Alaskan Antarctican crab legs  Fact bought ton dirt cheap them prepare      As moved pathetic line crowd buffet restaurant Wynn laughed 2 minutes later stumbled upon Terrace Pointe Café  quite empty atmosphere spot on  Plus no stupid family kids running around ice cream cones    We booth lined red vinyl  café setting sets itself apart before  surpasses rather old tasteless bling bling Bellagio cafe darker more sinister tone  But like! café where couples done sinful things taking break quick bite  café where imagine Trent Reznor Marilyn Manson would dine   café where if kids running screaming servers might cage them cook them into  sinister yet delicious soups    What seems overpriced $16 smoked burger $16 clam pasta turned very good  Service tad bit slow but both dishes made care  prices par Houstons   We ate champions under $35  <EOR> I breakfast lunch lot while Vegas  First steak eggs then waffles then tuna dip  good  seat outside inside  Outside see pool but ton birds flying around fly your table try some food  service great lot variety  You walk right pool done breakfast  <EOR> For type place know whatever order gonna good  First off chicken waffles crazy  Chicken excellent perfect amount crispiness  Waffle delicious slight crisp accompanied soft fluffiness  spicy syrup came different well  Some reviewers complaining price but las vegas hotel really did think bad   something $20 bucks   I also tried biscuits gravy bacon eggs benedict  Nothing mind blowing those but all really good  I'd also recommend 21$ all u drink mimosas some which stole dad   Service great  View beautiful faced Wynn pool  No complaints all  <EOR> Nice presentation great service but food nothing special  did really enjoy prime rib wrap but fries came fresh  restaurant 24 hours much better choice over glorified diners Vegas plus menu much more offer  If hungry 2am morning looking spend little extra something along strip I'd most likely come here   JONASAPPROVED! <EOR> This place sure every time Vegas    The decor STUNNING    whimsical oversized  feel you're Alice Wonderland just drank shrinky potion lol  But everything Wynn just absolutely beautiful   Get Salmon  do  Every time  call Wynn Salmon  Lol  Its generous portion bed Jasmine rice perfectly cooked green beans tied fancy knot  kicker pineapple salsa top  Sounds weird but its  AMAZING   It's nice quiet retreat crazy hustle bustle Vegas  never wait seated all  <EOR> I never expect much hotel restaurants but hoping new vegan dictate Steve Winn vegan menus all restaurants would good choice    The food good  vegan menu few choices each meal  Soba Seaweed Salad  good but little sweet  Arame salad good but flavor covered sweet sauce  Perfect amount ginger though  cucumber instead being shredded just mush but Enoki mushrooms made me   Why 3 stars though? service  slow bad but aggressive  busy but seated within 10 seconds expected order drink before even picked drink menu  asked he come back he never did  put order waiter he passed drink guy  waiter came 2 times way quickly take order second time very pushy ordering    Serving finding balance between being prompt being slow  place does down  other reviews sound slow experience pushy  should just between extremes  <EOR> We very bad experience Terrace Pointe Café during breakfast  Grackle birds constantly dive bombing customers food! staff seemed just used working around them ignoring them  Two girls sitting near asked moved inside flew down sat back chair began chirping loudly  Another guy took several pics phone four birds picking dishes vacated table next him  husband salting newly arrived omelet when grackle swooped took bite off plate! DISGUSTING  staff didn't seem notice  first husband decided just let he cut away half omelet bird attacked put coffee saucer then continued meal  bird later returned food knocked saucer off table shattering it  then complain    We received half hearted apology manager husband's plate taken off bill  manager seemed indifferent situation saying grackles protected species Nevada hotel working environmental solution whatever means  would suggest Wynn hire full time bird minder meantime    I understand health code violation  Other reviews list ongoing issue dating far back 2010  disgusting completely unacceptable see dozens birds hopping around serving trays digging under napkins into abandoned bread baskets generally just being nuisances all tryjng enjoy $21 breakfast plates soon possible  <EOR> Review dining experience My party 4 seated promptly upon arrival  ordered drinks  starters friend long piece hair water!

Ok back review Terrace Point Cafe   I gave 3 star but really bad 3 75 star worthy    just reasons couldn't give 4 5   here's why The decor inside cafe opulence opium    like dreamy tea party bright colors beautiful shapes   booths sitting clouds view outdoor soothing   The waitress Nancy super nice   quote super because she extremely overly glare in your face friendly which bit ass explain later    Ordered French Onion Soup cheesy yummy can't wrong cheese bread onions    Chicken Quesadillas sour cream salsa guacamole   it tasty fulfilling you 5 large slices    asked hot sauce brought Tabasco when really wanted Tapatio but course Wynn wouldn't carry such brand *BoOooo*  They KILLER FRENCH FRIES here!  Crispy thin seasoned fries crunchy good!  Interesting FRIES impressed everything   Stay Away Prime Rib Cheesesteak Sandwich mushrooms onions   NASTY DRY BLAND disappointment!  meat tasted washed away all seasoning water   sad   sad sad girl   mess such easy dish!

Didn't enjoy your meal? told sandwich dry bland asked if usually serve au ju sauce   Do know she said?!?! Oh yea   out all dishes worst dish get   before dry good   wouldn't recommend it  First reaction hell!?  Why didn't she tell when ordered it!?!?  think being nice cool but honest your customer!

Even staff recognized BAD SANDWICH!  expected more Wynn   chef should alerted immediately he she should pull off menu season bitch!  *sigh*  I'm sorry but hate when good restaurants serve bad food     If want burger appetizers leisurely meal but total bill comes almost same price Wynn Buffet if want experience good meal Wynn hit buffet instead!

 chicken waffles absolutely die for   Ask vegan butter well   Didn't French toast nearly much but chicken waffles good may skewed opinion   Looking forward trying some other vegan dishes here   careful birds when sitting outside   UPDATE back sat patio   restaurant packed able seat fairly quickly   Well good part   Waited 10 minutes someone come by   did flagged down hostess   3 min that   ready order he indicated he could only take drink order   said  OK ordered beer   came 4 min   Waited another 8 min flagged down hostess again   guy took drink order showed 2 min later!!!!!!
