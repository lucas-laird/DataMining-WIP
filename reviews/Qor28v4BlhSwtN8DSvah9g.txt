Telling all friends family attend any your restaurant  Roberts better!! <EOR> The lady took order needs customer service skills  food very expensive considering way treated  never back  <EOR> I mean price quality food think really place down dirty delicious does cost much all  <EOR> Ah OK   worst but greatest either   Off suggestion wifey office less 10 minute drive away Pepe's Tacos ended going because officemates eat quite frequently   knew little unassuming eatery 'Best Las Vegas' vote!  bit suspect outside things   But once inside different story   Place surprisingly tidy!  Far shizzhole half expecting walk into   Pepe   Get inside you're hit flash neon shine aluminum siding   Menus smack dab middle restaurant wow does Pepe crew love yellow red!  Menus all done color scheme   Does kinda hungry!    Looked over menu noticed very similar other Mexican eats around town   More authentic side things less Taco Bell Del Taco Chipotle sort   Which don't mind all   If see bunch Latinos eating then place must SOME sort street cred   All good hood say all good   I really 'Super' burritos carne asada   Wifey jonesin' fish she fried tilapia plate   Kid mood fries she order carne asada fries guacamole side kid hates guac ever since incident El Pollo Loco but  another story    kinda rude tell patrons can't share drink cup if folks seen sharing extra charge??

Call Care Bear police!  But really drink want to   shared didn't charged extra   But did dirty look two   Gotta say though mix equal parts pineapple drink hibiscus drink   refreshing!  horchata isn't bad either   Food arrives around 10 minutes which OK book know fast food   Helped myself salsa bar loaded pickled jalapenos carrots sliced radishes limes cilantro well   color when eat!  My carne asada 'Super' burrito alright   included steak beans cheese lettuce tomatoes sour cream   pretty good but found somewhat lacking heft used to   Could used more carne asada   should opted combination burrito instead which comes meat beans rice onions cilantro salsa   Would saved $1 over 'Super' burrito     Wifey said fried tilapia plate tasty   Came nice sized full fried tilapia rice beans lettuce tomato sour cream side flour corn tortilla   Fish fried just right oily overcooked very juicy   Beans rice nothing ordinary but fresh made tortillas delicious   Kid happy HEAPING mound carne asada over some fat French fries   Fries cooked well soggy covered copious amounts nacho cheese oh yeah definitely can steak sour cream guacamole on side course    She liked them lot but full half order   Leftovers!  Nothing congealed blobs meat cheese over cold potatoes later   #drunkeats  I wasn't overly impressed Pepe's Tacos but did enjoy taste food   cooked fresh right   wouldn't way come burrito but if neighborhood oh man would rare would stop bite eat   maybe drink   share   Arriba! <EOR> Pepe's ULTIMATE FAVORITE mexican restaurant ever!!!  live all way Henderson always down drive distance place   usually carne asada soft tacos never disappointed   great thing place they're open 24 hours day food pretty cheap   Lots Mexican friends said Pepe's food just good homecooked meal   bit drive strip but worth visit  <EOR> Best chile rellano Vegas any price   three taco plate carne asada handmade corn tortilla cilantro onion  roasted chile salsa all solidly delicious   Skip nachos fries unless liquid cheese   Other frescas salsa bar well stocked bathrooms clean despite some tagging all around great grub choice Decatur! <EOR> We excited try Pepes carne asada fries advertise best Vegas!

Viva Pepes Tacos! <EOR>   Review www JerseyGirlinVegas com   Yesterday find local post office pick package during lunch break  doing discovered great little Mexican joint called Pepe's Decanter    They great big signs caught eye  figured hungry tacos sound good let's try out! When opened door read voted best Las Vegas 2015 getting pretty optimistic find  ordered 2 hard shell pulled beef taco soda lunch special $5 10  also picked some chips salsa since salsa bar looked yummy see below   order since short time    When arrived back work broke into tacos almost immediately  shell cracked but flavor exceptional least concerns  trickled some smokey spicy homemade salsa chips tacos  made taste buds happy dance! good! If anyone looking some quick authentic Mexican cuisine stop Pepe's  4 locations around town   And OPEN 24 HOURS! <EOR> Normally love place recomend everyone but recent visit beyond disappointing   sure if owner chosen less quallity meat but sure would fed two burritos five tacos stray dog die starvation   worst meals long time   native took some other locals first time embarrassed taken them sort ate crap bundled tortilla    I carnitas friends carne asada   Both loaded unedible cartiledge carnitas bone fragments it   rice nearly raw throughout both burritos which mixed some other over cooked rice   probably means mixing old product new product   NO BUENO!  Maybe Clark County Health Department needs inspection facilities ensure proper use cooked food   Its obvious lack training behalf owner management if even around oversee all     Dear Pepe's YOUR SHIT TOGETHER! <EOR> So today 7 16 15 boss brought all lunch here    The first thing impressed hot everyone's food was   Usually when takeout home all cold soggy but everything still piping hot    I double cheeseburger fries medium drink $5 99     I gotta tell ya   their fries bomb   thick cut kind fry them real crispy then toss them salt seasoning   Absolutely wonderful     The burger actually pretty good too   two patties lettuce special sauce like thousand island cheese tomato   hot gooey really great   know you're thinking   why heck did burger mexican place?? Well am la guera    Minus star cuz' both co workers ordered chicken burritos them given chicken other carne asada   She couldn't eat would hungry if weren't other co worker very kindly switched her  <EOR> WORST Carne Asada fries world!  Only promoter someone doesn't know better would rate above movie theater food type quality     close examination all ingredients    Meat poor quality skimpy  Smothered Super cheap nacho cheese Guacamole mostly filler Sour Cream ok Fries ok And thats it    nothing else it!  Charging $10 50 claim best  <EOR> This place very good local Mexican place good spicy food! tacos great always give lot food too  also french fries beef cheddar cheese man those enough fill up! also reasonably priced also  recommend them anyone wanting try authentic Mexican local food! <EOR> By far best mexican food ever eaten before! Authentic Mexican food its finest  only little downside prices sometimes misleading but all honest completely worth it  <EOR> I mean seriously?!?!? This food perfect! price quantity well      Locations could better but it     demographic thing   Carne asada tacos super   Go there The end  <EOR> OK really fun review am excited add Yelp collection!  At approximately 2am morning Yelp buddy Jon calls invites bite out  Yes even though already bed relaxing watching tv accepted invite am very spontaneous always ready stuff mouth!
