We only tried fries definitely lot  would say worth $10 price  best ones ever but still really good  top them cheese sour cream looked avocado sauce well guacamole  think would really great though  if selection salas top them seemed odd taco shop wouldn't honestly fries missing it    If back would probably try some tacos also just order fries spicy pork enjoyed lot more carne asada  <EOR> Still really good flavor but good Cali   meat seems different but guacamole marinade salsa it   But long night Vegas sure hits spot  <EOR> Legit taco place strip!

Just sure right line order   gonna lie google few items menu since unfamiliar me   Reasonably priced quick fresh no frills definitely winner  <EOR> I live Southern California know thing two tacos  Tacos El Gordo may best tacos ever had  wish location here  The best taco probably adobado tacos   It's huge piece meat rotating spit where shave pieces off put tacos  really only reason need come  think all food good but when perfection why chance it   Please please please tacos El Gordo open Southern California location! <EOR> Get PASTOR     OK now way having lived literally dozens feet away 3 years single most thing miss name old hood  food top notch hole wall  homeboy always usually behind counter service always friendly became quick dinner spot virtually all friends coming pregame dinner which often led round 2 trip post game drunken snack   While almost always pastor both chicken steak good quality partial Costillas en Res con Papas sp? You'll see picture menu love grilled jalapeño   Short story long just because more few drunken and sober memories but far favorite pastor city always keep coming back! <EOR> I never give place enough good reviews   just doesn't any better! <EOR> Prepare yourself uncomfortable time!  The food really good but restaurant itself leaves lot desired   First off chaotic system ordering food side then paying other side room   common setup seems bit pushy order your food   People seem ignore people cut front you   seems people bad manners restaurant employees only respond positively other spanish speakers   could also friend isn't pushy rude type but people taking orders wouldn't acknowledge him     I think tragic even though food pretty good but organization really sucks!  If want type meat stand line if want another then stand different line   4 different lines!  wish would just handle orders back   if think employees dumb handle orders different types meat   He might mix carne asada adobada!  look totally different but cares employees stupid tell difference!   really don't it   might expect sort chaos food truck outdoor swap meet but restaurant there's much better way running things   way things setup things faster easier   fact could see someone easily ordering food just walking without paying because would impossible tell paid hasn't especially when busy which seems  during lunch dinner hours   I also found prices bit high light terrible service runs   I'd understand paying more food restaurant organized nice but all chaos terrible service don't know why d pay any more any taco truck   Overall I'd say stay away unless find place mostly empty then wouldn't take forever order your food   Also your choices pretty much taco tostada sopa carne fries  <EOR> Oh god!!! some best tacos ever had! flavor asada tacos perfect  Great seasoning cooked perfectly good!!! adobada tacos very flavorful satisfying  Ingredients very fresh service great! some time though because extremely busy  2 lines depending want order  prices very good expensive all  told friends want back tomorrow but might back tonight!!!

Each kind taco its own line if want different meats yourself you're screwed even if 1 other person want several different meats you're still screwed   Also put guacamole tacos which drowns taste tacos  Mexico many times don't there  California also large Mexican population don't most places  Some places put chunks avocados but guacamole   Maybe 4 5 star tacos Nevada but jus average me  SF Bay area tacos much better highly populated Mexican immigrants good tacos  <EOR> Early morning late night always good time Tacos El Gordo! eat lot tacos probably many tacos place gold standard taco measuring  Great authentic tacos plus free guac take note Chipotle delicious quesadillas  People literally sit outside place waiting open morning good  But don't fooled may open door but still wait another 40 min taco goodness because still finish cooking all all really when first open doors drink  tease  Plan accordingly  <EOR> This best Mexican food places town  it clean service great  would highly recommend tacos el gordo  i rated 3 different places disappointed yet   my husband loves asada tacos love asada fries  check food awesome <EOR> The absolute best tacos Las Vegas! pork some pineapple  Mulas favorite  open faced quesadilla piles high meat salsa  ahead throw some money tip jar enjoy VIP treatment  place does right every level! <EOR> WHAT ORDERED 2 tacos tripa 1 carne asada mula 1 al pastor mula carne asada fries  SERVICE speak spanish service good but see might issue none spanish speakers  CLEANLINESS truly think due being busy don't chance clean fast would like  table dirty but waiting someone leave someone came clean table shortly after   TASTE BOMB!! tacos weakness place didn't disappoint   WORTH PRICE? yes! keep mind strip considering much food Vegas great price   RECOMMENDATIONS Mulas all way cheese guacamole salsa your meat choice  everything need bite  all meats favorite al pastor   WILL COME BACK?

Even grilled jalapeño pepper offered wasn't spicy    I favored adobada over carne asada seemed more tender  Also taco de cabeza head really oily took bite couldn't eat rest   The vampiro sopes masa cake bottom crispy fried tortilla tostada like top  filled carne asada or any meat choose dense piece rubber like cheese topped lots guacamole sauce cilantro onions  tasty hard eat extremely filling!   Their avocado sauce put everything tasted good but very thick filling  made 100% avocados may added some type filler it    Make sure ask complimentary plate grilled green onion peppers don't offer unless ask it   6 small tacos 2 vampiros soda totals $23 02 <EOR> Totally worth wait!

Try Tacos El Gordo next time near! <EOR> Not sure if better Chula Vista BUT Adobada fries  winner meeeee! <EOR> While think food Tacos El Gordo's okay dining experience whole rather forgetful   First reason having multiple lines different kinds meat? zero sense me  lines slow forget getting multiple meats if come alone  Luckily able try several meats because different lines  waited over hour two popular lines but other lines much less people  Why don't things more efficient let people order any meat any stations?  The adobada which meat they're known wasn't all interesting me  don't understand why everyone crazy red pork  Don't forget ask slices pineapple off top spit  also ask grilled veggies peppers your tacos  adobada asada cabeza lengua liked lengua most  probably best lengua tacos actually  Unfortunately didn't think much sauces   Even though tacos weren't bad anything whole waiting line forever having different lines different types meat marred overall experience here  very difficult finding table eat well  Hopefully some issues particular location  hopeful better experience other locations  <EOR> I really didn't think would much difference between two locations but Charleston location trumps LV BLVD location bad   Down payment station shop just doesn't El Gordo name justice   I area more but food just same opinion   I ordered usually Carne Asada fries Adobada tacos   Maybe came bad day but steak wasn't cooked still being bit pink   Having carne asada fries means steak grilled opinion   I don't mind little pink steak but disappointing    Also sauces salsas aren't made easily attainable don't forget ask  <EOR> holly shit found them yelp its same mother fuckers TJ!

Downside wish would fix wait!  They security guard stand door control amount customers inside because line long   basically different lines different type meats going order  al pastor line seemed quickest because guard kept letting people wanted meat inside first  Whereas carne asada chorizo line longest barely moved  But front line realized customers said getting al pastor meat let first actually jumping lines once inside therefore making other line longer   Another downside because different lines different meats tacos quicker line cold while even if split your buddies wait different lines wait other tacos   Would back tacos   yeah    do want them fix line system   heck yeah! *tip ask foil cover tacos you've ordered  they look messier when eat them but maintain some heat while wait tacos slower longer line  <EOR> I ate Tacos Al Pastor Lengua really good   bit line Tuesday night but very tolerable  <EOR> The best Tacos Las Vegas!!! specially Alpastor best!!  is really worth big lines   <EOR> My lengua fully cooked honestly gross  ordering very weird annoying  complain lot but food worth hassle ordering paying seperate part  Especially cold food  <EOR> Hands down best Mexican anything ever put mouth!

Tacos El Gordo best taco places Vegas  gave reason pay $2 taco hopefully amazes too  <EOR> This place definitely type restaurant survives because food quality  pretty dilapidated building old unkempt dirty  lines long waiting Vegas sun no good  place crowded really hard find seating tables themselves building old dirty unkempt   Moving onto food  was   heavenly  only sell tacos but them VERY well  ordered carne asada adobado taco perfection  consuming ambrosia greek gods themselves felt eating dingy food cart heart Mexico that's good thing   What's funny don't any unique sauce special way making tacos  fact them spot really quickly  chef just slices meat off large rotating skewer onto tortilla   However warned friends recommend purchasing many tacos quite small  safe I'd order least 4  Otherwise you'll waiting long line again under sweltering heat Vegas sun  <EOR> This place bombbbbbbb!
