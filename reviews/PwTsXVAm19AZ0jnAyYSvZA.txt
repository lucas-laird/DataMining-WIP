No ordered shrimp $13 00 frozen sea pak style shrimp crinkle cut frozen fries wilted tasteless cup coleslaw  girl Lobsta dinner which little better but much  Veggies drowned butter soggy  Service just terrible  won't back sure! <EOR> First timer here   and GLAD options NON Lobstah fan! know know   you're probably thinking why would even restaurant name lobster if am lobster fan!? BUT defense business meeting didn't choose location   However really great BURGER! staff friendly Carol particular funny gave great service!

Noticed mixed reviews but gf Hankering lobster roll spot  closed on Sunday   We Lobster bisque $4 99 Lobster roll $16 Lobster salad roll $8 Lobster Mac cheese $16  The good service good contrary read pleasant server timely food hot   lobster roll decent but why tortilla might little pricey amount meat   The average bisque decent flavor little thick side    Mac n cheese started very average but actually much better later when sauce hardens little flavors meld   The bad necessarily bad let's say below avg lobster salad roll much lobster flavor going   They various seafood options might worth try come back ? Yeah give another shot  pics attached <EOR> I always wondered poorly cooked lobster would tastes if eaten if some dorm lounge   Now know   Whoever owns place thinks hanging Red Sox pennants wall fool people into thinking good New England style food made here  Its not   Never trust restaurant hidden another restaurant  Over priced lackluster food awkward table service  <EOR> We came few months ago fambam truly enjoyed dinner  in laws Hawaii thought lobsters really fresh amazing! enjoyed UConn Lobster Escargot  son husband loved Lobster Mac Cheese they're both big fan Mac Cheese  prices very good considering food great  Rick server incredible! He very helpful answering questions  Overall customer service great!

So most recently came party 7 when almost ready us   brought tray full 12 lobstah salad roll 7 fries   other 2 came later but everything excellent  Left full lobstah salad rolls fries  Good times  <EOR> The service slow macaroni cheese everyone raves took nearly 45 minutes wasn't worth wait   They don't serve alcohol dining area  walk attached bar your own drinks   It didn't good vibe no music no TVs everything paper plates napkins even forks  felt child's birthday party tacky plastic table cloths   We returning restaurant  <EOR> Great Mother's Day special $59 99 2ea 2lb lobsters HUGE 2 sides 2 desserts 2 coffees   never lobster large but perfectly cooked delicious  kids fish stick actually large piece sliced fish which great  No yucky minced crap  bit dissapointed didnt any chocolate cake dessert but did complimentary champagne which sweet    They pushed tables together group having kids relaxed atmosphere relieving   hope some more staff quickly holidays  sure your wait staff knows stock day advance  But staff sweet genuine hardly upset them    It seems every time more more people there  People may finding lil secret dive hot spot! Oh no! <EOR> Monstah Lobstah lovers!  We ordered lobster dinner $19 99 special before new year two fish tacos $2\taco taco Tuesday Meatball Sub $3 weekly special     We really enjoyed all it   We trouble finding restaurant seems haven't put full sign   liked Boston theme through interior  <EOR> I'm giving place 3 5 stars   third visit   first two good but bought Groupon try once more pleasantly surprised try number three   Lobstah Mac Cheese   mac cheese own nice creamy lovely light panko bread crumb crust top   just enough decent size lobster chunks around nothing crazy but stingy either     I am still bothered lack clientele during three visits even though all peak lunch dinner times   When arrived counter guy helping someone picking order stood several minutes before he acknowledged told sit anywhere in empty restaurant pointed where menus said should grab one   Another party three people arrived while seated counter guy STILL helping pick person did acknowledge them either   finally seated themselves   Service attentive fact practically NO all three visits     I would back Lobstah Mac Cheese again possibly try fried whole belly clams but am hesitant service fact fiance generic frozen fried shrimp last visit  shrug REALLY need step compete town   Lots East Coasters looking authentic food would through roof if hit right  <EOR> Horrible!! Six dinner soup salad 3 lobster dinnahs samplah mozzerella sticks kiddos mac cheese     Of course soups salads girls' food came first   liked put little blueberries salads mozzerella sticks pretty generic   soup came cold sent back reheated   friends' daughter didn't mac cheese send back   waitress came over said Well homemade  Aside being very rude comment cares if homemade if she doesn't it?!    All 3 lobster dinnahs cold send back well reheated   must cook bunch lobster all once then reheat them which doesn't anything taste tenderness meat   didn't taste very good first place even worse when came back couldn't eat all    No wonder place dead when walked blatantly rude staff cold tasteless food     NEVER mistake coming again!  Final words Spend few $ more Joe's Crab Shack  <EOR> I lobstah dinner which average   lobstah cauliflower baked potato all okay   husband chicken parmesean best   While large portion he could only eat half didn't bother bring rest home   dessert cannoli simply best   changed entire experience dessert nirvana!!
