Well   nothing really wrong but then again nothing really right   prices little steep getting   think more indicative being located MGM Grand   selection usual Asian cuisine  even saw some older Asian guy eating boatload noodles small glass concealed room middle restaurant though he some type exhibit   Maybe MGM Grand rid Lion Exhibit replaced dude    the Asian eating boatload noodles exhibit  Anyway    the food ok prices high   However reason come totally   reason shouldn't come because freaking bathroom does exist!  walk past craps tables ironic enough find bathroom   So   let understand this   mouth full noodles must travel many moons order relieve noodle?  Nah     Find another place  <EOR> This place nothing special but bite eat last minute before heading show  service fine atmosphere ok food good   think bill around $20  bad Vegas  <EOR> Caterpillar roll BBQ eel Hass avocado honey walnut shrimp combination fried rice Vietnamese shrimp pho   Pricey food   Suggest going Sushi Fever Sushi Tower Steakhouse  <EOR> To varying degrees every restaurant tried MGM Grand bust    At Craftsteak dinner best fine  But mostly pricey underwhelming    At Studio Cafe breakfast expensive version Denny's    More recently friends tried Grand Wok dinner    The verdict? Probably worst sushi ever eaten price point    Note Studio Cafe Grand Wok share demising wall  result configuration probably constitutes two worst restaurants back to back anywhere United States  least experience   I'm sure why keep doing myself  never even stayed MGM Grand  <EOR> This best option dining MGM Las Vegas  service courteous quick good job keeping busy place rolling along fairly smoothly  give pager call when your table ready earn your dinner money before head your table  sushi better priced neighboring Shibuya somewhat lesser quality but still it  Other items ordered off menu all worthwhile probably better bet sushi depending mood for  friend lived Japan two years satisfied sushi means good things suppose  recall sake hamachi particularly good    Warning once eating some odd soup when saw green bean looked tasty  Upon taking huge bite realized no bean fking pepper kicked ass  eyes turned red felt needed empty contents stomach sushi bar  Rough! guess just wasn't paying attention but owned here  still come back   good  <EOR> for 1 person ordered Sea Dragon two pieces yellowtail cup 4oz sake  later added Las Vegas rolls  very good meal! <EOR> The prices cheaper anything else MGM Grand but everything else super expensive  think could also passed if near some touristy area nyc but least food wasn't terrible  did come multiple times quick bite noodle soupy stuff before some shows extremely nice  If you're MGM Grand don't car think place safe bet  <EOR> Definitely favs years  time tried BBQ Pork appetizer  OMG!!! kidding me!! Melt your mouth  affordable  Thx Vegas making tumultuous week  <EOR> If could use work YUCK tell back food would but simply don't would justice    Unfortunately between lunch dinner hours most places wanted closed  open but full    The service somewhat slow everyone seemed waiting while staff cleaned    We ordered handful rolls seafood fried rice    The sushi rice pretty old  gummy just didn't taste right   I felt very Gordon Ramsay ish first bite  started ripping apart dragon roll looking something good  fish ok  Nothing special but nothing terrible  However I'd harp rice again  bad  think ordered sashimi I'd fine    The fried rice wasn't different would Panda   insert name mall  greasy very little seafood appeared frozen vegetables    I really should just drinks waited place open up  Oh well say here  <EOR> hm    well first off looked really nice outside many big tables  if planning eat 8 people going waiting two tables  many small tables two people wait would probably short  group waited around hour 20 mins table because bastards hogging tables getting multiple rounds drinks talked until damn lips fell off  since slot machines near burning more money wallet while waited    When finally pretty disappointed because person said 30 mins but can't blame hostess blame stupid people table  But return long wait service pretty good  manager seated personally drinks stuff  working restaurant could tell she totally kissing ass but she doing good it    I myself nice Captain coke friend red orchid drink fruity  All 8 order plate all shared  thought plates would good size    but small! ordered Mongolian Beef $17  $17 should good amount beef but 12 pieces  hm    Well guess MGM grand think all top line cuisine  EH  Some dishes chosen good some okay  Asian fusion thing best but food food hungry time    Then friend's mother told manager celebrating two friend's birthday dessert house  Woohoo! Everyone else fortune cookie  some chocolate moose thing martini glass good  friends plate strawberry cheesecake other 3 little mounts regular cheesecake  Mine best shared everyone first finished  couple drinks show paid ridiculous bill amount left semi satisfied  Next time hitting buffet  <EOR> Three stars because place overpriced otherwise all good  Any gourmet chinese food usually indicates red flag head because chinese food wasn't meant gourmet  However place full Asian people  always good sign   I ordered appetizer trio pan fried seabass beef tenderloin asparagus see photos   enjoyed everything walked away satisfied  Dining good alternative usual round buffets finer dining establishments especially when you're craving chinese food   <EOR> We 25 min eat before seeing show   Torn between over priced sandwich Starbucks sushi    chose sushi    We told host time restrictions she immediately jumped    asked if knew knew favorite rolls sat down   Our server brought water put order   said she would put rush it      Rolls served bill brought without asking   paid left    Service top notch    food tasted good  <EOR> Yes agree some reviews say your strip Las  Vegas but don't mind paying but want pay for! Spring rolls never gotten such small pencil size roll only mouth full six them much does cost rice noodles? least give decent size Spring Roll appetizer  We rainbow roll very small no sauce top  House wine $16 00 give break! Not worth money way over rated!! servings small! <EOR> Food service okay  Among dishes ate sweet sour soup tofu baby bok choy   The decor seemed fancy  liked jellyfish lights near entrance wood covered menus  <EOR> Why did even come here?? must defend myself  MGM where staying lazy leave hotel  must say   take your $$$ elsewhere  service slow food lacked flavor  think curry dish nearly $30 tasted came frozen bag grocery store  being harsh   I'm being honest! also ordered few sushi rolls joke  raw fish looked sketchy wouldn't even hold together plate  Ohh   and top off sister's noodle dish strand hair it  All all    EEEk! Methinks understatement  <EOR> I'd avoid place unless you're strictly looking sushi   nice staff authentic wok grill but come short o delivering flavor   sushi great which only afford them few breaks since prepare but nature made flavor   Lo Mein dismal   Greasy fatty broken noodles generally appealing   made through 3 sticks full gave even adding bowl sriracha   MGM needs re evaluate want place tied name just trim they're good  sushi lose wok   I actually tried place twice both corporate events where few set aside some time some private dinner   BOTH experiences practically identical   Good sushi very poor entrees   Teh Lettuce wraps pretty good but wouldn't Recommend going much above Sushi Apps  <EOR> People bitched price but c'mon folks sushi restaurant Strip?  Expect pay higher prices   After day two financial software conference wanted comfort food sushi and or rice noodles   comfort food Aloha Roll Rainbow Roll Singapore Curry Shrimp BBQ Pork Rice Noodles    The rolls served fast  flawlessly   Singapore Noodles weren't best but served purpose   On final note restaurant located inside casino near promenade where most other restaurants bars MGM Grand located   such might difficult find first  <EOR> I would give 0 stars if Yelp allows me   THIS INDEED SHITTY PLACE   We ordered 2 noodle soups which way far easiest thing menu ppl possibly order came 30 minutes  noodles both horrible  definitely tell just put frozen noodle soup without any effort presentable dish  When served still half cooked instant noodle  shocking chef mess such simple dish      And also very pricy paid over 50 bucks 2 bowls crap  Would never ever back again   The place right next called Avenue Cafe ok following day trip although waiting time bit long but food decent  <EOR> Came happy hour  Wanted bite before big dinner plans  2 6pm Sunday Tuesday    The grand hop tail drink very tasty gingery  The futomaki great  expected authentic bonito flakes pickled veggies tamago  miss me  avocado carrots  should asked prepared theirs    The duck pine nut lettuce petal 5 stars    Chicken wings delightful also winner! Well balanced sweet spicy  The place empty service nice  rush just enjoyed ourselves  <EOR> First off casino horrible chemical smell  sure if doing construction if always smells inside cleaning bottle  When sushi arrived looked bit lacking  hoped taste would size instead even sub par sushi tasted tuna  Bad buffet sushi much better then made here  never coming back likely being staying clear MGM all together this   After two rolls decide give Chinese food try still starving  veggie dumpling good but took over 30 minutes arrive they forgot them Malaysian noodles good  Nothing great overpriced each   Sushi 1 star Chinese 3 star Service 2 star Smell 0 star  <EOR> The Tom Yum noodle pretty good flavorful  Everything over priced  asked some extra lettuce leaves Lettuce Wrap appetizer just finish all fillings came it  Found later charged $1 four tiny leaves  Oh well expected restaurants big hotel anyway  <EOR> I steamed sea bass which perfectly cooked  Prices high end but loved seated immediately food arrived fast  <EOR> I staying Hooters Hotel Casino across street looking late night sushi knowing pricey Blue Ribbon Sushi Cosmopolitan Lyft drive way more expensive settled Grand Wok  Service great  asian female server amazingly attentive even though she confused draft beer steered toward Tiger beer even though came  bottle great all good  rainbow roll yellowtail roll Hanasshi? both fine  great but fine  Edamame great  last addition chicken pot stickers which tasty especially dipped chili sauce  All all good stop since convenient great service good food really needed traveling Houston  <EOR> I'm surprised some reviews place  wasn't spectacular but thought really decent price  budget food hard find somewhere dinner little nicer but only $50 two people    We ordered steamed potstickers which fine  combination fried rice red curry coconut chicken both really good  Now am rating any kind 'authenticity' scale which am skeptical anyway  thought full flavors greasy very nicely portioned    The atmosphere fun but themed many other places MGM  wish little less crowded but tables jammed here  server little clumsy but very attentive very pleasant  <EOR> I create Yelp account warn you     MGM claims 'Grand Wok' casual dining experience  Casual? Yes  Dining? Barely    Technically edible though if someone going charge minimum $22 $30 per dish I'd expect could better Panda Express I don't even mind PE sometimes should tell sad experience was   Vietnamese Summer Roll $11 99% noodle  1% Shrimp  Peanut sauce pretty solid  No veggies all?

The only bad thing each item small even doubling each dish only alloted sampler taste each person   $18 avg  per dish quickly added very filling meal   okay since buffet planned dinner but definitely something consider if going family style    all past experiences Grand Wok smaller groups everyone ordered own dish + some appetizers    Service good   seated immediately attended all times   mainstay MGM appreciate! <EOR> Pros None Cons Food Price Overall yourself favor use MGM Grand's Casino Entrance Exit turn right take 3 minute walk Panda Express   My fam craving some Chinese food recommendation cousin frequents Vegas says closest Chinese restaurant pretty good we staying MGM anyway Wow he wrong! First off don't eat seafood can't comment which dominates lot menu items   But here's did have  Mongolian Beef only good dish sampled  However mongolian beef  They're mini steaks  tasted good duck actually very tender  However nowhere near Mongolian beef  did sauce came since infused slight hint habanero  But Mongolian beef slightest  Chow fun Beef rice noodle soy sauce weren't kidding  just that  No other real flavorings just soy sauce  No attempt making delicious sauce  Just take some kikoman something pour over noodles fry 5 seconds serve  Wow  bad   Combination Fried Rice hell all beans? no meat dish  does this? Really????  Honey Walnut Shrimp cousin's favorite dish  He enjoyed it  enjoyed walnut   Additionally no free refills soda  mean I'd expect Pho restaurant but crappy expensive Chinese restaurant  I guess really Chinese but Asian Fusion Asian fused crap For those enjoy Chinese food know large family sized portions  didn't expect much but price pay surely don't delivery quality quantity   Overall place sucks left such bad memory head Panda Express morning much more satisfying meal less  yourself favor use MGM Grand's Casino Entrance Exit turn right take 3 minute walk Panda Express  <EOR> OVERPRICED  Sushi wasn't bad fish fresh enough but absolutely nothing special meh came mind especially much costs much get  Appetizer extremely small  Mainly turned off place service terrible  server hardly spoke did bring another pair chopsticks nicely requesting them several times when asked check brought empty book  all could smoothed over apology but alas none  She did check food needed anything else no thank coming end meal   recommend place far better options  <EOR> I liked place    I party 4 all split Orange Chicken Pad Thai Kung Pao Chicken  Chicken dishes came rice very small bowl  For price each and know Vegas but feel over priced portions get  quite expensive little bit food  still hungry when left   Orange Chicken Delicious!!!! hard wrong dish  favorites  sauce gingery great orange flavor real orange peel chicken perfectly crispy wonderful   Kung Pao Great dish  kick spice lot peanuts  Very good   Pad Thai alright  know Pad Thai egg but dish just extra eggy lacking other flavors texture classic Pad Thai  wouldn't again   Overall glad stopped food fix! <EOR> Everytime friend mines comes town always come eat because staff amazing especially manager rolls awesome!  Last time manager allowed seated even though close closing gave free desert   She amazing person   MmmmMMmmm pricey but worth it  <EOR> A bit pricey quality but bad ! actually give place 3 5    server didn't once come over ask we're doing anything  She actually forgot order soup ask mid meal   She said sorry getting old lol   _ egg drop soup $8 size typical Japanese restaurant complimentary miso soup size   guess when Vegas     I know there's more upscale sushi spot Mgm called shibuya but place do  there's Chinese food well  come back try again    <EOR> Went Grand Wok whim  sushi very fresh main plates great  Service point Asian   The ambiance excellent  there  <EOR> Pretty good Chinese food more affordable other restaurants MGM  wok fried noodles beef shrimp tempura roll  Both decent  boyfriend Orange Chicken which more sweet sour chicken but still pretty good  <EOR> Not impressed  Slow service mediocre food  Ur vegas bump ur game  Closed fortune cookies   <EOR> I no idea why other people gave restaurant low reviews food amazingly good!!! regularly eat Asian food various places over years food only tasty but fresh abundant sized portions menu offered variety dishes spicy sweet  only complaint however prices little high but  would expect Vegas  Definitely coming again  <EOR> Love place  just back Vegas MGM looking casual place dine  wife wanted sushi Grand Wok  food service excellent  best Mongolian beef ever had  tender cooked perfection  sushi also blast  Definitely check place out  prices modest  <EOR> Wandered Canelo v  GGG fight  enticed menu especially Chinese person  weary steep prices but figured food would least good  salted fish chicken fried rice boo beef udon roughly $24 each  If weren't salted fish fried rice would completely bland  rice itself no color  felt everything merely cooked enough just edible  Again wasn't expecting knock your socks off authentic food but did expect higher quality especially staff cooks Asian  more disappointing apparent Oolong tea  tasted light green tea when inquired server assured right tea  I'd think know teas no Oolong  even better tea Northside Café SLS  service overall fine  only redeeming quality experience meeting Dan Rafael stopped dinner himself  <EOR> Went quick bite beer   ordered pork pot stickers Rainbow roll  Pot stickers yummy but served 5 instead 6 could shared equally  rainbow roll Atlantic salmon avocado cream cheese my date's favorite ingredients very fresh rice perfect   wasabi   ginger also very fresh  waiter extremely attentive without being bothersome  Decor very nice  <EOR> We mood some Asian food spending two days eating mostly burgers sandwiches  Grand Wok able seat right away Saturday night all four people group really enjoyed food  Kung Pao chicken very tasty  food came quickly service profesional  Overall would definitely recommend check Grand Wok if want Asian MGM  <EOR> Food high quality spring rolls salmon sashimi chicken lettuce wraps  only complaints food bit overpriced because status being MGM Grand service difficult  server kept leaving extended periods time without checking table  P S  glass Sauvignon Blanc which excellent well  <EOR> By far most disappointing dining experiences  long time  reading some other reviews seems reasons behind bad visit shared others  clear just way restaurant vs off situation   What's little more disheartening each negative  situation responded some sort management implication would addressed corrected clearly cookie cutter reply    We greeted hostess seated right away soon greeted server  She took order which consisted 2 appetizers calamari pot stickers California roll Tom Yum soup  35 minutes appetizers california rolls finally arrive 10 minutes later ask where soup mind 45 minutes since actually ordered it   yes irritated cancel soup order ask check  bothers most asked speak manager never came  server gave check apologized since she could clearly sense annoyance    I understand restaurants run behind but once we're even told explained even addressed fact kitchen may running behind clearly waiting over half hour appetizers  would believed anyways considering table next seated half way through meals time cancelled rest food    Honestly food actually pretty good  calamari very tasty    As far ambiance does remind Asian inspired cafe  feel food bit overpriced is  Shibuya absolute but sadly closed think wait Morimoto open if want Asian food MGM  <EOR> I don't know if ever better dining experience life  absolutely love place    I scared wandered hostess stand asked woman if anything gluten free  Asian food scary people eat gluten free but Grand Wok only place open  surprise hostess whipped gluten free menu many options  mean Grand Wok seriously gave PF Changs run money  When seated waiter Leo super attentive double checked sure sweet sour chicken truly gluten free  He kept waters filled brought food less ten minutes ordered overall just took place slightly pricey Asian restaurant place really want come back to    Leo you're awesome  Keep doing you're doing  place definitely going must stop next time Vegas  <EOR> Place ok  Nothing memorable visit if dine maybe non sushi choices felt actually better rolls trader Joe's  Waitress also forgot part order but brought right asked check  Don't think ill coming back during next Vegas trip <EOR> Service excellent but food mediocre best  3 rolls egg drop soup few pieces nigiri chicken low mein just water bill $100  soup lacked any flavor  basic shrimp tempura roll but again no flavor shrimp wasn't crispy warm  Boyfriend's rolls didn't look appetizing but didn't try them  impressed shoulda listened other reviews but wanted easy just eat hotel  <EOR> I'm back Vegas time hubby needed quick fix dinner wanted Chinese food before heading back airport fly back bay area   Since before thought heck know decent     This time however food lacking big time flavor   Chow fun good won ton noodle soup all just broth no flavor   Even poor little dumplings didn't taste good   also order miniature spring rolls   When say miniature kidding   Check pictures     I won't coming back third time  <EOR> Inside MGM open late great customer service wonderful cuisine   If love great sushi drinks then must    pricey but worth it    It girlfriend first time but back  <EOR> I'm amazed place good reviews  Rubbery gross

Worth every penny!  $80 2 included fresh sushi pad Thai seafood clay pot dessert 2 tip! <EOR> 3 stars doesn't express much enjoyed meal here  Yes Grand Wok isn't restaurant would way dine but convenient if you're staying MGM Grand appreciate or case in laws need Asian food  MGM without its Asian options Shibuya Hakkasan but Grand Wok more affordable would argue food even better Shibuya  menu covers Chinese Japanese sort of Thai Singaporean dishes  and while nothing spectacular nothing awful either  lot Asian tourists restaurant necessary because burgers steaks pizzas real old real fast   I recommend skipping sushi altogether sticking noodle based rice based dishes  liked beef chow fun fried rice ramen honey glazed walnut shrimp soo much better Shibuya!   Service attentive accommodating wait staff definitely made meal much more pleasant  <EOR> So MGM property which means charge back your room MGM any sisters properties now includes many hotels    Service very good  Ambiance also nice modern feel Asian twist   Food wise would say well above average but 5 star   Overall would recommend place if sushi even nice place lunch dinner  <EOR> Fair best   tuna marginal simple tuna roll veggies tempura roll many ripe enough  Almost worth sending back  many great options Vegas good Sushi them  <EOR> 3 5 stars!  Even though said 30 minute wait probabaly only waited 10 15 minutes!  The service bit slow expect wait them take your order refill tea water box check when you're done  Besides friendly just seems they're understaffed    Don't order tea!! ordered 3 cups tea gave little pot which wasn't even big enough fill all 3 cups  Each cup $4 50    way expensive cup tea seldom refilled!  Food review only cooked food didn't try any sushi  appetizer ordered calamari yum! entrees ordered Malaysian noodles Singapore noodles garlic shrimp fried rice nasi goreng fried rice  all tasty! rice noodles cooked weren't clumped together good flavor  I'd say most bland garlic shrimp fried rice  favorite Malaysian noodles because lot seafood it!  Overall nice place dinner your family friends! prices expensive fried rice noodles but Vegas cheaper many other places  <EOR> This place sanctuary late night!  aren't many selections menu if you're going just sushi cocktails   But sushi very tasty if hastily made   rolls pretty big order perfect dinner   Feng Shui cocktail out of world but sweet liquid candy!  boyfriend ordered bowl scallops variety veggies he ate every last bite   Definitely great place visit if you're hungry MGM 10pm! <EOR> I ordered Vietnamese Shrimp Pho  Bean sprouts mint leaves sliced jalapeños hoisin chili sauces provided  big bowl noodles 4 shrimps came out  shrimp big succulent  Absolutely delicious!
