I ordered Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork waffle sandwich strawberry lemonade friend ordered Bruxie Burger regular waffle fries which shared   thought portions looked small first especially since prices very cheap but mistaken  felt full near end meal  pulled pork sandwich okay little messy eat since started falling apart soon took first bite  fan strawberry lemonade  tasted very bland mushed strawberries water    I am giving place three stars because rude server mediocre food slightly high prices  prices would better if sandwiches included fries  $2 95 separate order waffle fries which only included 6 fries definitely worth it! <EOR> If friend chicken waffles place good you  no sauce usual save calories keep waffle getting soggy glad did too  <EOR> We walked 30 minutes chicken waffle sandwiches we'd gladly again   fries perfect angry Mac n cheese superb well   you're fan chiken waffles yourself favor stop while town  <EOR> This first time trying Bruxie  When bf walked line but along quickly  many options choose employees display great customer service! love workers walk around each table time time see if everything ok  even take your cup refill !

So outside walls NYNY sits Bruxie blossoming Park area between Monte Carlo  Prime real estate indeed area flourishing but whole don't eat home theory plays sometimes because rarely see place packed   I random craving chicken fingers totally overlooked but glad didn't time  batter crispy flaky but falling off chicken certainly represented night  chicken itself very moist bite over cooked grown used to  did come partnered Carolina BBQ sauce which took meal new heights even herb ranch dressing left clucking pleasure   I didn't quite care much staff weren't all friendly but focused food tuned them very easily once dug into chicken  always knew them good waffle sandwiches but now I'd list them go to chicken tender spot  Well buck buck that! <EOR> YUM!!! craving chicken waffles place hit spot  visited weekday wasn't really line but reviews read looks wait pretty long weekends  decided original which waffle sandwich chicken coleslaw  waffle unreal  light airy buttery sweet all same time  really liked waffle part light because middle dense  chicken little spicy hint sweet perfectly balanced waffle coleslaw  ate every single bit sandwich if lived Vegas would visit more often    Definitely recommend if haven't yet waffle sandwich craving chicken waffles! <EOR> Food excellent green eggs ham Drink n a Serv average speed Music average Price average Other cool seating <EOR> Stopped lunch  ordered fried chicken salad kind chopped salad breaded chicken tender cut into pieces across top Holy Chicken sandwich large waffle folded half bread filled spicy breaded chicken breast egg over hard you order any way you'd like bacon  husband said slight hint syrup but wasn't sure if baked into waffle added drizzle  came waffle cut fries    Both items very large servings fresh ingredients  chicken crunchy outside moist inside fries crispy hot    Very enjoyable  Would try more items menu  <EOR> The food good!

Really good brunch food satisfy your cravings  Portions big would suggest ordering less add more if needed  chicken waffles delicious choice sweet savory! Would def come back! Lots outdoor seating well <EOR> Ate girlfriend yesterday first time different liked would try again <EOR> I always Bruxies LA but Vegas actually pretty awesome  don't remember chicken being well seasoned LA but AMAZING  <EOR> Food pretty good but don't think chicken waffle sandwich worth $12 when comes no sides drinks anything   Wish would lower prices bit give more your money  Orders came pretty quick just fan cost  <EOR> I'm glad stopped tried different spin chicken waffles  holy chicken sandwich waffle fries strawberry lemonade  good left full practically entire day  liked mix flavors between maple glazed fried chicken sriracha sauce bacon egg  Dip some waffle syrup tasty sweet salty mix little kick sriracha  originally thought waffle would more fluffy sandwich would break apart immediately soon bit into it  held together great likely because waffle little crunchy outside thinner i'd expected  Overall service great food yummy know bad choice when line door  Definitely must eat if you're fan chicken waffles  <EOR> Fried chicken waffle sandwich??  Totally caught eye complex NYNY new since last Vegas  Came lunch try original chicken waffle sandwich  Hubby hot pastrami Swiss  also tried strawberry lemonade waffle fries mac cheese   Maybe giant stomach but didn't find sandwich big  plenty room sides eating sandwich   Both sandwiches great messy but super tasty  Waffles nice light meats nicely done  Crispy but greasy  Waffle fries average  Mac cheese below average kind reminded cheese whiz  Would skip sure  Loved strawberry lemonade! Nice balance against saltiness rest meal   Priced $10 sandwich $3 4 side  Casual option where order counter take your food once ready  Items made fresh order  <EOR> As California native long time regular both original Bruxie Orange Bruxie Irvine come familiar food because honestly quite good  But Ellen L  mentioned yesterday location seems lacking consistency California Bruxie's have    A nearby restaurant considerably long line decided eat Bruxie having noticed earlier no line location  ambiance restaurant much other locations important capturing essence original location which small shack intersection Orange  decided order Bacon Egg Cheddar something come love two favorite waffles Bruxie  addition ordered seasonal Eggnog Shake just kicks  whole ordering process pretty smooth except expecting them ask whether wanted Bacon Egg Cheddar light spread mayo but she didn't ask    The food came quickly drinks first followed all entrees shortly thereafter  When bit into BEC didn't taste right seemed missing bit flavor  didn't take long realize didn't put mayo it  Now easily remedied asking some mayo staff did taste good afterwards but issue again comes down consistency    I am fan Bruxie but think location needs step up  Overall staff nice food most part good if seemingly regular pattern mistakes oversights I'd definitely comfortable 4 star review  <EOR> I excited try place because chicken waffles!   A friend both ordered Holy Chicken because looked really good picture  waffle chicken sandwich bacon egg  Once food tasted amazing  addition sandwich waffle fries strawberry lemonade side    The food place definitely met expectations am looking forward going back! <EOR> Chicken waffle sandwich bacon eggs bomb bomb bomb bomb com   crispy salty sweet goodness  <EOR> Pretty cool new place Vegas Blvd   came brunch luckily beaten rush   food great   chicken well breaded crispy   waffle fries pretty standard   surprised spicy mayo though   Might recommend friends don't spicy food  <EOR> Having always fan Bruxie excited see Vegas now located right next Shake Shack! while since delicious chicken waffle sandwich Bruxie sure did deliver  ordered Nashville Style Hot waffle sandwich which included nice juicy fried chicken thigh shredded lettuce pickles nice tangy sauce top off  opted pickles since fan but everything else sandwich just delightful loved it  waffle soft fluffy thick wouldn't tired easily   chicken fried perfection since dark meat wasn't dry all  couple days late review definitely starting drool trying remember every bite had    As if chicken sandwich alone wasn't enough tempted myself kids meal small order waffle cut fries mac n cheese  wanted both sides but fearing side orders would much ordered kids meal thinking portions would smaller  sure if case but definitely right amount me! also kids cup lemonade soda milk it  Both fries mac n cheese bomb if happen fence say just it!   Having ordered way much food already mentally stop myself getting sweet waffles  Creme Brulee waffle looked heavenly luscious definitely died little inside    But okay just gives another reason back next time!   Service good great  order give looks pager buzzer but actually doesn't buzz  number once your order ready workers call your number spotting walk over hand your order  might more efficient inside but since sat outside little unorganized  think having actual buzzer just having customers walk pick order would much easier  forgot fries drink walk back counter ask it  no big deal but think easier just pick everything all once counter having workers struggle bringing everything you  But regardless workers really friendly fries drink right away!  Overall totally recommend if you're waffle lover! <EOR> This place amazing! I'd never chicken waffles before perfect place try it  simple two piece chicken waffles  chicken crispy maple glaze it  waffle melting butter two combined very well afraid might dry but extremely juicy  wife friends sandwiches which specialty enjoyed them  didn't because don't eggs  employees very nice answered all questions cleaned plates finished but didn't feel rushed out  <EOR> Yum Yum Yum!!!
