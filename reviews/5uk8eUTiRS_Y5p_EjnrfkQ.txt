Service good fast but food below standard  Other pizza pasta chain food court would choice  <EOR> Try Stromboli!  best thing n strip hands down  NYNY nothing guys  Dani operated register accurately  <EOR> I don't understand other reviews place great  only things eaten pizza garlic knots  place tradition every time Vegas    Let's remember food court bar isn't set high    The pizza outstanding consider myself pizza aficionado  crust very thing perfect chew great sauce perfect cheese topping ratio  trip slice cheese pep sausage pep spinach mushroom  All perfect  Made mistake going planet pizza other side hotel nasty  <EOR> Open late guess place good late snack munchies       but you're Las Vegas way more options available!  Pizza alright  value definitely because while decent pizza cost almost $20 two slices pizza  bet hardly any toppings pizzas either   They also serve pasta zitis but honestly haven't chance try em  <EOR> I love Bonanno's  favorite pizza Vegas! saved ton buy half off because eat entire time there  Sometimes twice day! Pepperoni pep sausage both killer! <EOR> Let clarify ate 4am   The pizza itself very good   meat lovers bbq chicken pizza   Both flavorful packed toppings crust really good  generally don't crust but definitely Bonanno's   The downside place? Each slice close $7   Yes said $7!   I proceeded order 4 slices haha   I think would cheaper if just ordered whole pizza but type logic 4am?   Not sure if I'd during day but definitely late night hot spot  <EOR> warmed fat dripping pizzas VERY uncommon seasoning meat lovers version    <EOR> Garlic knots delicious  However pizza isn't best  food court quality wouldn't again  $5 slice pizza   not worth it!  My sister in law ordered salad   there two salads menu Caesar salad side salad  Since she doesn't Caesar dressing she ordered side salad   then asked kind dressing have   they only Caesar lol  basically two sizes   not two different salads  <EOR> I'm Palace station used canned mushrooms!!! Ewwwww boooo place weeeaaakkkkkk!!!  But crust good  <EOR> Great late night snack  wasn't best pizza but keep mind food court decent slice hit spot when many other places open right casino  garlic knots also pretty good too  ate more once week long stay  staff helpful friendly worked fast move through line customers  prices decent too  Check place if you're looking quick bite  only good soaking alcohol before bed but also helps hangover think places stayed open longer other places food court  <EOR> I searching quick breakfast when noticed line people pizzeria  converted over breakfast menu early morning customers  ordered Belgian waffle combo sure expect  waffle freshly cooked syrup heated help melt butter  only negative bacon burned little much  Overall pleased quality breakfast waited less 5 minutes  <EOR> I am local don't strip much  However when tired Subway salads local neighborhood come son grab Caesar Salad  best Caesar salad dressing ever tasted worth driving get  can't find anything even grocery store shelf  want take moment thank manager Joshua Tree ensuring fresh salad being served customers  told regular previous salad ordered day usual he wasted no time replacing it  He even seem proud replace me  quality management very impressive leadership  He did give attitude also  He also made only charging half price salad  back feel good being permanent spot good Caesar Salad  Good job Joshua!!! <EOR> Awesome choice late night munchies!  lived NYC 24 years pretty high standards want slice bacon slice wasn't far off mark!  friend bacon slice and side ranch pour all over it 6 garlic knots   slice actually quite heavy cheesey dripping its own oils which must if you're claiming pizza New York style   garlic knots quite delicious well!  pretty huge incredibly soft   Could used bit more garlic but texture made that   dipped ranch well even though come marinara   While food satisfying prices bit high   paid 16$ slice garlic knots    Vegas though I'd still come back midnight more! <EOR> Fast service  Especially when large crowd 4am! pepperoni pizza delicious  much bread just right amount   They don't RANCH! does that??  But Johnny Rockets right next door glady give ranch your pizza pleasures lol  I think place pretty affordable good drunken snack! <EOR> I can't believe chose place quick meal Vegas! terrible! meat Stromboli wasn't cooked stuff could've old because made feel very uneasy it  service impressive either! <EOR> This New York style pizza! may look but doesn't taste anything it  quality cheese regular cheese pizza terrible could eat it  <EOR> I tried Stromboli based topher p's review   Stromboli when paired finer Pepsi product great way finish night <EOR> Late night pizza  just walk away? Uh why not?! definitely read couple mediocre reviews but pizza   kind hard mess up  am definitely reminded Sbarro's pizza  Which no complaints about  open until 4am 2 30am wasn't much choices  slice spinach mushroom pizza $7  say? Vegas prices  Expect pay much! no complaints  happy customer  probably earlier more selection next time  <EOR> Bought  sausage Stromboli salad   salad very good  Stromboli amazingly disappointing  sausage bland cheese lukewarm rubbery bread crunchy outside but squishy inside almost uncooked dough   wasn't anything else identifiable olives vegetables other meats  Rather pricey too  Next time just order food Uber deliver it  <EOR> Located inside Flamingo Hotel's food court! needed quick bite eat before bed stopped here  service decent workers friendly  pizza didn't look good though either  actually even more expensive Secret Pizza! pizza tasty  felt bit ripped off would rather spend money Secret Pizza this! <EOR> Terrible breakfast sandwiches   chewy tasted if they'd sitting hours  <EOR> This good place when want something fast  pizza salad meatballs really good  bit pricey but well worth it  <EOR> Fast Service      Out    Located inside Flamingo Hotel casino need grab something eat whats better pizza??? LOL restaurant basically located food court area several other restaurants    I ended ordering stuff meat pizza served side marinara sauce really yummy but instantly gave heartburns  If area need quick cheap greasy fix     your place    The staff kind service fast  may check them again  <EOR> I ordered slice pepperoni pizza which came $7 meat ball $1 98 ended paying $10 change  slice pizza wasn't good all doesn't taste New York style pizza  stomach ache right after  <EOR> I looking some inexpensive late night grub when walking between Linq Flamingo  Bonanno's located food court inside Flamingo  menu pretty much basic there's course pastas salads stromboli whole pizza pizza slice    I ordered pepperoni mushroom pizza  choice considered gourmet topping $7? ordered large Pepsi $4  When looking Cheese pizza slice $5 Pepperoni slice $6    I standing line waiting pay noticed some confusion customer trying pay cash register then line held worst  guy behind wanted quick because all he order  party didn't mind wanting ahead because some orders wait re heated he ahead us  Still line wasn't moving same guy really upset left    I noticed when food prepared employees shuffling plates around behind counter guess trying figure if everything order  Again also made service even slower  paying 8 minutes later didn't apology delayed wait  time table took bite pizza cold! upset didn't want back line ask warmed up  Forget it!   Funny later same customer left came back noticed he never helped started complaining other people he cursed else where   I spend much time review service affected others well end result cold pizza  Therefore didn't banana's Bonanno's  better pizza slice I'd rather stick Secret Pizza Cosmopolitan  <EOR> Tried Bonanno's first time while lunch break Massage conference  First off local say when reading previous reviews complaining price don't much worth STRIP! Everywhere unless off strip more into local parts town  prices menu  If expensive whyd eat there? Boggles mind    Anyways thought slice Broccoli Spinach Pizza delicious  never combo before very tasty  even toast again sitting under head lamp which nice    The slice big opinion  price yeah pricey but expect being casino strip  Wish brought lunch home but oh well    Would recommend if want pizza but don't want leave hotel? Definitely  <EOR> Excellent Pizza  favorite pizza strip  located Flamingo Casino food court  <EOR> Breakfast sandwich  $6  Freshly cooked bacon  rest soggy under the heat lamp quality it  Poorly trained server couldn't figure charge room claimed she couldn't find room number  <EOR> I don't know if just cause hungry when playing games    but pizza delicious garlic knots BOMB!!! favorite place grab late night snack Flamingo! <EOR> I am big fan pasta but whenever vegas always eat baked zitti  really yummy creamy little sweet also portions really big  only order 1 but fills wife even child  Must try when Vegas usually found most food courts hotels  <EOR> We stopped week way town thinking it'd cheaper option sit down places Strip   also mood just something on the go eaten little food court before thought we'd give whirl    We opted pepperoni stromboli's   looked good also stuck them oven heat them up   Overall tasted okay but little cheesy tastes     Our only complaint price   small bottle Aquafina two smallish stromboli's $24   Total rip off you're getting   Again Strip  you're paying for     Overall food good but just expensive you're getting  <EOR> This review little bit late but is  visited Vegas holidays stayed Flamingo  Wanted grab some late night eats before room night stopped here  bad all  price inflated but Vegas does really count against them  pizza slice generously sized perfectly greasy night cocktails  Keep mind pizza sits under heat lamps knows long going amazing  throw oven when order heat up  service just ok  Nothing special  mini food court place best food opinion  Looking something quick easy good place  <EOR> We night before left  ordered baked ziti could believe amount put plate kind asked enough when she added another scoop said serve large portions! ordered meatballs garlic knot well before knew much food getting! ziti really good marinara sauce top but way much eat  really didnt care meatballs my girlfriend loved would never ever order them again  could only take few bites garlic knot but thought great  All all good food court bang your buck especially if sharing otherwise seemed waste food unless container would finish off later! <EOR> I enjoyed slice pepperoni pineapple pizza very much! food area little dirty some empty trays needed refilled food cleaned  <EOR> For quick snack Vegas place serves purpose   Don't expect over top service just bare minimum some food   food expected food court ultra great but doesn't suck either  <EOR> I am surprised am even giving place two star   Probably because workers look really working hard  I ordered french toast platter hash browns   place looks assembly line   food no better McDonalds   Everything just heating container   When order something scoop throw styrofoam plate    I ordered food three people food before did   When did hash brown rectangle greasy Micky D's   French toast nothing special   Eggs tasted processed vat   Flamingo okay place much  <EOR> The pizza bad late night pizza but no where near New York Pizza label themselves  top don't offer fresh garlic garlic powder definitely New York pizza  drunk area definitely good pizza fix but prepared drop LOT money here  <EOR> I am writing review food although decent   A woman named Jackie took care every morning alway pleasant greeted everyone even drunks kind smile   Unfortunately rarity today but proof little things matter food takes back seat great service  <EOR> This small outlet Flamingo's food court ate during last stay Flamingoes  first attempt baked ziti basically penne meatballs garlic knot combo  pasta raw meatballs needed hammer chisel garlic knot doughy  could myself eat crap slice pizza which Good but managed something down  expected prices inflated just slice pizza running around $7  Totally avoidable  Take pain walking myriad options strip take away experience  <EOR> Do bother  understand if open later most restaurants and or pizzerias strip but does justify 18 00 dollar price tag two sub par slices  Actually slices even good many dollar slice spots know NYC! Stay away! am only giving 2nd star convenience even stay open all night   if arrived 5 minutes later would 0 stars   <EOR> This place serves big slices pizza  Came terrible dining experience elsewhere  good combo slice drink $8 think  available seating great view including outside seating near pool  spot located within flamingo casino fast easy  pizza tasty bad all  <EOR> For anyone know's Sbarro's Bonanno's New York Pizzeria basically cheap imitation meant feed drunk and or down luck Lost Wages visitors passing through Flamingo  Similar large slices thin deep crust pizza IMO overpriced under seasoned  While can't judge other offerings obvious amongst co diners 'za nothing more late night fix folks cutting through returning hotel hours bar crawl  pizza sits warmers waiting thrown oven re heated  End result bland watery attempt New York thin crust $7 00  Don't waste your time unless meant fight rough migraine morning  <EOR> Wanted some garlic knots which plenty left but told closed  Alright great if want waste food turn away business cool that  <EOR>
