I always take wings to go  branch Santa Fe closest house always good experience ordering here  Usually when come though busy can't attest much quality during busy hours but never issues food  other reviews read location give average rating perhaps dine in take out quality different? keep coming back due convenience experiences here  don't eating casino food courts anyways keep carrying out  Friendly staff  Great wings  <EOR> Deplorable   Horrible service  Sucked big time even consider taking time schedule write review  I never write reviews! Tried call order literally placed hold over 15 minutes  purposely waited patiently thinking Ok must busy  Someone pick courteously ask remain hold bit longer  NO didn't happen  even once    I hung called right back before could greet again getting ready automatically placed hold again until yelled Wait! already hold 15 minutes  please just take order real quick  know want  simple  Angela said she only line door  Well if she taken order over phone within first 5 minutes holding told couldn't take phone orders time could driven over food within same time frame placed hold  She wanted place hold another 15 minutes until she line taken care of  WTH!  They need more cashiers during rush hour close phone hours during time  Something give name Customer Service  many orders did miss having someone take phone orders only during rush hour 5pm Monday? Many!  As far food    Tried Atomic Hot those just ridiculously hot no reason  No flavor   just way beyond habanero spicy picked every possible super spicy herb said Just throw   Sauce dropped arm literally whelped skin  Even finger tips burned sauce  o O No Bueno!  Tried Chile Lime   tastes just used Taco Seasonings splash lime  okay but mood chicken wings tacos  Palette confused   I guess best thing Keep Simple   Lemon Pepper Original Hot   Plus choose location better customer service  Which means probably won't eating Wingstop anytime soon because driving across town another location  hubby's homemade Lemon Pepper Hot Wings AWESOME! just didn't feel greasing kitchen evening  <EOR> Food Wings delicious but chicken fingers very salty   high blood pressure salty    Cleanliness tile walls need cleaned grout  <EOR> I two Wingstop locations north Las Vegas far best  team fast friendly food fresh  more ask for?

Therefore love place! favorite flavors original hot garlic parmesan lemon pepper bone course! Chicken wings boneless  sauces don't come pay extra   this fast food!  sauces free! hehe does takes 12minutes order because fried order  once lucky while miscount extra wing! maybe making size wings? sometimes smaller usual   It's great location close except fact casino park walk it  ordering home takeout little humbug but if your craving wings do! sometimes watch movie craving order out  eat before going movies    It's nice when sister brother used stay because also loved wings would bring them over dinner  now stay Red Rock where isn't wingstop  but then again also opened Hawaii now special them  <EOR> Amazing Louisiana rub chicken wings fresh cut fries! No breading veggies  Very affordable two ppl!
