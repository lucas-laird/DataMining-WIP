same crap server service way  fact think even worse because don't tip 5 bucks used anymore per drink  give buck 2 if winning  would give 5 still bad service stopped that  Tired being disappointed  still give 5 servers consistently good know are  Anyways   so finally sit down  Took good minute before server order drink  usually wait until give order start eating  Finally she comes  Off food  hate say but single thing looked good  one  search plate  no plates  Very small selection food items  Very basic things  But honestly nothing looked good all  Everything looked old dark drab unappealing  Asian section looked complete garbage  leftover some other restaurant just dumped steam table  Ugh  Even Tex Mex looked pretty bad  really no words  price worth it  Yes mine comped but would never pay that  Especially if higher tier card  don't seem even recognize it  know race vip  completely ignore card tier levels here  returning second run almost run over own server  Apparently less anyone just always feeling because white especially witnessing saw within same hour mentioned earlier review   I would recommend anyone  Now staying west side see myself coming back   P S  Don't wrong didn't white kid wrong line just didn't Hispanic couple wrong line either  But players club chose handle right way when buffet chose ignore let slip  Coincidence? Maybe but then also happened only when revealed card even though supposed Presidents line did change  Coincidence? 3 3? don't think so  think staff conditioned way  Am asking them change?
