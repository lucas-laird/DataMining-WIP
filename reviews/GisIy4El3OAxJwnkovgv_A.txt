Three times  Each time he told NO  explained baby allergies NO safe  Great 3 hours later sick baby  Googled recipe  Bingo  I'm considering calling corporate complain but quite while ago just catching reviews now  <EOR> Not gonna lie never eat food because know just okay  don't really crave hot dogs! But sometimes funnel cake when sweet tooth!! The ONLY thing buy LEMONADE  Ohhhh  lemonade  thirsty just thinking it! comes three flavors regular lime cherry  don't frozen because doesn't give full blast flavor! Every  Single  Time  food another restaurant mall never order drink  always buy lemonade Hot Dog Stick because tasty sweet! just feel good satisfied inside My favorite flavors lime cherry! taste bit sweet if you're really into sugary drinks  bit expensive but feel its worth when you're washing down whatever food ordered mall!  Also suggest sit near Hot Dog Stick while you're eating because when workers smashing lemons time time really off putting sound! actually scared first haha! <EOR> Hot dog stick preferred over hot dogs any day  love corn dogs friends delicious well  If ever don't know eat suggest choosing that <EOR> I love cheese stick because reminds younger days amusement parks  could never find them anywhere else! Well now mall near me    I gotten American cheese kind well tried hot dogs  fan hot dog really but cheese good long its straight fryer  Any later its soft icky  lemonades perfect when hotter Hades outside  <EOR> Let just start fact there's never anyone present front whenever come here  person just randomly comes back doesn't greet you  first time corn dog cooked all way meat cold dough still gooey! second time food actually good but soon food guy working straight back then later came cook food missed 4 customers between time  Where customer service?? manager lol smh  Don't expect anything fast location    Photo attached guests waiting least 5min before same guy came back  <EOR> Visited Saturday 10 01 2016 8PM   $10 12 corn dog cheese dog order fries lemonade     The poor gal working all alone but despite being short handed she still friendly she handling those orders BOSS   really impressed multi tasking skills   I'd watch take order then check begin foods then come back take order etc   woman needs raise  sure employees hate but love little primary colored uniforms especially hat     Everything eat hot fresh   fries crispy nice seasoning salt them   would compare fries McDonald's shape but much crispier    Their lemonade amazing   different flavors but favorite classic original   sweet but tart always ice cold   never heartburn which unusual but think because fresh     My favorite thing cheese stick   and yes white trashy fattening sounds    choose American cheese spicy pepper jack cheese mozzarella cheese   favorite American cheese version because tastes exactly grilled cheese but stick deep fried    you can't wrong that   outside regular corn dog but inside gooey melty cheese   feel very aroused just thinking again   next wedding anniversary requesting bouquet cheese sticks instead flowers     If find yourself mall DGAF your waistline then gotta hit place up  <EOR> Normally very awesome love food! kids love no problem company  Tonight brief trip mall little hungry 30 min till close bad know employees want home but still Genesis pretty rude she rolled eyes took those deep annoyed breaths almost cried meant come 30 min before close   way avoid eating location if she's Since she rush food little burnt <EOR> I don't know why disappointed here  love corn dogs  similarly love deep fried corn dogs  When woke craving corn dog headed down visit GF cheat going competition    There girl working she taking order collecting money washing hands then cooking order repeating  4 orders deep wait least 10 mins if closer 15 mins place order  hard would take two more orders cash them wash your hands then prep serve orders? Would cut time half made experience much better    Once received corn dogs little over cooked liking breading very thin  sure thick breading fairs but I'd recommend learn its half fun eating corn dog  cornmeal!   flavor good most likely only redeeming quality trip here   that fact now selling all beef hotdogs did wonder worry using previously    I'd give them another try next time craving corndog but if line only person working  <EOR> According Yelp rating 4 stars means your fan place am huge fan simple yet delicious hotdogs cheeses stick  don't know place grossly overpriced but keep coming back each time am mall just one  Plus lemonade awesome to! Maybe those silly uniforms am attracted to? knows  business many years now can't only addiction place  <EOR>
