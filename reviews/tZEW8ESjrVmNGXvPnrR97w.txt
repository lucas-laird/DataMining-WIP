Andrew C boyfriend decided come dinner  let tell place confusing  Finding wasn't hard cause giant shrimp building but once walked wondering if supposed American Creole Asian  establishment very spacious decorations VERY modern  know feeling when walk into restaurant  supposed Asian but doesn't look Asian little skeptical       But heck lamb skewers lamb sticks called it  trying find good place lamb skewers ages!  So group ordered hot pot stick spicy lamb skewers med spicy beef skewers spicy    For hot pot sticks came pitcher hot pot soup skewers  choose 4 menu chose shrimp beef tendon balls fried tofu king oyster mushroom  hot pot soup base pretty much mala broth  wasn't spicy per say just hot     temperature hot  end dish average  wasn't anything special  just order king oyster mushrooms its own?!   The lamb skewers very good but flavor difference between medium spicy spicy huge  medium spicy lamb skewers tasted sweet while spicy ones spicy  medium spicy ones no go  LOVED spicy ones  DELICIOUS  exactly type lamb skewers look for  Wonderfully seasoned cumin spicy flavor  only thing     pieces meat quite small  would probably better if pieces bigger less well done  Oh eat them while they're still hot because once gets cold doesn't taste good anymore   The beef skewers other hand no go  don't think beef cumin good combination  Then again maybe just biased? just lamb better beef when comes cumin spicy seasoning    Overall  Lamb skewers go  definitely come back them maybe try some seafood <EOR> You gotta love place where wear plastic gloves bib eat  much fun food well delicious  Good beer service  I'd recommend happily  <EOR> A couple weeks back invited informal business meeting SEO Marketing specialist use place employment Which whom reviewing shortly review  Anyways he kept talking awesome place Hot Feel was  Let honest second getting invited restaurant called Hot Feel another guy come off little odd but he then mentioned place going use your hands down dirty  Okay maybe best way invite someone either    Once past jokes puns sure through replied simple answer Hell Yes ill Hot Feel you  seen pictures he posted facebook interior food down try out   I rolled parking lot greeted HUGE shrimp front building which really stands parking lot happen once walk pretty surprising way booth tables set pretty cool private yet private     only say because being 6'5 am much taller average customer night could basically sit chair perch over see everyone around doing But interior cool none less    Now onto nitty gritty menu came table off races Sooner could rip head off shrimp king crab hot pots looked endless supply sticks hanging table well spicy beef skewers  say spicy loosely because love extreme hot food according trusty taste buds trust stomach would call HOT menu hot enough but some table would thought someones long lost grandma just passed all tears being shed  Anyways quality food great food fresh hot temperature hot scoville units hot customer service wait staff great  would definitely come back see if could anty spicy department  <EOR> So far good and spicy definitely back  spacious restaurant  Staff uber friendly  didn't catch name but he pretty cool server   First off hotpot combo  4 items 5 pieces each soaks hotpot broth  There's no mild second option terms spice levels 3 total   He says doesn't soak spice much short time span but tofu SOAKS well  beware if can't take much spice me   Aside only lamb skewers  back other stuff  Now lamb skewers mild because frankly don't want die burning   So guess what? died burning  spicy!!!!!!!
