Won't back sorry say!! <EOR> I am happy Crazy Pita now West side town! going locations District Town Square long open I even used original location Horizon Ridge but only when am way work live Northwest  Everything ever GREAT! love Kefta chicken skewers wow veggies skewers die for  Now side town finally introduce husband food he loved well he gyro sandwich  service fantastic always  saw some other reviews mention waiting time  8 years eating Crazy Pita's across valley never issue only guess because grand opening Downtown Summerlin few other restaurants being open yet  You really MUST eat here! <EOR> Food interesting take Mediterranean standards  Servings come kitchen very slowly but offerings tasty   currently place quick meal but atmosphere convivial staff members helpful   We three tried grape leaves dolmades which came yogurt studded seemed sort pickle  couscous flavored curry powder no fresh parsley arrived warmed chunks squash orange green side pita  soup looked hearty  it vegetable beef laden  Chicken pita also among choices chicken pieces quite large   Caesar salad something we'd recommend   Other notes pita flat sweet couldn't split open  Pita chips used croutons salad  Fresh brew teas available including good green tea expected drunk iced   Once noon wait time kitchen process orders lessened we'll list store revisit  <EOR> The food good same menu other locations but does take while arrive  Admittedly lunchtime suppose lesson learn if hungry better come outside lunch rush  <EOR> Decent quality fast food esque option Downtown Summerlin mall  Pita sandwiches kabob plates variety sides round menu along some kid options   Lamb kabobs tasty steak pita great combination flavors  vegetable couscous interesting higher quality expected but pita seemed pre made storebought  Dolmas didn't but tzatziki sauce served unright sour   Many reviews state service incredibly slow when first opened per Eater article tripled staff  Wait weekday afternoon just shy $15 six employees standing around no line ahead me  If your employees trained efficient don't need many  being said ones encountered polite but lot standing around going on  <EOR> A pretty good spot if mood some Mediterranean food Downtown Summerlin  location bright airy outdoor seating area well  Everything made order place your order you'll table number your meal brought you  All all took perhaps 10 minutes   The gyros served order fries which aren't really necessary remarkable  actually wished could order gyro separately fries cost $8 99  if option gyro only $6 50 would perfect!    large chunks meat feta cheese olives cucumber within  very tasty but careful those big meat chunks! Although tender enough almost choked because size   The restaurant itself pleasant but wasn't crazy fact bathrooms located right next trash cans small corridor 1 stall rest rooms  see busy times might quite line  also already showing signs use could better maintained   All all would return if day shopping  <EOR> Decent spot some quick Mediterranean food    Was pretty packed around 6 pm when in  Crowd started dispersing quickly though  food within 10 mins ordering    Got Crazy Pita Salad added chicken  Salad great size everything chopped small loaded cucumbers! Made very easy eat  However chicken skewer pretty overcooked charred dry  Didn't really care feta cheese either  sure kind use but your typical crumbly variety  mushy sticks together  very hard put your food if side  Overall everything decent    I love pita here  your typical whole wheat hard floury pita more fluffy white bread  Comes warm which really nice    Key lime pie amazing! Very very rich fluffy more mousse    Customer service really great  came quite few times ask meals take empty plates trash  <EOR> I hype place about   Quite mediocre food  lamb skewer overcooked even charred spots shrimp pita  All sides just you'd expect food court pita place    Definitely agree all those said overpriced is  <EOR> If follow blog Colorblind then know love place  reminds family dad's cooking  Everything fresh including hummus staff sweet! enjoy glass wine grilled deliciousness feel guilty! Unless eat all pita bread did  Definitely favorite places eat Las Vegas! <EOR> Lamb pita very good staff very nice but took over 20 minutes order  sure problem because they're fully staffed doesn't seem rush   I'll give another shot but wasn't great first experience <EOR> Yum! smell meet being grilled needs bottled sold cologne! staff great even when line door things seem track food amazing! love steak kabobs humus awesome too! Glad see close home! pita bread warm fresh! Going try some more things when back! Lunch always packed before 1150 am! <EOR> The food wasn't bad but incredibly slow service  took forever place order no line  probably won't back    can't stand slow service <EOR> Just love crazy pita  Whenever ask family where want eat crazy pita always top three choices  never problem customer service even when busy  everyone written semi negative absolutely negative review just another franchise chain restaurant eat microwaved food great customer service  am happy independent family owned restaurant opened downtown Summerlin  <EOR> For fast food joint place point! P favorite veggie pita fries  Very tasty  Super friendly attentive staff  Clean bright too  <EOR>
