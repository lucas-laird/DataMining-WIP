First time having Tsukemen Ramen really enjoyed it   asked server what's specialty kindly steered offering   basically combination seafood mackerel pork broth   Those shellfish allergy don't fret   You're good brAh!    The noodles soup served separate bowls but entirely if want marry them dipper   it   personally recommend being dipper because well   funner!  Food just taste better when tone right   Whatever choose don't fuck up  I'd hate watch enjoy your second serving!  On its own stock really dense but perfect when pair noodles   Try grab much noodles really pick intensity broth   Loads scallions thrown clump grains topped off 2 piece char siu lemon wedge single strip nori   soup served hot yet warmer warm   little squeeze lemon over noodles dish actually became quite refreshing way   Sodium overload?? Ain't nobody time that!  If you're fan soba zaru cold buckwheat noodles then think you'll really Tsukemen Ramen here   Seared Pork belly meaty delish!  Would order again   Gyoza however alright   +1 GOOD air circulation    *cliff* come acquiring stamp card?? <EOR> This ramen place did disappoint   ordered Tatsu deluxe ramen pleasantly surprised thickness charsiu also flavour broth base  also did skimp other ingredients   plenty bean sprouts green onion two pieces nori   only thing could improved give little bit more ramen bowl   Otherwise ramen quite delicious finished all soup which don't usually do   also tried fried rice but impressed it   flavourful enough presentation pretty   also quiet few dices pure fat it   recommendation stick ramen back more   give 3 5 stars  <EOR> I high hopes place    but left slightly disappointed   We'll start good decor simple clean lines few items looking forward future such karaage takoyaki!  love takoyaki if going tastes good might just stop itself char siu bowl   Now good tried Tatsu Ramen which tonkatsu broth 5 6 pieces char siu piece seaweed   felt everything little bland under seasoned   soup base tasted slightly watery could used just pinch salt bring flavor little better   think general consensus since heard elderly couple next actually tell waiter felt Miso Ramen needed salt   pork belly thicker cut similar Ramen Sora but marbled fat Monta's   However again pork lacked seasoning   also put ginger bowl instead having side   which dislike since ginger pretty overpowering personal preference   also option two different types noodles thick thin     I ordered thick noodles felt little soggy already time started eating    So unfortunately point returning old stomping grounds Monta Ramen Sora  <EOR> Decent ramen place good portions  also think price right  Tonkasu Ramen egg  Taste right  Also fried rice  I'd definitely return place  <EOR> Man bowl looks good when comes out  But broth bland meat just over salted nothing else good  don't think its good thing when try fill bowl chili oil soy sauce flavor   Service fast friendly but food lacking   Monta Fukumimi better choices  <EOR> I'm pretty satisfied Ramen Tatsu   Good crispy flavorful gyozas   shoyu ramen spicy miso also tried a spoonful Tonkotsu Shio   favorite shoyu flavor more subtle salty   Noodles al dente according waiters fresh made daily some place California   If compare other Vegas notorious ramen place feel Monta's broth become diluted salty me  But Ramen Tatsu does feel lot Monta if fact chef seems old Monta   cut pork thicker less marbled fat which like   Good very friendly service   Pleasant space sit down enjoy dinner maybe much style fast food bustling traditional Japanese ramen but enjoying beers while eat don't mind lack authenticity   Also plus there's never much wait but new place   coming back Ramen Tatsu ramen fix  <EOR> I hate being hater but 2 star experience   can't compete big boys down street     My wife tonkotsu ramen while broth decent gave thin noodles which she didn't all   server didn't even offer choice thick noodles deluxe way better   deluxe definitely wasn't skimpy ingredients but broth bland charsiu just OK   would ordered deluxe tonkotsu ramen shoyu soy sauce if could again     What's no music restaurant?  felt eating ramen library   Is 3 stars new 2 stars?  Even 3 star reviews telling readers elsewhere  <EOR> I really enjoyed tonkatsu Ramen Tatsu  generous ingredients tonkatsu creamy savory without overpowering saltiness some other ramen places serve  man when bowl ramen arrives just gorgeous  Picture perfect all asians love document meals  chashu pork although very flavorful still pretty tasty  second visit idea order seared chashu add ramen  Yummy! should totally option toppings  noodles thinner tonkatsu but didn't mind it  probably request thicker noodles  nice plus refill noodles kaedama only $1 50   The restaurant still pretty new awkward ambience place just starting menu seems work progress  Would love see place well amidst growing number ramen shops around town  <EOR> I opened great  noodles some best I'd thin pho noodles but ramen recipe   Today garbage  noodles just average chashu funny taste  won't back  <EOR> Stopped twice wasn't necessarily wowed  first time ordered tonkotsu ramen bf ordered spicy miso ramen  While he enjoyed meal thought mine much desired  chashu bit chewy tough lacked flavor while tonkotsu broth appeared creamy didn't really taste rich  somewhat reminiscent Anime Ramen's tonkotsu thats no compliment  thin noodles egg fine nothing bad say   The second time visited both ordered plain miso ramen  broth very tangy tasted rather thin  thicker curlier noodles served harder not cooked long enough? would've enjoyed  chashu again disappointing    The service good just two waiters standing towards back watching second anyone needed anything seeing recently opened feel bit bad giving them three stars  think they'll steady business regardless however since they're strip mall also karaoke place Cue D's  <EOR> The fried rice restaurant very tasty love highly recommend it     also ordered tonkotsu ramen broth rich ramen perfectly cooked but pork tender enough  <EOR> I've tried place twice August    yes review overdue now currently closed site maintenance!   I actually liked place   tonkatsu broth tasty ramen cooked al dente  bad side only two pieces pork left still feeling hungry   guess must starving just need side extra noodles   Overall liked Tatsu ramen hoping reopen soon  minimum credit cards bring cash if your only ordering bowl! <EOR>
