Replacing classic Cafe Cortez Siegel's 1941 El Cortez's attempt modernizing things otherwise vintage Old Vegas hotel   menu boasts good assortment appealing options including tasty Bugsy Burgers I mine fried egg cheddar nice salads   coffee way more bitter would like   Our experience service however terrible   waitress Luba completely inept   She little knowledge menu possesses poor table side manners   The kitchen which took some time food half order wrong   burger came just fine but girlfriend's salad came noodle dish    even close she very much happy   We're Las Vegas locals would come
