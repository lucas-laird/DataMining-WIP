Apparently side Park Fremont   So dying vine but still enough hope vitality walk inside then back garden back rather just walk which option tossed around then tad dah    a little quixotic haven came into sight    The ambiance think Alice Wonderland acid own show HGTV   Flowers statues vintage plates metal furniture picture horses copulating freakish wallpaper totally awesome!  The service thank Andera listening bemoan previous shunning finding answers all questions turning whole service experience around awesome well!

The reason am giving them 2 stars because Bloody Mary delish!   Our waitress rude didn't even want tip her place very slow expected little more service  didn't realize time just opened but still doesn't explain fact waitress bad mannered  When tried speaking other waitress's all same way maybe prerequisite work there?  1 star for Atmosphere location wonderful fun!  1 star for bloody Mary  0 stars for Staff everything else  <EOR> I've Park two times since opened  first time amazing weather nice since around 7pm  Ambiance amazing quaint really want place well why writing review    The second time around 12 30pm asked sit back patio  mistake because sun blazing hot no umbrellas fans misters  even summer yet outside miserably fail if something isn't done change that  everyone moving tables switching spots avoid sun    Which brings another problem Park probably won't able fix easily     patio side against alley where all trash surrounding bars dumped  sun smell horrible felt going throw don't know they're going fix issue  But can't expect serve food people when they're smelling rotting trash  Revolting    Then ordered Mac n cheese Philly bar chicken bites    But took 55 minutes food come 45 minutes anyone realize issue order  manager never stopped apologize end meal removed item bill    I've worked hospitality industry over ten years  know all waitresses fault however managers need more aware what's going restaurant  I saw them dealing contractors assuming preoccupied   regardless your kitchen food out! servers need aware surroundings girl passed literally ten times already waiting food 30+ minutes she asked if anyone taken order yet    I want place well badly hoping review used fix problems future     One star previous positive experience no stars remaining issues  <EOR> I'm excited all downtown hype  super cute yet butch here  love art drinks food above average but amazing  <EOR> A welcome addition Fremont East  came some friends town show them locals scene  never yet hoping place wouldn't disappoint  didn't   I ordered Unicorn which signature cocktails made Ketel Citron Vodka lemon juice simple syrup mint ginger beer lemon wedge  I'd definitely again  Next time try some other signature cocktails but very least know rely Unicorn fulfill needs  prices fair  bartender attentive friendly   The space very cozy but good use little footprint have  sure check outdoor patio back  If weren't aware would easy even realize exists  You'd missing if didn't  <EOR> Adorable !!!! Super eclectic inside  Great patio seating  Must see patio back  <EOR> Go see seen hang patio  course hanging patio done best cold adult beverage also drink    I twice reason second visit honestly wasn't because just some fabulous dish again because pals live downtown hanging patio jealous  knew probably going miss something like Tony Hsieh delivering happiness person Jesus Jam Band corner Fremont Las Vegas Blvd if didn't go  therefore did miss those things both which actually happened    The patio offering Park Fremont without doubt class luxury  sit front watch Fremont Street all its glory head back Secret Garden experience  Both options time place  Try both    As drink offerings am excited see offer variations Bloody Mary! Granted haven't tried them but think art form don't enough Vegas  also nice beer list but mostly cans bottles first visit didn't 30% list  think because still soft opening mode won't hold against them    As food bit underwhelming  Portion sizes small although menu list delicious potential dishes just little bit less hoped size presentation  Everything tried tastes good appreciate variety options including vegetarian just fact food!  So don't think would starved foodie at least yet but night downtown definitely happening spot your drink patio on  <EOR> I love patio saddens give Park Fremont such low rating     We came lunch middle week 11 30  wasn't overly busy   seated immediately   five minutes waitress took orders drinks ordered water friend ordered coke    took least fifteen minutes drinks   Thanks checking shortly placing drink order know exaggerating   When waitress brought drinks she brought friend wrong drink   sat another ten minutes without coke   saw waitress walk empty tray didn't acknowledge come back take food orders   Since limited time leave   I suggest sitting bar if you're hurry limited time maybe service faster better  <EOR> Cool place  Hasn't around long going off initial visit giving good review  Back patio area very cool almost feel you're downtown Las Vegas which something anyone appreciate  drinks great well  Try Unicorn kind tastes mikes hard  Guys sounds sissy but trust 2 3 those you'll there  use Ketel which happens favorite vodka  Haven't tried food yet but  nice thing offer considering other bars don't food  <EOR> Great atmosphere  Great brew collection  Great food prices  Nice see bartenders servers tastefully dressed Vegas well  Service friendly courteous  Apparently bring children sit outside part Fremont before 6 30pm  Decor inside great atmosphere fair priced meal grab drinks  Ill back sure! <EOR> Not your standard downtown Fremont DTF east bar!  gastropub bar restaurant    sits northeast corner Fremont Las Vegas Blvd   three different sections Park Fremont front patio inside back patio     The front patio perfect people watching   Especially night when see all craziness happen Fremont street   inside tables bars your standard restaurant setting   Then back patio which more intimate setting   back patio also secret pathway far back left corner which when walk around corner seesaw    also designated smoking area   Which area would recommend?  back patio  where met some random cool people   front patio also nice but haven't able mingle people much back patio   bar inside Park Fremont your standard restaurant setting     I don't care much food   If eat I'd reuben tots   But coworkers long nights work love coming down beer two   just down list try something new every night join them   selections different beers brings least twice week   Park Fremont turned into soggy man sandwich! <EOR> Simply best place grab bite downtown   menu funky unique mention bloody marys die for! <EOR> Cool spot front end Fremont East     I love Fremont East most part  often find down any given night Le Thai Griffin even Commonwealth when resistances high   haha   PARK FREMONT nice addition mix   though still feel though leaves bit desired   The highlight establishment back courtyard fireplace greenery resembles something combination Secret Garden meets Alice Wonderland  Ample seating fireplace when gets bit chilled there    The service good enough most people very cool   but wasn't overly stoked food food prices  most likely give another sure wasn't random situation   but am really rushing back food  beer selection good enough also some descent cocktails including something 4 different types bloody mary's   A OK   <EOR> I'm willing give place second chance   lot potential snazzy rustic bar resto   reason am giving Park Fremont three stars because service SUPER LOUD MUSIC garden     8 30pm Friday night When restaurant told hostess needed table two   She started guiding table outside facing Fremont Street asked if table available back garden   She told if wanted take seat front she would come once table ready garden     Twenty minutes hostess girl long straight two toned hair nowhere found   Seems though she break forgot us   guest done first round drinks decided new hostess ask if table available back   new hostess apologized coworker forgotten then walked into back garden where several open seats why weren't given seat garden initially mystery me     The garden exactly imagined be   wouldn't recommend taking older folks since music LOUD some chairs slightly uncomfortable     I wish more apps menu   would nice order few sides rather large meal   fries etc but nothing healthy   ended ordering veggie sliders which delicious   buns stale but veggie patty itself delicious!  guest corn flake crusted chicken he LOVED IT!

My two gal pals ordered small chocolate cheesecake dessert came shot glass  stuff super rich super sweet super delish  Don't let size fool bigger always better    From hear food so so  But ambiance drinks awesome food no food coming back near future  <EOR> You gotta love places Park Fremont because trying do Revamp area cool once cool  give them mad respect just fact   Owned same folks own Commonwealth nifty little place all right elements stand contender amongst other places popping Downtown  open very long might more stars later update if things change  But sits right now would say come patio stay unique beer choices  The front back patios both great but each different vibe  back more chill bigger prettier  smoking area see saw cool plants flowers all over place  nice little reprieve craziness Fremont St   Ambiance inside really cool trendy artsy sort vibe  front patio louder more people milling watch all Fremont Freaks Geeks wave crazy flag proudly! hatin' them!  The beer list pretty extensive smaller place this  everything Coors Mickey's Malt Liquor Young's Double Chocolate Stout Lost Coast Sacramento Blonde  Honestly almost start wishing sold beer flights could try little bit everything   There cool beer shot combo option drink menu which always seems fun concept if sort thing   One element enthralled food  Sweet Potato Teeter Tots really funky but good way! sweet mustard dipping sauce include 'em really adds extra yum factor   But few dishes tried just sorta ok  first time visited tried order Grilled Cheese Brioche which sounded die for  86'ed which fine because grand opening week just soft open right before run bunch things  big deal  next time Instead tried Philly Mac Cheese Steak which pretty tasty    But second time visited sad see taken grilled cheese off entirely!! Sad sad day  chose Veggie Wrap which came tortilla type casing   It just Eh  Kinda greasy which sometimes good but case  enough melted cheese enough feta crumbles  Plus veggies kinda wet     Overall little hit and miss food here  confident more likely better over time  Maybe just being picky perhaps ordered wrong things  Only time more visits tell   But still come here! Sit patio! Especially front  If lady couple creepy homeless dudes mackin' you  prepared  don't keep your phone wallet side table closest fence because someone could just run grab it  nice thing security guy standing front just case  <EOR> If Urban Outfitters opened restaurant Park Fremont would it  really felt stepped into Urban Outfitters catalog once walked through bar onto patio dining area its strung outdoor patio lighting mounted wall plates probably thrifted various pairs shoes hung wire indicate street pharmacist just around corner    FOOD Veggie Sliders Sweet Potato Teeter Tots Veggie Sliders bland   No flavor whatsoever  thin layer looked mayonnaise but its flavor wasn't detectable all  yellow sweet sauce used dipping tots into didn't help  even requested some mustard slather onto mini meatless patties  Again no flavor  concocted mixture consisting both sweet sauce mustard  Still no flavor  sliders need own special sauce more seasonings because beyond dull    The Sweet Potato Teeter Tots tasted similar churros  sweet little crunchy  Its accompanying sauce unnecessary    SERVICE Our waitress did good job checking often  Though she seemed exhibit hesitance requested mustard sliders    OTHER The patio lovely whole feeling outdoor urban dining  BUT wouldn't suggest dining there  stench sewage garbage tainted air wafted into direction  point employees lit stick incense which wasn't strong enough mask overpowering odors   OVERALL This place probably more suitable grabbing drinks bite eat but can't imagine ever making return visit even just drink  <EOR> What thought would amazing experience happy hour turned into rather mediocre dining experience complete garbage truck sewage smell  entire experience pretty much ruined known stench would continually waft over party while ate definitely would chosen seat outside   But ah! name Park Fremont incredibly tack full back patio place also course!
