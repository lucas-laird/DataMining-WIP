Overall wasn't worth it   food most part mediocre my friend told One Eyed Jack bad bread hard inedible prices high   If want just say then go   Otherwise avoid it   bunch great buffets Wynn! hit Vegas  <EOR> frrozen hot chocolate = overpriced frappaccino without coffee  it's didn't enjoy just didn't understand why $8 25 smaller portion why didn't blow mind <EOR> I'd come dessert again though maybe food  During LV vacay friends last week came sizable group chance try several items menu   dessert  frozen hot chocolate  waiter told 14 different kinds chocolate grind into powder then mixed hot water served shaved ice  honest don't think really different if made home w regular hot choco mix  hefty price tag $10 LV status   frozen strawberry item  strawberry version frozen hot chocolate above it    though again price steep   brownie sundae w 2 scoops ice cream  forgot name item but brownies really awesome though sweeter side  liked it     ^_^  food pizza  thin crust another food item forgot food avg worth $$$ opinion    conclusion if ever walk around again hot summer day I'd come strawberry hot chocolate frozen dessert      Oh sundae item menu $77!!!!!  another boxed item $10 000 maybe joke  =  golden sundae! <EOR> This review default getting 2 stars   Frozen Hot Chocolate should 3 4 stars but can't it   Must warn people horrible service here    least outdoor patio   sort Labor Day weekend   But seriously should NEVER take 15 minutes glass water   When its 95 outside seriously should try keep your customers happy   guess want any repeat business   I believe table sat next left middle lunch because service  Easy leave place w o paying which kind felt doing  Sundae order came super melted all over place   ate few bites FHC shared good but die thinking might be  Maybe expectations high  Oh put moderate pricing if share    would say more pricey side if your eating your own meal w drinks     May try FHC @ window again but definitely dining restaurant again ever! many other places Vegas no reason bad service twice  <EOR> The frozen hot chocolate okay  Its chocolate milk frappuccino whipped cream shaved chocolate top  would buy again but only if real sweet tooth moment mean $9 drink  Its worth trying guess  BEST drink but just okay  <EOR> I'm only giving location 3 stars only because gave NY location 4 stars review earlier I'm partial original!!!    believe Frozen Hot Chocolate general gets 4 stars   maybe even 5 stars since few years since fell love birthplace!  Didn't meal but did see few dishes looked really good like foot long steak eggs sandwich which served open face WOW!    Looked over menu little different NY offer   also noticed some desserts weren't offered chocolate fondue fruit platter   Only time Frozen Hot Chocolate which slurped bar   would definitely time lunch next visit   Ideal location   sits right corner front Caesar's Palace   can't miss strip   looks bigger NY location but only facade   there's small floor indoor dining then patio  same size   Serendipity full bar   but Vegas restaurant Vegas doesn't serve liquor might well closed down build does! decor very diner esque   nothing NY except light fixtures resemble Tiffany lamps   One last thing different   there's walk window where order to go items   pretty cool if just want Frozen Hot Chocolate sip while losing all your $$$ slot machines!!! <EOR> We few days ago amazing    4 no trouble finding table    ordered buffet sandwich which ok really massively large   wife brie open faced sandwich which again excellent included stuffing cranberry mayo    friends ordered Caesar salad which also large massive croutons    other friend ordered turkey club which incredibly massive!

Now would think would toss new correct one   did instead?  fudged wrong drink adding some elements juice whatever look guest ordered   know all this?  Because actually conversed loudly enough hear it   I thought giving 1 star but just original sake am giving 2  <EOR> So saw Serendipity 3 Las Vegas   Never made NYC nor saw movie but since everyone rants thought would try Frozen Hot Chocolate   window   Wasn't spectacular thought going be   Tasted someone took fudgesicle blended it   Meh  <EOR> Got much ballyhooed frozen hot chocolate take out window   $8 89 including tax small definitely nothing impressive   Tasted standard chocolate dessert could any decent ice cream place  <EOR> The highlight last Las Vegas trip great place those hot Vegas days   think if come frozen hot chocolate course but other items very good although probably did OD sweetness   isn't cheap but portions huge definitely could share most items   think environment fun although bit wait staff seemed bit distracted   definitely back nonetheless  <EOR> If you've NY check Vegas right? walked order window outside just wanted chocolate milkshake told inside order bar  kid 4 guys bar yes busy but bothered acknowledge anyone wanted order right you  looked menu see kind shakes had  $9 50 Milkshake  thought hey if going drink should alcohol  ordered Cosmo $16 70!! insane  Everyone pissed walking more people coming gave them heads service sucks you'll waiting long time  plenty time talk those waiting  warned them since wasn't going leave until finished last drop drink! <EOR> um    hmmm     maybe looking forward much  I expected something world  I mean good    sweet  hmmm    tasted exactly fudge popsicle through blender    hmm   yep  <EOR> 2 stars unbearably poor service  3 stars food dessert   But overall comparison NYC 2 stars all give this   I expected more Serendipity   Perhaps comparing much New York intimate quaint cute   Serendipity definitely cute dainty aesthetics but service definitely does live fabulous outside   Same delicious signature frrroooozen hot chocolate fun enjoy hot day while people watching patio overlooking Strip   Food good pay presentation more taste it   We came Sunday around 11 am   didn't seated until 11 35   Once seated took 15 minutes waiter take order   Then another 30 minutes food way table into stomachs   much time wasted just quick bite eat      I think reason why such GINORMOUS menus occupy your attention  while take sweet time getting your order out     Desserts fab but really worth wait   Even if order take side which attempted next weekend    banana split took 20 minutes!!    definitely need work service   if want uphold essence NYC Serendipity might want steer away playing hip hop music   really doesn't jive cute dainty atmosphere   Best part restaurant?  Probably photo ops larger life Frrroozennnn Hot Chocolate outside restaurant quite manifestation  <EOR> I think many hype overshadowed actually tasted like  decided window instead waiting even though open tables when but 25 minute wait    uhhhh okay? 32oz frozzen hot chocolate 14 bucks  Yeah  bit pricey side! certainly delicious but obviously splurge     overpriced hot dog because probably only thing cheapest  least bun toasted  Eh  I'd rather hot dog soda Costco  least better tasting save myself 4 bucks! Oh another thing charge dollar water which isn't much cup  better off pretending gamble getting free bottle water Caesar's Palace!   So essence cuz need quick bite can't wait to window   But worth price  <EOR> Service whack  called advance reservation 730pm group 10   just 7 30 told hostess reservation   She basically told no reservation made 7 30 name wasn't wait  told just called hour ago if theres anyone else would've answered phone she asked know spoke to? said no   she basically said theres nothing then wait  Gosh BEEZZYYY  Luckily another girl came asked what's goin she happened took reservation over phone she seated  Great communication between those employees!! Yea right    seated took forever server greet us   took forever server take orders   took forevermore food  Then never saw server again      Food OK  nobody seemed crazy food  some even didn't it  frozen hot chocolate good  kinda wish i'd ordered dessert before food might've more worth food? Overall pretty let down place really hoping would better   Highly doubt i'd come back    If it'll probably just dessert  <EOR> If weren't movie Serendipity would never walked into place   but watched it   thus try Frozen Hot Chocolate!  I Frozen Hot Chocolate $8 50  It came large goblet unhealthy but delightfully large dallop fresh whipped cream  YUM! drank fast brain freeeeeze  Worth because where else FROZEN hot chocolate? woulda thunk it?  I also tried spinach artichoke dip hot dog  Nothing special those dishes  I'd definitely come again dessert though  <EOR> We enjoyed Frrrozen Hot Chocolate Marguerite Pizza   wife considered Frrrozen Hot Chocolate delicious even all chocolate rich food indulged LV   Since craving pizza ordered Marguerite Pizza thin soft crust sweet tomato sauce mozzarella basil good best had   If looking tart alcoholic drink then highly recommend Madras Mojito served  real cranberries crushed mint leaves   best Mojito since Fronterra Grill Chicago     Seating hostess attentive however waitress fantastic tipped extra     This plus lot fun just hang patio relax gaze Caesars Palace left Las Vegas Blvd right  <EOR> Upon reading other reviews slighty scared even everyone made seem service sucked wasn't worth it  never NYC but decided Vegas    The host staff slighty unattentive when walked she talking someone walkie didn't bother moments silence say well right you  But pager and We sat 10 minutes    The décor adorable sat outside patio  friend ordered waters root beer float strawberry shake both DIE FOR  unlike someone else stated weren't charged $1 water    I ordered Hangover omelet  weird sounds could use less egg  But good bacon little peppery    My friend cheeseburger  She loved it!! best thing all waffle cut fries!!!!  Bill $42 which bad! waiter pretty attentive nice  Didn't take much waiting all  def again!    OH decided back night dessert!! it fantastic!!!!!!  Strawberry Fields Chocolate cake it heaven!!! <EOR> Came brunch JT when Bouchon informed would 45 minute wait he decided he extremely hungry and slightly hung over   shared chopped chicken salad standard but hearts palm good short rib pot pie decadent 11am but still good     course order frozen hot chocolate I NY but JT never tried it   refreshing 95 degree weather esp since hit pool right   portion ginormous especially other generous sized items   Service decent but still quite early people Vegas though almost noon  sat outside shaded area open doors A C blowing wasn't hot  $1000 ice cream sundae menu gold flakes  always intrigued but don't think I'd ever ever able spend much sundae! Love giant hot chocolate statues outside too  <EOR> I need preface bad review because only thing wasn't even Frozen Hot Chocolate  I'd thought I'd yelp anyway help ambiance because may visions new york serendipity shown movies reality shows etc  After getting into Vegas hit place  9pm really mood thing  shareable drink    We Forbidden Broadway Sundae which consisted chocolate Blackout cake ice cream hot fudge topped whipped cream  cake really thick brick thick think needed more vanilla ice cream  If just she said mom sister nieces lunch shared mac cheese blt frozen hot chocolate thought servings HUGE  No kids menu share   sister felt water g ross   As far service little waitress girl attentive enough though heard table yell few times  served someone else no napkins which gets gooey awhile    I'll back frozen hot choc   Also window outside where order eat out   but heat eat drink fast before your ice cream melts  And   kinda weird seeing pre clubbers mini dresses down tons food    but hey work out  <EOR> I think there's lot hype around place might reason why only though meh  pizza friend pot pie both mediocre nothing really special  dessert Frozen Hot Chocolate  something try since specialty but probably would never again  good but big enough couple sips  <EOR>
