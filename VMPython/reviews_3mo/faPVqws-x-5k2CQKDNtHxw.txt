see girls brunch once month always lookout something new exciting  showed 11am Sunday per website opening time   looked open some time asked rather rude hostess if reservations  don't normally consider making brunch reservations many places around valley don't even offer brunch reservations  advised didn't she let know fully committed until 11 45  asked if could sit empty bar she advised again fully committed  OK ask if waiting list she advised just come back 11 45 walked away  then occurred would probably turned away again back spoke much nicer hostess took name number advised she would call if anything earlier    We finally seated 11 45 table empty least 15 minutes  When seated noticed actually lot empty tables guess little exclusive meaning wait least 30 minutes seated even if restaurant empty  restaurant itself absolutely adorable  loved rustic Southern decor really cool lighting fixtures  front portion restaurant porch parlor feel couches arm chairs  Then blends into communal tables finally some general restaurant tables  personally think parlor area waste space nobody wants eat arm chairs tiny tables  should consider making more tables since such long wait    We seated high top table behind communal tables surprised small table since most dishes serve 2 4 people  ordered few items split between 3 barely room table  started Blackberry Bourbon lemonade which definitely heavy pour bar always good thing  also enjoyed $11 mimosa which apparently only weekends    We did enjoy food mama's chicken biscuits really tasty but way much biscuit  especially fond house made pickles perfectly balanced  mac cheese weird orange color but super tasty could eaten myself  eggs ham fine ham tasty grits OK but nothing special  also ordered corn bread but never made table  waitress less apologetic but decided would just switch cinnamon apple hand pies  only 2 little math but split them enjoyed them  really liked them although could bit more apple flavor    Overall food pretty good but price  menu suggests sharing but portions little small side  service also wasn't great few questions server told she would ask but never came back answers  really decor food wish would lower prices least offer locals discount  seems catering done tourist crowd  definitely won't brunch rotation  <EOR> I visited few times during event having called Premiere Weekend  first event mixer drinks DJ QuestLove spinning tunes some favorite dishes being passed around  even red carpet photo booth  second event following day pre fixe menu brunch   The samples food tried square watermelon fried chicken biscuit sandwich spicy honey sauce fried chicken piece waffle maple syrup fried green tomato thick cut bacon top plus greens vinaigrette drizzle few deviled eggs   Brunch next morning sampling fruit parfait granola yogurt fried green tomato tapas thick cut bacon generous amount chunky spicy chipotle sauce eggs benedict bacon biscuit crumble covered eggs over easy hollandaise sauce  Finally chocolate coffee cake delivered dessert   The fruit parfait included generous amount fruit granola yogurt which all tasty  fried green tomato nice crispy  bacon top good greens  However chunky chipotle sauce overwhelming needed otherwise well executed dish  found eggs benedict spot southern style coming through bacon biscuit crumble  would liked more bacon yum  haven't many coffee cakes dessert but plating looking very cool chocolate sauce sprig mint well placed blackberry  cake itself marbled  wasn't moist but could coffee cakes are? cake hardness scale between angel food scone hardness coffee cake closer scone   I'd back again brunch see new dishes chef creates  favorite samples tried first night fried chicken waffle  <EOR> Such cool place!

Thank Yardbird such wonderful experience! <EOR> 3 1 2 stars  Arrived Wednesday evening dinner  bar packed due convention just ended but lucked seated dining room without reservation    My friendly waitress advised establishment another location Miami  interior decor hip chic lounge bar area really trendy looking  Being fried chicken fan Lewellyn's fried chicken $26 00 1 2 free range chicken marinated 27 hours served spicy tabasco honey sauce  Instead ordering full order biscuits waitress said she could just order which perfect order Charred Okra  Overall thought food decent tasty but southern states enjoyed good if better fried chicken less money  Again would expect being Las Vegas? service waitress solid music playing background hip older rock   Overall thought food decent but pricey! <EOR> The overwhelming character place made great dining experience group  ate family style recommended server  food fantastic  If you're Bourbon lover which place you  must admit however Blackberry Lemonade almost turned into lover Bourbon! Pricey but worth it  <EOR> Very cool bar  Decent selection craft beer bourbon  try Mac cheese fried chicken  If your Venetian looking good spot hang drink     your place  <EOR> I excited try place given reviews saw yelp say disappointed food    My girlfriends ordered Mac Cheese  Corn Bread  Fried Green Tomatoes Pimento  Maple Bacon Donut course Fried Chicken The Mac cheese nothing spectacular always order Mac cheese try every resturant to  top places Table 34 Yard House! Yumm yumm  The Corn Bread real corn kernels inside bread lime zest whipped butter  Kernels rubbery  Didn't taste fresh   Fried green tomatoes pimento bacon need some acidity plate  added squeeze lemon wedge tasted better   The Maple Bacon Donut ohh sad   Doughy enough glaze bacon whole donut  all bite left other half  should 3 mini donuts instead large one   I saved best last! Fried Chicken definitely Star Menu order  Juicy great flavor breading! yummy!! <EOR> You know once your parents know trend then pretty much no longer trend?  pretty much vibe place  Now don't wrong sucker interesting craft cocktail Anthropologie Restoration Hardware style decor def thing however restaurant felt last minute jump hipster train  excited visit place until second walked in  loud football playing every television  douchey bro types screaming tv taking almost every inch space  seated quickly nice hostess appeared only employee knew smile ordered drink waiter seemed over did  drink ok but downed asked check deciding bother ordering food since couldn't even hear each other speak  opinion should opt playing some quality music compliment seemed very quality menu  sad didn't try it  But guess Vegas quantity customers quality  <EOR> Get yourself down your friends few bourbon cocktails order fried green tomato BLT Butter Lettuce Grilled Mango Salad Fried Chicken Shrimp Grits Buttermilk Biscuits   Then another cocktail you'll room dessert drift back into masses Las Vegas Blvd  <EOR> I came high expectations reading reviews both location original Miami  left sorely disappointed    During slow lunch service ordered Mama's Chicken Biscuits Crunchy Yardbird Sandwich Mac Cheese   As far chicken biscuits actual biscuits wonderful buttery fluffy  exactly biscuit should be  pickles gross  never liked sweet sour pickles surprise popped mouth  We opted order biscuits without pepper jelly     The chicken very weird  almost if staff takes piece white meat piece dark meat sticks together before battering frying  am big dark meat happy it  could only take few bites before decided really just wasn't worth calories did enjoy it  give chefs juicy    The Crunchy Yardbird Sandwich mayo more yucky pickled vegetables  listed menu would preferred head's items them  bacon much bacon pork belly  hot sauce definitely same honey hot sauce other items  Again they're adding sweetness where would really prefer left out    The Mac Cheese okay  bad but better why come restaurant something better?   The food also fairly pricey  Especially because left feeling calories could spent better elsewhere   The decor service top notch  only environment warm welcoming but staff attentive par fine dining restaurant  But ultimately don't come restaurant service atmosphere  <EOR> Ten lunch  sat long table cool front lounge  ordered ton food share  E V E R Y T H N G delicious! Some highlights were deviled egg towers chicken liver toast smoky shrimp grits Elvis pancakes fresh hot maple bacon donut chicken biscuit slow roasted chicken salad brisket sandwiches bloody marys bacon  more but those all favorites  NO ANY complaints! <EOR> The decor really wonderful  Think classic rustic beautiful modern twist  It scene movie ambiance perfect  think would great spot drinks they mentioned might add live band which would added bonus!
