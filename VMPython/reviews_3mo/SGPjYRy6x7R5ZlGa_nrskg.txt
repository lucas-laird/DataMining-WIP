Breakfast pizza cool but tasted simple  I would rather hop <EOR> Bait Switch Illegal My family ate lunch today 5 25 2012   server Karen   We interested trying place because promotion Kids Eat Free M F until 2pm dining adult  all says dining adult  each pizza when bill charged $6 son's meal   When asked why Karen told pizza didn't count entree   told signs all say dining adult no stipulations   She refused budge   She also refused give receipt   After leaving called speak manager since still upset   manager Kristina Christina? kept repeating adult entree  kept telling all signs said dining adult which would myself husband why would pizza entree?

Was given no choice inside outside seating  Sat outside no wind break everything flying everywhere  No manager came check saw server four times once drinks once refill 30 minutes once food once check    Strip prices dorm room quality food  Skip skip skip ANYWHERE else Town Square  Yardhouse fantastic  Claim Jumper very good  Brio happy hour excellent  place? Crap  Avoid  <EOR> Stopped movie  never crazy Cadillac Ranch but since taken over Ranch House thought we'd give try  Being beautiful  night sat outside  waiter excellent  haven't such good service long time  food other hand excellent  Very typical bar food  little more greasy most bars though  definitely  say won't stopping back anytime soon especially Yard House just below   I truely hope waiter finds better job more suited talents   <EOR> The food totally different now before Cadillac Ranch   loved idea Cole slaw topped pop rocks mac n cheese topped Doritos toasted sweet potato melt  love indoor outdoor seating  drinks good servers friendly  only drawback personally 9 pm Ranch House Kitchen tries become nightclub loud music   know very few country western places town but would love find place eat drink fun 9 pm without loud music  <EOR> My boyfriend friend Saturday night  read change Cadillac Ranch thought worth shot  felt pretty meh Cadillac Ranch try new places  Another friend mine referred place the place where stand outside beg come in  There's reason beg people come would soon find out  did option outside inside seating chose inside booth    It 10ish minutes before someone came ask if wanted drinks  She said switching sections gave benefit doubt but seeing staff socializing drinking while wait even if due section switch just more annoyed frustrated  server actually quite friendly attentive  She tried tell happy hour but she wasn't sure when began ended  whole conversation gave impression there's lack continuity training staff  needed minute decide she brought drinks reasonable time  ordered cucumber mojito which delicious  pretty much highlight meal though   Our food seemed take long time although sure exactly time frame was  could frustrated experience already point  When finally arrived meh  boyfriend ordered firecracker coleslaw which first he thought Rice Krispies account crackling sound  He soon deduced actually pop rocks  no description coleslaw he assumed firecracker referred spicy flavor rather sound makes  While they're trying really seemed crappy dish made ingredients Food Network show Chopped  He said burger tasted Burger King burger Ranch House's crappy chili it  sliders roasted jalepeños garlic salsa  garlic salsa mean marinara sauce  green beans mine which tasted waived over hot water  crunchier should practically raw  friend's meal meh  Underwhelming say least  attempt redeem meal wanted order sweet potato melt only informed sweet potatoes  point threw hands decided place I'd rather return to  suspect won't around long   I thought end until woke sick morning  didn't anything else meal spending day nursing digestive system  would advise against place whole heartedly which unusual me  generally give places least 2 visits before review  Ranch House bad though never back  <EOR> Let begin review saying 1 star basically management handling situation myself niece few nights ago when dined before going see movie  never eaten before did indeed check reviews before entering place but threw caution wind because less wait time Yard House  Oh boy  where wrong   The hostesses pleasant wait really bad  But then sat strange booth completely separate dining room side bar but part bar because railing between bar    I'm going completely document experience but am going highlight few more deplorable offenses  waiter sniffed drink sure Dr  Pepper  WTF moment number 1  ordered pretty simple dishes because indeed going see movie  niece ordered BLT Doritos Mac Cheese side dish  ordered half house salad Loaded Baked Potatoes Pulled Pork  then proceeded wait 45 minutes before waiter arrived table tell big party taking kitchen meals would very soon   missed movie  Luckily another showing hour later   Next waited again food  During time manager came apologized comped meal gave free dessert   The meal finally arrived  brought incorrect sandwich niece  She ordered BLT turkey club  She wipe all turkey off it  salad poor excuse salad tiny witherlings shaved carrots  loaded baked potatoes okay but drizzling sauces put all over thing  Doritos Mac Cheese seriously worst things eaten entire life  niece both agreed would wretch right table if another bite   We then awaited cookie minus ice cream could take go  waited waited waited  server arrived inform still being cooked we already late SECOND MOVIE SHOWING   decided leave walked door  waiter running met door movie theater give absolutely cold disgusting cookie   Sad excuse place  last  <EOR> So  really sure where begin     I know place formerly Cadillac Ranch never under previous management  am sure if means am disadvantage nothing comparison benefit being unbiased   We Ranch House Kitchen Monday night seeing movie Rave Theaters   Yardhouse dinner wanted check something different post movie drinks   walking somewhat awkwardly greeted Ranch House hostess 10 feet outside restaurant   She VERY nice but weird spot greeted   Going into restaurant looked great place  HUGE probably big but looked should place successful clearly put lot money into it   Sadly     just only customers joint   walked past mechanical bull bit surprised see girl no more 8 sitting it   strange say least   We finally table quickly noticed employees outnumbered guests least 4 1   first round drinks came pretty slowly friend said margarita awful  ordered wings next beers standard bar wings  bad but certainly nothing would bring back   We two waitresses evidently training   clear girl awhile very interested us   girl training much more attentive spent some time talking table which suppose expected them since place basically empty   Overall sort strange experience   beer cold wings hot but nothing would want back Ranch House Kitchen   REPORTEDLY draw customers most nights but believe when see it   Just sure why anyone would Ranch House when pop down Yardhouse where MUCH bigger beer selection  <EOR> Food terrible  chicken sliders sweet potato tots  service slow only made rare appearances  pretty sure would enjoyed meal McDonalds more restaurant  only bonus most waitresses cute  <EOR> Been few times

Nice touch generally   Menu pretty wide breakfast thru dinner most everything western type twist normal American foods  Alot  sandwiches pizzas salads all twist   Full bar service tables stand alone bar  Plus bigtime mechanical bull when think wanna show got  recommended eating Prices medium reasonable get  alot lunch specials other promotions always going   Worth stop try if want something just
