successful spot already located downtown Lola's Louisiana Kitchen Summerlin opened without much fanfare amidst hubbub surrounding 'new' Downtown but mall mobbed crowds short drive Town Center Drive found Ms  Pokorny's renovated space pleasant experience truncated unannounced 'weekend brunch' menu aside   Apparently once Ruby Tuesday sunny patio offering al fresco option those sold modest Mardi Gras décor party three sat quickly cozy four top dining room mostly empty while bar bustled football service could better duo young ladies eager answer questions seek feedback while beverages remained brimming    Happily conversing beneath upbeat Cajun instrumentals would long ordering first round food would arrive although beignets bit 'bready' while Leidenheimer French Toast proved overpriced underwhelming compared restaurant's signature bread pudding both supple cinnamon roll spicy sausage excellent later recurring theme round two   Admittedly bit disappointed lack oysters brunch menu but soon find solace items offered signatures two plates creamy gouda grits meal moved stick a spoon straight base punched rich mushroom gravy snappy Andouille both shrimp flaky fish equally shined order chicken waffles entirely forgettable face such greatness mopped bowls clean complimentary grilled bread loaded garlic   last arriving dessert full menu offered addition two specials seemed only proper select items designated Lola's signatures although soft chocolate cake light yet intense while hybrid pie truly 'best both worlds' amalgam sweet savory neither could compare bread pudding steamy block custard teaming cinnamon beneath praline crunch brown sugar sauce tinged rum   Long lamented being cookie cutter planned community where PF Changs Olive Garden continue generate long lines Lola's welcome addition area sort place only hope continues proliferate West Downtown Summerlin develops   Obviously new still finding its footing particularly regard 'brunch' menu seems muddled poorly conceptualized its lack NOLA favorites oysters crawfish look forward seeing restaurant evolves over time only hope unwieldy location does prove daunting those preferring stick same ol' same ol' spots further south  <EOR> This place amazing writing review while still sitting table  Hurricane  Shrimp Grits  Pumpkin Bread Pudding seasonal   definitely coming back here  Sooner later  <EOR> Very disappointing Louisiana style food especially prices  tried Gouda Grits which mouth puckering salty  tried gumbo which tiny little cup very bland  Seriously if need know where some decent andouille sausage show you  red beans rice bland well probably due flavorless sausage again  won't back better gumbo red beans rice box  <EOR> Was skeptical bad reviews but live area wanted Cajun   Downtown location gets rave reviews thought would try it   Greeting friendly seated right away   waitress all smiles beers tap came right over well water   table sign reading grand opening oct 21 only Oct 15th    mentioned waitress she said soft opening still working kinks she acknowledged some   Menu great priced right   blackened salmon cooked perfectly choice 2 sides salad grits    husband shrimp creole   He thought bit salty taste but then again he doesn't salt anything he did eat whole dish   Desserts pumpkin bread pudding die sweet potato pie   Lola owner came over say hello then when leaving made point asking everything was   When owner walking around reputation line am definitely impressed faith she restaurant running smoothly   think should all give restaurant chance   wishing it   nice addition area las vegas    waitress said nice happy hour well brunch sat sunday  <EOR> Went last night extremely pleased  Worked lived around New Orleans over 15 years found Lola's new location good top eateries Big Easy  Atmosphere service excellent   Bronzed shrimp grits delicious just right amount spice consistency  <EOR> Don't order chicken strips   Smallest portion ever 10$   Menu also needs
