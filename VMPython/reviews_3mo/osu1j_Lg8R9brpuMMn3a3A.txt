The meat tender flavorful here! why prefer Fogo de Chao over competitors  tried beef lamb sausage even chicken  Typically places skip over chicken but would suggest trying chicken    it great flavor it! love meats succulent tough gamey tasting    I also  think stellar customer service here  wait staff always comes sure doing okay  husband asked some well done beef two people came it! wonderful thing because some places struggle even your water refilled!  The decor presentation Fogo de Chao very welcoming   even name restaurant engraved cutlery   When pay much attention detail tells only care quality food but also experience providing patrons  <EOR> First off preface review huge meat eater why did come ask? Work Xmas party heard lot buzz place thought I'd give try  going just salad bar first but $22 person might well try entire experience $45  wasn't impressed salad bar think better selection Sweet Tomatoes letdown  Then meat started coming meat overload  Nothing really spectacular honestly only piece meat liked lamb  best part experience 3 caipirinhas    For dinner 3 cocktails bill $110  Really? chance would ever back spend again kind money restaurant strip    I gave star service top it  another star food being bad  Guess place just wasn't thing  <EOR> best rodizio brasileriro even Brazil good  Every meat perfect full flavor especially personal favorite picanha  Even buffet while being overwhelming big juicy veggies prosciutto whole parmigiano reggiano cheese dig! never once dessert rodizio but Fogo try dessert only brazil crema de mamao spelling sure which papaya blended ice cream some brazilan liquor really good  The place super packed see why meats service top notch definitely back soon  It unfortunate via brasil which used fav town texas not great anyway never anywhere else brazilian meat feast  no comparison quality taste meat while pretty much same variety everywhere  <EOR> Superb!  Excellent food superior service lovely decor   best possible customer experience have  <EOR> I'm vegetarian favorite restaurant   Best salad bar world amazing service  used swanky Philly location   Las Vegas bit more down earth go figure but service just spectacular   Loved it! <EOR> Just case fell off turnip truck      Rodizio Brasileriro all meat  if don't meat give place two stars you're dumb    The salad bar fresh interesting selections  didn't bacon bits  strips bacon  thought cool  asparagus perfect    Now meat!
