After success Slider Trucks its no surprise more food trucks popped up  Japanese inspired food truck delivers creativity but needs work execution    I #1 Fuku Burger costs $5  Its your traditional burger tomatoes lettuce onions but pickled garlic Fuku sauce  first bite knew wouldn't fan it  First sauce drowned entire burger really couldn't taste anything else  burger patty also something possibly garlic just obliterates pallet where can't even taste anything anymore  Lastly used lot salt mean lot it  usually ding place using MSG anything else thirsty but never EVER drink much water eating meal  4 full glasses water last night writing review drinking even more water  Ridiculous    For mentioning Yelp free flavored ice mountain  Mine really mountain think taller Stratosphere  Regular price $3 which pricey literally shaved ice artificial food flavorings  wasn't anything special but anything cold hot Vegas summer would good    I didn't chance try garlic fries because ran out  Forgivable? Yes  However its good sign especially grand opening   The wait time food similar Slider Truck but would say Fuku slightly faster  decent size line expect 5 minute wait  Then expect another 10 15 minutes your food  Definitely place grab quick bite   Again say same thing did Slider Truck suggestion place  considerate communicate your customers whether its food shortages locations any important information  Remember everyone access internet all time    I give place credit being creative but end day food just didn't work  lot room improvement willing try place again future if its around area  Otherwise its worth driving hunting place many other venerable burger places town  <EOR> I don't think any review right now completely fair just started   Plus very cranky last night   standing next homeless guy harassed complaining kids smoking demon weed something   very scared agitated   Plus Fukuburger people said burners weren't hot expecting possibly poisoned uncooked meat     I wasn't thrilled burger  Karai spicy burger wasn't spicy ton sauce well done   Thought bit small price   Husband bacon burger loved but thought very salty   thing did love macaroni salad   loved much I'd just but far across town   I again when groove give place fair judgment   husband said best when he said When can't slider truck would just fine  <EOR> So yes time when burger sentiments exactly FU am eating meat  even now rarely eat meat but special occasions down burger team  4th July Fukuburger grand opening counted such occasion   Yes eating food truck little odd especially when hundred bazillion degrees outside logistics serving food truck challenging  During visit fryers working electricity truck having some issues  no fries katsu but team Fuku pulled through  could all use less fried foods anyways right?
