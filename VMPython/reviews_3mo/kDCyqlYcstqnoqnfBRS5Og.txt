I way Starbucks but saw huge Now Open sign front shop decided stop in  just opened past Monday 10 19 but all construction city experiencing lately plaza slightly hidden hard turn into  ended trying 12oz cold brew vanilla sweetener  Pretty good! update review forthcoming visits   **Update Stopped couple more visits  Construction still ongoing  cold brew iced coffee consistently smooth pretty potent if you're going wakefulness factor  I'm pretty basic haven't chance try any flavored lattes blended drinks  Service far pleasant but decor still quite sterile walls seemingly naked  did menu board  progress  If develop little more creating inviting cozy atmosphere think would great alternative spot handful coffee shops area  <EOR> Super good coffee  Cute modern inside  Nice sitting areas hanging friends  Employees super nice  Construction terrible  5 stars when construction done maybe some outside sitting areas  <EOR> Came check new coffee house right off bat nice see coffee shop open near business park well sunset park    Loved coffee drinks  regular latte also white chocolate latte  Both drinks very good opinion but course no coffee bean expert  All say though very much prefer over most other places including large corporate chains  Pastries offered also items catered those vegan diet    It's still new place sure further enhancing decor inside  Looked little plain but did quite number seats  Hopefully things pick insides little cozier  <EOR> New local coffee shop option across Sunset Park same business park Heidi's Brooklyn Deli  Menu offers hot iced blended beverages along light breakfast lunch food options  few cookies macarons brownies display counter  Service friendly soy milk available   The iced café mocha dark chocolate soy milk tastier option cold brew added vanilla sweetener which somehow ended more latte   Coffee itself robust large around $5  <EOR> Awesome espresso even better when paired delicious brownies  staff also great  <EOR> Picked pretty good iced latte morning  Tried muffin too  seemed fresh  shabby  Really liked vibe decor inside  I'd try something else off menu next time  location pretty great since across Sunset Park  Could nice morning  Staff very friendly well  <EOR> Extremely nice comfortable environment  Breakfast items unique delicious  Highly recommend Breakfast Bombness <EOR> I love place!

Um  Hello delicious  Finally Breakfast Bombness flavor trip avocado tomato bacon cream cheese spinach flavors melted together bacon gives savory kick all English muffin  Loved it    The construction bit pain for everyone customers business owners area there's much all over LV but rhythm  Going South Eastern cross Sunset Pama Lane right entrance Pour    I used live Las Vegas two years  time I'd Sunrise  When came across Pour week struck brightness place big windows overlooking park  very new business impressed quality food put flavors owner Deborah come with  <EOR> Finally took time visit spot since every time I'd think going I'd remember construction Eastern just Sunrise Coffee instead lol  Pour located across Sunset Park shopping center Roberto's Heidi's Brooklyn Deli small parking lot but lot empty spaces  Walking inside really surprised bright clean was  Large windows lots seating  Seems great spot people bust laptops chill   However feel hours really limit being 7am 5pm Monday through Friday 8am 2pm Saturday Sunday  knows maybe they'll extend hours if more popular especially since they're only 10 15 minutes away UNLV   So most important stuff tried Iced Raspberry Chocolate only $4 80 oh man drink incredibly smooth! almost velvet texture! much strong coffee flavor Sunrise Coffee but I'd definitely compare place Grouchy John's  Bomb com Definitely recommend getting one  also offer lot cool options menu including non espresso items Pistachio Delight which probably try next time Paninis served 8am 2pm  Paninis=awesome  Time limit Paninis=not awesome  But definitely eyeing Caribbean Special which includes fried plantains mustard hot sauce avocado tomatoes turkey! Also Apple Cheddar sounds pretty cool including fig jam apples olive oil cheddar  other food options waffles served only Saturday Sunday bakery items mini salted caramel apple pies chocolate brownies vegan chocolate chip cookies! Basically feel place mix between Grouchy John's Tiabi Coffee Waffles which opinion pretty amazing   As service everyone really friendly  I'd only recommend turn music little bit since little awkward being quiet  But overall definitely back try more drinks some tasty sounding waffles paninis <EOR> AWESOME!!! whenever coffee tea pastries! service grand employees friendly  coffee point well! p <EOR> I visited Pour first week opened around 11 00 AM  only customer establishment three employees sitting down looked eating  barista took order very nice but seemed little confused didn't know much menu options  When asked if sugar free syrups he first didn't know then confirmed did bummer but offered Agave instead  then ordered black coffee latte took quite while receive order considering only person there  found prices quite high well compared nearby competition   seemed staff unfamiliar working computer but tried let considering first week grand opening  establishment itself lot seating area work meet friends  impressed cleanliness decor but unfortunately sold overall experience  <EOR> Stopped quick lunch apple cheddar pannini french press coffee both which served promptly delicious  <EOR> I love place happy close house  They excellent selection blended drinks which sweet tea based drinks girls always for   They excellent selection baked goods local The Bake Shop  tried brownies sugar cookies gingerbread macarons my fave! muffins vegan chocolate chip cookies all very good  The staff beyond friendly  Every time owner shop she remembers order stops chat  They're trying really part community hip coffee shop way  Starting hosting open mic nights mornings kids teenagers January! cool that?

There many coffee aficionados why does seem odd tea aficionados well?   Considering Yelp'd tea not coffee tea establishment popped expectation selection teas   When offered only six varieties none them basic black tea point view establishment's TEA not coffee selection minuscule sad  seriously sure arguing customer beneficial   All would take bit more customer service bit more research improving one's tea selection  <EOR>
