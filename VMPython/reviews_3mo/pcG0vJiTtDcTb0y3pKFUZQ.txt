Thank guys!! right back soon <EOR> Hookah good  Atmosphere fun but service HORRIBLE! saw server maybe 2 times best  take order bring drinks hookah then he disappeared   track down check  Don't know would come back due extremely poor service  <EOR> The three stars only lovely server   She amazing tried night she even sang karaoke english song she made day  The problem attempte order beverage off menu  first drink ordered did we'll second third drink   Therefore finally just ordered beer which amazing ! Although discouraging customers order drink then being told 3 times <EOR> You kidding place   Bulgarian run operation bunch people absolutely no clue run pleasing appealing restaurant city hemisphere matter!  When walked few people asked table particular but told if just became RESERVED instead sit both where side 6 inches higher other other side no seat backs rather bench type seat   Interestingly enough RESERVED table asked still unoccupied upon departure   Inexplicably rave reviews Yelp convinced try place   Many reviews praised Chicken Kiev which quite unfortunate because told 'CHICKEN FRIGGING KIEV!    The waiter nice enough really over head   two different types potatoes plus rice available entrees he TRIED explain both same dish now because time two different types potatoes but eliminated two options but NEVER changed menus reflect that   potatoes potatoes! Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!  He told Greek Salad $9 95 more big enough four people   Wrong!   barely enough two people   He brought serving spoon other utensil distribute its small portions   guess use hands Bulgaria   The music quite loud asked if  could turn down bit   waiter said probably because going party soon desired volume   Only later when escalated issue owner did turn down little bit   I ordered Chicken Kabob now unitary potato choice   wife too  kabob skewer concept sadly eviscerated replaced instead open slab chicken lots chunks heavy duty 30 weight potatoes fill plate    Carb city!  asked owner happened skewer expected veggies it?  He said different kind Kabob   over it!  My friend asked some gravy something equivalent put pork dish   He expecting something warm but instead given bowl looked ketchup nice cold boot   Bulgarian gravy!    I must say food tasted OK but nothing great memorable it    something your neighbor made invited over for    Eh?  OK  it   The Russian beer served quite good   Total tab food fest paltry $115 60!  I really don't understand all great review REALLY don't!      and really considered Mediterranean restaurant spite Greek Salad   Only good beer saved place star   Uh no star is!  Sorry guys but NO  <EOR> A schnitzel salad took 45 minutes come out  serving other table sure why said busy  Also they're beef stroganoff but pretty sure just meant didn't feel making Sunday night  didn't include napkins silverware take bag now find some those somewhere  Also guy gave resistance honoring yelp voucher offered  <EOR> I saw all great reviews decided give place chance  walked greeted seated  bench seating uncomfortable suggest sit chair  waiter very attentive only 2 tables occupied whole restaurant expected    The tables looks 80's shiny black white fake marble look  felt sitting someone living room    We ordered beef stroganoff which ok bit oily taste  also ordered vareniki potatoes which ok best  hit night chicken porharzky cutlets awesome  rice kind bland needs some help  potatoes really good  orders took long time come out   I don't think would back just style    sorry <EOR> Yum!! Excited Russian spot LV! amazing food great atmosphere can't wait come back <EOR> Decided try new restaurant celebrate boyfriend's new job! love Eastern European food hit spot! beer stroganoff boyfriend garlic shrimp  also hummus ground beef delicious! Definitely must try when come here  Just heads restaurant very relaxed European feel  service does take little longer most but food worth wait!
