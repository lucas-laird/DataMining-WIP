I never English food before decided try Town Square being am local wanted try something new area  Let just say food phenomonal  cod loin served  carrots mash potatoes  BUT carrots no ordinary carrots honeyed sweet taste delish! potatoes fluffy could sleep them delicious well but favorite cod    seared perfection seasoned just right   perfect blend lemon pepper die for! friend chicken bacon leek pie  dont onions but leeks perfect dish overpowering combined flavors just together perfectly  She side order sauteed fried green beans those amazing well  Prices good chef Kevin came check things well which always plus book  back again  Beautiful ambience inside seating well 3 small patios chose although only cocktails smoking but its secluded rest doesnt interfere dining those dont smoke   very nice! Lots choose menu ill definatly back try more  Oh yea service great too  <EOR> First off wait staff GREAT   very nice however food mediocre price   British woman took VERY disappointed   When she voiced complaints chef seemed genuinely concerned though   Overall atmosphere great but wouldn't food  <EOR> Went wife great reviews trust disappointed  When first walked did see but 2 tables occupied during lunchtime which made little nervous first  But waiter named Sam things looking up  He very pleasant talk to  Bangers Mash wife Fish Chips  Both dishes Great! Very different taste both dishes  minted peas something ever tasted! definitely going back! <EOR> Not sure legit reviews far but good job getting check place out  Third restaurant location since TSq opened? Good luck!! fan both previous businesses    We just made end happy hour nice enough let slide couple minutes longer choose appetizers  All happy hour apps $2 piece  Pretty sweet price  $3 glasses Newcastle Werewolf beer  Never before very good brew    Happy hour apps We beef sliders which different  patties battered deep fried  certainly juicy but then again could deep fried hamburger patty any other way? prefer regular sliders though  Brits really way?   Got mini chicken pot pie steak pot pie  decent  wife preferred beef pot pie ground beef but liked whole piece steak  Good flavor something would definitely again    The chips most disappointing  came curry dip mild watery  fries served rare actually sent them back!! NEVER sent back fries life  place  supposedly British???? Unreal  2nd batch fries acceptable but still very meh    This place lots promise though  breakfast menu looked yummy weekday lunch deal could knockout  lunch entree then $5 more all drink British beer  sounds heckuva fun midday! $10 bottomless offer mimosa bloody mary's bellinis breakfast but its only 9am 11am   Still decent better drink deal anywhere else nearby   Sunday roast which starts couple weeks could great too    The English afternoon tea time something should targeted moms kids maybe guys drink pinky sticking out  more just 1 TV place? whole TV schedule soccer perhaps?   I feel bad 2 star review only because staff really friendly personable   But call see it   hope bump star next visit   know back bottomless beer lunch days       Conclusion Maybe British   But Crown Anchor kind British much much more darts jukebox more TV's occasional stupid wanker patron better chips  <EOR> I don't give lot 5 star reviews buy gots say great lunch last week   Very cute little English restaurant pub style menu although room decorated more cute cafe English pub   Food great   Try savory peas   Perfectly cooked meaty bacon pearl onions   tried sampler meat pies   all warm savory yummy comfort   Mashed potatoes little stiff underseasoned but let slide   partner fish n chips sliders   fantastic!  Great service un vegas quaint room great food legit pub menu little gem worth finding   The chef came said hey   Usually bugs but case cool cuz he forgotten include mash meaty pies came apologize deliver goods     Good stuff  <EOR> The topped mussels creamy wine sauce Cornish pasty delicious   bread pudding strange taste would preferred more traditional flavor custard  <EOR> I intrigued newest kid block Town Square especially since little different existing bars restaurants   First cool little joint   seems exact layout Caña previous occupant   great happy hour $10 pitcher English beer $4 well drinks $5 cocktails   think wine $3     Another great thing REVERSE happy hour which hard come Vegas   9 30pm 11 30pm M F       There's also $2 happy hour food fried zucchini called something  special but can't quite remember chips beef sliders   chips good but agree previous post  curry sauce little odd     The slider good $2 take it   However aware slider   big slider appears deep fried which oh so much better many levels   Nonetheless slider which little off putting given happy hour menu says sliderS plural    Oddly enough which group later chuckled when another person ordered BLT off regular menu singular came TWO big BLT sandwiches!              It seems little upscale but could cloth table linens talking   any event dig place hope survives   interested try daily tea do  <EOR> We stumbled across Town Square newcomer chance   Nice looking place though particularly English appearance   arrived during reverse happy hour treated inexpensive eats beer   Newcastle Werewolf but some other decent choices   chef recommended chips curry which turned great   curry watery lacked punch curry should have   Chips curry flavored water better description but probably wouldn't sell well   fish slider other hand really tasty   fish perfectly cooked   should few more those  <EOR> Went afternoon tea service  only three couples busy  first turn off seemed try sell much needed  friend neither hungry going split scones pot tea but kept telling two  stubborn only ordered more enough  food good wanted be  other problem waitress asked strong wanted tea said medium which place cool timer table  But she said she would back serve four minutes steaming  She didn't retune until five minute timer ram then some  awkward because didn't know if should've just poured ourselves!  Now don't drink enough tea know difference between strong weak but just don't she didn't come back when she said she would  all busy either! tea loose leaf acai berry tea which good pour through strainer guess thats whole service aspect  But overall somewhat underwhelming  <EOR> Huge selection food  also nice Brunch menu   Service very good   Definitely improvement over Cana  <EOR> This place BEST English fish chips U S     The happy hour menu fill fish chip slider cutesy pie courgettes crispy zucchini sticks which amazing   menu good selection foods fish pasta burgers steaks   prices very reasonable deserts unbelievable   This place should try if Town Square   also Sunday Brunch all food exceptional  <EOR> I saw place featured new openings   hubby Fish Chips fanatic he's always search good most especially if English he's picky   told should check place since aren't many English places around high ratings   We late afternoon Saturday over labor day weekend   Because time only few customers seated immediately   see pictures website place really nice modern   actually when another upper scale seafood restaurant believe kept most furnishings   All staff greeted very courteous but nothing overtly just very attentive   My hubby course ordered Cod Fillet Steak Mushroom Ale Pie ordered English's Bolognese little one   any entrees kid sized but ordered regular always take home   didn't order any appetizer's dessert around   hubby liked Cod real crisp great crunch Cod flaky moist however he said really good but blown away   dish good but know wouldn't Ale taste really wished meat much more tender was   cooked well however dish just liking but might someone else   puff pastry light flaky flaky crumbled easily   daughter's meal her's most really great flavor generous portion shared again next day    I feel bad 3 star rating want give them 4 because aesthetics place attentive staff chef even came greet which real nice quality food seems real good maybe if only ordered something different   selections just weren't taste but might someone else   hubby doesn't care come back because many options there   However would come back Afternoon Tea which really don't find around   Perhaps girlfriends sometime  <EOR> This review refers afternoon tea service only    My husband English cajoled into trying cream tea afternoon  service incredibly friendly feel pretty much devil but     The sandwiches stale horrible old crust feeling  scones weren't fresh but reheated microwave  clotted cream more whipped cream  cakes still frozen middle making pathetically obvious chef just lopped them off larger block ordered in cake taken straight walk in fridge  Thank goodness PG Tips tea somewhat redeem entire offering   How place calls itself quintessentially British pass stuff off customers? felt embarrassed waiter being English must know full well off everything is  whole kitchen quietly laughing themselves Silly Americans!
