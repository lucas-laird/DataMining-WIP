However shouldn't restaurant afford all accommodations being 'a restaurant'  Come sit down order drinks take your time order appies entrees etc all diners convenience time table? restaurant's?  Table 89 succeeded taking enjoyment  meal time   Their little hook committed using freshest local produce organic ingredients farmers know partners trust  sure entice some foodies    But intelligent aware foodies going look words Organic non GMO menu  find them  Because law only way state menu if true  Organic ingredients thing organic menu items meats produce entirely different matter   Maybe case younger hipper crowd don't mind standing line order food read through entire menu order everything may want consume all within 5 minutes walking door  <EOR> Disappointed  exact opposite  improvement  place used much better sammy's  If wanted  set table myself  would eat home  whole experience felt big let down  breakups high school  felt better when found sammy's  going away  unexpected unannounced 100% uncalled  for  way eat sammy's  regularly once twice week just walked into locked door  spiel change  Well today see myself  While people nice  set failure  whole dining  experience ruined  want wait line McDonald's military  chow hall and  seen more few them smaller portions  less selections before  Whoever owns sammy's  sir maim shame you  <EOR> Love new concept neighborhood!

We back more! <EOR> They don't fries anymore! Need say more?  no idea changed name restaurant  afraid walked whole menu different well  completely case  food somewhat same  Sliders now just sliders chips instead fries lettuce tomato pickle  didn't fact everything ourselves  Drinks silverware condiments napkins  busy mom expecting served restaurant highly disappointed all myself  could just stayed home saved money! Sorry but won't returning here  farm table idea bull  same food just scaled down  felt jipped! <EOR> It very odd see change while picking phone order seeing all those people standing line  Ordered usual Greek salad chicken breast but surprise salad smaller  Cheaper but less salad chicken breast breast but combination white dark meat  Huh ?? happened breast meat ? Fatty little white meat  Why dark meat ? And new concept standing around order bit tacky  think ! don't think drive nearest Sammy's Sahara sit down order  No more family functions date night Sammy's  Yikes ! think any more  very sad  <EOR> 1000x better Rachels Kitchen   actually season food   Also way better Sammys   Glad new dining option over here  <EOR> First understand folks Sammy's still ownership location  always nice new restaurant open neighborhood  tried 5 6 times year under Sammy's name always enjoyed wine selection although seemed touch pricey  TABLE 89 basically 'order counter' situation sort ordering at     say Fuddruckers  billed globally inspired locally produced restaurant  menu certainly modern lobster bisque mini duck tacos watercress sandwich arugula n beet salad tofu few places  $18 Merlot carafe netted 2 glasses but glass price $6  appetizer tried 'small plate' meatballs n marinara $6   well presented tasty  dinner entrée ordered 4 cheese pizza wife kiddo described cheese dough  ordered $11 chicken Caesar  salad good really liked grilled garlic bread but lo carb guy only small taste  wouldn't say great even good value here   restaurant no servers bring anything not even flatware struggled bit understand giant spot charge receipt typical restaurant tip  even typical 15 18 20 percent tip calcs  appreciate great service see other reviews regularly tip 20 30 points but would tipping counter Rubios then before even seeing food  end can't say we'll back anytime soon   Overall for $59 18 2 glasses wine side meatballs salad low medium quality pizza I'd say should all let concept chance but wouldn't bet it'll past 1st year  <EOR> Having never really fan Sammy's pizza wasn't really rushing check Table 89  But since Chipotle its usual line nearly door figured might well check out  under same ownership Sammy's but completely different concept   Walking you'll see large counter open kitchen right behind seating both your left right  while might taking fast casual approach feels bit cheaper basically all self service restaurant besides placing your order having food brought your table  All silverware napkins etc  separate sections nothing table brought your food  Considering many similar places least bring silverware your food found bit odd   Moving Table 89 actually pretty extensive menu  plenty apps salads entrees sides kids menu there's bound something everyone  There's also quite pizza options well although can't say compare Sammy's offerings since only couple times  decided Mini Duck Tacos share son then Herb Marinated Sliced Steak dinner   Mini Duck Tacos 4 small crunchy tacos served basically smothered almost slaw topping  shells themselves brittle almost stale tasting since very little actual meat tacos hard taste anything else  did try piece duck itself definitely overcooked very little flavor  Sadly feta cheese tomato mixture topped creamy sauce definite star dish  might only time I'd say having something other meat smother taco good thing    Herb Marinated Sliced Steak having read bad reviews kind kicking myself ordering afterwards  Much what's already expressed steak very tough overcooked  menu claims its medium rare but mine more well done  barely seasoned completely masked way sweet lentils  liked crispness fresh greens top but overall just dish I'd recommend   With tacos being exception portion sizes aren't bad price  steak entree priced $11 healthy portion steak plenty lentils along it  wife salad also pretty good size $8  total bill $37 appetizer 2 entrees 1 kids meal 2 drinks  greatest pricing considering style restaurant but stick drinking water decent amount    Since don't interact staff often can't say whole lot service  When first walked explained system kind just sent way  did nice girl check once while eating but otherwise you're mostly your own here    Overall everything just okay  If you're area worth shot but definitely worth going your way for  nice they're bringing something little different Northwest area but certainly won't rushing back  <EOR> Used come 2 4 times month when Sammy's Wood Fired Pizza  Always enjoyed freshness quality menu items prices could bit high but always thought justified due quality    Table 89 owned Sammy's parent company does disappoint menu  Familiar dishes new favorites alike  quality ingredients preparation finished products great  definitely locally sourced  farm table feel quality here  while Table 89 gone more serve yourself style still attentive staff caters customers needs happy help  Adding subtracting components any dish no problem  biggest surprise    the menu prices 30 40% lower before!!!!! No loss food quality lower prices count in  <EOR> We weekly customers Sammy's surprised see changed  decided give Table 89 try but extremely disappointed when walked in  felt walking into pediatric office  thing looked forward Sammy's warm friendly staff exceptional service  prefer sit bar when dine no longer option  Even if food good atmosphere terrible  Disappointed loyal Sammy's customers returning  <EOR> Had lunch Thursday  sad see sammys wood fire pizza but restaurant better all good  moment u walk smoky aroma wood fired oven reassures u u picked right place eat  more casual sit down restaurant  U order counter waiter brings your food wine 5 10 minutes  Staff polite decor nature friendly glass stone greens Browns best part    food local organic lots vegan options totally delicious!!! marinated steak Caesar salad glass Sauvignon blanc    mouthwatering good! definitely going back! <EOR> I Table 89 first time yesterday  just picked some dinner son way home  treat  When gym work never time cook such great way feed well without wait having stay dine in  son cheeseburger sliders spinach quinoa salad  10 minutes loved food  place godsend healthy busy families  <EOR> Used come when Sammy's Woodfired Pizza  Now strange mash fast food type service average food  concept strange appears more way ownership cut costs having waiters servers something benefits customer  Want second beer? back counter order one  Also take your credit card pay again   The food isn't very good certainly worth hassle force through it  somewhere else because place sucks  <EOR> I've worked Ladeki Corporation 16 years  know hospitality inside out    super excited try Table 89  love wine tap very eco friendly  Also 2 awesome T V 's  Beto Tamra V  Tamra L  always welcoming hospitality exerts them! live block away constantly bringing new people around  believe product never fails!

If want great pasta salad small plates come check out!! thing wish bar stools!! stood drank wine  completely takes personal connections your guest! <EOR> Got discount coupon Sammy's Wood Fire Pizza since hadn't long time grabbed because she never been   Imagine surprise when parked couldn't find it   Instead eatery number name  heck   Let's try said tossing discount coupon trash   Met peppy hostess filled drill ordering counter   Ordered pizza salad glass wine beer   given number identify table runner told find seat   Thought price bit harsh given fast food methodology place   Dining facility comfy   But prefer traditional server takes your order brings model when dine out   Please bring back old Sammy's service food   won't back eat number  <EOR> The restaurant super cute love ambience here  service very good though some might consider slow  but small restaurant isn't busy think fine  food selection nice salads wood fired pizza wraps other dishes  Definitely cute restaurant closer home <EOR> I just moved area NYC wasn't expected find such good food place doesn't proper table service   Well gladly admit snobby New Yorker food critic extremely pleased food atmosphere place   Although wait line place your order staff super friendly attentive seating lighting design looks nice place NYC     I haven't eaten variety things because fallen love Chicken Tequilla Fettucini Greek Salad   I order 2 other friends staying also love Chicken Tequilla well pizza's other items   Eventually order something other Fettucini but now Jam! <EOR> In word disappointing    My hubbie dined regularly when Sammy's  taken aback when grab lunch saw new signage building  menu still beet salad decided give whirl    I walked empty restaurant 1 guy front me  He sampling beers trying decide kind beer he wanted pitcher  fine because knew I'd next  cooks weren't busy they'd able food quickly  continued wait patiently room behind filled others waiting order  appeared bartender called back because 2 girls came front counter  people behind hadn't waiting nearly long had proceeded order register left where standing  Still waiting pitcher beer guy pay    seriously?  Now order going behind huge crowd folks came I think softball team something?   No thank you  guess eliminated wait staff reduce overhead  personal opinion big mistake    I can't comment food because left without ever having ordered  even being acknowledged matter  Service big thumbs down sure  <EOR> With limited number restaurants area loving Sammy's decided check new restaurant creator Sammy's  decor slightly different however layout exactly same  comforted see couple familiar faces but standing usual hostess stand wait seated bit taken back when someone asked behind Sammy's cashier stand if ready order  reaction Ready Order? confused friend said never wasn't sure clearly since just recently opened standing waiting seated   busser explain casual dining ahead order then bring food us  Ok no problem  expected but think better greeting explanation new layout would nice  ordered find seat outside while friend unsure fill drinks  finally sitting realized supposed own utensils napkin well  Again being new restaurant having menu close Sammy's offers would think staff would kind enough explain especially said first time weren't sure do  end food price actually pretty good  friend both Thai Shrimp Salad $11    hated seeing dirty dishes piled other tables until least 5 needed busses before someone came paid attention them  Then watch old lady ask busser if she own drink refill then back into building across restaurant fill glass little unsettling too  She husband confused new concept  Definitely nothing experience when Sammy's    It did however stop returning dinner very same day tonight   Again food good location convenient home  Knowing time party walked straight 20 menu screen look over menu but even 5 minutes arriving asked ready order  Really? party 3 again new restaurant  don't see anyone ready fast  Especially when menu small  utensils grab some forks but all containers oversized spoons steak knives regular knives teaspoons  No forks only 8p  close 9 30p busy  Market Salad $9 added Grilled Chicken Breast $3 which ok  Nothing exciting but fresh healthy  would order again  friend Grilled Steak Lentils $12 but before ordering she asked kind steak was  busser told NY Strip which surprised but actually Flank Steak  think Flank actually better  watched people walked only greeted Hi ready order? really think should change  Maybe warm welcome staff inquiring if persons first time explain concept layout such  Just until everyone neighborhood doesn't expect same  Sammy's hospitality we're all used to  <EOR> Dull   Uninviting   Confusing    We walked tonight good spirits   seen restaurant going other nearby restaurants i e  Chipotle noticed old Sammy's Woodfire Grille   first glance restaurant seemed hidden   walked puzzled ordering process   weren't any friendly workers ask questions any greetings anyone even smiles any workers   people front taking sweet time looking two menu monitors waited   When turn order mentioned cashier never dined restaurant ever   Hoping response instead blank stare   didn't want take long time unlike people before preceded order quickly     We decided order lobster bisque meatball marinara cheese bread steak sandwich   cashier finally spoke asked    and drinks?? if annoying order   rest dinner continued below average   actually quiet   Everyone whispering because ceiling low walls close   no background music even enjoy     The short end story don't think returning restaurant choice   food decent nothing rave about   wish service friendlier more inviting all other restaurants lot friendlier just outside doors   don't ask high quality presentation big welcome just friendly faces appreciation  <EOR> Confused first new concept but now enjoy being bothered   conversation without interruption  Much enjoyed!!! staff very polite very informative new procedures confusion short  food always very tasty but while chicken lacking quality  glad say now back expected  Good quality! <EOR> Used come before when Sammy's    menu good food good    steak watercress sandwich daughter grilled chicken salad shared hummus    Great flavor very fresh   Just don't new system   fan staring hostess while picking something eat    Overall bad   come again  <EOR> My fiance came eat other day exceptional experience  Going almost self service restaurant off putting worked restaurant same concept  really enjoyed food  favorite tequila chicken fettuccini  Delicious fresh food  <EOR> Well upsetting someone loves Sammy's very excited see moved right down street then shut down turned into Italian Chipotle     Maybe trying compete neighbors next door whatever reason won't back  trek real Sammy's next time want it  <EOR> The food great ordered Tofu Curry Bowl which delicious except wish served more shrimp had 3 pieces bowl least noodles since $12 wasn't filling enough  result order New York style pizza which $14 10 inch since added chicken  total paid $26 + tax person since first dish enough satisfy hunger  new concept food healthy gluten free options vegan food etc  However since dining self serving would assume more generous quantity food serve per order  <EOR> The ordering process rushed uncomfortable   The food 3 different pizzas 3 different salads very good   pizza crusts dry tasteless   wife's margarita pizza some kind dijon vinegrette which absolutely ruined basil flavor   The atmosphere terrible   ate outside because dining room freezing cold   mistake due sitting area where everyone stands smokes other side fence   strong smell cigarette smoke present entire time different people waited smoked fence   Sammy's same location always great food never bad meal there   don't know brought changes Table 89 but result terrible   Bring back Sammy's  <EOR> Got prosciutto pear pizza some fries   could taste find any prosciutto pizza gorgonzola pretty strong   If bite pear gorgonzola very good     The fries well seasoned good  <EOR> What happened you?
