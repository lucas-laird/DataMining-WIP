The second eyebrow raised when only other customer returned bowl asked if could microwave it  BUT maybe man just likes good burn right?   Now personally only two eyebrows    but if more would risen up     The voodoo chicken perhaps legitimately under spell  seasoning flavor best articulated word spoiled  The bread fresh  gumbo hot   All food extremely salty     The diet coke really good though neither diarrhea  there's that    Andouille sausage?  not  <EOR> Let start off saying primarily vegetarian but sometimes just need some chicken   Also while New Orleans never truly authentic gumbo primarily based tasted   First love let sample any gumbos   Next love menu designed least most spicy   I ordered Voodoo Chicken served over white rice slice garlic bread    The chicken super tasty full flavor perfect heat   would order again   The garlic bread some stated bit crumbly but still good   Overall great quick fix gumbo  <EOR> We both ordered bourbon chicken which very tasty! staff very friendly sweet  only issue inconsistency  know fairly new still working kinks  bread pudding ordered visit completely different previous visit  executed same way if order something expect same prior unless improved  Also bread include your meal no flavor very dry  should revamp could much better just away it  stand wrong love bourbon chicken won't change  just hope stays consistent  <EOR> Well place gumbo potpourri flowers #fake   using Zatarain processed products selling it  name really misleading  Should call cajun bowls  Unless start selling real gumbo change name  Black eye real soul cajun creole food  <EOR>
