I've looking Chinese crepes ??????for long time states first place it  sauce light sure ask extra    Tofu Jelly also impressively authentic another fantastic offering addition Taiwanese breakfast fares offered Las Vegas  Wait little slow sense wait staff still getting used everything but very polite    I great experience here  <EOR> Good service good lamb kabob wife liked soup  Owner seemed very likable person very attentive service  <EOR> Lamb kabobs good cooked well done just right spicy nice place nice people's <EOR> This seriously Las Vegas's hidden gems  Come while still busy prices dirt cheap quality food get    The owner gave group plum juice try  very mild but totally refreshing  very sweet fruity version house tea most Chinese restaurants    The free appetizer excellent! never shredded potatoes before! seems raw potato sesame oil soy based sauce mixed dry chilies cilantro  going try recreating home!  The beef pie order two large pieces  taste Japanese gyoza but instead just steamed pies lightly fried  word warning oil meat pools inside pies  first bite might squirt oil but easy enough drain oil out    The hand pulled noodles delicious toothsome bite  bowl large enough serve two if split meat pies too  broth slight flavor lamb  taste bit bland personally but easy enough add soy sauce chili sauce even spicier    A slight hiccup chef forgot order lamb noodle soup  Good thing asked brought promptly could    I loved soup though  Very flavorful without being overpowering  word warning meat mix lamb pieces organ meat  Delicious but squeamish    The best thing while published time states close 10pm 1130pm still open several tables still full  other Asian restaurants complex but called us  really good decision because good food really good prices  <EOR> This perfect fix those hankering hot bowl noodle soup long day walking Strip Vegas but skipping exorbitant Strip prices   This place short way off Strip Chinatown  But open late night or least stayed open late when officially close 10pm think      food usual Chinese fare Northern Chinese bit milder flavor  But also very good!  We beef pies lamb noodle soup  beef pie reminds Japanese gyoza but larger meatier thicker crust  Very tasty two pieces order  lamb soup great lamb flavor broth it few lamb innards liver just know if you're into that    All all good choice those Vegas  folks running place very friendly accommodating too   Go try guys! <EOR> The service excellent people very nice!! Unique Japanese flavors various items marry well  ordered soup beef pie dumplings  All fresh delicious  Must try!!! <EOR> The food excellent  love spicy noodle Chinese Crepe Casserole pot lamb   Yumm     <EOR> The Skinny food good 2 5 service okay 3 value although prices reasonable other joints town offer better tasting fare same price  2 5 starred review    The hubs headed hubby hankering soup noodles  ordered plate marinated cucumbers vegetable leek pie Lanzhou hand pulled beef noodle soup chicken mushroom noodle soup   Service prompt we only ones during weekday lunch    The plate marinated cucumbers definitely bland needed marinated more vinegar garlic  Pass dish   The leek vegetable pie filling okay  main problem dough fried long enough leaving more soggy texture  definitely needed more crispy outside    The Lanzhou hand pulled noodle dish kind let down  First all given uniformity noodles dish hand pulled noodles  Secondly noodles overcooked bit mushy tastes  soup rather lacking beef flavor  only redeeming factor sliced beef delicious melted your mouth  Other though would order dish again   The chicken mushroom noodle soup suffered same issues regards lack intensity soup base texture noodles   Overall other places Vegas same thing better same reasonable prices  2 5 stars  <EOR> NOTE Yelp listing name actual storefront says Big Noodle ? sure deal if  just translation  Former space occupied Island Malaysian #2 same building Ichiza   Now  way    Went grab takeout only customer dinner 7PM weekday  Small order took literally half hour come food mediocre   Ordered steamed dumplings lamb pancake  Dumplings mushy overcooked bland  Taste appearance identical you'd frozen bag grocery store boiling yourself  Pancake contained small portion flavorful lamb bad overshadowed all grease  Opened takeout box puddle oil  picked pancake all over hands bit mouthful too  Gross!  Service dismal best  only customer wait time unacceptable no excuse apology given  found frustrating dumplings only come 10 order cannot mixed matched other flavors styles  thought reasonable request possibly should consider light lack customers new business  Server barely spoke even when dropping off picking bill  <EOR> Another clean trendy interior Chinese restaurant but service apparently point  didn't rice asked wait them cook  kind Chinese restaurant doesn't rice ready? server didn't even know if serve item ordered  taste lamb gamy favor pork leek dumplings  am sure if unique taste share same boiling water cook all dumplings  But leek pancakes good may come back just order go  <EOR> Worst jian bing guo zi ever had!!! excited try place since serves fav things world jian bing guo zi  bad could barely swallow used premade crepe instead making crepe fresh disgusting! also tried soup noodles below average  Save your money anywyere else <EOR>
