We should known something wrong when approached restaurant   it virtually empty while Wolfgang Puck's restaurant just across way bustling patrons   My wife celebrating 35th anniversary son us   after being seated small amount foccacia bread served no butter olive oil balsamic dipping?   the party next hailed down waiter asked olive oil balsamic brought immediately   it late already eaten small portion served   oh BTW party already gottten face waitress blessed different waiter  they complained sitting long without being attended dining needs     We both ordered hanger steak which accompanied arrugala fig salad   I ordered steak medium rare received raw rare   my wife ordered medium turned medium rare   the best part dish salad  both steaks cooked order lacked seasoning   the steak itself boring    $28 plate!  My son pasta dish Cartierra      also looked boring plate   just pasta   no other accompaniment     waiter never grated any cheese over pasta being done other pasta dishes being served    $17  In celebration wedding anniversary ordered usual Bombay Saphire Gin tonic   when bill found charged $14 cocktail should called manager over made scene   I've NEVER life charged such exhorbitant amount Bombay Gin tonic nor would ever expect again lifetime   c'mon Mario kidding me!  Now dessert fiasco   we ordered Dolce Giorno   which three different gellato selections served cream puffs   what first three different scoops gellato served bowl all squished together liken large scoop?   when said ordered dessert served would thought all hell going break loose   the waitress's jaw dropped wasn't fault   and then manager wanted know why she bringing dessert back replacement?   price tag   $12  All told mediocre meal   a $111 tab plus tip   I agree other star commenter   these TV star restauranteurs could care less if ever see again constant turnover travelers Las Vegas provides huge pool sitting ducks just waiting plucked   And way Mario if would try good hanger steak please visit nearest Cheesecake Factory  they sell theirs Hibachi steak slightly more half your price   Lastly would recommend wonderful Las Vegas restaurant dined called Table 34  great food wonderful service gin tonic   $8 <EOR> Big fan Mario   NYC restaurant before he famous  Otto nice lively outdoor area but opted indoors more intimate evening   decor nice but little formal bistro   Margherita pizza evcellent better Rome   gemelli pasta brocolli rabe housemade sausage really flavorful but pasta itself al dente us   thought should offered shave some fresh parmesan pasta dish but didn't   appetizer fritti arancine fried rissoto excellent fritti di Prosciutto good   Pistachio dark chocolate malt gelato good gets really smooth rich flavorful   found wine glass ounce way pricey 4 ounce glass middle road white red cost much entres  <EOR> We enjoyed nice lunch Otto during stay Vegas  Bread ask olive oil vinegar don't just bring you   Starters calzone fried bread things I forgot called them    $2 extra marinara sauce Salad pesto caprese salad fresh mozerella REALLY good 2 pizzas margherite sausage peppers thin crust pizza  Don't expect chicago deep dish  thought pretty good but good stuff real Venice!! Great location! really feel outdoors enjoying meal St  Marks Square under blue sky! Definitely recommended if want bite eat Venetian Palozzo  <EOR> Batali smart change name Otto much easier say remember mouthful prior Enoteca San Marco     A few tweaks need made rid hostess she's face resto seriously?  tired hungry complain  Gemelli w house sausage broccoli rabe needs lighter sauce lighter hand w the sodium $18  LOVED the Cavatappi $21 loved light tomato sauce lamb ragu   Pasta perfectly al dente   OK Smashed Fried Potatoes $7 nice fragrant rosemary some spuds could crunchier would nice know type potatoes two served   Wine pretty pricey $15 4oz pour   Nice selection     FREE entertainment heart square   Great post outlet shopping refuel  <EOR> Great lunch spot if you're mood something fancy but better usual fast food place  prosciutto arugula pizza which tasted fresh light wonderful  If you're big eater recommend splitting pie someone if you're still hungry appetizer  hostess sat outside enjoy free opera show plaza  Overall prices reasonable  pie which feed 2 ppl cost only $18  would definitely come dinner too  <EOR> We seated good table patio   Nice greeting everything downhill then   DO come restaurant if chance read review   Both service quality shocked me   could restaurant level survive competitive Vegas strip     My gf ordered glasses champaign served wine glass   bubble evaporated way before she could finished glass   unprofessional!  As food ordered Octopus Salad Vongole Pizza Pork Shoulder   salad came first within seconds everything else came   shocked   table small waiter just dropped everything left   put everything plate order ourselves   terrible service!  Food sucks salad very impressive   pizza baked hours ago served dead cold   pork shoulder only dish would recommend night     Another interesting point note waiter came over asked how's everything?    He literally gone before he finished asking     It first diner Vegas trip   know everything going uphill only  <EOR> With name change formerly Enoteca San Marco came blow quality comfortable eatery   The menu same   select number items want try share well chosen list cheeses cured meats salads fried items if add pastas pizzas your starter   Fun   Wines glass still 250ml pours making them great deal   The slip quality found service quality prepared items   I am regular several managers servers know never any problem service however another guest sitting bar next told she pay $5 if she wanted extra marinated cherry cheese course   Another asked additional olive oil bread server told give enough your bread wanted sure he would waste additional oil   As food fried cauliflower heavily coated uncooked batter pasta extremely salty   sent pasta  back but thanks language barrier the busser did speak good English dish returned NO salt   Oh well   took off check comped wine satisfied   This still good place quick bite especially if want enjoy show Venetian  <EOR> The best part meal bread olive oil salad  Seriously!   My coworker dined while Vegas looking something quick plentiful spending day Hoover Dam  Volume got but whole just so so    At least people watch while dining outside St Mark's Square indoors Venetian    We each Acetaia Vinegar Maker's Salad shared two pizzas Pancetta Goat Cheese Sausage Peppers    I loved salad! Nicely sized portion lettuce shaved parmesan reggiano prosciutto more! dressing really tangy tasty!  The Pancetta Goat Cheese pizza tasted better without HUGE ASS plop goat cheese  Really much goat cheese each slice  other pizza just seemed kinda sloppy  sausage tasted good but overall wish ordered another pizza    Gotta love celebrity restaurants Vegas because seem all over place  Next time skip one  liked Otto Manhattan much better! <EOR> In word disappointing   another word overpriced   The hostess asked if reservations lunch    total 3 tables occupied entire restaurant don't see point such perfunctory question   fumbling computer menus host stand several minutes she led table much ennui humanly possible   Thanks warm greeting   I willing overlook retail wrapped bread sticks but unfortunately nothing redeeming followed   bread olive oil another review mentions unfortunately stars   linguini mussels poorly presented almost thought joke   looked pasta just scraped off microwave dish onto white plate   No garnish just yellowy neutral colored heap food   Really Batali?   The pizza table looked fair but CPK caliber   did little other satiate empty stomach  <EOR>
