Once figured girl behind counter asked if she could take order   started tell she turned started talking someone else     Even though only 4 people front took 15 full minutes time ordered time paid system flawed   When asked water ordered most complicated drink ever   Then course water thing empty   Waited another 25 minutes food which course came no silverware   then all food good!  husband ordered egg sandwich he said fast food restaurants better ones   frittata which came salad grilled bread   salad soaked dressing inedible   frittata no flavor   did chocolate croissant yummy give them that   Otherwise total disappointment  <EOR> The three exited based other reviews  First Ordering Process awful Order entered correctly two people Finished eating before Third Plate arrived  Sodas $ 2 00 per 12 OZ Bottle tea those fruity teas sold Big Lots because no else would it  While place excellent Bread far above average everything else average best  Pulled Pork Overcooked Under sauced raw carrot sticks sandwich Cilantro Couscous side  Corn Chowder looks tastes canned Whole Corn Half Half added  Quiches forget it  Pompous menu desperate need rework service needs Capable Trained employees even refill Tea chore can't think any reason place it  base Great Breads deserts muffins Danishes but nothing them stand out   Management seems lack Vision place great  <EOR> Excellent service!

<EOR> Hi brunch time burrito egg pork   not good  hubby captain America said really good   bought some bakery items  palmier great  almond croissant really good said own croissant dough   better bakery sugar bee's bakery southwest buys croissants frozen pramel   macaroons good but sure flavor was? never macaroon soft tender that   delicious   only 1 25   definitely back almond croissant       <EOR> Had first lunch yesterday  excited because sounded great  First think taken advice people because customer service better mentioned below  took time ask order some unknown reason but very nice considerate  asked if wanted keep dessert until done since taking home  way wouldn't refrigeration  server brought over sandwiches silverware  She very attentive brought samples breads over  amazing bread but disappointed lunch overall  ordered Turkey Brie Meatloaf sandwiches  expected more flavor Turkey Brie  guess because expected tasted fig jam description  OK  Meatloaf monstrous but OK  think cumin overpowers flavor? But course bread fantastic  took home Cannoli Cupcake Johnny Curtis  Cannoli Cupcake disappointed  cannoli shell dipped chocolate but filling just frosting cream  cannoli filling ricotta whipped cream etc   cupcake more basic dense muffin special  cupcake  Someone said angel food but yesterday  Maybe changed it? Johnny Curtis looked amazing! Two fat slices lemon blueberry loaf frosting middle  frosting sandwich! But frosting wasn't special just sweet wondered if premade frosting? nice homemade cream cheese frosting would great   would enjoyed slice more without frosting  would come back purchase bread but probably meal again  want give them chance other pastries but visually impress something first  visually impressed ordered but outcome just little disappointing  <EOR> THe GF area running some errands before breakfast mood try something recommended off yelp app   say Lulu's thought would give try  Located side Metro Pizza very cafe sort feel it   menu sort cafe feel it   service friendly hustling   LB B IHOP   does resemble any type breakfast joint would find side highway   LB B more bakery greasy spoon   If looking light breakfast carbohydrate charged fare then it  <EOR>
