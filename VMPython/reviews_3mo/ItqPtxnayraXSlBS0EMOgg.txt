Chef perfected french onion soup according husband he french trained later learned why give try   littles appreciated smiley face ketchup accompanied grilled cheese baby boy loved vegan coconut carrot pancake even though he can't talk pretty sure lack anything left sure sign   With restaurant just opening couple things available sure visit coming weeks give those try well  Until then    <EOR> MTO Cafe just opened 1 00pm Oct  22nd timing 1st three reviews little suspicious  cafe smaller side but well designed welcoming  ordered Skuna Bay Salmon wrap which expected  wrap eggs which listed description salmon eggs cooked together  expecting something more wrap version lox bagels  Aside fact think other people would combination  $12 wrap would expected include chips fries but didn't also ordered side fries    which where unseasoned floppy     Overall nice another dining option downtown but think MTO Cafe little pricey side breakfast lunch offerings  interesting see over time  <EOR> An oasis tastiness downtown Vegas!  Easy find park parking garage right above cheap $3   PLus easy walk Smith Center     The menu seemingly small but confounding many yummy dishes   just opened but twice     I loved Chicken Waffles which never tried before killer omelettes pancakes   Then there's Fat Elvis   French Toast bacon peanut butter nutella bananas   good   hash browns going until realized crispy outside stuffed mashed potatoes inside   Wow   Definitely must stop when dealing anything downtown   just because want check evolving scene    <EOR> Promptly seated served engaged Wait Staff  High marks   Ordered Hen House Wrap w side order fries  moment humor when person took order asked if wanted wrap omelet wrap  Hey busy he trying hard   The wrap good  would better if more chicken  wasn't much chicken wrap sells $14  supposed sliced tomato according person took order but sadly not   I chalk problems start iris  certain things better soon  <EOR> I came MTO Cafe second day opened  Bonnie C  am confused reviews place before opened  reviewers don't mention soft opening      Anywho must say very excited check place since another place eat lunch downtown always welcome  But case say left little sad    I checked menu before heading over eye couple items  promptly seated brought drinks while friend perused menu checked décor  place looks great nice big windows 50's diner meets modern bistro vibe  ordered Queso Carne per menu skirt steak velveeta cheese red wine drunken onions  waitress said wrap  friend ordered Tree Hugger quinoa veggies  waitress asked friend if he wanted any sides friend said no  When she brought dish saw LITERALLY just quinoa patty  No bread no sides  What?!? Granted she did ask if he wanted side but if she specified diminutive dish he might've ordered something else  dish came hamburger bun which really good btw wrap waitress said  fries which fresh tasty although menu did specify came fries    I think should bit consistency menu some dishes come side others don't? burger ok meat wasn't really skirt steak more little cubes meat  think meals overpriced  left feeling bit deflated    I back give them another try breakfast because seen pictures dishes look larger lunch dishes  <EOR> I now twice last week   Once breakfast once brunch   LOVE PLACE!
