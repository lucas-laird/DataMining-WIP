Javier's pretty new restaurant Aria absolutely gorgeous   Think upscale old macabre carvings candlelight dark wood   Sit horseshoe shaped booths if very romantic!  They started chips salsa chips still hot salsa perfection!  tell lot place salsa   wish could tried cocktail and suppose could have but noon still hadn't morning coffee   hindsight cocktail   Chips salsa + coffee = weird   Chips salsa + margarita = just right     My man Cabo Azul combination plate filched more few bites   Just right touch seafood sauces!  chile relleno picadillo also delicious   beans rice afterthought stood own right seasoning flavor   Loved it! <EOR> This place DELICIOUS!!! stayed Aria ate 3 6 meals here! chips salsa set tone any Mexican restaurant opinion  place does disappoint department! Crispy extra crunchy chips very flavorful spicy salsa    One meal seafood nachos next seafood quesadillas lastly seafood enchilada trio   Yes seafood galore know  But fresh tasty  bar location perfect grab bite sit dining area relax    I don't understand why some people think place pricey  pay prices Chicago  portions seemed normal small  Perhaps just various demographics but recommended place anyone would listen even some wouldn't!   I know place Southern Cali its just good Vegas  must if you're staying Aria check if just area  definitely back! <EOR> Only if taste buds eyes   place astonishing! Love white walls dark woods dark leather accent wrought iron  All some kind Moroccan architecture ogival arches hanging ropes imitating giant draperies  There's also largest chainsaw carved piece art hanging walls suppose tell history Mayans but all saw skeletons scattered all over maybe tells Mayan present past  still     a real feast eyes! place where would probably find most interesting man world having lunch!       ordered Dos Equis asked menu   The food     where start? Oh yes! chips salsa course  first rule tell if restaurant committed quality chips  Room temperature chips = corner cutting restaurant  Warm chips = extra mile restaurant  Well happy inform chips only warm also crispy tasty!  before adding salsa!    now great    really hoping something different menu since looking place obvious Javier wants set himself apart most typical Mexican restaurants but unlike decor menu Javiers boring any taco shop menu town  fair serve steaks some vegetarian items but you'll pay that!  Yes prices little bit high Mexican restaurant  Carne asada 50 00 filete ladrillo 60 00 filete antiguo 45 00 but everyone else says    strip!      don't care just don't buy silver pay gold!   oh yes paid more food before but stuff couldn't pronounce definitely Mexican restaurant   call el cheapo but skipped those items settled taco enchilada chile relleno combo  Food came kinda warm almost cold even though plate felt hotter food which didn't understand but hungry warm enough edible ate but shouldn't acceptable those prices    Service kinda slow  wait between beers order place wasn't busy time  think saving energy rush hour something  didn't mind time since wasn't hurry also gave time take some pictures  but end although think food good but nothing would way if something would through rolled hundred dollar bill  would probably try again but only if area    complaint     Javier what's music?  stuff would listen Mariana's supermarket while pushing shopping cart broad acres swap meet while bite into elote  sure come something little bit more original  some Mana Sin Banderas play some pandora    and rid all those eight tracks! In conclusion  place gets 3 5 stars opinion  food decent place beautiful staff working time    if only taste buds eyes    100th review!     *opens champagne* <EOR> The decor really beautiful but food ok  chips very plain  dark see menu waiter actually gave small flashlight see it   chicken quesadilla pretty good but over all little disappointing   won't back  <EOR> The e nothing particularly wrong Javier's  Thee nothing particularly outstanding Javier's  location convenient staff friendly however appeared staffing thin both occasions dined here  dishes good but warranting new National Holiday  enjoyed same quality variety lower price points less noise  <EOR> I never Javier's due location east coast   husband suggested good place try casual dinner while Vegas last week   best Mexican food ever had!  We walked without reservation did wait table   great   quickly greeted water chips salsa   salsa fresh delicious husband did even mind cilantro he usually hates cilantro chips crunchy seemed freshly made   Granted food little expensive Mexican food but expensive Las Vegas standards   enchilada taco combo disappointed   food looked nice plate tasted even better   rice beans delicious also   strawberry margarita heaven!  My DH combo enchilada taco chille relleno   he loved every bite   he two margaritas really enjoyed them   Apparently restaurant known margaritas   bartenders busy making them could tell whole restaurant happy them!

Im Süden der USA gibt es viele Einwanderer aus Mexiko  Spanisch ist daher ein recht geläufige Sprache dieser Region  Im Javier's ist ein Großteil des Personals südlicher Abstammung und wir konnten uns den ganzen Abend mit unserem Ober Raul auf spanisch unterhalten  Er fand es großartig dass Deutsche seiner Muttersprache mächtig waren und überschüttete uns mit Komplimenten Ansprachen Empfehlungen  ein Wortschwall folgte dem anderen  Das war uns dann doch etwas zu viel der ansonsten gepriesenen amerikanischen Servicekultur  Grundsätzlich ist das Javier's hochpreisig  Da es aber die mexikanische Küche erlaubt Fingerfood und kleine Gerichte zu kombinieren kann man gut und reichlich essen und trotzdem nicht das Gefühl haben über Gebühr finanziell strapaziert zu werden   Trinken tut man am besten ein Bier das ist nicht nur günstig im Vergleich zu den teuren Weinen es schmeckt auch und die Auswahl Marken ist immens  Traditionsbewusst wählten wir ein mexikanisches Bier  Perfekt gekühlt ohne eiskalt zu sein wie ansonsten oft den Staaten  Tequilas gibt es dutzende verschiedene Marken  Hochwertige Sorten die selten zu bekommen sind  Eine gute Gelegenheit sie auszuprobieren  Außerdem rühmt sich das Javier's für seine handgeschüttelten Margaritas  Wir haben dies nicht ausprobiert aber den Nachbartischen wurden fleißig und akrobatisch die Mixbecher geschüttelt  Fazit High end cuisine  wirbt das Javier's von sich  Stimmt! Wer einen mexikanisch angehauchten Abend authentischer Umgebung verbringen möchte hier ist man richtig  Tischreservierung abends empfehlenswert  Vier Sterne  <EOR> So beautiful! love decor! best mexican food ever but ambiance drinks haha <EOR> Went birthday dinner weekend decided try Javier's  say disappointed experience  Food so so definitely over priced small portions  Location beautiful decor breath taking  Margaritas cost $15 but probably best thing dinner  <EOR>
