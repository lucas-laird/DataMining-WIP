rip off   Don't expect resturant last long    which such pity   Love Spanish food especially tapas including Serrano ham tomato bread course sepia la plancha which EVERY menu restaurants Spain  Last two items menu!!  As friends know travel lot Spain have house told resturant asked thought        Well is  resturant nicely laid spacious except table   which facing kitchen right beside waiter station!!! Sangria just ok   Costco's sells better bottle  gazpacho soup good any Spain but unfortunately same cannot said calamari tapas  really don't know describe taste!! coating them slightly spicy taste chorizo!! size price   very small very pricey!!  For main dish ordered mixed paella  again very pricey very very small  waiter told enough two people   no wasn't  just enough person!!! Very very skimpy shell fish plus only 2 small pieces chicken 2 slices chorizo   Really!! table next 4 people paella also dish exactly same size ours!!  should seen portions each got    I bet McDonalds after!!   However taste rice wasn't bad but could done more saffron    BUT SHOCK NIGHT        when received check!!!  $9 bottle water!!!!   sparkling but flat   I know water shortage Las Vegas but seriously!!    I such high hopes resturant staff nice including manageress Spain whom sure horrified passes Spanish food resturant  can't understand some rave reviews resturant except say don't know any better    Please don't think snobbish or cheap   it's just know food Resturant business!!! NO professional food critics   we just live eat eat live!! NO ever going back nor recommending anyone  I'm great believer saying Happy something tell few   Unhappy tell everyone!! <EOR> First all surely hope management reads Yelp reviews because am only aiming constructive criticism   We very happy dine here  rating place 2 stars because location beautifully decorated line staff especially amazing   The downside food  eat nice restaurants least once week but top also cook avidly both hospitality business  said feel food quite insulting  The fried calamari sloppy sangria tasted water didn't see any filet items menu whether beef chicken although good protein options paellas   I think more menu items need added executive chef needs take some steps avoid sloppy plates making way tables  honestly find better value Firefly when looking Tapas  <EOR> To start want preface place pretty much empty when arrived   Sat Bar  Bartender seemed preoccupied  He then proceeded set ups Bar  Finally asking would drink   asked margarita being happy hour he said no  then showed post today FB page indicating margaritas mojitos happy hour menu    order dates took forever prepare  Having finally ask them  arrived  3 dates   Very pricey should say don't get   The owner executive chef Wynn   Shame employees same passion talent he has   Destined fail  <EOR> If you've ever paid $100 per person more gotten food service much worse then you'll understand bargain Tapas Stratta is  paid more gotten less many times big name Strip restaurants Twist Guy Savoy Giada Mix Andre's many others  Compared Strip restaurants prices lower nobody town does tapas paella better!  On other hand if want huge portions low prices somewhere else  Cheesecake Factory Chili's  negative reviews all something common people looking cheap eats don't understand prices actually very reasonable quality get   Alex Stratta no dummy course  neighborhood restaurant he knows things different he used Strip  heard he's lowered prices significantly already he's made lots menu changes he learns customers like   The paella main attraction absolutely first rate  haven't paella Spain but best places New York Tapas Stratta just good  helps if ask them extra crispy supposed which many people don't know  If rice caramelized almost point being burnt develops terrific nutty flavor   We've half items menu 4 visits  flavors wonderful bold chef keen eye presentation  traditional tapas very well executed  plenty choose often daily specials well   The wine list isn't huge but well chosen  Service friendly attentive atmosphere very nice especially outdoor patio  excellent experiences every time we'll definitely back regularly!  People seem love restaurant hate it  Those love appreciate quality understand kind food isn't available anywhere else town  Those hate well they're looking something else plenty cheap mediocre restaurants them to  Tapas Stratta foodie heaven if  you're looking please enjoy! <EOR> Twice two weeks says place want succeed  tapas nice combo traditional original  service attentive but struggle bit logistics  sangria refreshing  working hit its stride  Getting bit bit  <EOR> I've said before tell lot restaurant Happy Hour   I know Alex Stratta but believe he likely become friends  Why? Because Tapas Tivoli Village well crap!  For those would elaborate let say slowly sinks in Happy Hour Coors Light $6 it works better if read very slowly     ARE F   ING KIDDING ME?  That's right $6 worst beers planet Happy hour prices!   The food Happy Hour menu starts $5 all way $36  Remember tapas i e  small plates getting slapped face your own wallet still leaving hungry  punch line joke open 5 Happy Hour ends 6  Yes whole hour but don't see anyone very happy it  fact lost patrons could count them all hand   And biggest joke all food even good fact bad  calamari undercooked tasted dry flour  am certain must something doesn't taste kissed Pillsbury Dough Boy but prices hardly afford stick around find out   The few workers came contact did look happy perhaps because place nearly empty   A quick look menu tell everything need know place expensive  Don't bother cracking open piggy bank one   P S  Walk little further down way Kabuki Happy Hour actually happy  <EOR> Took back Spain  rock shrimp empanadas bacalhau seafood paella  Thoroughly enjoyed experience food delicious  also extensive wine list option small wine tastings each dish  <EOR>
