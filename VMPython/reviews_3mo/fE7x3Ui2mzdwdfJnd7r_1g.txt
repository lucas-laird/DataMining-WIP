I walking through Caesars Palace noticed Earl Sandwich Forum Food Court  help myself Full Montagu side Mac Cheese  think first time sandwich wheat bread  bad somewhat slightly health conscious people vacation! little disappointed sandwich lot smaller ones served Earl Planet Hollywood across street I same sandwich late night location   felt Caesars location little skimpy meat well vegetables  Mac Cheese pretty good  sure hold off eating quickly because super hot oven    I noticed loaded baked potatoes menu location which isn't available PH location  Potato lovers eat your heart out!  Fountain drinks cost almost $5! sure empty bladder enough refills!  If Total Rewards players card you'll able $1 off your sandwich  unfortunately didn't card pay extra dollar   The staff really friendly since just opened there's probably still few kinks need work like sandwich size   back soon! <EOR> Best Earl's location !!   Reasonably priced sandwiches they're good around $7 9 My favorite Full Montague Chipotle Chicken Sandwich also good  Eat Tabasco if wanna add little more flavor  Sometimes sandwich could taste little dry  <EOR> Boy pleasant surprised when found Caesar's Palace just opened food court included Earls! always down Planet Hollywood location anytime Vegas saves long walk! new food court located right next Forum Shops  great thing location offer wheat bread $1 off your total rewards card  lines also long compared over Planet Hollywood location  plenty seating new food court huge    Earls definitely favorite sandwich place! usually Chipotle Chicken boyfriend usually gets Full Montagu  sandwiches hot toasty bread perfect combination crunchy soft  tomato soup pretty good well  price point $6 $8 pretty good amount food getting especially usual marked Vegas prices!

I decided order soup Broccoli cheddar 1492 sandy brown bread  soup very think cheesy very small bits broccoli  average side okay but nothing stellar 2 75 5  sandwich not huge actually decently good healthy serving roast beef creamy horseradish sauce  Expectations lowered I'd say adequately content but wouldn't consider memorable meal  Overall solid 3 5   Personally prefer Jimmy Johns Firehouse subs  Earl Sandwich more Earl Ordinary me! <EOR> Went Ceasar's Palace last weekend lunch new food court  $8 50 sandwich definitely Vegas prices but comparable Jersey Mike's similar sub places  roast beef parents full Montague  All pleased  Crusty warm bread such delight  Didn't break bank  But buffets later  Staff exceptionally professional courteous despite some rude customers top notch  <EOR> The rude lady takes orders pleasantly told SPECIFIC location discontinued serving caprese sandwich  WTF  Awful service rude lady veggie sandwich place caprese gross    Bring back caprese plz <EOR>
