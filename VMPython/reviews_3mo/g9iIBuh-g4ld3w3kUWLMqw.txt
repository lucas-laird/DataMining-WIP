  He says no   She away comes back 2 minutes later tells sandwich given another table would take five minutes new one   UGH!!!  At point did want wait five minutes  no guarantee would only take five minutes if took 10 minutes? asked cancel whole order   told touch salad because wanted eat same time boyfriend  She said OK left   BTW don't blame waitress wasn't brought food  <EOR> So pizza joint Tivoli Village once upon time   they didn't put quality product location where mattered   oh guess they're back same level quality   only time just might survive off tourists bar hoppers   I neighborhood needed some food   friends saw something new open next Insert Coins   thought we'd check out   wish hadn't   pizza just okay service many issues   left hand never seemed figure right hand doing whole time there   If end product great I'd give them another shot improve service all haven't open all long   no reason stop back here   I'd rather drive few mins walk little farther something want   If find yourself however and set staying seems BBQ Pizza Parm Fries might way yo go  <EOR> Mediocre pizza best  expecting more    Replace canned toppings fresh put less salt sauce   PBR warm   Staff friendly    Bus boy kept putting dirty dishes counter where eating  <EOR> I waiting Radio City Pizza open downtown cause work area  happy finally open location great spot  already twice 1 week  bartender St  Patricks day awesome made great shot  lunch today service great waitress awesome personalilty  If love pizza should try place definatly going back  Even around lunch time place packed food timely manner  <EOR> Pizza GOOD!!! Customer service UGH   My friend saw place opening months ago very excited try it  always happy hour downtown Vanguard figured would perfect place grab bite pizza drinking  assumed they'd offer pizza slice because pretty much every pizza joint Downtown does   Upon entering noted hostess stand outside but no hostess walked in  space SMALL  soon walked already pizza place  no area stand around look fool if don't know where you're going  Luckily hostess would turn into waitress arrived   She asked if two said yes she seated restaurant section which basically right next bar section    decor nicely set except fact overload televisions  every single them basketball  friend came conclusion space over Tivoli Village must bigger just weren't willing give all those flat screens hey just put 'em everywhere  Seriously guys lose some TVs  Your customers miss them   The night offering limited menu upfront which nice  least didn't through full menu decide something did have  BUT disappointed see menu offered no option just ordering slice  over decided order 18 Viva Las Vegas which pepperoni meat can't remember right now onions yellow peppers white sauce  All specialty pizzas sound really good would back try more  Sometimes places specialty pizzas you're WTF? No  But RCP really good sounding concoctions   Our pizza comes looks delicious smells delicious  dig right in  First off crust for perfect crunchy but nice chewy texture good NY style pizza  toppings salty sweet just made wonderful little pizza goodness opera mouth   Then comes downfall whole experience       We noted pizza cut completely  slices actually should two slices one  picked bigger face naturally just asked if could pizza cut  waitress then laid lovely little explanation insult us  Well Dominos Pizza Hut NY style pizza bigger you're used to  EXCUSE ME? friend aghast haughty little waitress took pizza away cut Dominos style peasant liking apparently   Instead just cutting pizza she insults us  Nice touch   And know what? Dominos Pizza Hut there  Oh way if there's food know pretty much everything PIZZA! certainly know NY style slice pizza looks like  Okay? Pizza langauge fucking pizza all right? just cut fucking pizza   I want back try more but obviously Dominos ass should stay home order pizza delivered  <EOR> Pizza pretty good once right one  Price right product given tourist environment  waitress hot mess   Ordered 3 beers coke  2 beers 1 coke  Asked other beer yes way if 3rd beer comes special place near other 2 beers  Ordered half pepperoni half sausage  half pepperoni half mushroom food runner  Said wrong pizza  5 minutes later waitress brought same wrong pizza  another 20 minutes correct pizza  Never once asked if wanted more drinks over hour only saw waitress bring pie check  table behind ready walk getting wrong pizza 3 times manager came table stayed  sure if anything offered them  Manager never came table  guess used wrong orders doesn't constitute table visit   In general tourists locations Vegas crap service didn't surprise me  <EOR> We greeted awesome young lady sold brand   Unfortunately while waiting table owner manager made comments party leaning against jukebox   free jukebox play    if ask them turn IPod down   question managers why would offer something free if came restrictions said choice!!  choice leave!!  understand conceptual values but made no sense!!   Good luck!  spend hard earned money here! <EOR> I'm happy there's nice little restaurant addition Le Thai hipster alley Fremont!  place really nice food good decently priced!  other hand issue TVs around whole place   TVs totally fine sports bar but volume high!  wasn't even big game     all bunch highlights   When isn't game figured TVs should turned down music should turned     but loud!  felt yelling friend     which isn't okay restaurant  <EOR> The bbq chicken pizza amazing  only place vegas seen sierra nevada torpedo tap only 5 bucks! menu changes daily well which dope! <EOR> Visited last week group friends town March Madness  Great Pizza joint!! thrilled all TV's didn't miss any games    We wings garlic knots Viva Las Vegas pizza  Can't remember exactly but pie bomb!' Friendly service cheap beer back patio space very cool  weather great night perfect set up    Positive recommend sure  Downtown needed badly <EOR> Don't waste your time unorganized mess restaurant    Made reservation hostess restaurant reservation never put in  Then wait 20 minutes table  sit 5 ppl 4top table takes 12 minutes anyone come take drink order even greet telling minute  Just anyone hasn't seen restaurant maybe 10 tables inside seating    Service staff front staff unorganized really just want slap them  Poor management starting owner  If going comp someone then still take care them paying guest   I told waitress rather pay then meal comped even though whole place horrible     The only reason place might well because tourists fact pizza place across street sucks worse  Grimaldi's avoid crap mess restaurant is   Service horrible food average no big deal management sucks  Only good thing bar staff  <EOR> Great place start casual night out  grab some pizza some drinks   DJ Friday awesome    Ciroc Vodka well vodka stop grab $5 dollar vodka soda some fun! <EOR> I really liked restaurant   food delicious  service good food arrived fast  visited restaurant last Friday  We sat back patio area  brought 8 month old son plenty room stroller  server busy but he still took good care us   The ONLY reason giving 5 stars because didn't high chairs  <EOR> After first experience food good but service    ditzy  Does anyone works know they're doing? figured they'd just transitioned new downtown location needed work some kinks  issues weren't bad enough wouldn't come back decided give them second chance    Second chance called order go  Just large pepperoni pizza nothing difficult  girl phone sounded super confused she didn't know going husband even commented he worried we'd would problem order  tell them called order 5 people working all look around each other say didn't take order   telling them Someone answered phone because placed order girl comes back said she took order  She handed pizza didn't say anything  ask owed  She looked lost confused she pills  rest staff then tried overcompensate being phony friendly which wasn't going buy since girls cell phone texting wouldn't look us    Overall food isn't bad but sure worth dealing incompetent staff  may give them final chance before writing them off altogether  <EOR> I love love LOVE RCP! over LEAST two three times week   Radio City Pizza must stop if your hanging Fremont East  Always open late which great night owls late nighters  website says open until stop drinking sure stop! Ciroc lines walls if lucky might shot house! Lance totally sweetie but don't try carry conversation while order because slice ordered might slice get!
