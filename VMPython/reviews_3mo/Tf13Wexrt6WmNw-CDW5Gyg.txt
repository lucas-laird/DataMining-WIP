First atmosphere really cool inside big bar middle decent sized patio which completely unused cold January night  I can't comment beer list since teetotaler days but Arnold Palmer pretty decent  Service prompt she checked regularly refills etc  The concept course 3 meatballs sauce then if want anything extra cheese pasta etc pay side  think concept cute trust slice bread 3 meatballs definitely enough fill anybody up  Overall much would expect pay plate pasta huge meatballs? Gotta $12 16 even Olive Garden right?? Well Meatball Spot pay $7 99 your 3 meatballs add $1 50 cheese $5 side pasta they couple options   husband 2 orders meatballs split side penne finished 2 3 food  really didn't consider overpriced all! Most importantly meatballs delicious! party classic beef chicken  All good but fave classic  also sampled classic tomato spicy meat sauces liked both  meat sauce very meaty which found little unnecessary considering served bunch meat  Overall would definitely recommend Meatball Spot when dining Town Square few non chain options delicious! <EOR> Wow    far worst service ever   hoping  food made lucky   food terrible but definitely nothing write home mom about   Apparently only person opinion   walked back car stopped Town Square clothing store   When mentioned experience sales people 15 minutes several bad experiences!  Also left Meatball Spot Facebook Ok Food Terrible Serveice place 11 replies agreeing!  Im saying dont just your toes demanding prompt efficient friendly service   Oh sure stalls toilet paper soap DID when there    Any them <EOR> After work Friday night coworker headed down Town Square dinner   heard many things legal issues Meatball Spot Executive Chef whom use EC famous Rao's Italian Restaurant     Decor Atmosphere I overall design establishment well light nice brick wall touch seems easily accommodate large party w kids full bar w exception lack craft beer selection 1 5 stars    Yet female co worker mention actually more disgustedly informed restroom filled w such putrid nauseating sewer like stench made completely loss appetite almost dinner    Quality Taste I ordered Classic Meatball w spicy meat sauce three meat balls side order rigatoni Garbage salad   meatballs $7 99 very tasty indeed little dry probably because prepared keep several hours   sauce very basic marinara sauce I personally think server made mistake sauce    side order rigatoni absolute JOKE $5 99 believe roughly 1 ounce pasta small bowl slightly covered tossed same spicy meat meatless sauce   Then FULL order Garbage salad $13 99 portioned maybe child not enough split yet used quality cheese salami   could ordered Salmon Salad Brio's next door would stuffed full   My coworker ordered Turkey w classic sauce three meatballs side garlic Parmesan fries  turkey meatballs great flavor but barely luke warm  fries $5 99 joke well  girl barely eat full portions anything but still hungry dinner! very disappointed portions service sitting close other guests where kept bumping into me   Service Sloooow! Oh god slow especially items listed menu   mean didn't even order pizza which would require baking time meal took over 2 hours!  Seriously pre prepared meatball sauce salad deep fried fries   server took away coworker's fork never replaced asked hot sauce several times until received ask glass water twice  Minor issues but price food quality service above par   Conclusion Would ever back?  unless someone celebrating event some sort would require go   cost meal could easily Rao's Caesar's Palace ate I mean pretty much exact same meatballs   <EOR> Best pizza Vegas   Took some friends town commented best pizza ever had  <EOR> DISAPPOINTING   Let start saying locals tourists   if good experience may repeat customers  Yeah thats going happen!  hearing much hype restaurant Vegas decided give try   last night Friday night around 7pm   expected crowded expected wait table which wasn't problem   Wait table 30 minutes but able spot bar sooner took that   First mistake taking seating bar   two girls or shall say bimbo's probably more accurately describes them behind bar personality rock!  fact rock probably more personality!  Unfriendly rarely even smile very slow   10 minutes sitting finally took drink order   Then food order   husband ordered pizza ordered Veggie meatballs gluten free pasta   20 minutes husbands pizza arrived food no where site   Keep mind girls right ordered just before received all food folks left ordered just all food   Where food   Generally when eat husband EAT TOGETHER!
