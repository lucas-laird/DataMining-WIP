The service fantastic atmosphere warm inviting   definitely great family celebration place  <EOR> I grew Birmingham AL literally worst BBQ restaurant life 39 years   If didn't grow BBQ please don't think serve Pot Liquor BBQ  Even Famous Dave's better garbage   The pulled pork cooked high temperature short time outside hard inedible fat connective tissue didn't break down supposed making interior meat also mostly inedible   They serve call Alabama Sweet Tea   tasted unsweetened tea  south sweet tea extremely sweet  understand toning down little bit those used but extremely bland  complained brought another glass different batch but same   Their sauces non descriptive names Cue #1 thru Cue #4  ask were  tried all them terrible  think #4 Alabama White Sauce   Instead being tangy thin white sauce penetrate down into meat basically 98% mayonnaise little bit seasoning  Disgusting   They couldn't basics right most rest menu consists inappropriate fancy modifications southern food  Examples include Fried Catfish Benedict Fried catfish should able stand its own  hollandaise sauce completely inappropriate  Devil'd Eggs topped deep fried chicken skin  flavor skin completely overpowered egg  Brownie Bread Pudding bread pudding already very sweet if made correctly chocolate appropriate flavor combination  Then serve sea salt vanilla gelato   If asked sea salt vanilla gelato real BBQ place south would laugh probably throw out  Fried Pies sounds pretty basic but description says served malted anglaise   heck? Strawberry Shortcake Sandwiches sounds pretty straight forward but comes strawberry cream gelato  Again gelato! Kansas City Style Burnt Ends Another staple  But shake sugar raw over top  burnt ends good but sugar made experience unpleasant  Really? put sugar meat shouldn't but can't put your sweet tea?  I told them chef needs visit Alabama learn real southern food  assured he visited Alabama spent whole 10 days there  can't learn BBQ 10 days  Good BBQ chefs spent well over 10 years learning it  Pot Liquor does serve southern BBQ any southern dishes  may try them again couple years if haven't gone business  Perhaps then found cook book learned some actual southern food  <EOR> Seriously best BBQ Las Vegas   and tried them all   ordered full rack spareribs baby back ribs moment plate arrived knew something special   Amazing quality quantity   honestly never seen much meat rib before I'd swear each given several pounds pure meat   first time able finish rack anything first sitting   not even close brought half ribs home   Much meat side dishes incredible   wife sweet potatoes plentiful topped marshmellow report best ever    both excellent green beans   Mac Cheese   wow   honestly best ever had   large cheesy creamy   We eat 99 5% meals often we're pleasantly surprised new restaurant   Well hat Pot Liquor CAS   already settled fact next time feel BBQ   this place! <EOR> I meeting friend dinner saw new bbq restaurant Town Square  super happy find prices reasonable food drink selection diverse    We started round Cucumber Corpse  refreshing drink down bit easily without being cloyingly sweet  accompanied deviled egg appetizer which topped some delightful chicken skin cracklins  Those addictive!  shared Spare Baby entree which could easily fed 4 people  pick 2 sides opted mac cheese greens  Both delicious  Finally ended fried banana split dessert which scoop each vanilla chocolate strawberry ice cream  this!

Well server rest staff just seemed panic mode  Initially when he took orders seemed he having hard time using tablet system  kept forgetting refill drinks  friends lemonade he came back sweet tea said Please tell sweet tea because lemonade  He brought boxes small fit those huge dry rub ribs  Then when came time pay seemed even flustered them more  30 minute ordeal pay   And course late movie  wish just more sense urgency   The food good come back give another try  <EOR> Only time far but really good  Good appetizers salads BBQ drinks  definitely check again sometime  Cool vibe inside bar tv's etc plus town square plenty things area  would recommend checking out! <EOR> Seems tourist trap  Overpriced food  Atmosphere great  Service great  Unfortunately food great  Won't back  <EOR> Good quality BBQ decent price good atmosphere kind contemporary brewery meets sports bar meets BBQ odd music choices  Almost identity crisis somehow works  service friendly but SLOW  BBQ which already smoked should come quickly! seated 6 05 pm check also slow coming finally arrived around 8 30 pm! Most time spent waiting food check  ate quickly because two kids tow  also never brought those warm wet washcloths wipe your hands wash hands BBQ sauce off hands  That being said ribs meaty delicious subtle hint smoke  sweet sauce good but vinegar sauce astringent  fries weren't great luke warm hard but Alabama sauce really good  succotash ok used corn cut off cob  Pulled pork standard  burnt ends little tough but came local pickles cool Wonder bread type bread slices  Why?? five year old son complained mac cheese tasted wondering could wrong mac cheese suspiciously Velveeta esque  Overall meat good quality but skimped some sides  Lucille's better worth extra drive unless just want trendy place hang out  <EOR> I really conflicted when writing review  party 12 birthday only server table several other tables well  know big parties pain ass but reservation restaurant wasn't packed  took 30 minutes first round drinks  few appetizers some didn't even show til mid entree  sides entrees didn't show until done eating  Now being said food actually quite tasty  hotlinks ribs delicious  sure if just management scheduling right new server boot  Someone dined before said took long time them eat well  All all meal took 2 hours 45 minutes  would back but probably won't If would small group  <EOR> My husband Friday couple drinks apps bar   ordered deviled eggs which just ok   burnt ends burnt just pile fat   also order pork rinds menu states chili lime salt which could taste all   drinks ok bartenders seem panic mode trying measure every ounce   may back try something dinner menu but no rush  <EOR> Delicious! town Salt Lake City stranger recommended place  Thank stranger!
