Recommend Passionfruit pineapple snow ice passion fruit green tea steak!!!! <EOR> A flaw mine usually know rationalize spread joys life  When all out  string reviews did happen series days but all one   I some time kill getting haircut before pick sister  Vetoing gym day relaxation little did know would fall far off bandwagon  started ordering large Grapefruit Green Tea Aloe Vera $5 00 thinking would 24oz serving but came mug puts Hofbrauhaus shame  tea bold bitter all  grapefruit flavor light sweet  aloe vera large chunks came generous portion  Then next step where horribly wrong  ordered Rose Yogurt $3 75   Little did know another drink  thought going frozen yogurt since bottom page lined pictures creamy treat  When employees asked if wanted wait little thrown off but should clue  Rose Yogurt reminded those little bottles yogurt drink  use Asian supermarkets  ok  would totally stick teas    The best part folly bad since running special  Until December 7th tomorrow doing half off drinks if check Facebook them  both drinks came five dollars some change    The staff nice but language barrier  don't speak Chinese but barista kept talking Chinese  waitress roughly translated gist it  previously stated great place late night boba action since open until 2am  <EOR> Still just average terms drinks   but review night time crowd   Very young teenager high school kids hanging out     so if adult   you may want find different location socializing evening time  <EOR> Service quick   boba tea ordered expected   waitresses eager greet serve customers maybe because only time    Anyway menu does remind boba chains California also Tea Station Tea Planet   back some food refreshments   Updates come   For now would give 3 5 star  <EOR> Went first time today  wasn't busy all  Only two other tables two  sat quickly but another 15 minutes before decided time take order  Even though tried waving them over couple times    After servers took order   two minutes later another server came take order  told already ordered  safe say need better communication    For whatever reason took them another 7 minutes drink  two others party drinks pretty quickly    So over all 22 minutes simple drink? mediocre that? No thanks    The food looks good but thank god didn't order it    might've another hour   Would back? probably would try food    but only if someone else wanted first  won't suggest place friends  <EOR> Very new place   employees still seem bit lost  didn't know add ons available menu  Regardless following Papaya coconut milk Fresh frozen papaya which nice instead syrup  tasted quite good though papaya taste bit faint  Good idea though   Milk tea Normal but actually quite delicious  Your average light milk tea   Green tea no sugar pudding grass jelly Green tea normal green tea   no floral scents jasmine it  pretty average nothing special  Grass jelly didn't much flavor but real complaint PUDDING  honestly felt mixed sugar CHALK  consistency chalky gritty barely sweet! also even bit SALTY! bad ask them another drink without pudding! PUDDING   Anyway overall I'd still rather tea station  tea much better toppings  <EOR> come 3 days week since its grand opening  Extremely love place thousand time beats any boba tea shop Vegas  portion  huge price very reasonable P love ice mix  fruit bowl popcorn chicken   freaking food  strongly recommend place everyone <EOR> Great prices  Friendly service  Great tasting boba tea  more ask Asian establishment fan <EOR> This going new place at  always going some flavor shaved ice along appetizer  think fits well together  usually eat something dry something wet balance each other out  If mean   Anywho pick type snow ice there's multiple toppings then pick flavor ice  There's 3 types milk green tea mango  If chance try all 3 see which prefer  only tried milk flavor   It's different shaved ice Cali Class 302 example   sticky Cali ones aren't this  way probably best you'll Vegas  shaved ice Cali amazing  But snow ice sure if difference matters   yet    The 3 dishes managed deep fried squid Taiwanese sausage fried tempura all pretty good  surprised  also really cold second visit decided hot drink coconut milk tea I usually cold version VERY yummy  love it  Coconut isn't most people's thing flavor want  But loved it  yummy  definitely getting again again  If drinks lot stamp card  prices add up   The service friendly  easy call them over just let them know need something  probably cause they're new place service isn't crappy at least none had   going end trying all food menu  They've also different flavors toast! If your thing give try   Definitely give place chance  There's some grand opening specials right now  them 10% off to go drinks  also $15 credit card limit  Bring cash  <EOR> New fobtastic hangout?

There's nothing extraordinary  serve boba size though  serve Asia snacks  service very Asia Asia  place looks typical  But still hangout chill conversation friends here   Nothing bad nothing good place but leading more toward good  Four stars! <EOR> prices cheaper tea planet station  It clean environment  <EOR> Icy Juicy open few weeks now area decided forgo normal boba spots give them try   There two other customers when walked already seated food  All wanted drink walked right cashier order  took 3 people ring order apparently some confusion properly charge boba honeydew milk tea  maybe language barrier  don't know but ordering process certainly could smoother    Total came $5 68  waitress didn't say anything paid    stood few minutes feeling awkward way  couple minutes decided sit down wondering deal was   A full ten minutes later drink ready  tasted gritty likely due instant creamer used  cup normal lid fancy seal come expect boba tea shops    Overall am pretty unimpressed  just far many places area where better tasting drinks same price less better service then received Icy Juicy  next one    <EOR> Pretty good place boba  San Gabriel Valley area California!  Additions such boba lychee jelly clear jelly grass jelly etc $0 50  Upgrading large extra $1 00  I ordered large peach green tea boba which came $5 00 flat excluding tax    You never wrong peach green tea right! drink wasn't sweet bland  Although mint green tea wasn't good Le Arbre's still tasty   The fried food fries chicken delicious very generous spicy powder  Definitely good tea house place! workers patient friendly even though near closing time  <EOR> I discovered place Yelp thank fellow yelpers! decided give try    Having snow ice LA pleasantly surprised find place Las Vegas also offers delicious refreshing dessert  fresh fruit mochi toppings good  service good owner nice ask feedback seems appreciate your patronage   I'm going lie  little FOB y Chinese to English translations top sales instead best sellers  sala instead salad but tend overlook things because snow ice which comes green tea taro mango milk flavors good  told food good but haven't tried any yet take advantage free drink lunch entree offer next time   I would rate place solid 4 stars maybe little more  only wish offered even more authentic Taiwanese toppings rice balls fresh taro which could also used hot grass jelly   would definitely elevate 5  <EOR> Another decent place Boba Vegas ! wanted just grab drink but set pretty awkward  sit down table despite fact just wanted drink go then pay bill table hrm tip 20% freaking boba drink carried 5 feet?     Despite drinks pretty good  Thai Iced tea boba  Tons tons boba good quality  Drink itself just ok  hard justify going back many other options neighborhood! <EOR> Came place dessert great meal Soyo again because hearing good things place  Ordered monster style toast  good but $12 99 good  mean glorified honey toast Ichiza Shuseki $7 strawberry kiwi whipped cream two vanilla chocolate sticks minus honey  don't mind paying good food but cut strawberry 2 slices Kiwi whipped cream 2 crunchy yummy sticks really worth $5 99 more? $9 99 would reasonable would garnered them 3 star    Service wasn't bad but merely non existent  Pretty full place Wed night seemed 3 guys working but only capable taking orders bringing check  ask both  <EOR> Cute little place next Cue D's  Came check place catch friends  offer wi fi [ ordered green apple green tea grass jelly  Sounds weird right? Even guy took order asked if sure  tasted good though  sweet  When friends arrived ordered minced pork rice crispy chicken rice fried tofu  minced pork meh    crispy chicken average  didn't fried tofu but might because tried when soggy ] end ordered monster styled toast  good but definitely worth price  guess okay since took 4 finish it  staff friendly place clean  Overall decent place some drinks  <EOR> I'm glad place opened valley decent boba drinks prices off roof unlike Tea Station   recognized face when walked boba dude Tea Station now there   now shopping 168 don't need past Tea Station Volcano  back more drinks near future! <EOR> The drinks really good cheaper price other places  ordered Honey Green Tea tastes good  rewards program ordered 9 drinks 10th worth free drink value $2 75  10th drink just pay difference if buy something above $2 75   The staff very friendly  just patient explain them order if don't seem understand  Also place opens 11a m 2a m  always find parking here  would definitely recommend place  <EOR> I'm glad place opened because decent Taiwanese food scarce place good Taiwanese food comparing other places town  <EOR>
