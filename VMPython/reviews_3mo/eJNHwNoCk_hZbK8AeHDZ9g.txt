FIRST REVIEW!!  Came lunch opening day  place legit absolutely delicious but expect food coma afterwards   The setup inside very similar Chipotle next door  Tortilla maker front all food prepared before your very eyes    I ordered chicken ribs combo  order over drink station where greeted tons BBQ sauces nots  cucumber salsa thing really good   The chicken moist tender ribs  fall off bone which prevented being 5 star joint  prefer fall off bone   Bathrooms clean safe use   I'd def come back  <EOR> The delicious fresh grilled chicken know crave Sahara location now another new location! Staff friendly online ordering delivery    Menu chicken ribs salads wraps wings hot cold sides same usual   only difference really bigger cleaner space   My favorite three piece chicken two sides but never mind which sides because they're all good  Unfortunately first visit forgot two sides ordered  <EOR> Stopped during Aug 1st official grand opening but sadly didn't arrive time grab $25 gift cards giving away first 50 customers  excited try chicken because heard lot other location also 30% off grand opening special  Rachel opted 3 piece dark full rack ribs sides mac cheese  ordering process kind drags along because while line right front line where food prepped sides displayed scooped wait until registers place your order  Why Chipotle Cafe Rio where order your food watch made moves along? mean all right front you   but digress     Anyways back track  Once order pay you're given number place your table they'll deliver food right similar Smashburger Jason's Deli  chicken juicy skin flavorful well seasoned  mac cheese bleh no taste whatsoever! even real cheese there? Even box Kraft mac cheese more flavor WTF! ribs decent some good flavor seasoning but tell just grilled smoked because hard off bone some parts little overcooked  Decent nonetheless but $21 99 per rack wouldn't worth without some sort discount   The staff all very nice although some cashiers seemed confused during ordering process attention always focused transaction  whole store seemed very hectic but  typically nature new business hopefully some experience everything run much more smoothly future! <EOR> This location located right next Chipotle busy Arroyo shopping plaza  visited establishment opening day since group co workers excited give try  never visited Sahara location first time trying out  obvious 1st day hiccups  example cashiers stressed forgetting items trying best can't knock em' that missing items orders table most corrected     I ordered 1 4 Chicken w two sides watermelon sweet potatoes  chicken star plate  pretty good grilled just right  watermelon fresh sweet  However sweet potato so so   also sampled co workers Mac Cheese super bland w watery cheese really bad     Pros use Organic Chicken    fresh ingredients sides like watermelon Fast relatively healthy options order pay counter sit wait food Cons sides hit miss     Sweet Potatoes Meh Mac Cheese Gross  Overall concept chicken  Perhaps site improve time hammer some opening hiccups   Also co workers all seemed enjoy meals  Thus give them solid 3 stars  would come back order chicken just picky sides would order  <EOR> Tried ribs BBQ sauce mashed potatoes chicken pasta salad really good  Coleslaw o k  side  BBQ sauce good one  <EOR> All seem eat daily chicken chicken more chicken   Maybe over exaggerating but least 3 meals each day involve chicken   being said should know good tasting chicken taste like   should know cooked chicken taste like   When Nevada Chicken Cafe opened immediately bookmarked because selection prices   week opened treated great service clean restaurant again good prices   $10 half roasted chicken side sweet potatoes   First all sweet potatoes phenomenal   would come back just this   Then chicken  Again half chicken which consists breast wing leg thigh   leg thigh good full flavor  almost instant huge fan Nevada Chicken Cafe let stress   ALMOST   all downhill once breast wing   Both looked cooked outside but raw inside   understand maybe adjustment period them  But since specialize chicken should least cooking right   ate pieces edible i e  red bloody    didn't complain bring dish back   figure they'll improve hope do   chicken dropped rating  Overall am just giving them 3 stars service menu selection prices sweet potatoes    PS ribs looked good   least looked cooked  <EOR> Great new places ribs chicken   Tender great flavor   Clean friendly services   Must try especially those days can't decide eat   <EOR> Waited more 30min food workers back eating pizza well organized   <EOR> I first tired Nevada Chicken Cafe location Sahara Ave found chicken dry side dishes unappetizing    After reading review owner Nico invited opening second location give food another try    At location stand line walk past food before placing your order register  handed young female cashier $25 gift card she said today 30% off should save card  told wanted use card today she told crazy  She seemed very inexperienced handling customers    I wanted sit inside but sewage smell bad forced sit outside very hot day  friend sampled the Breast meat more moist other location but still bland skin rubbery texture   Pulled pork sandwich first pulled pork sandwich ever seen sub sandwich bread  Pulled pork finely chopped red onions random  Mac cheese bland watery cheese tasted come packet   Baked beans artificially sweet tasted came can  Coleslaw average coleslaw better grocery store  Watermelon mediocre  Chocolate chip cookie hard ordinary   Nico busy but wanted ask inspired open soul food restaurant when culture   Overall food ordinary majority does taste homemade  <EOR> If chicken house music you'll love place   actually liked food but whoever selecting music over apparently spends evenings every club Strip just can't enough   stressed while trying enjoy food leave   If change music give place 4 stars  <EOR> So lot buzz Nevada chicken cafe office few stopped lunch  place very clean which scores lot points however enough earn more 2 stars me    I tried 1 4 chicken 2 sides  mashed potatoes gravy feta spinach pasta    First foremost chicken dry portion pretty weak  maybe just wimpy chicken others eating same thing looked much better bigger got  chicken similar but good as little rotisserie chickens buy Von's Smith's  only two things set apart said grocery store chicken Nevada Chicken cafe's chicken dryer little bit citrus taste skin    The mashed potatoes different KFC's mashed potatoes  all great    and finally pasta if feta cheese would know where was  love feta cheese could notice pasta all  actually pretty bland which very disappointing   Other food place clean staff seemed nice food quickly     I may give place more try future just lower expectations  <EOR> I Sahara location before very excited location closer home   tonight ordered half chicken full rack baby back ribs 2 sides go  When girl charged $39 almost fainted but  hoped would worth money  When home opened bags order all messed up  Instead full rack baby back ribs gave 1 2 rack dry St  louis ribs gave order rice did order chicken completely dry mean dry didn't even eat it  Last week bought chicken Costco juicy tender unlike overpriced dry stuff   only winning going dog only want eat chicken  believe girl taking order didn't quite know take orders all new location why charged much  prob  tomorrow w receipt that itemized see if charged right   Save your money chipotle next door buy rotisserie chicken grocery store  only plus  location looked nice clean  <EOR> Worst  Restaurant  Ever!!!!  The cashier knew nothing menu  asked dressing sauce Chix Pasta  She didn't know ask  asked which ribs leaner? She didn't know ask  stopped asking questions that   Ribs salty  mess mac cheese mashed potatoes? managed so  place messy employees looked disorganized service BAD  concept reminds California Chicken Cafe LA but come no where close  $30 down drain horrible meal    It hot inside sun beating down sit back area screaming kids  Definitely save your money   go Costco whole rotisserie chicken  much better! <EOR> Being fan original location Sahara Jones excited see second location near me   When first inside notice warm which uncomfortable   Once order deliver food you   person delivered food pleasant but she just put down good front people without any clue ordered quickly walked away   each delivery food shuffle correct order    The chicken good but warm best   wife's ribs tough chewy   She side corn cob which also just warm   When she asked some butter employee said she would some her   She came back side tortillas?!?   salsa also just tasted plain tomato sauce no seasoning it   gross   I hoping food would better but give another try future   Maybe fact just opened kinks need worked out  <EOR> I Hawaiian wrap w fruit salad fiance mozzarella wrap w mac cheese  thought wrap good lots flavor  fiance fan  wrap suppose balsamic olive oil but instead some sort creamy dressing maybe house dressing? He said mac cheese tasted microwaved  <EOR> Had 1 4rib leg thigh combo mashed potatoes  chicken moist crispy skin which really like  ribs little dry which covered barbecue sauce   sauce pretty good tiny bit heat  mashed potatoes nothing special  Daughter house special wrap  Nice size all fresh ingredients  Some chicken still gristle attached which fighter wasn't good  She said she wouldn't way order again  Wife chicken chile bowl much chicken more bean soup chile  If chunks chicken instead shredded maybe would better  <EOR> When hear charcoal grilled chicken know gotta good right? Damn gotta better gas grilled El Pollo Loco according cashier  Well answer depend doing cooking  case NCC failed badly   I visited southwest location located Rainbows week grand opening hoping some delicious chicken  disappointed afterward why The chicken dried way under season  Basically seasoned just outside chicken only place taste some flavor chicken skin  meat dried bland felt chewing glue instead chicken    By way place just opened restrooms nasty smelly  Good thing ate before wash hands otherwise appetite would ruined  Ewwwwwwwwww   As cashier answer is El Pollo Loco chicken does taste better <EOR> We came week first opened  waste money    two lunch spent around $30 absolutely worth it    First all didn't anything wanted  husband wanted pulled pork ran out  would helped if put sign blocked didn't have  least mention before ordered  No said anything us  Actually yes no said anything till felt ready serve us  stood register while girl running looked she having really hard day  Felt bad her  ordering food sit noticed entire place mess  used dishes lot tables floor dirty  wiped down table eat at   They brought meal wasn't anything ordered  ordered ribs combo he ordered chicken combo  both two ribs chicken served us  most unflattering manner  tried fixed guy told served told ordered  Absolutely since husband didn't want any ribs begin with  over someone else sorted out  said would fix check discount some sort  waiting around 15 minutes happen nothing just left  leaving noticed some people garnish whatever plates  didn't any that  Neither did guy sitting behind me      Chicken dry    Ribs dry    salty someone bag salt served protein it  Gravy potatoes tasted came fast food joint  <EOR> I'm always excited try new place way favorite chai located right next door decided try NCC  1 4 rib leg thigh combo which comes side drink  sides exciting part experience but due dieting couldn't try ones really wanted Mac cheese mashed gravy  etc decided cole slaw  very dry bland  Tasted no salt any seasoning matter barely any mayo vinegar couldn't tell style was  chicken just ok nothing run back for  ribs best part visit  decent amount meat packed flavor  put cup BBQ sauce side dipping but them dry  back give them another try other location open longer  <EOR> Saw owner opening walmart chocolate chip cookies then repackaging them cookies yuck!
