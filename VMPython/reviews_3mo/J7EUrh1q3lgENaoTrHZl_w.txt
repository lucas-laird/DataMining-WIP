Given experience I'd rather across way View fan favorite burger fries one  Also burger jumps $13 50 lunch $15 during dinner presumably same thing  Comparing two menus appears several other items similar jump well  Plenty restaurants throughout city just fan  Regardless which price you're going better cheaper burger options very close Fleming's View Honey Salt  sure opinion debated ass kissers hype mongers town but  they're good days  <EOR> Great overall dining experience all three visits  server very knowledgable attentive  Beer selection awesome!! Grilled cheese pork belly bites butterscotch pudding must orders!! Can't wait  back again again! <EOR> My biggest problem place feel most restaurants suffer from   High prices average below average food   Hops Harvest Tivoli Village probably high rent therefore feel justified charging more everything $14 bottle beer because cool name but still tastes average beer  no problem paying more food drinks but should earn higher price quality taste       I ordered grilled chicken sandwich date ordered BLT   also mac cheese appetizer which basically your average mac cheese but cheddar cheese worth $12   dinners good but nothing special   probably won't back because same quality half price somewhere Jason's Deli   just expect something more kinds places   tout themselves some kind revolution dining even though expecting continually fail miserably   Skip place unless enjoy paying more mediocre food  <EOR> Seems okay  can't imagine being anything besides happy hour 3 6 daily   The food good grilled cheese bites polenta bites mini burgers but beer overpriced unless its half off happy hour  Pork belly bites pretty good  I'd come back due proximity other awesome places around tivioli  <EOR> Terribly mediocre  Ordered grilled pork belly I love pork belly most undercooked  Burger pretty good but chef inspired all just plain old cheeseburger   Subbed artichoke fries again undercooked couldn't even eat it   learned grill broken guy cooking grill broken  Also wine list meh and couldn't buy wine glass bottle   <EOR> Excellent spot   Many beers tap food good   We skirt steak salad bacon chicken sandwich  Both excellent    The steak cooked medium rare just ordered sandwich came very good french fries    Sampled several beers happy let taste before buy  <EOR> We lucky enough come day when Bradley Ogden restaurant   He came table played daughter!

However bibb lettuce salad bland short rib nachos bad idea well   nachos supposed horseradish them but couldn't taste it   Bland bland bland   polenta bites ok   Kind earthy   used green goddess dressing came polenta bites spice bibb lettuce salad   The desserts die though   butterscotch pudding strawberry shortcake both divine!    The beer selection little lacking especially place hops name   But serve each beer appropriate glass give them props that   I only made previous restaurant space Bottles Burgers once   But don't remember space being awkward   entryway no shades blazing hot summer   large round room tables unclear whether accidentally came back door until hostess approached as she tried stay direct sunlight   Also women's bathroom small diaper changing table location blocked doors stalls   Very embarrassing when trying change daughter   Finally play chicken people coming into valet breakneck speed even there     I hope redesign restaurant   staff nice friendly efficient service   definitely concept chef   Just stick items he specialized namesake restaurant now closed burger souffle butterscotch pudding you'll pleased  <EOR> Solid place but long last always empty Tivoli Village? First all chef Bradley Ogden know you're getting spruced fresh American food quality ingredients hat tastes good  only sampled appetizers happy hour menu mac cheese grilled artichoke chicken sliders grilled cheese fried polenta bites  grilled cheese good grilled cheese served creamy tomato dipping sauce also loved macaroni  artichoke sliders solid but outstanding wasn't fan polenta  well prepared just didn't really taste cinnamon or something there   The really good thing restaurant beer list  15 selections tap nary bud light found! Choices included Full Sail MOA Lips Faith some other keepers  didn't even look bottle selections which sure also excellent   The drawback Ogden's celebrity status everything little overpriced   EXCEPT during awesome happy hour! Half off draft beer wine selection apps $3 5 everyday 3 6 aaaand enjoy happy hour anywhere restaurant! Even your kids!
