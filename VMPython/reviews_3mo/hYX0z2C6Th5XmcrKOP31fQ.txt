American Fries Sliders course Vodka Cran! <EOR> I've both Palazzo Townsquare location say both them equally   interior decoration location very dark but light chill   set made mood music quite interesting if come good day   Sometimes would indie other times would house  Regardless did wish music little lower should don't think we're night club guys     Well onto other important factors people bar nice   Sometimes might even intriguing conversations them   I'd add happy hour but only selected items varies certain days   food number attention grabber far tried almost everything menu say quite impressed bar  well known wine   those complain prices drinks they're selling cheap stuff  can't glass merlot expect $2 00 you're paying glass full crap   excuse language but isn't your typical bar where just order cocktails shots   serve wine expensive stuff glass hence name WINE WHISKEY  The food's served tapas somewhat Firefly experience   did try the Aracini delicious oozing hot fresh when first bit into it   taste truffle oil dominant loved it  BBQ Pork sliders love taste coleslaw any burger happy incorporated  Quesidilla MMmmmMM well incorporated dish  Everything just oozed together merely impressed  addition guacamole just made day  Heriloom Burrata all know prosciutto cheese basil leaf anything always good  Chipotle Slider Guacamole any slider bacon book worth trying  French Fries Ahh crispiness fries two sauces side   love fries never wrong that       Aside food hope continue improve kinks well because food amazingly delicious  glass Moscato good  Tipsy even  ^_^ <EOR> I feel review may little unfair because didn't actually order anything when there   but can   The staff wine bar   asking experienced Somms but know inexperienced when see one   wouldn't suggest die hard wine lovers come place   I think more relaxed sipper   hostess sommelier waitress eye candy girl very nice   think rule though don't pour your own wine but guys really left no choice   She didn't come back while   wasn't busy night   maybe she could tell bored    The goods water fantastic!  Seriously  all ordered   friends seemed enjoy bottle Riesling ordered shame didn't share them Riesling favorite sip some Desert Blood thing   bad   The atmosphere really confused   expected modern almost futuristic design but seemed cross between hookah lounge complete Indian lanterns pub squishy leather loveseats included   I definitely want give another shot maybe pull everything experience   But until then afraid all got  <EOR> We popped Girls' Night Friday night because heard $5 00 wine tasting various food specials  Yay! new place new tastes deals boot  wrong?  Let's start part shall we?  The service mediocre first  being bit generous  15 minutes before HH tasting specials start place busy any stretch  Three four servers two bartenders seems plenty staff party started some recommendations indivualized attention service   Um    *flags someone down gets acknowledged waits bit longer*  Let's try again  wave flag air horn*  Hmmm    Oh! Hi didn't see making eye contact few times   *sigh*  Once began ordering wasn't bad  still cumulative experience however tad slow throughout night   The other WTF moment came when specials explained  Two specific dishes only house wine offered specials  server even admitted tasting almost always house wine  tasting but special house wine  it   We ordered couple glasses wine taste something new and help decide bottle then ordered bottle collective favorite  wine selection isn't bad  found some new things consider some solid restaurant favorites  Still place part wine bar seen better lists lesser places  Just thought    We also decided food ordered steak one specials charcuterie plate   *This* where all picks up  steak generously portioned tapas appetizer selection fantastic flavor perfectly tender  charcuterie plate fantastic  wish more quantity each versus quantity choice lots different flavors already represented cheese copious amounts meat  only hangup however everything paired creatively small additions gelees fruits nuts etc  unquestionably complementary    seasonal boot always plus!  We also shared death chocolate sampler aside being diabetic coma beautiful plate done well  Various takes sweetness richness textures made all work together offered something every type sweet tooth   Service improved bit said night on    but still little inattentive including forgotten water twice    Parts evening 4 4 5 stars some 2  Overall solid 3 star maybe even 3 5 A OK kind place even if just charcuterie most likely worth return visit  <EOR>
