My manager hooked coworkers before grand opening play date  Basically servers staff train    Since training limited menu served  But free food   ! table share appetizer each entree then dessert share   First off restaurant looked great  bar area very big seems stocked everything! didn't sit bar since party 8  staff very friendly  good drink specials  beers  appetizer loaded fries  loaded    nothing special  Didn't care it  entree seafood medley served pasta  loved it! seafood well cooked flavorful pasta al dente  came garlic bread which also yummy  Decent portion though believe smaller usual size   seafood included lots shrimps some clams crab scallops  Yummy   For dessert brownie sundae  Brownie sweet  Ice cream was   well   just ice cream  Nothing special  Overall average place  But good hang since lots seating nice bar pool tables too  separate smaller bar  staff nice  <EOR> Great restaurant mostly booths you're crammed against anyone  Super friendly bar staff slow when Saturday afternoon but entire bar team made sure said hi introduced themselves learned names kind attention that'll regular    The food good  high end bar food but done well tasty  fish tacos very good blackened asked them omit cheese no problem   couple substitutions asked veggies lieu rice no problem    This place off good start  Compared indifferent service Cadillac Ranch odd service patterns Yard House where bartenders rotate positions every half hour some reason felt neighborhood bar staff friendly locals  If attitude holds true next few months become regular watering hole   The patio offers only real seating large groups since room mainly laid built in booths  Something aware of  Also zillion large screen LARGE TVs showing sports should hot spot during major seasons events Superbowl  <EOR> Anyone rates place less 5 starts should post!!   This place best places Vegas  Located just off Las Vegas Blvd south Fry's Electronics    Food awesome same food Yard House Chili's but think more reasonable  appetizers enough feed 2 4 people nothing over $16 95 Steak Lobster mention drink prices some best town   bar area dinning area smoke free! also bar attached people want smoke Yes two bar areas   also open till 2 3am depending day week   Don't let other 3 star review scare off basing off quality food drinks service prices but rather experance  Just because some younger people work doesn't warrant 3 stars service awsome always checking making sure getting drinks filled making sure good food!  I found new place Vegas! <EOR> Just today lunch before movie   say service nice   seated right when walked in   decor seafood house Pacific Northwest   Wood planks used very liberally   TONS TVs joint   heard change channel TV any game want   OK now food review   ordered shrimp dishes   ordered 35 Shrimp Scampi Pasta partner ordered 35 Shrimp Plate   tell if seafood fresh   ones fresh   garlic bread came pasta cold also seemed frozen kind cooked all way through    also think Chef lacks some taste buds because both dishes lacking seasoning department   server said desserts great   Since time before movie ordered Captain Jack's Buried Treasure ice cream cake doused fudge    good admit but lackluster lunch can't redeem itself rating am giving today   say prices lowest Town Square but pay for   All all just mediocre best   would pay more better food   Hope review helps someone  <EOR> I cannot bring myself love place really wanted to   brand new great menu but lacks awesome flavor category   try real hard but felt if something missing all dishes   We came right when opened wasn't crowded which nice   server nice guy very quiet enthusiastic host but he checked made sure drinks   decided try appetizer never heard before cup soup 2 different entrees   Here's breakdown experience When intially ordering gave server 1 appetizer 2 entrees he immediately left table without finishing order   wanted 2 mushroom soups but assume he thought ordered enough food large people    opinion situation   Usually when server leaves without waiting say  assume personally feel enough order  Crab mozzarella deep fried balls mozzarella crab jalapeno it   Pretty good serve sauce sweet creamy   bit watery but still tasted nice  Mushroom morel soup bad   tasted Cheesecake factory's soup which assume use same company order food  Miller's steak sandwich big chunky sloppy   flavors typical steak sandwich mushrooms onions   liked it   fries typical restaurant fries  Baked seafood combo stuffed shrimp piece mahi clams scallops   husband ate but tried mahi crab stuffed shrimp   First use imitation crab stuffing shrimp so so   Secondly mahi lacked proper seasoning   Salt pepper long way despite using paprika sprinkling need use basics too   The Nutty Brother Dessert   ice cream cake slice two layers vanilla nutter butter cookie base chocolate peanut butter sauce   quite yummy   Overall service average food   would back eat crab mozzarella appetizer but agree others worth long drive for   wouldn't crave place over over again  Still okay hope gets better  <EOR> Gave place  two chances both didn't turn well   jalapeno poppers all going them   Continuously mistakes simple entrees such salad!  Fish fish tacos freezer burn      Maybe appetizers beer  but wouldn't trust them meal  <EOR> Cutting them lot slack being new business being new Las Vegas   friendly considerate staff gone way accommodating group friends   Good food reasonably priced beer continue come back patronize them  <EOR> Nice casual place Town Square decent bar food very reasonable prices  would probably put more drinks appetizer category personally because food wasn't spectacular but exactly would expect sports bar restaurant type place  ice cream cake desserts pretty damn yummy though plus overpriced lot other Town Square options   and lots great drink specials  Next time bf wants watch fight game definitely suggest place  Kinda reminds bit Shucks    <EOR> Stopped lunch started off crab mozzarella appetizer mushroom morel soup   crab mozzarella pretty good mushroom morel soup also very good   soup reminded Cheesecake Factory mushroom soup but still prefer Cheesecake Factory   No reviews beer now but if ever back off meds sure give go   The baked seafood combo consisted couple clams mahimahi fillet scallops stuffed shrimp   excited gooey imitation crab stuffing shrimp both mahimahi fillet scallops lacked seasoning   clams OK   For dessert nutter butter ice cream cake which good   Nothing exiting food here  <EOR> This 3rd Ale House reviewed  love place everywhere go  grew hanging friends Ale House restaurants Orlando again Miami now visiting some cop buddies Vegas check brand new one  Chicken Nachos Captain Jack's Buried Treasure   yes please!   I did slight fool myself ordering Yuengling  quickly remembered west where sadly guys yet great Yuengling Lager  Hopefully experience soon  <EOR> We decided try Alehouse some friends new time give chance  somewhat brief wait since 7 PM expected anyplace Town Square sat down first drinks  side group beers which priced little high opinion but typical any Vegas restaurant  husband other couple double vodka tonic which wished ordered since only $5 decent price    After started ordering food which all decided split would all able try some different thing  started off Calamari appetizer which fairly typical but splashed fairly lively sweet chili sauce actually pretty good  pass around main courses ordered Mini Burgers Fish Chips full rack Baby Back Ribs  burgers cooked little bit long really nothing memorable them all  Fish Chips crisp all way much fishy taste them indicating perhaps sitting around long  little odd since place hasn't open long enough anything really sitting around long  pretty horrible end couldn't possible recommend them  Ribs made far rib per person before all concurred just horrible sent them back  Ribs them self obviously all same completely dependent sauce rub bring them life  stretcher being covered sheet  sauce odd taste couldn't even identify would think sense taste    Obviously manager came over sent ribs back fairly quickly offered free dessert taking them off bill  decided Brownie Sundae which opinion good but wife liked she far better judge am fan brownie sundaes  would gone another direction but women usually want    I realize place some standalone single owned restaurant but rather location chain thing can't expect change menu  Knowing chain bugs should worked menu now things should little better were    I can't say all negative things place though  manager very quickly responsive dislike ribs rather making sit bit wondering status was  cannot fault staff all since restaurant part larger machine just going through motions doing jobs  lot TVs distract yourself some sport hope don't notice food tastes    The restaurant winds being end many chain restaurants  No soul no meaning  couldn't even figure theme supposed be  saw someone say place better Yardhouse but must written someone doesn't beer  Alehouse 15 beers tap which slightly different Yardhouse  Plus food Yardhouse seems much better eaten there    My final recommendation if you're going eat Miller's Alehouse somewhere else  probably work more your favor  Let place patronized people just going drink don't care they're eating  <EOR> Have once large group friends  love atmospehere  music obscenely loud Yard House actually conversation your friends service awsome  really great waiter very accomodating  beers cheap which always huge plus  didnt eat but friend some french fry chicken finger mountain thing looked amazing  certainly back going back place  <EOR> Let start off saying beautiful restaurant pub great ambiance  really wanted it  food well word bleck!!

 72 TV's throughout place no matter where sit catch the game    AND! if isn't good enough review then this  There 23 beers tap   even if food service only 1 star choice beers worth visit   But food good service great price great too   here's deal   Just freakin' check place out   mean c'mon worst case scenario spend $25 food beer  <EOR> Probably more 3 5 stars   friend Thursday night grab drink catch up   split combo appetizer which fried crab mozzarella fried mozzarella fried conch fritters noticing theme? spinach artichoke dip   Everything pretty standard nothing very exciting exception crab mozzarella   thought really good     We some really strong Vodka sodas which server kindly persuaded doubles better deal   service really good whole place just nice vibe   nice change Blue Martini which where normally end up   Blue Martini having some sort private party whomever hosting party not anyone worked BM don't think incredibly rude!

Yes probably happy hour lunch  <EOR> This great place come few beers watch some games   There's tons TV's tons seating ton's beers tap   We ordered stuffed jalapeno's appetizer  When bit into hot cream cheese spewed burned lip  Those things dangerous! Tasty though      The entree food fell flat  summer salad drenched dressing  friends shrimp scampi super bland BF's salad looked wilted just good   Come beer sports food   Props having Oregon's dead guy ale tap  <EOR> Oh Oh my   the prices really bad all  would say great place hang friends grab few drinks watch football games considering fact there's lots TVs    Food great service excellent! ordered seafood medley $13 99 word describe pasta DELICIOUS  bf ordered seafood platter sorry don't know actual name but came crab 2 corns potatoes shrimp clams mussels lobster clam chowder soup $16 99  Doesn't just your mouth water just thinking it? starters ordered crab mozzarella yummy  best last dessert    Captain Jack's total must try! <EOR> im little sad server's name escapes but he made whole experience worth reviewing! gonna find receipt update it    anyway first time sat near pool tables  no greeted awhile but someone finally came asked if greeted he ended keeping table   he explained all specials started drinks us  ordered food everything came fairly timely manner  although did wait pitcher ok because eating didnt want fill beer anyway    overall great experience  if dont mind domestic beer i personally only drink domestic beer if im playing drinking game but hey! $7 pitcher isnt bad all! its definitely deal  $7 pitchers every night well other drink specials   to top off boyfriend left sunglasses table  pair oakey's he's years! end going back look them sure enough server gave them manager hold until come back  normally people dont that! ive worked restaurant industry 7 years people arent always 100% honest lost items  but thankfully there  think overall made even better experience   that ossobuco dish definitely meant two  leftovers work next day ]  the weird thing served crackers oysters  ive never seen anyone serve crackers them  O_o  definitely back! <EOR>
