C'est si bon! <EOR> I popped La Belle Terre The Beautiful Land en francais but knew that no expectations other wanted some bread  Wow big thought parked car checked phone noted Yelp check in deal cast dour look across parking lot certain popular bakery hadn't impressed past  Good omen bad omen? wondered   The interior LBT just gorgeous  display case runs almost length store surrounded gleaming wood everywhere open kitchen behind all where watch baked goods being prepared  Ooo   I immediately dismayed see dark chocolate bread walnut but missing popular items always risk comes visiting bakery afternoon  Foolish me!  I settled regular baguette loaf garlic sundried tomato two tarts lemon chocolate raspberry mousse oh mini quiche ratatouille  Do know difficult find vegetarian quiche isn't cheese 'n broccoli ? One men working offered heat quiche but alas wasn't staying  spoke both guys awhile really impressed passion products  Everything certainly looked good portions generous   At home later two tarts didn't last long  Light flavourful both them  quiche standby couple days but still very nice trip microwave  A little soggy but sure fault waiting  eggy heavy overladen vegetables cheese didn't noticed   Both loaves bread into fridge right away wrapped  next morning reached baguette shocked find long rock instead  Grumbling put back didn't touch again until next day when sprinkled little water put microwave  resuscitated for small amounts eaten bit quickly could tell would've quite delicious if I'd same day   The garlic sundried tomato loaf six dollar mishap though  took fridge few hours coming home pulled off little piece taste it  Jeez  dense! garlic tomato certainly smelled nice but really didn't care bread itself seemed tasteless  might just prejudice against bread tight crumb soft crust but tasted black hole slice Wonder Bread baby then sprayed garlic perfume    But again judging everything else clear La Belle Terre knows doing don't let thumbs down moment scare away  such spacious lovely interior airy sweets staff genuinely excited they're doing overall give LBT very solid thumbs up  <EOR> Peet's coffee love!

Save quiche back soon! <EOR> Pros food alright  Cons Poor customer service slow ran soup du jour pesto sauce 1pm   My story My first time Le Belle Terre decided some baked goods soup du jour quiche eat there  When turn order picked baked goods order meal when man walked started talking directly cashier taking order  man told cashier he'd order soup du jour  cashier diverted attention man excuse like took man's order charged man  When cashier reverted attention back without even acknowledging just happened said would order soup  He said he sorry but last soup just ordered  asked if ordered man rudely interrupted order he answered guess    Appalled decided rustic sandwich no quiche  awaited order same cashier approached said all pesto sauce came rustic sandwich  sauces available substitute mayo dijon  Seeing dislike both took offer substitute sauce spinach  order served sans spinach    Small gripes They serve water dainty little plastic cups which fine but no place self serve water  no wait service potential busyness prospect more water becomes more problem anything   Lastly entrance set double doors  left door locked yet no mention anywhere  Please use other door would better serve customers trying enter  <EOR> The Skinny solid French pastries breads 4 Service counter service nothing special but plug bar your electronic devices N A value French pastries breads neighborhood? Score! earth truly beautiful! 4    The very first time came check La Belle Terre opening  They'd barely pulled pastries buns oven eager satisfy carbaholic cravings    We ordered small sugared brioche almond galette pain au chocolat quiche  soon those items hand dug right while pastries slightly warm oh delish!  The pain au chocolat nicely flaky chocolate slightly molten inside  Just way should be  If notice pics there's no sagging middle pastry because even layering butter pastry dough   almond galette tons almond filling inside which major plus love almond filling  Again puff pastry held despite filling inside  blueberry strudel really good overly sweet  small sugared brioche amazing lovely eggy buttery goodness fresh oven really wonderful   The only thing wasn't par quiche lorraine  Although flavors okay crust didn't hold moist filling soggy  would recommend getting quiche here   Round two tried Napoleon loaf fig walnut bread    The fig walnut bread okay but felt texture little dense could use little more figs walnuts   The Napoleon pretty good nice pastry cream layers flaky pastry but sweet although feel previous pastries we'd tried first time came better   Added things try soups sandwiches here   In addition serving some pretty good pastries also serve Peet's Coffee Teas which major plus  also free WiFi nice long power bar plug your electronic devices while surf sip nibble your morning afternoon away  neighborhood gem!
