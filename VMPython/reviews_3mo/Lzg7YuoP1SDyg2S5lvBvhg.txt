This time wanted try soondoobu soup  remember previous restaurant really crappy last visit there  Hopefully would changed new owners   The banchan came first way tasted things going look great  only side dish thought remotely interesting radish kimchi  nice crunch sauce well prepared wasn't bitter all  other side dishes pretty forgettable  waitress kind enough refill side dishes frequently   The soondoobu soup came out  First think should must hotter temperature wise  barely bubbling  When cracked egg lot albumen did cook all way  flavor  gotta say improved over last visit when Mashisoyo  broth better but didn't really blow over anything   Everything alright but don't know if would come back soondoobu  I'd come back try some other entrées cause that  Oh think Ace Base should reunion tour  End  <EOR> Finally delicious Korean food near neighborhood   Food excellent owner very friendly  place used called Mashisoyo  I stopped going because food terrible   But now under new ownership new name   I recommend everyone  Thank Good Fella!

The old owners always remembered definitely miss that  But also miss food well  <EOR> Service decent food mediocre pricing expensive food portions quality loud K Pop music television limited seating there's treble away bathroom  nutshell going back better food price you'll pay if cheaper  decision eat regrettable  <EOR> We come twice lunch both times enjoy two little outdoor patios  Inside isnt quite nice but if snag outdoor table perfect   The woman owns manages kitchen always made feel home even remembered when came second time!
