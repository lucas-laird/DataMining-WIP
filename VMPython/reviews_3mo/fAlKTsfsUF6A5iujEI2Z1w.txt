I imagine eat again when visiting linq!  **Get Rolled New York appetizer!! <EOR> close Linq?busy street  recently opened?pricing high but taste ?salmon little hard pasta salty?we three ordered much no reminder?80bucks tip worse buffet <EOR> Horrible service! waited 10 min being seated before anyone even greeted us  Then when asked hostess if order drinks two servers argued another table   just take order already lady! Anyway didnt any better  rarely yelp except if experience GREAT TERRIBLE  Don't come its SUCKS! <EOR> We checked cool bistro last night  Veronica took very good care us  enjoyed salmon carpaccio opener fabulous! food delicious  Mahi tasty black beans quinoa  Great wine selection also  Highly recommend! <EOR> First off first review starts off single star rating    good sign what's come   We decided upon OTSB realizing would long wait Brooklyn Bowl   seated fairly quickly hostess very pleasant she just only positive visit  We then waited 20 minutes before anyone even GREETED let alone took drink order   Two waitresses argued over whether table finally drink food orders taken same time since 20 minutes review menu     We then waited another 25 minutes before even drink orders   Meanwhile see Executive Chef managers talking non chalantely no sense urgency anything    It another 10 minutes food   group seven brought two dishes   another 10 15 before remaining dishes     We spoke manager made complaints known credit he apologized comped some items   But damage already done all completely dissatisfied    You would think restaurant would treat larger group patrons more priority seeing possibly larger purchasing outcome   case   disorganized timing EVERYTHING suffered greatly   unfortunate experiences mask other possibly great attributes restaurant   seemed cool place grab bite eat drink honest don't even remember food because horrible lack service  Notice said lack service   didn't want take away server because she wasn't horrible   She just wasn't there    only attribute management lack ability manage situation more promptly    Sorry but locals returning establishment  <EOR> We came left high roller  bacon wrapped prawns wife turkey club  Both excellent service great  Def back  <EOR> Cool place grab drink people watch if lucky enough grab seat outside   drinks really affordable LV prices like $6 7 well drink    also thought chicken noodle soup super delicious filled yummy fresh veggies which kind surprising basically eating bar  service excellent very attentive   If walking through new LINQ area suggest stopping by  <EOR> Das OTSB haben wir der relativ neuen LINQ Promenade gefunden die Straße vermittelt ein wenig Fußgängerzonen Atmosphäre  Eine sehr willkommene Abwechslung im Autofahrer Paradies Las Vegas  Das Restaurant Bistro selbst bietet ein Auswahl kleiner Gerichte von Nudeln über Burger zum Steak  Die Portionen sind für Verhältnisse überschaubar für meinen Geschmack aber absolut ausreichend! Es gilt auch hier manchmal ist weniger einfach doch mehr  Es gibt sowohl Sitzplätze draußen als auch drin der Platz der Bar steht natürlich auch noch zur Verfügung  Das Personal war aufmerksam und wir mussten nicht sehr lange warten jedoch gebe ich zu dass ein Mittwoch Abend nicht unbedingt zu den übervollen Tagen LV gehört  Die Hauptattraktion dieser Promenade ist das Riesenrad Highroller und auch hier empfehle ich den Mittwoch nach Sonnenuntergang wir hatten eine Gondel mit nur 4 Personen und konnten wir ausgiebig alle Aussichten genießen  Highroller und OTSB sind eine gelungene Kombination! <EOR> Great atmosphere excellent bear prices  Every hour happy hour snd Veronica awesome! <EOR> Had breakfast morning  Took 40+ minutes lukewarm scrambled eggs come place busy enough warrant type service  Asked refill coffee waitress didn't come back almost 15 mins  <EOR> Good food great service 3 1 2 stars food 5 star service  better restaurant choices near Brooklyn Bowl <EOR> Keep walking   Pros Quality ingredients nice atmosphere Cons Poor service blah food WAY overpriced $5 iced tea $15 turkey sandwich w fries The cons because server didn't checkup throughout meal   Consequently wasn't able order iced tea $5 until nearly finished meal didn't receive until clearing plates   He failed inform any specials   didn't see them until leaving   Also when BF ordered sandwiches server asked if would chips fries   each responded fries  Guess what?  $2 upcharge each meal    problem IF wanted fries but really wasn't mood would happily done without them   Being fellow server seen tricks padding bill   Shame you!  far food turkey sandwich roasted veggie sandwich good but nothing all special   hoping some sort unique sauce bread something but nope   feel more accurate rating would 1 half stars      I'm still willing try original Off Strip location Southern Highlands but I'd skip LINQ location anything other drink bar  <EOR> The food absolutely delicious  bad services terrible  Alexis Llyon name waitress way give bad service terrible attitude  would give food 5 stars bad staff lacks restaurant etiquette  hope owners read better front staff  don't need free mimosa just courteous put food timely manner  no reason why food should brought 2 other people party done eating  party 7 food before seated least 20 minutes party 3  <EOR> I can't say enough positive things Linq location Off Strip   David waiter he spectacular  He knowledgeable menu offered great food drink selections  burger special date lobster ravioli   Overall great experience would definitely recommend it!! <EOR> Had great breakfast over President's weekend  Saturday morning bit busy but seated right away  Nice vibe decor really enjoyed large glass doors allowed see into kitchen   The menu something everyone healthier options appreciated I e  Chicken sausage whole wheat tortilla etc The 1 negative waiting very long time coffee   our server delightful but able beverages table keep them filled  weren't miffed luckily other employees picked slack which should happen   I breakfast wrap sans potatoes very good  All things want burrito eggs beans avocado salsa   My partner steel oats   huge portion! loved flavor  tasted though steep cinnamon allspice clove oats  very nice unique touch   We enjoyed experience would definitely come back breakfast next trip  <EOR> Poor service understatement! Overpriced food   sure good reviews employees themselves  even ordered hot chocolate cold iced tea! <EOR> Coming good idea  place strip thought would give try Service slow   Food Truffles Macaroni good    Beef Stroganoff    better frozen section market   Rib Eye steak little thin side  Chicken strips average  The BIG POINT     There's lot random food big beautiful new culinary kitchen customer see center piece restaurant  leave wondering where wonderful food is  <EOR> Dined over Valentine's Day weekend breakfast  Service great  Food excellent  ordered tequila sunrise okay  just tequila orange juice grenadine missing  missed taste color glass  friends ordered Bloody Mary's  am Bloody Mary person but pretty delicious  However restaurant meatballs put top Bloody Mary's sure good those are  dined outside which wonderful  Inside seemed bit dark  would definitely return when back Vegas   Only note even though Linq restaurant still new take your Total Rewards card swipe  waiter said hadn't set yet  could take your receipt Total Rewards desk receive your points but wanted pay some already couldn't time but no big deal  <EOR> I arrived Vegas uncle treacherous drive San Diego checking Flamingo checked Yelp see if could find some dinner   happy learn new restaurant called Off Strip reasonably priced strip gave shot   First plus Opentable made reservation walk over   Unnecessary but useful Opentable gives points   bet didn't know huh?  also $20 Opentable dining certificate said points needed use would cheap meal   We both mood burger burger special substituted fries salad   burgers arrived long interesting fashion  Instead bun more hamburger sandwich but pretty good   Tasty meat toppings came side could customize wanted  salad really stood really nicely made salad rather just some lettuce dressing   Really impressive all $12 each   Joseph server he really attentive helpful   manager also stopped introduce himself see if needed anything   Very very good service combined decent prices?  There's no way last right?  working hard remember spot next time strip need meal! <EOR> I don't normally take time yelp unless feel though someone really exceptional if bad enough situation  case evening wasn't going very smoothly having long commute Vegas then some issues hotel  unwind Jasmine really way offer dad exceptional customer service  felt though all problems point weren't issue because she sweet personable trying evening better any way she could  enough could even say show gratitude great customer service  Thanks jasmine definitely back eat again only cause you!! Hope managers see understand lucky such genuine employee team recognize all hard work smile  <EOR> This place absolutely awesome  Service top notch bloody mary best ever had  also impressed chicken waffles less hummas trio platter   <EOR> I going Southern Highlands years  Linq tonight didn't even know restaurant here  ate dinner vibe music great  Food good usual service very good  Two things didn't but aren't deal breakers just thought I'd mention because both bothered bit  hostess said restaurant wasn't same owner SH but server said was  Also bathroom no soap when told them put post sink saying soap  restaurant should always soap if run borrow some next door send someone some  think  big no no especially because eating something required hands! <EOR> The service good  But unfortunately just overpriced food masses  $70 3 glasses mediocre wine 2 shrimp some chocolate ice cream  much better even strip  <EOR> Stayed LINQ favorite restaurant area   great wine list which paired lots yummy appetizers hummus veggies fried calamari burgers   Overall service good food good offered great take out menu which took advantage well  <EOR> Had such fun time here! two bartenders cant remember names but Sunday afternoon made experience much better  watching comedy show whole time   There lot bars Linq but when returning certainly return particular spot  only few munchies but really want come back try few items suggested us  truffle french fries freaking amazing   Drinks rather inexpensive well paid $30 2 rounds  shabby strip location  really bar placement well  sits upstairs restaurant no noisy kids We back! <EOR> For second location Off Strip decided open   on strip  Located in on Linq Promenade Off Strip accessed through casino outside promenade walk  If you're looking seated meal you'll probably want your way over entrance closer promenade side  hostess table setup looks use casino side more exit  Inside restaurant much smaller expected really dark but seems enough seating throughout accommodate steady traffic    We ended coming wife's birthday having never other location wasn't super familiar offered but them bookmarked some time looked menu before  But when arrived given menu completely different then I'd seen online other side being old menu crossed out  birthday she wanted steak none found  asking server he said specials available menu 3 which steak dinners other pork chop dinner  All special menu items priced $39 99 served side   For appetizer started off some Marinated Olives Three Wise Hummus tray  3 types hummus alongside vegetables feta cheese pita bread  3 enjoyed roasted garlic kalamata olive hummus best  Both smooth creamy added different flavor favorite snacks  But whole tray overall pretty small ask more pita making apps $15 price tag feel bit heavy  olives priced much better just $8 but only thing seemed marinated vinegar salt  just couple olives eating them just finish bowl since no else table liked them    My dinner choice Grilled Mahi Filet priced $24  served over bed red quinoa beans drizzled balsamic dressing  most part dish okay until half way through fish  realized hadn't fully deboned fish stabbed cheek  When find things food usually stop eating but realize fish easy miss bones  But picking through other half 6+ bones still there  can't say ever found bones mahi mahi any other restaurant but if know fish big long bones  finding many done pretty surprised kitchen could overlook something that    The service decent mostly attentive but ask refills simple things few different times  when informed them bones fish no bothered even offer apology     Luckily wife much better luck steak enjoyed meal  But even them being strip can't see prices being worth quality food  Being other location gotten such great reviews quite while might check but staying away Linq location  <EOR> Came midnight snack    Gyro homemade chips ahhhh mazing Turkey Chili also quite good  waiter Leo fantastic! Ask him!! way everything needed wanted  drink Orchard refreshingly delicious too  Definitely gonna Come back! <EOR> New place pristine  would recommend Beef Stroganoff  Joey bar best  <EOR>
