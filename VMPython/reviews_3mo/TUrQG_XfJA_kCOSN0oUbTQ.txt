Yay happy! Smashburger some pretty high quality burgers far fast casual restaurants go  excited finally over try place    First off space way small Smashburger  don't know why thought could cram into teeny tiny space  would avoid coming during popular meal times because would nowhere sit  severely lacking seating space tables  Another problem huge windows mean more half seating made unusable when sun hitting them just right  blinded roasting solar rays  pull down shades but poor job blocking sun  layout place funky well fountain drink machine located weird corner causing big bottlenecks when customers trying fill drinks  Bonus points having Coke Zero though     The girl taking orders very slow confused but guessing just because place recently opened  always back few weeks see if they've ironed some kinks  kitchen FAST much faster any other Smashburger ever to  sort worried expected burger taste crappy order incorrect  but wasn't!  My burger exactly ordered good! didn't look tasty but tasted great  very happy  Most know low carb eater love when place doesn't blink twice when ask no bread bun  Sometimes difficult people understand burger comes bun anyway  SUPER EASY  fact kitchen even served burger two slices lettuce could them into bun if wished see photo   LOVED THIS! EARNED EXTRA STAR JUST THIS!  Premium add ons bacon avocado cost $1 each  totally bummed removed chili menu  loved adding chili burger  Now kind boring without it  <EOR> This first time eating Smash Burger   regular cheeseburger rosemary garlic fries  All ingredients very fresh burger good although little greasy side me  fries very thin but tasted good  bad smell sewer something kept smelling off on I think when people opening door  Kind spoiled appetite  <EOR> Not good W  Lake Mead location which frequent quite often  The restaurant itself small  Service little slow staff friendly  menu different non strip Smashburger's which disappointing  burger Smash fries good  Fries really oily but still crisp tasty  Even though don't want probably back just because convenience home  <EOR> I way back home Los Angeles  wanted something different other then your normal burger joints then came across smash burger name alone sounds great walk a c great compared weather side Automatically grab menu then walk counter three different fries also different sauces choose place clean almost new music new age service great hope LA Definitely would again won't disappointed     <EOR> Two Words = Fresh Quality   One freshest high quality burgers ever tasted   1 star = Great menu  menu variety options  thought would simple menu but fact more options your average fast food burger joint  even 2 kinds potatoes fries! Sweet! bacon cheeseburger avocado  Yum!  2 stars = Freshness  really taste difference meat good!  3 stars = bring food you  kind service Fast Food joints!  Lacks 4th star because SmashFries super greasy! Sweet potato ones greasy really filling!  Lacks 5th star location because smells really crappy outside sewer smell comes restaurant ruins your whole dining experience  Yuck! <EOR>
