I've eaten many buffet Las Vegas but necessarily lot higher end buffets such Bellagio's   Mostly due high cost eating when would rather spend money single entree regular restaurant   Last night pleasure attending pre opening Aria all meals casino play comp'd   choice cafe buffet   Since huge line cafe chose head upstairs see offered   The buffet very attractive physically different levels seating area move through room   serving area surrounds room starting salad seafood moving through typical yet sophisticated buffet faire   ends dessert area which less substantial many buffets but did some good treats   The food ranges crab legs shrimp veal bollanaise at least particular night hummus asian noodles   Again much same stuff found Palms buffet Wynn's   Compared Wynn's buffet Aria does compare choice dinner selection desserts   food high quality Aria but worth $30 taxes cost dinner here   Perhaps grand opening selections change   some issues people lining seafood when may realize don't wait move around rest room bottleneck almost ends having people lining near entryway   I would probably come again only if meal comp'd   If guest Aria would good choice buffet nothing else within walking distance casino perhaps Bellagio but never eaten would any better but maybe walk build appetite any food resolve  <EOR> Was told buffet suppose rival wynn bellagio high hopes going in  gourmet dinner night which $38 99 friend decided back downstairs gamble little come right before did lunch dinner swap lunch=19 99    Upon entering see seafood selection giddy  loooked Amazing oysters raw clams HUGE shrimp wynn doesn't even serve shrimp lunch anymore crablegs etc   Walked around saw prime rib Leg lamb all tht good stuff  figured heck just normal lunch should wait till change gourmet dinner  3 45 4 30 made huge mistake selfish guess   only plate seafood thinking time done everything woul swapped  while waited realized everyhing only looks nice looks decieving  oysters clams unfresh very unpleasant seafood taste sashimi sliced paper thin unlike bellagio generous portions   Things started downhill there  slice prime rib wth! took away replaced 2 turkeys leg lamb gone replaced skirt steak  Reallly really overcooked tough skirt steak  even though he said he giving more rare piece    walked around buffet see else changed normal lunch gourmet dinner suprised see everything pretty much stayed same  néed stop rant now still Aria but figured should yelping duties warn others overyhyped overpriced buffet  mean $19 99 isn't bad but don't spend almost $40 dinner  you're pretty much getting same food would gotten MGM double price if want buffet  Wynn Bellagio  yourself pretty decent dinner nice restaurant elsewhere  <EOR> Just back Vegas which stayed last night Aria thought would hit breakfast buffet thinking would par Belligo Wynn  Boy wrong  OK know only second day operation but screw bacon eggs? wife shown table immediately food  food area quite long but great selection  Usually walk look food figure few things look best fit them onto plate but struggle find enough things appealing enough eat  eggs benedict looked very weird eggs freakishly white  Hard find just regular breakfast fare  two omelet stations many people waiting each know buffet bad when people opt 'ol standby omelet line behind Mr  Picky special egg white only omelet veeeery light Cheddar cheese also behind some punk kid eating off plate line  Idiot  chef manning station seemed overwhelmed special order moved on  huge slice ham not bad some Chinese egg concoction slice pizza later back eat  Started eating no server yet  Half way through still no server  Finally when almost done server asked if wanted anything drink  barely chocked orange juice   Finally when second last bite drink came all six ounces it  asked two more   For 15 bucks should much better  gotten just good breakfast Terribles half price  Also since place should elite found totally tacky each foods instead having nice plaque food written sneeze windows grease pencil  Totally lame  sure if would back eat even if comped  Perhaps lunch dinners better  <EOR> I've eaten lot buffets Las Vegas   best   crowded when there   food freshly made tasted great   service impeccable   reiterate best part buffet freshness great selection variety food     You your selection seafood fresh tossed salad just way want crab legs oysters prime rib turkey cooked food asian station soups incredible dessert bar   wanted back again before left Las Vegas but didn't find time  <EOR> We excited dine buffet Aria thinking woulod par Mirage Bellagio   The only  par price selection good    the food good    Looks life half section same price  <EOR> Went other day lunch co worker  lot space devoted food but seems half taken cooking stations where nobody cooking anything  salad station where someone tosses your salad station where someone pours some Miso soup  Seems waste space  Overall lot variety each area only 3 4 dishes pick from  best part buffet king crab legs jumbo shrimp desert area  worth price  <EOR> You would expect newest mega resort $30 for dinner would truly something  disappointment!!! food sub par variety limited  best thing menu crap legs sushi saying much  also beef section prime rib beef fajitas Indian section pizza section Chinese food section  use word section very lightly because sections maybe 3 4 different items tops  But taste quality crap! sushi rubbery and tuna black something never seen   4 other people everybody felt just ripped off  Even generally stuff myself buffet proper value but wasn't interested    It might worth mentioning people squirts later night but may hard pin restaurant  But image provides right one   I would recommend going buffet M resort  better quality more items few bucks cheaper   Overall AVOID place roach stand Mexico City!!  Food Quality Taste = 1 Stars Portion Size Given Price = Buffet Price = 1 Stars Service = N A Experience Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 4 Stars <EOR> The Buffet Aria par other high end buffets Las Vegas strip   showed 3 30PM day opened purpose able sample lunch dinner dishes   cost $21 99 per person included usual drink offerings soda iced and or hot tea coffee juices   The first action station see skimpy made to order salad bar where any three+ servers place small variety incredients into mixing bowl add dressing place plate bowl   neat idea salad action station but falls short   really need portion romaine shredded carrots? asked myself   Moving along line begin see real food including 3 carving stations turkey leg lamb prime rib  all acceptable quality well seasoned   BEWARE SUSHI sushi terrible!  essentially same caliber would low end local supermarket way heavy rice fish barely visible dull dry instead shinny moist    Skip sushi!  BEWARE ASIAN DISHES also half dozen Asian dishes laid including Chinese brocolli beef hoisin sauce orange chicken noodles veggies egg rolls etc   First hoisin sauce which might well called hoisin salt buffet becuase way salty well stirred   would avoid unless your soy sauce shot glass   eggrolls way much dough enough veggies under cooked   noodles overcooked flavor uneven bite next   They did some interesting Indian dishes which well seasoned could even detect several layers flavor which does take some skill pull off even Indian cuisine   also fresh baked garlic nam bread brushed butter highly recommend   The dessert station average included usual tiny cakes cheesecake cookies but chocolate dipped strawberries tasted wax etc    So sum if find yourself buffet skip all but carving stations Indian food dessert bar   Perhaps they're process learning mistakes but point could take 10 minute walk just any direction 4 5 star buffet experience another hotel   highly recommend buffets Bellagio Planet Hollywood Mirage over Aria competitively priced   fact even if cleaned act Asian foods right Aria's buffet cafeteria line set ill equiped effectively compete competition nearby   its best could potentially become 3 star buffet opinion  <EOR> For another city restaurant might higher rating but compared other buffets Las Vegas Buffet Aria doesn't match up  Especially compared Bellagio next door same price lunch dinner Bellagio wins without doubt   The main reason oysters half shell but beware oysters unfresh dessicated such strong fishy taste unable swallow them  Also looked if no touched them ice which made them more unfresh  sushi palatable though suspect Aria does hire real sashimi chef sashimi being unevenly cut    The prime rib flank steak good although seasoned particularly well meet standard already set Bellagio  newcomer block Aria does case itself Bellagio does better job much more selection same cost  Aria buffet resembles cafeteria interior somewhat claustrophobic   The saving grace buffet beautiful presentation its desserts could worth if dessert fan although selection definitely less varied Bellagio    All all Aria digestible apart oysters but cannot compete competitive buffet scene Las Vegas  <EOR> Something $30 dinner per person   Depending time around 6 gets really busy otherwise there's room hardly wait line  The staff very friendly but when gets busy ignore bit   Unlike previous review said start off king crab legs shrimp now I day before crab shrimp end     shrimp expect paying $30 crab just alright   Ask them steam crab!!! Important! tastes much better + butter   There's sushi    avoid nigiri or rice + very little sashimi    fish isnt really expected   Some sushi alright   really liked spider rolls   There carvery station turkey flank steak prime rib depending hour day mix up   Indian section goat curry hummus etc   Then Asian section where won ton noodles upon request not bad but could near house 5 bucks    good asian carvery One night good peking duck next day cantonese BBQ Pork      There isnt really much fruit selection   Then there's dessert section   best part honestly   TRY CARROT CAKE! pretty good sweet well presented   Gelato Macaroons pretty good too!

However impressed buffet compared other buffets   I came Dec  26th Lunch $30 per person    Buffet second floor   quiet difficult find    only because wasn't aware second floor     The line Buffet long however luckily family 17 VIP access buffet   seated 17 individuals appeared very difficult especially hostess   even told them splitting group would fine us   The Food good   especially loved burrito!   variety especially Chinese food Meat!   Shrimp Shu Mai FRESH! really liked food but lacked Pasta did large selection sushi   However dessert selection amazing!! large selection pastries ice cream cakes!  Coconut Ice cream MUST eat!  The service good except hostess really rude  1 star her   While getting seated placed group side   Throughout whole time she complaining all other hostess right front saying suppose  should never group 17  doing    etc  she rolled eyes us   many tables honestly could understand problem was   However member group talk which she instantly started treat well   High corporate power hotel instantly change person's service      Overall food good   but new hotel    expected better  <EOR> Originally group stopped buffet breakfast New Years Eve shocked $30 price tag holiday brunch   decided come back dinner $39 95 suggestion manager said since holiday dinner would options expensive fish lamb other delicacies  group expecting dinner par Bellagio least Planet Hollywood Mirage  returned later night only lied left disappointed    The only high end item other crab legs raw oysters which smelled terrible  would chanced eating them if payed me  buffet no variety  price inflated holiday dinner instead giving more food options seems may taken roughly half away  much space used filled  maybe two types sushi rolls two three Italian dishes which noodles red sauce which probably can  10 options sauce Indian section however no real dishes which would needed them    Highlights king crab legs decent overcooked lobster bisque decent flavor overcooked prime rib tender  pork fried rice labeled which actually shrimp fried rice actually pretty good  Creme brulee great some other desserts bad  gelato good however ended options vanilla chocolate mango lemon  Nice boring flavors encourage pay $5 downstairs something interesting    Failures sushi inedible  sushi rice used fully cooked  curry tri tip texture leather  Worst miso soup ever had  tasted similar way gym socks smell seemed inconvenienced guy serve he glared making work  asian station general terrible  Some dessert combination very strange which saying lot because love good gourmet flavor combination interesting parings  chocolate covered strawberries tiny no flavor chocolate texture wax    In addition all food failures actual buffet area reminded cross between junior high hospital cafeteria  Incorrect labels written black marker above dishes only way tell where certain types food located walk around unimpressive buffet area    Then poor planning actual buffet's location  group seated booth near buffet line ended mild case motion sickness  noticed ground chairs shaking constantly  table next took iphone used ap which measures earthquakes  shaking enough register phone  turns constantly running tram Aria Monte Carlo Bellagio causing shaking according server did stop entire meal  ate less normal due motion sickness    Maybe addition hiking price holiday dinner removing majority food items telling guests all non existent gourmet food items Aria's plan back money spent building hotel? knows    Save your money check  Spice Market Planet Hollywood Cravings Mirage  Both far superior same price  going back Buffet Aria  <EOR> So far Aria latest five star hotel Las Vegas  However buffet didn't taste five star  expected proven wrong Christmas Holiday dinner $39 99+Tax    Its buffet 2nd floor which hard find there's no restroom near buffet  need walk Viva Elvis theater which hard find   line long but since 25th ready wait   We came large group 12 understand may hard find table 12 busy time decided split group into 2 six people groups hope would easier  hostess took first six people group then gave four people seat! WTH?! When asked she insisted she just asked four people come while actually asked six claimed no other seat available time while clearly see some other tables two four available combining them making six  She even insisted two should back front cashier start all over again  frustrating staying line 2 hrs cannot seated in? immediately asked speaking manager  He responsed very quick politely provided resolutions trying resolve seating problem  ended getting another two seat table separated table four  Although best solution think could accept partly because manager's attitude nice but mainly because hungry exhausted standing line  Let food rather seating crap   Originally assume Holiday dinner should lots selections however Aria let down because only few selection Chinese Italian Indian  served crab lag shrimp cocktail which good because paid more $40 bucks expect see those  served lamb which great because every buffet served it  But mint bit odd  would hope jelly green looking sauce  Chinese dish looks all you can eat Samwoo place sells roast ducks BBQ porks shumais etc  much less choices  very impressed   Their dessert looks gorgeous partly because glass plate use  Yule log great while another weird dessert tiny oreo top tastes weird combination chocolate syrup Robitussin  gelato but am big fan  much fruit choose    Overall buffet overpriced especially its dinner  many food choices here  If come large group prepared because hostesses don't seem know handle large group seatings  If choose stay Aria wanna buffet yourself favor walking Bellagio  <EOR> Very disappointing! stayed Aria opening night received dining credit    since walking buffet few minutes before switched dinner prices made quick decision eat here   Big mistake!   The buffet stations more plates bread actual food items choose from!  looks upscale high school cafeteria!  taking plate walking end other back still didn't anything plate!  finally decided try mashed potatoes turkey since nothing else looked great   thought maybe overlap lunch dinner decided wait extra hour before leaving see if put anything else out!  only thing changed chicken curry shrimp curry! Bottom line    wouldn't back  Even free dining credit wasn't worth it!  Note Most uploaded pictures desserts    probably because only part buffet actually put effort into variety presentation  <EOR> Came Vegas last week decided try buffet since new Aria hotel  $29 95 brunch buffet!? Given Holiday buffet don't think worth price all  special holiday prices? Perhaps king crab legs oyster bar but those didn't even taste fresh    I've few bones pick buffet 1  wasn't impressed selection food had  2  Items weren't filled when empty counters weren't wiped down   3  Instead placards indicate dish used sharpie write glass    For hotel think buffet could lived it  Aria structurally beautiful love its layout eco friendly but buffet simply sucks  <EOR> The only things worth eating were Jumbo shrimp bomb ass cocktail sauce Alaskan king crab legs Dessert  Everything else extremely salty   Holiday brunch $30 99 $35 99 champagne    Unless comp probably won't coming again  <EOR> Lots seafood! Jumbo shrimp Alaskan king crab legs sushi oysters smoked salmon all which tasted fresh great me  Saturday morning brunch $30  Beautiful contemporary decor  My friend enjoyed breakfast burrito  great variety lots choices  dessert selection amazing tasted great presented beautifully  large selection pastries gelato cakes  Everything tasted great sad wasn't able finish foods plates they gave generous slice tender prime rib   The staff courteous came check frequently keeping juice coffee cups filled  <EOR> Well since new ready try it   Bad idea! $68 two people brunch would least expect some good eating  place all your basic buffet food king crab legs fishy couldnt even eat it  <EOR> The Buffet Aria little closet bathroom became afterthought remodeling your house    I spent good chunk time exploring City Center last week hoped cap off amazing personal tour enjoying buffet going set bar contend Wynn buffet   Aria hotel casino whole much beauty attention detail floor ceiling left captivated wide eyed    kinda watching Avatar 3D first time    And then came buffet    ugh   booooooooring   wall finishes tacky dizzy nauseous    good meal   layout confusing shrimp located all way across dining area crab?  does sense?  Trying control crowds fact walkway little space???  I haven't even gotten food yet   Came between brunch dinner save $   food subpar place advertises   Prime rib quality long new batch anorexic king crab legs pretty plump shrimp   breakfast items include variety sausages which weren't tasty   Sushi Salmon Nigiri Chilean Sea Bass aka ugly Patagonian Tootfish came dinner   only thing really stands fresh naan curry food area    something sounds rip off buffet however   Here's hoping buffet actually secretly still under construction other parts City Center      ahem nudge AHEM! <EOR> It seems lot people unimpressed buffet came little expectations but came away pleasantly surprised  During trip vegas buffets M Aria Planet Hollywood surprisingly favorite  While isn't perfect long selective eat believe pleasant dining experience  came lunch while $20 isn't cheap easily money's worth stuffing myself crab legs jumbo shrimp raw shellfish  prime rib best among 3 buffets although wasn't saying much none good prime rib even average sit down restaurant   Pizza which most buffets doesn't even look food actually looked edible though didn't try it  asian food entirely forgettable but again don't buffets eat those kinds things They also excellent selection desserts which nicely presented  Most desserts good but avoid fruity sauce thats side cakes because they're way sweet   Perhaps thing stood most place service  very thirsty day downing coke every 5 10 mintues but never more couple minutes without drink before waiter came refilled drinks  He also cleared plates great efficiency every time more food dirty plates all gone time back  also loved no wait well  Some people would interpret mean buffet no good but cmon any buffet really worth standing hour line for?   Probably weakest aspect buffet would design decor place  buffet bit small side occasionally difficult navigate past people different stations  custom salad station where your salad order put seafood section front which caused unnecessary bottleneck  overall design buffet fairly plain well although some window seats   I understand why people came dinner would underwhelmed assuming food mostly same  probably would hesitant come dinner but lunch place worth it  <EOR> TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! THERE   dinner birthday Dec 2009 thinking new Vegas buffet would want come strong compete Bellagio Wynn Buffets   sorely disappointed   mean come on! Vegas!  Buffets things completes Vegas experience!  All food dry if they've sitting under heat lamp all day   Furthermore selection terrible   never back    We also talked manager politely gave opinion food   asked if he's tried other buffets such Wynn Bellagio which he replied actually never tried any those buffets  very surprised manager buffet going sizing competition even just seeing Vegas buffet like    After disappointing buffet took tram Bellagio next day eat buffet all well again  <EOR> Just missed line Wynn Buffet night before Aria check new casino  time lunch found buffet thought would fulfill hunger  Unfortunately selection food Aria Buffet very limited  $30 per person lunch worth it  prime rib king crab legs turkey asian entrees cereal Mexican entrees dessert bar etc  think really enjoyed only two types dim sum asian stir fry vegetables over rice  Which brings while eating away boyfriend saw chef mix batch eggs maybe scrambled eggs? he turned sink mixed quite good amount tap water into mixture just plain eggs  serious??? if don't want watered down eggs don't try it  probably ate $10 worth food there  Also another note  asked Peach bellini waitress no idea was  She come back two times ask it  finally came food  <EOR> Nah   Its orite   nothing bragg here      My first time eating chinese food vegas buffet   tells much food available choose   hahaa    Cost 30 per person    new hotel   worth it! FIND ANOTHER place  <EOR> Talk foreshadowing anytime see short empty buffet line Las Vegas should beware  buffet Aria average  unimpressive thought would buffet equal other 5 star hotels Bellagio Wynn    In terms variety felt aria buffet tried accomplish offering number different international cuisines such indian chinese japanese etc  However still felt WITHIN each cuisine just wasn't much  example sure japanese food but specifically only 3 types rolls some nigiri  No other types sashimi no unique rolls no tempura etc etc   In terms seafood usual king crab legs shrimp scampi oysters but wasn't any different would find any other decent buffet   In terms serve food little strange food smallerl serving plates  While may give impression dishes more fresh replenished more frequently also causes inconvenience customer when dishes constantly running staff members refill it  means customers waste more time waiting food eating it   On more positive note service excellent  strange just because no really notices service remembers waiter buffet but mine good certainly did remember  She always refilling drinks asking if needed anything never late clearing used plates    Overall if choice buffets Las Vegas would still opt Bellagio Wynn  price Aria similar other upscale hotel buffets 40 dinner simply doesnt satisfy terms variety taste  <EOR> Convient those staying Aria but really worth come anywhere else just eat    Breakfast passable $14 99 person  particular thought interesting 6 different types sausages veal bacon breakfast   Moreover seating very spacious like parking spots hotel   However everything else pretty normal your standard breakfast fare  Services good place extremely clean feel it  <EOR> After reading some other reviews almost didn't buffet which would mistake   Some points mentioned other reviewers while true don't equate 1 2 star rating   Yes shrimp located long way crab legs Asian items buffet greatest etc   buth place serves quality food   I found atmosphere dependent where sitting   middle area most pleasant dimmed lighting   Sitting some edges may place seem more cafeteria like   The Food ate weeked gourmet buffet which costs bit more    rack lamb leg lamb sucking pig many more great tasting  rare items   Even taste quality none entree items rice potatoes etc  high   deserts exceptional   exquisitely prepared small desert trays   tried 5 6 different items all excellent   also some gelato although selection great Rio seafood buffet     I'm only giving four stars because tried  Bellagio   I'd say overall quality value taste  bit higher Mandalay Bay buffet which also very good    I returned weekend dinner buffet January 2011   prices seem bit higher but now give half lobster $5 extra whole lobster house wines your dinner   various entrees side dishes great garlic naan still excellent service   desert selections large when first opened  <EOR> If staying hotel City Center then maybe   lunch  shrimp cocktail king crab legs alright  oysters fresh  salads pretty good  some fresh melons but fresh fruits hiding all way around corner desserts  All meats over cooked  duck extra salty  desserts probably best  No need special trip  <EOR> So disappointing  space feels cafeteria food underwhelming  food looks good but best quality  Very good service however sure hope everyone's sake employed place reworked  <EOR> Diner beware  impressive hotel structure outside looks ran money prime priced buffet $36 dinner both decor cuisine   would think same price Bellagio's buffet would expect some competition   should've known something wasn't right when Saturday night weekend CES 8pm only 30 35 people waiting   Food mediocre maybe step two above Main Street Station's buffet   1st slice prime rib excellent second visit medium well dry middle slice   Desserts unimaginable flavorless chocolate dipped strawberries waxy textured non chocolate tasting dip unlike Wynn's Bellagio's    only thing better buffet versus Rio Wynn Bellagio sushi rice very good buffet   My advice skip until re vamp entire buffet chefs person charge tagging food description glass above dish black dry erase marker   Tacky  <EOR> I really liked buffet such wide variety  think factor great Wynn buffet Bellagio buffet food 'top line ' Meaning    crab legs smaller but tastier opinion omelettes made kind hastily      BUT  much stuff    eggs benedict eggs florentine crispy duck oysters wonton soup shu mai sushi pineapples watermelon fried rice prime rib lamb chorizo burritos waffles french toast    nothing felt missing   However desperately need train waiters waitresses    waiting forever drinks brought different drinks she placed them different table realized ordered it     really really horrible    I think place worth if don't want wait hours line if want shell little less cash  people want thick crab legs  <EOR> Came around 2 ish afternoon still lot people eating here  But no line   Service attentive waitresses  Food lot breakfast type foods your own omelette 6 types sausages eggs waffles toasts benedicts etc   There beef cheese tortillas pretty good long crab legs yummy too  sushi roll actually pretty good but sashimi didn't look fresh  also Asian food section broccoli cauliflower mix stir fried assorted veggies kung pow beef  really liked pizza section especially  cheese pizza pepperoni pizza veggie pizza  didn't ham because dry  lot nice looking desserts but only raspberry cheesecake stood out  gelatos kind watered down   Bill $51 per person no champagne  The whole restaurant rumbling thought earthquake but just train links hotels together  wouldn't mind eating again  <EOR> Cashiers hostess friendly   know feeling hate working sort thing   However server super nice lady    When walk feesl Cold   Entire hotel food court uses Energy efficient lighting looks florescent lights which bring cold feeling  majority flooring tile stone finish   Super modernized but think am used warmth carpeted flooring    Generally food Super salty   Prime rib Salty Oyster fresh over all food quality somewhat equal Hometown Buffet quality   think should charge around $15 it     think Mirage buffet down street  5 times better price similar Aria Buffet    Would again    Humm probably food  <EOR> I'm fan buffets general   just can't eat money's worth    found buffet pretty good value money spend   Seems strategy focus quality large selections plus     spent time eating crab legs oysters shrimp ie  expensive stuff    Some friends meat they said prime rib salty but other meats good tried cake desserts thought horrible     All all $40 range dinner think top 3  <EOR> Please Tell ready  serve full buffet yet ! Awesome architecture  People expect more prime rib turkey roast     Please take walk over Wynn use $34 00 buy buffet several entrees hundred more combinations    Desert menu OK but doesn't stale tomatoes salads pickled taste !  Complained personnel didn't even care    If ready should opened January  <EOR> Vegas used place good buffet really cheap   it's hard find those places now   decided check Buffet Aria   mister's iPhone run juice didn't know rating place getting   so tried without bias   serving brunch price wasn't bad $23 but add $5 bottomless champagne mimosa   of course added bubbly   place spacious well lit since huge windows views pool area   lot food choices but always judge buffet based seafood selection   Here's breakdown GOOD touch screen menus front cool factor king crab legs which request them steam them you   a must! oysters shrimps cocktail style chinese style fried skin on lamb chops gelato macarons strawberries sweet just freshly picked Oxnard farm OKAY prime rib decent nothing die for champagne ok didn't really pair well OJ maybe OJ wasn't freshly squeezed  crepes eggs benedict omelette station  UGLY Although waitress nice she slow come around drink order check us  Sauces located wierd spots gravy next asian food  limited sushi selection  Overall buffet wasn't bad price but better  <EOR> Vegas Bay beeee!    Buffets Smoke filled casinos newest Aria   course least try right?    $19 99 lunch  Ok new bright all pretty looking but 1pm place only 1 2 filled  Strange newest buffet strip     Onto food  Salty  Bland  Salty  Bland  Salty  couldn't even finish piece prime rib cause way salty   plus whole thing cooked looked medium well time cut piece off little bit pink disappeared nice well done  blah   laugh chinese bbq pork   they carver cutting little pieces people  Really?   The only thing enjoyed hot sour soup  Cause flavor wasn't salty   Saving grace bad buffets usually dessert  here  Again  No flavor anything  Oh most desserts served pretty plates really bulky carry maybe three them most if stack them right  buffet crying loud want able load plate 20 desserts sample o Ok maybe being harsh  mean did stay until 5 30am drinking maybe taste buds dead something   group 7 three thought food good  But eating things chow mein pizza chicken     The only thing enjoyed place music playing  What's love eating bad food while headbanging Lady GaGa Beyonce  <EOR> Don't trust review because buzz off bottomless bubbly   JK  Went group 6 NYE bit wait no biggie  Also price $36 NYE champagne def steep side    darn holiday pricing Crab legs awesome because cut half didn't pry legs open meat The prime rib way salty weird   would normally back another round but tasted odd Belgian waffles made LOVE Belgian waffles Dessert amazing mango panna cotta carrot cake strawberry short cake gelato stand!!  Overall pretty good but sure would come back buffet <EOR> I ate breakfast dinner huge dissappointment compared buffets Wynne Mirage which used numerous times  Food quality good but selection very meager boring  Salad bar only tub lettuce other choices very boring cheapo corn salad carrot salad other filler types  Only 1 pasta penne generic red sauce  standard crab legs skinny lower grade Wynn's  place totally synch opulent spare no expense state art design throughout Aria  <EOR> This place deserves 3 star its dessert alone  But can't ignore rest buffet menu  wider range selections such those mentioned other reviews here  However suppose  happens when cheaper price tag focuses many items  <EOR> My husband did Aria buffet breakfast  cost $14 99 per person  cheaper breakfast buffets but think money's worth    The ham moist tender bacon crisp  loved smoked fish section   three different kinds addition anchovies  Delicious!   There 5 different flavors cream cheese  Many buffets just serve those little prepackaged Philly cream cheese containers  cream cheese chives bagel smoked salmon capers  Wonderful    They section pizza   even breakfast pizza breakfast sausage egg  didn't eat pizza but looked popular option many guests    There omelet station good selection fruit  orange juice did taste fresh squeezed but coffee tasty    We also enjoyed selection coffee cakes muffins  Good stuff    We'll definitely back  <EOR> Came NYE lunch buffet  holiday pricing meal bottomless champagne $36  complaining because Vegas NYE afterall  However food didn't impress all much  king crab legs favorite  Very meaty cut all fork meat dip butter! Breakfast food dessert good too  But other foods lacked bit  Asian section pretty weak  Just typical fried rice noodles some kung pao chicken  Standard pizza  Prime rib very salty way well done  understand Aria still new but don't think made very good impression friends I  would only come back if around $20 which doubt  <EOR> A large group brunch sunday afternoon   price $23 wasn't bad hotel buffet strip much cheaper option any other restaurants inside Aria   10 group didn't wait very long seat which blessing long night clubbing drinking etc    The king crab legs plentiful meaty salad bar fresh blueberries blackberries along all other veggie goodies   belgian waffles soft fluffy breakfast burrito surprisingly tasty i think chorizo egg    prime rib delicious garlic naan good too   entire side asian dishes wasn't expected brunch but lot options   only tried chinese broccoli peking duck dim sum   made mistake putting plum sauce peking duck horribly salty   duck steamed bun would okay themselves   dim sum wasn't bad   Good chicken noodle soup too      Their desserts pretty almost hard eat them   almost   strawberry shortcake delicious caramel flan   strawberry bread pudding decent when mixed bananas foster really good   remember trying 2 other types cakes display   one chocolate opera thought blueberry cheesecake instead tricked into getting lemon y cake some sort blueberry sauce! friends asked tea server brought wonderful lavender Earl Grey tea    yet when another friend group asked tea he brought herbal tea tasted bad potpourri perfume  If ask tea sure ask your options are    Overall thought buffet pretty good price  <EOR> Hanging Vegas bunch college buddies pretty much guarantees multiple buffet trips true form decided check breakfast buffet Aria before heading home    $14 99 isn't bad plus inadvertently timed started switching over lunch 20 minutes in    Good No wait although Monday Breakfast choices surprisingly good large variety sausages meats such   Bonus points having chorizo burritos  Prime rib perfectly done  Fresh crab shrimp oysters  Great tasting and rich desserts    Bad Service pretty lousy   took forever drinks coffee sodas even messed up   think waiter more hung over were    Overall pretty good buffet great deal boot   sure coming weekend dinner but would definitely stop brunch again  <EOR> So group friends  different buffets Vegas before but since first time no basis comparison mind when reading review   1 price 45$ lunch would 75$ something if half hour later would dinner before but ate both tables 2 queue horrible hour something 3 food quality acceptable few he items big lamb chef cut number pieces wanted raw cooked enough guess many others but desserts YYYAAAMMMMM  The next time Vegas try other ones probably give better view aomparison  <EOR> Really Yelpers?  Two half stars place?  think  bit harsh   Despite horrific reviews Buffet Aria group test new buffet ourselves   walked virtually little no expectations pleasantly surprised   Because lunch $18 Monday buffet crowded seated prompty   Everything spic span clean service very friendly welcoming   food choices although plentiful say buffets Wynn Bellago bad all   desserts especially appealing presentation majority also taste   Having visited various buffets Las Vegas strip really think getting lot more flak deserves   Nice atmosphere good service food reasonably priced   Solid four stars book  <EOR> The most mediocre buffet strip  Small selection poor quality  Way expensive  If CityCenter Aria suppose reinvent Las Vegas then buffet proves outlook rejuvinating town dead water    Make drive M Resort best buffet town <EOR> This buffet pretty decent     if liked food offer   much fish department which downer me     But spaghetti asparagus truffle oil pretty good     mixed corn content     cold shrimp crab legs decent usual standard all buffets      sushi other hand wasn't doing much me   Salmon Tuna Nigiri me     fish actually dried out     GOOD     Especially sushi girl     But never chance eat meat stuff     because dessert calling name       There little shot glasses curiosity going     berry cheesecake other coffee shooter     took chance coffee shooter course creme bruele     But only took spoonful coffee shooter mind set     only WORD it     AWESOME!!!  yummy just light coffee taste     delicious 2!!!  Anyway buffet just A OK      Lucky $50 dollar food beverage credit staying Aria really only cost 11 dollars buffet     Works us     Maybe give some time still new hotel hopefully they'll jazz bit     We'll just wait see    <EOR> Ouch such bad reviews here  Why????

Great selection desserts ranging fluffy pink marshmallows chocolate dipped strawberries brownie pudding key lime pie nutella tarts assorted cookies    Overall good experience! server friendly kept drinks full didn't leave piled plates table  food while excellent good felt offered pretty good variety quality    With many great restaurants Vegas hard say definitely back but against it  <EOR> Does place deserve star? Yes many levels  Let's start price  $32 dinner Monday night  OUCH! immediately look around see if decor view am paying but disappointed find neither  Keep mind price expect quality par Belagio Wynn Rio M  think money MUST food  No such luck courses typical all buffets Las Vegas but served colder under seasoned   The bottom line don't waste your money your calories here  <EOR> My family frequents buffets Las Vegas first came Aria during Christmas dinner   time would rate 2 stars because transported Mirage buffett Bellagio prices   Now coming back Presidents Day Aria buffett hitting its strides offerring unique dishes good quality   Luckily arrive 10 50am able enjoy breakfast lunch breakfast prices   Compared when Aria first opened much improved experience  <EOR> So seeing horrible reviews yelp hesitant buffet but since staying Aria just decided try out  dinner Saturday evening very pleasantly surprised!    GOOD my favs Lobster tails prime rib chocolate covered strawberries  BAD Service notice none reviews mention LOBSTER assume  new but made all worthwhile   Without I'd probably agree buffet might best bang your buck vegas  also crab legs shrimp mussels  Prime rib really good  flavored skirt steak well along several other meats pork roast beef    don't remember all Took FOREVER server take away plates   just person waiting table would take while around all tables   should just anyone passing take away dirty plates but only server it  only complaint  husband also thought lighting bright like cafeteria but didn't mind it  True don't bunch different pastas filler dishes many other buffets may but important stuff meats seafood look for   Bottom Line Worth Lobster Prime rib  <EOR> I guess 3 half stars right  enjoyed food but pricey  came Vegas starving buffet since staying Aria  Dinner Saturday night $35 per person  Ouch!  They did lobster which told isn't served most buffets since lobster 10 bucks per tail could see why people loading lobster getting 3 4 plate    For buffet decent selection meats prime rib steak roasted pig chicken etcetera  No ham   pork chops well but can't remember made    They good selection seafood pastas desserts Aria buffet seems strive quality over quantity but think most buffets similar items  items Aria slightly better but never buffets desserts creme brulee creme brulee no matter where go  desserts look pretty come own plates decent selection   The oddest thing restaurant actually shakes  all thought because all long flight starving all day  But seems sound system isn't setup right forgot install some insulation when built place  actually felt eating during mild earthquake around 3 0 Richter scale Californians     Service slow  server nice but could tell she really busy despite fact arrived really early dinner 4pm place packed  took awhile before she could back table refills clear plates  opinion need hire more servers because can't handle load moment    To summarize liked food alot but pricier most buffets could better deals elsewhere  <EOR> COST $22 lunch  GOOD desserts better Bellagio Mandalay Bay buffets   seriously! presentation flavor portions BEST!! lunch no line  service efficient friendly variety buffet menus including different ethnic dishes Indian Japanese Chinese American Italian etc  BAD watery salty crab legs  Alaskan rubbery sushi saw server putting things into mouth when he thought no looking  very gross   NEUTRAL atmosphere matches rest hotel modern hip but looks bit sterile cafeteria   Would back? yes if wanna stuff myself best desserts town  Heck $22 worth just desserts!!! <EOR> Overall rating 3 5 stars  Since Aria new staying hotel opted try its buffet   turned buffet average somewhat disappointing   Given buffet price same buffet Wynn Wynn buffet better food quality   may may return Buffet Aria next visit   Service Friendly The staff efficient friendly   no line Saturday night which surprising since new buffet good hint value buffet overprice food quality    Food Average One food items other buffets did whole lobster tail   lobster tail quite big however also quite chewy   All beef items kobe beef steak prime ribs baby back ribs all dry well done   Indian fare tandoori beef garlic naan quite good   dessert great   loved pistachio biscotti  <EOR> their strawberry shortcake really good  but everything else expect buffet  <EOR> GO BREAKFAST!!!! can't wrong $15 00 breakfast price  boyfriend ate Tuesday morning around 10 00am NO wait in  wants wait line 30 60 minutes   just meal   not me   I'm vacation want enjoy it   not spend waiting line    As matter fact four day trip NEVER saw line into buffet morning noon night! if rush could come fill your way    The breakfast really good   and all your normal breakfast goodies  only thing missing didn't any hash browns  disappointed but oh well  deserts already really good    If looking fine dining then expensive restaurants charge $150 per meal and hotel plenty those but if want average meal average price think you'll happy buffet offer  <EOR> The price WAY worth type food ate    Mind second time ate Aria experience dramatically different  first experience great would recommended Aria friends family despite lack variety  However during second visit did experience items served during first dining experience soft shelled crab although bit salty raw oysters lobster tails big ones least 4 other people heard asking Where lobsters? including myself  answer THINK served Saturday  mean WTF kind answer that  don't remember price paid but probably MOST $4 difference  paid $36 Friday   Summary all hoping lobster tails Saturday  expect disappointment any other days      <EOR> pretty reasonable price many selections lots  variety such desserts bkfst lunch dinner options any drinks u want exceot champange bloody marys which @ additional price but overall food good some saltier others but good <EOR>
