Pretty good compared other two Las Vegas  seems more locals crowded tourist    shrimp cooked perfectly find other locations tend over cook them  lay lot more then others    I impressed overall considering only opened only 2 hours!   My only complaint sauces didn't really seem same which why took star off  However star work its way back since its only first night open!! <EOR> I am excited opened location Henderson  only closer but parking much easier ones Spring Mtn    The quality food sauces still same other locations  little smaller second location but wait wasn't bad    My husband shared laugh installed two sinks outside bathrooms just hand washing don't inside bathrooms unless need to  Overall new location just good others! <EOR> There's reason why 3 Hot N Juicy locations Vegas    Hot N Juicy BETTER Boiling Crab    I impressed opening weekend  flawless dining experience tonight following reasons SHORT WAIT Don't let 10 15 hungry diners waiting area fool you   place FAST table turnover  Greeted server right away drinks came minute later  Orders taken promptly Food came quick hot C'mon seafood fried stuff   there no reason why should take long anyway Food flavorful cooked right! Convenient sinks back dirty hands  Less $20 dinner two We ordered lemon pepper shrimp medium spice level 1 lb  $12 and two side orders rice generous portions $2 each  The layout interior nicer compared other locations   Be prepared leave smelling aromas restaurant having seafood spicy taste your mouth  Also no desserts menu   The new location Eastern surrounded many places satisfy your sweet tooth pretty much gimme eating Hot N Juicy  Frozen yogurt frozen custard boba crepes waffles  name it   Can't wait hands dirty again! <EOR> I love hot n juicy  beats boiling crab Vegas   Would 5 stars because love much but few bumps today service food  wait time bit long today food  belly rumbling watching food guests came 20 minutes us    I'm fan system where person takes your order another runs food random fills your drink  server never came back felt bad asking just anyone passed lemons bill  assuming split tips because only reason left being ditched server  all polite however   Today   2lbs crawfish   Hot n juicy medium dozen sausages  would say 1 2 lb just random claws no body  Which no good since no meat  can't wait til spring when big! Otherwise fresh n tasty   1 lb shrimp hot n juicy spicy  Way mushy  Yuck  problem run into other location spring mtn  can't even peel them just mush up  actually found myself researching texture thought over cooking shrimp tough would take hard over mushy any day  reason switched crawfish but when bring new people shrimp always to  Fix please!   Plus side sauce dipping    Yum  1 lb snow crab hot n juicy spicy  Good enough  Fresh  But next time spring king crab  Chicken nugget plate kid  Cajun fries spicy though  Oops bad    Looking forward bringing sister law few weeks  <EOR> I ordered 2lbs shrimp medium extra juicy side rice  shrimp extremely over cooked point where mushy  ate less pound before told bf done  just mushy me  rice also mushy used way much water  Service alright    didn't limes salt pepper until asked it  food took while come out  prefer Chinatown location but fact location literally 2 mins away can't complain  venue nicer love open concept  also two sinks outside bathroom if just needa wash your hands!   I gave 4 stars because still very new no doubts improve! <EOR> We really excited new Hot N Juicy closer house   other 2 locations Vegas loved them   high hopes new Eastern   The décor looks fantastic basically gutted whole space very modern looking   Comfortable seating lots it   Quite upgrade previous tenant   dinner around 7 15 Tuesday 3 4 full   seated immediately server greeted within 3 minutes   drinks came very quickly   far good         After wheels kind fell off   wife ordered half pound steamed shrimp garlic butter   decided didn't want super messy fried shrimp French fries   Hot N Juicy's fried shrimp before loved didn't think going issue   Well 7 minutes wife's shrimp table   then waited            and waited   wife put position eating shrimp alone waiting until food arrived then eating cold dinner   During period while waited waitress basically ignored us   think she could tell angry was   25 minutes wife's food arrived spoke supervisor   She nice apologized short staffed   fries then came 30 minutes   shrimp didn't come until nearly 35 minutes wife's food arrived   approximately 40 45 minutes ordered   kind turned off whole meal   may opinion colored experience but also thought food wasn't good Spring Mountain locations   breading fried shrimp thicker last time it   Cajun fries good however     They handled well only charged steamed shrimp bag   supervisor server apologetic but said meal pretty much ruined   think we'll probably give location another shot but far seem having some issues  <EOR> As any new restaurant location going few kinks  If ordering fried menu prepared wait while longer your meal even if other people your party ordering boiled menu  Apparently even just opening all out run fryer  meal did arrive until well other people party  ordered shrimp which overcooked but basked most delicious sauce ever tasted  would give location few months iron kinks   am returning catfish delicious but when am under time crunch  Maybe need invest additional fryer prepare themselves more when doors open having fryers ready go  <EOR> Best service three locations   Super attentive! all orders requests correct first time  Food great always particularly good here   = <EOR> Hot N Juicy MESSY Good!
