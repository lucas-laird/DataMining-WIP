Vegas full places price give perception value  Thankfully Flavor Flav's House Flavor isn't such place  Everything's nicely priced  comparable fast food chicken places  may even lower  honestly can't remember clarity but won't feel cheated   On side note kudos Flav working kitchen sure people food quicker  Many celebrities would left few hours but he working past midnight always gracious people   To recap or people glaze though reviews best fried chicken life Boyeeeeeeeee It's mandatory say Boyeeeeeeeee   <EOR> I know know  only person giving place lower four five stars but hear first    First I'd say chicken does deserve 5 stars everyone giving definitely give try  perfect amount spices juicyness want eat more    Now reason only giving place 3 stars because service  Service most important thing when eating any restaurant   Upon arriving sign stating would open 1 pm  already 1 15 still wasn't open  management still bit rocky since first week but decided stick because amazing chicken smell would seep through every time door opened  Flav wanted serve cook chicken which thought very nice him  However did take hour half arrive  gave all books he signed them took pictures crowd which really cool    When finally ordering ordered semi hungry meal which consists 2 pieces chicken two sides drink $7 50  am big fan dark meat opted spend extra $1 50 meal just white meat  placed order wait 20 30 more minutes order arrive  took order home when bit into chicken saw all dark meat    I know just $1 50 but hoping order correctly waiting long  chicken still delicious sides mac cheese french fries good  However recommend letting place settled down couple weeks before trying out  definitely try eating again future see if add couple extra stars  <EOR> Okay feel total hypocrite writing review because fan Flava Flav music personal sense style even fried chicken    Then again middle aged white yankee woman   But   Southern Fried husband wanted try neighborhood getting car checked shop   pulled into strip mall where House Flavor located weren't any lines    good sign opinion   meant Flava wasn't house could actually just food involved any celebrity worshipping circus     I'll admit bit dubious when man unlocked door let then locked door behind us   He doorman take out chicken joint?  Just worried keeping there?   We third line ordering menu limited grand opening   small fried chicken meal 2 pieces 2 sides 1 drink hubby large meal 4 pieces 2 sides 1 drink    took while food ready when order asked if all white meat fine   wasn't but wasn't wait any longer I kept eyeing large windows locked door unease    drive quite distance home but brought food ate lukewarm lunch   Can say Wow without being hypocrite?  Nope   but saying anyway   chicken fantastic very flavorful moist greasy all   Whenever hubby hauls fried chicken eat piece at most under duress   travel back across town again   ate both pieces chicken might eaten more if there!  The sides both cole slaw mac cheese   cole slaw initially boring thought could used some vinegar   but oddly grew ate more end really liked it   mac cheese cold fridge reheating later   both sweet tea drinks because hubby loves stuff he drank both them said pretty good   take word without verifying   So grudging bit respect Flava Flav now   because chicken amazing  <EOR> Public Enemy told don't believe hype but harder think because can't fight power delicious chicken   Unfortunately don't cool story Flavor Flav everyone else didn't see kitchen during visit  Since just recently opened guess lot other people can't fight power come down house flavooooor  doorman controlling masses kind club    Club Flavor   YEAAAA BOYYYY    Menu pretty simple Semi hungry $7 99 2 pieces chicken 2 sides drink  Hungry $11 99 comes 4 pieces chicken instead 2  Sides include mac cheese fries cole slaw  all white meat another $1 50 but when gave free guess ran dark meat  other options order more sides 24 pieces chicken    The chicken verdict    its juicy succulent crispy wasn't raw  can't really ask more lol  Comparing KFC Church's Popeye's   well gonna start revolverlution ! sides could use work but aren't star anyways    Flavor Flav man    he game     chicken game is    P S  Def Jam please don't sue <EOR> The hip hop culture doesn't interest least    Mostly because ounce finesse subtlety it   Give Ray Charles Stevie Ray Vaughn Tower Power coming Southpoint May way any day   BUT   Flav's chicken joint DOES subtlety finesse   I'm referring ghetto theater surrounding place tough looking guys dressed black guarding door letting people one at a time    give break guys take out chicken shack VIP room!

Am getting Punk'd? Ashton Kutcher hiding? Think movie Friday meets Waiting   So worth hype? Nahhh boiiii  rather spend much Smith's Albertson's knowing food service better  <EOR> I hardly know where start!  disaster   when opened   a little 11 am    orders friends side orders posted website but available store   very limited side orders even any chicken wings!  heard cook back say almost waffle mix he would stretch it    when place opened!  waiting nearly 40 minutes finally food   FYI    fried chicken nothing special if want grilled chicken luck   sides all unacceptable   coleslaw watery tasteless mac cheese dry mushy tasteless potato salad definitely homemade fries soggy worst all red velvet waffles nothing more regular waffle added red food color $3 00 extra   place itself less charming big puddle water floor where patrons wait      wait wait   girl counter pleasant but only did she take orders handle money she dished food without gloves she just handled money    Did mention much more expensive other comparable places??

Fries could crisper but thick cut bold taste kinda different usual matchstick variety  Roll just dinner roll  Ok Fried Chicken won't crack top 5 but impressed crust nice size breasts offered  Personally don't mind if bit dry actually able ert whoile thing without using fork very little no grease  Easy bite tear chicken lives pomp circumstances         Oh no flavor flav loop TV many clocks would liked see  <EOR> So co worker lunch despite some bad reviews  But surprisingly pretty good  fried chicken collard greens mac n cheese roll soda $8 some change  Chicken very fresh crunchy pretty darn good! sides really good except rolls look bought grocery store would preferred some good cornbread! didnt notice soda machine! looked 2 liters soda fridge filling drink! cuz sodas flat!!
