Finally made newest and yes closest Grimaldi's location  probably frequenting location much more often near future    This first time ordering pizza carryout Grimaldi's say much better eat pizza hot fresh straight coal oven! just good always but missed right oven taste Grimaldi's has  just better way  Once pizza starts cooling down consistency isn't peak but still deslish   I deprived myself Grimaldi's quite some time say extremely happy pizza  always white ricotta sun dried tomatoes well pepperoni favorites  big fan calzones  some ferocious salads well but usually ask them lighter oil since typically heavy handed    My FAVORITE pizza town fabulous new location  Can't wrong here  <EOR> We probably frequent place once week  seriously BEST pizza Las Vegas hands down  man NY VERY picky  Something hard water pizza crust tough NY soft water? ANYWAYS he loves guess means doing something right   Service great! manager stopped few times ask everything is  menu simple always Large Sausage Mushroom  pizza sauce tangy flavorful! use fresh mozzarella instead processed  tell ingredients high quality  also tried Small House Salad totally big enough 2 people share fresh crisp exactly salad should be  Also try Antipasto plate amazing well   Can't say enough good things maybe  why weekly pizza stop <EOR> If love pizza you'll love Grimaldi's  Tried newest lcation Rainbow everything first rate  <EOR> i seen grimaldis food network when living Socal when learned locations las vegas move eager give shot   HONESTLY BEST pizza ever had   thing crust quality ingredients all difference   place hit once week only because food but service amazing   love GRIMALDIS <EOR> I seriously did know pizza could de lish!
