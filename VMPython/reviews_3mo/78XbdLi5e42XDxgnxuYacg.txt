She many disappointing experiences life  guess Ohjah converted her   Husband skeptical wasn't ready try until he read Yelp reviews yesterday evening   decided eat dinner celebrate Easter pleasantly surprised delicious everything ordered was     We around 4 PM avoid dinner crowd promptly seated many customary greetings   ordered following Shrimp tempura dinner included vegetable seafood tempura miso soup salad Miso soup Special Roll Combo  chose Volcano roll without cream cheese Philadelphia roll Blue Diamond roll California roll Edamame Green tea ice cream Vegetable fried rice Tempura ice cream  tempura banana*  Comments food 1 If looking order few Special Rolls Special Roll Combo really worth it buying 2 getting 1 free! Such great deal delicious   Nice presentation added plus   Everything fresh including raw fish   Although volcano roll notated spicy roll wasn't which happy since typically eat spicy foods  2 Miso soup didn't any but son extremely picky eater secondary Sensory Processing Disorder enjoyed it  3 Shrimp tempura delicious even extremely picky eating son ate two bites!! 4 Additional tempura included yam cuttlefish imitation crab onions   liked thick batter light didn't appear greasy   Husband said tempura sauce sweet though  typically dip tempura sauce but didn't because already really delicious  5 really expecting just scoop green tea ice cream  giddy when bowl 2 scoops 2 mounds whipped cream arrived! Before could pick spoon little 1 3 way through first scoop    6 tempura ice cream arrived shortly waiter politely commented put extra tempura banana which typically separate order   exclaimed husband just comped tempura bananas?! thrilled because good! Even MIL skeptical tempura desserts enjoyed them   guessing maybe comped because waiter asked if first time told first in laws second   Unfortunately in laws kind pick bill didn't know comped tempura banana felt embarrassed leaving bigger tip even though tipped 20%   7 vegetable fried rice nice variety vegetables i e  onions broccoli green peppers carrots    ordered picky son usually eats restaurant fried rice when cook it but he didn't even eat any because he into Miso Soup   expecting greasy Chinese restaurants but wasn't   What added great dining experience very hospitable waiter   He attentive personable checking quite often making small talk especially son which always nice since staff other restaurants wince when see toddlers coming dine     When walking manager owner asked heard Ohjah explained mentioned previously   noted certainly leaving positive review Yelp   don't typically write Yelp reviews same day unless good or bad      In laws mentioned used Denny's did terrible couldn't even decent hash browns really happy see replaced great restaurant   hoping people leave more positive reviews restaurant thrives   In laws live less 5 minutes away needless say back!
