Serendipity having appointment nearby optometrist discovering new Rice Trax location open! huge fan Rice Trax couldn't pass up   The food just good remember  ordered Mochiko Bento  Obviously comes Mochiko Chicken adds two Teriyaki Beef skewers two Chicken Katsu skewers couple Shrimp Tempura  all served bed rice some salad side  always much food enough willpower time only eat half bento   No longer tucked back obscure shopping complex new location much easier find  right DQ southwest corner Rainbow Robindale  interior bright welcoming  employees friendly   This all great news  <EOR> We extremely excited find Rice Trax finally re opening many months waiting  However when ordered favorite bentos GREATLY disappointed  Gone chicken katsu stick   gone teriyaki steak stick   gone large shrimp tempura  Rice Trax's portions SHRANK  wasn't enjoyable anymore  miss ambiance smaller restaurant  more inviting felt mom pop store  Rice Trax lost uniqueness  Rice Trax turned into every other local Hawaiian place L L Ohana Hawaiian BBQ Island Sushi  don't think we'll return any time soon  DISAPPOINTED!!! <EOR> The Mochiko chicken some best ever had  Very friendly staff  Love rice made order spot! Very easy find  Great location  Food gets quick  You'll spend $20 two people     totally worth every penny  <EOR> Food really good fresh! new location lots more space  walk without clothes smelling smoke  Friendly service well!                          Picked many meals way home work  convenient! Sorry see place going business  Very tasty food! <EOR> I disappointed Rice Trax  last week waiting finally open  fried rice way oily couldn't even eat it  beef very dry  macaroni salad very good though  ordered tempera $150 3 coin size prices carrots  absolutely horrible but wouldn't rush back  <EOR> Discovered place through friend's IG thanks Mae!   place 4 stars just ease ordering decent variety flavor portion size large very Hawaiian flavor  particularly Mochiko chicken  Fried rice seems always come sautéed some kind soy based sauce  Very Hawaiian flavor focus  Decent options fountain drinks including 4 types iced tea  All all prices hovering around $9 50 $12 filling somewhat fast option working lunch  take off stars 1 very limited seating 2 no POS system waiting line order common since WRITE DOWN all orders!   Everything btw comes styrofoam takeout container even done orders lol  Other decent place grab simple filling Hawaiian plate style lunch  <EOR> I've waiting new location open could finally try it   lazy drive Jones  LOL!  didn't really enjoy it   fried rice extremely oily rice hard undercooked   Great idea salad bar choose want fried rice but bad execution   Maybe give another try month two  <EOR> Didn't know wanted dinner came across gave chance  food delicious best easy fast foodish teriyaki place had   will def come back again! <EOR> New side town  fried rice cooked order your choice three ingredients They two main dishes cover just every meat serve including seafood  chicken catsu chicken mochokino Hawaii popcorn chicken time  Food great  Service fast  Brand new building  And back again! <EOR> HATE  Nothing   DISLIKE  Space inefficient somewhat poorly designed lots room but limited seating   Chicken katsu stick  funny friendly manager behind counter anymore   LIKE  mochiko chicken  actual chicken katsu  sin city shrimp appetizer  furikake shrimp  different sauces offered   LOVE  combo bentos boxes  fried rice bar  portion sizes  <EOR> Food really good       New building kinda no good      U pay extra everything      Miss old restaurant jones      <EOR> What yummy find!  You create your own bento choose pre made choices  opted Mochiko Bento bf chose Furikake Bento    Let start off saying oh goodness portions ridiculous! generous! No really  could share bento someone would both still super full    Anyway choose white brown fried rice  Fried rice upcharge $1 25 something  Kinda pricey know but wanted try it  ask veggies just chose peas carrots corn   tasty  best fried rice but liked it  needed more flavor though  somekindof seasoning  Maybe garlic salt? egg fried rice  another negative thing   Mochiko chicken more salty side usually mochiko more sweet side  liked chicken katsu stick  Dipped Teri sauce sweet chili aioli sauces all free btw just ask all good condiments! Teriyaki steak tender chewy  Boyfriend loved bento too  He finished all shrimp Mac salad! did even touch house salad  just wasn't fan all   All all portions definitely very generous food tasty but watch price rack if add extra things  <EOR> I definitely update if ever chance actual try place  Last time old location closed randomly during normal operating hours  Today food closed  much say except maybe never meant eat ^ ^ lol <EOR> Food good   earlier week wait 15 minutes food   Other customers over 20 minutes unorganized   tonight closed due having no food   need better management place shut down  <EOR> Ummm    great just OK    shrimp absolutely lousy    Chicken weird texture fried rice needs more veggies    hair food which never happy event but does happen  worse meals but recently    <EOR> Food great price great well but service super slow   Took almost 20 minutes pay order    Staff friendly place clean  Location really easy find great since live less few minutes away  <EOR> Trying give RiceTrax fair shot but 3 5 times new location they've run pork fried rice  Never really ran into problem old location maybe they're adjusting new location demand running out??    I won't back while probably call ask if they've run pork before do  Seems weird thing place known fried rice   I've brought friends family kinda sad its same  <EOR> Two Words = Fried Rice   1 star =  right your own way it  pick kind sauce use made order! Awesome idea but should put some recipe ideas wall something because certainly slows down service ALWAYS line here  Folks can't mind rice!  Maybe another register would work better?  2 stars = Bento Boxes come many items  mini buffet! Mochicko Chicken Furikake Shrimp sides   3 stars = Fast food Asian food gotta neighborhood  Great place quick dinner family   Lacks 4 stars because smell Simple Green whatever cleaning product use every time in  Kind ruins your appetite!  Lacks 5 stars because wait  Never problem when Jones  <EOR> I've once really liked it! ordered some shrimp pleasantly surprised generous portion  white rice seasoning sprinkled top craving return! choices rice veggies breath fresh air normal island style grills  husband maintains better place lunch dinner but beg differ! <EOR> Really wanted give place try because husband wanted weeks now  food looked good smelled good but service damn slow    The idea mixing matching really only excuse give place star besides fact 0 isn't option lol time took place order then check lunch break already over  food wasn't even ready take out    Thankfully gave full refund but there's no need take 25 minutes order    It must good if girl el pollo loco told try it  She told call ahead save myself wait  Hopefully try again few months! <EOR> I miss when place located Jones wait wasn't long     One star taken off because ridiculously long took two 3 item bento boxes ready   would 1 1 2 stars but am offered option lol   ordering finish 45 minutes   Granted busy dinner hour   just sucks when hungry waiting       I always kimChi fried rice always   new location seems fried rice sweeter   fond much sweet teriyaki ish flavor especially rice   garlic chicken bomb favorite here   Next time we'll just order before there  <EOR> Finally place open again! missed them when Jones location closed down   First say some best macaroni salad ever ever anywhere period  tastes extra delicious dash siriacha sauce  could order side finish all myself    Their kimchi fried rice favorite  new location don't list all different types rice anymore if don't see listed definitely ask anyway   All meats crispy come large portions  Perfectly cooked tender tasty    Overall great place catch quick bite 100% better average fast food  Oh but come during less busy hour because food always takes awhile you  <EOR> I've always big fan Rice Trax but almost forgot going because where previously located  excited moved block closer lot easier everyone else  loving new digs lot more near businesses Oyshi Soyo Rainbow Robindale   Vegas few decent bento places but nothing else really Rice Trax  raised prices $0 50 more remembered  bentos now $10 big portions lots taste  favorite Furikake Bento probably because came furikake shrimp pieces golden fried shrimp furikake mixture sesame seeds seaweed   also comes house salad which tastiest item teriyaki beef chicken rice delicious dipping sauce   Most recently basically today Mochiko Bento   came mochiko chicken its lot popcorn chicken but using mochiko flour kind oily gummy didn't lot  also came large pieces chicken katsu couple pieces shrimp tempura skewered teriyaki beef rice more tasty house salad  lot fried oily food but good tasting food   You also create your own 3 items 2 items bentos any items listed create your own fried rice choosing items fried rice bar   Their food look good taste good but watch wooden skewers some items don't taste well  <EOR> Wait time ok bad other reviews  2 plates waited maybe under 10 min but no else   Cost just under $20 3 2 choice  Food pretty tasty remember  Serving size also pretty good! 3 choice 3rd item spam for son gave 3 slices  slight smell restaurant wasn't appealing but subsided few minutes bathroom no soap!!! Yuck     so  why reduction 2 stars  guys gotta keep least providing soap    tsk tsk  Other good but room improvement  I'd see low carb option    like shrimp salad something  If isn't menu     <EOR> The food Ono!  Aloha style service!! We'll visiting again next run Vegas  <EOR> Not healthiest food but cares! I've living vicinity years finally butt Rice Trax  I disappointed girl waited I think she may new   no line let know first time bit overwhelmed menu  She didn't bat eye offer any advice chose build own bento Chicken Katsu on stick Shrimp Tempura Shrimp Furikake  no idea Furikake asked girl response seasoning good   very helpful verified wasn't spicy put order  noticed fact Mac salad ordered side  now know substitute place salad charge  No thanks counter girl    She never mentioned could fried rice did want any certain sauces  know next time though   Who am guessing manager very nice efficient wish she would've waited me! food quickly  liked all food  sauce gave didn't care for  portion rice huge!  Price maybe tad high but fresh greasy tasty  definitely back probably soon! <EOR> New location seems same old location terms quality food  Menu bit confusing if you're trying your own but always mochiko bento kimchee fried rice  quite easy order  <EOR> The food good but second time child line moving all   could see taking considerable time order  left   need figure way speed things up   other people kids behind also getting ancy   10 minutes person 5  6 people line just waiting place order  <EOR> Very good food!! stumbled into place when jones completely loved it! waited them open new location when did well worth wait!
