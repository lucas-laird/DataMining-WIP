I've kinda slacking reviews lately figured why kill two birds stone FTR 100th review!  This Jimmy John's location brand new located SE corner Craig Jones  If you're familiar area shopping center also Panda Express Dunkin' Donuts few other shops  JJ's far east part complex newly renovated building right now only business open building    The inside JJ's quite bit different other locations into  most other stores open kitchen area but JJ's pretty big open dining area well  When walk you'll find few booths your right hand side some community bar style seating your left  coolest things location they've also drive thru!   I've always fan JJ's sandwiches new location just good any other too  prefer thick sliced 7 grain bread over French bread super fresh  meat great flavor love use real bacon even more excited see offer sprouts location  sure but some fresh sprouts really set off sandwich  Other traditional toppings lettuce tomato cucumber all fresh tasty  only big complaint food wise only offer Dijon mustard if prefer yellow mustard you'll getting packets side   I eaten twice since opened both which pickup orders  great offer online ordering if group people want order office really nice group ordering system  first order messed sandwich forget ingredients huge deal but bit bummer  When order everything broken down printed managed mess beyond me  second order perfect though seem doing just fine having only open less then week  definitely repeat customer great location imagine they'll really well here  <EOR> First time ever going Jimmy Johns  service quick friendly  decided try veggie sub  Competitor vegggie subs usually bland  case really enjoyed prices fair  <EOR> Ate location two times row   love #4 turkey sprouts wheat bread   Love fresh seven grain bread turkey cheese   sandwiches way better Subway etc     During yesterday's Friday visit staff heard singing along music playing which nice see hear   nice see people enjoying jobs    Today ordered food through drive thru   two sandwiches ordered made incorrectly using French roll rather wheat bread   staff quick fix minor mistake    Great sandwiches nice staff  just wish location Aliante area but worth drive  <EOR> By far best JJ ever in   owners very nice crew enthusiastic   subs always great   Keep freaky fastness  <EOR> I first time yesterday Freaky Fast  couple shops town before disappointed always  <EOR> I way ALWAYS getting orders wrong restaurant want  litterally comical!!
