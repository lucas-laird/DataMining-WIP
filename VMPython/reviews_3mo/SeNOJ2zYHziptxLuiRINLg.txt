Management tells whole restaurant booked just gave your seats 4 other couples' seats party 10 WITHOUT RESERVATIONS because know large groups better clients   Really?!? WTF?!? Don't give lecture type research statistics   I drop 10X average household income Bellagio Aria every year don't walk around large groups   I feel sorry 4 other couple took whatever crap management gave them   I literally argue them table off high table w high chairs   It late dine elsewhere did end dining there   The food excellent took pics each dish but Picasso Bellagio Resort Juslian Serrano Aria Resort  mainly Italian cuisine served tapas style expect order 5 7 dishes main course per person  Enjoy wonderful food just arrive early sure room put w crap   Or arrive large group hog restaurant patio WITHOUT reservation   Chef Julian Serrano if read challenge fire manager working May 9th let someone take over fraction salary   In return ask equity establishment  assure if don't put performance matrix management bring your restaurant down   Incompetent managers taking advantage nice people = NO MORE Mr  Nice Guy!!!

Caesar salad divine cheese tray appetizer very tasty  also several pasta dishes couple meat choices desserts  All amazing    Also mention view  wall windows overlooking fountains Strip really wonderful addition experience   The service also top notch  best meal Vegas and  saying something   enjoy! <EOR> I came Lago during birthday weekend 10 other guests  Right off bat open refreshing atmosphere really experience environment wonderful socializing being happy! Lago located Bellagio sits center overlooking large pond water show outside clear view strip  Similar its Spanish sister restaurant Julian Serrano which ate night before Lago serves small plates few options larger individual portions   Wether large small group small plates really way go  only try maximum amount food but food comes all different times throughout night really facilitates social eating experience   Because pure amount food ordered try everything but ill give run down did try     Baked Ricotta balsamic rocket probably most disappointing dish night  ricotta bland tiny amount balsamic really didn't liven up  hoping would some sort burrata menu but don't    $9 Bruschetta pretty basic nothing extraordinary but solid btw come two plate but doubled which why photo 4 $7 Margherita Zucchine pizzas small individual sized pizzas come 4 slices piece  Best part crust great fluffy texture prepared well $14 $11 Insalate Sarda guess play caprese     white red green tomatoes stacked cucumbers topped again kinda bland ricotta cheese  refreshing dish nothing crazy flavor but good  $14 Gnocchi Alla Romana I'd say favorite dish night soft pillowy gnocchi topped gorgonzola creme sauce  menu little deterring because says topped blue cheese instead gorgonzola  easy tell good gnocchi bad stuff good $14 Paccheri Al Telefono essentially lasagna  sure why name telephone refrence but hey pretty darn good simple lasagna $15 Polletto half roasted chicken  bed roasted eggplant  larger plates prepared well chicken juicy flavorful $28 Costa Di Manzo braised short ribs fall apart tender great reduction sauce highly reccomend! $19 Cucumber Mist Cocktail good refreshing fruity vodka drink plus comes some fresh cucumber blueberries feel healthy $17 more dishes table much full try but overall great dining experience here  even brought birthday dessert! Service fast servers explained each dish came out   Vegas dining little iffy although Lago definitely cheap food destination I'd say well worth visit your next Vegas getaway  <EOR> I many qualms Lago   First place loud cannot speak your company   Second service pushed intense all relaxing   More importantly food just so   Small portions way small opinion   10$ three slivers lettuce joke   octopus no flavor   pasta genuinely good but again noodles sauce $15 expect little more   I hate going place mediocre food leaving $150 poorer still eat elsewhere because hungry 2 hours later    Don't waste your money  <EOR> I think heaven!  Having look taste Yelp event before its official opening eager see Lago all its every night persona   joint sure jumpin'   We first seated table near window great view but also next table full conventioneers whose decibel levels off charts   moved slightly quieter more contained room but happily still great view fountains overlooked patio which off limits due private party   Kudos phenomenal management team really took care saw would first class experience   And uphill there   server Jennifer terrific every way friendly efficient more happy offer opinions various small plates  Chatting throughout meal added homey touch experience   Likewise assistants Ali Iran Oscar Mexico City also added warmth   bonus practice Spanish Oscar rusty Italian manager felt trip   Well fueled bottle Prosecco shared   Some dishes ordered repeats because loved them last time chilled tomato soup expertly cooked white green asparagus red wine risotto every reviewer raves about delectable short ribs canneloni   But wouldn't any fun without trying some new plates   positively inhaled 7 7 seven gnocchi which hands down best ever tasted served seven lobster knuckles   knew lobsters knuckles??  rate dish 14 YUMS   Two delicious lamb chops followed new taste husband veal tonnato thinly sliced room temp veal light tuna sauce enhanced capers pignoli   dish used order years ago ahead of its time restaurant upstate New York but haven't since   loved toasted pignoli something hadn't sampled before definitely added another level it   We don't usually order dessert but knew here   could resist crisp mini cannoli ultra crisp tasty filling thinner used to   Thinner isn't negative here   won't apply Dionysian feast when scale tomorrow!  Equally irresistible even better Giandujotto hazelnut mousse atop chocolate cake round moist dense tiny scoop hazelnut ice cream top another chocolate round   So what's like?  noise   place intimate tête a tête but rather high energy fun place definite Vegas vibe   great food service   Can't wait back! <EOR> OK premise off greatest fan tapas 'little plates' because well   I'm big dude!  love big portions!  if you're gonna come Lago empty stomach sorely disappointed   Just keep mind most plates consistent 2 3 bites!  highly suggested dine family style good marker least two plates per person   Olympic eaters beware!  Yep Yelp Elite yep did come back gracious gift certificate obtained recent event held Lago   But would probably visited without comp anyway   call review biased if but going strictly off food ordered service received   Because Mother's Day weekend coincidentally also near kid's 13th birthday boy grow fast decided reservation Sunday late afternoon dinner   delight opening three any later day probably would turned away   Upon arriving Lago hostess told manager booked patio seating right front fountains Bellagio   Beautiful!  even 'Reserved' placard table fancy fancy   Great start   Our server Christina wow she super hospitable   course she probably already knew coming but watched interact surrounding tables she just friendly outgoing them she us   entire dinner she attentive very patient explaining every dish asked about   Much thanks Christina!

Even kid all food? Spoken true champ   But told give try sometimes food should taste very good but overly full   all ended liking everything!  Surprisingly ravioli ended being least favorite dish table and kid loves ravioli    tasted great but stuffing inside light     The pizzettes tasty but course wish big larger   Wifey kid liked Margherita favored speck   buffalo ricotta creamy!  Faves kid 7 7 Filettino   She loves rare beef!  funny because three share 4 oz  portion   Cutting beef into small slices just much   Luckily wifey let partake beef while she paid attention Osso Buco   star night!  unctuous tender beefy delicious!  main course but wish came bigger dish!  would gotten two orders this   polenta accompanied divine all cheese butter mixed silky smooth   Decadent   You probably surmised now finished every last bite!  much didn't any room dessert probably should saved some because Lago some pretty looking ones   Next time!  Overall wonderful experience Lago   Food excellent service excellent well   enjoyed time dining never any moment did feel rushed unattended   Yes wish many dishes more main course sized but if keep open mind good time here   did would hesitate coming again nice meal   Much thanks Julian Serrano staff giving night remember    Is Spanish?
