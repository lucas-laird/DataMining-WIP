Amazing!! only did service spot quick but she cared enough give background much time effort put into food! We during soft opening ordered Oscar 7oz beef tenderloin crab meat béarnaise choose two sides not including asparagus already added creamed spinach lobster mac   I'm going breakdown per item     tenderloin ordered cooked medium the way told chef feels best served really super! tender flavorful cooked just right  wasn't much little béarnaise paired nicely together   The creamed spinach really enjoyed  Some places really take cream another level spinach taste artificial  fresh way prefer creamed spinach executed   The asparagus also tasty    Sea salt cracked pepper olive oil  Perfect! The lobster mac      HIGHLY recommended!! There NO skimping lobster found huge chunks scattered throughout   Not only Mac really good its own but could taste lobster cooked separately flavored its own before being added  really gave dish extra pizazz necessary stand me  definitely star!

All all bad night  <EOR> I've waiting try restaurant while now really looking forward it  Called Thursday 6pm reservations told wait list add but don't take reservations? Odd but ok  immediately received text saying added  Cool stuff  arrived 5 minute wait table  restaurant great vibe nice decorations smell wood fires  Really liking place!   Soon sat realized place serious issues  sat least 10 minutes before anyone came bring water ask drinks etc  saw several servers running headless chickens  also saw think 1 perhaps 2 managers strolling around doing nothing didn't worry world    The menu great lots great choices   really wanted try several items   We ordered finally pan great bread dropped table  Waited another 5 minutes finally called someone over could silverware napkins   least something spread butter with  Things aren't looking good   Our waiter came finally took order  then sat 35 minutes before seeing again before dinners arrived  Now we're agitated doesn't matter if food great not  going hour still waiting   on Thursday!   Got dinners finished them waited another 10 minutes bussed own dishes asked check left    Won't even comment food entire experience ruined total lack service hoping mid to high end steak house  Just disappointed place really need more choices N W  but Fire Rock around long unless act together  <EOR> We 730 dinner reservations only wait 2 minutes seated  Jess waitress she great  Can't complain service but environment loud husband  Overall solid B+ <EOR> Everything experience terrible  dinner family birthday definitely worst way spend it  first waited hour seated wasn't big deal waited long other restaurants   being seated server took drink order took 20 minutes bring them us  only did take long just drinks but she only brought 2 drinks then took another 5 bring other two  she took food order didn't come check until runners brought food hour ten minutes later  only extremely long wait but others seated food long before did  server never gave silver wear ask runners some  continue disappointment food all cold  server also never told no mashed potatoes brought steak fries instead without asking side replacement  still waiting couple other items but just decided cancel them because refused wait any longer  manager came over talk offered take $50 off bill but other tables around called over he walking away complain well  Extremely disappointed everything evening both service food  Would never recommend place anyone  refuse return  <EOR> My Hubby took Birthday last night Loved it! wait table little bit long but Saturday night since only open couple months   that totally understandable  Danielle woman waited she ABSOLUTELY AMAZING  She Awesome personality very attentive making sure taken care of  food DELICIOUS steak PERFECT  Prices fairly high but totally worth it! Great atmosphere here! <EOR> So gave place few weeks open through new restaurant opening jitters  Probably shouldn't gone anniversary but thought new steakhouse could wrong  Number happy hour Sunday night 5 30 took 30 minutes seated place extremely noisy  offer good deals appetizers but appetizers tried really weren't great  tried crab cakes which half price probably weren't worth 2 bucks  came lukewarm thought someone undercooked  sauce drizzled them pretty much tasteless  wife ordered prime rib ordered Cajun ribeye  She orders side asparagus ordered side baked potato loaded  Asparagus she asked grilled instead staying probably only decent item table  Prime rib bland horseradish brought crap  ribeye if if didn't salt would no taste all  Didn't taste any Cajun seasoning all  Wait wanted but rest box dogs  sad wasted anniversary place  don't care if happy hour take care your customers tired hearing excuse   Hope helpful all you're looking good steak dinner  wish gone Bob Taylor's ranch house instead  <EOR> Went happy hour great  Arrived 4 Wed  Seated right away bar area service fast d friendly  Ordered several appetizers drinks  Food good everything happy hour prices   Nice setting atmosphere   definite back dinner  <EOR> Been FireRock 3xs now  know biggest problem? understaffed dining area bar bartenders don't communicate each other! love food but service mediocre best  manager nowhere seen  only seen once during visit  prefer eating outside but apparently can't staff that  bar packed if later bartenders busy cleaning setting next day forget customers  ready prime time? I'd say NO!! <EOR> It might just but when step into FireRock feels you're literally walking into only Shenanigans  place cookie cutter chain restaurant feeling down science  cheesy decor trying look upscale steakhouse terrible service waiters obviously don't want mediocre overpriced food you're set movie     We sat down dinner past Sunday night around 5 30  being fairly new area otherwise almost no good restaurants thought would much busier was  all said done could see why wasn't  Honestly surprising people would come more once but guess  keeps all chain restaurants alive kicking   When comes menu looks small first but whole bunch options  just really don't those options  FireRock Steakhouse supposed specialize steaks it's name yet only few cuts meats   with rest menu having everything street tacos monte cristo  Maybe concept just over head but menu literally quarter page featuring steaks  it   Because steakhouse course wanted try steak  ended deciding Cajun Spiced Ribeye which whatever reason $2 more regular ribeye  only difference supposed cajun spices which think them only means cayenne paprika then some Creole Butter   almost positive just use exact stuff sold jar name  where getting $2 charge from  might guessed now but steak nowhere near worth $26 price tag  requested medium rare overcooked  Very little marbling meat much fat flavor really thin cut  see picture virtually no juice meat plate stayed way even being cut into  Any juicy likely jarred Creole Butter anyway   What made FireRock even worse service  realize still pretty new but they've open almost 2 months now  You'd think they'd good amount kinks worked but just isn't case  waiter looked he hell every time he'd fill drink cup he'd slam cup table he taking aggression poor iced tea  I'd say thank he'd walk away without saying word  ask things more once just some bread took 10 minutes  He just didn't really seem care all   And while maybe directly fault salads took almost 30 minutes come main entrees taking just over hour  small party 6 restaurant pretty slow overall shouldn't taken nearly long  add fuel fire wife ordered filet cooked medium yet came much closer medium rare basically cold touch   As said sure FireRock going for  menu  all over place crap service mediocre overpriced food recipe disaster  good thing going them maybe 1 2 step Outback surrounded other crappy restaurants  people constantly frequent mediocre chain restaurants might welcome addition   for everyone else methinks not  Eat somewhere else enjoy your food   <EOR> My wife eat just every night  Since very close home eaten 10 12 times  Aug  31 going final time  extraordinarily slow service isn't very good   We walked last night 6 20 p m  people waiting but obvious looking around dining room seats available  hostess told wait 20 25 minutes decided wait  called table 7 08    As led table 15 tables booths open which made question why took long   When sat down waiter came over reasonably quickly  wife drink I'd walked bar but nothing  Took 15 minutes glass iced tea  long order then very long before food came out   My experience food good certainly great  particular visit wife cedar plank salmon which numerous times bacon wrapped filet  filet grilled vegetables good  solid B  wife thoroughly enjoyed salmon when past   They serve rolls meal pan but rolls cold butter wouldn't melt them    The waiter pleasant but slow didn't any major mistakes   But all all two hours paid $90 including tip meal   The long waits worth me  won't going back any time soon  recommend Montana Steakhouse which just street  cheaper service way way way better quick  food very comparable some cases better   I never say never but going give FireRock six month break allow them work kinks  <EOR> Overall good but great experience   food generally above average  ahi appetizer poor obviously frozen tough extremely salty   wife enjoyed BBQ pork nachos   NY Strip cooked perfectly mashed potatoes adequate   other entrees fine    major issue service   waitress Anjanette busting butt moving between tables but seemed bit frazzled   appears understaffed waits some items refills excessive even when dining room half empty   might want number servers   probably give place another try  <EOR> My party philly cheese steak egg rolls having read some previous reviews wasn't sure if going good  tried sause see meat tasted frooze microwaved nice flavor dipping sause great  The Ceasars salad decent    The 8oz bacon wrap filet very good  filet just hint bacon flavor which mixed well pepper  But sadly side stole show me  mac cheese amazing  real cheese  something just made mouth water  share whole table could see great was    Then icing cake favorite waitresses another place walked Danielle  She's such bright personality  am coming back sure <EOR> Yum         best new steak come while  sure try cinnamon apple whiskey cocktail  BOOM! <EOR> The happy hour great  Half price wine glass half off draft beer  But if want order food expect come wrong late must ask bread  But don't come dinner  Just happy hour  <EOR> The wait long over promised wait time  bread really good! food average  tri tips mashed potatoes  flavor plain  seemed stingy bread would more  If flavors better bread constant place would 4 5 stars  <EOR> Decided give Firerock try Friday night   Upon entering visit hostess bar packed several tables seated   few moments wait group seated near back restaurant booth   Looking around room checking decor notice lot photos artwork cows western themed pieces   FireRock definitely slight step casual dining but quite fine dining status   however private party room off left entrance seating least 20 peeps     Service started beverages some complimentary fresh baked buttery herb dinner rolls   warm very tasty start meal   Browsing menu trouble deciding because many different things salivating   seeking recommendation server decided settle Chicken Dijonnaise entree grilled asparagus white cheddar mashed potatoes  dish tasted good sounds   panko breading crisp flavorful breast large enough take home lunch portion next day   mashed potatoes seasoned well enjoyed occasional lumps creamy fluffiness  grilled asparagus perfect al dente nice side item offering    We also selected Sun Dried Tomato Basil Pasta light garlic wine sauce   liked freshness basil dish however sun dried tomatoes flavor seemed little off  Normally sweet little bits garden candy   Don't wrong dish still tasty its large slice garlic bread side   Once again another large portion take home enjoy next day     I added side salad Chicken entree which just ok   slightly underwhelmed amount toppings which diced small hard enjoy   Overall enough toppings cucumber tomato egg bacon   Even dressing little light     Service staff lightning fast  Almost uncomfortable because he would come table quickly Hi doing then phew! he gone   stop conversation just feel attended to   fine but sometimes when staff run frantically many tables understaffed    Overall experience positive   would definitely recommend Giving FireRock try   Atmosphere lively Friday night food good service expedited quickly   wanna try come Happy Hour 4 6pm where drinks apps half price  <EOR> Went last week service prompt food excellent recommend highly! <EOR> Closet place centennial hills good steak  without driving down strip sumnerlin nice restaurant    normally order premium meats because taste   good steak does require any sauce pour it   staff very attentive   recommend call ahead you'll waiting awhile entire Centennial Hills community waiting seated  <EOR> We decided try FireRock late lunch  place unbelievable  Everything menu sounded amazing thanks phenomenal waitress Angie able pick some appetizers lunch items  Philly cheesesteak egg rolls  Dipped sauce things amazing  also ordered FireRock Burger BBQ pork sandwich  burger actually ground steak BBQ pork huge chunks meat  Each item fabulous  definitely going back asking Angie  She helpful making decisions  drink glasses always topped off conversation delightful  She absolute asset restaurant  highly recommend trying place out  <EOR> I'll start off saying service good  husband ordered porterhouse steak medium rare  when came table over cooked know fact cow dead  send back  ordered smothered chicken Mac Cheese  Chicken good  Mac n cheese much added salt pepper better   Son ordered kids cheeseburger   can't really mess basic slider  my martini delicious though  overall stick Bob Taylor's Ranch House steak cravings  LOVE PLACE! <EOR> Megan very attentive salad sandwich rates looked competitive    issue order but manager quickly rectified it   kids chicken fingers fries good portion    bread excellent    French Onion soup salty no front greet until 3 min arrived  <EOR> My husband hospitalized several days all he wanted when he discharged country fried steak gravy  tried nearby restaurant didn't see menu passed FireRock decided head back give them try   The inside beautiful  They've definitely turned around because still remembered building Stoney's North Forty wiped memory tonight   Our waitress Georjett service awesome  drinks never even close empty she overall fantastic  husband pleased see meal choice menu BBQ pork nachos  His food amazing   after trying bite steak corn told wished order country fried steak! nachos great too  Georjett suggested extra cheese made sure cheesy enough when she dropped them off  pork super tender delicious pico delicious  can't wait head back next date night! <EOR> Disappointed  No favorite wine white Zinfandel  Reisling OK  Sun dried tomato basil pasta more noodles anything else  Quiet music comfortable chairs  might try again but isn't top list  <EOR> I'm kind impressed but kind disappointed  work major steakhouse chain quality food hit miss  salmon cooked perfectly broccoli cheese more broccoli yellow water  traditional mojito tasted water  dirty Bleu martini garnished olives supposed blue cheese stuffed but belive some sort solid white eraser stuffed into only two olives  All all expecting lot better prices  <EOR> Great food!
