I've found local Chinese restaurant    I popped family night before opening  owners having massive family dinner but still sat big smiles enthusiasm   This your typical local Chinese joint  Lots familiar items along some Chef specials haven't seen anywhere else town    My favorite dish part menu Spicy Honey Chicken  Different Orange Chicken because more robust balanced flavor  didnt taste crispy chicken tossed syrup  Vegetables accompanied dish   The Hot n Sour soup delicious flavorful   Now item set place apart home made chili paste sauce  stuff dream made of  Spicy delicious heaven   This spot brand new family owned worth trip even if don't live side town   I can't wait come back! <EOR> Newly opened Chinese restaurant great price large portion food! Clean friendly service! Very nice family owned restaurant  month July 15% off   lunch prices very good <EOR> Try orange chicken also kungpao triple   Nommmm   good   Try spread word   Good portion too   Special June 15% off   <EOR> Decided come lunch because saw just opened  location Liu's actually bad  foresee busy lunch hour them during work week  Hopefully stay open unlike Mandarin Express street   Upon entering thought inside would look most Chinese take places  But actual sit down order service  sat server kid brought menu   I decided order 3 things  ordered pot stickers Mongolian beef chicken chow mein   Potstickers probably worst item ordered  soggy im used seared burnt crispy bottom potsticker  also meat size tip pinkie  rest just wrap potsticker   Mongolian Beef Good dish  flavor good  meat really tender  Only complaint meat small  lot meat  just cut small   Chicken Chow Mein dish also disappointment me  flavor dish good but everything else wasn't  noodles tasted firm almost raw chicken dry   Overall everything just OK   service good  Food came fast but just wasn't amazing  don't think would back often  Maybe once every 2 3 months  <EOR> Pork fried rice devine would come just this  waiter Vincent sweet funny general tso great   loved orange chicken fried ice cream yummy <EOR> Try salt pepper pork walnut shrimp! Delicious! Fast good service ! would definitely back! <EOR> Take ratings only  Hot Sour 4 stars Orange Chx 2 stars Kung Pao Chx breaded WTF 1 Star Pork Fried Rice 4 stars Lo  Mein 4 stars Free Egg Rolls Rangoon 2 stars Home made chili paste AWEFUL   please dont even try it     This place EH Rice N Noodle Baidu much better choices    <EOR> Finally! decent Chinese restaurant near house  chicken real chicken  frozen chicken  ordered family meal spices honey chicken pork broccoli  Didn't care pork broccoli  plain me  egg drop soup really yummy! soup update when order more stuff but meantime check them out! discount month July 2013 its better McDonalds  <EOR> 7 30 saw new place received few good reviews decided give try  service excellent  5 stars! refills kept coming food prepared brought timely manner  place clean ambiance standard yet relaxing  staff very well run efficient  waiter Titus very friendly  He even asked food basically asking if could give any constructive criticism  also introduced ourselves chatted bit  new places should treat customers!   Me friend ordered Family Meal 2 $21 75 which included choice Hot Sour Soup Egg Drop Soup Crab Rangoon Egg Roll Pork Fried Rice very generous portion  could $10 entree other places 2 entrees your choice  ordered Mongolian Beef Chicken Vegetables  Beverages relatively cheap well $1 50    I'd give food 3 5 4 stars  food fresh presentation vivid  could delicious depending your taste  really authentic style though  think chefs could opt food more but business standpoint think choose otherwise their clientele appears mostly locals surrounding neighborhood   Overall there's nothing wrong it! But I'd recommend places Chinatown area if want authentic  think hot sauce homemade  sure what's going  definitely unique  But just say normal Sriracha chili sauce would suffice    If you're area live nearby highly recommend giving place least once  did 15% off July customers door though ends today  maybe Yelpers time Nevertheless food decent value average $7 95 la carte steamed rice   didn't look but wouldn't doubt good lunch special well  OK time leftovers plenty!   Just well run service deserve returning business definitely back! <EOR> I great experience dining Liu's today  service very pleasant  felt very welcomed food made happy  Vincent made feel talking old friend just happened work restaurant    The Chow Fun done extremely well  ratio vegetables noodles meat perfect IMHO  veggies nice sear them still nice crunch them   A big surprise Beijing Pork Chops  If describe would ask imagine mellow sweet sour pork but spicy minus batter  level spiciness dish mild but still enough satisfy craving heat    I hear good things salt pepper dishes some other entrees going come back     So came back before posted original review ahead tell Salt Pepper Pork excellent blend salt spice aromatics  am big fan meat bone just imparts certain element flavor just don't when meat cooked boneless   Having already tried Beef Chow Fun decided try Vegetable Chow Fun  equally good if better because all extra veggies  am usually more carnivore but may end ordering again when come back  My new favorite item BBQ Spare Rib  four bone appetizer ordering two them next visit  ribs done exceptionally well crispy slightly charred exterior juicy bite same time  No shortness flavor here  tasted marinated over night salty sweet Asian marinade BBQ'd care  run item before when can   This place pumping some excellent Chinese cuisine  <EOR> If you're looking chinese food doesn't involve little round balls tossed orange sauce place be   love picking bones fried pork chops sucking bbq pork ribs   restaurant does cuisine well right   absolutely love place hope come back again again  <EOR> Delicious big portions low prices! friend lunch specials just u def $11 total!!!
