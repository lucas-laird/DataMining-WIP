The service great tho! waiter Lloyd very welcoming always ready serve us    I recommend people come early IF want seated served right away else waiting LONG time  <EOR> STAY AWAY! Better off cooking your own food home  Friday night course going long wait 45 min  which expected   Waiting room area stuffy  Other guest very upset before party came waiting hour  seat people first come first serve but tables available explained hostess  understand NEW establishment SOFT OPENING but truly franchise Philippines difference run new restaurant States?! just could it  When visit Jollibee PI seems run smoothly  All servers hostess nice friendly    So dinner Didn't trouble finding parking walked front lot people waiting finally called name party 3  sat booth area  Jaki waitress comes asks wanted drink just water all around now    Water came 10 minutes having hunt down asked water again  caught Jaki when she took order table next then immediately ordered but no Pancit Palabok no pork sisig  so now? She recommended pancit canton chicken sisig  ok did chicken ordered too  order comes around chicken ok chicken sisig mayo no vinegar taste even sizzling hot plate pancit tasted instant batch buy yourself  check hunting down again then didn't see another 15 min   15 min run card? wow found MGR took 5 min back total 20 min check here   I'm asking high top notch service but timely service least expected some good Filipino food  Try yourself if dare! <EOR> My Aunt Uncle came dinner first time   am sorry say disappointed restaurant   worth hype   Aunt Uncle told would 30 40 min wait   met them still waiting   finally seated waiter don't even know name if he even introduced himself took order   seemed he wasn't paying attention he felt he being rushed because he kept disappearing every time would say something   He first asked if wanted some drinks told wanted   He then disappeared again   Took awhile come back drinks   finally ordered main dishes took them awhile bring plates   table sitting plate settings missing fork but rest other utensils forks them   kept asking things where waiter should checked if needed anything   Big Fail   We ordered Kare Kare Sinigang Baboy Crispy Pata famous Chicken   am sorry say disappointed Kare Kare Crispy Pata   Kare Kare more vegetables meat   Fail   Crispy Pata wasn't crispy enough   Failed again   Sinigang Baboy good but better   Chicken good ate all   The waiter once asked if everything good   once waiter came refill waters drinks   literally ask waiter refill drink   Failed again   original drink Pepsi when asked refill refilled Ice Tea instead   Double Fail   Don't even bother worth trip   Even though still soft opening need massive organization many more name   just hope fix quirks before grand opening few weeks  <EOR> I Max's  friend's birthday really disappointed   could understand flaws food since just opened  While waiting food which took while observing manager Nico name tag  First saw smiling giggling while talking some female waiters but then few mins later saw talking male waiter seemed he scolding him  Telling someone mistake thing but yelling being rude manager Nico towards male waiters unacceptable   really feel bad waiters point wanted confront manager but figured should just put yelp people would know if upper management Max's reading please something it  Max location four times its obvious lack coordination good management   Food okay but impressive    One more thing table beside found fly food but apparently does matter because still billed orders  just replaced food moved if big deal finding fly your food  name waiter Kurt   And please don't let employees open cuts serve even near food because healthy hazard    Oh saw Nico touching female waiter's back  wonder if  part job   If want positive feedback people then changes made start employees food  <EOR> 3 5 stars but round 4 because don't deserve average 2 half stars  came 2 others making party 3 Friday night  everyone said reviews wait 45 minutes which true  Although other patrons start complaining other parties getting called before them hosts nicely explain based availability tables order come in  C'on people give them break just opened expect them everything perfect within first few weeks?! management team running place probably more restaurant experience anyway  Jackie server she pretty good most part  didn't wait long food because think she rushed kitchen since asked much longer would before food served  order chicken sisig pancit canton whole chicken  Shoulda just ordered chicken everyone said  Although did enjoy pancit canton because used different type noodle  other hand sisig just mess what's mayo?! didn't vinegar traditional way  read another review flop mayo called sisig which true don't recommend ordering this  wait good 20 minutes pay because supposedly credit card machine acting but Jackie very apologetic this  must say service did experience overall better  Lastly interior pretty nice beautiful Filipino standards  Next time need chicken fix just order take out  <EOR> I understand just opened wait long but if customers willing try them wait seated served     think then least customer service should pleasant food delicious would receive repeat customers  But family did experience any these  portions small way overpriced  perfectly honest find whole fried chicken made order Pinoy Pinay Restaurant more delicious crispy very flavorful  fact family enjoy Pinoy Pinay 's food better without inflated price  <EOR> I've dined Max's Glendale Ca few times  ecstatic hear opening Las Vegas  mind set eating Max's Beef Caldereta dish served Max's Glendale Ca Garlic Rice   Unfortunately its served location  location just serving basics   I Chicken Sigsig Whole Chicken Garlic Rice Halo Halo    The Chicken Sigsig lacked flavor  tasted mayo mixed day old chicken slices jalapeno  better tasting Sigsig recommend dining Cafe Moda   The Whole Chicken moist tender  enjoyed crunching crispy chicken skin  Though still don't know hype over chicken's flavor  guess lacked chicken   The Garlic Rice good    Lastly ordered Halo Halo  Delicious! best all Las Vegas   The wait staff polite friendly   By way don't ask water  Its tap unfiltered hard water  Ask bottled water   In conclusion food bland lacks authentic flavor menu items over priced  wouldn't come back entrees until Max's Beef Caldereta put menu try   now continue dine Max's Glendale CA  However come back Halo Halo   My recommendation Max's lower prices especially when food good just starting out serve authentic food  <EOR> I totally agree Joyce Ellen F's comment  said soft opening still 5 00p m  9 00p m  course door opens 5 00 take 45 minutes finish dinner  6 00 7 00 would lesser wait  liked ambiance service  Please give generous 10% tip $1   Thanks <EOR> Serving portions small somewhat say overpriced  didn't sisig when within first two weeks opening  food came different times which unacceptable opinion  server ok  Based observation doesn't look trained  actually more concerned cleaning tables rather taking care actual customers  Overall very displeased experience  <EOR> We sat down ordered then checked saw bad ratings started worried but nothing bad happened trip  new restaurant seems experiencing growing pains learning stuff while being crazy busy times all buzz Max's here   We Max's chicken fried way supposed moist signature light crisp skin  garlic rice standard but good overly oily  just Philippines few weeks ago chicken cooked same way there    Pancit palabok  decent enough  saucier side which actually prefer some places don't give enough sauce me   Our service good  He really friendly kept drinks  turnaround time food coming table wasn't long either    No matter Max's never during dinner peak times definitely Sundays when Filipinos flock church large groups hot spot Filipino birthday parties  wait probably piss off while food decent worth waiting hour seat don't yourself     It's open only 2 3 weeks hope only more consistent here  glad sit down Filipino restaurant though since rarely eat Filipino food  hope visits just positive one  <EOR> Great place unique food  Great service!

Why would always equate Filipino food cheap cafeteria food? Yes carinderia food like Tita's San Diego but always want present best food refined way  course having better versions food mean higher prices  example don't expect pay cheap good Italian pasta  Same thing Filipino cuisine  think should support kinds restaurants proliferate elevated version traditional Filipino cuisine    Update comment past reviews talked waiter  He said horrible start because didn't expect huge crowds came when first opened  He said compromised quality food because huge amount food short span time  pretty normal now   Haven't bad experience yet 4 stars   Last note wish didn't close Max's San Diego CA  should open Mira Mesa classier area SD high concentration upper middle class Filipinos  Eastlake area  sad when move Vegas  Anyway we'll back!!!! take parents when visit since rarely LA own anyway  happy found Max's Vegas  <EOR> Las Vegas definitely needed Max's restaurant finally one  All food cooked perfection   Sinigang Pancit Kare Kare   etc   definitely recommend dine Max's! <EOR> This 2nd visit soft opening essentially second chance    Pros very few Courteous staff very apologetic inadequate supply favorite menu items  i e  Lechon Kawali Pork Sisig Calamansi  Clean dining bar area  Most likely cause just opened  We'll see long that'll last Cons Servers competent job description forgetful serving basics  i e  Always drink orders first before taking food orders any food come informing patrons items currently unavailable forgetting bring dessert portion meal which included when ordering combo meals Restaurant only half full yet waiting area front nearly packed wait 10 mins appears slow night    With said may new restaurant area but popular successful chain Philippines California   no excuse any short comings inexperience opening new location  RETURNING!!!
