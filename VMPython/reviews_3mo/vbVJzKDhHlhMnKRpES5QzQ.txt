I almost didn't come eat tonight because am into eating really spicy food  But visiting friend's store mutual friends dropped visit invited try popular Chinese restaurant Alhambra CA  just opened Chinatown   While walking over even discussing why particular spot host quite few failed restaurants past few years spite fact restaurant next door always seems busy   We arrived right 5pm already crowd standing presumably waiting open table  restaurant sparsely decorated Chinese opera masks acting ornamental points interests otherwise unremarkable interior walls establishment   But don't think anyone really paid attention them   After glancing through menu party picked two appetizer portioned items immediately while debating which entree items ordered  end opted following 1  Pork Garlic Sauce ????  89  Wonton Red Chili Sauce ????  22  Boiled Fish Green Pepper Sauce ???  56  Toothpick Lamb Cumin ????  The first two items must!  literally order able down 2 4 bowls rice Chinese comfort food  sauce secret trump card nearly divine deliciousness sadly vegetarian friendly  But does affect me  pork sliced thin cooked chef obviously perfected dishes  wonton good but version Red Chili Sauce superb!!! Major nom nom time soon servers dropped off two dishes!!!  The Toothpick Lamb Cumin decent but pale comparison #1 #89    The Boiled Fish Green Pepper Sauce ??? listed being spicy but nice flavor overwhelmingly spicy we asked them spicy great recommendation waiter   Overall place probably opened more few days Las Vegas already predict major success story  food good shut take money good   Servers busy number tables wait but did admirable job it   Menu price higher expected but superior execution dish easily justified   Plus whole time dine clear restaurant packed only super informed Asians mainly Chinese patrons major indicator superiorness    I highly recommend all come check them but preferably am sick dining two month am already seated table waiting food   So keep DL  Only share wonderful recommendation your dearest friend intend marry  Otherwise everyone hour wait just people visiting Alhambra Rosemead locations   So hush x4  <EOR> They very authentic Chengdu Food! boyfriend My boyfriend American Chinese when back China visited Chengdu last December ate Sichuan Tan Tan noodles  Chengdu Taste's Tan Tan noodles just taste exactly same Chengdu! bf looking same taste long time! now found Vegas! <EOR> Heard Chengdu Taste restaurant Alhambra but never around going when we're area  Now Vegas give try  ordered * mung bean jelly noodle chili sauce cold noodle dish  flavor very good  ordered mild but still really spicy   * fish green pepper sauce rated Jonathan Gold best dishes LA  don't know if I'd far saying its good but good  Maybe lacked little flavor but fish cooked perfectly  buttah   * toothpick lamb cumin love taste cumin always favorite dish Sichuan restaurants  must say theirs best had  could eat everyday    I definitely recommend restaurant if you're into spicy style Chinese cooking  RIP Yunnan Garden next door which serves same style food  They'll probably going business  Lol  Can't wait back try different dishes  Everything looks good tasted far sure won't disappointed  <EOR> Szechuan style food which pretty much means majority items spicy  Big portions come appetite  Stumbled restaurant accident due Yu Nnan being full but regretting it    Side note Hip hop RnB music playing which different but wife enjoyed it  <EOR> This probably best Schezuan restaurants Las Vegas America??  unfortunately able share motherland  only wish     Wonton chili oil 4 5 stars  love spicy food usually order because combination wontons tad spice  least spiciest version had however dare say best wontons ever had  meat filling legit  packed  amazing flavors  able taste marinade inside filling juicy too! wonton skin also perfectly cooked  not soggy    Boiled fish green pepper sauce 4 stars   I guess Jonathan Gold approved  But Mr  Gold don't always agree ahem Lotus Siam just chillin' wondering if we'd same page time  grown love spicy dishes peppercorn but usually ordered reddish sauce other restaurants  broth clear delicious looking but turns saw article time broth meant eaten  fish cooked perfectly but personally prefer dish other types meats also red sauce stew  also isn't spicy IMHO until eat peppercorn  Then good luck  better sure water its way    Chicken garlic sauce 4 5 stars  first best most fave version Paris  Yeah strange but dish closest had  chicken cooked perfectly flavor POINT  best Vegas far  FYI cold dish    Toothpick Cumin lamb 5 stars  My favorite dish night  lamb chunks nice sized meats cooked perfection flavor amazing  highly recommend it!!!!!

I'll definitely again! <EOR> Awesome place!   The food authentic comes great portion very reasonable price  noticed already three stores Cali before opened fourth Vegas  Obviously brought Cali standard over Vegas which really wise considering many legitimate Szechuan food restaurants Vegas before  came Vegas almost year ago opened time  Obviously gathered quite lot popularity less year    If am visiting Vegas again definitely come back  <EOR> Like local  If want some real Chinese food place should go  sure spicy food before go! <EOR> As Chengdu native extremely picky Sichuan food    I love place! used LA locations everytime when traveling there    There some really authenitic well known American home style dishes served including flour steamed pork chili oil chicken  <EOR> Love lamb toothpicks beef tofu  Definitely recommend choose it   The place used another restaurant making similar food but now under new management  new owner remodeled place looks lot cleaner  whole store brighter  food very good  peppercorn numbing  food isn't just spicy but many layers flavored  Everything very fresh    Will come again when Vegas  <EOR>
