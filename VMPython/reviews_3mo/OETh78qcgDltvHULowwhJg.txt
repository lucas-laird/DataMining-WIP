My dinner companions all steak fllet which HUGE other 3 fatty steak  Sorry can't remember which one  also huge no could finish entire steak  hindsight should split 2 steaks could saved some money  only complaint heard 75 year old father in law said steak fatty  Well duh  Next time order filet!  But all all fantastic meal  only wish more time enjoy rush off show missed dessert   Will back next time plenty time big appetite  <EOR> I am big fan great New York Strip Steak place fantastic  initially bit concerned would those Celebrity Puts Name Mediocre Product Entice People Buy but extremely happy proven wrong  fun contemporary setting trendy atmosphere delicious drinks place right  medium rare steak cooked perfection fingerling potatoes macaroni cheese made delicious sides  server professional pleasant he didn't wander far away never saw again but he wasn't helicopter  fact all staff members very friendly  If server off helping other patrons able ask other friendly employees whatever needed brought right over  really enjoyed ourselves would definitely eat again  Great job everyone  <EOR> I really wanted give restaurant 5 stars because price but fan most tasted three stars is  presentation food stunning  wine list presented iPad which nice touch  bread brought start die for  good ordered another round! Next shared Kobe sliders appetizer  advertised having Cheddar caramelized onions but all could taste mustard seed seasoning  am mustard fan three bites done  Next beef Wellington which whole reason excited there  Again all could taste mustard seed seasoning beef  very disappointed  pastry garnishes plate delicious just ate those  also side macaroni cheese which passable but taste blue cheese little overpowering  Dessert cheesecake which flavored lemon some reason  came strawberries blueberries no reason enhanced lemon  Overall fun albeit expensive experience  Perhaps palette unrefined but can't see covering beef mustard ever good idea  Unless mustard guess  <EOR> LOUD music far loud  asked staff if always way said yes many people complain it  Mr  Ramsay pays such attention detail right down red zippers hostess' dresses yet assaults sense hearing deafening techno  Why? If he reason all ears   The wait staff all superb  detail addressed   insanely picky actual food delivery could nicer mean plates presented  Yes things matter all add sense formality would want when going fancy dinner   The mirrored meat cart very good idea theory however its execution say looks rather silly  am sure many hours spent designing crafting but think looks cheap  does fit well rest decor least while sitting table trying hear over loud music waiter showing describing   The ingredients fresh aged meat very nice asparagus soup terrific short ribs fell right off bone pork chop among best but most food 3 5 stars  Something missing   Nice try <EOR> For anniversary Misses new Gordon Ramsey Steak  Overall experience great but quite five stars   We began ordering drinks Ipad  definitely added fun twist experience  However also ensures no misunderstandings drink orders  Both $14 bit much but down quite smooth    We seated next kitchen  la Hell's Kitchen cooks work within view diners  No screams RAW instead see each fancy dish made!  Our waiter very attentive first question fan Hell's Kitchen? When affirmed he laid down special prix fixe menu left few minutes  *Hint avoid menu unless signed commemorative menu worth $135 per person!  Instead settled Beef Wellington Two  meat moist red center leaving great taste  Combined gouda ham baked potato asparagus topped morels delicious dinner  However prices cheap even steakhouse standards   Furthermore waiter seemed hell bent selling bottle wine  He kept emphasizing cheapest Robert Mondavi for ONLY $64    Despite such pushiness point unfriendliness bottled water far enough  Another waiter explained restaurant orders 3 4 bottling company's annual production  If want try better visit restaurant!  Finally sure sign Total Rewards  card leads lower prices most entrees  <EOR> This far best dining experience ever had  things stood most service received server Mathew   moment sat down he did amazing job making feel only table restaurant  He also introduced new beer quickly made its way front beer fridge La Fin Du Monde     Of course going into Gordon Ramsay's expect GREAT food didn't disappoint   New York Strip cooked perfection rest entrees others party  <EOR> Went Saturday night anniversary celebration dinner   meals superb   lovely selection bread delectable appetizers started meals off right   lobster chorizo appetizer $28 husband Caesar salad $17    lobster perfectly cooked tender   Strangely enough though chorizo very mild couldn't really taste any typical chorizo flavor spicy heat it   Maybe more European version chorizo?  husband's Caesar salad came Scotch quail egg which perfectly crispy outside yet light lots flavor   We beef Wellington two $100 which took some time served but worth it!  savored every bite beef packed flavor flaky pastry crust mushroom paste covering inside     I decided try HK antioxidant cocktail $14 which smooth refreshing   flavors fruity perfect together   While enjoyed meal service off   such fine establishment where paying lot money your meal really expect nothing but friendliness attentiveness wait staff   most part true   However main server seemed disinterested wasn't very friendly throughout whole meal   When came ordering dessert stuffed couldn't possibly eat any more but really wanted take something back hotel later   asked sticky toffee pudding initially server wouldn't let order because ice cream would melt he said   told heading right hotel room afterwards room freezer   some discussion he finally said he could pack but without ice cream   Once again room freezer ice cream wouldn't melt but whatever OK eating without ice cream   Eating later perhaps ice cream would helped cut very sweet nature dessert almost cloyingly sweet tastes   P S   If Total Rewards casino card any Harrah's owned establishment give few dollars off each item order but if pay your rewards points your total based normal non discount price  <EOR> Fantastic drink wine menu   Interesting appetizers real hand care regarding menu   One feels almost hugged combination flavors   The Maine Lobster chorizo appetizer phenomenal   Bread choices before your meal beautifully executed   At every turn service front wave flavor  We Wellington disappointed   The trolley beef cuts very interesting customers see hear where meats raised  The Sticky Toffee Pudding REAL DEAL served beautiful carmelized sugar ice cream   Coffees served chocolate liqueur popsicles real extra touch  Staff helpful happy working fine establishment   I'd spend another $200  <EOR> One memorable meals didn't even order entree   I'm big fan Gordon Ramsay British version Kitchen Nightmares  guy  U K  show  awesome  briefly met Ramsay gotten couple cookbooks signed  But never eaten Ramsay restaurant   I evening myself Vegas but didn't really budget full on expensive meal thought would try visit GRS try something just experience    As solo diner seat bar  No problem  nice bar great service  ordered Onion Soup  While waiting couple locals sat down first time Steak well  chatted bit  More them later    The Onion Soup stellar  Thick slick full flavor  bar menu lower priced Fois Gras came in house made English Muffins jam  week dreamt those English muffins  Forget your nooks crannies smaller you're used but crisp side Fois Gras amazing whole thing worked weird sort PBJ assemblage    The couple next turned nicest people world offered couple bites steak  refused  insisted  Okay!
