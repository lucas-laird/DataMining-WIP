Well everything just actually left still kind hungry but hungry enough shell few more bucks something else   Service could improved well  would think when write down orders large table little notes right then instead making everyone wait   lets nice round down 10 15 probably lot longer while sort bills  <EOR> Delighted new option area  Staff professional attentive  restaurant lively structural changes Nora's excellent loved mirrors food prepared perfection   chicken entree outstanding  <EOR> I loved atmosphere cocktails great   food made fresh high end ingredients   back dinner menu most exicting me  <EOR> This pleasant neighborhood experience   Very friendly staff   Food very good   Very nice steak  Fish fresh well cooked   entrees served sides   refreshing wasn't la carte   steak served delicious creamed spinach very good shoestring fries   Overall very good bordering excellent experience   Nice job   would back   Prices moderate   strip steak $28 aforementioned sides  Much better value overpriced steak houses around Las Vegas  <EOR> Rick wonderful food worth price tag  People caught quantity when quality pay for   Wonderful decor even down plates    We fry clams calamari  Delicious but ricotta app neighbors looked mouth watering  Going entrees brick chicken best life  chicken dream when watching those stupid chicken dinner commercials then some  Boyfriend New York stake loved it  Needed order side Mac cheese since he stole most mine  fantastic!

Very shabby chic Pottery Barn ish  Ok onto food ordered infamous Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich compared Chik Fil A now only Chik Fil A once don't remember being life changing having craving but sandwich very comforting think liked chopped salad came better! shared friends grilled cheese think prefered sandwich mine Im biased eat cheese bread ALL day ERRR day   tried layered chocolate cake loved cardamom it brown bag apple pie favorite! didn't try any cocktails seemed little don't know word much me? ingredients scared me  service great chef manager several servers checking constantly  can't wait back try dinner menu  <EOR> Amazing food but croweded due new attraction <EOR> Absolutely delicious      came lunch Wednesday wife really excited try new restaurant since heard nothing but rave reviews! Well satisfaction really lived all hype!     Now wasn't impressed because complexity dish rather simple fresh deliciously put together ingredients  ordered Crispy chicken sandwich wife decided try grilled cheese which can't remember exact menu name  Both amazing wouldn't hesitate order same exact meal again     Final impression? am very excited such great new restaurant area  feeling Honey Salt going around long time! <EOR> Finally chance try trendiest place town eat at  live south side journey traveling all way just grab bite lunch  passed Rampart Commons numerous times but never actually shopped any stores  immediately notice more half cars luxury cars range rovers appearing most welcome Summerlin guess?   Anyway Honey Salt tucked corner larger sign would probably help them more noticeable don't already good marketing tactics  Apon walking inside remember walls mainly composed bricks  restaurant definitely trying give off farm vibe but definitely modern classy same time  chandelier farm though? Haha guess accent piece   already knew going order chicken sandwich because Misti Anthony said reviews  Chick Fil crack ay? Prior food arriving received bread crispy things almost pita chips but much thinner  bread very similar even identical Filipinos call pan de sal but wheat version  Nothing special but cripy things rather good fun dip into white bean dip puree according friend? food came pretty quick maybe 15 minutes so? friend raved good kale salad last time she point she even dreamt it  Thankfully chicken sandwich came salad kale looking forward since never kale before  chicken sandwich rather stuffed but  expect when paying $13  breading chicken pretty good honey mustard probably favorite part  Usually isn't enough sauce sandwiches but prefect amount  Nice slaw inside sandwich well  Overall good but don't know if something back flips over if know mean? side salad mainly composed edamame little bit kale lot seeds I don't know kind was but which good  Maybe some type vinaigrette would nice? friend ordered meatballs offered bite okay too  server Julie pretty good except felt point kind lost her  service definitely better expected based early reviews when first started  Lastly ordered chocolate cake dessert! OMG good probably best pieces cake ever had  3 layer cake banana cake middle  thought really nice wouldn't overwhelming chocolate  frosting outside cake light fluffy overly sweet   think if came again might just order dessert since other options seem delicious  <EOR> Five stars service Sergio food ambience overall dining experience  definitely back!!!

edamame dip? If why isn't green? BTW bread lavosh totally unremarkable  Several minutes later edamame sprinkled some citrus zest  end adding some salt pepper because bland  shocker when bill shows charged $7 edamame! both instantly infuriated  wouldn't ordered edamame begin certainly $7! mood argue server and or manager tipped less normally would even wrote brief note why  tolerate slow inattentive service certain degree but deception trickery run bill  looked around noted few other tables said yes edamame well  found odd none other numerous Yelp reviews tips mention non complimentary edamame   In summary food itself rates 3 stars  Deceptive aggressive upcharging knocks down 2 star experience overall   Consider yourself warned  JUST SAY NO EDAMAME! COMPLIMENTARY DEFINITELY WORTH $7! <EOR> Heard all hype very excited when client planned meeting here!  I checked reviews YELP see must try!   Walked immediately greeted   Love decor   simple sweet detailed  Unique look Vegas    Waitress very friendly attentive   Tried Tuscan Bean soup  Nice light broth beans vegetables  could used little salt but overall good    I ordered Big Eye Tuna!!!  Yum! Wasabi encrusted seared tuna   served side spinach pickled onion orange rind salad  FRESH tasting delicious    We passed dessert although everything menu sounded fantastic!  Can't wait back dinner lunch again check another item menu!
