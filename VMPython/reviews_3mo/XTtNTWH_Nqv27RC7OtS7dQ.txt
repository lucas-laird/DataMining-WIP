A beautiful atmosphere flowers everywhere   Service attentive professional warm knowledgeable    I would liked more extensive cocktail menu  whiskey pours pretty short   Not cheap but thought reasonable price high quality     We also breakfast lemon ricotta pancakes weren't very good super bland came fake chemical maple syrup instead real stuff  sure specify real!   I'll back!! Hoping continue improve already great place  <EOR> We breakfast  disappointed Wynn Encore closed Society Cafe its previous breakfast place   good  food service   able order traditional bacon egg breakfast off menu just ask!  Service excellent   chairs comfortable   negative   acoustics terrible  mean terrible  hear everyone's cutlery clinking   food overpriced  <EOR> Jardin recently opened Encore having replaced Botero Society Cafe  cuisine essential Society Cafe but more elegant less casual but all honesty everything Wynn Encore isn't casual  If remember Society Cafe you'll notice plate ware flatware same! Save where right? P food all amazing expected  service lacking just smidgen but could've because waitress training someone else  only hiccup she mistakenly switched crab legs another crab dish time crab legs ready rest meal came out    For cocktails full bar course but also Mule Cart going around restaurant making Moscow Mules mixed mules amazing  ordered orange great! ended ordering another each time he came around! If big party he big services 16! appetizers flatbread which basically entire pizza  expected small rectangular size maybe 4 small pieces total but full pizza  But delicious nonetheless  said also King Crab legs  However weren't same you'd find buffet  photo show 2 tiny pieces already taken legs  delicious but expected  entrees ordered oven baked prawns which came bed rice  6 prawns decent size deliciously seasoned  rice bit al dente me  also ordered short rib ravioli which apparently great  However 5 raviolis  side order oven baked mac cheese which huge side order but delicious  course excited try potted planter chocolate cake  Everything edible  break open pot you'll find most decadent non overwhelming cake dark chocolate mousse  must try! But just one  2 people couldn't finish it  Overall 8 10 based price vs  quantity ratio  Would back just Moscow Mules cake! <EOR> Visually restaurant looked great  menu even looked good offer  decided birthday then see show Le Reve best show town way   seated thought private table  Well every 30 seconds buser getting into storage table     Then employees belly aching set complaining each other      We ordered pizza 2 lobster rolls      The lobster terrible bread just bad      The only saving grace night Joseph manager  He really took charge made made feel birthday       He great!!!!!! Sorry say many places town never back there!!!!!!! Maggianos right across street its great place!!! <EOR> My husband recently stayed Encore Wynn decided breakfast brunch morning Jardin  decor service both lovely  husband short rib sliders enjoyed them  ordered maine lobster benedict  no egg love world more poached egg  Well received 2 hard eggs benedict  know poaching eggs art however calibur restaurant no excuse improperly poaching egg  Honestly prices restaurant would recommend anyone here  mind spending $30 nice properly prepared brunch myself  mind spending much when food prepared properly  <EOR> Terrible  Don't bother  Does compare former amazing Society Cafe    Plastic cups bring your wine go??  Fake flowers  cheesy  <EOR> In line shoddy spectacle Vegas place looks great but doesn't necessary sophistication taste justify triple digit check brunch two    The classic eggs Benedict made right but nothing proud especially given price  potatoes lacked flavor hollandaise sauce felt plain frothy    The Challah bread French toast nice but again nothing great    We blood ruby orange mimosas $16 each just disappointed  just price taste just worth it! <EOR> Eww  Don't beef short rib taco  beef dry hard tasted pork  give very little guacamole entree  Flavorless entree  Terrible service  waitress looked pained take order bothering if needed something  Unfriendly inattentive  Probably because include gratuity large party  only but they'll tax top top pre add  star Mac cheese appetizer bread another star beautiful decor  <EOR> At Wynn decided try new restaurant Jardin  First off room looks great lots flowers great views pools outside  Society dark gaudy patio furniture   We checked the hostess very nice  We decided try Moscow mule cart very cool!  Service smooth waiter very attentive  We ordered octopus yellowtail flowed salmon cioppino  The octopus best ever had!  salmon cioppino tasted great cooked perfectly   We finished off flower pot cake wow  Very unique tasted great!  Looking forward next trip there  <EOR> Horrible  Where start? dutifully let hostess know when made reservation would needing vegan menu  When came she whisking table she pointed tray desserts said don't want know desserts you? Um guess not  several minutes before someone cane take drink order  Apparently waiter Roger busy fella going fill sec  Ok  ordered Dandelion cocktail some water  20 minutes same fella came back said Roger really backed take your order  Mkay  ordered Buffalo cauliflower appetizer red curry braised tempeh entree  cauliflower really good  Then sat interminablr amount time empty water glass crappy cocktail no breadsticks watched guy spend 30 minutes setting table 6 he Mr Carson Queen coming dinner  Did mention tables around bread? Then some guy ridiculous cart copper cups asked if wanted Moscow mule  No but I'd some water  somepoint mess tempeh arrived horrible   When person assume roger dropped dessert menu table Visibly ticked off  manager some kind came around nice since fuming  excuse Mr Wynn going coming dinner  He comped tempeh stormed 37 dollars poorer  hope sake Mr Wynn did show poor excuse restaurant  <EOR> Saw advertisement Jardin decided give try  big fan Wynn Encore casinos but never eaten there  usually reservations but lazy just walked seated within 10mins  decore open airy beautiful flowers  toss between chicken sandwich chicken waffles French toast  decided French Toast Cajun Bloody Mary  Bloody Mary very good food good also  would recommend Jardin Breakfast Brunch  <EOR> Pretty restaurant! came brunch expectations low due slightly empty restaurant  Looked over menu your standard brunch fare few unique items  friend chicken waffles lemon ricotta pancakes  Both portions decent very good! chicken moist juicy seasoned well! Sorta pricey but  understandable Vegas casino  Now want come back try dinner items! <EOR> Forgettable food but unmatched ambiance   Buffalo cauliflower pretty good   service timing exceptionally poor  did bring app before meal but then accidentally brought extra entree return   Then through meal no attention wanted round drinks  ordered but drinks did come 10+ minutes arrived check  <EOR> Good steak  Ran wagu steak Tuesday  nite   Came medium when ordered medium rare  Decent but 3 stars most  <EOR> I am staying hotel came down because seemed really nice spot lunch outside pool very long flight  venue itself really pretty but service received wasn't  best  expected more considering location  busy all but waitress forgot drink then wasn't around 15 minutes  done eating looking check  food good but experience nothing special worth price  <EOR> My wife came long walk Strip  First all ambience relaxed colorful surrounding elegant flowers pool setting outside  following Grandma's Chicken Meatballs $14  Chopped Kale Salad $14  Sea Scallop Cioppino $29  Hot Pot $20  Biegnets Raspberry Sauce $10  The chicken meatballs absolutely divine! probably best chicken meatballs maybe meatballs general ever tasted  tender but still good texture tomato sauce ricotta cheese helped dish add more flavors  kale salad good  Next time though would ask dressing side bc dressed pretty well  liked apple slices which made refreshing  cioppino tasted good but thought small portion $29 scallops small variety  wife's hot pot consisted kurobota pork kimchee fried rice fried egg  thought good but worth $20  dessert fantastic! beignets surprisingly light airy acidic raspberry sauce balance it  service great  waiter described detail menu  FYI menu does include allergen guide which shows customer focused resto is  give 4 5 stars bc ambience service great food tasted pretty good  chicken meatballs beignets 10 10 execution taste  <EOR> First time jardins very impressed service decor most important food  Made reservations brunch seated right away  Loved everything place would definitely back dinner  <EOR> Food total ripped off  spent $30 bucks sea scallop dish came only 3 scallops little bigger mine thumb  tasted normal  Luckily came some bread couple glasses help filled stomach  If paid just decoration then ok otherwise should eat first before come here  <EOR>
