11am 2pm free green black tea your lunch which sweetened unsweetened   Taiwanese popcorn chicken hubby son LUVED it   Popcorn chicken boring hard chewy but delicate crunch light but savory seasoning comes basil leaves   Mmmmmm   ordered 2 plates didn't take any home   friend ordered chicken wings didn't feel trying them coz looked dry didn't care much said wasn't much flavor chicken itself skip this     For bowls hubby Rib Eye Kimchi bowl   Let's start off Kimchi bowl when served adorable containers over live fire even mild spice level broth EXTREMELY spicy   more manageable when fire under bowl put off but man sweatin!  broth very tasty enjoyed mix meat vegetables seafood pseudo seafood elements bowl   beef shrimp scallop squid mussel clams    works   Add few more meat toppings 2 people share bowl extra cup rice   definitely enjoyed both filling broth bowl much more husband's order which thought quiet bland     However wonderful condiment pronounced sha tsa sauce which reminds marriage between chili paste bagoong shrimp paste    friend said called Chinese barbecue sauce made dried scallops   very addicting bump flavor your hotpot your liking     If into hotpots sharing clearing stuffy nose definitely stop Pot Tea   Teehee   Seriously they've some good stuff! <EOR> This place ok  lot better shitty booming pot mini pot spot  probably best personal mini Hotpot Vegas  need Boiling Point already! Anyways popcorn chicken good  personal pots good sized lots meats veggies etc  only downfall hope fix later down road when order add meat ever $3 50 actually give paid instead 2 slices rib eye    add photo which pretty sad looking  Besides messed wife's pot  She ordered kimchi received seafood one  Which wasn't big deal quick prompt fixing it  <EOR> Best first time experience!

Service bit faster but well worth it  They're very stingy minced pork rice lol but again still good  <EOR> I sad see New Day Cafe gone since favorite breakfast joints  intrigued Pot Tea Social House   finally tried place first time wow   loved it!!!! Friendly helpful staff  Refreshing fruit n milk teas good hearty hot pot soups!! Seafood vegetarian beef varieties  pot feeds two!! Very reasonable nice decor   Definitely back!! <EOR> This best hot pot place ever  quality meat vegetables fresh  tell broth made very well  service good servers easy talk to  sure everything need helpful when ordered food  favorite thing pot tea refill your hot pot more broth!! hot pot portion looks small but easily two people full satisfied  bf made mistake getting each hotpot couldn't even finish half it and eat lot   wish could give restaurant more 5 stars  <EOR> This restaurant new clean nice  service great  waitress took time explain menu show size pot  didn't any appetizer  spicy beef pot hubby seafood tofu pot  All hotpot's price $11 99 except one   Although presentation neat but broth tasted very plain  Actually no flavor all  hope some kind fish sauce salt table  very good! <EOR> Perfect place Hot Pot good atmosphere fast friendly service great prices  If come between hours 11am 2pm free tea  <EOR> I actually surprised good was  haven't pot tea ever  first time say back! <EOR> Friendly staff good services! Food good but very spicy  recommend getting mild if spicy enough bring some more soup  <EOR> This place perfect people love hot foods  liked way cooked presentation cute  fire burned little more would wanted but problem easily solved workers putting fire    I ordered lobster hot pot mild spice really good  lobster didn't much flavoring inside but balanced well pork broth added  lobster took most space but perfect lobster lovers!  Next ordered Japanese Miso pot medium spice  tad bit spicy but delicious  becomes more spicy when boiling turn off fire less spicy    The service nice very friendly  also stamp card! addition pricing good cheap side    I would ask improve rice quality  Maybe bit softer suggest    They open three months now wish them much success future! <EOR> good neighborhood hotpot place   one thing sets place apart all other hotpot places area clean arguably trendy place  probably only hotpot place area where bring your gf date  fancy date but place mismatched plates bossy middle aged asian women giving stink eye   pros presentation hot pot good  flavor decent  maybe best boba neighborhood?  cons service bit slow which sure why since all serve hotpot  shouldn't immediate? most flavorful    overall good addition neighborhood  clean  decent  definitely coming back  <EOR> Food ordered chicken which yummy  Reminded Chinese crispy pork flavor some reason   I Japanese miso spicy level medium   thought good sized portion variety vegetables some seafood pork  also ordered extra side beef which thought also good sized portion  If spicy didn't think medium level spicy either   Drinks plain black tea which loved  boyfriend lychee tea which sweet super good!  We also strawberry tea which wasn't sweet but alright  liked lychee tea best   Service The service just alright  came later night around 9 server pretty preoccupied sweeping floors   Other everything great! Would definitely come back again!! <EOR> I'm major pot lover   the hot pot kind!   So when Pot Tea Social House popped super excited check out   took over New Day Café interesting see did casual breakfast joint   pleasantly surprised changed look feel place   The menu very detailed which easy those new hot pot world   know you're getting upfront no random things your soup show up   The Husband chose share pot #9 Sour Pickled Mustard Lamb Pot Sliced Lamb Sour Pickled Mustard Daikon Tofu Carrot Fish Ball Fish Fillet Lotus Root Cuttlefish Ball $11 99 waiter recommended Minced Pork Rice other choices Steamed Rice Vermicelli    When hot pot arrived looked great!  However dove further noticed much pickled mustard soup   What's point calling Sour Pickled Mustard Lamb Pot if there's much main ingredient present?  server came shut off fire didn't really hear when suggested lowering instead  Or perhaps lowering wasn't option? result soup cold quickly   Therefore don't really want drink broth when you're done   accompanying Minced Pork Rice really small portion would cost $2 more another bowl   chose medium spice level wasn't spicy     We also ordered Taiwanese Pork Hocks Stew $5 99    Biggest mistake ever   driest toughest ham hocks ever had   term 'stew' misleading because tender all! could barely pull any edible bits off needed some major flossing when done attempting extract some meat off those things   Another appetizer tried Fried Stinky Tofu $5 99    Average really stinky memorable   should mention Sweet Potato Fries $5 99 also menu totally random opinion   looked around many people finished order it   Overall Pot Tea Social House okay food experience   guess would back again if lazy drive down Spring Mountain   Side note loyalty stamp card   Buy 10 hot pots 1 free  <EOR> This opened long ago but wanted ever since saw sign up  finally chance!  used Taiwanese food more often when lived CA    We started off fruit flavored green tea  passion fruit hubby strawberry  delicious!  Very sweet though  flavor reminded Asian candy   bubblegum sell Sanrio  pace myself since hot out!  We chicken wings popcorn chicken  looks apps would've assumed I'd enjoy popcorn chicken more but liked wings way more   2 year old most wings    Hubby rib eye hot pot seafood hot pot   really liked it  did feel needed add lots sauce more flavor but appreciated wasn't salty  boiling as expected   wish way blow fire underneath pot before burns its own    Our daughter ate all fish tofu pot loved it    I picnic style tables  easier kid fidget    I wish sold beer wine  Maybe lush but enjoy beverage dinner  sure license pricey mad it    Service great  even come around asking if you'd more soup  didn't need more but nice touch  Then service little downhill end   don't know if luck if off strip Vegas restaurant thing but always seem held hostage waiting check  hate having ask it  Bachi Burger worst Pot Tea didn't seem such bad wait  sat maybe 20 minutes waited almost hour pay bill Bachi before guess wasn't bad     All all I'd back  Especially when starts getting cold out  <EOR>
