Looks Fuku just new regular  <EOR> Not bad but good either  Food tasted alright but doesn't justify much paid  $7 99 bad burger but think fuku step quality bit  still dislike bun  those great value buns   May suggest Kings Hawaiian buns? But might bring price  Also overall size hamburger broke heart lil bit lol but it  gotta $$  don't understand meal upcharge $5 add fries drink? no expert but doesn't sense?   Everyone seem problem w service but visits everyone friendly personable  <EOR> Awesome!! Great location art inside really cool  Food fantastic course but knew food truck strip location  Service outstanding super friendly!! Great place watch game grab bite  Garlic fries fave! <EOR> New location same great burger!! Still hands down best burger town  perfectly honest   it's BEST burger ever had  usual Tamago bacon but venture off sometimes  way never bad burger  highly recommend getting Tamago Bacon  The staff always really friendly   locations always clean   the downtown food truck tucked around corner crowd across Common Wealth   Which ever location you'll great burger  <EOR> This location just opened staff awesome  Willing stay open when hubby late night craving calling letting them know 5 mins away stayed open us  Thank definitely first stop cravings especially jazz fries  amazing!!! thankful location close home  <EOR> After sampling some food food truck location near commonwealth feeling very impressed decided try more once less inebriated state  very next day   The burgers unique very juicy can't imagine anyone would ever complain dryness food  sauces spices infused burgers very different burger experience case different good  Crack sauce great everything   Their portions aren't huge but definitely enough hit spot  However Prices little high atmosphere cuisine  combo run $13 50 which sit down restaurant prices may enough turn some people off  location  quite small well prepared push some tables together if you're group   Also come funny name give them when order your food  they'll ask call when your order ready  Some try Tits McGee Boner James ManWaffles Justice Beaver   Happy Burgers! <EOR> Fuku local food truck favorite enjoyed food  perks new brick mortar location besides being convenient me! food quality consistent service improved  location also offers free wifi well fun music videos playing entertainment while wait   While Buta Burger still favorite always juicy plenty flavor! Naga dog also solid option  However flaw noticed both bread  burger buns bulk purchase don't stand tend fall apart  I'd prefer sturdier version maybe onion bun? King's Hawaiian buns would really great option especially hotdog   I'm little disappointed see pricing still bit high $8 burger fair adding $5 drink fries steep $9 admittedly generously sized Naga dog higher several local specialty hotdog spots price theirs  guess expect slightly inflated pricing food trucks but see same prices Strip location unexpected  <EOR> This first time coming high expectations based other reviews read those expectations even remotely met burger rather bland greasy most all overpriced   ordered garlic fries no garlic taste  don't think ever returning  <EOR> Love small hip vibe carried over truck! anime tv  and tacky karate tv  just  oozes cool    well   the flavors  no need there    great always! <EOR> I loved truck glad physical location near me  tried all burgers say honestly while still love Shake Shack Bochi Burger BurGR    place best bang your buck consistent food here  Vegas Legend status  Mark words  back again again  Pay extra jazz fries  You're welcome  <EOR> I've fan Fuku ever since first time stopped Foodtruck Westside Wednesday event years ago  Since then stalked truck numerous occasion various events  honestly feels little weird able sit down table enjoy Fuku meal I think should put set Home Depot buckets restaurant somewhere   I proudly say quality taste same would found Fuku truck made its brand famous    My default order is Karai Spicy Burger topped cucumbers peppers avocado cream I think Jazzy Fries  The Lady Tamago Burger fuku burger nori fried onions egg Regular fries w crack sauce side    The burgers asian flare them but obnoxiously off wall any way would detract burger turn off burger purist  Don't wrong am fan Bachi but t's unfair compare Bachi Fuku very distinct different creations  think Fuku creations delicious because subtleness asian flair which results well balanced flavors  Take instance wasabi mayo avocado cream sauces don't overpower burger but rather accentuate burger its toppings     I know sounds fancy food snob talk but truth  If don't believe then try Fuku yourself  If don' t trust then Fuku yourself but add c subtract u    Eat confidence  P <EOR> The burgers umami fries just crisp delicious! never tired eating Fukuburger  Glad opened another location Chinatown <EOR> OK first off burger great far taste   But super sick eating it   talking throwing exorcist style   try look into stuff because its borderline paranoia IM accusing restaurant anything but friend walk theres guy front he orders then order then friend then family 6   ordered easiest item   #1 w o wasabi mayo   some reason order last   friend family 6 etc   just didn't why   place itself nice     Theres anime playing tv also football game well   love tell pick funny nickname when call you   trap hiphop playing background   Pretty sure place ran young entrepreneur   woman behind counter nice   She said truck still Fremont usually during weekends   If wouldn't gotten sick would given place 5 stars but still trying recover food!  crazy because location used taco bell sick food well   Maybe just bad omen location  <EOR> Wanted food but disappointed    The decor interesting decorated anime comic inspired theme menu burgers clearly displayed wall  Noise level moderate overall inviting atmosphere   I waited 10 minutes katsu burger when cook finished katsu standing next counter saw he asked another worker examine it  second person looked overcooked chicken katsu nodded proceeded burger    He must thought wouldn't able tell excessive amount sauce he put but burger messy tough chew super greasy    For 8 bucks expecting some high quality gourmet sandwich but should better chain restaurant burgers cost half much  <EOR> Love burgers!!! Brought myself bf family town love place something different others  <EOR> I glad location opened since strip hassle never hunt down truck  also happy see business wasn't slow weekday night dinner  perfect size  music wasn't loud either   Food wise burgers most juicy greasy delectable splurge possibly those times just want ruin myself best possible way! little expensive but crazy could never stop every now then    The fresh vegetables some burgers feel responsible health balance though  found tamago burger lovely its sweetness but just much protein grease overall  karai burger favorite if spicy mushroom original lucky burger which both good  try rest once craving back good burger!  Their fries sauces fries really crazy but nice complement meal overall    When burger under cooked last visit replaced without any question apologized  replacement cooked perfectly overdone underdone hot juicy! moves give them 5 stars when its all said done    My only suggestion place would add subtitles captions programs run televisions  Though understand could just simply part aesthetic decor colorful animations playing screens  <EOR> This place really impresses just decor alone! Japanese anime theme down T!  Pretty awesome    Their menu same ol Fuku Burger come know love since back food truck days during Westside Wednesdays    I took hubby first time both spicy tamago egg burger jazz fries   Still loved tamago burger but fond jazz fries anymore  think liked better back then think it'd better skinny fries instead    Anywho whether you're old fan Fuku Burger never even heard before check spot    PS  told give cashier funny name when food ready totally caught off guard failed  Lol think something beforehand if suck things such myself  <EOR> Order Asshole   Asshole??

Shaka Meter \uuu \uuu 2 <EOR> There seems bit hate train rolling through reviews section  While I'd agree criticism somewhat warranted still see more positives negatives   Fukuburger long favorite Las Vegas food trucks third shot brick and mortar success first positioned outside Strip  They've taken over former location Fresh Cup most recently White Rabbit  Customer traffic steady if somewhat slow around dinner time surprisingly nippy Monday night   The menu mostly same truck's menu although sure often carried all those fries options  also seem offer specials every often seen Instagram but tonight's Kennedy didn't sound exciting me  employee described Katsu Burger chicken mac cheese inside  try come back when they're serving something more intriguing   I Kinoko Mushroom Burger somewhat ill advised choice hindsight  hadn't Tamago Egg Burger recently but instead different burger I'd previously experienced  said don't remember mushrooms being tough chew  Mushrooms burgers need tender period thick but easy bite through   Let's back basics though  bun solid held onslaught sauces both inside out  beef patty gigantic oversized portion met challenge $8 price brick and mortar context food trucks generally overpriced believe not   cooked medium although did seem slightly underseasoned boring itself  But you're getting burgers because you're purist anyway pickled ginger teriyaki sauce wasabi mayo enjoyable burger overall   Also $4 jazz fries served same tray burger pretty dynamite  While isn't any sort cheese pretty sure they're better seasoned overall poutine tried certain shop long ago  fries crunchy brown gravy hot rich crack sauce some mildly addictive mayo based goodness   The dining area fairly small fans former inhabitants White Rabbit Fresh Cup may know  However above beyond offering free Wi Fi all well power strips high counters charging your devices    Even though I'd eaten long before Fukuburger visit definitely enjoyed meal  Despite own doubts they've transitioned truck's menu into casual burger experience its own niche among other similarly priced casual burger joints  Just remember funny nickname ready because they've kept aspect Fukuburger truck too  <EOR> I just worst burgers ever Las Vegas!!! Don't ever Fukuburger!! Disgusting point making sick stomach!! It gave instant trots!!  I should hint when bit into burger saw inside raw pink!!! Gross greasy!! fries hard stale nasty! <EOR> I doubts joint but overall gonna say really here  walked take moment comprehend going inside  Today first time guess clearly showed  helped Elise gave good rundown all menu items gave some personal recommendations well  She helpful patient cute too  You even choose nickname your order don't care if swear  used 'Kyouchan' because  Japanese family friends call me  Nothing funny interesting  Just first thing popped into mind  So ended getting Tamago egg Burger turned very well  garlic fries tasty liked dipping sauces provided well  portions bigger those Shake Shack same price   My dining experience pretty trippy  two TVs some old school Sentai ?? Ultraman ?????? episodes going complete monsters crushing Tokyo city five characters combining into gestalt hero whole deal  music playing some 90s rap which provided interesting contrast  last but least eating noticed paper used line basket says ??????? which more less means Die fucking asshole! obviously being politically polite isn't top place's priority list which very refreshing opinion  mild chuckle everything overall pretty good experience  close work definitely back try rest items menu  <EOR> The first time Fuku truck first Friday 2 years ago LOVED it    Ever since then only gotten worse me  bf actual restaurant today again food good first time but wasn't horrible either     My bf tomago good but worth $$   I katsu literally 3 chicken patties seemed worth paying but barely any crack sauce lot cabbage amount meat!   The garlic fries good beginning but time eating last ones pretty crunchy dry    The crack sauce also rly lacking flavor today!   Lastly doesn't food but overheard saw assumed manager really upset chef yelling him   don't wrong understand if ur worker screws its ok say something but aware fact kitchen open entire restaurant doesn't look good u restaurant! <EOR> Love Katsu burger!!!!! absolute favorites! Very friendly staff fun atmosphere  Only suggestion would turn music down little because feels you're club! <EOR> Delicious! wish would come sooner egg burger garlic fries amazing  girl register friendly neat atmosphere  <EOR> The fam bam town told them try FukuBurger if feenin' burgers  always raved but always felt discouraged finding truck crowd pools around  But finally! actual restaurant within area   relatively clean decorative  Good vibes  all good vibes    However    gotta say becoming more more disappointed each time come sometimes due lack service others food tastes little more bland  time though two four burgers extremely undercooked  full MUSHY  even sorry just because hate well done patties but really? even going overlook taking home reheating it    Until back counter  cooks attention few minutes standing there  asking some boxes but brought burger show undercooked he's aware  He says oh ok walks away  Just maybe looking little customer service acknowledgement   but now uncertain customer pissed off boyfriend unimpressed brother  just praying don't sick reading another's review    Sorry Colin  still willing give shot future but probably going last times do  <EOR>
