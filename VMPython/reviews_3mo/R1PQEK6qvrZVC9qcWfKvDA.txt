I came try some Hawaiian Style Tacos which haven't awhile   come girl looks she prepping something back earlier asked wanted  She proceeds grab gloves without washing hands first  hands clearly dirty she grabbed OUTSIDE GLOVES! Hello gloves used reason!  told young lady wash hands new pair gloves which she did without question    Now she gloves waiting order she leaning against counter gloves side everything   She then taco Salad straight grabs salad hands  Maybe counters clean said myself kept picking selections  She then grabs tray which didn't seem clean bunch water spilled over she picked put back down   Grabs bowl sticks fingers it   point over would rather starve bit find another option getting sick improper food handling safety    Please train your workers Food Safety! Then maybe might come back day  <EOR> Their meat really flavored good give sample if  ask chicken steak pork  favorite pork but chicken steak good too  tried bowl pork steak burrito  pineapple verde sauce good different normal green verde sauce but different good way  coconut bark crack addicting do't you'll fiening bad way warned  Always check Yelp deal  addicted coconut bark  <EOR> Eh okay  admit bought into hype  Perhaps simply location though person brought said Rainbow Blvd  location he first visited better  <EOR>
