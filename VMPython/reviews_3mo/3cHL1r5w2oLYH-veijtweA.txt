So draft bottle selection impressive indeed  started cask conditioned Firestone Walker porter which quite tasty truly something might ever find elsewhere  Then took run down American Imperial IPA list enjoying several varieties Uinta Hop Notch yum! Stone Lagunitas  All fresh served proper glassware always nice touch    Alas time nosh  Impressive menu definitely high brow end might expect pub grub   Then again Public House *is* gastropub all truly live food offerings  opted scallops over oxtail stew  $29 little apprehensive when might just happy burger fries point  However let tell most fantastic dishes ever enjoyed  aroma huge pan seared scallops over rich red wine laced oxtail stew demanded immediate attention as well attention several others seated bar   meat potatoes guy somewhat small portion bit concerned but richness flavor packed entree reinforced old adage 'quality over quantity ' Wow very happy meal   Needless say found myself back Public House several times week found myself succumbing craving second helping scallops  Every bit good second time! Even better paired nice dark porter   Already looking forward next trip Vegas specifically Public House! Beer geeks and foodies rejoice! <EOR>
