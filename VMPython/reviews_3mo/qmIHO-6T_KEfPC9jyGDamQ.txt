OMG!   Overall favorite restaurant trip Vegas  <EOR> Jean Georges Steakhouse deserves 4 5 stars but happily round 5 because generous servings truffles On Saturday night asked last possible reservation which 10 45 pm  When Vegas everything late Maybe somewhat loud music also because later evening?   A lot different servers came table which little confusing but maybe just trying move more quickly? started yummy bottle New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc tuna tartar lobster bisque appetizers  along bread selection including pretzel bread great start great meal    We ended choosing salmon truffle vinegarette share main dish  salmon almost sashimi rare delicious especially truffle vinegarette top  dish also came chopped brussel sprouts which loved special mashed potatoes pretty sure also truffles them  mentioned love truffles feel spoiled every time eat them?! bone marrow also very good salty  ask advice eat it     We stuffed dessert actually took last glass wine down casino floor since didn't want all servers wait finish it      One final thought =  yummy truffles!!! <EOR> Jean Georges' restaurants very hit miss me    love Jojo Spice Market but lukewarm Perry Street did care Nougatine   However Vegas Steakhouse fantastic would over other Vegas Steakhouses any day   I started off standard Caesar salad    Hard screw though some places manage to! but various ways notable see Strip House review    Many places use big thin fresh cuts parmesan but Jean Georges takes different tack   parmesan grated small light literally seems fluffy melts immediately tongue   NICE   Next sweetbreads   If chef willing serve he knows stuff cooked extremely and mercifully light sesame truffle sauce   Very good nice change typical steakhouse fare   Normally filet but when see soy glazed short rib it   literally compulsion   great filet any time NYC glad short rib because amazing   think even better short rib BLT prime because soy glaze   Served side creamed spinach glass South Australian Shiraz really hits spot  <EOR> A Vegas trip never quite complete unless involves visit city's premiere steakhouses   time around found way newest kid block Jean Georges Steakhouse conveniently located inside Aria hotel where happened staying time    First must comment beautiful stylish decor  inside restaurant   design immaculate very chic     right down island sinks inside bathroom   Service point including friendly very knowledgeable waitress   As food well started grilled foie gras terrine surprise right? almost positive addicted stuff    Grilled terrine? Doesn't quite sense right? Apparently thanks waitress foie first grilled then prepared terrine form don't expect seared   still am 100% convinced truly liked preparation certainly better     but certainly bad anyone's standard   main course girlfriend decided split 28oz bone rib eye   much wanted     found meat bit uneven when came its flavor   times bit salty depending which area steak eating     perhaps unusual     but certainly first time taken notice   sides truffled mash potatoes grilled bone marrow   truffled mash excellent     best if thee best preparation dish ever had   certainly taste truffle flavor all over excellent dish   bone marrow well INSANE!!!  Never side dish consisted much bone marrow grilled perfection   actually physically felt cholesterol jump few hundred points delicately scooped marrow into mouth   accompanied rib eye perfectly along gremolata served with  warned huge portion     please don't forget prophylax yourself your cholesterol lowering drug choice mine would Lipitor   Fearing massive coronary     opted dessert   Overall would give Jean Georges 3 5 stars decor ambience service would definitely 4 4 5 stars   great side dishes felt ribe eye wasn't quite par especially compared side dishes therefore would rate 3  Harsh realize but then again land Carnevino Cut SW steakhouse Craftsteak Delmonico Smith Wollensky among others   much competition within 10mile radius     3 stars actually bad  great setting ambience service      end felt Jean Georges dare say failed deliver  <EOR> First off came business meeting Tuesday night without any resos   place packed waited hour which shows much Vegas hurting right?  place big restaurant very nice ambiance   No complaints front   table 5 everyone ordered different things   Although everything good nothing great   short ribs ok definitely even close best ever  sure   think flavoring perhaps??  Mashed potatoes good wedge salad   Service spot drinks good strong   All around 3 3 5 stars but all steak houses Vegas may want try another  <EOR> One star might generous but lowest give   While same Celebrity Chef Bellagio's Prime Steak House little comparison food between two   MAJOR disappointment   party 3 two started cocktails   Apple Martini tasted Virgin Martini   send back Vodka   Espresso Martini tasted made burnt coffee     Appetizers Lobster Bisque WORST ever tasted   Campbell's Soup would more welcome  so would Safeway brand    Sent back Foi Gras Apple Jalapeno Jelly   more Jalapeno Jalapeno Jelly   Could taste any fruit   Nothing fruity acidic cut richness fat inherent Foi Gras   Simple balsamic Vinegar would made far more enjoyable   $32 00 appetizer quite displeasing   Other appetizers table Wedge Salad which came only tiny drizzle Blue Cheese dressing   took several requests more   beet salad OK but nothing exciting   Entree's Two New York Strips evening's specials 16 oz Bon in Fillet   Strip ordered Med Well came table Med Rare   other cooked properly Med but full Gristle   Fillet only saving grace evening   Cooked Rare ordered cut butter   Truly delicious   All came House Verde Sauce side Jalapeno based which did compliment flavor meat   ordered Béarnaise side which much better     For sides ordered Black Truffle Fritters which listed being made cheese don't recall exact variety    house specialty told   Once again all could taste Jalapeno   could sworn even hint Jalapeno Asparagus   After main course enough very pricy mostly palate displeasing offerings   desert down Casino level delicious offerings Jean Philippe Patisserie     My advice stay far away here   If want good steak plenty fantastic options available Vegas Including Jean Georges good offering Prime Steakhouse Bellagio   named offering simply awful!   As said BIG disappointment  <EOR> Hostesses Yum Tuna Tartare Meh Bone marrow ok Foie gras ok Truffle ball thing forgot ordered Yum Rib Eye perfectly done  <EOR>
