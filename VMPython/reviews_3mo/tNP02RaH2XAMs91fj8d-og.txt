Interesting concept but somehow cohesive  3 food stations bar coffee bar  order bar then pick your food food station when your pager rings  ordered Craft Burger grilled onions cheese  came ordered shiny sesame toasted bun reminded Bob's Big Boy 40+ years ago! Sweet potato tots yummers  sure addictive little sprinkles but good  also Chicken Milanese Torta  Again bread really good but chicken mediocre bean purée made everything slide around  Also needed more sauce roll  going give place another try based good especially since first day  Staff nice exceptionally trained   I hope add table service here  <EOR> I'm rating place because see promise but place really some kinks work out  First off love bar  Plenty beers tap decent happy hour drinks there's plenty seating relaxed but chic type presentation  Love part   Hated part going different stations told order bar   fine because slow but if bar packed only two bartenders doing things like   tending bar  People food orders going start getting backed up  Weird concept if expect busy   I order cubano friend orders burrito jerk off wanted come try food just orders coffee wtf!   Anyway bite burrito rotisserie chicken meat actually pretty good  coupled rice actually pretty damn good  back this   The dry cubano other hand feel though little overpriced $12 came no fries maybe forgot maybe just doesn't come don't know  But $12 basically just sandwich sit down service?  crazy expensive but damn give some fries chips f*ck even take deli pickle!  All all nice change pace if you're gambling Downtown Grand you're leaving Gold Spike want something quick instead pizza  But needs work some things  <EOR> So Freakin' good!! Love atmosphere love food so fresh fantastic service  Jessica Jesus Eric Rock! <EOR> Do fooled fancy food court     The only difference between commissary regular food court  order location  odd mixture  Mexican food burgers bar food  order bar given pager  find seat wait while then station prepares type food  ordered pick up    The Good Atmosphere modern very clean  plenty seating  bar area cozy good selection beers tap  variety interesting if trying please group people varied    The Bad Co worker lunch spent several minutes wandering around trying find place order  ambiguous order sign above bar no further details  only two menus pasted bar counter register other under  bar patron's lunch   placing your order  left figure which station your food  burgers station pretty easy but  other two stations look split between hot cold entrees but no definitive signage effect   Food awful   ordered tortilla soup bacon cheeseburger  Both items presented well looked delicious  Tortilla soup very runny tasted strained corn chips velveta  also lumps something assume chicken but could wrong  Bacon cheeseburger SALTIEST thing ever eaten life! removed bacon hoping cut salty taste only realize bacon  wasn't able finish half burger due crazy amount salt  am still tasting salt    Co worker same burger nacho fries  burger just salty mine  nacho fries blah cheese salt fries    We back try latin food just sure isn't case ordering hamburger sushi restaurant  But am looking forward it         Co worker ordered <EOR> I'm kinda digging place  cubano torta Mexican Cuban sandwich pretty big  martinis good salsa caliente not gringos    Plus gelato  spicy chocolate gelato stout float yup beer ice cream   awesome  <EOR> My husband lunch week   atmosphere cute very bright food meh   Hubs ordered bacon burger no bun ordered bacon wrapped hotdog   both ordered sweet potato fries iced tea   Aside price over 30 bucks lunch food much would expect any cookie cutter casino cafes around town     Our food looked nothing pictures and don't just mean wasn't styled sweet potato fries actually tots   We'll maybe give them couple months settle try again but can't recommend then anyone   Stick Smashburger burgers  <EOR> Food first Mexican grilled cheese chips  am Mexico but name sake Commissary is  expected grilled cheese take Mexico instead taken Applebee's  FAIL The sandwich avocado tomatoes but no flavor  BUT loved caliente salsa chips  asked hottest salsa yummy  chips!

 surprised some sort mango pineapple or both pieces mixed into roasted potatoes   The cilantro rice Mexican rice both okay   cole slaw good   Don't cole slaw   fries sweet potato tots forgettable   wished instead ordered fries saved room gelato but live learn   Overall wish staff working hot counters Commissary refined beautiful design place professional courteous staff gelato coffee counter Chinese restaurant   would earned them another star   Zero sanitary concerns would earned them even another star   Could've 4 star review but leave 2 stars  <EOR> I work downtown excited place just opened  First off  the bar coffee area gelato looks great  Things would pretty hard mess up  Mexican bowl salad made Chipotle look four star meal  barbacoa WAY over spiced flavored shredded lettuce very minimal  Spanish rice saturated seasonings half way THROUGH lunch feeling ill  wasn't only coworkers burgers all tummies doing well  hope quickly correct bad reviews before place becomes consistently avoided  <EOR> Delicious!
