Hence 3 star review  What's deal!!??!! waiter nice but very forgetful  Drinks seemed take very long time  drinks opinion overpriced   isn't strip freakin Summerlin   why price gouge locals? Jack Daniels water somewhere around $20  Come on!   My grilled salmon absolutely delicious  $21 but worth it  friends enjoyed deviled egg appetizers tater tots  Again food very good but service need improve  Couldn't tell if waiter kitchen bar all above made everything seem slow  sure come back anytime soon  <EOR> I twice both times terrible service  first time happy hour group 5  server took order never saw again until flag down check  addition non existent waiter didn't receive drinks until already received check  decided give them second chance last night industry night around 9 o'clock  sat bar area high hopes because busy  saw least 3 waiters walk past table no acknowledgement towards us  waiting 20 minutes no coming take order left  decided Yard House where bartenders friendly service great! return Public School 702  <EOR> I last night couple girlfriends check out  Overall just   decent  theme ambiance  carried school theme very well decor fun  ordered food off happy hour regular menu  friend Parmesan fries which excellent wings cauliflower which she said just ok good  other girlfriend ordered poblano quinoa  pepper good but rice very bland almost no flavor all  $16 it  ordered margherita pizza which good once it  Unfortunately forgot took awhile  good thing comped which nice done without asking    My only complaint drink prices  spent $27 two glasses wine  nothing special just house Chardonnay  $11 glass outrageous house glass wine  also noticed happy hour beers very very limited  Regular cocktail prices upwards $15 $16 piece    Overall decent  probably won't back unless ends being meeting place decided others  <EOR> I've decided mission try all restaurants Downtown Summerlin next list Public School 702!  This restaurant very cute charming schoolhouse theme throughout  appeared training new employees when visited lunch both hostess servers shadowing other employees  Everyone cheerful pleasant aside newbies asking few questions more experienced didn't detract service all   We settled appetizer cheese bacon tator tots  yummy! Deep fried tator tots bacon cheese inside served sirracha ketchup wrong?   For main course CCB which version Cobb sandwich  chicken patty served lettuce avocado bacon onion own special sauce  yummy! loved bread although didn't hold well end  fries good great thin fries but again sirracha ketchup helped add little kick   My friend enjoyed burger well but didn't taste it  vast selection beers if into brews looked really fun outdoor area   Another Downtown Summerlin restaurant checked off list! wouldn't mind getting detention though! <EOR> This worst places long time   Food cooked properly very poor service   several people party two ordered hamburgers   well other med  well   Both came red inside basically rare medium rare   sent mine back server said would only take 3 minutes fix it   12 minute later mine comes back everyone else done meal  You've all happen where really disrupts vib   When finally showed side salad wilted warm sitting under heat lamp microwave   sent back let them keep ate left wife's salad which way much dressing it    other person rare burger sick later maybe should feel lucky     I spoke manager but some young guy he just smiled while talking if he thought funny   even asked why he smiling he said am just happy guy end day don't even care   new place now crowded but if don't learn cook fix incorrect order 702 seeing fewer fewer people drop by   Beware  <EOR> Having wanted try original downtown LA location longest time just never getting chance Public School 702 probably more anticipated restaurant openings year  new location Downtown Summerlin sits upper level between Crave yet open second Shake Shack  pretty large space lot seating good size bar area outdoor patio well  But even all gets busy you'll likely wait table  just 2 people 7 30 Wednesday night wait still tipped 30 minutes   After being seated handed regular notebook style menu quite few appetizers all kinds entrees burgers chicken waffles  also handed separate list current rotating tap beers   favorite parts PS702  only normal beer list all craft offerings but rotating stuff seems filled unique even some hard find limited release stuff  If you're beer drinker though they've plenty cocktails wines too   Since only 2 pretty much every appetizer menu sounded good decided few items share then split dinner  started off some smaller items Speck Eggs Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower  just $6 must try starters opinion  eggs perfectly boiled creamy yok filling little piece proscuitto nice salty crispy touch  buffalo cauliflower excellent  few different versions other places California where seems more popular PS702's excellent  thicker breading served piping hot sauce side instead tossed   The other appetizers tried little bigger side  Mezze Plate huge $8 includes 5 different things pick off dip huge stack thin crispy pita like bread  favorite things marinated feta something never anywhere else before crispy chickpeas  also really enjoyd Chorizo Mac Cheese  most expensive starter $9 but well worth it  pasta cooked perfectly super cheesy there's plenty chorizo even though thought strange first salt vinegar chips top added both flavor texture   By time pretty full but order Fried Jidori Chicken Green Chili Cornbread Waffles already way  Sadly didn't impress nearly much appetizers especially $22 price tag  personally really liked slightly spicy waffle cornbread texture but wifey wasn't fan  even though flavor chicken excellent mushy only part leg bone in  gravy good flavor well but because chicken soggy made whole dish just overly mushy  chicken crispy would huge hit me   Unlike lot other reviews service excellent  even found later during meal waiter training  He did excellent job though no complaints all area   PS702 little pricy side especially when drinks but world crazy  both getting drinks then adding 4 appetizers main entree only spent $90 tip  Besides main chicken waffles dish being bit let down well worth say PS702 new favorites Downtown Summerlin can't wait back  <EOR> I would typically NEVER give 5 star review even if really impressed restaurant server but strongly feel place deserves it  Being beer lover stoked selection craft beers tap  server Colby like cheese lol very knowledgable food drinks sold Dawn Red brew really loved while chowed down ahi wanton tacos  also delicious  would never considered putting ahi crispy wonton but magic  Despite fact beer loyalist such interesting selection craft cocktails indulge while finishing meal  Colby said crushed velvet very popular gave try  Nice refreshing take Moscow mule  fresh lavender nice touch  can't wait back work way through great tap selection definitely ask Colby's section because never such great service casual concept  <EOR> Nice atmosphere ppl kinda bland but environment made seating very unique confy  food wasn't quite filling but enjoyed it <EOR> went today during happy hr  first time here   its big restaurant cool decor too   happy hr prices pretty good everything ranged $5 7 items  tried naked wings fries margharita pizza adobo tacos   would repeat all except tacos bland boring being more expensive items hh menu   yes food good  however service horrendous  waitress took 15 min water! still didnt order yet 15 min     ordered beer n diet coke  beer coke diet   when mentioned she gave heavy breath look fault n would huge problem back n diet coke since actual glass bottles  said forget n let be  but u really enjoy annoyed look u mess up   btw 2 apps before beer wrong soda  thats long she took!   there many runners bringing food kitchen  also lucky runner dropped lemon aioli fries dish off table narrowingly missing wife's shirt n pants  she apologetic but never replaced aioli   ask when another runner came by    overall ok    beer good food good atmosphere good    service GOOD! <EOR> At bar  Very good service  But dining room bit cluster f@ k  service bar way small servers wait line drinks  bartenders rock but don't any room appropriately place drinks upon completion  happy hour menu ok  But price portions bit small  Great atmosphere  Huge room oversized deck  Fun place lot potential  <EOR> Fun decor but very loud   Buffalo cauliflower good but salmon over cooked dry served fresh vegetables  again  <EOR> Great place  friend walked sat bar promptly taken care Bryan  He informed happy hour specials made delicious cocktails all night  He's great mixologist  Great service bar   Next time try food outdoor fun  <EOR> Amazing service outstanding food  Plus there's games play giant version jenga even beer pong!

Grilled Salmon Summer Succotash wife friends Huntsman burger other Shrimp Grafton Cheddar Grits   food hot perfectly prepared   Everything looked fantastic when brought out   succotash salmon best anywhere   Tell definitely public school cafeteria food   definitely back try many other dishes menu   Beer lots craft beer choices standing list menu plus another sheet table beers they're temporarily featuring   note least sour beer menu   I'd only recently heard kind beer pleased see sour options available place features craft beer part dining experience   really need take look menu see all your standing beer choices   Definitely reservation when go   seat near window could see line forming door periodically people waited tables open   reservation right restaurant's website through Yelp worked great!    restaurant's credit hostesses seemed work through line very quickly every time built although couldn't tell if folks queuing waiting any table table reserved   We sat inside but noticed there's ample outdoor patio seating overlooking more scenic part Downtown Summerlin   option sit outside always plus!  Take note loud inside   ridiculously loud but larger size dining area tied lack decor would help muffle absorb sound fosters fairly loud environment   Even wasn't detractor   Even though definitely public school's cafeteria volume may remind those days when your friends we're carrying conversations buzzing school cafeteria   Again problem just know going in   isn't place quiet intimate date   One small misstep chalk restaurant still finding stride no salt pepper table but quickly remedied when pointed out   We'll definitely again   again   If could I'd give them 4 5 stars right now assuming Public School 702 hits its stride way think don't surprised see update review five stars another visit two  <EOR> We sat bar happy hour  Service fine no issues place deceivingly busy inside outside looked wasn't even open   Liked school type decor down lined college ruled 'paper' bar napkins  Nice touch  Thought would've cool gym themed locker rooms bathrooms complete moldy gym towels hamper   maybe would taking far?  We drink prices bad happy hour flat bread hummus baba ganoush  Both awesome  overall menu very gastropub style back some point try some food  Would also check outdoor seating deck shaded afternoon  Wise planing very wise  <EOR> Food good service all over place  Forgetting orders throughout just table  Service needs step lot  <EOR> Food excellent  calamari salmon fig prosciutto pizza  Everything perfectly cooked tasted great    Service bit slow nothing major just seemed bit long items order    Only major downside noise  music loud hard hear person next you  If lower more background place would 5 5    I'll definitely back noise level didn't offset great food friendly staff  <EOR> I great dinner other night! such cool fun atmosphere food amazing  Lots variety options everyone everything delivered well! waiter Zoe he great!

We're fans salt vinegar chips top off chorizo Mac n cheese just added extra pop   does some greens kale but hardly noticeable those non veggie lovers   Grilled Watermelon Heirloom Tomatoes Surprisingly great refreshing plate summer definitely winner book   Chicken Green Chile Cornbread Waffles Heard lot great reviews but bit disappointed one   chicken pretty tender but waffle itself pretty dry bit hard eat without extra gravy sauce top it   Short Rib dish delicious!  Tender short rib draped over mashed potatoes some grilled onions   came steaming hot but flavors spot   Nutella Ice Cream Cookie lot reviews liked most part but few bites gets much   decent size if group four would perfect split   nice thing dessert ice cream bacon bits those bacon lovers!

The atmosphere restaurant itself calm seems sort lounge  server pleasant but took while bringing check asked it  She stood another table talking almost 5 minutes irritating wait when asked before that  Once check saw meal came $30 two dishes which bad guess  only issues place having ranch but also server giving check late  Other those two issues place nice try tasty food! giving 3 stars because although good great place try don't know if come back again choice  <EOR> I came Wednesday night watching movie  perhaps second third time Downtown Summerlin  I just recently moved northwest town south side  definitely much better atmosphere here  Back matters drinks definitely seemed more appealing food menu  Most options bacon bits being don't eat pork made annoying  ended getting Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower Irish Stout Braised Short Rib share  definitely recommended both try!!  full flavor great portion size    Im really big customer service new spot definitely feel staff waitress particular wasn't very attentive discussing best try lacked knowledge menu  took 20 minutes check    Overall cool might visit again patio experience  <EOR> The food absolutely amazing  birthday planned different place but immediately switched Public School eating once  food world beer selection amazing  recommend jidori chicken jalapeno cornbread waffles  sure ask Vanessa your server  She walked through extensive beer menu even provided samples recommendations  Best service ive ina  long time  <EOR> This place really nice all food choices menu look good  staff friendly good recommendations  enjoyed crispy chicken sandwich  very filling even though didn't seem big enough two probably was  I'd again  <EOR> Tried Public School lunch today experience fantastic! sure little loud during meal hours but enjoyed atmosphere great meal  beer selections par loved Crispy Chicken Sandwich!

Excellent service Sean!  Loved calamari steak salad fish chips  friend thought fish same he'd eaten Remedys but cooked more well done a good thing   2 jungle juices later still sober just heads don't order tingling feeling just order cuz tastes good! <EOR> I SCHOOLED   and liked it!  It sister's last night town decided try something new  She said best meals trip agree!  Everything delicious! We started 3 appetizers Mac Cheese    sprinkled potato chips! know sounds weird but really great! Bacon Chedder Tater Tots     Good flavor homemade ketchup awesome  tiny bit soggy mushy  lacked wonderful tater tot crunch  and Buffalo Cauliflower Just   YES! Yummy!  We all loved entrees  Chicken waffles big hit! flavor shrimp grits fantastic   Over all really great meal! <EOR> I love gastropubs thrilled find new opened five minutes house  Service great almost everything tried fantastic! favorites buffalo cauliflower vegetarian chili soup day   only complaint orange juice brunch extremely small filled ice no refills  only $3 50 trying fret but if you're parched Vegas heat would recommend ordering something else beermosa would better choice  <EOR> I very excited try Public School 702 Downtown Summerlin!  This restaurant very fun charming overall schoolhouse theme! All staff pretty friendly helpful  There group four starving decided few things share amongst      Bacon Cheddar Tots Sriracha ketchup deep fried tator tots bacon cheese inside served sirracha ketchup Chorizo Mac Cheese Emmental cheddar kale sea salt vinegar crunch Hand tossed pizza house pepperoni Mozzarella provolone crushed tomatoes jalapeños  I really enjoyed all choices would order them again! <EOR> No bang your buck here  happy hour recess time decent  reviewed lunch dinner menu while waited food  much price difference happy hour! $1 difference  just bar food  crushed velvet  version Moscow mule blueberry blackberry flavor  Parmesan truffle frites speck eggs crispy naked wings crispy ahi tuna tacos  thing worth we're truffle fries ahi tuna tacos  food decent  tell trying bring different flavor style menu  wings tasted fried chicken side note don't ranch  worth try but honestly would back  <EOR> Really cool concept whole restaurant  decor white boards menu made feel your back elementary school  just wished service food better!  FOOD Nothing really special here  tried number appetizers the bacon cheddar tots buffalo cauliflower calamari along couple drinks but all pretty basic  appetizers drinks around $10 each  Nothing would rave come back for  drinks good did fact variety beers tap but other would come back solely food   SERVICE This main reason why am only giving them 2 star rating  waiter didn't really seem he knew he doing  He would take orders then come back ask again because he didn't write them down  When he brought water bottle he also didn't pour any initially when he saw glass empty ones ask another bottle water instead anticipating needs  other waiter delivering food passed because she unsure where food go  felt system clunky   LOGISTICS There's never really any issue parking when here  also wasn't wait good  USB regular outlets where plug your phone cool   This place isn't bad  looks nice modern but service poor  managers need retrain staff if anything  wouldn't recommend others here  Try another place better food better service! <EOR> The decor cute idea restaurant! reason why giving three stars because feel menu very limited very standard  You're paying lot regular bar food even during happy hour! <EOR> The food pretty good awesome citrus beer  But place truly special far best wait staff experienced Vegas   Grace attentive knows menu backwards forwards certainly gives wonderful recommendations! <EOR> This place cute different any other restaurant bar   However food isn't amazing  pretty normal  menu pretty small both lunch dinner   It's good place drink friends! study group section menu where share variety different beers which cool!

Chicken waffles waffle chile cornbread!  Very yummy   said syrup but couldn't tell because chicken saucy cornbread savory   good but felt needed more sweet syrup give true chicken waffles experience   We almost fish chips but decided against because kid wanted kids menu   thought could just try bite hers   When kids' meal came ridiculously large bowl fries 3 small pieces best fried cod ever had   texture coating insane inside fish still perfectly cooked I hate when dries over cooked    took daughter's pieces daughter ate other two   She hardly ate any fries   Then she wanted more fish   GREAT   $8 meal order more fish her   but time said no fries regardless pay $8 again because just waste!    Other being annoyed spending $16 daughter enough fish chips fault taking pieces everything great   Very filling indulgent meal   expensive either   Oh service great!  least experience   server tad slow but busy he bunch tables sure   But even servers weren't ours super friendly!  daughter kept playing peek a boo them since near order entry computer station every single servers gave attention talked her   Very cool impressed  <EOR> Even though husband kept referring a damn hipster restaurant both really enjoyed experience meal    We great waitress start things off! name Vanessa she wasn't total food beer snob she made great recommendations menu made sure positive experience    We started drinks husband kiiiiind beer snob he enjoyed selections  crushed velvet LOVED IT  Great drink freshly made superb balance alcohol mixer  super impressed   We chose buffalo cauliflower appetizer awesome!
