My friends looking place chill few drinks came across Ri Ra Irish Pub Mandalay Place figured give shot  None Irish pub excited find offer   The hostess asked if preferred sit close live band but she not so subtly implied may want sit booth further away because gets pretty loud  took advice sat booth room where could still hear music but still hear each other   Cha ching! First thing noticed happy hour all day everyday entire month March  pint Black Tan Half Half only $4  boys took advantage happy hour girls ordered cocktails which regular Strip bar price $13   We ordered chicken wings which pretty decent fish chips  surprised good fish chips tasted   fish cooked perfection batter light greasy all  chips well seasoned  regular size $13 95 large $18 95  just regular filling two people    To end meal asked waitress Irish coffee she asked want real Irish coffee? which agreed even though didn't know difference  Little did know real Irish coffee comes good amount whiskey! good first few sips but little strong amateur taste buds  Irish coffee costs $8   All all first Irish pub experience memorable  Service really good checked regularly kept table clear extra glasses plates  would definitely again just fish chips take advantage March happy hour special  <EOR> Rí Rá having grand opening St  Patrick's Day but soft opening four days ago   Personally waiting place open ever since saw signs  surprise opened days before expecting friend rushed over    The atmosphere definitely great  Live music going could tell everyone having good time  ample seating though seats closer stage aren't ideal trying conversation people you're with    As service bit slow first  But waitress made initial contact things smoothly there    They're having couple specials month March $4 Half Half Black Tan    They also weren't serving any food yet besides chicken wings chicken tenders  excited back try fish chips McDonnell's Curry Sauce    I'm looking forward heading St  Patrick's day probably few other days before that  =p <EOR> Went Ri Ra 3rd day open during soft opening   wasn't  live band can't say when playing   layout place whole left side long bar whole right side seating booths   Even though no band pretty noisy pub like   The food just ok   boyfriend shepherd's pie ok   tried Kilbeggan Salmon pretty delicious   Appetizers crab cakes onion rings   crab cakes themselves just alright but sauce put them awesome!  really liked onion rings tiny thin cut onions super tasty   Service slow but pretty busy only open couple days forgive it   waiter can't remember name but he Irish super nice chatty   definitely try place again  <EOR> Had great dinner here   serve huge portions real Irish food   prime rib dinner chopped salad onion rings which all very good   couple sitting next fish chips which also huge portion raved good meal too   This location actually contracted 25 employees Ireland brought them over run restaurant   received fast very friendly service Irish waitress   Wish Seattle! <EOR> The wait long  Bummer just opened only doing special St Patrick's day menu  food good  Service good busy was  waitress cute fresh Ireland For  real! hubby fish chips  He recieved HUGE piece fish  burger good  something your mom would throw together making burger hand   some already shaped formed patty   friends pie rueben  didn't share  But enjoyed it   see Flogging Molly dinner  Irish pub fit well pre concert dinner! seating chicks front did look rather glum though  think swearing under breath   Seriously cheer ladies!! bad?
