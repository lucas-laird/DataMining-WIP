I really sad see CJ's but am glad see something new put its place     find place serves coffee!   So driving past every day past few months finally try some coffee   interior lodge y using pieces wood trunks decorate some Jamison barrels scattered around   seems nice place bring laptop work weekends   I ordered ice latte minus 1 star charing dollar vanilla syrup! really smooth   don't burnt taste usually Starbucks   really glad place grab caffeine way work   There's also full bar case wanted extra kick coffee   question now call staff baristas bartenders?  Baristenders? <EOR> I love coffee   I myself waiting place open while now  work less mile away  very very convenient    As walked hesitant because everyone looked occupied doing specific task didn't really look needed done  walked register unsure wanted asked suggestions  love when employee suggest something actually fits needs  because am very picky They serve wrap salad Panini's   I never wrap because its just burrito bunch stuff don't like    I don't salads all     sad know I never tried Panini kind excited actually something would eat  ordered aged cheddar Panini no mustard  took approximately 10 minutes served pickle some pepper chips  freaking good wanted another but full time finished half    I also ordered vanilla iced latte lite ice  say well pretty good  don't know if charged extra syrup not  Hence didn't detailed receipt    Overall décor pretty modern mountain American type theme  liked trunk pieces above bar looks pretty neat    There no Wi Fi when went   There some sort discrepancy lighting  randomly kept shutting on  They gaming area lounge area eating bar  Plus outside seating  I love it  back more Panini's  <EOR> 5 stars concept atmosphere vibe layout place  3 stars food coffee   A pinch Starbucks bit Einstein's dash Dotty's sprinkle some Lodge ness mix all together neat place   I pretty impressed layout Lodge CH T outdoor covered patio very nice inside roomy living room set side free standing video poker units like Dotty's full service liquor bar course coffee counter pastry case   The menu alcohol coffee coffee alcohol paninis salads breakfast items well 2 but whatever drive thru  Dining in? order counter bring you   My husband ordered Cafe Lodge Panini hazelnut latte  bacon egg cheese sandwich white mocha total 19 change   drinks nothing spectacular probably middle road average  coffee prices comparable Starbucks 4 25 16 oz white mocha   told breakfast sandwich ordered new    okay fast food esque served plate  6 25 husband considered panini priced just right taste  Nothing bad just wasn't great   This would perfect place meet friends morning latte patio adult beverage evening before night out  actually wouldn't bad place hangout before even work  surprised wasn't TV behind bar would perfect catch game without big crowd sports bar    Note ashtrays every table bar   smoker friendly all over may bother some you I'm definitely coming back try adult coffee beverages    the chocolate martini sounded delicious  <EOR> COOL SPOT agree Sussie H review     Great concept but need some things work bit but nevertheless still prefer over Starbucks  Great coffee  smokers  smoke outside great patio unlike Starubucks !  Hope stay busy enough support 24hrs!  city really needed something which reminds northern european places minus gaming machines!  Lets support such places generic casinos much! <EOR> I've twice once drinks once coffee let tell you    place amazing!! interior design absolutely beautiful  feel cabin Big Bear California  bartender served delicious drink very kind friendly  highly recommend drinks long coffee great taste definitely woke up  BTW drive thru <EOR> The rave reviews posted respect establishment truly bewildering    Our rather lousy experience began immediately when entered place around 5pm  noticeably only couple patrons  You're allowed greeter barked sternly  Oh we're just coffee friend replied she stopped dead tracks  Under 21 only deadpanned greeter   We bewildered pulled IDs inspection  greeter should simply asked IDs rather assume all under 21  Besides know Asians look young but really? 34 last educated guess age 27  Seriously speaking appreciate compliment but way given certainly orthodox   The four then seated living room style couches sofas  did receive menus flag down hostess again reason  ordered tangerine smoothie while friends ordered alcoholic mixed beverages    Another oddity occurred when counter order pastries ordering drinks server  hostess counter took friends order two pastries asked if could placed same bag since bags  friend agreed   But then placed order saying she could place napkin if need be  She nodded head  received order bag identical ones allegedly along napkin utensils all wrapped plastic  Strange   So received drinks  friends' alcoholic beverages average nothing special while smoothie smoothie  shaved italian ice colored orange loaded large quantity sugar  aftertaste reeked not even tasted reeked sweetness sugar  If wanted Slurpee would chosen instruct server obtain beverage 7 11 next door    At point found could find server once again  Eventually friend located her    sitting customer's chair front slot machine smoking cigarette  Ok understand smoke break but front customers?   On way noticed machine produced different colored so called smoothies  similar those used frozen ice desserts  shook head  waved yelled good nights but surprisingly acknowledged all   I would open trying place again if management responds actively review  Perhaps off peak staff simply staff in training    Until then better smoothies McDonald's fraction cost   Two stars minus star service = star  <EOR> I am utterly confused place  just don't know describe it  good don't wrong  But don't know _it_ is   I used coffee shop but video poker  never coffee shop video poker   bars those also bar  wasn't using bar using coffee shop   As coffee shop good  coffee definitely passable   The only real negative WiFi  If showing serious work done may disappointed  Worst coffee shop WiFi experienced minute  hard find spots comfortable work aside spotty WiFi definitely fits bill  <EOR> This place deserves 2 star following reasons RUDE UNPROFESSIONAL MEDIOCRE drinks   Most time would've taken money else where but hey drove all way might well just drinks because place itself might worth it     The place nice outdoor area sit few tables then couch area TV fire place   However place seemed confused own identity   Even though title said coffee house tavern would've assume majority coffee house before anything   layout decor definitely did tavern but more lounge  place looked clean organized but cigarette scent lingering no longer place would want relax hangout   There's also few gambling machines   The experience   walked friends thinking grab quick cup coffee since said Coffee House just wind down day  However walked into pretty empty place few other patrons   staffer finally saw but before even able say anything girl staff straight said allowed assume authorizing tone   extremely taken aback greeted   waitress just kept telling place 21 OVER ONLY   apparently she thought all underage   Okay fine think look young thank you  However approach patron even if underage  She also added lot hand jesters body movement along she rambling about   Sorry but indication she also racial profiling if did understand English language   wait until she done rambling because can't even cut just tell all over 21   clarified legal age she didn't even asked see ID   if actually lied? Then she just allowed minors gamble order alcohol   The food drink experience   Drinks fun part   bypass initial checkpoint sat couch area but still confused if order your food sit down table service another thing didn't ask when busy saying over 21   waitress came menu but  seemed bit zealous where felt rushed decide drink   know if she felt bad she earlier she want place but definitely did help mindset place    waitress took drink orders two check pastries have  part may just bit odd ordered told only 1 paper bag left hold pastries asked if she put both one  fine since order  However friend behind order pastry separately actually paper bag when supposedly ran minute ago wait did she just lied me???  She also moved very slow seriously never seen someone taking long cookie muffin  could've chopped down tree processed paper bags within time  part peeve don't think ever place when order drinks let alone alcoholic drinks place napkin acting coaster then drink  Isn't basic 101 knowledge?  ask napkins only find waitress sitting down smoking clock   even allowed?  If allowed state NV then apologize least solved smokey scent issue here   Sometimes forget places aside casinos also allowed smoking inside   Anyway only speak 2 drinks since didn't try others   Chai Martini Soymilk drink menu recommendation  Apparently chai martini now requires no mixing  Top layer chai tea alcohol bottom layer soy milk   distinctively see separation   would nice mix myself but oh wait nothing stir with   chai taste bad but definitely say best chai martini ever had   good if alcohol but want drink martini glass   Tangerine smoothie should apologize all smoothies   felt really refreshing when first drinking but aftertaste sugary burn similar ones when drink slurpy icee    Redeemable point +1 star muffin cookie ordered bad friend thought drink okay     Overall never set foot place again since don't seem care returning customers    hoped could've nice change other coffee houses potential lunch spot future  Oh well another place  <EOR> The food selection limited but overall drinks coffee selection pretty stocked place potential fun hip But because its location fact very well marketed think won't doing great right off bat    happy hour looks good <EOR> I hope become regular! came breakfast 10 a m  Sunday empty!
