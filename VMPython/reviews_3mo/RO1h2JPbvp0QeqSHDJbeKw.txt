Anyway said already paid 2 asking see receipt she gave more now making total 2 in case aren't following should getting 3 total then said yeah need more again confused she said would $0 75 pointed receipt paid 2 she said 2 asked doesn't meal come 1? then she it! Overall ity wasn't bad just wasn't great probably wouldn't ever eat again just because isn't worth time money it everything Vegas pretty pricey   <EOR> Fantastic service Ismael amazing food    Hoping Anchor follow myriad NYers transplanted Southern California    We'd love LA!! <EOR> I original Anchor Bar Buffalo NY excited check out    Anyway while atmosphere can't compare originally location quality can! wings tasted almost identical did fries!
