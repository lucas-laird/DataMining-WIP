I comparing food Monta lot because   beat   Definitely same level Monta ramen slightly more expensive @ $8 bowl   way serve ramen interesting spoon lays perfectly side bowl but soup filled only height noodles  Personally prefer noodles drowned soup  miso ramen somewhat bland but increase price come few extra amenities half egg corn  Tonkotsu ramen soup less salty Monta but didn't deliver  pork served also thinner Monta's  no problem noodles since cooked al dente  Lastly gyoza okay taste did compensate its smaller size @ $5 plate   At time don't take any credit cards other Master weird unless you're paying debit    I probably come back future try chicken wings but no rush come back  <EOR> I tipped off friend heard Ichiza's chef new ramen spot worth try   Cute anime themed waitresses ramen even Thai dish too   try it!  Feeling spicy mood ordered tom yum ramen noodles   also ordered California rolls   heard owner someone associated owner used own Thai restaurants town   quite surprised tasty tom yum was!  expected more Japanese slant classic Thai dish but surprisingly pretty much Thai style   Lemongrass galanga root basil   broth nice savory flavor slight tang it   ramen noodles good tom yum which guess actually did give Japanese twist   friend thought noodles slightly overcooked but didn't detect anything mine   ordered level 8 spice level waitress thought crazy white guy   Well level more 5   Still good stuff though!  The California rolls generous size   tasty perhaps best tasting CA rolls ever but great appetizer     My friend did Tonkotsu but he felt noodles Chashu better 'that other ramen place'   would maybe say ramen just different style perhaps healthier 'that other ramen place'     I fun would again   service very friendly although perhaps bit inexperienced   waitress tough time splitting check between 8 people   Still she constantly checked even struck some casual conversation   She definitely serious job cute too    hard find combination town! <EOR> Just amazing! teriyaki chicken really good overall look place cool D much pick but hopefully more stuff added onto menu  overall IT! <EOR> ***4 5 stars***   I try place reading fellow yelper Tony T's review   When stepped into restaurant instantly felt Tokyo  cute little waitresses maid outfits reminded maid cafes Tokyo   only difference speak very good English don''t call customers Master     Since soft opening all menu items 25% off   sweet deal considering expensive Japanese food could be   But actually menu items reasonably priced   gyoza karaage fried chicken tonkotsu ramen miso ramen grilled salmon platter   All under $30 00 25% off    gyoza quite tasty but must say smallest gyoza ever had   karaage chicken wings came ketchup Japanese mayonnaise dip   good but probably would order again because deep fried   miso ramen   presentation ramen bowl very pretty just ones Japan   miso broth though could more concentrated but bad   wife tonkotsu ramen she really enjoyed it   broth excellent egg sliced roasted pork other condiments complemented each other very well   roasted pork slices ramen could sliced little more thicker   friend grilled salmon platter   came two pieces sushi steamed rice broccoli macaroni salad   She substituted macaroni salad seaweed salad   She also enjoyed dish   only thing didn't fact two waitress kept coming around wanting clear away dishes when haven't even finished eating   service little annoying side them coming every 5 minutes check us    But won't keep coming back food quite good authentic gets   needs Japan good ramen just step into Anime Ramen enjoy! <EOR> Exactly rating describes    Meh experienced better   Ramen mediocre bad bad but only 1 4 greatness Monta      However main reason give place 2 stars due horrendous chicken wings   Worst wings all year possibly life   pounded flour deep fried perfect destruction absolutley no flavor all ketchup mayonaise friend does cut it   On cool things place theme decor defintely well planned   Waitresses cute n cool but no cosplay only colored wigs which dissapointment   I'd give 2 5 stars since offered 25% off but once  gone only reason I'd come back kicks no expectations great food   harsh? sorry   <EOR> Food 7 10 Udon ramen taste prepacked but sure hits spot lunch hangout price reasonable too  Comfort food comfortable Drinks 6 10 Ramune soda gatorade    Alcohol coming soon should specialty themed drinks clean glasses Environment 9 10 Anime themed paintings adorn wall various popular anime series play 42 flatscreen anime music playing speakers    Im anime heaven!

Now when walk brightfully colored wigged staff greets most Japanese places town  seat yourself come take your order  environment relaxed cozy  decor features anime art plus anime playing tvs except tv plays American football  staff nice but seem bit inexperienced  did forget couple things but only issue when kept asking doing every 5 mins  just becomes annoying while  guys did mention enjoyed scenery place would come back just hang there  Men!  Anwyays yes menu small but more could want? ramen fried rice some appetizers bento boxes  they're portions actually decent size price you're paying   At $8 bowl ordered miso ramen tom yum ramen kimchi fried rice $6 usual teri beef ?   First off isn't Monta Ichiza but give guys kudos trying bring concept Vegas  fried rice better expected actually enjoyed better Shuseki's version  Ichiza's still favorite  only thing rice did contain pork if you're pork fan might want note before order it   The Miso ramen wasn't bad  guy ordered enjoyed very much said very flavorful  tasted broth broth nicely flavored  bland but also salty   I ordered tom yum ramen honestly couldn't stop eating it! love tom yum version very comparable some Thai places around town  Add some ramen chicken mushrooms winner winner chicken dinner  ordered spicier but alas still needed kick notch  Just thinking crave bowl  Normally can't down big bowls ramen which bit surprisingly since usually big appetite but did find myself scrapping bottom bowl  surprised never happens! full but determinded waste  top off Thai Ice Tea boba down great it    So being said yes Monta Ichiza but least give try judge yourself  concept especially since Vegas! Despite some might say think Las Vegas pretty decent Chinatown compared some other cities  need support places before away economy  <EOR> I discovered place terribly long ago Paolo D  said 28GO minimalistic but cool Anime Ramen Teriaki takes idea runs   Don't wrong anime   grew staples Akira Fist North Star Vampire Hunter D good ol' fashioned Studio Ghibli film five   place really took nerdtastic time life   The set great Bright cheery upbeat J Pop playing anime dressed girls greet Japanese   art everywhere but very nice classy I wish some old school classics but fun    TV some Pokemon episode playing   When walked only ones there   halfway through meal place became packed   Talk good timing   The food however just right outing   gyoza pretty darn tasty HUGE bowls ramen   Everything hot flavorful   Even boba teas excellent sweet   Service very nice   girls checked often but enough become overbearing   always top things super friendly   appreciate effort put into costumes   crazy some theme restaurants but still point name game anime   Even little business cards styled those trading card games which found charming   appreciation details and tasty food made experience memorable   So memorable fact ensures going place again soon   neat clever idea glad someone obviously fun business run  <EOR> The ramen ma ma desu best  pretty salty enough stuff it  sure if offer larger size bowl noodles but should  place definitely decked anime decor servers all cosplay  Mecha Kawaii  setup server definitely place Anime   even play anime TVs  If thing should order Honey Toast ice cream dessert  <EOR> Came because saw anime ramen  Husband loves naruto but disappointment  Service but slow lacking  still menus hands bringing food  Then ordered food brought wrong ramen   ramen no good   Tom yum ramen didn't taste tom yum   Miso ramen didnt taste good either   wanted come back but can't do  <EOR> Been month ago decided try few things  Ramen ok best  Gyoza forgettable  teriyaki steak some worst long time   Overall cool concept but really need revamp food survive  <EOR> Finally chance try place cold rainy night  perfect time some hot ramen belly! place located Chinatown below Ichiza  neon sign anime characters outside hard miss   Right when walked greeted bright neon colors anime characters all over restaurant  Anime cartoons blasted flat screen TVs  cute waitresses costumes looked stepped anime  attention detail execution concept impressive!  I little ticked off first because waitresses took while take order  place wasn't busy seemed didn't priorities straight when sitting 15 minutes waitress sweeping    My husband ordered Karaage Chicken Wings start  He ordered Shoyu Ramen Tonkotsu Ramen  Luckily food didn't take long  weird brought ramen before wings but no biggie  husband tasted each other's soup although liked Tonkotsu Ramen better wasn't great  other Yelpers said just doesn't compare Monta The chicken wings actually boneless also mediocre    We Honey Toast dessert favorite part meal  always hear good Ichiza's Honey Toast but always full try it  don't know which better but really enjoyed dessert here   The waitresses good checking food brought initial annoyance away  also give them extra brownie points being darn cute!  All all Anime Ramen cute concept great place hang group friends however when craving ramen don't think go to place  <EOR> I'm huge fan Hue Thai family  Check Dukedom Mr  Sandwich! But quite disappointed latest venture  sum think food Vietnamese people making Ramen  may sound biased but imagine feel traveling all way Santorini Greece ordering Moo Goo Gai Pan   The issue place identity muddled  serving Japanese food Chinese food Thai food? mean each region tastes O K  but  exactly 3 stars review A OK  Nothing spectacular  No punch flavor nothing stand out    When crave Ramen Monta when crave Tom Yum Thai Style When crave Japanese treats Ichiza  <EOR> Their food okay maybe its cause expected much friends said  SHOYU RAMEN bomb but when tom yum soup EEK! best    good either  best desert honey toast but still Ichiza's honey toast better  <EOR> Rurouni Kenshin   Dragon Ball Z   Noodles   many things Japan liked throughout life   Some animated some edible   Both those worlds combine into cuter restaurants to   Anime Ramen happily provides would expect name   The walls decorated art different anime TV shows anime waitresses wear colorful wigs would look place anime   didn't see any giant robots guys spike hair huge swords but guess would taken away cute factor   Soups offered interesting first choose your broth followed type noodles   Broths include your shoyu tonkotsu miso ramens but also include other varieties such tom yum   Noodles ramen udon   Based ramen being part restaurant name tried shoyu ramen tonkotsu ramen   The ramen good though meal bit rollercoaster ride me   no add ons available your ramen aw but all bowls include boiled egg seaweed yay!    Instead getting only two slices chashu pork you're treated three yay! but think could used bit more boiling flavor aw    broths flavorful salty its easy find yourself slurping every last drop   tables don't garlic ginger add your soup but ask some ginger kitchen   I think your experience depend most abouta bowl ramen   all averaged decent bowl enjoy every now then future  <EOR> The prices decent first off!!!  ramen awesome!  friend both ordered appetizers first   ordered California rolls Gyoza munch  prior each $5 6 each which decent delicious!!  My friend Shoyu ramen   really good portion BIG!!! Kotsu something can't pronounce _ ramen really good   enjoyed ramen noodles seemed freshly made there   The Boba   were delicious enviable Tea Station  <EOR> Ichiza full honey toast mood! dinner but craving comforting sweet!   So honey toast more honey french toast instead toasted box served upstairs  BF thinks he likes better  think they're both good but different  hit spot  BF also taro boba shake which solid but boba slightly softer would like    Can't really comment namesake havent gotten yet    Now when said wanted boba shake water some honey toast server made face kinda pissy guess because weren't eat didn't order honey toast each  She even told should order two! would think  better no money  Pfft  Another server much more nicer came back check may some good servers mix    I'll probably back but won't sit bitches section  <EOR> Cute little ramen place friendly service cool atmosphere  looked place hang friends casual meal  Unfortunately food wasn't really impressive  ordered Tonkatsu Ramen tasted fine but just tad under seasoned  also ordered   Chicken Karaage  nicely fried but bland side  place potential but enough moment  <EOR> I shoyu ramen honey toast   thought kim chee fried rice decent   I thought atmosphere cool    it different idea! <EOR> Not shabby!  Great place bring kids to  read reports several Yelpers figured try it    1   Location Just west Chinatown Plaza mall next strip mall  Easy parking   2   Ambiance WOW Factor   Outside decorated Anime   Inside hard determine look first  petite waitresses anime costume really cool decor wall TV's showing DragonBall Z   Everything just right really good taste   3   Service mentioned ladies dressed anime wear   very cool very attentive timely  fairly busy restaurant 75% full excellent service  Food comes quickly   4   Food quite variety wife two kids    Shoyu Ramen Noodles right texture taste  Very enjoyable  Lots pork egg other bits combined right quantity much fat all pork   egg must cooked shoyu bit dark colored  Nice presentation   broth bit simple many flavors all however kids preferred method   asked smaller bowls share spiced mine bit   Chicken Wings Really wings but seemed more chicken kara age  waitress told boneless however perhaps should just marketed fried chicken instead  Overall nice taste light crispy two sauces   Sliders Small little burgers seemed lightly marinated teriyaki   patty size flattened golf ball tomato lettuce looks toasted King's Hawaiian Sweet Roll  3 inches round 4 inches tall nicely kept together bamboo type skewer   Excellent taste very light very cool presentation   four sliders which perfect family four  know if always comes four per plate may want check   Chicken Teriyaki also shared plate Chicken Teriyaki rice  Comes heaping scoop macaroni salad nice portion lean chicken lightly covered teriyaki sauce two sushi rolls rice   did notice type sushi roll kids quick abscond them scarf them down  perhaps california roll sesame seed outside?  California Roll Comes 6 order very nice  strong vinegar taste rice  pretty good  am huge Western Sushi eater meaning eat when but generally order typical Nigiri Chirashi Inari Sushi   Everyone liked devoured quickly!  Honey Toast Ice Cream really ready order any dessert however waitress mentioned real popular dish  french toast ice Cream drizzled Honey  odd thing tio think yet presentation awesome taste subtle flavorful  Overall way coming guilty pleasure   While best any thing very good presentation  believe Monta more traditional flavorful Ramen however when combine pretty good food great service wonderful decor all combines really fun experience   When strong overwhelming amount single men coming vs  family couples  Perhaps anime waitresses key?  Hmmmm          GK says it!!!!! <EOR> 3 stars novelty dressup staff decor   memorable   however food so   japanese   tried various ramen tonkotsu miso great broth   didn't karaage   sliders kinda amateur homemade but tasty enough   pork rice fine   oozes cuteness but  it <EOR> We hit Anime Ramen Teriyaki during soft opening = 25% off   I'm all some healthy competition ramen world   Las Vegas only handful could also use few more!  The Husband enjoyed Tonkatsu Ramen while devoured Pork Belly Rice dish  Um hello   I'm all over pork belly! We stuff freezer ready go! Seriously expert ramen can't say much it   But Baby's first ramen he eating all up   Then again first meal 'regular' food no wonder he eating all up!  every time drive think Pork Belly!  perhaps high ratings really Pork Belly actually known for   their ramen   Service girls sweet brightly colored wigs but maybe brightest moment   asked high chair she said didn't but offered booster chair   Towards end meal see two high chairs corner   Hmmm   I guess she didn't know she didn't ask anyone either   When Baby knocked off completely full glass water all over table floor staff didn't bat eye immediately started cleaning up  Thanks making feel bad! Discovered partnership Hui Thai Mr  Sandwich Satay former Vietnamese shop occupied space   They also sell honey toast case crowded upstairs Ichiza all want some honey toast! <EOR> The little details place smile  Boba Tea card yummy stats adorable waitresses Ponyo playing tv anime inspired art walls don't manga style menu! obvious put lot work getting atmosphere just right   The menu isn't huge main emphasis obvious ramen teriyaki   My boyfriend both ramen side kimchi fried rice  ramen came egg chashu sp? pork  boyfriend thought broth little weak  Mine fine  boba tea however delicious!  Update back several times since say thing  If when first opened didn't broth back try again  They're constantly improving broth  Every time better last time   You guys think place may actually good Monta now    <EOR> The waitresses cute! Pink wigs  Blue wigs  Animal ears  waitresses cosplay adorable! And restaurant pretty  I ordered soft shell crab worst preparation dish ever had  some kind thick batter maybe panko but somehow tasted bad entirely inedible  The kim chee fried rice mediocre tonkatsu ramen  I'm actually sad food here  <EOR>
