Super friendly even offered free oven fresh zeppolis minute sat down  Fried dough covered confectioners sugar early day?  Why not?  Warm fresh!  Sabatino's ton great lunch specials including build your own stromboli calzones but pizza  ordered slice cheese pizza side salad which ran 5 00 think   slices huge crust perfect bending half imagining you're eating counter shot gun pizzeria Bowery  liked crust more then Dom DeMarco's thin but perfect amount toothiness   No cracker like crust here!  The salad pretty much expected standard American iceberg salad fare chopped carrots red onion basic Italian dressing  fancy elevated but wasn't particularly expecting that     I can't say enough staff really  gentleman whom assume manager owner super attentive immediately made feel home  kind neighborhood place could easily become regular stop  <EOR> I happy see place open Aurelio's closed! staff warm welcoming treated family  brought garlic knots try amazing! Pizza very good  Also delivered second time wait time 45 minutes normal pizza Friday night arrived hot fresh  brought 6 other people continue recommend  <EOR> Im sure Im going rate place yet  pizza thin crust NY style pizza sauce kind weak no unique outstanding flavor good bad price wasnt bad but price whole lot food   We ordered monster other restaurants normally fill pie much cant see nothing else  toppings barely filled 2nd largest pie make   The grease pizza wasnt overly excessive but did ask extra napkins soak two slices consumed  telling using low quality toppings   The garlic knots very tasty tomato sauce served them bland well but could taste tomato congratulations guess?  The wait staff very patient being first time menu being cluttered mess Italian food Im sure used million questions before party ready order  spent few minutes trying determine if pizzeria Italian pasta restaurant?   The wait staff kept drinks full checked throughout meal without being obnoxious it  I did explain Canadian Bacon though just seemed something should automatically know The Angel Hair Pasta wasn't real Angel Hair full size pasta isn't Angel hair sauce similar pizza weak GF asked Tabasco add flavor it   The decor cool sports memorabilia able glance football game seat seemed cool place grab slice they sell slice watch few mins game  TVs arent best angles all seats sure early ensure able good view game   Its bad place eat but cant give top marks three stars slightly many  <EOR>
