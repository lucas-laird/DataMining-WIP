1st day open !! Fast great food!! Huge portions good w pricing  Free condiments  Drive thu also open 24hours <EOR> A perfect copy Robertos  Good food but Robertos already area minute walk each other  only thing different place drive thru which plus  <EOR> I try love Roberto's but drive thru would more convenient  night craving shrimp cocktail Roberto's but already home wanting leave comfy pjs decided come here  ordering asked park front restaurant well two cars came behind me  food brought 20 minutes pulling front incorrect  proceeded wait another 15 minutes! When home I live 2 minutes away everything cold  company very unhappily ate cold dinner  Next time throw some jeans Roberto's  <EOR> Food great   Roberto's better   Definitely worth money better rolled tacos lot less  <EOR> Like other Yelpers reviewed before pretty much replica Robertos  Same options same flavor same prices only difference drive thru  Small salsa bar inside too  ordered #4 two cheese enchiladas flavor severely lacking!!! But carne asada burrito delicious also torta which ok to  Open 24 7 <EOR> Don Tortaco authentic fast! giving five stars because open twenty four hours  location reminds several Sunset Blvd locations Beverly Hills Cali  <EOR> WTF?  Today ordered phone pick because easiest us    Robertos     Maybe there's language barrier between lady taking order but really think should learn menu English before taking orders phone   maybe lost translation between lady took order person put order together   don't know!!  I ordered Carne Asada fries NO BEANS!!   plain Nachos cheese   First all Carne asada fries clearly beans   Omfg nachos joke   post pic refer that   tortilla chips looked just melted shredded cheddar cheese top   cheese really hard   Really???  Mexican restaurant no real nacho cheese?  melt shredded cheddar cheese which hardened time home     back Robertos go   waste space southern highlands  <EOR> My boyfriend roommate last night around 1 2 am because boyfriend's roommate saw place way home wanted try out  Right when boyfriend roommate immediately started joking around name catchy was  inside only saw guy working  think he only handling everything such cashier drive thru cooking food etc  took while back order but really think i's because he only handling everything someone drive thru when there  Anyhow he back boyfriend ordered chicken chimichanga 10 minutes later came out  should've taken picture but delicious  different tortilla deep fried something believe  crunchy chicken soft moist  Really good food! The environment very friendly  walls painted bright green bright orange bright yellow which made much more welcoming  plus cold temperature perfect  It always cold Roberto's people working always giving looks didn't want didn't want there     though he seemed only worker he working late he still friendly us  We really place sure definitely back  <EOR> I recommend place   ordered menudo very disappointed   no flavor  added 3 slices lemon 1 cup salsa 2 small packs salt  then tasted bit better    friend ordered camarones la diabla   He described sauce tasting tomatoes sauce chile  looked watery me   Horchata good  come restaurant again  <EOR> Came just try but then food just blew away! service way better then Roberto's workers actually serve smile! drive through really convenient  Awesome experience overall would defiantly come back again! <EOR> This place gets 2 stars cause food decent   biggest problem place never order right  always check order before leave but burritos always screw up  Can't really tell what's until take bite unroll burrito before leave restaurant   Maybe going back Robertos <EOR> Delicious Hot Mexican Goodness! being small shop BIG Don Tortaco  gonna lie barely walk right now  burritos epic stuffed full meat veggies sauces provided inside haven't gone through drive through yet exquisite  gal took order spoke perfect English very friendly  Now gripe chicken burrito  tastes great but some reason take two big pieces chicken breast just stuff them which very difficult eat! If order strongly recommend asking them slice chicken bit first  They ala carte items range $4 $6 combo plates very filling which most $8 tax  Very modestly priced because dishes despite being fast food type joint easily $16 restaurant quality  Up point seen appear some very unfair reviews must say strongly disagree them  If good person positive attitude just happens live Southern Highlands maybe accident? fate? Mexican food place worth fair shot  But if those people just Taco Bell    Its right next door  <EOR>
