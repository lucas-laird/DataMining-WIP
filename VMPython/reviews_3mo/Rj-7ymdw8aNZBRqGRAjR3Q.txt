Spanish culture Mexican culture two different things  digressing actual experience let's that    So walk into packed restaurant Saturday night  Luckily no wait time two sat right away  took couple minutes greeted attractive waitress wearing black guayabera unbuttoned enough could see lacy black bra hey if then giiiiiirl   Service friendly but timing off   took longer should bring Prickly Pear Margarita Organic Margarita table  ordered chicken tacos since Matt already ate time frame 15 20 minutes table front ours sat ordered food received food 5 minutes into enjoying food before even plate tacos  ask where comida when food runner brought out  know busy work restaurants but shouldn't taken 20 minutes bring plate tacos table  chicken tender rice beans good  plate served DIY style everything laid some corn tortillas tin cup  No complaints but should around $11 $15  done saw runner carrying flan thought YUM decided split it  talked into ordering tres leches cheesecake instead which okay  COVERED cinnamon  could sifted onto dessert without using quarter jar cinnamon  Honestly tasted bread pudding  looked sort bread pudding  circular mushy cake emulsified syrup covered cinnamon  $9 discount because Matt grand total came $38  $47  price points such 14 oz Pickly Pear margarita $12 14 oz organic margarita $13 chicken tacos $15 tres leches $5    In conclusion service friendly ambiance nice albeit completely authentic but prices timing need work  If price points brought down 1 2 dollars would more accessible locals more par place which Americanized Mexican fusion restaurant strip  <EOR> I want first say Mexican restaurant Las Vegas Strip prices now once you've rationalized sit down enjoy nice dinner   must say did upscale Mexican cantina decor plenty see great music   dinner friend both agreed would nice date spot even pre dinner place before partying strip     I loved chips which freshly baked corn tortillas excellent sampling salsas   ordered Ceviche appetizer which completely unnecessary since probably fill all addictive chips   ask them placed arms reach avoid devouring many  entree tequila salmon  which came jasmine rich both sticky sweet   salmon filling tasty but overly flavorful suspected since came hot plate    The service attention provided staff certainly top notch ended being fun enjoyable dinner   If you're looking something different pricey strip great place  <EOR> As local should mindful other reviews   but people watching mood knew great location   True prices bit more locals would normally pay food portion   Food quality great especially assemble yourself fish tacos sangria's made evening even more enjoyable    but ding give service   Nothing more ruin great experience if service horrible   memorable evening began moment sat down   the water server immediately came poured water but nearly 10 minutes before server appeared took order   Having wait long thought wise order appetizers dinner    with words waiter please bring main course until  finished chips guacamole  Sure enough appetizers came guac but no chips until said something moment put chip mouths    here comes server main course   I told server take back just appetizers   then finally flagged down waiter let know happened which he replied don't handle your table any more   they moved me    he walks away   Incredible   Great Customer Service huh?!?  Moments later young female waitress stopped asked if problem why sent meal back   told experienced requested fresh food not previous dishes probably back under heat lamp served finished appetizers   Granted floor manager stopped apologize comped guacamole just felt rushed   Also prepared talk loud steady thump thump thump music system drown any normal conversation   Overall food drinks pricey but ok   just wish hospitality factor little better  <EOR> A couple ways describe latest Mexican restaurant strip  Overpriced Just OK food Crappy Service local friendly    To start LOVE good Rita but $12+ just ain't happening  better best Rita world refill girl sat bar hoping faster service table nope   bartender clearly just wanted talk other tender home  prices charge your service better top notch   FYI may focusing tourist foot traffic crowd but if your locals don't you  good luck trying tough economy  <EOR> Service slow restaurant busy  Never pay chips salsa before but try it  Chips warm but all three salsas NO TASTE      Sent sangria back because funny aftertaste spoiled fruit  Frozen margarita better  Tried all three fajitas none any taste  Shrimp bland chicken dry beef skirt steak advertised chewy tasteless though medium rare requested  Tortillas nasty smell ones come plastic bag have   am local   Just found coupons restaurant com   Wouldn't helped taste food but would made easier swallow since four us  <EOR> The happy hour awesome  4 ritas endless chips salsa yummy pepper thing 17 bucks  Check out  <EOR> Made special trip opposite side strip   friend said he great meal when he tried weeks ago   Walked made way bar where 3 bartenders working   ordered cucumber mint margarita which very good seemed salted rim hint cumin   usually hate cumin but accentuated flavor cocktail   looked food menu while waited little lady arrive   She ordered red sangria which tasted really watered down   found queso fundido two different ceviches peaked interest   bartender left break leaving other two tenders service 8 people surrounding them   two bartenders couldn't find time take order ask if needed new cocktails empty glasses   would more compassionate if dining room packed bar zoo     Over 10 minutes passed while treaded water empty glasses hungry bellies   Cant judge food if dont chance order but service horrible! didn't feel beg ordering food drinks left $ bar cocktails had   knows if enough cover tab because didn't even check   texted same friend way home telling poor experience surprise he since same experience noted above   Sorry say El Segundo sol won't getting Segundo chance!! <EOR> Ok 4 stars EXTREME PREJUDICE     Look huge fan Cafe Ba Ba Reeba or El Primero those listened 4th grade Spanish teachers    part time local would STRIP sit Ba Ba Reeba's patio not something locals tend  just liked much! I adore new digs  love trees love lights bit loud but overall wonderful improvement   However think location could equally successful all kept cool tapas paella sangria once served   best move Lettuce Entertain    That said margaritas just might best strip   ordered veggie tacos husband jumbo shrimp fajitas   Both VERY good since neither dripping oil felt healthy full all same time   Sadly unless location desperate Mexican food and trust TONS Mexican food margarita choices strip won't back   just wasn't unique enough local drive strip there    I'd rather burger Strip Burger right next door   Which guess means Lettuce Entertain wins anyway   Must point    <EOR> Very cool little space Las Vegas Blvd  side Fashion Show Mall   Indoor Outdoor space trees patio lights cute scene   The fresh made order guacamole some best ever chips warm crispy salty  mmm   also chicken tacos which good but amazing   chicken bit charred didn't care burnt edges  but overall good taste nonetheless   I four day bender did partake margaritas but sure looked good     El Segundo would welcome respite shopping gambling although far end strip  <EOR>
