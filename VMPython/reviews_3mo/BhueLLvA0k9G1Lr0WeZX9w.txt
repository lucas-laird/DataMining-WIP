This new location big! love try 2 combo where chose 2 3 salad soup sandwich  ordered Strawberry Harvest w chicken Pesto Chicken sandwich  Those two become dynamic duo fave!!! staff very friendly dinning area always kept clean    The employee's really nice efficient  Although lot them line every employee experience never failed smile feel welcomed  lot issues repeating orders down line but am more patient understanding when repeat order couple times no biggie    Their food very fresh could tell quality most ingredients isn't pre packaged  salad soup portions could work being bigger but quality food amazing  also chocolate dipped strawberries comes your purchase  Creme Brûlée cheesecake rocky road brownie very delicious! <EOR> Very Disappointed!! know new but think more training should given before opening  Very unorganized when comes ordering  Customer service Horrible! ordered Pacific Cobb Salad when employee scooped chicken into small scooper uneven manager said take some chicken sure even scoop folks small scoop  lol   scared give extra crumble blue cheese   Wow! Forget kids chicken strip meal  Looks frozen piece breaded chicken throw into toaster oven  interior building nice enough but 1 time enough  Good Luck hope turn around  Oh way don't expect use silverware plastic only! <EOR> So noticed some fellow Yelpers checking since just down street just try it   love deli food thought another good deli near much pass on   each soup sandwich combo couple salads  Turkey Bacon Avocado Wild Mushroom Soup   wife BBQ Pork Lobster Bisque daughter Crab Sandwich Cauliflower soup     Wild mushroom very good   Creamy those amazing tasty mushrooms   exactly expected   Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich also very good   bread still crisp turkey bacon pretty tasty   decent amount avocado which prefect added overall taste but didn't turn sandwich into mushy mess   did try Lobster Bisque Cauliflower soups both very good   Lobster Bisque chunky more lobster expected   would definitely order again   Cauliflower soup creamy surprisingly delicious   did think going but hey just never know sometimes   did  taste crab sandwich pretty good would gladly order again   didn't try BBQ Pork sandwich but according wife nothing write home about   She said OK    We Mango Asian Chicken salads although good don't think good value stick Soup Sandwiches next time        Since just recently opened am sure if inside done but very casual feel it   would call modern industrial but hey am no designer sure going far looks   staff super friendly but plentiful   would assume due recently opening doing OJT new employees   ill back but wait month see place matures   good addition Rainbow SW Vegas  <EOR> This first visit Cafe Zupas say decent is   I wasn't love panini neither mom probably steer clear those future just stick regular sandwiches soups salads   My mushroom bisque delightful  Creamy rich right amount mushrooms  would come back just soup when mood again   The only thing didn't care restaurant layout  All chairs ere huddled closely together made pretty difficult people navigate around restaurant since no clear path ordering line trash drink station  Everyone kept bumping into another became quite irksome  Since just recently opened sure small tweaks made improve learn    The staff all very new well slightly more difficult order should've given fact repeat order three separate times moved down line  Might little easier if could just say once someone could write down  hard ordering item but when trying remember everyone party wanted every time repeat entire order became harder recall each subsequent interaction    Otherwise decent quick eat spot bites go  <EOR> I'm sure why location gotten such bad ratings far  Yes newly opened staff new but when service very fast everyone knew doing food good!  It very busy when line moves fast  main thing bothered place cramped  Most people walk front door but tables really jam packed hard back line  also side door would more logical entrance but think most don't know there   Also ordering most people turn right walk away which puts behind drink station  then walk back around which many cases walking across people walking which again trying walk past people getting drinks  think should put big sign front door use side door entrance use front door exit  If place continues busy think would control flow traffic much better  could turn drink station around which think would great idea but probably question   As far food prices very good if don't overboard add ons which $0 69 each  But sandwiches less $6 each small but size equal its price IMO  tried Cubano Turkey spinach artichoke TSA Turkey bacon avocado TBA Chicken salad  best Cubano  most amount meat pork really tender  same pork what's used Pulled Pork Cilantro Pork though yet try those  runner TSA refreshing yet satisfying   Every order comes small chocolate dipped strawberry  If  enough dessert several house made desserts VERY sweet!  Soups also very tasty  tried lobster bisque clam chowder  lobster bisque better  bit spicy kick it  clam chowder big chunks clam but little salty side  <EOR> Its pretty decent place  packed hard find seat  Probably because grand opening   long line but really fast once there  personally disliked ordering system  quite few people ordering station  asked several times repete order few people  Other that   its pretty good  Good food  Clean atmosphere  Friendly people  definately conciser going back  <EOR> Well place disappointment say least  basically subway meets chipotle style restaurant which thought would enjoy   The lay little odd walk through several tables line which wasn't chained off no idea where actually go  Then when ordering service subpar opinion  Yes new place very busy but smile long way  none business happening behind line things being discussed coworkers shouldn't been   The food decent  Nothing rave about  panini tiny squished greasy  garden soup pretty good    Now reason star     spent rest day night sick stomach minor food poisoning  Still write stomach gurgling knots  never back again  <EOR> All staff friendly knowledgeable prompt which pleasant  I tried 4 sandwiches wasn't impressed any them   very small thin   sandwiches meant reheated because pressed panini already  The soups entirely different story   ingredients taste all soup extremely superior any soups area   enjoyed lobster bisque roasted red pepper lobster chicken enchilada chili wild mushroom bisque   Anything suggest soups  69 per add just know   All soups phenomenal but red pepper lobster fave far    suggestion any soups large container more if order bowl dining in   basically simply soups   also several desserts which all decadent very tasty <EOR> Food delicious place nice spacious  only reason didn't give five stars Wi Fi <EOR> I'm glad opening new restaurants Rainbow which dire need new restaurants but place good  love atmosphere love location but food just okay  felt though place didn't live hype others created it  Maybe because am health nut why didn't favor it  food didn't sick star service great  another star third star because food supposed healthy made fresh ingredients    I ordered Honey bacon club New England clam chowder  = sandwich 'meh' chowder watery  Husband ordered BBQ pulled pork chicken enchilada chili soup = sandwich nice tang but isn't 'must try' any means soup decently good hate add ons $0 69 each just sprinkle shredded cheese  I personally would come back unless outnumbered group friends wanted but try yourself! <EOR> Brand new location store looked clean modern  Service among food assemblers friendly enough  Realized forgotten use 50% off coupon soon sat down but wouldn't honor since already paid  wouldn't normally care except food mediocre $10 would've nice  Probably won't going back because that  <EOR> This fiancé I's first time Cafe Zupas little bit different expected  looking somewhere salad soup lunch New Year's Day however when Jason's Deli closed  remembered driving Zafe Zupas seeing open decided try out  When first walk restaurant looks amazing! However when walk order rather confusing  sure where line started ended where menus besides wall order etc   Once did order staff nice very helpful  Upon getting food pleasantly surprised receive complimentary chocolate covered strawberry fiancé loved it! When find table tad confusing since food court seating must pass drink station before finding your seat   this leads nearly bumping into other patrons both when sit down refills  food decent say because soup salad amazing but panini alright which evens out  Overall pleasant enough experience however would place top list return  Hope helps happy new year! <EOR> I've eagerly waiting opening new Cafe Zupas location Westside  We're bit spoiled Vegas all great places having multiple locations every corner valley wanted shave off 10 minutes driving Lake Mead location    With every new restaurant opening sure some growing pains as other reviewers pointed out but think location still same great service affordable high quality food options friendly atmosphere other locations to  always other locations mushroom bisque nuts berries salad husband picks delicious honey cilantro carnitas whatever soup looks good day  husband picked some food other day he said place packed even sent picture line aware if going during lunch hours  He said line still rather quickly food still hot neatly packaged upon arrival  really appreciated salad dressing put side greens weren't soggy  coming lot part commitment trying eat healthier but we'll see long holds year  <EOR> The sandwiches kinda small but price can't really complain  tried four sandwiches Cuban best  most meat pork really tender  If stick sandwiches small cheap lunch  But if soups salads add all add ons charge 65 cents each   I liked Cuban much ordered more sandwiches later  screwed order gave away sandwiches  gave dessert trouble  Million Pound bar something that  If eat whole thing sitting gain million pounds  very rich  Gf liked but took almost week finish it  Coconut chocolate chips peanut butter some kind brownie graham cracker base  free chocolate covered strawberry enough me  <EOR> I always wanted check Cafe Zupas  When lived other side town just off Eastern would end going Pin Kaow BJ's Brewhouse Beach Hut Subs Griddlecakes Smashburger Taco Y Taco  just bad luck being same area ALL other dining establishments   So when saw opened just street new house knew definitely going check out! Sure enough just other day experienced Cafe Zupas first time took away it     Pros  Fair prices get  $8 79 choice 2 3 Sandwhich Soup Salad  Employees very nice friendly  explained whole process answered questions had  Sandwiches huge but combined soup quite filling  Italian Club very tasty but Chili Enchilada soup incredible! want large serving next time! The restaurant new course very shiny clean  Chocolate covered strawberry each meal nice little touch    and yummy   I loooove strawberries!  Cons  It 45 degrees raining when dined blasting A C  Ummmm am freaking shivering please kill A C while eat?? am sure awesome July but first week January? think not  As others stated when first walk through door walk through bunch crammed little 2 4 seaters line  Must awkward hell busy days  definitely need fix that   Other tidbits  Fountain machine serves Coke products including Coke Zero! Yay! Nice little outdoor seating area front few table settings under umbrellas facing Rainbow Blvd   I very happy first visit Cafe Zupas definitely see many return visits future!  4 stars  <EOR> I've Zupas eastern wasn't impressed  Since location opened rainbow thought would give Zupas another try  glad did because soups amazing! But still impressed sandwiches  also love drink station variety delicious infused waters  coconut water pomegranate raw honey! <EOR> I've waiting Cafe Zupas open Rainbow since first saw sign  I'd never even heard before miss soup salad sandwich place frequented Florida  Bonus incentive try 50% off ENTIRE MEAL coupon received mail  finally try tonight  daughters vegetarians son not  very much appreciated number vegetarian items menu  ordered three Ultimate Grilled Cheese Cuban two cauliflower soups mushroom soup chicken tortilla soup  dessert girls chocolate mousse cake chocolate hazelnut creme brûlée  course all chocolate covered strawberries  Everything exceptional  am very picky soups  cauliflower soup perfectly seasoned mushroom soup good daughter wanted lick bowl  Ultimate Grilled cheese sandwiches reminded caprese salad flavor  wonderful dipped cauliflower soup way  really liked small pieces bread provided meals perfect sopping soup bottom bowls  desserts divine! tad confusing when first walked having never Cafe Zupas before but staff very nice quick help figure wanted through line quickly  liked seeing menu outside before walked well  extremely helpful decision making process because some idea menu before even walked in  would suggest maybe moving few tables booths around new customers know where when first walk but otherwise am definitely impressed  family returning often  might even sneak bowl soup while kids school every once while  The only downfall    Expensive  <EOR> Finally made way try place  wanted something quick casual craving soup sandwich  ordered New England crab sandwich chicken chili combo cherry chicken salad lobster bisque  Didn't really hit spot food mediocre wasn't great wasn't bad just    Mehhh  Yes probably back again wouldn't crave place but infused waters  Besides nothing else really impressed here  <EOR> I've wanting try place since saw opened its doors    Sadly more disappointed then impressed  I combo    Full sandwich half salad half soup   I turkey bacon avocado   sandwich decent  didn't blow away  figured bacon would still little crispy     Sadly no limp     looked sitting reach ins sometime   turkey just your normal sliced turkey u grocery store  Now real disappointment     avocados  love avocados main reasons why instead being fresh avocado slides     looked just smeared guacamole it  Very sad that  but flavor overall decent  3 5 The soup another disappointment  call soup even though call chowder because chowder  When chowder expect going thick chunky   brothy chicken noodle soup  SALTY  very very SALTY  soup comes piece bread     call baguette    But just loaf bread shape baguette  even adding bread into soup SALTY     But hungry ate it     new England clam soup     flavor besides saltiness barely ok   no potatoes    Just lots lots celery  pieces clam miniscule   total miss  1 5 Best thing visit drink station  4 upgraded drinks included when u buy normal soda fountain drink  all natural made honey instead normal sugar sugar substitutes   tried 2 both well balanced overly sweet   If honey would recommend drinks honey very obvious  5 5 Free chocolate dipped strawberries     5 5     can't really complain free      Ambiance     very clean staff awesome  Very friendly   But knock star off since COLD there  coming someone thermostat home set 68     COLD  4 5 Overall would give them 1 more try     see if food quality improves   But won't rushing back here  <EOR> This second visit Cafe Zupas location prompted Grand Opening mailer 50% off your order  brought Ruben mom brother take advantage fantastic deal plus never Zupas   There's still construction going new plaza insanely busy little tricky maneuvering around lot  Parking also sparse which made even more chaotic  sure they'll rather busy long mailers running!  The lowdown CZ ORDERING straight line  menu available above food stations but also available convenient to go menus along line  sandwiches salads soups desserts   simple part  Making decision may take little more time since 13 sandwiches 12 salads 10 soups  Sandwiches sold whole but soups salads available large half options  There's very popular Try 2 Combo $8 79 offers sandwich half salad half soup it's also best deal   When your turn counter they'll ask if you're having sandwich salad  Then you're moved down line asked if want soup  Everything prepped you're walking  your meal being wrapped piece bread chocolate dipped strawberry verify your items before pay register also when choose your beverage options    BEVERAGES There's beverage station your usual fountain sodas freshly made teas lemonades all sweetened honey   area also home utensils napkins butter etc  salt black pepper grinders tables SEATING Please place your order before reserving seat quick service restaurant turnover equally fast we table just 25 minutes   really busy when arrived but still able find table four immediately receiving food wouldn't worry having seat table  Though sure could busier don't know situation   The verdict Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini Turkey bacon avocado tomatoes Muenster cheese housemade honey mustard  First sandwich MESS  avocado everywhere especially outside sandwich   Also certain avocado spread rather actual avocado  bread crunchy warm you'd except panini especially when pressed order unless prepared advance   also very little no salt surprising when there's bacon present speaking bacon flabby sad   assuming purposely don't salt foods allow season yourself? Basically sandwich lacked much needed texture seasoning  Even addition salt pepper still just okay   Honey Bacon Club Panini Turkey ham bacon tomatoes Muenster cheese housemade honey mustard  Again bread lacked crunch  Its flavor decent honey really stood without being overwhelming sweet  also didn't need additional salt  didn't love sandwich but enjoyed much more other panini   Roasted Red Pepper Lobster Soup neat combination two ingredients love lighter its described creamy   nice lobster fragrance could really taste several pieces lobster though odd texture   However just okay    Chicken Enchilada Chili Red green enchilada sauces chicken black beans Southwestern vegetables topped tortilla strips  bit thin chili since more soup stew but flavors good  would order again   Asian Citrus Chicken Baby field greens housemade yuzu miso vinaigrette chicken sugar snap peas edamame baby cucumbers tri color peppers mandarin oranges cashews wonton strips black sesame seeds  pleased salad wasn't overly dressed vinaigrette I hate drowning salads thought decent  mandarin oranges super mushy but fan them salads anyway   The sandwiches small but soups salads generous  accompanying bread pretty good though would much better toasted and butter forgot butter ! didn't eat chocolate covered strawberry time but remember being good Belgian milk chocolate    I'm overly impressed food  wonderful everything housemade but quick serve model compromising end product soft paninis soggy ingredients   great option healthier food when you're know  thing but prefer made to order product may take little more time  <EOR> First thing    entrance inconvenient  Walk door maneuver around all tables counter order   Perhaps side door would best but did check if open     Food came great   good price meal filling   Combo soup sandwich comes bread chocolate covered strawberry     My first time try pomegranate green tea   lovely!  Lightly fruity just enough honey refreshing yet slightly sweet iced tea! Haven't elsewhere  could something would keep coming back  <EOR> The set super awkward first foremost   almost walk shame your food   ordered strawberry harvest salad clam chowder   did chicken salad pressed chicken gag   didn't mind soup wasn't chowder any means warm hot either   lot potatoes clams tasted good   would back salad no chicken  <EOR> I am impressed trust thats huge coming me  am very peticular  turkey spinach artichoke sandwich clam chowder soup  amazing  hubby vegetarian sandwich lobster soup  tried some also amazing  Everything fresh they're fast very tasty  love place right near house its good  no lunch places around except sushi which love but its nice soup salad sandwich place nearby  entire system going kitchen  group making salads another making sandwiches another making soup  very happy meal atmosphere  definitely recommending place going back again lunch  Yum! Thanks Zupas coming neighborhood  <EOR> Comparable style Panera Bread except lower quality  Great upbeat customer service 5 5 but food subpar  2 5 crab sandwich lobster bisque combo both EXTREMELY salty really any flavors stood except salt  quite disappointed hope fix issue future  love little cafes hope back some improvements food  <EOR> Ordered Turkey Avocado Bacon sandwich  Asked Sweet red peppers sandwich side which standard other sandwiches  told no way charging them  therefore denied  But know charge 69 cents add ons your soup   So if can't way won't going back  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised cafe zupas!   The pick two option amazing deal  am  used Panera serving size delighted see pick two came whole sandwich generous portion soup    I pesto chicken sandwich only negative thing say really wanted more pesto  bread crunchy soft chicken smothered cheese topped sprouts  Very good!   I choose cauliflower soup oh goodness know cauliflower doesn't sound great fantastic! Creamy cheesy seasoned well!   My husband opted cheddar bacon topped soup which made much better!   The pick two also came slice baguette bread soft crusty bread chocolate dipped strawberry    We back sure! <EOR> A little upset location  seemed if staff rushed when restaurant hardly busy  weren't super helpful friend never weren't nice staff eastern location  mention half cup poured instead actual cup which paid for  Maybe next time? just drive way    <EOR> I Cafe Zupas few other times  seems very consistent across board all locations tried food same service same which good thing know your getting! Decent food decent price good service   I'm big fan Honey Bacon Club  don't care salads  soups pretty good but wish hotter when them eat just warm if don't eat fast enough almost cold  rather take home if heat bit  Love Garden Chowder its thick heavy chowder usually is   fan Wisconsin Cheddar smooth enough  Enchilada Tortilla soup pretty good  Red Pepper Lobster could use more lobster  think soup toppings rip off price  69 but sometimes can't resist adding some cheese soup  free side bread your order chocolate covered strawberry yum! Cakes dessert bars good crème brulee isn't real never again  I return Café Zupas where ever may be! <EOR> I ecstatic when saw opening location because live nowhere near others huge fan eastern location  I've three times since opening am extremely unimpressed   1  Yes entrance tricky but adults difficult find entrance line going complain that   2  biggest complaint every time extremely overstaffed which would automatically think quick friendly service   Completely wrong  slowest assembly line over 8 workers time ever experienced actually pathetic slow when lines aren't outrageous chipotles lines longer less workers   impatient person don't mind waiting food but why many people getting paid stand around? top while you're line prepared asked ordered over 5 times different workers  haven't experienced any rude staff  fact most very friendly maybe  made return  just find assembly line extremely disorganized   3  salads delicious especially mango berry another reason returned  but don't prepared anything fantastic when you're ordering soups  tried tomato bisque accompany grilled cheese  sandwich really good tomato bisque disgusting  it sweet yes sweet  so gross none other soups look appetizing either   4  hoping just trial error because perfect location them open don't want disorganization keep giving place business  <EOR> I called place order heard great things place asked girl answered phone if place order pick up  response no joke no    you would place phone order 11am really?!!! just lost business along all coworkers! <EOR> So friend told Cafe Zupas because Lobster Bisque soup  checked Lake Mead location food options pricing immediately made think Panera Bread  soup good but better beloved Broccoli Cheddar soup Sourdough bread bowl Panera  reason alone likely choose Panera Bread if given choice future   However upon visiting new location think Zupas now edge  food options great  Just ordered Try 2 combo able whole Turkey Spinach Artichoke sandwich half salad Glazed Chicken Chipotle  came side bread chocolate covered strawberry  strawberry wonderful little addon Panera does do  Also Rainbow location House Made Drink Infusions lightly sweetened Raw Honey much healthier alternative soda sweet tea  inspired recreate home drop soda diet    This place gets bonus points all fresh produce local dairy overall healthy ingredients  Menu way easier navigate Panera well  New favorite cafe spreading word  <EOR> I first tried Cafe Zupas Salt Lake City UT when saw opened right next house excited! great place quick lunch  usually choose pick 2 combo  choose between sandwich salad soup  recommend turkey bacon avocado sandwich lobster bisque soup just all salads! also small piece bread chocolate covered strawberry    I wish cafe little less crowded tables arranged  feel when eating literally right next someone next table  Regardless I'd recommend place anyone loves sandwiches salads soups! provide great customer service they're quick well  <EOR> Loved place!

Soups definitely need kind weather! Thumbs people work they're all pretty friendly rude  <EOR> Cafe Zupas finally opened southwest side Vegas! time alive  Both exterior interior very modern industrial high ceilings mix wood metal accents  organization bit strange seeing enter through single instead double door awkwardly snake your way through dining tables order line  should followed Chipotle's footsteps separated section against wall line    There plenty seating even though line long moved very quickly  Employees MOST efficient but many them inefficiency negligible  much signage menu options seems little confusing daunting first  Basically order your salad sandwich first order soup dessert later if want some    My parents opted share two preset combos although order everything separately salads custom made    Conclusion? Price stellar food much healthier most fast casual restaurants there  There's great variety choices but find all flavors strong salty sweet much sauce   could barely finish kale quinoa salad because drenched sweet dressing made sick  just ask dressing side next time  sandwiches kind small dinky looking though  little chocolate strawberry nice touch   Great place stop quick lunch   Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 [3 100] <EOR> I've twice enjoyed both visits  Both times gotten pick 2 combo sandwich soup  wanting try salad but seems most salads follow formula sugary dressing + fresh fruit + candied nuts dried fruit am down sweet salads   Today ordered fresh herb chicken sandwich  am sensitive mayo it's gross lets real asked employee behind if chicken covered mayo he said no asked twice using different words and    covered mayo  hate complain ate anyways pretty OK  fresh avocado bacon soft bread made unsavory ingredient though won't mistake twice   The soups far favorite part coming Cafe Zupas  allow sample soups when choosing which almost *harder* decide  Today mushroom bisque fresh delicious  seems most mushroom recipes come truffle oil days which if done right tastes rubber but soup obviously super fresh  didn't taste weighed down heavy creams butters simply perfect   Lastly no calorie count any items  lost 40 lbs over past year BF lost 65 aren't obsessive but mindful lack nutritional info irks me  scared off higher calorie meals indulge weekly but would good know if healthy lunch really caloric splurge  Maybe soon? Then 5 stars! <EOR> We dining Zupas good 3 4 times week especially since close now new location rainbow   Quality food excellent however staff all same page could use some serious training ! toppings salads which supposed measured vary quite bit depending serving   Sometimes buy 2 extra topping just normal amount ! Last week picked   slow   4 people working 2 salads probably necessary ! confused   come home realize husbands salad also drenched vinegar asked mine along side ranch   4 kids couldn't run back redone over $8 salad trash ! next night let manager know happened didn't even apology ! Tonight prob made most mad portions vary much just 1 serving chicken husband request 3   large salad 7 toppings he 1 left then paid 2 additional   girl decided she would  charge 2 additional proteins instead regular toppings which $1 more each then regular   place needs game plan!
