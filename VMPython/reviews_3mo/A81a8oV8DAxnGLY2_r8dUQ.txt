Visiting California surprised find place   Located Seafood City now favorite drinks shop! really helps shopping while thirsty hungry haha    Staff really great new location  I highly recommend boba perfect consistency hard squishy  <EOR> FINALLY all say  loved going place since lived Cali boba places just weren't good Vegas  Finally here! Good service good food too  Definitely gonna regular here! <EOR> Who loves bubble tea?! If answered then you're awesome! If answered you're right! do  knew place opening since bobaholic why heck not?!  I busy day work last week decided bubble tea might day little better stopped lunch  Bad Idea  Short ribs took while prepare  guess  good thing piping hot succulent  Could slightly more tender but bubble tea place bad all  garlic rice wasn't very garlicky  Which funny because manager asked if wanted garlic rice said ok! Then he says its really good garlic rice  He lied     The milk tea ordered came combo ordered regular gave large  charged wrong undercharged told cashier said worry because couldn't figure new registers place only open few days    The royal milk tea itself pretty good  favorite but bad  boba standard soft slightly mushy boba find pretty much everywhere besides KFT  love KFT but no boba them  think everyone should secret because amazing texture flavor    Service great first time  Second time ok  good first time  second visit came today ordered Thai tea taro slush without boba  Thai tea tasted strong undrinkable IMO  taro slush pretty good but again think KFT killing boba taro slush game  Overall ok option if you're willing drive all way Chinatown   see place chill spot study chill drinks grab drink  Just steer clear Thai tea  <EOR> I Kiwi Yogurt Frost  very tasty but ripe enough  sour  I Opening Day 4pm  dont interior lacks light while giant row windows let sunlight beam through ugly migraine promoting ray  ruins true beauty interior design  Also stuff said things weren't menu even though menu  should little more prepared revised  cashier speaks WAY SOFT  friend both counter BOTH leaning forward ear facing BOTH obviously cant hear pose cashier did bother meet halfway raising voice  really now? She shouldnt cashier position  hope she didnt things harder customers actually LEGIT hard of hearing! <EOR> Great finally Tapioca Express outside California  few times happy opened location Las Vegas  add good boba place east side town! came Monday night few patrons usually don't adventurous but risky considering boba place? must add though hate when try something norm am satisfied  ahead order hazelnut snow because wanted ice blended  Mmm mmm! sure delicious  glad able execute good taste drink just California locations do  notice when something popular California then comes Vegas just good  Thankfully Tapioca Express did disappoint! POS card system working night only card left them no choice but give drink house  certainly thankful reason am writing them review  Since POS card system wasn't working service tad bit slow but could tell employees doing could through processes faster  inside course new which nice clean somewhat modern touches  Tapioca Express definitely new boba spot town! <EOR> I'm happy finally Tapioca Express Vegas! now ordered Iced Milk Tea w boba love it! milk tea's sweet plain either  boba's perfect cheap! Service fast order probably less minute paid which good  definitely come back  Highly suggest come try tapioca express if want some great boba drinks! They also combo meals crispy chicken rice sausage rice etc! <EOR> I visited place first time  interior looks very new nicely decorated  tried strawberry banana boba  noticed did use real strawberries but instead used syrup  Taste wise still tastes very much strawberry banana though!   I would recommend place boba  <EOR> It might first check but three times already  time brought boyfriend me   They wide range flavors when comes milktea tea snow bubble my personal favorite   Lychee usually flavor but also tried passion fruit which delicious  also mix flavors caramel thai tea snow bubble boyfriend asked for    The staff super friendly easy talk to  price very reasonable  drink under $5!   Overall spot definitely satisfies boba cravings <EOR> This place pretty good love food choices yummy however honeydew milk tea business   appreciate fresh though along other selections   crispy chicken awesome! <EOR> The place looks pretty promising  changes moment talk cashiers  asked items menu she looked really puzzled  She then answered she doesn't know all mainly because she doesn't work kitchen  right bright red flag probably should left  someone works restaurant should well aware you're selling  only but she also made various mistakes order  All going while manager clearly standing next her  He did absolutely nothing help clarify anything  food itself appetizing especially price  recommend getting sisig fries  pretty disgusting  <EOR> Being California love TapEx find Las Vegas awesome ! love clean restaurant customer service 100% food drinks great  <EOR> I absolutely love place! Sometimes wait little long but drinks worth it  Tried longanisa fries enjoyed those well mango black tea taro snow bubble coconut snow bubble far  Also love fact offer soy milk option  Would recommend place sure! <EOR> I am still jumping joy tap ex Vegas!   Walked greeted immediately unlike location Cali since already knew menu order quickly    I ordered Xxtra spicy chicken snack order wish really spicy am use burning lips spicy but just dash yes dash spice  gave decent portion too   Mango Icy w Boba Mango Jelly didn't taste mango much sweet side  ton tapioca but enough jelly plus boba chewy soft   **Buy Large Drink free Taro Milk Tea first time having DELISH  thought would taste rubbery plant but hey something didn't pay came delicious Three stars quick friendly service  Also Taro drink! <EOR> Me hubby decided wanted boba random late night craving yelped place before leaving house  Yelp said close midnight excited open late YAYYY!!!! live  northwest part Vegas 20minute drive Tapioca  Express guess place CLOSED!!!!!!!!!
