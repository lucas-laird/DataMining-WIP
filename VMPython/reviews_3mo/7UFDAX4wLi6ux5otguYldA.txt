Long story short If Andiron your price range immediately! <EOR> Everything fabulous Andiron last night!  Having fan Honey Salt long time expecting step disappointed   The decor feels modern classy! large dining room view into kitchen vibrant welcoming feel   separate bar outdoor dining add ambiance     We two servers Jacob Ryan very attentive but intrusive   meal perfectly  paced   Best all  food absolutely delicious perfectly prepared  oysters start then steak   also loved mac n cheese waffle ordered sampler sauces leeks mushrooms   Everything delicious   lemon meringue pie cheesecake   A great addition Summerlin   new favorite place dine! <EOR> This far best Elizabeth Blau establishment food outstanding!  few different steaks sides   Mac Cheese waffle super good!  would just give few weeks iron kinks service etc but otherwise place awesome!! <EOR> I 7 45 reservation arrived 5 minutes early   able sit coveted private dining room which fact patio area   only wanted sit very pleasant night when wind stopped temperature pleasant   Service started quickly remained top notch throughout entire evening   ordered iced tea brought small shaker bottle simple syrup   My order included French onion soup appetizer 9 ounce Wagyu skirt steak foie gras addition main course accompanied Mac Cheese waffle   dessert ordered crème brûlée doughnuts   It seemed long wait onion soup but enjoying beautiful evening people watching patio afforded   could hear music inside patio proved golden place sit night   The onion soup brought well worth wait   rich broth sliced onions topped gruyère parmesan cheeses very good   Shortly soup brought server asked if wanted some bread   asked some but asked small amount  not full portion   brought two end pieces wonderful bread butter topped some black salt crystals   excellent   butter softened warm bread spread beautifully   I asked steak rare possible difficult request skirt steak because lack thickness cut   done perfectly   accompanied glazed shallot some chimichurri sauce small gravy boat type container   side three pieces mac cheese waffle server urged eat waffle while hot   This cut steak known its flavor very good   tender moist   foie gras outstanding   first thing ate savored every piece   mac cheese waffles served same type small gravy boat but cheese sauce   Altogether waffles foie gras steak made outstanding main course     Room dessert  of course   Well did leave waffle but server correct eating while hot   lost little something waffle cooled somewhat   server told special sorbet evening but crème brûlée doughnuts   right choice make   doughnut holes filled vanilla custard good   None three left   Service throughout night excellent   main server Keith accompanied co server Lewis made sure iced tea glass always filled   seemed several servers inside when stepped quick breath fresh air stopped check me     Two hours later left having enjoyed private dining room filled good food   Prices high side  Downtown Summerlin pricing  but knew going there's no complaint that   very good dinner excellent service very enjoyable surroundings  <EOR> I very excited see another Elizabeth Blau restaurant open across street house! Unfortunately last nights dinner fell far short mark   started seafood tower which perfectly fine Las Vegas standards but nothing exciting   then moved onto steak tartar sea urchin toast   Both good tartar lacked flavor toast served grilled burned which distracted flavor   sea urchin very good would order again    The disaster came main course   ordered bone dry aged NY Strip   first arrived medium well  course returned steak when second came cooked correctly medium rare but meat absolutely no flavor all inedible   manager apologetic stated needed find new purveyor meat! Shocking dialed before opening! owners Elizabeth Kim attendance could see difference when opened Honey Salt   Maybe grow fast know Manager another unhappy guest before speaking us  room beautiful well appointed but service more importantly food lacking  cannot recommend restaurant think should remove steak name Andiron Steak Sea! <EOR> Arrived LA stay Red Rock very short walk away walking into restaurant realized great choice made ambience feel   Very comforting classy feel moderately low noise level  Great romantic dinner setting  Erik server totally ball professional but still  friendly service  Can wholeheartedly recommend lamb chops skirt steak  Also Buratta grilled veg salad   Definitely return next visit  <EOR> My first 5 star review  Beautiful space reminiscent Vintner Grill  Informative kind staff  Nice menu  Flatiron steak served rare instead requested medium but  ok great flavor but tad oily  highly recommend Mac n Cheese Waffle best ever tasted quite unique  <EOR> Service ambience excellent  Found food mediocre  filet half well done half medium rare  Mac n cheese waffle very dry cheese sauce served side enough  prices reasonable kind food serve alcohol prices  Might grab drink maybe try lunch probably dinner again  <EOR> We 7 45 dinner reservations 6 people Saturday night  arrived 7 35 checked in  Finally 8 15 seated only slight apologies hostess but no offers compensations any kind  Bad first impression hence missing fifth star    The drinks pricey but good  French onion soup amazing!
