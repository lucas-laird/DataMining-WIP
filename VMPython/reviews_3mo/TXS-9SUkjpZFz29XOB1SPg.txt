Really disappointed   food mediocre   we never back  <EOR> This place garbage    we waited over hour 20 minutes food  2 tables came way served before completely finished  brought 1 meal 13 minutes others    completely wrong mix Catfish porkchops? reasoning behind long wait don't serve anyone until all orders done   food mediocre  Mac n cheese tasted frozen   Greens salty  Hoe cakes good only plus   member party ordered dessert go   they charged then forgot it! NEVER eat again! <EOR> To jump straight point okay  Three people oarty ordered full order fried chicken full order catfish half order bbq chicken    I and only speak taste fried chicken  fried chicken well seasoned   but meat itself seemed kind dry  also ordered greens mac cheese mashed potatoes  mashed potatoes alright nothing extraordinary  Mac cheese wasn't cheesy prefer but again  alright  greens    cook greens pretty particular  prefer mine spicy greens not  quite smokey tasting  Some people prefer that    The pros joint lot space mason jar kool aid drinks general nice touch hot water cornbread served meals great!   There room improvement service  person acting hostess day she also serving wish gotten sat section sweet attentive  server stopped take order drop off food check  server never checked drinks    food tasted  thinking maybe she having bad day but served    leave your home problems home   There also room improvement flavor quality some food    but may vary person  Those did grow eating and or cooking soul food may know ha but executed much better    Speaking everything outside hostess    just seemed everyone didn't really care today  Perhaps just those days? antsy try other location    used seeing soul food joint every other corner  don't always feel cooking ha!  Don't come Vegas soul food    if really craving try location if want but don't expect anything blow your mind  <EOR>
