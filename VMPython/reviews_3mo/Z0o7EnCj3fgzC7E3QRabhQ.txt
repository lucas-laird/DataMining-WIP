But chicken came alone without pasta without pizza less 5 minutes  asked if could keep warm until finished salad but literally 2 minutes back time being delivered clueless manager named Sabrina  tried tell just sent back kept warm but she confused defensive frankly totally uncaring  back again only come back couple minutes later time pasta underneath chicken  no Alfredo sauce found until 5 minutes later when came separately small bowl   We told pasta would served square dish but came underneath chicken  cost extra   Our server Marcus excellent personality must frustrated lack support manager well numerous deficiencies kitchen  could manager back up? wouldn't frustrated absolute failure management? Poor guy   I tried talk Sabrina but she could possibly cared less say  tried explain myself let know very engaged local restaurant scene but she having none just defending herself stating long she restaurant business  Instead welcoming feedback she annoyed dared even talk her   After knowing all issues occurred she never came back table  once  She never apologized  She never offered even cup coffee  Nothing  She walked past several times nose air both literally figuratively    And never saw approach even single table check anyone dining room  Maybe she just couldn't handle truth   After finished eating sat while Sabrina lots opportunities come back check things right  She did none it  She knowingly intentionally let leave unhappy   Frankly she embarrassment Tony's good name total misfit restaurant  Tony did where he today allowing such unprofessional managers represent him  hope he gets wise cuts before new restaurant much potential crashes burns   We try again maybe third time maybe last time  absolutely certain report back experience  <EOR> Tartufo pizza great!
