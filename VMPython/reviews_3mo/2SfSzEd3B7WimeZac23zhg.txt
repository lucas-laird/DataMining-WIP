Simple 1 part new building smell 1 part central air conditioning 2 parts roasted coffee beans voila! Instant airplane smell!  Like most new places Vegas place looks really nice but setup bit strange  feels am train station airport terminal  Again may just because smelled airplane mind just drifted those associated memories but mind funny thing    I digress    The reason am giving place 4 stars big reason is opera cake delicious  opera cakes before but takes cake pun fully intended   words barista recommended selection change your life  don't know if would far say left two stone tablets 10 commandments share chosen people read facebook but definitely left happy tummy warm memories ganache spread across layers chocolate mousse fluffy chocolate pastry  definitely worth ordering especially if love chocolate  Definitely airplane food   And now free move cabin  <EOR> I tonight Yelp book club's bi monthly together   wasn't best place meet because music albeit nice bit loud hear everyone discussed book   I iced chai tea latte tasty   could used bit more chai flavor   None any pastries can't comment them although looked very nice   I Leone lot   If you're having your coffee house give number deliver your table   see coming back early evening sitting patio sipping latte people watching   lot room outdoor patio   The place could garner extra star when back great coffee some good pastry   We'll see  <EOR> Located whimsical Tivoli Village beautiful cafe picturesque place sip drinks grab light bite salads sandwiches sweet treats people watch    A beautiful place such Leone Cafe should amazing drink concoctions crafted skilled baristas right? still fence this  ordered Chai Tea Latte which sweet  even thought adding more milk dilute but alas no non fat milk counter only half half 2%   needed more spice more sugar syrup  Next time ask them cut back sweet    The pastries behind glass display looked delightfully delicious tempted try one  Maybe next time  <EOR> I Leone Cafe  serve some tasty treats some delectable drinks  tried Tiramisu bite Opera Cake  Both very good  also Double Espresso Large Mocha  Espresso OK but Mocha delicious without being overly sweet  somehow coffee art managed preserve itself through most large cup!  My first time Leone Cafe little strange  some reason place totally smelled airplane  thought purely due coffee aroma but Jade W appropriately pointed could new building smell  guess combination but any case didn't feeling second visit   I'll honest  still prefer Sambalatte  just atmosphere over better  But there's absolutely nothing wrong Leone  pretty interior ample seating  fan  <EOR> My litmus test coffee shops hot chocolate   If mean hot chocolate am intrigued come back more   am pleased report hot chocolate Leone Cafe very very good   only thing disappointing price   $2 25 small hot chocolate portion size espresso cup   But take quality over quantity   The cafe large comfortable   think worked well Yelp book club because all could sit big circle crammed  Free wifi without code! outdoor seating area definitely place see seen once Tivoli Village more 3 stores   prefer Sambalatte because unique coffee drinks brewing methods but back Leone try opera cake other items  <EOR> I really Cafe Leone but coffee only ok     Cafe Leone offers great place sit outside enjoy cup coffee two  free wifi plenty room sit outside  seating area mostly covered stay sun which nice   pastry also average well    There's nothing distinguishes Cafe Leone except comfortable ample seating outside  enough frequent place   Bottom line coffee 2 atmosphere 4  Average 3  <EOR> Friendly service! But does mean adequate great customer service  Merely equal measure  Ounce dis   Friends know much enjoy chai dirty chai any coffee shop  decided give joint try!   Rundown Came asked kind chai guys use?

Thinking back total my mistake only charged amount chai price which means no added shot espresso  Sad  Perhaps she doesn't know dirty chai is  Maybe dirty water dirty cup?! hope not Pluses spacious café area just beautiful inside marble floors?    Benefit second try understanding they're still new  next time more aware follow thru  Oh but yet try coffee <EOR> Stopped while browsing Fresh 52 decided bite eat   We shared Leone Breakfast which deconstructed  looking plate savory sweet items didn't seem flow together   To honest White Chocolate Batard Bon Breads tent better breakfast option   so good nibbling half loaf back another enjoy home   ALOHA!!! <EOR> My husband thought great   He Italian Steamer coffee delicious   standard iced cappuccino which also good   also apricot pastry   again delish   When first thing noticed nice decor is   really keeps feel Tivoli Village   Everything pastry case looked good   fresh beautifully displayed    My only criticism   we only ones counter checking menu   Instead staff just staring would nice acknowledged asked if could answer any questions  Will keep away?  No we're already planning next visit  <EOR> We hit place every Saturday morning dog  LOVE coffee absolutely crazy over breve  wide variety European style cafe breakfasts but even though ordered same plate five weeks row plate different each time  still tasty but different probably only drawback us  love environment overall don't orange juice  smoothies good hear they look good when order dine adorably dressed service persons deliver food coffee your table  If food service more consistent would give five start sure  <EOR> I LOVE coffee here!
