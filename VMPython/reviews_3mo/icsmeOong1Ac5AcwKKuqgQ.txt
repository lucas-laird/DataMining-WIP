I number 1 fuku 'lucky' burger 3 buta 'pig' burger while boyfriend spicy burger both trips  While all good felt number 3 most flavor  and spicy burger isn't spicy which coming someone doesn't eat ton spicy food however friends thought really spicy   so if you're super sensitive maybe should just skip it     overall though believe almost everyone group felt satisfied eating here  and if don't mind little wait your food should definitely come here! <EOR> Was happy find Fuku brick mortar spot  Expect price buck two more truck regular  paying location convenience    I number three  Love burger bacon ginger such great combo  If looking great burger near strip it  Forget those overpriced gourmet burger place just linq then fame then fuku  say don't fries  Overpriced getting  only complaint when comes fuku  would say forget fries second burger  Yep ticket  2 great burgers hold mediocre fries    Definately reccomend try place  <EOR> Worth wait just vibe alone mention burgers jazz fries crack sauce  Check website locations early  far number 4 front runner hint ginger defines taste  Hope check them out  <EOR> Oh bad  Bad bad bad bad  food  delicious  bad because now Fukuburger which fairly easy don't chasing all over town  bad waste line ever aging heart  Those Japanese taken science burgerology turned into art form  Bachi till favorite true love but Fuku guilty pleasure  little thing side when am feeling little naughty need something quick messy debauchery    There no way describe burger other say hot mess indistinguishable organic matter somehow congeals into only imagine ecstasy would taste if could sensation flavor  don't forget fries  Gotta fries  little spice those sensitive scoville scale warned  hot normal human but dined someone trouble eating bell peppers complained spice  ever burger order needs friend egg it  need should law soon bill through state assembly    So why five stars  Weeellllll   it's food  surroundings no bathroom FAME whatever hell is  bathroom outside 70 meters down restaurant   fine except Fukuburger messiest things ever eat  can't finish without covering hands sticky burger paste caustic should used seal reactor Fukashima  something want walk 70 meters Las Vegas sun hardening your hands  Second thing FAME whatever hell styles itself night club random moments stereo systems comes blasting speakers until DJ equipment right  But rest assured once he gets settled then music gets really loud  Tuesday night 7pm sounded meat grinder top iron forge which built underneath 747 constantly taking off middle Electric Daisy Carnival  stupidly loud  Next time might just buy burger take across street Flour Barley which great bar great bartenders pretty chill Tuesday night vibe  <EOR> Not cracked price   $16 fries burger egg fried onions small soda   burger small fries   Very disappointing high hopes reading all rave reviews  <EOR> It's time Fukuburger pronounced Foo Koo noobs permanent location  Located inside F A M E  which stands Food Art Music Entertainment which also houses other Asian food stands welcome site visiting tourists locals alike    For those new Fukuburger started originally food truck Colin Fukunaga Robert Mags Magsalin  Thus food truck theme welcomes soon enter FAME   Now important part  food  menu plain simple  Each burger number picture description  tried them all but some reason its always toss between #4 Kinoko Mushroom Burger which all beef fuku patty grilled shitake mushrooms pickled red ginger teriyaki finished wasabi mayo #5 Karai Spicy Burger which all beef fuku patty pickled cucumbers avocado cream finished habenero kabayaki   Sometimes when im real hungry both  Most cases combo Jazz Fries fries some kind gravy garlic sauce top it   Some call crack sauce very addicting   As some negatives course price pay marked up  gotta understand rent pay probably ridiculously high based fact the strip   whatever profit probably just enough cover lease overhead  probably just enough profit  lunch today Spicy Karai Burger Jazz Fries medium drink 17 some change   dollar tip when hot looking chick takes your order scream TIP JELLY!   Boy am glad drinks unlimited refills   The other negative thing which Fuku no control over no bathroom area where eating  outside 50 yards down  would say thats fail design architects  food court does bathroom right ready go?   Some random info Yes take cards  hours vary  Since still practically new no set hours just yet per Yelp business listing  Rule thumb usually open lunch around 11 close late fridays saturdays  recommend call first before heading if think its late already  pleasure having burger named me  ended being called Roger's free burger special Refer pic  Message if want hear whole story   Which reminds sometimes specials off wall but amazing Ronald McFuku Burger Chicken Waffles the Asian version even longonisa burger ask any Filipino tell you  Lol    So closing amazed flavor encounter eating any menu items here  Also dont afraid track down truck if dont want trip Linq   Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #166 Stop Fuku'ing around Fuku down here! <EOR> terrible  absolutely terrible  ahhh hype   notice yelpers review place California   and if some city no one's heard city nasty food    i love good juicy burger friend local said place BOMB  thought friend would know better since dined together great  meals around area but WTF    $8 burger   ordered #1 a regular burger #2 burger egg lots weird sauce    hoping egg would runny but overcooked tiny really salty   $3 $4 fries  Ordered both garlic fries gravy fries   MEH  prefer N over garbage   think thought local employee because pretty damn good discount top order    whateverz   it still nasty  lol  the only fun thing place creative your name giving them nickname   when your food ready call your name    gf thought it'd funny called hot mama when food ready announced hot mama your order ready lol   the people super friendly service great    food just junk  <EOR> This place fail friends family  ordered two burgers fries  Waited good 20 25 minutes    The burgers cut half thankfully were  When opening mouth take bite meat RAW!!!  The cashier shocked when she seen when she showed cook he responded want cooked more? trying cooking first time!  What hell you're new  But need properly learn cook burger  <EOR> Yay!!! happy opened actual restaurant  never able chase down food truck  But worth wait really cool location  tried egg burger delicious  garlic fries crack sauce sauce totally lives its name addictive! Plus ordering give silly them call when you're orders ready  lot fun ideas next time  <EOR> it took almost 20 30 minutes front line line wasn't even door   pretty slow didn't seem most efficient   fries additional cost extremely soggy not worth price    burger itself ok   whatever special fuku sauce used really tasty sauce sweeter side   hard hear them call names due very loud background music    a meal under $15 vegas good price though   but probably won't back  <EOR> This best thing ate Vegas trip  Surpassed all fancy expensive meals    burger cooked perfectly the meat quality great cook med rare  Every topping well though added flavor burger  I fried egg top    wasn't even hungry when ate burger but time done wanted more!  The only downfall took for     ever    burger  20+ minutes    must killing cow back    rarely drop stars service but did case   I lived Vegas before Fuku Burger Truck many times am glad see establishment here  <EOR> I never fan burgers until Fukuburger   really happy venue Linq because tired hunting down truck whatever location night   only two things Tamago burger garlic fries crack sauce   tamago burger fantastic because awesome savory meat patty topped over easy egg friend shoestring onion rings   only bad thing very messy when eat but tastes awesome! <EOR> So Vegas few weeks now just moved stumbled place called FAME place awesome but inside FAME burger place wow probably best burgers ever Japanese fusion take relatively plane item flavorful Katsu chicken sandwich also great place must try staff friendly really effort great time def come back ! Fantastic 4 !! <EOR> It's hard chase down late night food truck when little bugger   But finally try Fukuburger!  Does live hype?  FAME Linq where Fukuburger located glorified food court lots graphic art creating hip vibrant space   Fukuburger immediately visible faux truck corner   think other tenants may suffering lack visibility even guide offered inside   Ok back Fuku    Let's start off burger togarashi fries   Unfortunately miss us   Buta burger bacon cheese pickled onion ginger bbq sauce wasabi mayo   burger patty small fries stale   served and service took long even if place wasn't packed looked very different food shots see Fukuburger truck   Somehow magic little lost permanent spot   But Naga Dog wow stellar even if bread little stale   hot link smoky savory lovely snap when bit into because deep fried   comes awesome grilled kimchi which little wilted but caramelization grill tames tangy bite    stuff spicy but exceptionally good!  complemented pickled daikon relish   creative successful alternative onions!  Then hot dog topped nori which wish more of wasabi mayo   Mmm   read supposed come kabayaki eel sauce but didn't any mine   Even if am huge fan sweet savory think would gelled beautifully spicy elements hot dog   Still really enjoyed balanced all those elements successfully   Maybe if scoot over truck perfect version   For tourists strip believe would convenient sop does job even if pricier around $2 3 per menu item    But if want little more love your plate I'd hunt down food truck  <EOR> Wanted compared another mushroom burger recent past didn't stand quality  okay but best burger ever had  <EOR>
