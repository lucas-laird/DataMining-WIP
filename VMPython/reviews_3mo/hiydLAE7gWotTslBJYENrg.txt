Pretty good  Very similar most Japanese restaurant's curry  Whatever fried stayed crispy  Nothing bad but nothing extraordinary either    Service good   I felt prices little high considering portion sizes  Everyone knows everything Hawaii more expensive mainland  However could same curry plate  double portion still cheaper kaba curry  Simple things just adding little more rice more curry sauce would just plate look fuller customers feel they're getting great deal  Rice sauce most inexpensive things restaurant don't feel people need stingy those  Just little comparison ichiza beef curry around $8 loaded beef vegetables rice never finish all always some lunch tmrw well  Here   I paid same price basically just curry sauce rice katsu cleaned plate off still felt hungry    The atmosphere super awkward well! don't wanna offend ppl into cosplay world but    I felt restaurant mini convention that! Everyone bright colored wigs dressed anime playing magic cards! wasn't even Halloween! only normal customers there  just awkward! seems they're friends owners cuz even behind counter freely  felt another world just wanted finish food leave  mean if you're into those kinda things don't mind place packed cosplay ppl then sure maybe you'll atmosphere  But wasn't me    I'll stick ichiza  More food buck don't feel another world there  <EOR> Hands down best Japanese style curry Vegas! \^^ <EOR> Ive coming since first opened ive coming once week since then great vibe great mix wonderful homemade food I even Kaba cravings all time all desserts great glad see them grow watch dream along menu  <EOR> Kaba Curry curry house Japanese?
