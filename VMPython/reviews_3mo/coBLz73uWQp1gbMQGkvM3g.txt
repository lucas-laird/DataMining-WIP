Since now pay full price food asked nice hostess seat table  atmosphere really nice! table nice spacious 4 top neat watching hibachi tables  However server TERRIBLE! He walked multiple time took forever greet us  When he finally did greet asked multiple times extra paper order sheet place additional orders which never he spoke low couldn't understand seemed very unsure take order  ordered variety food gyoza good but better other sushi joints Hawaiian roll Love roll Secret Husband  sushi nothing write home decided try something completely different  ordered jalapeno cracker good! Tasted grilled tuna fish sandwich jalapenos! server never asked if wanted another glass wine while glasses sat empty but quick fill waters clear plates  He never offered dessert which would ordered because still hungry took another 20 minutes finally bring check  Thank god groupon because would really upset paid full price  Having worked service industry over 15 years understand hardships opening new restaurant  However making sure your staff fully prepared key  Sadly 3 customers lost awful experience  Very disappointed  <EOR> It great experiece much much better thought it!! am sure guys would surprise w Geisha house!!!
