Monday 5 30pm    place busy    it took long time order hoping something fresh delicious  WRONG!  burgers mushy tasteless   the chili fries inedible!  If area looking burger    Sonic across street <EOR> This restaurant seems market more towards those want food late   so late went  three times around 10 pm try famous shakes every time the shake machine down  Each time felt forced order something considering drive thru  Twice simple orders botched  Terrible multiple first impressions  Food wasn't even worth extended wait  <EOR> I've liked Checkers Rally's glad see them back valley  menu varies enough set them apart Sonic Drive in across street  However location still very new haven't worked all kinks yet  Expect wait  three times longer favorable wait time twice  <EOR> This place pretty awesome  lot old Rally's remember kid  Fries aren't quite insanely good remember but burgers pretty good  But careful leaving drive thru! super narrow sharp bend tire rub marks all over damn thing    clipped rim    damn it    <EOR> Total disappointment    Considering sonic right across street don't see any reason why anyone would choose checkers over that  tried chili dog spicy chicken sandwich medium seasoned fries  chili chili dog seems mostly bbq sauce pretty gross   spicy chicken sandwich ok    pretty standard fast food     The seasoned fries actually quite good but super stingy them   medium smaller average small fries anywhere else    I don't think coming back <EOR> Compact Location careful when exiting entering store must cross over drive thru area enter leave store  manager distracted when taking order morning  manager didn't seem know combo separate items sizes prices customer menu board making experience even more confusing  Then before taking money he said he would right back ran outside store deliver late drive thru order  manager also forgot give cup water asked for  Even though 24 hour location shake machine ready shakes morning  15 minute wait shakes told then when ready made counter pick up  return counter pick food also deliver table  Some portion sizes combos special deals good but service manager lousy today two walk customers  <EOR> Prices good but fries addictive  only complaint put way much sauce condiments burgers <EOR> So checked place few times am hooked fries grilled cheese sticks! Fries great flavor texture cooked perfection  grilled cheese sticks if you're cheese lover its gooey cheesy try! Now dessert if chocolate craving sweet tooth especially if you're woman your Friend town lol try oreo sundae! #OreoLover haha Anyways tried most menu items think burgers chicken sandwiches average considering fast food joint gourmet restaurant  best part they're cheaper price wise compared everything else  there  only complaint if you're drive thru wait them finish cooking your food want park front red no parking zone dont designated place park wait them finish bring your food  <EOR> I excited when saw sign coming soon!! east coast girl just Five Guys Checkers pretty popular us  location yet disappoint! food ALWAYS hot fresh mention GOOD! favorites Asian wings Champ burger  Oh talk those perfectly seasoned crispy fries #jackpot!
