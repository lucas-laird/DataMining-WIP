If you're dining request vegan cheese which tofu based  melts PERFECTLY  even asked server double check because way believable! ordered Verdure pizza zucchini eggplant artichoke mushrooms spinach sans pecorino mozzarella since they're dairy   even made more flavorful topping slices arugula salad which came light yet flavorful vinaigrette  over still trippin' tofu cheese  Delish!  2  ambience  inside restaurant detailed designed baseball stadium mind  Silver bleachers actually hang high ceilings tables made ash wood same exact wood used baseball bats  Dope! bar chairs look fresh found they're actually repurposed oil drums shipped Italy  Faaancy  bar right next kitchen there's lot action going around here    3  patio  chose sit outside since nice day  felt mellow laid back yet energy all people walking through LINQ's outdoor shopping plaza  Plus gazing High Roller while munching some pizza slices isn't shabby either    4  location  mean I'd still even if weren't such cool shopping space but being LINQ even cooler  If want vegan dessert only couple steps Sprinkles which serves red velvet vegan cupcakes upon request  Holla!   5  hubby happy  He enjoyed food know we'll come back visit! He's vegan he enjoyed clam pasta fancy schmancy type grilled cheese sandwiches Mozzerella en Carroza if want technical   Needless say he gobbled everything up!   We're locals say we'd back Strip resty means lot  Plus staff friendly catered dietary needs  Anyone doesn't give the eye being vegan coo' peoples book ya feel me!   I recommend dining outside definitely night during summer months! just because people watching High Roller view awesome  But inside cool especially if want experience baseball stadium buzzing bar scene  just hoping vegan tofu cheese stay!   Oh if you're looking eat like hitting show Brooklyn Bowl aw yee kinda rhymed! there's convenient walk pizza window left resty    Get your pizza on! <EOR> Rating totally based pizza which waaay overpriced came undercooked  toppings looked quality but top miniature doughy pizza lost  Look pictures pizza average size dinner plate  Other food may great but never know cuz won't back   Service ok    Short version pizza sucks <EOR> The restaurant looks adorable welcoming which is kind of  First only serve sangria pitcher  found strange isn't difficult sangria pour into single glass  really wanted some but wasn't going order entire pitcher myself 1145am  service slow really slow  food good red pizza white pizza  also iceberg salad some lettuce brown  $12 some measly salad ridiculous  ALL food overpriced  restrooms no seat covers even empty dispenser  just simply don't provide them period  ok but being many other restaurants Vegas wouldn't dine again  <EOR> A whole pizza size plate only 4 slices  better Vegan pizza other parlors    Seems only woman's men's restroom would wait line busy day  practical  <EOR> The place great address  Sitting outside good people watching  food average best  asked cheese left off pizza salad  salad basically just bowl lettuce $12 00 same pizza  Very basic   paying location quality food  <EOR> Amazing  Brick oven pizza authentic Italian dishes   Taby great server knew menu offered great suggestions  All pizza fantastic bellinis best dessert  <EOR> Awesome calamari app Parma pizza  heavy salty  Fantastic service Tabbi!!!

Skip!     end review  only time should if you're much rush eat anywhere else  Due chewy dough unremarkable sauce fact might sitting all day all slices mediocre best  Everything seems pretty low quality maybe slight step Domino's Papa Johns  seems some higher quality items inside maybe yourself favor eat but seen 3 slices rocked might much better    Prices $4 plain slice $5 topping $5 75 specialty slices   bleh Compare Pop Pizza serving 2 specialty slices soda $7 some change <EOR> I'll echo most other reviewers say place much expensive get   Dinner two one pizza order calamari 4 beers bill just under $100 before tip   food mostly mediocre   calamari fine but pizza bland quite few steps below Due Forni Settebello Grimaldi's Those Guys Pies Custom Built   restaurant itself pleasant I appreciated don't pack tables closely together most restaurants server good   said don't think back   Brooklyn Bowl next door   Its food just expensive but also leaps bounds better place   Really disappointing  <EOR> i definitely agree previous reviews OVERPRICE 11 inch four sliced pizza  quattro pizza which basically four cheese pizza  taste okay nothing great it  crust super thin  hubby carbonara pizza  tried slice flavor sunnyside egg pizza just overpowered taste all ingredients  service though quite good but just takes approximately 30 40 minutes pizza come  <EOR> Great service truly lovely beer selection but ends there  Way overpriced is  But most importantly pizza tasteless  Seriously did find secret way suck flavor pizza? don't it  all  If closed eyes I'd no idea eating  <EOR> The food very good just don't expect leftovers portions small  Since tourist spot expect pay also  <EOR> Great place! Tony excellent  Jersey connection Toms River  even cannoli martini's  <EOR> We stopped because kids really wanted pizza before going high roller  food itself good just think overpriced was  Being locals could honestly see ourselves making effort come back but honest probably crowd after  <EOR> Pizza wasn't great ridiculously overpriced almost laughable    But hey late starving    The hostess dense but waitress friendly enough    Won't back  <EOR> Food mediocre best overpriced  Rotating beer cask great idea but half pint pint price just seems wrong  Server nice only other tables while there  Can't see making return visit  <EOR>
