The gelato pretty good  waiter recommended peanut butter jelly mango gelato  peanut butter jelly gelato really strong peanut butter taste  bad  Tiramisu gelato goood! <EOR> We Bellagio learning buffet Bellagio 2 hour wait! indeed better choice its quality food selections  salad bar reminds Brazilian fine bbq chain Fogo De Chao  crab meat served small plate special sauce just looks irrestistable  fact right  never really bother eat crab legs because shells but able manage  loved also its sushi sections able ask handroll shrimp avocado imitation crab meat spicy mayo   mom would cost $5 outside! totally money's worth  Oh vanilla gelato absolutely delicious! Nice another option besides going Bellagio Paris buffet  <EOR> By far best Buffet's Vegas  15 friends decided buffet brunch day Christmas   The chefs create small portions delicious dishes eliminating lot waste buffets create There fewer options regular casino buffet you'd used but more high quality food  Everything delicious point try everything where say confidence rivals Bellagio Wynn's buffet     If wasn't fact trying pass off orange flavored water orange juice management befuddled dumbfounded when brought attention would given them much high marks    Overall If eat buffet Vegas would Wicked Spoon Bellagio Wynn buffet's  <EOR> Cosmopolitan new hotel Vegas   staying Aria decided take short walk Cosmopolitan try buffet   price reasonable and also offer kids price unlike Bellagio food generally very good   good variety different well made dishes lot small plates   tell paid attention into making each dish into more complex offering instead typical buffet food   no premium meat crab legs but overall food more comparable nice tapas types place  Service wise clearly still getting speed   weren't enough wait staff dining room most staff seems busy wondering around but getting little accomplished   manager actually initially waited but when he off attending other businesses left without any service    Luckily good probably very few waiter came finished off service  Overall think definitely worth going but expect slower service just wait few month until system sorted out  <EOR> This buffet wonderful nice selection standards lamb salmon along some unusual choices bone marrow pork cheek    spacious well displayed staff friendly far price very reasonable   dinners $27 but believe price increase time   toured first then came back short time later eat found several people being given tours through buffet area I bet all came back too!

If guy likes served girls place because all servers waitresses    The Restaurant itself deserves 4 STARS  It very clean organized  seats new booths comfortable  tables good size enough space walk between tables  style modern which big plus!  The service deserves 5 STARS  All waitresses smiled very polite  know when need refill WATER BOTTLE   yes give each table bottle water could pour some your own glass  No waiting service even food area served smile   The food deserves 4 STARS  They serve  high quality food very delicious  servings decent amount but could always back if want more  sushi really Shirm Tempura Sushi  mushroom cooked red wine good! never anything cooked red wine but delicious  fried rice greesy all but good  Most food weren't greesy  deserts best! many choices choose from  Gelado ice cream cookies rice cakes much more!  The price reasonable SUNDAY BRUNCH $23 deserves 4 STARS   DEFINITELY GOING BACK TRY DINNER! <EOR> I into Cosmo hotel grab early dinner CES blown away decor ambiance Wicked Spoon Buffet  right 5pm no wait cost only $27 dinner  Affordable pricing such upscale looking buffet   I loved all food laid individual platings all sides cute mini plates pots  Definitely A+ looks  bad taste fell way short   At first though pretty tasty but alas just damn starving distracted pretty plates notice  But first plate noticed nothing really stood out  no favorites back to   and just ended trying little bit everything  Which almost IMPOSSIBLE do   Remember those cute individual platings? TERRIBLE IDEA! Sometimes would only want bite two but because take entire serving ended stack lil plates pots table  felt super wasteful but couldn't bear eat entire serving because didn't all much    Plus those small serving plates avoid piling different things buffet creating more necessary trips back forth  then just end getting full before your money's worth  Boo!  The meats little dry WHAT   no crab legs?? Instead some kinda peeled crab I THINK some butter sauce  course wouldn't really know because nothing LABELED  But regardless rubbery weird tasteless  favorite thing shrimp cocktail juicy plump   but served tiny plates 2 shrimp apiece \ Whyyyyyyyyy life difficult??  My favorite part buffets always dessert bar  Again everything looks stunning  Miniature works art  Although looking individual unique many dessert similar form   custard base fruit gel  Nothing spectacular  also chocolate covered strawberries which liked but favorite gelato  salted peanut flavor top pick   Service also slow side  took waiter 30 minutes before coffee came out  then already fell asleep mediocre food _ Pretty face but lacking quality substance  <EOR> Personally best buffets vegas  Ambiance great staff friendly accomodating  food excites guess its present food should say its plated  I love desserts colorful playful tasted good! <EOR> Great Vegas buffet!!  Pretty affordable quality tasting food! Sunday brunch $23 dollars  selection good just enough variety without being overwhelming  dessert bar display beautiful anddd gelato! Except no hazelnut flavor = 1 points them but still lots sweets choose The interior buffet pretty cool  don't know describe design inside since kind different unique also kind random but pretty fancy such affordable buffet    This buffet outstandingly exceptional however don't expect find fancy exotic cuisine here  But find all your main dishes prepared quite well  favorite dishes orrechiette pasta absolutely amazing!   I'd say buffet falls line Bellagio buffet  Definitely worth try! <EOR> Excellent presentation ate little everything   but everything seemed taste bland no didn't partying anything night before  I guess presentation raised expectations   Everything neatly portioned looked delicious pork belly sandwich gelato  Service good  just wish more flavor present food     <EOR> I always said anti buffet   Until now   This place amazing   Beautiful decor  Great variety portions food  And extremely reasonable prices   I didn't think buffet could exist!  Believe reviews definitely worth checking out   And most importantly definitely worth your money  <EOR> I wasn't born silver spoon mouth but spot feel was! Endless options high quality ingredients attentive prompt waiter service   $29 dinner tax   Try lamb parmesan crust tits! dessert salty peanut ice cream top notch! Even complimentary aqua health sparkling water made meal remember! <EOR> I'd say ok   Yes see they're trying different other buffet offering dishes smaller portions yes give them   the presentation dishes amazing especially dessert section! but   i just wasn't blown away   = The pros salads amazing   the miso shrimp salad   i seconds!! delicious!! Husband doesn't eat much salad   but came back plate full different salads  asian section buffet some pretty good entrees   dessert selection pretty vast   chocolate covered strawberries fudge cookies course gelato bar buffet can't without    The cons Some dishes no placards didn't really know getting   fish dishes overcooked  ham hock mac n cheese   the mac completely undercooked tasted raw dough! disgusting!   Bottom line Maybe need more time   would back again give second chance! <EOR> This best buffets Strip   came Sunday brunch because brunch glutton   Since fairly new place still really clean sleek   line tad before noon still really short   walked around scope place   area Asian foods carving station breakfast area two islands side buffet salad cheese bar dessert bar   love many dishes served small dishes   shrimp cocktails dish 2 shrimps but really good bad no crab legs   Also prime rib delish!  really juicy different kinds condiments choose chose chimichurri   also loved chocolate dipped strawberries gelato dessert area   only disappointment server wasn't really timely taking away plates   Other definitely buffet worth your money  <EOR> At least buffet visit requirement mine each time hit Vegas   The line buffet Aria long yelped nearby places found place Cosmo which next door  Pass Red Black heel take some photos  bam you're there   pretty good find  19$ lunch long wait  Most dishes served tapa style small little plates small pans  concept because A doesnt allow put much your plate sitting B all food doesnt touch each other   Dont kid yourself though end overeating food really good  made quality ingredients  gelato probably best Ive buffet     Only pet peeve dont label half dishes dont know your getting end asking them which pain when your hungry  <EOR> I think buffet going those love hate relationships    On hand food pretty good  Definitely par food M buffet  Plus didn't waste time getting messy trying crab shell because already done me  Something haven' found any other buffet   Also unlike M wait isn't 3 4 hours   They also offer lot desserts other buffets don't  Chocolate covered strawberries  Chocolate covered apples [but wish caramel covered]  Crepes  Peanut butter jelly gelato  Salted peanut gelato  Cute litle mini chocolate cones filled pudding     On other hand thing hate most place [seems  thing most people love place] fact most dishes served individual plates little pots  most buffets only desserts such cake pie served individual platters    Why hate this? Simply put can't fit much plate  When buffets plan action usually little bit lot food kind feel place out  Which definitely something couldn't here  only grab 3 small plates time  Which means your table more often  guess could construed good thing provides little more exercise negate some thousands calories consumed end meal  BUT chill table whomever else am enjoy food without having pause conversation more food every five minutes    Lastly gotten used free unlimited beer wine cider offered M  disappointed fact buffet did offer same  But could just being spoiled  =p  So said definitely love hate relationship  But think leaning more towards hate side    Would back? Probably  Would rather M? Probably  <EOR> Excerpted longer post experience Grand Opening Weekend  read full thing see pictures check blog!

He can't carry few around just case?    Then while later he returned other refills   Then bothering take any empty plates while he there   Then coming back taking couple them   All while he bordering friendly but really   Now dessert he starts asking did good job  did all good time    Hmmm must near tip time   responded mumbles silence but didn't stop asking couple more times ended meal   dirty plates still stacked table well except ones constantly moved ourselves other empty tables   We would usually tip around $2 $3 each $35 buffet but none wanted tip Tony anything   decided $1 each left book fold not sure if  name but thing where you'd normally place your credit card when time pay    Tony came around again time telling he done good job   He'd keep returning never asking if anyone wanted more coffee anything never removing plates   Each time he came he'd eye book fold just dying see tip   Finally he couldn't contain himself any longer he grabbed book fold pretended checking something receipts inside then counted $6 tip   He then said  all you? gave disgusted look stormed off   OMG!  wanted remove $5 bill but ended leaving it   Moral story Never ever let Tony your server until he's sent training course  <EOR> Came fabulous Jessica Y  see review below    First off  I totally understood why no wait Saturday night  place located really random section hotel  Maybe people lost trying find buffet? Dinner $27 99 which little cheaper say Bellagio Wynn  The first thing noticed swanky interior  matches hotel everything very modern   I knocked off star food selection  really thought enough options  usually Bellagio Wynn buffet usually come back FULL plate every time  Wicked Spoon   I kept staring everything just thought    meh  They give little pots pans instead letting scoop things until realize 3 little pots pans your plate no room anything else  Those suckers take space slide around your plate   I knocked off another star cause food got   I didn't like  I buffets mix familiar gourmet   but place tried all fancy schmancy failed making food taste good  pizzas particularly looked really flat unappetizing   I knocked off another star desserts  am girl desserts mean everything when comes meals  No matter full am always FULL plate desserts  All stuff though just so    safe boring repetitive  Chocolate covered strawberry apple  Ice cream  few cakes  boring  lame   In all years coming Vegas ate least here  couldn't find anything dessert area made sad  <EOR> Might because still feeling sick throwing Denny's couple nights earlier but little disappointed Wicked Spoon     I into feeling pretty excited try whole new Vegas buffet but didn't prime rib raw sushi accustomed Bellagio Wynn buffets   They decent selection food but pretty much all hit or miss   Good dessert selection but don't come buffet desserts  <EOR> I try it   tired M except really cider when serve wine glass wanted brother first family try Cosmo buffet since parents already hit M years before he could visit again    We Sunday night line nonexistent price reasonable ambiance great   server fantabulous attentive sense humor super fast drink requests refills   He gave Eric R  three sprite refills time since he unusually thirsty soda something he never drinks   iced tea good definitely brewed Lipton   sort oolong ish   only reason gave 2 stars instead one   Yes plates awkward   fit 3 4 items time clunky sliding everywhere   told he only clear person's mess time which slows down progress   worst lack signage   Personally don't put bunch food mouth no distinguishing characteristics   heck half dishes?!  honestly no idea   wasn't mood omelette everything control   The shrimp crab fingers served pairs already sauce   yuk   Almost every dish could find labeled pork except carving station stuff   Pasta shrimp dishes creamed corn name pork infested   limited options didn't enjoy much except make your own noodle bowl station end buffet   The desserts worse nothing labeled except gelato   didn't know hot pink goo purple fudge looking stuff didn't any that   asked why food wasn't labeled   He said lots people ask management aware but signage delayed order  would hope Cosmo its own printer   Oh well   coming back here  <EOR> The location Wicked Spoon bit off away everything depending your whereabouts hotel   meats selection decadent although only tried New York strip steak    The rotisserie looked delicious but didn't want deal possibility dry chicken cuz absolutely hate that    Salads pasta selection great  curious thing many lamb dishes had    Overall potions greatly sized even meats cut good portion  desserts die for crunch chocolate covered strawberries both white milk chocolate macaroons not good egg custard pineapple sauce gelato very flavorful melted your mouth way should I would come again but then again big buffets  <EOR> Dear Chef please keep doing you're doing now   Don't succumb bad reviews   they missing point   This far BEST Vegas buffet ever to   THE BEST! For $29 tax included eat pretty fancy restaurant buffet style   food presentation awesome   variety unparalleled unique   some place would love take parents don't eat buffets very often because feel gross end   Seriously where else all you can eat polenta creamed corn creamed spinach potatoes cheese bacon bone marrow lamb fresh berries grapefruit pomelo those Chinese sticky rice tamale things awesome deserts my tiny key lime pie lightly dusted green limey powder topped some kind red jelly gold flake under $30 Vegas?    If want volume stereotypical food everywhere around world place you   But if want feel human instead pig end your buffet experience then place go   [VISIT Jan 30 2011 dinner] <EOR> First off let say lunch weekday  December 28th 2010 exact  cost $19  decor buffet amazing  almost feel you're fancy shmanzy restaurant  also thought pretty cool serve most food individual trays  don't scoop into your plate  Although cool definitely doesn't allow take lot food back your table plate   So why 2 stars? Cuz food disappointing  mostly pastas  No roast beef prime rib crab legs  would think would least menu if you're paying $19  just remember eating lot dim sum some cheesy potato dish some pasta dish can't remember   Maybe try place dinner see if better before writing place off  <EOR> I actually better expectations place since awesome new casino   1 star = individual servings no need scoop anything out 2 stars = superb customer service waitress waitresses ensure everything need  3 stars = little variety majority everything ate tasted good   It lacks 4th 5th star because wasn't enough variety   just right amount think buffet definitely worth trying   need add little flare menu though   come back 6 months maybe see if any changes   Good thing wait!  thing should add better seafood selection some crab legs fresh raw oysters clams! <EOR> Loved place! Definitely Top 5 favorite buffets  long walk but enjoyed different types artwork took lot pictures wasn't boring  personally loved little pots things served some food in  something different didn't mind making few extra trips load plate  favorite selection mashed potatoes  appearance wasn't anything special but could taste difference  Service okay bad great  desserts weren't very appealing first because really full but chocolate covered strawberries plus  Kind looked creepy because little crunchy dotty things them apples but tasted great nonetheless  <EOR> I took husband part pre Birthday celebration     thought would cool  felt bad because he couldn't really find anything eat  He really simple tastes he said over top him  pizza which favorites but no pepperoni pizza just Chicken Parmesan  He tried sandwich but didn't plain mustard just spicy  He tried salads he wasn't happy either    I back try find something While stuffing face Kalbi  Yum   Kalbi good! also some pretty succulent lamb  tasted Crab butter sauce but didn't   awesome Truffled Mashed Potatoes Brussell Sprouts bacon delicious  don't know if heavy sauces creams use but full pretty quickly  disappointed fact could taken husband Palace Station Buffet he would happier!   The dessert okay but some isn't edible just looks  Pink Cheeto looking things just shaped sugar no taste  only happy Chocolate Covered Strawberries  know want food look stylish but think should also taste good! don't thinks impossible    The Palms used very cute mini pastries looked cool very tasty!   The food may feel bloated tired  If plan eating would suggest just making your meal day  <EOR> Ahh Cosmopolitan over top   your buffet   walk buffet long strange location   feels walking 2 miles before reach it   However didn't stop going    TWICE   Thursday night dinner paid $27 good but some items stale  dim sum atrocious crab   Its nice crab shelled but shieeeeeeet   dry rubbery  Sushi alright liked sushi chef making sushi right next station   Thumbs having mac cheese station    AMAZING!  would say best items pastas salads   deserts pretty but tasted okay     The second visit buffet lot better   paid $23 Saturday brunch   Ahhh breakfast foods   delish  die hash browns die chicken sausage die Guinness pancakes   yup said Guinness pancakes  YUMMMY! Everything Saturday fresh tasty   selection almost identical dinner minus breakfast items lack crab   Overall think better buffets strip   Although sucks waiting line  would suggest going weekend   More people= more food= food doesn't sit long periods time  <EOR> Ok first ofa ll say tried whole lot buffet Vegas far favorite  Why ask? Well am big eater actually hates buffet concept pilling your food same plate  also tend lose interest when buffet selection way much  shopping shoes yes nice huge selection but if crappy why even bother right  Which brings point why concept small individual plates very appealing buffet such Wicked Spoon  delicious tender meat chinese section surprisingly good greasy bread selection also yummy hard  lastly dessert maybe small scale compare Wynn but scrumptious different  Did mention servers attentive  oh tea gourmet some lipton grocery brand  All all would definitely come back next time Vegas   PS  also love decor bottled water serve  <EOR> This better buffets Las Vegas   once dinner twice breakfast early January 2011   Dinner featured surprising items pieces dungeness king crab already shell ready eat   Very good variety lots Asian menu items   deserts including gelato exceptional   Service very professional courteous   Drink refills little slow because bring whole new cup glass instead doing refills   same requests ketchup hot sauce etc  they put bottles table choosing pour small amounts small serving dish which takes longer your server   buffet also features many items small plates which cleaner more sanitary buffet  I don't recall exact prices but cheaper thank Wynn Aria Bellagio   Less $30 dinner less $20 breakfast brunch  <EOR> This place's idea individual portions pretty awesome  definitely more attention paid actual food would other buffets  Service nice although became bit Waldo when wanted ask some Sprite later meal  New York Steak really good buffet really enjoyed miso shrimp salad  want come back try dinner came during brunch! <EOR> Past giant shoes ring dogs deep within depths 2nd level Cosmo you'll find Wicked Spoon   don't know Deutsche Bank thinking when designed place everything seems hidden but definitely worth adventure here     Got pretty good deal since came bit before 11 only paid breakfast price $17 99 able all lunch stuff   But would paid lunch price since  when dessert section opens   Holy shit  nice spread worth it   I buffet because although lacks variety quality food amazing   Alot food already prepared servings you're guessing much take   But most buffets always great when new   Let's see if keep up  <EOR> So back another round   specifically asked Josie server of course!    There definitely some changes buffet   the selections somewhat different nice surprise!   didn't Lamb Osso Bucco which sorely disappointed but certainly other things compensate loss   like crab claws! YUM!  Josie again fantastic   and brought parents grandmother along time! She super attentive made sure always everything needed  Josie even impressed father hard please  LOL   We also met Alex manager Wicked Spoon   great guy very friendly  He certainly great buffet proud of   and great team servers!

Other things would eat prime ribs shrimp salad seared salmon some kind sauce forgot name but good!   I just can't think cons place far  would definitely back again  Oh maybe cons servers bright constantly getting some drinks didn't order probably another table getting refills drink  even half empty yet but getting refills drink empty 30 mins ago  Also guy prime rib station  eh  only say he was  nervous? Anyways  food atmosphere good enough reasons come back  <EOR> I visited Wicked Spoon Buffet few times past week   say food atmosphere great!  wasn't quite sure would pull off single servings buffet but worked beautifully!  buffet right Bellagio Buffet   only reason giving five stars because experienced sub par service few visits   Specifically having wait far long drinks   If would speed drink service would easily offer five stars  <EOR> Let first state even though fat chick am fan buffets  I find them common over done nothing really new    So finding myself stuck Cosmo HP CES Press conference son starving decided buffet late lunch    I really wasn't expecting much because afore mentioned aversion buffets lateness afternoon almost 2pm It's nice even age 55 surprised   walked right great seat   busy but overly crowded   waiter right take drink orders let know stations available  Having survived 2nd day CES rewarded myself mid day cocktail Mombo Italiano  hand crafted Bloody mary infused garlic vodka  I'd back JUST drink 12 00 each    Here sets particular buffet apart They all watching your weight portioned containers very interesting food   little signs say many calories many carbs per portion   Brilliant marketing since many fail recognize fabulous curves   Mac bleu cheese  yum wild rice lamb goat cheese     The carving stations   yes multiple   could dive head first into Asian style bbq pork   melt your mouth     The staff friendly made suggestions favorites     I say writing realizing best part 2x staff   food selections twist portioned servings    also made exercise walk back another serving    knowing 220 calories each     I did save room dessert wide selection indeed   Rice Crispy treats dipped chocolate? yummo     Living Vegas only town guests work anywhere near strip but last week no company no clients opted actually Wicked Spoon lunch   If nothing else Vegas local says lot  <EOR> With ability eat over 5000 calories day gain pound am no stranger buffet   slightly disappointed selection Wicked Spoon  Albeit great price 15 dollars still missed mark   must admit being bit picky  try eat gluten dairy but rarely any issue vegas  Right now staring coffee black because no dairy substitutes  Everything full gluten dairy  Even hash browns smothered cheese  2 plates egg whites fruit does satisfying meal me  Healthy yes but splurge food expects buffet let alone Vegas not  say fruit real fresh food looked good even if couldn't eat it  <EOR> Great surprise buffet large selection great desert options   Highly recommend <EOR> This place really really good  fan small plates   only major complaint  Everything else delicious  officially discovered French macarons fan  Big time  Purple cookies  would've known  love lamb lots it  stuck osso bucco leg lamb couldn't resist short ribs well  service pretty good too  server took time know chit chat  requested lots drinks she brought them two time  Loved that  If only all drink beer wine  <EOR> I agree other reviewers hike hotel entrance there's nothing between but once pretty dang tasty  Obviously buffet ambiance kind sucks but huge selection people watching worth admission price  sat directly across seafood area  Let's just say human body ingest lot more crab claws though possible  cheap $27 person dinner but high quality food huge quantities  <EOR> The food place really good   stopped long opened sure quality control extremely stringent   wait staff attentive very friendly   dining area large plates all very gourmet small plate style    came brunch   Bottomless mimosa available ten dollars more   Every dish tasty for buffet caliber foods single disappointed me   still think Wynn favorite but strong contender  <EOR> We did buffet breakfast   only real complaint hard find joint   walked seemed forever through halls filled artsy gigantic high healed shoes that kinda cute actually    Finally reached destination   Overall experience enjoyable   waitress wonderful   She friendly extremely attentive   drinks kept coming soon plate empty she take away     I liked bottled water table no additional charge   very nice touch   thought coffee pretty good orange juice fresh sweet   As food available did individual portions available   personal favorite eggs benedict bacon buffet actually crisp!  hate undercooked soggy stuff  all clumped together!  sweet breakfast items tasty too   tried some cherry danish thought blueberry muffin top   YUM  <EOR> So huge buffet person bc although eat lot can't stuff face much sitting don't mix lots genres once   that being SAID   I absolutely loved place   went twice week once lunch just cause walking nearby once weekend brunch  Both days pretty similar  liked did feel cafeteria old country bufffet  decor great very contemporary including food  liked individual portions plated into little skillets cast iron pots  variety beef short rib entrees amazing considering  favorite dishes! sushi blah lots interesting delicious plates   Dessert great even gelato sorbet  Overall very highly recommended! <EOR> Best  Buffet  Ever!!!!

I've heard though buffet better weekends weekdays Saturday night buffet dinner did disappoint    There's macaroni bar hand roll sushi chef great dessert selection fudge chocolate covered strawberries ice creams! all usual seafoods sushi carved meats food great ambiance fun too   I large birthday party group apparently reservations large parties? placed separate room which really cool made meal feel less buffety   managers Adam really great taking care birthday cake chef fixed icing the cake slid around inside box while walked parking lot buffet cut cake then boxed extra pieces  really  great personal service didn't really expect buffet but would definitely come back service food    I don't know if pricing low compete bigger names Wynn Bellagio buffet but right now Cosmo Buffet favorite strip great price!! <EOR> Uninspired   best way describe Wicked Spoon Buffet  husband giddy since just dropped kids off school Valentines Day breakfast Wicked Spoon Buffet  dining room pretty cool done browns very modern West Elm kinda way  hubby did snide remark female Wait Staff uniform  strange brown ginghamy wrinkled shirt dress type deal all flattering   The breakfast spread cool small individual servings items 3 kinds benedicts smoothies yogurt parfaits  presentation only great thing place  benedicts though made small batches hard biscuits base dry tough ham sauces quickly congealed making them very unappetizing  Hubby unable eat respective benedicts  red velvet pancakes     Babycakes don't even break sweat    just dried red colored pancakes dried cream cheese drizzled on  omelet station some great fresh looking savory fillings but avocado topping placed mine weird tangy taste ruined me!  Wait staff nice enough but slow took time clearing plates refilling water serve water glass bottles  sure refill them but least access water while take time working room!   The plu$$es Great breads especially tangy sourdough!  Good granola  Walnut French Toast  Omelet Station just no avocado pleeze!  Individual cereal boxes    some good kinds just Raisin Bran!   $15 dollars weekday breakfast   bad   least say tried place  <EOR> Came friday night around 5 pm early dinner no lines  party seated immediately which great! thing caught attention buffet presentation dishes  Most if all dishes served individual platters  thought ingenious idea help minimize wasting food  Another thing loved buffet dessert section!! Mini candy apples? Need say more? Every dessert tasted incredibly good  Only thing though seemed short staff because took while any waiter waitresses attention pretty busy  only reason why gave place four star otherwise would've easily five star  highly recommend place anyone pays vegas visit! <EOR> Fan freaking tastic!  Food fresher 95% all buffets tapa style take away portions ingenious ideas keep food more sanitary   dare say gourmet buffet  <EOR> My boyfriend aren't your traditional Vegas types  we don't Vegas gamble strip clubs  we eat    We've eaten every restaurant Vegas every buffet  Most time always Wynn  However upon recommendation decided try Wicked Spoon    This place rocks  Bottomless mimosa brunch fantastic assortment food options  Typically Vegas buffets find chef does thing particularly well but Wicked Spoon hits all right marks  Per Se but everything expect great Las Vegas buffet more   My favorite dish pasta orecchiette? short rib mushrooms parm brown sauce  can't communicate delicious was  I back several second helpings  and still dream dish  pregnant lady late night cravings it  man  <EOR> My boyfriend visit Vegas fairly often usually skip buffets   time mood try never eaten dinner  Wicked Spoon Friday dinner  only $26 99 we loved already! When amazed individual portions   Everything looked good   decided first check everything before started shoving food onto plates   literally running around oohing aahing   2 kids grown adults candy store   The Asian food surprisingly good!  fried rice usually overlooked but really good   rolls dim sum   The ricotta spinach also something really good   creamy but also light   The consistency mashed potatoes best!  Korean need salad tasty super refreshing   even crab claws already cracked   shrimp cocktail shrimp completely peeled defined  Prefect lazy people me! I don't eat lamb but boyfriend really enjoyed chimichurri sauce   mac n cheese bar amazing!  boyfriend also loved goat cheese mac n cheese   The dessert impressive   even desserts served real painted eggshells   Very creative   chocolate covered apples favorite!  Oh!  service impeccable!  Everyone really nice helpful  <EOR> 0 stars    Over past holiday weekend stopped Cosmopolitan check before heading Buffet Bellagio  found buffet casino resort decided try out  don't understand why people stating difficult find when really if read signs lead 2nd floor    Anyways arrive entrance buffet lady standing stating letting any more people in  WTH?! When does buffet reject people entry???? willing wait 1 2 hrs try buffet but didn't even chance stand line  line wasn't even ridiculously long  lost business day only but other people willing wait line see buffet offer   I back April time hopefully able write real review dishes    If you're wondering where ended eating back Buffet Bellagio    where waited hr  <EOR> I love buffet! dessert station simply amazing  If sweet tooth your paradise  huge selection gelatos ice cream pastries chocolate etc  food really good too  Brunch until 3pm leave all breakfast items eat scrambled eggs egg whites sausage pancakes bacon etc  price isn't bad either  wait time bit long weekend worth it! <EOR> With free room offer thrown way meant only thing  more money entertainment which means food gambling old married couples   Gambling minus side but fortunately think food tried latest Vegas trip plus side   First off new Cosmopolitan hotel absolutely gorgeous stunning  Unlike commercials won't see random cute animals running catchy music background but if appreciate abstract art you'll feel right home  Much chic decor definitely influenced buffet    It's probably most beautifully decorated buffets ever seen  somebody grew Circus Circus buffets kid  come long way shed tear   came dinner around 5pm Friday night while small line pretty fast  Soon enough seated table   As may heard read things little differently here  Some dishes served small porcelain cups trays stainless steel pots miniature pans  think great idea keep freshness integrity food  such braised beef short ribs  While bit rich salty side thought dish rivaled many high end restaurants   Other favorites mine include prime rib fish and    wait vegetables  Sometimes buffets overboard fancy dishes but buffet executes veggies  green beans brussel sprouts gasp   dessert station fantastic  liked stacked squares fudge various mini cakes tarts  favorite gelato station where tell good quality   But wasn't without some misses however  supposed crab dish pretty disgusting  Rubbery chewy pale looking masses meat quite sure type crab  maybe some mutant crab lived depths sea  meat taken its shell sauteed sauce  No matter bland anyway    You won't find any long dangling king crab legs you're used seeing other Vegas buffets  mini pre shelled crab claws served small trays come dab cocktail sauce wedge lemon  okay but might need few dozen just your crab fix    In end pretty satisfied $27 worth dinner  Service excellent leave bottle cold water your table don't keep asking it  entire time while dining atmosphere just seemed restaurant just another typical messy buffet Vegas  <EOR> there's saying korea 10 years move mountains rivers but seems 1 year enough change vegas  since last visit back late 2009 many new hotels recently added city's directory always trying outdo another  hubby informed hip ritzy stylish new additions now must's vegas cosmopolitan being them  fact way vegas sis on way back vegas! told new fascination wicked spoon buffet cosmopolitan  normally despise buffet but moment sister said ice cream station knew sold    after good night sleep woke 8am mapped itinerary day evolved around two feasts  exercised vigorously see review encore's fitness center below walked mile cosmopolitan hotel before reached buffet  10 30am saturday morning no line dining hall crowded    there standard breakfast items hard brick waffles soggy pancakes made order omelets fresh fruits miniature boxed cereals assortment breads edible yogurt along carving station ny steak some sausage some pork part other protein thing cold seafood section smoked salmon shrimp cocktail italian food pizza pasta ravioli stuff asian food section sushi dumplings korean kalbi     obviously didn't bother inspect meat station much but sure frequented seafood asian food stations multiple times  smoked salmon surprisingly fresh tasty  also liked shrimp dumplings although skin bit dried  however kalbi worse while overly sweet burnt flavors    the show stopper wicked spoon buffet dessert station specifically ice cream bar 14 16 different flavors  tackled small scoops pistachio strawberry amaretto oreo cookie tiramisu all seemed decent although little sweet me  decadent dessert offerings such mini madeline cookies french macarons which sadly did live expectations  usuals such chocolate covered strawberries apples good but again great    many food served individual sized pots cups dishes probably reduce waste keep food fresh lines moved really fast stations kept clean  overall look dining space modern comfortable some big tables accommodate large parties    the waitresses wear some gloomy tacky brown plaid shirt dresses which literally made feel depressed look them but some hardest working bunch  hubby felt bad other tables left no tip other route left them generous amount    by now should know expect buffet   mediocre food high price tag looking 5 month pregnant! long don't compare food your favorite sushi steak pizza joint authentic home cooked meal wicked spoon buffet might satisfy your edacious nature  actually $25 brunch buffet vegas bad deal all  <EOR> I can't lie overhyped place mind checking reviews yelp   bone marrow roast lamb sold   Guinness pancakes just kicker   ON!  However Saturday brunch neither lamb nor marrow available hour guy behind counter said don't Guinness pancakes   crushed   That said food just fine just wasn't hoped   variety foods impressive but say selection within each food genre seemed kinda slim   favorite dishes prime rib y thing kielbasa   For dessert others mentioned look good but no signs suggest each item is   mighty full time hit dessert bar while quite impressed presentations statyed away fro most ht pretty looking unknown treats   plate berries lemon gelato which just light enough dessert   I also mention bottomless mimosas meal   two mimosas then moved bloody Marys   bloody Marys much better mimosas   The ambiance much nicer those Rio World Buffet M Resort's Studio B buffet but say preferred food both Rio M over Cosmo's Wicked Spoon   One final note   large group 16 people   manager kind enough allow two line while rest group gathered most late night    pair reached front line gave 15 minutes gather group then let all right reserving pair cashiers let all pay individually   seating initial response waitress seemed kind annoyed b*tchy but figured everything drink orders not staff extremely helpful friendly   can't say blame them being initially annoyed confusion   It good experience food good   But would sure check food list before coming honestly think more inclined check some other buffets returning Studio B before coming back Wicked Spoon  <EOR> My husband wanted seafood buffet Rio but decided because people giving reviews Yelp   decided try Wicked Spoon new hotel Cosmopolitian   First off let say favorite hotel Vegas   So pretty!!!  The buffet different other buffets   know buffet see then scoop much want your plate   by time your table plate full whole buffet all smooched together   place different   give individual portions most dishes   give cute little pots   Sometimes give cute little plates   Its very elegent   also prevents over stuffing yourself quickly   here slowly   hhahaha  The food very good   steak top some pesto some seasoned cucumbers   Oh awesome very tasty   korean BBQ short ribs freakin good   just come off grill its tender juicy     The only thing disappointment didn't crab legs   I kind looking forward those   But crab claws cocktail sauce   But felt grab 10 plates those little things     Their dessert also good   typical cakes different flavors gelato   They don't really big buffets other buffets vegas   smaller variety   but when something usually pretty good   Less variety great quality   It's interesting experience   If come Vegas   make sure try buffet  <EOR> Good place eat food very good  your traditional buffet may seem bit turn off some  don't traditional mac n' cheese spaghetti etc  but quality ingredients taste all there  must check out  <EOR> This new fav Vegas buffet spot     What place overpriced Wynn Bellagio   $27 dinner Sunday great Vegas steal quality selections Wicked Spoon had   I portion certain items into small miniature pot fits your plate   way don't over scoop something onto your plate might like   Also way save stomach sample all items without going full quick   The service really good servers sure your table doesn't fill dirty plates    Even though place made great impression   I give Wicked Spoon 5 stars Chocolate Cookies alone   OMG good! <EOR> Eat if cutely portioned food then sexiness hotel exudes  newest hotels strip Cosmopolitan just screams COOL buffet trailing far behind  guarantee you'll leave place feeling DOUBLE O SEVEN suave despite just having gorged feast prime rib chocolate covered strawberries   While always remain loyal The Buffet Bellagio a go to every Vegas trips refreshing damn awesome and did mention sexy? alternative  <EOR> I'm usually very critcal when comes buffets because if going put down many calories better worth it! Wicked Spoon worth it!  Hubs visited Wicked Spoon Saturday around 10am could little breakfast but also little bit lunch menu breakfast prices   Honestly buffet large but quality entrees superb  love lot main dishes served own little dish  Its new favorite buffet Vegas   and hubs them all point another   However desserts Wynn buffet still better! <EOR> Ive hearing lot hype place course try when Vegas last week  brunch $23 bucks which relatively cheap compared other buffets    There group 8 waited 30 minutes line seated  really concept place   how prepare some dishes little pots pans  food pretty good but spectacular wasn't blown away  definitely best buffet Ive ever Vegas  quality food somewhat mediocre  really liked dessert station though   they really pretty cute desserts but again nothing spectacular    Maybe place better dinner   i don't know but don't think I'd again  <EOR> Swanky bougie beautiful yummy pretty much describes Cosmopolitan when first stepped foot hotel coincidently words describe Wicked Spoon buffet well!

OH MYYYY! absolute favorite part lunch! Gelato milk white chocolate covered strawberries mini apples macaroons cute little cups filled cakes alll YUMMMY   and aphrodisiacs ]  lunch definitely entertained eyes tummy   Sadly aside all glitz beauty all knocks off star would lack SEAFOOD during lunch  fish? Salmon? Oysters? Crab legs?? probably all available during dinner but wish em' lunch!! Nonetheless even though wasn't tooo big buffet I'd experience Wicked Spoon again price $19! You'll most definitely eating your eyes here  <EOR> Aesthetically place amazing  decor presentation food even hotel itself beautiful  might've over hyped place usually since tired grumpy most likely hungover but thought food decent especially its price 23$ love breakfast overwhelmed when saw such nice variety brunch spread  place lot potential perfect but food bit cold some stale really killed whole experience awful macarons were  love macarons  <EOR> I'm big fan buffets because eat mouse  just waste  But friend try place because all glowing reviews!  Sunday buffet $23  no line seated immediately   It took 15 minutes sat down 1st place someone asked drink order including water  But service better drinks  think more staff starting work    The food okay  lot variety traditional breakfast eggs bacon pancakes more ethnic varieties tacos sushi dimsum pasta  But nothing stood except ham pastries  ham moist cooked perfectly  pastries flaky tasty    Also disorganized  Staff couldn't tell if people still eating if left  cleared neighbor's table gave another party only find original party still eating now no place sit! original party polite situation agreed sit somewhere else  <EOR> Custom Mac cheese great pad thai pizza every dessert tried all delicious   return  <EOR> There no line! Dined 7 15p Thursday  $27 dinner $29 tax  Very friendly service  seated right entrance everyone coming see but whatever  waiting friend anyways made easy find us   Nicely decorated large dining area  easy around  Start left appetizers salads work your way right ending vast array fudge other decadent sweets   It very nice most items individually portioned  But even small portions didn't actually finish any dishes because wanted sure could try everything  crab claws already opened little saucers cocktail sauce nice touch! salads fantastic  breads great  kobe beef shoulder yum! Also truffle scalloped potato delicious! select few items did care but don't even remember it  read notes someone mentioned braised short ribs expected tender flavorful!  I didn't try much pizza pasta asian section  save room desserts!

YUMMY!  And then crepes which didn't chance try  Cookies really good  Strongly alcoholic tiramisu cups  Other sweets sweet  Overall though great place nice selection  close second Wynn Buffet IMO but price might come more often   Our server can't remember name but she very sweet everyone worked together sure enough room table new plates eat very quickly create ton dishes  Good job   One thing buffet such long walk rest restaurants  If escalator elevator chandelier gotta walk through long hallway passing 2 large high heel shoes another quiet hall finally reach buffet end  But note if only coming buffet park west elevator take escalator right instead walking all way through casino back around upstairs  <EOR> For price buffet alright  assortment mediocre food  buffet smaller other buffets Vegas no overlapping lunch dinner  They're closed 3 5 pm basically if lunch also breakfast  around 2 pm Saturday 1 4 food breakfast foods    The nicest thing buffet is price service presentation  Don't come lunch come dinner  hear dinner good  <EOR> Vegas new best buffet $5 99 off strip buffets $39 99 strip buffets move way let Wicked Spoon claim its spot cream crop   What place winner?

OH awesome Gelato selection! believe 14 different flavors try $26 its comparable most other buffets but looks lot better I'd probably still come back! Dinner only $1 more $27  <EOR> Great desserts! Water very tasty  sushi probably worst ever had  Rest food really good especially salads!! Great assortment! server awesome  <EOR> I didn't hype   Maybe off weekend but wasn't some hour long wait 11am nor food mind blowing impressive buffet   kept hearing amazing things Wicked Spoon Bellagio   admit Bloody Mary bar quite impressive all various types picked veggies   also red velvet pancakes!  However food itself failed par better gourmet buffets Vegas   wish Wynn Bellagio instead   Orange juice tasted concentrated mehhh     The best thing ate though prime rib   perfect medium rare very flavorful   All little clad iron pots serve everything adorable cute concept but cute doesn't mean tasty   did want grab every pot saw but when tasted food just wasn't impressive   think just stick w Wynn Bellagio next time  <EOR> for $26 lunch brunch really worth it   I'd say though i'd come more experience then food   presentation food lot better tastes   But compared all vegas buffets good enough come back $26   stuff liked omlette station lets your own choose egg whites only healthier choice    Mac n' cheese good cheesy oh try pork belly white bun sandwich probably best very asian authentic tasting miso shirmp salad light delicious too!  the DESSERTS best part buffet all miniature sized tasty   silver egg panna cotta chocolate dipped apples strawberries Gelato best ! super smooth creamy  <EOR> Based all positive yelp reviews family came few days ago say best buffet ever uh lot  major standout desserts which usually weakest part buffet tarts fresh berries especially raspberries just fabulous!
