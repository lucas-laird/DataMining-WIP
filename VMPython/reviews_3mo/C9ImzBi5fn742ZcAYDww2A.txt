Apparently word around 10 AM Saturday 20 minute wait two    The decor absolutely adorable hanging flowers all over place wait staff wears really cute pajamas love it!   The food tried all very good  husband blueberry french toast strudel   slice delicious casserole  If you're mood  sweet but disgustingly recommend this! also tried chicken waffles which good especially if haven't Roscoe's  much much better HHAGG point best Vegas  big chicken breast instead fried chicken which did much easier eat  waffle pretty boring but well executed  chicken touch spicy whole thing served cinnamon syrup  would again but can't say crave worthy    Biggest bummer place service disaster  Drinks late forgotten pot bread supposed served prior meal brought etc etc  all seemed very rushed stressed out  Given brand new place pass but would hope service improves future!   It's no Babycakes but does hold its' own  sea breakfast spots every corner place deserves spot anyone's short list   <EOR> Service very friendly  cheesequila steak great breakfast combo  Lots gluten free options but still pancakes toast if want traditional breakfast stuff  <EOR> This place good bad but great still favorite spots breakfast days off which MIMI'S  live Southern Highlands hoping place going spot when don't feel going MIMI'S but no Rise Shine if don't want drive far When busy wait 45 mins  Sunday expected didn't mind    waited outside because no place wait inside think need some chairs outside put bench people sit while wait  When called seated hostess very friendly server  But didn't when ordered glass orange juice SUCKED  customers looking especially if your eating breakfast!!!! orange sucked because diluted water save money  tasted just water color even orange looked yellow  moment saw when server brought knew something up  wasn't only person notice others too  Then ordered eat chilaquillas expecting traditional way but wrong server explained she explained thought going traditional way  But NO more tortilla chip anything else very little sauce very very little eggs two slice avocado overal sucked  If never original chilaquillas before u wouldn't know difference then guess     But think owner should call chilaquillas call Chips Egg yes said egg because only egg So overall conclude review OK better before  hope read hopefully change wrote just others breakfast! <EOR> This new favorite breakfast spot  pancakes 2 egg turkey keilbalsa wich came real maple syrup cinnamon  Great customer service very impressed presentation reasonable prices  <EOR> Very cute atmosphere especially strip mall establishment  really impressed decor attention detail all styling   flower umbrellas hanging ceiling tile framed windows made setting more whimsical industrial  waitresses all pajama style uniforms which nice added touch  Though also mention owner working cash register but didn't much effort impression customers     The food very good ordered chiliquilas steak along Belgium waffles  also French press coffee which served table timer perfect cup    So why only 3 stars?  place good but little expensive charge extra everything! fact whole column menu run down charges    But items arent really sides  unless usually eat avocado itself?  Also $4 bacon?  breakfast steak only $3 more chiliquilas themselves sure math one  Bottom line place little way nestled neighborhood strip mall could better pricing is    conclude saying place probably best left locals  <EOR> This BEST kept secret Las Vegas  Almost debated reviewing could selfish KEEP secret but good give owners props    Here all reasons place deserves MORE 5 stars  Came 10am Saturday everyone friendly  actually no wait but think more luck But still positive book  Bread Pot  Delicious cinnamon swirled bread soft buttery  Almost croissant    warm came whipped butter strawberry jam  DIE FOR!!!
