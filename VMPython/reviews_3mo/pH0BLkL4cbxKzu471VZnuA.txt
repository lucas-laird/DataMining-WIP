Dessert only puts band aid broken arm    why hell restaurant managers  this?  looking something free just want sure act together    fast!  Our original waiter rarely came table ordered food   Another waitress came aid very helpful attentive needs   She very friendly courteous unfortunate she wasn't original waiter because review would've completely different   Our unpleasant waiter did weirdest thing   friend talking manager being very open waiters horrible service waiter stood table he refolded all used napkins tossing them onto table   Yes used clothe napkins   does that?  front party pretty disgusted no less   seemed if he knew he already hot water didn't give rats ass making it   addition he circled portion bill decided discount unsatisfied service stuck negative manner   hind site friend said should taken same pen front waiter scratched tip!  course we're better that   The food only reason why place getting single star  food actually quite good variety unique asian fusion plates   ordered Chicken Teriyaki exotic right? which much more bargained for   such simple dish variety unique flavors side extras complimented each bite   friends ordered array food looked just good commented just same   For customer service break any experience no matter good food is   case service failed horribly   party ended waiter few cans short six pack regarding personality would probably fare better Chippendale's greeter restaurant waiter   hope management recognizes hires waiters actually qualified interact human beings  <EOR> On hot Vegas weekend stay bf limited dining choices Venetian Palazzo conveniently connected    stopped lunch without reservations doing any prior research except two minutes entrance perusing menu   only open three weeks staff seemed very eager bring any all people   server extremely friendly trying best comfortable answer any questions   think she Asian but she said she grew somewhere South America indiscernible accent   She made everything menu sound tasty but only looking light lunch   samba blt which yummy chunks lobster bit mayo heat applewood smoked bacon   came side fingerling potatoes sprinkling some kind cheese top which called fries menu   pickles did tart   tried everything bf's anticuchos combination bento   box usually comes chicken beef shrimp but he requested shrimp switched miso sea bass   Its sweetness best taken small quantities such skewer   liked but probably sweet some   tuna roll acceptable   incredibly dark inside which bright mall atmosphere outside all more apparent   I'd return lunch because could envision place being much noisy nightclub dinner  <EOR> This place same downtown Tokyo vibe Geisha House Los Angeles offering same dance floor bar late night switch although group didn't stay see Sugarcane Boutique Nightclub no further commentary that    This hip little eatery offers fusion Brazilian Peruvian Japanese cuisine  food interesting but opinion quite worth price tags except kobe slivers   party ordered variety dishes most which became challenge split amongst five  dish three large scallops another dish six smaller mushrooms course aforementioned kobe beef slivers  believe spent more time dividing morsels actually chewing swallowing meal  until rolls end felt hadn't really eaten anything   I wouldn't really recommend place groups although dishes tapas meant shared  Sushi Samba would probably more suitable romantic date place  lighting dim ambiance sexy dishes more ideal feed TWO adults  <EOR> it pretty easy reservation 5 friday night 8 45pm   late still seated within minutes getting there   place crowded   decor kinda crazy colorful   waitress little but didnt ruin experience much   we ordered bottle riesling even sommelier come help choose riesling less sweet   but still really sweet   dont know deal that   then ordered another bottle beer she opened another bottle wine     the portions small   sushi rolls seemed tiny me   ceviche sampler good but waitress explained them wrong   scallop mushroom robata good too   miso cod good   general portions small side  wouldnt actually call dishes fusion   menu fusion   dishes coming japan peru brazil   but dish different influences?

no wait   matters but added bonus waiter HOT!  hehe   Anyways menu lot things never heard before if you're used Brazilian Peruvian Japanese food then staff should able explain all before order   We ordered tuna ceviche shrimp ceviche appetizers see reviews below details dishes talk    Both excellent fresh decent sized portion cereal bowl full but pricey around $15 17 each   also ordered spicy tuna rolls which excellent the tuna practically melted mouths well BoBoBrazil roll which Mr  Hottie Waiter recommended slices Kobe Beef atop roll bunch good stuff didn't know sorry all food buffs!    think mix onions?  Both very good   As far cocktails would definitely recommend Chu Cucumber cocktail   think  name it   Again Mr  Hottie Waiter recommended which decided try even though didn't sound good first   surprisingly refreshing!  some sort Japanese liquor which supposedly lite Vodka flavor well Roseflower cucumber   ended having two they martini glass third having substituted original liquor Gin recommendation bartender which stronger alcohol taste it   friends tried Samba Juice cocktail which she said good tasted little sangria   Overall great atmosphere bit pricey but original food wouldn't find your regular sushi restaurant   would definitely try place least once trip Vegas!  Hopefully check lounge next time! <EOR> My friends staying Palazzo thought try Sushisamba sister's bachelorette dinner   made reservations 10 15pm upon arrival bar area dining area looked pretty full     The decor dark interesting black white classic Japanese films airing large big screen some classy art anime con another wall   friend discussion appreciated scene       Their menu features wide array items small platters appertizers large platters sushi    checked menu Palazzo website prior knew prices expect   started off bottle sake pretty extensive sake list price reasonable bottle sake     I ordered rock fish $29 prepared very elegantly also very very delicious sweet moist   let friends sample dish everyone really enjoyed it  2 friends ordered teriyaki chicken $25 wasn't your typical chicken teriyaki chicken served bone accompanied purple mashed potatoes   think probably favorite chicken teriyaki dish sampled before others agreed   Others table ordered sushi ramen fries etc   9 group impressed 3 1 person myself    appreciate good quality food thought prices reasonable Las Vegas trendy restaurant Palazzo expectable prices cuisine   Most restaurants Las Vegas Strip usually typically pricey amount food receive anyway   typically upscale restaurants   other hand other girls table complained hunger expensive   didn't agree ramen $18 worth used $5 ramen no thrills restautant   Yes only ramen but delicate lemon grass flavor decent size generally good price upscale restaurant   review offers insight 2 different perspectives   light fare but perfect going clubs after     Service superb   waiter served well friendly casual discussions periodically offered take into Sugarcane club lounge attached restaurant   Granted club lounge empty only 2 people dancing nice gesture review solely based restaurant     If appreciate upscale quality food emerges different unique chic environment try Sushisamba <EOR> I agree early reviewer Sushi Samba pretty nice date place   first time Sushi Samba back early August date tried calamari appetizer plantains tasty   big hit night though Nina Fresa cocktails chocolate fondue   absolutely fabulous!
