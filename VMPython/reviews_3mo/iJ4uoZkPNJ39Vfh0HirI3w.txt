Great location easy access downtown area     There's plenty seating when went   Clean hipsterish atmosphere     We mushroom spring rolls tonkatsu ramen spicy pork     This first time trying mushroom spring rolls good   came 4 pieces   The tonkatsu good   wasn't salty alot ramen places around town however lacked salt flavor begin with   guess don't put msg broth if made fresh?  better enough salt much salt always add it   Overall still enjoyed tonkatsu ramen      The servers very nice   owner manager I forgot he was nice enough check see liked food gave some insight restaurant works   noodles made fresh food made fresh everyday  <EOR> It's serviceable  People definitely problem  Ramen broth fine ramen noodles fine other parts fine  took over five minutes when seated someone come over order technically drink order wasn't really taken took over ten minutes sprite   ordered ramen thin noodles extra chashu  friend ordered ramen thick noodles extra spicy meat  When ramen came girl asked extra chashu? said me  She put bowl front identical front friend both dug down picked noodles  Both bowls thin noodles  decided we'd waited long whatever would just it   we'd gotten good ways discovered we'd apparently orders switched the meat bottom gotten spicy meat oh well late switch correct  Then discovered same amount chashu   When bill came realized why  extra chashu order hadn't put in  But order thick noodles which never happened had  noodles bowl blatantly cooked no care  Half them solid clump work pry apart into chunks small enough eat  Obviously noodles clump weren't properly cooked   So long wait any kind service long wait just drink order put wrong order cooked wrong order cooked apathetically best wrong orders given us   food wasn't good enough service failures   With many good ramen joints town there's really no point wasting your time money calories someplace obvious don't' care  <EOR> This place right i  Downtown Vegas around corner Fremont st! spend around $10 noodle soup comes beef chicken  don't eat meat added own topping came almost $15 ! including drink   don't know feel yet   music selection great ! whole time just wanted dance bar tender cool guy friendly toward end night good dinner cool experience   But know if come back $15 ramen soup   Maybe if substitute bee tofu no extra charge would cool <EOR> We enjoyed spot  Ramen whiskey? Can't Brotha! Unfortunately didn't know drink menu  would loved tried Japanese whiskey blend  Instead jasmine whiskey cocktail which mostly Jim beam but okay  complaining! vibe cool  Reminded spots back home San Francisco Brooklyn  Why? old school hip hop playing  Yesssss  whaaaat? jam almost every song  Yessss  ramen good  Very simple menu can't wrong  Service good  place just opened everyone seemed little green  But all good giving place 5 stars  already planning regular here  Holla! <EOR> I believe better  son says great if avoid Ramen  whiskey  Pork Dumplings dish alone worth visit   I gave 3 stars because hey ramen  Downtown  Ogden  Good start  also think better   The ramen better no ramen but forgot Chashu Pork  reminded server brought piece share no problem going fight over piece cold dry pork?  There only 5 drinks menu only 2 3 whiskey  assume just soft opening menu serve more whiskeys bar  I'd back Sugar Plum Fairy!  I'm really hoping place improves  great location love space  really think could earn 4 stars if pay more attention detail  <EOR> If downtown only ramen place guess  better nothing if want ramen  But food subpar  place very nice service ok  But place tourists people can't drive across strip ChinaTown  <EOR> A 4 5 isn't reason why hip little spot doesn't deserve 5 stars   located Ogden which Itsy Bitsy only 30 yards 9 floors below me   Proximity key hope continues excellent spot frequent when am hungry social need   quite attractive all female floor staff which easily done but combination good service personality genuine small   They need retain crew because good vibes Sat night Sun day good crowd     Ramen good but its Ramen still never imagined paying restaurant   shows much white American am if its more common then am aware of     Garlic Edamame legit   breathe hours later   not bueno   whisky list looks impressive far selection but hoping see 50 60+ year but just hope expecting fulfilled   no f'n Isabella's Islay?

Ramen noodles brilliant  Great range sushi too  <EOR> We couple weeks ago actually good  atmosphere really trendy cute although painting lamb its throat cut little weird lol  Everyone party ramen customizable  pick your broth type meat noodle type  rice bowl pork yummy   very small menu fair warning  literally only rice bowls few pseudo handrolls ramen bowls  Overall good time shout Dj she played some good music  <EOR> Itsy Bitsy definitely place returning to! food good  Absolutely loved pot stickers chicken bites    oh mint chocolate chip mochi delicious  But say service extremely pleasant  server Hanna's charm could enough distribute entire restaurant  didn't chat much other staff members but smiles enough  recommending place  <EOR> Went co workers during lunch wasn't busy seated right away  Food good pricing isn't bad  Customer service really good staff very friendly  definitely come back <EOR> Its nice Ramen place downtown  large party attentive accommodating   The ramen wasn't anything super special  small simple menu  Some party wasn't impressed didn't cocktail ordered  I didn't think bad would return  <EOR> Had solid salmon bowl here  Good chicken skewers  Cool atmosphere downtown  Probably bad drinks either  build own ramen next time  <EOR> I guess Vegas standards Itsy Bitsy's ramen gets four  Except way many ramen spots some best ramen perspective bit more skewed  ok bowl   I'm compare places Daikokuya Orenchi  Although still flavorful tonkotsu broth more watered down used pork definitely harder side   Full credit waitress putting 10 hour shift still putting max effort us! She even hooked some mochi! Definitely made trip worth us  D <EOR> I love place excited open haven't disappointed  appetizers street corn shishitos robata skewers   very good favorite Japanese whiskeys even some crazy hooch bottles China ask bartender did mention you're middle super fun downtown?  The ramen itself cannot give 5 stars good don't wrong but chashu slimy broth lacks fortitude recommend white pepper but hey we're lucky living golden age ramen bars I'd lose Yelp cred if called 5 star ramen but ANYWAY you'll probably see bar sipping Hakashu over light rocks   <EOR> Oh food whiskey space  narrow long set up  Gives feel small restaurant even though quite large  great bar large drink menu  enviorment general nice  looked very modern lots eye catching art work    Our party whiskey sake Moscow Mule  also ramen some pot stickers  tonkatsu broth rich tasty though spicy most other tonkatsu broths tried  little salty tastes but no else party seemed notice  all enjoyed meal  <EOR> This used Wild  old artwork still here  know called Itsy Bitsy Ramen Whiskey but failed trying ramen whiskey   Beef Robata Skewers Tender beef but salty  2 5  Hand Rolls You 3 4 5 hand rolls tuna salmon yellowtail wrapped nori soy paper  tried tuna salmon nori soy rolls  fish fresh but fish rice ratio impressive  server supposed ask chef if brown rice substituted white rice but she forgot  ate rolls anyway  3 5  Chashu Rice Bowl Lots veggies pork tasty  Oh underneath all pork veggies rice  3 5 5  There's very many Japanese restaurants DTLV  Actually think only aside place  nice addition DTLV but might want drive few miles better sushi skewers bowls same price  <EOR> Shiso crazy whiskey cocktail amazingly delicious  Very nice edamame  Tonkotsu broth thick noodles very nice  only complaint cha shu pork ramen far tough  Pork belly should easily tear chopsticks pick chew   price point should better jinya monta shoku ramen ya  But wasn't   Also didn't see karage chicken which favorite   But thrilled see believe only ramen bar within city limits actual incorporated city  <EOR> Hearing all new ramen restaurants Vegas thought ramen scene becoming bit bubble  However mind may changed today   I consider myself ramen lover having gone most if all previously existing places town well many outside Vegas  Some even more well traveled ramen aficionado friends invited come along could all try Itsy Bitsy first time  wary going because lack positivity prior reviews but give most places try least  Surprisingly delivered   There's plenty whiskys other libations appetizers menu but kept meal simple  ordered ramen $10 25 thick noodles miso broth  ramen comes standard green onion chashu bean sprouts half soy cured egg  declined add extras   The broth although almost overwhelmingly salty quite flavorful  dinging them because comes territory because almost unpleasant saltiness before favorite miso ramen  noodles al dente would expect any ramen restaurant  chashu pork tasty actually more porky flavor lot other places town  Bean sprouts helped fight saltiness julienne green onions provided needed contrast both flavor texture  Overall clearly second best regularly available miso ramen Vegas   I did taste some friend's tonkotsu broth both before I'd delved into own bowl less salty but also less strong flavor  sure would try next time probably skip shoyu since tends less flavorful overall  But miso something remember given highly hold esteem favorite miso ramen place four stars appropriate rating Itsy Bitsy   A few other notes keep fairly dimly lit except bar seating they're going hip vibe wasn't unopposed since music didn't quite stifle conversation  nude female torso painted walls anyone might bring kids should aware  bathroom unusual two sinks hall two lockable rooms each unisex toilet   Come miso ramen stay alcohol? Really though wouldn't necessarily way if weren't already downtown but capable option hot bowl soup neighborhood  <EOR>
