Barry burger bacon ridiculous Caramelized onions       Super yummy   Setting      Window open bar watching game bikini clad women     perfect guy gstrap shame ruining high Service spot on  I read other reviews fools trust come before always packed  <EOR> Trying Back Room Burger first time today  far DISASTER! Placed order 2 21 Barry Burger  asked server large burger he looked showing dog magic trick  He NO CLUE  He said he would ask chef  Just everyone knows 5 25 ounces  He politely took order but NEVER offered any side dish French Fries     At 2 40 notified kitchen running little slow because very busy pool  only 10 inside restaurant offered complimentary order Crispy Tortilla Chips Guacamole Chipotle Tomatillo Salsas  $9 item menu  Would recommend value  At 3 15 food arrived table  burger good but really think many other good burgers city    For inconvenience 54 minute wait took burger off bill    In conclusion let's assume service perfect server being knowledgeable menu food being prepared perfectly timely manner  LEAST DOZEN other burger joints town outshine Back Room Burger  <EOR> Not bad    best  burger place nice view Palms pool sit couple hrs people watch while having couple drinks   Came Friday afternoon around 4p when ordered food bartender he said would take 20 40 min food come because kitchen same pool restaurant  didn't mind weren't hurry anything but most people would mind would think  Maybe more cooking staff accommodate? Just thought  bar staff pretty friendly though even ordering frozen drink which know bartenders hate lol   menu little different Tex Mex burger which thought pretty tasty bf Buffalo Chicken burger which he liked well  would back! <EOR> Well nothing impressive place  would expect little better decorating being palms  hostess seemed new kind there   ok start somewhere  waitress wasn't very knowledgeable when asked big burgers she made circle hand    So turkey burger cheddar bacon fries friend just cheese burger  fries hand cut in n out burger but shortest fries ever had  Almost cut them mini potatoes bottom bag  small dipping them dipping fingers crumbs fries them  fingers tasted good ketchup them  burgers ok great  asked waitress fries always short she said yes hand cut them    With said bill 42 bucks left 12 buck tip  need buy bigger potatoes sure all money they're changing food  Wasn't impressed anything  Next time eat buffet 20 bucks person  <EOR> Buffalo chicken sliders = Love  Friendly service = I'd probably steady  Weak French fries = just into you <EOR> Had Turkey burger protein style portobello mushroom additional cost but worth paying!   Side sweet potato fries skinny fries salsa sides chips tasteful! Also vanilla ice cream    WOW! really taste vanilla flavor    <EOR> Quick no frills place grab burger if don't want eat food court  Server nice food good although anything special   They some seating outdoors pool looks nice if its hot out  <EOR> Very good burgers sure u sit patio  view pool awesome! High quality beef burger mushroom burger really good well  <EOR> This place ok   wife ordered beef sliders ordered chicken sliders   Order came really wasn't nothing exciting   chicken looked pounded hammer   Very thin price   Wife's beef sliders ok but wouldn't order again   French fries very salty send them back some less salty   Don't know others food but would never again <EOR> This place does close midnight   I just walked closed 1045pm Monday hours place scaled back   Hopefully someone post actual hours place open because staff cafe no idea   Looking forward trying out   Edit Looks Palms falling hard times  Another bites dust  <EOR>
