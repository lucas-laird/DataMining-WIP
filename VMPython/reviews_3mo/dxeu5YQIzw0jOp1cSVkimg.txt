The other note service 7 8 minutes placed order looking around restaurant dining solo tonight soak authentic homey decor  server must thought being impatient he then warned specific dishes ordered take while cook  concerned time but think warning would better suited placing order 8 minutes after   Regardless definitely plan coming back more people enjoy better variety awesome menu  <EOR> Holy crap found new japanese food  chef owner awesome  He came table personally took order helped choices  homemade soy sauce crispy pork belly amazing chef's choice sashimi platter including Toro!
