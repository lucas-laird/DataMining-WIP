 breading stuffed soaking oil   no delightful garlic wine sauce just butter stuffing   removed stuffing ate six seven shrimp   The third time ordered shrimp linguini red sauce   shrimp tasted very fishy again red sauce utterly bland! extremely disappointing     My husband veal parmesan said good except veal wasn't pounded down thickness little off putting thick breading covered veal   He also another visit carbonara he liked lot third visit he baked ziti thought very good but meatballs  horrible   Our friend lobster ravioli pink sauce   pink sauce very mild flavor he said okay   The garlic knot bread good service good   manager owners ask everything always say good but just don't negative remarks front customers review more them just pray read it     We love everything restaurant but seafood dishes need major overhaul need remake meatball recipe  <EOR> The original Trattoria Reggiano location inside Venetian pretty popular 4 star average long remember  when first arrived new second location wasn't shocking hear we'd little bit wait 30 45 minutes even Sunday 7pm  But wasn't until nearly hour fifteen minutes later walked seated patio might smallest restaurant Downtown Summerlin    Up until seated only other party put name down wait  time waited place really started clear shortly seated only handful tables sat  place pretty much dead  But whatever reason table 6 people whole staffs attention  whole time waited table during whole meal  Obviously very close friends family someone associated restaurant  Food coming them waves nearly every staff member waiting them hand foot  took 20 minutes just waiter come over being sat throughout meal didn't improve  Drinks food took forever come ask refills multiple times guy seemed barely know menu  put lightly service sucked  Even if every waiter new restaurant enough experience shouldn't untrained staff even crappy service general    When comes menu looks pretty much exactly same original location  variety classic Italian dishes some pizza seafood etc  Pricing doesn't seem any different average style Italian restaurant    We brought order complimentary garlic knots  flavor actually pretty good good texture but holy friggin' grease  things felt made then just rolled oil  also brought little pepper olive cheese tray  okay but glad didn't pay either  really impressive start   I pretty much already made mind going order before even came here  filet meatballs sound good usually great reviews  ordered spaghetti meatballs  noodles cooked well obviously hand made anything but decent  really let down meatball  I'd say mentioning filet mignon title just way sucker into ordering them  If filet mignon them amount little impossible taste  really just taste straight pork meatballs no seasoning  $14 appetizer order meatballs $18 spaghetti meatballs should no doubt filet mignon them  supposed house made pomodoro sauce alright but far $18 plate   At point done even thinking trying dessert  But most table wanted dessert oddly enough best thing place  Sort of  homemade chocolate cake looks just garbage Claim Jumper serves passed trying that  tiramisu excellent though really saving grace night  I'd literally come back just would likely try ricotta cheesecake too   Maybe expected much   but pretty dang successful restaurant Venetian all places thought TR would lot more offer  Long waits horrible service below average food just wasn't hoped for  <EOR> Great place great service authentic Italian fare  fresh bread outta site!! <EOR> No wait Sunday afternoon   Expect wait if Friday Saturday night I tried once before told 1 hour wait      no thanks    Great selection Italian dishes   lobster ravioli wife linguini claims   Both very good    flavors very authentic  Lots claims   Also espresso martini well prepared not strong alcohol good espresso flavor Another big thing restaurant complementary garlic knots   great   olive oil vinegar table but some butter might also nice   Also when first batch very cold mentioned waitress said Ohh just came out   want new one? Yeah right  just came 15 minutes ago    Nice try   correct response  sorry fresh batch right away  But replaced hot fresh batch 3 minutes later   In fact if any complaint would say server most attentive took while bring drinks took while bring bread aforementioned breach comment    other complaint prices  almost $70 lunch two no dessert martini drink including tip    bit pricey but appears new norm bourgeois downtown Summerlin area guess its expected     The dessert tray looked good and would try TIramisu but full next time   Anyway definitely back try some other things  <EOR> Pizza wine   the rest fine  pretty much sums experience  sat bar despite being crowded waited quite long time before acknowledged bartender even then wait longer take order   which came half wrong  Another couple also waiting bar ended leaving because bartender never helped them    The pizza very good would come back but hope service improves  <EOR> The food delicious service awesome prices little much opinion    I also agree restaurants charge gluten free options  Being gluten free some isn't just some fad diet  charge $5 gluten free options  fair those no choice being gluten free   why gave 3 stars  <EOR> I decided try place late Sunday dinner  outside seating cozy weather perfect  bread served before dinner amazing! server called bread but delicious garlic knots  Calamari also amazing appetizer finished bruschetta pizza   all plenty food share 2  <EOR> I really hoping place  seen Venetian many times always crowded  now realize filled tourists most likely one time only patrons  food kind flat monotonous  marinara sauce bland  beautiful restaurant if bit pretentious  sense place run heavy handed egotistical owner manager cannot see through its problems  watched management while dining seemed stern unaccommodating  waiter very friendly almost much so  probably try again just case bad day  All all however disappointed  <EOR> Cute patio air!! wish DT Summerlin wasn't such concrete jungle hot even before summer heated up  Good quite tasty service good  sure free garlic knots oil balsamic dipping? already pretty oily  Portions look small lunch but don't deceived more enough food but little pricey lunch  pasta garlic olive oil cracked red pepper  chef forgot add pepper waitress failed notice ask them bring shaker table  Simple flavors indicator chefs skill pasta perfect sauce flavorful can't believe forgot ingredient though   definitely give them another chance when summer over <EOR> The wait little bit long  sat bar couple drinks  all just okay  finally seated decided Meatballs! delicious probably best part experience  boyfriend truffle Alfredo 44$  bite definitely worth 44$  would come back anything particular  experience just okay  <EOR> The food good however place understaffed The server really didnt know italian food wine We asked several questions wine list nobody could properly answer them If work Italian restraunt really should know difference between chianti barolo Surprised dont hire more experienced serversll <EOR> After reply restaurant decided give them another try   Last night very enjoyable dinner   food very good great kids menu  definitely eat again <EOR> Stuff try Calamari Lasagna  garlic bread great too! definitely come back more  <EOR> I found heaven earth   enough adjectives describe amazing meal friend last night   If looking TASTY gluten free pizza look no further  tried endless gluten free choices pizza far BEST ever had!   also filet mignon meatballs which RIDICULOUS eggplant rollatini melted your mouth   Finally Italian place Summerlin brings back New York Italian   Yummmm!

Thank Trattoria!! <EOR> The food mediocre overpriced  four cheese pizza  tasted better other less expensive restaurants   service meh  guy pushed higher cost menu items even refused  Also fairly early dinner rush already salmon truffle  disappointing already main ingredients dishes truly wanted get  I admit liked seeing Copa America TV but isn't enough want try place again  <EOR> The concept seemed lovely indoor outdoor feel but food repeat visitor me  garlic knots antipasto plate very nice however salads ordered entrée sized rather starters would preferred half size half price  Kale salad peanut dressing difficult eat very spicy very heavily dressed  Margareta pizza husband ordered which comes no cheese lactose intolerant COVERED capers which mentioned anywhere  very specific ingredient serves mention menu  He fan rolled most off ate half  ordered salmon vegetables the preparation fine although lot oil appeared plate mixed lemon sauce not fan much oil  vegetables heirloom squash zucchini really cute vegetables! Overall just very hefty priced neither impressed items  Perhaps pasta way very authentic vibe but we'll pass next time Downtown Summerlin  <EOR> overprice mediocre Servers pleasant but very knowledgeable Italinan food wine We asked several Italian wines no knew talking  Very surprised dont hire more experienced  service personal  some Italians! <EOR> After hot Vegas afternoon shopping friend decided stop salad glass wine     so glad passed original stop tried something new   promptly seated waited on   ordered peanut kale caesar salad added shrimp split carafe red sangria   Everything very fresh well presented   really enjoyed complimentary garlic knots   bringing more guests more often  <EOR> My family decided eat Sunday  yelped Italian restaurants saw four stars decided give try  restaurant clean staff attentive   restaurant busy maybe third full   food little desired   food no better popular Italian chain  they even use same boxed pasta! started calamari which rubbery greasy served odd colored red sauce actually orange  tortellini Alfredo sauce which melted butter mixed cream very watery  No herbs flavor whatsoever   tortellini house made over cooked boot! happy take tortellini remake something else but eating stick watery butter first bite lost appetite   husband ordered veal parmigiana but waiter brought some odd fried meat salad top!  Oops  son ordered chicken parmigiana   He said ok  family meal son ended eating alone while husband watched   Right time son finished eating meal husbands actual order came watch eat   exactly family dinner mind   Very pricey chain quality food   would recommend restaurant  <EOR> Our server Zeki GREAT! shared eggplant caprese filet mignon meatball appetizers meal  only delicious but also filling enough leftovers take home another meal    The outdoorsy atmosphere beautiful but only bathroom whole restaurant unisex  seemed little crazy me  <EOR>
