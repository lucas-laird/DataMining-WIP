Again beans tasted came rice very bland   Mexican restaurant rice beans should your bread butter but here   chimichanga decent but could certainly find better Roberto's other similar places   top all off prices bit steep opinion   Fish tacos chimichanga without drinks just used $30 groupon  The only things saving restaurant server decor   Inside place very nicely decorated good feel it   bad food didn't live things   would probably try again future if menu revamped   Seeing just opened don't think late but until then staying away  <EOR> The food fantastic  best margaritas sangria town  1st drink free staff awesome  yourself favor give try won't disappointed  <EOR> Meh  really excited try place out   The inside lot bigger expected decor lovely  service really good too!
