BBQ itself 5 stars   Great flavor smokiness execution relative Vegas standards    BBQ Sauce 5 stars   Love spicy sauce some fullness flavor    Sides 1 star   Greens no taste only assume canned   Other sides afterthought   Why cut half sides off menu remaining half scratch some effort? Service 4 stars   People friendly least   Can't argue there  Atmosphere 1 star   Place totally empty doesn't bode well Cleanliness 1 star   Dirty everywhere behind counter crap everywhere bathroom dirty   Just clean inside no reason it  <EOR> The second BBQ restaurant location post Shish Kabob House   fan last place only person ever write review menu seems same last couple additions sides menu some pretty good food combos 2 more     It July 4th   left work late didn't feel firing grill   initial plan just pick Famous Dave's but ended taking quick right while driving west Flamingo due overpowering smell barbecued meat!  heck right?
