Then she asked kind soup she would again try tell she doesn't want soup she wants fruit instead  Again girl tells no matter comes soup fruit still extra  order again order special Ruben wanting stand another 5 minutes arguing just order cup soup  She then asked if wanted rye bread sour kraut Russian dressing point thinking isn't Ruben?? Instead smile just say yes  She then informs would extra    WHAT?!? She asked if wanted chips pickle which said yes  OK  two strikes which chalk being newly opened working kinks   So grab drinks wait food arrive table  food comes notice neither chips and or pickle  looked ticket just case wrong but no there  showed assistant manager happened close response did bring your chips out? Hold grab some you  He never came back    strike three  coming back EVER! <EOR> We Jason Deli because heard sanwiches very good   hugh everyone enjoyed theirs   If your lunch hour may want order ahead because very busy around noon  <EOR> Jason's Deli used favorite lunch spots  excited opened closer home  decided come Sunday afternoon some lunch  ordered favorite turkey wrap NO sprouts  hubby ordered pastrami sandwich  Note When paying hardly any room sign your credit card receipt   you would think would thought better but whatever food  We sat down started drinking $2 70 tea worth buying but really wanted it! food came wrap sprouts        really? bit cranky wrap measly the sprout turkey ratio 2 1 could barely 2 year old full  think manager came asked if could remake but already 1 3 way done all sprouts taken out  hubby enjoyed sandwich which could definitely fill someone up  Overall really disappointed lack food cost  probably won't back awhile don't see good investment stomach  <EOR> The boyfriend wanted subway but want try something different    so Jasons Deli was  Everything really good  homemade sandwich but better feel it  Loved it     But kinda pricey homemade sandwich   price only reason gave 3 stars  <EOR> After waiting 2 1 2 hrs delivery called find status delivery  told ran beefeater rolls why recieved order???
