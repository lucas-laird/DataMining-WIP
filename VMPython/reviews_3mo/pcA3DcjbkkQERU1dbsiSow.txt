Ok   the atmosphere cool too  Certainly hidden gem worth checking out  <EOR> Our large family really hungry driving stopped because close good reviews  Yelpers always trusted reviews but place deserves high marks   We tabouli shirazi cucumber salads baba ganouj hummus tzatziki kash k bademjan part two Mazza plates    This followed several kabob dishes shared ground beef ground chicken chicken  breast filet beef kabob   All dishes freshly prepared grill front eyes  ate heartily took home leftovers portions large  meats all tender juicy even chicken breast   Starters all made house fresh we asked   Recipes simple authentic  Nothing tastes pre made frozen here  didn't try pizza but legit wood stone oven seen some high end restaurants   The place kept clean dingy middle eastern places used to  menu displayed large monitors iPad based payment system modern   I think Chick peas worth drive even if don't live side town because use fresh high quality ingredients budget price  We'll back  <EOR> 2 5 Stars     Walking choosing place sit couldn't help but notice fairly unkept here  Tables bit dirty chairs scattered about    The service friendly but didn't seem familiar menu  food ordered chicken beef kabobs $18 two kabobs plain white rice flavored rice?! grilled tomatoes  flavors OK    don't think would come back though     <EOR> Good food good decor very clean comfortable environment   Would recommend something quick'ish hoping some hummus dish price but issue  <EOR> I'm Cali kabob many times but definitely impressed meal  came husband kids everyone ate up  ordered koobideh chicken kabob rice kashk e bademjoon  husband also mezza plate all excellent  Fresh food clean welcoming environment great portion size prices We'll definitely back when come town again! <EOR> Stopped quick lunch   Far exceeded expectations   portions huge seasonings distinct flavorful everything fresh!  Definitely stop when am area  <EOR> We stopped Chickpeas early Saturday light snack before disc golfing   The inside simple clean although bit confusing   with counter set feel fast food joint but tables chairs actual plates silverwear give sit down restaurant feel     We ordered shawarma falafel chicken fella     It came small light salad lettuce cucumbers tomato tossed super light dressing good   don't even cucumbers tomato enjoyed this     The sharwarma sandwich wraps enormous! much eating light!!    The falafel absolutely perfect   Seasoned well greasy very flavorful   pita great too! Can mention chicken wrap?  Because FULL chicken   Unlike other places skimp meat fill pita lettuce etc CHICKEN   its GOOD chicken too   Tender juicy cooked really well   A+!!  So if experience good why 5 stars?  Well service polite but think confused her   when ordering shawarma sandwich wanted everything hummus tahini garlic sauce onions lettuce etc except baba ganoush    We didn't any hummus tahini garlic sauce all wrap    It still delicious but both REALLY wanted those things wrap     We'll trying again sure   I thought saw deliver definitely might happen!!  All all great first experience   just next time remember hummus! <EOR> The lady work place knows pretty much nothing menu barely spoke english   ordered #27 beef lula ground meat beef kabob rice salad   menu price 14 95 she charged 16 95   When asked Why's she couldn't answer   Told price changed   unacceptable    meat lil dry salad good   Bottom line don't think come back <EOR> This place great! people super nice want patron happy  food amazing just kad beef fillet kabob spend tons money steak house again  Bang buck best places found! <EOR> Simply delicious  Fresh ingredients  Friendly staff  want see more people share wonderful place all Vegas! <EOR> Amazing tasting food  aroma place even more hungry when walk into place  owner extremely thankful guests because he tries remember everyone comes through place  luv ground beef rice made luv  <EOR> If you're hungry great place go  only menu lot choices but portion sizes gigantic  Literally chicken schwarma bowl gf three meals worth food  food itself decent  tastiest but also bland  tried beef kabob which okay  really begged more variety but relatively simple plate  still came huge mound rice    The chicken schwarma tasty when mixed sauce rice  very tender chicken but huge fan rice style but might just me   The staff friendly but service honestly bit slow  While fresh salad good way hold over getting little impatient time food  I'd say good 15 minutes salads   Prices very good amount food received  definitely back try some more premium kabobs  <EOR>
