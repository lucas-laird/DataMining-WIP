just realized looking menu while typing review mine didn't oyster mushroom nor scallop  Wonder if scallop wrapped white fish    Though am pretty sure didnt oyster mushroom though  honest main dish wasn't anything ordinary me  If anything little underwhelming  rice bit overcooked bit mushy  sauce nice sweet  Batter nice light  Nothing made WOW!   Wagyu Beef Burger main course but try it  fries nicely fried topped freshly grated Parmesan cheese  ketchup homemade  guess may create broth maybe bonito flakes blend tomato paste powdered bonito tomato sauce  hidden flavor sauce  burger overall nice  beef soft but bit rough   smooth hoped for  ways smoother but guess wanted maybe keep texture without adding much liquid  sauce guessing wasabi it nice  strong  Creamy but complimented nicely  dish would think represent japanese cuisine    Green Tea Tiramisu Since 4 people 4 servings  All different sizes shape  Lol    Probably made pan scooped out  best looking one  Matcha powder sugar sifted top  Creamy light marscapone  better made green tea tiramisu but bad  lady fingers bit dry comparison  Nice flavor overall  Presentation bit mess though very inconsistent    Iced Green Tea made matcha powder  pretty strong  refills didn't expect part but woo!
