Sun's new Thai restaurant near North Las Vegas area where work welcome it!  staff very welcoming full smiles professional service   inside consists your usual Thai restaurant decor fresh cleanness it   karaoke stage drums guitars set ready go   food!  I ordered jerky $7 95 red curry $8 95 server's recommendation   found jerky little tough but flavor nice   sauce other basil pretty bland rather useless against stronger flavors jerky   did pair well red curry however       The red curry pretty good   subtly flavored red curry nice balance unique creamy flavor   very watery curry but well balanced flavor worked out   green red peppers pretty juicy P A  raised bar beef tender   lots bamboo but annoying amounts Archi's does   easily served two people order extra rice finish they didn't charge extra rice    ordered 7 10 heat level moderately spiced tastes       All all Sun's upper 3's rounded 4 review   welcomed addition places eat around work   bit more Americanized Sun's offers little extra quality food some other Thai restaurants  <EOR> Feeling under weather only two foods perk spirits when battling recovering cold curry sundubu tofu soup   Craving some panang remembered added Sun's Thai mile long list bookmarks thought today might perfect time try food   Quick note didn't visit restaurant person  awesome father picked food  He did mention service quick order ready under 10 minutes  being said onto food portion review   For $5 99 received small carton white rice egg roll panang  egg roll OK  Just ordinary deep fried egg roll contained common minced veggies rice noodles  Rather choosing beef chicken panang spicy level 5 opted tofu  Upon opening container whiff strong aroma basil lime that awoke senses!   curry's consistency watery wasn't thick other panangs eaten however rich flavor undeniable  Unlike Komol's Archi's panangs red green peppers absent chili peppers although subtle spiciness present  But absence those ingredients left desiring more substance curry tofu alone    Sun's Thai receives solid 3 Stars me  lunch special price reasonable quality quantity food though might enough remain satiated well until dinnertime  <EOR> I thrilled new Thai restaurant open part town   dinner first thing noticed prices   Thought little high quantity food location restaurant   Also extremely disappointed soups especially Tom Kha Kai didn't come size small enough enjoy before entree   no soup night!  Pad Thai ok but served lime any cilantro which love Pad Thai   also pork vegetable dish which kind bland   All all just ok <EOR> I happy see real Thai place not chinese joint sells Thai food finally closer place NLV   It's small quiet place sure gets pretty loud when people jiggy stage Karaoke also instruments live band  family owned when group 6 entered greeted wife very very friendly   After waitress The Wife brought drink orders she thoroughly answered every question even redundant some those questions might been  Most places tell waiter waitress gets little annoyed when he she answer same sort question  orders within reasonable amount time always politely asked if needed anything  never hunt waitress down refills anything extra needed she seemed always come perfect timing where didn't feel constantly hounded   Now food! food good  Sounds bland description but   what say? good  your typical Thai place where whatever order select your spice level 1 10  only being first time eaten its kind hard tell if food consistently good just night  Overall all orders group being taste tester everybody's order all tasty  going back see if food really legit only being good certain nights  Only draw back don't fountain drinks! soda charge can   i think $1 each  Which sucks because if hella spicy food drink more! But isn't reason wouldn't come back here    Unfortunately close 9  don't remember if closing every night but night 9 pm  Being karaoke place being am group bunch friends wanted fun sing little  9 pm nicely asked if could still sing Waitress big smile face says Course! fun! husband came turned whole Shabang! Disco Lights fog machine even dimmed lights restaurant!

So 4 stars! coming back! Great Food Great People own it! <EOR> This restaurant nice cozy dine food great   quality food very good but portions small costs around 8 10 bucks per dish     left happy but used around $30 two people ordering only 2 entrees appetizer plus drinks    I feel price doesn't justify portion but overall restaurant feels great offers   Definitely place remember if want dine near NLV  <EOR> This Thai restaurant great  food tasted really fresh  liked Tom Yum Kai soup ginger chicken  spring rolls excellent complimented well peanut sauce  service very good  ideal small family type Thai restaurant close serves great food reasonable price  pot soup appetizers 3 entrees four people bill came around $60 great value  <EOR> This first review goes! Sun's Thai place actually close neighborhood  place biggest but karaoke stage more later also sell own jerky! Sun's least 4 times food always hot tastes good  red curry yellow curry masaman phad thai  let choose your spice level  choose meat chicken beef pork little more some seafood options  Soda comes open then pour into glass ice  food price say never leave hungry    The service good but say most people seem come orders go  karaoke just awesome  Just ask start up  fog machine disco lights real instruments stage which feel rock star! owners staff friendly   The only downside Sun's easily imagine people know become packed karaoke  now enjoy belching lyrics friends owners! <EOR> This awesome place inspired stop being lazy finally open Yelp account        changed diet whole food plant based diet therefore shopping cooking organic farmers market veggies NON GMO Frankenfood  time consuming plus exercising efficiently working full time job getting PROPER rest having some fun times Gurlyfriend counter stress enjoy life   Is seeking but Pimpin' ain't easy   When fall short time which many others skimp time eat properly resulting zooming thru Drive thru any your fast food chain basically putting high fat calorie sugar sodium poison dead food zero vitamins nutrients body's   take out around house when don't time prepare cook healthy meals which often days            eating 4 5 days week considering 2 sometimes 3 portions 1 order 8$ 10$ also changed portion sizes away your typical Western Diet mentality   eating week opened since live close drive almost everyday   do math that   eat lot   know now obviously since GF Thai also fluent Thai she enjoys speaking them   all extremely friendly polite   really respected asked chef if possible use oil order just veggie stir fry $5 $6      He sure didn't use oil no debate all absolutely delicious   also want put MSG body asked if use any products containing told No Food ate Veggie stir fry All veggies fresh cut well flavorful   cook them perfectly also                Green Thai Curry veggies only spicy #10 spice scale 0 10 various degrees spice levels all yummy your taste   personal favorite   Veggies red bell pepper bamboo shoots carrots bok choy broccoli mushrooms   I might missing 1 2 more   crave stuff               Red Curry veggies only    super yummy              Yellow Curry veggies only      yummy              Pad Thai chicken       super yummy GF's favorite              Pad Thai veggie only     super yummy  If want lime your Pad Thai just ask them   it does come it              Papaya Salad    yummy              Veggie Egg Rolls     super yummy fresh some best had               The place very clean good energy it   Karaoke but unfortunately don't sit eat due busy lives take out is   food also consistently good never bad visit   The prices good generous portion size quality ingredients   reasons veggies taste good quality them   But quality ingredients cost more also   also small business living too   so yeah prices good   Although don't normally incorporate animal protein diet anymore did try piece Beef Chicken which quality cooking time spot on   Flavor great   yet chance try any jerky yet but heard others good which doesn't  surprise me    I shared Green Curry fellow co worker he also huge fan now   made myself hungry half way through review ate some left over Green Curry w veggies over some traditional Thai jasmine rice while finished this  Davey <EOR> I'm always lookout good eat North Las Vegas   and Sun Thai spot satisfy Thai cravings   Small mom pop shop only ones dining but did notice quite few people picking orders   started off stuffed fried chicken wings deboned chicken leaving just skin wing tip filled ground pork vermicelli veggies dish surprisingly tasty but tad salty side    nothing few bites rice can't neutralize   Honestly best Thai ever but Thai fried rice comparable Archi's dish fairly large   fried rice favorite dish rice right texture flavor   also ordered garlic pepper chicken   which good flavor but perhaps slightly overcooked portion rather small   service very attentive server always smile face   Definitely give try if live North Las Vegas   well since really don't many other options <EOR> Sun's Thai Food Jerky wonderful surprise!
