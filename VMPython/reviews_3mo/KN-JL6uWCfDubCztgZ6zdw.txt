Stopped opening day poboy pleasantly surprised modern country interior  colorful stick on letters menu signage felt little cheap wonder if they're still waiting more permanent signage?  In any case service polite suggested shrimp poboy daily special today's turkey ham brisket all sides extra sandwiches range $10 13  Large sandwich easily feeds two meats tasted fresh cut but bread ridiculously dry falling apart    Wish I'd opted classic shrimp debris version special lacked any sort Cajun sauce Louisiana pizazz  Next time add side gumbo Cajun fries  Sides bit pricey sandwiches huge great place fly solo  <EOR> Shrimp po'boy favorite! love decor cute menu board hope keep way  <EOR> I agree other reviewer    These sandwiches all bread sprinkled small amount meat  mean VERY little meat    I $12 50 shrimp po boy few sad lonely shrimp  Where shrimp friends!!! Seriously though coming back here   You across street restaurant called E A T  shrimp Po boy HUGE! <EOR> This place if you're into paying $10 eat huge loaf bread *lightly* speckled catfish meat  Very lightly  maybe 2 3oz   Portions pricing grossly whack  Won't return until hear corrected  <EOR> The best Po boy shrimp sandwich !

I finally food took bite sorely DISAPPOINTED  Now know thing two catfish having fished them few times cooked myself  Biting into catfish po boy realized fish wasn't COOKED COMPLETELY  Deep fried catfish meant light flaky but bit into chewy rubbery more eating nigiri sushi! TERRIBLE mention FLAVORLESS  order spare intestines pull most uncooked fish sandwich leaving just bread which subpar  fries ordered also UNDERCOOKED crispy! Those aren't fries those soggy potatoes! other friends also undercooked fish soggy fries  Sad say looks deceiving    Not mention place ridiculously overpriced  Spare yourself Lola's instead DELISH po boy  <EOR> I myself am Louisiana searching some amazing Louisiana cuisine found spot  Decore all amazing food options place eat downtown  <EOR> We spotted Zydeco way Container Park couldn't wait give try  counter man let know they'd only open week happy give them try    We sampled Cajun Turkey Fried Shrimp Po Boy Cajun Fried Onion Rings    Beer Hard Cider Frozen Daiquiris menu but stuck soft drinks    Service good  counter service but deliver table when order up    The sandwiches really tasty  taken notch jalapeño mayo  turkey cut generous slab juicy  shrimp good overly generous but stingy either    The fries shoestring hot perfectly seasoned  onion rings probably came fryer first temperature just missed but flavor good I couldn't stop picking them    The restaurant new clean unique  really enjoyed it  total check three sandwiches three drinks fry ring just under $50+ tip which thought fair    They just miss fifth star rings shrimp portion fact only people which could really way    Give them try! <EOR> We catfish shrimp po boy  Pretty good fries great  Loved interior decor music  <EOR> Prices high sand which little dry  Still awesome concept downtown  fry basket HUGE  shrimp po boy friend cat fish  Maybe specials would good idea  <EOR> The atmosphere pleasant friendly  enjoyed shrimp PoBoy chicken gumbo also talking founder Brandon  Great experience also awesome location when already enjoying Fremont Experience Zydeco PoBoys lunch dinner baby  <EOR> Yummy gumbo shrimp po boy   also dirty fries its all fabulous  <EOR> Went other day little expectations  blown away food! debris catfish sandwiches amazing let alone new prices combos  Don't leave without getting Cajun onion rings  If you're familiar Lucille's BBQ another level  ask Kelvin he gave best service ever he's such cutie heheh  don't normally write reviews but way write one  definitely back!! <EOR> I fan Zydeco since opened last month! potato salad shrimp po boy lunch more times count each time gets better better! vegan gumbo delicious too!
