No more drooling over those enticing commercials only online google nearest Golden Corral 100 miles away!    After having both lunch dinner think say buffet better version hometown buffet but nothing special   Maybe just spoiled all those Las Vegas buffets   What don't place First off don't having start off drink machines carry drink while waiting line   then carry drink all way tables   then when table when run soft drink coffee tea water need flag down waiter order refill   Why?  Because once inside actual buffet only dispensers operated servers only  fail   Second actual buffet area poorly designed   never know line because often times lines fuse together   Third most importantly   lot golden corral advertises t v  restaurant   perhaps because just starting out?  But felt selection wasn't great should be   What like Even though lot items fast all let someone know they'll nice try replace item quickly possible   servers friendly well buffet staff which nice dining experience   Food expect standard buffet   Some items taste better others but nothing going blow your socks off   Just decent food okay price   All all would come again?  Sure would but probably same frequency visit someplace Hometown buffet which really 2 3 times year if even that   no reason people should dreaming golden corrals anymore   folks believe stopping isn't something craving for  <EOR> Went lunch first day opened  Drinks front before pay  green tea saw Hochata second cup Hochata  paying asked cashier drinks charged individually meant being charged two drinks instead drink she said included price took drink anything want price  Later checked receipt Hochata charged separately $2 49  If known pay Hochata wouldn't it  should sign informing consumers regular soda drinks price otherwise charge rest drinks charged coffee sure if included price meal   That just only complain but everything else excellent  wait staffs very friendly very very tentative  food hot very tasty very fresh too  actually made cakes grilled chicken pork chop chopped salads front food very fresh  Over all GC way much better HomeTown Buffet every way   I now dine GC HTB  If service food maintain high standard definitely come back again again waiting Golden Corral restaurant area ever since saw adds few years back   We kind stop going HTB lately cause quality  food selections service kind sub par  <EOR> I'm sure but wow WASTE calories   What's interesting place three types rice Mexican Rice Rice Pilaf Fried Rice what's funny all rices taste same way soggy    Whats even more funny mac cheese tastes just rice  Whats ridiculous green beans no taste all  put over top meatloaf salad bar horrible    This place looks busy but really just much smaller space Hometown Buffet clientele seems lot bigger Hometown's  think saw good amount people being paid SDI being obese work    I'd rather hometown really hate place!    I visit again   <EOR> Let just start off saying always ALWAYS yelp before new restaurants  Judging majority amazing reviews decided finally today boyfriend  YEAH going short say REALLY? place just hometown buffet  super packed i know its only because its new isn't near but food wasn't great  Nothing stood me  <EOR> This place opend 4 20 12 few coworkers during lunch   Food lot better Hometown buffet but trick beginning since drinks first thinking its inlcuded fee but once pay its additional $1 99    back again few days later WOW line hour wait   i drive place everyday afterwork STILL abou 50 people standing outside everyday   Overall food great but worth wait?

Anyway entirely sure drinks price but think friend paid around $11 lunch soft drink sounds right   Regardless don't find any dishes memorable all tasted bland salty  honestly don't know if really complain cause shouldn't expect much but yea  memorable part dessert cookies cream pecan 2 other flavors ice cream unlimited  something look forward even though best ice cream you'll ever taste but certainly beats having only vanilla chocolate ice cream all time   Anyway   my tastebud spoiled give try if want but don't see myself coming buffet any time soon  <EOR> we waited 11 2 hours two friends came later but told cashier paid food already  friends showed hour later opened exit door them  lady pink asked friend if paid  friend said yes  then later friend standing line more food lady pink pointed finger waitress asked if he paid two friends   friend could she said n felt very insulted   waitress came table picked receipt asked very nicely if receipt told lady wanted check if those two friends paid  asked waitress if lady pink manager? she said no maybe she customer  thinking hell?? kind nosy lady this?? then later waitress came back told she owner's wife comes once while spot check   only she shit face but very nasty attitude  thought food okay price could return customer but don't want back anymore   NO RESPECT CUSTOMERS OWNER  thefts!!!  owner should learn waiter waitress provide better customer services!!! <EOR> Okay think some low star comments kind harsh  Really comparing 11 dollar buffet 20 40 dollar buffet Vegas?  complaining line too?

We around 11 20am greeted loooong line door   Turns place also serves breakfast there's crowd since morning   outside portion took good 20 minutes before into door thinking getting closer food but reality slaps face line actually curls few times Disneyland before head towards register pay!  Finally total 40 50minutes waiting seated began explore buffet   There's salad station Mexican Chinese Southern grill station small seafood section big dessert section   standouts definitely Mandarin Chicken fried chicken!  loved Mandarin Chicken because isn't drenched sauce actually stir fry Chinese fermented black soybeans!  adds different flavor your normal orange chicken ate ton those     Now fried chicken ridiculously juicy   Good seasoning outside thought only dark meat gonna juicy but even breast meat awesome   After those two items though didn't care much others   pork chops lunch instead sirloin steaks   also sliders but little inconsistent   first sliders great but sliders all overcooked   Pizzas pot roast chicken fajita cajun fish fried catfish few items tried all alright   The weirdest thing menu fried chicken gizzards   was    interesting   Didn't try much dessert but cookies extremely buttery yum some legit legit mint chocolate chip ice cream!  course famous chocolate fountain but kids hogging area didn't bother it   Service standout   server Southern hospitality quality just watching interact other tables tell guy gonna lot tips!  For $8 29 bad all buffet   doesn't include drink if add drink costs same little more Hometown gotta say Golden Corral waaaay better Hometown  <EOR> It feels weird give buffet 5 stars mostly because used Hometown Buffets world  Golden Corral much better that    First all selection great  Feel eating salad? people anyways? steak?

Sea food? covered    If you're beeline steaks happy report they're delicious  Comparable Black Angus they're steak house   They also all kinds bread desserts ice cream famous chocolate fountain    Service also excellent  waitress very nice friendly    Overall great experience  just wish closer they're 30 45 min away   second thought though probably better waist line they're not   *Note Tuesday wait 30 min which isn't bad party 6 us   However warned weekends wait closer 1 1 2 hours  <EOR> It's cheap boring buffet food   If looking Las Vegas style presentation going find here   Good deal breakfast   mean wrong eggs potatoes right?  Lunch dinner mediocre   Most food serve tasteless commercially produced food   two steps above Hometown Buffet   Save your money across street Chili's better food   Even better idea just Costco down street grab few hot dogs large pizza total bargain  <EOR> Not worth wait    Service poor food tastes more cafeteria food  Even though buffet grill nearly impossible eat good piece steak since huge line well  Oh more thing place mess specially food  towards mens restroom couldnt even in   Since visit last week family Hometown Buffet twice now glad did   service absolutely wonderful food  great  definitely sticking Hometown wont recomend golden corral any friends  Its just worth wait    <EOR> It's nothing but hype worth wait especially burning sun  hardly buffet stand line served steak etc   Even when serve sure smallest piece guess people don't want line again saying 's chaotic understatement!!   It's noisy crowded just pleasant dining experience   regular customer Hometown but just wanted see difference place sucks!  food bland desserts blah worst part can't refill your own drink  The food HTB far superior especially since Terry Golding took over GM   He feel welcome atmosphere friendly feel home   talking friends regulars all said tried GC once more enough   told they're going remodel going even better can't wait! <EOR> The name apt  Once manage manuever yourself through ridiculously long line inside place totally CORRAL  herd hungry people food floor food tables lines MORE food  Don't expect peaceful meal  place doesn't cater that  Cheap prices plentiful food  No wonder Golden Corral opened near Rowland Heights  Asians love gimmicks! =P  And all being said food quality good desserts very plentiful  your standard buffet desserts    Steak sausages chicken etc  All poultry seafood fish shrimp pretty fresh  fried shrimps huge! breads great too  didn't want fill those but cheese biscuits corn bread delish  Dessert! Pies cupcakes red velvet! bread pudding chocolate fountain cotton candy ice cream soft serve whoa     workers kept pumping out  Fresh    My only real complaint layout  station all meats the most popular right entry way where people paying waiting dining tables  crowded lines people walking through  really should more room  Especially if people carrying plates hot food    Save your calories drink water  think ask your server glass water once reach table  Golden Corral tries lure purchase drink since drink dispensers right next cashiers  sweet tea  watered down  Drinks $ 2 50 added top your dinner price   Definitely bang buck here  $10 50 adult dinner not including drink ! Service nice helpful  Even chaotic environment  <EOR> Felt cattle forced wait long line even longer lines food   All servers cashiers very unfriendly hurry own lunch breaks kept forgetting bring refills asked mention never picked all piling plates table well others around us  Even though more food selection hometown buffet worth such shitty service long lines   top off found hair foods twice same visit!!! Eeewww!! <EOR> Golden Corral did disappoint!  delicious fresh quality food beats Hometown Buffet any other buffets around town hands down!  dining area features open kitchen where see chefs prep cooks hard work   food selection vast never expected great buffet experience here   thought only great buffets existed Vegas but Golden Corral proved wrong!    The wait times long but definitely worth it   I'd recommend going around 1 30 2 30pm when lunchtime rush over  <EOR> I turn around when saw line but heard always line really wanted see all hub bub about   line pretty quick people line friendly enjoyed conversation waited   price just right quality food very surprising   thought quality steak would bad but tender very good   All fixings sides delicious especially loved macaroni cheese creamed spinach   Dessert good well bread pudding warm tasty   service point would definitely wait line grub place again  <EOR> We lunch Friday waited 20 30min line   Too bad don't serve steak seafood lunch other foods just ok I'd give 1 more star if when come back next time several months won't wait half hour line   lunch would rather Asia Buffet Souplantation even Hometown  Chinese station       skipped because read reviews yelp plus does look shady Italian pizza station lasagna good corn good n sweet       cheese macaroni coated half melted cheese looks nasty! Grill station love BBQ chicken legs! very tender      pork chop salty      mini cheese burger pattie way dry over grilled smoked Desert cotton candy ice cream but overall all deserts kind low cheap quality deserts pies puddings cheap cake   hoping see some good variety deserts creme brulete puff cheesecake even just cookies muffins but none any above!!! But price range guess it  <EOR> There probably isn't better place within miles better bang buck value place  food isn't mind blowing anything but ok  Maybe around quality average diner grill bar  Better denny's  sure _    10 12 bucks ayce more ask for? definitely beats eating any chinese buffet hometown buffet even todai bang buck wise  Main con long line fact bit difficult Tilapia grill    The best things opinion are     Fried Chicken  Fried Fish  Grilled Tilapia   Grilled Shrimp w pasta rice pilaf  Chocolate covered strawberries   Ice Cream   And are     Most chinese food section besides sweetish chicken which pretty good  not orange chicken  Not fan pork ribs     Meat salad bar    And some other food decent pretty good were     Hush Puppies  Pizzas  Steak  most salad bar excluding cold meat    I heard fried gizzards but didn't see when look those next time  <EOR> I took mom place last week   decided Tuesday lunch being Sunday wait going least 1 hour     The food = 3 5 stars lots variety but overall only mashed potatoes gravy tasty   also popcorn shrimp which okay   steamed fish just salty but pretty bland   Service = 1 star   Stephanie lousy waitress   watched refill drinks offer water other tables but us   asked 2 glasses water she took forever them us     I won't back long time  <EOR> If you're into steak buffet you!  All eat steaks off grill $10 Mon Thurs 4pm can't that   zig zag lines into buffet remind those long lines waiting rides amusement park   Place very crowded hard maneuver around plates food   also line food once seated   staff nice friendly refill your drinks   good variety foods chocolate fountain cotton candy section   personally made mistake indulging salads pastas only steak  Tips sure come hungry HUNGRY stomach Prepare wait long lines 4 30ish Mon Thurs Weekends Hit grilled section! Small variety fruits Asian dishes Prepare large crowds try avoid running into others <EOR> So place first time wife 05 26 evening  usally Home Town buffet  Before start would mention can't eat any meat except seafood    true honest findings wait time moment line when actually seated 1 hour 15 minutes!!!!!! No am joking!  Place extremely busy kind congested inside some hot items  Watch running kids people walking extremely fast plateful going crazy looking servers   Forget someone picking phone give any information probably because busy guess! all your findings before go!  dinner buffet $11 49 per person  Drinks included  Extra $1 99 drinks $2 49 upgraded drinks  Kids under age 3 eat free but limited 2 per family! boxes available $4 79 lb   When enter inside see glasses coffee mugs 32 oz  cup small size paper cup soda fountain some specialty drinks etc  right before pay  extremely confusing right design concept  People coming long wait outside getting confused if those drinks free what  If free then some not reading price board yet thinking if covered buffet price  If then some thinking if only chance decide if want soda if only chance take otherwise allowed later!  register realized those sodas free extra upgraded soda $2 49 32oz  soda cup  reason extra charge walk place having full cup soda compare other regular glass soda price whic can't take!  main grill place hot item where serving steaks chicken seafood items right when enter inside payment  Now where extremely congested crowdy  Poor design think!  chocolate fountain cotton candy ice cream another hot item place also situated very congested crowdy place  because where plates utensil station also located side restaurant people   Floor even some tables very dirty  Restroom OK terms cleaning aspect   Almost half dished doesn't name tag it! people extremely hard know which items might meat not  Yes people behind counter ask but look extremely busy ask twice even thrice them answer   Asian guy seafood extremely rude unfriendly  Watch him  wish noted name down  Anyways confusing station because instruction board says choose between Tilapia Shrimp  choose sides then finally sauce  newbie thought say all rude chef  Later realized job just give meat part then right next station where all sides again without any name tag it!  Some items fresh some them aren't   Only few Chinese cuisine choices   should more fruit choices other strawberry well pound cake needs available dip   Overall wasn't impressed sure if come back again!  <EOR> Located next BJ's Brewery Restaurant Mitsubishi Puente Hills Car Dealership  parking pretty difficult since place still new  Due new opening place course ready wait long lines  wait time thirty minutes bad  However once inside aroma all foods made tummy rumble    Anyways let's foodie areas 1  Greenhouse Area Spinach wasn't fresh   had some dried spinach lettuce organic mix romaine lettuce various dressings cucumbers half sliced tomatoes very watery   what happened cherry tomatoes salads?? cranberries sweet fresh raisins canned fruits fresh fruit tuna salad coleslaw southwest salsa not good pico de gallo devil eggs various soups chicken veggie soup   chicken dry vegetables no flavor baked potatoes etc   2  Wok Area Popcorn chicken fried rice orange chicken fried noodles egg rolls etc   3  Grill House Area Pork chops steaks where it?! Only saw pork chops kernel corn not sweet but fresh green beans tasted can mushrooms brussel sprouts carrots mini burgers DRY! Hard devour   and bread soggy fried chicken buffalo wings tacos stale chips stale tortillas quesadilla nacho cheese spicy con queso bit powdery but enough spice etc  4  Piazza Area Spaghetti marinara sauce spinach artichoke dip different pizzas cheese breadsticks hard bite through much oregano! lasagna pot roast tender but dry no flavor mac cheese watered down tasted powder corn cob meatloaf tasted ok sauce better 38 Degrees Ale House Grill steak fries mashed potatoes watered down tasted nothing potatoes    etc   5  Lighthouse Bay Area Popcorn shrimp tilapia moist flavorful fried cod breading horrible cod dry etc   6  Bread Company Area Hot steamy rolls cornbread jalapeno cornbread   tasted cake   not good cheese biscuits dry but tasted ok   7  Dessert Area My favorite area! more ask for?!

The service great  table sat leftover food drink stains  hardly cleared plates piled quickly  Sanitation wise   zero  used same wipe everything     Overall would recommend coming here   Only dessert area good   I wish BJ's Brewery Restaurant instead     Note true say    paid for  expectations restaurant wasn't high begin with   first last time coming here  <EOR> Since everyone typing essays give quick one  Food pretty good great  Dessert good but depends full killing yourself steak which pretty good especially made your preference   Everything else fresh made i e  chinese food non fresh fish hush puppies tastes ones mediocre buffets  Worth wait? really  Come back again? maybe few months  just try once few weeks  Price CHEAP though! <EOR> Damn    Where begin? review point love food here   PERIOD  only problem amusement park line inside place! No bullshit waited line outside heat damn near 2hrs  Yes line actually starts parking lot  Once inside you'll dodging unattended children serving stations orange cones obstacle course! Other crowd damn good place meal  guess didn't anticipate big rush  But honestly amount people pretty organized  Bottom line love place  But end day you'll find yourself being able best experience possible due overwhelming traffic constantly walking your table  gave 4 stars since genuinely place  just can't deal crowds kids set free roam will  conclusion your choices want wait? want eat? meaning going somewhere else where walk straight in    choice yours   <EOR> This second time here  first time North Carolina  Golden Corral very long wait time huge line door  wait two hours  food pretty good terms quality  everything good but majority is  seafood cooked order although much butter used sauce  steaks grilled order medium rare all way well done  food very fresh  desserts high quality good diversity them  price bad dinner $11 49 not including drinks much food diversity  Definitely want come back  <EOR> So finally opened Golden Corral area   longest time those commercials actually made want visit again   Texas Golden Corral everywhere its no biggie   However people seem think its really good place check out     My advice don't unless 2 1 2 hours waste   top its annoying because 4739827432798 kids running around unattended making all kinds noise   food wasn't even great only thinking might something different offered   finding location every other Golden Corral very disappointed    The steaks very hard eat trying insert fork begin cutting piece   fork bent felt putting fork piece rubber   difficulties made experience even worse especially because 5 kids kept bumping into chair yelling ear   actually tell parents control kids   I don't care inexpensive many people said delicious   Because area plenty nice restaurants no wait time fill same way $30 which paid there   pasta disgusting sauces even right   couple things did well everything fried food all chicken     I would stay away place if your trying eat salty greasy   Because lot dishes heavily seasoned very greasy   worst Spanish rice salty even digest   Hopefully improve quality dishes shouldn't matter lot people line eat restaurant super busy   food service should always good regardless many people show up   Food D+ Service C <EOR> The pot roast yeast bread really good   however long wait definitely worth it   and really crowded Tuesday! thought line would died down since open 2 months but nope still waited 45 mins plus table!   I rated A OK because its definitely better hometown buffet more selection hot food! Seating cramped but service good! <EOR> Been wanting try GG ever since visited Texas  Most people live say ok buffet guess am just sucker anything new   The problem location wait  Unless tactical deployment plan your friends help secure place line wait until open another location catch window opportunity   We showed around 2pm Friday 30 min wait   weekend prior roughly 2 hour wait    Once you're actually inside line moves quickly   also seat rather quickly well    Typical buffet fare think highlight would Grill area anything comes there  Also desserts quite plentiful various options Cotton Candy   I would come back but until hype settles down  <EOR> As American buffet places good amount variety here  True there's long line when enter but expected   the wait 30 minute plus   interior fairly big   There's fish section Mexican section beef section dessert section salads etc  etc     It's shopping plaza there's plenty parking   quality certainly beats Hometown Buffet  perhaps around level Wood Grill Buffet   three friends came two $20 special going on   meat juicy loved chocolate dipped strawberries general variety all really place   layout interior isn't best admittedly  lines snake around haphazardly where people would accidentally find themselves cutting line while getting meat   Pretty good buffet place   Admittedly tend avoid buffet places  <EOR> Birthday Lunch two coworkers  They wanted try place   Ten nurses lining long a$$ line    this yelpette happy   Now know why   Its affordable   Its your new version Hometown   All good   One boss joined said have a Golden Corral Arizona them white folks its all that  But overall think we all satisified   Anyway food fresh   Lots try    I did eat all wanted   am taking better approach foods eat nowadays     Nonetheless awesome time my coworkers   I return only if no long lines  <EOR> ok people  best places long time  good  food selection plenty parking   friendly helpfull staff servers big props server vanessa great sense humer  service ethics great job well done ok down food only open short time lets see hold quality dept  today great reason didnt give 5 stars  room growth <EOR> Drove today Monday around 11 am saw absolutely no line outside decided come lunch  those live area know miracle! past few times driven line literally door wrapped around corner over 50 people line heard wait over 30 minutes just inside    As far food pay you're paying less $10 buffet A OK  Compared Hometown buffet definitely better quality  Everything tastes fresh see chefs cooking behind counters    The chocolate fountain cotton candy icing cake also loved butter pecan ice cream  tell    love desserts didn't care much food but cheesy biscuits amazing!

Yeah even old fat kid approves this   The quality food slightly better Hometown Buffet definitely more options   But all hubbub steak didn't think particularly impressive   Guy cooking doesn't even know cut it   general though food good buffet no complaints   Also fan structured steak line   it's pretty much right middle seafood section   confusing   I don't know if I'd come again though   don't think stomach waiting hour any restaurant anymore  <EOR> Golden Corral pretty much step Hometown Buffet   It wasn't anything special great  Overall moderate me   Likes variety food much more any other buffets to  foods Chinese Italian American Dessert Salads Fruits etc  Cotton candy! Brings back childhood memories haha ice cream section pretty neat because actually pick 6 flavors employee scoops you  Dislikes Although lot variety all pretty bland flavorless me  pasta OKAY    enough flavor steak pretty tough hard down throat don't dirty      mini hamburgers cute but meat pretty burnt felt if eating charcoal \  I honestly wouldn't back unless really mood eat buffet only close     <EOR> Surprise surprise! love Golden Corral yes said it  lot obstacles way could changed rating but quality food variety price wonderful service really came through them   The long wait before even enter restaurant could big dealbreaker lot people waited 25 30 mins before seated bad all   The crowds inside restaurant itself could drive person insane want personal space no personal space all everyone your face walking front back side stepping mad house there   If over issues food really good something everyone cannot wrong  much choose awesome loved it   The service excellent Joanne Texas sweet little accent she great just lovely lady  Very attentive drinks never ran empty plates never piled she such great attitude she made meal even more enjoyable   Don't let lines scare just patient rewarded  <EOR> Came first time loved it! lunch price around $9 definitely worth it  Downsides include semi long wait crowded walkways kids frantically running around  But hey adds buffet environment! chocolate fountain bar cotton candy machine would recommend anyone sweet tooth stop by  mention variety food  Nothing fancy but nothing nasty either  price why give try? <EOR> The food good price $10 95 + drink  qualify food pretty good  steak station awesome steak any way want whether want medium rare medium etc    salad station very fresh   service great waitresses come clean often refills your drink you   MAJOR CON wait around 2 hours long!!!! prepare wait very long time don't anxious once inside there's another 30 minutes wait inside  <EOR> Clearly restaurant lack communication between employees  called morning sure 2 $20 going said yes was  Then wasn't  Yes know only $5 difference but point called checked didn't know  Then split party 6 because didn't table saw no problem it  Won't come again because bad customer service <EOR> I've come twice first time probably all hype cause second time came around started taste just hometown buffet   Basically thats all GC improved upgraded version hometown buffet  For around same price becareful door where beverages charge it  big more if decide grab to go cup well Service way above hometown buffet come regularly seem very sincere serving making your time pleasant possible   They re fill your drinks unlike hometown which yourself   The food pretty average good steak salad bar favorites!

Did live expectations  failed badly  So reading peoples reviews before here  pretty excited some steak watch them cook front me  But guess what?? no where found!l told some friends Golden Corral did any steak response then whats point going golden corral  Lesson learned  ask people leaving if steaks  rest food even good  Lacks flavor   Service alright   Will back? Maybe  might just hometown buffet souplantation next time  <EOR> Disappointing   Long wait many people jumping line   Good variety food but most below standard   small piece steak tender tasted good but vegetables cold   Fried chicken dry hard   Must cooked earlier day kept warm   Many stations empty long periods including rotisserie chicken braised beef pot roast lasagna orange chicken pizza   Reasonable deserts attentive server plus   Come management things sorted out   returning soon  <EOR> The 3 times visited place always HUGE line which always BAD thing food pretty yuy $$  funny think some bad reviews read place probably employees nearby Hometown buffett <EOR> So finally gave hype decided wait line place Friday evening probably worst times come   ended waiting hour time food starving  tried good amount food honest extremely disappointing  food very sub par certainly does justify ridiculous wait time  Food bland salty cooked properly  give them credit having great service but unfortunately came food   not waiters  <EOR> Alright guys guys being harsh GC sure food stuff might best world  But think expect 10 dollar buffet? overall satisfied bad people say because indeed cheap buffet but yeh best thus 4 star  <EOR> Food bad daughter threw all runs chicken served more just pink only but ALL very blan  MUCH better    don't believe all hype worth 1 1 2 hour wait      place should called stable because all mess pigs eat slop  very uncomfortable sitting under bright lights witness mess     disappointment !!!!!! <EOR> Since never big fan buffet places outside Las Vegas expectations place very high  driving into parking lot saw line literally door nearly half length building outside hoping would reason why all people standing line eat here  Maybe place would better cafeteria type food expecting     We party 8 only 7 arrived but cashier nice enough let pay 8th person wouldn't wait line join inside  place very few tables parties larger 4 seated 2 adjoining 4 person tables  Friday night place CROWDED  Each various stations quite line but made point try sample each place   The salad bar dessert bar both pretty standard dessert bar featuring novelties such real ice cream as opposed soft serve machine cotton candy well chocolate fountain  fresh breads section fairly good  enjoyed garlic cheese biscuits friend said yeast rolls great too    Most other food rather normal sub par  very different your run of the mill Hometown Buffet terms quality similar selections  steak line pretty long but cook would only serve rare  well done even when asked medium rare something else  well done overcooked rare very rare  lot fried food such steak fries fried shrimp fried chicken good but lot other times such mac cheese corn cob veggies lacked flavor just screamed frozen food Costco! cool  I'd skip most ethnic dishes well unless don't mind lack authenticity good taste general    Since place constantly busy understandable restaurant MESS  table must've lil kids eating before because seats underneath table covered crumbs leftover food  big deal but moreso resident clean freak    So overall    The good service great friendly  Props cashier seating without entire party being present  Service great  server friendly quick courteous  extra star thanks Brittany great service  $12 dinner ton food relatively low budget   The bad Most food very average some food just good all   The ugly place very busy always seems packed prepared wait if coming during busy lunch dinner period  Messy crowded  ambience cafeteria  <EOR> First time family birthday wasn't expecting much considering its buffet  Service could've better server only served time drinks I left alone completely but busy tad bit understandable  Food sub par but again buffet do  Would only recommened if you're picky receiving quality service food  <EOR> Ok go  Being TX Golden Corral popular choice because all other great buffets such Furrs Ryans  Golden Corral big chain all over place but being said tried because no Furrs Ryans CA heard place just opened  Everything typical TX  except 1  long lines unheard of 2  don't bring rolls your table 3  service good all  hardley ever tip service must awful my tip waiter  smile act want happy food selection expected much  choice compared Furrs  cool if some time spend chat friends family but caution long lines    Tip If plan going dinner take some chairs blanket books pack lunch! lines horrible never seen such long lines Golden Corral ever! <EOR> This place mad house BUT food better decent large variety  Everything seems made fresh house service people responsive  <EOR> Worst  Restaurant  Ever   I saw long lines ever since opened finally decided check them out  building nice decor would expect newer restaurant  However food very mediocre edible  left restaurant feeling little sick stomach writing still wondering even ate there  also ants hidden between napkins table   I still don't why long lines probably won't ever back again  eat somewhere else your body thank later! <EOR> You know what? really high hopes place because saw commercials all time but closest Golden Corral Apple Valley which unless way Vegas visit even way Vegas wouldn't stop here  here's deal  Don't waste your time line  nothing inside worth going in  place over hyped overrun some ghetto ist looking people life  don't know if just luck but area mostly Asian fairly large population cholos there  Its imagine prison cafeteria would look if decorated Denny's    line steak long tough piece cow  salad bar didn't seem fresh dessert area kind messy  seem well staffed but people pigs   felt cattle herded trough  Maybe  Corral part  really grossed when some fried shrimp fell its bin steam table  left because should tossed  No longer edible right? Nope  worker bare hands tossed back into bin  Freaking gross glad didn't hit floor  Never again! Bathroom dirty too    Our waitress really nice but she extremely busy because crowd  would rather Hometown buffet hate Hometown  If want salad bar its Sizzler West Covina me  <EOR> i dont anything place   the line    30 min till closing still line door? cannot comprehend   the quality food for vegas style wait worth it   it crowded loud at least 4 people kids ran into me  if eat lot want variety ok food place you <EOR>
