Paneer Butter Masala very delicious! would come again  <EOR> I expecting food court place good  wasn't best Indian food but really tasty very fresh! cool concept sort full service restaurant meets food court where order then give buzzer wait time would take your food sit down place made fresh tasty!  I actually think cool concept other places should could adopt  The food good but richly flavored few favorite Indian places chose mild spice because usually still quite spicy but think would opt Medium since dish no spice all but just preference thing sort different brands clothing fit differently   We butter chicken personal favorite Indian dish order vegetable samosas  Chicken tasty tender rice good too  samosas unlike chicken quite spicy rich flavor served piping hot! serve them two traditional dipping sauces sweet tamarind sort sauce other green earthy tasting sauce   The naan meal just okay sort pretzel bread flavor didn't care for  also thinner most naan before no real depth flavor   Overall good certainly best quality place food court if mall meal time would likely consider ordering again  <EOR>
