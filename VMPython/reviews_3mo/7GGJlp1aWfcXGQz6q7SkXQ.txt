Thanks! <EOR> One word unexpected  surface place tags itself ultra dive bar hot dog taco menu mechanical bull beer pong pool table little appeal me   But also Venetian which usually means snooty bartender take 9 minutes 13 ingredient $21 martini  Expensive celebrity chef snoots ville Venetian specialty   However down earth little gem Venetian nothing infused crushed foamed suits just fine       It really fun music great food scrumptious because Venetian didn't hep c vaccine hobo stab insurance brave some sketchy parking lot there           Food wise would expect bar some crappy frozen reheated garbage plastic plate   plastic plate but fricking delicious   Under protest tried mini chili cheese hotdogs   Chili cheese usually gives heartburn because don't really chili cheese hotdogs worth avoid them   But tried good back couple days later ordered them again time armed handful Tums maximize enjoyment   soft serve ice cream yum      What also unexpected admittedly surface appear corporate type thought place would full dirt bag types  wasn't   crowd ranges socioeconomic spectrum which great atmosphere   few more English dudes would liked but also think some weird convention week       There couple things aware of   prolific use smoke machine DJ little Beach circa 1999   If couple drinks then become tempted mechanical bull think twice   saw couple ladies scamper thing hot   More awkward dry humping   But those ladies defenses did appear think looked pretty sexy   Also some cocktail waitresses' outfits most becoming i e  pudgy stripper    Maybe someone should uncomfortable conversation couple them but told male companions all hot crazy    Highly recommend  <EOR> Menu good  Prices fair strip  Bartenders horrible rude new location Venetian  recommend! <EOR> I really liked place  Good vibe good music good first stop night  Overall fun unpretentious unlike many clubs  No cover free drinks! <EOR> I came March Madness special having last weekend unlimited draft beers well drinks all day $50   Needless say great time!  I actually when Smokin' Hot Aces few years ago   really they've done rennovations decor   Rockhouse actually decent venue albeit location 2nd floor Venetian l Palazzo down corridor Barney's New York across First Food isn't exactly best   Unfortunately never old Rockhouse Imperial Palace no basis comparison   Our server Ashley incredibly friendly charismatic   She did great job taking care large group during such busy time   The food pretty good bar food   Just note though most portions small almost tapas esque   chipotle chicken sliders   nice tame kick them   kept seeing people order tacos mini corn dog thingys which really cute btw all food received moans nods approval    The bar 65 TVs pool tables foosball beer pong mechanical bull cheap drinks multiple entry points  highly recommend if you're strip town visiting  <EOR> The only reason giving 3 stars honest because doesn't seem attract crowd  on Friday  Now trust am being packed sardines but good decent sized crowd isn't bad    We drawn because some kid gave drink promo ticket  didn't end using but DID $5 jager bombs bought $20 pitcher played beer pong  BEER PONG! realize now amount germs probably consumed playing BP bar probably ridiculous but clearly didn't care  bartenders really chill electric bull! LADIES! Please if wearing dress  not best time jump thing   If into place strict dress code chill environment I say because formal dresses toms flip flops track pants check place out  <EOR> Best Tacos Tiny Hot Dogs!
