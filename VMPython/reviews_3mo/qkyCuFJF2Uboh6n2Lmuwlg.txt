If first door wasn't enough you'll enter through second door inside   Came opening night just check out   Ordered banh mi sake because well Lee's  couldn't think any other reason trying relived past but those days over rather support local store chain   I admit little excited anticipating opening now all ready over it   Lee's standard food decent price   see froyo station coming soon   People still eat froyo?  White tiles floors they're already abused opening night   I wonder if croissant sammiches still ginormous   Ah cares? Lee's  <EOR> Like many others waiting waiting Vegas edition Lee's open  many times all rubbernecked while cruising down Spring Mountain only see place still under construction?  I ventured around lunch time place packed  Fortunately efficiency strong points Lee's before long grubby hands #11 Special Combination  then disappointment  bread little dry pickled veggies little bland enough mayo pate  don't expect best sandwich when into Lee's but hope decent one   It did seem many workers still training let's hope quality improves coming weeks  back again soon  <EOR> My dad brought home two banh mi loaf bread grand opening  disappointed when opened sandwiches see minuscule amount filling pickled veggies herbs  cost last two items virtually nothing baffling  understand crunch crust bite bread important but does right skimp rest ingredients? Growing Vietnamese family near Little Saigon California expected more place   I normally special which little everything  Banh mi delicate balance between aforementioned bread smooth pate creamy mayo fatty char sui Vietnamese sausage fish cake cilantro peppers pickled diakon carrots  much case little throws off sub  If mood great banh mi down street pass Cathay House  wonderful shop located next Ann's Salon called Dakao Sandwiches  friendly bake own bread produce far superior sandwich  <EOR> the food good iced coffee but really did want give much coffee  first time regular size iced coffee more cup ice coffee  delicious decided following day ordered another iced coffee time asked less ice  when coffee filed 3 4 way asked cashier sarcastically guys dont fill cup all he told u asked less ice   disappointing would look  new place good iced coffee because just dont really want give your money's worth <EOR> Nicest biggest cleanest brightest Lee's ever! Multiple flat screens keep entertained while waiting your orders  many choices sugarcane drink awesome! place where buffet every corner place choices fit every budget! <EOR> horrible service   place isn't even ready soft opening   employees no idea they're doing   there's mean manager lady  bossing everyone around training employees job front customers   know all hyped thinking would something similar lee's sandwiches bay area even close   2 stars cuz bahn mi   gonna look elsewhere them  <EOR> 2 5 stars!?   I've Irvine California since undergrad loved it!! ecstatic  when opened locally! think next subway =     I must admit discouraged when yelped only returned 2 5 stars  Anyhow decided see myself place BIG!! LED TV's everywhere march madness anyone? great ambiance very clean modern design  Probably nicest Lee's  line bit long expecting wait 30 mins reading other user reviews but took 5 10 mins which decent  given amount people there  ordered Ham cheese croissant Iced coffee  Ham Cheese huge delicious  No complaints there  don't understand why people complaining iced coffee   It's same all Lee's  VIETNAMESE iced coffee  condensed ice meant melt dilute coffee   duh  meant gulped  Maybe Iced coffee should come instructions ha ha   Never less coffee very addicting  ended buying those bottles keep freezer drink through week    I haven't tried those fresh made pasteries patay sho thingy's  try next visit    Free WIFI always good  Planning use study spot since 24 7! whoo hoo!  I wish drive thru   I see frozen yogurt bar opening near future!   Overall very nice place  hope safe study night  security guard!? ha ha <EOR> Visiting just stopped check new lee's grab late night snack    iced coffee banh mi combo   it yummy usual  Love 24 7! <EOR> Why much hate??? They've doing something right chain far  Lee's Sandwiches day international phenomenon  Now bandwagon yet because several key concepts but consider Lee's Sandwiches Starbucks McDonald Vietnamese fast food  say against fast food chains simply respect success  Keep mind many people chains employ salary benefits provide vs horribly ran no customer service mom pop places    Vietnamese food really potential mainstream say American French Italian Mexican Chinese cuisine  But sadly really holds back concept  Most great Vietnamese chefs don't understand style equally important flavor profile  rare greats understand family Crustacean http www anfamily com Restaurants crustacean_beverlyhills displaypages homepage html chain simply killing it    So ask yourself this  Would any non Yelpers Westerners even Yelpers  adventurous dare step foot place Dakao Pho Hue Thai order Banh Mi?  I think Lee's Sandwiches fantastic city needs  slap face all local shops kick notch mainly Decor customer service   wake call say good food no excuse poor overall dining experience    In conclusion Lee's offers way many choices own good  Less more  Just look Chipotle  <EOR> It took them long open its door  remember seeing just  Lee's Sandwiches sign ages every time family wanted some Pho instead casinos' buffets  Finally chance step its big huge doors last weekend  sure  store don't just entrance but two over sized double door entrances  Feng Shui?  It's WOW  am used small sandwiches shops even other Lee's huge nice clean quality constructions one  don't typical tables tables next each other whatever say next table hear all  spaciest but private feeling  guess 'cause expensive glass dividers? Very good hang out   probably why yogurt station  yogurt station wasn't ready when there  can't tell yogurt  Grand Opening March 25 2011  Hopefully supply Pinkberry    We ordered typical Lee's iced  milked coffee combination sandwiches bags baked every 30 minutes   bread really fresh baked within 30 minutes   must biscotti over 30 minutes bread then   world throw all over 30 minutes breads  kids love biscotti  ordered chicken wings chicken nuggets kids bring back hotel swimming snacks  Also must try green coconut waffles  Very gooood   other Lee's bought ready packed food  those want some French taste lazy morning  late night try French  pate selves if afford little bit more Lee's fast food prices Pate  cousins France used sneak suitcase through customs pates can't bring meat products USA  Heat pate little bit skillet fresh baked bread little bit Maggi soy sauce they also sale very good kind Maggi   world   Don't forget tin boxed cookies also shelves very good gift   Very fine cookies  don't Frentel Butter shelves though   wanna Beure Bretel Normandy France but nothing Bretel   Well least now bring quality food back hotel munch  kids love snacks swimming  don't pay ridiculous hotel prices  <EOR> You would think since chain foods menu would made same quality guidelines  Nope wrong  Came ordered 2 banh mi pate chaud  Damn should taken picture show guys! toppings inside banh mi skimpy!! sad! meat ball pate chaud tiny!  This Lee's skimping customers! course 2 stars does apply allll Lee's just particular  hope owners managers read all reviews some changes! Customers would only want support if food quality  and quantity  heheh <EOR> My wife Lee's before grand opening yet still super busy! Living SoCal enjoy Lee's nicer stores  good layout plenty seating  don't know if new equipment but coffee tasted just little better coffee SoCal stores  heard bread fresh store although couldn't taste difference  all Lee's really wish accepted credit cards but other good experience  hope check officially open Frozen Yogurt machines working! <EOR> Very good fresh french baguette combination  Iced latte  delicious   Try Green Waffle desert  <EOR> When comes Lee's Sandwiches guess answer come back few months see if they're doing anything differently     Unlike few other Yelpers Lee's Sandwich experience before never chain really wanted soon opened   really banh mi wanted see if place stacked other local establishments   Unfortunately service super slow perhaps due being relatively new sandwiches par   found them REALLY skimpy toppings quite few bites charbroiled pork sandwich consisted just bread pickled carrots  brought bunch friends try sandwiches equally    empty    hope understand desire Lee's try them first time show them great place eat   As some other places eat Vegas Lee's seems those places good just because open   quality experienced really slow service sandwiches skimpy   baguettes but better if willing drive them    Overall best but something eat if need soak some alcohol night going out   cab driver probably never reason guess back 6 months see if they've gotten any better    Before forget seems Lee's abundance ice drinks coffee iced tea soft drinks mostly ice   sure don't thirsty drinks mostly comprised ice could end spending fortune quench your thirst!  Maybe sandwiches seem better deal? <EOR> Came lunch break since hearing fellow colleagues raving good Lee's coffee fact big California   My first impression real nice organized inside  Lots seating flat screens  liked express line only boba coffee orders  voice automated calls your ticket number when your order ready  bit thrown off because wasn't going order first thought skipped me  Perhaps whoever's order easier called first    I ordered chicken banh mi sandwich iced coffee plus $1 00 coconut waffle  much fan sandwiches bread hard  coffee good strong  However put only small amount coffee then grip load ice! coconut waffle green sells $1 00 which find them single packages front register  colleague loves apparently  don't know she loves though  dry literally choke piece waffle bc couldn't down!   I impressed 1st experience but lot other choices try give another shot  also noticed soon opening self serve frozen yogurt section inside  <EOR> I know place new need work kinks try again  But visit staff confused looked flustered maybe needed more training    The grilled chicken sandwich extra veges ordered lacking extra vege thought did enough grilled chicken  fresh French roll ok but would mine little more baked nice brownish hue beige   I'm crazy layout fro yo right deli section left ordering middle  doesn't seem flow    I also place franchise now  mean even sell own mayo like spread    Omg did Tony say slot machines?! Doesn't seem very family friendly next fro yo machines  <EOR> Awesome Vegas Lees!

And place even more disappointed only accept cash weird because atm machine also store  I won't coming soon seeing place seems working opening glitches  Maybe few months  <EOR> This place reminded Vietnamese McDonald's    gives off fast food restaurant vibe but way set ordering lines seemed disorderly times   People confused whether 3 separate ordering lanes just single line     We egg rolls   already pre made sitting warming case cabinet lack better words   pretty weird didn't any sauce egg rolls lunchtime just started     We also grilled pork banh mi   sign said sandwiches 10 inches long initially thought would good size sandwich   Unfortunately baguettes pretty thin narrow   meat portion ok but more towards slim side baguette   haha   grilled pork ok wasn't bad     pickled vegetables pretty good   sandwich soft hard however upper palate little raw afterwards   They giving samples some type waffle green batter color inside   surprisingly good   Overall place ok   wasn't horrible however wouldn't come back unless someone pulls arm asks give another shot   better banh mi other Vietnamese restaurants Vegas fast food vibe didn't appeal me  <EOR> Been twice already needs work! asked cashier large Soy Bean milk he made buy bottle when actually sell large Soy Bean Milk  Grilled Pork Special Combo Banh Mi  Grilled Pork skinny would recommend combo any day  If decide order any type iced drinks prepared drink mostly ice  coconut waffles good would recommend them fresh otherwise they're left soggy  24 hours which good  also breakfast sandwiches but only served until 1100  prices decent  seen other places where bahn mi priced around 5 bucks  Also place currently cash only  <EOR> Great food!!! love coffee hot toasty bread     also fresh sugarcane drink    Yum <EOR> I don't really know brought place  nighttime drive through Chinatown which suddenly attracted surge bright fluorescent lights  initial drive home instantly turned into detour  fell victim place much fly getting zapped mesmorizing bug light   Walking kinda impressed  seemed place all  mashup everything way for convenience store drinks snacks Asian sandwiches baked goods frozen yogurt coming soon coffee smoothies boba etc  all plus open 24 7   I happy    giddy even  concept store brought inner schoolgirl me    That all downhill placed order  ordered sandwich grilled pork one    Price wasn't bad  Maybe around $4 spot   decided order coffee well  sat table eagerly waiting still schoolgirl mindset   Place wasn't really all busy  Somehow still ended waiting sandwich coffee over 10 minutes  bit long simple order  call order numbers using DMV like system  guessing they're also trying mimic DMV wait times well  Kinda boggles mind see long took when see seems 50 employees working kitchen   After order no longer ecstatic  inner giddiness turned into neutral feeling  baguette bread sandwich hard almost stale tasting pork nothing impressive   first bite most plain pokerface going on  bland dry overall depressing food    The coffee very strong flavor though creamed sweetened max  coffee taste intense felt getting smacked face sack coffee beans each sip  kinda liked kinky sort way    Am coming back place? Probably not  know there's some new store kinks going but just don't see much better initial visit   Note far cash only joint though decided ATM inside instead credit card machine  guess prefer give surcharges over convenience  <EOR> One word #11   it  couple friends stopped Lee's lunch  course cashless only credit cards only took cash  ordered #11 special combination spring rolls  But spring rolls  Really? Uhm easily!  I sandwich bread deliciously warm  If wait bread cool down gets hard you'll hard time eating it    So bottom line when hungry during brunch when lines shorter  <EOR> Figure give another try   2 weeks first visit   Probably opening week jitters   This time around much  line   only 3 people sandwich shop   ordered Banh Mi special combo ice coffee     With no rush whatsoever still took them over 20 minutes orders   quite shocking     Once received orders another disappointment   Banh Mi pathetic   Hardly any fillings    few thin slabs meat hardly any veggies pickled carrots radish  Bread cold hard   Obviously fresh   concerns definitely made sometime earlier day   If case why did take long them fill order???
