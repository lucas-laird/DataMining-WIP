I area Rainbow Spring Mountain Walmart around lunch time   Noticed sign Mr  Sandwich another sign saying buy 3 Banh Mi Sammies free     sold!  sure when place opened but still putting signage interior restaurant   Also sure if replaced another restaurant location   all sammies $3 50   grilled pork grilled chicken grilled beef house special sammies   Fairly standard banh mi fillings decent sized but bread somewhat average   stand grilled pork probably twice meat Dakao but give Dakao nod bread meat flavor   Still give Mr  Sandwich little slack since just opening   Curious if buy 3 free  deal around awhile   believe also pho special maybe BOGO while waiting order noticed someone else ordering Pho all noticed soup bowl size mixing bowl very large !  I'll probably return   pics attached <EOR> I decided give place try  just open recently wondering offer   Their menu over 100 items choose also separate menu boba's smoothies  prices also range starting 2 bucks 7 grand opening buy boba $3 bucks free   Their combination beef noodle pho pretty flavorful well combination sea food    The main star visit where potstickers crispy filling very good flavor pair sweet soy sauce which just gives extra kick  would definitely back more these   The staff pretty melo no attitude worry restaurant really spacious corner DJ speakers lights possibly some karaoke but don't know yet     For all those locals check new place come try yourself let know your experience   So far visit delicious pleasant! <EOR> Being big fan original Mr Sandwich excited give new location try while area feeling hungry location formerly TCBY location but made quite few renovations seems much more roomy now  lots tables wifi even little stage looks ready karaoke but could wrong  still putting finishing touches restaurant but coming along nicely   For grand opening quite few specials going on  $4 95 pho BOGO thai milk teas which took advantage of  drinks solid food  Again bread wasn't doing me  Unlike original location bread little crustier soft fresh like  most part everything else great   I'll back since area pretty often look forward giving sandwiches another try well rest if menu  <EOR> THE WORST BOBA EVER TASTED! decided give try Milk Tea boba since Buy 1 1 Free  worst taste ever had  milk tea tasted coffee boba hard hard rock  Would never come Mr  Sandwitch again  <EOR> I friend boba  However boba disgusting  middle hard outside soggy  Just looking boba could tell bad  Maybe just drink time? <EOR> Their food fresh  new location just opened since Oct 2013?
