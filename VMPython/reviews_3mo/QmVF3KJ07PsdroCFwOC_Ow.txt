I am always looking good Thai place delivers house because fat picky lazy   I think found winner!  When evaluating Thai places use standard order Pad Thai Prik King some curry mostly red yellow panang if feeling frisky never duck always disappointment    Bottom line front its good great obviously cheap but flavorful   How Thai place screw Pad Thai?!  Try Weera you'll see FYI weera exact opposite place huge portions terrible flavor !  very good Pad Thai flavor slightly sweet tangy    perfect   Chicken pretty dry minimal but common thread all dishes   Prik King spicy flavor explosion your mouth   Even if don't green beans try it!  only problem Prik King lack fresh lime leaves   lime leaves give citrusy pop combats powerful red curry base   dried leaves use aren't very good substitute   However dish still delicious well composed   However finding meat hunting through red swamp deliciousness   I red curry time   Oh flavorful tasty!  Again generously meaty but spice level depth flavor spot on!  bamboo shoots weren't freshest   And appetizer fried wontons   Save your money!  penny sized meat mixture each dollar bill sized wonton   dipping sauce spot though   So moral story Chao Thai cut corners minimal meat and or fillings but flavors spot on!  lazy tolerate less filling fillings good taste delivery boy  <EOR> So much better last place here  Incredible cheap lunch specials crisp fresh food great service!
