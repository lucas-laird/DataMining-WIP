Come on! Huevos Rancheros joke  Tortilla fried should but soggy  Salsas don't taste homemade beans sure can  Maybe spoiled Mexican coming LA but doesn't even feel they're trying  Decor very cute which very inviting  Yes convenient if you're staying premises but if elsewhere   Hoping they're still trying find they're footing improve here  <EOR> Stopped twice over period 2 days mainly due convenience attending conference Mirage  First day ordered eggs asked fries instead hash browns  Food turned twenty minutes later hash browns  Mentioned server asked french fries told would bring order fries  Twenty five minutes later no sign fries but server did explain new restaurant kitchen does substitutions tends just send whatever menu  Cancelled fries paid left  Following day stopped lunch  Ordered bacon cheese burger plain fries  Order taken same server previous day recognized assured would right time  Twenty minutes later comes burger everything apart bacon   Sent whole meal back time five minutes later returned everything looked ok although obviously just scraped everything off  Took bite ok  melted cheese burger over liberal helping onions which noticed also agree all  Called server offered another burger waived charges original when refused  Bottom line if want meal EXACTLY described menu find somewhere else  <EOR> We fried green tomatoes fish chips hamburger fries shrimp over grits  food delicious  Love atmosphere Cindy server very friendly  <EOR> The food decent alone would earn Pantry three stars book  But service remarkably bad barely justify one star review    Before even sat down waiter tried pay $5 water  big bottle pour yourself! declined  want drink? still sat down let alone opportunity review menu    I ordered steak eggs three four waiters buzzing around  still no idea if anyone actual waiter  took awhile dish but unlike waiters no hurry myself restaurant  Again food decent  and decently priced Vegas standards too    I probably wouldn't chance try if wife didn't stop waiter clearing plate while less minute  tell waiters three times did want plate taken off table  would gladly taken refill not five dollar self serve water but none wait staff seemed notice care that    The final straw however fourth plate grab  waiter interrupted middle sentence grabbed plate asked if he could take it  plate still 75 percent full fork air prepared take bite time  start finish Pantry 40 minutes  twenty five which spent waiting meal  If sole goal Pantry customers door succeeded wildly  successful never walk door again either  <EOR> Wow really surprised place  looks interesting while passing boyfriend wandered seated immediately  waitress I wish remember name awesome!

Maybe  <EOR> Like first drunk sex experience forgettable! public highschool cafeteria grade ungoodness    The only reason second star service excellent Cindy originally Montibello CA absolute darling use real maple syrup waffles    Everything else        prefer pass    Meh max  <EOR> The worst experience many many years  Ordered breakfast steak eggs  Asked over medium eggs medium cooked steak  eggs best sunny side yoke whites still runny  steak looked shoe leather sun years  meal appealing nor edible  waitress made excuses acted though crazy sending meal back without trying first  saw enough know eating it    Sent back  30 40 minutes manager condescending waitress second attempt delivered  Food better but worth money  Steak tough lacked flavor    Do waste your time eating here  disappointed pissed  <EOR> First waited line 30 minutes  When finally inside ordered food NO PORK  waitress comes food waiting FOREVER guess PORK omelet  wait again another 30 minutes  While waiting tried others food  Ahhhh      hardly better hop  When omelet no pork came ended putting go  ask bag there's BUTTERFLY inside  completely lost appetite  call UNPROFESSIONAL manager she no help  ended pay full price bad service ok food butterfly inside bag  tipped low $  Probably much  taking  time vacation just WARN guys here  <EOR> My wife late meal LOVE show last night  waited line 10 minutes just table  Once seated asked drink orders  selected two glasses wine Pinot Noir waters  took another 5 minutes more water glasses filled  When waitress came over take meal order another 5 minutes later she mentioned wine selected  order Merlot replacement  wife ordered daily soup grilled cheese sandwich  ordered Backyard Burger side clam chowder  waitress asked if wanted soup separate burger which said could them brought together  same question asked wife  10 minutes later food arrived when asked wine person delivering food which waitress no clue ordered wine  wife told person cancel wine order since hoped drink wine before meal served  When cut into burger medium rare bright red   ordered medium   flagged down bus person took back kitchen fix new burger  few minutes later manager came two glasses wine apologized issue drink order  He also said meat cooked medium but would redo medium well   new burger OK but even medium well' still some pink inside    We finished meal check  reviewing charges realized wine did charged $14  wife called over copy drink menu only find wine did order only $12 per glass  flagged down waitress fix bill  She took back manager shortly afterwards new bill $4 discount applied  paid bill left   As convenient new restaurant Mirage guests service food quality worth it    Also would nice if employees name tags could indentfied working restaurant instead trying someone's attention ask waiter waitress  <EOR> I hope breakfast desserts better lunch  fries frozen kind grocery store  romaine Caesar salad chopped big cut up  Plus server didn't write down wanted chicken it  son ordered tomato soup grilled cheese  He said soup tasted sugar flowers it  tried thought may some sort fruit it  restaurant itself gorgeous  desserts other people ordered looked amazing  hope take some comments heart improve  <EOR> Positives fairly diverse menu offering both breakfast lunch same time  Perfect those unsure time preferring trust gut food choices  pot coffee table share 4 cups only costs $5! Amazing cost effective option  Wish more restaurants offered it   Averages food quality mediocre  Nothing write home but good enough satisfy your hunger  ambiance nice but bit bright especially those nursing Saturday morning hangovers    Negatives waitress inconsistent mix inattentive overly involved  She kept waiting around place order but when she did talk she bit pushy suggestions    Bottom line I'd back if mood stuff myself Cravings instead  <EOR> Unfortunately disappointed Mirage's 24 hour restaurant!   The ambiance really nice looks trendy country kitchen very comfortable nice place breakfast lunch dinner  Also each booth equipped two usb outlets two electrical outlets    However service food does compare great ambiance  staff inattentive most time food came cold  always seemed restaurant understaffed    *Do steak eggs  asked medium well came well done crispy  Also full steak  steak bites  Small steak bites <EOR> Janel the girl flower hair among BEST service every had  said other reviews managed restaurants ten years she takes pride she doing does all smile  She also provided sincere recommendations when came entree selections  Loved hope back  Thanks Janel!  PS record group six 1 00 AM Sunday November 23rd 2014 <EOR> Four stars restaurant + 1 extra star great service! One nicest restaurant cafe vegas located Mirage hotel  fancy kind but definitely lot chic! We really liked decor  food good waiter Christian great! He patiently explained what's menu he recommend  We really enjoyed we'll definitely back even if won't stay Mirage  <EOR> My expectations high based other Yelp reviews but Pantry only decent breakfast option Mirage meeting colleagues before heading Solar Power International conference LVCC   Service mixed very friendly efficient ordering delivering food but then seemed disappear once ready check  prepared wait line during peak hours   I liked menu listed items could made gluten free vegetarian made easier ordering less chance cross contamination  opted garden vegetable hash which comes nut free basil pesto poached eggs no smash browns toast plethora veggies  Portions large side won't leave hungry  food fairly tasty but poached eggs overcooked almost hard boiled  Since short time didn't bother send back but did miss way yolk should run into hash   Coffee excellent fresh squeezed orange juice  <EOR>
