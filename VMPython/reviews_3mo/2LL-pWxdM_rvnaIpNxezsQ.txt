Hope see more least another location soon! <EOR> My friend came home work day telling tales fries he experienced during lunch better animal style fries  Say what? judge one  fast forward bit find myself HQ sample some reportedly amazing fries   I am huge fan slider truck all slider offerings  new HQ cute little spot  love murals whole decor  But also little awkward because aside two large semi circle booths really nowhere sit  cluster chairs but no tables  long community table but no stools  I ordered Captain Fries which seemed most adventurous three offerings mystery slider  bit wait slider ready  But fries somehow forgotten  rush ordered fries those few minutes later  Well mystery slider as standard Slidin' Thru delicious  garlic steak sandwich feta provolone spinach  Fantastic flavors  fries though big disappointment  fries themselves weren't very good definitely undercooked  while toppings ok just didn't work well  Hopefully barby pep fries work better and friend swears do    So while love slider truck HQ misses mark little bit  think ultimately just something food truck whole experience  major element missing just same can't be   However props being 24 hours fries being very large portion  again decor rather neat  staff great usual  <EOR> OVER PRICED!    Bachi Burger higher quality meal same price  $13 lunch 2 sliders super fries They add $2 if order Mystery Burger your burgers 2 $5 deal    But course don't disclose wall menu verbally     The sweet potato fries smores neat idea but way much brown sugar marshmallow creme   Almost impossible eat more 2 bites   But might able share amongst group     The YaYa burger itself pretty low quality tasteless meat    iceberg lettuce very low quality     Compare ingredients yourself ingredients Bachi Burger think you'll agree no comparison   And good luck finding Slidin Thru HQ 3 9 11 no outdoor signage   enter through Poker Paradise bar lounge entrance hang right    <EOR> The little fist size burger bomb   Tang bang! barby greets palate little finesse more hot zesty action night stand  Though bacon onions sad thought thick juicy angus caramalized jalapeno sauce hot affair   Its given preference fiery racy food affairs  passing pulled porky would put shame  Generously portioned flesh fiery jalapeno sauce racy bbq sauce  Remember swallow   Light loud minus food coma lunchtime getaway  <EOR> The truck landed stationary spot! slider mobile still cruising Vegas serving burgers but nice see there's all night HQ slider grub  location also serves help avoid issue running food truck don't shy!

Pep Pep alright probably little basic even though  going for   Captain's Order yikes   Although sounded awesome menu feta cheese bacon arugula roma tomato balsamic reduction oh man   it killed palette   Balsamic beef good combination almost made feel beef tasted rancid   However ordered Captain's Order french fry form redeemed oh Captain captain   probably most bomb order fries ever next Carne Asada Fries   seriously delicious ingredient combo worked fries but slider   The s o ordered Pulled Porky Barby Mystery Slider which French Dip   Although s o excited find Mystery Slider French Dip unfortunately all three quite meh   set off charged extra $2 Mystery Slider   Speaking which pricing pretty decent both just disagreed $2 premium Mystery Slider which made $5 slider   Also don't know why shady soda refills   Apparently first refill free they'll even mark your cup but any additional refills $0 50 each   hit hot button charging refills consider bad business especially burger joint no bueno   Overall Slidin Thru HQ alright way overrated   Would come back?  Yeah but just fries nothing else  <EOR> I've heard lot Slidin' Thru Truck wanting try while now awesome find actual restaurant to   offbeat area a business park located right next bar gaming lounge no signs outside   just walk into lounge in    I definitely agree food top notch   menu only made sliders fries but quality food awesome   able mix match three sliders   barby yaya pep pep sliders   All three sliders great each distinctive flavors   barby bbq style slider yaya greek style slider pep pep cheese bacon slider special sauce   don't seem big first but pretty stuffed eating three them   They also sweet potato fries covered cinnamon sugar which surprisingly pretty good   The place itself fun friendly atmosphere server very nice helpful   Oh NBA Jam arcade machine free play it   very cool   I would definitely come back again try other sliders specialty fries  <EOR> Been tempted reviews few weeks now husband keeps talking them knew we'd heading today slider day!
