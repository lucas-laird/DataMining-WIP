Nup   The staff super busy doing nothing waiter afraid back ask chef some pretty basic easy changes burger joint   managers hosts obviously didnt want eye contact ANYONE!  My guess would chef owner huge prick everyone scared apathetic point inaction   Thats pretty bad just being open couple weeks   asked waiter he gave look said hes new york rolled eyes   nuff said <EOR> This place definitely appropriate mood for lots bacon!  It's funny but BLT doesn't stand bacon lettuce tomato  There's some other acronym stands but Frenchy forgetful   The service tad slow but food pretty good  Vegas wasn't over priced    They really awesome cocktail milk shakes sounding very tempting  But pitcher instead  <EOR> What crave when hung over? basket onion rings blue cheese covered burger 15 water refills?

All kept raving good burgers were  turkey good well seasoned  Some other girls salmon veggie blt etc  All good  Yea prices bit high burger but well worth it! <EOR> My only complaint place own fault   should've split Blue cheese burger instead each getting own   splitting fried dill pickles yummy! Mocha Mudslide or whatever called shake very good but much chocolate whipped cream order fries nothing spectacular burger would've plenty!  burgers good but don't know if $13 good   Other thought seated pretty quickly even though bit line waitress very nice attentive  <EOR> My wife both ordered Turkey burgers she hated it  thought just ok but brought watery bbq sauce sucked  many places Vegas eat incredible    avoid if possible <EOR> What hell when did Mirage take White Tiger Exhibit?  Now there's burger restaurant its place? Weird bet eating same area where those huge white cats used swim sleep take craps at    For two people ended paying 60 bucks including tip two burgers order fries jalapeño poppers sprite twinkie milkshake   Lord nothing cheap vegas any more?  I can't really review burger other ok because jalapeño popper killed taste buds  biggest question bun obviously toasted but cold touch  Old buns? just sitting long? <EOR>
