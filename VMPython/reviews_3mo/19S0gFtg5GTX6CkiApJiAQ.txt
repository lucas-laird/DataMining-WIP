First would say crashed soft opening family friends  But welcomed  anyways  chicken carne asada tacos  wonderful real street taco  Everything your looking soft cheesy corn tortilla filled beans meat all yummy fixins  say am meat snob loved carne asada  tender real savory flavor   secret recipe?? really great   yummy am taking kids over today paying customer  <EOR> The food amazing  tacos best  If Mexican food must eat here  <EOR> Delicious! love authentic Mexican food! Great food great prices! Owner greeting patrons very friendly! definitely back kids! <EOR> I very high expectations Frijoles think few changes could turn things around   The positives first  Very clean well decorated Tacos layer cheese nice idea tasted delicious Great Guacamole Good salsa For some reason fountain coke really good Very friendly staff  Down sides Hard figure order looks Chipolte when walk but order opposite side where register is  No pictures see food look like  Sneeze guard head level hard communicate staff  health dept thing restaurants' choice sure  Very loud dining room Chips passable but way salty   Possibly try less salt finer grain popcorn salt since little long way  Expensive portion size  Carne tasted washed sitting pan lost its caramelization   Maybe should order fresh off grill next time? Over all high hopes Frijoles think could very well few changes   Good luck guys! <EOR> I guess would try something different thn usual spot place clean but ithe food seemed trying Los Tacos doing   but nowhere close it    <EOR> After reading reviews frijoles prepared let down but not  food delicious unique Mexican grill  ordered family six two plates nachos three full size tacos tostada dinner size salad some street corn  chose variety meats offered including pollo carnitas carne asada lengua  Everything delicious but carnitas carne asada stood being best  kids young but ate ate until stuffed full  Often challenge them eat but loved food did grownups  really liked liberal guac cheeses pico de gallo  All fresh awesome  really should only two tacos but ate three sampled everything else ordered but food being great totally worth being stuffed point discomfort  long vigorous walk afterward just feel post thanksgiving food coma coming on  16 oz  bottle Mexican coke helped fuel journey  staff let kids sample juices raved good was  Well done frijoles!   Two minor improvements could made  Ok first would great all food come once but did serve literally hot off grill maybe just whole order all once instead jumping order order  Second bit pricey replacement weeknight dinner regular basis  may over ordered bit still $20 more dinner Cafe Rio  being said delicious left really happy <EOR> This location used pizza hut   It lunch time  seen place prepping opening awhile now drove saw open  new place gives chance Yelp turned around back try it   The staff friendly place clean red green sauces tables both good They fairly good selection choose good selection Mexican style drinks horchatca fresa strawberry pina pineapple mango etc   giving samples drinks   I carne asada burrito just burrito no sides $6 95 plus $1 50 cup soda  similar carne asada burrito Roberto's taste wise  burrito Roberto's $7 35 but comes sides rice beans includes drink lunch special    The carne asada grizzly several pieces tough chew through  When hit first piece spit into napkin continued eating did same second piece  When hit third piece done  saw them bring meat chop perhaps could cut large pieces grizzle before chopping up  Eating shouldn't physical challenge  shame since flavor good said taste reminds lot Roberto's If rating just burrito would star  gave extra star because staff great helpful more help needed know enough Spanish understand menu different drinks  But more help better little    They variety meats choose other meats may fine can't say  may want give them try    I really hoping would good because convenient group food places where parking gets chaotic lunch time  Since carne asada eat somewhere else carne asada rather order something else eat can't see coming back   They new only open couple weeks hopefully work bugs  <EOR> FRIJOLES!!

Although Vegas native say Frijoles best sin city offer  <EOR> Went see all yelpers talking right food tasty fresh best tacos town  staff very sweet kind let sample all juice offer all bomb      love short sweet menu  only taco place * <EOR> So based Yelp reviews came try myself  walked into spotless restaurant ordered guilty pleasure once month craving nachos except time ordered them Al Pastor  tell you? divine  meat smoky sweet tender  generous amount guacamole made some jalapeno gave nachos awesome spiciness craving  Oh guacamole? Real stuff neon green stuff other places  beans tasted homemade pinto beans refried stuff usually comes nachos  Everything nachos worked together perfectly  bottom nachos did little soft towards end but  why yourself fork call day    What made visit amazing other delicious food awesome customer service they're dishing out  greeted very friendly young lady proceeded ask if first timer if worked nearby yes spoke Spanish no language barrier issues deal she then proceeded offer samples all aguas frescas literally fresh waters yes all them  tried them all surprisingly settled spinach try before judge me!!   only food welcome change neighborhood but friendly service very few places still know talk paying customer    I definitely returning taking many people I'm Mexican travel packs   food service deserves shared promise part  Always support small business!! Anda Frijoles oh way means beans !! <EOR> Amazing customer service great food! first time guy taking orders made recommendations walked through items  All employees courteous friendly  food delicious! <EOR> My first time Frijoles ordered three mini tacos could sample carne asada pollo al pastor  three al pastor divine onion cilantro squeeze fresh lime  back ordered al pastor burrito style bit disappointed accoutrements kinda took away flavor al pastor  Love different types fruit drinks  staff super friendly let sample anything  place seems tremendous following  <EOR> I stopped just before closing Monday night  Everything really clean staff super friendly   They let sample several agua fresca flavors  All them delicious would back just pineapple one!! only 1 size $2 50  watermelon mango great too!  Along 2 drinks ordered carne asada quesadilla carnitas burrito Mexican street corn  Everything made order despite being end night tasted super fresh homemade  Chipotle junkie might Frijoles better  only thing missed cilantro lime rice portions smaller  everything spent under $20   The only thing didn't care street corn  unfairly compare all street corn Mundo's street corn which off charts amazing  while Frijoles probably more traditional version didn't blow mind Mundo's did   I would give place overall sure regular customer! They're worth checking out  menu isn't huge but well prices really affordable  <EOR> Very disappointing all elements needed legit mexican american restaurant but execution off big way    Visited Frijoles today wife ordered 2 chicken tacos everything but sour cream chip guacamole street corn w no mayo only cheese butter chilli powder order rice beans coke  wife ordered tostada no meat only lettuce avocado pico beans street corn only butter lemon sprite  $28 00  We sat down 10 minutes later served tacos 5 minutes served drinks 5 minutes later chips guacamole wife's tostada corn  Then 5 minutes later realize never rice beans walked counter reminded them few minutes afterwards    My chicken tacos very good very fresh tasting  Both corns flavorless mine wasn't served chilli powder  wife's meatless tostada served covered meat no pico she sent back no meat but still no pico  counter again side pico her  tostada soggy she barely ate it  chips guacamole  good rice beans great coke amazing  She liked sprite she prefers 7 up   I would back wife questionable going back  admit staff nice pleasant but managed very poorly    They received star serving coke products read 1 star review  <EOR>
