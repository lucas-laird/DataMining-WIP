Note 02 26 2015 location barely just opened first location west coast already 2 5 star overall rating Yelp shameful embarrassing  <EOR> If you're going CRAVE CASE sure change cheese slider pickled cuz 2 slider you're going tired eating it  <EOR> Let's way foodie destination whatsoever  However way people Midwest East Coast experience cornerstone American culture history   I quite disappointed when tasted overly hyped White Castle offering Las Vegas Foodie Fest  very mediocre couldn't believe would eat stuff fanatically  When decided open actual restaurant response crowds decided I'd give shot  Perhaps sliders Foodie Fest weren't quite the real thing  parked Harrah's  might consider Mirage across street Venetian north Linq slightly farther south but think Harrah's pretty convenient  happened bypass line it's possible if take side door just walk through Casino Royale because wasn't looking stand line all  line watched private security extended onto sidewalk outside White Castle door   The menu prices tend absurd really glad Antonia R  Renzo kind enough share some large order  anyone should wander alone but really should share 10 slider sack Crave Case 30 sliders friends family if don't want end paying $8 four tiny sliders awful fries cheap soda   In light comment discuss sides first  french fries really really bad  They're soggy crinkle cut fries barely any crispiness salt  Pretty much every other fast food chain handily  onion chips other hand surprisingly awesome  They're crunchy overly greasy  They're onion rings but small enough size won't issue eating entire onion portion while trying bite onion ring into smaller pieces  Definitely skip fries onion chips if come here   As I'd anticipated sliders much more flavor whatever serving before  taste some savory flavors almost paper thin patties enjoy soft bun notice grilled onions pickle  actually found cheese cheese sliders distraction  cheese just obscured other flavors without providing much flavor its own  Order original sliders   Look really shouldn't unless you've never White Castle  You'll more meat lower price pretty much any other fast food place even those Strip  But if decide must experience sure you're aware prices strongly consider bringing group  <EOR> Okay White Castle east coast 60 cents slider would little more appeal  But 1 20 slider west coast? No appeal ever  Even hamburger nasty McDonald's would cheaper more flavorful  sliders literally size half dollar coin takes less bite eat  read other reviews meat paper thin sliders barely any grilled onions bread soggy  tasted literally paper  If actually same prices east coast white castles then could see appeal getting filled buying million sliders cheap although you're wasting eating pile flavorless junk  <EOR> The only reason why giving 3 stars because White Castle something only freezer section supermarket if you're west coast  But now made way main strip Vegas which great news those don't want journey east coast just little sliders   Truth told totally unimpressed  burgers inconsistent lukewarm tasted bland  Some pickles some didn't  missing cheese some cheese sliders too  sure due crazy busy place ever since opened couple weeks ago  Hopefully all kinks worked soon  Also White Castle pretty pricey  combo 4 sliders fries drink cost $7 99  Add cheese them $8 99  Kind expensive pretty mediocre food if ask me   Open 24 hours but seems always line! lunch Monday line door  probably because all hype since just opened  Definitely worth try just see fuss but now tried probably pass next time unless things improve  Located across Mirage  <EOR> This much burger  meat if find small can't taste it  Although pulled tried just meat  flavorless  buns wet  moist   WET  Even though watch them cook burger presents frozen microwaved something frozen section supermarket   Fries? Yes fries  Again microwave them   just presented  fries crinkle cut barely cooked soggy served Luke warm   I know place popular east coast but tell am sure why  <EOR> I hated ! Chicago excited idea more food  Onion chips WTF n cold send back   Save calories !! <EOR> They considered east coast institution but tasted McDonalds Cheeseburgers me  think its combination pickles onions thin meat soft bun   Would try again why but wouldn't expect outstanding all    Onion strips okay  Staff polite kind way combo #2 no time 4 cheeseburgers onions fries plus drink    Place located east wall Casino Royale which think took some space Denny's use might still there    Security keep people cutting very long line   My experience walking asked guard if just said yes then he asked line but no long line asked which line? He then said oh another guard just said ahead sir  Line actually 5 deep time door strip some mentioned  <EOR> Tried White Castle first time Las Vegas Foodie Fest thought decent  think more hype great made want give try    When heard White Castle opening Vegas thought should try real place instead food truck  friend opening day  line wrapped around building  waited hour half but moved pretty fast considering line people  While waiting nice see some staff coming talk we're enthusiastic opening    When finally front try everything  Almost everything  original sliders fries loaded fries chicken rings  Once food ourselves indulged  Loved chicken rings doesn't love fries  loaded fries tasted good but could done without bacon sadly didn't taste good crispy bacon all love  Annnnnd then sliders   they tasted just remembered foodie fest  Luke warm wet almost soggy bread   I'm optimist wanna back try again hope only due craziness opening day  If definitely munchie drunk food    P S  beer! way serve pretty awesome  <EOR> Was surprised walking down Vegas Strip happen upon White Castle!  exterior interior design building very well done nice stone work exterior great use wall graphics inside  Surprisingly floor plan works very well especially considering long narrow nature space work with  Having security good idea helped keep traffic flowing    As hamburgers themselves very well cooked  enjoyed double cheese regular White Castles cheeseburgers well fries  always top off Coca Cola  burgers cooked very well fact some best long time  Some people think greasy but actually steam cooking process results nice soft somewhat juicy bottom bun  Everything very fresh hot off grill   also enjoyed krinkle fries  good well though am more fan sweet potato fries   With White Castle love them hate them  suppose love them Las Vegas location did disappoint  Customer service very good well  opportunity brief conversations several staff all seemed genuinely enjoying new workplace  cleaning staff making sure front room clean whistle recently vacated seats ready new customers  also good see incorporated Vegas theme signage including slot machine menu sign   All all visits new White Castle Las Vegas very enjoyable  quality food service great  highly recommend all relocated East Coast Nevadans  <EOR> Omg sliders crap  Being East coast Northern va area never tried when came everyone said must try  Disgusting!  took bit it  don't know why everyone raved place  <EOR> So we're Vegas   kinda drunk hungry  do? White Castle!   Yeah   soooooo good all  don't know why friends East Coast rave over gross mini burgers  Honestly taste they've microwaved  *shudder*   If must try your system off bucket list some kind  <EOR> So once found opened White Castle Vegas knew try upcoming trip   last night took Deuce down Casino Royale between Harrah's Venetian see all hype all about   heard lines could crazy but luckily only minimally busy Tuesday night wait short   Unfortunately impressed hamburger  sister in law tried Chicken Ring burger liked may consider trying next time     glad tried but sure if would again  <EOR> 2 26 reached WC day regarding mistake order yet receive response   Apparently customer service isn't important when you're selling thousands hamburgers day   ________  Being originally Chicago dying but wanted wait until craziness died down   finally made over lunch Noon   Believe wait only 5 minutes   Yes busy and line grew lunchtime but still hours when opened    It's definitely more expensive typical WC but understandable both being Strip delivering food Midwest   said burgers onion ri    er chips remembered  fantastic   frozen ones stores don't even compare   The workers friendly place clean   However did forget wife's chicken rings considering overpriced live 15 miles away  issue   Regardless know return when crave <EOR> Mmmm White Castle   brings back college days every time visit one! stoked when heard opening WC Vegas because means no longer seek them when traveling back Midwest  knew crowds would bad waited couple weeks before checking out  But little did know would still crowds long lines! If come location expect wait 2 separate lines 1 outside into store another order once inside  security guards little rude during whole process which may turn off location while least until lines die down little   This location also much more expensive other WC locations to   probably because located Las Vegas Strip versus some southside hood  food par any other WC's something people love hate  You'll never meet someone just thinks White Castle alright  love hate no exception    My favorites cheeseburger sliders chicken rings  fries suck would stay away those  thought maybe location would different because would fresher due higher turnover crowds but nope   still sucks! full staff working food comes surprisingly fast amount customers they're serving  all locations 24 7 your fix anytime! <EOR> Worst burgers ever!!! don't know what's big hype place but total disappointment mention price!! Not worth calories!! <EOR> Having grown NYC remember when burgers 8 cents remember being excited when White Castle started selling frozen sliders Costco then grocery stores   personally think frozen ones better ones yesterday new location strip   2AM still waited least 15 minutes   All ordered regular burgers   could see rushing complete orders voila when 8 sliders very good   3 8 no pickles we did order them way all them onions still mostly raw overpowering   Overall based visit return   Considering frozen ones cost abo ut 50 cents each Costco when sale grocery store why strip pay double iconic slider didn't taste all great mostly raw overpowering onions   post script just came home Sam's Club where purchased 18 White Castle Cheeseburgers $11 way better sliders strip few weeks ago  <EOR> It's White Castle! Remember novelty place when lived east coast  Better burger options Vegas but since nostalgia me  <EOR> Food alright  don't understand all hype  pricing wasn't bad all considering strip  would back  children really enjoyed themselves <EOR> It's experience repeated   burgers slider size which fine but no taste ours weren't even warm why would want stand line that? <EOR> Smaller menu way overpriced compared other white castles  If regular priced would give 3 4 stars because par most east coast but almost $20 person no big red really long line  only give 2 stars but would doubt would back  <EOR> Eek! Methinks RIGHT   I wanted come see all hype about  Sorry East Coast White Castle did nothing me  did wow me  did crazy  just felt poop afterwards   It expensive maybe because located directly middle strip really is  little slider     weird piece looking meat  tell they're already made just sitting waiting someone pack once order it  wasn't great nor horrible just blah  no told but put pickle it   I know classic but ain't me  Sorry fans  I'd rather spend money In n Out  <EOR> Food whack    don't know Harold Kumar craving   don't crap here   In N Out rules here    <EOR> Honestly impressed  heard much hype food really no different then cafeteria university  also messed order  understand times busy but when show only 4 people line would hope right order  Also sure good feel eating chicken shape ring LOL something tells chickens don't grow that  <EOR> I feel compelled review White Castle mainly because stream slightly negative reviews   First things first White Castle does serve killer gourmet 16 ingredient big burger   They're small simple classic sliders oldest American fast food chain   People them both crave nostalgic it   Bottom line appreciate is   Simple   We Harold Kumar esk trek Downtown LV   location convenient guests Casino Royale any strip hotel connected it   Way less convenient all others   parked Harrah's which fairly close walk joint inside casino Harrah's Casino Royale connected   Parking free walk less 5 mins    I've heard lot insane lines opted when all others asleep 5am   Yes burgers breakfast!!  Walked ordered less 2 minutes food served 5 minutes that   Employees friendly obviously over whelmed onslaught customer pouring all day   impressed positive  certainly experience White Castles past   crew bantering each other making positive vibe which nice especially if you've getting down casinos   I'd say enjoy multitude employees working anticipation crowds because when slow its still fresh super fast   There's couple workers constantly cleaning place well kept clean   Another nice change based past experiences chain else where   The set view strip looking deceiving   While may look there's large crowd could just people eating food standing around   dining area toward strip ordering area inward   I'd say good rule if see line extending doors then ok long line   Else should check inside cause line may long   We 20 originals 2 fries combo $28   Just over buck each which standard   could gouge but glad see didn't     We eaten many times having without being mid west treat indeed    little suckers simple tasty   Soft bun slim patty grilled onions garlic esk seasoning em tasty   pretty much melt your mouth which love   Swallow em whole say I can't btw !  Average person probably eat 3 5   10 each   Don't Judge!!!  weren't drunk stoned   Fries crinkle cut crispy   Add some salt   order fries every 5 sliders   Bottom line White Castle those em   same except very modern much cleaner those been   Noobs don't buy into hype   Keep mind where very convenient never crowded relatively cheap   Don't expect miracle burger you'll find great own right   things character cool friend everyone knows but nobody sees     Looking forward having more next time town   Congrats Vegas!  Lucky you  <EOR> I give them 3 stars because food liking however few things don't place    1   park hotel walk through casino strip some more walking just place  walking don't mind much good exercise trying keep positive mindset especially if you're eating junk food lol 2   When finally wait line depending when tables cleared available many people besides packed are determine long wait until inside only wait another line order your food  3   dont extras section menu example if want add extra slider your combo   4   If you're sitting door entrance place during Volcano show Mirage hotel across street feel heat blowing when door open  Im fan heat yes Im aware live Vegas lol ***Lastly hope open more locations some locals tend avoid strip wont there  good food traffic strip parking hotel dealing all tourists enough keep away  <EOR> I hoping would White Castle all things encompasses burgers smells fun other food items etc    waited till lines reasonable could groove   Well groove wasn't groovy   best things slider bun melts little into hot burger   whatever reason weren't nearly hot should be   Lost flavor smell    A $5+ dollar shake each burger 50 cents over regular WC's good wasn't place eating fun few bucks anymore   I'll wait till back NY next one   Didn't want disappointed but        If you're familiar White Castle love them won't want familiar one    Keep memory were  <EOR> Im NY loved but remembered   bought crave case all burgers warm dry eating toast   all some kind freezer burn marks edges patty   remembered being steamy delicious hope improve because love WC! <EOR> We walked into Casino Royale smelt something made both say Damn!   husband asked security guard where smell coming he pointed White Castle while he laughed  thought he laughing hungry noses but soon realized he knew going diarrhea horrible shit  amazing smell onions caramelizing grill  little cheeseburgers soggy full unwanted flavor  am picky eater recommend  <EOR> it's 10 years since eaten white castle restaurant queens blvd woodside queens october 2005     being somewhat drunk big fan microwavable white castle sliders   a few weeks grand opening very first west coast location las vegas strip decided drop give shot seeing no ridiculous lines encountered  stood line 10 minutes ordered #2 4 cheese burger sliders fries drink just under $10 waited another 10 minutes receive food   the overall meal somewhat satisfying but food bit overpriced obviously geared towards tourists  would recommend any locals through trouble navigating through las vegas blvd  traffic find spot harrah's parking structure take long walk through casino white castle? well personally wouldn't again  think i'd only eat again if already close doing something else  only advantage eating rather microwaving some white castle sliders bought albertsons buns restaurant sliders fresh don't hard microwavable variety sometimes take them wrapper    restaurant variety comes sliced pickle    pickle really adds overall taste  but overall i'd say microwavable sliders restaurant sliders still taste identical  <EOR> Brand new burger joint Vegas  eaten White Castle before Detroit  when made special trip las vegas strip  park behind Walgreen's  free parking sssshhh!!! you're in anyways if felt guilty would into Walgreen's buy gum anything need which am sure think something   But when WC line well people excited right now  line down street least 45 minute wait worker told door snapped pics left  may back  <EOR> I finally try hype machine meh right!  I've wanting check White Castle ever since saw first Harold Kumar movie  recent visit its clear stoned your mind enjoy place   Located decrepit Casino Royale White Castle probably main reason people even step inside place  WC takes pretty big amount real estate casino but don't expect find seating quick service  Being only Castle West Coast means place packed lines long service poor its rare see people fighting over seat dining area  If must come parking Harrahs next door Mirage across street should sufficiently close   The food understanding essentially same East Coast counter parts plus few bucks cause eating Strip  tiny sliders come paper thin slice beef few grilled onions soggy bun due grease  crinkle cut fries found many other mediocre fast food spots  Skip chicken rings buy some frozen nuggets Costco thank later  food definitely over priced four slider combo cheese runs $9  Service abysmal place mess   While waiting line party front talking grew White Castle New York excited finally eat again  guess nostalgia must only way really appreciate White Castle  Oh maybe smoking bunch weed  <EOR> Many years ago visited White Castle back east once knew expect but decided give place try just because new Vegas   Before food mention two cashiers both visibly annoyed customers front treated couple two spots ahead completely unacceptable manner simply because new menu unsure order making annoyed face screaming NEXT customer behind them  sure place order quickly possible we ordered #2 cheeseburger fries drink least cashier appeared merely tolerate paid  place only open few weeks employees front already burnt out  What's that? much unemployment Vegas couldn't found few cashiers bit friendlier?  As food well White Castle  is  Tiny thin burger plain bun bit cheese onion  There's burger but anyone really taste it? estimate ratio bun burger 8 1 you'll eat huge amount bun before much burger your tummy! fries just bleh   About location sure where park into place  no parking front ended parking Venetian walking back Strip but surely there's spot closer that? Also TWO security guards working location which only amplified negative vibes place  table damaged enough made eating uncomfortable such shame such new location   Not recommended  <EOR> Not sure all HYPE White Castle all about  way better burger cheaper Shack Shake Steak N Shake Fatburger even McDonalds if want late night meal Del Taco better White Castle  think people rate nostalgia feeling memories because totally worth it   The line did move fast clean but based taste no way  You're Vegas gourmet burger $6 99 at Flemings Steakhouse decent burger local bars same price  <EOR> Tiny burgers eh hem really they're SLIDERS   Good flavor mainly attributed grilled onions but things small  patty paper thin  wonder if ingesting beef any kind real meat matter  big girl but swear could killed 20 burgers eh hem really they're SLIDERS if group didn't already reservations Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse  Superbowl location just opened wait pretty ridiculous over weekend but waited line late afternoon wait wasn't bad   waited 30 minutes thankfully Vegas heat  <EOR> We actually ate Valentine's!

N instead   actually enjoyed food although always prefer N Out   see why people say need grow stoned enjoy it   downed few drinks beforehand but think would still enjoy food sober  <EOR> I always wanted try White Castle only frozen burgers   Needless say when saw White Castle strip Las Vegas ecstatic   line order moved fast line pick food super slow but cares its White Castle   burgers small delicious bread warm soft   burger slider  <EOR> Terrible burgers  4th Dub C experience twice location   just don't it  buns soggy  no meat  many onions    pickle? toss whether store bought frozen ones better not    The chicken rings interesting but aftertaste cheap blended cooking oil    The fries okay  Skinny Frispo style   Despite recently opening many negative reviews service fast easy both visits  restaurant dirty first trip few days ago but clean during today's visit  <EOR> Umm why best hamburger joint getting such hate?? best chain ever  Supper delicious  I wish em texas <EOR> white castle horrible  place work! son n law worked first shift locked freezer multiple  times made fun because Edward Francisco didn't  name refused teach teach job even though suppose  train he didn't  lunch breaks until two boys off shift actual manager working gave lunch break last he work! most definitely  contacting attorney! back east coast white castle don't  need companies  yours if your going treat people poorly! remember  bullying  tolerated! <EOR> Got lucky didn't wait long Saturday afternoon   First time but impressed all   Tastes McDonald's cheeseburger but little tastier but higher price tag   Definitely worth trip  <EOR> I am being generous 2 stars  So disappointed  Growing NY LI White Castle many times usually enjoy it  Today much  I suppose because wasn't drunk  also suppose when charge 3 19 double cheeseburger  30 double doubles that 6 people cost $110 yes HUNDRED TEN DOLLARS!!!!

Of course nowhere near top ranked best fast food burger but wins nostalgia points! Mini sliders grilled onions can't wrong portable cute easy eat especially reminds childhood  burgers taste remember don't bad job Vegas location but consistency questionable  second visit sliders all soggy liking which good good all   I actually prefer original sliders over cheese slider since cheese overwhelms flavor grilled onions much love love LOVE flavor grilled onions  Sometimes would try ask them extra grilled onions most time am unsuccessful but worth try    We also dabbled cheese fries ranch bacon crew thought pretty tasty but think crinkle cut fries need major work typically taste stale  really ranch sauce dip sliders time time  Also pass onion chips batter dense great  shakes simple vanilla chocolate nothing crazy but its bad either  don't think offer strawberry shake location since would all over that  Oh yeah brownies cheesecake stick just thought I'd let know    I typically eat 5 sliders good day filling! normal person think 3 4 sliders just right  overzealous types also offer crave cases  crates range anywhere 30 50 100!

I excited try little sliders husband friend decided ordered 20 slider combo  husband picky eater ordered 15 everything 5 without onions pickles  waiting 15 minutes order course all 20 sliders onions pickles order 5 more  said    Yuck!! hungry hello ended eating 5 friend 7 husband 4 threw rest away!! I guess popular East Coast because don't In n Out!! <EOR> When saw White Castle only 2 5 stars naawww can't but guess what truly deserves   Being New Jersey pretty much grew eating White Castle  Ever since moved 2005 always complained no White Castle frozen ones don't taste same  But holy shit would actually prefer frozen one's over fresh ones  just insanely disappointed   My husband never White Castle life he really wanted randomly 3AM  inside Best Western casino hotel which just really random place first place  actually didn't wanna try White Castle Vegas because already feeling wasn't going live name does East Coast right   We ordered 4 cheese sliders share fries drink  Order came quickly course hubby couldn't wait try it  sliders warm cheese barely melted which means most likely just sitting while  let cuz haven't fresh White Castle forever just hungry fuck  All good until hubby bit into second slider then started making weird ass noise faces until looked burger saw freaking curly ass strand hair slider  FUCK THAT  Instantly stomach just churned just felt stomach ache  sure if hadn't seen piece hair would've fine but just ruined White Castle at least Vegas   He brought cashier hair still intact shit gave 2 double cheese sliders  Nice cashier but still didn't shitty felt eating there  What's sad overheard other people saying much place sucks So came conclusion never going waste drive Strip again if want White Castle just Smith's frozen ones  Seriously you're probably better off driving down dealing all tourist drunk people   It's cool Vegas trying expand all popular foods other states but seriously think White Castle belongs only East Coast  still love White Castle though but just location  Maybe should consider making location away Strip! <EOR> This great place if want pay overpriced burgers which taste exactly same frozen ones buy grocery store  Save your money bachi burger few hundred miles closest in n out  <EOR> I disappointed place  sliders late night snack  tasty  onion rings better fries  <EOR> OVERRATED  Wanted try place when first opened but heard always busy  thought wow must really good  relied regular tv news drunk friends instead reviewing  yelp comments help decide if going eat paid price  taste meat bland bread store bought buns  Really did taste anything stand out  kept thinking should just gone store bought kings Hawaiian Sweet Bread some burger meat made own   did loaded fries  tasty but serving size small  Bright spot security tried keep line moving safe  <EOR> This place over hyped worth filling your stomach emptying your wallet for   prepared greeted two security guards enter front door   Expect two four more security guards tiny cramped dining establishment   intimidating all     The GF ordered slider fries   saw them putting pickles slider knew would no her   Sadly cashier already rung up   took awkward 2 3 minutes refund re swipe credit card   Sure fault making through all trouble  But could he simply told person making sliders add pickles?    A minute two being witness sheer incompetence number called   guess all confusion forgot put fries bag even though charged it      Despite being only line order feel place described chaotic   many employees work   must hundreds sliders already pre cooked just hanging waiting someone buy them   Freshness definitely high concern amongst them     Now actual taste slider fries   slider nothing special   tastes exact replica microwavable ones   fries average best   taste plain crispiness word miles away texture them     Yelpers warned   Proceed your own risk   If drunk all means absolutely love here   If standards please head friend Ronald  <EOR> A OK   Hubby Midwest White Castle hold certain nostalgia him   He waited line Foodie Fest always stop when he back home Chicago   when Vegas WC check out   sliders fries chicken rings   Line wasn't bad evening midweek   thought everything OK   Nothing special but gross any means   Sliders tasted same frozen ones me   wish full menu but maybe come time  <EOR> So when heard famous east coast fast food burger joint coming Vegas really hyped!

Im really considering calling guys corporate office  But food great im fan forever  Tammy needs more training guys no way she should manager supervisor thx 4 listening guys  Ps onion fried much <EOR> I really no desire try White Castle  seeing all horrendous pictures barely edible looking food pretty sure would never wrong   Out sheer morbid curiosity arrived White Castle few weeks ago saw no line figured good time try any    We shared some sliders cheese chicken rings along some fries  Prices bit steep but  expected strip    I surprised food wasn't awful expecting  wasn't necessarily good either  favored chicken rings sliders which people noted steamed therefore mushy texture didn't enjoy  fries forgettable I'd avoid those   Their drink ice machines weren't working people bottle necking fighting side actually functioning    All all guess glad gave them try but looks done me  <EOR> I gave into hype  just even though reviews weren't great  Well shocker White Castle wasn't all cracked be  Burgers basic but just really taste bread  Fries plain jane  No ranch dressing available dip any better!   Now say White Castle definitely don't again! <EOR> I first experience white castle amazing   local back  Raul representative help deserve kudos excellent customer service he provided   Definitely return   Keep good work  <EOR> I white castle fan since birth Chicago  location twice once April 7th again April 8th  Both times sick eating double cheese burger never ever happens me  staff very nice wait short everything should 5 star but something wrong could figure was  Also would nice if security until 4am some customers nut jobs  <EOR> OMG! favorite vacation spot meets favorite burger! sliders delicious along iconic fries  recommend everyone while strip <EOR> This place great  only customer service excellent but didn't wait food long time  First time having sliders great  Perfect size  didn't feel overly stuffed  chocolate dipped cheesecake very good  Small but perfect satisfy sweet tooth craving  Definitely going back every time Vegas!!! <EOR> First time ever white castle  pretty average  busy but expect strip  Burgers good soak booze end night  Would again because price right located  Just expect wait line awhile  <EOR> I've Krystal burger several times excited finally able compare them White Castle never having opportunity try White Castle except frozen version   think hits spot if you're drunk  buns more fluffy frozen counterparts when fresh  overall worth see Harold Kumar all about  hate cool exists west coast now  <EOR> Pretty alright place have!  Very confusing location  two crave cases some chicken rings or something idk chicken onion ring shaped patties I thought I'd wait hours line    When walked immediately helped  within 4 minutes!  The staff seemed little rushed but give them credit  way busy left    The chicken sandwiches good  am certainly going back more very soon!   Thank White Castle  guys did good job! <EOR> Save your money buy frozen ones  tastes exactly same  DISGUSTING!   Go McDs down block   waaaaay better  disappointed  Don't know why Harold Kumar far it  <EOR> taste good when hits lips! Midwestern girls dream come true Las Vegas desert  line wasn't long  Came midnight Saturday concert  consistent taste any other east coast location ever eaten at  Glad made way here  really seems good location too    I probably back some point  Good things come small packages  <EOR> do eat if your diet lately healthy  your stomach gonna hurt real bad  other then classic drunk food  mini burgers fries cherry coke  <EOR>
