Fuck place!!! <EOR> This definitely place try yourself if you're into require following a greasy food b option fast food c high calories d good hangover food  If your'e into healthy eating then probably place your   food alright but felt guilty add extra time workout just balance things out   didn't even eat quarter Kimchi fried rice it SUPER greasy heavy just probably exceeded over 1000 calories    pork lettuce wraps yummy but again guilt feeling took over only one     If could careless caloric intake greasy foods better option say Jack n' Box Panda Express especially Taco Bell but opinion comparable   Try yourself did don't think back but least tried it     My fortune cookie hilarious though read Over prepare then flow [in bed]   haha! <EOR> Food good! Thanks recommendation Jose <EOR> From world mouth via friends looking forward trying place  bit way but found myself general area today thought would perfect time check out  2 pm restaurant completely empty  deterred based all great reviews N  Decatur location received  waitress very friendly helpful choosing order  naturally wanted eat everything but managed narrow down bulgogi Fusion Chimichanga  big home  Right? loaded flavor! friend tried trio meats pork chicken steak Fusion Enchiladas  both loved dishes made even better quad sauces brought table  found sweet chili Asian style chili sauce best toppings    Originally meant order biggest thing take good portion home husband try  He very jealous gone without him    But found myself inhaling chimichanga ended just taking home butt end it  Sorry Hubs! look forward coming again soon trying more things  add friend quite particular she does doesn't she really loved meal     KoMex Fusion lives its hype  If schizophrenic taste buds mine you'll love place  Sweet spicy salty savory    yummmmm   can't wait come back! <EOR> The food greasy ill prepared  only giving three stars because bulgogi burrito  unless sloppy greasy psuedo korean mexican food avoid place  <EOR> Had wait while but waitress definitely made courteous time crunch  highly recommend chimichonga  Best life if cheese  <EOR> I thrilled learn Komex opened bit closer workplace  Love food especially fusion beef bulgogi pork belly tacos  Buffalo location bigger even if layout bit odd  bar which looks never used takes large portion room   This Komex isn't hectic other smaller location lunch time  However during first visit coworkers someone apparently placed large takeout order which resulted waiting food nearly 45 minutes  Even made order food shouldn't take long  need enough staff cook call in orders order affect restaurant service  patient though food delicious    I tried them again Saturday lunchtime food came within 15 minutes service food spot on  fusion tacos again husband tried enchiladas different meats  far good   But during most recent visit weekday lunchtime coworkers all sorts things off  water tasted funny put skimpiest portion pork belly meat tacos  coworker both asked kimchi side  generous portion small plate true kimchi side dish  Mine? Well looked few kimchi shavings small tin container people use hold ketchup tartar sauce  asked waitress she said kimchi orders same really? 2 different chefs made items  short end deal then? Sigh  Anyway waitress never offered remedy blatant inconsistency food which thought bad form  Food should consistent even case two different cooks food preparers   So if you're going eat Komex ready play some food roulette  <EOR> This place lives hype   Reasonably priced Korean Mexican fusion   bulgogi enchiladas Korean nachos Philly cheesesteak great   Service good   health food arugula anorexic chic restaurant   place people food ok fact eating involves calories  <EOR> Bulgogi Fusion Fries Kimchi Fried Rice some delicious grilled meats stick chicken beef pork belly   Everything absolutely delicious!

But seemed took FOREVERRRR food here  Along re fills precious water  Maybe because came during lunch only person working  But still probably only three customers total  prices totally raised two years ago   Still    those damn bulgogi fries hold special place heart   Prooo tip If you're rush call advance pick food!!!! <EOR> My boyfriend fusion burrito fusion fries during visit  He spicy pork burrito pork belly fries  amount pay portion decent fries  tasted great except felt barely any pork belly  Also since pork belly bit more expensive other meats expected receive more    My boyfriend enjoyed burrito say worth because pretty huge    You also orange slices fortune cookies end your meal  plus  Overall place good  <EOR> I'm always try new food especially any fusion restaurants  fusion burrito spicy pork pork belly fries  also gave complimentary tortilla chips salsa guacamole  don't know guacamole but couldn't enough if it   As fusion burrito tasted unique great  portion size huge worth  fries half order $6 replaced bulgogi pork belly $2  fries cheesy right amount spice but wish gave more pork belly  suggest getting full order $8 just keeping bulgogi   This place definitely worth try though service great  <EOR> The original KoMex location favourite places city delicious eats friendly service   new location larger shinier original boasts bar! No drink menu yet though  even large flat screen TV bar area conveniently situated those wanting watch current sports game whilst enjoying KoMex's fusion delights   DID find odd large empty space front entrance   Perhaps restaurant's order more tables chairs exceptionally tardy?  I'm glad report food still yummy found original KoMex   Service still friendly but server must new because she slow side responding requests we wanted condiments utensils!     still received free chips salsa guacamole dessert orange prices while slightly higher early 2013 still very reasonable   All all glad second location west side evidence owners doing well! <EOR> So  Good  Seriously  good   This new location dangerously close bf's house become staple diet  mean where else delicious fusion food both enjoy fills both $15? ridiculous   My favorites chicken fusion tostada fusion pork belly tacos  crunch develop rice tostada just delicious provides much needed textural component dish  pork belly tacos just yummy goodness  mean pork belly   My only complaint breath seriously smells onion whole day eating cause asian slaw  Good thing bf both eat both onion breath!

Browsing through menu all kinds awesome options  opted korean wings seasoned French fries  sauce incredible nothing overbearing but little sweet    little spicy    some sesame seed  Mmmm  mom bulgolgi chicken enchiladas  marinade succulent rice truly ties dish together    Next time getting bulgolgi nachos bulgogi combo plate    stir veggies!!!! epic  #supportsmallbiz <EOR> I hate hate hate fusion places but girlfriend wanted try place agreed  Why hate fusion? firm believer foods tasting better intended eaten boy right KoMex   Arrived empty restaurant wandering around looking lost any sign life seated few minutes later lady popped head curtain asking if would seated 'um yes?' decided order through pictures already pointed yelp ordered Bulgogi Fries Chicken Fusion Burrito share  chicken burrito tasty 4 5 but Bulgogi fries soggy didn't scream fresh ingredients any way  mushy salty pickled jalapeños would love seen some fresh drenched some liquid tasted sugar water  Maybe double fry fries combat issue? Idk just wasn't while chicken burrito decent don't think would way it  Service nonexistent but might due no patrons having only girl run whole operations  fairly cheap $20 two $15 81 food $4 19 tip   <EOR> Love place now favorites! three different tacos Kimchi fried rice Bulgogi burrito chicken wings  All delicious! location more sit down style restaurant  Weird men's person bathroom big gap door  would suck if #2  <EOR>
