Regardless please don't stare just serve food   It's better bad   service slow  enjoyed hamachi kama AYCE appetizers which love  poke tuna ok lacked flavor  Shrimp tempura little soggy warm   did agadeshi tofu   liked tako karaoge deep fried octopus    Nigiri sushi     It hard decipher if fish fresh  kept putting sauce over nigiri when asked them to  order taste fish if fresh rancid eating its rawest form best way determine  ordered following twice   Yellowtail white tuna snapper which all sauce added it  Masago Ikura little salty but kind it  amaebi sweet shrimp really good but deep fried shrimp head hard chewy  never served hokkigai surf clam said ran Uni waiting 30 minutes      The salmon skin hand roll really good   wanted order some special rolls because looked really great others  However don't let order half orders rolls unless your last order   rules weird especially when forget some items    One great thing 808 Sushi right around corner house convenience fantastic    Would come back again?
