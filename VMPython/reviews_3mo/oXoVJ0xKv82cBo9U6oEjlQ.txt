UNFORTUNATELY   This incredibly MUNDANE mexican food experience  food bland  definitely edible don't wrong but payed $18 really blah chicken enchiladas  guy sitting next bar ordered them looked wonderful thats why chose them    So  Much  Regret  also $8 INCREDIBLY TINY tortilla soup which basically tomato water  honestly looks comes shot glass  chips served tasted great salsa ok nothing special  boyfriend even said should just stuck local Super Burrito! Ugh  only thing making food view    I wanted give place try because some bizarre reason thought it'd different few other mexican strip restaurants but no wrong  price isn't really issue ALWAYS expect pay absurd amounts food drink when come strip    I really hope place improves menu  pleasant staff beautiful look restaurant should reason improve quality your food  <EOR> Went group four initially none knew restaurant  saw decor looked good give shot  restaurant itself maybe 1 3 full table very quick  Afterwards server quickly asking if wanted anything drink  service great  food delicious well  Keep mind isn't meant full authentic Mexican restaurant wasn't expecting but way food good  nice little detail sous chef came greet free shrimp tacos which delicious  He came few more times talk us  Great experience overall! <EOR> We decided Linq walk around celebrate St  Patrick's Day there  Chayo seemed appealing decoration decided sit eat lunch there   Our experience absolutely horrible  restaurant wasn't packed anticipated for being St  Patty's day   When sat waited bit served  placed drinks order  waited 20 min them delivered  finally placed food order took forever arrive well  ordered chicken fried fish lobster tacos start all pretty bland simple  Definitely worth price  When tacos ordered some hot sauce them little tasty  took long bring hot sauce finished every single tacos!! When someone finally brought hot sauce just dropped off quickly even forgot take wrapper off! that  Thanks! Great service!   We constantly empty plates table  busser would take long clear table glasses beer stacked top each other    Every time would order beer would literally take 20 min it  aware this!   When finished eating tacos starters busser already setting table dessert when didn't even order main course  friend ordered shrimp fajitas main course extremely greasy  Wish just gone straight dessert instead    It really horrible service even though 70% tables restaurant empty  wouldn't back place all! <EOR> Went 03 17 14 grab salad before head off work 1 PM  wanted eat salad Yelp lounge hostess told could order food to go bar    I grabbed menu decided Chayo Chopped Salad $12 95  10 minutes salad came out  check picture  exactly looked upon opening  didn't ride car run marathon throw bottom purse where 70% fell container  walked no more 50 feet before opening box  sister boyfriend said restaurant should ashamed even serve food looks that   I took bite everything bitter no dressing cold despite grill marks rock solid leek  sister's boyfriend asked rotten thing gesturing limp strand cactus    I NEVER ever sent any food back kitchen before let alone asked refund  But egregious suck eat bill  marched hostess podium said salad absolutely awful wanted speak manager  Even hostess ummm wow wtf look face when showed salad  manager didn't seem shocked anything look garbage pile box holding if salad wasn't joke  She said could order something else but told didn't time because work just wanted refund which she agreed do   While waiting salad come couldn't help notice portion sizes laughable  talking maybe 10 tortilla chips guacamole $9  Yeah LOLZ  <EOR> Went back again but time Elite Yelp Event!
