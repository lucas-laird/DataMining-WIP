Cool vibe free stickers nice employees  Double Pork bacon pulled pork really happy it  healthiest place eat but far poutine Smoke's tastiest  <EOR> Omg  Thank God listening prayers!  good remember Winnipeg   maybe better?  best poutine long time concerned would disappoint    but did not!  best!!  Squeaky curds fresh fries tasty brown gravy   could ask anything more! <EOR> Recently moved Vegas Canada Vancouver looking proper poutine Vegas bit now  real deal head shoulders above other places tried  Public House Blind Pig aren't even close authentic  <EOR> I've never tried place before knew fries could turned into something delicious  girlfriend bacon even she world's pickiest eater loved it!  Should definitely try if your looking awesome experience  <EOR> Had Smoke's Vancouver two summers ago when heard coming LV made date cheese curds  Showed week opened weren't busy  traditional poutine while good wasn't great  Fries weren't cooked enough little light cheese curds $6 99   Well came back week later Smoked Peppercorn made everything  Perfect fries excellent Montreal smoked meats spicy peppercorn gravy plenty curds  <EOR> Great location friendly staff  order chicken fajita fries chicken seem cold  bit pricy side too  <EOR> This place amazing  If dont know type food french fries cheese gravy then ton different toppings your taste    I Hog Town which comes sausage bacon onion mushrooms  Crazy good  wanted more but stuffed  definitely back soon try some other options  <EOR> I don't know if ever given 5 star review before but just left joint miss already!  Pawn Plaza colorful fun spot next LV's famous Pawn Stars shop Las Vegas Boulevard   happened area decided spontaneous pop see Poutine thing all about   WOW   I am happy did!  Ordered traditional could experience all started Smoke's practically licked inside container when done fries curds   good   decadent!  Spotless restaurant great staff best gravy side Mississippi   Can't wait back try some more adventurous menu items   Welcome Vegas Smoke's!  Where heck all lives!??! <EOR> To perfect poutine need freshest possible cheese curds one squeaks when bite into it dark thick gravy  fries potato skin attached   Cheese curds  squeaky   Gravy light  colored thin I tasted lot MSG    Fries  looked perfect but didn't taste good   But gave them 4 stars because closest real thing compare Quebec Canada poutine home poutine Nothing beats fresh  squeaky  cheese curds Quebec  place uses Wisconsin  cheese curds  <EOR> Having eaten many famous poutine shops Montreal original Smoke's Toronto decided give some business newly opened Vegas version  Definitely solid poutine but still grandma says real  They're using Wisconsin cheese curds which good but just weren't authentic experience hoping for  guys work Smoke's nice enough long chat Montreal poutine ingredients bumped them 4* experience  But $8 plus tax meal size portion traditional poutine seemed little pricey compared usually Montreal  course we're Vegas Montreal give place if you've never poutine  Probably best you'll outside Ontario  <EOR> I am American does much experience poutine but become favorite dishes  Blind Pig quite good tried some own but wanted try real deal  waiting place open months now finally open! Overall pretty satisfied  Rob owner super nice staff knowledgable enthusiastic poutine    The fries fantastic curd quite good well  Some toppings great particularly fond bacon  biggest issue traditional gravy little bland could use some seasoning although mushroom gravy delicious  true Canadians love poutine gravy quite yet  But love place back almost every week since opened    STAFF 8 10  FRIES 9 10  CURD 7 10  GRAVY 7 10 TOPPINGS 5 10 <EOR> I'm Great White North only few Americanized versions poutine wouldn't know if version served legit not  But tell good   The snack size traditional poutine amply sized priced $6 name comes fresh skin on fries topped layers fresh cheese curds splash gravy  layered toppings bottom half order dry boring  fries sauced just right nicely soft but soggy  Flavor gravy itself lighter expected but still savory enjoyable   Props having vegetarian options available! I'd opt stick namesake traditional poutine dish over others because rest menu contains cheese fry chili fry taco themed concoctions seem more par bar fast food restaurant  <EOR> Great great great  Comfort food max  regular poutine yummy really liked Montreal    pot pie type pretty much stopped talking since tried it    10 10 would recommend <EOR> Great fries fresh hot made real potatoes gravy great also roasted chicken yummy <EOR> I really wish better experience  pretty hungry when stopped around 8 15PM Sunday evening love French fries   The guy behind counter really friendly patient took time looking menu    ordered large box fries *vegetarian* poutine caramelized onions substituted cheese sauce green peas normally comes it   Adding Jones Soda bill $14 something    Jones sodas aren't cheap but over $10 French fries??!  Time tell if tourist prices last when only tourist attraction pawn store 150' away     I sat down waited order ready 7 minutes later    looked waitperson 'working'  female 20s   entire 45 minutes she just stood some sort in depth personal conversation some customers seated another table   Sounded she works part time Jimmy John's Subs wants hired there   She also telling them would filing pawn store following day when they're filming only time owners main characters show ever there   She sure wasn't working though weren't busy    If she supposed waitress she failed   If she's co owner something she probably some point should come table asked if doing OK etc   When order taker inside called order ready waited 20 seconds see if she going pick order bring she closer was but she wasn't all concerned just kept talking other people hoped order  big deal all however sort conduct most small businesses either   When sat back down order first impressions where looked pretty small price being labeled large complete meal sure didn't lot cheese sauce  just very narrow squirting atop fries   Again really hungry fries very disappointed both collective individual lack flavor   Very bland overall even just sampling vegetarian gravy cheese curds fries caramelized onions individually showed components just didn't much flavor some reason    only flavor artificial green apple flavor Jones Soda     A little before 9PM place starting close up   guy behind counter came outside clean secure ketchup dispenser etc  meanwhile worthless waitress continued just ramble on couple customers other table  Only when finally left did she act she any connection business besides uniform  said gotta owner's daughter wife girlfriend some other relationship allows without truly earning keep sorry honey but say the truth hurts    I drive place couple times week but unfortunately no reason ever back     suspect most business other places small shopping center tourists see pawn store  going enough long run  Hopefully wrong  <EOR> Ran down quick bite husband   Ordered smoked meat peppercorn WOW size $14 tax   Meat nothing example Schwartz's smoked meats Montreal   Gravy salty   am certain BP 50 points   Otherwise tasty  but opinion overpriced  <EOR> The idea loading fries bunch different meats toppings gravy cheese curds cool concept   But    found taste all together be   just okay   I Philly cheesesteak fries all just tasted bland especially gravy  found fries under seasoned well    The fry topping gravy cheese ratio also completely off  definitely LOT fries    It's pretty pricey too! Definitely touristy kind place  <EOR> Woah don't know Tim T  going waitress bringing food all review  If he complained lack parking tiny lot back fact unless you're perfect day you'll freezing burning metal seating outdoors would agree but nothing wrong service   Smoke's no indoor seating  basically walkup counter area line form inside  order cashier call your name when ready    There 3 sizes big 2 lbs  meal size which 1 lb snack size but cashier said he never weighed snack out  Probably 1 2 size I'd guess   Brian split traditional meal sized $7 99  felt really pricy Canada's most famous drunk food  gravy very thin but good could taste rosemary  Cheese curds expected sort cheesestick consistency  expected more cheese both price mountain fries   These much better god awful salt lick poutine Brooklyn Bowl but I'd definitely try non traditional next time  <EOR> J'adore poutine now love Smokes Poutinerie! favorite memories Montreal poutine last October ate share thinking real poutine long time  dreams answered upon return told poutinerie Las Vegas!
