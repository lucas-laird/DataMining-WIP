Great customer service food fantastic! sopapilla sizzle which highly recommend rice amazing ton flavor  <EOR> I bought yelp deal $10 $20 few months back place knowing weren't open yet  Kind frustrating would post deal even open but did say bottom yelp listing coming soon take blame  Facebook page said would opening following month but never happened  reached Café Casera e mail see if any updates when would opening  owner responded promptly said working some last minute things should open soon would let know when opened  owners word kept received e mail letting know opening ready customers  took couple weeks receiving e mail way over but long waited already couple more weeks?   Walking hubby greeted given menus right away  originally planned eat inside restaurant but fountain machine wasn't set yet only cans soda $1 bottled water $1 25 decided order food to go drinks gas station  bummer because Cherry Coke! spoke owners Julie said waiting Coke man come hook up  wonderful conversation Julie also introduced husband mother in law  could tell while talking Julie just genuinely passionate family food serving  She told 5 am each morning making everything scratch including corn flour tortillas all personally made mother in law    Some menu items something seen before other restaurants but promise Café Casera puts own twist each dish personally haven't ever tasted anything it  never heard Sizzle which specialty obviously try it!   Sizzle Tacos $7 95 Seasoned ground pork beef onions cabbage cheese sauce inside 2 crunchy taco shells  taco shells tasted amazing! such fresh flavor weren't greasy all  stuff inside shell acquired taste sure  thought alright but can't say would order again  Hubby took bite thought best thing everything ordered he ended switching Bean Cheese Burrito it  burrito good! flour tortillas aren't your average flour tortilla bit thicker  beans rice great  beans thick rice nice flavor nothing dry mushy it   Cheese Quesadilla $2 25 menu says grilled Colby cheese inside but honestly tasted more Velveeta cheese  cheese very pasty  tortilla kind burnt outside too  two bites done just didn't it    Sopaipilla $2 75 Yes! great  different versions but before  put cinnamon powdered sugar easily shared  does sweet flavor if sweet things aren't your style try plain  enjoyed sweet flavor would order again    As sat waiting food prepared noticed menu boasted dishes prepared New Mexico Flair if want green chile add 75 cents  confused because if dish prepared New Mexico Flair wouldn't already green stuff it? Julie kind enough because forgot order chile tacos give 2 free sides it  awesome green stuff indeed! Hubby just eating fork cold all  wish chile came warm already included food since food prepared when order customer could just say don't want there  Oh well gooooood!  The inside very clean decor nice  4 tables inside if don't want take your food to go  Café Casera also offers breakfast burritos menu  Purchase yelp deal give family run business try!
