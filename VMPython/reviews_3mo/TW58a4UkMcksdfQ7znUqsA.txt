Server thought don't understand Korean standing behind talk eating but wrong!! able listen n talk Korean!!!  2  BBQ pan made all meat taste dry paper    3  Ventilation tube blocked eye contact between us!!! 4  Four people ordered shrimp n served only three   how gonna share those    no common sense serving all    5  Only 3 kinds Side dishes two them kimchi    cabbage radish 6  give free steam egg but charge soup! caution when order 19 99 does include soup most AYCE Korean BBQ places include soups **Won't again would rather drive spring mountain Henderson better Korean BBQ  <EOR> ABOUT DAMN TIME KBBQ SOUTH WEST!!!!

Friendly staff also very quick orders  design inside restaurant very modern urban  boyfriend felt design created nice relaxed atmosphere restaurant! Prices decent similar hwaro  All all new favorite Korean bbq spot <EOR> I'm little disappointed experience because did high expectations   Ambience simple much wow factor   Dinner $20 AYCE  aren't lot choices menu just simple ones brisket short rib chicken etc 2 seafood choices  However quality meat very good  time where server forgot bring something ordered but let slide    MAJOR CON ordered soup apparently can't la carte going charge AYCE but she knew didn't know just discounted it    I still enjoyed dinner convenient around area  But honestly say every other Korean BBQ spot better this  <EOR> I super excited see Korean bbq finally opened southwest side town  Having told place new clean good food thought I'd try out  decor however still rather drive China Town good Korean BBQ  Service ok lady stellar though she helping server  food mediocre believe places such Hwaro Sura cheaper better quality every time new grill brought always still wet  kicker little sister headed restroom server ran another table restroom BEFORE little sister did even pushing way  guess she REALLY needed use restroom  <EOR> Love all good places China Town opening SW  Food great service well  Max server idk you'd call um lol  decor inside really nice  lunch little disappointed couldn't kalbi its only dinner item  <EOR> The interior clean nicely decorated  No wait time all since recently just opened  place could include bit more variety tapas  beef brisket pork shoulder great! Shoutout server Adrian gave such awesome service  He constantly checked made sure properly cared for  <EOR> This far but try since love Tofu Hut excited since place new they're second branch  Nice set vent nice cuz lower dont cook smoke all over face  clean modern more spacious  salad same bomb ever  2 extra dipping sauce aside standard oil salt pepper  server didn't explain but when asked explained well  Lady server bit stingy giving ask she worried can't finish it  male server good provided more she gives us  side dishes wasnt good original Tofu Hut though  Glad tried it  <EOR> Honestly many Korean bbq's life  food location very good gonna lie  Everything marinated properly food tastes fantastic  But service very good  servers started very nice but when ask more meats annoyed frustrated  should Korean bbq  place seriously enforces time limit think  load crap enforce time limit if takes them 10 15 minutes bring just plate meat  Isn't funny once tell kicking suddenly become nicer again    Hmm    <EOR> The menu bit limited but quality food really good  server Adrian awesome made sure didn't wait anything  definitely return  <EOR> Updating review 5 stars since changing table review addressed  really love place esp  salad  Although just hwaro same price realized doh doesnt much offer menu 20$ all eat kbbq meat  still satisfies craving when don't feel driving all way chinatown  staff also super friendly <EOR> I must say very excited when heard Korean BBQ place offering All Eat opening area  excited I'd frequently pass peak window see if open  basically near Serenade Gelatology Rice n Noodles south Rainbow   Well good news they're now open all area South West general no more long drives Chinatown indulge AYCE Korean BBQ only stuck food coma worrying getting home   bad news service needs improvement but understandable new business  mean anything  just needed occasional nudge reminder ordered something never need more food water etc  came around change grill often pretty slow bringing food out    They 3 AYCE options Lunch $16 95 Dinner $19 95 Dinner II $23 95 basically only difference besides price time day you're adding boneless short ribs Dinner  you're adding ORDER PER PERSON 6 8 oz rib eye prime Dinner II  They'll bring some sides kim chi start but you'd pay extra more    I wanna say don't many selections 5 beefs brisket tongue bulgogi boneless shortribs rib eye 4 porks two pork bellies shoulder bulgogi 2 chickens spicy mild bulgogi 2 seafoods head shrimp squid   enjoyed beef short ribs pork shoulder red wine pork belly  Everything else ok    You don't eat AYCE but seems pretty much once buy 2 orders meat you've paid AYCE   The interior nice  vent system good sucking all smoke but because low right above grill way  can't really see person front without looking under around vent  guess good if you're yourself don't want everyone else see you  <EOR> The worst kbbq ever life!! Horrible quality 23! beef part really disappointed! Dun even wanna try pork having beef part squid  only thing taste good steam eggs SAD <EOR> It's ok  many choices far looking for  wanted intestines only tongue available  least curbed Korean Bbq craving <EOR> ***Yelp Challenge 2016 3 100***  After sons wrestling match decided eat here  thought being part Doh Sushi quality food equivalent surpass other spots  EH OK  tongue very chewy  pork belly bulgogi OK   The pros near house  all eat packed  Service also point  Kudos great customer service! <EOR> We way different restaurant when found Doh glad stopped instead    We park couple blocks away could smell amazing aromas Doh minute truck  Once realized where coming abandoned original plans favor Doh    This first experience Korean Barbecue  Doh won over immediately  opted all eat taste all varieties meats available  all tried pork belly squid shrimp bulgogi brisket ribeye  All fabulous  Korean salad dipping sauces perfect compliment  pleasantly surprised value considering generous portions    Staff very knowledgable we Adrian he very helpful explaining things making recommendations    Doh must visit  <EOR> My roommates EXCITED new Korean BBQ place opening hood  Especially sister restaurant Tofu Hut regular spots KBBQ  Unfortunately terrible first experience last week    As soon walked charmed cute interior  But five minutes later server acknowledged existence door  avoiding any possible eye contact scurrying around restaurant  All expected greeting some sort upon entering restaurant maybe hint long wait is  no other customers waiting table three empty tables available time    I'm reasonable person understand opening new restaurant probably very stressful hopefully they're trying work some kinks training blah blah  waited patiently relatively happy camper once food started arriving  Once less hangry started thinking positives great banchan romaine cabbage salad tasty boneless short ribs solid rice lol  Things going swell despite obvious flirting between older female waitresses table drunk gentlemen next apparently older waitress glasses SINGLE all lucky dogs other married sorry    At point half plates bulgogi short ribs brisket table still powering through  single waitress glasses came around check bff stated I'd order something please which waitress briskly responds DIDN'T FINISH WANT ORDER MORE? What  The    First all bff just wanted steamed egg  ordering extra helpings meat  Second all   ALL EAT  don't know me    You could tell she felt guilty jumping conclusions but no redemption point  also forgot bring last plate beef tongue ordered but then over it    Overall meat inconsistently marinated edible but nothing rave about  Banchan decent  Service obviously lacking  would gladly drive further location better experience  <EOR> I really excited ayce kbbq opening close house since dont driving chinatown all time kbbq  girlfriend came first time last night less satisfactory experience  took them while take order even bring anything  beef brisket dry other meats just ok  didn't brisket sauce couldnt give extra salad dressing because its already mixed in  guess  anyway probably continue trip chinatown Kbbq unless place steps bit  <EOR> Very friendly staff really good cuts meat! love when cook meat but friend prefers doing himself lol  definitely back  <EOR> Being Korean barbecue lover quite disappointing  decorations set very attractive but place grand opening business model needs big change  half order meat left we're finishing before given check made payment server came back say eat last piece charge because there's cameras  very rude tell server when walk can't miss face just shows ignorant she terms service  food marinated well vegetable trays obviously sitting because macaroni mayonnaise  crusty all know mayonnaise spoils quickly   For new establishment should providing extra service extra food entice new business  reading several reviews find appalling management would allow knowing already run successful business previously  back until reviews improved regarding service quality food although live really close drive down spring mountain  <EOR> i came very low expectations because Tofu Hut many times always left feeling disappointed albeit satisfied  but dont want just satisfied want feel good meal want enjoy dining  Upon entering Doh immediately pleasantly surprised because hostess greeted right away sat us  server Adrian sp? very adequate nice but he seemed bit overwhelmed since restaurant full think could use couple more servers ease load work faster  food itself good signature tofu hut salad deed crack havent experienced myself but imagine its expression most fitting brisket thin soft juicy beef tongue great texture red wine pork belly delicious kalbi also tender juicy  overall flavor great  coming back because its very close house but still think now Hwaro best Vegas  <EOR> I'm probably minority when say haven't Tofu Hot before trying Doh Korean BBQ  however eaten plenty other Korean BBQ places Vegas California oh gosh place good    Honestly made fall love place its layout seating options  interior very charming  Although aren't great deal decorations decorations nice laid back atmosphere  restaurant maximum capacity 99 people relatively spaced seats its customers  Aside standard tables middle room three booths facing middle room customers watch music videos projected wall while sit booth talk  Each booth seat 6 7 people comfortably    The technology obviously geared towards serving Korean BBQ  vents brand new moved very close grill making less smoke most other Korean BBQ places  minimizes distinct Korean BBQ smell tends linger people's clothing long leave restaurant which definite plus      My friends came during lunch when only two servers present server excellent He answered any questions menu checked regular basis fast fulfill any requests had  busier towards 4 PM but server remained attentive throughout eating experience   We ordered briskets porkbelly marinated bulgogi beef  thought salad little bit salty but both friends loved it  side dishes plentiful yummy  Overall food good  wow never had meat amazing good but good enough worth $17 99 lunch opinion   On another note sure dessert here  When asked if dessert server told mochi ice cream just came today but hadn't decided price yet he suggested Gelatology same plaza dessert  guess Doh Korean BBQ hasn't figured all menu items yet  Hopefully there'll updates soon      So far Doh Korean BBQ off very promising start  glad another future go to food joint neighborhood  <EOR> Food just same All eat Korean BBQ  service good but  seating arrangements good idea  <EOR> Ive 4 5 Korean BBQ Vegas place good any them  relatively new very busy yet  place very nice clean inside  early day only 16 99 ayce  Later dinner believe $21 99 ayce  Ask Jeanie your waitress she best! <EOR> Great food Great service great ambience     What else need? am happy more choices when comes Koran BBQ Doh's BBQ first choice   Two thumbs me  <EOR> My boyfriend tried place last night 1 29 16 definitely its ups downs  Upon walking sat 5 minutes  only server working time Ryan  Ryan great very attentive explained menu everything worked since new particular kbbq spot  ordered brisket beef tongue beef bulgogi red wine pork belly steamed egg  only first round  Every thing ordered came timely tasted great good fat meat ratio  wish could said same second half order brisket orders 60% fat  trim down scissors  also noticed half way through meal server left home guess because another woman attended didn't catch name  Most places when server leaves say something introduce server taking over table but oh well  other server very nice but she alone lot fresh table take care own    Overall best but also worst experience kbbq place  <EOR> Was excited KBBQ place opened Southwest area better yet no long wait lines compared other places like Gen    two visits guess long wait line won't ever issue   We lunch during first visit found non BBQ lunch menu quite limited   Basically stews soups surprisingly no soon dubu go figure    few ban chan side dishes usually favorite parts eating Korean food disappointing   least them kimchi suppose   Decided try place again dinner AYCE BBQ   Long story short meat salad good plus there's usual selection would want brisket bugolgi galbi not bone in beef tongue pork belly   There's option pay extra Dinner Menu 2 which guess includes rib eye steak something each person   Everything else underwhelming   AYCE KBBQ dinner did include steamed egg but soybean soup stew heck side dishes again limited mention absence rice paper radish paper hot sauce     All aside sealed place's fate reason why I'd think twice coming back  automatic 18% gratuity party 4    pretty aggressive opinion   Though clearly stated menu gratuity added parties 6 more apparently recently decided change 4 note place just opened month ago    Somehow just irks me   Next  <EOR> With newest AYCE Korean BBQ places just hop skip jump away favorite gelato shop knew I'd trying place sooner later  ended being more later  Originally advertised Tofu Hut restaurant group behind place several others decided brand Doh Korean BBQ opening  certainly looked clean inviting inside when first wandered check decor menu  took time getting around though but finally cajoled friend into joining lunchtime today   The menu items prices double digits might well all eat  AYCE offerings lunch $16 95 only available until 3 00 pm dinner $19 95 including marinated boneless short rib dinner II $23 95 including one per person rib eye   wanted chance try all options chose dinner II even though could've stuck lunch pricing   Ventilation quiet vertically adjustable fan could way eye contact  changed grill plates quickly provided good timely service contrary some anecdotes heard  Perhaps lucky perhaps service improved   They brought rib eye first  huge piece meat little unwieldy cook evenly grill because uneven heating  tasty beef but didn't find enticing enough such would order again   My companion ordered beef brisket mean time good any other AYCE KBBQ brisket  good portion two people   I marinated boneless short rib next around same time friend ordered marinated sliced rib eye bulgogi  both pretty decent but surprised short rib seemed fall apart little readily  don't mean tender way either  Having tried dinner I II options I'd say lunch would sufficient if arrive before 3pm   Sliced black pork belly beef tongue final options  pork belly good but didn't stand out  beef tongue plate held massive portion would sufficient four people tongue sliced thin cooked seconds   I more impressed sides condiments meats  banchan included delicious crunchy kimchi really delicious macaroni salad corn raisins pickled radish onion late addition ddukbokki more pleasant chew well known nearby restaurant  dipping meats nice salt pepper oil fermented bean paste both which work modest amounts  sliced jalapeño sliced garlic very modest mostly ignored them  side salad somewhat sweet dressing standard fare  steamed egg bowl fluffy delicious  Skip vegetable tempura though  strange mix thinly sliced julienned veggies ton breading   In hypothetical world where isn't awesome gelato same plaza wouldn't across town solely Doh Korean BBQ  But can't say didn't enjoy meal and hard give fewer 4 stars limitless meat smorgasbord   good neighborhood option if want endless meat don't mind quality variety reduction compared barstaurant just down street  <EOR> When first heard going part Doh group wasn't particularly interested trying it  tried Doh AYCE sushi location Chinatown didn't exactly amaze fan Tofu Hut either  However just craving some Korean BBQ meats didn't want drive all way Chinatown boyfriend decided give Doh try    The interior definitely cute  very clean organized inside  three round tables sit 4 5 people  They're huge round tables actually remind small round tables you'll see Hong Kong street stalls  three booths along side wall  well they're more box wall where sit   kind cute  vents pretty amazing  vents adjustable lowered all way down just above grill but your way staring your partner  your meal able adjust back won't your face  Best part? don't leave restaurant smelling KBBQ  WIN! IT    If AYCE two options $19 95 $23 95  $23 95 dinner allows order rib eye steak but order per person  Now completely allowed did ordered $19 95 dinner boyfriend ordered $23 95 dinner shared rib eye  Because let's real don't stomach eat two rib eyes everything else    The banchan included kimchi ddukbokki macaroni salad pickled daikon  kimchi delicious  delicious even second serving it  probably some best kimchi Vegas  also nice addition able some ddukbokki considering part your usual banchan combo  also huge bowl salad well    Everyone salt pepper sesame oil sauce meat dipping which LOVE  many places usually ask but auto gave everyone here! also give fermented soybean paste which don't use but appreciate thought  Then also small side garlic jalapenos definitely ate those  definitely shows they're pretty traditional condiments    We ended ordering brisket beef tongue kalbi pork belly steamed egg  Let begin telling portions no joke  isn't Gen BBQ where give 4 5 pieces kalbi beef tongue per order  gave plate full brisket plate full beef tongue three strips kabi ask them only give strip pork belly    Their brisket normal  Beef tongue bit chewier side but still good  kalbi really good  marinate wasn't intensely sweet  Pork belly also decent  egg pretty fluffy would great rice    The service excellent  would often check able answer every questions  If no meat cook would ask if would order more meat  Wonderful Overall think Doh pretty good  price point definitely better lot KBBQ places Las Vegas  only downside lack variety    however typically only eat brisket beef tongue during KBBQ definitely downside me  meat quality definitely best but worst either    I would definitely back  Count it  <EOR> My first time great experience probably cause only customers but Ryan really good server  food taste good well! kinda far but I'd def come again cause don't wait hours kbbq! <EOR> I am happy opened right down road me! lived Korea year food met all expectations  Absolutely delicious! Hopefully put some desserts menu  <EOR> I love tofu hut closer side town! service amazing  refilled cooked always checked sure okay! All meats different but pork shoulder bomb recommended us  Yum!   The only downside menu says 6 include gratuity but only 4 added gratuity  Otherwise good  <EOR> Very friendly staff   Clean tidy place  salad fantastic    meats would expect AYCE buffet    marinated beef short rib best   tender well marinated damn good   steamed egg well done ended ordering three them     I wish would fried rice rather just plain white rice   definitely missing component   Overall good experience decent alternative Spring Mountain those live south side town  <EOR> Very good prompt service  Refilled all sides checked frequently    Grill changed regular interval   Overall best town   salad far he best any KBBQ Vegas  <EOR> Yay finally Korean bbq near where live   gave place two stars despite being new    sister tofu hut would think would more experience handling everything    Waited while servers meat ok definitely need more ban Chan tho   Hopefully next time it'll better   <EOR> I came first time last week because friends decided should something since all haven't hung while  them suggested Korean BBQ but didn't want take bus all way Tofu Hut  Then another suggested place since he found opened recently  Needless say ready go  came seated immediately  hostess kind made sure everything needed  ordered beef rib eye bulgolgi OH MAN good  couldn't stop eating it! literally all fought each other chop sticks some  waiters came ever often help refill meat supply change grill  Korean music videos play also very entertaining  indeed little pricey when coming larger group people but know coming next time opportunity to  <EOR> This place amazing customer service *came right when opened* super friendly waiter around craving kinda skeptical when saw limited menu but truth told good might back next time there <EOR> The newest addition KBBQ binge eating days itinerary if ever did see one    My friends told step Doh Tofu Hut Spring Mountain used frequent  most part did disappoint whatsoever  may other side town but food experience definitely worth travel expense    Service quick + super friendly + highly personable   We didn't wait long seated even nine people  staff very accommodating guys waited group nine hilarious  also really sweet ahjumma would come around sure everything okay if wanted more rice  Otherwise family sit down type service where your own cooking meats provided typical any KBBQ place      Atmosphere comfortable + relaxing   We sat long bench two grills opposite ends which effective serving such large group  overall decor modern twist rustic country look interesting projector feature main fixture against brick wall where watch Korean music videos throughout experience too  when you're eating option entertainment background which cool too     Pricing semi decent + worth it  It's worth if stick all eat options lunch dinners  good steal considering good quality meats seasonings provided alongside unlimited servings other side dishes rice bowls  person paid dinner $22 including tip  <EOR> Our favorite place eat just closer  already came 4 times since They opened   really bad <EOR> Yay fermented soybean! love place close home  huge menu but more need when everything great  Ask RYAN!! <EOR> Saw reviews Yelp decided give try  glad did love Korean bbq    Fast service friendly staff very clean awesome food    Price very reasonable all eat  definitely visiting again  <EOR> Like many others super excited try place since close home aren't any kbbq that know of except Chinatown    Came super dead  party 3 only 2 wanted AYCE since third person going party soon but wanted hang maybe grab just drink  Told waiter she said would charge extra sitting same table us  guess  understandable since don't want risk people trying sneak freebies  Anywho ordered brisket spicy chicken bulgogi beef tongue steamed egg   Service fast since just another table  However brought chicken brisket along oil thing? thought piece lard something  She just set middle stove left   I wasn't sure if supposed touch cuz she didn't really say anything  just placing chicken stove then she comes back says Awww going start brisket first since cooks fast Oops  But supposed know when didn't explain anything? thought she just gonna hand meat over let thang!?!
