I've reading anticipating opening Chada few weeks   reading some online news knew restaurants must try   pleasantly surprised see open last Friday while driving past area   owner read sommelier Lotus Siam   When walked could definitely see case   Wine bottle labels adorned wall   full wall wine racks still sit empty   restaurant feels new but seem off good start   waitress very courteous attentive throughout meal but could tell she new job   food arrived slowly   only able finish chicken satay due flight catch   satay descent   thought chicken looked more baked grilled   Pad mee prik kang took go   little more oily side but very tasty   Although impressed first visit definitely would  return try other dishes  <EOR> OMG!  am glad Chada West Side LV   am huge Lotus fan but Lotus far recently variable   While brings same memory first time Lotus food vibe completely different   Casual but demurely hip if KWIM   With its clean lines simple color palate grey red Chada reminds simple modern start restaurants NYC   that nice look   While very big place seat 40 people comfortably    As point Chada does liquor license no alcohol served   did take advantage courtesy BYOB no corkage fee!  However look forward wine selection future though    The menu style all small plates but portions equivalent atleast 1 5 main dish servings  hope doesn't change because dish prices range extremely affordable ranging $6 18 most dishes averaging $8 12   Some fish beef dishes higher price ranges but well worth it   My husband spring rolls which $6 4 rolls   pretty reasonable   4 oysters chili sauce mint $8 crispy pork belly sauteed greens choy something $10? Seabass Tod Krueng phenomenal   extremely tasty unique generous portion even $18 sauteed ribeye fish sauce   While execution still bit slow made nice relaxing meal while sipped favorite wines   Every dish prepared beautifully   can't wait come back try all other dishes too   A few things   tell establishment new servers still learning menu but polite  menu lack organization but good thing because look through entire menu  Once ordered dishes came bit lag time between but again really gave each dish time enjoyed   can't wait back better soon because know Chada's popularity going skyrocket height deserves   Congrats Chada Westsiders something just special if better Lotus closer home  <EOR> The Skinny bland pad thai but overall okay cuisine 2 5 service poor complained under cooked item restaurant staff ignored issue altogether 1 value although food okay lilliputian sized dishes exorbitant prices place no go     oh yeah also charge $1 rice 2    My hubby scouring online all new restaurants going hit Las Vegas hit Chada Thai tapas style Thai food joint  Opened former employee Lotus Siam place immediate need list  opening day believe first customers restaurant  FYI John Curtas just edged before us     Now let straight little leery when someone tells tapas place  Because brain translates we're going give 50% less food  but only reduce price 20% 'share' try more things  FOS total cash grab marketing scheme which Chada Thai no exception  ordered approximately 10 items 3 people including two $1 bowls  rice which charged extra for which ended being $82 16 pre tip left restaurant hungry  Yeah left f king hungry s *ting gold f *king bricks afterwards   We ordered two vegetable dishes grilled eggplant dish stir fried mushroom dish  grilled eggplant $8 consisted half eggplant marinated kind green papaya salad type dressing  flavor combination nice however grilled eggplant little bit tough texturally  stir fried mushrooms $8 consistent 2 3 different mushrooms sliver lotus root 1 brussel sprout mixed in  heard 1 brussel sprout  little wok hai dish hence dish swimming much liquid  flavor alright but nothing special   The braised pork belly $8 nice melt your mouth texture good flavor  However only 5 small slices meat around   The kai tod garlic fried chicken good $10 surprisingly more reasonably priced items menu  actually gave large portion cornish game hen  meat itself tender while outside crispy well seasoned   Pad see ew $6 better dishes night good flavor some good crisping rice noodles  pad thai $7 though worst dishes  little unusual rice noodle dish completely encased omelet but it  omelet little bit tough overcooked egg while noodles completely bland  recommended   We also ordered steamed sea bass plum sauce $18 which found little sweet tastes  would order again   Massaman curry $9 nice flavor however devoid any real amount vegetables meat stew  Literally 2 chicken drumsticks half raw small potato perhaps half onion   Oh raw potato  informed manager owner? potato dish raw  response but chicken cooked right?   Yes  it  He did offer correct problem even acknowledged issue all long chicken cooked   He didn't even offer apology incorrectly cooked food  poor customer service speaks inexperience staff work there   Although appreciate opening night say really hit miss quality Thai food I would perhaps maybe 3 8 items ordered again over top pricing small portions would probably return  However added poor service response would recommend avoiding place f *king bubonic plague  2 starred review   At time didn't liquor license but allowed BYOB without charging corkage fees  Woop de doo  <EOR> New place opened same plaza Q Karaoke Icy Juicy HK Star  Apparently opened Sommelier Lotus Siam    We kind late 10 30PM Thursday evening   two other groups there  restaurant designed nicely nice atmosphere  Left wall designed framed wine labels  Far end restaurant coming into restaurant wine rack    The restaurant designed contemporary style white dinnerware square plates oddly shaped bowls etc We seated served water  water container no ice  sure describe container but its something sometimes see korean place flavored soju  plastic cork cap metal thing u pull away lift take off cap  XD   We ordered 3 things  Miang Pou Lettuce wrap w crab meat ginger roasted coconut peanuts lime onion Tom Kah Kai Coconut soup mushroom chicken Kai Tod Fried half cornish hen w garlic bowl rice side $1 extra included Starting off Miang Pou lettuce wrap   refer picture presentation reference   wraps 5 oriented around plate star shot glass middle filled sauce  Each portion little each ingredient baby leaf romaine like lettuce  note listed ingredient list above each portion small thai chili piece if u cant eat spicy dont eat it   sauce included little too? citrusy sour probably lime probably contained sauce made peanuts lime onions  some odd reason something bitter wrap but couldn't pinpoint may been    Next would Tom Kah Kai  served large bowl  some other thai restaurants where served sterno heated pot  soup also little citrusy sour  flavorful but both friend would prefer more rich more coconut milk vs sourness  Decent amount ingredients  Still delicious when eating alone rice !  Last but least Kai Tod  actually most delicious dish 3  nicely fried  breading light crispy  thick  meat hen juicy flavorful  eating piece hen noticed seasoning actually inserted between meats around  Maybe little heavy black pepper but still good  i black pepper anyway   approx 6 7 decent sized pieces  Wish put more fried garlic i love garlic ! Overall ok experience  lettuce wrap kind seemed little expensive much get  little saddened soup like   Wished menu little bigger but food wasn't bad  Service decent  Price ok  Little more expensive average thai restaurant  <EOR> It's same plaza Icy Juicy right across 168 Supermarket  Next karaoke place   It very quiet deserted like 2 other tables when came around 1030pm   waiter very nice pretty prompt  those dim lighting environments   The menu just pretty much two pages  big fan prices  3 ordered three dishes split between us  You'd definitely order more full   WHAT ORDERED Miang Pou $9 Lettuce Wraps  There's 5 small pieces lettuce wraps tapa size  going fulfilling price  bit spicy okay but nothing special  crab meat ginger roasted coconut peanut chili lime onions   Tom Kah Kai $8  coconut soup w chicken mushroom don't forget some rice $1 per bowl   Nothing special me   Kai Tod $7  fried half Cornish hen w garlic best thing 3  I'd definitely again   Overall decent enough but nothing really stood me  Just A OK  good thing place hours come 12am eat since don't close till 3am  don't liquor license yet though  <EOR> Went new spot few coworkers work  herd great place try but bring own alcohol because liquor license being valid yet  brought 3 bottles nice Reisling no problems popping them us   We ordered around 12 items menu  unanimous winners Pork Belly  delicious perfectly prepared  also enjoyed Beef Jerky Wild Mushroom App Lettuce Wraps Coconut Ginger    The worst them all far Strip steak which extremely overcooked!
