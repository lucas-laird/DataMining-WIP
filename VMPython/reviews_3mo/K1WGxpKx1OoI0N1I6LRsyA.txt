Fries extremely salty  No thanks  Also worth price  I returning <EOR> Quickee Burgers? More Yucky Burgers     Let explain  saw advertised Facebook intrigued  thinking couldnt any worse White Castle right? Well same tastewise but happened experience laughable   Let's start initial visit  open mind wanted see if better WC  If refer pictures look eerily similar WC pics  QB #2 which 3 sliders fries drink 5 99  bad deal  Since wanted try chicken slider requested burgers substituted  point cashier asked owner whose name Michael if possible  He agreed said upcharge which understandable  First impression thought he seemed pretty nice  Until he started joking around he would only if hooked any Asian lady friends  wasnt offended first but conversation thought kind awkward   So fast forward meal  If refer pictures look taste same WC  fries sucked  dry salty  couldnt seem find anything appealing meal  only thing warranted praise coke machine lot soda choices chicken slider kind decent meaning able finish it  Im sorry coudnt say same regular slider  bite struggled swallow it   When left mind 2 star review  Well here's happened  before started doing review  saw ad again Facebook  He basically offering people free brown bag lunch if  selected tagging somebody  Well commented didnt think slider any better WC chicken slider ok  Minutes later comment removed blocked commenting  If cant handle truth guess block person speaks it? Well then try blocking dude  All did worse  Instead two stars lost one  If going owner need learn deal constructive criticism  Instead delete comment based off some people told eating way treat your customers rude inapropriate found myself  proof also your replies some reviews here    In closing whatever sliver hope coming back recommending friends gone  matter fact fair if friends ask tell them try first then talk  intention put business but if your product good treat your customers rudely dont surprised if nobody shows up  would say 6 months check some recent legit reviews  If looks improved then just might come back verify  wanted try shakes but rude service always negate that  Until then try blocking review dude   Yelp 2015 review #14  513 overall Aint no quickie worth crappy attitude <EOR> So don't answer phones then 5 30 sign says they're closed 5 6 well would nice know that    Won't returning haven't even tried food  <EOR> I read place Yelp really wanted try it   Even though White Castle Vegas place very close house love going new restaurants   admit bit scared negative reviews sociopathic replies owner both Yelp pages two Quickee locations seriously guy appears step away being owners Amy's Baking Company    The first things noticed when lunchtime weekday place no customers some tables only 1 seat while others 2 3 4 seats everything impeccably clean   I ordered cheeseburger chicken sandwich fries   First off anyone says taste White Castle wrong  burgers need taste White Castle good   White Castle sliders thin beef covers whole light airy bun   Quickee sliders slightly thicker beef patty does fully cover bun which bit thicker well   burger very bland dry dominated taste American cheese it   bigger patty better seasoning would wonders   The chicken sandwich tasted better first but must gotten bad because 3 pretty big pieces gristle it   fries good  no complaints here   All in all I'd say experience slightly below average   probably won't back again unless significant change quality burgers chicken  <EOR>
