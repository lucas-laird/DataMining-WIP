Had dinner last night friend until morning 3 am would given place 4 stars but 3 am she threw all dinner sick bed all day   know Vegas but can't blame alcohol neither drank last night nor did eat anything else left restaurant   She's all signs food poisoning   Which really sucks because we're town attend conference paid pockets now she's missed full day sessions   We're praying she'll feel better tomorrow   far best she small sips Gatorade   She ordered pasta dish think house specials   pretty sure listed ingredients might egg yolk   Looking back now seems odd why list egg yolk unless raw which case heck?  She thinks she remembers seeing but time giving much thought    The location amazing right across Bellagio fountain    far dinner okay   ordered spinach artichoke dip which best ever had   main course fillet which cooked exactly ordered medium but bit dry lacking any flavor other when pepper dusted before cooking happened touch tongue   very small dollop 'steak sauce' plate suppose incase pepper didn't work   tasted sauce nothing rave I'd prefer something better homemade A 1   This space used occupied Sugar Factory    really hoping eat there   wasn't until made trek Mandalay realized Sugar Factory gone   Another small positive note Hexx just opened literally   think last Friday Feb 27th first night   place still fairly empty 7 30 pm Monday night     Might empty because new might empty because friend isn't only spent next day puking dinner   I visit Vegas lot keep eye Yelp reviews see if one time fluke   Bottom line should here?  If want great view fountain fabulous spinach dip give shot   Just stay far away anything else menu might sick if cooked prepared properly   Good luck! <EOR> The best chicken waffles husband ever had!  wish ordered them instead because kept sneaking bites food P  waffles pieces bacon batter syrup bourbon   Bacon bourbon   how could wrong?!  If ever back Vegas first stop breakfast    I ordered steak eggs which really good too   only reason didn't give restaurant 5 stars because ordered steak medium rare wasn't pink all   never send food back but price steak want cooked properly   When waiter brought second steak much better   Also breakfast potatoes perfectly crisp eggs perfectly poached    restaurant just opened last week minor quirks but suggest give chance   Don't forget order amazing chicken waffles <EOR> They may Hexxed   Hmmm    Lets just say brand new strip   good   Isaac manager kind enough visit apologize poor service mis marked prices high end sprits  He wouldn't fix problem  If turned off greeters may be     Since charging $51 per shot $18 tequila Bellagio back Bellagio  happy pay $100 glass good stuff  <EOR> This place took over sugar factory quite confused when there  group wanted fish bowls sugar factory  weren't going until hostesses outside explained just opened also fishbowl type drink uses fresh fruit instead candy  decided give try if don't want eat directly bar  some long tables area didn't anywhere stand sit when first in  some tables alongside glass wall when first turn but didn't know if could sit there  No asked assisted just sat there  Those two tables really bar's line sight no came give menu anything  ended walking bar order drinks  stood good 5 minutes waiting helped while bartenders just passed by  finally flagged them down Apparently won't come unless actually wave them   ordered two big fruit martinis peach raspberry mango orange   When brought table asked 2 more straws 4 people   never brought them friends back bar some   The mango orange really sweet but enjoyed peach raspberry  peach sake soju cocktail flavor  good amount alcohol them too   Our bartender came tell much didn't give check   just amount   This place just opened hopefully they'll some changes  <EOR> Technically ate while transition  dinner Feb 26th day before truly became Hexx  Since no longer giant Goblet try  girls opted Mega Martini  Loved it! berry mojito sight see  !
