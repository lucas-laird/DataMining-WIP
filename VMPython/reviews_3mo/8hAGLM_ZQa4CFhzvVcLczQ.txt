Interesting  Luckily plenty yummy sounding items try  ordered baked BBQ 1 2 chicken Maple n Bacon Baked Beans Homemade cornbread baked cheddar mac n cheese  While waiting lights dimmed down started flickering annoyingly  staff seemed notice but nothing done could done remedy this  biscuits order menu but FYI bring basket them before your food  found hair biscuit which happens but off great start far  weren't huge fan these  Kind hard very warm all   did notice looked heart shape which if loved! corn bread came way before rest food skillet but completely cold  Would preferred warm served rest meal  chicken delicious! Juicy soft just good  would nice small dish BBQ sauce dip but far best thing ordered  baked beans slices sausage which welcoming surprise  give beans thumbs along chicken  mac n cheese way rich both but just taste  Some people might really into that  All sides served miniature stoneware which adorable  end weren't super impressed food but back try soup banana pudding sure! <EOR> Ok First all atmosphere amazing! stopped bite eat some comfort food     food AMAZEBALLS!!! ribs which meat fell off bone  pulled pork which equally delicious  biscuits honey butter OMG heaven  big drinker but Long Island ice tea best ever  top things off shared banana fosters pudding  Let tell BEYOND words  Absolutely delicious nice hip spot southern comfort food  wil definitely back  nice type place Las Vegas  <EOR> Disappointed  looking forward great lunch but came away unimpressed   Shrimp sandwich tasted breaded frozen type corn meal coating  several items many new place  Biscuits delicious  stick Cantina Brio when Tivoli  <EOR> My boyfriend gone tivoli village eat different restaurant but soon realized closed  Such bummer!

All around great spot good service  good atmosphere southern feeling  <EOR> I wanted love place! huge fan chef Stratta  many years   But going quote Grandfather If nothing nice say don't  say thus    that's review    #sosad <EOR> Quickly taking over short lived Tapas Alex Stratta may come concept more staying power its predecessor  Serving classic American fare southern comfort food new spot addresses Tapas's two biggest issues price portion size  Entrees all under $20 portions only entrees but apps large enough satisfy most appetites  some overlap concept neighbor few doors down  Made LV  but spot takes things farther down south bulk menu    I dined Salt 'n Pepper during opening week evident still finding way  Warm biscuits honey butter dense thick dry  Without asking kitchen sent second batch because weren't happy first left kitchen  good see chefs care much although second round doughy liking   They've kid's menu 4 large crispy tenders kid loved accompanied thick cut fries   Always sucker chicken 'n waffles try version  drumstick two thighs exterior each coated thin crispy crust aggressively seasoned pepper  Less successful soft pliable sweet potato waffle failed hold weight chicken  Topping off maple syrup excellent hot sauce enough heat stir palate without destroying it   Both desserts sampled traditional takes classics  red velvet cake pecan pie bourbon sour cream   pair may pushed any culinary boundaries but executed well   There minor changes interior but looks similar Tapas  Still spot  seen Greek Asian fusion Spanish now Southern interior looks good shape  some fine tuning Salt 'n Pepper chance last longer any those  <EOR> Food great! Service fantastic live entertainment perfect! back  <EOR> No! No no no!! Why oh why would yourselves Salt n' Pepper? Your adorable signage really great live entertainment quality service simply could your terrible product  being sarcastic when say didn't market research? begin Lucilles just down street  Lucilles  place where 90% things listed your menu better price better quality bigger portions better flavor  Also you're marketing patrons Tivoli village  people Tivoli looking upscale least unique dining experiences  Finally did consider fact you're opening restaurant Las Vegas place where world class dining experiences available 24 7 nearly anywhere go? I'm just confused why would start dining experience laminated piece paper clearly printed off your home computer call your menu? Really its first thing your guests see  Then under cook complementary biscuits? Those really important items set tone whole dining experience  think several restaurants say ohh lets complementary _______ bread biscuits chips etc  delicious  Luckily all warning signs time entree arrived prepared worst  rubbery maybe 3 oz chicken breast sandwich store bought bun tasted something could prepared 5 minutes George Foreman grill  Members family suffered through catfish still swimming swimming sauce is pulled pork sandwich admit pulled pork Costco   I say cob fried chicken pecan salad decent  Thank goodness  culinary south known right salad? Where roll eye emoji when need it?! So  Why am being mean?
