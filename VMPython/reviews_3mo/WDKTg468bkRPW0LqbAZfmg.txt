Everything nice experience! think bartender nice girl but very slow no muti tasking skills acknowledge surroundings! 50 mins sugar factory bartender only talked twice beginning end check! Never apologize delay food! <EOR> So pleased see Sugar Factory off Strip  meal wonderful! came Sunday brunch  Fantastic service start finish even when slight delay waffles  bottomless mimosas $20  Tons flavors fave wild berry but husband mom preferred wild orange ones  waffles delicious! mom never finishes meal she killed egg breakfast  husband raved smoked salmon Eggs Benedict  But really best part meal server Matt  He fantastic!

I raved Sugar Factory veggie burger other location beyond stoked would more easily accessible location Town Square  Finally place gourmet burgers love with!   I never visit location again because am mad ruined birthday serving lazy garden burger then executing poorly top that  know vegetarians aren't major focus business model but if going bother putting anything your menu vegetarians should half hearted effort elevate standard slop any bar Denny's 1 3 price  Then calling Ultimate veggie burger? Please  insulting serve restaurant claim gourmet     Let clear understand restaurants change recipes menus  totally it  But isn't menu change bait switch  promised ultimate burger but given crap readily available supermarket less $2  didn't cook heated up  Infuriating   The server very nice but inexperienced  No found suspicious didn't eat ultimate veggie burger  basically led believe location cheap reproduction real thing am both starving unimpressed    Afterthought phones actually did work while don't know if block service jammer if Town Square just crowded    however don't think your phone working enhances meal experience  Maybe should call ultimate internet? Boo place ultimate fail  <EOR> Passion punch     loved kick alcohol but tasting drink  only suggestion oranges blood oranges use colorful straws  Other love outdoor option atmosphere  <EOR> Alcohol + sugar + sugar   most some sweet cocktails totally thing but vibe kind neat   staff super friendly   If ask drinks less sweet   Happy hour all day monday brings prices into reasonable range   Small beer selection 4 5 drafts think? <EOR> Great happy hour half off everything!  The regular burger great mini sliders appetizer very small but still good  More flavors goblet drinks Town Square strip  goblet red bull delicious   Must try  <EOR> Didn't want come first place food justified why    While nothing wrong service food sub par    cheap ingredients overpriced you're getting  Pass  <EOR>
