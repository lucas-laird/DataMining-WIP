Joke      Oh btw     having couple bites burger more undercooked sloppy joe  seriously no clue any idea thing stayed together      Seriously people just some pissy bitter person snooty cashier decided write review  writing don't waste 10 bucks did  People work hard valley fake ass people opening called health food joints anything but that     Huge disappointment HUGE  even mentions looking them yelp when first walked in   Clueless someone succeed people working them running business <EOR> This place freakin awesome  Everything cooked fresh order food delicious  Everyone info super healthy all nutrition info right menu  All staff super friendly even brought kids loved well  come multiple times week now  glad opened finally! <EOR> The food great staff extremely friendly!
