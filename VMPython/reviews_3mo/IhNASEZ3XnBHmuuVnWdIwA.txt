True  But all high praise rave place ridiculous me  overrated    Let's talk boba  Boba inconsistent  softer side sometimes soft mushy  use longan honey boba which nice but sweet  Honey boba dissolve drink  Perhaps asking them rinse boba good choice    CONCLUSION Personally trying +5 drinks safely say place isn't really cup tea  <EOR> Forget any other boba spot town   BrewTeaBoys this    I'm usually picking caffeinated concoction before work while always BTB never really content drink because other places sweet when specifically asked adjustment   hint sweetness ok but anymore irritating   guys knows exactly drinks first try too!

Would back probably  But won't drive way there   guy made tea really nice cashier just really hustled which wasn't cool all  <EOR> ***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 72 100***  Admittedly biggest boba fan before late become quite boba monstah alternately going between BTB original preferred place Kung fu tea  BTB quite edge now due outstanding service Dennis  He's always guide thru orders helping figure want offers suggestions along way  Even times when choices questionable he'll oblige always tells disclaimer if whatever reason satisfied your drink they'll remake until do  Sou just awesome top notch service always smile aims please  amazes remember regulars orders because there's quite lot lol  personalized service  sets them apart book truly deserving 5 stars! Thus loyalty lies BEST!  I since tried Hokkaido milk tea which drinking dessert sense sugar overload but creamy decadent sweetness customizable course! last time tried Earl Grey sea salt crème friends winner! found favorite drink although still quite lot try menu possibilities endless combinations do! Another big plus compared KFT's limited flavor customization due franchise limitations  boba consistently great which leads believe taste buds probably whack first visit lol  also Strawberry Banana slush kids share winner book well  sure if used powder real fruits didn't taste artificial quite refreshing actually     Awesome job BTB! YAYYYY all way! <EOR> Even though they're still new block still defending title little effort  Yes decided Brew Tea Bar officially #1 spot milk teas flavored teas  NUMBER ONE  Take think don't argue me    After initial review returned Brew Tea Bar few more times try few more things  now sea salt coffee  SEA SALT COFFEE  know what? pretty damn good also pretty damned strong  Need lift? Oh give lift  give more lift  would jumping! coffee strong yet bitter acidic BEYOND smooth  delicious! Whenever drink sea salt coffee feel though drank red bull  GIVES WINGS  just unfortunate don't open early can't before work    booooo haha!   I also requested strawberry green tea  don't menu but definitely ingredients it  Most places flavored ice teas quite sweet them add notes more tea flavor less sweet  believe miscommunication order when tasted wasn't really sure drinking  tasted quite weird  No tea flavor no fruit flavor  However remade right perfect  wasn't sweet immense jasmine tea flavor  perfection cup    Brew Tea Bar also doesn't back down challenge any difficult customization mind  Strawberry milk tea  People don't drink tea people drink sweetness! Well DARNED  But okay  Sou challenge he gave go  needed less sweet noticeable tea flavor along he definitely able complete challenge  Tons tea strawberry no added sugar  Done  little tangy due strawberries tea flavor  Yup  Done  good    I am typically afraid order fruit based milk teas other places because if don't regular milk tea probably going any other milk teas have  But okay Brew Tea Bar you    Go Brew Tea Bar  Just go  <EOR> If build come    I'm sure Brew Tea Bar attest truth statement  built quality product city overrun syrup powders low quality tea  Now little shop Southwest area JAM packed customers only being open 2 months  Word spreads quick when you're good friendly helpful crew is    I simplicity shop because focus product  Fresh Brew favorite because they're brewed tea infuser bring lot aromatics! started becoming addicted fresh teas bought own infuser wouldn't broke ha    Other fresh brew side chick cold brew coffee latte foam  only wish opened earlier could come morning live through another treacherous work day  Fortunately only drink did Hokkaido milk tea tasted much only sweetened milk sorry guys! boba chewiness sometimes sweet preference    TL DR  Today didn't even use AK I can't believe today good day cause brew tea bar <EOR> Perfection  If don't right first time they're more happy try again  Great customer service prices  Love love love! <EOR> aw man ran space other review keep updating but since place good ! new ! LOL rather update guess?   Went town busy coming back 2 1 2 week hiatus coming here  Upon entry    LOL still remember name XD why D Lol   So time around try rose milk tea  Less sweet more tea flavor requested ! just ! milk tea base already good now rose added it  Its just youd imagine rose would taste its smell  hard describe XD   My friend requested custom drink herself  Strawberry milk tea  Strawberry isnt fruit would come well easily done when mixed milk tea  you'd diabetes style tons sugar powder yep lot people you'd mix syrup jam even fresh fruit  honest forgot he did but way style they'll keep remaking until it  1st more sour   true fresh strawberry taste breaking through milk tea taste but requested less sweet  Pretty good  nice strawberry flavor its unique sourness but masking tea flavor either  He came around 2nd try  guess he experimenting he had  He tried less sour stronger tea flavor  yeah indeed he did but thought 1st more Strawberry characteristic like XD <EOR> I say love concept modo if don't your drink another one! guys really ami please  drinks sort tease   don't drinks but wasn't crazy drinks thought going amazing    First time order Rose bud tea even though looks good pretty wasn't fan  felt weird fermented taste kimchi flavor  know sounds completely crazy but then again  thought  honey but flavor very vague  Then came back try another drink excited sea salt foam  ordered Oolong green tea foam honey boba  When thrilled good tea flavor chilled but boba itself amazing  pretty bland lacking honey flavor  most part boba cooked perfectly just wish little sweeter  foam nice touch but guess didn't really impress much    I definitely back ask drinks more sweeter see if difference but now take Brew Tea Bar all drinks starts very bland  now them but crazy them service bar itself top notch but  pretty much it  <EOR> They best customer service!!
