If baby poop delicious would eat everyday  Even husband little afraid eat pleasantly surprised great tasting was  He thought tasted green tea ice cream just custard form    The usual sushi get  Tiger spicy tuna crunch lobster screaming just top notch usually are  came super fast fresh  thought may tasted little fresher   Which waitress says she heard lot but doesn't know since both locations delivers each morning fresh  Must minds? also usual calamari grilled asparagus egg rolls   Like always left plump happy  definitely new location since larger closer house  oyshi! <EOR> Saw Sushi place something caught attention decided check out  boyfriend Friday date night  place wasn't busy all but larger party back  sushi amazing!! already want back  can't even recommend dish  all good  <EOR> This all you can eat lunch $21  fresh order premade nor buffet style which love  plethora selections hand rolls sushi appetizers hot cold cooked sushi didn't order any personal Preference   Uni included during lunch  Quality great  dined newer location which nicely decorated modern touches semi private rooms also available  Service good  lot people lunch weekday but maybe because new location  Would come back here! <EOR> This place 5 stars all way  honestly owner relative owner friend owner  don't even live Vegas am LA business  But Vegas quite bit  now every time u way eating here    I finishing business meeting 2 miles away looked yelp sushi place good rating  fit bill drove over knowing nothing other great rating yelp   When u drove immediately impressed outside very attractive obviously part new shopping center  Then saw sign all eat dinner really excited!  Anybody knows knows eat  if your offering all eat im going whole  since hadn't eaten all day ready  sat sushi bar where told everything menu available all eat exception sashimi    There 5 people behind counter sushi bar cranked food really fast  But didn't taste rushed certainly didn't taste all eat  fact might true bast sushi ever had    There sushi chef took care almost entirely  sorry didn't name because he great service did everyone else came contact with    So sum if live Vegas visiting it's only 10 15 minutes strip must try it  If line sushi love place  <EOR> Lunch $ 21 00 Person Dinner $ 26 00 Person AYCE   Rice rice rice brick rice belly  place really knows give illusion good fish rice ratio giving lengthy fish slices but underneath meet your doom impending rice  compacted rice thick rock   The menu selection great AYCE many limits where order from  No sashimi no soft shell crab only rolls no half rolls all rolls large standard size mostly 8 pieces exception some 5 pieces still same large size 8 pieces just cut differently  great place if want try bunch different rolls  Even nigiri selection limited overall pretty unimpressive   Don't even think ordering ahi poke seafood salad salmon skin salad any salads matter  crazy weak flavor fish execution  wasn't happy them  all    The only redeeming dishes were 1  Dynamite appetizer  2  Salmon belly nigiri 3  Baked mussels  4  Green tea creme brûlée And  it     The service received below average  weren't even busy! 2 other tables dining besides us  ask multiple times different servers grab wasabi hot sauce  waitress missing most dinner   In end left feeling uncomfortably stuffed due dense rice expanding  top off hot stuffy music made ears bleed  agree interior design new modern beautiful spacious but overall night club vibe restaurant highly disconcerting    In city loves good AYCE sushi joint place go  would recommend another Korean ran spot does better job Sakana    Now belly busted rice bid good luck good evening  <EOR> We group 10 including 2 small kids early dinner 530 Thursday  already packed  service very friendly but waited over 25 minutes first round AYCE  food quality ok but nothing excited about  Prices average  biggest gripes layout crowded floor walk through wait station front kitchen run into any servers restrooms   and music  nightclub music ok whatever but loud nightclub  group consensus probably won't back  wasn't comfortable atmosphere worth sushi  <EOR> Ah yes  newer Oyshi  Essentially same restaurant but bigger  yet somehow quite tasty original location!   Ambiance 4 epitome comfort Tables far away each other enough spread your leg arm span won't hit another person  But still far away enough can't hear conversations table next you!   Spacious more tables semi dimly lit Oyshi seems bit more romantic lighting if will  Don't worry! still see your menu!!   Service 5 table service fast friendly attentive  restaurant wasn't busy all really able cater!   Food 3 Just other location also offer AYCE choice specialty desserts!   I'm usually huge fan food but quality rolls just good original location! When taste speed most likely back but now drive longer drive first location   However if location looking roll try recommend Love Affair dessert always worth try! Also if fresh oyster theirs delicious <EOR> The original Oyshi fav sushi spot but love reservation just very far! very excited when location opened! couldn't wait disappointed!! The prices lower ambiance clean classy music 90's pop perfect volume staff all polite helpful making selections  The only reason didn't give full 5 stars because don't offer half rolls  husband doesn't lot raw rolls order much share baked rolls  All all    delicious DEFINITELY back!! <EOR> I would agree other reviewers place really decent  am raw fish fan AYCE used lot cooked items all fantastic  service extremely friendly initial greeting exit  location very large modern appeal very clean   The server very friendly provided great service  think name Jamee    <EOR>
