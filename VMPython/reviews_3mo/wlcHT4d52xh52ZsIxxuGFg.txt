Burgers cooked perfect really loved fries rosemary garlic super good fried pickles aren't menu ask them plus married there!!! <EOR> Amazing burgers far better interior more room Summerlin location  Found new closer local Smashy! <EOR> This chain should renamed Grease burger instead! ordered 2 burgers fries  Ordered sin city burger avocado burger  Sin City burger consists greasy onion rings overfried egg greasy chunk smashed ground beef greasy soft bacon    30 degrees outside managed eat more half thinking burn calories outside anyway  But couldn't myself touch fries  First gave lukewarm portion greasy fries which returned kitchen asked hot greasy portion    instead another pile poodle oil bottom basket   *! sake possible pile potatoes right? probably cost 30c why can't edible least  come even McD does better job 1 3 price?  I've gone Smash couple years ago exactly same result    hoped something changed but alas no luck  only bright side 241 coupon total only $12 2 but I'd rather gone INO down street same money    Bottom line save better times unless need oil change  <EOR> Great alternative other fast food burger joints  carry local brews  offer healthy alternatives such veggie frites delicious salads  <EOR> I craving burgers lately decided try SmashBurger first time  am definitely coming back!   The food presentation seemed legit when servers brought food table but burgers fries drenched grease  Didn't even want finish food table filled napkins all disgusting grease    Service alright  Janelle took order tad bit rude  She didn't greet us but kept interrupting putting order constantly saying   obviously couldn't hear because she made no effort speak up  Daniel nice enough come around table smile he cleaning asked food enjoy rest day  <EOR> The burger fries overly dripped grease tasted grease  good never going back  <EOR> This place hooked! Great location nice clean open dining area comfortable seating  Service pretty good but Janelle isn't favorite   She seem bit rude  managers great though always around    Wish fires weren't skinny   They'd more flavor if could actually taste them more but SmashChicken die for  Sometimes fast still overly juicy think  why some people complain grease or maybe burgers greasy just love chicken   <EOR> This place isn't crowded location Sahara Fort Apache   food just good closer work employees seem even more friendly aforementioned store if even possible    I order Sin City Chicken Rosemary Smash fries  very delicious   food little greasy side if your mood something light keep mind    I love plethora seating cleanliness abounds    Diet Coke Cherry Coke available    This place winner sure! <EOR>
