Small plates? flatbread wasn't? server less helpful  Nothing menu printed give any sort guidance  annoying slightly obnoxious    There's also item small menu where pay $5 buy round kitchen staff  freaking kidding me? seems such desperate attempt cool different annoyed mess me!  Our server wasn't most pleasant person she constantly forgot bring drink refills silverware etc  She offered zero advice even when asked  also thought lot staff looked sloppy    I'm professional food critic but love eat love experimenting new flavors dishes  Unfortunately Glutton failed pretty much every level  Maybe off night perhaps ordered wrong dishes but am no hurry return  <EOR> I walked few minutes before friend showed  figured just gonna wait door but hostess seat bar while u wait boy am glad listened her  Alex bartender duty he fantastic!  another bartender beginning didn't catch name BUT Alex perfect   He knew drinks he knew food   Guided friend great drinks great food  We started whipped ricotta picked tomatoes   bread served perfect  Perfectly charred add flavor whatever eating it  spread whipped ricotta thinking might little bland ricotta unless seasoned heavily tends bland   Boy wrong   delicious   Add tomatoes adds different nuance entire plate   good  We also ordered chicken liver mousse port wine reduction If u don't stuff don't order BUT if u love kind stuff   ORDER it   Lol delicious   creamy full flavor but heavy all  very light very airy port wine reduction added just right amount sweetness dish  Then glutton burger mushroom poutine fries side   Alex let know could just fries into poutine instead getting fries top fries considering getting poutine extra side  also another side shredded Brussel sprouts healthy dish night    lol    ask server bartender    u never know guide u    The burger juicy well seasoned  Yummy!!!! mushroom poutine    mushroom cheesy heaven   Lol Brussel sprouts    healthy yet delicious!!!!

On first visit 5 weren't enough plates silverware table took reallllllyyyy long time someone's attention extra plates even appetizers arrived wait eat them  also random french fries scattered around chairs floor people sat prior kept finding throughout meal  hard water refills anything else needed matter  ordered chicken salad sandwich which just bland  if someone forgot salt seasoning entirely just put some diced chicken piece wheat bread    really odd  Others said liked burger panini perhaps ordered wrong thing  did all enjoy whipped ricotta appetizer    The next time mom service again quite weird  server kept bringing extra sodas without asking if she wanted any more also before she finished even half first one   and happened twice  entrees dropped before appetizer plate cleared which biggest pet peeve then bill dropped even 2 minutes taken first bite    I Togarashi chicken sandwich which much better chicken salad sandwich quite large   and side salad great  mom didn't care side salad because almost half chicory and or fennel leaves which happen LOVE but super overpowering really unique taste people don't it  wonder if intentional if line cook confused arugula    P She really liked panini well both happy meals but again weird experience! definitely cheap lunch works $20 pp  Am bound back due proximity office but jumping chance    <EOR> Service great food good    A little disappointed pork skins   Dry   Not much hoot holler about <EOR> I wasn't going write review but felt need  Even sleeping am still frustrated over having dined here  excited over restaurant week trying local establishment but unaccommodating chef manager well food really put bad taste mouth  menu offered thought lamb octopus choice however surprise received both  When informed server Jade did eat lamb asked if could garden salad instead  she back ask chef she informed no substitutions whatsoever would no accommodation made  asked again if could anything place Lamb since did eat lamb manager then came over said no  Once receiving octopus found extremely overcooked  unappetizing  Also since don't eat lamb wasn't able enjoy rest meal  only thing saved restaurant Jade pleasant through service however would ever return recommend food quality  also surprised unaccommodating when all asked something would less cost original offering due dietary restrictions  <EOR> Love Boozy brunch great drinks kimchi Bloody Mary?! chicken hash both pretty well executed  <EOR> I guess only complaint avant garde dining cost  Dinner 1 gonna run $25 tax tip factored in   Totally worth but current trend happening Downtown LV     Glutton offers menu recreations   Nothing you've never heard but everything features original twist just truffle oil fries instead heaping bowl fresh cut fries smothered mushroom sherry reduction melted cheese curd  Glutton celebrates fattening fair   Yes former whole new parade comport foods try including brown butter gnocchi served slow cooked pork cheek   just little ridiculous side  want calorie count one   When eat imagine myself sitting porch Sardinia  masterful gourmet take farm food   All ingredients super fresh too  grill right open  if owner saying Look! ain't reheating s**t plastic bags here  chefs cooking scratch  very nice addition growing DT business district   only sadness comes gentrification area displacement those can't afford $9 bowl gourmet fries however savory delicious may be  But such life city     At any rate left Glutton taste braised pork mouth can't wait eat again  <EOR> This place amazing! watermelon salad 'merica cocktail world refreshing! server also amazing unfortunately forgot name but he tall crazy blue eyes lol would def back again!! <EOR> I'm being nice rounding four stars mainly because worked lifestyle provided excellent service  Basically arrived downtown weeknight 730pm  Parking easy    threw money meter headed into restaurant    The hostess greeted smile  asked menu items if anything could made vegan  Yes know glutton next all vegan restaurant    But wasn't overly impressed vegenation recent health grades    Plus wanted something different hostess asked server Stacey she came back four different menu items could prepared vegan  decided sit down give place try    The decor very simple    Open ceiling exposed ventilation systems    very lofty industrial feel  seating around exposed kitchen which loved probably use next time  Overall great feel it    The service great  Stacey extremely knowledgable menu felt very comfortable asking questions ordering her  water never empty    table always clean thanks busser     The menu easy navigate isn't very large  However eclectic something everyone's taste We ordered cocktail wine    Both delicious  sure ever tried mule delicious    wine    best 5$ cab ever had  boyfriend ordered brown butter gnocchi  He said good  Listed under large plates    definitely large plate    very small portion  16$ think he expected blown away he wasn't  ordered shaved Brussels sprouts prepared vegan cauliflower prepared vegan  Both dishes listed under small plates    Both pretty decent portions priced accordingly  say both dishes lacking something    However when combined them together    complimented each other perfectly  would definitely back order both together but never separate    I would definitely back give place another go  am curious watermelon salad street corn    next time    reviewing that! <EOR> The name place says all     Clean modern intimate cozy place feels looks really enjoyed space  Great job every detail! big downer air conditioning  warm throughout entire meal which really sucked  over 100 Vegas everyday now need some serious air action everywhere go   The cocktails interesting ambitious helped temperature issue  Merica cocktail perfection  Japanese corn sweet equally salty spices great start any meal  fig prosciutto pizza again great balance sweet savory then star show brown butter gnocchi! Show stopper! gnocchi little light pillows heaven pork cheek drenched decadent sauce incredibly flavorful    Everything tasted brilliant except dessert  Ending disappointing note sucked sweating dinner couldn't give them 5 star rating but food service really deserved it  dessert supposed chocolate cream crullers  received dense hot doughnuts watery chocolate sauce cream foam  definitely didn't meet expectations ended bad note  Crullers should airy biggest negative evening    I think place amazing once again pleasantly surprised Downtown! many kick ass places!   Fix air issue remove crullers all good here  <EOR>
