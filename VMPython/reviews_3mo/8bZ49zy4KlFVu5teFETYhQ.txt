My brother yesterday because bought Living Social deal  staff very attentive moment walked sat down mostly because dead Monday afternoon   place decent size looked nice clean   This why Wild gets 2 stars When waitress saw Living Social deal $20 she stated could used any lunch specials combination specials which fine because some restaurants catch deals  decided order few regular priced rolls equaled and even more amount deal  top wanted ahead lunch special anyway because $20 amount fulfilled  waitress told couldn't even though ordering more $20 worth regular priced sushi  didn't sense why wouldn't let order lunch special waitress should asked manager if okay because most DECENT restaurants care customers would be   Furthermore sushi just okay   ordered tuna sashimi Japanese lasagna 007 roll vegetable tempura  Everything came fine nothing spectacular  place changed its name many times since opened sushi restaurant maybe because poor management  don't know  wouldn't again because experience there  brother server fully understands restaurant business works even he disagreed ridiculous policy  <EOR> I found restaurant way Groupon  bought Groupon place because going Las Vegas weekend   I thought place going hole wall good sushi dishes   So dressed very casually  drove shopping complex new   It 5 30 p m  when walked through door   Well proven wrong  place absolutely wonderful beautiful  very underdressed  beautifully decorated  Every detail spared designing place  loved booths big screen wall TV played amazing Jazz videos   The menu amazing  amazing detail thought into menu   We order following dishes Shrimp Yaki mushrooms good Calamari lightly breaded rings big  burnt  Baked Langostinos DISH AMAZING! langostinos baked AMAZING sauce then poured over sushi roll  forgot Sushi roll but JUST AMAZING!

I am going start review Wild Sushi incredible service   came Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm   walked carrying arm load books am Nursing program CSN promptly greeted man think owner   told just eat lots studying done   He sat own section away middle room where bit noisy   He took drink appetizer order before knew sitting front me!  water refilled often allowed delay order bit   Towards end dining experience over heard waitress tell next waitress through shift change bother much trying study but refill water often!  Really 5 star service!  often between classes just service!  Oh yeah food great too!  salmon sashimi comes huge martini glass tastes wonderfully fresh   also order spicy tuna which wasn't crazy but sometimes just spicy!  many rolls mind boggling!   menu dinners noodles many other traditional dishes   can't wait try more! <EOR> will definitely back place  its name being changed several times must say ownership now done right  service unbeatable kicked notch food sushi rolls   baked scallop roll sex beach crazy wild salmon ???   flavorful delicious! good job 'go wild sushi grill'! <EOR> I want say decor amazing staff pretty nice  BUT didnt think sushi anything special  would say mediocre  other places cheaper same quality food  Also food extremely expensive $12 roll  down street pay extra $10 all eat  <EOR> A Living Social deal brought Thursday night intensive work session  sat bar just favorite food    sushi! unagi albacore pretty fresh but other quality good  Everything just spicy roll wise couldn't eat it! There's pretty large selection specialty rolls choose but am more nigri person  Service attentive weren't busy rainy Thursday night  Overall think bill came 50 something bucks Living Social Deal taken out  almost worth just your favorite AYCE point but lunch special dinner specials might worth try  <EOR> I'd give place 4 5 stars but  option  lunch specials great  few ok many special requests no problem any them gave no attitude  food really good  can't say blew away but then again lunch box which wasn't exactly anything special  chicken lean california roll fresh salad tasty  definitely add list sushi joints! <EOR> I'm really digging place  gone few times now  Lots cool rolls chose really pretty presentation  sashimi comes ice packed oversized martini glass  Also  live jazz  Always enjoy place where chefs having fun  Lots toasting laughing  Nice place hang your friends  Prices reasonable  Its bit loud when bands going  bad place bring kids since much going don't worry noise much  Also awesome giant tvs everywhere watch events  Would fun place throw party  <EOR> This better sushi place town  Very large clean inside servers very helpful suggestions! food AMAZING every single roll flavorful  even suggested roll fire when served! son loved part! Friday nights live music next time later that  <EOR> In case you're thinking heading tempura I realize likely   but just case wouldn't recommend  However name Wild Sushi Wild Tempura won't totally discount offerings  restaurant spacious unexpected beauty  appreciate gigantic projection catching Sunday football some other can't miss programming  service also friendly  However tempura shrimp baby food soft vegetables didn't quite crisp expect tempura  poor ordering choice part? Perhaps but still shouldn't girl able some fine fried items cloudy afternoon? <EOR> CLIFF NOTES love quality food served love sushi chefs but servers aren't great     DETAILS Many rolls cream cheese laden fried which isn't really thing HOWEVER quality fish outstanding perfectly happy ornately prepared order sashimi    Beware ordering drinks during happy hour group 4 only two ordered beers intention giving two free drinks remaining two diners  waitress conveniently misunderstood brought two drinks each diner  Thankfully beers unopened able return them bit uncomfortable conversation  <EOR> The only reason even found place because Fox 5 Rewards Group Buy  boyfriend love sushi thought we'd check out    I am giving place two stars because service reaaaaaalllly slow place pretty empty  don't know if understaffed just bad servers but regardless no should wait 45 minutes order second beverage    The food quality excellent  Great fresh cuts sashimi all nigiri ordered excellent yellowtail roll favorite  boyfriend ordered noodle dish he thought really good well    Unfortunately poor service just once keep returning  <EOR> Really liked decor tell restaurant new hopefully stays nice   big screen random live concerts playing kinda weird but whatever didn't mind  some people come play live jazz Friday Saturday nights note self come back Friday Saturday night        avocado roll more later fire dragon roll some baked green mussels 1 2 dozen oysters some gyoza  sushi chefs gong ring when order ready kinda cool   food really good mussels some best oysters very fresh   rolls really creative tasty avocado roll wasn't roll all but avocado bomb fiance gently reminded basically took avocado stuffed spicy tuna soft shell crab eel sauce   fire dragon roll lit fire blowtorch anything cooked blowtorch good btw   gyoza standard        only waitress working she doing good job weren't neglected but if more customers she probably would overwhelmed  Happily she wasn't       coming back here  <EOR>
