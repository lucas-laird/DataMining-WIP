Chef Zenbayashi original Curry Zen decided take difference concept restaurant service self service curry  Instead being seated having server serve original Curry Zen Curry Zen Express wants order cashier seat yourself  Instead using plate Curry Zen Express serves all customers curry dish styrofoam container typically seen to go orders restaurants such Ohana Hawaiian BBQ  When received order right portion rice curry chicken katsu  However friend approximately half portion had  should more consistent portion sizes  curry wasn't flavorful original Curry Zen but okay  feel should spend more time prepping curry because friend's curry turned watery  If want some quick self service curry should location  However would prefer going original location quality consistency  <EOR> The spring mountain more better based service   taste same but takes ages food come   Literally 15 20 minutes while th e spring mountain takes 3 5 minutes come out  even restaurant quality quick   Similar McDonald's something   spring mountain authentic feel   mess orders two times came sure repeat order twice sure     <EOR> I spring mountain location better    I shocked find serve styrofoam    when receive curry taste styrofoam    it's just same also surprised charged extra 20 cents when tell them just want spicy level 1 in old location level 0 4 free don't know if want come back      <EOR> Food great! Tastes exactly same spring mountain  Service good staff friendly  friends definitely going back  am just happy new store close house  = <EOR> Be cautious level spice get  ordered 6 tasted 12 spice Thai restaurants   eat very spicy! <EOR> I boyfriend last night Sunday 7pm so ordered level 4 curry he level 8 curry   and curry tasted exactly same  curry good just wish wasn't spicy  atmosphere casual self serve  want come back month update review  <EOR> Was excited Zen curry opened just 2 minutes where stay  But fan express experience  food sticking to go plate served even if you're dining in  also absorbed all curry sauce  glad food tastes just amazing original location! I'd much rather commute Spring Mountain authentic aura experience    Arigato!! <EOR> If intention location express would suggest stated some where    As faithful customers before original location remodeled surprised differences yet understanding location seems meant take rather dine even though offer dine in  could just opened upgrade things later    ***It's hard compare locations but food exactly same prices same which very happy about ***  Differences When walk aren't greeted direction table take counter  More stand figure feel  need order counter regardless  would typically each table bar form raisins etc   happy dinning receive plastic container eat plastic forks however did receive styrofoam  plus previous reviews  *Even smallest offered dinner dishes silverware  Since you've already paid if want dessert you'd need pay again think  negative business  Once you're done dinning you'll need clear your tray discard trash etc  understandable express feel    Overall personally would rather drive all way original location feel dinning use location take only  <EOR> Yeah new great restaurant close home offering many different curry delights  menu simple making ordering easy  Love Blazen scale imagine hottest level must leave your mouth burning days  only spicy level number three hell kick  curry sauce great flavor  chicken Katsu curry potato croquet corn sausage  good call because all items worked well each other  drink selection lacking  Would great if bigger display case full Republic Teas  But guess space issue  Very friendly helpful service smile  Orders expedited timely fashion leaves feeling wonderful making decision eat here! <EOR> Alright if know Zen Curry probably already know they're probably better Japanese style curry town again  only opinion based slim selection tried  favorite least  location bit different other location but nothing serious about    First price curry spice level shot up  no longer free levels 1 5 20¢ levels 6 10  20¢ levels 1 5 nickel more every level higher  if wanted 10 now 45¢ extra instead 20¢   Second express mentality  now place pickup your order counter find open seat take go  would find open seat before order if its slow  You're food now served container instead non disposable plate  started using those styrofoam containers but last couple times using some plastic containers  I'd rather plate especially if dining in  Instead each table having full assortment toppings spices add your curry theres just used everyone  most you'll terms customer service when your counter if need more water if busy might come your table  Thats only difference  food taste same besides spice levels prices prices look same   The curry sauce delicious its own  HOT  location gotten spice level 5 couple 8s  made sweat little but didn't put mouth fire just right  Next probably 10 see what's hottest they'll without killing taste  curry served nice selection ingredients  throw some vegetables various meats chicken pork beef sausage even spam  There's also other items which never yet   Honestly wished price little lower meat portions little larger but they've grown amazing but good food  <EOR> Great curry good spice  Reasonable price quality food  Service fast easy  Brand new snd very clean  Try it <EOR> Their spice levels perfect! always spice level 10 amazing  Ingredients fresh tasty staff super friendly helpful  Sure may same atmosphere other Curry Zen but judge restaurant based its own merits  Food wonderful service great! such small location Express doing fantastic job  <EOR> VERY delicious curry! usually chicken katsu curry  owner Japanese very nice  Steve Aoki comes eats <EOR> A new Japanese style curry restaurant ADDICTIVE curry sauce katsu  food delicious orders take 5 10 minutes prepare if rush suggest calling ahead     I love spicy food pride myself ability handle it  If then try level 7 spiciness! just right balance between pain pleasure lol    Decor setup could use work but new restaurant appears changing each time walk let them slide  import thing food HOT DELICIOUS CONSISTENT! <EOR> The rice if same used day before  Curry katsu okay original location better  service first time around really great but 2nd time service worse  lady glasses didn't take right order when clearly stated she also seemed busy phone  no receipt given overall 2nd time service quite awful  <EOR> Nothing compare original Zen  Quick service joint but charge same price  If don't want drive across town spring mountain road I'd recommend this  <EOR> I waiting patiently place open while driving last week saw lights dove look  decided give taste test  ordered 3 dishes chicken katsu curry pork katsu curry sausage curry  happy discover place no Hawaiian like BBQ serving sad excuse curry  curry full flavor texture appealing reminded standard learned growing Hawaii  katsu seasoned perfectly perfectly cooked  only complaint which really isn't complaint Zero level still little bit spicy  much unappetizing but more expecting  However would order again? Absolutely! just found new favorite curry joint  close home too!

Update    Tatstes original   love it <EOR> Curry good but wasn't asked if wanted add level spice forgot add it  Dish used serve food containers  give place 3 stars because definitely creating trash environment!! Bill 4 people  over $40 no drinks    Chinatown curry zen way better hands down  More plate lot cheaper  place expensive fast food joint    place should definitely $$ sign    <EOR> If haven't Curry Zen missing life  Please try chicken katsu curry serious game changer   Also thai iced tea delish mango cheesecake winner   can't wrong trust me   Thank Yasu Dad!!
