Each time walked nobody even remotely slowing down put some plate  Mostly everyone stuffing themselves meat seafood dessert    I torn between 3 4 stars but 4 stars because buffet does offer some unique options king crab legs which crazy expensive we'll see long lasts good meat station  if you're fan Vegas buffets worth shot  Whether return repeat visit remains seen  <EOR> Totally overhyped!!!!!

All all if Improve Hold quality try again  <EOR> Very good   All chefs know talking about   buffet where chefs gladly talk help anything need  <EOR> When came food lot things right but fell short just few  Overall Buffet lovers dream! cannot value selection quality food flavors! Best value strip    This only feast feasts intense flavors around world but very attractive aesthetics rather unique design most sought design firms world  unlike any other buffet  elegantly warm modern sophisticated  Designed diner interact Chefs prepare your food open show kitchens throughout each sections  Its incredibly thoughtful feel almost home    Cuisines range East West everything between  incredible seafood selection  Freshly made order just everything!

If could recommend anything Chef Green would say just every item including Ramen luke warm cold time brought table  respect noodles ended little al dente  big deal  Maybe personal preference but just food pipping hot In end lovely experience  talking awhile  <EOR> Bacchanal Buffet definitely raising bar high all other competitors   another level    just hope able sustain service quality often seen buffets gradually decline time   would easily rank higher Wicked Spoon which feel overrated    probably along lines Wynn    The food ridiculously good    lamb chops cooked perfectly medium rare medium    All food stations general favorites along more authentic options    asian line Pho Ramen station where serve Ramen Monta   didn't taste same level Monta but over 500 items we're knit picking   I enjoyed Italian station where pasta station where choose your pasta sauce   bolognese which delish     The biggest star show seafood line least if you're basing lines    advice grab first plate food first excitement way   Then your way seafood line wait    bring fork when first your way through hot seafood items snack halibut salmon crab croquette lobster corn chowder   People may give weird looks judge but only because weren't genius enough come idea themselves    When your way around L shape towards STONE CRAB KING CRAB LEGS don't forget ask cooks heat them if  u roll   Save room desserts!  enjoyed tiramisu eclectic sorbet flavors such Watermelon Mint Mango Chile Lime  <EOR> Buffets Vegas cliché it?

This new must go to buffet stands grandeur Romanesque decor we're accustomed seeing here   Truly juxtaposition colors textures flavors   Sounds reviewing Masterpiece?  Maybe am  new Vegas vibe dominating strip Caesar's Palace going left behind    Since first visit wasn't expecting love everything however distinguishing characteristic buffet simplest dishes should taste best especially when they're served such elegance style here    I'll name list few tips hits some items surprisingly fell short Crab legs!   Ask chef steam them although busy may wait Also wish clarified butter closer crabs because there's door slam into you like did me when area    The variety stations overwhelming  Chinese Sushi Ramen station Southern comfort food Seafood oyster shooters Paella oysters half shell ceviche Italian Mediterranean Mexican which favorite    Tamales very very good moist full flavor Posole toppings I try next time revolving cast iron griddle home made tortillas Street tacos Sopes least 12 different types salsa mushroom soup my favorite fajitas etc  wonder if serve Pan Dulce breakfast?   Bacchanal buffet paying attention its clientele lots them come South Border  Did know richest man world tycoon Mexico City named Carlos Slim?  Tiffany Co  Vegas Crystals should take notes   sure if he came he wouldn't mind some traditional dishes!  Disappointments Mexican corn cob   Although presentation worthy cookbook cover flavor lacked corn husk took much room plate  If you're going street vendor food another option shave kernels save work put them cup  fajita type beef peppers good meat tough chewy  Table service gets two star  Piles dishes stacking didn't drink until round two   Saw waitress only other time   At seafood stand Halibut dry  Lobster corn chowder lacked flavor  layout dining room left weaving people's tables   Another downer some foods served small dishes baskets mini cast iron bowls hard getting many items made plate heavy   I'd say highlight 5 star dessert station   huge selection sweetness  Candy jars gelato macarons cake pops creme brûlée leave room freshly made crepe banana soufflé request!    Another highlight 5 star service each kitchen   many buffets servers behind counter usually stoic even those chefs brunches leave tip jar omelet but can't even say hello   way sure being helped  Yelp group name tag BUT did see other patrons being helped same courteous manner   Loved music creativity presentation value variety food  fabulous gourmet spread surely satisfy every your tastebuds   plan coming back guests hearty appetite! <EOR> The ambiance layout place great  early Sundays avoid long lines  While decent size buffet certainly biggest  stations well organized good amount selections  drawback omelette station dessert station  small dishes looks good presentation but very practical  Many small plates hot grab  mini pancakes great but necessary small places  Grabbing just two small plates would fill your plate  rid mini plate idea  french toast excellent next red velvet mini pancakes  disappointed dismal fruit bar  mixed berry dish it  meat selection excellent  dessert selection very average  Overall place okay $39 00 breakfast buffet many places more selections  <EOR> The decor beautiful   seated back corner but love doesn't feel you're buffet room   decor modern everything just beautiful   heard great things buffet  planning going wicked spoon rave reviews friends   But wowed place   place apart other buffet quality variety   Sat brunch 43$ unlimited champagne mimosa   greeted host gave tour available all stations   first buffet  Usually just seat  it   Over 500+    how person try everything  course plan return   tried little bites everything  All super fresh most stations ready made order    expected bit more variety desserts though   love unique gelato flavors   fig balsamic delicious!!

Probably   Living Seattle Oysters consumed rather easily   always hear people say beware shellfish buffet  don't eat oysters buffets  try everything but oysters  might want careful eating oysters    However buffet such glowing reputation reviews read before all first class 5 star said know what? We're going eat oysters   they look good don't smell off we're hungry  real hungry      BIG MISTAKE  both throwing hour meal   discuss all other stuff ate but  really relevant   point matter oysters and shrimp but those cooked both us   Simple connecting dots   Now all say  your fault eating oysters  you knew risk  stick cook foods buffet  use your noodle  that's isolated experience  1 star kind harsh dontcha think? while those arguments made wasn't just food poisoning scenario factors into rating happened after   The next morning she called Caesar's complain she talked them little while seemed if person other line making notes all happened   Why else would tell we'll back within 48 hours    much sense   Oh  but happened 48 hours later?  She called back told no documentation original call  Can't up   only but she told she needs call security department   they also thought making story if strictly getting refund  yeah let's just elaborate scheme $45  wake up  What did security department do? Apparently passed Caesar's insurance department   She told she needed call them back follow other way around  Hospitality folks!  She did call back again story getting sick questioned    Eventually she letter explaining Caesar's wasn't fault  no sorry unpleasant experience   nothing    I'm sure if avoid Oysters you'll fine  but gee whiz  atrocious customer service  we're picky  we're demanding  we just expect common courtesy common sense logic mix when something happens  and didn't  #endrant  PS Planet Hollywood's Buffet pretty good though  Paris' too! <EOR> Bacchanal Buffet Disney World much Disney World should sell passes good more day  believe would impossible try everything your heart desires or maybe even two visits buffet   Buffet doesn't even seem right word use describe smorgasbord  perfectly crafted dishes  The food fantastic quality seems if everything prepared care  wasn't single item chose didn't like  salmon perfectly cooked sushi fresh delightful clam chowder buttered dinner roll amazing  also basket calamari grilled asparagus salmon croquets delicious cheese board fresh chips salsa JUICES! fresh squeezed watermelon orange cucumber carrot juice  would back juices alone   And dessert bar don't even know say  macarons gelato blood orange balsamic fig heavenly key lime tart delicious didn't even try half items wanted before full brim  also liked felt if able stick more closely healthier food eat daily basis even though use trip buffet cheat meal   I definitely returning try Mediterranean American sections  would also check breakfast sure would incredible well  <EOR> I really avid buffet goer but really recommend Bacchanal! While wait horrendous   I felt food made it! miniature individual buckets seafood tickled fancy all adorable delicious  felt dishes offered little bit more complexity other buffets  instance really good shrimp over polenta sitting  little plate sauce  Normally other buffets shrimps dish polenta off side sauce nowhere found  loved everything together miniature slice heaven  All all pleased $40 payed in  Also can't really wrong spicy chocolate gelato dessert  <EOR> I'll admit   I'm cheap maybe because being Chinese rather spend money tables but admit  person bought buffet pass  Yes spent $44 99 day pass Harrahs amusement buffet    I really didn't know Caesars buffet but whatever  friends waited line 50 minutes in  24 hour pass soon line    Oh need pay extra $16 99 top your pass enter here   What? Your kidding right? Nowhere says pay more money   Sorry  essentally screwed deal  wasn't going forget it  already wasted 50 mins already line all paid    So table all way back waited server  waited good 10 minutes until he realized whoa   I people! everything  really another copy Rio's Carnival Buffet except more fancy!   The food bad  extra $17 put better decent  meat moist veggies bad all  Didn't buffalo chicken wings tasted somebody dropped bucket vineger just decided serve it    Apparently service lacks maybe when Caesar died he decided take all nice servants back him   I think Rio still hands down better Harrah's family amusement foods but Caesars Palace does come close 2nd  <EOR> Loved buffet! local visit many buffets town definitely frequently visited place me! price good offer felt clean food fresh    didn't feel eating food sitting under heat lamp    would definitely recommend family friends buffet entertain state relatives well!! Three thumbs 5 star <EOR> People need realistic   buffet serves 1000's time   If they're expecting beef taste beef Capital Grille fish taste fish @ Michael Mina they're unrealistic idiots   That said most extraordinary creative quite simply overwhelming buffet Las Vegas ever built   choices immense   example mex station homemade tortilla chips      with 15 salsas choose from  10 types cookies   15 gelato flavors   8 italian premium cold cuts   etc etc    The airy design space great furniture   If want know buffet restaurant look when $17 million spent it   The prices totally reasonable   Whatever pay quality above average full 12 hours soft drink included   People give $100 bills left right playing roulette bitch paying $25 lunch   Hats off Gary Selesner making happen such grand scope  <EOR> This buffet good  Everything tried amazing  crepes smoked salmon favorites  breakfast only $19 99  <EOR> Wow!! buffet doesn't end!

They standard breakfast fare eggs sausage pancakes various juices  all pretty good  also some more interesting dishes  breakfast foods huevos rancheros croque madames corn beef pizza steak eggs red velvet pancakes chicken waffles  Unfortunately most breakfast foods great except chicken delicious     However lunch Asian foods really really good talking Chinese buffet quality but much much better  dim sum just spring rolls but soup dumplings WOW! sticky rice good har gau which don't eat   noodle station amazingly flavored ramen  Peking duck some best ever had     The charcuterie salads rocked especially prosciutto  doesn't love prosciutto  prime rib also really good perfect medium rare me   sliders definitely winner too    The desserts good but spectacular but am rarely wowed desserts anyway  macaroons especially delicous <EOR> I hate buffets thought! Instead waiting line paid line pass only waited fraction time others did general line  Which think great idea if you'd rather doing something else besides waiting line   like getting down some atypical food offerings!!! Freshly shucked oysters authentic Latin Chinese Japanese cuisine  Carving station awesome BBQ chicken ribs brisket prime rib lamb chops   A definite home run! <EOR> If quality Wynn Bellagio type buffets Bacchanal same arena but dips into your wallet bit deeper  4 Sat brunch came little under $180  player's cards  weekend champagne brunch  where additional costs come when comparing Wynn Bellagio but isn't even option opt champagne if don't care it  agree past reviewers design new place absolutely gorgeous but  people wait hours spend $$$ on  Most items sweet salty while always left personal taste still rather food spot add personal preference  highlights carving station prime rib super delicate slow roasted brisket smoky thick slabs bacon sweet savory gelato  enjoyed abundance variety cuisines while didn't sample any liked cheese meats dressing station! small plates like Wicked Spoon enough sample almost everything Bacchanal offer without going overboard rolling yourself your seat  wouldn't return unless someone else footing bill even then I'd ask if Wynn Bellagio could considered  <EOR> Did ever wonder food heaven like?

The prime rib tender easily cut very flavorful  Beef brisket little strange tasting  Lamb chop average little more gamey prefer  roasted duck amazing   Vegetables average  Desserts also average taste but above average presentation   The seafood bar huge disappointment  First all plates middle bar which facilitated some confusion   seafood displayed apparently only display which attendants somehow expected know   supposed ask them hot crab legs which actually turned ice cold anyway  don't even think asking them give some hot ones   'drawn butter' real butter  lobster corn  chowder very tasty but probably would better if actually contained some lobster    We arrived 'early' for Vegas anyway 5 30pm  service when arrived pretty poor but shift change waiter much better   Only worth price if enjoy sampling small portions variety food if huge appetite    Oh 'beautiful views pool' don't exist   walked around entire restaurant hardly table good view beautiful pool area  Pretty much only thing see people engorging themselves  <EOR> This place lives Epic description!

WELL       quantity variety deserve two thumbs up   but average appeal Bacchanal would almost typical your usual quality buffet Las Vegas   self advertised over 500 items supposedly most selections food single buffet   Could illusion though doesn't seem way? Maybe   maybe not   smaller portions individual mini plates?  must took book COSMOPOLITAN's Wicked Spoon BUFFET your welcome free plug advertisement hehe but serious note plain ridiculous   Sure helps cut down wasting food but barely carry plate food without taking much space! plus more unnecessary dishes clean?  guess price hike take care that   other hand   the chefs cooks cater your needs upon availability   Sometimes welcoming other times no where found walking past without acknowledgement   really hit miss   respectable busy buffet though   annoyed price told cashier second time   Opening month approx mid $35 minus any rewards club membership discounts dinner rates   Now price rewards card came $46 plus per person    fine dandy once while   but price would expect food counter being point   re filled being left crumb   time around guess   it kind disappointing   also second time buffet   and server looked lost giving wrong drinks even making effort check refill drinks   Felt being ignored   Could second strike bad day server   but no excuse customer service   call different server apologized gave drinks promptly   Caesars management need emphasize critical area could downfall long run   price   I might rather Wynn Bellagio Wicked Spoon buffet instead   Don't wrong   Bacchanal wonderful buffet experience recommend tries least once lifetime during Las Vegas Vacation trip   but seriously raising price   Common Caesars Palace   Step up!!! Next time might willing empty pockets bring hungry taste buds here   or more so    may recommend others elsewhere where better quality service    don't disagree all 4 5 star ratings here   but personal experience honest during 2 visits here   If come back third time   please prove wrong  <EOR> Great decor  all really say place  would definitely prefer Wicked Spoon Bellagio Buffet over Bacchanal  expensive hostesses staff move sloth pace! crab line up  carving station line up  no sense line into buffet line again your food  <EOR> Pro Variety offerings good juices some tasty salty breakfast meats  Con Overpriced $45+ Sunday breakfast 8a slow service many things cold even though just opened why walk middle line end line cream cheese bagel bagels cream cheese need placed together  Nice place but overpriced champagne breakfast should $45 also should cold food should hot price <EOR> Sat AM brunch lunch   very impressive   500 items challenge try everything but recommend fresh squeeze juices bottle  don't OJ staff   fried chicken impressive crispy outside juicy inside can't usually this   also rather surprised pho ramen other tiny stations things you   while all items best necessary excellent buffet   crepes freshly made interesting sorbet flavors   tiny breakfast bite sizes great small little fryer baskets plus ingenious little handles dishes them easy pick up  <EOR> Step aside Bellagio there's new player town  Baccanal Caesers where want be    The food selection obviously extensive  felt full just looking all food  Want fresh hand made chinese noodles?

The food just good last time went  am glad everything very good quality tasted delicious  am big fan chinese food area  Most buffets panda express quality food chinese food area but bacchanal food taste came good chinese restaurant  especially love dim sum xaio long bao  Other choices good sliders ramen all carved meats   My only complaint would deserts  tried deserts exotic weird  Im fan normal deserts  Want chocolate gelato? Nope only aztec chocolate which spicy weird  Want mango flavor? Nope only mango chili verde! Want orange sherbet? Nope only blood orange!  Bacchanal currently favorite buffet now Wicked Spoon transforming into generic vegas buffet  Would recommend everyone check seriously more efficient seating system  think maybe seating bad try sell $15 pass skip line  <EOR> I am painfully slow getting reviews but case really worked advantage   My wife three times Dinner Breakfast finally Lunch   Each time price increased previous visit   unfortunate because would given 5 stars first visit   each subsequent visit however losing stars   The positives there   dishes fresh very flavorful   layout fantastic   smoked meats carving station superb   desert area simply delicious   No question food   great   Especially if your first visit   Now areas really need attended IMO being most expensive daily buffet town   all mostly service related   1 Now mentioned more 1 employee during first visit   SALT shaker less holes PEPPER shaker more holes   later visits     taken care of   BASIC  Others mentioned well   server told us  2 should guess chefs behind service counter me   should need ask each every single station extra   Signage stations explaining extra available services would very helpful  3 Prices going selection service going down   Charcuterie cheese station selection began very interesting varied selection which last visit scaled back  4 First visit Crepe' station   asked would she proceeded wonderful crepe me   Last visit handed crepe became DIY kind deal   I suggested buffet many friends work town visitors   Now however increasing prices simply good faith tell people best town   but only just short moment   service simply does stack ever increasing price  <EOR> I say probably best buffets ever life  Understood cost $45 but worth every cent    We Thursday evening only stood line 15 minutes which pretty fast ended trying everything Lamb which AMAZING italian food oysters  loved place!! wil come back again tomorrow!  PROS Awesome Lamb Italian Fresh food Deserts awesome the baked cookie best The decor Need mention food AMAZING!!!  CONS Customer service Bus boys did take any dishes Server slow   If wasn't Service place would definiately 5 star joint  hopefully stop again tomorrow see service food does again  <EOR> I think if wait wasn't long could easily give buffet 4 Stars   I think best thing buffet going variety food  think two things really impressed me ramen gelato bar   Will back again? Only if line isn't almost 2 hours long  sad thing line doesn't seem very long but takes forever  line Bellagio buffet which seemed twice long took half time   Maybe because still fairly new but hard justify spending long waiting buffet Vegas <EOR> The food amazing! No matter ate excellent! only thing annoying extremely loooooong wait  1pm Sunday wait over hour just pay  Then another 15 min seated  Then wait buffet lines  Once seated spent 2 hours just because would take long thru each buffet lines  <EOR> I've reading numerous 5 star reviews buffet past several weeks  Most those high reviews being written non residents should clue  weeks anticipation finally tried dinner today  Talk huge disappointment! Maybe tonight just off night but hefty price won't bother coming back anytime soon see if today just fluke    First off knew high price no problem  no qualms paying expected excellent dining experience  line may look bad but moves very slowly  Then pay there's another slow moving line seated  If you're Express line Diamond Platinum Total Rewards member expect long wait during peak times   dinner took hour fifteen mins entering line finally being seated  Ambiance decor nice inside but all food right? Also lot walkways between tables narrow  Just FYI case you're larger sized may want request being seated along edges    Service pretty good drinks refilled server very much top clearing plates away  few highlights meal   Again maybe tonight off night but everything tried dry tough little flavor  lamb juicy all brisket overcooked dry point being inedible  took bite unfortunately leave unfinished plate  Also tried halibut herbs fennel but strangely completely flavorless  Tried wagyu beef slider but instead being moist juicy overcooked dry  first batch Korean kalbi short ribs actually decent but second helping completely chewy marinade tasted different first time  Many items looked dry unappetizing  made difficult find items fill plate  hoping try lobster bisque but only found lobster corn chowder did any lobster found  made amount corn though disgustingly sweet also leave unfinished    Dessert   walked around area scope everything first before diving in  Everything looked pretty but few items jumped enough want eat them  Nothing terrible say desserts but nothing memorable all either    Very disappointing  500+ items buffet touts expecting more  selection didn't seem anywhere near buffet claims  There's nothing worth noting buffet found mouth watering worth going back seconds  Bacchanal Buffet does deserve its current reputation best buffet Las Vegas  <EOR> My second trip best buffet town all say AMAZING!!! <EOR> My wife heard many raves damn place dragged here  know happens your manhood if don't obey   came  We arrived around 2 30 Friday nov 9th  no lines  sign but paid 68 00 both started adventure   The buffet selection bad  only good thing came around 3pm started bringing crab legs dinner  try some but crabs crap way salty edible also frozen   Bottomline overpriced over rated  very disturbed never come back  <EOR> One best buffets LV  Thanks high roller friend did wait just come in  Since being craving red velvet small pancakes  loved chandeliers made glasses  want home  <EOR> We enjoyable experience Bacchanal  husband happy find good variety cheese counter which included local international selections  numerous seafood available counter which fresh nicely presented  Mexican food station also exciting  saw posole happy  Both American Asian food station did fail impress us  Those prime rib korean bbq ribs irresistable   Did mention dessert station mouth watering? Those lollipops cute lovely outside tasty mouth  also enjoyed those gelato toppings available  Tiramisu! What? Where? Yes dessert station next many other yummy sweets   The bright modern spacious decor place provided enjoyable dining experience us  cant speak enough much better place compared Wicked Spoon  Lucky came Thursday thus did wait  price cheap but definitely well worth it  <EOR> Found ourselves 3rd time take advantage Veterans Day special complimentary Buffet Buffets only pay $15 upcharge Sunday brunch meal !

Really liked but disappointed many ways  Even tho seated VIP table ask refills   Night before did drive check BB talked manager Markus regarding party Dec am used people being more enthusiastic   The 3 stars due mostly atmosphere because I'd really hold party but probably restaurant across street which charges 50% more little atmosphere  bad can't eat atmosphere  <EOR> We twice dinner but impossible sample everything much!  Wonderful selections something everyone   Service superb friendly never wait refills beverages always served clean glass each time  Perfectly clean everywhere    Comfy seating modernistic environment   Entrees Beverages some favs shrimp brisket prime rib truffled scalloped potatoes salmon delicately flavored peach tea believe best mac cheese ever had!

Caesar made right decision back anal bacch anal investment definitely raking profits once again Rome    I definitely RECOMMEND Vegas buffet for now before eventually ends Carnival World Buffet ! <EOR> 2 45PM Mon  Nov  26  Best day   I rite away  Always off time  Checked 2X before busy nite wait 2 1 2hr  $29 18 lunch price + tip   bench   I snow alaskan crab  salty everyone complained just sweet  Maybe sweet Jan   Oysters East Coast  sweet  Clams good   Rib eye prime rib very disappointing  Nebraska ranch dry tuff  Sausage ok  Tell bbq chef wipe sweat off head when he's cutting your piece meat   Best food liked proscuitto different salami Italy violet mustard   a balsamic flavored mustard   Tried pistachio  banana soufflé  good  tasted mushy cupcake  don't choc  anymore  Malted ball shitty  Tiramisu good   I liked mint watermelon gelato aztec chocolate  ordered coffee because another yelper said best  Not! drank whole pot didn't feel caffeine all   The waitress 90 years old dementia  She forgot  order   I still M resort best  seating better  way M RESORT designed layout  Buffet  And best all access beer wine  Free    All say try Bacchanal dif experience  <EOR> A feast eyes but stomach  modern design sleek interior just facade not surprising city known it   title holder #1 buffet Las Vegas Bacchanal total utter disappointment    After hoping off plane family waited good 3 hours line dinner  waited second line another 1 2 hour paid watched management miserably failed try seat people orderly fashion  chaotic completely unorganized  party behind same number people cut through seated before which course pissed all off  Needless say manager more earful brother law handling situation  Service just bad overall   So once finally seated waited another line food  Oh  food   it mediocre BEST  Sure huge selection but emphasis Bacchanal definitely quantity over quality  boost 9 show kitchens which includes sushi  Something absolutely enjoy eating  Looking images website reading rave reviews sorta imagine myself tasting fine texture subtle flavors fresh fish perfectly prepared rice but palette treated poorly presented piece bland crap looked something 6 year old niece assembled hands!   As moved try rest Asian fare treated take type quality Chinese food  mean even same level your local P F Chang's  Sadly did better there  Italian food lacked authenticity having hailed Providence R I expecting taste comforts home made lasagna pasta  so  found everything else offered just eh ok but nothing spectacular including French Macarons which total fail crust filling ratio proportional filling tasted super market icing  crapstatic  party agreed wait money spent $45 + tax per person worth it! mistake because insisted eating here  yeah gambled all lost appetite    <EOR> Been wanting try Bachannal since opened couple months ago   Came family over Thanksgiving holiday   waited line 4 hours!!!!!  Personally don't think worth wait   If waited 20 minutes would given 4 stars!  think only difference between buffet others Wynn Bellagio boil crab legs nice piping hot!  Also crepe station different   also your choice caramel nutella chocolate topping  Other crab legs crepes everything else pretty much line other buffets   Oh variety gelato offer nice touch too   Try fig + basil blood orange flavor     One thing noticed techno music consistently playing    sure way eat quickly out   need change better soothing music   Also interior cold contemporary decor   Would come back? Probably you'll find Wynn buffet next time <EOR> Since family Vegas wanted least buffet while found place Yelp rave reviews   knew there'd long wait but course those things don't really long until you've actually waited   We little passed 5 00p Saturday because Caesar's Palace stinking huge   people stay lost?  Anyways someone said we're lucky because wait only 2 2 1 2 hours time   Wait what?  *cleans ears out*  ONLY?  But hey 5 00ish wait until 7 30ish which isn't bad   The result HOLY CRAP took THREE freaking hours just cashier another 30 minutes seated we party 8 30 minute wait may vary if smaller party !  top dinner $51 99 per person kids 8 under $26 99 PLUS parties 8+ charged 15% gratuity fee!

Another thing noticed servers pissed when grabbing items laying them out   person front started grab items server replacing them did same thing when turn   could tell server pissed quickly took thongs away next person wouldn't grab anything until he done laying them out   Maybe why missing thongs people grab stuff hands!

C'est par hasard en lisant un dépliant que nous avons appris l'ouverture  un mois avant notre arrivée d'un nouveau buffet au Ceasars Palace juste en face de notre hôtel donc le descriptif vantant la cuisine raffinée et la décoration moderne avait finir de nous convaincre cette année ce serait celui ci !  Première impression le descriptif ne mentait pas la décoration est moderne et assez classe c'est très lumineux et agréable et le service est tout à fait en accord avec le lieu !  Une fois la note payée c'est parti pour un festival de nourriture avec des associations dans l'assiette assez improbables    c'est ça de vouloir goûter un peu à tout !  Missions toutefois impossible tant l'offre est pantagruélique pas moins de 9 stations proposant un éventail de toute les cuisines du monde   Je ne vais pas vous décrire tout ce que nous avons goûté mais les oeufs brouillés étaient excellents fait assez rare les french toasts avec céréales très sympas et le mini burger l'un des meilleurs de tout le séjour !!! Même le café passe bien et ça ce n'est vraiment pas courant !  Beaucoup de plats sont proposés sous la forme de petites portions individuelles non seulement c'est assez agréable à l'oeil mais en plus ça évite d'avoir les yeux plus gros que les ventre en se servant et ça permet de goûter facilement à plus de choses  Bon après le salé et après avoir déjà goûté 4 5 desserts je décide de calmer un peu et de finir sur une note rafraîchissante direction le bar à glaces ! Ce sera donc figue balsamique original et bon et surtout pour finir en apothéose Mango chile lime et alors là ça envoie du très lourd tout est bien là piment y compris !!!  Petite astuce comme dans de nombreux buffets à Las Vegas si vous venez un peu avant la fin du breakfast vous pourrez profiter de la fin du breakfast et du lunch en ne payant que le breakfast qui est moins cher mais pas d'inquiétude tout le monde est au courant ! <EOR> Believe hype    We waited line half hour    paid seated before long  Then came feasting began Asian section ended seafood section   can't remember all blur buffet line table back line  Dear reader please appreciate wife sister cannot stop talking but duration meal busy conversing plates talk each other  Silent yet waiter afraid put hands near  table lest he caught carnage devoured before anyone noticed    Yeah  that    I amused carving station  line when brought piece pork loin watched fall apart tenderly when paid carving table  audible murmur through line watching some kind magic show    Now you've your fill   make your way over desert station! Deep dish chocolate chip cookies? apple cobbler?  watermelon mint ice cream hazelnut coated cone?   Its pricey  possibility you'll made wait while  its worth me  <EOR> Arrived early didn't wait line   This place big does fresh cooked appearance   They extensive Asian section beef   Italian small seafood excellent   The fish everything wanted  Crab legs muscles etc  The meat section prime rib rib if wanted lamb brisket ribs sausage   Most everything good  Some excellent but overall good dinner 44pp  I disappointed dessert section  Very small plates just expecting based huge selection main food area   It experience would back again half price free   other words going happen   Mixed drinks 14 15 dollars each  <EOR> Bacchanal  IMHO  rates solid Meh or three stars   Part may just problems buffets  don't enjoy overeating hate see food wasted  which plateful here   Does represent good value money? If you're eating breakfast lunch price much more reasonable dinner  seems pretty easy those times zero wait 11am weekday save added cost excessive waits others written here   Service visit friendly prompt  No complaints there   Bacchanal probably good bet chronically undecided those fussy children those enormous appetites   Otherwise think you're better off spending few moments thinking you'd eat seeking multitude places strip  You'll probably pay less all around better experience  <EOR> Plenty variety everything just ok Jack all trades master none   better buffet sushi detroit buffet's   Lot's stuff never seen before   2 30 Wednesday did wait all   31 99 BEFORE tip all drank water   If best buffet strip other's must totally awful   thought Vegas buffet actually AMAZING FOOD ??  just total over indulgence   Way expensive mediocre food   half eat Grand Lux cafe inside Venetian EXCELLENT food  <EOR> We Sunday 4 PM right in  food service good  good selection food  reaaly liked ribs  great rub them great smoke flavor  Where problem price! two tax using rewards card $108 00  worth fact even close  also Wynns Belagio dinner buffet which price much better deal  few less food choices but food just good service  <EOR> I tried every single item offered kid not!  seriously impressed think $44 99 price tag per person much!    This buffet offers pretty much every cuisine think except Indian   cool would if little naan station though?!?!  Anyway there's nothing really ordinary offer   Every station American staples Americans enjoy most     Chinese pecking duck chow main dim sum fried rice   Italian pizza pasta meatballs Japanese miso soup ramen rolls nigiri   Stuff that   standard fare any buffet pretty much offers   didn't see anything stood made feel like    Damn ish worth $50!  I buffets because variety   can't say ever eat money's worth but really did want put forth effort try everything fair possible review   The crab legs total fail well   salty overcooked   love indulging crab legs during visits buffet but couldn't even finish plate gave me   *it nice offer warm cold though   I'm actually little disappointed cause pictures posted gave lot hope!  really thought going live all its hype   didn't offer some stuff pictured   Sunday night if difference   I thought desserts just ok   prefer Wynn sure   offered lot different pastries but looked better tasted   gelato selection wasn't great but did baklava flavor!  also mango chile which reminded those Mexican candies!  Yum!  crepe station well   I didn't experience service other yelpers talking about   server took drink orders  it   party if six stacking plates ourselves pushing them side   girl kept coming clear them out   She also replenished drinks   server started doing job towards end when just ready finish up   paid group CC wanted tip cash finished   don't know if made difference but sure probably would've received better service if tipped upfront   Again shouldn't matter but service nonexistent group   Overall probably won't come back   quality food better most buffets but Wynn would still choice   think ambiance lot well   decor bacchanal kind bland   modern sleek but lacked character  <EOR> Ok  Ok  Yes food good But didn't change life  fish chips   amazing! souffle   unbelievable! worth $40? Meh  back full price? Nope  back $25  If you've never I'd say just say did  think 1 hour wait combined price made just ok overall  3 7 stars is <EOR>
