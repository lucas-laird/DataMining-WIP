You must order bacon wrapped dates w blue cheese almond  Great music atmosphere staff  Outside patio area when weather nice  chicken salad filet sliders also must Firefly Sahara west side   course if thirsty mojitos sangria hit spot  <EOR> I HATE GOING RESTAURANTS FEEL CLUB BLASTING MUSIC LOUD CANNOT HEAR PERSON AM TRYING CONVERSE WITH!!!! OMG  same story other location Paradise which used visit quite frequently    end night feel lost voice  Gah minus 1 star that    Their menu pretty much same waiter mentioned only changed wine list but other pretty much same  mention last year size dishes seem shrinking but prices staying same  happy but whatever food pretty good    We ordered Gazpacho Cold Soup Albondigas Meatballs Pulpo Asado Squid Octopus eh something w tentacles Lamb Skewers Mango Mojito Tres Leches  All flavorful full goonie goodness! If you're accustomed cold soup really don't suggest Gazpacho    only friends family LOL    Parking wasn't bad then again lucked since found spot right front    RESERVATIONS yes suggest them  tons people waiting seemed little annoyed when seated before them way before us  Anyone eaten Firefly know 2 hr wait please don't come without reservation definitely come hungry! <EOR> The food amazing! Great happy hour specials too  just need add more tables more staff   then five star rating  <EOR> This place AWESOME!  Great TAPAS really nice environment    only problem knowing when stop ordering!  Well    that slightly underdressed compared other clients  <EOR> Love first Firefly* love too   few differences course but food drink atmosphere all great    Happy hour nice all drinks just 4 5 things other places around   All all great maybe better first just because drive home minutes here   Welcome neighborhood Firefly! <EOR> I am lover original Firefly so much 3  times week half recently when heard new much closer location Summerlin open brought town guests some nibbles   I used visit building years ago when Z Tejas new decor right line Firefly brand  Love painted walls layout crowded loud  would suggest long communal table truly Spanish style!  Hostess called much friendlier more helpful original location no wait seated a first! dinner rush subsiding 9pm but fair amount tables still only few empty   We ordered all regular items most really good  always learning curve any new place took account review   Garden Variety Salad smaller original location many goodies but still very edible!  Boquerones Anchovy toast Good but bread toasted send back   Beautiful presentation cook likes use sauce bottles Artichoke toast Bread toasted really? menu toast little push back waiter when sent them back toasted  Oil dressing fanstastic much more flavorful original!  Mac n Cheese excellent!  Stuffed Chilis Amazing par original location   Staff Waiter many tables wasn't all attentive  He wasn't familiar menu would hoped but again just opened  Luckily he good support   Busboy AMAZING! If he wasn't trained original location would surprised  He very attentive bent over backwards sure meal perfect sent back toast s    Manager? someone suit flittering around sure he but he didn't stop address table only staff when sent something back  Would nice received feedback personally just staff  No harm done though glad see someone there   Overall can't wait place gain some more experience really shine! back did enjoy meal wine wouldn't hesitate send friends caveat still working kinks  <EOR> This first time tapas   Didn't know really small appetizers   sure if just hang snack would order several dishes meal if really hungry  However food some BEST had   Very upscale little bites heaven   Which torn if expensive 4 bites because quality just good  <EOR> I Las Vegas business trip invited dinner Firefly it's always nice away strip sure expect but group 9 thought even if food bad I am big foodie wine guy company would fun  BLAST   food delicious fun creative yes called foo foo 5 star digs strip but truly hopping place where seems could intimate diner someone special hang your pals bar party patio thats where were   service good food seemed spot machine  wine list very varied some fine wines   Also save room desert great also  Yes ways but thats why Ford invented car! biggest problem wait until back L V  try again    Fun! Fun! Fun! Thanks <EOR> The Skinny affordable fusion Spanish tapas some hits misses 3 5 service prompt Paradise locations then again when place wasn't official open lol! 3 value isn't bad place hang nibble some snacks  say though chocolate tres leches die for! 3 5 My hubby came group friends enjoy Firefly two weeks prior official opening date  say place pretty hopping feeling staff wasn't quite ready ie long waits drinks lengthy time between dishes   Seeing Paradise location operates sure once open good service brisk efficient   The beauty tapas try little bit everything sorta family style  enthused now location close neighbourhood   So ordered thai beef salad chicken salad ahi tuna tartare meatballs filet mignon sliders diablo shrimp some skewers steak mushroom chicken crispy duck rolls grilled Merguez sausage   Overall say dishes only so so nothing terribly exciting would generally rate 3 stars  food generally seasoned well however often times overpowered strong sauce ex  meatballs diablo shrimp   proteins general tended overcooked end things the Merguez skewers tended trifle dry   Asian fusion dishes fell flat due oversweetness various sauces not mention duck rolls weren't really crisp    The chicken salad big surprise because thought going grilled chicken top salad topped some sherry vinegar dressing  Nope creamy mayonaise chopped chicken concoction normally between sandwiches    without bread   couldn't even taste grapes there's virtually no lettuce all plate  Would recommend    I say if you're looking good tres leches cake come Firefly  favourite thing menu long shot  cake soaked milk perfect when doldrums nice chocolate sponge drenched milk yum! definite pick me up  alone 4 star dish   Given factors I'd say Firefly deserves 3 5 star review  <EOR> Wow   great place  Just came linner   Best tapas had   Definitely try stuffed dates!! Even if hate dates  You'll never know <EOR> Apparently very popular spot town   jam packed when  Friday night 7 30 pm prime time dinner wait 40 min Friday nite table 2   Drinks food good they've pretty fast service   staff always circling around taking empty plates glasses table  Prices also very reasonable well   Definitely come back next time we're town <EOR> How give Firefly 5 stars?  Same great food all million times Paradise location but much closer house   No wait table food came super quick   tried few new dishes really good   Old ones great too   best become total regular lol  <EOR> I've huge fan location Paradise  go to place whenever friends town   good vibe locals feel it   But best thing opinion sangria    why thrilled new location   within walking distance me!  I admit girly girl    why sangria   light fruity tastes good   But other thing price   glass $6 pitcher $24   if during happy hour 3 6 pm weekdays drinks half price!  means pitcher less price drink many Las Vegas establishments     The food issue some people  hard know many tapas especially if you're hungry if you're planning drinking need something your stomach    why think works best group people split number dishes     That being said think everything menu good   never liked dates before but ones fantastic   I'd never tried octopus before but regular basis   mac cheese good especially if vegetarians your party    As service both good bad here   depends time day busy restaurant is   3 pm right when happy hour starts usually fine   plan being time regular basis   yes going walk much sangria want! <EOR> Party 12 please     We huge group arriving firefly hassle  Most taxi companies allow 4 5 people per car drove style    Party 12 nice stretch hummer  driver cool asking kind music like  dance limo ride firefly fun!!
