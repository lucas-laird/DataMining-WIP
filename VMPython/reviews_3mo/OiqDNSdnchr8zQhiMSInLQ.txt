Ratings Out Five Stars Food 3 75 Ambience 2 5 Service       3 <EOR> Heard buddies new place try  chirashi w hot soba  soba pretty satisfying actually wasn't scalding hot when came could eat pretty much straight off  chirashi pretty good nice array sashimi over generous amount sushi rice didn't finish   wasn't super impressed maybe because first time wasn't sure expect but solid meal definitely appreciated servers constantly refilling barley tea some Beatles instrumental music background  <EOR> I m Soba lover especially when served ice cold hot summer day   ecstatic when discovered I Naba Yelp reviews   I ordered Age Nasu Cold Soba noodles   eggplant sweet perfect texture   noodles fresh al dente bite   We also ordered Wakame Hot Soba noodles seweed which alright but good Age Nasu   would recommend if want hot udon but may biased because prefer Soba noodles cold     Both soba's came takikomi gohan which steamed rice bunch veggies   Very fresh healthy tasting but delicious   Overall place good   There's many Ramen options Vegas sometimes may come across 1 2 Soba Udon items regular Japanese eatery but nice place specializes Soba Udon  <EOR> Always happy find another restaurant specializing noodles    I Naba represents nice opposite recently opened Ramen Sora  Sora's ramen especially good cold winter days while I Naba's soba buckwheat noodles usually eaten cold dipping sauce perfect those hot Vegas summer days!  I stopped Wednesday night 90 minutes before closing  Only three other table occupied most them nearing end dining experience  iopted Ten zaru cold soba noodles side tempura battera cured mackeral pressed sushi rice   battera okay wasn't disappointing wow ing  only complaint tempura would liked more grated daikon otherwise just okay too   The star meal soba above average  cooked way little chewy still able absorb dipping sauce  even serve portion water noodles cooked soup dipping sauce pretty authentic!  The service also above average  only ice tea refilled regularly without prompting mean two servers only four table would hope but made feel rushed when other tables finished meals left  servers eyeballing hurry leave could close which always nice   My only complaint would prices value  prices touch high side soba noodles  Maybe just noodle lover but wish portion noodles bit larger  Overall would definitely back especially hot Vegas summer just around corner! <EOR> I very excited place since many palces good soba udon noodles Vegas   usually LA eat authentic Japanese food    When arrived nobody said hi stood around while picked seat sat down own   guess busy  but only 5 more tables filled  After waiting over 30 minutes dish came husband   Only his   while waitress said sorry food taking long   Ok   then waited more   Finally right before husband finished dish mine came out   over 45 minutes wait   just much wait something that   lunch noodle??   The restaurant new maybe still learning operate   food good see if see any improvement when back next time  <EOR> 3 5 stars   I REALLY REALLY excited try place   especially since hot Vegas  came Saturday night completely empty    I figured fairly new no really knew it   I ordered tempura soba cold hubby ordered plain soba cold well  soba noodles bit hard looked left overs since all broken lil pieces noodles all 1 1 5 long   Noodles bit disappointing but tempura good  husband decided order salmon appetizer which looked good pretty good minus fact rice salmon ratio 2 1  really liked he brought hot soba broth mix soba sauce end close meal    Overall am definitely willing give place another try hopefully long soba noodles  No complaints service but guess when only hard good service  = <EOR>
