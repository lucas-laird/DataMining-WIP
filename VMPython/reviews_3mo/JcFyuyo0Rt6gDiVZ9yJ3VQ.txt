Krayvings Yelp Review  My wife came lunch 11 am grand opening   ATMOSPHERE Not crowded comfortable amount people already lunch picking leaving 1230  Casual cafe dining open floor plan no booths outdoor seating available Spread steel chairs rectangular tables wooden tops each table seats two but tables easily pushed together larger groups Vaulted ceilings Mellow music John Mayer John Mellencamp  ORDERING Done through tablet touch screen each table Menus separated breakfast greens salad wraps bread sandwiches sides dessert drinks bowls soup grab chips cookies pastries   After select your food option customizing your order adding reducing ingredients    Keep mind adding options probably increase meal cost while reducing removing options likely keep price same  The tablets Call Server button upper right hand corner bring your attendant over  All food drinks brought server   FOOD We BLT wrap krayvings veggie wrap breakfast bacon egg rice wrap   Each wrap also small green salad dressing included   All very tasty fresh   Salads crisp crunchy slightly sweet tangy dressing    Final bill came around $24 including tax but tip  Food served brown butcher paper aluminum plate   Flatware drinking cups all ECO product plastic made plants bio degradable compostable   CUSTOMER RECOMMENDATIONS Enjoy browsing through tablet menu   Krayvings many different dishes wide variety customization options   Take time enjoy atmosphere food   RESTARUANT RECOMMENDATIONS Place label stickers tablets similar ones tables simplify matching tablets tables   tablet table didn't work initially swapped tablets different table making things confusing because would receive orders tables probably tablet linked physical table   Wait all orders table finished before bringing bills   Because two separate orders some confusion total bill would be   see customers potential taking advantage making multiple orders but only paying bill   There isn't any direct feedback whether your server gotten Call Servers notification because most servers waiting kitchen drinks bring food   option give small vibrating pagers each server when someone presses Call Server button table number pops pager   FINAL THOUGHTS Krayvings likely rapidly rise popularity due its convenient location between 215 loop Red Rock Casino Red Rock Canyon   food delicious healthy   likely overcome slight tricks launch use tablets ordering   wife likely eat again enjoy going hiking Red Rock Canyon taking friends new places eat  <EOR> Tried Chicken wrap today lunch  tablets tables super easy use made ordering absolutely amazing!

Well your answer Krayvings!  It open just few weeks some growing pains staff organization   very busy Sunday 1300 when went   Personally loved ordering your own pace personal customization your order tablet menus   What most surprised flavorful health food found all over menu   Veggie Lovers highly recommend Tofu Power Protein Bowl!  My wife loved BBQ chicken wrap mother law loved Turkey Club which huge   Give place try especially if health nut me   couldn't happier place arrived location desperately need healthy option! <EOR> I need try place again before deciding if really not    barbecue chicken salad   forgot dressing but delicious once that   Reasonable portion $9! drinks quite good however very expensive pineapple mojito not alcoholic beverage just under $7  Lastly guiltless chocolate shake research more ok but really awesome if truly guiltless! messed order couple times 2 people late lunch though correct tablet which ordered but someone could having off day  <EOR> Quite casual inexpensive yet delicious healthy food extremely accommodating staff  décor Spartan order your table via tablet but special requests easily dealt with  unusual food allergy very willing something special me  super healthy chicken bowl less $10 could only eat half it   only open couple weeks wasn't expecting them together but exceeded expectations  definitely return  <EOR> I son friend breakfast  He needed high chair but they're kept back which annoying when no waiters    need keep them accessible  But more importantly food just okay both found iPad menu extremely frustrating  Unless you're ordering food exactly menu difficult customize  don't even try delete something off order  ordered bacon egg cheese sandwich  didn't eggs wanted them because apparently didn't customize right  Sandwich ok bread very dry way thick  friend quinoa bowl she said just ok  both B12 shot drinks tan mine green  did offer fix but why did bring first place   liked mine  overall hate iPads food eh some kinks work out  try again lunch before write off  <EOR> This first visit Krayvings say may back   First off ordering proceedure via iPad convoluted confusing   pick items want then option customize item   Then place order when comes presented check   don't know most people but want order eat rather learn want order   Despite flaws execution service slow very poor   food quality fairly good but coffee ordered cold time it   back unfortunately!
