Before start review must warn reader star rating purely relative  rating because food expensive  Rather believe restaurant charges much deserves compared against very best restaurants world charge similar premium  If compare Nobu other teppan yaki restaurants such Benihana Hamada would easily receive 4 5 stars based ingredients used quality food alone for most part    Originally plan eat sushi sashimi Hyakumi other Japanese Restaurant Caesars Palace 8PM  However found Hyakumi now closed dinner Diamond Lounge around 8 15 PM talked receptionist informed Nobu's grand opening  He apologized said no sushi Nobu but he could reserve teppan yaki table 2 11 00 PM  When walked into Nobu little annoyed see indeed sushi bar well non teppan yaki seating  Although does and should not effect rating Nobu because Caesars's fault feel little tidbit information necessary  certainly reasonable think may perhaps approached experience Nobu bit negative bias  personally believe case  However still urge read caution    I came into Nobu pretty high expectations because Nobu Hard Rock Las Vegas highly acclaimed even adorned Michelin Star once upon time  into meal intrigued teppan yaki restaurant could receive such high praise then found no teppan yaki Nobu Hard Rock go figure   any case sat teppan yaki table only two tasting choices available order  no la carte option  ordered $280 per person option other option bit cheaper I think $190?   I don't remember certain   Although sake menu limited taste dry sake well met very reasonable price $25     The tasting menu ordered offered variety different courses including Toro tartare seared foie gras Maine lobster tail wagyu steak Jamon de Iberico fried rice    First Toro tartare certainly interesting  served wasabi based reduction essentially chopped toro fatty tuna mixed variety spices topped caviar  While good still some reservations regarding dish  bit pretentious take toro chop add caviar top some fancy sauce  say tables don't mess winners  Don't split 10s don't double down blackjack don't mess toro  Toro itself most delicious foods world   Furthermore foie gras overdone  Seared foie gras should undoubtedly melt your mouth  foie gras overwhelmingly tasted burnt bit crunch couple chews foie gras did ultimately melt  said just could muster courage tell table side chef face he royally messed foie gras  weaknesses teppan yaki opens itself potential inconsistency  lobster tail wagyu beef however immaculate could cooked better  wagyu beef cooked medium rare literally melts bite    As Jamon Iberico fried rice certainly say disappointed  Jamon Iberico naturally comes cured sliced thin wide  Jamon Iberico should also melt your mouth because its marbling  When put grill chopped Jamon turns bit chewy  grilled Jamon still superior quality when compared regular ham whole point grilling Jamon extract fat order fried rice just much more savory delicious  However end result bit lacking am sure if added taste dish compromised texture Jamon   As eating fried rice decided order traditional Japanese garnish takuan accompany dish  took while served 10 mins when served takuan surprisingly poor quality  good Japanese restaurant expect served takuan off white dark yellow color  takuan bright yellow cut way thick  most troubling thing takuan used sushi  simply unacceptable restaurant touts its high quality food serve such poor quality takuan  understand Nobu just opened however menu just big miss  only circumstances under which would recommend Nobu now if craving Wagyu willing pony $280 your guest s plus alcohol  Otherwise forget it  <EOR> Lucky Las Vegas!!
