Pet peeve rant  If wanted f *king margarita I'd ordered one  End rant   Realizing weren't going order booze he pretty much ignored us  ask everything  more refills water even when empty glasses front face f* king cutlery  Don't even started lifting heavy bins dirty dishes washing hands  Oh took least 10 minutes find print check   At point bar completely unmanned least 6 minutes  bunch servers huddled around drink order area waiting drinks made  Yup bar area = major clusterf$ k  lets face it    restaurant perhaps 25% capacity maybe 40 customers being freaking generous   The bartender actually gall say just he handed check which he finally around printing out  Sorry poor service tonight  just slammed  whom wonder because joint wasn't even hopping    In way totally dick move try garner sympathy  He knew service shoddy but didn't really acknowledge until he realized he going s* tty tip  Sorry douche  still shitty tip anyway  He's lucky left anything all   On food We ordered fish tacos 3 tacos $13 regular price tacos al pastor  3 tacos $11 regular price steak flatbread 2 large portions $11 regular price ahi tuna tacos 3 tacos $9 regular price   Portion sizing general bar menu rather generous  However given lower quality food large amounts boon all   We sampled chips salsa  server just plopped them table no idea kind salsa was  warm better cold but neither truly worth mentioning  chips thinner variety needed some salt   Ahi tuna tacos pretty bad  fish weird sweetness singularily unpleasant  Encased taco shell made soggy watery flavourless green slime masquerading guacamole believe definitely worst dish night   The fish tacos very skimpy portion fish it  maybe because many freaking slices red raw onion actually identify there's some underseasoned fish hiding there  Texturally uninteresting definitely needed more cabbage add some crunch  just terribly bland very interesting dish   Tacos al pastor legit  looks chunky stewed upchuck instead roasted pork spit  If wasn't bad enough pork desperately flavourless fish tacos  Mixing grilled pineapple wasn't going save it  pretty mediocre   The flatbread de bistek only thing truly palatable night  steak actually seasoned flatbread crisp almost thicker cracker  definitely wasn't anything astounding but least okay  But finger food really messy eat without knife fork    Overall given s* tty service okay the verge of nasty food no inclination return  seriously debating given place 1 star review  However food bad but wasn't completely inedible  joint squeeks 2 starred review  <EOR> Nothing place Summerlin fresh new  expect regular spot me  <EOR> Visited Cantina Laredo second time  Food great! server Eric awesome!

Tasty food friendly staff awesome ambiance good happy hour!  I back many many times!   Best guac everrrr  <EOR> Not good all  Staff helpful food horrible  mess beans? <EOR> We chose eat late lunch Wednesday around 2 30  decor quite modern wide open  definitely chill air ordered coffee  waitress very accommodating regards inquiries menu  coffee lukewarm took 25 minutes lunch arrive  spinach enchiladas boring prepared using very small tortillas  brisket tacos tough chew dry lacking any distinct flavor  Rice beans good small portion size  Did mention coffee? waitress never checked see if needed refill  Overall disappointed quality food portion size flavor service  <EOR> I stumbled onto restaurant last St  Paddy's day while Chicago  love! decor awesome food great but margaritas won heart  Housemade margie mix no fake stuff   love tableside guac chips salsa deeee lish  favorite meals chips salsa margaritas  careful two drinks you're making new friends  Sit bar talk Jennifer  She's best!  I want come try brunch! <EOR> Service less great   GM Mark receptive comments constructive criticism  tell he heard same thing before but no change made menu waitress serving ordered correcting errors printed menu unacceptable   ahi tuna taco appetizer amazing  tortilla soup just mediocre  menu item stating chicken stuffed shrimp spinach only served between two dried cutlets sauce three shrimp spinach between cutlets does constitute stuffed any means   now because if things don't change place won't long inSummerlin  <EOR> Cantina Laredo fabulous addition dining scene West Las Vegas  girl could eat chips salsa dinner every night happy upscale Mexican food welcomed addition Las Vegas  just can't wait weather turn nice dine two patios fire pits indoor outdoor bar going hit spring   I grabbed lunch couple times food wonderful each visit  Upon arrival ask if you'd try signature Top Shelf Guacamole  fresh delish way start your meal   roll cart your table then prepare made to order guac  can't wrong that   As menu whole diverse lot lighter typical Mexican fare  won't leave feeling ate huge greasy meal but rather nice sensible lunch  Over visits tried Mini Ahi Tacos my favorite! Queso Fundido Pollo Chipotle signature dish Enchiladas Vera Cruz  All dishes delighted  back sure   I took peek Happy Hour menu looks pretty fun reasonably priced  even Ladies' Night Thursday half priced drinks   yet check but to do list sure! <EOR> I Cantina Laredo handful times now yet poor experience  think favorite entree enchiladas y asada plate  Amazing!  On last lunch date Cantina introduced apple pie  told smelled heaven  Now yet actually smell heaven but if could image heaven might someday smell Cantina's apple pie right there  served hot skillet drenched brandied butter sauce    die for!   I've always good service received beverages food chip refills timely manner  absolutely return Cantina Laredo again soon especially since aren't many nice Mexican restaurants Summerlin area  <EOR> Love restuarant!  many places Vegas good mexican food but place awesome!  Very comforting inviting atmosphere   Great happy hour specials fav half off wine Wednesday!  Great service very yummy food!  Ahi tuna tacos delish! <EOR> We excited try happy hour menu new place Tivoli Village  excitement quickly turned into dismay experienced shitty service crappy food  When happy hour although prefer sitting table oftentimes sit bar counter if concerned slow service waitstaff  Typically bartenders much better job refilling your water attending regular waitstaff  Unfortunately exception rule  Frankly probably some worst service ever sitting bar  very understanding if bar restaurant busy but wasn't those cases  bartender asked if interested happy hour menu wanted drink  replied yes would start ice water until chance peruse menu  He acknowledged but then proceeded take care other bar customers next several minutes before eventually serving ice water  impatient waiting give menu grabbed menu placed aside other customers sitting few seats away   We decided order Mahi Mahi fish tacos $13 pork al pastor tacos $11 ahi tuna tacos $9 steak flatbread $11 save room mango tres leches dessert  tacos came orders 3  Everything half price happy hour except desserts  served complimentary basket tortilla chips 2 kinds salsa mild spicy  chips unusually thin salsas unremarkable  order came pretty quickly 10 15 minutes ordered  flatbread huge  bad but great also best dish far  pork al pastor distant second quite disappointing  Instead pieces pork sliced off rotating spit consisted ground pork marinated Mexican spices but severely lacking salt  Mahi Mahi tacos bland very skimpy fish drowning raw red onion salsa which completely drowned other flavors  ahi tuna tacos least favorite  unusually sweet soggy due extremely watery bland guacamole underneath  way restroom spotted dessert display tray sitting random counter  hoping perhaps dessert would bring some minor redemption but mango tres leches did look legit decided pass   Now let's continue talking service  telling bartender only wanted drink water he asked if sure didn't want margarita  find second guessing upselling tactic incredibly annoying  If wanted order alcoholic drink then would've ordered one  add insult injury attempt attention wave down numerous times everything water refills getting check even eating utensils believe not! least couple times water glasses completely empty ignored even though he standing directly front he finished entering orders into register  Once finally check bartender actually gall say Sorry poor service tonight  just slammed  hope understand  Oh really? Maybe we're both blind because certainly didn't appear busy all  fact place mostly empty  Listen if you're going own poor service then don't try justify some BS excuse  Hey Luis understand lucky still tipped 10% happy hour pricing instead big fat goose egg  usually tip 15% regular non discounted pricing but guy didn't even deserve gave him   In summary inauthentic Mexican food gross subpar even Americanized standards combined abysmal service gets Cantina Laredo 1 5 stars  Since wife rounded 2 stars rounding down 1  Frankly shocked pathetic both food service were  expected place would rate least 3 stars but guess never know sure until try  Never again  <EOR> The worst thing happen restaurant exactly happening here  Great! Sucks! Great! Sucks! decided try  Saturday afternoon  right bar drinks food  water  10 minutes later  Ordered drinks  No menu  Nothing   10 minutes later  First drink  text book case poor management   One bartender service restaurant bar  Did chance try food  girl came dropped off chips salsa  No napkins No plates nothing  hungry  $23 2 drinks  Asked roving manager check  Glad cash because would still waiting  walked over Brio  Wife very disappointed  She really wanted Mexican  Brio top game  Great service  Great bartenders  Great food  Great drinks  personal recommendation? Try Laredo 3 months if still there  won't back  <EOR> I read something place local weekly newspapers recommended some friends taking birthday lunch   space well done but most places actual food just okay   Of course being Mexican restaurant expecting Viva Michoacan  Lindo Michoacan ha! never noticed same name  The food okay but v small portions much them  other reviewers server seems really want drink expensive booze   I'm drinker gets annoying Again place special effort again  <EOR> This 4th trip  always Outstanding !! Amanda   Waitress two visits Service second none  multiple selections Menu Queso Laredo Top Shelf Guacamole Tacos Asada Steak let's forget Mexican Apple Pie  All them die for  become most Favorite Restaurant's  KUDOS WHOLE STAFF!!!! <EOR> The food wasn't really authentic mexican  didn't try table side guacamole because extra but I''m guessing probably better then cheaper  Worst guacamole ever even real? Ceviche tasted marinated tabasco  Mahi Mahi tacos okay better  shrimp enchilada's hardly any shrimp anything inside them but drenched sour cream yum  mean if into kind fake mexican food should okay but all honesty should really just cafe rio instead  However waitress very sweet  <EOR> Awesome place  food delicious  customer service perfect  manager Mark always sure customers happy taken care of   recommend place everyone because am impressed experience  <EOR> Came half group poppy den brunch some margaritas  told great $8!!!!  place sleek  very impressed  decor  sat round table right across bar  ordered house margaritas  Before say didn't them I didn't let explain   Hussongs Mandalay bay best margaritas      ever! Simple simple recipe  Fresh squeezed lime juice homemade simple syrup gold tequilla grand mariner floater   it  home outstanding  Nooooooow when want rita always lacking  lucky enough 10 minutes before $2 mimosa brunch special ended  2 those good  margarita??? Eeehhh  first send back incredibly sweet  replacement better  didn't eat anything sure food is  Service good  I'd back try brunch special oh some mimosas too! <EOR> I am torn review       Met some friends dinner   love Tivoli frequent many places although turning over quite quick days   sat bar cocktail   Service impeccable  chips salsa served quickly YUMMO!  Friends joined bar tasted some tequilas before settling into table dinning room   where things down hill   I would say least 10 minutes passed before anyone stopped table   He then said he slammed would shortly   He stopped again 5 minutes later waters swooped away again   Finally came order pretty simple ceviche appetizer combo fajitas salad share between three entrees   also ordered drink time   Well food came all together not requested drink also didn't show yet      He ran off drink   realized didn't tortillas fajitas also needed chips ceviche   just disaster   Then table full dirty dishes he brings desert tray over REALLY??  am sitting garbage could clean PLEASE!   The food amazing!!  can't say enough but would never eat dinning room again   would stick bar   Bartenders awesome!!! <EOR> Went place last night party 7  Told waitress very beginning would need separate checks  Food very average thought  Service good all  person send carnitas tacos back two times decided he lost appetite  asking check could leave took 45 minutes checks which two correct  When received checks nerve automatically add 20% tip  waitress did deserve 20% tip  never seen anything more 18% added think very high well  required law leave any certain amount tip away adding automatic 20%  Very disappointing never back  Food = good  Service = terrible  Automatic 20% someone didn't deserve = BULLSHIT! <EOR>
