avocado skillet  food came fast probably less five minutes  enjoyed everything tasted  Service efficient came often check take away plates when done   The only thing threw off going cup soup mac n cheese but told only offer bowls didn't order soup  didn't want eat much since already ordering heavy comfort meal  bugs when restaurants don't offer what's writing  Other thought food good enough come back  coworkers liked sure back  <EOR> Came lunch MTO Café Monday afternoon MLK day extremely busy   okay because counter order then number your food brought you   long line gave chance peruse paper menu before could read menu board counter   both indoor outdoor seating but outside tables shade time glad table opened inside when ready sit down   It nice day but little chilly walking around Downtown Summerlin felt soup sandwich day us   When counter told while menu includes both cup bowls soup did cups available   Okay   so ordered bowls   definitely cheap lunch   2 orders soup sandwiches sodas $50     I ordered tomato basil soup which hot rich hearty   says comes cheddar toast which assumed crustini but actually sliver regular grilled cheese   and really good   soup toast meal didn't need anything else   But sandwich   ordered Grilled Cheese   Unlike kind came soup consisted brie honey toasted walnuts brioche   trying something outside box but sure why thought would this   really think sandwich appeal lot people but just me   However side salad came sandwich Amazing   Baby greens roasted peppers fantastic balsamic   Yum    The BF ordered calm chowder he said best he's Vegas   Both flavor mass amount actual clams dish   chowder enough meal but he also ordered Hero sandwich   grilled chicken prosciutto salami mix looked just salad   He took most home but said terrific   All all enjoyed fresh space food Freestyle Coke machine back sometime when take 40 mile journey Downtown Summerlin  <EOR> A mistake  food heavy greasy  Bob which nearly light organic sounds

food man REALLY recommend place  <EOR> This cafe awesome  atmosphere great  food MAGNIFICENT  meatloaf best ever had  Mac n cheese bomb  owner very personable  LOVE LOVE LOVE PLACE  <EOR> Stating day announced felt MTO Café most relevant restaurant list eateries Downtown Summerlin some shame took long visit store's opening but having enjoyed Chef Johnny Church's breakfast creations Downtown
