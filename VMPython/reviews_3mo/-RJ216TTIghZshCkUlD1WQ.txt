Sushi Takashi located former short lived Hiromaru ramen joint  But changed interior completely dark sexy colors wood cool booths wide sushi bar  taking seat bar met man himself Chef Takashi friendly cool person  While la carte menu more interested shiny laminated menu some more unique options  side contained 10 course 12 course menu  other side combo menu whole lot options including bottomless roll never ending salmon bowl quick to go bento  also $80 ayce option  decided 12 course   This interesting because wasn't traditional kaiseki where portions super small  value Takashi's better most izakayas valley  else interesting modify options course menu see fit   Before courses began brought some mini Japanese crackers snack on  good   The first course garlic edamame  spices really good bright  edamame vibrant color   The next course tuna carpaccio  fish quality excellent well soy dressing yuzu it   Next came salad  think made great combo soba noodle salmon skin options  noodles perfectly cooked salmon skin great texture them  enjoyed tanginess mayo dressing used bring everything together   The meat dish came next  ordered beef teriyaki  simplified version grilled beef seasoned lightly  beef very good quality cooked spot on medium rare  sauce kept light side helped amplify taste beef rather mask some other spots tend do   The chef also gave taste king crab available  don't normally see item most sushi restaurants appreciated fact   The next course roll course which choose menu any specialty rolls menu  chose King club roll which king crab made into roll avocado  noticed immediately rice cooked perfectly hard soft personally don't strong vinegar taste liked Takashi's more neutral sweet because gives more natural taste rice  Seriously king crab avocado? Now  talking about!  Next course chicken chose karage  liked fact chicken PIPING HOT!! lot sushi restaurants Vegas learn thing two Takashi making karage more hot   Next seafood course came picked oysters  Six large oysters brought Asian mignonette style sauce  fresh sweet  literally could eaten 50 these  amazing    Next sukiyaki came out  came generous amount beef fun eating noodles onions scallions    The baked dish next looked dynamite baked roll came very tasty well   My nigiri dish came afterwards say am impressed high quality fish using here  higher Goyemon's more Yummy Grill's Lake Mead Not Eastern ave!!   rice perfect everything just really well together   The soup course then came  ordered creamy white stew  Looking back would probably chosen miso  liked earthiness stew but wasn't really cup tea   Chef Takashi wanted try tuna belly before last course gesture grand opening  Once again using high quality fish thick slices  Mikey likes it!  My last course came which dessert course  ordered tempura ice cream  ice cream exquisite batter very neutral tasting which highlighted ice cream   Throughout evening realized never felt rushed throughout evening  service awesome even though brand new restaurant  actually really long time since felt just really comfortable eating sushi restaurant  impression eating Strip high end sushi restaurant without having pay those overpriced exorbitant prices those restaurants Strip usually command  Even though just opened if able maintain quality would favorite sushi restaurants Las Vegas  Great value great quality great service great ambiance  all really ask for  kinda over AYCE thing looking bit more Sushi Takashi delivers! <EOR> The very first thing say Sushi Takashi food very very good   food good any sushi restaurant strip except don't hotel pay expensive price!  Sushi Takashi offers variety Japanese food only sushi   wide range desserts shaved ice tempura ice cream well other Japanese cuisine sukiyaki curry   There All You Can Eat option around seventy dollars but course options variegated choices while still very filling   tried ten course sushi dinner more enough food     My particular favourite scallop carpaccio   topped masago tangy sauce very thin lemon slice garnished small bit cilantro   tangy lemon sauce blended very nicely rich buttery scallop   The quality variety food great but think food could served more timely fashion  I want plenty time wolf down!  Overall felt restaurant gave upper hand  I could enjoy high quality sushi Japanese food without going strip   also interesting different option traditional All You Can Eat plus there's no time limit! <EOR> The truckload food Takashi pushes $40 twelve course dinners Restaurant Week look Restaurant Weak   Seriously    would need attach garbage disposal your stomach through bad boy   Maybe if car broke down Mount Charleston walked all way would possible?  while value ambition friendly service remarkable design upgrades cannot denied fault execution general flow menu   Even myself find hard believe am complaining much food but am going there      As example course plate #4 #8 could easily chicken teriyaki huge sushi roll 6 oysters karaage fried chicken then beef sukiyaki    mixtape going Mozart Slipknot Whitney Houston last year's Grammy winning polka artist   Why oysters right dead center 12?  fried meat sukiyaki real life?    Something should harmonious beginning end but just looked battles within battles   menu vs stomach capacity food vs ever growing takeout bag servers kept loading waistline vs pants tastebuds' sanity vs holy shit we're only #5?? server informed only person able plow through all since opened He Yelper    Nice job Yelper   Did Home Depot Lowe's attachment? If you're still going battles between course choices #3 Soba Salad vs Tofu Salad vs Potato Salad wife's Soba Salad won   dressing mixed cold noodles crisp greens excellent   also choice salad topping grilled salmon chicken salmon skin    both grilled salmon although perhaps salmon skin might come off luxurious crouton way go   Don't load potato!  Trust me     #6 Oysters vs Snow Crab TKO oysters    Even though crab nicely presented chilled plate could never match 6 large raw oysters wooden boat   would retail least $18 elsewhere   back next time dining la carte      #7 Tempura vs Karaage barely touched due fullness still come but I'd tempura which nice medley veggies along 2 pieces shrimp   Even though karaage dry uninspiring lasted better fridge whereas tempura should eaten immediately really bad couple days later     Already stuffed gills point considered asking return tomorrow finish rest   Would OK if just left credit card overnight?  saw foot spa same plaza   Maybe could come back hour?  moment sounded good time any take cigarette smoking     #8 Beef Sukiyaki vs Diced Steak Bitch please   only did steak put fight didn't even walk into ring   Flawless victory!  sukiyaki classic   rich filled noodles vegetables semi fatty beef which made broth even better   asked side raw egg dip beef into made those 6 combined bites took before whisked away takeout boxes even better   could standalone entrée     #9 Mini Doria vs 4 pc Baked Fantasy should rid course altogether   doria bowl rice topped mix ground beef tomato sauce cream   No right mind would want everything else   Ditto gross hot sushi roll filled cream cheese   Lose lose     Server Anything else? Lap band surgery  #10 4 piece nigiri vs Salmon Bowl more rice! vs Hamburger Nigiri won   smallest portion food!  Tony T another table hamburger which FULL HAMBURGER BUN ALL FRIES   Am going crazy?    Some may avoid spot because AYCE $80 per person but exorbitant amount food walked it'll more all can't eat   5 more individual meals leftovers had!  Portions should halved if quartered everything needs rearranged someone sane eyes    No would complain paying $40 that  <EOR> This new sushi restaurant fiancee definitely coming back to!  Fresh sashimi hard come desert Sushi Takashi definitely delivers!  menu items unique delish but most all fresh!  Even normal cooked ebi nigiri tasted amazing dat's know!    great change pace typical AYCE sushi place w the same stuff   Kawika Chef Takashi provided outstanding service great recommendations!  Mahalo!  Can't wait return try amaebi uni! D <EOR> This new sushi restaurant opened where hiromaru cafe Japon used be    I must say food excellent  ordered $40 12 course option  full right around course 10  any coursing menu most courses full plates just 2 bites per course    Next time think 10 course option $27  <EOR> Can newest inhabitant former Cafe de Japon Hiromaru Ramen spot Cathay Plaza achieve longevity? If tonight's imperfect yet delicious meal indication then should   Michael K 's glowing review piqued interest Sushi Takashi when friend invited eagerly accepted  arrived bit before official 5pm start greeted warm employees cool air  decor bears little resemblance past businesses wooden tables floors bright but overpowering light   While waiting companion able peruse la carte menu various combination menu offerings  three roll combo $25 95 bottomless dinner $22 95 both seem decent options another time even AYCE offering $79 95 might worth splurge special occasion when asked server said 2 orders carpaccio could included addition premium items listed fine print    However I'd already set mind 12 course sushi dinner $39 95 which contains sukiyaki choice oyster king crab couple other small upgrades when compared 10 course dinner $29 95    Before critiquing food should note flow dishes little bit rushed times but nothing left long postponed dessert until ready   Complimentary appetizer Kakinotane  Rice crackers soy wasabi flavorings  Great crunch  wasabi packs punch if you're accustomed it   #1 Edamame  friend's peperoncino didn't add much flavor but loved choice garlic  Perfectly cooked beans boot   #2 Carpaccio  Yellowtail scallop shared  Both delightfully fresh roe nice topping scallop  Best dishes night   #3 Salad  Sampled some friend's tofu w salmon skin  Some better tofu sure but skin little charred taste  soba salad ridiculously good powerful but sickeningly heavy dressing slick noodles substantial tasty grilled salmon   #4 Teriyaki meat  beef tasty grilled more tender tough  see no reason choose chicken unless beef strictly outside your diet   #5 Sushi roll shared   King Club roll featured king crab although hesitate call star  Its flavor lost until eaten alone  wouldn't order again since proportion crab isn't sufficient  second roll Blue Diamond better option  featured salmon cucumber super white tuna garlic ponzu   #6 Seafood cold dish  both chose oysters  Each plate featured four plump oysters an apparent downsize prior weeks parsley garnish  thoroughly fresh plump flavorful writing assaulted digestive systems  I'd pick again well   #7 Fried food  both chose tempura which generous basket three shrimp tempura six vegetable tempura  batter little prominent sauce little weak  I'd pick something else next time   #8 Beef  both sukiyaki which presented very hot bowl  where started exceed capacity best thing being AYCE meal doggy bagging something problem  did eat small portion delightful tender beef silky tofu sweet broth   #9 Hot entree  both chose mini doria  I'd liken lasagna but rice  ground beef rice bowl place menu because its prominent tomato flavoring  good but 4 piece baked roll would better match menu and require stomach expansion   But hey more leftovers!  #10 Miscellany  into left field burger  gooey cheese toasted bun onions surprisingly tasty  medium doneness patty acceptable  However fries accompanied burger good  salted properly fluffy inside but exteriors mostly devoid any sort crunch  would skip burger solely avoid having see pale yellow potato pieces ever again   #11 Soup  Creamy corn sounds good but very watery  almost full care point but shame good egg corn would flavor diluted   #12 Dessert  Nothing special friend's matcha jelly ice cream  tempura ice cream wasn't exceptional but sweetness toppings somehow hit spot right time  Neither choice mistaken gourmet premium   Despite some flaws meal great  could see myself returning soon  poster outside highlights history Chef Takashi pioneer AYCE Las Vegas but featured non AYCE offerings would satiate all but most stretchy stomached  hey there's even stamp card 10 12 course dinner  <EOR> I often search hot new when particularly mood something specific  enjoy being Guinea pig new restaurant town!     aaaand ended Sushi Takashi solo dinner tonight!
