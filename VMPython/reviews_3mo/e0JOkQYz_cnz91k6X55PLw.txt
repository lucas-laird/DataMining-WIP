Quick story Las Vegas mom's 65th birthday looking restaurant help celebrate  Originally aunt made reservations Switch another restaurant Encore  However researched Switch Yelp saw 2 star review time =X suggested try somewhere else came across Sinatra Yelp  4 1 2 star review seemed appealing thus suggested Sinatra  say least now nervous because burden now came onto me  However end evening Sinatra did disappoint mom very happy meal experience = Onto details   The ambiance atmosphere Sinatra class  modern decor hint old Italian combined high ceilings chandeliers huge portrait Ol Blue Eyes himself view flower garden created feeling elegance  Even chairs impressive if throne itself  However beautiful hostess staff helped each patron seats hence night began   The service Sinatra really blew away  waiter Michael very amiable down to earth  portly stature combined friendly personality almost made call Uncle Mikey! Although might expect bit pretentiousness such classy restaurant Michael certainly dispelled notion  He welcomed Sinatra provided quick description restaurant well award winning Chef Theo Schoenegger  Michael described Sinatra obviously Italian restaurant  However Chef Theo approached menu taking classic Italian dishes utilized reverse culinary engineering deconstruct ingredients  He then implements influence dishes create modern feel classic Italian selections  said he elegantly over menu giving brief description dishes he recommends  hearing Michael's monologue must say excited!  While waiting food arrive dad brought bottle wine table 2005 Caymus Special Selection  believe corkage fee around $40? Michael took orders sommelier or wine steward quickly came table asked if we'd wine placed decanter  saying yes observed wine master work delicately pouring wine its original bottle into decanter then taking bottle close lighted candle observe if any sediments left  few minutes allowing wine aerate breathe within decanter she sampled wine taste any tannins  Deemed ready  she brought wine table witnessing all made wine even more enjoyable! actually just came Napa Valley consumed much wine during trip as expected haha dad having conversation her  She very charming answered many wine related questions nice   Okay onto food  Sorry wait! appetizers decided share amongst 5 us  ordered two orders each Assaggini Di Mare quartet sea Polpettine meatballs polenta mushrooms Cappesante seared Maine scallops   didn't much sea quartet but definitely vouch Polpettine Cappesante! meatballs bursting flavor well scallops  Together celery kumquat fruits diverse combination scallops produced refreshing taste palate kumquat complimented scallops well while celery acted bridge put two tastes together   I ordered ravioli butternut squash vanilla amaretto second choice  bit disappointed taste bit bland palate  Perhaps butternut squash? vanilla foam top however nice touch ravioli  dad recommended Agnolotti ricotta herbs parmesan sauce chives maybe next time   For main course ordered Colorado Rack Lamb along side mashed Yukon Gold potato  Yum! lamb tender flavorful! meat tasted delicate literally hanging thread off meat  potato puree excellent compliment lamb which suggested Michael  sure Chef Theo did but try meat see yourself!  For dessert bread pudding gelato  contrasting flavors temperatures made end dining experience even more enjoyable!  Overall greatly enjoyed experience Sinatra highly recommend! no themed restaurant casino fine Italian dining its best!  P S  Sorry long review =X lol <EOR> What great time! party 10 took excellent care us   appetizers incredible     I think tried them all!   John Dory Filet amazing   can't remember desert    I think 10th bottle champagne then!  Great place great atmosphere  <EOR> A very upscale italian restaurant riding off coattails Frank Sinatra's image Sinatra Encore good example Italian haute cuisine   The dress code business casual almost all men wearing jackets boots women also dressing well  However clean pair tennis shoes nice jeans collared shirt under sweater fine   I family ordered two appetizers share  5 different entrees   Bread served your choice individual baguettes raisin nut bread fennel bread  All three weren't very impressive fresh fact dissapointing  presentation butter however excellent already warmed spreading   The appetizers We ordered Tonnato slivers tuna fish served raw roe drizzled oil  came side sauce believe made fish absolutely incredible  highly aerated looks creamy but nutty beautifully subtle umami flavor it  currently mission find myself    it'll probably require some machinery honest aerate perfectly   The other appetizer polpettine meatballs cubes polenta  meatballs soft but didn't any special flavor them  nice crumbly without being mealy savory  polenta excellent though liked multiple textures  visible crust topside bottom firm much lighter crust its sides but very soft crumbly center melts your mouth   The entrees We ordered rigatoni risotto pasta dish called chitarra dry aged New York steak   The rigatoni made tomato cream sauce hint cheese fresh basil big huge fresh shrimp  dish good nice fancy restaurant but overpriced death  30 bucks rigatoni pasta doesn't taste any better supermarket Barilla bit dissapointment   The risotto came baked Main lobster absolutely delicious  lobster succulent sweet risotto reduced flavored just right compliment it   The chitarra spaghetti dish hand rolled spaghetti again tastes box  least perfect al dente  made cream based wild mushroom saute seasoned chives  screwed dish making bit salty taken back  When came back came back suspiciously quick especially when told would remade tasted realized just dumped more sauce into dilute it  Must've premade   And finally steak  gorgeous 14oz New York strip cooked medium rare exactly cooked broiler great crust all throughout  dry aged beef delicious flavor exquisite let more kept chewing  especially loved fattier edges contrasted leaner center  Just great  came side potatoes some wild mushrooms but those just speck meal  steak fantastic   The service nothing short exemplary true fine dining restaurant  would definitely come again but then again town where just many fine dining restaurants try stick place  overall wasn't impressed some food despite prestige seems hype restaurant  happy meal but price pay think 40 bucks person average  Safely 50 expect nothing short home run  <EOR> Really enjoyed place  atmosphere very nice   Elegant but stuffy  Love bar service good  food came super fast   lobster risotto which great   deserts special  tried two chocolate filled doughnuts creme brulee   looked better then tasted  Anyhow over all really liked restaurant   would again no prob  <EOR>
