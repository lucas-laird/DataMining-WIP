Ordered combination tempura Korean Ramen  tempura cooked well selection veggie shrimp great!  The Korean ramen disappointment sadly    instant Korean ramen  veggies still dehydrated tough  did garnish fresh spring onion however  would recommend making real ramen taking off menu  wanted instant ramen would gone market next door added water $2 bowl  Sorry just honest real!   I'm hoping all eat sushi  better  sure if back try though if use short cuts food   <EOR> I live Chinatown area noticed place new  atmosphere restaurant great service outstanding  galbi some best ever quality nigiri also great  Some items menu disappointing however such seared salmon   drenched lemon sauce very overpowering    I think earned another shot near future very hopeful menu improve continue  If you're mood some AYCE definitely give try! <EOR> Doh! Why did come here?! way Mr  Tofu when lady told try Doh because food really good    I definitely regret decision  AYCE review perhaps may better experience   tried items tapas menu   portion sizes joke price quality presentation   regular tapas size most appetizers   ordered okonomiyaki bulgogi galbi Korean ramen kim chee fried rice   okonomiyaki only dish okay terms flavor but no way amazing   seemed lot Korean pancake disguised Japanese dish  ordered regular honestly cannot imagine small tapas portion would be   regular kim chee fried rice came size small rice bowl   and pretty much lacks any real flavor   also ordered galbi regular size tapas bulgogi    but when arrived both same size dish   Very sketchy when brought server he seemed kind confused wasn't sure if regular tapas size   really wasn't rocket science literally 3 small slices beef dish    He back kitchen confirmed made mistake   He then tell received regular size bulgogi he would allow keep it   very generous you?!  regular size bulgogi dish size hand    and small hands   regular galbi finally came regular size portion should be   clearly waiter didn't really favor bulgogi   Perhaps should just own your mistake   However definitely galbi just kalbi cut off bone really wasn't tender flavorful  Korean ramen looks instant ramen fancy pot bowl    pretty lame  Being Korean run establishment    you would think would Korean food better   better Korean food food court   Way better Korean options Vegas   even same plaza   positive did decor restaurant   But overall server just awkward really friendly knowledgeable  Hiring teenagers don't really care jobs bad idea business  no plans return  satisfied meal grab snack elsewhere afterwards    <EOR> Back story came first time month half ago party 7 adults 2 kids    very disappointed service time just getting chopsticks took awhile  But least server apologized food okay rolls really thick brought decent time    wasn't going write review because felt forgiving because brand new restaurant       Here am back 2nd try giving Doh benefit doubt    First off came party 3 total  came around 8 30pm    Right door visually several tables booths available  asked hostess long wait 3 she said 30 mins because isn't table available but because enough servers     Really?! server's name Dan  He started off really nice honest he even denied item off menu honestly said he didn't way taste   2nd time hasn't improved since first visit   Incident #2 First Lady dropped off first dish didn't know she dropping off when asked was   asked server politely refill water third time he finally refill but he took cups table brought them kitchen back refills but before coming back drop off water he stopped computer place another party's order  Really??  hella sketchy?! made more sketchy boyfriends refilled hot green tea looked bubbles spit!

Also girls bringing food didn't know half rolls were    Down biggest problem Doh CONSISTENCY  Although presentation very appetizing dishes huge problem consistency  stand garnishes way plate same dishes different but food should always stay same  Some rolls ordered liked did taste good when ordered secondary roll  also ordered buttered scallops literally every single piece varying textures  wasn't going eat anymore first piece way soft fell apart but friend said all different  didn't actually believe until kept popping them into mouth discovered right she was    All all Doh okay restaurant  much better AYCE sushi places town same price Doh unless dragged back wouldn't again  <EOR> This best all eat sushi restaurants want suggest getting soft shell crab tempura well bulgogi beef  good  definitely going come again! <EOR> the food really great especially all eat special but extra patient your food refills! <EOR> Best AYCE sushi Vegas!
