Grand opening 20th May  Stepped today thinking Brodards but gave shot anyways   The place new clean nice artwork lot employees lol   Our server friendly older gentlemen  He pretty good! He some suggestions before meal even advice some things may come back for   Had pork patty spring rolls start  two order $5  good! liked dipping sauce wasn't overly strong  What's point having fresh ingredients spring roll when your sauce over powers it?   My friend beef pho  $7 bowl small but lot noodles  friend said bit sweeter normal pho  Also  really well priced IMO   I vermicelli noodle salad grilled beef egg roll  ingredients fresh   I pretty disappointed mine though overall  meat portion little skimpy tiny cut egg roll  mixing around tasted good but nothing special   Overall good visit  Didn't try more  pretty average but gave them four because nothing necessarily bad experienced server   Just want say huge service  drinks refilled frequently being friendly long way  refuse frequent restaurants pho Kim long don't seem value diners  friendliness long way   Overall solid Vietnamese restaurant enjoyed return to  best?

Onto rest menu also ordered #37 which grilled pork shrimp fried shrimp cake shredded pork skin egg cake   price seemed little more expensive other Vietnamese restaurants but portion huge couldn't even finish half it   addition serve rice dish bowl broth quail egg inside   If similar broth use pho then definitely clean taste palate ended drinking whole bowl   Normally don't drink broth served rice dishes since often seems very bland   service also stellar brought food quickly refilled waters several times without having flag someone down   downside restaurant limited pho soup options 2 menu no bun bo hue my fav!    Also chicken lovers    they don't grilled chicken option vermicelli bowls rice plates   Most likely summer Vietnamese spot order copious amounts nem nuong cuon next visit! <EOR> The food delicious!

Besides rice plates also good  totally recommend place come back again next time vacation  <EOR> Heard place run same owners Brodard's SoCal finally checked yesterday homies Stephanie K Michael K  grilled pork spring rolls just good remember but noticed much more expensive here   2 rolls $4 95 \ just can't enough crunch when bite into mmmmmm  Tried some Stephanie's fried rice which good but little creeped Michael's crepe  Noticed menu only 3 4 pages long which pretty concise compared Brodard's but probably good idea bistro concept with  also serve pho here just look star stickers menu   Didn't notice dessert case though no macarons The restaurant overall nice clean comfortably decorated  commenting nice place Viet restaurant while also trying figure say name   all could come nem nem nem lol    The restaurant probably only 1 3 full fairly quiet compared Brodard's  Service decent most part kept getting water refills  When came time ask check took little while though because couldn't locate anybody attention  Guess dies down when gets later? Just happy pork spring roll fix without going all way Cali  <EOR> Nem Nuong Bistro new place try variety Spring Rolls place great purpose but feel food lacking little  would see improvement dishes before come back  guess decent vietnamese restaurant but anything special me  give them credit service though because most vietnamese restaurants terrible service employees quick organized  But other food isn't worth money      <EOR> Nem Nuong? better term delightful bites   Nom nuong! even better yet Nom nom nuong!! sure lot say spring rolls your life  But trust trying nem nuong here    never spring rolls yo life!!!  I've never Brodards Cali based spring roll institution which hear same owners Nem Nuong  seeing pics made Brodards famous check out   The restaurant really well designed  probably most upscale Vietnamese restaurant town  sitting down ordering food came reasonable time   Nem Nuong basically pork spring rolls  But run of the mill ones typically served  would comparing Little Ceasars pizza made Italian Michelin rated restaurant  think sets apart fried egg roll shell stuff inside roll  gives marvelous crunch!! wondering while eating why doesn't every place this? should law  enforce it    Judge Dredd  Because am law  pork generous piece really tender well seasoned  probably best bites all year! But hearing little bit overpriced compared Brodard's but  typical Vegas food compared So cal food   Bahn Xeo Now if guys know favorite Vietnamese food whole world pho but actually take Crepe  But French version  more giant omelet kinda stuffed seafood bean sprouts eat Korean ssam wrap lettuce mint sesame leaves pickled vegetables  thought OK  didn't blow away  inside seemed little bit pasty undercooked   I would come back try pho broken rice dishes  nem nuong legit would encourage everyone try out!  nem nem nem nem nem nem nem nem nem <EOR> We looking some Vietnamese food long but fun Vegas night  Someone suggested place Chinatown  guess haven't area year now but different  many new places eat  Anyways came lunch  big wasn't very full either  ordered few combo plates spring rolls table  place known spring rolls very good  then started reading reviews comparable sister restaurant Brodards OC would say most similar places Brodards but Brodards still better  spring rolls served cut half easier eat  brought individual bowls sauce everyone which nice  But sauce isn't great here  definitely preferred pork over shrimp spring rolls  more flavor  Also think cucumbers spring rolls pickled  But spring rolls nice fried wonton skin give crunchy texture  Mmm  main entrée banh canh tom cua  thick udon noodles seafood fishcake shrimp crabmeat thick red syrupy type broth  never before really liked it  think similar bun rieu  They're really pho place but think majority people that  offer three kinds pho though everything just beef chicken  mostly vermicelli broken rice dishes  Service fine  guy took order really nice memorized whole order even though 10 us  little pricey pho Viet food but  comparing competitive LA prices  sure normal Vegas  <EOR> Stopped try spring rolls everyone raving about   incredible! Even better #14  Rice noodles perfectly seasoned beef crispy veggies! Yum! Definitely back! <EOR>
