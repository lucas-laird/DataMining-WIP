One thing pay VERY close attention cleanliness  owner manager not sure exactly she is constantly walking around organizing tables chairs cleaning tables chairs  love please keep nothing worse having bus own table brush crumbs off seat!  restroom requires key access since location downtown shows care cleanliness department too restroom immaculate fully stocked soap paper towels   can't find any reason rate location anything but 5 stars   believe tried even peaking into kitchen Thanks opening location downtown maintaining consistency come expect other locations! <EOR> Very unimpressed  expected alot more based all hype   All fries came table cold soggy  chicken sandwich cold well chicken VERY bland!  Both Sprite Ketchup amazing though!  hope together   DTLV needs some decent places eat  Good luck   Service acceptable  <EOR> So new Yelp thing but decided time write some long overdue reviews some favorite places since use Yelp all time find tasty foods nearby far away lands!  I've eaten Rachel's Kitchen several times since opened few months ago   generally stop when downtown business meeting meet City County   Usually just pop quick smoothie since they're good but twice now found myself around lunch hour   place decent lunch crowd seems steady flow people ordering take out   even noticed little delivery bikes front! Very cool   unique Vegas sure!  Anyhow both lunches gotten sandwiches once 440 once curry chicken salad both excellent 440 being new favorite find myself craving   sweet potato fries side both times   em crispy just ever lightly salt them looks coarse sea salt something that   Maybe only pays attention things that??  Everything ordered seemed very fresh made good ingredients   Maybe some other reviewers caught them off day when just getting momentum but stopping 10 times very consistent me   On next trip hope give mac n cheese try   I saw someone eating looked great!  sucker good mac n cheese! <EOR> Such delicious fresh food! downtown location prime place some healthy food  most know downtown known bar hopping famous heart attack grill  if you're looking some healthy refreshing food Rachel's Kitchen place all greasy dining!
