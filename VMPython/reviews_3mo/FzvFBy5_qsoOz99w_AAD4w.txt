The pho menu very simple only lists beef chicken pork pho your choices but happy customize order shrimp pho extra veggies   broth smooth unlike many restaurants town which overly greasy broth    They several Thai dishes menu which looking forward trying   Did mention BEST FRIED RICE TOWN!?   The restaurant clean staff super friendly   back sure  <EOR> Wtpho? Why more pho options? Pho thai restaurant but only 3 different types pho menu beef pork chicken  bit more variety would nice ¯\_ ? _ ¯    I red curry pork  came plate rice  bad  enjoyed it  Good mix veggies meat  sister beef pho  tried some wasn't impressed  broth sorta bland  Pho noodles cooked perfectly though    Service awesome  staff attentive nice  came around lunch time only ones little awkward  put movie tv right above table stood front kitchen watched movie while eating  felt little uncomfortable because felt watching whole time   I'd probably come back but only because place literally across street house  <EOR> They only 3 pho options some Thai dishes   yellow curry chicken which okay   guy beef pho  broth very hot broth mediocre   may white girl but better pho broth this   curry okay but next time craving curry happens drive few miles down road pin kow archies  Service good tho  <EOR> Ugh     really really wanted place work out   They just opened few weeks ago literally around corner house   kept driving eagerly awaiting opening day Pho joints SW side really dropped ball    finally try Veggie Pho today let's just say experienced better some chains considered really bad   The food itself lot promise   broth wasn't greasy salty most   weren't many veggies provided VEGGIE pho ones provided weren't very clean   All all flavor decent    just problem   rather BIG problem   found three hairs Pho   blonde hairs black   Clearly mine   sucks   Hair instant meal ruiner   Once discovered meal over    O V E R   OVERRR!  Sucks   I also ordered iced Thai Tea which delicious fried banana ice cream which pretty much impossible mess up  Panang Curry delicious well   Great flavor   just those damn hairs   shakes just thinking them   What need great Pho joint?  tried places all over valley there's always something ends going horribly wrong   really excited new place open figured would new fresh product would probably cook some excitement   least first six months   WTPho may please suggest hair nets least pulling hair back requirement?  All would wonderful if those three hairs didn't show up   Now sit hungry grossed out    Also when customer orders meatless Pho option suggest providing more veggies?  I'm hoping kinks worked out   Keeping hair food cooking 101   Once over hairs might give WTPho more try updated review   <EOR> I just noticed place way home other night came lunch today  actually plenty choices Pho  Many types beef types pork types chicken  No veggie though rare steak son flank steak  Both very good    am used little more lemon grass flavor which would put broth tops book  Still very tasty  am looking forward coming back trying curry dishes  Also Pho bowls good size    although still feel bit hungry sure if just today if could put bit more noodles  <EOR> I'm sure others complaining about  wife live nearby support small local businesses  short beyond impressed only food but also exemplary service  understand why limited variety pho the three good besides other items incredible   love curry    curry unbelievable drunken noodles addictive  new favorite Vietnamese joint!!! <EOR> Love it! drunken noodles curry dishes best had  absolutely going back more! <EOR> We back tried new special beef salad  Omg good!! tangy spicy!   They papaya salad special menu well which we'll back for   <EOR> Atmosphere 3 5** Service 5 5 Food 4 5  First things first atmosphere alright  bit bland just comes off sorta don't know hospital cafeteria  bit weird but  would describe it   Service excellent server extremely attentive  Although only guest guess could take rating grain salt   Food wise surprisingly good  curry wonton awesome  wonton itself alright but panang curry dipping sauce comes DIE FOR  seriously downed three servings good  pho's broth surprised me  flavorfful although bit flat side terms seasoning good enough compliment extremely spicy sauce rack  portioning meat noodles beyond would expect pho restaurant all all outstanding   Check place nice new startup  Needs refresher course marketing could next big thing Mountain's Edge area Edit **Improved atmosphere  4 5   The broth good ever  Pricing portioning could some tweaking  give more current price charge less current portioning    Im naive assume because location really nice pay lot but dang hard justify spending much money bowl good pho Las Vegas where good pho dime dozen    PS fellow spicy fanatics chili garlic paste REALLY SPICY  Enjoy it! <EOR> Even though asian love all asian dishes big fan pho some reason till Pork Pho! love Confit pork tender packed flavor  Porches egg soup another hit me   Service great too  Can't wait back! <EOR> I'm extremely knowledge constitutes great pho but love place food  Great portion sizes great meat cuts  name pretty funny  But check think you'll love food prices reasonable well  <EOR> This new restaurant area thought would try out  food great  portions big couldn't finish meal which very unusual me  service very fast friendly drink never empty  food quality great red curry chicken which recommend  atmosphere little bland give 4 5 stars  definitely bringing family recommending place friends   Great place eat! <EOR> This review being written two food items tried  am pho'ckin pho aficionado  great pho every city ever visited whole lotta pho  drawn establishment because clever name  Once entering you'll notice everything very clean very open  tables line mostly borders restaurant few small tables center  kind reminded fast food chinese restaurant  became wary right away  immediately noticed favorite appetizer menu  No egg rolls  Yeah   those delicious vietnamese egg rolls wrap lettuce dip sweet fish sauce? None  no spring rolls either  continue browse menu notice more vietnamese thai restaurant  ordered wontons curry appetizer thinking would some type fusion food  also ordered Vietnamese staple beef pho  boyfriend ordered chicken pho  He's very White American doesn't know any better  don't know why but expected some actual dumpling style wontons but some fried wonton chips tiny dish watery curry  Disappointing  served before boyfriend was  thought because took longer cook chicken  or something maybe smaller stock chicken broth soup since most people order beef pho  guess just took longer cook chicken because he still bowl beef pho just chicken pieces instead slices beef  something noodles just didn't taste right  purchased packages dried rice noodles instead using freshly made rice noodles  just wasn't good  didn't think could wrong bowl pho since such basic food like fried rice but can  If ever back would only because literally across street housing community  Perhaps Thai food better  <EOR> I love place!  food service excellent!  typically chicken basil papaya salad   location convenient mountains edge   highly recommend place! <EOR>
