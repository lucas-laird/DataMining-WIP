MAIN DISHES The Downtown Tony made three veggies sliders mushroom taking place beef patty great order choice cautious veggie food eater  beef sliders dry bun lack sauce  bun seemed just tad stale which made tough bite through  menu states come aioli but almost non existent which made dry slider  ordered side house ketchup dipping seemed remedy dryness  mushroom inside cooked perfect veggies fresh  fresh bun extra sauce bomb beefless burger    The Ravioli plate needed some T L C  raviolis themselves cooked well great flavor but sauce almost flavorless  added little extra salt pepper which huge because almost never add salt anything  little seasoning plate made sauce ten times better  plate worth try but salt pepper side    My carrot vodka cocktail super refreshing but could used just bit more punch  em' strong  Great option if you're looking something both healthy different  give VegeNation four five broccoli bushels  <EOR> A deliciously sinfully amazing meal today!!!!! tried vegan pizza mushroom also picante pinapple  holy awesomeness good! !!! crust light buttery!!!
