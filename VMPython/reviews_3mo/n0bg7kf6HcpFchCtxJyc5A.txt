Came double date Valentine's Day  understand busy night but when where okay wait 40 minutes between appetizers main course? also 20 minute wait ALL 4 cups water refilled? really can't even tell waiter actually was  Mind informed maitre d pressed time brother law work  Well just leave work main course still isn't here   So thank staff Mr  Chow Las Vegas ruining Valentine's dinner  way spend night your husband he's away 2 weeks working   Spend your money elsewhere    or least wait until act together  <EOR> I'm big fan Mr Chow loyal customer since early 2000's  However 2nd time new location Caesars Palace worst experience then 1st time  expectations $$$$ restaurant wasn't even close being met  Took 20 minutes glass water main course didn't come til 50 minutes ordered  Needless say service beyond terrible  ahead give location more try if let down again no choice but visit favorite location Beverly Hills    This all happened Valentine's Night  leave girlfriend brother wife because work  gave them 90 mins couldn't even deliver  SMH  Being Vegas local 15 years dining some finest spots 2nd guessing location  whole staff needs change attitude way serve customers location  mention appetizers cold when brought out  STEP YOUR GAME MR CHOW! signed very disappointed customer! <EOR> To start off very easy find   ask 3 different employees whom gave 100% wrong directions   Once found checked in   tad early reservations waiting other guests   took elevator hostess asked if would shown bar wait lounge area across desk   opted lounge area  wasn't pretty   looks VERY thought   seating groups middle dark hallway across party room   honestly think someone ran IKEA grabbed some furniture area   did match other decor just really misplaced   decor itself is   White white sculpture moves ceiling during meal   When would would flash lights room whitish LED blue hue  transition lighting needs work   just someone flicks light switch dark room   just jarring   mean 80 Philips hue system does infinity better job then presentation   being newer restaurant would expected smoother more modern performance     The wait staff all seem sport different version institutional uniforms   Some near jackets some bow tie   But just white hospital orderly   Also some uniforms ill fitting mean super ill fitting if inhaled button would pop off suite jacket   something really did understand Vegas restaurant   When seated waiter came over introduced team people   He gave menu described prix course v  individual ordering   He moved then person taking drink orders came over champagne trolley   None wanted any she moved on   then ask another person team take drink order   She came back sometime asked drinks which all ordered previous team member  When came ordering all wanted something different both AP main   advised could then order pre fix ordering would come better end   He did quite say family style but turned be   course everyone wanted ordered no REAL passing around happened just awkward experience   The aps came ok another round drinks ordered but where all hell   4 3 main came together   then ahead start catch moment   When duck came ordered team person spilled sauce separate container all over husband   mean ALL over   course people ran over but he stick plum soy sauce coating   staff starts clean table up   course really adequate equipment cleaning comes bowl warm water lemon   then place new napkin over area table most sauce the edge front called day   Through rest meal he kept finding more more spots more water sent out   The crazy thing 1  did seat another clean table which plenty 2  Did bring fresh order sauce spilled all over him   Also midst everything took cocktail drinking away   While Ice still sip ice especially when ordering more expensive Vegas cocktails   never asked again if wanted another   Also duck nothing really explained   only eaten did find little tortilla type things used duck   thought plate them some left over disaster     Another factor bothered breaking down temporary table   while meal going giant catering rental type tables just rolling along through place   no idea why would waited until no clients still there   None opted dessert point   just ready go   waiter comes check advised took a round drinks off menu   which 5 drinks ordered took off two glasses wine   cheapest 5 hard drinks ordered     I'll honest when something REALLY bad down would thought Caesars Mr  Chow would deleted bill  ask getting clothes dry cleaned   More now going paid then $20 taken off bill dry cleaning      I guess should comment food   ok   few days ago remember single stand during meal     Save your money skip one   You'd better time dumping $400 into slot machine then eating here   slot machine service better  <EOR> Total disaster  food service amateur best  food terrible  duck greasy mess fiery beef cold fatty  no way worth high price tag  service chaotic menu laminated piece paper extremely hard follow absolutely no effort made explain menu engage any way  decor trying way hard cool staff clearly lacking good management adequate training  Save your time money don't go  <EOR> Usually love eat Mr Chows Beverly Hills LV location few times since they've opened however today Valentines day terrible experience completely discouraged ever wanting visit location ever again   seated immediately expressed ready order because only hr eat   placed order first course came within 10 min then  weren't checked approximately 25min   even asked refills drinks water   Finally 35 min 3 requests initial seating received refill water   still no main course   brother leave girlfriend because taking long food he work  53 minutes appetizers approx 1hr 22 min seating finally server come 2 plates partial order all turned off dinner all together  asked speak manager duty soon met maitred host very rude immediately told wasnt fault bc busy 80%capacity basically said sorry couldn't help any better in very animated condescending way    Finally manager came tried fix situation told just wanted cancel rest food outraged experience just wanted leave   He charged just first course which guess thier way rectifying problem left ruined Valentines day hungry horrible fast mouths Mr Chows   Signed former customer <EOR> We came Valentine's Day expecting amazing but instead worst dinning experience lives  only did wait 2 hours food but food tasted Panda Express! couldn't stomach food returned everything  Some overly salted others tasted chewed dog food  filet mignon over cooked tasted horrible! then waited another hour half bill only could charge food wasn't even touched  PETE manager took food off bill acted if he doing favor  If want Asian food stick Hakkasan where only service great but food actually delicious  <EOR> horrible  place total joke  read yelp reviews prior going thought no way place could compared panda express  now eaten confidently say its actually worse  atmosphere crowd doesn't even justify bad slow service super bland food  trust vegas local eats all time best restaurants las vegas    skip place  <EOR> Stunningly bad!  restaurant failure almost every level   Imagine going your local Chinese shopping center buffet 3 afternoon food sitting several hours   welcome world famous Mr  Chow! Then imagine waiting hour half said food delivered    Finally bill comes almost $500 dollars without alcohol!  Welcome world famous Mr  Chow!  service bad disorganized haughty gives poor service bad name  While waiting   and waiting     and waiting saw least party leave   Would done same!   lots people work run around very busy but apparently none them cook serve      The bright spot bar which expertly run killer drinks we loved Pineapple 1880! would great place hang evening     wish better things say Mr  Chow enjoyed food NYC venue but restaurant symptomatic gone awry many Las Vegas locales celebrity chefs indifferent food terrible service attitude just don't care your business   Perhaps steady stream tourists unnecessary serve good food competent manner but would never back  <EOR> I recently Mr  Chow clients Beverly Hills location   First all space unlike any restaurant Vegas   beautiful circular dining room appears chic space ship opens descends then recedes back amazing see   food vibe exceptional well   dumplings water dragon Mr  Chow noodles die for   also steamed sea bass light but immensely flavorful velvet chicken think best fried rice great vegetables   clients very happy I  <EOR> WOW!  Great food great restaurant great staff great location     So waiter comes table tells following typical restaurant am going pick your menu bring three four courses over evening finish duck then maybe some dessert   turn enjoy your meal drinks just remember pay lot money end Wow!  Very strange awesome all same time   Food service top notch   Mr   Chow am life long fan now back next time am Las Vegas   Prices ran $150 person including drinks lots drinks     There also strange oval three part art piece lowers raises ceiling throughout meal changing lighting colors moves   Great time worth every penny  <EOR> I enjoyed evening dinner Mr  Chow's Caesars Palace   Great drink menu awesome bartenders   Oula bartender excellent customer service guided thru menu   Dine experience  <EOR> Wow  disappointment  really looking forward but experience completely underwhelming   They're trying set themselves fine dining reasonable price point succeed  dishes ordered excellent  Possibly best water dumplings ever had  drunken fish lamb also very good  atmosphere pleasant although background music much talked kinetic sculpture nothing much admire   The problems primarily service side  If used high quality service higher end establishments adjust your expectations downward now  During course meal mentioned dinner partner reminded Cheesecake Factory also Chili's  exactly restaurant going I hope   first having another couple seated directly next despite abundance other available 2 tops  second being asked if everything satisfactory 5 people less minute  communal serving team which just translates into bad timing unecessary interruptions  example hot sauce first course delivered prior ordering anything sat table no purpose least 20 minutes   Other service highlights Lost reservation made wait   Simultaneous clearing serving created soy sauce spill  Luckily did but no thought ask that   Hot tea served demitasse cup wtf? Empty water glasses  Slow clearing the manager actually cleared table because waitstaff left long In short if want some excellent food fair price accustomed poor service those overpriced pretention for its own sake restaurants you'll enjoy Mr  Chow  However if you're used finer aspects enjoy attention detail generally expected fine dining skip one  <EOR> Only ok  Perhaps expectations high  heard others but try myself u agree naysayers  Hate but true  ambience awesome ends there  took friend's drink order 3 times before drink arrived wasn't correct  Plenty staff running around but disorganized  Expensive which fine if better delivery neighborhood Chinese place  not  <EOR> I really liked place  start cons then pros!  Cons Food really nothing special  Honestly pretty standard Chinese food perhaps without tons MSG    The food drinks well desert does NO WAY justify astronomical prices  Also fried rice nothing more sticky white rice  food being pretty standard but cares no really comes food  Its all show     Pros felt though waiters staff more actors performing play rather actual restaurant employees  Everything way spoke way dressed carried themselves contributed aura feeling you're play  LOVED artwork thingy kept coming down morphing  LOVED fact need take elevator restaurant! cool! Some guy also came did some weird show dough? don't know hell he doing but entertaining!   You come SHOW!  Honestly if want good food lots buffet 20 feet away Mr  Chow  FANTASTIC buffet!  So summarize OK food sort total rip off but AWESOME dining experience!   It type place come once never back food simply doesn't justify price  However fun! <EOR> I wavered giving 2 3 stars but trying nice  I 10 person reservation Friday night husband's bday  All foodies very excited try Mr Chow  husband first sat bar some drinks   Bar staff excellent   I forget gentleman's name helped most but he very nice helpful  Drink prices little high but comparable hotel prices but bottle prices very good!! As waited rest party arrive asked host look menu place order     explained did large parties wasn't much food when table could relax  While appreciate wish told when confirmed reservation could sent everyone menu via email  It mess stressed picking dinner 10 2 which shellfish allergies  What ever bring prefix duck menu!!  As sat down gorgeous dining room greeted several staff members but only couple them friendly  fact when explained captain stressful picking menu everyone he replied you'll ok   Really!!!! ok    how rude!!! We made through meal food very good but drink service slow  time dessert husband came fed staff paid $1600 bill another bar hotel  Mr  Chow please find some new staff!!!!
