Seriously isn't 'dough' 'homemade specialty' house? When pizza thin isn't supposed crunchy? Why does taste someone made Home Ec class    C ?   And yes ordered two Indian style dishes American pizza place  But large menu  expecting fresh sushi diner  area way better your money    While waiting food overheard some people wondering why place empty most time  'It's side street!' said  No friends  all above    Why 2 stars instead 1? place looks pretty slick  Would def brew bar  <EOR> I liked atmosphere details restaurant  service good but expected more food lacked proper flavor  <EOR> I really wanted Wild but 3 visits over past month just cannot commit anything other two stars   surface love restaurant's decor   Digging deeper into service food both which matters most something just isn't right here   All three times dined sat bar as often do while service decent pleasant almost seems if winging it   of which would expect given first venture into restaurant bar world   would think service processes would better dialed time open your third establishment   Case point visits placed order entree later told selection sold    deciding upon something else later told initial dish available detriment person ordered prior me   What!?!  While appreciate offer seems odd would accept someones order then take away give someone else   Maybe seemed more important maybe more needy nevertheless awkward position both sides equation   On food menu opinion quite limited   essentially few flatbreads few pasta dishes choose from all which seemingly gluten free   Here's issue population requires gluten free what? 1 5% depending upon which study reference?  feel happening owner s choosing offer enjoy while sacrificing wants larger demographic could dining location    good business model feel need change menu more offerings else shuttering business immanent  just don't see targeted demographic supporting venture long term   last meal pasta dish name escapes me pasta very overcooked  While ingredients seemed high quality flavorful ruined overcooked pasta   If pasta two dishes offer ought able prepare properly   The ambiance way decorated place levels natural wood steel soft indirect lighting   that all fits style   disapprove arguably most uncomfortable bar stools posterior ever on   Logic and business acumen dictates more comfortable guest longer stick around eat drink   well  just cards chairs stools   friend both work long hours came meal few beers cocktails closing shop evening   Well unfortunately plan overruled uncomfortableness encountered   ended eating meals door immediately find more comfortable accommodations unwind at shame both your bottom line   Other musings Low quality bar towels sufficient substitute napkin   First low quality bar towels very lint ridden second coarse third cheapen experience   Invest proper napkins both white black   if need know why close doors now   Bar towels staff clean your patron's lap wipe face hands with   I may give Wild another chance six months but surely won't rushing back anytime soon  <EOR> Decided give shot Sunday night hearing lots buzz  Walked immediately confused because greeted within first 30 seconds more  eventually seated selves  appeared only person serving floor bar  offered drinks   bad never came  waited ten plus minutes two glasses water  Decided leave   plus rastafarian music bit annoying  sure food may never know now  would think two locations New York faster paced place Vegas would understand importance prompt service  Oh well  <EOR> I heard new gluten free restaurant opened downtown check out! Sunday first night back! Upon walking easy see place be  offered seating almost full bar but decided dining area perfect  Quiet very open! ordered two GF gluten free beers seasonal veggie pizza chicken tikka masala  pasta  All above delicious  service bartender supreme she engaged friendly conversation new healthy establishment The prices little high    but GOOD gluten free recipes comfortable friendly atmosphere Wild place go  <EOR> I thought would better but decor best part place   Its clean trendy inside   ordered veggie pizza portion crust perfect but zero flavor   No flavor sauce no flavor anywhere except lemonade   Service friendly but didn't check enough  <EOR> We Bruschetta appetizer which good nicely ripened tomatoes big chunks Buffala mozzarella  Two flatbreads ordered party veggie which really loaded nicely cooked not cremated veggies Chicken Tiki Masala which really creamy sauce  ordered Fig salad side grilled shrimp  Fig salad first incredible value  Half size salad $7 figs prosciutto Gorgonzola cheese yummy balsamic  Seven clams that! Side nicely grilled nicely seasoned shrimp another $4  chick meal home run! Top off great ambiance inside friendly happy service Kaitlyn bar easy 5 stars  thing note place fresh good food  may need add little salt but beats over salted over cooked me  Happy fresh dining! <EOR> Gluten free beer way go!
