<EOR> Breakfast     ordered Graveyard Shift which consists pancakes 2 eggs thick cut applewood smoked bacon potatoes   bacon excellent pancakes above average   For $10 Graveyard Shift certainly no graveyard special didn't see any bargain prices diner   OJ $3 escaped $14+ bill before tip  The decor hurt eyes bet updated within year two  I'd try again but nothing your way for  <EOR> I breakfast Stewart Ogden two mornings row part because lazy but mostly because didn't know $10 discount first round come back!  restaurant located inside new Downtown Grand Hotel   small but character   breakfasts decent reasonably priced hotel breakfast staff friendly   The first day standard eggs bacon toast breakfast all fine   bacon particularly good but toast cold put your own butter know butter cold toast works out   Bummer   second day lemon ricotta waffles oddly also cool temperature wise    sure what's serving food hot    could server issue kitchen but disappointing   Both good flavor waffles came covered blueberries other berries kind half fresh half sort compote   little odd but bad   My husband big breakfast eggs bacon potatoes pancakes first day which he enjoyed ranchero scramble next day which seemed kind small but he said tasted good   He did complain temperature food but he'll eat anything   Overall I'd eat if staying Grand but doubt I'd special trip eat here  <EOR> Came dinner Christmas  service spot based other reviews  waiters spend much time back waiting food when could multi tasking  waiting 15 mins credit card actually leave  Food good understand new spot but seriously don't plan leaving  <EOR> Went dinner say disappointing  service good  food    not much  Ordered meatballs dry  Garlic bread dry  1 2 chicken dry broccoli bitter gone bad  <EOR> Terrible service  Food good although grilled cheese potatoes cold  Frittata good  Grapefruit juice way small $3 price mediocre  Service unbelievably slow  waiter bringing other peoples food taking orders while waited check 20 minutes other staff members simply straightening chairs  Insanely poor prioritization staff should simple fix  busy even full when here  service completely negated food quality  <EOR> I'm even sure describe interior restaurant afar seems colorful cool yet close cheap quality shows  simple lightweight plastic chairs cheap tables under designed back bar cheap vinyl flooring quickly observe where tried cut costs  back bar walking through every space property notice architect must give much thought bars whole seriously lacking presence  breakfast lunch dinner menus all some similar items but vary slightly based expected meals time day  While some offerings sound great based both experience majority reviews online shouldn't expect much   Of few burgers offered lunch menu Ogden Burger fried beefsteak tomato avocado aioli frisee  came looked bit disaster surprised chef allowed bun leave kitchen gaping holes completely dry overly flaky  generic pre made possibly frozen patty no decent flavor ok char cooked close medium rare ordered  fried tomato totally dry great all random unlisted piece bacon showed just middle burger  avocado aioli nowhere seen burger could helped counter some dryness bun tomato   My fries completely generic great all cooked well but no decent flavor originality speak of  also ordered meatball skewers appetizer meat far dense under seasoned great  roasted tomato provolone fondue sauce wasn't good garlic bread wasn't quite bread nearly garlicky enough  meal just failed every aspect  said big supporter all things downtown but when they're such poor quality cost can't stand behind it  $10 those meatball skewers insane charging $15 burger should illegal  If you're drunk 3am Fremont Street might cool atmosphere but even heavily intoxicated couldn't see myself willingly spending kind money restaurant again  <EOR> I haven't even back yet would gone give another shot since someone referring himself Executive Chef Charles Wilson wrote me* saying sorry he my* experience he would invite me* back personal guest he show me* much better job   *    except he didn't write *me * He addressed letter Good Day Erik C  Yeah     another reviewer  He actually gave star while gave two  Since you've addressed ahead sure scores match  You're welcome  <EOR> This place nice surprise  checking Downtown Grand found ourselves hungry saw sign advertising 50% off locals  decided check place out  50% off great meal  full price would've alright meal   The decor cool  Kinda new age 50s upscale diner esque  fairly small too  service alright  Could've friendlier more attentive  menu definitely plenty offerings   We opted pub chips cheese dip start  chips perfectly done dip tasty though crave worthy  then shared New York strip frites spinach entree  steak actually pretty great  Certainly anything you'd steakhouse but quite great diner  frites spinach good too   All all wouldn't special trip here  But if 'hood hungry I'd come again  <EOR> I absolutely loved place! decor eclectic lively atmosphere   service just wonderful  group started some drinks bar  bartender Anthony very attentive gave great recommendations  When more people join party later night accomodated table directly near bar  Anthony even let party know entire casino doing 50% off all food residents through month January   great place would love come back soon  <EOR> I've gone twice now both times really enjoyed experience  restaurant very casual nice stop being downtown all night  sat bar both times Anthony bartender  He very attentive friendly few friends no idea order he suggested some cool drinks them very impressed  food good when ordered first visit fresh baked cookies awesome did food second time but back  <EOR> I place  Especially since half off when present players card local ID  twice first time filet which very very tiny  If full price $31 would upset  second time ordered Steak Frites  Best deal hands down  Both cooked perfection but filet ripoff  Good food even better service  Both times short haired smoking blonde think name Kendra  She awesome!
