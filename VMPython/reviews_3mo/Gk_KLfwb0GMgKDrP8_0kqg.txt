Here's kicker don't even offer 20oz anymore now 16oz Porterhouse    The style place tad confusing looks sports bar but stained glass windows lot brick could maybe pass English pub? server Jason came very personable fast  He took orders promptly even gave some recommendations info menu   Still nothing menu really intrigued except loco moco balls  also ordered deep fried artichoke breakfast pizza    The Loco Moco balls interesting  Hand shaped rice balls spam inside instead hamburger meat then deep fried served side gravy  probably best thing night  saying much  Way much rice hardly any spam inside plus side gravy clearly packet    The Fried artichoke ok but dipping sauce came completely overpowered any artichoke flavor    The Breakfast Pizza    Oh Breakfast Pizza  processed cubed ham bagged cheese sauce all flat bread fried egg  Guys when people scrutinizing every bite every meal now a days would really behoove cut corners real products menu   This place could good but food fell flat Wile E  Coyote even winced  service point view patio great just great enough save experience  <EOR> The two best things place view see picture posted customer service  honey rarely venture Strip especially eat bit happened area decided give try  ambience nice big open windows give great ventilation  actual restaurant really clean well!!  Let's start confusing check offer which more false advertisement  claims offer free 16oz  beer your check but its really free 16oz  beer purchase gigantic steak check in  Lame  expected beer prices standard high    The food pretty basic bar food  opinion appetizers more appealing entrees  ended ordering several different apps  Loco Moco could use more spam didn't really taste it  The Artichoke hearts yummy especially enjoyed lemoney sauce  also tried breakfast flatbread which unfortunately wasn't sun shiny described   flatbread didn't evoke breakfast all  more meat lovers' pizza  <EOR> Decided check People's Republic because saw Yelp's Hot New list  loved it! Fantastic service delicious food!   The server Brandon attentive friendly knowledgeable quick  He gave great recommendations never left wanting    The food delicious  Started pepperoni flat bread which perfectly cooked nice crust  Perfect appetizer light meal  cod tacos fresh cooked just right  just tell fish used tacos top notch  tender flavorful overcooked most restaurants do  also taste husband's classic burger cheese  Yum! burger fan all but tempted devour burger  usually don't order burgers because meat tough flavorless  case People's Republic  Good quality meat great flavor!    I can't wait back try other items menu  eye ribeye but figured ribeye would bit much lunch  No worries back real soon! Good food good service? resist?! <EOR> Shane I know wouldn't spell full name correctly awesome! She personable professional  She willing hangout chat but still worked others just much  approve place great time    It's only open few months little slower but better experience most other bars stopped in  <EOR> Amazing server Tisa just amazing person great service food amazing love it  <EOR> We craving snack cocktail drawn People's  Republic because outdoor seating   little windy but refreshing   ordered appetizers fried calamari which cold soggy measly serving size fried artichoke hearts which good wings 8 order $13 99 just under $2 per wing joint delicious cheesy puffs   drinks average   Ordered Moscow Mule but no mint   Asked water refill which came 15 minutes later  All servers looked busy but didn't feel service $100 spent 4 appetizers  4 drinks  <EOR> Amazing new bar restaurant  open 9 weeks  beer selection great food even better  cod tacos heavenly fries garlic green beans  friends flaming Cheetos cheese  sticks DELISH! service excellent overall just cool vibe  back  <EOR> Food good but service extremely slow  Staff friendly but expect all night before service unless you're outspoken actually ask service  <EOR> In New York  gazillion places strip but place absolutely fantastic  drinks tasty beer selection vast food amazing  Please try Carne Asada Fries Steak garlic mash string beans! <EOR> Very disappointed  10 minutes before opened  waited outside deck  server still approached initiated conversation immediate hopes high  sat down when officially open took 10 minutes greeted  10 MINUTES! nobody here! wait another 10 water  sure if staff having off day no sense customer service  ordered pretzel appetizer  came good time  Unfortunately 4 server didn't bring plates stare pretzel until she came over  pretzel delicious  only reason place gets star  3 received entrees 4th wait another 10 minutes  If want good service suggest coming here  <EOR> Good food  Great beer selection  Friendly staff  Very reasonably priced Las Vegas we visited during Happy Hour   Portions little small side fine but probably less satisfying if you're big eater  <EOR> I am glad other people good experience but did not  started well because greeted host right away directed great seats great view  Another server brought menus said your server over few minutes no problem could wait  few minutes  another host came over said should probably just bar your drinks its going long wait      Seriously? picked stuff moved because only million other places could asked serve ourselves   Good luck place hope served  <EOR> Stopped try place out   Check offer bit weak   Buy $32 steak free soft pretzel?  Pass   Check process bit confusing multiple entrances but confusing where seated   Seemed common issue many watched walk in   Had traditional Moscow Mule which good   offer several varieties adding various flavors those more adventurous   Pulled pork flatbread just ok   much pulled pork lot sweet maybe bit sweet BBQ sauce   Calamari also just ok nothing exceptional  <EOR> This place really nothing special it   almost feel invested more into signage food which blah <EOR>
