The milkshakes good   don't order milkshakes very often but decided because part restaurant name   selection shakes two flavors glass but side side mixed together   neat way serve!  Even wait came happy tried place   best parts restaurant pricing two burgers two shakes bill came $16 change   bad all!  all burger meals coming under $5 feel you're getting your money's worth!  don't think even full meal under $5 fast food joint much less tasty!  Half jokingly made comment if really hungry would order two burger meals price would still par Red Robin $2 drink deals South Point does every often see Steak 'n Shake becoming repeat eat! <EOR> Came opening night course line long  waiting Disneyland line but ride worth wait    I never knew me me me melt common the light   steak patty melts original  torn between pepper jack pattymelt peppercorn pattymelt ordered peppercorn pepper jack cheese  Yes! sourdough bread should crispy golden rich  steak good but wasn't booming thought it'd be  but overall filled last penny definitely satisfied   i ordered turtle shake  wow very good  shake its optimal behavior  regular size pretty good think sharable though even eating generous portion meal  i'd say includes calorie conscious fokls half glass would've sufficed me  needless say did finish shake  most best part dinner    the service good which closes deal  <EOR> Jumping current bandwagon braving crowds   the Husband loves steak love shakes   so headed grand opening week Steak 'n Shake South Point Hotel Casino Vegas   hearing lot talk place strangers asking know when going open? Friday night LONG line seated least over hour   However much shorter quicker line left orders only   Sweet!    The Husband chose Pepperjack Melt Two Steakburgers melted pepperjack cheese lettuce vine ripened tomato grilled onions jalapenos mayo grilled sourdough  First off didn't quite look huge stacking advertised bit more smashed down   point Husband pointed lack jalapenos and spiciness sandwich   Meanwhile realized cut green stuff little plastic cup jalapenos guess add them yourself   also came fries thin style   Nothing write home about     Meanwhile ordered Chili Max Deluxe   When opened container surprisingly smaller envisioned didn't realize came spaghetti!  reminded spaghetti Jollibee's!  Husband also paid 99 cents more extra beef   looking spaghetti realizing no diced onions shredded cheese etc  advertised   Before head back tell them error look over receipt see only charged Chili Max  Apparently did ring Chili Max Deluxe initially   But when added extra beef needed manager's assistance ended deleting order inputting Chili Max instead  ended using little container jalapenos chili give little kick   afraid know dish would looked without extra beef paid for   Of course can't hit Steak 'n Shake without trying infamous shakes Mint Cookies 'n Cream Specialty Shake   yummy good until bottom third noticed no cookies down below   When gets mixed apparently toppings only stay top   Husband tried Strawberry Banana Side Side Milkshake pretty good   lot smoother mine probably because no mixing required   also holiday milkshakes White Chocolate Egg Nog Peppermint Chocolate Chip going right now which totally didn't see until fact!   I also noticed gave spoon spaghetti chili   serious?  No fork no knife just spoon   Last time checked haven't seen anyone try eat spaghetti only spoon   bit inconvenient when you're getting order things missing   And yes hostesses dealing lines super nice   looked plenty people staff saw lot loitering management   definitely back food delivery those dining in  I noticed server waiting rest shake orders moment put order until actually she still waiting  Overall done that   Steak 'n Shake sadly didn't live its expectations   both agreed loved shakes though would come back that   But dinner costing $20 left unfulfilled   They currently selling gift cards promotion  Buy least $20 worth $5 off coupon your next order in January February      Happy hour Weekdays only 2 pm 4 pm 2 am 4 am Half off shakes drinks <EOR> What HECK SnS??? totally let down today!

Yes no  mean could it? still think best items SnS pretty damn good  also items pretty meh I experienced blahness second time ate SnS    On visit ordered A 1 Peppercorn Melt w Fries  heck decided add Steakburger shooters w Chipotle sauce  course shake  Banocolate combination banana chocolate   The melt very good  kind sandwich reminded first mythical time eating SnS  shooter example meh  ordering those again  shake just its flavors little mixed it  novelty half half shake worn off  banana strangely overpowered neighboring chocolate  Next time think straight malt  Speaking which cousin Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Malt  tried it  good  But little disappointed its lack maltiness  way server Luciane attentive very friendly  expected opening day  She perhaps little attentive  She kept asking everything before even tried   If you're die hard SnS fan might want wait couple weeks lines die down  Bottom line still fan glad they're here  <EOR> Never did realize when first sat down Steak n' Shake Dallas Texas 2007 way saw food would changed forever  Since summer afternoon counted seconds would once again savor another fresh buttery Steakburger never would imagined would occur own city Las Vegas seeing closest location somthing over 1000 miles here  best burgers hands down shakes no else come close including side side shakes 2 flavors  fries perfect tiny but delicious  size meat patty isn't biggest but tastiest  combination whole meal burger fries shake just right  combination perfect food along friendliest people restaurant biz die for  thankful midwest classic chose Las Vegas only west coast city serve amazing food in  Today third visit since 16th bet back before long again  really can't wrong Steak n' Shake  Next step let's drive thru location built Vegas!

I tried double cheddar burger found portion size right fast food restaurant where everything somewhat small   fully satisfied just two patties found them way more flavorful imagined blows away pretty much every other fast food burger town   three patties you're most likely going coronary   main reason loving burgers though use real cheddar cheese imitation gunk cheese normally used   really put over top combination meat real cheddar made wish another burger drive home   I'm really happy casino normal drive through fast food local restaurant would eat often   gain all weight lost 2010  <EOR> Steak N Shake favorite places eat when tour South when find coming Vegas absolutely thrilled  decided wait few days til opening crowds died down but when friend arrived 10pm last night place still very busy    My friend Steak Frank fries while ordered mint cookies n cream milkshake  David loved dog said best he'd ever had  minute set down just smell told REAL all beef dog    My shake took while come like said place busy but when arrived didn't disappoint  Perfectly mixed not runny but thick wait drink it     Everything menu reasonably priced 4 bucks HUGE triple burger fries shooters 89 cents apiece spend little LESS would spend eating McDonald's food 100x good  mention during week Happy Hour 2 4pm where shakes half price   My only complaint location isnt 24 hours  Im hoping changed soon because know fact would slammed any hour day now word out   So glad SnS Vegas! <EOR> Ever since first trip Tampa few years ago going crazy try Steak n Shake  those spots seems everywhere but California  want because can't kind desire when saw sign South Point during week's trip Vegas saying opened immediately added top itinerary  fact first Steak n Shake west coast! It's only open week but hostess Tammie said line wrapped entrance restaurant Christmas tree Poker Room  Fortunately line calmed down 1 4 size only waited 15 minutes seats not bad considering interior space rather limited bit small there! Tammie great though she really made sure line moved constantly updating queue  list without half party even being aware she asked friends almost immediately upon falling line but did quickly no noticed! The food isn't amazing but plentiful affordable  Most sandwiches list under $6 all come fries    Some key deals keep mind Happy Hour 2 4 am pm half off shakes way regular sized shake enough two share but if can't finish don't partner shake they'll give to go cup    same soda!

Another great burger   The strawberry classic milkshake thick creamy oh good! Very much classic  Now down try side side shakes where pick two flavors combine glass  Imagine yummy possibilities!  I praise server being wonderful patient  being seated ordered only two burgers front even though knew would consume more  didn't want second order burgers cold while inhaling first ordered second ones later  Then added shake orders  Thirdly having three different versions receipt added burgers go  Really kudos server being flagged often add something change receipt   As testament review wasn't enough??? =] amazing food Steak 'n Shake lines table restaurant run 45 minutes maybe more if weekend  don't call numbers put down your name party size feel line theme park attraction  least end line instead 2 minute coaster ride 30+ minutes deliciously joy! <EOR> If love basics you'll love Steak n' Shake   burger should be   Simple flavorful cheap   you're average Vegas eatery small dining room fast service only thing Vegas line Fridays Saturdays   shakes great super thick small stroke while sucking straw but milky velvety smooth  Fries true shoe string fries almost splinter fries but all good     Make trip SouthPoint back near sports book    where you'll find Steak n' Shake   Cowboy boots optional  <EOR> I haven't eaten particular Steak 'n Shake but others when used live Dallas area  Fine cuisine?

Western BBQ 'N Bacon Steakburger Fries always love type burger  Now take humbly satisfying  mean its meat sets them apart its thin cooked well yet dry all  Edges purposely crisped some sides just adds another positive attribute burger   slightly crunchy onion rings bit sweet tangy bbq sauce cheese all together made instant fan off bite!   Fries Skinny Crunchy did 2 orders fries did demolish both them ease along burgers! fries may skinny crunchy but perfectly cooked where still some evident soft potato meat each fry    My Fiance's order Spicy Chipotle Steakburger Fries saw unwrap literally within minute half most thing vanished!! knew she hungry but dayum!
