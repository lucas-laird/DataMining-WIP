Grill City looks amazing! Most items grilled instead deep fried ranging meat seafood  extensive selection value meals value packs family meals  Prices value meals bit higher normal    I ordered selection value meal menu  BBQ chicken value meal which comes 1 BBQ chicken skewer rice side salad $7 99  personally did BBQ chicken  wasn't fan marination used didn't care much salad  also prefer smaller cut meat when stick  BBQ meat should also cut equally same size eaten easily    Overall shabby place dine quick meal  would come back try other items  can't wait try bibingka  told best sellers sells quickly  <EOR> Went kids last nite ordered seafood platter meat platter  waited line but lo  behold! Those guys back served way head happened line here? when finally orders asked some plates servers cashier don't even know where plates are   The tilapia squid barbecue stick good however grilled chicken cooked yesterday coz hard oh! all food ordered cold 87 degrees F just room temperature! Hello! Watch health district!!!

On food decided Mixed platter which consisted 2 Grilled Tilapia 1 5 Liempo grilled pork belly 3 pieces pork chicken BBQ they chicken priced $22 95 but addition rice soup salad $27 95 which order  Everything really good flavor charring but didn't care much grilled Pork belly prefer mine more meaty less fatty  soup Chicken Tinola flavor ok nothing worth mentioning  dessert Bibingka rice cake $3 99 fresh oven but found boring no flavor pop weird consistency  some other food offering but didn't look appetizing nothing couldn't better version home  Would back? Perhaps  bad just didn't WOW either  <EOR> I'm very disappointed Grill City ordered food first time opened liked food decided order 7 different types dishes them Christmas  orders Ampalaya con carne worth 40 dollars    expecting see least small chunks beef instead dry Ampalaya very small amount ground pork  False advertisement! complained manager she said she understand agreed should change name Ampalaya con carne ginisang Ampalaya cus really she nice while talking but wasn't finished talking yet she hang before could even say good bye  still talking she hang up! false advertisement rudeness    2 stars <EOR> Very slow service fast food place  Inadequate food supply  Bibingka done before 8 30 won't cook anymore  Barbecue grill charred cleaning often barbecue cook properly  Needs better kitchen management  <EOR> I hoping love place coz dad few co workers made buzz new restaurant inside seafood city  husband gave try food just ok  ordered some BBQ pork skewers whole grilled squid white rice  food wasn't hot  should've known since sit lol bbq pork fatty squid supposed stuffed onions tomatoes but its insides instead  service great though  ladies behind counter helpful questions fast getting food out  very friendly seemed having fun work  singing random song when ordering lol <EOR> One word     Disappointed  gave star awesome customer service Alma gave me  But regarding food taste far expected  ordered 5 different types dishes every them tasted aweful  am disappointed  couldnt even give okay love eat very forgivable person  But this  different story  Never again  price okay pricey 2 item combo $7 99'ish  suggest pass place if want real filipino food delicious your toes curl  place just hurl  Save your money! <EOR> Food alright! But servers front keeps chit chatting dont focus  why line gets longer its organize when called customer take order   sometimes randomly dance that?  People hungry smh    need more attentive    smh more say but mostly thats point view place    <EOR> The line Grill City longer any other food court spots  Prior grocery shopping hadn't eaten breakfast yet drawn cheap $3 99 silog combo  But inefficiency servers just mind numbing  seemed ordering system pretty simple  Order want then register pay  But some reason 5 6 servers just running around talking each other nothing getting done  line didn't move good 15 20 minutes  Finally women noticed hadn't yet ordered  around 10 00 am didn't entire menu ready  only few sausages left    Service aside food price pretty amazing  no means fancy anything close but if you've ever down dirty Filipino food it  love garlic rice longsilogs sausages   also two fried eggs all little over $4 tax  portion size pretty large well enough two meals  Great Filipino fast food but particularly fast any means! <EOR>
