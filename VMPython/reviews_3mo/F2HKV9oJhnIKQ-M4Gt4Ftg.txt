Normally stay away boneless because breaded much there's no meat but here!! little disappointed find French fries hot since wings seemed fresh  next time if your going clean your celery least cut off dirty parts before serving costumers  Thank god didn't see dirt until basically done eating would ruined appetite seeing side wings  Over all decent place back try again  <EOR> Walking place looks pretty sweet! food amazing employees friendly  highly recommend place eat! person doesn't really prefer Dr  Pepper place amazing Dr  Pepper  plan coming back!!!

OMG! Try place  won't disappointed  <EOR> Maybe because Vegas flooded subpar chains B dubs Wing Stop but if ask hard find consistently good wings city  when saw VooDoo Wings opening only 10 minutes away hit top bookmark list pretty quick  now couple times mixed feelings     First all location hit miss  If you've area before you've probably seen particular spot through few business changes  most recent Guthrie's didn't last long all  Aside looks fresh coat paint some new wall décor place hasn't changed much  nice see kept drive thru though since there's definitely very few places wings one  biggest gripe much businesses before VooDoo seems having issues keeping place clean  both visits walked into nearly empty restaurant several tables visibly dirty  considering amount staff behind counter each time don't quite happens   As far menu obviously just mainly wings sides  wings offered guess call personal size orders 6 9 12  Then also large orders 24 48 75 100  There's also 10 sauces choose handful sides available  pricing pretty dang reasonable just over $2 even smaller wing orders combo includes both side drink  also VooDoo includes both celery carrots dipping sauce advertised price    So now couple times able try couple different sauces  While most them pretty standard offer couple sort unique flavors  first Voodoo sauce which describe mix Sriracha soy sauce  ended ordering flavor both visits sadly tasted different each time  first time way sweet second mostly just heat even though love Sriracha just wasn't right flavor  also Sweet Heat flavor which bit similar BWW's Asian Zing name suggests good balance both sweet spicy flavors  But biggest problem VooDoo all sauces just put way much them  Every time finish eating there's still pool sauce sitting bottom boat  flavors good sauces but just enough where want feel drinking when eat wings   I've also noticed both visits few wings seem undercooked  Each time least 1 2 wings orders stage where probably safely edible but just tasty edible  meat still kind gooey limp  ended having throw them away because just hard eat  Aside those though rest wings very decent  just ordering mine well done now on  fast food style joint sides pretty solid  no complaints any things tried fried pickles french fries coleslaw    Overall VooDoo definitely welcome addition what's available town  food decent priced right always nice another choice wings  definitely returning some point but aren't doing anything well enough stop search consistently good wings Vegas  <EOR> I place twice both times order incorrect  Nice people though but would order messed especially when wait 20 minutes  <EOR> I greeted immediately when walked door lunch Thursday afternoon  ordered bayou bites rolled mango habanero which cost $1 extra honey mustard dipping sauce  chicken good quality white meat good flavors  mango habanero really negated need any dipping sauce  charge extra buck added flavor seems odd  fries came meal okay could cooked little longer   I wouldn't argue if someone wanted lunch but also don't see making any special effort return  Personally prefer much larger selection boneless wings sauces offered Buffalo Wild Wings  beer which option VooDoo Wing Co  <EOR> We pleased see wing joint open near vicinity home  used home Guthrie's Chicken although husband fan sad see go  reading some reviews decided give place shot  fact place your order ahead time through eat24 website addition having drive thru if you're feeling extra lazy go  complaint menu eat24 website no description wing sauce flavors  choose voodoo flavor but it? any case opted six voodoo wings six hot sweet order garlic parmesan bayou bites boneless   voodoo suppose mix sriracha soy sauce but did much flavor  Hot sweet kind mango habanero BWW much less heat  bayou bites flavor good but super greasy   I think price point right mass produced wings  $4 99 six wings  sides offer pretty limited point consisting fries fried pickles cole slaw  would rate joint well below Buffalo Wild Wings flavor quality but decent option if craving some wings  <EOR> Wings good but nothing spectacular  Restaurant clean good customer service  Also drive through window  <EOR> Crispy spicy crunchy tangy juicy sweet garlicky wings mesmerize you  Forget waiting BWW's 50 cent special  Voodoo wings great portion meat them therefore crispy outside meets juicy moist inside  flavors well something everyone  even offer honey mustard sauce  even drive through 5 stars all way around  Service also very quick very decently priced  servers know menu describe sauces very well managed educated  <EOR> After passing place multiple times bf finally decided try Voodoo wings  extremely hesitant because good wings vegas rare most places don't cook them right 6 piece mild w bbq bf 9 piece lemon pepper hot  PLEASANTLY surprised wings great !!! Fried perfectly sauces really good too  only reason why minus star pricing  thought little expensive side compared other wing places  returning !! <EOR> Wings delicious lemon pepper favorite reasonably priced fast  Fried pickels bomb Only problem kids working kind dont care attitude but older employees good <EOR>
