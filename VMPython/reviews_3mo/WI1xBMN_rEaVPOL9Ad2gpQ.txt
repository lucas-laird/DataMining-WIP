Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak wonderful new addition Mirage hotel   Located where Kokomo's used near front hotel dining room seems tucked away slot machines tourists meandering front   Inside nicely designed 200+ seating area where steaks flame broiled plain view   appetizer list tough decision many great choices choose from   Hamachi beet caviar wonderful combination sea greens refreshing flavorful   grilled peaches jamon iberico pepper arugula salad MUST!  Best grilled peaches ever tasted   octopus bit lackluster   Could really find main focus dish   bit mush flavors did blend well   steaks great   Prime cuts beautiful look extremely flavorful   desert menu hard choice but tried corn fritters which think more corn beignets doughnuts blueberries corn ice cream   Wish could gotten pint corn ice cream take home   Overall place great!  only reason am giving 5 stars because staff bring your plate drop off then leave   No explanation food so keep menu nearby during meal!
