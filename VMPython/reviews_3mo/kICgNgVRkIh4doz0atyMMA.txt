Be prepared quite pricey  The layout restaurant itself also odd  felt being inside bento box! Sets few tables cordoned off high walls felt walking through maze your table  sure did give intimate feel but took away high energy club feel which actually hoping for   The food pretty good give solid three stars  known chef started Michelin star other place would pleasantly surprised good probably given four stars  However hoping food more innovative special  Still everything tasty really happy! sampled 9 items menu plus dessert crispy duck salad appetizer absolute favorite   I enjoyed but wouldn't suggest going back  <EOR> It great meal awesome service   drink sure Hakka   Loved fact escorted back nightclub instead having outside   still prefer Miami location though  <EOR> I Hakkasan friend could check restaurant  decor ambiance fabulous  Definitely unlike any other restaurant seen Vegas  food while relatively small portions quite tasty service excellent  <EOR> 3 68991234 stars   some serious personal issues spending much did Chinese food 2   just imagine Taiwanese mother looking menu freaking over things $18 stir fried noodles no meat nonetheless $28 essentially 8 dumplings albeit very good ones    But alas   happy wife happy life!
