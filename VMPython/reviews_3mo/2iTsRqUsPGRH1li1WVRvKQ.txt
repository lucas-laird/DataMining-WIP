I'd heard Bacon Jam good    but think expecting more because raved about  wonderful beet salad which definitely again Your Father's Twinkies dessert  Kerry Simon known twists sweet American junk food play Twinkies wheel house  really moist mandarin oranges work well  But felt lacking cream would better if plated creme pudding  Since menu new wanted share feedback maitre d' really glad did  fact he agreed encouraged come back  continue perfect menu  Solid experience overall  <EOR> I slightly skeptical awesome place could possibly be seems every time something new opens Downtown gets RAVE reviews then sort falls map   However definitely lives hype!!  sat bar served Andrew extremely knowledgeable friendly!!  Ordered 2 cocktails delicious Chicken Skins Deviled Eggs which both incredible   can't wait back full meal!!   The only thing keeping giving 5 stars hot restaurant   realize open kitchen 110 degrees yesterday but notably uncomfortable  <EOR> I expected Carson Kitchen little busy based buzz but 30 minute wait Sunday night   least wife able drinks hang around outdoor area back   whole thing quite eye opener me   would thought even 5 years ago something would thriving 6th St Carson???  Amazing!

non locals there  sure won't last  food amazing  Particularly empanadas mac cheese  <EOR> Absolutely love place    The decor food servers vibe all match growing trend Downtown's vibrant food culture    Carson Kitchen's menu refreshing worth every penny    I group friends everything ordered far exceeded expected  ordered deviled eggs chicken skins start off with    The eggs soft very airy chicken skins crunchiest ever had    We each ordered different entrees but ordered butter burger which perfect medium rare chicken thighs rabbit ragu black rice risotto    I ordered risotto smooth creamy texture black rice al dente just it  rabbit ragu hearty rabbit wasn't very gamey  butter burger juicy flavourful chicken thighs chimichurri herby light   All all place should everyone's list places eat  Definitely worth it  <EOR> Carson Kitchen welcome addition downtown Las Vegas  Rating = 3 5 First food came lunch due price point fact stomach often smaller brain thinks decided try two most commonly mentioned appetizers instead entrees   ordered bacon jam brie toast crispy chicken skins   The bacon jam brie good   didn't knock socks off but admit something addictive couldn't stop eating either  wish more brie just small puddle middle jam all could see wish jam just bit less sweet more smokey more brie would definitely improve dish   would rate 4 5 except toast dry toasted preference creating crunchy surface didn't absorb any jam  3 5 Price 14 00  The Crispy Chicken Skins decadent fried treat accompanied honey dipping sauce   skins themselves delicately fried coating doesn't overpower taste skin   Dipped honey very good   Dipped bacon jam made them even better taste skin nullified some sweetness jam bacon flavor very well light saltiness skin   4 5  Price 5 00    Price point meal above plus iced tea cost $22 00 lunch honest value simply wasn't there    Even downtown especially location   don't feel received $19 00 food quantity combined quality    bacon jam culprit costing more most sandwiches  felt price chicken skins reasonable  3 stars  Note below info only did change score   The ambiance busy bar  dining area small several community sized tables setup clearly intended foster socializing tablemates bar mates  appears 2 bars seating handful tables   upstairs open roof however won't open lunch until September October when cooler   tables very close together difficult move without bumping chair server scurrying keep crowd   location recently reclaimed hotel Carson 6th right behind post office   zero signage Carson street let know restaurant even open windows tinted can't see until very close   The service bar great bartender very friendly informative   check comes book which signatures notes other patrons written book interesting touch     didn't direct interaction waitstaff but observing them all seemed very attentive tables seemed processing food orders quickly     There few other menu items look good back hopefully able move score bit   bread pudding looked delicious  <EOR> Have two separate occasions  Sat table window first time countertop second time  Great service awesome food both times  Loved tempura green beans butter burger tots  <EOR> Visiting Carson Kitchen must list next trip Vegas   group four arrived little 11am no waiting   We empanadas which disappointment   flavor odd off unappetizing  maybe mushrooms   empanadas half filled gristle fat which eater spit onto plate   debated sending dish back hard when comes 4 bites everyone took one   We bacon jam which good sure extra toast  Then devil eggs which average notable any way except little caviar   Beet salad which fine   tomatoes stacked salad ripe  something might buy cheap grocery store   know quite tomato season but bland hard meat tomato spoiled dish   short rib sliders which superb sweetly root beer sauce and tater tots side    could probably eat every day   would go to item   mushroom flat bread very good   gyros soft tacos over salted   The service wonderful   The scores food 2 4 3 3 2 5 4 3 average little over 3   Very uneven food   rating should 3 5   Somewhere between A Okay  fan    If only sliders bacon jam flat bread might looking 5 star rating   service want push rating 4 but empandas tomatoes want keep three   food win   3 stars  <EOR> Small Loud Busy Mediocre service The Swordfish quite good  Interesting beautifully presented  The rainbow Cauliflower over seasoned much lemon  There no beer tap bottles served without glass  Jerk turkey Burger pretty good served tater tots  Devils eggs interesting  bacon caviar good combination  <EOR> This first time first timers Honolulu holy shit some damn good food   Small home place good people great staff most importantly cooks cook   Tara waitress funny professional    We back <EOR> Great Atmosphere    service great! lady behind bar very friendly! definitely back! date oxtail risotto! <EOR> I haven't really explored Downtown Las Vegas but place seemed rock star current 4 5 Yelp average recent glowing review New York Times critic  Even though don't typically American cuisine haven't actually tried any Kerry Simon's establishments resolved take advantage Michael U 's invitation and pleasant company Clint B  give Carson Kitchen try   The entrance actually Carson 6th  southwest corner former Carson Hotel  Parking readily available currently $1 hr max 2 hrs street   Carson Kitchen itself those places intentionally exposed pipes lumber ceiling wooden tables dark but muted colors simple music Sting Aerosmith loud volume chatter least during lunch  Casual attire seemed norm  liked since nothing atmosphere decor really distracts whatever food or liquor you're partaking in   As case whenever you're attacking menu Michael order enormous  able split things Social Plates section menu easily but did need serving spoon fork couple other items  now blow blow commentary Devil's Eggs $8 surprisingly light take classic  Pancetta stood most couldn't taste caviar much probably could've benefited little salt to fair hard judge when only grab four bite size pieces    Crispy Chicken Skins $6 couldn't stop eating this  Savory chip like crunchy skin more enough smoked apparently honey dip in  could ordered another meal run deep   Bacon Jam $12 almost couldn't stop eating either  sweet but still savory concoction classic complement form melted brie  Michael going ream them extra bread gave without asking without mentioning would any sort extra charge  grand scheme $1 50 isn't bad but wonder other stuff might try pull   Gyro Tacos $10 ground marinated lamb actually little bit higher quality typically gyro shop but otherwise just feels tapas ized take classic gyro tzatziki feta cucumber tomato  worth try if you're lamb and or gyro fan but personally would shy away next time   Rabbit Ragu $12 think actually first time eating rabbit Elmer Fudd does now more sympathy  Tasty meat gamy  Came fairly crunchy fruit crunchy chips crunchy spaghetti squash grated parmesan  little spicy but even wimpy palate tolerated it   Wellington Empanada $10 ground beef tenderloin something Google called duxelles buttery minced mushrooms onions herbs   Great crunchy empanada shell really flavorful filling good complement vinegar sauce some sort plate   Sprouts Spuds Hash $10 probably 3rd 4th item would re order if come back here  Properly cooked potatoes bit crust but soft inside no trace raw potato flavor  Did mind assume baby brussels sprouts   Wild Mushroom Flatbread $10 mushroom good caramelized onions good mozzarella good  cabrales bleu cheese nice creamy quite sharp other bleu varieties  Unfortunately couldn't really taste cabrales whole bite flatbread rely eating separately enjoy it   [DESSERTS]  Not Your Father's Twinkies $8 flavor wise somehow reminds sweet dumpling dessert last week Indian place  does resemble Twinkies all way  mandarin orange coulis brightens dessert   only table liked though   Bourbon Fudge Brownie $8 heavy chocolatey yummy  bourbon isn't pronounced bacon something always welcome dessert  Eat brown butter ice cream fast melt you  kind utter indulgence expect something called Bourbon Fudge Brownie   Glazed Donut Bread Pudding $8 soft bread pudding very restrained sweetness lovely caramel creme anglaise  all desserts but might widest appeal since relatively safe   Overall Carson Kitchen somewhat upscale take American food commensurate increase both quality price  wasn't concerned bill since figured would much ordered but $45 w tip split little surprising  Then again solid value sheer volume menu items experienced  Given usual budget hide rest week absorb hit but worth it  <EOR> Today tried beef Wellington Empanada black bean oxtail risotto gyro tacos Twinkies  them add strip bacon Twinkies worth it! All really tasty great flavors  Service still great friendly  11 a  m  lunch crowd  <EOR> My first visit!

Do ask?  It DELICIOUS  DUH  It comes tater tots  almost bypassed them because did fill vegetables but best tater tots ever had  crispy outside fluffy potato y goodness inside   I BACK  <EOR> This place hard find maybe two other groups lost walking around Carson St trying find place   located downtown parking course sucks!
