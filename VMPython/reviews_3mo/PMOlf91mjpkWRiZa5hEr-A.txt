 little things   I headed door 10 minutes before order due ready   all place right across street   Plenty time   Upon reaching end Aria drive though fears realized when saw couldn't cross street without traveling couple blocks direction down Strip   Obviously crushing news blinding daylight 101 degree heat   20 minutes later I may exaggerating finally reached oasis   I found stairway off side headed second floor location   interior really nice   open spacious bright tons TVs around bar   guess never really eat inside Chili's didn't realize touch screen ordering devices table   order when you're ready while watching game TVs bar   which totally see your table   actually seems pretty cool place hang out   No staffing take area spoke hostesses   seems some kind mix order took bit back forth between hostess guy seemed he might manager   When finally found order register wasn't working process payment back somewhere   no big deal though staff all super friendly apologetic   manager even threw ridiculous amount ranch dressing I problem know because mentioned extra ranch   When finally salad back room beautifully packaged presentation nice   Unfortunately SUPER salty   figure they're still working kinks new location   little salt isn't enough keep away place   glad Chili's made its way new location  <EOR> I always liked Chili's   friends thought would check out    When walked bar looked pretty cool just sat down     It nice chill lots TVs   Sunday looked liked NFL cause most games on    The food good too  Top Shelf Enchiladas   came rice blacks beans which surprisingly good     But think best part place prices weren't bad compared typical strip prices   All meals reasonably priced  only $5 large beer   happy hour special Sundays too   I think great location too   right across Aria   nice patio seating area looks pretty good view strip   All all pretty good experience would recommend people families want great break bank meal  <EOR> I heard place decent bar watch football walked over some friends work today  bar pretty nice  icetop bar seats lot people  Each side bar 11 large tv's sound game on   The food service really good  bartender friendly attentive  ate combo shrimp chicken fajitas  would definitely again  toffee brownie dessert delicious  best part normal food drink prices  Even good happy hour  restaurant also within walking distance most hotels there's much parking   If you're looking good place eat watch game recommend chili's  <EOR> Me boyfriend came last day Vegas   Sunday wasn't crowded all yet service poor slow  Took forever drink  2 people take drink order before even brought us  classic margarita in mug super strong boyfriend beer barely even cold  Food good however when received bill inquired why didn't happy hour prices happy hour all day Sunday waiter said only bar outside never told upon being seated  Really unorganized lacking customer service skills  Hopefully time improve  Until then eating again  <EOR> Poor service  Considering Chilis located strip would expect good service  Wrong  Upon arrival place practically empty still over 15 minute wait seated  server took forever take order took even longer bring out  love chilis but service location bad experience  <EOR> It dinnertime drive Vegas attending play check into Cosmopolitan contemplating driving usual Chilies near outlet mall south strip   saw Chilies room Cosmopolitan little weary reading few negative reviews yelp   But tired hungry   and decided brave 200 yard walk hotel restaurant strip   very happy Chilies   view strip nice restaurant spacious design restaurant made rather quiet they tall faux wall's between adjacent booths staff great food typical great Chilies 2 $20 fajitas drinks great reasonably priced Margareta's    All all great night out   only negative massive meal drinks   we WALK down stairs street level they only escalator ferry into restaurant    now list when staying pricey strip  <EOR> This review gets extra star because server awesome  came Sunday which all day happy hour  $3 75 wells $4 50 house margs $1 off everything else  waitress recommended Palomar presidente Margarita  Margarita very good  Palomar so so pretty weak grapefruit flavors    We ordered 2 20 menu pretty typical food  allergen menu which really nice  Nothing outstanding food but did job   Service awesome waitress really nice warned front kitchen running behind we didn't anywhere but appreciated frankness  She also gave extra plate chips hold over until entrees came    Overall happy experience would definitely back because food strip spendy service drink prices  great <EOR> Why 2 Star rating? Because horrible service   I came dinner 2 boys requested Strip view it wasn't busy all plenty empty tables around   offered patio table which took happily  seated 10min no server greet but since boys busy drawing kids menu took some pictures view didn't mind first  Only until couple came seated table next greeted server immediately started irked  He told them he'd back he some dirty dishes hand  When he came back he took drink orders proceeded back inside until stopped complained even served since 10min ago!  He apologetic then he inside sent another server serve instead!  nerve guy!  So when other server asked drink asked manager  He proceeded but never came back take order   manager himself didn't show until some minutes later I think another 5 10 minutes meantime when 2nd server came asked if ANYONE take order all  He said he under impression wanted talk manager without ordering anything  OMG! He didn't even bother check ask just making own assumption!  When manager came table explanation 2 servers assigned patio area  where confusion started since server thought other already took care table  manager ended taking orders instead   Honestly if because boys wanted eat Chili's past 7 30P would walk find another restaurant nearby!  The food good other Chili's standard but service truly lacking! When food came realized none server even gave utensils napkins ask it  Really supposed eat food fingers I ordered steak salad ??? when asked hot sauce didn't come all until server came again see if needed anything else he realized he forgot hot sauce!  When bill came for those wondered no didn't any discount manager bill tempted omit leaving any tips but civilized part prevented left minimum 15%   Yelpers if experienced such service would leave any tips all server? <EOR> I going write awesome review place but see gf punch review just below mine   Thanks Chili's! Always good time family friends  <EOR>
