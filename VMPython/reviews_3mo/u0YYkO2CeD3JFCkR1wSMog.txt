Probably best had  and perfect size split date   After clearing plates then taking wine order glasses full bottle night seemed moving more smoothly    until entrees   My entree came but food did not   Jason kind enough explain food all cooked fresh order sent soon ready didn't hold anything kitchen   Ok cool that   But knew buitoni think thick linguini meatball cooked 5 10 minutes quicker some seafood clams shrimp etc  seafood party over linguni?  Throughout whole process Jason super attentive needs seemed really try keep things going   while Georgio busy trying cool pouring drinks big convention table coming cheezy Italian style lines say everyone   The manager actually came over apologized first offered another glass wine which both full glass declined  then said well just pick desert we'll take care    seemed nice gesture right thing do   Her food finally came say both LOVED meals   best friggin' meatball ever she awesome seafood dish   food place worth every penny price   Jason continued check making sure things going smooth   while Georgio continued posturing everyone   Ever see person thinks he's special gift everyone no clue he actually really cheesy borderline annoying?  Anyway     We split desert thinking house    tiramisu   Now even fan tiramisu but holy smokes  it AWESOME!!
