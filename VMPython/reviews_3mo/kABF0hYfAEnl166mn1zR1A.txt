If you're waiter cannot understand easy terms when taking orders maybe should waiting    The decor playful clean  liked feel restaurant modern noodle house small Chinese flare    We ended ordering A1 Mongolian Beef Pancake your standard beef pancake see lot Chinese street vendors place plate side pickled veggies soy sauce  think better NYC food truck but worth try if wonder beef pancake taste like    A3 Spicy Pork Wontons dish delicious salty spicy but came together chili oil peanut sauce  peanut sauce gave buttery finish something usually don't but enjoyed dish scallions top also made dish very delicious    Last thing ordered B4 Hot Spicy Noodle pork little disappointed dish considering waiter said most popular dishes ordered  sauce minimal but noodles fulfilling vegetables seemed overcooked again peanuts everywhere overall peanut finish peanuts thing   Overall would give dish 3 Monta Ramen something similar executed better    The service good all attentive refilling waters making sure everything okay  would come back only if needed quench noodle craving wouldn't want drive all way Spring Mountain  Tvice good all attentive refilling waters making sure everything okay  <EOR> I think Eleanor Roosevelt told all Happiness goal   it's product life well lived bowl good noodles  The Noodle man strong 3 stars real weak 4 stars     The fact noodles Noodle Man made house evident every bite!   They may best fresh noodles town but certainly very enjoyable what's more they're offered amazing price!  The server said only Noodle Man around but felt Chipotle style chain hired interior design firm create certain look feel  impressed hear otherwise  wife shared Sliced Pork Mushroom w Knife Sliced Noodle Spicy Pork Wontons Chicken Mushroom Pancake Tomato Egg w Hand pulled Noodles  enjoyed everything! First came Chicken Mushroom Pancake moist full juicy dripping flavor   everyone enjoys moist juicy dripping flavor meat pies  rest order came right away added generous portion food reasonable price   Lately getting Tomato Egg w Knife Noodles to go  Then doctor bit home addition some black garlic   just suggestion if you're inclined   The food very strong 3 stars but most dishes coming under $10 can't value   and coming guy would typically drive across town pay more better version similar dishes   Noodle Man small dining area going wait lately come off peak times check call order to go  <EOR> The noodles absolutely amazing  ordered beef brisket tomato soup really enjoyed it  Tastes some pickled vegetables which really great    Along food service great  seated right away drinks very quickly  surprised most fast food came  If longer 5 minutes would surprised   would definitely recommend place  <EOR> Yay another asian noodle restaurant outside Chinatown!

Next ordered two soups  ordered Beef Brisket w Tomato Noodle he ordered Hot Spicy Noodle  came rather quickly  Mine good but lacking something sure exactly  noodles good  just didn't taste finished  think maybe some more spices would better  am sure however know use spices flavor because he hot spicy noodle spicy eat  Now don't wrong both spicy food  just soup mess spice floating noodles  Incidentally splash those spices while eating noodles took eye evening  Oops! But he said bathroom very clean    As result he order some pork dumplings satisfy need nourishment  come prepared two different ways boiled fried  He ordered fried good   Here kicker most restaurants provide unlimited refills iced tea  Most Chinese restaurants well  even unlimited hot tea all them  Unfortunately case here  When ordered iced tea asked if wanted green tea say honey lemon because the green tea no sugar plain  thought well    honey lemon sounds refreshing took tip  He ordered mango flavored iced tea  teas poured back brought iced to go cups  much ice could take maybe four sips before reaching empty  But no problem    just ask more right?  Our bill iced tea two people $17 50  Yup didn't even buzz  Other rest bill another $27 00   right all food only $27 00    I truly believe part service includes being knowledgeable menu advising your guests those menu specifics  don't think would taken much server ask if wanted ORDER another drink  key language could respectfully signaled fact drinks offered refills  If all else fails three maybe someone should bluntly said fyi    those iced teas $3 50 each! <EOR> Love noodles! Ordered everything everyone recommend loved knife noodles  <EOR> I excited over fresh hand pulled noodles more ecited its closer home  Noodle Man does same darn good noodles  Chewy perfection inexpensive don't skimp food  service wonderful very attentive nice ladies check all time which strange because dont same chinatown  didnt know this  Lol    We love spicy pork wontons magnolia pancakes favorite soup beef noodle soup hubby loves szechuan chicken hand cut noodles kiddos love zia jang noodles pork belly mushrooms    We also fried wontons spicy szechuan beef soup which good chicken mushroom noodle soup super bland  think only item didn't like  But understand float authentic cuisine some maybe just spicy some may just bland  But majority items menu flavorful   But definetely come noodles even though option rice crazy if opt noodles  Hence name Noodle Man  Side note when ordering iced teas $3 50 each without refill  Just case miss napkin holder each table reads flavors cost  <EOR> Really Surprised   son daughter took family real unique Chinese treat  Last night  <EOR> I really hate leaving bad reviews  prefer leave review if bad but way nonchalant having bad service just appalled me   We came party 5 ordered bunch dishes everyone some appetizers  appetizers consisted spicy wontons beef pancake fried dumplings  seemed forever all main dishes started come first which didn't really mind because all starving  When received rude looks because asked them fork more once already knew wasn't going good experience  When half done meal appetizers came  First pancakes then spicy wontons  fried dumplings never came  when almost done meal asked server dumplings said if ready would cancel them  watched back tell lady cooking some dumplings  server walking back see lady throw  some dumplings into pan  server returns says 2 minutes  which replied done meal already just started cooking dumplings  want cancel them  She actually nerve tell take go  serious? forget order instead canceling try cook them force us  adamant canceling few dirty looks staff she assured canceled   We check boxes  paid bill getting ready leave but since hot day decided order few teas go  ordered two honey black teas honey green tea go  Now mind drinks ordered meal came within couple minutes ordering expected pretty quick  waiting ten minutes seems head server manager walked by  stopped asked teas  He back came back said she's making it  It'll take two minutes  she? Whoever she isn't doing anything because teas literally take minute pour over ice pump honey whatever do  another 10 minutes total 20 minutes waiting some iced tea said forget which manager just nodded head if he knew whole time weren't going tea   just horrible  No apologies  even recognition terrible service wait time was  Just nod   Now know side town many options new hand pulled homemade noodles thing kind cool people  And single noodle made fresh hand pulled while because there's window watch didn't see anything whole time  way better places just 10 minute drive away Chinatown  Places care your time care if enjoyed your meal not  don't know if think don't need care because busy but don't think supposed handmade mushy noodles worth insult  <EOR> My family such inadequate experience here  disappointing  summary items served differ menu    The service terrible  Waiting big part experience here  waited way long menus drinks utensils food boxes check etc  need chat servers Monta see done  restaurant 50% capacity if that    I particularly annoyed drink menu being handwritten napkin holder   just silly    We ordered quite few things Mongolian Beef Pancake Chicken Mushroom Pancake Spicy Pork Wontons Szechwan Style Cold Noodle Beef Brisket Tomato Noodle Soup Pork Wonton Soup Szechwan Chicken  I don't think anyone impressed  Though did enjoy father's Szechwan Style Cold Noodle  actually spicy  strayed menu description however included peanuts  would ask without if ever return   But reason poor rating dish Szechwan Chicken nothing description photograph displayed monitor shredded chicken carrot bell peppers black fungus bamboo shoots   dish contained chicken eggplant bell peppers  spicy either   So ask server if Szechwan Chicken she hurriedly replies Yes  eating little more still being confused ask another  other server rudely says Yeah well changed menu  those ingredients now  can't change ingredients without notifying customers  if someone allergic eggplant? least little sympathetic dish totally something unexpected offer another choice  <EOR> Such disappointing Chinese food  Ordered lanzhou beef spicy noodles chicken chow mein chicken mushroom noodle soup cold noodle fried dumplings go  Lanzhou beef noodles 3 pieces beef inside rest just chilli oil noodles  Chicken mushroom noodle soup blend could hardly taste thing  Chicken chow mein worst all heavily sauced seafood sauce fake tasting chicken tasted fake Chinese food kind Panda Express but worse  Cold noodle alright fried dumpling very average  returning restaurant  <EOR> The food absolutely fresh incredible  However service leaves something desired  understand restaurant extremely limited seating capacity but paying customers please give least few minutes gather things before staring if imposing them leaving quickly enough   please stop asking every minute if ready order  Give few minutes figure promise but impossible order when ask if we're ready stare whole time   Also 3 50 16 ounce tea no refills seems steep but noodle dishes only 8 dollars guess price points balance out  Overall great food if don't mind little awkward staring rushing door  advice? Takeout  <EOR> I don't know why place getting bad reviews  all quality food restaurant did disappoint!  ordered variety dishes where pleasantly satisfied   back sooner later  Great find! <EOR> It's pretty small place but interior point food  menu rather small well but everything seriously delicious  ordered beef mushroom bowl over noodles amazing  love mushrooms pleasantly surprised when rat's eat mushrooms turned bowl alongside various other fungi  don't normally see rat's ears unless shabu shabu place  beef slices also very rich flavor totally melty! Boba tea also served pretty okay <EOR> OK don't place really it   menu simple but flavors food complex   love sitting bar overlooking kitchen   getting show lunch   would recommend coming early place does seat many   Also coming only 2 people sit bar which usually seats rather table     Service little slow but food worth it   Enjoy slurp well  <EOR> Okay cannot talk food service  know why? Because never served  fair guy but saw things happen could tolerate  First gave menu  ready first minute menus  However never came us  could flagged them down but know busy we'll wait    10 minutes waiting irritated me  couple sat table next second sit down waitress them take order immediately  even joking really mean second sat down  serious? waiting order taken weren't even asked drinks   5 minutes table next ordered food already came out   when just left  horrible service really kills vibe experience  left however waitresses chased down offered eat free  However waited long just didn't want try noodles  attempt gives +1 star but no more  don't think even come back try noodles  <EOR> I really optimistic coming eat first time  party ordered variety things A1 Mongolian Pancake A3 Vegetable pancake     A5 Spicy Pork Wonton A7 Chong Qing Style Sour Spicy Noodles B2 Beef Brisket w Tomato Noodle Soup C3 Homemade Zha Jiang Noodle       The food decent    A7 definitely least favorite    B2 good     But    The service weird    feel servers displayed favoritism Chinese patrons White American patrons  service received made enjoy experience  Utensils available table I don't understand why seemed angry asked utensils eat noodles  ask chopsticks then ask spoons    All other dishes almost finished before finally received A5 A7   The spicy pork wonton A5 definitely anticipated dish taste like  decent but red watery sauce made feel getting hypertension ate it   I thought pancakes A1 A3 okay  party preferred vegetable over Mongolian  Mongolian overly oil watery    didn't much flavor opinion   A7 just straight tasted weird    looked lot better tasted  Would recommend all  No liked it   I didn't try C3 but party finished dish    Assuming good??  The noodles very long length good but someone party said since advertise fresh noodle place taste wasn't distinct  some amazingly fresh noodles very refreshing taste Beijing   I decor wall art  layout similar Monta few tables bar like area where watch cooking   Overall I'd willing come again  may come off day servers really don't children non Chinese people    definitely try other items since saw lady table next order delicious looking bowl noodles    I would say B2 definitely safe every time  <EOR> You know Soho once week?  Well come every 2 weeks!   My usual order strawberry black ice tea  Pork wontons  Fried dumplings we tend choose beef chicken cuz already pork wontons    This time around and last time BF spicy noodles    Love strawberry black tea because drinking strawberry soda without sweet factor  always think getting lychee jelly but think it'll sweeten lot    Pork wontons every time  No matter often eat   just tastes gooooood  spicy sesame oil concoction dipping sauce tho where magic happens   I usually take fried dumplings dip into sauce!!!!!!!  Fried dumplings = gyoza Chinese version = ALWAYS GO TO!   Spicy noodle sauce good too  Noodles firm yummy meat  Oddly enough reminds spaghetti lol without marinara      The service always friendly quick  They're always busy but never wait longer few minutes  Always love sitting bar watch noodle man thing pull noodles  he's making pretzels laffy taffy! <EOR> First time great price great service good selection noodles  Portions big enough share kids  back again <EOR> Yummmmers     brought daughter try new little noodle joint absolute winner  Customer service amazing food delish  more ask for!!!!! <EOR> Excited place down street us! Nice new option very tasty! Sat bar see noodles being prepared scratch which neat  Ordered green bean braised pork chow main which delicious lots flavor  Some reviews said salty but am use extra soy sauce noodles just right amount flavor pork very tender   sister ordered beef sliced noodle soup also very good  Meat also soft homemade noodles very good  try spicy wontons based yelp pics just okay more spicy soy saucy which prefer   I'll sure back try more when occasional noodle craving  Only thing wish milk tea those cute mason jar glass put water saw review but said only serve cups  Otherwise cute little new place sure we'll regulars service also great! <EOR> If ur Hispanic isn't place cuz ull ignored they forgot me  rushing waiting food 15 mins its real small joint never again  <EOR> Finally getting around trying place word gotten place good eats  week day between lunch dinner thinking wouldn't busy  wrong every seat filled  man took care very nice  all Yelp research decided B3 Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup A5 Spicy Pork Wonton  Both very good  expected bit more flavor pork wontons but most flavor came outside  wish more beef pieces soup  noodles fantastic though  added bit chili oil wontons beef broth spectacular little addition! I definitely want eat again try some other menu items  <EOR> This first time dining in  ordered last time  would given them 4 5 stars food  taste pretty authentic very decent  portion huge maybe even little much noodles  However service bit disappointing no refill $3 50 20 oz  cup jasmine iced tea? Wow! understand beverage where most restaurants money but if they're going charge much iced tea where most Asian restaurant would only charge 50 cent free should least refill allowed  server decent but feel bad table next us  rushed placed order when started asking questions waitress frustrated them  She even complaining another server Mandarin   absolutely unacceptable unprofessional sure she's aware there're other patrons myself dining understood Chinese perfectly  made first time dining pretty unpleasant  may just stick ordering to go if decided give place another shot  <EOR> I several times since opened let down! service great which don't expect Asian restaurant  food just good because noodles freshly made front including dumplings  tried all appetizers even some off menu offered us  Also 7 different noodle rice dishes always better other  past couple times decided try boba drinks amazed soft boba flavor honey lemon green tea drink refreshing! love places outside Chinatown close home! <EOR> Not bad    Great concept  Food okay  Mongolian pancakes which tasty but very oily  noodle dish but beef very fatty  pork dumplings over cooked some meat slipped dumplings n just placed top so great presentation   Price pretty cheap  only spent $30  Place clean n nicely decorated  <EOR> Solid neighborhood joint    Ambiance 3 5 clean inviting  better average place Chinese grub   Service 2 5 confusing times bit slow times   Food 3 5 now tried everything first page  Every dish solid but bit sweet side  think little more catered American palate which understandable considering Chinatown but still little annoying    Drinks 1 5 All boba teas syrups can't control sugar strength  choose cloyingly sweet watered down flavorless   Overall good neighborhood go to  Prices very reasonable big burden come check = <EOR>
