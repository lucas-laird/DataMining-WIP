As only first day full opening few understandable glitches  speciality sodas aren't due until tomorrow couldn't sample those  Also brownies featured fascinating sounding deserts also available time  also minor issue where order didn't print quite right onion rings delayed despite all staff handled everything perfection  No fewer three managerial types came past asked experience waiter apologised profusely glitches suggested alternatives unavailable menu items  couple days when ironed everything see level service really turning trip into meal remember   Bottles Burgers really great addition pretty but otherwise pretty spartan Tivoli Village  some high end burgers fraction price you'd pay some less impressive Strip locations menu offers enough variety customisation features keep any burger fan coming back more  <EOR> I friend food excellent built own burger prepared perfect truffle aioli which came fries spot friend pluck chicken burger which best he ever gravy fries reminded home town     The waiter little slow  help soft drink glass small busboys good job  keeping drinks better waiter did   I would recommend place love burgers favorite food Burger Bar KGB BLT Holsteins LBS Love Burgers would rate right there  <EOR> Went place lunch just today left feelin burned spent almost 50bucks nothing ever thought trying burgers fancy making them tiny puting them stupid fancy squire plates charging stupid amount money them mind! mean charges 7$ shake???  runny more sweet runny milk then nice creamy thick shake meat burger cooked well but meat bland tasteless wife sliders witch same wen plate came table FINALLY wheres beef!! more rest burger paying for? frys separately? frys wer nice concept nice thick cut ridged but way over cooked    am chef myself believe anyone  looking better tasting better value money burger better just burger king!

Food very much enjoyed veggie burger order Baltimore Fries read fries smothered brown gravy    husband however did enjoy bacon bleu burger   He ordered medium rare came well done   No pink all   bacon burnt crispy burger   could tell bacon just sitting back kitchen   burgers $9 came small serving potato chips which thought fair price   fries however $5 such small serving!  Disappointing   Also disappointing drinks   ordered take Old Fashioned which didn't resemble Old Fashioned all   really basically just bourbon ginger   $10!!  Man down Strip better drink price   burger place!  shopping mall!  $10 drink?  Oh sliders $8 TWO them   kidding me?  place flat expensive   Setting If sit bar booths very careful because bottom booths extremely raw sharp!  wearing skinny jeans flat ankles exposed   point ankle grazed bottom booth hurt!  thought Geez need sand down edges something  When home realized ankle still stinging   looked down dried blood ankle!!  booth freaking cut me!!  Valet When walk restaurant located right next valet parking lot   husband crossing street valet driver came screaming lot bat hell literally drove straight toward slamming brakes stopping just inches me   am exaggerating   looked cursed him   He didn't respond just slammed gas soon stepped way then he cut off another car   horribe valet driver!  No remorse almost hitting cutting off another vehicle   Lackluster food drink near death experience left bad taste mouth   sure if I'd back  <EOR> Disappointed  Portions small prices high  started pomegranate gimlet which very good taste don't flavored liqueur gin pom juice lime juice but basically paid $10 juice same second cocktail   lightweight tell when alcohol no alcohol drinks  meal pluck university stuffed which ground chicken stuffed mozzarella red chili chutney slaw taro bun  Sounds good paper right? fell apart immediately eat knife fork chutney strong burger   sweet potato fries burnt edible  entire table different order fries could all try them gravy fries probably best    Our server needed some extra training table 7 girls he acted very scared approach he would drop stuff run if he nervous ask if needed anything else  sure if he new but needs some people skills  overall con census table place isn't worth it  If want burger stick bachi burger burger bar  <EOR> Gourmet burgers sides designed pair well wine   WIN!

service completely disorganized orders came wrong over over  offered scotch wine 11 30am while dressed suit tie  know Vegas but really? menu reads great but actual product underwhelming  Burgers petite nearly flavorless bare almost no resemblance those described menu  Southern Fries sweet potato actually pretty good  highly touted milkshakes over priced just so  Bottomline n instead if your must overpay burger Lbs RedRock Burger Bar Mandalay Bay  <EOR> Horrible dining experience  First off decor all over place painter color blind  Second food read some bad good reviews kinda skeptical  agree bad reviews first off burger over cooked  Then doesn't help when no flavor  ordered bootlegger expected whiskey onions great but only couple chopped onions some runny gravy  fries good but tell frozen  Boyfriend salmon salad must say looked only couple uncles  When he asked server she said  come disappointing extremely overcooked   last thing manager hair piece needs money back  <EOR>
