Went Sunday night expecting long line   able two seats together bar right away served drinks almost immediately   took advantage current $12 95 special ordered Bucatini Chicken Toscano   risotto came chicken horribly undercooked   would Gordon Ramsay say?  told bartender server staff asked them let kitchen know   assuming risotto cooked batches precooked rice whole batch would crunchy    male bar porter came offered choice Alfredo marinara dipping sauce bread already front us   said marinara please  The short story?  check came nothing taken off undercooked risotto never ate sent back   offer marinara sauce cost $4 00 which bar porter neglected mention   think restaurant going through start problems   think we'll wait awhile before going back  <EOR> For them jus opening expect them busy  didn't wait long  But thing disappointed cut back plate size  figured probably doing cause maybe limited supply  wanted sure able feed everybody  don't know but kinda disappointed me  Cause 2 several locations first  Overall food still great but just hope back regular portion sizes  getting bowl Gnocci soup no chicken dumplings lol Really! <EOR> My boyfriend great time today location  greeted multiple empoyees server Sunday very fun jovial upbeat  Two different managers introduced themselves table  amazing quick thoroughly cleaned tables when people finshed  staff really top game    I worried would wait since brand new  showed 4 45pm seated immediately  When left hour later few parties waiting  doubt if wait long  because  hostesses seating people constantly    I look forward visiting Olive Garden regularly  also excited added some lighter fare options 575 calories less menu offer veggies whole wheat pasta upon request  <EOR> It did surprise wait new location but probably 8 employees behind hostess station looking no idea where were  name waiting list 40 minutes could find place sit thought may room sit ladies room  way bathroom wade through 50 servers milling aisles  big location but no way need staff 200 inexperienced servers stand around looking confused groups two   We did wait less predicted time but think due fact people line before no where found when names called  seated decent table but building loud overcrowded couldn't hear each other talking  meal awkward enough but also being interrupted constantly servers delivering items table meant other tables   Our server nice tried best but think general trained servers sell serve wine samples but practical things table numbers order timing  When saw new menu made more sense since obviously all money money money  prices gone up! suppose need more money help them pay cost new building maintaining army untrained servers run around being useless blocking fire exits all time   Our entrees served before chance eat salad appetizer came 10 minutes that  guess going reverse dining experience  food came fast inappropriately timed felt being rushed out  Combined loud atmosphere numerous people stopping table felt eating parody good  restaurant   The food itself while served way quickly also very good  am fan Olive Garden am sure if changed menu just being executed poorly  salad gross rubbery fettuccini bland boyfriend's ziti salty he draining Lake Mead all water refills    The appetizer okay but honestly eat pretty much anything long deep fry it  Additionally hard enjoy appetizer when comes you've already started your actual meal  much food table start realize much pigging right now  Nobody wants reminded call Jenny Craig result meal  server did apologize but no offered take appetizer off bill    even take back  Just shut eat your pile food fatty   Even though people everywhere throwing food asking doing beginning meal all disappeared check time  guess yelled lot those sneaky upsells? manager came several minutes but just wanted give them money leave then  Honestly Olive Garden needs call its birth mother some guidance win being real restaurant  Maybe try again year  Until then think stick Red Robin right next door  <EOR> Olive garden just bunch cheese pasta sauce yet charge arm leg it  Another problem appetizers came pretty fast still eating salad entre came out  probably way try save salad bread sticks refills  felt wanted fast  happened enjoying food atmosphere?

I love going Olive Garden   enjoy going celebrate events just because     However surely pass going specific location time being   Perhaps need re evaluate staffing management matter  <EOR> Alright grand opening day Olive Garden location  much review feedback constructive criticism management Upon entering wait name taken given wait time accurate estimate 5 10 minutes  hostesses could more professional more friendly first last impression restaurant should taken into consideration them more smiles eye contact necessary guests appreciate more more patient when staff warm friendly sincere speaking sincere hosts attitude voices forced far meaning say such thank  sorry being host previous assistant manager restaurant myself small details pertinent  Mirror personality your guests create bond interaction  host led seat more friendly personable smiling explaining server would did leave parting comment enjoy  thank    Also casual fine dining atmosphere slang lack professionalism should no where near here  No wants hear ok GUYS you're table done good go  Follow back wayyyy  want if want much more proper say would if would   looking party shouting last name through three sections restaurant BAXTER!

My server Devon  waited 4 minutes greeted bad  She looked rushed frustrated table behind waiting 15 minutes helped until manager came take order  Employees your managers help don't sacrifice patience enjoyment party waiting because hurried ask help greet take order just few minutes could lose tip customer forever  She didn't offer wine even remove glasses table when mentioned only came dessert nor she very savvy menus quite sure if she even looked before because asked question having another dessert menu she searched frantically saying lemme see if its back here  told already checked wasn't  She sort shocked said she would ask bar if one  Came back later took order didn't collect menus until half way through  Once she rushed she smiled made eye contact  Confidence key employees act know doing move grace don't let frantic show your face all fooled in good way   She waited bring check didn't rush appreciate    The Dolcinis two frostbitten completely frozen strawberry tiramisu lemon mousse perfect  Writing review waiting other two defrost enough taste flavor ice    Overall first day bumpy but going well see  All rest come time  Thank management! wish all well your business personal endeavors!
