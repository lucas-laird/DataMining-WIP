Well would place   Almost same concept lots fun games play but add rides mini bowling alley 8 holes glow dark mini golf course all eat buffet  blast   Cons u purchase buffet weather ur eating not   because hard tell paid eat didn't  Second buffet itself nothing jump joy  pizza although 8 different choices  offered simple salad bar some pasta station well dessert station  Can't complain much since adult price 10 95 kids 3 5 4 99  The pros ticket package 125 tickets 25 bucks  literally left over tickets being 3 hrs  Over all would come again  <EOR> So place pretty cool concept looks awesome  Buffet multiple themed dining rooms private party rooms games rides prizes    facility itself nice      BUT     Came party Sunday afternoon CRAZY busy  watch your step you'll probably trip over someone    When first seems able keep food crowd    But time ready leave couple hours later lots ppl waiting around empty food displays   only ice cream dispenser working first time left wasn't working either  Otherwise kinda buffet especially kid party  But decent salad bar lettuce looking clean crisp   Alfredo pizza garlicky!   The play area huge geared mostly grade school kids but there's also few games play area younger ones    noticed several games order which kinda surprising given place relatively new      So think place decent place bring your kids busy day if exists town   may still need work handle crowd     And some tips PARENTS      Teach your kids share! If see line kids waiting play game don't sit playing OVER over    Play once or maybe even twice then back end line!   And      Just because all together group doesn't give 5 right cut front long line waiting KIDS because decided join lady kid actually waiting line in front   yea passive spoke yea didn't let cut   just rude! swear earrings come off hold purse! Haha totally jk    Yeaaah much better experience come midweek something  <EOR> Super busy    staff wasn't ready deal crowds people  second weekend open  food ok plenty  Though ice cream machines looked mashed potatoes ice cream   The kids liked rides most games working when went  <EOR> Good buffet Too many people long lines! Birthday rooms nice  Kids liked enough just way long wait lines everything I'm old crap never return  <EOR> We first time Valentine's Day kids fun  salad bar really good  Didn't cheesecake  pizza good but took long pizza everyone wanted  kept making other pizzas nobody asking for  cinnamon rolls delicious if right away  bread sticks amazing  pasta dry needed cooked longer because still little hard  Didn't try ice cream because ice cream maker broke down  super packed  Very loud  Many different themed rooms sit eat in  All buffet style all eat  small bar adults  <EOR> Great place good addition Las Vegas finally !  The place quite big plenty rooms eat plenty food variety custom pizzas prepared!  The arcade quite big lots newer games available  also few small rides too   Addressing things would 5* review couple more healthy entrees  very Jekyll vs Hyde pizza vs salad  Healthy options don't rabbit food keep those arcade games updated! purchased latest machines but having them old versions no good! Very kiddy orientated  Adults need some fun Anyway sort adjust review! Thanks! <EOR> STOP!!!
