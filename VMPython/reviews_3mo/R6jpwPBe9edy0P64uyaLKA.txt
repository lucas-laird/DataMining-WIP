Burgers I Ahi $17 which nicely seared keep middle rare  bun taro bun sweet buns most Asian bakeries would red bean buns with soft bit sticky sweet  really liked sauce it   it gingery some kick set off tuna well    BF Oregon Trail $17 which Buffalo meat burger fine aged sharp cheese cannot remember which right now garlic aioli  juicy well seasoned solid burger    Service friendly pretty good checking us    This vast improvement BFs last experience  only experience give them positive rating since did good meal  Worth price?  hard say local off strip cheaper options  obviously great employee discount made worth going us  good burger if you're tourist you're hungry don't see why if consistency down but might while   BF does Yelp but some excerpt Facebook discussion upsetting 1 star kind experience just seems many hands cookie jar focus becomes look busy possible opposed really taking care customers   it all seems grand illusion think keep them getting fired when hammer comes down   you would think 8 chefs grill head chef could serve 15 guest reasonable time  instead all making food each other  front plain day burgers   nope those going into back  oh those must them   nope half grill people left sat down eat them milkshake girls    He said he would probably give them 2 5 3 stars now averaging both experiences but we'll wait 3rd time 2nd visit figure if place holds solid place burger strip positive experience fluke  $17 burger should always top notch   UPDATE lunch again pretty decent alright service things improved  menu changed though yam chips now gone  <EOR> So apparently just opened recently over Palazzo  group 6 immediately seated lunch   place wasn't busy  started off milkshakes  liquor any shakes course opted it   perfect way start day right? Milkshakes AMAZING  use Haagan Dazs ice cream coffee milkshake mixed some Kahlua Bailey's pretty awesome    For appetizers decided share sweet potato fries truffle fries fried dill pickles  bad pretty standard  favorite truffle fries  nice kick it  also brought bacon aioli garlic aioli ketchup  garlic aioli pretty tasty well fries   As burgers ended getting Love Bacon burger hearing nice sales pitch waiter  Mmmm gotta say love bacon but little overwhelming  Bacon mixed patty bacon strips top bacon mayo  time half way through burger felt pretty sick burger started tasting super dry all salt  guess good way bacon lovers take nice reprieve bacon binging  buddies enjoyed burgers especially ahi burger taro bun    As service very friendly but super slow  took hour burgers come out  ended asking fries early because needed SOMETHING eat  also mixed order  ordered drink never came well  guess still little hectic   The menu itself pretty simple  waiter mentioned planning adding some new items  Hopefully keep orders!  Would come back? maybe  definitely won't order bacon burger again  Overall thought okay  Prices weren't steep typical Vegas strip  <EOR> Quite possibly favorite burgers Vegas now     already gone 5 times intend many more   why only 4 stars?  Well     service pretty slow times they've fallen flat few items   So    summary experiences       Mac Cheese nom noms Eat caution!  Crisp panko breading outside deep fried then served blistering hot   If you're evil mood warn your friends then laugh heartily while burn tongues oozing cheese!  Ho ho ho nom nom noob!  Mozarella Fries Obviously waitress no idea explain things because expecting something totally different   short?  They're mozarella sticks   long?  They're REALLY GOOD thick mozarella sticks marinara wonderful cheese obviously extremely high quality   Triple Truffle Fries Taste dirt!  But yummy dirt!  would normally called shoestring fry more next tossed truffle oil slivers appear real truffle oil   Don't ask third truffle don't think anyone actually knows   If truffles good choice     Shoestring fries normally passes shoestring fry only sob own gross obesity compared these     huge mound incredibly THIN fries   nothing I'd ever seen before really tasty      Definite recommend   New York Style chips first time them world   Crisp thick cut fresh potato chips   next time them sucked   even thinner but somehow lacked any semblance crispness just soggy cold reminiscent bag Lays  sitting rain   Very disappointed   try them again but careful   ask well done next time     So burgers Caprese Burger two favorites     INCREDIBLE mix flavors freshly ground beef thick fresh slices melted buffalo mozarella thick slices beefsteak tomato     Add basil aioli balsamic reduction     whole range flavours time   Taking queue but definitely mistaken Caprese salad surprisingly refreshing burger still sit your stomach pile bricks when you're done not bad way    lot food well worth price   Ahi burger second favorite burger basically sushi disguise!  Lightly seared keep tuna fresh rare center packs spicy kick wasabi twist   Loaded tomato lettuce sweet taro bun just fantastic   only thing could perfect burger even better would some avocado    add for extra $2 !  bit pricy $17 but despite being just fish just filling regular burger hey     sushi isn't cheap either!  Dante burger Hmm    most disappointing all burgers still wasn't bad   guess lacked fresh produce flavors   came without lettuce tomato just heavy tastes   Caramelized onions big beef patty bleu cheese   Great caveman but want least PRETEND there's something healthy burger!  The food really top notch burgers pricey but worthwhile fries appetizers VERY reasonably priced   Kick service bit best burger place ever! <EOR> Who doesn't good burger?
