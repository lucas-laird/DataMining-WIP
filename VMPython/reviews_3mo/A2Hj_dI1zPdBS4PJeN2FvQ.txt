New favorite place! really good service = <EOR> I've several occasions can't enough rare steak pho!  A+!  soup always comes piping hot flavor perfect balance cilantro y which prefer mild but still very flavorful   also give nice amount just 6 99   pho dine take its consistently good   Their rice plates good too   always pork bbq come's eggroll shrimp skewer soup rice I don't know real names dishes lol    bbq sticks REAL good   shrimp sticks real bad really needs seasoning something!    Its really deal breaker anything since all other food pretty solid   I also love getting fresh coconut juice   gotten 3 times already   Twice coconut hard couldn't enjoy scraping meat off    but once perfect helluva time eating coconut meat   Service pretty OK   sort different every time been   Really great just whatever   check wrong once but quickly fixed   Since joint close definitely continue Vietnamese spot! <EOR> I base pho experience off good broth is  once but congested don't think tasting totally since other reviewers raving broth  Still 3 mins house supposedly putting drive thru  say AWESOME?!  I'll give another shot if turns better update review 5 stars  <EOR> I compare all pho Pho 1 but being all way down spring mountain being southwest its trek gas prices rise  being said definitely return  broth flavorful Pho 1 but good potstickers good hubby #52 good   Nice clean simple restaurant   People friendly nice   only two patrons may why attentive but regardless very nice love supporting local business   Happy eating till next time! <EOR> Finally great Vietnamese restaurant option Southwest    I came evening fella two good friends  arrived place incredibly busy Sunday evening  always bodes well me  seated promptly drink orders taken  ambiance very nice clean  decor modern nice    I wasn't mood pho opted grilled pork eggroll bun  fella ordered same minus eggroll  dining companions started eggroll appetizer tried chicken pho fried noodle dish  food came very quickly all pleasantly surprised enormous portions  flavors great really enjoyed everything bowl  Great flavors large quantity noodles protein eggrolls veggies  Definitely worth prices listed  Everyone incredibly happy meals discussed length happy all meal  drinks never left empty long even though stayed table quite some time They didn't bring most chopsticks but definitely sure ask some next time there    They food take out also process installing drive thru great picking food way home work time time  look forward next visit trying more items off menu  <EOR> Pho SW worthy Spring Mountain   As long time eater Vietnamese food  self proclaimed pho expert  eat it  can't hide bad pho  But good pho speaks itself  would expect some best pho Vegas located next Cheeburger Cheeburger drive thru?  BROTH Pho places serve watered down broth should ashamed themselves  broth vessel brings together all ingredients  noodles meats veggies unite harmony form perfect Vietnamese comfort food  Rainbow broth served piping hot flavor stronger side  balance spices perfect    NOODLES Nothing kills bowl bed mushy noodles  noodles served just perfect amount bite  undercooked over   MEAT Exceptional! Equal slices cuts meats Pho 1  factor many places skimp on  tai served rare think we're gonna know if meat funky you're using odd cuts beef?   VARIETY usual rice noodle dishes  saw couple chinese inspired plates well  app Vietnamese egg rolls  amazing! them big long     your mind gutter If you've ever received plate skinny egg rolls know mean    SERVICE few employees  all eating tables  Although unorthodox its privately owned joint Asian people  never things book  attentive made good suggestions overall pretty nice! Its probably good thing see them actually eat food serve up   Although prices $1 $2 higher would find Spring Mountain lose wallet gain convenience  Rainbow just down street mi casa continue return! Plus unlike Jenni Pho Rainbow quality takes cards  <EOR> I husband   order banh cuon rice roll plater 20 min later waitress came back  told don't ready serve although menu   She recommended order pho instead   thought should try anyway but isnt any flavor all  regret come here   re very unprofessional service suck  come back recommend anyone try it   Horrible!    P S even over charged us! But caught it  <EOR> New undiscovered gem S  Rainbow just pass Smith shopping center right next Cheeburger Cheeburger  place going give J**nni Pho street Vietnamese restaurant Spring Mt run money figuratively literally speaking  Awesome food great atmosphere clean friendly service  Especially waitress Annie  Highly recommended  Definitely worthy try sure you'll glad did because you'll back more will    P S  Drive Thru too  <EOR> I am Los Angeles visiting friends Las Vegas brought Vietnamese restaurant  way outside typical Chinatown   Rainbow Pho Express located corner strip center even drive thru   restaurant looks fairly new appropriately decorated staffs quite friendly   However gem hidden bowl Pho   order give good contrast review understand plenty good Pho places LA Rainbow Pho Express landing number favorite Vietnamese restaurant serious matter   Now back actual review ordered Pho Special bowl landed front fragant smell broth must required hours simmering   noodle cooked al dente which won't all soggy soft time finish entire bowl   meat fresh taste beef still lingers  also cup coffee kind coffee ensure awake drive back LA kind caffine dose  friend ordered prawns which served mini clay pot light palates because sauce heavily flavored but course  why bring place rice!     Watch Vegas finally healthier options available drive thru replacing typical 2000 calorie burger !!!   Dear Rainbow Pho Please notify advance if opening LA! <EOR> Bun Thit Nuong Huge bowl cold rice vermicelli bbq pork mixed fresh sliced lettuces really good comparing Vietnamese restaurants Chinatown   really simple Vietnamese dish but made super good              it's because delicious flavored BBQ pork      Overall great experience good starter some good egg rolls other recommended  end fresh coconut jello waitress recommended    I m impressed food service would  definitely back try Pho next time m here!! <EOR> Finally Pho  decent located Chinatown! drive thru knew! Anyways just happened try place whim step into Cheeburger Cheeburger glad tried it  Walked quickly seated slow night    We started off dining experience pot stickers which decent but sauce bland  Then each ordered bowls Pho ordered rare beef brisket WOW bowls huge! broth darker see most places expect packed flavor  certainly did disappoint  Great fusion flavor all ingredients  meat tender actually tasted real meat  others mentioned noodles cooked perfectly mushy  iced Thai tea good but little pricey $3 50 small glass give you   Overall dining experience great  staff quick always checked us  pros compared Jenni Pho take debit cards  if don't want trek Chinatown live SW try place  Another thing separate menu drive thru give options  <EOR> the pho really really really bland  even gave them second chance today  Fail    their service great either    Oh well    BUT! BBQ meats darn good!!!! love love love those dishes!!!! definitely come back those! <EOR> No no no  place all wrong  4 5 stars?! Really?!!  1 star awesome drive thru  1 star awesome service   where stars stop    I hated pho  Wait sorry hate strong word disliked pho  lot  sweet broth just all wrong  Sure give big portion $7 but all over use phrase quality over quantity! rare steak brisket pho brisket fatty  more flank brisket  tried spice broth basil sriracha lime juice anything would alter broth little but just didn't work  Sheer disappointment  bites girlfriend's vermicelli crispy noodles nothing sparked  girlfriend's crispy noodle gravy salty  couldn't even second bite  Why place rated high? Beats me  highly praised nail salon getting nails done earlier day thought Asians know what's up! Nope definitely steered wrong  <EOR>
