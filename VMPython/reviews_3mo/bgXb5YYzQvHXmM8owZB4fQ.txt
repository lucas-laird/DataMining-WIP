ordered toasted vegetable pizza  servers super nice friendly  Id say come dressed nicely  came sweater felt little place <EOR> On cloudy cold windy afternoon booked opposite side Downtown Summerlin Wolfgang Puck  Walking heavenly!    warm cozy smell fire  waitress friendly tolerant questions requests all customer! always smiled  ordered chicken salad sandwich bread toasted steak salad mac cheese  food took while partner crime getting agitated    but then came upon 1st bite mac cheese all forgiven  mac cheese dreams made of  Literally perfection  chicken salad sandwich both savory sweet    also amazing  only critique bread almost hearty tough  Otherwise referred special should permanent! flank steak salad even well done succulent  salad delicious but dressing wasn't creamy thick enough hold salad's substance even asking extra dressing didn't help   very pleasant experience we're looking forward immersing ourselves again  <EOR> Great location same quality quirky but good menu   Wonderful vibe drink stop before show <EOR> This place exceeded expectations  food amazing great service loved atmosphere  def back !

<EOR> Didn't chance experience appears nice menu! noon yesterday Tues upon entering experienced most restaurant noise ever! seated but left before ordering just much!  PS Google shows location two miles south where actually is within Downtown Summerlin shopping mall  Google shows Oval Park Drive but when 10955 added relocates Garden Park Drive! <EOR> Went yesterday party 5 people   nice lunch spot meet friends atmosphere     think if again would cocktail if hungry    All friends food looked great presentation however no raving meals     caesar salad asked chicken   super bland   actually thinking maybe forgot dressing    added friend's dill dressing salad hoping would better    Another friend chicken salad sandwich which lunch special said pretty good    Another steak salad which also lunch special   Another burger fries  The skinny fries very good     place still new but no comparison SPAGO also Wolfgang Puck restaurant    Anyway bill $104  left $20 tip  basically $24 person lunch    Seems little pricey got    I'd rather Red Robin pay half price walk full satisfied    bad can't those other restaurants open Downtown Summerlin   mean really mall opened Oct 9  <EOR> Overpriced! Blah food best bet next door Crave which amazing but try once  won't back <EOR> I ordered chicken salad sandwich  good but disappointed discover toasted bread burnt side hidden inside sandwich  mentioned waitress  response disappointing  She basically confirmed burnt  Yeah   Thanks see that  <EOR> Gianna very best guide Wolfgang excursion  She doll  Hope her!!xxoxoxox <EOR> Worst service ever!!!!
