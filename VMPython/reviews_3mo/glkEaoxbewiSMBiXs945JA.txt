Very new place stopped first day business but didn't order anything because closing up  convinced brother place needed final meal  didn't high expectations because restaurant less 24 hours old but everything place professional    The staff amazing friendly no errors fumbles orders  huge plus  didn't see single person didn't smile friendly demeanor    Now pizza many options but spinach feta chicken over pesto  completely blown away  real pizza some Pizza Hut deal cheese chunks cooked over fire stone oven should be  brother wasn't sure if he would pizza but when he finished first slice he exclaimed best pizza ever more  originally planned take pizza airport but didn't past five minutes    I never 800° pizzeria before but college student many pies before say without doubt best pizza ever coming back more place other three locations    I no negatives say all  highly recommend place even if aren't pizza person!! <EOR> So walking strip hungry walked almost walked out  bad place cheap few things didn't really wanted BBQ chicken pizza  good place everything did order Yummy? custom made pesto pizza think best ever  kids god sausage pizza then salad some drinks  Everything custom made very fresh  highly recommend pmace? <EOR> Located right outside Monte Carlo next Double Barrel Roadhouse  Spacious airy bright inside outdoor patio area   You'll see assembly line employees upon entering  Pick pizza want any add ons additional $1 50  margherita added rosemary ham mushrooms spinach well the carni salsiccia pepperoni meatballs rosemary ham added artichokes  Also burrata melon proscuitto comes bread  Pay then you'll number they'll call when your order's ready   Verdict okay  hints wood burnt taste way made  appreciated that  Although carni surpassed flavor compared margherita  Tip more add ons more difficult it'll your pizza hold since thin  burrata good  Prosciutto melon blended well but don't think I'd again price   Also glass Prosecco $10 glass beer $9  serve gelato too    Overall good lunch although more pricier side when everything totaled up  Would come back? Maybe just because better  admit while piece carb heaven even eating date's crusts mind taste buds thinking couldn't help but compare Settebello Pizzeria    <EOR> I staying Monte Carlo wanted something quick easy walking back convention center   Tried pesto pizza first day added capers artichoke hearts  don't expect them piled high deep but I'd able see few each pie  Pesto mediocre   Tried again few days later when Margherita  Could used more sauce though pizza very watery fresh mozzarella   Overall great  crust good but don't think anyone really knows much pizza  <EOR> Staff hasn't trained well   Person Salad Bar section gloves but put hair bun gloves TWICE then didn't change gloves before making next salad   Gross     This place much potential   Just sure handle food hygenic way! <EOR> This real Neapolitan pizza  tends softer middle typical delivery pizza   should be  Stick 4 5 toppings ask extra crispy if soft center isn't your thing  Soda machines everything imaginable beer offerings solid well  <EOR> The place interiors good interpretation real Neapolitan pizzeria  Marble tables minimalist furniture   made feel home I'm Napoli Italy    I margherita doc   to made products really good  tip use same mozzarella both filetto margherita doc but double price second saying bufala mozzarella  Just take filetto cheaper very good!!!

Situated along Las Vegas Blvd right front Monte Carlo Casino great pit stop quick lunch dinner while strolling  around area   I customize any pizza staff whips up   say start off Margherita pile desired toppings   Being NYC pizza fan prefer picking folding pizzas half   Unfortunately case Neopolitan pizza they're quite thin soggy even adviced use silverware instead picking up   Nonetheless crust tasty ingredients fresh   Due its location pint beer costs $9 which succumbed since theres really nothing better washing down amazing pizza cold glass Moretti   Overall 800 Degrees Pizza delicious pizzas superb customer service   local probably won't come back often especially since Settebello just right around neighborhood  <EOR> My other love besides breakfast pizza    So light lunch because boo split pizza day pool  very tastey  If you're staying monte carlo having pizza place just down stairs very nice convenience  did down S O  buy but he came back within 20 30 minutes Margherita pizza he added ham it    Some people may softness bread because thin could toastier but still found delicous  could taste fresh each bite  could easily eaten whole thing myself  <EOR> Great pizza fabulous ingredients nice setting!

See photos    impossible eat can't believe restaurant would serve did   Seriously when place closed soon surprised   The first warning sign only 4 customers entire restaurant when walked in   11 people behind counter working   weird    all kind just standing around few them just watching others work   Restaurants aren't busy and empty usually reason   soon learned why   The pizza ordered pepperoni olive pineapple   woman making nice but admit pizza didn't even look all great when being made   She used very few ingredients seemed   roughly $15 personal size pizza seemed average best while being made   I cash register pay new cashier being trained day   took quite bit longer expected   looked around thinking now maybe even cooks prep people being trained well   appeared few managers just standing around watching them hawk   odd   Three months into new restaurant would've expected things running smoother   The pizza arrived   edges black crust them way   However closer glance revealed entire interior pizza undercooked uncooked   Picking first slice clear thing complete mess   entire pizza toppings slid off including cheese everything   left holding wet piece literally uncooked dough some tomato sauce   rubbery mess entire middle pizza drowned wetness more soup pizza!  whole thing gooey wet runny   crust thin undone drooping disaster   Each slice that watery dripping unable even stand normal pizza slice     It inedible   Before left scooped some soup like toppings fork didn't even taste good   crust no flavor all   never back would implore anyone reading think twice ever stepping foot place   There's reason ended lower end Vegas properties Monte Carlo rather someplace Cosmopolitan Aria Caesar's Palace   Eat place your own peril   I'd give zero stars if could  <EOR> Who knew could delicious meal strip such great price    tucked far back casino but litterally steps Strip    order then seat yourself but real dishes silverware classy    food comes fast tastes good almost best pizza gourmet pizza places popping everywhere    What's like?  Once word gets perhaps enough seating? <EOR> This place awesome!! gluten free pizza crust best since finding Celiac  very accommodating took time explain ordering process worked  salads made fresh top quality ridiculously good! husband ordered tartufo gluten free pizza literally able stop thinking it! even pondered whether enough time run down grab pizza airport!

So list pizzas if you're super indecisive sure want ranging $11 $15    If your own pizza choose your sauce Marinara Bianca white pizza Pesto Margherita  Then choose many proteins cheese vegetables like! All toppings $1 50 except special ones truffle oil shrimp those $3 $6 buffalo cheese    I back twice during stay Vegas very yummy fast honestly prices aren't terrible considering you're Vegas    The employees also really friendly help decide give suggestions  bf couldn't decide day 1 guy gave really good tips choosing pizza also   chile sauce FREE topping My pizza bianca truffled cheese prosciutto  second time pesto pizza mushrooms garlic chicken feta! <EOR> So friend tried place having noticed high reviews place highly rated also Los Angeles  impressed     This your own pizza place  start certain pizzas no sauce red sauce red sauce no cheese pesto  basic pies between $7 8 which bad    but when toppings $1 50 each special toppings $3 each add really fast! ordered red sauce pizza 2 toppings pizza already $11 individual pie   also order specialty pies come predetermined toppings average $14       tried many other pizza places WAY cheaper! example places Pieology Project Pie much cheaper just price unlimited toppings  tried Project Pie inside MGM $12 pizza but love Pielogy only $8 pizza unlimited toppings  Frankly think Pielogy tastes better much less    I'm guessing prices higher because 800 Degrees higher end pizza place    but pizza all tasty me  dough good but soggy middle pizza! think pizza crust should crispy!   The location Los Angeles cheaper prices location Vegas  don't mind paying $11 pizza but want taste good  Now tried don't wonder anymore good enough want come back  Next time try Project Pie inside MGM  always see more people anyways  <EOR> The only reason place worthy star because refunded money  pizza place designed subway where down line chose your toppings  boyfriend first girl making pizza obviously new because she going very slow which fine  he made sure patiently say exactly he wanted pizza she nice accommodating  She just finished putting together pizza when another employee took pizza said he needed give pizza another customer because theirs ruined oven  boyfriend specifically said no because she spent long time making pizza way he wanted  didn't care still gave other customer  very annoyed say least  finally getting pizza lifted piece everything fell off wouldn't even stay up  took bite literally tasted dough  slimy cooked all way  extremely disappointed but then worse  noticed large black hair cooked pizza! almost vomited disgusting   point completely grossed asked money back which kindly did  waste your money place  550 Aria billion times better! <EOR> I wasn't impressed just keep walking New York New York better pizza  waste time wish back  <EOR> It's little over week since moved Vegas LA  things thought would miss most 800 Degrees Westwood  ecstatic when found 800 Degrees franchise Strip!  The Monte Carlo did nice job renovating facade some new restaurants  pizza relatively same LA  main difference slightly higher cost toppings soda  Each additional topping $1 50 instead $1 soda $1 more well  Other margherita pizza fantastic usual  manager even walked around check all customers    Cheap good pizza truly hard beat  <EOR>
