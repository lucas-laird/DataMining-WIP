More confusion me   Pulled stand 1 30   the sign read closed What? 1 30 afternoon? walk closer stand girl opens sliding window ask closed? No all she says confused look somehow still buying but drove all way WTH place orders   ordered beef taco tofu egg taco french fries fried dough   four items ordered only order took OVER 15 MINUTES! Whats even fishier situation is he gave fried dough first then fries then lastly tacos ordered FIRST    I seriously think he close day when arrived because Ron didn't even take time heat tortillas tacos Cool warm Out of the bag chewiness warmth softness properly heated tortilla  If you've eaten Thai style beef jerky thats tough beef taco was  egg tofu tasteless version Kimchi came short lacking heat tanginess good kimchi  not so french fries not so impressive just salty mess  fried dough only decent thing whole order  Come think whole time waited order didn't  hear any sounds  smells cooking curiousity pulled into another parking spot just see if he closing shop WHADDAYA KNOW? within 5 minutes umbrellas came down packed food cart he gone  Ron wish told closed day instead feeding such mediocre food  Coming CIA Culinary Institute America Graduate even more hard believe because know fact weren't taught way  Yes happen CIA graduate myself        <EOR> The mere thought them tastebuds giddy weeks  love kimchi love corn tortillas kimchi tacos seemed guaranteed culinary nirvana  Mix tofu convinced someone listening prayers   Alas kimchi tofu egg taco Hanshik disappointment  only taco am giving them 3 stars benefit doubt  Sadly solo taco experience probably prevent returning unless hear tofu rework    What shortcomings taco? Well primarily three 1  tortilla corn  big fat flour one  Props providing generous tacos but flour tortilla warm yummy  Perhaps corn does well tofu? If then think thinner warmer perhaps even smaller flour tortilla would more delightful taco  2  kimchi kimpressive  reminded more sauerkraut  Yes cabbage fresh but seasoning heavy sourness without balance chili spice  3  tofu egg mixture seasoned well thus pretty much tasted plain scrambled eggs    All combined taco think could use some improvement  always mad props inventive passionate entrepreneur  Service definitely nice enthusiastic    I would say give other tacos crazy dough whirl  <EOR> After hearing much korean taco truck LA excited find Las Vegas   around neighborhood running errands decided check place since live other side town     It literally 112 outside thank god no line   tried beef tofu egg tacos also ordered fries    gota say thing definitely different tacos   couldn't strong grasp whether truly liked them not   Korean type slaw threw top tacos bit sweet strange taste it   tortillas everyone else said flour hot soft should be   fries tasty but also bit salty side     Overall its cool place try but probably wont coming back while since didn't blow mind   probably excited idea then food let down bit  <EOR> Having tire blowout left way bummed price replacing pair them total left even more down dumps!  Good thing tire store next Hanshiktaco which really nice owner good Nate dog!     crazy Korean Taco truck looks really nice clean inside he fine conversation while great meal $5! French Fries pretty rad but star kimchee laden Nathan's hot dog!   little Siracha rocks!    I'm glad finally stopped although wish I'd buy new tires it     cash only which only other problem   But prices afford change your car! <EOR> While getting oil changed very happy find taco truck nearby parking lot   all hype Kogi other Korean themed taco trucks finally going chance try it     There only 4 types tacos available decided each   four tacos came $10   first disappointment   Granted tacos lot stuff them but $2 50 taco still really steep   tacos themselves well   their much say unfortunately   kimchi wasn't very flavorful fact thought more sauerkraut kimchi   kimchi also overpowering couldn't taste lettuce cilantro fact only way able tell pork chicken beef its texture color   only taco any flavor other kimchi egg tofu   guess would favorite since able taste something other kimchi interesting texture     The service very friendly   would give 2 5 stars but case 3 close enough  <EOR> My opinion hasn't changed actually breave enough try egg tofu steak   actually liked egg tofu     but am still saying STEAK fave   I am actually starting dreams tacos!  maybe because am allowing myself sugars carbs very often   I am making exception only tacos    actually tried crazy dough today Rocked!  So good  I am considering adopting owner just he feels obligated give free tacos    *kidding*  I still don't think 4 38 two tacos extreme  don't mind     paying    It said someone else  don't mind paying extra if service there   Honestly     whole enchilada    mean taco    great food great service     back again  <EOR> Stopped chicken taco fix try something new  Nate's dog awesome Simple if may good textures great flavor  uniquely seasoned fries great too   Still loving place   very few things start craving for   love those chicken tacos!! <EOR> 3 5 stars but rounded up   Had all four tacos offered today which chicken beef pork tofu egg    Overall tacos okay all tacos kimchi expect bit crunch little spice would better if tortilla warmer soft  tacos $2 50 just bit bigger 99 cent taco Del Taco if somewhere $1 50 piece would certainly load them each order   The fried dough good reminds donut holes taste funnel cake    The wait time may little long because man show everything cooked order    I did try hot dog but perhaps future next time am area  <EOR> Hanshiktaco now regular lunch spots  seems Slider Truck which love never near happy when heard Hanshiktaco being parked Lee's Discount Liquor Lake Mead Tenaya    The tacos comprised simple flavors when layered become quite tasty  meat I chicken pork lightly seasoned cut maybe shaved very small  pieces  kimchee slightly spicy but also sour   The chef used flour tortillas  dismayed first because corn favorite but unlike other reviewers tortilla soft warm  think grilled because crispy places    Sure trip Del Taco Taco Bell would cheaper but ew! Why when real food? 2 tacos $4 something more enough food lunch think price very reasonable    If heading west Lake Mead may difficult truck because swing u turn take immediate right into parking lot  Approaching east lot easier  <EOR>
