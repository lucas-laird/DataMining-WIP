Best sushi burrito ever had!  tried Redondo Long Beach burritos both delicious!  Staff very friendly professional   back more  <EOR> SUSHI BURRITOS VEGAS UGH YES FINALLY   I may gotten little hyped place which means expectations little bit higher usual    staff friendly but wait 25 30 minutes until could finally order  kept mind new hires working assembly line understandable   Redondo 3 5  $12 95 The first thought came into mind making sushi burrito  all rice put it? Really? thought there'd least little bit more rice lightness fish toppings  quality fish pretty good considering fact don't live coast  All other toppings felt little bit skimped supposed Chipotle Mayo sauce but barely tasted any mine  Overall was't really much flavor didn't really fill which little disappointing and small stomach tbh   friend told could gotten sauces side which should've done! Next time next time     Other food atmosphere refreshing its white open space  order to go didn't really bask restaurant  When coming keep mind may line    because probably few first timers take forever choosing which toppings put sushi burrito   I'll try taro chips maybe juices next time but probably won't going back any time soon since won't dying another sushi burrito again  <EOR> Hi name Jason addicted Jaburritos  second time within week just can't enough!   This place game changer  quick uses quality fish gives your sushi fix absolutely delicious    Get Redondo Long Beach <EOR> I anticipating opening place since month ago when heard it  estatic when heard two favorite things being combined BURRITOS SUSHI  very trendy place but being said more hype food  ingredients especially fish very fresh but portion size left wanting more  ordered Redondo because yellowtail also drink seaweed salad combo  burrito good salad seasoned perfectly  finished food hmmm still hungry  considered getting another burrito but point thought myself price two burritos seaweed salad drink could all you can eat sushi joint left stuffed  Overall experience good but another call noise place  strong echo building gets loud point somewhat annoying  don't having yell across table able converse company  <EOR> Saw vegaseaters com Jaburritos coming Vegas couldn't wait try restaurant! love eating sushi did disappoint! prices fair fish fresh  tried long beach rock port janachos redondo special  I'd definitely recommend friends coming back frequent customer  <EOR> Vegas finally sushi burrito place!   I Rockport soy paper but subbed shrimp tempura soft shell crab subbed salmon spicy tuna  really delicious! only complaint sauces only one side burrito parts without sauces kind bland  may also try seaweed instead soy paper next time  Also wish unagi choices please add your menu!   The setup Chipotle however line moving kind slow when went  understand just opened train employees some them still look cheat sheet ingredients into each burrito  expect line move faster once more familiar products  <EOR> Wonderful John you've done again   Lots choose fun place eat keep coming back least until tried everything menu   Love staff well great personalities fun talk to  <EOR> 7 10  always fan concept  Chef definitely knew demand created trend Las Vegas  experience pleasant staff friendly  Food wise expected bit higher quality side but presentation above mediocre  taste could need little more punch all five senses  far tried Long Beach Redondo Mission  Oh! almost forgot taro chips! crispy greasy also seasoned sweet salty flavor but scoop off your plate sprinkle seasoning onto your taro chips reason didn't stick well onto chips all  also skip cheese sauce taro chips  really thing    Overall still recommend everyone try! #iam3am airuzz@instagram <EOR> A friend recommended location lunch  seemed little strange sushi burrito but am always challenge   I brought 2 friends all ordered something different   All 3 pleasantly surprised amount sushi burrito taste each item  I am hoping portions stay consistent plenty sushi burrito   Only open 6 days little slow but expected  Steady crowd new location]  ECO Friendly very clean open seating   We definitely back! <EOR> Beat crowd!  We first timers here  Wasnt sure order but friendly staff owner sure everything smooth  Just 5 days open crew did A+ job!  Ordered 4 Jaburritos  all them delicious!  They few different pre selected menu items but if want create your own option too    Definitely going eat again! <EOR> Hungry sushi limited time     place    Stop looking Yelp come here  Sushi Burrito <EOR> I place  probably back   I admire desire different adventurous   BUT Jaburrito same problem sushi restaurants have  food no flavor add flavor    with sauces add ons   Let's honest rice no flavor  little pieces styrofoam   Most raw fish no flavor other slightly fishy   Now combine all into flour tortilla or soy paper etc which also no flavor guess MORE no flavor   Oh sure lots TEXTURE but flavor left building  So slather wasabi hot sauce etc   Hmmmm  wonder food strategy   SO test thesis ordered Jaburrito drove few blocks down street Mariana's ordered typical carnitas burrito  Then home ate half each   Guess which more flavor    and therefore more satisfaction? At half price  <EOR> Las Vegas' Soho restaurant gets little brother Japanese Burrito fusion food joint   spoke Soho owner John now manages restaurant he nice enough tell ideas food establishment suggest some food order   I'd rate Jaburrito more 4 5 stars but here's why brand spanking new  workers still learning ropes   minor things reminding employee put forgotten cream cheese Mission Jaburrito somewhat lackluster Jachos nachos two tiny pieces shrimp tempura Jaburrito flavor quality food sushi save day   I first Mission Salmon Ebi Shrimp Cream Cheese Yuzu Guac all assorted veggies Soy Paper   clean fresh delicious   Adding jalapenos all side condiments salsa house soy sauce made even better    My wife decided try some Jachos protein choice tempura shrimp   would select protein again simply because came only two little shrimp tempura ton chips   queso sauce delicious staff also gave few dipping sauces Mango Teriyaki sauce Eel Sauce some pico de gallo    suggestion use bigger shrimp tempura   can't imagine only two would fill custom burrito order without being disappointing customer     I quite pleased though Mission decided back into Chipotle style line more   John suggested try steak burrito wheat tortilla   customized adding queso cheese rommaine lettuce onions cucumbers seaweed salad   topped off John's suggested sauces Soy Chipotle Chipotle mayo     baby exploding flavor crunch   Absolutely love would highly recommend     There's great potential surely hope place only succeeds but also opens more locations every week!   If you're fan sushi new take surely delight your tastebuds! <EOR> Sushi!? Burritos?! Whaaaat?! I super excited find Vegas finally place concept sushi burritos definitely check out  love seafood took while decide choices but finally settled Rockport $11 25 mainly because soft shell crab along some sweet anguila sauce wasabi mayo side  also choice getting wrapped nori dried seaweed    couple others can't recall because nori  wanted smoothie but said they're focusing food now it'll another week until start making drinks   reasonable   So how's taste? bit sad overall size amount rice put but pretty good  choice may hindered tasting quality fish offer since soft shell crab mainly crunch spicy tuna already minced  quite bit sauces even little salsa bar side definitely recommend trying some additional sauces  don't think salsas would well sushi burritos but try them nachos or Jachos I wasn't wow ed first time going but owner other employees seem eager grow improve everything which great! definitely back try other things see decide improve food      I'll also back mango smoothie wanted bad ugh  <EOR> We really excited try place didn't disappoint! came guy asked if ever said no he explained whole thing works  Basically chipotle subway where create your own choose made menu  rockport without tobiko subbed cream cheese instead husband made own  right front they're really friendly patient  wasn't much rice rolls pretty hefty portions proteins toppings  combo meals seaweed salad taro chips dip  rolls really good! husband said he couldn't taste sauces much we'll ask extra next time  sauce dip also very tiny cup kinda hard chip lol  full didn't any room mochis  Each burritos 3 types proteins good size  place itself nice love bright there  They're also trying eco friendly  cool  glad place right house sushi fix whenever craving D <EOR> First time trying sushi burrito wasn't impressed  Having raised Japan grew eating something similar but under different name  called temakizushi ????? Japanese customized hand roll  opinion sushi burrito just more creative name customized hand roll    SERVICE Their assembly line disorganized inefficient  understand just opened last week but saw guy grabbing something over another guy's arm  Then new hire looking through recipe getting way another guy  should take some notes Subway learn run line smoothly  3 people front waited over 20 mins order  Meh   FOOD I ordered Mission $8 95 which comes salmon sushi ebi cream cheese pico de gallo tortilla strips romaine lettuce yuzu guacamole tomatillo shiso sauce  Took pico de gallo since can't handle any heat    There's definitely some texture but absolutely no flavor  Tortilla strips gave some nice crunch liked generous salmon ebi  However even yuzu guacamole tomatillo shiso sauce quick dip soy sauce necessary  Odd only tasted yuzu guacamole half sushi burrito  Put more sauce please    You totally customize your own bowl burrito nachos  Choose your toppings protein sauces  try next time   CONCLUSION I paid around $10 tax tip included burrito wasn't filling  Maybe would've enjoyed experience more if didn't wait long  give another chance future but 3 stars now  <EOR> What amazing idea! No more waiting sushi rolls worry using chopsticks  I am pescatarian fusion perfect me! quick healthy lunch go!

Love   Burritos? Love  Pick choose style eateries? Love   Jaburritos? Having eaten Jaburritos 3 times now can't say fan no matter hype says  isn't terrible its pretty decent but many aspects place wouldn't eat regularly  isn't exactly mind blowing really more giant hand roll isn't giant  Smaller appetite patrons may satisfied sushi burrito but larger appetite patrons may consider getting 2 which ends costly  Consider quickly though because lines tremendously slow place gets busier it'll only take longer  line most 20 minutes which isn't bad sit down but pick choose restaurant its rather slow  Lunch breakers consider ordering ahead time The Long Beach may best ones tried   The sauces great my favorite queso weird eh? but mask most flavors fish which seems counter intuitive if you're eat fish                 good texture though creamy crunchy being most prominent  salsa cups paper cups but larger variation needed dine 2 separate cups dine take out small useful chips    There variety prices each burrito $6 12 but seems bit expensive size  <EOR> Amazing custom burritos but order queso chips joke  side queso  small u can't even put your chip inside small cup  <EOR> This place great lunch break snack  ordered two rolls end being way much food me  ordered baja Rockport  Recommend soy paper texture little crispies bomb <EOR> Came yesterday evening first time first bite immediately put trance  Literally didn't want speak just wanted enjoy every glorious flavor each dreamy bite  Try Long Beach soy wrap! excited back! <EOR> Have ever dreamed day being able eat sushi roll size burrito? Well thanks Jaburritos now can!  This first time ever trying wildly popular sushi burrito craze surprise great! reservations eating giant sushi roll feared rice would packed brick lack flavor quality fish enjoyable textures come love sushi rolls  Good news wasn't depressing soggy rice bomb! compared looks competitors definitely see quality ingredients inventive menu presentation offered here  prep line carefully added fillings burritos science! Everything proportionate well balanced   You option select signature Jaburritos menu which offers good variety appeal even picky eater! If feel courage even create your own just would Chipotle Subway Pieology you idea  also offer Jabowls which poke bowls topped unique ingredients even Jachos which house made taro chips seasoned angel dust would assume side melted queso  really loved taro chips delicately crispy addictive! enjoyed dipping taro chips house salsas really tasty pair! queso wasn't really anything write home about some people refer canned cheese but thought combination interesting   The complimentary salsa bar offered few chunky house made salsas Mild Verde Roja none them being spicy  flavor salsas weren't pronounced which great since didn't overpower Jaburrito chunky texture acid added depth Jaburrito  would say Verde Roja enhanced meal most! Ginger wasabi house soy sauce similar thick black soy sauce also available condiments paired well Jaburrito   Here's tried * Rockport $10 95 Soft shell crab spicy tuna surimi crab jalapeno masago cucumber red onion tempura crunch chipotle mayo sweet anguilla sauce  favorite! Think burrito sized crunchy roll! combination texture flavor really shined through  even asked them add little bit more sauce obliged making explosion flavor! Rated 5 5  * Redondo $12 25 Ahi tuna salmon yellow tail cucumber masago red onion tortilla strips jalapeno cilantro wasabi mayo  good generous fish unexpected crunch tortilla chips added wonderful surprise  Unfortunately wasabi mayo weak would probably ask them add some sweet anguilla sauce maybe another sauce wake next time! Overall good Jaburrito option offering fresh fish  Rated 4 5  This place real hit younger crowd locals word spreads wildfire only going more packed line unrelenting! Also isn't much dining room space finding seating may prove tricky  Crowds aside love offering appreciate sushi burrito trend  really hope proportions remain consistent continue gain popularity would shame see them cut corners lose quality  <EOR> I appreciate took responsibility mistake refunding money  We'll definitely back try again  <EOR> Such amazing experience  Some best sushi ever had  much seating but delicious food! <EOR> Every time foodie fest comes town always sushi burrito truck asap  glad sushi burrito place finally here  pretty busy when but worth it    I Huntington burrito  consisted ahi tuna lettuce onions jalapeño cucumber tortilla strips seaweed salad  Extra extra ahi tuna extra poke sauce   5 5  scarfed burrito down  No ragrets    I also taro chips  Sweet salty goodness cheese dipping sauce    I can't wait back again try everything else D <EOR> I found place local paper some reason sushi burrito just sounded something needed try   decided give shot let just say AMAZING  First off honestly didn't think burritos would full   really thought probably still going hungry afterward because c'mon kill some sushi any given day as long good! burritos didn't look your average burrito   ordered Redondo burrito since Yelped before some those chips side cheese   When sat down eat heaven  paid two burrito combos only $25 plus tip   bad all considering fresh seafood generous it   hate when places cover seafood bunch veggies stuff can't tell much seafood actually your meal  Nope  place  paid extremely satisfied    My ONLY complaint place seating   don't live close enough place able take when getting close time pay bit nervous would sit car eat   understand works but kind annoying people saving seats people end long ass line  sure time THOSE people ate people would already done food  Lucky placed order but right before walked someone just done eating left   sat down hurry before other scavengers stole seat friends line  Anyway sure place didn't expect busy popular which explains limited seating  If there's thing point would only that  Otherwise walked full completely satisfied  <EOR> I love anything raw fish decided give place try see all hype about    Atmosphere Really clean simple setting restaurant    Menu Easy read lots options  1 could customize your own burrito 2 pick roll  already customized    Food redondo delicious!! came tuna salmon yellowtail Fave fish   10 10 always own soy sauce which more thick side but really good!!

No but neither does sushi burrito!  Verdict Pretty good but little strange putting seemingly never ending piece sushi into your mouth  Also  TARO chips queso! Favorite part meal really  <EOR> Sushi burrito    Interesting concept but even cooler person!!  just really HUGE sushi roll!!   You opt normal ish burrito depending extras decide add  tortillas   fear non adventurous sushi people    I made own nori rice which nice thin layer  some shrimp tempura some random stuff but seaweed salad best part!   Prices reasonable considering prices normal sushi joint same more smaller portion    We also queso taro chips  Both which pretty good    We left feeling satisfied but overly stuffed good feeling belly wasn't greasy oily heavy meal    There isn't many tables sure busy night during dinner rush pretty busy    We'll back sure!! <EOR> I love place! high expectations accolades given people know enjoyed jaburritos foodie fest  recommendation ordered softshell crab spicy tuna  did disappoint  Paired seaweed salad drink totalled 14$ which fair given quality ingredients portion size ample  texture flavor right point seems natural progression sushi rolls  em size burrito?

They some popular burritos already built certain ingredients could choose build your own  Since first time decided popular ones   boyfriend Redondo Rockport   pick your wrapping seaweed soy paper wheat tortilla flour tortilla   both seaweed since most popular    Redondo really good salmon tuna yellowtail Masago jalapeño Onion tortilla strips   good together sashimi fresh!   The Rockport spicy tuna crab soft shell crab jalapeño onion    Both just super yummy side home made taro chips   comes cheese dipping but totally hides flavour tastes best nothing because seasoned     They definitely need restaurants Toronto!!! during lunch pretty busy subway 4 people dressing burritos cashier! Can't wait come back Vegas try another jaburrito!!! <EOR> Mucho oishii! Another great fusion spot! Sushi burritos nothing new but Jaburritos easily best ever had  Jaburritos does miss sushi burritos SF LA food trucks all!   The menu simple 1 Pre designed concoctions *probably most popular choice if trying first time* 2 Build your own sushi burrito jachos rice bowl   Items tried Redondo If love raw fish loaded yellowtail ahi tuna salmon! most flavorful but flavors enhanced house soy sauce extra wasabi! salsa salsa bar if  your thang  Long beach favorites! shrimp tempura surimi crab spicy tuna  flavors chipotle mayo sweet anguilla sauce puts over top! Baja Yellowtail spicy tuna  Good but great  only sampled this  think needed second flavor profile  yuzu guacamole alone did oomph  Maybe salty sweet element missing? Jachos ahi tuna toppings your choice! Imagine set Chipotle Subway  Taro chips queso  addicting  whole idea cheese weird first but totally works! Love chips dusted furikake!  I love high quality fish house made sauces fresh ingredients nice touches crunch tortilla strips!    Workers friendly great attitude  initial visit less efficient still working kinks  Second visit much improved  would imagine would only even better time    Be prepared wait but WORTH it! <EOR> Amazing amazing amazing food! Seriously  if love sushi need here  delicious  Confusing first because don't really know your ordering but once OMG   Whole notha level  definite regular  Great staff too! <EOR> Crazy good  don't even know where begin  Rockport incredible  Also tried taro chips queso odd  daughter Kodiac loved it  don't know could wrong anything menu  Staff very nice friendly  <EOR> I Kodiak lunch then back dinner  food great staff  Its very interesting watch them your burrito  definitely going back  <EOR> Isn't everyone waiting happen? Sushi burrito form  Duh  Anyways good hoped  ordered seaweed burrito spicy tuna tamago cucumbers green onions hush chili wasabi mayo  boyfriend ordered long beach  think if keep protein just pack full veggies better deal signature items  taro chips must but really strange cheese  tried stick mostly Asian ingredients but curious see would taste tortilla    The place packed which understandable  ton people working but still seemed really slow  didn't seem good system going telling cashier people ordered  also think could consolidate some items  really need green onion red onion? Cabbage romaine lettuce? Tomatoes pico? Nice options but hard time hearing understanding wanted custom order  Also salsa station really random but then again didn't order any Mexican ingredients  Loved rice press though   Overall great experience hope expand other parts town soon  More seating would great! <EOR> Customized hand rolled burrito style rolls fast food environment  Definitely tasty but don't come actually expecting sushi grade quality  Also don't talk real sushi chef you'll probably smacked face   Expect fast food environment somewhat better fast food quality service   Worth trying if area hankering snack  something sushi burritos but really exactly either  Basically alright  <EOR> Decided because hype wouldn't curious Japanese Mexican fusion?! kinda sad when friend because basically only customers restaurant  Friday night sure happened   I ordered Rockport made into combo corn chips soda total around $14 15  quality food good but don't think worth price quantity  burritos nothing more glorified hand rolls  finished meal even feeling satisfied which bummer but wasn't bad since boba right after  friend also told he tacos nearby restaurant since he still hungry   Overall would recommend checking place but don't if hungry  perfect those don't eating big meals don't mind paying little extra  <EOR> Great concept great flavorful food! Everyone very helpful helping figure eat   More less giant sushi roll  <EOR> I am biased because love Soho followed chef John Nunu over but could not? took concept sushi burrito blew continue use same high quality fish process  love first ones bring Las Vegas  love many choices fish toppings sauces choose from  love created restaurant entirely recycled materials    Who cares if there's wait? When finally sit down bask burritos glory worth it  many restaurants without reservation standard 20 30min  wait when finally sit down still wait approximately another 30 45min  ordering actually cooking your food  don't think anyone ever thought would blown quickly can't blame them trying catch figure flow    Anyways building own burritos because greedy toppings protein  use fish chicken beef tofu tempura soft shell crab your protein  use seaweed rice paper your official wrap seal your burrito  even brown rice    I also love Jachos  Something queso lightly sugared taro chips just well together  even customize your Jachos well  If you're lazy add your own toppings won't regret getting Long Beach Jachos  Also need know where getting Japanese melon mango drinks because compliment meal perfectly  <EOR> ATTENTION Jaburritos closed per se  just did name change SOHO SushiBurrito  They're still located exact same location same employees management team  claim still using same ingredients such but can't comment since haven't tried myself  Expect new review SOHO SushiBurrito Yelp review page shortly       No more waiting Foodie Fest Jokasaki fix  now JABURRITOS town!

The restaurant tiny only few tables  I'd recommend taking your food to go because lack seating you'll end smelling cooking oil  service great though  price per sushi burrito $9  tiny sushi rolls maki other restaurants $8 but sushi burrito roughly 2 3 times bigger maki  <EOR> This place pretty much over sized sushi rolls  Likin' lot   Service quick efficient but everyone still nice behind counter  They'll answer your questions menu options ingredients without any hesitation   Setting still new they're still add more plus plaza renovating outside building  Don't let deter you  Honestly wish more seats available though  I Rockport when guys behind counter asked wanted pretty much left them load thing  disappointed whatsoever  spicy but other cool toppings balanced everything burrito  Considering place sister establishment SoHo liked Seaweed Salad same didn't even drive it  Taro Chips weren't salted but peppered which well hot cheese   On side note liked way boyfriend didn't even want dig into meal first but then he just habitually picked away chips all his  <EOR> first time trying sushi burrito  didn't seafood wanted  want try sure  bit pricey but definitely different any other burrito  wrapped seaweed rice  bit small but enough satisfy you  <EOR> Jaburrito's Las Vegas' new place must try  am little picky when comes seafood love custom burrito option  Definitely great flavors love roasted corn chips added burrito  <EOR> OH EM GEE!!! Sushi burritos?! me    I am sucker saucy crunchy fresh tasting sushi roll lot going on  love tempura eel sauce avocado tuna salmon list on  becomes bit extreme roll because end being gigantic and never mind cost   BUT Chef John Chien Lee solved problem! THANK MASTER!   Jaburritos such winning concept  Chipotle Sushi world but better    Pick your wrapping soy seaweed i opted soy then decide whether you'd concoction already perfected if you'd take stab your own creation   modified Rockport which soft shell crab spicy tuna surimi crab jalapeno masago cucumber red onion tempura crunch chipotle mayo sweet anguilla sauce  said nah surimi crab added avocado salmon  Enter perfect roll! BURRITO! freakin' good    These giant hand roll everything could ever desire  thing legit though hands down quality  Nothing mushy rice cooked perfectly fish fresh firm  high quality roll beautiful blanket burrito ness    I'm really hoping expansion San Diego because two places tried hand concept failed  PLEASE CHEF LEE HELP OUT!!!   I promise if love sushi you'll love place you'll crave it   often   like all time  every day  ugh  <EOR> Great experience both times went  burritos right front choose menu your own which ballsy enough do  location slightly awkward busy quickly much seating accommodate  But product worth super fresh delicious filling  home soy sauce perfect recommend taro chips queso burrito  Enjoy! <EOR> This place pretty bomb  mainly sushi attempt mexican esque adding jalapeños guac red onions etc which think weird sushi but guess some people down it  selections choose menu don't choose yours scratch  RockPort good! told them take off jalapeños cuz weird  also should've told them take off red onions add avocados   It funny cuz guy checked said all nonchalant instead   Haha! Also Asian drinks would find Asian market next Jarritos! odd see those together   Other place clean modern design   Just suggestion store would nice if classic rolls California roll caterpillar rolls dragon roll etc burrito form  would much better  <EOR> I pleasantly surprised when finally chance Jaburrito  expected just giant sushi roll but more because customize some alternative ingredients maybe more importantly texture  nori jaburrito Salmon Avocado my favorite simple roll masago wasabi mayo avocado cilantro lettuce tortilla strips tomato  sets rolls apart mainly going sauces  add another layer flavor choices really enjoyable  also side seaweed salad which pleasant   My jaburrito 7 95 which thought good price fresh fish great tasting ingredients  Other choices run much 10 95 but honestly think better choose favorite protein your own rather jumble 3 more fish together   I've also tasted Jachos taro chips which also tasty but don't really know well fish  I'd think drenching sauces masago veggies would way but I'd experiment more  <EOR> FINALLY Vegas place this  worth it  Food good cute simple environment  You'll love it!! <EOR> I loved food! line super long but definitely worth wait  regular place when crave sushi <EOR> This higher rating believe may really feel place but 3 stars just due idea original Vegas but course nothing new other cities supppppper nice owner talks kind hubby other restaurant    Sushi burrito pick burritos want create your own  Both times picked ones menu Rockport first time Long Beach second time  Rockport all ingredients love but taste lacking barely any flavor  combo does love taro chips???   Hmmm tell why huge chunks salt furikake bottom tray but does stick chips making completely pointless there  Now turn off canned nacho cheese side dip  Taro chips totally covered nacho cheese sauce overpowering took away all chip flavor  Nacho cheese regular chips but taro chips does work  addition saw girl taro chips portion looked 3x size paper bag  Mine 8 chips filling only 1 3 tray served in  Maybe pick another tray fill chips into entire tray does look much missing  tried putting salsa top owner suggested am sorry but none salsas tasted good burrito  really don't all  tried every salsa which all seem canned salsa  swear Pace Picante salsa sure  good match sushi  felt portion pretty small when total combo close $15    Second time opted just Long Beach no combo since impressed taro chips experience  Again no taste burrito    I loveeee sushi wanted restaurant but just did live expectations  <EOR> The sushi itself acceptable while service not    It overall meh  Glad came but would come again  <EOR> Delicious!

They assemble your burrito fairly quickly  fancy machine builds perfect layer rice which lay sheet seaweed  end assembly line another fancy machine wrap your burrito   I rate 5 stars because just delicious fairly quick order  also easy your wallet considering you're essentially paying sushi roll  Average price burrito $10  Add couple bucks sweet combo deal! <EOR> This place borderline addictive  give try once found same Chef owner Soho Which amazing off strip japanese place         disappointed burrito yet but some favorites Rockport Redondo        Brought some co workers all loved it  Brought girlfriend she's jaburrito problem now   lol      tried seaweed paper soy paper flour tortilla  think all good own way  The seaweed tends bit messy near end Best thing Jaburrito always feel pleasantly satisfied without heavy lunch feeling after   Light fresh       definitely need bigger seating area more locations around Vegas    Hope expand!  Lastly Review Robert S    Why would rate place star because aren't open certain day? How's life center universe?  sir very bad things Yelp       way Sundays Sunday's  <EOR> Here lunch first time   Glad early because packed now takes while understand concept    instance thought all build your own until sat down saw flashing menu   Tip owner slow down flashing screen   Doesn't allow time really read   Anyway back food devoured    ordered soy paper spicy tuna salmon fish eggs wasabi aioli cucumbers pico   Glad she told combo added miso soup drink    All $13   bad freshness quality    definitely going regular! <EOR> Interesting concept well implemented  Took wife daughter light dinner  Name changed but food tasty lighter appetites  Didn't really satisfy ceaving sushi  <EOR>
