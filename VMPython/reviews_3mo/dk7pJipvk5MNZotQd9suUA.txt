Had Jimmy John's while chicago some best sandwiches ever thought I'd try them here  While delivery fast free food received just awful  bread scooped sandwiches when specifically ordered all basically crust sandwiches missing ingredients lacked actually remembered put on  Waste money honestly  never ordering again  <EOR> Good 8 subs great tasting bread   touch expensive almost $7 but noticeably better quality Subway   army workers your sub finished quickly   could see getting packed small location hidden corner   parking lot tight packed well  <EOR> In recent years love Jimmy John's but over past two years quality gone downhill significantly  location recently less then awesome experience    First all tiny location! child stroller wasn't really able navigate shop very easily  walk right into registers order drinks bathroom sandwich pick all back corner  ordered three sandwiches asked side avocado cucumber baby munch while enjoyed lunch  told manager owner not sure he does buy containers keep overhead down   Sure understand but should side option charge little extra I wouldn't mind paying little cup appease customer  having option all kind bothered me  finished ordering waited sandwiches back corner  While waiting watched them assemble sandwiches  Basically put three slices meat then fill brim lettuce  asked avocado sandwiches but put all  wasn't really problem because amount avocado pretty pathetic! Every time JJ's asked sauce then asked extra side sauce because tastes good  Well since place doesn't want happy customers just want low overhead eat sandwich dry    A few years ago JJ's much better then Subway Port Subs but today isn't  sure back  If area want sandwich might to  <EOR> I never JJ's until opened up  quite few times now delicious  goto sandwich shop now  <EOR> Spent $21 3 subs owner said he unable give side hot peppers? thought he joking but he then explained he no way charge peppers some sub none all  offered pay side peppers he refused   I am still disbelief      Never going back  Every other sub restaurant America gladly give side hot peppers   Horrible service horrible location  Would recommend  <EOR> I location few times messed order twice now  time totally forgot put lettuce boring gross tomato no lettuce  next time forgot put mayo cheese daughters sandwich she asked for  think food tastes good but focused making your sandwich fast forget right  would rather wait extra couple minutes  still back but am annoyed  positive note staff always super friendly smile talk you  just opened hopefully iron kinks  <EOR> You know what? Jimmy John's doggone good sandwich!! sub shop opened near job little while ago finally opportunity try out  office sent place order 8 subs which came back pick few hours later  JJ's all orders correct labeled everyone's name  employees very friendly polite restaurant itself spotless    When bit into sub    WOW! first thing noticed delicious bread! think could eaten just bread perfectly happy  rest sub just good  meat fixings fresh tasty wasn't skimpy all  True might foot long but thought good value money   fact deliver bonus well   While prefer sandwiches warm I wish offered option perfectly happy #11 JJ's return!! <EOR> I work Red Rock across street decided order sub today lunch  bit time crunch because break 3  didn't call until 2 35 man phone assured would time placed order  ordered number 4 extra hot peppers which only came 6$  very happy that  Because work hotel kind complicated explain where was    When off phone money ready expected take least 20 minutes delivery  amazement sandwich no time  literally sandwich within 10 minutes placing order no difficulties finding where was  Once sat down eat also blown away  absolutely delicious!   I am pleased Jimmy Johns placing many more lunch orders future ! <EOR> For sandwich place love Jimmy John's! location particular really tight parking no drive through    However if you're planning going sitting down eat weather outside nice good amount outdoor chairs tables umbrellas  Sanwiches really good  always order Beach Club #12 is   AND really freaky fast    sandwich ready before could put wallet back purse! B <EOR> The WORST customer service ever experienced!! delivered wrong sandwich office when called asked if could please deliver correct sandwich redirected every employee works them tell fault  10 minutes finally speaking manager then owner agreed deliver sandwich  waited 30 minutes finally called see if way owner nerve tell did clear wanted new sandwich  owner delivered sandwich office very rude raised voice saying next time order need specify am still complete shock over experience  NEVER order them again  <EOR> Was excited Jimmy Johns close house!  big JJ fans years  Needless say disappointed new location  scoop bread out fill tons lettuce  amount meat ridiculously minimal  also could side peppers due overhead! Never heard sub restaurant being CHEAP  Maybe saving buy new patio furniture put new outdoor eating area  If place wants last Summerlin better program give customers money's worth  <EOR> As relatively recent transplant Midwest when heard new Jimmy Johns opened near neighborhood positively thrilled     We've dined location twice now both times pretty disappointing but different reasons   The first time into shop take out   Clearly shop staff new gave them wide birth forgiveness   young guy register tried correct ordering all sandwiches stating he just trying save money    great!   really lovely customer service but sandwiches well meaning order changes all wanted   said decided give them another go   and today   I called delivery order yes lived slogan Subs fast you'll freak! However when received order totally wrong   received someone else's order wrong no extras ordered paid missing all sandwiches   immediately called store mistakes happen when told staff wrong order could hear total chaos erupt background   clarified three times missing orders finally assured new order would way   Great!  Problem solved    My terminally hangry nine year old told he could wait any longer gave ahead dig figuring he could sandwich he ordered second lunch afternoon snack   Significantly later first order new sandwiches arrived   thanked driver then he told he needed original order   What?  never restaurant before   If screw order if want repeat business comp it   gave guy old order kiddo says    think they're going it?  Ewwwwww  Honestly made wonder too  Oh replacement order   ?  still wrong  I highly doubt back judging rating franchise currently holds lot other guests either   Bummer  <EOR>
