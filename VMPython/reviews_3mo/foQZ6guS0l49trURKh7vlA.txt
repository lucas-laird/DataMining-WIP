I opportunity check new place last night soft opening   believe officially open weekend   Good food good vibe very friendly staff   far food highlight meal BBQ Chicken Lettuce Wraps   awesome must try   also tried ribs salmon few sides great mac n' cheese    All very good great presentation   definitely back try more when officially open   They set live music but didn't band playing night however great sound system DJ made fun atmosphere   Above dining area grated catwalk which staff dancers periodically routine right above you   perfect set place right strip     A useful side note   there currently isn't entrance Monte Carlo Casino   just walk strip only access Las Vegas Blvd  <EOR> I love atmosphere easy high energetic  Very good groups relax work hang out! <EOR> Had couple brewskis bar restaurant live music venue Monte Carlo Hotel Casino   Pretty rockin' place!  Friendly staff good vibe!  back definitely! <EOR> Came dinner rather large group 12 but waiters kept forgetting things ordered such bringing friend's beer eventually cancel bringing half group's dinner  Overall ambiance fun food good  highly suggest catfish sandwich <EOR> On fence mixed bag deliberation   Let first commend hostesses  Great opener first time visitor  Extremely friendly courteous genuinely enthusiastic   We ordered loaded BBQ nachos crispy deep fried meatloaf cheddar cheese grits fried catfish sandwich crackling pork shank BBQ brisket   The best part meal appetizers  meatloaf nacho boulder phenom start     that meatloaf should every deathrow prisoner's bucket list             then sideways slightly downhill 2 bit skateboard park  catfish salty brisket dry cheese grits too       out of a cardboard box tasting  saving grace pork shank because        heck anyone screw pork BBQ place?  The live band very ordinary seriously mess Sharona ? but highlight throughout night double barrel dancers kicked heels throughout night rafters well waddling 2 stepping throughout restaurant       very welcomed distraction   Because SBE restaurant top fact Vegas bar expected high menu prices yeah they're cheap folks expectations high therefore rating standards tough one    Cocktails decent but ridonkulously high priced small quantity Bar service slow  also need work sound engineering accoustic construction waaaaay much audible turbulence restaurant air far thick  think something fog machines but whatever airflow very stale eventually left because headaches   That said won't take away general fun atmosphere place  dancers really brought great dynamic place no shortage gawking diners  sort reminiscent days when Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders could send any place into high octane frenzy when toured country one of a kind breed back day   From epicurean standpoint skip place if you're expecting anything more basic BBQ roadhouse joint  But if you're mood group fun you'll probably it    Will come back? partying? Yes  food? Meh      we'll see     <EOR> Good food excellent location three bars plenty scenery!  Great new spot strip  staff really trying hard cool!  Outdoor seating right strip watch all freaks walk by!! <EOR> I opening night despite being busy service friendly took reasonable amount time  Ambiance lively fun    Not impressed food  Ribs OK pretty tough very lightly sauce covered  Biscuits gravy gross couldn't even pinpoint watery gravy seasoned besides salt  Biscuits themselves also tasteless    Despite being busy lot standing around observed wait staff but being new expected until into stride  <EOR> This place AWESOME!!! amazing meal buffalo chicken sliders UNREAL nachos perfect!! also some fried pickles menu but awesome!! Love place! def going back!! <EOR> My wife tried weekend  pulled pork sandwich really good but grilled cheese pretty much flavorless  needed something more give final kick  sweet potato fries also soggy instead crisp  place new seems still few bugs work out    The service ok but took forever drinks initial visit waitress  <EOR> We did enjoy place all     over priced even happy hour specials worst service ever  He sat chatted customers ignored us  Just bad atmosphere  Never again  <EOR> I think restaurant very cute  would drink maybe appetizer  dinner weren't very satisfied  server very nice  roadhouse nachos  didn't seem able find anything appetizing menu chose Nachos  came cookie sheet  top cheese pulled pork sauce sweet  said baked beans them well  put them side  cold sweet  sour cream wasabi it  truly did them  friend mini pulled pork sliders  He said good but agreed everything sweet  cute place good drinks appetizers only  <EOR> Worst bar strip   came watch games March Madness  7 TVs bar area all same game manager said impossible change even TVs because all schedule   kidding me? Don't come here  Bad service incompetent management somehow ran beer noon  <EOR> Never write reviews but say since when did bartenders start acting they're above people aren't supposed social?  I came dinner friends food good  Hostess welcoming  Table server friendly  Recommend appetizer tower HUGE Double Barrel Burger    However dinner decided stop bar girl guy bartender  girl nice blond smiled everyone  Unfortunately sat blond guy's section he only waited girls came joked around bartender coworker  When asked drink seemed drag take order  hired place? If think your muscles above everyone work Gold's Gym buddy you're nothing special  coming again   So rated two stars because outstanding negative service  <EOR> I Vegas every year March Madness thought place AWESOME   refuse sit smoke filled sports bar packed sardines   stumbled place Saturday watch third day games   wait less 5 minutes which fabulous   drank 32oz beers Shock Top $14 ate multiple appetizers $6   should give place bad review scare everyone away way same experience next year when arrive   being said place 10x greater location just south     won't mention name  but name spanish DEVIL  <EOR> This new open air bar awesome!  perfect place gather friends  watch basketball games during March Madness over past weekend   service friendly quick Bloody Mary BEST Vegas!  smokey taste really unique just delicious!

Cheers! <EOR> I recently dinner slow night experienced different service compared busy night  cocktails looked tasted good however did bartenders bar sitting favored some guests more others  ordered looked high school jock blond muscles buddy odd facial hair  only did take long them start drink because jokes seemed more important but also saw them pour mason jar full vodka friends across bar  Being local shocked see happening open NEW restaurant strip  No managers slow night???   The food good itself but then again never checked after  Maybe sit table where servers seem friendlier if ever decide back   For future visitors food fruity drinks would recommend but service you've warned  <EOR> We event husbands work  food great drinks really good  Double Barrel Iced Tea  food served bite  seasoned fries pulled pork sliders mac cheese crispy chicken sliders  All tasted great  service bit slow but  probably because several people event  <EOR> Traditionally food important bar business    so generally unhealthy uninspired inedible unless drunk    In past decade some shrewd restaurateurs figured bar food didn't always crap This created concept Gastro Pub which essentially artisanal beer liquor combined high end cuisine   Well guys Double Barrel didn't memo   because food dreadful   I BBQ ribs friend chicken fried steak  Both came 5 minutes ordered them which means prepared well in advance waiting patiently under heat lamps called upon   Nice   On top place located right strip front Monte Carlo casino which requires 10 minute walk parking lot through casino hostess stand   If just want beer big screen sports describe things awesome then place you  But if you're looking good food worth paying then skip place  <EOR> Food great but server order wrong maybe because music loud  play good mix music like  Over all would come back here  <EOR> Great southern food   all very happy orders   we Chicken Fried Steak Brisket Pulled Pork Sandwiches Ribs Fried Chicken   sides great well   opened recently kinks work out   waited quite while waiter take order   Otherwise pleased service some best food trip   I'd definitely recommend it     Its also great restaurant open strip patio area   seems its more accessible strip  <EOR> I would give more stars if didn't tax hell everything  Nachos different had bbq sauce it BUT VERY YUMMY huge  few  beers place huge  came late night sat close stage top floor   band good entertaining  really liked place until $50 something bill noticed $23 tax added it   service tax entertainment tax food tax   totaling $23on $50 something bill   WTH all that?  If rid  all extra hidden charges back   otherwise Never again   plenty other fun places too  Needless say shocked   only 2 1 1 2 hours   <EOR> Went some drinks ask then if change TV see Mexico vs USA very accommodating   bartender Double D mixed some great drinks   All ask drink certain ingredient he did!

Looking something fill your booze soaked gut? Need hearty meal back 100%?  Then look elsewhere   After entire day liver wrecking buddy woke late day thought needed something more substantial usual eggs and toast breakfast  Since place all shiny new acted beacon calling stop bite  open air seating attractive since neither felt being confined  needed constant flow fresh oxygen even if Vegas' smoky streets    I ordered Bloody Mary things going  waitress warned spicy which didn't consider problem  problem just plain sucked  wasn't much spice just overwhelming flavor BBQ sauce which someone some point time thought acceptable ingredient drink  leave wounded soldier die table but just could drink down gullet  really tried    Both friend ordered brisket plate  don't any lunch specials you're basically forced order entire 1 2 lb  brisket once  opted sweet potato fries side since everything else looked extremely heavy    When served immediately felt wave regret wash over us  friend took look tiny bite meat then decided he probably going puke if he kept it  covered plate white sheet napkin laid rest    As meal didn't fare much better  brisket itself plentiful    plenty lukewarm  5 6 other tables occupied here  exactly did food come barely hot? plate also included things parsley bunch grilled lemon  Function over form chefs! WTF am going grilled lemon? plate brisket  asked waitress she said presentation  better idea? Don't waste lemons presentation serves no purpose    Even better idea? Don't waste time considerable amount money eating here  <EOR> Excellent food service    Busy Friday night waters regularly filled server alway near by     The BBQ spring rolls grilled cheese fried chicken sliders amazing   fried s'more simply over top   must order! <EOR> Love open bar right strip  If order beer large  more ordering pitcher then actually beer stein  Staff very friendly  Tvs all round watch game  Waitress shorty shorts  Great prices drinks food reasonable well  Seems more local joint then over done tourist attraction  <EOR> A big group wanted watch NBA playoffs  restaurant helped making room busy Friday night  service lights out  server Wendy spot before ever needed even though she 13 top next us     I Buffalo sliders yum   We also tried chicken lettuce wraps which great  But mac n cheese?
