I live stone's throw away something husband looking forward months showing progress every time drove by  outside didn't really know Container Park going like  first time last night very nice surprise   Once inside realized all planning little area DTLV  shops clothing art candy popcorn yay restaurants bars  wish little store here! There's 3 levels place large play area kids  Big kids b c took ride down slides  fun! also stage small seating standing area live band playing    It's such cool little place hang friends family maybe grab bite eat drink entertained performers well people  excited bringing California friends next time they're town  They're always surprised see other side Vegas since most people knowledge limited strip   The Container Park definitely worth checking out  totally excited it  think adds hoping DTLV's beautiful awakening! <EOR> Yes! First review!! literally came 1 30 already ton people there  place really looks great bunch guards Downtown Rangers crazy Robocop assist you    Although some shops opened because permit issues majority stores open  outside everything looks small but shops decent sized all things considered    There several communal eating areas eat drink outside which fantastic  gives place college vibe  also seating top floor those chairs look mighty comfy!  I checked some if stores everything looks awesome  eagerly anticipating Jessica Galindo's shop happy find leather business card holder  Score!  Loving much coming back tonight! Viva DTLV! <EOR> Being native Las Vegan tend love hate relationship city   current mutation DTLV overtaking specially addition new Container Park definitely rekindled flame debaucherous whore town Container Park mini version Town Square   Reminiscent Lego blocks stacked top each other shipping containers which house boutique stores restaurants bars   Each unit 200+ sq ft imagine orgasmic if 5 other individuals join container   Nonetheless shipyard containers expresses its own sense individuality offers quality product creates urban atmosphere  DTLV all more approachable   favorite part Container Park?  Unfortunately giant flaming lazer eyed metal mantis   kick a$$ lounge areas 2nd floor overlooking entire park   place thankfully family friendly equipped center playground three story tree house kiddos also adult friendly its convenient wine bar beer station all opportunity becoming white girl wasted   Forever high five Tony S! <EOR> I just made cursory stop some photos jaunt downtown earlier week can't give Container Park full review   really they've done space   hard believe only block away site Western Casino much maligned spot Fremont Street   Until December 8th Project Y E S  spaceship Learning Center area kids explore   Check Downtown Project's website ticket information no charge tickets    I'll back another day  at night  and hope see more time walk around inside Container Park enjoy vibes place  <EOR> I'm definitely fan Container Park  container architecture cool fun walk around  feels very inviting cozy  lot places sit relax   But far perfect just yet  many stores right now but I'd surprised if most them survive long  few seem unique but many them very run of the mill tchotchke psuedo style stores don't sell anything real substance   And Pork Beans? $13 some sausage beans? Really? Ridiculous prices container restaurant   So hopefully park survive  Essentially really nice environment hang at   I just hope figure alternative fuel use fire breathing praying mantis whose burnt fumes don't give people headaches  <EOR> This place truly amazing!  It brings flash together creativity Las Vegas! Many shops run local artisans  offerings shops largely unique items mixed trendy whimsical   The live music tonight just added much experience  More stores should complete open grand opening Dec  5  hardly wait return!! <EOR> While trying done just some things fundamentally wrong can't overlooked   Everything overpriced  into every shop every food place every boutique just couldn't justify it  bought pair cheapest most decent looking pair earrings could find Forever21 they'd cost $5 $15 but *only* because mine fell needed put something there   I ate some sandwich place paid $8 grilled cheese  Hello just moved NEW YORK CITY if sandwich $8 ASSURE would more just two pieces bread some cheese  would least put tomato some lettuce some SPICES??? SOMETHING give some flavor  Carmelized onions? Hell I'd even take some raw red onions  chopped raw garlic  Just something pizzazz price  still am disbelief paid if couldn't tell happened two days ago  For reference expect **$7** MANHATTAN LOWER EAST SIDE NYC's most expensive neighborhoods grilled cheese specific restaurant called Little Muenster  THE WORLD'S BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICH Crispy Pork Belly Soft Omelette Gruyere Gouda Kewpie Amy's Roll    AND BREAD AMY'S  rest case  I am hopefully pork n' beans place taco place which yet try  BBQ fucking awful no idea place even business why they'd want them part new and upcoming attraction   The slides cool mostly because free  grassy patch area where bands play also free  But scared see much going cost *cool hip* barbershop  open  Yeesh   All all cool spot people walk around look stuff take kids  *is* glorified outdoor mall all   HOWEVER being said place meant cater LOCAL Las Vegas downtown er  far know living long most people work service work start up    which means enough money spend $20 lame ass sandwich beer plus tax tip  People don't Commonwealth reason why would want pay $10 BEER    OFF STRIP? What? thought left meatpacking district 3 000 miles behind me?  I'll probably come sit read book assuming don't constantly run into all 50 people know city because well where else go? but probably won't buy anything else any time soon  MAYBE taco cuz girl's gotta eat   Just true Vegas stop trying other places  making very very depressed   *****EDIT*****  Must apologize shop owners saying items overpriced  Should obvious fault but WHOEVER decided rent container park $9 sq ft! PRICE HEART MANHATTAN  am appalled deeply apologetic Las Vegas  You're next bubble cities in which its native residents suddenly be priced out of  send regards  <EOR> It great place but smaller thought  Upon entering park huge praying mantis sculpture circus performer while there  Admission free  few shops surrounding inside park few eateries well  also big treehouse children center park which daughter enjoyed awhile  tree also various slides different heights surrounding it  addition east container park best area security entrance within park your experience feel more secure   I say park great first step making downtown area more family friendly least some place downtown take your kids afternoon  <EOR> Lots fun all  Interesting concept turning old shipping crates into stores  big treehouse middle kids play hearts content  stage live music saw cool folk music duo  Only downside bit small  <EOR> Such great concept fits perfectly downtown  Greeted flame throwing preying mantis your attention grabbed right away  security gate checking ID's into park  suppose need 21 certain time but weren't saying much nothing posted  asked around looking shops some which closed open yet hard tell  play area middle kids far end stage concerts performers grassy area watch entertainers  Food clothing art some stores caught eye  Vapor shop entered  hope place does well cool idea  <EOR> What epic FAIL!!! 8 00pm close park 21 over only because want under age drinking  But serve alcohol all day when all kids here  idiots!!! course now 9pm its dead  <EOR> Conceptually place great  soft open walking into interior transports different place   pretty well planned space although heat see play structure becoming problem summer   few more decent shops see place being very popular  concept having few them pop shops although agree other reviewers few shops seem lacking real products  <EOR> Downtown Container Park latest East Fremont DTLV development   The concept solid Stack bunch shipping containers turn them into clothing art novelty shops    Include few food spots couple bars concert stage aesthetically impressive children's tree house play area   and set all part town where interest growing = 3 5 Stars!  I've twice since opened   Both times heading someplace else but group distracted Container Park felt compelled explore   The shops tend little overpriced   But  expected place this   just eaten both times came haven't tried any food here   aren't many drafts available bars inside but both options would appeal more discerning beer drinker   park closes those under 21 8pm 9pm great because packed Friday night   They appear wide variety music artists scheduled play   music great both times went      a true highlight group   Another big plus local aspect many shops   sure would come down specifically hangout   eat   and drink but great distraction between bar hopping! <EOR> Loved it   Ate some good food the chicken tortilla soup great margaritas even better   Contrary another post read thought jewelry cheap   definitely back grand kids  <EOR> I stopped Pork Beans Container Park wow food awesome! New Orleans many times found new home Cajun food Vegas!!!! <EOR> 5 stars effort creativity 3 stars quality stores   Now before everyone comes pitchforks giving 5 stars lemme finish   I LOVE concept   green provides community space downtown offers some non chain stores local population and no nail salons thank spaghetti monster    But honestly question longevity some stores   ridiculous amount fashion jewelry stores park   many them quality subpar Etsy store   Sorry sorry   However sure best survive we'll lose rest   Until then 4 stars  <EOR> Hipster version Town Square   The container park essentially 200 square foot re purposed containers stacked upon each other create outdoor shopping mall  Most units vacant during soft opening but am sure fill time passes  Many stores boutiques selling handmade clothing accessories snacks along few art galleries  Keep mind unlike other shopping areas won't find any franchise chain stores here  place excellent collection Mom n Pop style shops    small businesses ftw!  The park itself beautiful another great architectural addition downtown  giant fire breathing preying mantis greets entrance  centerpiece massive children's playground making Container Park great family friendly spot  outdoor stage shows grassy field going great summer shows flanked plenty bars drink at  atmosphere friendly park fun just run around explore   The Container Park must see any downtown trip really illustrates much whole DTLV scene evolving  <EOR> Thanks new businesses section Yelp found visited cool innovative spot downtown Las Vegas   I love idea using shipping containers businesses atmosphere relaxed friendly inviting   love casual laid back spot just couple blocks frenetic Fremont Street Experience   We wandered shops Downtown Container Park talked several owners workers   loved playset middle stage and lovely music coming it fire spewing praying mantis foam rubber building set     My husband kept saying need place Seattle    clearly great addition downtown Las Vegas   watching interest see Downtown Container Park  downtown Las Vegas general  evolve  <EOR> I excited see place all ever since seeing construction during Life Beautiful music festival  Wish open then Once saw on Instagram course Container Park open BF decided Sunday Funday night there    We came around 9pm greeted fire breathing grasshopper fronting Container Park's entrance    I immediately drawn lights trees add Christmas vibe   tis season afterall   Then love look stores restaurants containers  Container Park itself seems only fourth filled businesses    In middle see park similar Town Square's park BUT   and Big BUT there's fairly gigantic tree house middle slides them  Slides big kinda hurt boyfriend slide U turn  ***I just wonder if security really watching kids controlling down when*** In fact tree house tall scared more stairs because three stories tall   Along park there's stage next it  Perfect outdoor concerts!

The park really cool stage bands playing live music  Behind stage barber shop train  Such cool concept! also area front stage large foam lego pieces long sticks bouncy ball laying around random people would play take funny pics way  kind random large space taken few random things thrown ground literally  think items should placed playground area  Maybe more seating people sit relax while bands play?  I only assume type music changes since someone said play reggae music too  bad pretty emo low key very enjoyable date night  Unlike Fremont street plays music which encourages lots screaming dancing around just different scene  park saw many couples people dates  group people getting drunk rowdy looked kind place  great place people watch being said tables surrounding play area middle  can't sit tables heaters unless eat tables  can't just sit alcohol bar restaurant  saw security guard group tell them move because drinking sitting  Apparently ok if moved bench 3 feet away just can't sit tables drink  But guess sit drink since  did first bothered  am sure if guard picking people deal but ended buying popcorn just able sit there    My hubby beer guard didn't bother sitting alcohol  sign though says if sit need eat  later saw sitting while  did inside restaurants but assume size each restaurant store no dine seating majority restaurants  Also appeared everyone sitting outdoors eating Pork Beans restaurant  am all outdoor eating but kind expect less expensive food casual cafes but don't believe restaurants cheap  could wrong said did inside them just glanced over them walked by    I also liked music played throughout park speakers even if did sit near stage could enjoy music  love lights park store designs containers 5 stars fire breathing praying mantis!
