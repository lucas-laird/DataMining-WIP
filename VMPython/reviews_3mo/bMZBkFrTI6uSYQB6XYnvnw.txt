Overall great experience first timers ambiance quite amazing  Nothing but great things say place! <EOR> This review may little inside baseball some but hate anyway  review only comparing Fogo other Fogos because if don't already know Fogo awesome stage your life lost cause    1  Service main waiter little clueless he white Brazilian no idea pronounce anything rookie mistake but Gauchos very good  2nd meat come around Picanha but all outside pieces taken  told would wait he winked knowingly  then he brought EVERY Picanha over table first could outside piece  kind watering worthy Nobel Prize  Overall meat flowed continuously drinks refilled although water garbage def spring bottled sparkling Summerlin water borderline Waco water sides brought continuously    2  Food Most things measured pretty good things didn't quite meet top line fogo standards   Pao de queijo cheesy poofs  very thick dense large airy which prefer them clearly need work whoever making them it  Bottom Sirloin little light salt tastes  whole point meet salt  Beef Rib didn't see anyone else ask don't bring unless ask  result think sitting while long therefore kind dry  Picanha pretty good but some pieces fat still very white cooked  Limeade quite nailing these  Don't wrong still quite good but creamy frothy well established fogo some them very little lime taste say some drank 40 They also didn't seem Filet non garlic ribeye but lunch knows   Overall better strip fogo sure quite good best fogos ever but its 2 miles house prob eating every other day  <EOR> what say????? love! love! love everything Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse!!! i'll definitely back more!!!!!

Caipirinhas? Yes please keep them coming    Bottom sirloin?  Heck yes!  take 3 slices    Lamb chops?  OH FUCK YES!!  Leave whole freakin thing table!!!    No    control     whatsoever   If shady looking dude wearing hat musty  overcoat offered candy corn straight palm slightly dirty hand would say yes assume limited time promotion     Fogo de Chao vs Texas de Brazil high scoring draw  Sure few items other doesn't certain meats may slightly better over other but everyone ends winner fight no matter which choose  <EOR> Beautiful Venue      From moment entered staff very welcoming helpful   men bringing meat tables Brazil    Did catch name    He Excellent!   The meats all excellent     Two them really stood out    Filet tender delicious  Rib eye very best    Tender tasty juicy    They talk house specialty meat     ok but nothing compared Rib eye which absolute favorite    The harvest table wonderful selection salad bar type items plus more items which would typically find salad bar   beets very good Caesar salad   Asparagus jumbo size!
