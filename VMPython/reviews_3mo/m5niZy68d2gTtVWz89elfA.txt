YELLLPPERSSSS! gave fist bump  awesome that?   Now granted came 30 minutes before closing food took bit long backed actually ran some supplies Probably good sign! but kept updated status food sincere apologies    When food anxiously devoured them say damn good  First thing noticed off bat freshness ingredients specifically meat  Big thick piece Angus beef each slider interesting foray vegetables dressings  didn't really see anything menu other choice 6 7 sliders even hot prepared sides which wish had  having some sort fried potato leaves empty feeling although did chips sale    Overall love concept quality freshness ingredients boldness trendy entrepreneurs really would see them succeed  Add some more sides! <EOR> So read slider truck ended driving across town last night check out   Dude asked where we'd heard truck when said Yelp what's Yelpers! fist bump   Ordered pep pep pulled pork   Wow good slider!  Sometimes when order burgers other places all taste cheese bun meat but here   There's good balance ingredients sliders really tasty overall experience   Pricing $3 $5 two $7 three    I truck's vibe love comic style artwork truck   yourself favor check truck out! <EOR> Yay trucks good cheap food!

I've lived Vegas longer I'd admit biggest complaints lack Mom Pop restaurants street food   Fortunately more independent restaurants popping up   hope trend creeps into arena street delicatessens     Although don't typically eat red meat decided try Pulled Pork Pep Pep   Both amazing!  meat tender perfectly cooked   buns crisp all ingredients fresh!    I caught them outside Stussy near UNLV but sadly cut early due complaint Ferraro's restaurant manager   knew slider truck competing high end Italian restaurant     Will definitely back again  <EOR> I tried veggie sliders thought fantastic! can't friendly service receive which always everything taste better  only complaint didn't fryer working wasn't able try fries   Come back office soon Cirque du Soleil off paradise ! <EOR> Love guys came feed Yelp crew No Aids Walk  Sliders all advertised Pulled Pork knocked park  All say come early come often bring plenty napkins  P S  talk homemade frites spice coatings shaker bags  Hope letting any secrets  <EOR> Thank yelpers fantastic find   Would never experienced without guys    Cleanliness great service reasonable prices portions course fantastic food     Burgers available Barbie Pep pep pulled pork   All awesome  fav thus far Barbie smokey BBQ angus beef sizzling bacon melted cheddar bits jalepenos  Yum yum yum   Price 1 $3 2 $5 3 $7   All worth it     What food spot appealing well specials day   new burger going featured next? <EOR> I excited perplexed when heard Vegas' first gourmet food truck   spend lot time LA NYC way find favorite trucks check new ones   The slidin' thru truck decorated very cool comic book panel like   tracked down Bank America parking lot   few people but many more crew assembled meet spot   curious see if gourmet truck thing taken LA SF storm chance here   city such driving town many places where high density locals where truck would able park   Anyways     surprisingly big crew scrambling kitchen   truck clean appealing design   couldn't wait!  Unfortunately to   First 2 4 5 sandwiches serve   bummer   Once ordered though bummer even bummier   Took 10 15 minutes food   more cooks back customers?  gives?  friends before ordered still waiting well arrived parked perused menu ordered   Well if food killer worth thought I   Finally grub   Looked good   wasn't bad all just great   I'd rather drive through many In N Out outposts wait way parking lot just okay food     Bun little stale   Meat seasoned well but kinda dried out   obviously sand bagging patties back why did take long 3 cooks put together?  I really high hopes slider truck any future trucks take streets LVNV but just can't love because know good could  wasn't bad but lots good fast food burgers lot more convenient lot better   Give Fatburger any day over slidertruck   hate say it   really but definite meh     <EOR> YAY Vegas food truck likes those LA! Maybe don't need drive 4 hours food truck goodness = When found food truck Vegas through Twitter allllll itttttttttt!!!!! kinda hinted Slider Truck gonna slide thru day even though already ate full meal look anyways  did disappoint! THANK GAWD!!! lol  I Barbie Pep  unsure ingredients but ONOOOOOOOOOO = = = wish bought 2 each = WISH WISH WISH kalbi sliders but always next time SAMPS that!  The owner Ricardo really fun knew thru Twitter  telling you   all food trucks live through Twitter! fun owners him   customers always slide thru     ok ok enough slider puns p SAMPS SLIDER TRUCK!!!! <EOR> Checked website www slidinthru com location 5 minute drive strip headed meet them   The menu looked great ordered each!  also made some custom cheese lettuce sliders kids  favorites Kalbi Rib Captain's Order Barbie  But say veg also winner    buns perfect match grilled perfection      This best and far cheapest meal Vegas certainly blew away crappy lunch buffet strip   sliders many different restaurants around country far best! <EOR> Great food service but fall short other areas   The Barbie Pep Pep Pulled Pork all delicious $7 its just great value  Just enough fill lunch but enough dinner     Combine very friendly service only locally owned business would 5 star right? Nope some issues   First cinnamon fries $3 pricey get  disappointed see them use frozen Ore Ida  When your competition In N Out using potato cut store your using frozen potatoes just disappointing  just difference between frozen potatoes fresh ones  rather animal style fries some change left even though big supporter locally owned businesses    Another issue no idea offering certain day  might offering 6 regular items might only half menu available etc  Today when came only Barbie Pep Pep Pulled Pork  Lucky checked Twitter right before came   wanted other 3 didn't check Twitter before would disappointed  know everyone grandma smartphone but least considerate your non smartphone customers Lisa L  simple sign showing whats available day truck could easily fix this   The biggest issue place wait time  25 mins time ordering just ridiculous  could see 10 15 minutes but 25 minutes  5 people ahead which added another 10 15 minutes wait time before even order   time arrived till first bite 35 minutes  know isn't fast food but really? don't even think considered busy  Imagine bad would if actually busy  hope 1 hour spare because thats long you'll need  Now know why lines long     Great sliders but need work communication issues frozen fries wait time  Until then its worth driving way just sliders  <EOR> OK jumping bandwagon or slider truck case giving them 5 stars  finally chance check them other night  arrived little early crowd wasn't only idea  funny see several people waiting cars  would ever think slider truck would cause many people wait empty lot its arrival  wasn't sure ended getting 5 different sliders order sweet potato fries  Here's would rank them best pretty good 1  Pep Pep  love sauce  Thousand Island type sauce  added much depth beef onion bacon  2  Kalbi  wonderfully sweet taste but meat could bit more tender  3  Barbie  Love bbq sauce! 4  Yaya  feta tzatziki sauce patty good combo kinda gyro  5  Captain's Order  little overcooked  Compared other sliders just didn't same wow factor but still solid burger   The sliders bigger thought would be  patties thick 2 3 probably enough fill most people  Luckily wife kid help finish all five  Then course also sugar coated sweet potato fries which delicious  All only cost $15   best bargains you'll find anywhere city  Where else two adults eat satisfying meal $15? counting fast food chains because food far superior   I didn't chance try pulled porkie they all out but definitely track them down again another round  only best sliders town but burgers just good if better many upscale burger joints around  <EOR> all say slider raw    rare   RAW   as see picture posted   http www yelp com biz_photos m5niZy68d2gTtVWz89elfA?select=s2lFOGdAkXSyGH9ZJLvsEw  also waited 45 mins it    granted food cooked order but if everyone getting sliders if there's long line why cook extra patties??
