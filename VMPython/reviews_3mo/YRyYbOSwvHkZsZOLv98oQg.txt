I think most expensive restaurants strip first off   Next food very plain extremely salty especially fish  Since fish based upon need say much more  portions pay very small example being Milos special  $30 bit Zucchini eggplant   NYC location gotten pretty decent reviews decided patronize place based upon that  $300 later wished not   you better value almost good food place Red Lobster seriously  <EOR> My wife parents restaurant last night dinner  possibly most expensive restaurant Cosmopolitan   We reservations arrived time  friendly employee said wait few minutes table ready suggested wait bar  hung near bar area but weren't interested drink  only wait two minutes not bad  nice seat looked menu  list entrees very small  small because lot fish choices separate raw bar menu  menu deceptively small   fish market set which your server check fish shellfish resting crushed ice  Most fish run $50 pound average 3 pounds  whole fish sharing norm restaurant  grilled branzino they called something else which incredible grilled octopus appetizer possibly best dish ever had anywhere! good   That being said am only giving restaurant 3 stars because Lobster Pasta shared  $120 serving two better fantastic  wasn't  don't think Macaroni Grill offers Lobster Pasta but if did would better this! Estiatorio Milos needs spruce Lobster Pasta dish immediately remove menu  A nice balcony fairly good view  Looks great dinner party  As expensive four people ran $150 per person  OUCH! Top Ramen while! <EOR> First all Cosmopolitian most beautiful casinos Las Vegas  first night town wife decided try Estatorio Milos  concept high end Mediterranean seafood    Truly amazing  encourage family style sharing everyone  started off Milos Special which pan fried zucchini eggplant tzatziki sauce saganaki cheese around outside  Next Most amazing Octopus ever  meal ended perfectly salt crusted Sea Bass best fish ever had  complimented perfectly Greek tomato salad server recommended it  experience ended Baklava Yogurt Honey top   Overall would say entire experience knockout! new concept exciting even Vegas  service great ambiance   Reading reviews below seems mad necessary adjustments service  prices fairly high but on par rest Vegas  all fly fish everyday Greece! <EOR> The low ratings Yelp really dont justice place  Xmas eve  left happy customer  Sharing all plates way go  3 table paid around $88 per person tip included     We ordered 2 appetizers grilled scallops mushrooms plate  Both fantastic  side dish tomato salad fete cheese  main course fish market fish  Cannot remember name sucker however big meaty fresh delicious    I really enjoyed feast concept Milos  Also being new Cosmopolitan very attractive  <EOR> We Milo's Sunday before Christmas   Its incredibly expensive horrible   Essentially gastronomic torture   should note weren't looking crazy expensive special dinner   probably problem   done night before Okada which 5 star awesome usual   First service horrible   took forever anybody's attention drinks appetizers meal   Second place $$$   just 5 choices entrees all $48+   lobster ravioli 2 $120 market price fish 3 meat entrees all $48 $68     For wine maybe 2 3 options red below $100   ordered $60 Duckhorn Merlot waiter sneered great value choice sir  insulting hear him   The appetizers OK 45 minutes when finally came     We ordered lobster pasta   3 4 honestly felt sick stomachs afterwards nauseous     Anyway it   If your life's desire Milos ahead   Otherwise give them some time place par   way many other good restaurants Vegas   Maybe fish great   don't know didn't try it   guy comes over your table spends 15 minutes picking bones hunched over tableside   If  your thing give try <EOR> Definitely worth trying once if twice!  If your significant other likes seafood would definitely recommend Estiatorio Milos date night restaurant try   Classy layout presentation Delicious food but addicting would become regular  inside new Cosmopolitan Hotel! The restaurant itself looks cozy outside but quite spacious once stepping inside   waiters forced wear ridiculous blue checkered tablecloth like shirts bright yellow ties which friends agreed need changed something sleeker   Despite outfits incredibly personable friendly knowledgeable   Some $$$$ restaurants snooty waiters feel intimidated uncomfortable but did vibe all here   waiter attentive food served timely fashion hardly any lag time all during meal     Before ordering given mini tour fish display allow decide which fish wanted order   rare fish display see American restaurant course took picture front haha   waiter helped pick fish based kind flavors consistency wanted  We Lavraki fattier more flavorful sea bass For appetizers ordered Milos Special Paper thin zucchini eggplant fried crispy served tzatziki sauce graviera cheese saganaki which really well battered fried prepared   zucchini eggplant well complemented fried cheese yogurt   ate 10 seconds   also ordered tomato salad simply because craving tomatoes   salad delicious but nothing spectacular   also considered ordering 3 lb  whole fish because prized menu item The Lupe de Mare cooked sea salt order keep fish juicy possible  cooked fish finished hand picked sea salt Kythira Island extra virgin olive oil capers  fish served whole table guests share but decided 3 lbs  maybe bit much fish since ordering many sides   opted 2 5 pound fish instead   fish really amazing grilled some olive oil lemon pepper whatever else it   flavor delicate light could still taste flavor fish itself which find common America   Americans seem love fish doused butter sauces sometimes can't tell if eating fish chicken   But fish light rich flavor friends agreed worth getting again   Plus skin grilled point perfection crispy but still greasy fatty   Along fish ordered sides brussels sprouts spinach   Both great  <EOR> Was expensive?  Yes   seafood awesome?  Yes   back again eat more amazing food there?  Yes!  service good?  Absolutely   Definitely talk guys behind oyster bar find recommend   ate some best oysters ever restaurant    The salt crusted grilled fish ask them recommend killer! Save few weeks enjoy some best seafood Vegas  <EOR> In nutshell 5 walk given tour indoor fish market Greek Woody Harrelson talks into ordering two separate fish  Sashimi platter presented sushi chef eat best tuna ever eaten  45 minutes bottle wine later salt crusted fish camera worthy tastes delicious    I can't tell bill because blocked memory out  <EOR> dined Milos new Cosmopolitan Hotel 2 5 UFC fights   late dinner 10 15 reservation    When party 9 arrived short delay being seated but nothing close wait next door STK night before maybe 15 mins tops   The waiter took orders promptly but  when problem began   took almost 45 mins calimari tomato salad   hour half later told them leaving without having entrees   waiter stammered restaurant being busy we only handful tables left occupied restaurant midnite nowhere near full when arrived    waited couple minutes two orders fish rib eye arrive   Since wanted club sooner later inhaled entrees bailed   The manager involved took 20% off tab but damage done   Btw fish forgot which two ordered very tasty   rib eye way below average   rib eye ordered medium delivered very well done   order Lamb ordered well done arrived very rare guess chef just couldn't bear  serve well done but what's excuse overcooking rib eye? <EOR> My girlfriend visited Milos Saturday night   Cosmopolitan extremely crowded very big casino respect other casinos around town   We walked without reservations   average wait time around 45 minutes   ended sitting very nice tables bar   tables true dining tables your standard bar tables might find most restaurants   We ordered crab cakes wine lobster the spiny kind fillet   lobster definitely wasn't worth price nearly $200 per lobster but steak easily best while   wine good crab cakes fresh fantastic   The atmosphere Milos Cosmo unparalleled   easily most upscale trendy casino all Vegas   Milos exceptionally decorated   quite pricey though   bill ended near $350 two but well worth cost such lavish experience  <EOR> Went Milos last night friends celebrate birthday   First hour late seating we reservations 8 30pm    When did seated waiter took drink order didn't return least 45 min   ordered appetizers calimari tomato salad which tasted wonderful but took forever those well   Two hours ordering dinner finally ate but only friends made complaint   salmon shared fried potatos greens   ok but definitely worth price wait   I'd skip it  <EOR> I Vegas friend's 30th birthday over Valentine's Day weekend  she Greek she hadn't visited Cosmopolitan yet she thought sure bet eat Estiatorio Milos dinner    Not much   We didn't seated until almost hour reservation restaurant continually telling table being set   If hostess just said hey running behind  Why don't drink bar? would more happy so  Instead when seated all starving all all tipsy  glass wine would good relaxant prepare coming next    The restaurant brought bread but no water  whole table starving trying eat dry bread no water choking  No menus  No silverware  Getting glass wine took 40 minutes every time  countless service frustrations member party asked speak manager  She then repeated request several more times throughout meal server  manager did ever present himself during meal  end tracked down recounted service ordeal he guy complained earlier told he sommelier   He never did apologize end trying explain issues waste breath  weren't looking reduction bill  just wanted sorry  unacceptable  The only saving grace restaurant food  divine  ordered 2 roasted fish es? bunch sides salads appetizers  octopus snapper beets goat cheese really stood out  also enjoyed tomato salad simple delicious  Some people table ordered seared tuna which apparently impressive whole roasted fish  11 dinner did order bottles wine but did few glasses bill $1400  Ouch    The space beautiful Cosmopolitan  service horrible ruin your evening  No matter good food never return restaurant  cannot reward such bad behavior return trip  When people paying more $100 per person dinner expect treated least little bit respect  <EOR> A group 11 Saturday night ruined Estiatorio Milos  Half Greek very excited try Vegas's new Greek offering  eaten New York location years ago remember excellent food service  arrived promptly 8 30 reservation told table process being set up   Fifteen minutes later yet called ignored when approached hostess stand  9 00 again told table being set up  should left point  Numerous other patrons also complaining being seated late reservations  Finally 9 30 shown table without slightest apology  Someone promptly brought bread table but didn't even water menus until asked them over 5 minutes later  trend whole dinner  service total disaster  order messed food took eternity glasses often empty  whole fish sides very good but certainly worth hefty price tag   French fries $15 order we needed 3 orders table Greek tomato salad $27 TINY!!! tuna good cut fresh but very bland  Dinner drinks ended being $100 per person  Three half hours later finished left bad taste mouths  No seemed all concerned bad experience restaurant  <EOR> Terribly disappointing restaurant going such high hopes especially perusing menu learning chef   When you're paying kind money dinner first foremost expect minimum good service realistically service should superior   Milos delivered worst service wife experienced restaurant price point   Not seeing your server 15 minutes getting seating first clue   credit wife suggested leave but foolishly wanted stick out   Eventually server arrived visibly frazzled edgy   He blew through menu specials he being timed race   never received bread though felt hit lottery when assistant sommelier took care pouring wine because knew server would not   To left gentleman send back undercooked steak then flag down server check   right woman demanded new server asked manager   Salt wound     some reason didn't replace server   To show Milos discriminates against no server also serving Cosmo CEO guest   could tell he receiving end same treatment   And perfect cherry Greek sundae awfulness     way wife met two women restroom also complaining service worst they've experienced  Oh guess should say something food   Terribly overpriced stone crab claws w bland sauce though quite fresh    wife's oysters superb Milos special tasty   same fish main course   found decent but hardly worth price overly salty sauce   both fish full bones though they're supposed de boned   didn't stick around dessert because already over two hours   The atmosphere disappointing well   Incredibly loud bright inside absolutely romantic environment if  you're thinking seeking     Milos your act together quickly   ever know because never return  <EOR> The service very good    This first dining experience Cosmo food just OK   I guess expecting little something extra when paying $50 lb fish  waiter said normally fish dishes meant shared family style    I recommend Hortopites appetizer  Anything wrapped phyllo dough win me  wild greens feta cheese other goodies wrapped crispy little delicious package  really delicious   Also baklava AMAZE!  At end meal satisfied  However could just stop thinking could same tasting meal local Greek restaurant much cheaper  <EOR> The food amazing bar amazing  but service sucked  took forever seated despite calling first room sure reservation indeed secured  only seated bc mad staff asked why someone else getting seated before when specificaly asked beforehand seated around 8pm  if service good would gotten 5 stars  fish expensive too  3 lb fish serves 2 people  look spend $50 lb fish  greek salad amazing Fresh feta cheese dont even greek salad! <EOR>
