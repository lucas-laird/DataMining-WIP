The burger   Although brother's good give rating based food mainly burger needed help   think probably consistency thing however major problem   Once while food perfect   What would place 5 stare?  I'd hard time making 5 star joint which nothing its food but its marketing   think 5 star joint top its particular field   Wine 5 actually sits between two types upscale diner breakfast place   Since top former can't give full 5   But  just play ratings game     Bottom line Great menu fresh variety something everyone   definitely back see if give fourth star    <EOR> This place great going dinner friends! decor inviting super quint  wait staff very friendly never neglected table  ordered appetizer sampler platter chicken tacos spicy chicken wings good  no idea spices used but delicious  platter also came southwest egg rolls which would order meal itself    cojita salad which huge portion but little but much dressing me  boyfriend Salmon Ruben which piled perfectly cooked Salmon fillet I don't even fish but Salmon! we're way full order dessert but choices very tempting    definitely returning try other things menu really want try breakfast menu well  <EOR> I dont usually give 5 stars anything but place deserves it  drunken frito misto hope spelled right platter amazing appetizer  its says serves 2 but could easily serve 3  but just everything else portions HUGE   salmon ruben entree great  thought salmon rueben would odd but wasnt all  sandwich tasty remoulade cooked cabbage wasn't usual sour kraut alot restaurants put ruebens  salmon cooked perfect juicy rye bread buttery crispy delicious  Overall decore cute thoughtful even place relatively small place feels big open giant glass windows see right into kitchen service professional all servers wear ties white dress shirts italian bistro style friendly never felt abandoned food portions gigantic everything seems made scratch very fresh tasting  guess bottom line wont leave disappointed hungry thats sure  <EOR> A nice place eat   Great food service   menu unique creative  owner really cares family owned business shows   glad places still exist amidst glut food chains  <EOR> The place cute service friendly but very very slow   Wednesday 7pm expecting place busy   wonder if senior early bird special don't know about   restaurant quite full older crowd live entertainment consisted guy singing keyboard both retirement age playing songs 50s   crowd seemed enjoying themselves  I disappointed menu   most intriguing thing saw Nairobi City tacos   ordered Ahi Tuna portions huge   But tuna overcooked chewy   served pice de gallo which tasted more unseasoned canned tomatoes me   wasn't much flavor entire dish guacamole sauce very pale green tasted avocado stretched bit far  I would recommend unless enjoy bland food  <EOR>
