Maybe made wrong choice between Sage Julian Serrano Aria   We made reservations same day chick desk front restaurant  Nice decor wine bottles all deceivingly huge    Anyways walked through lounge front restaurant seated back  Spacious very spacious high ceilings mirrors weird murals  mural referring left first enter back dining room  didn't understand why even restaurant painting farmers kind purple ish    Our server ok maybe trained promote more food needed order  Menu items range prices $15 $40 per entree  upon ordering entree server asks would start? ?? she meant pick another dish another area menu if came entree  Nope  She made sound included  ordered gnocchi soft pasty brussel sprouts radish cobia which all great  fish nice seared crust but it  Kind bland medium tenderness nothing special it  Mashed potato thinned didn't much good flavor  chowder sauce poured dish nothing chowder unless chowder watery  felt dining Top Chefs now understand harsh critique  But am no Padma   For dessert ordered beignets caramel sauce tiny bits apples  cute because doughnut sticks fancy applesauce  could probably better using krispy kreme doughnuts mott's applesauce   They don't listen  sommelier asked if wanted keep wine menu replied yes yet he took away? When given option pick bread wood case requested sourdough he gave bacon  WTF? if allergic bacon? Although say bread fancy butter good least when warm  Oh when meal over waitress handed check  wrong   about $300  wrong  She apologized profusely but still c'mon  huge difference  only good thing she brought complimentary orange infused hot chocolate  shot end meal    It's can't appreciate fine dining experience but nothing fine it  Actually water boy great  He made point keeping glasses full without splashing water all over place because he shielded pour cloth napkin  Nice  dine again  <EOR> 2 5 stars   Now may 100% true but judging previous review saw if asian escorted back restaurant   When arrived quite empty but kindly taken rear room which sectioned off behind cash registers some decor   old couple chinese family soon another asian family another asian couple joined back   noticed fairly strange when finished eating checked other guests suspicions confirmed   However should note non asian couple seated back when busier   As restaurant decor nice pork loin tastes ham but now perhaps since new chef gives complimentary foam grapefruit amuse appetizer citrus infused hot cocoa drink finish your meal which nice along bacon bread which adds 1 2 star   Also service very attentive timed quite well lot care taken keeping table tidy which adds another star however we're just left bad taste mouth feeling discriminated against   if asian prepare party others back  <EOR> Being fan tasting menus small tiny portions admit Sage very good     We seated lounge area ASIANS front there's no racial profiling going duh? previous reviewer    terms service attended bar attendants manager   Bar server offered services wasn't sure why seated lounge  but told he'll every attempt give great service   blast him!
