Restaurant insanely large  Looks nice inside very clean  seemed some sort buffet toward rear massive section dining rooms in    One worst pizzas ever had  slab floppy cardboard sheet plasticy cheese  Chewy crust flavorless sauce  certainly downed entire pie because 11 sheets wind but entire time trying wrap mind around why anyone would seek restaurant when Vegas  However beer special surprisingly good $3 Modelos though  Can't even buy beer liquor seller Strip much!  Service good  waiter very attentive friendly  Dig that Food also came fast thought restaurant nearly empty Sunday night  But even solid service can't dismal cuisine    <EOR> So actually but wanted leave review Cynthia Diaz sales coordination She FANTASTIC deal with!!! many questions when booking rehearsal dinner she provided TONS info!!  ALMOST signed contract until grooms family involved wanted somewhere closer hotel staying considering older people party cannot walk far Buca di Beppo going 35 minute walk   Regardless amazing sales packages SUPER fair well priced     am saddened able use services but HIGHLY recommend them any sort party!!  rehearsal dinner 100 people under $6K rarely heard of!! <EOR> Very disappointed  Thinking restaurant Bally's Hotel connected Bucca di Peppo chain  But    totally different  even mood complain  Just want file official complain  Bottom line avoid visit other restaurant Las Vegas  Even cheap Favors Buffet better it  <EOR> Well first time place never really know expect Italian  restaurant  breakfast   But Girlfriend  mother law took chance  Everything  excellent  start finish   hostess  bestes  wish name could give some kudos review buca around 10 00 AM   server best ever attitude  amazing  could tell he loved job happy where    Randy if way sure time Buca time  remember   boy    The food outstanding loved fresh fruit French Toast tip hat chief   I can't stress enough  good professional  server randy   He way above  expectations never server good   family definitely  returning  recommending buca friends family  <EOR> Called your ballys restaurant week reservation specific waiter husband first date  anniversary  tonight only told waiter isn't working tonight  Hostess very rude disrespectful  Way ruin special night  Won't ever back <EOR> This review solely buffet dinner  regular Buca few dozen times  buffet offering if very strange place  very mediocre set offerings surrounding excellent piece Prime Rib made four star review  Italian offering which good decent desert  prime rib skip everything else but desert  <EOR>
