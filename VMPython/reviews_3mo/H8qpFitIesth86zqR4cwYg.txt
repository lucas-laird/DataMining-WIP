I don't know much candy pastries although place does boast awe inspiring chocolate fountains Bellagio does certainly large lounge area interesting bizarre but very attractive designs architecture inlays    I need speak more crepes but they're so  good  can't stress enough  Yes you're probably over paying few bucks but probably shouldn't all time anyway your cholesterol sake     Vegas!  Delicious crepes friendly staffers lots room chill  Perfect vastly improvement needed Aria  <EOR> One thing sure couldn't asked much more selection  Seems something everyone  all looks fresh good too  Mine sure   Lotsa tasty Gelato choices!!  Friendly service Resonable prices considering location  <EOR>
