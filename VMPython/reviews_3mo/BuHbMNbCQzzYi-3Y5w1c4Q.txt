The quality same Southern California  lemonade perfect  Double Char Burger works juicy taste hint char overpowering  fries cooked perfectly golden onion fries crisp but onion inside just right   The closest St  George Utah thank God they've opened Las Vegas add sprinkles icing speak walk away work Howard Hughes Center!  Now if open near Mountain's Edge Southwest Las Vegas I'd heaven  <EOR> I saw ad Habit many years ago really wanted try it  few years ago coming back weekend Zion having lunch Chilis disappointed see The Habit located right freeway entrance! missed chance try out  no Habits Las Vegas area until now open Flamingo Paradise near Las Vegas Strip  took Lana saturday lunch tiny line walked in  dining area bit small 12 small booths large maybe 12 seat long table sit eat  small outside dining area but Las Vegas heat full force no thanks! Prices bad several burgers choose from  regular no cheese fries drink combo $7 change  Lana mushroom burger onion rings drink total less $20 around $17 dollar mark think is   very good being close world famous tourist destination  When ordering knew exactly wanted but kind dance order because can't just speak order taker quick point sentence  Seems questions ask if just order kind messes routine  Next time just let them ask want answer them  If dance let them lead  hungry robot master programer  Kind Soup nazi episode Seinfeld let them ask then answer  ha ha! When finished give those light joy buzzers when your order ready  some hot yellow chili peppers drinks right  Strawberry Lemonade cucumbers delicious but also normal selection soda's too  2 small booths towards back but today guess managers black shirts looked those seats office doing something laptop computer  Maybe where work? didn't really see office area them use  Kind odd since people looking place sit  The staff working hard counted 10 people grill area 2 3 ladies front why need many people back don't know but busy ants doing best  Soon buzzer alerted burgers  kind small side remember ad saw many years ago seemed burgers thicker larger  First bite tell good burger  didn't really detected nice charred taste but sure ain't no Mc Doodoos  Very fresh simple liked alot  fries standard onion rings both cooked order soggy  Very good  There service lady came around still eating she really wanted take tray away but finished yet tell done yet  Then when finished few minutes later almost trashed dumped into trash when lady came over she wanted tip tray rest way let take hands thanked her  Overall very good classic burger place salads chicken sandwichs think  No drive though since located middle building but fast nice burger  <EOR> Best Burger Sandwich place   I came Charburger but fell love Sandwich  Fresh Albacore sandwich side sweet potato fries!   Service awesome! friendly associate opened door welcomed right away  order taken just few quick minutes  food soon after  <EOR> So excited Habit finally landed Vegas! Took week find location opened! always sure visit Habit when visit California but no longer need that!   I always order mushroom char because love anything mushroom! bf double char just delicious  meat tender just locations Cali  opinion no other fast food places compare quality serve here    Will coming back whenever feel bit naughty diet  <EOR> My first visit pretty good son dinner Saturday night  Almost every table filled  ended getting burger combo meals single w cheese double w cheese   substituted onion rings fries  Those pretty crispy well done come ranch dressing  burgers themselves pretty good nothing really memorable them though  Just seemed your everyday run mill type burger  We'll probably back if come way  <EOR> Hey now  Three stars means A OK okay? habit coming again again? Probably not  When subconscious craving burger first second even third choice? No   I debated between 3 4 star rating because realistically 3 5* book  said some pretty stiff competition burger scene Las Vegas   While customer service cleanliness efficiency receiving food despite being busy A+ food just lacked oomph   Items tried Santa Barbara style description alone sounded burger would like   It double char burger cheese avocado grilled sourdough  love avocado but all tasted  No other notes anything shining through  No crack sauce  $5 95    Teriyaki char pretty good taste overall! There's sauce looking for  salty sweet just right  upsets teeny tiny pineapple was  pineapple flat thin dry  guess only positive use fresh pineapples because irregular shape poorly cut portion  definitely your standard pineapple ring can  feel guilty even wishing those canned pineapple rings burger  think bigger juicier pineapple would elevated flavor burger  $3 45 + cheese $0 55   Albacore tuna filet sandwich prepared medium  sandwiches choice bread French roll grilled sourdough wheat bun  only sampled since husband's order  really good! fishy all  more impressed sandwich burgers  $6 95   Tempura green beans different but good! neat way eat your veggies  kid enjoyed one  $2 95  Mocha shake consistency off  little more chocolate y expected  regret trying coffee shake instead  $3 25  Beware corporate lunch crowd  pretty busy    Healthier options include lettuce wrapped burger AKA protein style veggie burger six different salads    Looking try more sandwiches future visits  <EOR> Just first Habit burgers understand name! Heard good friends them state game  Hubs double char teriyaki burger combos  food ready 5 10 minutes came piping hot exactly it! want nearly burn mouth food eating many lukewarm meal while raising children! Habit did disappoint! staff very friendly  approached several helpful employees offering services  only negative thing say actually fault  address Hughes Center Drive but actually NW corner Flamingo Paradise facing Flamingo  Google maps bit goose chase  Now found them easy way back even across town  gladly trek! FIVE STARS! <EOR> Nothing seemed fresh    Everything premade frozen taste it  impressed Pretty positive veggie burger frozen morning star burger  Ahi sushi grade white fresh pink purple  <EOR> Customer service sucks called pick order 10 people asked can't take order over phone place order THEN come back pick when ready  serious please tell difference takes away purpose pick order!
