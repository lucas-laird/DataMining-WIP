I'm sure though why made restaurant area large because Gameworks usually arcade first restaurant second  multiple locations around country all them much much larger gaming area restaurant  restaurant also ton wasted space could've used accommodate games doesn't feel cramped inside when you're playing  only thing restaurant TVs projector screens all around  great place watch sports!  The games themselves decent although whole lot seemed spark interest  Most them pretty expensive costing approximately 7 12 credits  Each credit 25 cents unless buy large dollar amounts such $50 100   Overall Gameworks Town Square good place hang kill some time but wouldn't place I'd visit frequently  <EOR> Sad attempt bring back once cool place    Boo games over priced same games $108 00 rip off  need Dave Busters    <EOR> **Birthday Party Review** We sons birthday today  would HIGHLY recommend Gameworks venue your next party  While agree other reviewers food leaves great deal room improvement party packages service more it  guests wonderful time host Zach greatest! booked party mostly email Allie she pleasure work with  If looking party venue highly recommend! <EOR> What happened GameWorks?  understand changes moving Strip   But expectations much higher   walk into new location almost seems empty   lot square footage but enough games fill space     I am gamer   But enjoy sports driving flying games   bit selection but seemed could've much more     My experience okay but don't see myself coming back anytime soon   I hope time GameWorks able something near Strip location was  <EOR> Fun enjoyable   Bar bowling games!  Had blast price drink fair but games find little pricey but great place!  Sweet girl bartender bowling aisle gentlemen bowling area! <EOR> Took grandson 7th birthday  5 year old also us  Lots games including room full computers XBox Playstation set ups  rollercoaster simulator really fun  restaurant bar friendly staff members  Typical bar food but ok  walk around whole place your beer cocktail  don't think need such large dining area  <EOR> Way overpriced  happened walking thought we'd take niece inside play some games  bought card credits before noticed price game  average games 9 credits! 1 credit equals 1 quarter games average $2 25! Never coming back again  <EOR> GameWorks back town am happy  much gamer myself but coming brings inner kid me  take place   Location love new location Town Square compared old location strip  below AMC movie theatre across Yard House  close bunch good bars restaurants  few Yard House Capriotti's Mcfaddens Sugar Factory    Interior When walk front doors service station your left seating area also seating exterior if prefer that  bar 20ft front door  bar average size good selection alcohol ordered jack coke Malibu mix drink both $6  bad  Then decent selection arcade games various other gaming machines variation air hockey which would throw 20 mini discs once now fun intense  glow dark pool table area bowling lanes which did try but next time   Staff bar staff good  hipster looking white male made feel home explained changes new menu helped when needed  short hispanic male bar area didn't seem much sure if he manager but he rude staff extremely bossy  staff ticket counter good helped correct amount points card machine error   We back soon try glow dark things drinks $2 cheaper Mcfaddens which upstairs  <EOR> Cons  Kinda pricey limited floor space games  restaurant area looks incredibly mundane bland  honestly think whoever designed place having indentity crisis   just feel don't know wanna be     Pros  couple decent games  son 6 he impressed! Lol staff nice helpful  Well ventilated all people inside     Overall needs work needs more floor games still something take kids town cant   If gets better def come back <EOR> Before continue would say review regarding only arcade portion GameWorks  hearing everyone's excitement new GameWorks opening seeing sign posted inside TownSquare over year thought place going spectacular  definitely let down    First all space games just small  could run through them all just couple hours  if chance play them all  always crowded many people sometimes you'll find parents just taking chairs games watch children play   Second only cards points extremely overpriced arcade but self help kiosks don't even work when inform employees ticket counter just shrugged said never work    This brings another point lot games ALREADY broken! Why pay much money all points if everything shut down? Ridiculous   Lastly if your children play enough games earn enough points certain prize want don't let them excited  couple friends spent just enough money win enough tickets LEGO pillow they've eyeing while  soon reached 1 500 ticket mark redeem prize  Then employees told them don't even LEGO pillows stock  Though few different colors them hanging walls   I wish could just open reasonably priced arcade  now sticking Pinball Hall Fame  <EOR> Friday night fourth fifth time stopped Gameworks  way home work meet friends occasionally  always great time   Whether playing games friends bowling hanging bar fun   staff always friendly helpful   food yummy especially chicken nachos bartenders lot fun especially chick skull tattoo  Check out  sure play Pacman air hockey game crazy  <EOR> I'm only giving place 3 because selection games significantly decreased since movement Las Vegas strip    I still however love environment  reminds more Dave Buster's establishment bar restaurant available right inside  You're able reserve parties which perfect groups birthdays  If you're hard core gamer might arcade since selection games limited  But if your just fun family games it'll experience whomever want bring    Service really top notch always  So sure enjoy your time My review more arcade portion establishment   everything else gets 4 star rating  <EOR> Prepare dissapointed! Ooh Vegas gotta stay away if want wait your food wait your drinks keep waiting service place be! star service 2nd star earned because there's fun stuff you're done waiting lol  place wasn't even crowded would expect think because word place already 8 50pm eat way past dinner rush popular 6 7 30 dinner rush  half hour meal drinks could finished half time just spent much time waiting  Gary Z preordered next drink because first drink took half hour first lol  least 35 min even take order food  2 5 star establishment reason people! Don't your hopes just because reopened  <EOR> I never GameWorks sure expecting    It unlike other gaming lounges don't integrate gaming food bar areas very well  defined bar restaurant area pretty much empty every time ever passed through then small gaming floor mixture ticketed gaming machines kids other video game machines    I think if spread area bit more would more room move around enjoy games  overly crowded weren't many games looked worth time money play  only ones did packed long waits   There many improvements could made better  <EOR> Was recently  issue old card  Chad fixed right up!!! great time  Thanks help Chad!!!  If gamer must check out  happy re opened Vegas  Great location town square!!! BLAST !!!!!!! <EOR> This place great discounts drinks appetizers most likely drive business  $3 50 wells beers such Stella Artois win! friends ordered nachos but didn't look liked them much  Bartender others saying did seem slower    In terms arcade venue space massive seems devoted much room restaurant opposed adding more games possibly bigger bowling alley more lanes  did check LAN setup next time! <EOR> I don't new gameworks! Aside fact lost points old gameworks decided give second chance  Very pricey  Boring games!  One photo booth extremely pricey!  The price redemption area kind cool its little shop huge improvement technology actual bowling but miss old school side all n_n    Didnt even try bar people tending ignored husband dismissed <EOR> Like location way better old one  need more games bring down price them  Most important Kids great time! <EOR>
