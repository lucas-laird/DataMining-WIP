So fast food dinner two kids came $41 37  quite worth it  Would rather pay much less In'N'Out Fatburger sit nicer place Bachi Burger similar pricing    Food good  back try custard concrete desserts  But said live hype  If then 3 star rating mind maybe you'll enjoy more did  <EOR> Never thought I'd find burger likes better then n but place it  Great meat potato roll NY  Very attentive staff  Fries great drinks ample  back but probably during week avoid crowd many kids <EOR> It's ok    bit pricey   Skip cranberry lemonade!  just concentrate tastes it   better burger 5 guys Out   But beef all natural w hormones  Fries just ok too    bad    great  Whah whah <EOR> My boyfriend tried place tonight  food pretty good burger fries liked both them  But few hours eating sick pretty obvious now food poisoning  usually hesitant pointing finger when comes food poisoning but boyfriend looked reviews noticed two other customers already mentioned undercooked food people getting sick  think safe say something isn't par food making customers sick   ***Update***  My boyfriend pissed getting sick he started researching Shake Shack found quite few disturbing articles related food poisoning including one http seekingalpha com article 3147046 could be shake shacks worst nightmare  The article explains Shack cooks burgers medium versus well done which greatly increases risk spreading food borne illnesses consumers  saying Shack doesn't obey all laws regulations but believe why myself many others getting sick something people should know before deciding eat there  <EOR> Wanted see all hype about   burger very good   meat rough grind which love very flavorful   crinkle cut fries favorite type fry all fries crispy   dogs Vienna brand always delicious   shakes awesome   only complaint could give size burgers small side pricey   Maybe because burgers all natural Angus beef freshly ground  antibiotic free  <EOR> Great selection Burgers drinks shakes floats etc  highly recommend  <EOR> It's nice Shake Shack neighborhood! love Shake Shack but crazy impressed either   Food great! 'Shroom burger vegetarian option crispy juicy portobello patty  vegetables taste fresh there's gooey melty cheese oozes take bites your palm sized burger  Some may find size relatively small but think healthy portion   A burger side fries milkshake good combination satisfy average sized person! If portion any bigger would feel unhealthily full! Psst! know exactly talking about! just hit truck feeling gorging junk food! side note love cheese but definitely prefer fries without it  If review based food alone I'd give solid 5 stars!  Now why 4 5? Well put off customer service which indeed essential prime dining experience  place just opened understand need work some kinks but didn't enjoy atmosphere place either  walls absorb enough sound noise levels little high sensitive ears pales comparison more spacious Strip location  reasons why 4 star overall rating me   Also! noticed others mentioning price    expected accepted Shake Shack before understand needs maintain image more upscale fast casual restaurant which also explains trendy industrial decor     Overall Shake Shack definitely choice burger treat! always take burger outside nice little patio <EOR> Not impressed  husband looking forward trying restaurant since opened Vegas but just haven't made over New York New York location Strip  When opened Summerlin first day lunch  line long but employees great  informative very helpful but food quality fair best  both ordered cheeseburgers split cheese fries  food served quickly hot but just blah  burger no flavor  bun toasted also flavorless  Neither finished burger because unimpressive  fries bit better but would much rather n Five Guys  Probably return food quality lacking  <EOR> After all hype disappointed  servers nice decor nice burger tasty   but baby size?

Try classic cheeseburger some cheese fries IPA  truly cannot wrong combination  Some compare fries In an Out  think Shake Shack wins hands down  would take fries every day    The frozen custard only thing could've improved on  didn't think mine best terms presentation taste  But prior experience Shake Shack won't influence rating that!  There tons parking Downtown Summerlin  may walk bit but worth it  nice little patio well!   Will keep coming back! <EOR> Yum!  Love new hangout downtown Summerlin   only thing haven't really cared French Fries   Five Guys place those' <EOR> I love Shake Shack! glad LV location doesn't require down strip  thing don't understand all people compare place 'N Out  different price points different levels quality completely different business models  just don't it    I love Shake Shack's Smokeshack burger delicious  bit pricey but flavor amazing  crinkle cut fries great  usually hate crinkle cut fries theirs actual first ones tried like! wines beers tap pretty good and pretty skeptical seasonal salted caramel hot chocolate amazing  am super picky hot chocolate no way hell would drink chemical tasting packaged crap theirs good    The service location great  even comped fries before burger no reason  food comes pretty fast restaurant including bathroom very clean everything location better going down strip! <EOR> Ok but really dont  just overhyped burger place  prices? nah I'd rather n man  boyfriend ordered burger each two fries drink came more 20$ lol couldn't believe shroom burger whatever $10? put unicorn blood? lol but seriously Ive only eaten couple times because shopping DT summerlin just wanted eat something real quick  annoying people saving tables when hadnt even ordered yet    I feel if youve ordered THEN sit down eat  time youre done ordering more tables free up  plus side tho people working walk around see if need anything refill your drink gives restaurant feel  <EOR> Place alright  Very clean friendly staff   Nothing special  Way over priced sure  <EOR> Wow!! Mind blown!! little burgers tasty blk white shake good!! just want eat everyday!  can't wait return try different burger shake combo!  location also beautiful view very spacious service quick! <EOR> My first experience Shake Shack very shortly location Downtown Summerlin opened October 2015   back quite few times since see no reason why won't continue frequent place its tasty burgers desserts   The restaurant clean semi urban feel cool addition tables made wood old bowling lanes   touch noisy when place packed but overall bad   When lunchtime noticed favorite place kids nearby middle high school gather eat   Kind cool given relationship Shake Shack Communities Schools   More minute   Most seating inside but when weather permits there's decent amount outdoor seating too   admire gigantic menu wall when walk order counter take your number find seat   Depending busy they'll call when your food ready just might bring your table   The burgers all made 100% hormone antibiotic free Angus beef vegetarian options menu too   trying SmokeShack ShackBurger 'Shroom Burger the vegetarian burger option solid favorite SmokeShack   can't wrong bacon cheeseburger topped chopped cherry peppers add mild zing   Oh sure double   also tried Shack cago Dog   While thoroughly traditional definitely good variation Chicago style hotdog   If want Chicago dog can't find prepared traditional way definitely do   Then there's dessert which described just three words frozen custard concretes!  If you're unfamiliar concrete basically shake  thick drink through straw   Definitely try totally addicting Summerlin S'mores   great place even better location partnered Communities Schools Nevada small donation sale every Summerlin S'mores Red Velvet Rocks Crunch stellation concrete   eat dessert contribute keeping kids school! It whole dessert thing guilt free  Parking location Downtown Summerlin there's no shortage parking lots   If you're pressed time don't want long walk sure park north end shopping center   Now eat! <EOR> The SmokeShack Burger Shackmeister Dog pretty good  special Roadhouse Burger awful  supposed topped carmelized onions bacon mixed in  Instead cold mildly onion tasting goop top no sign any bacon  Need turn music down well  <EOR> Very good experience thus far twice  first time ordered hot chocolate shack cago dog fries  hot dog very good  second time shack burger coffee shake fries very good well  would recommend hot dog over burger just more exciting  But overall 10 10 very good!!!!!! <EOR> Decided way find others raving place even when pretty full  Tried shackburger boy didn't disappoint all! Service fast food counter when buzzer off  wait wasn't bad all maybe because chose location instead 1 Strip off hours too  <EOR> After attending Jingle Bell Silent Auction winning Gift Card took friend dinner before movie bad but high expectations try place quite disappointing    For $35 both fries burgers small soda fountain drinks also grabbed bag bones take home pugs  food very low quality Shroom burger since don't eat beef sounded delicious tasted ok but wasn't worth $7 itself maybe if fries came it  technically also ordered cheese fries just try cheese weird melted American cheese bland taste it  Nothing special them very boring    I officially don't see hype place is  come back? Sure but worth money being spent? knows  Maybe just during bad time staff still new learning but $35 satisfied   I also am concerned cashier system  took cashier 5 minutes figure use gift card instead asking someone else manager help she just kept yelling screen then finally showed why she couldn't job correctly which made entire 5 minutes just awkward  also only ones food then employee walked around entire place passing 3 times before finally realizing give bag bones ordered while back  Such awkward time but come back  <EOR> I'm burger girl  love burgers  If could would eat them every day  necessary try Shake Shack  Came while shopping Downtown Summerlin Sunday    Walked no line  Loved decor place cool ambiance  menu pretty extensive  Since first time kept simple ordered double shack cheeseburger fries strawberry shake  bf double burger bacon red peppers fries chocolate malt  cashier very friendly informative when came questions  order over $30   somewhat high burger place  But use hormone free meats     Didn't take very long food ready which plus  burger awesome  extra sides shack sauce dip fries in  Loved crinkle fries perfect mix crispy outside soft inside  Only downside really wished ranch  love ranch fries   but do  bf really enjoyed burger thought peppers perfectly complimented meal   My strawberry shake delicious wish bigger! bf wasn't impressed chocolate malt  He thought mine better  big Luv fans we're picky when comes custard shakes     Overall everything good  price huge turnoff if ate alone would almost $20  wasn't happy being any ranch  definitely place worth trying  <EOR> The fast food playing field changing drastically  era fast food chains getting away serving mediocre food cooked greasy oil impersonal service sterile environment designed facing intense competition newer generation fast food chains  new generation fast food chains being led Shake Shack Five Guys Smash Burger       hiking Calico Basin streets Downtown Summerlin brother post hike dinner Shake Shack  looking forward biting into Smokestack burger  recent times visited Shake Shack four times  developed appreciation Smokeshack burger       Just downtown Summerlin future regional shopping mall Shake Shack future fast food restaurant  experience describes dining futuristic fast food restaurant  ordering menu wall not over counter friendly cashier presented beeper  Instead waiting counter other people hearing order numbers off gentle buzz beeper off when food ready  dining room environment encouraged relax  totally disparate sundry fast food restaurants walled plate glass windows overlooking highway where psychological message eat back road  Shake Shack interior feels more casual full service restaurant fast food restaurant  table overlooked couple close caption HD TV sets playing football Shriek  If warm day could sat outside patio overlooking beautiful arroyo park downtown Summerlin  Whether sat inside outside employee offering dump garbage  if really wanted relax instead Coke crinkly fries could enjoyed draft beer  Biting into Smokestack burger more enough relax        Shake Shack consistent quality  similar fashion past three visits Smoke Shack burger elevated taste buds  100% angus beef between two soft buns delicious prime ingredients complimented Applewood bacon red peppers mysterious Shake Shack sauce  crinkly cut fries good but Nathan's greatness       seems Las Vegans including yours truly Daniel  love Shake Shack  But Shake Shack doing Winco business strategy where build couple restaurants require  people drive distance come them  Currently only other Las Vegas location New York New York      Speaking New York New York want clarify major Shake Shack misconception  misconception Shake Shack N Burger New York all over New York metropolitan area  true all  grew New York never heard them  Throughout young adulthood few locations city  Only recently did expand Suffolk County suburbs New York  totally different N Out  Shake Shack around $12 where N half price  Shake Shack offers several different items where N offers few  growing New York feel thar White Castle would comparable N Out     other hand antithesis misconception Shake Shack fantastic  all four star reviews including foreseeable walk into futuristic fast food restaurant set eyes People Love Yelp sticker  <EOR> Being Californian really excited whenever see Shake Shack because sadly don't all goodness there   only two other Shake Shacks other one which New York New York Strip    Today ordered burger fries no cheese vanilla concrete   burger although very good fresh seemed soggier bun buns previous visits Shake Shack   Otherwise burger pretty delicious   no idea Shake Sauce but pretty darn good   patty well seasoned very fresh    Unfortunately fries nothing write home about   crispy tasty don't wrong but  nothing notable   taste pretty similar freezer fries   vanilla concrete didn't taste much different any regular blizzard freeze McFlurry concoction   single pretty small might worth $3 50   For fast food Shake Shack pretty expensive   But burgers good fresh always come back!
