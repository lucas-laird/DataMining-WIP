The arepas itself very moist very heavy all opposed Caracas New York   As place just starting Felix knows he some changes menu venue adding chairs tv outside which commend listening customers he took note suggestions   The arepas great but needs variety components instead just meat filling    Will def back see improvements made  <EOR> Hmm  love arepas?
