Pancetta egg mozzarella crushed tomatoes just sounded good but didn't come together well hoping   Funnily enough when waiter came ask everything gave obligatory fine he just comes nowhere says Yeah   am kinda conflicted carbonara     just walks away   Hmmmmm   enough pancetta sauce crust wasn't well done wanted be   But all still pizza good but best   wife's margherita great     I still lot love Settebello look forward bumping 5 stars  <EOR> The Henderson location favorite pizza place since came town but sometime visit because distance home   glad new west side   Pizza seemed underdone which hope just part breaking in process   physical restaurant very attractive should become local hotspot   Viva Settebello! <EOR> Since opening couple weeks ago eaten 5 times already   Love type pizza Settabello gets right   If looking real pizza quality ingredients then need eat here  <EOR> My large group enjoyed time happy hour last night   Really good food the mini pizzas large enough full meal only $5 during happy hour! drinks happy guests   interior would call rustic chic dark wood everywhere     Since place just opened service perfect a few orders misplaced incorrect drinks served but servers themselves really nice quick correct any oversights   I see place becoming regular venue happy hour rotation!
