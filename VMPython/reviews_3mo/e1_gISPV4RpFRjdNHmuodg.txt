So ordered chips salsa Enchiladas del Mar  chips salsa came instantly salsa surprisingly good  spicy but necessarily mild  perfect  devoured chips    Next order enchiladas came out  looked good! put bit salsa chips enchiladas along black bean salsa came entree  AMAZING  mom never made any seafood enchiladas therefore best  shrimp scallops crab made excellent combination  Craving them right now     Needless say enjoyed dinner very much  would definitely recommend Enchiladas del Mar Chips Salsa  Yum! <EOR> My boyfriend shopping Town Square decided try place  Coconuts restaurant Mexico thought maybe part chain but wrong   think 3rd 4th restaurant location sure long stay open     We greeted seated hostess friendly but may first job she really young   took 5 minutes acknowledged server guess weren't station because she took drink orders another server brought them us   ordered bean cheese burrito boyfriend fish tacos   burrito ok but lukewarm best cheese inside barely melted   didn't say anything because figured would just nuke when back would hot eat   chips salsa good but small serving charge them when most Mexican places just give them you     The atmosphere restaurant really targeting younger crowd maybe college students 20 somethings   don't think saw male server but male bartender   girls all cutoffs really really short cutoffs bikini tops   chilly sure when weather colder   also guy blowing alcohol onto flame bottle making big fire ball   Very entertaining     NOT!    reasonably priced if still college would probably great place hang Friday Saturday night   probably again try something else menu but won't regular place dinner me  <EOR> I 6 30 pm Friday hang dinner drink long day work  sat bar where nice bartender named ? Chris ? made he said more orignial version sex beach   good drank quickly before ordering half off appetizer guacamole   When came probably more should eaten alone but REALLY tasty much better most places dont know good guac   Next ordered usual Madris  Since happy hour drinks super cheap but dont know exact price  came order Enchiladas Del Mar but guacamole appetizer little full definately getting next time  DID order fried ice cream Oh Gawsh! amazing  strawberry sauce perfect wasnt OVERLY sweet but since desert junkie just style  friend whos server waited around until off still stayed shift ended  Thats fun place is  other serers super sweet bitches girls Hooters seemed be  certain time live DJ he pretty awesome too    I back more once  getting enchiladas time!! Oh total only lke 15 bucks all too  5 drinks over whole night  Cant that! <EOR> KEEP YOUR RECEIPT!!   Especially if your server short Asian Latina girl tribal lower back tattoo   Went Friday 11 25 restaurant com certificate $50 which required spend least $100  wife another couple  all strawberry daiquiri's shot Grand Marnier added it  Shared flank steak fish tacos plantains ceasar salad chili verde  order guac  Ordered more daiquiri hit wall    Our subtotal only $88 server suggested another drink but extremely short time trying show  suggested open charge $12 absolutely nothing just $100 mark  Apparently beyond realm server's comprehension because literally took 35 minutes time asked check    So bill $50+tax 18% pre discounted auto gratuity  Based server's performance $18 tip pushing declined add anything additional  bill split two roughly $36 each tax  Today looked credit card POSTED amount just shy $53  Needless say shady little server graciously added tip    I wish servers restaurants understood concept courses  salad entrees caesar tasted buttermilk ranch dressing  plantains breaded fried bananas but otherwise food quite good   I'm still giving three stars based food but cautious  <EOR> The food great but service bad enough say something which normally don't   work service industry customer service everything  Coconuts doesn't understand   came dinner maybe 15 patrons staff standing around  took ten minutes someone came over take drink order then took ten minutes beers  Sadly sitting close enough bar could see drinks just waiting sent out  Then someone came asked would drink explained already ordered sitting bar    then no came back ten more minutes   After hour waiting food brought out  looked great but hour timeline no brought napkins silverware  employee walked asked silverware napkins     nothing happened  Then saw manager walking around  flagged down explained  issue she ran silverware came back napkin   we burgers tacos  Mind food table almost five minutes   She came back pile napkins then guy originally came back fifteen minutes them      Finally meal over manager brought bill which all wrong  She felt pretty bad gave few free rounds  Maybe off day something but service would your grandparents roll over grave   food good though good luck trying place out  <EOR> The waiter warned The plate hot  True  But food not  ever heard Mexican restaurant without complimentary chips salsa? worth trip  <EOR> Terrible service terrible food! only thing half way decent drinks overpriced received  never pay chips salsa Mexican restaurant before charge $5  green sauce okay red tasted just canned enchilada sauce  five dining all ordering different items nothing tasted good  food very bland tasteless  When complained waitress manager wouldn't even come over table  All relayed could order something else if didn't ordered  early dinner maybe 3 other tables filled no excuse such poor service long wait receive food  <EOR> Don't bother  dinner place almost empty but hostess told wait bar would 15 minute wait  What!! Decided wasn't going worth wait still waiting 15 minutes  down couple shops excellent dinner crowded Yardhouse  <EOR> I hoping location would finally put together good Mexican restaurant   Unfortunately might worse Lolita's   place beach bar mexico impersonates restaurant before 10 pm   waitress really nice but  it   Chips salsa cost 5 00 chips cold semi stale   asked queso cheese presented bowl lukewarm liquid cheese   Fish tacos ok     I sure hope kill nightclub because place die same death Lolita's did if not   really hope figure out  <EOR> Two stars being generous   We wanted night out   something different last night while Town Square walking around stumbled upon Coconuts Beach Bar Mexican Grill  Let just say place much better when Lolita's Tequila bar  sure why closed but shouldn't have    We looked menu wall outside restaurant figured we'd give shot    When walked greeted hostess next waitress complaining table she just waited on  Luckily able better server  feel bad sweet server had  She deserves work such better place  matter fact observation alone server appeared only place actually cared job    After being seated poorly lit area presented small dinner menu large Margarita drink menu  given water waitress took drink order  20 minutes later received drinks  boyfriend seated facing bar noticed first wrong drink made followed 1 drink coming then other    The food actually best part time there   We ordered guac chips  came quick decent  chips dripping oil freshly made  guac could used little more salt but polished off bowl can't complain much    For dinner ordered Carne Tacos he Del Mar Enchiladas    another 20 minutes food came time eat  meals came rice beans  Both delicious     The menu said Carne Taco's would served 2 corn tortillas  3 tacos single tortilla  meat amazing but covered onions way you'd cover chili dog onions   removing most onions squeeze lime perfect    The Del Mar Enchiladas told very good well     Because checked Yelp did receive free dessert item  Fried Ice Cream which wasn't bad either     Would recommend place friend? Certainly not   back second time dine? No way!    If place wants become successful dining establishment suggest getting rid lazy people don't care job changing menu bit bartenders know drink quickly  Oh subscribe Satellite radio rather streaming Pandora ad's  <EOR>
