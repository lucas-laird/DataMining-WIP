Eat white bread add extra crispy chicken skin more crunch   guys actually mentioned let chicken skin render oven instead deep frying them   small shack outside dive bar afford serve fois gras sandwiches less $10 bucks?!  Jake gets great bargain Artisanal Foods create pâté  two parts duck liver part chicken liver   TIP Eat sandwich spot them put chicken skin side if plan eating elsewhere avoid soggy chicken skin   REUBEN ISH corned beef fennel kraut switss 1000 island dressing Definitely best valley!!  Awesome idea using fennel instead cabbage since anise flavor greatly compliments meat well marble rye bread   Corned beef also tender quite tasty     LE PIG pork belly pickled radish chicharon vinaigrette sandwich alright   Thought little bland needed more seasoning   Textures great though moist pork belly homemade Dino's kitchen crunchy chicharon   Isn't greasy other sandwiches menu   FLUFF NUTT nutella toasted marshmallow crunch few items menu  good Monte Cristo style   Tasted French toast stuffed nutella marshmallow   Great late breakfast dessert   Thought little sweet liking though   Overall Goodwich best sandwich joints Las Vegas   Amazing food superb customer service   definitely recommend place over any other places town  <EOR> Had foie gras am very happy  Probably won't eat often because animal rights things behind but fact live California means won't access anyway  Love people really care customers' opinions sandwich  definitely stop again when  town  <EOR> WELCOME GOODWICH HOME GOODWICH MAY TAKE YOUR ORDER?
