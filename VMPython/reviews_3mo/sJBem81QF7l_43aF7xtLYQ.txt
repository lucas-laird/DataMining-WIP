The guys taking orders nice but ladies very bad attitude even order fucked fruit wasn't fresh  crepe overall okay  lady needs change attitude <EOR> The service excellent!! crêpes delicious whether sweet savory something please anyone!  coffee strong delicious! prices aren't high decent size meal really good price <EOR> Great prices pretty good crepe! place just opened long ago very impressed! highly recommend it  <EOR> New crepe place very good very well priced! establishment clean staff very friendly crepes tasty  <EOR> Really good crepes! Excellent service! Everyone friendly outgoing seem high priority good food quality taste! <EOR> It's 11 days since little restaurant opened up!  Fun fact place originated owner's home locals would drive down house just orders in!   This place offers variety batters whole wheat classic red velvet sugar free!   I tried both red velvet crêpe classic crêpe   two crêpes stuffed strawberries bananas   finish off topped lechera sweet condensed milk powdered sugar whipped cream   flavor both batters magnificent but crêpes slightly chewy comparison traditional French crêpes   portions rather large which fantastic!  Overall I'd give them 4 5   The Americano hot coffee ordered very bitter slightly burnt taste   sure if machine's fault just bad quality beans   definitely ordering again recommend passing when given choice   The Chicken Pesto Panini nothing special   chicken very tender juicy must compliment restaurant that!  bread nicely toasted too!  pesto sauce lacked little seasoning which resulted just strong taste plain basil   taste little strong ended overpowering panini instead complimenting ingredients     If rate restaurant alone its crêpes which specialty would definitely 4 stars   If you're area would definitely recommend trying if you're craving something sweet!  staff extremely friendly too! <EOR> Crepe Station finally brick mortar location! Menu includes coffee drinks paninis but highlight namesake crepes available sweet savory varieties  open kitchen space huge plus see your crepe being made   CHICKEN PESTO PANINI Buttery bread variety fresh fillings but still oddly plain side  I'd suggest different pesto more pop it  Sided your choice chips salad my choice which came topped chopped fruit balsamic  preference but bad  NUTELLA CREPE Huge crepe tons Nutella topped your choice two chopped fruits strawberry mango being mine   Generous portion low price made fresh oozing hazelnut spread  I'd try savory version next time  CARAMEL FRAPPE $3 best price found standard blended coffee beverage I'd prefer frequent spot 'Bucks across street    Service all smiles location clean great hours 8AM 11PM daily  small menu allows skills crepe artists shine but try different Panini next time   EDIT Dropping star rating  Toppings fillings inconsistent seem declining quality  If you're wanting crepes area it'll but better options town  <EOR> My coworkers talking crepes places crepes really popular crepe place sold crepes house advertise through Mexican Craigslist popular opened real brick mortar store  Typical water cooler chitchat delivery truck driver when he stops order pick up   That interested  first told E  Charleston  But later found another coworker said closer W  Charleston Decatur  thinking come never heard place used only lived few streets away   So mandated doctor's office visit mile two away decided give Crêpe Station try  nearly missed small strip mall located due alerts popped phone plus lane closed Charleston due knows what  But slow moving traffic able turn into plaza located in   The place turns only opened 2 weeks  But owners did several months perfect recipes techniques while operating underground home operation  Hundreds if thousands satisfied Mexicans can't wrong am really glad learn place through words mouth networking   Their menu simple organized logically  your sweet crêpes your savory crêpes paninis beverages coffees smoothies   first timers ordering stressful trying narrow down your option just 400+ items Chinese takeout menu   I wanted try Red Velvet dessert crêpe but ultimately picked Chicken Pesto Crêpe it around noon lunch yet   young kids behind counter nice took order prepared delivered table nominal wait   The included side salad looks better most side salads 95% restaurants there  some sliced strawberries mangos top mixed mesclun greens light balsamic dressing  Chicken Pesto Crêpe looks good presentation nicely conceptualized executed crepe cooked just perfectly  happy selection price tag  Service pleasant efficient too   Would back try some more items simple menu?
