I actually asked girl for lack better term if petal per flavor standard she said yes    If fact telling truth its standard practice then quality means very little when you're delivering patrons pay for   I think next time crave Amorino hold until next trip home  Oh New York Amorino's yelp page see ship supposed delivering  <EOR> My friend passed place way dinner Town Square  decided dessert here  tried L'Inimitabile coffee macarons filled gelato cup coffee  macarons tasted good coffee okay  annoying whole time inside even when he helping employee behind counter talking friend foreign language  just think  incredibly rude  <EOR> I just checked Amorino location Las Vegas  Exactly same quality Paris !
