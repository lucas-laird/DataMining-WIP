The crispy chicken also good  additional flavor never tasted other fried chicken  Garlic? rangoon real headliner tummy though    Now dirt  huge plus looks ridiculously nice presentation  Unfortunately can't vouch dessert  Vanilla pudding flavor strongly overtakes entire cup  basically rends other elements cup obsolete  chocolate syrup just digresses into flavor its own byproducts  Oreos tastes processed crumbs when eaten super sweet pudding  just tastes concoction pudding textures faint tinge chocolate  would order again The pictures nice though!
