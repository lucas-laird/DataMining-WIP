I am glad Hot Feel finally open  If love spicy seafood place you  Same concept Hot Juicy but Hot Feel uses totally different spices   Unlike those bag seafood sautéed iron pan  seafood watery taste better  should also try lamb beef skewers tender juicy  Even thought food slightly salty think price cheaper service good restaurant bright clean   Highly recommend groups family fun gathering  <EOR> So far good and spicy definitely back  spacious restaurant  Staff uber friendly  didn't catch name but he pretty cool server   First off hotpot combo  4 items 5 pieces each soaks hotpot broth  There's no mild second option terms spice levels 3 total   He says doesn't soak spice much short time span but tofu SOAKS well  beware if can't take much spice me   Aside only lamb skewers  back other stuff  Now lamb skewers mild because frankly don't want die burning   So guess what? died burning  spicy!!!!!!! WHY?! Because trying new spice new manufacturer or something like WAY spicy  wasn't just us  believe staff tried well table next us  Yeah death burning tongue wishing milk of course didn't it   BURN BURN BURN   Anyway gave new stock lamb skewers  No spice    Owner came over apologized explained situation  No biggie  He's pretty nice guy  Explained VIP cards too  Right now $20 until end April  if think you'll coming often grab before prices up  pretty much where offer different deals per day each day offers different item   For example could BOGO for example BOGO crab day  could 10% off whole bill  forth  don't remember every he listed but feel free ask any servers  While experience wasn't excellent first time handled well  definitely back  ^^V <EOR> I really enjoy customer service decor place different  place worth try least once shrimp garlic sauce tasted amazing sadly enjoyed sauce more enjoyed shrimp  Price little pricier other crawl fish places but guess worth since give clay pot thing  <EOR> Came first time dinner finally    wanting try since first heard it    SUPER easy spot night  If coming Spring Mountain its huge brightly lit Shrimp end plaza  XD   Decor very interesting unique design  particular tastes may quite different others XD   After hearing hot pot combo skewers    THATS GOTTA try !   Lamb Sticks $5 95 8 skewers tried spicy medium  Spicy first  Meat kind small  Flavor wise DELICIOUS ! Spicy flavorful  Cumin pepper believe lemon grass well? Yummy ! Priced good ! Medium level actually bit disappointing  quite huge gap spice level between medium spicy  call spicy scale 1 10 maybe 8  Medium 3 4  wasn't spicy  actually sweet me  Doriee called teriyaki lamb  XD   Beef Sticks $4 95 8 skewers Spicy level well  Same seasoning lamb skewers  little awkward because usually cumin spice used lamb  still good  Spicy spicy lamb too  Meat amount more then lamb    Hot Pot Combo $11 95 20 sticks 4 different items ordered shrimp fried tofu king oyster mushroom beef tendon balls    Shrimp Cooked perfectly  Kind flavorless  Some people called place sichuan hot n juicy  No where near it  None sauce stuck  Even peeling shell dipping back into sauce didnt help  Hot Pot soup thin application    King Oyster Mushroom Good texture mushroom known be  Slides OFF skewer very easily    you'll caveman spear pokin later just use two skewers chopsticks style    Beef Tendon Balls Cut into maybe 1 8 slivers ? Holds soup flavor pretty well  Seemed nicely absorbed into slivers    Fried Tofu Lol  called the item screw thy self     Fried tofu tends VERY porous KNOWN soak ANYTHING put thats liquid  Spicy hot pot soup sponge tofu? Yep    XD Holds LOT soup each piece  Tends dribble down your chin CAREFUL yourself VERY careful cuz explode when bite into P   Overall lamb skewers delicious  Beef ok  Hot pot combo im pretty sure soup base same use hot pot home     Lol flavor VERY VERY similar    XD bad overall  would come back lamb skewers alone  <EOR> YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014 70 365 Sounds Massage Parlor There's always something new popping Chinatown Hot Feel part newest crop located same strip mall Kinh waaaay back surrounded foot spas massage parlors  Similar Hot Juicy Boiling Crab format offer assorted seafood piece pound sauces different heat levels according amount heat handle served heavy duty pots instead plastic bags well various appetizers fried items skewers hot pots   Prior demolition time given two pieces paper your placemats pair annoying gloves don't even fit glove sure ask wet naps which register found meal cause its gonna messy   Our party four decided share Lamb Skewers Shrimp Skewers Chicken Wings Rock Crab Garlic Shrimp  Rock Crab sweet nice lemony accent Shrimp Skewers head shell on okay while wings  hot crisp juicy would've liked see Hot Feel twist rather just cup ranch especially Asian restaurant  standouts Garlic Shrimp head shell on which packed tons flavor right amount heat we asked mild   Lamb Skewers also soft flavorful  If come items try   Right now running VIP Card special $20 no expiration date which allows 10% off your dining bill future visits BOGO specials night BOGO Crab if post any food pic Facebook NOT Yelp Instagram you win drawing jewelry front well gift certificates towards future visits  Come taste see stacks other favorites town   ALOHA!!!

Andrew C boyfriend decided come dinner  let tell place confusing  Finding wasn't hard cause giant shrimp building but once walked wondering if supposed American Creole Asian  establishment very spacious decorations VERY modern  know feeling when walk into restaurant  supposed Asian but doesn't look Asian little skeptical       But heck lamb skewers lamb sticks called it  trying find good place lamb skewers ages!  So group ordered hot pot stick spicy lamb skewers med spicy beef skewers spicy    For hot pot sticks came pitcher hot pot soup skewers  choose 4 menu chose shrimp beef tendon balls fried tofu king oyster mushroom  hot pot soup base pretty much mala broth  wasn't spicy per say just hot     temperature hot  end dish average  wasn't anything special  just order king oyster mushrooms its own?!   The lamb skewers very good but flavor difference between medium spicy spicy huge  medium spicy lamb skewers tasted sweet while spicy ones spicy  medium spicy ones no go  LOVED spicy ones  DELICIOUS  exactly type lamb skewers look for  Wonderfully seasoned cumin spicy flavor  only thing     pieces meat quite small  would probably better if pieces bigger less well done  Oh eat them while they're still hot because once gets cold doesn't taste good anymore   The beef skewers other hand no go  don't think beef cumin good combination  Then again maybe just biased? just lamb better beef when comes cumin spicy seasoning    Overall  Lamb skewers go  definitely come back them maybe try some seafood <EOR> Nice new concept dining room  Boths all around yet still see everything   Great friendly service  back! skewers AMAZING!
