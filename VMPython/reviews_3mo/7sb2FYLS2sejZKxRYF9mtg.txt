I come restaurant other day thinking Kabuki Dining Bar going through renovation   asked waitress when started renovating she told no longer Kabuki now Sakana   sad first when heard Kabuki gone but willing give Sakana chance   Since Sakana still going through process renovating noticed few differences some art hung new flat TV playing K Pop American music videos   As food husband throughly impressed   decided AYCE sushi dinner price $22 95 lunch $20 95    waitress asked if wanted add All Drink extra $3 !    opt but its ok next time!  Anyways mainly ate nigiri Yellowtail Salmon Super White Tuna etc   all succulent quite fresh!  liked sauces some nigiri because each complimented fish   We tried order Uni Sea Urchin but sushi chef head chef maybe? came person apologize he couldn't shipped week because supplier told Uni weren't fresh due weather conditions   totally ok both thought thoughtful come over tell that     So all sushi lovers come over Sakana    food definitely worth trying! <EOR> I happened around area decided check place due good word mouth  Sakana used Kabuki but quite honestly change Sakana good change   The first thing sushi chefs really attentive made lots small talk  plate cup weren't empty long finished food drink   I tried every type nigiri besides 2 3 items tend try any sushi place must say every piece fresh  sauces came along nigiri complimented each piece fish very nicely  also liked fact tako cut thinner most other places  prefer spend 5 minutes trying break down piece octopus   The rolls menu also quite varied managed try baked lobster roll tempura eel roll  Both rolls quite good would tried few more but time getting full nigiri    Overall though Sakana really good encourage people give shot  tried quite few places say Sakana terms Vegas AYCE  Hopefully keep because if another solid ayce spot town  <EOR> My favorite AYCE spot far! Ive tried ton place  wait staff very friendly well sushi chefs  three four times now every time would bring over something different try chef's new specials  fish very fresh  Ive never seen more few people time its nice sushi bar isnt totally packed all time  place must try <EOR> If looking fresh sushi restaurant place perfect place  offer fresh fish reasonable price  service great  focus lot customer satisfaction  strongly recommend try place gonna love awesome place  <EOR> We came thinking Kabuki boy surprised when walked Ryan favorite Sushi Chef another place which shall remain nameless ! extatic!

Yes BETTER quality fish around town   Yes better AYCE sushi   BUT all above check marked VERY GOOD AYCE SUSHI SPOT!  Service fast friendly orders taken promptly food showed quickly!  little quiet Wednesday night but plenty room large groups here!  Some notables The Soft Shell Crab   AMAZING! Loved every bite   this highlight night me!  limited 1pp either!!  Maybe just fill next time without them giving evil eye!  Nigiri Garlic Tuna Hamachi Super White Amaebi Unagi Scallops all great!  Lots little additions them sure specify if want your fish naked chef prepares them!    Most nigiri such crazy fish rice ratio could wrap fish all way around rice if wanted to   end end   AYCE sashimi touch rice!  Since came large group able try some rolls too   everything pretty good!  lots good appetizers well stand heavy competition Vegas   I am sure back Tons pics! <EOR> I same time Paolo Lisa Cathy Shawn along some others haven't posted reviews yet    I agree bang buck ratio especially all eat sushi incredible here  Shawn isnt kidding all when he mentions fish rice ratio don't crop slice rice instead leave giant slice  long enough wrap around rice which quite noticeable change compared other spots    Another thing impressed Goyemon like policy no limitations many desserts get   The plum ice cream far some best ice cream sushi joint   So why missing star? Well things ordered sauce heavy really sauced some dishes  few appetizers lacked explanation menu but instead said something long lines 'hey you! order am friggin amazing!' when comes nothing more krab that fake crab  made fish paste deep fried shell drizzled sauce  say wasnt good well wasnt  just due hatred krab K but known would ordered more nigiri    definitely radar now all eat sushi joint great value but steering clear sauced items     Yelp 100 045 100 <EOR> Because all eat type place don't use best quality fish  pretty fresh but tell many years working fish market      <EOR> this place use kabuki  lunch when looking through some pics saw many rolls items wanted try unfortunately only dinner  sure items want try only dinner  arrived greeted seated right away  place nice cozy  drinks started baked muscles yummy spicy garlic edamame  very flavorful  seaweed salad ok   comes very small serving  short ribs very good tasty shrimp tempura can't wrong  your daddy very sweet shit very good  second round tried hawaiian roll lobster roll salmon lemon bunch others  everything very delicious  just becareful baked rolls very filling  fav all time garlic tuna  waiter very attentive gave asked refill drinks taking away plates finished  ended ice cream tempura  also side note alot things ive notice small servings compared other all eat joints  back oh did mention lunch 20 95 dinner 22 95! <EOR> One only two that know of TRUE All You Can Eat sushi joints town possibly cheapest price town Sakana solid contender AYCE sushi arena   After reading highly rated reviews yet again fellow yelpers check Sakana ourselves glad did! came lunch sat bar Chef Sai very personable funny yet passionate sushi  called ahead time asked difference between lunch price $20 95 dinner price $22 95 was   they don't offer some items lunch dinner just yourself favor all pay dinner price KILL IT!!!!  Appetizers Rolls Nigiri Dessert    besides standard per person Uni Amaebi which automatically comes fried head much want much put away half rolls try different ones fish quality great Of course top tier fish found Kabuto Yonaka Yummy Grill W Lake Mead especially Uni nigiri entire roe! something Chef Sai proud being able select ingredients straight source  allows charge amazingly low prices   The fish rice ratio pretty awesome too  I'd say he uses no more oh       about 50 grains rice per nigiri enjoy fish without rice overkill  Everything very tasty! Sakana also offers good variety appetizers salads other side dishes worth try too  Chef Sai definitely done homework dined competitors around town see he stand rest them  Although stuck mostly nigiri appetizers tried Sashimi Roll which very artfully  presented very delicious  Chef Sai also gave Pink Scallop shell presented mango salsa ponzu which specials board  room half roll more before dessert asked Chef Sai half roll anything he wanted shrimp tempura crab center wrapped maguro hamachi topped red onion ponzu I tried looking menu but couldn't find it    it custom roll Which one? asked  He replied which roll  LOL!!! Good times Chef Sai!  Desserts pretty good too  Plum Ice Cream delicious Black Sesame Blanc Manger  If ever area again craving hits most definitely back!   ALOHA!!! <EOR> After all those rave reviews Sakana requested hubby dinner Friday evening   When arrived wasn't busy whatsoever sat other side which separated plants etc   However 10 minutes before male server realized he customers sitting side     He then took drink order though ready place order he said he right back since another couple arrived   Service SLLLLOOOWWW   feels if though short servers   When he finally came back ask order course order uni amaebi then he stop said ran uni amaebi  Let check  Then he disappeared while   When he came back he handed sheet order verified uni amaebi order   So ordered items special menu toro steak salmon belly white fish saba superwhite salmon scallops salmon kama   Server came back let know salmon kama Hamachi kama   said yeah  cool   He left returned let know also hamachi kama   For items did order only thing tasted good salmon belly toro steak   Other items doused much sesame oil tasteless downright odd the scallops tasted previously cooked    So point given order anything else since want stuff myself mediocre sushi   Earl however eating sustenance     We never ever order sushi rolls AYCE   But night Earl did   He eat just eat   overheard another table said couldn't order chicken fried rice because it   heck run chicken fried rice when your restaurant isn't even busy?  learned another yelper visited Sakana earlier health inspector came earlier service slowed down lot   Guess explains some parts evening but mediocre sushi?  Conclusion Goyemon still best   return Sakana  <EOR> Interesting   I'd wanting try place ever since reading Amber Rose K 's groundbreaking review finally chance today  Parking bit tougher old days Kabuki Dining Bar previous ownership since there's now more places open small plaza  still see old signage same layout Kabuki there's still some old specialty desserts green tea panna cotta black sesame blanc manger   Everything else different   This place reminds Sushi Koma  kinda Koma lite if live side town aren't trying find sushi 2 am whatnot  Adorning nigiri sauces whatnot reminiscent Koma also interesting appetizers including crispy rice loved it bulgogi nachos careful cream cheese recently added appetizer red text I won't type name because some might find offensive    I wasn't told advance place nigiri roll orders paper may applicable bar area seating   something only seen California never Vegas but actually does help plan your meal  still verbalize order appetizers specials desserts no worries there   I've started find some places honor dinner prices and therefore menus early hours also able sashimi salad really good sashimi roll wrapped unobtrusive cucumber some dinner only specials board including toro steak basically seared sauced salmon belly always welcome white fish sashimi kinda thing pleasant see pictures    The biggest improvement over Kabuki and vs  Koma actually Sakana does limit dessert  big dessert guy tried little bit almost everything  sweet smooth plum ice cream best mango mochi expected black sesame blanc manger nice change pace  disappointed green tea ice cream little lacking flavor icy compared plum well superior green tea ice cream Goyemon   I can't really put finger why didn't best impression visit  enjoyed lot items liked having dinner specials just $22 95 vs  $20 95 lunch   Maybe nigiri  fish to rice ratio great but each piece didn't fill mouth much used since fish comes long thin slices  could also just hadn't built enough appetite lunchtime  Most likely however I'd say because just best AYCE sushi Las Vegas twice week place just crushes Sakana direct competition  willing return should give try if you're AYCE fan but prefer some other places just little more  <EOR>
