Classic Umami Burger joint   Sports bar inside well     The burgers cooked well even opening day   hard time getting logistics together but tried really hard   Really great service especially manager Rachel over top here     Get regular burger which known for   medium rare   juicy slightly salty tart plenty beefiness     Good service good food place some sports bets     And thanks Rachel  <EOR> I've eaten Umami Burger Santa Monica CA Pasadena CA Husband crazy excited see coming Las Vegas right next door us!! truffle burger AMAZING! juicy bursting flavor  If tater tots order cheesy tater tots  They're menu though they're secret    Shhhh  hubby agree jalepeno ranch sauce best tots  other sauces just ok  I took star away because online said weren't taking reservations until September 1st  But when walked into dining area 40 minute wait all booths reserved  waitress  nice though! <EOR> I've original Umami location LA bookmarked longest time whatever reason just never time when we're town  when booked room SLS knew Umami definitely going meals!  This location inside SLS quite large  only full service restaurant but also houses casinos sports book beer garden  There's quite bit seating throughout location but way set weird seems no real uniformity  Alongside seating indoor bar there's small tables high tops couches sports book  Then when walk outside you've more picnic table style seating another fairly large bar  good 50+ feet long  There's just lot going depending where sit may able order food just sit down enjoy drink while watching games  If coming strictly food though offer text notifications gamble whatever while waiting table   Looking online seems menu pretty much same other locations there's good amount options too  If you're feeling burger salads Un Beef sandwiches even sausages  sides pretty typical burger joint fries customized handful ways  There's 8 burgers choose Umami no different others infamous no substitution rule full effect  Although let request different cooking temperature meat  Standard cooking temp medium rare just ya know   We decided order fried pickles share opted Truffle Especiale burger  Oddly enough receiving order waitress told she wasn't huge fan fried pickles  couldn't disagree more definitely some better had  batter thick crunchy flavorful stuck pickle completely  never fell apart liked pickle inside wasn't hot couldn't eat it  Adding flavor nice side jalapeno ranch creamy just touch heat   Although bit small side burger equally impressive  If you're fan truffle Umami does disappoint! Topped both truffle butter truffle arugula flavor immediately present without being overpowering  arugula still nice crisp texture coupled perfectly fried egg  Now guys proud beef too   and rightfully so! meat isn't smashed down meatloaf own hints both sweet salty flavors  juicy cooked perfect medium rare    With all commotion going around first day admittedly expected less stellar service  far case thought service excellent  Apart expressing hatred fried pickles ordered them waitress extremely friendly even little funny too  appreciate she knew menu well didn't hesitate answer single question  only she game but other servers checking every other table sure drinks full etc  team work overall ambience just great!  For burger joint overall prices aren't horrible but aren't great either  burger $14 even though think more casino thing pretty irritated paying $5 soda  2 burgers 2 drinks side bill $55 tip  also huge fan having all stuff packed into location  But food service both very good definitely see myself coming back! <EOR> SLS hotel's grand opening today while many restaurants eventually try gourmet burger mind stomach set on    The wait table good 30 min  but gave some time explore casino   friendly staff took info received text message when table ready   When arrived option indoor outdoor seating   stayed cool inside    The atmosphere loud   Half room caters sports book where order food while catching multiple games large plasma tvs sit bar specialty cocktails   music rolls casino won't making much conversation though without raising your voice    Our server very nice accommodating explaining menu sauces making suggestions us   opted start some fries appetizer which customize   gravy braised short rib top   Delicious     We ordered original umami burger truffle especiale  Descriptions photos wife decided truffle burger better two    Other non beef options ahi tuna green turkey burger coming second time least try those    The hiccup wife burger the original ordered well while some pink ordered mine medium  order came switched give majority yummy truffle burger her!  just hungry send back!

Come guys really? no problem paying high strip prices premium product I E  anything Wynn but gotta deliver premium product  waitress noticed didn't eat pickles did take them off bill    Atmosphere ok service good  just can't figure why people would pay prices micro servings aren't amazing    General lesson SLS any other new business  can't charge ultra premium prices deliver 5 star food service  now eaten Cleo Umami Griddle wouldn't recommend them anybody now  long time local want SLS succeed  need jobs great showcase properties  Come gang pay attention! <EOR> Tired Umami Burger when LA when u heard opened Vegas try it   Food same taste LA consistency good    The only thing bothered drinks pretty expensive  don't mind paying 6 8 alcoholic drink but $12    I would come back however would just drink water soda cuz alcoholic drinks expensive    It prolly busy but waiter neither nice rude  She basically doing job  Nothing really stood customer service  <EOR> It okay    Nothing excited about  love good burger but just lacking flavor price  tempura onion rings spot though! <EOR> Not very diverse staff horrible service should try pick better employees never back  Food ok better food red robin <EOR> Phenomenal !!!!

Seemed disorganized arrival     Twenty minutes waiting table restaurant but noticed least six tables wide open    text when your table ready which think cool    Sat down beverages pretty timely manner   Fried pickles tasty full spears served garlicky jalapeno ranch sauce runny but flavorful     Then just downhill     Our order Cali Burger Manly Burger Manly Fries seems simple enought right?

Eventually comped burgers but still $20 two Pepsis order fried pickles    If you're Vegas looking good burger yourself favor somewhere else   plenty burger places give excellent burger way want it   Umami burger raw burger side superiority  <EOR> Terrible service okay food good drinks  Umami Burger basically poor man's Bachi Burger dressed overpriced burger where over pay because strip   Combine total lack competent service you're disappointing night   service SLS apparently stands Style Luxury Service but Umami Burger contorts Severely Lacking Service  If you're local eat Bachi Burger before going SLS you'll superior burger better prices     While appreciate restaurant just opened may working kinks service incredibly disappointing   top off marketer restaurant adjacent table see if locals give them information local specials   When looked catch eye she just looked then ignored walked away   pretty much par terrible service also server nothing but attitude rarely came back check table   said server cognizant enough smile tell she hoped great dining experience when she dropping off check     Umami Burger just lost 8 customers never eat  your establishment again   looking other reviews looks alienating your future customers   least you're consistent  <EOR> Was curious try restaurant but should taken advice previous reviewers skipped it   Service started bit slow downhill there   original burger hubby royale   He said pretty good but mine zero flavor   Thank goodness fries salty least some flavor!  borrow ketchup next table could find someone bring any   waitress didn't even come check until nearly done   Wasn't offered refill tea until brought check   table next seemed issues experience well   money far better places Las Vegas   Sticking Bachi Burger! <EOR> Gross!
