Well guess statement don't fix what's broke definitely applies here  girl Summer brought literally threw bar said mango habanero walked away  Talk poorest customer service skills   The worst part manager Chris  Everyone understand being control your employees making sure jobs being done  However don't respect manager reprimanding micro managing being disrespectful employees front patrons  exactly witnessed  Very uncomfortable  Also some salsa he made move around instead stepping aside let pass  respect lady two paying customer   The bottom line excited try new place close home could frequent unfortunately case   I most definitely return food but may just drink only person any customer service skills Amanda  I'm sorry frank but when spend over $60 dollars service quality food received strongly feel others should know too  mean why Yelp not? <EOR> Great hopitality upcoming establishment Boca Park Summerlin  area  Elizabeth House bartenders duty Wow excellent Margaritas  feel bar genuine feel home  Shout Brian Mangino director Operations he really knows Excellent Customer Service is  Brian team made visit very enjoyable minute sat down bar  Give establishment try won't regret it!!!! <EOR> It's walk style jack box type restaurant  jack box service boca park prices  food margaritas just okay very pricey  Definatly wouldn't recommend it  <EOR> Man wish margaritas weren't delicious refreshing    When walk into place barkeep tells inventors Original Margarita well might well stick fork 'cause ain't going nowhere anytime soon   In case you're wondering Original Margarita damn fine margarita   My barkeep House he just brilliant more famous medical namesake   I started Mexican corn  Mexican corn truly odd experience Midwestern kid raised corn on the cob  Back home only way people cooked corn on the cob pot boiling water method which all but removes every bit flavor corn it's wonder wasn't culinarily scarred life     Forgive tangent but if could travel back time would back grade school self introduce myself Mexican Corn and then would explode into non existence when contact congratulatory high five    Needless say reason Mexican Corn pretty much only picture menu  No matter else try need try Mexican Corn   House picked two tacos kept margaritas flowing  honestly admit cannot remember which tacos but may due House's master mixology skills  say without doubt two best ever had   The prices quite high which sole reason missing star  completely saying price point doesn't match food service quality but prices need come down little bit 5 star joint especially Original Margarita which hits whopping $10 piece    But good news happy hour Original Margarita half price  Guess where you'll finding now on? <EOR> It opened Monday visited Friday July 24th around 7 30pm   I came back door sat down bar  used frequent place when Embers changes place interesting see removal wall separating bar dining tables well lighter wood stains red upholstery chairs  Lots random pictures posters adorn walls  bar two hanging bottle displays different tequilas them  really liked interior seemed lighter fresher   Bartender Justin spotted came over take order  He recommended original margarita $10 95   He gave some good recommendations tacos well since don't spicy food  Tacos 2 $9 95  missed Happy Hour menu which discounts drinks only   Original Margarita huge margarita fan usually enjoy tequila shot  ok nothing special book    Tacos chicken taco comes fresh pineapple top pork belly taco extra $1   Both plenty big very well made lots meat  pork belly taco delicious sweet marinade sauce some crispy pork rinds top    Service great Justin kept using name during conversations checking frequently keeping water glass full  other bartender whose name don't remember didn't hardly even look way nor smile much while she working other side bar  manager guy seemed he watching bartenders work he also didn't smile much seem much customer connection    Overall probably come back during Happy Hour when drink prices little more reasonable  thing did notice bartenders shirts said Serving fun since 1932 some year yet place didn't really seem all fun  seemed business  <EOR> Good Mexican fast food GREAT Original Margaritas  very happy see three vegetarian taco options! Original margaritas half price during happy hour  Boca Park location good sized patio big tables large groups  Staff attentive  definitely back  <EOR> High hopes but sadly disappointed  expensive but added quickly  Girls seemed they'd rather anywhere but splash conceitedness  asked if habanero guacamole really spicy just hint flavor employee said wasn't spicy all  $6 00 portion ridiculously small  Robertos gives more food actually would rather gone   portions way smaller expected especially bc heavier set girl said big enough share  WRONG  <EOR> Shout House being awesome! liked could pick your own salsa endless warm chips made hour happy! <EOR> This first time found food good service quick friendly Chris manager simply outstanding!  Great seating view   a sure Friday place  <EOR> Great margaritas!  Love street corn!  even good Chardonnay   atmosphere delightful people friendly   Happy Hour 3 7!  great addition Summerlin food scene  <EOR> Came during HH suggestion other reviews 3PM 6PM Mon Fri FYI  Half off limited drinks no food specials  Only Original Margarita discounted down $5 full sized glass instead typical lowball glass might expect  don't know if I'd splurge $10+ specialty version but lychee sounds delicious   Food menu pretty basic two taco plates running $10 additional options burritos nachos  bonus points offering vegetarian options barbacoa which difficult find Las Vegas version isn't great but adequate  $7 order nachos +$2 protein par Chipotle terms size taste price    The service really great Mario sidekick friendly outgoing checked frequently  Aside place bit more average hoped for  Considering Hussong's around 120+ years food very Americanized    prices  <EOR> Really disappointed food service  busser cleaning tables without  sanitizer  Going table other  moving dirt table other  Chicken taco very bad so much oil food  really sad  get manager gonna  watch everything  <EOR> Shrimp tasted white rubber inedible  Beef tasted jerky  Black beans no flavor can   Better options nearby  Did drinks  <EOR> Ate some girlfriends Thursday night  Staff very friendly made recommendations when asked  food excellent especially corn cob  Drinks good but perhaps bit expensive  happy hour though margaritas half price  waiters very attentive  Definitely looking forward returning! <EOR> Great place asked watch boxing very accomodating great food good music great atmosphere! come back again! <EOR> Ok tacos street corn salsa amazing! However approximately $21 00 person thought self service concept bit steep  Margarita $9 95  <EOR> Food pretty good Kung Pow Chicken bowl girl Baja Fish Tacos  Friday Night when bar only thing open  bartenders waiters drinks didn't great service since decided sit table  bar bill sitting while thinking going come give bill  Almost thought getting meal comp'd mean hey its Vegas   did food Margarita may again just sure when open full service  <EOR> The new destination Summerlin Hussongs kicks a**   Two things great service great food!  Scott Jeff extended groundbreaking venue Mandalay Place patio great vibe!  Staff friendly setup top notch won't disappointed  <EOR> Really enjoyed atmosphere place tried food amazing  habanero mango guacamole best guac ever had  set ordering seating very confusing noticed lot people left assuming would served  think place successful would need probably change   <EOR> What great local find! Great happy hour margaritas awesome  Loved tacos guacamole too  <EOR> Heard place decided lunch Monday afternoon  First when walked stood waiting someone say Hi even notice but did happen  Asked lady standing if she could seat she laughed said she hoping could she customer too  Finally saw sign counter headed way   Server counter said Hi then asked explain concept she did  Somewhat basically cafeteria  bar  order service counter then long stick number  then sit down  Some drinks come  bar some give before leave counter where also pay before leave there  Sat àt bar bartender served beer then counter person brought food tray took long stick number  Really felt very cafeteria  style  ordered steak nachos  worse but then again best  While bar kept noticing people kept walking just looking lost did   Probably returned experience anything worth second visit  concept would describe friendly warm even welcoming  <EOR> Let start off most important part review food  wife ordered array tacos ribeye taco Kung pow shrimp taco barbacoa taco chicken taco  Ribeye taco dry version carne asada  also mango habanero guacamole  flavor no hints mango taste regular guacamole  rest tacos greasy overpriced little seasoning  restaurant known inventing original margarita thought I'd give try  definitely want charge history margarita quite underwhelming  Now onto service  Number manager never checked see if food any good asked if first time Which replied yes was  order taker thinks speed equates service wife could understand thing coming mouth  food expediter didn't explain taco placed wife's napkin guacamole just walked off  Please waste your time restaurant  <EOR> I love location ambiance restaurant!  There's outside seating when weather nice cool late evening place sit eat relax    The food bad more Americanize Mexican food kinda reminds Baja grills   <EOR> Since learning Hussong's Cantina while Ensenada MX month ago visiting Original location opened 1892 fan place bar establishment   Finding another location Mandala Bay Vegas very exciting but driving through Boca Park seeing Hussong's old restaurant location previously visited more EXCITED!!   Walking Hussong's visible outside covered Patio location Bar Tops few 2 4 seating tables patio super big day when arrived somewhat empty but filled very quickly    Walking into restaurant quickly greeted hostess server asked if before  said no only Mexico  She then proceeded tell order food drinks walk counter would given table # Flag then could sit anywhere food drinks would brought out    *TIP sure tell staff when ordering would keep your tap open if want more drinks    We did order food but certainly ordered Original Margarita see if lived its Standard Mexico! Drinks Happy Hour Special 3 6pm M F    As sat patio drinks quickly severed certainly strong tasty! quite strong Mexico drinks however defense Mexico The food looked good certainly back try that! center bar located inside restaurant along few TV's which sports playing time    Again am fan overall happy place near Boca Park next Pink Berry Total Wine Spirits  <EOR> Located old Embers space Boca Park place offers no reason return   $10 2 tacos   need write more?  Ok   woman behind counter fast food akin Chipotle Cafe Rio told tacos very large   worth price    Not   carnitas taco flavorful fried avocado taco not   Neither large size street taco if familiar    yourself favor Cafe Rio Chipotle cheaper better   *I drinking didn't try best margarita town    Maybe  worth coming back for  <EOR> I don't often leave behind whole plate food paid look second restaurant dinner   exactly did Hussong's    My wife ordered chicken nachos steak tacos chips guacamole tried all salsas salsa bar    My wife only ate half steak taco three nacho chips two bites guacamole few dips salsa  Everything but chips terrible  chips just standard low end chips   The nachos chicken salsas summed phrase flavor? chicken something red doesn't quite taste tomatoes  fresca salsa something tasted tomatillo but much stronger  hotter salsas something reminded mole deep rich flavor clashed hard salsa  nachos combo whatever chicken gross something green no idea compare to    The steak tacos complete joke  Easily some lowest quality meat had  Even Mexican restaurant standards  weren't expecting filet ribeye but meat just pure gristle tendon  Totally unacceptable    Finally guacamole  might well bowl cilantro  much cilantro completely inedible both us  wife looked incredulously when called inedible   Sometimes when comes cilantro exaggerate bit  she took bite looked funny look face said wow you're right inedible  end  4 minutes beginning  still hungry walked away still full table terrible food   I lost $30 don't to  You're welcome  <EOR> 1st swear beans Hormel chilli    which just ew supposed Mexican place  Just no  Why? rice no flavor cilantro lime    Chipotle better   2nd margaritas awesome strong maybe drunk forget beans probably chilli can?   fo bar beans  steak tacos good but just couldn't over beans rice   yuck!
