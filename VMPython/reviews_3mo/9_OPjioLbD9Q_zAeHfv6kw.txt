The food alright  Meat quality selection pretty big but since first day  pretty crazy  servers couldn't keep services food kept running out  soup didn't much flavor   You certainly try but rather buy fresh seafood good meat eat home <EOR> I ordered spicy red curry soup which horribly plain add lot spicy oil salt myself little bit real soup! Vegetables fresh some them still frozen  Dipping sauce ok but definitely best quality  Lamb good  why gave them 2 stars  <EOR> The food good soup ordered fine spicy plane  seemed run some food lobster crab finally came more  very busy held service while better people leaving  Lamb great beef ok did chicken pork  price dinner $35 00 per person seems little high but all eat come hungry  <EOR> We found place through friends  Very popular since there's really lots hotpot options Vegas  decided give try red pot did let down  soup great!!

None vegetables labels nor did any seafood  selection meats very limited guess which fish balls getting because none them labeled  Secondly ordered spicy soup base only thing spicy bit spicy oil soup! Lastly but biggest problem food poisoning eating here  talked some friends least three other groups people ate diarrhea  Now love eating hot pot eat more three times week  enough experience know when meat cooked  left restaurant feeling severely overpaid dinner even sick !
