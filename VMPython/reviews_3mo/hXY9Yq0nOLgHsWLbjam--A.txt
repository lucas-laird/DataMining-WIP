All all Beso did hit mark absolutely did love it   reasons We decided hold company dinner newly opened Beso tonight 15 people many may aware corporations usually limit meals per diem case us   admin made clear staff when she made reservation   The first thing rubbed wrong way waiter very intent selling Imperial Shellfish Tower $79 personally told no thank but he kept talking!  told no thanks again he said ok check back later case change your mind talk pushy!    15 minutes later totally saw exact same waiter trying upsell Imperial Shellfish Tower different person party person said yes comes 5 Imperial Shellfish Towers   Um $400?  most expensive appetizer menu!  clearly told no   That cool   The 2nd thing 2 vegetarians group asked waiter provide vegetarian meal accommodate those party special needs   waiter returned said don't worry we'll bring 2 veggie specials chef fantastic create something delicious disappointed   whole table gets food except 1 vegetarians   waiting while bring large platter roasted carrots asparagus pita bread battered deep fried green beans mixed green salad some sliced cucumbers apples   First all dish weird mix mismatched vegetables secondly everything but green beans pita served cold!!!!  lukewarm room temperature just straight cold   mean seemed guy slapped together whatever non meat leftovers he kitchen sent us   truly huge horrible meal   Lastly kept serving bottled Voss water all night which ended being $10 bottle   I don't recall being asked if would prefer bottled vs  filtered tap water   The whole night staff seem very intent providing great experience overly attentive annoyingly so   kept mentioning over over    really want great experience    honestly never upscale restaurant obvious pushy upselling most expensive items menu just straight tacky   course blew through per diem staff Beso even cared   In end total bill over $1600 guess great experience = let's try squeeze much dough group possible   If food die wouldn't feel offended but ranged mediocre downright horrible   probably avoid place future very disappointing look forward having dinner high end restaurant pay high end price but short changed food jacked service   Especially economic climate   If ELP I'd pissed folks representing such classless money grubbing manner   Yuck!

Uh that'd no   That's where wonderful awfully helpful insert sarcasm Chad came over  he only came over because actually asked waiter where manager why he wasn't trying sooth things over us   Instead told expected service  Comped food steep discount free dessert coffee tea  least he competency guess some hope  BUT best part is  he wasn't telling us  poor waiter breaking news  Isn't manager's job?  The waiter trainee sweet trying help but honestly else do? think pretty much gave when knew much dinner going cut therefore reflecting tip  made sure compensated work  main tab? Aw hale naw   Took whatever discount gave us  Normally group would order 1 2 desserts share  Yeah call greedy bitter but each ordered one   sad thing is? Even dessert took 15 minutes come wasn't good   The star because waiter actually tried hard   Final report More style substance  <EOR> The potential there   they just haven't reached high point middle point yet   beautiful setting would expect place boasting Ms  Longoria's name   But salt does bad meal better   Beso 180 degree opposite Blossom http www yelp com biz blossom las vegas#hrid DjkOXY3XGSGMJsi5lx6vbw ARIA terms flavor   chefs should take turns each other's kitchens maybe sharing each other's secrets would help other out  <EOR> My wife looking place eat decided check Aria City Center We both mood nice steak asking around told Beso known great Steaks  When very nice accommodating even though hadn't made reservation ahead time able seat immediately  As soon sat down server Cherrie welcomed introduced herself us  She nice helpful wife wasn't sure she wanted drink since she doesn't drink very often Cherrie suggested couple different cocktails she ended having Sangria completely loved it  other hand asked see wine list very impressed nice selection   ordered glass Merlot also started off Guacamole Taqueria tasting which both excellent  Then Tortilla soup shared Cesar Salad  For main course wife filet bone Rib eye Oscar style shared side Truffle Smashed Potatoes Steaks ordered Medium rare came cooked perfection truth told best steak ever had  I going wife enjoy each other's company Beso really hit spot beginning end definitely back more  <EOR> Not big fan Hollywood location but Vegas location much better food service excellent   crowd cheesy but hey Vegas guys!
