Yes place open mere week before choose dining destination but if your gonna open Vegas better your shit together  tons casinos hotels restaurants doing things right way just copy paste  JS failed that  Three hungry dudes tapas should perfect match right? Wrong  food extremely forgettable worst item being recommended server overcooked lobster canned pineapple skewer  As unmemorable food service something forget  am convinced never saw waiter he wasnt working night gentleman kept having flag down gracious enough take orders but keep reminding he waiter   20 minutes being presented dessert menus someone returned ask would like  20 minutes ago wanted dessert now just want check  Perhaps place work kinks over time but ill let figure since plan never return  <EOR> Oh Boo Hoo eating well Las Vegas expensive  Once over sticker shock every nice restaurant Strip time start eating!
