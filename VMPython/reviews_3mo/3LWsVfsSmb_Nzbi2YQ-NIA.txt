While roaming streets LV craving some food homeland  some bad experiences lunch indian buffets past hopes pretty low   say vegetarian while many may love indian buffets great meat options usually am stuck two non appetizing vegetarian options  case here!! buffet huge! Filled half restaurant! food delicious!! Naan amazing Samosas die for! I ate 3 Korma almost fell chair! Even dal good! <EOR> Okay just don't hype  really excited mean Indian buffet good reviews sounds recipe success  okay    cheaper other places $9 99  But think would pay extra few dollars block over Mint heart beat  Yes buffet takes length wise over half restaurant but didn't care place lacked variety standard Tandoori chicken Tikka Masala etc   But maybe busy day before giving them benefit doubt but fish around sauce find pieces chicken only tikki masala but any dish which contained sauce meat  Don't wrong love sauce but find ample meat accompany sauce    Also something ambience felt cold maybe poor acoustics which made feel very big open but good way just set but somehow dining room overly inviting  Although itself something would normally concern hey if food superb eat sitting street corner as used case Viva Las Arapas before moved   Nonetheless thought something should noted    Service average nothing outstanding  did request garlic naan brought it  friend asked lemon wedges water forgot ask again then brought plate lime wedges salad bar   maybe don't lemons?   On upside free Mango Lassi which tasty Yelp check thank Delhi Indian Cuisine treat  overall wish them good luck hope all restaurants chains but unfortunately am going stay loyal Mint lunch buffet Mt  Everest second choice  <EOR> I craving Indian food came based recommendations yelp  place including bathroom very clean  staff super friendly nice  food excellent  tried everything buffet all tasty  especially loved goat curry but love curry general  when u sit sure ask garlic naan   searching saag paneer but displayed asked said run but made small bowl me  excellent well  buffet only available lunch temporarily close 3 5pm change dinner  think found Indian lunch buffet place  oh $10 which cheaper other places  I'd definitely back sure!!! <EOR> Good ambience good food  owner very nice staff reached 10 30 did rush over all good place eat Indian food <EOR> My family Indian food aficionados adore restaurant  food very Northern Indian so people India Masala more Southern style restaurants may crazy Delhi do flavors everything love Indian food few subtle delicious differences  Certainly standard Indian buffet  Highly recommend  <EOR> Fantastic always  decided mostly eat vegetarian dishes today  Saag paneer chana masala yellow dal  Mmmmm mmmm mmmm  fantastic  veggie Palau rice also incredible  favorite buffet appetizer samosas bread usual fluffy delicious  Today tried Chai Masala very impressed  overly sweet but just enough sweetness compliment tea  Thanks Delhi!!! <EOR> Good service  Nice selection  Flavorful  Generous naan portions  happy them  Reasonable price too  Strong competition India palace  <EOR> Just thinking place made hungry  It`s 11 PM probably late buffet  But anyway Vegas local frequent visitor Indian buffet most town  Yes crazy ! started going place 2 months ago gigantic biryani mango lassi chef specializes Mango lassi far am concerned! Fan ever since   First time buffet garlic bread mushroom fantastic mention chicken mutton  I feast no pun intended   Only regret day maybe  shouldn`t eaten much  But another 3 days regret vanished duly returned time another special variety chicken am blanking name but good if end just look sausage chicken roll it`s really good    When am going am probably going some other  Imagine embarrassment showing same buffet every other day ! say most them similarly priced probably similar food range but multiple sampling other indian buffets say more options maybe little bit cleaner definitely most spacious  town  would recommend anyone wants away ridiculously priced buffet big nightclub restaurants long indian food   As negative stuffs ambience could better mean could decorate walls little bit better play some decent music some upscale places Sometimes hard time catching demand supply thing but guess being new place its something work on And  yes sometimes just little extra oil floating around nan bread curries again something work  All all indian buffet it`s bang bucks  no don`t own place nothing against any other Indian buffets  <EOR> Four words bang your buck  $9 00 amazing food! when you're Vegas surrounded steak buffets offering powdered mashed potatoes great deal  place lacked ambience made taste  relatively new great culinary future ahead   The owner very sweet  He personally brought over free mango lassi checking delicious might add    If you're feeling your pockets empty because strip just darn expensive then hop over outskirts main vegas attractions scoop your desired heaps savory succulent mouth watering affordable Indian food  Seriously though go  <EOR> Wow      am still drooling over delicious indian food    must must try chicken biryani  mango lassi    place comfortably seated but food die for    oh samosas   owner very nice wanted sure fam friends enjoyed food    yes did always stop every trip vegas     <EOR> I once  Looking yelp best indian food option  Knowing places strip weren't worth prices but wondering other joints still offer good food good service nice atmosphere because hey you're vacationing Vegas don't need slumming some filthy ethnic place save $10 you'll just lose side bet anyways   Well answer  look any other reviews because New Dehli where want go   Just few months old slew positive reviews  great food mango lassi free your check MUST  pride staff owners put into restaurant apparent every detail restaurant  decor menu EXCELLENT service New Dehli comes mind for least when talk shopping local   restaurant saw visit owners truly care place  folks took space shopping center plenty parking! created truly sincere dining experience  Maybe something explain well  but if you'd understand swing New Dehli Thursday evening take experience  Never rooted hard restaurant city only visiting  <EOR> Lunch buffet awesome! Very large selection items vegetarian non vegetarian alike    Naan bread brought your table fresh oven no problem dried or missing naan buffet line some other places  if need another reason wolf down warm deliciousness   ask garlic naan mmmmmm won't sorry   We ended meal favorite things cup real chai tea $2 cup   If  never add your own sweetener which nice because adjust your liking and don't use real sugar if prefer artificial sweeteners    I would say best Indian buffets Vegas  left full happy without feeling heavy other buffets visited often overly oily items did not   also think quality selection items could actually charge couple dollars more still bargain  definitely back!  note owners wish offered some kind drink menu  only would customers would know kind drink options available purchase would also give your business opportunity additional revenue during lunch buffet time  <EOR> Went dinner delicious! Vegetarian Thali babe Butter Chicken  Thali came regular naan but ordered additional garlic naan both tasty  plenty leftovers much food! Service great really friendly  <EOR> This place opened two months ago hence doesn't appear google maps  But dont let into your way awesome north indian treat  owner n staff very polite attentive customers  food high quality priced reasonably  pick would traditional style chicken curry would recommend everyone  <EOR> Order food go    BEST CHICKEN CURRY!! new favorite place  love Indian food!! Glad place open!! waiting eat here  ambiance really nice well  Look forward trying buffet!! <EOR> Passing through Las Vegas found place Yelp! Amazing experience! Food fantastic fresh plentiful diverse each dish its own unique flavor  Staff friendly provided excellent service  establishment also clean well maintained       pass through without another visit! <EOR> I kinda another reviewer meant when she said buffet quite large yet lacked variety  Everything pretty great though love aren't afraid adding little bit heat buffet dishes most places avoid heat buffet items obvious reasons     I also thought garlic naan wonderful hot fresh kitchen  brought pretty late into meal which brings service  bad but little slow  Understandable haven't open long huge deal  Just looks might still working couple kinks perhaps?  I would definitely return buffet possibly dinner if mood strikes  <EOR>
