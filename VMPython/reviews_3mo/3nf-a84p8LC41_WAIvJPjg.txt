If wanted any those items simply would've ordered them  asked once order items but twice  pizza joint yet really felt going Olive Garden where pressured buy appetizer cocktail dessert order jack bill  Ridiculous    Now pizza   pizza mediocre best certainly snuff other Grimaldi's location too  Ordered large sausage pie but really light sauce cheese  actually sauce all over pie cheese well but cook just drizzled sauce then filled gaps cheese  other words entire pizza covered sauce cheese  Also usually put decent amount fresh basil pizzas but time  Maybe two small pieces basil entire large pie? Very disappointing result wife back location    I guess pay couple bucks more tryout Dom Demarco's across town  wife did order homemade tiramasu she said pretty good  5 dollars  1 other strange thing even know sit down restaurant does bathrooms??? also pretty serious turn off us  <EOR> I won't far say its best pizza ever but worth trip into maze mall   Solid food good bar great service  I mood pizza Vegas place highest rated why hell not   disappointed   Check out  <EOR> When sit bar catch glimpse afternoon fashion show   never tried NY version but maybe just great   wouldn't know   taste fresh ingredients know isn't your typical Domino's Pizza Hut   cheesy goodness well sauce   pretty good some Blue Moon but hey just normal standard bar food me   good  Just good quick bite  <EOR> Located inside Fashion Show mall   If open something location Fashion Show mall better prepared dish goods   Both locals tourists come your product keep business drive out   But Grimaldi's Pizza darn good     I friend when she smelled pizza air she all sudden wanted sit down eat   There's another pizza place California Pizza Kitchen which good well   But never Grimaldi's before decided sit down try out   come find we'll dining New York pizza   Chicago pizza curious see competes New York style pizza     We shared small white w garlic pizza $16 added mushrooms $2 pepperoni $2 artichoke hearts $4    $25 pizza split between two people bad all if you're saving money shopping   least 20 toppings your it   Secret good pizza however sauce cooking method   sauce delicious coal burning method love wood burning well worked perfectly   pizza delicious just don't know New York pizza   Service good but took long pizza come wasn't even busy inside   quick dine wasn't quick   Do come pizza! <EOR> Shopping other day stopped lunch   heard good things Grimaldi's curious   waiter very nice friendly   ordered large Mediterranean salad share   waiter kind enough inform small salad would plenty share two   also ordered small pepperoni pizza share   also smaller personal pizzas if want route   Wow dressing salad fantastic   looking around see if sold bottle take home   busy involved eating delicious salad forgot ask   Then pizza came     The small pizza definitely enough two share   best pizza ever had   No grease??
