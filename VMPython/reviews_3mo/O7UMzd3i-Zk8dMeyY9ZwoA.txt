Everything delicious down hot cocoa     We each also own two scoops gelato   requested mine waffle cone   hard decision which two but finally pear gorgonzola  coconut   I believe found new dessert spot   perfect gelato spot high quality ingredients   Oh awesome owners  <EOR> When Italy brother first trip but already third   While brother passionate art lover am abject ignoramus   did bide time while bro spending whole day various museums already to?  Yuppers guessed it gelato!!  fair enjoyed lots terrific coffee pasta also   But almost week Rome sampling countless flavors dozens gelaterias am kinda sorta gelato expert   trust when say gelato Art Flavors good any you'll find Eternal City   If can't quite swing airfare Roma just visit Art Flavors unless you're art lover then you'll pony ticket    First location   Yes divey area strip club across street dive bar half block away     Las Vegas Boulevard north Stratosphere ain't Via Condotti   But if you're worried your safety no need   uh un posh area might look perfectly safe   Cops cruise down Las Vegas Boulevard constantly  Crime issue here   parking limited front AoF but more spaces far end little strip mall AoF occupies   On important stuff gelato!  Wow can't say enough quality   lot places advertise serve gelato when really just fancy pants ice cream   Gelato less sugar butterfat air premium ice creams served higher temperature right around 32 degrees instead 10 20 degrees ice cream which means flavors come through more   Chef Desyree all flavors herself   Italian donut?  Yup she donuts scratch mashes them down then gelato mash   Same cinnamon rolls into cinnamon roll gelato   lemon curd into lemon meringue gelato   course all fruit sorbettos made fresh fruit   only ingredient think she doesn't scratch Oreo cookie crumbles cookies cream gelato   All work must difficult time consuming but Desyree won't settle less   She absolutely passionate quality gelato   other Yelpers mentioned staff wants sample interesting often very different flavors offer sweet corn avocado pepper chocolate   If you're curious flavor don't shy asking sample!  Whether gelato ice cream frozen custard Art Flavors best frozen dairy Las Vegas country mile   lot recommendations eating spots Las Vegas location dependent   example Burger Bar @ Mandalay Place inexpensive relative speaking Strip dining option   Would suggest if staying Tropicana?  Absolutely!  Staying Wynn?  Nah don't bother   But regardless where Las Vegas if love ice cream or case its Italian interpretation known gelato MUST Art Flavors!  Heck gelato good I'd drive St  George  <EOR> I don't seemingly shadier part town very often   all near intersection OG bail bond business alternative fashion shop where visited offer second opinion while stripper girlfriends shopping    But am glad came   Art Flavors definitely lived high praises offered thus far Yelp community   selection gelato sizable even compared other much better financed operations down Strip   thought process into developing making each flavor something taste final product behind display case   Chef Desyree very passionate products more happy let customers sample gelatos available   Feel free ask questions because she happy tell gelato made inspiration making it   foodie totally dig it!  Besides really good gelato Gelato Panini menu   something seen anywhere else yet try it   probably same concept tempura ice cream where batter cake layer shields ice cream melting during frying process   The hot chocolate also very good   flavor definitely water down very good once weather cools down coming weeks   Stop give gelato try  leave happier came in   *Amanda M just mentioned super great idea via Yelp compliments  Making Honey Toast Gelato Panini   Asia giant honey toasts already served gelato orice cream other fancy decorations chocolate cigarettes macrons square decorations would just easy adaptation millions already tried   Probability success High!  **New flavors regularly added come back again again new flavor surprises   Review milestone #400  <EOR> Stopped lunch Viva Las Arepas combo recommended those watching waistlines    When informed owner first time she gave several samples starting Flower Milk Fiore di latte then moving pistachio Italian doughnut others can't recall   My wife ended small cup pistachio Fiore di latte Italian doughnut   Both amazing   Everything made fresh high quality ingredients   My wife said gelato only she's ever experienced USA match best gelato she's Europe Italy Vienna Austria    place very serious competition Luv It Frozen Custard when you're area looking frozen treat  <EOR> Yeah legit gelato spot   5 stars never that   many crazy food flavors never seen before sweet corn gorgonzola cheese   would thought would even worth eating but awesome   lady working counter think also owner gave ton samples weren't even asking them   passion fruit because looking something sweet tropical evening   great    Fantastic place would love head back sure! <EOR> Gorgonzola pear sounds WORST gelato flavor ever exist   until try it   Holy crap now favorite flavor!  moldy cheese flavor paired sweetness pear fabulous   never seen flavor anywhere else  unique   can't wait try other random flavors   But if cheese flavored gelato isn't your thing also more traditional flavors pistachio chocolate chip strawberry etc   This definite must try if you're neighborhood! <EOR> All reviews don't lie! place killer! Let's just say if anyone comes says don't just ok   don't trust taste buds reviews anymore  P  They variety flavors change daily some them sound really strange  Flavors pear blue cheese avocado cucumber ginger sound weird but venture try them! Everyone super nice genuinely seems excited describe let sample different flavors  favorites chocolate sorbetto cioccolato which just downright amazing! Mix gelato's disappointed! also cupcake best ever had  Ridiculously good chocolate flavor super moist!
