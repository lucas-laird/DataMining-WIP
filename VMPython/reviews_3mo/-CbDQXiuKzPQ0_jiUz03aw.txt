Folded napkin fail  Outrageous prices  much hype *Must try call yourself Thai restaurant without Pad Thai!? almost saying Viet restaurant without pho  haha  okay yes exceptions  All dishes plated wonderfully! Tiaga shrimp* disappointing  Tempura style shrimp without tempura wrapped lumpia then tied crispy noodle  3 pieces  Garlic pork pepper* rice tasted meal Guppy House or equivalent taiwanese restaurant japanese rice fried egg top  Almost fancy Big Wongs  Few salty pork bits much rice  Garlic pieces hard almost rocks  More let down bc must try  Beef panang alright  beef cut CUBES sliced  Inconsistent texture some tender others hard  Curry could creamier more coconut  Unique lychee curry! Great combination! 1st time successful  Sweet balanced spice  I'd stick Ping Pong Thai down street Thai     Friendly service  Free thai tea Yelp Check in!! Homemade soy sauce! Excellent! salty hint sweetness  Can't say much other foods serve but judging plating sure sushi presentation amazing  <EOR> When heard new restaurant town fusion Thai Japanese really excited try it!  Both favorite cuisines together wow!  Well finally yesterday   write review   walked 12 00 only other person dining   place completely empty during lunch hour!  does tell you?  ordered Thai Beef Salad Cognac Duck Garlic Pork Pepper Rice Bowl   server said Beef Salad huh?  at 12 00 afternoon??    didn't know if Beef salad greens?  any event ended ordering Steamed Cod   OMG!  Cognac Duck tasty but portions really small only 7 8 small bites duck   Garlic Pork very tasty seasoned ground pork all mixed bowl rice egg top    appealing eye fried rice bowl   kept biting into something really small hard I think fried garlic something hopefully wasn't fragments small pieces bone    afraid going crack tooth   steamed cod absolutely horrid   definitely frozen cod probably defrosted before steaming possibly freezer steamer   rubbery chewy   would sent back but decided because server nice   took trashed when home   price all three $39 00   didn't want order sushi because fish really fresh sick easily   Since nobody during lunch rush figured food isn't moving quickly raw fish might kind old   Didn't want chance it   guess restaurant won't year  <EOR> Just first order via eat 24 app  First off caterpillar roll yum  Then grilled duck separated rice meat being delivery  Duck cooked good sushi amazing love fact sushi came eel sauce instead soy sauce proves least try pair sushi sauces  Love that  Thai iced tea finished meal only reason didn't give 5 stars minimum delivery 20 which meal came 19 change order Thai iced tea good but overall place gets 4 1 2 stars just can't give rating  <EOR> Excellent presentation   Pleasant atmosphere   Comfy chairs   Unique menu flavorful healthy Thai Japanese favorites some unique offerings   wasabi comes shaped leaf   One itty bitty teeny tiny paper napkin     <EOR> I hate leave bad review but to   because really sick eating bad sushi! I've meaning try place since very close work love Japanese Thai food couldn't wait try  nicely decorated modern touch  good start! Can't complain anything atmosphere ambiance  took gf during lunch only 2 tables occupied weren't busy all  should've first hint order anything raw but craving sushi  gf ordered salmon terriyaki bento sushi bento  gf frowned soon she took first bite  salmon frozen since chewy old fish smell it  Onto food   my 5 nigris weren't bad first except rice undercooked  also crepe cake desert since looked appertizing but taste wasn't impressive all  bought groupon wanted use but waitress said can't use groupon any lunch special  Little disappointed but no big deal  come back use something later thought   I started feel nauseated night sure enough many trips toilet! X Luckily over without much more problems other feeling lethargic couple days   I really concept modernizing Japanese Thai fusion food but execution isn't just there! service nice waitress seemed owner wanted fullfill American Dream  wish best wish improve fix things quickly! Otherwise afraid place won't around long  Wish call Ramsey them    Wish well Taiga! <EOR> This place far McCarron Airport  pretty good menu some items having fusion flair  first visit ordered Salmon soy sauce dipping sauce  rice good which contained edamame corn  second visit ordered tonkatsu which also good  way home made soy sauce which good too  But thing must try crepe cake thai ice tea sauce     WOW!! owner place Crystal very nice too  Can't wait back <EOR> Short Review great place lunch date business lunch 1 3 other people  quite few lunch specials cost $10 per person    Longer Review Resturant currently located Sunset Corporate Center next tattoo shop paintball store  super easy miss entrance if don't look hard  However once plenty parking front back    The sign outside reads Japanese Thai Food but when walk atmosphere eclectic 1800's living room combined pan Asian bistro  music consisted jazz renditions billboard top 100 kitchen which plain view added burst white grey black dominated dominated environment    The menu which nice 3 ringed binder good assortment food options  lunch menu straight point made quick ordering  food inexpensive drinks $1 Thai Iced Tea nice!     The food presentation fantastic combined flavor far exceeded price  Absolutely worth money then some  tried Spicy Chicken Ramen Noodles Teriyaki Beef Bento Crispy Pork Rice Bowl  Ramen good but oily when cools down sticks together  Teriyaki Bento excellent came soup salad white rice two pieces California roll sushi and broccoli    The Crispy Pork Rice Bowl surprised me    came pieces fried pork large fried egg cooked medium too  best those three sure  Lots flavor came same sides bento box minus extra rice    Overall experience ok  place would bring family isn't place would often  food great but atmosphere confusing  chairs super comfortable but won't long enough really enjoy them  <EOR> I tried everything menu must try next it  poki cod green tea Thai crepes amazing! Friendly service cozy ambiance  must try fusion restaurant  <EOR> With groupon hand arrived around 1245 lunch OG Ryan B    The restaurant quite cute albeit small  plethora lunch specials but since those weren't available use Groupon didn't bother perusing them thoroughly    I decided sashimi salad side Tom ka soup  dining companion ordered chicken katsu  check in offer free Thai tea if check in Yelp Facebook although skipped time   The sashimi seemed fresh salad pretty good portion  soup spicy flavorful good portion shrimp it  Ryan B enjoyed meal quite bit well overall price wasn't bad  look forward trying pace again soon take advantage lunch specials seem food value  <EOR>
