Now burger joint nachos quite different good but weren't mind blowing  would change cheese cheddar nacho  <EOR> I don't know where start      First all everyone work very friendly patient over menu us  bacon cheese fries off hook secret dipping sauce little kick but over powering milk shakes also delicious!! Now burgers off hook  couldn't even finish burger because big!! definitely returning try something else menu!! 5 start across board!! <EOR> Chocolate chip cookie shake excellent big scorcher burger cooked perfectly heat perfect meat slightly pink juicy  Waited Johanna friendly informative  would definitely recommend place  <EOR> I usually put burgers into three categories  Fast food $6 10 gourmet $10 17and high end $18+  compare them other burger places Holsteins Gordon Ramsay compares very nicely while being tad bit cheaper those burgers  lunch very quickly between office lunch hours  definitely back try other burgers but standard American burger very enjoyable while service impeccable  <EOR> The portions huge! Elizabeth waitress little absent minded  She said she'd back water then drifted asked if we'd some water  might few staffing issues going new place  oink squeal moo burger frenchie burger bacon cheese fries  Each burger decadent overwhelming  good  more expensive places better burgers but good first impression  <EOR> The service amazing food amazing  looking something easy somewhat inexpensive  wings two milkshakes shared bacon egg cheese burger  Perfect portions! service best far Vegas!!!    In love!! <EOR> I understand rather busy inside bustling little burger joint  Every seat seemed filled worried may take bit however rather quickly  server took order smile even made recommendations request she right California Chicken rather delicious  Well seasoned though pretty heavy handed mayo  But would ever  pleased even mayo drenched chicken sammy if horrible service  Though server greeted smile took order quickly never saw again   until card out  She forgot beverage  Water   which isn't just given anyway most places? isn't even though she asked someone else deliver me  No  She happily avoiding me  tried three times attention but no avail  stop someone ask them please give some water  thought she would come back offer lemon requested even straw   nothing fancy just basics  But no  Again stop someone  When someone else came food sans sauce ordered thought she would come table check  Nope  stop someone else  When pulled card placed table   guess showed up?! think she even asked meal went? Ha! NO! She ran card gave receipt again never heard from  When finished dash AGAIN stop someone else ask them box  Without doubt worst service EVER HAD  all all overpriced mayo drenched sandwich absentee server    no thanks  would rather take business elsewhere if going chase down things ordered piece piece  Save your money Subway across way least interact you    Sincerely Invisible Patron <EOR> Out all Italian restaurants Venetian chose eat here   and am glad! hostess convinced into eating PrimeBurger adorable sweet very convincing good job! server wish remember name helpful funny easy talk attentive courteous  He actually excited ordering  best friend each spiked milkshake   what awesome idea! friend Nutella shake which some kind Irish liquor believe incredibly rich tasted creamy Nutella smeared all over glass   delish  oreo banana peanut butter spiked milkshake  Heaven   absolute heaven  can't even put into words creamy delicious flavor explosion drink!! Really hit spot perfect  appetizer split buffalo fries  thought such awesome unique simple idea never heard of  Fries covered hot sauce bleu cheese dipping sauce bleu cheese crumbles  Tasted amazing definitely filling  thought hot sauce fries would less filling lol but theFries very very filling  ordered Frenchie burger without bun still very filling  burger came Swiss cheese Gruyere cheese my favorite lettuce dijon mustard  best burger ever but definitely REALLY good really different  Come empty stomach! Loved here  <EOR> Ordered 2 burgers between 2 friends both feel apart   buffalo fries terrible  Don't them  Although cheap Vegas prices worth it  Better off going In N Out  <EOR> A bit disappointing  wait staff very slow hardly anyone restaurant  burgers smaller expected  looked much patti melt less beefy burger  scorcher which billed hot but much flavor jalepenos sauce could taste burger <EOR> Was little upscale burger place last night few friends  Wow!   the banana shake AMAZING!   burger very juicy tasty!   not greasy   their variety very creative  Rhonda waitress she's just nice! <EOR> Amazing burger  sure best burger town  allredy twice  Realy good professional service  Soft bun all fresh ingredients  expensive all  <EOR> Your typical gourmet burger joint Vegas overpriced  Located inside Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes say owned same folks Johnny Rockets use fresh prime Angus beef  never frozen  buy not   who knows?  FYI menu very combo friendly  order burger does come any fries  order fries separately burger only comes pickle slice small cherry tomato    Anyways Cali Club burger brioche bun I'd say definitely better boutique burgers before  burger very dry didn't special sauce typically accompanies burgers  Maybe overrated having avocado burger  Sounds better paper tastes  bite friend's 21st Century burger much better  fried egg 21st Century gave distinct unique taste quite delicious   We orders fresh cut fries $4 50 tower onion rings $9   fan fries  If small skinny fries something you'll love  However fan onion rings   really big crispy  great ranch  If you're fan spicy even ask spicy ranch   The service pretty bad  Yes only open few months but servers did know doing  She messed drink order food took FOREVER come out   might understatement  mention all came different times  1 burger came then order fries then another burger then onion rings etc   Whatever request waitress ask multiple times     Tough gourmet burger crowd Vegas nowadays  price paid I'd rather Gordon Ramsey's BurGR even Shake Shack  definitely pay high price convenience  <EOR> stopped quick bite amazed great prime burger was  Nothing fancy but did disappoint  <EOR>
