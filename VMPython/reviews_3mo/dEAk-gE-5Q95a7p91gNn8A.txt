Thank you  <EOR> I love place! food just delicious! cant resist place! always come back more! <EOR> This place new Brian's Beach which located spot beforehand  sign may still say Brian's Beach but owner said replacing sign soon    This located southwest corner Flamingo Durango facing east west side shopping center    Hours 11 30 AM 4 00 PM lunch 4 00 PM 11 30 PM dinner 11 30 PM 3 00 AM late night  prices quite average terms all eat sushi restaurant lunch dinner standing $21 95 $25 95 respectively   Upon entrance restaurant greeted both waitress staff well owner sushi chefs  Service phenomenal  place seems remodeled redesigned opinion actually looks better    I taken seat sushi bar sitting directly front owner sushi chef  Heres little background owner  He used head chef sushi restaurant located Fashion Show called RA Sushi  During many conversations owner told he quite restricted management sushi made  proud sushi chef something he could put considerably lower own standards sushi making  he decided take over location start own sushi restaurant   Now food    My plan try fishes nigiri favorites when comes sushi  sweet fresh taste different types seafood quite experience if its something handle some people cant eat raw foods   informed chef owner new shipments fishes delivered daily freshest fish when come eat restaurant    I started experience order tuna white tuna yellowtail  record time finished meal tried most nigiri least once  tasting first 3 orders surprised quality fish prepared  Very fresh sweet    One little nitpick while eating chef owner tends put various sauces yum yum? ponzu? toppings sushi  he said lot people but personally ok  But slight notice he reduced amount sauces toppings nice he listened  mean wasn't bad most part quite experience example having slice chili top yellowtail nigiri  interesting liked eating spicy foods well  different experience    I told chef fish eater first 3 orders he took into command made various dishes me  Most meal made without ordering  Most vary tasty delicious    In terms nigiri favorites probably white tuna yellow tail salmon sweet shrimp scallop  All very fresh naturally sweet nice thick cut if applicable   sweet shrimp quite large used to  But name implies really sweet    There few things i'd mention may see typical sushi restaurant or any to   Under appetizer listing brie grape quesadilla  sashimi roll Let's start off brie grape quesadilla   Seeing item menu surprised me  something usually see japanese restaurant  But suggested super nice waitresses  tried it  When order came presented few triangle slices well few avocado slices fanned side  Fresh off pan grill whatever used it  taste quite interesting  brie smooth rich while slices grape gave nice acidic kick    The sashimi roll quite interesting item  contains tuna yellowtail white fish salmon shrimp avocado asparagus wrapped thin daikon radish previously soaked special vinegar  much fan sauces drizzled plate but aside pickled daikon radish plus various fishes gave quite interesting taste  freshness fish + slightly sour but refreshing taste pickled daikon wrapped quite nice    All all good experience would love again    This restaurant definitely ranks top 3 sushi restaurants at time posting    Sushi Twister Goyemon other 2 restaurants ranking  staff chefs super nice  Did very little no asking very wouldnt say annoying but uhm   guess attentive may correct word? no more 1 2 finished plates side before picked rarely if ever saw bottom tea cup always refilled timely manner  <EOR> **Summary** Best start saying new place sushi  Freshness usually half nigiri half sushi rolls but tasting first piece sushi first night all nigiri night  definitely some freshest sushi tasted side Mojave Desert  Next Level All nigiri own little touches  salmon lemon wedge yellowtail thin slice jalapeno sweet shrimp sprinkle sea salt splash lemon juice  little things take ordinary nigiri dishes next level  Creative ask sushi chef create something you'll see why chose name place sushi freak  salmon cornflakes top delicous  Expertise ex head chef RA Fashion Show opened restaurant 3 weeks ago bringing some freshest fish suppliers  Waiting List place very small I'd suggest calling ahead going off peak hours  Trust worth extra effort  There's reason people waiting outside seat  Brian's Beach use Brian's
