Let's begin shall we?  Beer first!  name 'Firkin' would think would cask ale google it!    Unfortunately no cask ale although told bartender woman appeared manger working getting cask ale   am hopeful Firkin join ranks Todd English Pub Public House establishments serve cask ale and hopefully serve properly      The beer selections mostly English ales few them being mediocre Newcastles Guinnesses UK   selection fine craft beer suffers expense bar's theme suppose   did Firestone Walker Union Jack Double Jack Dogfish Head 60   enjoyed Innis Gunn Rum Cask ale   also 10 rotating seasonal self serve taps things kind fun!  Watch though because beers range $6 8 piece although deals Newcastles   Overall beer selection great Vegas bars but disappointing compared likes Aces Ales Khoury's Fine Wine Spirits   am fine considering crappy beer served most Vegas pubs Hofbrauhaus across street   On really loved food!  ordered house French Dip $11 95    bad price tourist place   roast beef really juicy onions grilled perfectly touch horse radish baguette bun amazingly delicious french dip!  tried bite friend's curry although little sweet taste full flavor quite delicious   perfect french fries lightly battered yet still light fluffy   Very good food affordable price returning customer!  The atmosphere nice social no slot machines which plus book   Lots TV's   staff very friendly although somewhat lacking beer knowledge   expect staff educated place evolves   promised addition cask ale exciting   would see them hire Cicerone also knows cask beer www ukbrewing com FAQ!   <EOR> Definitely great new British Pub add Eastside   Located across Hofbrahaus place very unique its atmosphere but more importantly great food! service great offer food very reasonable price large portions   Very worth short drive <EOR> Came friday evening 8 30 till 10 00 few people sitting bar two dudes playing pool  much action anyone got  surprised see empty friday eve some disappointed   I believe reason why dead non smoking bar guess sucks fun drinking if your smoker  Any friend 3 drinks 2 sandwiches totaling $49 60 certain worth it    Overall still cool joint neat concept  bartenders friendly quick service beer cocktails good  music ranged STP Soundgarden Cypress Hill which thought good selection type bar but just need some more people coming through doors joint kicking  Look forward coming again drinks some pool hopefully it'll packed rockin' then  <EOR> As local loves good beer nice establishment especially places smoke free new bar pub wonderful   anyone works at near UNLV University district waiting place this   Firkin twice past 5 days   thoughts   First things first beer   great selection draft beers wide range tastes   Tuesdays 2 1 pints which great special!!
