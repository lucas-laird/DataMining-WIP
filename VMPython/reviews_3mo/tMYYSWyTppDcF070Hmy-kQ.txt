Love Downtown Summerlin always looking new favorites   this made list  <EOR> I lurking social media appointment girlfriend agreed stop here  near DT Summerlin decided come here   First thing saw Rancher sold immediately  Continued look but couldn't resist  entered restaurant greeted nicely everyone  Felt good homely  Noticed very open space nice big windows very retro classy 50's theme? Correct if wrong yo  Lol   Looked menu very easy read but hard break decision Rancher although classic special sauce wondering was   Temptations rised but stuck plan  PBR along Rancher  girlfriend decided Cheesy    One?

Hope words could help anyone interested   Peace! <EOR> #chickfila please come save #lasvegas   food looked better tasted   Just personal opinion   Clean cool store <EOR> After all hype expectations pretty high  word    BLAND  Hyped dry absolutely tasteless chicken  Tasteless corn side dish  Tasteless mashed potatoes gravy  good thing mask tastelessness sauces provide each table  Ready more bad news? French fries pretty good  prices INSANE  $60 wife baby  $60 water drink total 4 chicken tenders 3 wings  upside French fries okay   Raising Cane's probably better alternative every level   It's better McDonald's which why didn't star  another reviewer noted skinny French fries pretty good  should change name Blue Ribbon French Fries  <EOR> Ate last night  Attractive place friendly staff  However food disappointing  crispy crunchy chicken described website home page  tenders no crunch all  seasoning interesting but anything I'd want again  choices only tenders wings thighs surprising  breasts drumsticks?  When back line discovered NYC location plus several other sides offered here  feel cheated maybe better NYC location but won't come back one   others said way expensive get  <EOR> Overpriced tasteless food! seems all reviews fake  Eg five star review phrase always cooked perfection?! Mediocre covers it  <EOR> Best fried chicken ever had! skin crispy theirs super! mom says reminds chicharone  well seasoned very flavorful  wife both agree tastes similar Mexican seasoning Taijin  long eat fresh fryer don't even need sauces which few intersting ones choose all honey based  favorite honey based I believe habenero  2 boneless thighs came much fries still left overs Saturday  skinny seasoned just right  soda fountain wasn't typical  flavors black cherry cream soda  Reminds younger days  wasn't  normal sit down but attendant gave excellent service  He already knew needed sometimes even before knew lol! long place consistent  no more incidents picture another yelper  then would highly recommend place stay loyal patron  <EOR>     Nothing more overly priced fast food joint!   My Hub where looking forward eating hearing all hype complete letdown!   Dry bland tasteless chicken  Side dishes where subpar  variety dipping sauces ALL tasted sweet icky  Boasting offering real cane sugar fountain drinks tasted weird   I really wanted try milkshake but $6 would considered small size cup said forget it!   The prices absolutely ridiculous!   like already mentioned above^^^ $18 50 6 chicken tenders?!?!  $14 10 wings?!? $8 large sides?!?   The only thing decent gravy fries!  which would eat again          that until home couple hours later bed doubled over cramps running back forth bathroom doing know what!   Forget place   I never back! <EOR> Way overpriced fast food would rather Chick Fil A  Also wife both touch food poisoning immediately eating sore stomachs rest night  Won't back! <EOR> Um   this seriously BEST FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH EVER HAD   Chik Fil A ain't nothing Blue Ribbon   Crispy fried batter + delicious seasoning + juicy tender chicken = perfect  Also restaurant super clean service really friendly own soda! Fries crispy    Cole slaw light crunchy    Pickles aren't overly salty    *Tip chipotle honey!!!!* <EOR> Gave 3 stars because wasn't impressed  food pretty good but came just warm hot  mainly wanted come eat smorgasbird double decker chicken sandwich basically every topping haha  I side loaded large fries staff really friendly but just thought food would better  <EOR> The highlights  trash compactor creme soda    otherwise complete waste time! <EOR> The service buoyed rating three everyone very friendly helpful  Food though just so  breading same all chicken lots paprika chili others spices EXCEPT salt  breading itself super crispy which book minus  slaw bit dry  did think fries good though  shoestring cut    The price totaled over $32 lunch which fairly pricey however potions huge could gotten sharing meal which would made reasonable    I agree others Raising Canes much better  <EOR> Extra star decor  Mediocore taste chicken  Ok tasting fries overpriced overall due location  No soap restroom also spotless clean  Average tasting soda <EOR> Great experience all around!! restaurant spotless order  service incredible fast food joint very unexpected  Jay especially helpful attentive all guests he refilled drinks cleared tables constantly!! Well done Jay!  We Chicken Wings Mashed Potatoes Gravy French Fries  All delicious!! Highly recommend Wings huge juicy cooked just right  <EOR> Flavors ok but just everyone's gripe price prepared break bank hidden chicken joint!  Came empty restaurant around 4pm caught off guard would've thought would big rush? guess worked well favor seeing time order eating would probably greatly increased if packed   I girlfriend ordered 2 piece dark combo blue ribbon chicken sandwich sweet tea   The girl behind cash register said $25 dollars straight face said would take 15 minutes  swiped card proceeded grab seat desolate dining area  When buzzer finally rang seemed lifetime walked counter   I ordered dine yet still received nicely designed paper bag logo guess advertise 10 foot walk counter table? sat down opened bag yet pull another paper bag containing food soaked grease  portions delightfully small terms actual chicken cole slaw yet swamped skinny fries screaming much salt  chicken decent seasoning bit salty crunch yet just lacking proper amount price  All sauces offered horrendous besides habanero sauce oh good   Read tip sweet tea over priced falsely advertised  Also didn't order but did notice $5 pints PBR! Seriously? buy lifetime supply PBR price   All all flavors just ok nothing screamed come back more specially place specializing chicken? Step your game Blue Ribbon maybe come back!  see why place empty now  walk next door Public School instead  <EOR> First things first expensive fried chicken   friend ordered two chicken tender combo upgraded fries loaded BBQ chicken sandwich   bill totaled around $25 which ridiculous   food good but $25 good   chicken juicy flavorful but tenders little chewy   fries pretty good but really worth $2 upgrade loaded fries   If care bacon use much better quality fast food restaurants!  Probably could used more cheese though   The sandwich fried chicken cheese bacon sauce pretty standard   bun super soft which think rounds sandwich price around eight bucks    added just little more BBQ sauce because messy BBQ sandwich   would order if returned   I love soda options mmm    creme soda! but again expensive!!!  Long story short way expensive frequently visit but chicken sandwich great   would visit again if friend really wanted because hadn't visited yet  <EOR> Fried chicken amazing!! Best place cure fried chicken craving if want something more churches Popeyes  Don't let $8 lunch fool lot food!! <EOR> I just tried chicken sandwich  all could afford lunch $8 no drink no side fries coleslaw just chicken sandwich good tried all sauces love honey chicken! But sad  expensive saw two piece comes fries coleslaw $9 75 no drink wasn't willing spend much lunch place clean service good  just bit pricey  <EOR> As far crispy chicken sandwiches place turns very solid one  Buns great breading light sauces great  Loved each table squeeze bottles flavored honey the wasabi honey surprise favorite BBQ sauce    I original Blue Ribbon sandwich $6 50 think   combo fries coleslaw additional $2 50  serving fries very generous shoestring cut very crispy  coleslaw quite bit vinegar it  love slaw but wasn't personal fav    The dining room nice inviting really clean  young guy brought silverware offered refill sodas 5 star employee   Cool trashing compacting garbage cans something yet see elsewhere  solid 4 stars  <EOR> I stopped into Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken few drinks Downtown Summerlin  Let's just start extremely modern inside  However then saw prices  food WAY overpriced even area  paid $12 sandwich  came sides but did come drink  portions average  You're paying more    Overall food okay  wasn't McDonalds level  But something would keep coming back for  Service saved review  <EOR> Spending $43 chicken fingers chicken sandwich couple beers you'd expect bit more   wasn't bad but nothing write home about  Staff friendly  Definitely done  <EOR> Items Selected Nutella Vanilla Caramel Shakes Hush Puppies Smorgasbird Lettuce Cucumbers Tomatoes Chicken Cutlets Pineapple Slices Pickles Fries Sour Cream Cheddar Cheese Bacon Sauteed BBQ Chicken Pickled Peppers 2 Strips 2 Wings Adobo Corn Collards Bacon  Founded Bromberg Brothers featuring duo's first foray into 'burbs Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken arrived Downtown Summerlin way New York earlier summer although quick casual concept questioned high prices well uneven cooking ever since opening friend child sat down lunch Saturday almost every off putting rumor soon confirmed   Nicely lit well adorned amenities including motion sensing trash compactors LCD televisions housemade sauces plus fountain featuring artisan sodas Boylan's visit Blue Ribbon begins counter smiling servers dining decisions largely sandwiches combos sides additional options shakes salads plus single tenders wings thighs   Taking note few specials August only Smorgasbird portion proceeds benefiting  Multiple Sclerosis offered addition perplexingly priced hush puppies $3 75 half dozen $7 95 ten some perusal order soon completed fifteen minute wait those vibrating flashy buzzers spent sitting several unpadded booths   Certainly cheap meal total before tax tip north $55 would prove less enough sate family four three excellent pieces egg bread wrapped around charitable sandwich largely matter principle Smorgasbird ordered two boneless cutlets spiced quite unlike Bromberg chicken Blue Ribbon Brooklyn Bowl suffice say each piece almost dry its own enjoyable better bites found barbequed bits serve atop cheesy fries tinged peppers while anemic looking tomatoes made question sourcing during ingredients peak time year   Finding tenders oddly spiced devoid moisture cutlets while wings least maintained texture thanks presence bone onward sides meal progressed although hushpuppies each quite small flavors sweet corn thankfully prominent same said soft collards barely bolstered pork let alone 'adobo corn' which certainly would benefited greatly some salt   At point seeing emperor lack clothes while wondering why duo opts change chicken each venue when original version earned them such acclaim trio shakes meal concluded although none particularly innovative each clearly crafted good ice cream vanilla trending bit thin mellow while Nutella caramel decidedly sweet thick enough stick spoon straight   Overpriced overseasoned little more 'name' justify hype Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken joins likes most Downtown Summerlin's imported eateries situation wonder just long public continue bite  <EOR> My daughter stopped try new spot downtown Summerlin quick meal  fairly new business anxious try DTS posted amazing yummy looking photo Instagram earlier day made mouth water   I ordered Blue Ribbon chicken sandwich known for which felt really overpriced approximately $6 79 made combo which included fries cole slaw drink add another $2 50   daughter ordered kids meal which chicken tender fries over $5  given pager would tell when food ready  found prices bit high fast food joint   We walked over soda machine which way own soda which cane soda   daughter chose root beer which neither really liked  found table sit probably three tables people sitting eating  noticed sauces table which would learn would need use order give chicken any taste   Our food arrived ten minutes delivered staff very nice  excited try sandwich decided try honey chipotle sauce  took first bite immediately disappointed  really no flavor chicken even special sauce honey chipotle  bun soft veggies fresh but better chicken sandwiches elsewhere!
