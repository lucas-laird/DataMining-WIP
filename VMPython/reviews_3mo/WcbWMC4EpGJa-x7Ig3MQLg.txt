Yes   Chef also convinced try cold dessert     I asked called which he responded cold dessert  quite good spongy cake soaked rum sauce I think topped whipped cream cherry   Hubby ate most stuffed   Portions large prices reasonable enough service fine although may want engage chef food talk really smiling   We'll come again soon try other types hummus  <EOR> The hummus amazing! made fresh when order it   falafel also made fresh order very light!!! cilantro hummus fave! best part relish bar  Amazing little salads  even work party catered them   price very reasonable everyone enjoyed food especially honey balls  Please ask owner chef he prepares chicken  Long process which chicken tender  <EOR> My husband lunch today delight  Everything made fresh   chicken beef humus tabouli     husband garlic concoction owner made   Absolutely great own pita bread  Excellent  desserts yummy   Can't wait back <EOR> We checked Hummus Bar back August courtesy LivingSocial coupon hesitant write very first review   wasn't even Yelp yet!  think time   I ordered hummus falafels   First off hummus  really good smooth creamy tasty   very tasty   mistake getting falafels   came order five dipping sauce   no falafel expert but share freshly made falafels far it   dried possibly frozen even!  horrified!  But should known better because place called Hummus Bar all Falafel Bar   stick hummus! came cucumber tomato onion salad which fresh   momentarily forgot pita bread stuck wondering heck going eat hummus   The Husband some skewered meat pita which he thought just okay well   He admitted he should stuck hummus too   The free accompaniments nice addition just help yourself pickled goodies   The additional sink outside restroom also helpful!  Service few yelpers mention friendly staff quite didn't impression when went   Actually Husband mentioned cold indifferent staff would agree   Overall when first opened think probably improved since then   looks may related Panini Cafe next door  more sit down restaurant   Hummus Bar very casual space   I'd back   just hummus course! <EOR>
