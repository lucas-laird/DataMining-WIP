food menu seafood however other proteins also offered such pork chicken lamb steak   appetizers party ate dungeness crab cake geoduck clam served sashimi style well fried   dungeness crab cake along accompanying sauce tasty yet nothing made stand other dungeness crab cakes elsewhere   geoduck clam served sashimi style plated block ice   portions thinly sliced neatly garnished   geoduck fresh its flavor natural geoduck flavored other spices additional flavoring     For main courses Tasmanian Ocean Trout Australia baked sea salt artichoke olive arugula   trout seemed slightly rare very center but outside beautifully cooked   skin crisp added excellent flavor texture each bite   trout accompanied two different sauces spooned across plate both great compliments protein   Careful attention paid plating vegetables came trout   most restaurants plating sides often ignored but artichokes neatly lined separated arugula other vegetables   texture vegetables diverse   artichokes soft arugula natural small leaves interior head lettuce crispy   All all wonderful dish     For side dishes party sweet potato puree marshmallows well caramelized cauliflower truffle gratin   sweet potato puree marshmallows fantastic   sweet smooth incredibly flavorful  caramelized cauliflower truffle gratin excellent too   caramelized flavor dominated but overpowering   cauliflower nice moderate slightly creamy texture   would recommend both sides   Overall food excellent   All dishes flavorful   Plating detailed clean artistic   portions smaller side but par course nowadays fine dining restaurants however food moderate richness which filling despite lack sheer quantity   Also everything plates edible   forgot which dessert party ordered but came mint leaf   Upon first glance mint leaf appeared only visual aesthetic garnish but cooked crispy sugared   obvious Michael Mina put great attention detail into all food just main courses its presentation plating   Very well done   SERVICE Service excellent   Maitre d's very attractive friendly   Waiter knowledgeable courteous very friendly   Dishes cleared until everyone party finished   Water refilled routinely servers minimized water splash using fabric napkin shield table splatter when ice falls into your cup    movements smooth controlled lackadaisical   entire staff very professional   ATMOSPHERE The majority restaurant dimly lit which great night time romantic atmosphere   front restaurant partially open small lounge   small section restaurant's dining tables located front restaurant windows allowing look restaurant into walkways outside although view nothing spectacular just another restaurant across way   best places sit probably main back area dining room because may look into kitchen   entire kitchen viewable through huge glass windows facing main dining area   watch chefs prepare your food   kitchen modern neatly kept visual pleasure view   Pop music plays low moderate level restaurant   would describe overall noise level restaurant low easy carry conversation without raising your voice   OVERALL *Excellent food taste presentation concept  *Excellent service *A relaxing dim fairly quite atmosphere    *Pricey *Modest portions <EOR> We ended looking over most menus Aria  First Aria   holy crap really amazing beautiful  Natural elements combined top notch craftsmanship design highest order place sight see Vegas  Made everything else seem tacky  know stretch   So chose American Fish based price mere fact all wanted fish  place bathed low light birch trees set behind bar  Service top notch attentive yet pushy server  She handed menus wood  Yes wood  cool   went along whole natural elements theme Aria shared everything space  Started cocktails very interesting menu  drink called The Drink No Name   All alcohol drink slow  fellow diners all enjoyed cocktails well  order poached salmon  menu offered poached grilled salt baked other but can't remember  liked interested varied  back salmon  Cooked perfectly surrounded light saffron broth filling just right size  also ordered sides cauliflower gratin pommes frites  Both perfect accompaniment  Wish could follow dessert but passed gelato bar way imperative saved room  would come back absolutely  price fair Las Vegas standards  <EOR> Really should 4 5 stars  dinner few weeks ago completely blown away food  starter Snapper sashimi tuna tartare Branzino baked sea salt amazingly prepared  texture just flaked deliciously apart fork side dish sweet potato marshmellow sweet amazing completely took urge dessert away  sat bar dining area excellent friendly service  didn't chance try any offerings ambitious cocktail list but did observe bartender expertly craft Manhattan feel completely ease ordering libation next time here  Cuz definitely coming back  <EOR> Being fish lover impressed American Fish  Entering restaurant very pleasant experience   theme wood almost everything restaurant wood  mirrored wall trees behind bar creates cool forrest effect  The back restaurant features wall glass kitchen full view including long BBQ grills which front center   booth back great watching chefs action   The bread served start nice consisted grilled ciabatta plenty butter which butter oilve oil table rather pointless mini blueberry muffins dusted paprika which unusual but still tasty   The main dishes mostly fish seafood organized three catagories cooked broth baked sea salt grilled   Everything menu sounded great selection fish excellent   menu also notes country origin meats which nice touch   I ordered Branzino fish baked sea salt which flavorful melted mouth   crispy skin complemented delicate meat very well   vegetables side perfectly cooked flavors well balanced   The waitor very polite explained menu specials very thoroughly   Service timely but rushed glasses water constantly replenished   The only complaint restaurant very loud probably all wood surfaces reflecting all noises   The prices reasonable being strip definitely come again next time try black cod   <EOR> Can't really wrong Michael Mina  Very good food   Selection isn't wide you'd be  Also kind weird same items other restaurants special  Although Shabu shabu dish good  <EOR> Best meal trip best meal year far   place packed planned waiting hour before being seated took ourselves bar drink    little did know drinks

The dessert menu looked beautiful but couldn't fit another crumb us!  Which reminds blue corn muffins bread basket die for   best EVER consumed lot corn muffins life   Soft moist beautiful   This place perfection   cannot possible wrong Michael Mina's American Fish  <EOR> This seriously disappointing   responsible picking restaurant new gorgeous casino hotel Aria did based upon Yelp reviews   people let down!!!    Not only food pretty terrible but service horrendous   booked reservation which clearly didn't need since 9 10ths restaurant empty   not good sign! 7 45pm 10pm Cirque de Soliel show Bellagio O    Needless say run final touch bad experience waiter disappeared 30 minutes     We ordered shellfish appetizer both friend specified wanted cold   arrived hot   when sent back waiter came told ordered hot   Um cardinal rule serving don't tell your customers wrong  I'm very new shellfish only cold no memory confusion folks  So pretty much set tone whole meal   fantastic cocktail menu he never offered until asked   although cocktails ordered far best     The entrees disgusting   ordered Salmon some sort soup poured over which predominate taste salt   salmon very rare  almost sushi   Bleech   can't remember unfortunately friend but she gave ick face too     I should stopped eating but portions small wanted dessert   so ordered chestnut ice cream   wrong ice cream?  Well tasted chalk     It ended being $125 each   wayyyyy much crappy customer service lackluster food   many great restaurants town   don't let must friends family owners convince just handful reviews eat place     It's two weeks still bad taste mouth!!! <EOR> Michael Mina's American Fish okay maybe it'd better smaller group but 12 people  tough serve   Ono but found lacked flavor  shoulda gotten Salmon   tried Blackened Cod tasty!  server did great job picking cocktails based clear dark liquor sweet floral fruity everyone liked special drink!  appetizers pretty darn good too! <EOR> This restaurant atmosphere any other other Las Vegas places very unique romantic  Service excellent very cool ways cooking seafood   Great flavors  <EOR> My hubby treated overnight Vegas birthday   stayed Aria restaurants hotel   fans Michael Mina love eponymous restaurant Union Square figured would give try   give food four stars but main complaint deafening volume composed very loud often inappropriate music waitpeople scurrying hither yon constant clatter clang serviceware dishes   Monday night but service frenetic quality it   room aesthetically pleasing but only contributes cacophony   Five stars sommelier exceptionally helpful never condescending   if looking scene don't if trying relax  <EOR>
