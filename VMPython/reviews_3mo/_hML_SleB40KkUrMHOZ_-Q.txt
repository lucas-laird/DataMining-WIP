Let start off saying food BAD   just notable eyes felt EXPENSIVE   didn't even pick tab time!  First example Moonen Tater Tots $9    Overpriced portion size   I think 9 10 tater tots there??  $1 tater tot   and no drenched truffle oil accompanied fancy aioli   taste just ok   not very memorable   Braised Oxtail Croquettes Dijionnaise $12   Looks mozzarella stick but filled oxtail potato  good just liking bang buck here     Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets $11 Natural Jus Peas Carrots  interesting   good different but great   want something stand out!!  aren't eating Applebees   or spending Applebees money   Johnny's Dry Aged Burger $18   asked double portion Truffle Cheese but very truffle tasted DRY goat's cheese brie   which don't all  Sad because ruined burger   Maybe if only cheese would more tolerable just don't compare Todd English's Olives Truffle Cheese Burger instance   not same burger cheese   not even same ballpark   The desserts good Pie Americana $9 Apple Compote  Puff Pastry Vanilla Ice Cream Walnuts  Fancy apple pie good flavor here   and Mahalo Matcha Panna Cotta $10 Green Tea Panna Cotta Macadamia Nut Tuile Passion Fruit Sorbet  Good combination flavors but again nothing really stood still felt little overpriced   Seems am minority here   everyone else seems place   But no reason why would back spend cheddar   Pics <EOR> Rx recently remodeled upstairs lounge old timer RM Seafood just inside Mandalay Place  place designed steampunk mind but think many items value engineered original design because doesn't quite successfully portray look opinion  few neat elements inside space but far cry would envision if heard someone call steampunk themed restaurant  fake gears empty beakers slightly cool light fixtures hardly steampunk  menu features many overpriced small bites well full meals don't forget check overpriced drink menu iPads mostly $14 16 cocktails extremely small   We ordered two Johnny's Big Dry Aged Burgers which come lettuce house made pickles tomato jam balsamic onions  until point waitress fine but when she asked if wanted any sides two $18 burgers just ordered asked and assumed if came fries  response burger gave very blank stare  quite response would given but ok  ordered side fries meal already adding pretty quickly  burgers ordered medium other medium rare when brought placed front without any noticeable markings asked server which which presented another semi dickish response put right right spot   Ok whatever  bun extremely dry dry fact could tell soon picked burgers  tomato jam non existent thousand island type sauce added another odd bitterness wasn't quite great but also incredibly prominent  perception meat just ok quality could very well premade patty based its form but because patties apparently made dry aged prime opposed ground beef sure think  cooked well close medium rare ordered but bitter char flavor bit prominent when tasted its own  caramelized onions bit crunchy cooked enough either  Overall total fail forget even comparing downstairs   And top off fries sucked  close those In N Out but quite good  Some cooked well but many very undercooked soggy  then found bill fries cost $9!!!! just f$@!ing ridiculous actually angry pay much fries even given larger portion get   And speaking bill let jump back bit  fiancée liked burger far less did overly dry bun caused initially remove top portion only eat half bun but she eventually just eating toppings patty fork knife  Because she forced sample full bitter flavor char patties much her  didn't notice flavor much when mixed bun various toppings although did catch few bitter bites towards end mine when wasn't much else left  much nervous deliberation part told say something waitress different meal   waitress asked wrong explained bitter char flavor dry bun  She tried claim because patty made prime ground beef different flavor might used to  tried argue wasn't but maybe unclean grill just method cooked she then countered could tomato jam many people order without  explained tomato jam before certainly wasn't it  Whatever explanation may instance customer always right stop arguing weird details apologize take new order   In end burger replacement salad both taken care along additional $4 towards burger manager came over assure grill very clean  way just way expensive meal got  If nothing comped meal would cost $75 two drinks two burgers side fries other words far much money get  don't care if Strip location places starting charge $5+ add 50 cents worth potato already overpriced burger getting absurd seriously start calling places it  Even burger removed replacement meal being charged additional $4 off meal still $57 29 before tip which just insane  burger sucked experience sucked paid far much it  <EOR> what fantastic place!! actually shake Rick Moonen's hand while dining here   he owns place seen tv bunch times   super cool guy  disagree previous reviewers waitress knew menu inside very helpful  squid e o's delicious  othere dish quail egg fantastic well  disappointed here  <EOR>
