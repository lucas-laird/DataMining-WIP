Yes does   Carrying organic theme interior restaurant sparsely decorated bamboo topped tables chairs bamboo floors most likely company wide color scheme two tone set blue tiles  space good feel it said almost seemed few seats but once did quick count saw several more people come during visit seemed just right  Also keeping simplicity aspect those new fancy coke machines 200 different combinations without having whole line fountains   The menu everything single double patty options veggie burgers grilled cheese large variety sides some great shakes even mandarin oranges  what's even more helpful those care calorie count each item prominently displayed  But star show all ingredients burger example made 100% USDA certified organic grass fed free range beef taste difference  Even fries made olive oil cookies made organic eggs butter   I course Elevation Burger which double meat double cheese real cheddar original toppings Elevation sauce pickles lettuce tomatoes  Double meat cheese sounds bit similar another certain place huh? look burger fries when arrive your table even bit familiar but similarities stop upon first bite  instantly taste unique beef flavor stands many other fast food type places  patties thin but juicy hold very prominent flavor throughout meal  bun great very sweet soft reminiscent Hawaiian roll  lettuce tomato pickles all fresh good lettuce being used sparingly just right  cheese melted thoroughly good flavor but found myself longing little more sharpness it  hate keep going back but end burger really felt finished not greasy burger great fresh ingredients similar when finish In N Out burger don't think  bad thing any means   The fries also really fresh great serving more enough two people  fries first visit may bit hard overcooked but second visit less week later fries soft just right  also Oreo shake second visit great  very intriguing offering menu something most likely next visit option them scoop some ice cream onto root beer sell bottle   The overall price meal bit more place keep comparing but think you're paying ingredients well slightly better less hectic atmosphere  double burger starts $5 29 another $2 69 double helping fries  $4 19 shake might tad high but really tasty if feel splurging once while   also add Sean GM location really nice  habit leaving business card behind most places review Sean touch within hour visit see thought made point ask return trip  All employees very friendly food great really nice atmosphere  if you're south west part town craving something bit better fast food definitely try Elevation Burger  <EOR> While high hopes elevation appreciate idea organic beef products  wasn't impressed  ingredients fresh no worries there  But much excess juice oil burger drips falls apart while eat it  fries memorable nothing special them  I excited elevation cookie but upon eating failed well  Tasted dough uncooked cookie  Looks sliced chunk off roll dough bagged customers  Once again high hopes but $18 55 two elevation burgers fries drink cookie probably returning  spend less buying organic beef Costco making own burgers  <EOR> I really enjoyed Elevation Burger! am vegetarian excited two different veggie burgers being all organic vegan patty  fries awesome soggy greasy resemble REAL potatoes! dining guest beef burger which he enjoyed also  definitely eat again  <EOR> Although bit pricey place definitely worth cost you're getting   organic hormone free burger delicious especially Elevation Sauce Vanilla milkshake fresh strawberry organic cheesecake amazing!  far fries bit soggy but nice flavor due oil fried in   also reward card where stamp per meat veggie patty purchase   14 stamps receive free Elevation Burger!  return again future  <EOR> Another burger spot but healthier spin  came groupon forced spend 20 bucks  ordered elevation burger cheddar fries which cooked olive oil  burger pretty simple two patties lettuce elevation sauce cheddar cheese  burger somewhat juicy but lacked lot flavor  But if anything considered healthy its going lack little flavor compared good fatty stuff  fries OK also nothing special    I guess burger lived organic healthier side which lacked lot flavor  burgers expected  When comes burgers more unhealthy better  <EOR> I love concept all natural hormone slime free burgers  little upset however when ordered veggie burger frozen middle  fries bit salty but good  husband loved all natural burger   Keep natural hormone free beef ! <EOR> I love different sodas fancy machine  just button takes whole new experience soda soda fan different lemonades well   Okay didn't just come soda  Groupon Elevation Burger spend $20  ordered elevation burger cheese caramelized onions lettuce mayo  sad didn't mushrooms  also ordered fries chocolate malt shake  burger delicious totally tell 100% organic beef  fries reminds fries N nothing special there  shake pretty good can't wrong chocolate malt shake  <EOR> I veggie burger cheese very good   husbad son regular burgers also liked them   fries ok  daughter's grilled cheese good   just used regular bun turned them inside put grill cheese even melted   service pretty bad too   walked completely ignored  When placed order girl rude just pointed board toppings option when asked choices she very annoyed   really wanted place since close home but just can't passed rude customer service! <EOR> Of course organic patties taste different but burgers good  being said fries lacked flavor cheese wasn't all great  <EOR> I'm fan concept restaurant general but when came thought burgers would just eating Super Duper San Francisco which favorite burgers earth   both same organic healthy thing going on     However flavor much different other burgers may good thing depending your taste buds   husband example huge fan flavor   But then examine calorie count fat etc see elevation burger much leaner your average burger which accounts different taste     Super Duper 670 calories 41g fat Elevation Burger 510 calories 26g fat  And since people Vegas mostly haven't heard Super Duper here's which same seems Super Duper In 670 calories 41g fat  So basically Elevation Burger trying give amazing experience having really great cheeseburger actually made beef some crappy veggieburger but almost 50% less fat less calories which pretty damn cool   even trim calorie count further lettuce wrapping still good   The fries wonderful but always love frying olive oil   prefer all other oils   My only real complaint don't drive through which only thing stopping eating more often   really hope open more around town  <EOR> This place good great   first time made mistake putting balsamic mustard sauce burger unhappy  Every time since just burger  burgers good  burgers juicy but lack bit flavor  fries nothing exciting  fried olive oil nothing special  shakes blah  first time vanilla shake tastes mush some vanilla ice cream call shake  decided try chocolate next time same situation  Chocolate ice cream mushed splash milk  workers always nice but almost nothing walk around ask if need anything 12 times during meal  back because husband likes but I'd rather other burger place down street half price  <EOR> Love it! Great burgers amazing service prices same non organic chain  great concept <EOR> I want start clarifying something  am giving four stars sustainability using grass fed beef all burgers  Factory farming unhealthy unsustainable cruel just taste grass fed beef better  being said food solid three stars  Yummy  Helpful staff good environment  would come back  am guessing Tomoko M s experience shows need work consistency  <EOR> Luckily came groupon only paid half price  burgers nasty tasting! Even husband picky thinks gross  Maybe am used chemical hormone laden beef? Perhaps but usually when eat organic dairy produce taste better conventional counterparts  beef   The shakes yummy fries so so  yourself favor skip place  <EOR> I love burgers when see new burger place always stop in  first experience Organic burger place  All ingredients better quality tastes different enjoyed it  price great good value  <EOR> I'd put elevation burger right par n' burger     The burger itself tasty liked meat   especially appreciate order just you'd no mystery toppings ask for     I kid burger which code burger patty   standard elevation burger double   list 20 topping choose but some key choices missing   Um hello???
