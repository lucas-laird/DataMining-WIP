Amazing Chris provided amazing service coffee fantastic! <EOR> Well thought would try again   time Thursday morning seated right away   wait forever two small grandchildren Tyler take order   He very laid back no hurry anything   food came cold   Won't back  <EOR> Wow talk going down hill fast!  Just two months rave review place   back today ordered same thing ribeye steak eggs   steak probably cheapest cut steak ever had   picture see all fat barely edible!  potatoes which amazing last time today overcooked greasy   friends breakfast equally disappointing   waitress annoying she rushing along halfway through plate put fourth down minute she tried take plate away?  Oh well shame food bad quick   Probably won't back anytime soon  <EOR> Not bad but good hype  Ordered steak chilaquiles  steak great breakfast house but chilaquiles tasted enchilada sauce drenched chips  overwhelming taste ruined steak  Also almost $4 skinny glass OJ no refill kinda steep <EOR> This place very good food  eaten twice  only reason gave them 4 stars because each time wait 20 30 minutes before getting seated looks almost empty restaurant  Overall seated everything good  <EOR> This places awesome breakfast! only reason gave them 4 stars wait  many tables inside outside yet let them sit empty wait 20 minutes  don't it   The steak good breakfast pot bread die for! <EOR> One favorite breakfast places ever!  food world   Checking kinda nightmarish older lady tats reaks cigarettes smoke worst server ever!  But atmosphere delightful outfits worn adorable food seriously incredible  If past check lady Hamza tattoos smells cigarette smoke you're good hands your experience phenomenal <EOR> PRICEY!!!!! strip establishment  $12 each menu item breakfast? Unless $7 oatmeal it even bowl cup quarter maybe? would ok portions large but not   Food average  Sorry am into $12 two egg meat potato toast then add coffee $2 95  $15 breakfast excessive  Then tip? quickly add $20 per person  No thanks won't back  <EOR> I've really excited come try place since looooovvveeee breakfast only five minutes house  Although admit previous reviews made little nervous wait    We came 10 am Friday seated right away  coffee fresh squeezed orange juice  thought juice bar great touch! ordered ultimate steak eggs w pot o bread divine! ordered steak medium rare closer medium but didn't mind  pot o bread yummy very fluffy  hash browns eggs just delicious  Definitely little bigger portion size prepared leave full!
