Nice amount spice yummy melted cheese top   However location's claim fame speak reason why location specifically soda machine see pic    Very high tech but when actually used realized just bunch flavored syrups which appropriately inappropriately mix your favorite soft drink   Some combinations pretty gross opinion   wants vanilla flavored Sprite?  I appreciate non caffeinated no calorie sodas Sprite Zero Dasani Sensations   But keep mind if add flavored syrup diet drink anymore   Plus hard figure getting if drink nazi me   example Dasani Sensations Lemon no calorie version lemon syrup calories?  Finally people enamored damn machine stand front taking sips every possible combination   only machine gets super annoying   But enough drink machine   cashier food prep people friendly food good back  <EOR> Amazing subs glad opened location  service great food awesome hot sauces delicious coke machine fun really enjoy eating look forward repeat visits  Every other sub place pales comparison except Capriotti's but own special thing going don't really compare two   By way #10 Datil sauce fantastic!! other favorite #5 just is  YUM! <EOR> Love place!!!!!!!  favorite Engineer   doesn't hot turkey roast beef                               WOW <EOR> Love meatball sub!
