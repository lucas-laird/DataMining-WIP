Both times food huge disappointment  Taste very processed unappealing  drinks bland bartenders horrible attitudes  acted though end world when ordered mojito girlfriend because he'd actually mix drink  far ambiance owners tried very chic impressive interior but looks cheap unfinished  anyone taste style place pathetic   last time charity event which $50 head  fairly empty outside sitting another couple  waitress asked move different table owners wanted sit there  Four douches affliction shirts sat down pretty sure only reason asked move impress girls with  am positive all good reviews written them  EVERY LOCAL KNOW HATES PLACE!! No chance place lasts through winter    <EOR> We found place book suite   Design amazing service excellent plate présentation creative  Dill Lama vodka cocktail fantastic Nucocktail gréât taste but share big  being chef myself would recommend chef hide exquisite flavor much spices but rather products speak themself  tried all appetizers menu chef great ideas but should slow down spices  three three agreed  gave place four stars because everyone trashed them fair  Give them try  They gave desserts free but charged hooka did asked for  Check end being 190 bucks three us  I read all reviews most them bad service thought best part  <EOR> The place looks really cool food pretty good but did few mistakes orders  where big group where capable accommodate which nice but music little loud  resto lounge but still should lower sound just notch  couldn't hear each others   twice far different group people all agree that!  Overall bad spot hang out  give 4 stars if day hear there  <EOR> My birthday review!!!!!  Last night lot fun @ Nu Sanctuary Lounge   several concerns throughout week leading last night but put ease soon walked talked hostess   She sweet on top entire reservation all enjoy birthday   To over few points food late night menu fantastic flat bread pizza edemame bar staff great former co workers know some great specialty drinks Having two servers always better greatly appreciated lounge setting  Hookahs little expensive side but flavor outstanding!
