Noodles thick non traditional ramen noodles which don't see often but cooked nice al dente which gives nice bite ! =D egg yolk im pretty sure laid raw left broth cook slightly? gives nice rich flavor overall  Bacon gives nice flavor esp since lightly seared grill but fan bacon  shiso leaf actually look off guard  Gives something along lines maybe basil flavor? Overall ramen bad since its lighter shiroi tonkotsu ramen  favorite but noodles use    Shiroi Tonkotsu Ramen $7 95 The best salted ramen created salted sauce brown garlic oil  soup base original tonkotsu pork broth salted sauce  Toppings included chashu pork hard boiled egg fresh scallions kikurage  type noodle selected ramen thin noodle    Thin noodles  Overcooked opinion  Cooked bit long  Lost its bite   soup quite salty  Probably salted sauce     whatever could be  Very heavy garlic flavor mostly garlic oil  surprising did hard boiled eggs  I'd prefer soft boiled egg runny yolk  kikurage wood ear fungus quite normal japanese style ramen  thing nice chashu  comparison Monta fatty all  Majority meat thin line fat  nice touch seared grill  Adds nice flavor it  bad ramen though soup base salted sauce this?!? quite salty    During soft opening also few side orders available    Hiromaru Gyoza $5 50 Grilled pork dumpling  Hiromaru Buns $6 00 Two steamed buns filled butabara pork belly served Hiromaru original sauce  Karaage $5 00 Japanese fried chicken  Pretty good ! start off meat dark meat  top its marinated seasoned even inside meat flavorful  batter used thick nice crispy  Nice side !

well some private VIP rooms too  decor complete opposite original side    Overall bad soft opening new style  Would come back try different side dishes next time gyoza buns well other two ramen offer menu  price ramen i'd say should include more slide pork though  Seemed little skimped only 1 slice     <EOR> Located Cathay Hills plaza near Lindell Road signage easy spot  restaurant clean modern design  White red wood fixtures furniture  also second dining area booths beautiful lighting  definitely more spacious most ramen joints  Lots light very welcoming   I really looking forward trying Cabonara Tate Yama Ramen but weren't serving today the soft openings possibly depleted thick noodle supply   ordered only other two ramen choices available Shiroi Kuroi   Shiroi Tonkotsu $7 95 Pork broth salted sauce brown garlic oil served thin noodles topped chashu pork hard boiled egg fresh scallions kikurage  broth really nice creaminess almost milky  garlic oil surprisingly light  great depth flavor  noodles good pork wasn't fatty   Kuroi Tonkotsu $8 95 Completely identical Shiroi Tonkotsu except made ma yu black garlic oil instead brown garlic oil  flavors similar but black garlic bit more robust  Both broths both delicious own way   We also shared two side dishes Karaage $5 Hiromaru Special Fried Rice $6 50 made egg chashu pork scallions  Karaage light batter good flavor  loved squeeze fresh lemon chicken too  fried rice very tasty! chashu pork scallions flavored nicely   The service friendly surprised find Mr  Kawai kitchen since he six locations Toyama Japan  Anyway making way back next week try thick noodle ramens! <EOR> There no doubt Hiromaru hottest new business anyone attended followed Aki Matsuri festival ramen ramen fans general  didn't attend festival but am aware Hiromaru presented very popular offering made known planning outpost Vegas  Fast forward half year tip friend finally ready open  couple issues over weekend pushed back opening just little but just thankful  lucky enough eaten three times now  welcomed soft opening #1 through expressing keen interest them in person phone subsequently soft opening #2 last night grand opening day today   I over items sound much story event review  deliberately waited until opening day post am judging mainly food quality service being work progress price food being non existent first two visits   House salad complimentary little bowl greens oil present every customer upon arrival  found some purple leaves little bitter but nice fresh start welcome  Hiromaru Buns butabara pork belly white bun some sort house made mayo  enjoyed it  told good Fat Choy which still haven't tried but very least competent offering  [UPDATE 3 12 tried Fat Choy's pork belly bao which utterly blows water but  mainly testament good Fat Choy is ]  Karaage your typical ball ish fried chicken slice lemon little lettuce  wasn't crunchy first day but second day  If karaage your thing try it   Hiromaru Japanese Curry rice typical yellow curry chashu pork belly  spicy  could myself enough  tastes fine but just wouldn't order knowing Japanese Curry Zen just down street   Shiroi Tonkotsu basic ramen chashu pork half hard boiled egg scallions kikurage mushrooms  tried first night wasn't impressed overall  sesame heavy broth really really threw loop  also didn't hard boiled egg stylistic choice vs  soft boiled but thought noodles decent maybe al dente chashu pork belly nice because meaty much more fatty  Maybe try again future but grade would Incomplete this   Carbonara Ramen want seeing you're going place fusion ramen its name  lot more carbonara pasta does typical ramen  thick noodles al dente egg lends nice flavor broth thick cut bacon while predominantly chewy completes experience  Couldn't taste sesame some reason was milk helpful? enjoyed shiso accented broth  Because fusion ramen would directly call better worse favorites Fukumimi Sora but mainly different   Kuroi Tonkotsu basically Shiroi plus black garlic oil  chose today because Carbonara Tate Yama supplies time whatever reason  am very glad tried because 1 now know shiroi flavor first night wasn't fluke 2 more accustomed sesame flavor enough enjoy ramen today  would still pick ramen over Fukumimi Sora but think would rank above Monta which really impressed late   This very promising ramen shop dedicated management team should know they're still ironing kinks first week  But if took ten minutes give check? can't hold against them point  Give them try some time see think! <EOR> *This review based grand opening  sure back Hiromaru see if any changes review*  Saw Hiromaru opening location Vegas excited  gone Japanese festival tried ramen months ago  loved big news    I came grand opening greeted huge staff  all welcoming! interior pretty hip its red white decor    My boyfriend already knew carbonara ramen because tried festival  Carbonara ramen $10 95  Pretty pricey opinion  also chashu bowl almost $7  ordering given complimentary salads  salad refreshing dressing top    We chashu bowl first  chashu topped chopped greens sauce which don't know name all top rice  If you've monta nothing it  personally prefer fried chashu  pork seemed steamed because soft was  Don't wrong still tasted fine!   Now onto ramen  carbonara THICK noodles milky tonkatsu broth  comes bacon but switched chashu no charge  Lastly egg yolk your spoon it  broth thicker festival but still tasted great  If thinner it'd perfect  noodles huge  udon except harder  don't know feel noodles honest   The ramen tasted different japanese festival  kinda disappointing but ramen appetizing regardless  sure back try other ramen  <EOR> I visited Hiromaru grand opening wasn't personally all impressed  menu very simple  Only four types Ramen few other extras such Karaage curry buns   We started meal Hiromaru buns  pork belly tough could barely chew through meat  left bit underwhelmed bun experience  Secondly really wanted try carbonara ramen since heard show stealer unfortunately out  heard great soft opening but its kind disappointment star menu items grand opening day  ended settling Shiroi Tonkotsu ramen extra chashu  broth tasty but personally wasn't fan noodles  slightly thicker noodle  chashu good but almost all fat very little meat  Overall just ok ramen experience me  Maybe just creature habit prefer Ramen Sora   Although wasn't biggest fan Hiromaru return purely interest Carbonara ramen  <EOR> This review solely based second day soft opening March 4th 2014    After hearing Hiromaru taking over Cafe de Japon's location excited  No wait let rephrase  ecstatic  Especially trying some ramen Japanese Festival which took place Rio last year  just couldn't wait  now finally opened   After much nagging broken record esq behavior    three friends made way Hiromaru late lunch Tuesday  little bit 3 PM restaurant fairly empty  greeted soon opened door seated right away  Well two friends arrived earlier Andrew C  just joined them table   The menu Hiromaru fairly simple  total 4 different ramens choose 7 side order appetizers  Now because still soft opening everything ordered free  However limited menu  limited two different ramens carbonara ramen shiroi tonkotsu  sides choose Hiromaru buns pork buns karaage fried chicken Hiromaru Japanese curry   Andrew C  decided carbonara ramen shiroi tonkotsu could try both share  friends decided side karaage Japanese curry  ordered food served small bowl salad right away start meal which nice  before knew orders filtering       Hiromaru Japanese Curry $8 50 side dish first come out  came small bowl plate curry rice slice pork asparagus  didn't it  curry runny watery pretty average  reminds type curry buy grocery stores boxes where mix water powder create dish  skip this    Karaage $5 00 Only phrase could justify side dish  Surprisingly good  Seasoned dark meat deep fried light batter  delicious  Try it    Carbonara Ramen $10 95 dish your east west fusion into one  Nothing more fusion right?! mean carbonara RAMEN? Where find this? Hiromaru  heard read made Hiromaru famous  amazing creativity behind beyond genius  But confused supposed thinking while eating it  soup base tonkotsu milk  didn't look creamy per say but milky texture  Flavor wise little bland  If no told tonkotsu base would've never known  two strips bacon well  grilled before hand  know would made even better? If cut pieces shown picture menu  noodles little flat thick  typically type noodles prefer ramen but cooked perfectly  al dente just way it   Shiroi Tonkotsu $7 95 ate during ramen festival? tasted whole lot different here  First bite? Delicious  Second bite? Wonderful  Third fourth fifth sixth bite? think going pass  tonkotsu soup base salted sauce brown garlic oil  soup light but heavy flavor  salty garlic y  normally salty foods but much especially something heavy such boring  first bite knew dish could risk running flat line me  much something still much case think salted sauce tipped over  slice pork however nicely seasoned but because salty soup overkill me  Everything started tasting same  Aside shiroi ramen came thin noodles but bit softer side which meant slightly overcooked it    Now don't wrong    food good but sure if me  Though may definitely again just see if did anything different soft opening  may ask if skip salted sauce sure noodles al dente well    Overall think disappointment may word little trip  Hopefully second trip better  <EOR> Any ideas may Ramen   get rid them  Hiromaru opens whole brave new world flavors ramen  thicker house made noodles taste fresh cut shizo scrambled egg still sizzling plate presentation fried rice   There nothing Vegas   I Carbonara ramen which absolutely perfect  But really don't think wrong menu even non ramen items  karaagge far away best ever had   This place wonderful  If ramen japanese all Hiromaru  Now  <EOR> I came Hiromaru today feel would wrong write review warn people food   am really confused place many 5 star reviews   First things first   mad construction being done restaurant    straight building door hammers shiet right inside   ask see if open because honestly sure   Once came inside seated room where doing construction rather other quieter room   front row seat construction guy's belly hanging pants   Sometimes couldn't hear people saying over hammering   If don't your door built why open?

Oh we'll   worth try   <EOR> I've Ramen spots Hawaii Seattle very unique delicious  very attentive details perfect textures seasonings   just first bowl   excited try everything! <EOR> Hiramaro VS Monta The broths flavored differently creating different product each restaurant  Pro Hiramaru SERVICE! find Monta no longer takes time take care customers properly  service poor but genuine  Hiramaru provides great dining experience highly due service provides! Another Pro temperature broth Hiramaru allows enjoy ramen right when receive it  find tongue doesn't burn taste flavors throughout meal  Monta's temperature can't really taste broth eating 10 minutes because just hot   However ramen just plain good both Hiramaru Monta shall eat no matter what!!! Lastly Hiramaru provides bigger menu therefore greater selection items grub on! prices tad bit more expensive  love food offer customers but also love simplicity Monta's menu    Overall Hiramaru good worthy! Haha  new still deserves learn grow just any new restaurant  Monta continue striving greatest through improvement service  <EOR> Very very happy service staff  soon walked greeted assume owner staff  Both genuinely happy restaurant  grander terms Las Vegas kind service hard find  white red interior along open kitchen leave little room any poor maintenance sloppy upkeep  Clean crisp nice change neighboring competitors  Las Vegas' edition China Town   The menu very normal size ramen restaurant but nice spin ingredients   if ramen clean restaurant doesn't great service pleasant staff appears some fine food coming superior service your place   Thanks staff made long day four six year old pleasant ending  <EOR> 05 04 14 DINNER  So write first Yelp quite long time mostly due time constraints  Sheesh should even bother LAST Yelp review generated first ever hate mail via Yelp's compliment app! NICE! I'm gonna into deeply actually knowing probably will! but REALLY liked place lot  first Japanese chain's restaurants entire United States  Having dined feel privileged   And dining last minute decision  way elsewhere dear friend's Cinco de Mayo bar extravaganza but unfortunately parking lot completely full very beginning absolutely NO street parking miles gave that  Sorry C! Love man! It's fair review standard ramen itself didn't typical ramen but want return try compare other ramen places tried Vegas  HINT absolute FAVE ramen place remains Ramen Sora particularly miso ramen but haven't quite while  First off order Asahi draft under $4 order same beer edamame thrown same price! opted little extra  edamame OK nothing special no garlic coarse salt  But free complain! all 3 wanted beer lots edamame   Next if check in via Yelp purchase appetizer half off  party 3 but only 2 smartphones opted karaage gyoza    The karaage Japanese boneless fried chicken reason place didn't 5 stars very disappointing  threw purchased frozen nuggets fryer  worst thing world but greasy crispy never again    BUT THOSE GYOZA! WOW! could've ordered tons those! Wonderful!  Lastly spouse ordered same entree carbonara ramen  guess signature dish chain  literally lightly japanese take carbonara pasta Italy  rocked  heavy cream sauce most american restaurants mistakenly but light broth using same broth ramens cream added  waitress asked if wanted thick thin noodles opted choose she chose thick great this  Now dish loaded pork belly slices other ramens past but instead contains some chopped pork belly fat which similar pancetta you'd if ordered Italy  $10 95 great deal said terrific  Best carbonara ANYWHERE quite long time  Oh long day visiting barely english speaking Claudio home made pasta carbonara made apt Sherman Oaks CA! The check cheap under $20 pp including tax tip  Needless say we'll back  <EOR> I black garlic sauce ramen carbonara  The black garlic awesome!! perfect taste! the carbonara taste pasta but ramen noodle extra sauce   I black garlic better would back this!  Dont forget check 50% off gyoza karage! <EOR> First time first time ramen  sticky buns amazing everyone should order app when go  ordered shiroi tonkatsu sp sorry lol  very good nice spicy which asked for  chasu better any other ramen houses to  broth creamy noodles thin order  Decor modern fit fusion description perfectly me  Service attentive friendly  Would back but must  <EOR> Came try much hyped Carbonara ramen  Why fusion ramen place if don't try fusion dishes right?  Interior surprisingly modern despite more traditional exterior  Service polite sat right hand side red white decor couple more intimate left hand side sure difference seated there   Started Hiromaru buns appetizer quite nice doughy buns plentiful portions pork special sauce  quite liked almost barbecue like sauce pork cooked in   Carbonara ramen myself black garlic guy  I pleasantly surprised dish little apprehensive thinking broth would thicker create texture did not fan alfredo sauces but somehow worked being milky flavorful without being decadent overly rich though was   Did specify thick noodles initially would preferred but received thin appreciated similarity spaghetti carbonara added fusion feel dish overall  bacon fresh ground pepper really made dish adding just bit bite flavor meaty savory element balanced milky broth  even bacon fan!  My guy favored garlic ramen took few bites wasn't really flavors bold but seemed little off  He less ramen but proclaimed favorite bowl far which impressive  Egg bit overcooked but overall dish tasty but just slightly off almost felt incomplete something missing   I say despite giant bowls rich broths ramen did feel overwhelmingly heavy dinner perhaps choice thin noodles? big bowl ramen good comfort food but liked feeling sloshing belly full of dinner feeling afterward  Would come back try other milk broth ramen ham  <EOR> I really expecting place great  really fall short Ramen part   The noodles tasted pasta soup more italian   If love traditional Ramen your better off waiting line Monta   Oh if seafood ramen its just added powder no actual seafood used   They pricey get  <EOR> Short Good ramen might nice change pace interesting environment  There's better ramen shops area but bit unique   Long Came friend spotting drive home Monta Ramen  Looks rather odd outside but inside rather interesting  Kinda? looks rather modern inside feels bit uncomfortable me  I ordered Shiro Tonkotsu ramen just set standard review place from  typical tonkotsu ramen milk added  noodles toppings broth pretty close Monta ramen's but chashu bit firmer which made more flavorful but broth mix wasn't strong Monta ramen's  Service alright can't complain there   Go if want try something different  other tonkotsu miso shoryu else where other unique ramen spots though!   if something intrigues menu but sits unique spins good more traditional places  I'd choose Monta over place 9 10 times  <EOR> Loving here   Service superb food heavenly serving size plentiful ambience invitingly modern!  Just ordered Shiroi Tonkotsu Ramen $7 95 Fried Ramen $8 95 Gyoza $5 bucks serving 6  Lucky me! Just redeemed 50% off discount gyoza   just checking in!!!   This Ramen spot sick days  <EOR> I Japanese Curry pork  sauce delicious!It tasted thick broth would work best bake pork roast with   However small portion rice rest plate all sauce!!! should ordered ramen but wanted try different type curry   would definetely come back again ambiance  place newly opened lounge still being built but chance sit since such large group  look forward coming back when lounge finished  <EOR> Yikes!!  I started dinner off Bao buns which sauce overload   messy eat took away pork belly  curry bowl boring side salad comes it  chicken karaage lacked some flavor but wasn't bad   On ramen!!! kuro ZERO garlic flavor anywhere  even slight aroma it  nothing more exciting aroma meal front me  tonkatsu very weird VERY short amazing   Kind let down made wish Monta Sora instead  Which two days later because needed fix disappointment I mentioned did kuro kind enough remove bill   Sorry but won't returning  <EOR> Good ramen worthy obsession   Great ramen?   nearly orgasmic!  Poor ramen?   scorns taste buds  mercilessly ridiculing your incompetent decision   I started review thinking Hiromaru Fusion Ramen 2 5 3 star experience   as wrote recalled experience ended  feeling couldn't justify anything beyond 2 stars   I wasn't really fan all way around   two distinct dinning areas   bright clean   lots white   bright lights    accented strong vibrant red some natural wood   Did mention side bright?  Well is   pretty sure surgeons prefer less light during intricate operations   other side calm peacefully brought together muted browns blues like   lighting side pushes towards romantic feel would certainly try sit side if return   We tried Shiroi Tonkotsu Salted White Tonkotsu $7 95 signature fusion Carbonara Ramen $10 95   Neither ramen left wanting more   few distinct changes taken place based some early comments   Both noodles thin eggs executed well   Previous reviewers complained thick noodles   didn't those   I ahead complain thin noodles instead   bit more bite   isn't much tooth found overly thin noodles  Shiroi nice flavor front but lingered way didn't enjoy      wasn't even fan thin pork ramen while could put whole bowl down won't seeking anytime soon   Carbonara excited even less   didn't flavors texture broth   noodles same described previously only time nothing redeeming bowl   I didn't opportunity try any side dishes but probably won't unless hear something special since won't back ramen  <EOR> Based visit cant say fan place  Kuroi tonkotsu $8 95 odd mix tonkotsu ramen black garlic flavors fighting each other your attention  thin noodles dense somewhat gummy  place try shear novelty factor unique types ramen served but think prefer more traditional type ramen  If sit counter prepare bang your knees into ledge beneath counter  If try scoot  those seat heavy hard move  there's high chance hitting your knees more once  <EOR> The boyfriend finally around checking place while best we'll probably visit again  '  I'm huge fan modern red white décor seats looked more ottomans place bit overly bright  seats pretty comfortable though  door open AC on  didn't find hot just warm but boyfriend found place way warm considering they're serving hot soup    Service quick attentive  didn't  wait seated water refilled promptly waitress checked several times  didn't any questions food but she seemed knowledgeable when answering questions another party   As appetizer ordered Karaage which thought somewhat small portion considering price $5  boyfriend thought portion fine maybe just cheap  P any rate tender juicy   Ramen though only ok  Shiroi Tonkatsu kind bland honest  boyfriend Tate Yama which he simply described Bean Sprout Mountain   <EOR>
