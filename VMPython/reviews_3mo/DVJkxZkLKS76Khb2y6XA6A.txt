I think am first experience place let just say   ah now needed  Tropical Smoothie meets Greens Proteins meets Coffee Shop spliced healthy Egg Works  Lots options meat salads vegetarian dishes breakfast coffee smoothies  see being healthy option those doing shows working training fights Paleo looking indulge while staying healthy   I ordered three things eat say? best stifle inner fat kid force feed healthy meals majority time  3 steps forward step back  Anyway bison cheeseburger PH breakfast BBQ chicken bowl quinoa BBQ sauce flavored stevia instead sugar damn they're those drizzle sauce all over your food   little more expensive most places but par when ordering things bison which isn't cheap  When first started eating course wanted compare Greens Proteins but really same thing  Greens protein healthy good health alternatives vegans vegetarians but outside several items lacks sufficient protein options me  where Greens Proteins lacks Protein House protein meat chicken egg whites alternatives customized shakes smoothies easier stay within friends eat  can't really compare two they're both good  comparing apples oranges both fruit but both different categories     any event they're still working some kinks but place potential continue expanding better  Now know some picky eaters complain just okay but also heard same person dislikes fish complains sushi restaurants  Wtf! Hey might just your thing  But simple if need your protein need your veggies need your carbs need healthy spot  isn't necessarily place would indulge but exactly place would keep track during week indulge later weekend  See fat kid reference above  <EOR> We stopped Sunday afternoon experience new place   am pretty open when comes food even watching calories     I ordered PH Pancakes hubby ordered Bison Burger wrapped lettuce   pancakes nice multigrain whey protein seems touch cinnamon   say awesome   six egg whites delivered side good well   mean can't mess egg whites   hubby disappointed Bison burger he felt rather bland nor real seasoning all     Now reason gave them 3 stars all service  Service horrible   ordered food took 45 mins all completed   two other couples ordered ahead already seated when walked door order   Several other groups people served before including two couples already seated   ask if order misplaced   hubbies burger sitting counter 10 mins didn't call still making order pancakes    One other couples said same problem    Now place itself great industrial design   But music blaring loud  literally sitting next kitchen hear when your name called your food    If into healthy food agree good but if call ahead pick because wait just fun  prepared pay little higher your food other places  <EOR> A new restaurant valley named Protein House   name course need see what's really going on   Located off Eastern Avenue near LVAC Gold's Gym Protein House another restaurant offers healthy eats ton protein  But PH just another healthy meal stop  PH offers smoothies breakfast burgers bowls salads  order straight counter place your order off menu  take order checklist select your meal then hand counter   also option build your own burger salad bowl   Because first visit decided biggest baddest burger Muscle Builder Burger  burger 12 oz ground Bison onions cheese Canadian bacon all served whole wheat bun  medium well swear best bison burgers ever had   Most exotic meats bison come gamey no taste  PH found way create burger flavor   way trying your protein day? burger close 70 grams protein   Yeah buddy!
