Lamar very nice made sure pizza it! Thank much! <EOR> If you're looking exceptional pizza low price definitely place go  just $8 12 inch pizza made just way want  Love thin crust array sauce topping choices  gone several times already just can't seem enough  evenings Sean Justus Zackese offer top notch service  Pieology crew rocks food even better  <EOR> Love concept!! Great food outstanding price! Friendly staff    U pizza 7 99 choose between different meats cheeses doughs sauces without being charged!!! love that? <EOR> Get whatever want thin crust pizza single reasonable price 5 minutes staff crazy friendly   No seriously tell them your choice crust whole wheat gluten free traditional sauce cheese toppings right front sandwich shop but don't charge extra more meat whatever   Then bake pizza oven which takes 5 minutes   The food good but authentic New York Chicago whatever style but see ingredients fresh made however want set aside your expectations enjoy   I finished pizza first time but next time took rest home to go box which just right size half pizza stupidly big fridge   If you're group doesn't sound your kind place right next door there's Chipotle Habit Burger Jamba Juice shut already  <EOR> This call pizza! Took 6 minutes ordering until pizza table  Chose every ingredient myself exactly way wanted it   They also gluten free pizza not recommended Celiacs use same oven stuff tastes very good!  One price all pizzas no fuzz just good food  <EOR> Very good fast pizza  cashier cashier because he burnt hand pizza oven multiple times even month employement  Might brains cook pizza but truly dedicated pieologist  <EOR> Good concept Chipotle pizza they told when stepped order    The pros lots ingredients choose from  quickly prepared cooked like under 5 minutes   inexpensive  clean   The cons only choice crust super thin so so taste texture  no anchovies! repeat no anchovies  Any self respecting pizza place should have  know everyone likes them but some people read do!  Overall pros enough back now then But if you're looking more authentic pizza experience I'd elsewhere  <EOR> Set Chipotle pizza par CiCi's Pizza     Pissy ass amount cheese wouldn't let put extra mozzarella  said could Parmesan instead extra mozzarella but don't Parmesan  Weird   It clean could reported other reviews but new there's years years built filth!  Customer service excellent very very friendly!  If want great pizza wouldn't suggest place but if want decent pizza good price  this place you  <EOR> Once again another great pizza Pieology  tried barbecue chicken pizza gluten free crust amazing!! If checked place missing awesome pizza  <EOR> I love concept ! Definitely reminds chipotle pizza! great price all toppings personal pizza   pesto sauce marinara   Yummmm chicken !! ingredients fresh many choose from  Customer service wonderful many nice workers answered all questions took star off because crust ! only type crust ! thin!!!! would come back if need quick pizza meal  <EOR> I usually don't write reviews until tried place few times but OH GOODNESS place amazing!! pizza cooked JUST right love whole 'like subway but pizza'  first time boyfriend able eat pizza together enjoy lol we never decide if share   But digress back pizza bbq sauce spicy chicken roasted red peppers feta cheese mozzarella  Boyfriend pepperoni jalapeños spicy chicken mozzarella red sauce three cheese sauce  Both cooked perfection  Right amount char  Thin crust tasty slight crunch upon first subsequent bites  Bruhhhhh EAT HERE  RIGHT NOW  DON'T EVEN CARE IF ALREADY EATEN JUST STARTED EAT CURRENTLY RESTAURANT WALK OUT RUN HERE  <EOR> I'm excited pizza place  Great pizzas your own just bonkers  pesto garlic butter sauce crazy putting all kinds toppings  love thin crust wait time 5 10 max every time go  Service excellent courteous  Again disappointed love first bite  <EOR> Idea behind place good but execution didn't follow through  11 inches create your own personal pizza idea great especially if want your own pizza add crazy things your food    The line long order food  when food came disappointed flavor  wheat crust marinara mozzarella sauce ham pepperoni pineapple jalapenos mushrooms  don't usually eat salty food but sauce really need some flavor salt  crust ok    I think prefer Domino's Hawaiian pizza this  <EOR> The staff always awesome never disappointed when come here! tell friends constantly  <EOR> Love Pieology!  happy side town!!    Guys behind counter very friendly    Pizza delivered table very quickly!!!   Must cinnamon sugar pizza dessert!! <EOR> First time coming boyfriend son  am big pizza person but personalizing your own pizza? why not? walk your server already pizza dough waiting choose sauce want  Ranging red sauce alfredo sauce  Then choose kind cheese would best part loading all your favorite toppings  I'd say size pizza personal but share someone  bake your pizza over right front does take long  location big outside seating  very clean inside which always number 1 concern  just opened Pieology maybe 1 2 months ago love it  <EOR> So best pizza world but give 5 stars because quick clean tasty is  being fast food pretty good  enter subway kind set where choose ingredients while pizza front you  only takes 3 minutes cook costs $8 taxes  Great deal good food check out  <EOR> I idea place alot  wish could request crispy would want your slice though  Every time come over cook mine cracker consistency  toppings good but none really stand memorable way  If improved two ways would frequent place much more  <EOR> I' loyal customer months now summerlin location  But never coming back again    After home boxed Pizza  surprise half pizza burn! Burn does why would think acceptable give this? Think time home opened close couldn't complain?   Very disappointing quality experience  <EOR> This place pretty good   light toppings feel free ask more   Remember unlimited toppings  crust super thin   fan thin crust loved it   cook pizza pretty crispy almost burnt crust ask brown crispy   Everyone nice but friendly   best part place all quotes wall   pizza really good love combo mozzarella ricotta cheese red onion basil artichoke bacon pepporoni sausage  Delicious  all pizza held pretty well  would again lunch   filling enough dinner  <EOR> Team took time fix accident condiment station where some loosen red pepper flakes       Awesome pies <EOR> Pass  worth opinion   far no pizza snob  little Caesars any day  Price wise bad but full size large now days most places equal slightly more  sauce very thin watery  Very bad combo such thin pizza  became floppy little mushy  Mine burnt around edges  wouldn't even recommend quick lunch spot during work  said sauce watery dripped shirt luckily Saturday still work but hardly anyone here  only good thing watery sauce wiped off shirt easily black shirt no tell  Bottom line if work pass real pizza if work still pass messy eat high risk spillage your work shirt leaves your hands very greasy  <EOR> So yummy!! $7 95 unlimited toppings  lot options toppings! service quick easy since new place  pizza baked oven right then bakes quick <EOR> A second Pielogy location? Awesome! used Orange County before moved nice see they've made way Las Vegas  location right UNLV which convenient students myself looking place eat near campus   I love freshness pizza here  Everything done right front pressing your dough adding your toppings finally placing your pizza stone oven  customizable too! offer abundance options your crust toppings sauces  usually Hickory BBQ Chicken Pizza made Mozzarella Gorgonzola cheese chicken cilantro red onions olive oil course barbecue sauce  add mushrooms well   It's $7 95 regular sized personal pie unlimited toppings  bit pricy pizza opinion  Also much love thin crust pizza burns rather easily  last time came half pizza burnt around edges! Next time would ask made less crispy  Other Pieology awesome  hand crafted Artisan style pizzas definitely worth visit  Or more! <EOR> Loved pizza   Fresh really good perfect lunch   Staff very nice helpful   gave only 4 stars because music loud could talk   party 5 difficult time hearing each other said  <EOR> This best pizza place ever to! Under $10 create your own pizza unlimited toppings?! Ugh heaven earth me  process pretty easy  employee asks kind dough want then just move down line there! choose all sauce cheese veggies meats want! put oven while pay  cashier gives number then bring pizza when finished! wait wasn't long all which also plus! delicious actually able finish whole thing  definitely come back lot future bring boyfriend friends  OH also another location Downtown Summerlin case didn't know! <EOR> Well build veggie pesto pizza all wheat crust tasted great!  problem wasn't enough   spending around $12 drink fast food think full   pizza thin light   suppose could added meat but don't them pizza   Good fast service  <EOR>
