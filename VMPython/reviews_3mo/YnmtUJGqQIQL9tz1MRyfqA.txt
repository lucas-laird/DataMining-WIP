Good Food excellent service more could want midnight? Thanks guys! <EOR> At first glance 1842 nice 'old' pub style its interior but upon closer inspection feels much better glorified Applebee's  some neat light fixtures but lots hard surfaces mostly oversized booths really odd back bar strange replacement classy interior Nobhill  restaurant located middle restaurant row picks huge crowds convention center MGM Grand Arena plan accordingly if you're during peak period  weekday noon able seat right away but just 10 minutes later some convention broke lunch line door  way many items list menu but many them sound great  Now gotten burger way head back fried homemade pickles lobster corn dogs minimum   Out several burgers offer sounded most interesting peanut butter crunch burger bacon jam potato chips  Upon first bite hit fantastic beef char flavor instantly brought back Nobhill burger enjoyed much but things changed bit there  Don't wrong really enjoyed burger but some flaws if going nit picking self  bun bit thick dry which didn't help burger peanut butter its main toppings  said meat excellent flavor cooked well but juicy patty all  bacon jam great flavor really paired well potato chips even though can't taste them well mix  Overall assembly just naturally very moist loses something me  two people lunch both ordered bacon cheeseburger theirs looked much juicier mine  I'd love come back sample both 1842 burger near future  All right flavors know most likely still produce something fantastic   Unfortunately fries seemed somewhat generic frozen variety weren't quite good before but good rosemary flavor cooked well  really wished something little more original when paired something odd burger bacon jam peanut butter potato chips it  price $17 seems way steep burger couple them $18 menu  understand convention centric dining spot strategy but still bit hard cough kind money burger  Plus if consider last restaurant which arguably fancier more intimate served possibly better burger $15 bit more troubling  Regardless Pub 1842 seems quite good menu seems offer several really good burgers if you're MGM Grand probably won't find better offering  <EOR> Tried peanutbutter crunch burger  very good  Some detracting points execution unevenly cooked burger unevenly spread toppings forgot pimento cheese because couldn't taste it  ordered chocolate malt shake paid $9 but never served accompanying cake it   Fix those gets another star  <EOR> Walked old fashioned feel place  Located inside MGM Hotel Casino place seemed hob knob hand craft beer heaven    Food portions aren't ginormous but presentation top notce very filling    Food Lobster Corn Dogs Shellfish Platter 1842 Burger comes caramelized onions mushrooms blue cheese truffle aioli  Lobster Roll   I'm total glutton when eating but delicious! even better satisfying hand craft beer! <EOR> It looked great place sit down quick laid back lunch  Unfortunately should known    anything Michael Mina any those things   Service slow despite coming lunch rush around 1pm  Waiter friendly but slow checking table   Ordered crab cake which sad dry fairly tasteless  Boyfriend ordered buffalo drumsticks which smelled odd didn't taste great either  breaded heavily dry!  Overall just good experience  also quite expensive eat even though food mediocre    I highly advise eat elsewhere! <EOR> We came dinner open 5 days  Michael Mina never disappointed food selections  ordered Hot Salted Pretzels 1842 Burger Lobster Roll PB Crunch Burger Mac Cheese Magical Mushrooms  Everything delicious! favorites Lobster Roll Magical Mushroom  PB Crunch Burger good but wouldn't order again other options menu  Service great back  <EOR> Went drinks CSI exhibit seafood restaurant before am glad now Michael Mina casual restaurant bar    The atmosphere very casual relaxing sat bar carded asked Bloody Mary extra spicy flavor bartender made very nice he blended some onions pickles put top drink refreshing different he gave mini tobacco add some extra flavor wow best Bloody Mary ever had! only $10 surprise few those didn't even bother try other drinks!
