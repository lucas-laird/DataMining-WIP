Went weekday evening dinner  place almost empty except few people bar area   interior restaurant designed lodge cabin theme cute comfortable  food typical pub food fairly priced  ordered burger fries which turned ok but bun way over buttered greasy  would recommend asking any kind sandwich bread lightly buttered  giving review extra star think deserves due server Misty she did great job! <EOR> Worst bar ever!
