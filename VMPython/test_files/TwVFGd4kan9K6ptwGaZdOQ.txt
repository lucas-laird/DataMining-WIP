Large noodles uneven lol expected handmade al dente ! noodles actually LOT larger wider expected to honest dont remember San Jose   small sharing bowl putting 3 strands noodles fills up  Thats big noodles were  Beef tender  Tendon soft  Flavor overall nice  little sour kick preserved vegetables probably   Next time wanna try regular noodles  Memory failing XD  Shanghai? style wonton friend wanted order this  Small wontons maybe 10 15 order seaweed soup broth Nothing special  recognizable amount shrimp wonton not sure if shanghai style shrimp? HK style certainly does   Wasn't favorite but least tried it?

This place should your radar if looking Taiwanese food   Just leery ordering white rice your dishes        <EOR> Went two different occasions    Mainly came beef rolls onion pancakes  They're decent but nothing wowed at    Service mediocre first visit but second visit just terrible aha  Couldn't even verify correct order because don't put table numbers order forms there's nothing reference to  We discrepancy something ordered thought ordered something else wanted order form verify  Service slow gotta wave your hands around ahold someone  Seems case whether lot customers if we're only ones    Found piece plastic soup seaweed  Sighs  seaweed soup seemed crunchy sandy texture eating sand something  friend already said she won't coming back    Really wanted better but yeah    First visit definitely better second terms overall experience  <EOR> Considering Liang's Kitchens all over Los Angeles expecting lot more Vegas  pork chop over rice ordered magically delicious breaded pork chop tasty overly breaded greasy  pickled veggies soy sauce egg minced pork came perfect every way    That's where fun ended  fried onion noodles everyone raves bland boring  dumplings ordered thought complete fail  filling overpowered white pepper  pretty much all could taste  Service pretty poor considering 1 2 tables entire place lunch  Drinks never refilled fountain sodas tasted horrendous probably haven't cleaned lines years ever  place no means terrible just considering all competition they're facing around would just move somewhere else  <EOR> Not all long ago restaurant used called Hot Feel but shuttered its doors even year business serving delicious lamb skewers spicy boiled crawfish   when heard friend said new restaurant logo lady part signage first thought could China Mama's second location   But obviously  correct guess     Liang's Kitchen ???? literal translation Liang Mama's House logo founder matriarch restaurant incorporated into signage now 80s Taiwanese comfort food restaurant chain California New York   locations many Cali cities previously lived worked before move Sin City   surprise reality check see some cities listed Cupertino Fremont Milpitas    But relatively long time those locations could opened already settled here   The interior Liang's Kitchen still retained majority interior design concepts custom built previous restaurant entity  albeit small but noticeable additions   inclusion prominent display vintage Flying Tigers* aviator jackets very very cool most people likely know anything its history high wall lighting draw attention anyone bothering quickly survey restaurant   Plus WWII Vietnam War era model fighter planes delicately hung ceiling sortie formation neato!      * 1st American Volunteer Group Chinese Air Force 1941 1942 nicknamed Flying Tigers composed pilots United States Army Air Corps Navy Marine Corps  Copy Paste excerpt Wiki The menu extensive following recent Chinese restaurant menu design practices especially abroad looks sales catalog professionally shoot images some menu items alternating pages straight advertising   looks good but also very annoying attribute lack thereof which absence any menu prices   [Insert comment if ask price can't afford it  Smirk face ]  know restauranteur's perspective sense saves money long run since don't reprint menu those tacky stickers every time revision menu pricing   separate menu sheet does menu items pricing but no pictures   if patience practice cross referencing main menu supplemental menu other printouts   Happy  Happy  Joy  Joy!  Food wise really liked Beef Tendon Soup Noodle ordered   definitely ranked top two list item Las Vegas   noodles thick chewy handmade variety Northern China  beef tendon cooked long enough soft very enjoyable eat   broth flavorful without being greasy   Lamb skewers good but thought bit pricey   lunch box items good variety pickled vegetables 1 entire soy sauced egg along rice whatever protein selected I ordered Taiwanese fried port cutlet friend she ate everything liked except pork greasy    Service good   However being new restaurant new staff still completely familiar pages pages menu items   But far refilling drinks being friendly good   I definitely back explore more menu   However considering dreary weather may past noodles section until late February   4 stars! best luck latest Taiwanese restaurant open Las Vegas  <EOR>
