The service great well  restaurant manager walked around tables prior show starting introduced himself asked if anything else needed  Service everything city Vegas topped list venues visit show restaurant bar next door outside showroom   The performers where incredible! Elvis impersonator lead singer really good entertainers know crowd engaged great spirits  dancers provided exciting entertaining performance especially when enveloped crowd acts  thought great all shows Las Vegas now days basically look movie theater instead engaging performance other shows tend just rows seats stage nothing else everything far away no basic interaction  different welcoming!  Their food!!! Although optional really can't full show without good meal  hungry  thought pineapple chicken delicious! started off nice light salad when main course came jaw dropped!   I recommend show anyone  Sometimes Cirque style shows old when every casino  Island Heat Show provides variety  <EOR> Only watched show used coupon bogo drink  drinks OK strong all  show seemed great older crowed consists 8 people all performing different dance songs  would never pay show but free tickets it  <EOR> Totally recommend show    Fun exciting great dancing singers  Most all food really good    Highly recommend mahi mahi  <EOR> I offered two free tickets see Island Heat show   never hear place   wasn't sure getting myself into main website some research  describe show as combining excitement Polynesian dance Las Vegas twist    Ohhhhhh sounds interesting give try    don't anything planned tonight anyways   When pick tickets show asked if wanted include dinner show $20   dinner provided three course meals starting Lua'ai salad Paola Macadamia White Chocolate Roll your choice entree Macadamia Crusted Mahi Mahi Teriyaki Flank Steak Ahi Tuna Pina Colada Chicken dessert   sounded delicious decided include dinner show   Food first course Lua'ai salad Paola bread   Lua'ai included some greens strawberry pineapple mozzarella cheese  According menu Paola supposed Macadamia white chocolate roll but instead given bread roll bits cranberry jam inside   guess ran out?  Anyways nothing stood dishes   ordered Macadamia Crusted Mahi Mahi   included decent size Mahi Mahi side rice bok choy   According menu suppose include mango salad but dish   Also rice dry harden   entree also okay nothing stood out   boyfriend ordered Teriyaki Flank Steak   cooked perfectly taste medium well definitely enjoyed better Mahi Mahi   dessert each given small piece cheesecake nothing stood well   Service first impression staff friendly   night impression staff changed   started off drinks   boyfriend ordered glass coke   noticed everyone else getting drinks some people getting food already yet he still haven't received coke he ordered   When boyfriend ask refill server said sure but never brought over another glass   things thing isn't big deal but big deal OVERCHARGED ME!  dinner itself $20 per person plus glass coke plus tax total should $47 but instead came almost $60 entire night! Apparently charged 20% taxes meal    unbelievable   top give option allowing put your own gratuity you   Show The show okay   expecting show full different element Polynesian dancing but instead more variety show   started Polynesian dancing then into segment Elvis impersonator then into segment motown doo wop music   enjoyed dancing singing pretty good especially female singer but still expecting more Hawaiian elements   When saw show group called Island Heat performing Kahunaville just few months   perhaps regular shows maybe completely different   also played Lilo Stitch which awesome!  Overall At first going give place rating 3 stars but looking menu while writing review noticed some items suppose plate wasn't servers never bothered let know it   Also didn't notice 20% taxes charged until writing review   show itself okay   definitely isn't worth charge which $39 99   conclusion would recommend place friend  <EOR> Had great time show  Dinner surprisingly good  Ambiance great  Service good too  Pleasantly surprised  Thanks Kahunaville making girls night Moms birthday memorable event  <EOR> Fantastic show!! Very upbeat    Great music hula dancers Elvis singing!! food great Pina Colada Chicken husband Teriakyi Flank Steak   Delicious!! meals came Paloa bread salad entree dessert   This must see show!!

First placed random table people didn't know back stage awkward   moved even though server said couldn't   food great drinks even included ridiculous price tickets   read YELP reviews excited see show but gawd awful!  singers horrible lady singer needed eat badly  wanted offer dinner since she looked she hadn't eating month    show just plain boring ended leaving half way through show because could listed horrible Elvis singer another second  supper annoyed just paid much money lame excuse show mediocre dinner  <EOR> I comped couple tickets see just show only  option ordering food which 20 bucks per person  Originally just gonna watch show but since never stepped foot place called Kahunaville located inside Treasure Island Hotel Casino curious food served here  gave decided share meal wifey    If refer picture menu took your meal starts off Bread macadamia white chocolate roll Salad mixed greens provolone pineapple strawberries mandarin oranges tomatoes pecans tossed balsamic vinaigrette topped fresh shaved toasted coconut  Then select main entree  chose Ahi Tuna pan seared yellow fin tuna served rare wasabi mashed potatoes baby bok choy ginger soy reduction  Lastly dessert we white chocolate covered cake pop   Drinks extra   The bread basically Hawaiian sweet roll raisins  seemed bit dry  Based description salad would think would give big bowl it  Turns only bit tiny amount each mentioned when actually dig into really isnt much substance it  finished pretty quick  main entree very good  fish encrusted ground pepper sliced into 6 thin pieces  very tasty but seemed more appetizer  Lastly cake pop dessert equivalent two bites  white chocolate gave good flavor   Service weird  first thing threw off share table complete strangers  table mates although nice seemed irritated Teriyaki Steaks ordered both well done even though wanted both medium rare  server assigned several tables times nowhere found  few times she did show seemed she hurry plates way even though done eating yet  worst part took forever check time receipt sign half people room already gone  Plus top gratuity 20 percent already added total even though only ordered  didnt think she deserved much tip let alone 20 percent   As show mediocre best  Starts some dude playing guitar singing couple Hawaiian songs while firing off liners audience see if anybody actually paying attention  Then comes Elvis impersonator singing yup guess more Hawaiian songs  seen plenty Elvis impersonators lifetime  guy all good  Eventually couple guys 3 girls come start Luau dancing while another lady comes lead singer does thing  alternated pretty much 1 hour 15 minute duration show   In end everything put together did impress much  entertainment 3 stars  food service along 1 star  good thing note drummer music dj father Bruno Mars! If anything something worth mentioning  if planning watching show recommend eat somewhere else just try enjoy show itself  Its bad but same time seen better  Come early good seats its general admission    Yelp 2015 Review #22 520 overall <EOR> Really enjoyed dinner show!

Mahi Mahi kids teriyaki steak  Yum! only complaint Vegan meal stir fried veggies rice charged $20 same 3 course meal when price restaurant menu same veggie meal $12 99  Show $60 per person 3 course dinner drinks included show $40 show only  Dinner yummy worth unless your vegan then order same meal upstairs almost half price  hahaha <EOR> I hard time figuring some reviews relate show saw   I no idea food did dine only addressing show   First all start time supposedly 8pm but didn't open doors until several minutes past point show itself didn't start until 8 55pm  a longer wait actual show  The website says 70 minutes  it wasn't  They cast 8  one guy stringed instrument sang bit guy percussion Elvis style singer I find impersonator strong word female singer obvious very good boob job two male dancers two female dancers which nowhere near expected looks even B list Vegas showgirl   I put male dancers quotes because far more jumping thumping anything would remotely call dancing   women actually doing Polynesian dancing  lots hand gestures lots booty shaking nothing remotely acrobatic   dancers off stage far longer would needed costume changes no set change no props beyond people hands   Attire men generally fabric hanging down front back something roughly approximating grass skirt the primary covering being bunch pieces hanging down attire women generally fancy but pretty well covering top piece normally bare belly usually something grass skirt genre down below   The men sometimes sticks sometimes spinning them women sometimes more flexible things spin   No hula hoops   The music **way** loud  I could understand if audience 20 somethings but few looked less 40   By Vegas standards heat ice cube  <EOR> Okay first all lighten before in  fun cheesy show if you're expecting shows pay triple you'll disappointed    We girl's weekend when found tickets show dinner lower cost  expectations weren't sky high but really fun night  salad rolls decent but main courses very tasty  piña colada chicken fantastic sampled teriyaki steak mahi mahi which both also good  entertainment fun  Songs sing along move dancers fun watch  put in  If you're sitting your seat bump log probably won't enjoy yourself much  But if into you'll come happier! <EOR> I'll begin saying Vegas local dread going strip  being said seen show five times now should say quite bit itself    I expecting much since dinner show but am always blown away authenticity ambiance food performers  Any tourist posting less glowing review needs realize hour long dinner show 39 95 3 hour Celine Dion concert Caesars Palace 300 bucks ticket  value ticket Island Heat well worth your money!

It's major headliner strip VARIETY SHOW don't high expectations anything just flow    ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter \uuu \uuu \uuu 3 <EOR> Not greatest show ever  But kinda doubt worst  did opt meal only watched show  8 year old daughter fun time  She really enjoyed dancing singing  much when Elvis singing  end show Uptown Funk performed  daughter really perked tune  much when asked performer she danced along! moment alone worth good star  <EOR> Not even Bruno Mars papa could save show    Got free tickets see show  Eating dinner extra but only $20 more  bad  supposed start 8 but aren't allowed until 815 actual show starting probably closer 840  Most likely due wanting all entrees before show starts    The food isn't worth it  best thing salad  its small size delicious  But then again drenched balsamic vinegar cheese surprising  sweet roll fine bit dry  main course four options  decided macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi trying most Hawaiian dish possible  ended being mistake  fish wasn't very warm over cooked soggy  Defeated purpose having macadamia nut crust  Rice bland bland bland  Dessert cheesecake which okay  worth $20    Now disclaimer seen luau Hawaii that  skeleton luau would but lacking ton    For there's no story through line show  Things just happen  dance then play song then horrible woman comes sings then there's another dance but glow sticks then Elvis comes then he leaves more glow sticks happen  wanted know little something why any happening    They don't prime audience show all  show just starts nowhere  Then look upset when people aren't applauding  Well hello can't just straight into show that  entree plates just set table turned off lights started show    The two male dancers first  longer hair into but bun he looked lost throughout first half show  He seemed concentrated move comes next face looked pain  No fun he doing  plagued most dancing bits    The best thing show Elvis impersonator  He doesn't necessarily look identical twin Elvis but he did belt tune  Also he having fun stage dance moves facial expressions did rolling  He did bring wife stage duet which he really didn't need but he awesome    Papa Mars pretty awesome percussion Kai did fine job all around utility man playing ukulele singing backup   Near end show seemed cast having better time but took long  Show isn't very long  930   One positive take picture papa Bruno Mara    Other Elvis impersonator papa Mars show wasn't worth it  few quick things could help show dancers having fun bit more story explanation lowering volume immensely but afraid those things won't happen  <EOR> Food acceptable but dollar dollar better Treasure Island   Thankful hotel did charge show would very disappointed paid it   If show free looking take family then probably okay but would definitely your way it  <EOR> This show seems little bit identity crisis    The show lacking energy did seem narrative point  just seemed did want sometimes   why Gloria Estefan song? then Elvis song? then glow stick dance  Also description show says beats Black Eyed Peas   and part missing  Just why any happening part Luau WOW   But also called Island Heat referring Cuba island hence Gloria Estefan song? am just making assumption because really no other indication it  Maybe hostess lady said something but sounds really loud she did enunciate very well may missed something    I also understand cannot use real fire show but use glow sticks instead during certain parts  But maybe could explain that? then maybe add some reasons why important certain cultures incorporate fire into ritualistic dance  Just suggestion because honestly show just seemed string dances musical numbers no real tie in  Kind talent show    The dinner very meh  liked beginning salad opted mahi mahi  Yikes bland over cooked  came side bland rice over steamed baby bok choy  little pile mango salsa parceled try tastier    Overall would recommend show point  could transition because shows kind seems is  needs production overhaul more interesting especially extremely competitive market strip shows  <EOR> What amazing show! music dancers singers authentic! highly recommend show all ages  highly recommend arriving early because seating first come first serve  rumor true Bruno Mars's father part band  definitely returning another show! <EOR> The show Kahunaville Treasure island very good    High energy music very upbeat   loved dinner actually ate same room show    lot dinner shows aren't same location thought great   price point good   Highly recommend families groups  <EOR> Meh   I received free tickets through job decided why not  dinner portion wasn't included but going add onto admission once because knew only $25 something 3 course meal looked menu online through website read each course entree really impressed thought I'd give shot  But then beloved Yelp decided read some reviews before purchasing dinner package glad did  pictures food definitely did live descriptions website reading reviews Yelpers seemed think same thing   I did order drinks though  ordered cocktail myself specialty drinks boyfriend  bill just 2 drinks $30 one thing keep mind gratuity automatically added onto bill regardless many people your party    As far show assumed going something along lines luau Tahitian hula dancers cultural performances etc  NOTHING lol  think 3 performances anything Tahitian hula  Other majority performances singing performances Elvis impersonator guy sang doo wop r b jazz songs Island Heat never know    Basically its VARIETY show  wasn't horrible but wasn't anything special either  If actually PAID admission that'd different story lol  <EOR> First want say show filled tons ENERGY!
