Really?  surly waitress might bad night but  no excuse being rude   manager apologetic made compensatory overtures which appreciated   difficult service right onset when guest enters dining drinking area?  all Las Vegas!  But Love Locals! ?  Why management blind quality level service such competitive environment?  economy dreadful staff hired without appropriate training hope things work ?  While Guadalajara Boulder Station stands example only venue suffering arrogant service staff ill equipped lack training business values imbued successful attractive destination   Re directing investments TV advertising staff training business execution result more demand word mouth repeat customers happy experience  <EOR> I 6 23 16 ordered shredded beef burrito  chomped down hard something metal nail something   complained offered new meal but disgusted food interested eating anything else  Found little later tooth chipped going tomorrow dentist that  does piece metal into food? hope investigated won't happen again anyone else  opted file complaint because only realized chipped tooth later already stressed over another situation related  <EOR> If they're open 11 bartender security officer unaware  Just standing looking stupid    Went viva salsa instead  Then home  gonna gamble if don't know when open  <EOR> Stopped great food waiter very attentive  Carne Asada platter yummy chips warm good bean dip salsa! <EOR> Stopped Mexican dinner OK nothing special salsa bar pretty mediocre everything almost tasted same  place needs updating tile chipped dirty looking  Had better other locations typical casino restaurant everything fast food restaurant  without being fast  <EOR> Hidden gem! love atmosphere  Staff always friendly smiling  Food amazing  Drinks awesome!

Yes Cabo place amongst fast food restaurants buffets other gaudy dining options casino but still worth look see     Went Sunday wasn't packed compared obscene lines buffet Boulder Station  service remarkably slow  bartender good 5 mins waiting hostess decided seat pity  took another 10 mins waitress come over give menus tell salsa bar   Now salsa bar true pearl  really enjoyed black bean dip! lawd tasty especially when add raw onions    !! salsa bar contained different cheese bean other salsa dips all waiting enjoy while your food being prepared  course would recommend black bean dip delightful buds even more charming traveled down gullet     For entrée choose Shrimp Tacos grilled shrimp avocado cabbage salsa blanca corn tortillas paired rice black beans  tacos marvelous  Nice plump shrimp well seasoned very flavorful  event liked cabbage over lettuce shreds really added texture entire dish  pretty darn tasty its price point second choice dining option   We able pay hotel credits didn't worry bill but 3 entrees less $50  reasonable    Besides lackluster service place pleasant! Would recommend esp if staying hotel  <EOR> Was impressed food  combo platter chile rellano good but tough pork tamale dry super doughy tasted sat back semi month shredded beef enchilada which par best  Refried beans weird film over them possibly sitting pot all day  Friend ordered Shrimp Fajitas return it  shrimps burnt beyond recognition whole skillet platter inch oil floating bottom  best part meal free chips salsa  Service waitress poor but soda chip guy kept beverages chips full never empty saving 1 star rating  Ya!!! low man totem pole chip drink guy  <EOR> Took family last night wasn't expecting much   pleasantly surprised adult children   Maybe because 1 1 13 everyone else still partying strip but seated immediately server Antonio table within minute   Food bit slow getting but well worth wait   and enjoyed chips salsa salsa bar while waiting   Antonio attentive appreciated he filled glasses often   I'm NON smoker would liked seated somewhere more away smell cigarettes but  only real complaint come with   Including tip $60 dinner 4 people exactly I'd expect   salad fresh HUGE son's steak fajitas cooked just right overdone daughter's chicken chimi platter also HUGE flavorful etc etc etc   Everything looked fresh tasted good too   I'll back but request seated more interior location away chance dealing cigarette cigar smoke interfering meal   proximity Havana Lounge nearby may something too!?! <EOR> Had made plans meet friend catch up  Thought place would good since close where live    The cigarette smoke completely wraps around here  smell strong only sat eat left soon could  very pungent just ruins food    The waiter very attentive nice  food nothing amazing would way get  corona mixed margarita weak  <EOR> Cold tacos funny tasting shrimp burrito poor service explains why told mandatory 18% tip  Stay away! <EOR> I think experience review eating Cabo Mexican restaurant would different if would slightly tipsy drinking  giant margarita   too bad completely sober though!
