Vegefest 2017   So let's start pro's experience  The chicken burger flavorful moist significant serving size   cheesy fries good but soggy amount cheese serving    Now cons   The Big Veg wasn't worth $12 hyped online advertisement  Didn't realize actually curry burger if don't curry try original  serving size decent burger itself moist    The service booth during Vegefest 1 10  line hour long  No joke actually stood line just hour  register open girl behind register nice but efficient enough work booth  takes hustle work quickly efficiently festival booth many don't ability master this  4 employees actually seemed hustle needed work something this  stood watched entire operation seems though business could use great deal consulting efficiency working smarter  Many customers opted forego waiting line could actually damage profit  asked why wasn't second line orders eliminate hour wait she stated planned another open but girl called   Well okay  point designate another person better yet business owner point time roll your sleeves dig when see help needed  However owner stood off side watched cluelessly employees scrambled sense massive rush  suggested maybe another employee start taking orders line eliminate some unnecessary wait she commented then cook backed   Hmm  Okay again  continued watch management team owners primarily stand around look deer headlights customers complained point getting free French fries inconvenience  Funny business owners wife stood just watched chaos without lifting finger and offer help out  sad  Sometimes people more concerned looking good rather being good    In all no way point time would recommend any $12 burger options  Given lack service inadequate management could justify making any recommendation  Hopefully operation better maybe invest business consultant together  <EOR> Yum!!!!
