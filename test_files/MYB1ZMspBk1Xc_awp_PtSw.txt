Why four stars? Frequently under staffed long wait times sometimes phone isn't answered expensive  However quality speaks itself    <EOR> Let tell food amazing  customer service terrible  4 times 3 times messed something up  CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE LEAVE!  Last time ordered wings pizza made wings but pizza  time before told 25 mins come pick up  wait additional 20 more mins because weren't ready guessing messed someone else's order  top 1 4 sheet missing toppings    Today ordered pizza wings w fries  check order pizza wrong toppings wings don't fries  place really frustrating bc food awesome! Unfortunately staff can't trusted anything right  Ironically always different people working every time  fix mistakes but time home wings pizza cold nasty  Just right first time! much ask? If going OVERPAY food need done right  Unfortunately losing loyal customer  guess NYer find decent pizza else where  CHECK YOUR ORDERS people  <EOR> This place gonna problem    I worked next Arville used guinea ALL time      and now literally 3 blocks house     hello pounds!!!!

Stop today give them some your business  even order using yelp app grab way home  Quit ordering chain pizza places!! <EOR> One favorite places course skeptical first time small window order food inside bar but delicious everytime <EOR> Wasted half hour trying order uber eats  placed order waited 10 minutes then would cancelled  did couple times  Uber eats customer support said resturant cancelling order  thanks nothing  <EOR> Had chicken finger pizza very delicious portion sizes prefect  definitely recommend  try out <EOR> Yummy Pizza!! Back Home pizza least 4 times just Rebel    consistency flavor always meet expectations!  definitely pay Naked City! disappointed! If your lucky delicious lunch next day  <EOR> Doesn't seem sanitary me     I extremely excited try place because reviews photos pizza online  base almost everything off reviews because reviews peers always tell story granted always garbage reviews negligible   regardless  experience terrible    First off if step inside disgusted unless ordering food smoke pit  early evening left two minutes smelling ash try  guy working super nice however woman extremely rude other employee while he taking order  Talking condescending fashion yelling while he talking us  great second impression  Once told would 40 min wait decided leave come back next time try didn't feel waiting tonight  leaving two minutes previously stated couldn't believe much smelled smoke  Thinking concerned pizza shop constantly open bar  don't idea food being exposed smoke 24 7 prior even getting prepared   I see other reviews talking smoke most people ordering delivery  If those order delivery saw atmosphere your food prepared sure wouldn't enthused product   Don't wrong love bar food frequent others town however cook area never open smoke area   never experience! Whether door something divides them  ordering window always open meaning food always exposed point all food back soaking smoke all people bar last few weeks   disgusting more think it    In end never ate product although sure might good just might try another location   definitely one <EOR> Food definite 4 5 stars My experience last night brought rating down 3  I beyond exited Naked Coty Pizza open right down street Mnt Edge  original location inside Moon Doggies fan!! Not mention featured Diners Drive Ins Dives    huge fan show So happens when pouring down rain all day mommy doesn't want cook   you order pizza course  I looked Yelp reviews menu NCP website where suggested Uber Eats downloaded app ready order  I placed order around 5pm app said delivery would around 556pm     perfect timing because usually dinner around 6pm!! Let's talk food    ordered 1 4 sheet which 6 slices two 1 2 sheet pizza along wings fingers garlic fries   Food point sauce pizza tad salty pizza could used couple more toppings but whatever freaking good!!! Now problem     said Uber Eats quoted delivery around 556pm know always accurate but delivery time jumped 651pm time supposed receiving food  After 2 calls Uber Eats finally told restaurant didn't see order hadn't made  why added hour time  I mistakes happen but could called   it mistake  Anyway finally food around 642 hungry didn't take pics but trust when say GOOD! I order again hope food time  Best luck NCP great product!! <EOR> I always delivery never stepped foot place but family yet disappointed Naked City Pizza Express  ordered everything plain cheese chicken finger pizza all good  don't usually notice details when comes food but Naked City does something crust keeps going back more    The only reason don't give place 5 stars because prices liiiiiiiittle steep  said certainly pay for    If you're area don't afraid hit place won't disappointed! <EOR> I really excited open very limited good pizza spots area  located inside Blue Diamond Saloon which very smokey bothersome some  Depending long wait your pizza potentially come smelling ashtray    Pizza ordered Back Home which most part good just little salty taste  sure if sauce cheese sauce cheese    We also ordered garlic buns which salty well most burnt bottom    I think next time try another pizza give another shot  Lastly don't own in house delivery crew  thru Uber Eats Bite Squad  sure Bite Squad but Uber Eats charges $4 99 fee just did pick up  <EOR> Pizza awesome  Garlic knots must try! Service awful always rude act customers inconvenience  Takes 40 minutes order plan accordingly  <EOR> Uber eats delivery    first time trying food  pizza meatballs   Omg  amazing  wings which daughter ate she eats nothing    order them again <EOR> Horrible   Came pizza  Nobody available help  Asked pizza lady teoce if she online order she kept saying no  told id order ahead since im already but she wasnt paying any attention understand customer wants pizza  Left because dont want deal any poor service  <EOR> Okay usually full restaurant Paradise but area blue diamond Rainbow decided try Naked City Pizza Express glad did very good just back home New York thin thick lots cheese very fresh hot customer service guy working awesome  ordered half sheet half cheese half mushroom delicious  <EOR> After all hype given local people tried place  food okay exceptional  pricey amount served  place bar pick window  horrible food but most likely back  am still hunt great East Coast Pizza Vegas  <EOR> I ordered uber eats national pizza day  excited try new pizza express   pizza arrived fast hot   ordered white garlic sauce 2 items double cheese   Cheese more generous dbl cheese order  #1 pet peeve toppings when charged considerable amount each additional item but pizza shows looking cheese pizza couple zits   Sorry many unlimited item pizza places quality ingredients nowadays  find infuriating pay items 1 2 pepperoni per slice 1 2 sausage per slice  If items unimportant think place fine  <EOR> First time ordering most likely last  truly excited finally try saw Triple D ordered Guinea Pie Naked Salad   ordered using Grub Hub live approx mile away location  feeling well otherwise would myself  Anyway email grub hub said order should 630 645  No problem maybe 30 45 min  Ended arriving little 7  Once again problem close enough  eagerly grabbed food delivery girl ran inside wife children waiting  Upon opening pizza box could tell little over cooked burnt some standards   figured well lets give shot  Took first bites biting into stale cardboard lol  crust hard dog tried bury it In yard she never lets pizza crust waste  wife says must freezing dough then cooking it  difficult eat say least  said least salad  asked Ranch put side if possible instead vinaigrette vinaigrette anyway  sure if its option  salad supposed iceberg lettuce spinach contained only spinach  Luckily $10 off grub hub otherwise if would spent almost $40 pizza salad would pissed kind quality  If am going spend kind money pizza should good better Grimaldis road  Never issue there  disappointed  <EOR> Friendly service food EXACTLY other Naked City locations  Wings damn near perfect can't wrong Grandmas Meatball pizza!!!
