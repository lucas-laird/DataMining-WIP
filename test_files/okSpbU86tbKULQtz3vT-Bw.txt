I am sure why am giving them 3 stars   service friendly but horribly slow   food always seems hot fresh   Today ridiculous   2nd car line waiting order took 15 minutes   Then took even longer window   cashier apologized profusely saying slammed restaurant only 2 them working   He offered free drink wait   declined but appreciate offer   When he gave food he said he threw some free cheese sauce fries which nice gesture   I think reason don't see lot Arby's other chains   product isn't great extremely overpriced   yourself favor your beef 'n cheddars home  <EOR>
