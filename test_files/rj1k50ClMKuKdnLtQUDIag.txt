Horrible old food horrible costumer service food gross big mistake choosing place <EOR> This place open previously reported being closed  Given experience restaurant should really close  employees rude  given Japanese name restaurant actually serve mediocre Chinese food  only Japanese dish place udon sushi tempura  <EOR> Entrees look smell good but disappointed taste  around 5 30pm Monday busy thought good sign  Boy wrong! took couple bites threw rest away   bad was  Another review mentioned seems serving leftovers  exactly tastes!   Sadly haven't found any good places food court  Luckily many restaurants mall  <EOR> The food just alright  workers aren't very friendly hesitate giving extra utensils napkins    If need grab quick bite eat then guess convenient option  Definitely better though  <EOR> Ichiban fast food spot located within Fashion Mall across Wynn   UFO shaped mall large food court lots choose but Ichiban probably your best bets   Ichiban Chinese fast food restaurant serves quality tasty food reasonable price   Whenever visiting Vegas point stop Ichiban plate delicious teriyaki chicken vegetable fried rice   teriyaki chicken bursts flavor its drenched teriyaki sauce   chicken itself tender tasty nicely grilled great fried rice   addition Mongolian beef also worth trying bit spice tingle taste buds   The food portions large more enough fill up   cost two entrees fried rice $6 add drink your total comes $8 some change   highly suggest trying Ichiban you'll love teriyaki chicken  <EOR> It lunch time decided eat food court  ordered bento meal which sesame chicken teriyaki chicken fried rice  When took bite chicken sides cold seems serving leftovers  Both chicken tasteless bland  fried rice no flavor   You're best eating Panda Express place  never eat again  <EOR> Nice lunch spot Fashion Show Mall close where work  Everytime eaten food always fresh The sesame chicken teriyaki very good rice  judge Asian places well rice  know weird but can't stand rice isn't soft fluffy  If can't pick chopsticks no me  seems recently offering small sushi selection  ordered some inarizushi surprised when clerk told would 5 minutes  only did right then but made way it  Inari needs sesame seeds did right! <EOR> Tastes straight garbage  Don't it  should business  udon chow mein tastes really funky  <EOR> YUM!  Don't Panda Express  kinda sucks  If making decision between two Asian Influenced food court places Fashion Show Mall most definitely better two   They only better tasting food but happen think quality great too  also more unique interesting choices opposed Panda Express tofu seaweed salad tempura shrimp sushi   Always friendly service quick well  <EOR> Noodles disgusting  spiced top ramen  ruined everything  Anything touched  Teriyaki chicken nothing special  Sesame chicken bone it  Drinks way overpriced  Egg drop soup alright  There's reason there's no line establishment  <EOR> I'm sorry say Ichiban really good place eat  Actually whole food court mall could way better deeper level! If you're planning eat really intent eating here   I would say best all dishes would chicken teriyaki    On plate chicken noodles shrimp tempura  All painstakingly dry very well seasoned  None really warm either  probably ever going eat again  plus side people working very polite nice!   The food court worst places eat entire Fashion Show Mall  FSM please reinvent your FC because place just big that bad  <EOR> Ichiban mall version  live action hibachi spot hoped for more grassroots Panda Express  quick bite reasonable price when you're shopping mission  opted vegetables instead noodles rice two entrees teriyaki chicken eggplant  vegetables off putting flavor  would call again  type spot eggplant dish heavy sauce but nice flavor chicken flavorful tender  three dishes good aok solid  may better results elsewhere  <EOR> I work mall hard find good affordable place eat  Ichiban offers plate fried rice two sides $5 89 + mall discount which unbeatable  only good prices but food flavorful generously portioned  Try chicken curry    it some best   Enjoy! <EOR> Convenient location within fashion show mall provided mixed categories so called Chinese Japanese cuisines but could expect much food court  Reasonable priced items  <EOR> One best sushi had  Ordered tuna sushi Philadelphia rolls dragon rolls las Vegas rolls shrimp tempura rolls  Also excellent miso soup mango Mochi ice cream  All incredibly tasty delicious  wish wouldve ordered tuna sashimi  Buttery fresh delicious  Well worth considering location basement Bally's  <EOR>
