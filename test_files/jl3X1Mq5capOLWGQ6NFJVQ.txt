Great value it   always associate family eateries being friendly ever but owners kinda intimidating  family busy yelling each other over smallest things made ambience really awkward  didnt mind waiting 25 minutes pizzas quoted 15 minutes but felt bad other customers wait much longer just dine in  Honestly given price food quality surprised packed  noticed great deal 50 wings 20 inch pizza $29 $27 forget     all UNLV decorations whatnot   dining area looks very family friendly space seating it  Maybe should play some music loud enough dont really hear them fighting kitchen wait times wont feel long  would come back again pepperoni pizza! <EOR> I can't even begin say excited am place opened across street UNLV taking vacant spot left open Rebel Pizza   Simply put best cheap pizza find town   I pretty stoked when saw $3 99 Large Cheese Pizza $1 extra buddy opted Pepperoni Pizza  didn't dissapoint all! sauce pretty tasty crust warm pepperoni delicious    On counter free samples garlic knots  WOW  order next time come in  extremely tasty   On another visit meatball sandwich $3 99 also excellent    The owners really nice people well they've spruced place lot  even sofa complete table full magazines peruse while eat   This MUST EAT! <EOR> Super greasy really cheap prices but somehow still retained some quality food  pizzas pretty good  wouldn't ever crave them but wouldn't opposed going if someone suggested it   The brownies really good! <EOR> This best pizza ever eat but pretty good most all $3 99  Seriously  whole pie  pay much slice down street Joe's NY    The new owners cool Dominic old guy Italy lady gave some homeless people free pizza while there    Atmosphere isn't bad $3 99 pizza place   I split pepperoni pizza husband almost finished it  Between 2 drinks ate $7 change  If you're around UNLV you're budget Whazzup should top your list  <EOR> My Rebel's PIzza came back but less drama much more cleanliness now family owned place   They've redecorated given place more family friendly atmosphere food better quality even  menu lot more item choices including beer battered onion rings now    I've pretty much given other pizza joints area solely stick place take out pizza  only downside restaurant portion because old building gets hotter Hades sometimes during summer days    14 cheese pizza still $3 99 topping $5  Can't really especially since competitors Big Mama's jacked carry out price $10 99 now    <EOR> I gone location when Angelina's Pizza stooped 2 times far pizza wings special $6 99 very good staff nice  The air condition doesn't work don't think  <EOR>
