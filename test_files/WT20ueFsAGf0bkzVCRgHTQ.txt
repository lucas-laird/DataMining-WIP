Now let's discuss cons  While found couldn't order food until 8 whatever reason but already 7 30 didn't really mind  ordered 8 20 but food didn't come until 8 50 which thought bit ridiculous box wings fries  actually suppose TWO boxes fries but only ended only did food take forever but part missing  friends ask food girl's response she'd call see where was  Call who? thought food coming place directly but guess not  bit sketchy I'd know where food coming ya know? wings $12 fries $6 bit pricey food which only mediocre best  Although bar typical cigarette's fuming through air bit turn off  legit hot box but cigarette's end smelling but eh do?  At end paid $47 but additional $8 which paid upfront two strawberrita's $55  5 total shabby! Although food part sucked little still return genuinely enjoyed time! Side note If sick probably don't want here! boyfriend mild cold coughing lot because smoke  Just little tip  <EOR> It great hang spot!  It basically would expect pool bar be  prepared inhale lot secondhand smoke! expected since bar     There never wait time any tables here   huge place plenty tables!  prices reasonable! around $8 10 hour per table  seats tables around table   happy hour drinks but bad 21 yet    From experience don't seem mind if bring drinks food Icy Juicy next door even though no outside food drinks sign front window  Just don't near table    The bathrooms surprise every time  Sometimes very clean sometimes very dirty  guess just lucky   There nice music! Bring some cash song requests jukebox! <EOR> Pool sticks straight good  Music choice enjoyable everyone  Pizza didn't tell until ordered kind sucked  customer service good guy short black hair much everyone else  But gave free strawberita birthday really sweet  Overall visit ok just don't think experience worth money  15$ hour table because extra friend didn't even play all basically pay sit there  $6 small serving alright French fries  <EOR>
