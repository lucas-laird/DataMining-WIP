The people there was nice and didn't mind talking. A pool league was playing was tgat was interesting to watch. 

I don't know how this place was in the past, but my experince was great.   The bartender was interactive with the patrons. She made an awesome drink.

I would definitely go back if i have the opportunity.

They are definitely  Raider fans. I prefer the Packers!",g7BVhNukAjCVvaWmt7I1wg,0,1,5,4z2t8FsxDpclvEHBJ-vnTg

They have a couple of pool tables and had a dj. My girlfriends and I had the best ASADA FRIES N GARLIC PARMESAN FRIES EVER!!! The only disappointment was, the blonde bartender took forever to serve us our drinks but overall it was a fun atmosphere :) we will definitely be back.",AsztyRUc8gNI4tLB9vXzNw,0,0,4,2Ah4rIuwgqX8A1EyAkjJOQ

All bars with super fans are crazy. lol. Inside it looked on the old side. But Vegas is old.  I'm just used to newer parts of Vegas.",5Bs1BZcD6_wo_sUiAGe7FA,0,0,4,gZk19sIPDrUo-ZEaE0SgYg

New owners come in fire all the bartenders FOR WHAT?!?! An over weight, non personality having, 1980's perm wearing NOBODY! Who is to busy flirting with the guys playing pool to serve paying customers!?!?!?!!? Are y'all serious? The place is so dead the bartenders personality is dead. And the sad looking girl charged me for drinks when I had money in the machine, which should have been comped cause i was playing. That goes to show how desperate they are for money.

All in all I wont be coming back thanks for ruining my neighborhood bar by firing all the dope bartenders for your wack a$$ wife to bartender who sucks and is too busy flirting with the customers over pool to serve us.

Yall ruined a good neighborhood bar! Wont ever be coming back thanks!",MQciyEW0cWflRuLOdLvK7w,1,2,1,iGvJt3rUBYXxkYPx42O4iA

The atmosphere is very, ""Cheers"" like for the fact that everyone was friendly and inviting.  Justin happened to be my bartender on this particular occasion.  Kudos to Justin on his unparalleled guest service.  I will definitely come back to this establishment.  Thank you for such a wonderful experience!!!

Happy hour sampler platter was amazing.  Also beers are cheap and the atmosphere is great!",Y6otbk7H7mDMbXBVKL9yeA,1,0,5,k4q3Jg6daPqlCX-FuWA0Rw

THe bartenders there are range from super nice and great with drinks to inattentive at worst, but they never get in the way. The best part of this place is that the drinks are super cheap Happy hour or not, you can get your moneys worth of whatever you want. Whats also cool about this bar is that they have comedy shows occasionally and on saturdays they do karaoke, which never falls short of entertaining. Its a great local bar, and its one that likely gets passed by because of its location and that the exterior doesn't make it stand out at all. But if you like dive bars then this'll be a great place for you",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,5,1,3,_FcsM_dMfwSwfFeLW1vx8A
