Prices are reasonable $20 gets you a nice size plate. Makes you want to order more for another day.  He delivers and the food is still fresh and hot.  I'll order more food on Friday and you should too.
Try it you'll like it.  Love and hugs",j0XCPk62sIlU3sLWUfq-eA,0,1,5,iHjG5NPcrfFWaA4RLCnK5Q

Until I saw Jamaican Joint Catering on Instagram and decided to go ahead and place an order ! I ordered the ox tails and my boyfriend got the jerk chicken but he ate the rest of mines  but the food was great and as soon as i tried it i knew i found what i was looking for",3oraoz2Xf_4mmHwIB7ERUQ,0,1,5,sYajgDOdlXWvay5BmeOjKA
