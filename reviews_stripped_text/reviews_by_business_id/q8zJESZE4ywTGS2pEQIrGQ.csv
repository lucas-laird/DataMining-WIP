582631,2015-02-01,1,q8zJESZE4ywTGS2pEQIrGQ,Mexican Food is suppose to be a lot when they serve you Chips and Salsa. We had to pay extra $6.95 and the plate has ten tortilla chips and about 2 spoon of beans. The service is horrible. That poor girl is clueless and is over price for the area first and last time at this place. Tables are dirty. Why do thy have ten people cooking and one waitress who does everything in the front of the house ? No very friendly people. Food is just OK.,jMcpKfUQ43p2iBXMji6U5g,0,0,1,XPxRgR_iAS9Hws8KmHkHCg

La comida es sabrosa pero el servicio ultimamente vale pura m****e. Se save que al ir ahi, se tiene que esperar para que le asignen una mesa, sobretodo en dia que se supone es un dia super ocupado como lo fue el dia del padre. Despues de esperar mas de 30 minutos por una mesa la persona tomando nombres estaba mas interesada en seguir tomando nombres que en atender a Las personas ya sentadas!!! Despues de esperar mas de 30 minutos por la mesa, no nos trajieron menus ni se acerco nadie para nada!! Gente Que yego despues Que yo y mi familia recibiendo su comida y a nosotros ni el menu!!!  Deveras Que mal servicio! Hasta Que nos cansamos de esperar y mejor nos fuimos... Despues de esperar en total mas de 1hra!!!",wFIPYyjH2N7cmJI09P9nlg,0,0,1,P0u7SdzzchkTK2hWaSFmQQ

El conzome super frio.  Te lo sirven si cuchara,  cebolla,  cilantro.  Pides cilantro y no tienen. Necesitan alguien que sepa de pantry.  La cebolla te lan dan casi, entera para los tacos.  Dos ocasiones que hemos venido siempre no tienen algo.  Si no es cilatranto o es carne en su jugo..  Buena comida pero pasar corajes cada que visitas el restaurante y pasar decepción no vale la pena. Me lo recomendaron tanto que ya los dos veces que vengo y siempre es la misma situación.  Les di 2 oportunidades,  y cada vez es peor.  No importa que horario visites el restaurante siempre es lo mismo.  Suerte si lo, pruebas.",l9Y1D2kF4_DLcNSUMNBybw,0,0,1,MpInmeAm33isZRj2ef1-Jw

My father comes from Guadalajara and my mother makes the exact same dishes as this place. Authenctic. Everything we had was great tasting with lots of flavor.

My wife had menudo, chilaquiles with egg, and a Carne asada taco. Lol I helped out also. I had a Carnes en su jugo a dish unique to the region in mexico. Must taste it. Would visit this place again on my way back home to Phoenix.",zFUiOavuMbb-QK81jWQNjQ,2,1,5,_Hvmdi9cC2yPDkXo0j-dFA

I hit the last seat at a community table and I even went to lunch way early on a weekday because I was told it can be hard to get into.  I was the only Gringo in the joint and it reminded me of my old Mexican Grandmother's kitchen that only exists in my mind as I eat so much Mexican I often think I am Mexican.  Loved the energy inside.  Service was excellent.  Other customers made suggestions.  Went with the Octopus Enchiladas purely based on the photo I  their menu.  Plate was full and smothered in goodness.  Was ok but next time I'll stick to traditional stuff as I don't like Octopus that much.
