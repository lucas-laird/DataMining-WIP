The green and red sauce were both a great addition to my meal. I'd come back for sure!",7AaP9A8V2S_47xD04Xo8HQ,0,0,5,p2iskDbp77h-fjB4qRhBpA

I've come in before the change but never tried the food. I stopped by today as I always planned to, and it has changed. New paint and graphics outdoor. New menu. It looks like a new business once you're inside. 

No photos of food/pates except for what's displayed outside on the windows. I asked what ""Mulitas"" was and the lady at the counter didn't even know. I was really disappointed that they got rid of the Central American menu except for pupusas and platanos. In fact, I ordered a plate of fried plantains and cream but that same lady at the counter forgot to add it. So I never did get those plantains. 

My husband (not Hispanic) assumed the Combination plate meant COMBINATION of meats. But that lady at the counter asked for meat choice. So he was bummed about that but asked for Carne Asada. In all other restaurants, both high end as well as mom & pop... even in Mexico and Latin America- a Carne Asada entree plate includes a whole piece of meat. So why is it that we get this plate with small pieces of meat? If my husband wanted tacos he would have ordered tacos... I mean.... it is downright insulting to pay $9 for rice, beans, and enough meat for 2 tacos.... it tasted good, but it doesn't satisfy a big eater in any way. 

The horchata wasn't very good either. Tasted like tap water is used. It was bland and cheap tasting. 

The food tasted good but I wouldn't come back.",CBWiAM9pP6w4Jg-PoeV2rg,1,0,2,0A-O7nNG-_UaXd-XfKONZQ

4101685,2018-04-19,0,0pJiZDiKz1dfx5CIjce5XQ,I went in cause I ordered through GrubHub and got a steak torta. My mouth watered so bad just smelling the food and I was super satisfied when I ate it. It's really a delicious place to eat.,vuIRBVV7ofWNiUoXJEXDXg,0,0,4,PbvpNbFHrfSRAnLK4RcAHg
4151838,2018-05-29,0,0pJiZDiKz1dfx5CIjce5XQ,"Okay! I'm going to be nothing but real here. Hopefully this review is not TOO long. 
For starters I never really had intentions on eating here I needed to use the restroom really bad and then my girlfriend came in, and I admit we were both starving after a long day of being out & about. They had young boy at the cash register or taking orders. Whichever one. He was pretty nice and it's good that they are teaching him these skills early on. That's not where my problem lies. 
Before I go into detail, it WAS indeed near closing time. Which I should had taken that into consideration BEFORE I ordered. 
We got steak enchiladas from there with extra sour cream and cheese. The people were very nice it was a man and a woman. My problem is not with the place or the service. It's with the FOOD!
I was enraged when I got home and opened up my plate. It was soooo DRIED out. Like the sauce was not even sauce seriously. The man told us to be careful so nothing spilled. Both of our plates were dry. I couldn't believe it. So anyways I didn't care the inside should have been good. With all the extra sides we got. Which by the way cost a dollar per each plate -__- the food was horrible guys. I'm sorry. I really really wanted to like this place because the lady was so nice even telling me to write a review and before i got my food i was going to do a 5 Star review. But i couldn't man. I just couldn't. The steak was soooo dry and it was like it was OLD! It wasn't even lol real steak. It was shredded beef i guess. But it was so long and you couldn't even chew it. I was beyond disgusted because we spent over $20 on our food. 
I was going to call them and have them make me a new plate but then again i didn't even want to drive out my way. I woulda been more pissed. 
The only reason why I'm giving 3 stars instead of two is because i really believe because it was the end of the night the food was old so maybe it's better in the day time. I hope. Idk. But next time if your food is bad just say you're out please. Just say there is no more. Because no food is better than bad food in my experience. Especially  if you're running a business.  I heard it's under new management which it did seem that way since she asked me to post a review. But y'all have to do better. Please.",F-EIPzi6AckDsRj0Q8C1Rg,0,0,3,VxFNGJkL8Kix-25HMAXLCw

The chef is here cooking up a storm. I ended up ordering what I saw him cooking on the grill. The pupusas are delicious! The queso pupusas were my fave! The chilaquiles were fresh and flavorful. The steak pieces were scrumptious. The server was friendly and very helpful. The chef was cool. I rarely dine in but I had to try the food fresh. 

I returned again on a weekend and it was PACKED. Definitely one of my new faves.",f587WkOuLAotgXOVAybylA,0,0,5,pH88X30MUJj2nqfdz6TqoQ
