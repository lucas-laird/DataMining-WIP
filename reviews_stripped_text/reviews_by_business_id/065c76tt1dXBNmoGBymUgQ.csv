We tried the Classic Cheffinis (grilled frank, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos, mozzarella, crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup) except we had them leave off the jalepenos.  Just reading this list, the two that seemed unusual where the potato chips and pineapple sauce.  I'd never had potato chips on a hot dog like this, but I was completely confident they would work great.  But, I admit that I had some doubt about the pineapple sauce.  I shouldn't have.  The sweet tanginess blended perfectly with other flavors.

They also earn bonus points for free refills on the lemonade.",LpRQnAJGw8xhH0_6SNUZ7A,0,0,4,95NxtWgPrWwOL0mFHor10w

- Service: Okay. Lady taking orders and serving food seemed pretty annoyed to be there and having to talk to us, but still have recommendations. She was polite enough to speak when bringing our hot food to our outdoor table. 
-Physical setup: Cool little place. Small space inside, but can seat groups of 2-4 easily. Plenty of outdoor seating for groups.

527880,2016-06-06,1,065c76tt1dXBNmoGBymUgQ,"Looking for something different in Las Vegas, we headed over to the Container Park in Downtown Las Vegas. After some shopping and watching my son play in the big playground, we got hungry and chose to try Cheffini's Hot Dogs. They specialize in hot dogs, but that's not all they offer. You can get burger sliders, empanadas, shakes, etc.

You might feel a little claustrophobic when you walk in. After all, the entire establishment fits in one or two shipping containers. But that's part of the charm of this place. They have a good menu with plenty of options. But here's what we got:

Me: The El Mexicano. A sirloin hotdog wrapped in bacon. Comes with avocado, tomatoes, green sauce, chipotle guava, garlic aioli, cherry pepper relish and cilantro. It was delicious! I could have eat two if I didn't order fries. Every bite was bursting with flavor.

Wife: My wife ordered a vegan dog which she loved. She also got fries with chimichurri sauce. There are toppings that you can pile on your fries. The fries can be shared with two people.

Son: My son got the crunchy dog which comes notably with crushed potato chips and bacon bits.

There is a good selection of toppings and sauces for dogs and fries. They had beer available, but I opted for ice tea, which was very good. The prices are good and the staff is friendly. After finishing our meal, we hung out at the park and watched kids jam on stage. They were from the ""School of Rock"".

I loved the menu. Tons of variation between their dogs. The only thing I was bummed about was that I didn't have anyone else with me to justify getting more hot dogs to try. 

I got the Panchero because I love chorizo. (My four year old said next time he's getting that one ). But I also got the Moshi Moshi (spicy) which took the cake between the two. I ate half of each and brought the remainder home for the roomie just to share the experience. 
My kiddo got a plain hotdog with ketchup and mustard and he was all over it. (Kids can be in Container Park until 9pm.)
Sauces are free. You can customize your dogs or order whichever of the many dogs they offer. 
I'm not a hotdog person (I maybe eat 1per year) but they have me wanting to go back for more. 
Draft and bottled beers are offered and they have different happy hour deals.

The next day returned at lunch and it was busy but fairly fast checked in and received a free soda. Stared at the menu for awhile because I was having a tough time on deciding which dog to get, they all looked so good! 
Finally went with The Godfather and it was very delicious. I would of never thought of some of the toppings going together like the mango with red bell pepper haha but with all the other goodness on there it did very well! Would gladly eat again. 
The only thing I'd change if I could would be to have a larger dog or even a sausage option

There are a lot!

Fancy toppings, a vegan dog, potato chip topping......I was really excited! Hubby and I wanted a snack so we decided to split one.

She made a suggestion that the style with the seaweed on it is super good. Sounds good but it has mayo and stuff on it.

We opted for a vegan dog with sweet relish (they have spicy also), mustard, and potato chips :))))) we had water so we didn't need a drink. I saw two taps so I think they even offer beer. 

Then the downer...your total is $7.xx. With a smile. Ok. That's about as much as a Field Roast dog at ATT Park! Ouch! Ok.
I really never mind high prices it's really normal in casinos and also in the vendors at CP but for some reason I found it off putting tonight. Note: vegan dogs are $1 more than regular. 

Anyway the lovely lady also offered that they slice it in half because we were sharing.

Within a few short minutes we had our hot dog. It was good. Really good actually. It was the bun that was a total turn on. Soft in the middle with a few outer areas that were crisp almost (no it was not stale).

All in all we really enjoy the two bites each that we had and really could eat more. I didn't really ask hubby what he thought about the price, but I will. Maybe he is just used to the CP markup.

Go splurge on a fancy hotdog, have one of those loaded up topping ones. Now that I look...most of those are around $7-9. So I guess we got a deal?",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,4,4,3,sRzvMgdly59d8oeiiHp13Q

Chili fries are always a good idea.... makes no sense to only offer them on weekends. I'm a local and avoid the strip / downtown on weekends as it's way too crowded for comfort, so I probably won't be back.",WprLWLMfdlbstGuCQvUHJQ,0,0,3,rgcvs09w2b6y95djY_w9pw

The staff were bickering with each other about how to expedite the orders and when to close the coffee shop next door. I placed my order ( 1 naked dog and two kids meals with sliders). After 20 minutes of waiting I was told they didn't have anymore sliders and I could either get my money back or get a hotdog instead. I chose hot dog since I had already waited so long. A few minutes later the cashier came to one of the guys dining and told him he gave him an extra elder by mistake. The guy said, "" I haven't touched it"" and the cashier took it. Another 10 minutes past and I received 1slider which was supposed to have the special sauce. No sauce. I also received the hot dog that was substituted for the slider kids meal I paid for with no fries and no sauce. And a mediocre hot dog. To this day I am praying I didn't receive the side that was retrieved from the guy dining and regret the time and money wasted. I will never return or recommend.

Before opening the Container Park location, they only had their street-cart on Fremont St. Ahhhh, my first time was a typically drunken night out bar-hopping with my girlfriends and they crazed about getting a Cheffini hot dog. They told me to have everything on it, and I had no clue what some of the ingredients the owner was topping it off with, but wow when I took my first bite into it, it was so darn good!!! The sauce they have on it is soo good and my favorite part are the crispy chips they put on top too! It's so unique and so yummy.

I wanted to actually taste the hot dog, not just guess what it tastes like under mounds of toppings.  

The hot dog was nigh perfect!  Good and tight on the outside, moist and tender inside and full of flavor.  The bun was not mushy and added well to the experience.   Reminds me of the great concession dogs you would get at a theatre or ball park before they invented the dreaded steam roller.  The dog was an A+.  Totally worth 5 bucks.

My complaint comes with the drink, at 3 dollars and small, it seems it added a lot to the total price without any real value.  Several places nearby have the same size for almost half the price.  Also something wrong with the lids they use, wouldn't stay on and leaked so much, I did away with it quick.

We ordered the special which is a PBR & dog. We got our beers and sat. After what seemed like a really long wait our dogs came out. The dogs were as amazing as I remember! The vegan dog is flavorful and chewy but not rubbery like faux meats are sometimes. The toppings were great as usual (that pineapple sauce and crumbled chips are soooo yummy!). 
As for service, that leaves much to be desired. As well as time for the food to come, although there was only one other person there. I appreciate that it's all fresh, but I think we waited about 15 mins..for hot dogs. Nonetheless, it's vegan hot dogs so I'll deal w it for my occasional hot dog desire!

Atmosphere: Warm, but a little too cozy
The lighting in this place adds a well needed warmth on a winter's day. Upon entering the establishment to your left is the cash register and to your left would be the immediate seating. The seats were comfortable enough to sit on. The seating is very tight, and if the entire indoor dining area was full, it would be very difficult to navigate. Good thing there is a dining area outside! 

Food: Not bad at all!
I've had a taste of the chili cheese dog, French fries with dipping sauce, and their sliders. All of these tasted wonderful, each with great flavor and served nice and hot. The only other thing I would like to say would be that the food here is pretty expensive. $8 for 3 tiny sliders? Although they tasted OK, it's not really a good value at all. Their menu does serve some pretty interesting sounding items, but the price of the food is the deal breaker in this case.

Service: It was... AIGHT.
The cashier was polite, but nothing stood out about the service that makes me want to say, ""IT was spectacular!"" so I will just say the service was mediocre. 

Overall: Not horrible, but nothing spectacular.
The food here tastes great, but it's overpriced. The service and atmosphere are ok, but are nothing special. I would only come back if I had the money to afford such expensive food. Cheffini's is not bad at all, but if you are looking for a bang for your buck, look somewhere else.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,0,0,3,sKXHGoUvX1aSsPQX9fKlMA

Well, the vegan hot dog at Cheffini's is the best I've ever had. Surprisingly containing no soy, it was so good it had me questioning if they gave me a meat one by mistake. The variety of types of dogs they offer will satisfy anyone and the choice of toppings and fixings will make for some tough choices. I opted for their summer special. A ""naked"" dog and a drink (soda or beer) for $5 ( plus $1 for a vegan dog). You get a choice of a sauce and a fixing on a naked dog. And, they have 4 beers on draft to choose from. If you decide to get fries, be careful. The small order is enough to feed 2 people. The sweet potato fries were especially good.

It is in the container park downtown, which is already a great spot to check out while in Vegas as it is downtown, has unique and artist shops, a massive playground with a tall slide, and other restaurants. 

The hot dogs are great with a variety of untraditional toppings and sauces that turn a hot dog into a gourmet and reasonably priced treat. I always make sure to get the potatoes chip topping and fry sauce for my fries. 

The sitting area is very limited, with most spots accommodating only two people. There is a vast outdoor seating area they share but most the tables don't have any cover from the sun. So, if the weather is really hot, cold, or raining it may not be the optimal choice. 

This is a order at the front, get a number, and have a seat restaurant. And you can be in and out quickly. Parking may be difficult to find, so you will likely be walking and paying, which is usually fine because the downtown area is interesting to be in.

The food stall is still up down the street, and if you have the option, go there because it is slightly better than he storefront. Both are good options though.",uso43PtZRUPcYxgxs12U1g,0,0,5,xR50Xh45kDoV2UhYlvRHgg

We all felt a little weird after, mostly I think because recently we've eliminated most processed food and haven't had regular hot dogs in a long while. 

For me, the Grandfather would have been perfect with something more pickled & less onions to cut through the richness of the pork belly and egg. The fella said the chili cheese was alright, but I think he would have enjoyed more as an all beef, since he was the first to point that out (hard to please a Vienna fan).

Also, many of them were rude when they didn't need to be. One of our party asked about Vegan options, and they made a joke about how there aren't any vegan hot dogs and that we should go somewhere else. This was before our party (minus one) decided to order our $90's worth of food. 

Later, one of us asked for a napkin, and she was rudely directed to take one that was already brought out and placed on a different table than the one she was sitting at. 

Also, one of our group was leaning on the lower table, next to the window facing outside. He was yelled at from way in the back of the store to stop sitting on the table. Then, a woman worker, spoke loudly saying, ""where do you come from thinking you can sit on an F******g table?""

What's good about Cheffini's?
-Located in Container Park.  
-It's quick
-Their hot dogs are pretty good. I prefer the Beef Naked Dog with absolutely nothing on it.  It's suppose too be naked, right?
-Their sliders.  IMO, the best item at Cheffini's
-The Beef Empanadas
-The employees are awesome

What's bad about Cheffini's?
-The price: $5 for a ""plain as can be"" hot dog.  I expect to pay upwards of $5 for a plain hot dog at a movie theater or a football game, but not at Container Park.  They're dogs with all the fun stuff will set you back around $10.

The place itself is really small as most of the businesses are inside the Container Park.  We went inside and were greeted instantly, paid for our food and given a number.  We grabbed a table outside and the worker brought out our food about 10 minutes later.  

We ordered:
-Classic Cheffini's Hot Dog ($5.99) - comes topped with the normal toppings onions, mustard, ketchup BUT they also throw on jalapenos, mozzarella cheese, potato chips, and pineapple sauce, not sure what the hell the person was thinking when this concoction was created but boy is it TASTY!
-Crunchy Dog Hot Dog ($6.99) - topped with onion, peppers, bacon, potato chips, seaweed, sriracha, and fry sauce didn't get to try this because my friend devoured his but he said it was good! 
-Side of Large Fries ($4) - Nice and crispy the fries were extra long too and they give you a lot with a side of fry sauce

For some reason I think compared to the hot dog stand, here gives you more food.

It might have been the alcohol, it might not have been I can't say for sure.  BUT I do crave it so maybe there was something there. 

When Ty told me there was one going up in the container park I told him it was a must!  Plus little man loves the playground there so he never days no. We went on a Saturday which is normally busy but we think the gloomy weather may have had something to do with it because the amount of people were manageable. 

As you walk by the giant praying mantis into the park, cheffinis is located past the coffee shop on the left side where the old pork and beans was. If you've ever been in it before you know how absurdly small it is. They replaced the long middle table for three tall tables on one side and a short table that stretches the length of the window.  The menu is available above the order counter. The selections varied slightly and came with preselected toppings. There was an option to get a naked dog and add two toppings of your choice plus sauces for the price of $4.99. For me that's normally what I would go for, but the El Mexicano stood out to me. That will run you $6.99 not including drink or side. 

El Mexicano - this was a bacon wrapped all beef dog (you have the option of beef, turkey or vegan)  with a cherry pepper relish, green sauce, garlic aioli,  Chipotle guava, onions, tomatoes, avocado and a cilantro garnish. 

Lots of flavor and lots of spice! The hot dog was super juicy and had that snappy crunch when you bit into it. And all the toppings kept my taste buds going!  Delicious!!  We didn't try any sides and thankfully because the one hot dog was plenty. I was stuffed to the rafters. I was a bit disappointed in the iced tea we had. It tasted sour like tea does when it's old :/.  But overall a great experience and I will come back when we are in the container park.",7S2wwOSVSRn4CEZdtQKG_Q,5,4,4,F6B24-6RTfmio9dXFurmnA

The glorious hot dog is one of the most perfect foods to follow a drunken pub crawl around downtown. It gives me a reason to set food once again in Container Park - a place that didn't interest me much before.

Keep in mind that you're getting gourmet hot dogs in here. A plain dog will cost you $4.99, with the fancier stuff going more toward $6-9. ~$8 is a little much to pay for one hot dog, but hey, I could tell they used some quality ingredients into my dog, so I'll let it slide. If you are more of the ""quantity over quality"" type, you may have to sit at a nearby casino cafe and order a gigantor hot dog that they usually serve for a couple bucks.

Price point aside, the hot dog I got was very good. I got the Crunchy Dog - a hot dog concoction with all sorts of crunchies all over it (bacon, potato chips, fried onions, etc.). It's also topped with nori (seaweed) and sriracha mayo to give a bit of an Asian twist. I wasn't necessarily blown away by it, but it was still good.

Would I come back? Probably. The price point is something that I'm starting to see from all renovations going around east downtown. There are times that I crave a hot dog and go out of my way for it.

The El Mexicano also featured some unique sauces including cherry pepper relish and fresh avocado slices. Both dogs had buns that held all of the yummy toppings and sauces.

I get here and notice they serve cheese fries. I also notice the excess amount of toppings for ""el Mexicano"" bacon wrapped hot dog. I decide to order the two. I was somewhat curious what their combination would taste like so I didn't make any changes. 

The initial bite was interesting.. very sweet. And saucy. My MAIN complaint about the hot dog was that it was FRIED!.... you don't fry a bacon wrapped hot dog. It's lazy and would probably cause a heart attack. Bacon wrapped hot dogs should be grilled to keep the texture. 

The cheese fries were horrible.. I'm sorry. I never complain about things but this was overpriced garbage. The cheese fries had its own style of saucy cheese. I could taste the corn startch/flour in it. It was gritty and flavorless. The texture was so off. The fries were too thick. 

It was $8.00 for a normal sized hot dog and $8.00 for cheese fries. Nearly $30 after tax. For two dogs and cheese fries. I would have been happier going to a real restaurant for that amount.

A few years ago, I was boycotting this place. The customer service was crappy. I still remember this once particular girl who was totally miserable, all of the time. Their prices were ridiculous for what you got. HOWEVER... I found myself here when the taco shop next door dropped the ball and my starving child was, well, starving. And he loves hot dogs and fries.

Erica was, and is, awesome. I let her know that my son couldn't eat the bun because of his food allergies. Both she and Oscar, the cook, made sure that T's food was good to go. A nice sized, perfectly cooked, juicy hot dog and a side of fries with ketchup was happily delivered to our outside table. 

Erica has since remembered us, as we have stopped in a few times after. She and Oscar really made the difference in my chance of heart towards this place.

Another reason I am giving a lower review is the staff, the girl at the counter today carried an attitude and was very unapproachable and unhelpful when it was clear I had not been before and didn't know the menu. All in all if you are in Container Park I would try something else. This place was overpriced and definitely under delivered!",wZMoQgj89pwH4VEkMtaalw,3,0,3,4y5mbIa3jzG_8rLuztczww

I had the Cheffini itself, but now I have to go back and try something else.. So many options!

5278350,2015-07-24,3,065c76tt1dXBNmoGBymUgQ,"Just to clarify: the 707 address is for the location inside Container Park. The 520 address is for the hotdog cart. Whew. Now that we got that situated, onward! I came to Cheffini's on possibly the worst time conceivable- on National Hot Dog Day when they were offering dollar beers from 6PM to 7PM. I arrived at 7PM, waited in line for 30 minutes, and then waited another 30 minutes for my food to arrive. The line started outside and snaked inside this tiny container. I can't fault them for their wait times or the customer service, so my review is strictly for the food. 

The deal was $5 for a Classic Cheffini with a beer. I had been wanting to try out Cheffini's for awhile but was aware of their steep prices. National Hot Dog day presented itself as the most affordable way to enjoy Cheffini's, so off I went. Plus, the local Reddit group had organized an event to take advantage of the happy hour special. 

VEGAN CHEFFINI (Normally $6.99): I got mine sans onions and mustard and skeptically opted to keep the pineapple sauce (included). Surprisingly, the pineapple sauce was one of the best parts of this dog. Ketchup, mayo, potato chips, mozzarella cheese, and jalapenos were also loaded on this vegan hotdog. The jalapenos packed an extra punch. Tasty. 4/5

SMALL FRIES ($2): Standard issue fries, but this 'small' fry was huge! Barely put a dent in it. 4/5 

Worth a Return Visit?
I really appreciate the fact that a vegan hotdog is on the menu. For $6.99 just for a hotdog though, I'm not sure how quickly I'll come back. Tasty but expensive!

The hot dog itself was nothing all that special and the bun didn't stand up too well to all those toppings but the combo of all those different flavors and textures (mango, spicy mayo, pork belly, potato chips, etc) was well worth it. 
The prices are steep $8.99 for our dog but it's to be expected in a touristy and trendy section of Downtown LV.

We were greeted by a really friendly lady who started singing with the birthday boy, cause he asked what he got for his birthday.  She took our order quickly and was super friendly.  We ordered the Mexican, the Cheffinis, and the Godfather.  I only got to try the cheffinis and the Godfather, but they were both Sooooo good.  The godfather had a perfectly cooked quail egg with pork belly. The cheffinis is their classic dog, but it was anything but boring.  It had like 8 toppings!! Their beer selection is pretty good too. Any place that serves lagunitas IPA is legit in my book.  We sat outside and just enjoyed the music and the dogs.  The time went by super fast and we had such a good time.  It was the perfect pre Bar hoping dinner.  We will definitely be back and couldn't stop talking about these dogs on our way back home. Yummmm",mNpS2DYdOoq_XhZVEB1DjQ,1,1,5,osMpY1C--G25RnUZ8Rm6Yw
