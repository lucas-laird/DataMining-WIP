The 2 women working behind the counter/kitchen couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming and suggestive when it came to me being indecisive about what I wanted to order. Food is flavorful,juicy,and just plain ole fashioned home cooked yumminess. I just wish this place had more visible signage alone the roadside.",WcPHLLB2MocnXNJwYvTUnQ,6,2,5,QVNp7CfI5Ukl_EofjPuYig
