A bed of fries, provolone, thin slices of marinated steak and some kind of amazing gravy that brings it all together. Big enough to share.

Place never closes, lots of TV's and a really good beer selection. One of the few places in town that has Delirium Tremens on tap. 

Sit at the bar and you should gamble otherwise grab a table or relax by the fire in their lounge chairs.",MnDpS5jNtwi_HTSY2fMbPg,1,1,4,s3l988ACdWrWW6cXfSQoww

We came in on a Friday night around 6pm for a late night snack and it was empty...no one greeted us so we awkwardly sat in a booth by the bar. After about 5 minutes someone greeted us and took our drink order. We ordered the pickle chips and seared ahi. IT WAS TERRIBLE! I was amazed they could screw up fried pickles! But they tasted frozen and soggy! My boyfriend ordered the seared ahi which was for sure frozen, and it was so tiny! Literally 2 bites and gone...so he sends and we pay our check and get out as fast as we could. I mean I live so close that I'm sure we'll try it out one more time, but if they strike out again we won't be back and the only reason we will be back is because our waiter scored some points when we asked to send the food back.",vKzS-ZxQprfPxTxY45ZBRw,0,0,2,rQi0G6_B30w1WZBo8gyPew

It's quite dark inside but I can deal with that, music is never incredibly loud either which is good. Overall I'd say if you're looking for a nice chill night at the bar, this is your place.

504011,2015-02-24,1,1CWMNSTRMejdSyXBG2chNg,"This was our second time there.  We vowed the first time to never come back, but came back only because one of friends likes this place.  (He needs to be shown around town a little and see you can only do better). Our second time here we experienced the exact same things as our first time.  My wife gambled on a poker machine and I gambled on another.  Together we blew at least $200 through the two machines.  The first $15 we tipped we were pretty much given the stink eye until the bartender(s) warmed up to giving us drinks.  My wife never got a clean glass they just re-used her old glass.  After dropping $200 we asked for the bill.  The bartender said she comped what she could.  My wife had not a single drink comped. I can drink pretty heavily, but a 12 pack costs $18 (for the expensive stuff) retail.  So after $200 they couldn't comp the beer I had.  I asked the bartender why this was.  How do they compete with anyone else in the Las Vegas valley?  I was told that you pay a premium for beer here because in the fridge they have some beers that are worth a couple hundred dollars.  So, because you get to look at expensive beers in the fridge you pay a $20 premium on your Coors light.  Another reason was because they can't compete with any of the big casinos.  Which makes me think if you have a customer who drops a few hundred dollars you can't make a profit off handing him or her a few beers?  Also, someone told me the Fireside is owned by the same people who own the Elixir on green valley and sunset, which we used to go to all the time when we lived on that side of town.  Always had the drinks comped when you played continuesly.  The waiting staff is super friendly (at Elixir).  So not sure why Fireside is different.  The food is descent.   The only reason I went there a second time is because my friend feels it's his local bar, but if you're going to drop a few hundred plus, the entire valley is your neighborhood bar with only a cheap cab ride away.  Everywhere in Las Vegas .... Literally everywhere with the exception of many places on the strip they will treat you right when you drop a few bills.  This place ...

Kate, your sumptuous smile brings me much joy. If I were Methamphetamine, you would be my Walter White.

The food is pretty good, (cheesy barrels are fantastic) the craft beer selection is Awesome, the staff is friendly... Why would I only give 3 stars?...

Well, the inherit problem that I've seen falls on management.  
-  Every time I come in and ask for a list of beers I get the same answer from the staff, ""It changes every week, so I don't know what we have.. you can walk around and look at the tap handles...""    WHAT?  You go through this trouble to bring in great beers like Ballast Point and New Belgium, and you can't even spend the 5 minutes to type up and print out what is on tap for the week?  Why can other bars accomplish this task? Every staff member should be given this list, asked to remember it, and I will give you 5 stars immediately.

-   Another reason that most likely contributes to not knowing what is behind the bar, is that, one can not actually see the bar..  It is so dark in this place (granted that's not always a bad thing) but you need to put lights over your bar showcasing all of the liquor bottles you have so you can sell the stuff!  I can't even see the bartender as they disappear into ""the Abyss"" of darkness.

I will come back to this place again because the staff does do a pretty good job.  Just please get the beer menu out, and hang some lights over the bartenders and bring the food prices down a notch.

This has become our new Sunday destination for football after a long allegiance to Rocky's (old Timbers, still a great place) up the street.

You won't miss an NFL game here and really, isn't that what Sunday is all about? 2 massive projection screens, numerous big flat screens and the red zone channel always found somewhere in between, your eyeballs won't miss one reception, kick or penalty. 

The staff is awesome, particularly the bartender Chris, who is attentive and dishes just the right amount of abuse, always welcomed in a sports bar. I've only seen the tip of the iceburg as far as food is concerned but so far so good. The football specials are a page long and I had the Buffalo Chicken Sliders.

After a few minutes bartender came and got out drink order stating she didn't know where server went. We asked about happy hour pricing ( we went there based on the websites 4-6pm offers) to our surprise we were told no happy hour existed. Interesting. So once the server did come around we said we would need a minute and kept the menus. 

No. One. Came. Back. After our 1 drink we got up and we were then asked if we needed anything else like more drinks... we said no we are leaving and the server said okay she ll close you out.

The brine from the artichokes made it so vinegary that I couldn't eat over half of it. The burger was served medium well and something was moldy about half way thru-bread? Cheese? Meat? Also inedible. Server was nice and efficient however clearly had no authority to make things right. It's not cheap either-$53 for two entrees, two beers and one house cocktail.",rX3qhIJGC1LhV3Hp9_tGvw,0,0,3,HU1BQ6ayONSMYZ5WX7BShQ

It was her second day on the job, but she was knew every single item on the menu. She was recommended drinks and food items based on our preferences. And we were not disappointed; the food here is excellent.  Sandwiches, burgers and desserts are very flavorful and the presentation is pretty good.

I ended up getting their french dip sandwich, with roast beef. The au jus sauce was amazing. I ordered the sandwich with chedder munchers. They were so good that my friends ended up eating alot of my chedder munchers. They enjoyed their food as well.  Its always a good sign when people are sharing food, because they think that its the best they've had in a while.

As we walked in, we were immediately greeted by Justin, the bartender.  Justin was awesome! He is part of the reason I would definitely go back! Not only was he very attentive and always there when we needed anything, but he was very patient with us (couldn't decide what to eat - we were just that out of it). 
I liked the atmosphere of the place as well - the perfect evening/late-night joint to just chill at the bar, have a few beers and some good conversation, or enjoy some above par bar fare.  
I told Justin the type of beer I like the most (Hefeweizen), and he brought me back something delicious! I don't remember the name, but it hit the spot perfectly!

I had the house salad which was a good portion. Lots of greens and romaine. A few onions cucumbers and croutons with balsamic. Enough it could be shared by two.
I ordered the steak and fries which was very good and bad. Hot fries, cheese and gravey with sliced steak cooked to order. Good but more of the bad stuff than I usually eat.

We found everything we were looking for at Fireside Tavern.  We left my buddies local watering hole because of mediocre beer choices and average food offering's of burgers and sandwiches and just short car ride away to end up here.

A little dark when you first walk in because of the scorching Nevada sun, I nearly walked into the wall upon entering.  After taking a moment to adjust the eyes to the cave like feel with rich mahogany wood blanketing the bar and seating areas. We were greeted by an attractive friendly bar tender who then chased us away from the bar because we were not gaming. Fine with me I would rather sitting in one of the large wrap around booths surrounding the bar with a better view of the game and no smoke from the continuous chain of tabacco being ignited. 

After checking out the menu my friend and I decided to go with what we came for which was a large cheese and pepperoni pizza.  The rest of the menu look great as well serving some hearty dishes with choices of steak and seafood.  The pizza came out quickly and was bubbling hot.  Our server had prepared us prior to its arrival with plates and jars of crushed red pepper and parm to top this magnificent pizza with.  Everything about this pie was what I was looking for in this meal.  I give the pizza a high rating of 4.5 out of 5 for sure.  I think I also found my friend a new watering hole near his home.  

Another great thing about Fireside is the above average beer choices.  I love great flavorful beer, not foaming rice water like AB, Mill, or Coors.  I also prefer to buy local if that choice is available.  Fireside carries Joseph James which is brewed in Henderson, NV.  If I need to help tap a few kegs to support my neighbor, I am all for it.  Keep the money flowing in our communities if possible.  Why support August Busch IV I think they are doing just fine.  At Fireside they have over 20 beers on tap many that of great quality and different brew syles like IPA, Chocolate Stout, Red, Lager, Wheat, and Pils. 

If you are in Henderson I recommend stopping by Fireside Tavern for some great pizza, beer and service.  I know I will be back even though it is 30 miles from home.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,3,3,4,pzJWSDD5uI3LlBHjHfJLoA

My parents were about to hit the road to move to Denver for good, and we needed a place down the street from their house to grab a bite and a pint after we said a tearful goodbye to my childhood home. Nothing fussy, no wait, something comfortable with good food. A place where everyone knows your name! 

We were literally the only ones in the dimly lit dining room, so we settled into a booth away from the smoky bar, and quizzed the unsuspecting waitress on their beer selection. Their menu was outdated with beer options, the chalkboard outside advertising Delirium was incorrect, and their TV list was wrong too. Poor gal had to recite everything until we finally settled on a New Belgium Snapshot, a 24 oz. hef my mom ""accidentally"" ordered, and a Stella for my dad. Their menu is pretty consistent, although the famed wedge salad I ordered on Valentine's Day 2005 has evolved a bit. We started with some piping hot spinach artichoke dip which really hit the spot. My parents thought it was too salty but I've never had such a thought in my life. 

I had the American Burger - cheese, fried pickles, thousand island dressing, lettuce, tomato- with a side of curly fries. Huge portion, I wanna say $13.99.

The beer menu is also not updated day by day so it does not show the most current selection which can be deceiving.  The one thing I absolutely love, however about Fireside is that they show prices of their draft and bottle selection which is actually surprisingly rare in Las Vegas.

Overall I want to come back and give Fireside an updated better revieew.  The service just did not earn a 4 star review.  The beers were solid for the area and the bar itself wasn't as divey inside as I thought it would be upon parking.  I will be back for a good beer in Henderson.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,5ESQ6Xiv3ccrlnRr8Cz7oA

But FUCK, only when I travel to Nevada do I get reminded how cigarette smoke in a bar/restaurant is just fucking ridiculously annoying and disgusting.  

Walking in to this place, it's like walking into a cave...a really dark cave filled with the stench of thousands of smoked/currently being smoked cigarettes.  They probably keep the lighting dim to hide the catchers mitt  faces of the smokers who congregate around the bar.  Too bad that this is my biggest memory of this place, because they serve a mean burger with great tasting meat, toppings, and soft homemade bun.  They also have a really great beer selection, with many crafts to choose from on both tap and in a bottle.  And the service is great, with friendly bartenders who aren't bad on the eyes (at least from what I could see in the darkness).

Overall, if you have to be in Henderson NV like I was for work, then this isn't a bad spot that you can walk to from the Hampton Inn across the street and a block down or so.  And in all fairness, all of the little bar/restaurants like this in the area are full of the smokers looking for an acceptable place to go so they can smokes while they eats, which is what they likes to do.

Would be four stars plus if not for the stench.",GPXiBVCx63hpYJImfQxcWQ,0,0,3,SNet6xwNzlaffM6Oe4cEpQ

We walked through the doors and everything was pitch black. Like vampire cave dark. Like you need to use your iPhone flashlight because you're afraid for your life dark.  Then our eyes finally adjusted and a woman behind the bar told us we could seat ourselves.

We walked over to I almost want to say a separated eating area away from the bar. We were greeted quickly by Carolina. She took our drink orders and left us to decide what culinary delight we would be partaking in.

Atmosphere: 3/5 (after our eyes finally adjusted, the place didn't look half bad!)

Service: 3/5- Carolina was very sweet and friendly but because we were the only two people eating at the time she didn't have to walk around and check on her guests so there were multiple times that our drinks sat empty for upwards of ten minutes.

Fried Pickles: 4/5- I definitely would recommend maybe sitting at the bar enjoying some drinks with these juicy gifts from heaven. Very tasty and not too over cooked. We had them with ranch but I feel like if they had like a ranch hybrid with a little kick it would really knock these out of the park!

Cheesy Tater Tots: 5/5- My fianc√© got these with his burger instead of fries and being the terrible person with no self control at all. I ate them. I ate every last one of them. And I would gladly do it again and again. These were my favorite part of our whole meal, actually our whole experience.

Fire Burger & BYO Burger: 2/5- Very, very bland unsubstantial burgers for what we were paying. If I'm paying upwards of $15.00 for a burger it better at least be seasoned. Edible but not satisfying is how I would have to describe them. It's really a shame the flavor wasn't there too because the burger itself was cooked beautifully. Very juicy. Just very tasteless.

There is plenty of lighting in the room, but they will fight you over turning it on. For no reasons that I can fathom, the switches are under the bar rather than in the room itself. From the way the bartender acted, the switches might as well have been in Siberia. I was just bitchy enough to get him to turn them on the first time, but if I wasn't there, he would flat-out refuse to to turn them on for the rest of the group. He said the first time that he didn't know where they were until I told him I would look for them myself - and then he magically found them. He tried that with the group when I wasn't there, but someone was in text contact with me and I told her that was Blarney. Next, he tried to tell her that they were too hard to turn on and didn't work. It's a light switch, people, not an algebra problem. And they worked the previous week.

If you have a group, no matter how small, they cannot be bothered to allow separate orders. Of course you don't get told this until they bring out one check and you're all sitting there looking stupidly at each other trying to figure out what to do with it.

The server was rude and condescending. His tips were given begrudgingly, and we are typically a big tipping group. 

Needless to say, we found another venue right away. Given how otherwise dead they were for the entire 3 months we met there, they proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that they would rather act childishly then actually have paying customers. Good luck with that business model.

It was odd that my friend lost his credit card in the leather recliner and we had to turn it upside down before finding it.  I was lucky that I didn't know anyone in the joint actually this place would be a good hideout as well.",cAY_gYiIq68RkWhLennaKw,1,0,4,A-yxbBADWV0Q_gTp15Mn_g

but the best?  THE FOOD.  Chicken wraps, fries, salads, everything!  My absolute favorite is the SLIDERS!  OMG!  Filet sliders are DELICIOUS!  Please try them.  Sliders will never be the same...",5VWm-9vXtt3GoHN3Nr-Ixg,0,0,5,7ghZ68ExX15w6oCnXb3_Eg
5714950,2018-03-03,0,1CWMNSTRMejdSyXBG2chNg,"Well.. Fireside has run it's course. Although it will forever hold a special place in my heart the time has come to seek food and drinks elsewhere. The food has gone downhill majorly, something is always broken in the kitchen making the menu limited, but the final kicker is the horrible music. ALWAYS. During every major sporting event. NBA playoffs, Olympics, NFL games. If you ask to have game audio turned on in lieu of music the bartenders and servers have absolutely no problem telling you- and this is an actual quote from multiple employees- ""no, we don't want our gamers looking up."" -insert shocked and disgusted face here-

Last night the kitchen was shut down because of some issue and the bar was PACKED more than I have ever seen it in years. The majority of the patrons (all loyalty wearing their Las Vegas Golden Knights gear) were not there to gamble. They were all watching the hockey game, but we never got any game audio because Culture Club, George Michael, and Duran Duran were BLASTING over the speakers. My husband and I used my phone for game audio while we literally sat in our booth near the door and counted multiple groups walk in the door, point at the TVs, scoff at the music, AND LEAVE. 

I cannot imagine that a couple old bitties playing Keno gamble soooo much that they are bringing more income to the bar then all the proud and rowdy hockey fans that drink like fish and buy rounds of shots for all their buddies constantly.

My review actually decreased in stars by the end of my typing. Sad.",UEeZ-eE63citRQIeqsQq1g,1,0,2,dUogyaXLRyH28o1tbMwC8A

Now that we live further away, the location is still quite convenient, and it's nice that it's all by itself (although not for long since they're putting a gas station in next door).  The dinner/lunch fare can be a tad overpriced, but it usually pretty good.  The breakfast food is more reasonably priced and you can find some good deals for good breakfast food.

Overall, I would call this place a small step up from PT's in atmosphere and food.",wVw3gv1fNdI2_iJIO28L0A,0,0,3,1NA8A-KU6rRwz8pB1G1RRw
5734261,2013-12-22,0,1CWMNSTRMejdSyXBG2chNg,Great craft beer selection! Very friendly bar staff. I'm actually annoyed this place was so close to where I live and yet I never thought to grab a beer there. I just figured it was just another Lodge/PTs/strip mall type bar...man was I wrong. Food wise - I only tried the Fire Burger which was very good but actually lived up to its name and put me on my ass a little bit. Cannot recommend this place enough - go there,fuYNXP_K_GTeKYCPxO5kHA,0,0,5,_FpzEFjTSDC02UGIc2gNiQ

They have a nice size bar area and cozy seating. 
My only complaint is the smoking, but i guess it's to be expected at a bar",sPK5l28FDl9H9nL8pIJZRA,0,0,5,eBTVHYui9As8hnt86kwQMQ
