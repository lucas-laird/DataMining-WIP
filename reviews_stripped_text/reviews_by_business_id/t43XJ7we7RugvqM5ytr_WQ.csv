But once inside one is instantly greeted with wondrous aromas that trigger salivary glands before the brain has time to identify the source. Friendly and personable chefs and waitresses are quick to welcome and seem happy to serve. The decor and atmosphere are traditional and relaxing with soft contemporary and Little Italy music in the background. 
Pie Zanos offers take-out and dine-in services but unlike similar chains, there is no skimping on the full restaurant experience. Tables are fully equipped with tablecloths, a complete set of silverware, and a generous variety of spices and oils. Everything is neat and tidy and one is not left searching for the neatest bottle of Purell. 
There is a scrumptious selection of appetizers, entrees and desserts to choose from, all of which are very reasonably priced. So far I have zeroed in on the wide variety of savory pizzas. The sauce, abundance of perfectly textured cheese, and cartload of toppings stuffed between two pizza pies makes for an EPIC  experience. If you ever wondered what it feels like when taste buds have an orgasm, visit Pie Zanos. You will not be disappointed.",BEPbdeyqduD_r23o91OMjw,5,6,5,Iga2QSlqyY2h7Juyou96Uw

I'm from New York so I'm very hard to please when it comes to places that advertize that their from there.  I had a conversation with the waitress and she also was from New York she assured me that I'd be happy.  I ordered the small pizza to go and when I got home and had a slice I was blown away with how good it was.  So much so that I called back and happened to get the same waitress and told her how happy I was.  I've since been back and ordered the chicken parm and that was also very, very good.  I'm now a fan and hooked.  Bravo!",080OOKpjMtKCFhUf42Bmdg,1,1,5,IU1Dtp1rc3VmAdwRJbfKrw

I want to like them. I really do. But, they are so inconsistent. 

Like other reviewers, we live in the neighborhood, so we've tried every version of this location. Originally, PieZanos was good. They had great favors and I love the thin crust. They have a great variety, and maybe that's the problem. Maybe they could do fewer things better. 

My husband loves pizza and we aren't fans of chains, so we go here. Sometimes, it is mind blowing. This week, we threw almost an entire pizza in the trash. We ordered a meat lovers type pizza and a chicken pizza. The meat lovers was fine. Lots of meats, good flavor... But really oily. The chicken pizza was disgusting. We have ordered and enjoyed it in the past, so it isn't a matter of taste. The chicken was dry and overcooked, there wasn't much cheese... I was disappointed more than anything. 

Hopefully, it was an off night. There aren't any good pizza places nearby.",utS9ZAswZZx3QkegS_25SA,0,0,2,klGCEADvTCY7atGx-7mHKw
2983598,2013-06-07,4,t43XJ7we7RugvqM5ytr_WQ,"Small, hole-in-the-wall-ish, family pizza / pasta restaurant.  It's easy to find at Flamingo and Sandhill next to the grocery store.  

Super friendly folks who hail from New York where they have 3 restaurants.  

Casual atmosphere with great scents of tomato sauce, garlic, dough and cheeses. Their cheeses are special ordered because the owner is super fanatic about his cheese and that it must be a very specific type and quality.  

This is not a FAST food restaurant.  So, don't go in expecting a fast meal and a fast pizza thrown together.  Their food is made to order and is made with lots of love.

However.... With that said... you can order a slice of pizza and sit at the counter top if you like.  But this is a family place so expect to chat up whoever is working and to take your time.  Hang out a bit.

Go Hungry!  Their portions are quite large and shareable or you'll have leftovers which are just as good the next day.

Their menu is varied, and has lots of great options from specialty NY pizzas to deep dish to pastas to strombolis to calzones to sandwiches and salads.

Oh!  And their garlic bread.... It is ""Melt In Your Mouth Good"".  If it weren't for all the pizza and pasta I was already scarfing down... I would have had more than 1 piece of this.  I think next time I go back... I'll order just a salad so I won't feel so guilty when I eat a whole basket of their Garlic Bread.

NOTE:  If you like White Pizza... you MUST try their Bianca pizza.  It is heavenly.

A couple of notable items that you might not try if you saw them... but should:
* Zucchini Pancakes appetizer... light and strangely comforting.  So Good!
* Zeppoles... like a cross between funnel cake and beignets and pastries... small puffy/airy donut like rectangles with a drizzle of chocolate and a dusting of powdered sugar.  These aren't super sweet but they satisfy the ""sweet tooth"" should you have one.

Their prices are super reasonable so bring the family and indulge!",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,5,4,4,_x94MeuGEH7F_STwdtTmyg

We live a couple of blocks away, and we're regulars for a medium cheese pizza and an order of regular garlic knots -- less than $10 for two for dinner and a lunch (leftovers) - cheap and good.  The people are really nice and certainly appreciate the biz.  We are 'fast food freaks' and grateful to find something fast and good close to us.

3597912,2013-11-27,0,t43XJ7we7RugvqM5ytr_WQ,Stopped in for a slice after shopping at Smiths and was not impressed. I believe it read New York style but it must be a New York somewhere else in the country. A slice so small that you can't even fold and only takes a couple bites to finish. The taste was nothing spectacular but I will say the crust was good. There was not a single person in here and now I see why.,L8cvMZLWmM4qWTl9SkxJ8g,0,0,2,qW9C-Il-spOcOWZZsniY4A

The Girlfriend and I have been ordering pizzas for pick up here since we first tried this place in November. The pizzas quality has never failed to satisfy. Tonight we were going to go shopping at Smith's and decided on a last minute pizza meal. Unfortunately the service was no where near as good at it had been on our first lunch time visit. The restaurant was nearly full and we were informed there would be a 20-30 minute wait for the food. This was no problem as we were not in a rush. We choose a booth and sat down. There were 3 waitresses on staff and the tall fellow who I presume is the head chef/owner/ or GM was also present. We had two of the waitresses ask us if our order had been taken before we got our menus.  The third waitress took our menus but told us she would be back for our order. Then the head guy asked us if anyone had taken our order (at this point we had no menus anymore and had been asked if anyone had taken our order 3 times without anyone actually doing it) and we informed him no one had. Finally the waitress came back and took our order. No garlic bread this visit. The pizza itself, a Grilled chick and Sundried Tomato was delicious and worth every nuisance of spotty service. Half way through the meal my girl and I had emptied our water glasses. By this point all of the large groups had cleared out and the restaurant was not busy at all. Two of the waitresses were in the back room and one was behind the counter. We had our empty water glasses set on the edge of the table without notice for a solid 5 minutes. Finally, the two waitresses in the back room come out and head towards the front. To my and my girlfriends dismay, they exit the restaurant and go into one of their cars for a private chat or a break. Eventually the head honcho asked us if everything was ok regarding the wait time, which of course it was worth the wait for the pizza. He was able to prestidigitate more water into our glasses by taking the empty cups and having one of the waitresses who was still in the restaurant refill them. We asked for the check when the refilled water glasses were brought to us. By this time the other two waitresses had returned from their break. When another waitress had brought us the check i had emptied my water glasses again, but the waitress paid no notice when she dropped the check off. 

I recommend this place for its pizza, 100%. The food is amazing and you do yourself a disservice by not trying it. However as with any restaurant when you go and where you sit may play a deciding factor in how much attention you get if there are more than 3 or 4 groups present. I recommend sitting near the back where register/kitchen entrance is located. This place is a great choice for pick up anytime!",CYccznHIW4f7dvy9jY1wPQ,3,0,4,_9g2JjA4l8qiBmnHftkhCQ
5426708,2012-11-04,2,t43XJ7we7RugvqM5ytr_WQ,"Pie Zanos is the latest pizzeria to open in this location, formerly known to many as The Saucy Tomato, which turned out to be the little engine that just couldn't.

My boyfriend and I decided to give them a shot today since we had been fond of Saucy Tomato and like to support local businesses. The decor has not changed at all from Saucy Tomato, which is neither bad or good, pretty standard small restaurant look. Upon walking in, a young girl simply said ""Hi"" to us, and we were left wondering whether to seat ourselves or wait. We ended up seating ourselves at a table that happened to have menus at it (none of the others did). When she realized we had menus, the girl/ waitress proceeded to leave us alone for at least 5 minutes before coming back to take our drink order (we were ready to order by then too), and took another 5 minutes to bring us our drinks and actually take our order, which was a chicken/ spinach/ Alfredo pizza with an order of ricotta balls to start.

This is the point where things go from ""iffy"" to ""terrible"". We noticed there was another waitress on staff and a man whose only job seemed to be working the pizza station. It was over 10 minutes before we received the ricotta balls, which were very yummy, and another 10 minutes after eating them that the other waitress asked if we were done or wanted to order anything else. We explained we had a pizza on the way, and she got right to work clearing our plates and bringing us a refill for our long ago finished sodas. 

After at least 10 more minutes of waiting for a single pizza, the original waitress brought us complimentary garlic knots. OK, we figured they were aware of the severe lack of service and speed and were making amends. Great! We bite into half cold garlic knots. Not so great.

Finally, the pizza arrives, and it is by far the largest pizza I have ever seen! It was almost exciting and quite a novelty, but intimidating as it was just the two of us looking at what was clearly going to be lunch and dinner for tomorrow. As I attempted to serve up the pizza, I quickly realized that their take on an Alfredo pizza is to use very think Alfredo sauce, rendering the pizza soggy and oily. Also, though there were shreds of basil on the pizza, we could find no evidence of the spinach portion. We just had a white, cheesy, oily pizza with chicken.  This was a fork pizza, to say the least.

The pizza itself was OK, but I personally found the chicken to be lacking in quality. It had the flavor and texture of being the kind of chicken you find on frozen pizzas in the store. I was expecting shredded or diced chicken breast, but am unsure what cut of meat I was given. The crust of the pizza was delicious, however. Very good flavor, chewy but not doughy, and had a nice crisp to the edge.

During this time we watched the staff take an exorbitant amount of time filling a to-go order and messing it up for another patron, and then almost ignoring another patron as well. The staff did try, and the waitress we ended up with was very nice. But 45 minutes of lackluster service for one mediocre pizza is hardly a compelling reason for us to ever go back again. If the owner is reading this, and I hope dearly that they are, here are some tips: Have menus and silverware set on all tables if you are going for the casual feel; trim down your menu and have things prepped in back so customers aren't waiting while your cooks frantically prepare something random; Train the young waitress (her car had a NY plate) on simple service standards; try everything on your menu, because I have a feeling you have not had that soupy pizza.

We really want to like you, please let us!",w6RLJEFWup2iWQpgvun--g,0,0,1,IElhC02mq1XiOcwhgjUWQA
5525500,2013-03-07,1,t43XJ7we7RugvqM5ytr_WQ,"I read the reviews before I went in, figuring two decent yelp reviews meant I should check it out.  Close to home, and I'm regularly in the same shopping center.  Maybe I went in at a bad time, but...I was by myself, the staff did not greet me at all.  I stood there in the doorway waiting for someone to either seat me or find a sign that said I should seat myself, which there wasn't.  Finally I stepped around the bar area and asked if there was a menu.  The girl said, ""are you picking up?"" and I repeated my question for a menu, and added ""shall I just find a spot to sit?"" and she said yes.  I tried to find a table that was clean and had utensils, but wasn't successful.  There was only one occupied table, and all the rest of them were dirty from previous patrons or had partial or no utensils.  Normally this doesn't bother me, but there was 3 girls behind the register area ""chatting"" and one cook who seemed very busy also.  I asked if someone could possibly clean off a table, and one of the girls looked at me and pointed to one and asked, ""what's wrong with that one?""...needless to say, I pointed out the table needed to be wiped down, the seat had pizza sauce on it and what looked like possibly salad dressing too.  I asked if I could be seated at a table, since I prefer not to sit in a booth, and she said ""well why didn't you just say that in the first place?""...at that point, I chose to leave.  Normally I would have let all that slide IF I'd known the food would be worth it...perhaps she was having a bad day, or maybe I was?  Either way, I won't be going back there and will choose to go up the street to Maestro's instead...",R_O9tbY8RgPybQ032xY1bw,0,0,1,D7HHxGZHO_giM3ynXiCgJQ
