The menu selection will have us coming back again to try more items. I had the french dip and it melted in your mouth with plenty of flavor. My wife had a hot pastrami that I thought was great, she thought was a little salty but not bad.

The girl behind the counter asked if there's  anything I want to try, she'll  let me have a taste. I should've  taken her up on it cuz the pineapple/coconut slaw sounded and looked amazing, same with the chicken salad
I ordered the pastrami sandwich with sidewinder fries which  was so tasty! Plump, crispy fries, sandwich was served on mixed rye bread with coleslaw in the sandwich. That trio gave the sandwich an amazing dimension of flavor!
My son had the 3 cheese grilled cheese sandwich  on Texas  toast, which was good.
My husband had the baby back ribs with Mac n cheese. He ordered sauce on the side but it still came on top and the ribs tasted old, meat pulled away from the bone and the bone was dried out. We lived in TX for 14 years and bbq is one of our faves, so we know when some things up. 
PLUS it took 20 minutes for our food to come out, not sure why but it did.
There are still a few  sandwiches we would like to try, so yeah we'll  be back",bvIdwnx7T3GNIyo91ne-aw,0,0,4,a_I9TES8KknsJX3sq79Z8w

I only wish the French dip came on a hoagie to actually dip it in the auju cup, like the posted picture shows it does. Mine came on an onion bun so I had to cut it in quarters to make it fit into the cup size they give you. 
The macaroni and cheese had great flavor, the kids were confused because it was white cheese then they tasted it and thought it was very good. 
Their fries are so delicious they are a must try with whatever you order.

Maybe my standards of a Rueben or a sandwich with salty meat like corned beef or pastrami is a bit high but a girl has to have her standards! The sandwich itself was aesthetically pleasing but once I took that first bite it was like myself and my sandwich went to hell in a handbasket. I don't think I am exaggerating because my dreams of a ligit deli style sandwich just disappeared like my dreams of being a Prima Ballerina. 

The only way I can describe my Rueben was it was off, just off. Everything in it was a Rueben but it had to boil down to the corned beef. It was not as tender as I was hoping and was a bit dry in some spots. Maybe I am a bit spoiled with delis in New York, where competition of having great corned beef is crucial. Maybe in Vegas we do not have that same competition. Who knows. I only know that I am still on the look out for my Rueben.",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,4,4,2,2KgkmD61WSQRPFgiPAUbVg
1352530,2017-04-25,0,73oP6zoYZKNlO8642EMD_Q,"Came here for dinner with some friends on Friday. Friend called to see what time they were open till and it was within like 5 minutes from a friends house. 

I've been meaning to take a visit to this place and their ""The Butcher Block"" store for ages so took this opportunity to visit both sides. The butcher shop moved down Rainbow to a new complex just before Windmill. Lots of stuff to offer. I figured, if they own a butcher place, their meats must be better quality in their deli/restaurant side XD But more on that side in their own review

Their on screen menu is not as extensive as their menu printed in front of the cashier. Their menu consists of small plates, smokehouse sandwiches & ribs, subs, hot sandwiches, and burgers

Deli meats/cheeses, they use Boars Head, as with a lot of italian places or deli's nowadays. There's a decent selection of salads and stuff you can get as well displayed similar to other deli restaurants or in a supermarket. 

-----------------------

Myself and another decided to get ""The Butcher Block"" which is their original Italian Sub consisting of black forest ham, salami, hot cappy, pepperoni, with provolone and pepperoncini. 

2 others got ""The Butcher Block Gourmet Steak Burger"" which consists of fresh ground steak from their butcher shop (angus choice and prime beef) with white & yellow American Cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, and pepperhouse gourmaise served on a brioche bun and a side of their thick spiral cut fries

1 got ""The Shroom Burger"" which consists of fresh ground from their butcher shop (Angus choice chuck) with sauteed mushrooms and swiss cheese served on a brioche bun, mayo and a side of their thick spiral cut fries

---------------------

""The Butcher Block"" sandwich was pretty good. One of the better subs ive had. With a choice of white or wheat roll, their soft hoagie style bread was at a length of maybe give or take maybe 10 inches. Stuffed with multiple layers of very thinly sliced meats topped with provolone, thinly cut tomatoes, finely shredded lettuce and a good amount of either like a oil and vinegar or homemade vinaigrette. Light but flavorful. Simple yet delicious. Devoured my sub pretty quick ! LOL om nom nom 

Apparently only HOT sandwiches come with fries... what why? D: 

""The Butcher Block Gourmet Steak Burger"" appears to look really good like a traditional burger with all its toppings. With their mix of choice and prime beef, id think the burger patty itself be pretty good, if seasoned and grilled appropriately. Same for the ""Shroom Burger"" as well. 

Though without looking carefully at the menu, i didnt know they used different meats combinations. Either Angus Choice Chuck (half their burgers),   Angus Choice & Prime beef (their gourmet steak burger), or the Grass Fed Chuck. There's also a turkey burger and an american wagyu chuck too. 

Speaking of which, i didnt know you can add Bacon for $1.50, Avocado for $1, Fried Egg for $1, or Foie Gra for $6 on the burgers... Kind of hard to see on their printed menu without knowing. 

I do wish to return to try either the ""Chip off the Block"" gourmet italian sub or ""The Reuben"" or their burgers myself one day. Pretty good so far, though a little out of the way for me unless im in the area.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,0,4,aqD8EuzzMyHcGi-xDVrWkw

Hungry and tired after a four hour drive from California, stopped at the deli for lunch. Order a Chip Off the Block cold sandwich and a Hot Pastrami sandwich, changed it from Rye bread to a roll. When I arrived home that's exactly what I got pastrami on a roll. The description of the sandwich reads; pastrami navel, Swiss cheese, cole slaw and thousand island dressing (sounds yummy, right) My sandwich was not as described, a roll and pastrami, dry and tough, YUCK! Took two bites and threw the sandwich away. I did call them and he did apologize. He stated I GUESS the kitchen thought you wanted a French Dip. Really, I said ""So where is the Au Jus? I didn't order a French Dip."" Needless to say communication between the person taking the order and kitchen needs an improvement. When in doubt clarify the order, double check the order and ask the customer if it's to their liking. 

Lesson learned, check your order before leaving the ""Chip Off The Block"" deli.

The owner was gracious, offered us to come back and try Pastrami sandwich again on the house. We took him up on his offer and we are so happy we did. Once again we order the Pastrami sandwich as we had before, it was prepared to our liking. My husband said it was even better the next day! I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, talk about yummy! The sauces are absolutely delicious, I hoped they will be bottled and sold in the future. Everything about the sandwich was good, Pork was tasty, loved the coleslaw, including the bun. 

Unfortunately, we overheard a phone call from a disgruntled customer. Their order they picked up wasn't cooked to order. One of the worker stated ""well at least he didn't get charge for the Avocado or the egg, he got but didn't want"". Once again whomever is bagging the order or serving it, must check the order to make sure it was cooked to order.",pN8qjmXfTJnMftpmKwiItA,1,0,4,g2x9KFXVu0f-NfP1q5eHGw

The brisket was awesome. Not overly smoked and got a good portion of the bark which had a really nice flavorful char on it. 

The place was very clean and the employees were very friendly and knowledgable about the meat. 

I can't wait to go back and try more sammiches.

Update. 
On our second visit we got the pulled pork and the beef sandwich with aujus. The porksandwich was killer. Soft flavorful pork with a tangy sauce and coleslaw. Loved it. 
The beef sandwhich ws very good. the beef was tender and had a ton of flavor. The aujus was not really needed but i enjoyed it.
The only thing i did not like on this trip was the potato salad. You would think with sandwhiches this special that the potato salad would be killer but it was pretty bland.

It took about 20 minutes for us to get our food, I understand it's not fast food, but it isn't a something extravagant to make in my opinion. I just think the staff needs to be trained better in efficiency which I get because this place is new. 
I had the bbq tri tip, delish! The meat was a tad dry, and it really needed more bbq sauce, something with a kick. 
Potato salad, BOMB! Kinda reminded me of L&L macaroni salad flavors. A+!
Macaroni-good, I make better. But pairs really great with the food 
Bacon burger-hubby scarffed it down so I was not able to have a bite, but he said it was amazing!

Super yummy.  You can tell this is a quality burger with fresh toppings.  I was a little taken aback by the mustard (little too much for me) but the flavors were all still there. 

The staff - well - they need to go next door and take a lesson from the butcher side (happy, smiley, knowledgeable, friendly) because no smiles, when I asked questions the face said it all.

My Pastrami was tasty but smaller then what I expected & old chips.  Needless to say my expectations were not met on this visit.

It's frustrating to see someone invest hundreds of thousands of dollars into a business only to see it fail because the employees fail to take care of their customers.

I got a chicken sandwich and it was enormous! My husband's pastrami was pretty hearty too. Neither of us were fond of the macaroni salad, but there are lots of other options for the combo. 

I grabbed a menu to take home, as they are so convenient to our house and have a pretty large variety of options. Lunch was less than $30 and we left STUFFED!",45mRoEbA_IvHIyUHpiABBw,4,5,4,wgan1UUaOSRzajGJATu4aQ

I saw this place on Yelp, and saw they use Boars Head products. Already a plus. I stopped off today and picked up lunch for my husband and I. I'm in love. The food is amazing, the people were friendly, and wait was really short for fresh to order sandwiches. I got myself the Block sandwich and my husband the hot pastrami on rye and ordered the BBQ egg rolls for us to share. All of it was great. 

Now the only things I would like to see changed are personal preference I guess. Still a 5 star rating. 
1 - I hated that the only menu that they had to look over was taped do their counter, I felt like I was holding up the cashier and the person behind me because I was a newbie to this place and had no idea what to order. I had to let the customer behind me know she could go ahead and that I was still looking. If there had been a menu I could take and look at and return, I wouldn't have felt so rushed to make a decision. 

2- the BBQ egg rolls are good. But the sauce with them is not the right pairing. It needs to be like a ranch BBQ or BBQ type sauce. It's this weird thousand island type dressing that just doesn't really work with the pork.",dct-Z72jZnpcEFoj21NU-A,2,1,5,70xoaeu_8_G1SB2IcD7xUg

It took about 10 minutes to be able to order because the owner or manager was too busy putting change into the cash drawer (repeatedly asking the employee if he needed more pennies, nickels, dimes, ones, fives, etc).

Finally got to place my order. Sat down to wait for it to be prepared. Every single table was dirty. The floors had all kinds of stuff all over them. It just was not a clean place.

My order arrived after about a ten minute wait. It was ok. Nothing to write home about. Could not keep the sandwich held together to save my life. Had to eat most of it with it fingers. Not much care given to a $10 sandwich.

As I was eating, I observed another employee go on break back in the dining room. She went into the restroom while holding her phone (watching a video). She came out a few minutes later still watching the video on her phone. There is no way she washed her hands.

There's a tv on in the dining room. It had cartoons playing. So either this is for the staff's kids to watch while they're working, or staff is smoking pot in between customers.

When I was leaving, I observed the husband and wife owners leaving the store to walk down to the 7-11. So I know they could have seen all the same things that I did. Yet they did nothing to manage their own business.

Seriously what is wrong with businesses these days? How can you invest and open a restaurant then let it go to crap? Is the business of selling Boars Head meat that good that you feel that no cleanliness or proper management is necessary?

We ordered the BBQ egg rolls, Inferno Burger and the Grilled Chicken sandwich. The BBQ egg rolls were the only thing worth the $30 tab for 2 people. They had great flavor, came with a sweet sauce and were served fresh and cheesy, an excellent choice. The chicken sandwich tasted like rubber. I asked my boyfriend if it maybe wasn't cooked all the way through but he thinks the texture was from being frozen. Anyhow, not an enjoyable grilled chicken which for something so simple, is impressive to mess up. The sidewinder fries were crispy but somehow managed to come out lukewarm. Maybe the fries finished before the sandwich and sat there until then? The Inferno burger definitely had kick but wasn't anything to write home about. The fries served with the burger were also lukewarm. The bonus is that you can get a beer with your meal but if you don't like 1 of the 4 unique canned soda options, I don't remember the brand, you're screwed as there is no fountain drink machine with more mainstream soda options.

After our lunch, we took a look at the butcher side... Unsure if they got a bad batch of poultry but everything in the poultry case looked old and unappetizing and rubbery like the grilled chicken I just had. The red meat cases looked more fresh and definitely looked like the better bet. There was quite a few unique options in the freezer that had potential as well. 

Overall, the deli side kitchen needs to work on freshness and timing for meals and the butcher side looks good for red meat and I'll hope they get better poultry before the next visit.",HSaR700HhNQKj7uXcOqCwA,0,0,2,zty6MMnEl53dvaPb5mMz-A

Next time I will have to be more clear when I order.  The young man who was working was not very personable and I immediately got the feeling that he did not get it right.

2645974,2016-09-09,4,73oP6zoYZKNlO8642EMD_Q,"Solid sliced Smoked Beef Brisket sandwich.  Probably the best I have had in Vegas for sure.  You can tell this meat has been handled meticulously throughout.  I'm pretty sure these Brisket are cooked (smoked) a day or two in advance then cooled to be prepared and served.     Steamed and sauced to perfection after being thinly sliced on a meat slicer.  My sandwich had at least a 1/2 lb or more of tender brisket piled high and sauced with a KC style BBQ sauce.  Served on a tasty toasted sesame onion bun.  The bread was fresh and held together very nicely with the large portion of meat.  I'm not sure the baker of this bread but it had a great onion flavor.  For $10.99 you get this healthy size sandwich and a 6oz side.  I chose the house made American potato salad because I like the mayo mustard flavor.  This one was but could have used bigger chucks of onion and pickle. Otherwise a solid recipe.  

The new and clean facility has seating for about 40-45 people with both 4 top tables and a bar counter area. Also available on the menu was a selection of cold subs sliced fresh to order using Boar's Head meats and cheeses, along with hot subs like a french dip, burgers, and pulled pork.  This is not Subway so expect to wait while your sandwiched is prepared by real ""sandwich artists"".  If your in a hurry and can't be patient.... go somewhere else. 

The deli/restaurant  is conected to a full service butcher shop offering everything from ground beef, to femur bones for marrow, to frog legs.  Beef choices were fresh at fair and market prices. They also carry house made sausages in traditional and unique varieties.  Other prepackaged meats were also available in their refrigerated section. 

Can't wait to try other menu items. Enjoy!

Had the French Dip today. Oh so good! Thinly sliced beef left to char on the griddle until it's crispy on the edges. Yumm!  The meat was tender and juicy and the cheese gooey and melted.  The French roll nicely toasted. Man this sandwich is beautiful.

As for their sides, we ordered mac & cheese, beans, and fries. Beans were great and I'm not a bean fan. Fries were yum! They were big and cheap. Mac & cheese had no flavor. It was the most bland mac & cheese ever! Salt and pepper couldn't fix it. Skip on that!

(+) Enjoyed the tri-tip sandwich with a side can of diet coke. The sandwich was outstanding! The sauce packed plenty of flavor and the meat was tender and juicy! Nothing like a sloppy, saucy BBQ meat sandwich!
(+) I am not thrilled that there are no fountain drinks. They do serve their drinks from cans you grab from the cooler, BUT at least the cans are fairly priced t 99 cents! I can rattle off plenty of places that only serve cans, but gouge the *&^% out of you at $2 or $3 a can! Not here.


The sandwich does come with a choice of a side and I chose Mac and cheese (of course). The mac and cheese was alright, if not spectacular. It was the creamy variety, but in a relatively modest portion.

The dining/ sitting area is deceptively large and spacious. Plus there  are a handful of TV's with CNN, ESPN, etc playing for your entertainment. 

Prices are competitive. Not cheap, but not too bad either.

Gotta say I'm not too impressed. Ordered the Wagyu burger, boyfriend ordered the pastrami sandwich and we got a tri-color pasta to share.
Waited 20 minutes for our takeout order. Which isn't that bad if the food was above par but when I got home, which is only a 2 minute drive. The fries were cold because they aren't in closed containers, little paper baskets. And the bottom bun of my burger is so soggy it's inedible. Gave me paper thin sliced onions, three of them. Paper thin tomatoes, one. And the burger isn't hot.

Boyfriend said the pastrami is pretty good. Good flavor and was hot.

The deli has a large selection of sandwich meats, cheeses, salads and side dishes. Also an eat in area for enjoying hot or cold sandwiches. Cold soft beverages in cans are also available.
Prior to purchasing our meats and seafood next door we decided on some lunch. The Big Hot Dog and a Pulled Pork Sandwich. The Big Dog comes with onions, mustard and a pile of chile and includes french fries. The hot dog is all beef. The french fries are a cut that I have not seen before, shaped like the letter U. Very good fries, not greasy.

The Pulled Pork Sandwich is piled high with nicely smoked meat and topped with Cole Slaw. This is Memphis style, just the way I make it at home. The sandwich comes with french fries but I substituted for a side of beans. The beans had a mild flavor and and mixed in was some pieces of pork.

We will be planning our trips to the butcher shop to facilitate having a sit down lunch at The Chip Off The Block Deli.

Nice to have an 'independent' sandwich shop near work that stocks everything from pork neck bones...to alligator!  Big fan of much of what they are doing at this place.    

I hope management reads these reviews, however, because I do have a few suggestions/requests that I think would improve this place:

1. Please stock and supply CHERRY PEPPERS - sometimes called 'pepper relish' out here in Vegas.  I believe this is a sandwich must.  Capriottis has them. 

2. Not a fan of the  of slicing the sub or hoagie bread all the way through - this makes for a very messy eat.  

3. Not a fan of shredded lettuce, mostly for the same reason as No. 2.  

As someone who grew up in the Philadelphia area, I like to think of myself as a 'sandwich connoisseur,' and so I think the foregoing suggestions are generally applicable (p.s. nice to see scrapple at COTB!).  That said, I suppose I can make personal requests to account for all of the above...except those cherry peppers.

My wife and I ordered 2 brisket sandwiches, a Wagyu burger with sweet potato tots, and a full rack of rib meal from a lady who seemed to be having a rough day.

My usual is their Italian. Sandwiches are generously stacked, and the Boar's Head meats are the best you're probably going to get, this far from the east coast. The hot sandwiches are great, too. I recommend any of their offerings with pastrami. The bread isn't amazing, but it ain't bad. Let's face it. It's hard to get decent bread in the desert. Definitely check out their crazy French fries.

Why I'm docking them 2 stars is management's fault. I told the cashier I just want a pastrami sandwich, not a reuben, and it literally confused the CRAP out of her. It's because they have a reuben on the menu but it's called ""the pastrami."" I told her that's a reuben (it has reuben ingredients) and I just want pastrami and American cheese, lettuce, etc and she was beyond confused. I was a supervisor in a deli for 4 years and let me tell u, it's very very common for people to order hot pastrami sandwiches. Management needs to add a simple pastrami sandwich to the menu (just like how my parents were able to order ""turkey sandwiches"" with no problem) and/or change the pastrami's name to a reuben, which it should be (it even comes on rye and had thousand island dressing.) So management needs to change the menu and/or train employees to understand what a reuben is - a very common sandwich. That's why I blame management.

The service was also very mediocre. The employees would not go into detail about their products. They do not have soda machines or ice water, only soda cans and bottle waters.

The cashier spoke through the window at the cook and I heard him ask if he could make the sandwich quickly before he left. ((leave??? You guys have another hour before closing... who's making the food if the only cook there leaves..???)) 
I don't know, I guess that was just odd and confusing to me.

My brother forgot to ask for the sandwich to be cut in half, which the cook didn't do because I guess he was in such a hurry to leave. There was a lot of meat in the sandwich but the sauce was lacking, which affected the flavor. It was a mediocre sandwich that I would not purchase again. The fries were good; crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The meal cost around $11, which is a bit pricey for what you get.

Another point to add was that when we were waiting for our food, the owner or whoever seemed to be in charge was on the other side (the actual meat selling side) closing, since they close at 7. She saw that the cook left immediately after getting our sandwich done and was literally screaming at the cashier, asking him why he let the cook leave early and was yelling about how the trash ""hasn't even been taken out yet!!"" And the cashier was super chill and was saying how he'll take care of it. I also saw the cashier leave a little after we left, but again, I thought they close at 8???

5515748,2017-05-31,0,73oP6zoYZKNlO8642EMD_Q,This Sandwich Shop / Butcher is a find. Came in ordered The Pull Pork Sandwich it did not disappoint. So tasty no salt or pepper needed Also it was so big I had to take home Half of it. If you like coleslaw you must try the pineapple coconut coleslaw yummy. Over on the Butchers side there were all kind for fresh meat ready go.  From Aging beef to sea food.  The staff and owner are very friendly. It was nice to have someone take the time to make me feel welcomed I will be back,jxLHadsj_llYmqlvEyAGPA,0,0,4,8GgjEJ-8zhj42ih_S6Xhew

I ordered a simple grilled chicken sandwich for my husband. It took them over 30 minutes. 
When I finally did get my order I asked the cashier ""does this sandwich normally take 30 min""

Her response: ""it's the men cooks..they don't know what they are doing""

Me: ""you're going to lose customers that way..I'm not coming back if I have to sit here for 30 min""

Her: ""I don't blame you"" 
? what the hell!


Ehh not coming back",8UFbCGt4WN19LCZobvMPUg,0,0,2,gT5Aye1iqrzUMTav0LQUBg

However, my last visit in Chip was just weird. Their frontline is spaced. They no longer offer any of the salads they used to in the front shelf. Their menu is now limited and they hide their stock menu behind the counter. No more free water for guests waiting. They made me the wrong sandwich. So many little things added up that made me question my loyalty to what used to be the best sandwich and fries in Centennial Hills",uumhcba4pTLampSfClKBEQ,0,0,3,P0vSY-Iqg-K_SruaUiWT6Q

Today we came in and got two kids meals and I repeated we needed the burgers med and they came out past well and with the wrong sides. They kindly remade the one burger we asked them too but took over 15 minutes and we where all done eating and my son had filled up on fries. 

On a lighter note brisket sandwich is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!",DpCaNBUezeOmVW6LEER2tQ,1,1,4,RWFYqV7WKIL85co0iZxbsw
5607950,2018-03-12,0,73oP6zoYZKNlO8642EMD_Q,Stopped by here on the way to pick up the truck in hopes the hubby could have what looked like a good pastrami sandwich. Sadly they were only doing cold sandwiches saying that they are remodeling so I guess we'll have to come back! We both choose a cold sub and bag of chips and really enjoyed our selections of the club and roast beast. Checked out the butcher shop next door and defiantly will be coming back to get some of that in the future!,H5Asta4LpiKmRhSjWaogIg,0,0,4,abZvg_oHdZ3-GR8KLjznUg

What a waste of $11. I was the only person in your establishment and you still couldn't make my sandwich right. Thanks for nothing,fTgEneFEeQGmuK0gBetuZQ,0,0,1,ANPV3z8UPSDt-4CrPeNweQ

5770290,2017-05-24,0,73oP6zoYZKNlO8642EMD_Q,"Great place for a good sandwich. Came here because we were craving a good french dip sandwich and brisket and thought we should finally check it out. We came around 7pm a little before closing. There were a few tables dining and a couple people ordering cuts from the deli counter. I ordered the french dip with fries and hubby ordered brisket sandwich with fries. 

Both came out relatively quickly for how slow things seemed to be moving. Let me say, the the brisket was super juicy and flavorful! We both thought it was tasty. However, the real winner here was the french dip and the slow cooked all day au jus. To die for. So much flavor and oh so delicious. He was actually a little jealous and started dipping his fries in the au jus because it was so good. 

It is a little steep in price, but something I would expect from a small run shop with quality ingredients. Service can be a little slow when waiting to order, but nothing too crazy. Definitely a place we've been back to repeatedly!",iMDnsKqcixMnYwH85L8Nqg,2,1,4,uLerE7iubZEIUVTsB1JluQ
