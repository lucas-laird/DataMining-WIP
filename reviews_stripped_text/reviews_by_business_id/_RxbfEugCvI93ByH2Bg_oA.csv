I can't remember all the dishes we had, but I do remember the Orange Chicken, Lemon Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Cucumber Salad, Chicken Satay, Thai Tea, Sticky Rice & Mango and the shrimp and vegetable rolls that are wrapped in a see-through rice thing that is not fried. Also ordered, were a few other Thai dishes (chicken & beef) and some Vietnamese dishes.

The service was good, and the food was fresh, tasty and priced well. The six of us all agreed that Lilly's would be added to our regular dine-out options. 

The second time we were there, we were shown an insert to the menu, which is already quite large, offering Steak, Lobster and some other pricey dishes ($25.95 - $29.95). None of us tried anything from the insert.",PWRJdCRafTE60OTkn3JCCQ,0,0,5,6K6fnf5QPNaChZQ3IKTa0w

The pork satay was beyond description - buttery and slightly charred - absolutely delicious.  +1 Star.  The summer rolls were crisp and fresh.  The shrimp in the rolls were a beautiful pink colour and perfectly cleaned.  +1 Star.

I had ordered two entrees - crispy duck and the pho dac biet xe lua.  The crispy duck was very good, although the garlic was a little strong and the duck was not crispy.  +1/2 Star.  The pho dac biet xe lia was awesome!  The broth with additions was flavourful and robust.  It contained a generous portion of all the meats and delectable bits of tripe and marrow.  +1 Star.

The menu was so extensive and everything looked so good, that it took us forever to choose. We ended up with the drunken noodles with tofu and soft shell crab with green curry.

My noodles were the perfect amount of spice, though I would have preferred more vegetables. Let me make it clear that a normal person would have been happy with the amount of tofu/vegetables, but I just like more... I am 99.9% sure that if I had told her this, I would have been accommodated (but now I know for next time). The soft shell crab was nice and crispy, with the perfect accompaniment of vegetables, and a bowl of rice. The dessert was a hit for us however, and I'm sure it was hard for my fianc√© to share that block of sweet sticky rice with me. I could eat just a bowl of that rice alone!

2143829,2012-03-24,2,_RxbfEugCvI93ByH2Bg_oA,"This was the worst Thai Food that I have ever had in my life. 
My boyfriend ordered Pad See Ew and it was full of tiny pieces of broken, overcooked noodles, (seriously....the longest noodle that we could find was about an inch long) TONS of grease, a few dried up pieces of chicken and what seemed like an entire bulb of raw garlic, roughly chopped into huge chunks. 
To add insult to injury, it was served lukewarm, which is a miracle in itself, seeing as how we were the only people in the restaurant and we sat there and watched the cook hand the food to the server.
I ordered the Pad Prik King, my favorite dish, but what I received was definitely NOT Pad Prik King! Pad Prik King is an extremely flavorful and pungent dish that contains green beans, meat, fish sauce, basil, red curry paste and kaffir lime leaves. The sauce is always bright orange in color.
NONE of these things were in the meal that they served me....not even the green beans! I asked the server to make sure that this was, indeed, Pad Prik King, and she said that it was. But what was in front of me was a plate of mixed vegetables with greyish colored rubbery mystery meat served in a flavorless brown gravy---like the kind you would buy in a jar to put on mashed potatoes--- filled with huge chunks of the aforementioned rough chopped raw garlic. No fish sauce, no kaffir lime leaves, no fresh basil....nothing but meat and veggies in a brown, garlicky paste. 
And mine, too, was served lukewarm.

Kind of weird at first but after you realize you have the undivided attention of Tippy the waitress and the food is fresh and well-made, it's not that big of a deal that you're the only ones in the restaurant.

This place recently opened in Sept so it's still new to the locals.  I'm not a local but I found them through restaurant.com.  Used my certificate the first night but the second night, got a 15% discount.

First, thai tea is not $3.95, but $2.95.  Still expensive but it's really concentrated and in a big glass that you can actually mix w/ water and get at least 2 glasses out of it.  We like ours not too sweet so we were able share it w/ 3 ppl. 

Here's a list of some of our favorites:
-Pho (the first one, can't remember name but this was delicious.)
-Fried Snapper with Basil sauce (fish was fresh)
-Panang curry with beef
-Fried Banana with Mango Ice Cream (YUM)

The atmosphere is nice and laid back with plenty of space.  They serve wine and beer.    Overall my experience here was pleasant, mostly due to our server.  However, I have mixed feelings about the Thai food here.  Let's get started.

A friend and I ordered the Sam Rot with chicken ($9.95), the red duck curry ($16.95), and the Lilly's chicken wings appetizer ($6.95).  I have had Sam Rot before, so my opinion probably isn't well educated here, but it seemed like a sweet dish.  It was lightly fried and served with a sweet slightly sour and savory sauce.  It was well prepared, no grease, and had a nice light (although sweet) flavor.  Interesting, but not overly impressive.  The Lilly's chicken wings were well done as well, but again lightly sweet.  The style seemed slightly Chinese.  They were good though so no complaints.  The duck curry is where I had a little disappointment.  The serving at first seemed large enough, but upon further examination there was very little duck for the price.  A well known Thai restaurant nearby has three times the amount of duck for nearly the same price.  The duck itself was tender and not gristly.  It was well prepared.  The curry was very light on this dish, and used more like a sauce.  It had a good flavor but was a little bit too sweet.  The cooked veggies were good but nothing to rave about.  

Overall this is a decent Thai restaurant.  Would I return?  Well the menu is large, but the food seems a little too sweet for my Thai tastes.  I would like to explore some of the other menu items though.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,3,2,3,C0QL5EwB1qCGPrUVi7_9rg

2861464,2012-01-13,2,_RxbfEugCvI93ByH2Bg_oA,"Thai and Vietnamese offerings?  Upon looking at the menu, I was instantly impressed.

What we ordered:
Lychee Drink - Yummy.. actual pieces of Lychee.  Mmmm.
Thai Coffee-  Very good here.  I recommend it.
Vietnamese Spring Rolls- Nothing fancy here
Calamari- Very good, it tasted very fresh.
Beef Panang Curry-  We always order this when we do Thai.  We were not impressed.
Chicken Pad Thai-  Pretty good.  We nearly finished it.
Deep Fried Banana w/ Coconut Ice Cream-  Had strawberries in it.  I liked it, but I don't think I'd order it again...  It was really good, just very sweet!

Pros:
  * There is an extensive menu that is separated Thai & Vietnamese ( I liked the layout)
  *  Lunch specials available.  Decently priced. 
  *  Lychee Drink.  Yes this is a plus!  I love Lychee!!
  *  Good sized portions
  * Attentive server.  
  *  I loved the Thai Coffee here. 

Cons:
  *  I noticed there were spring rolls on the Vietnamese menu, but the server pointed out the spring rolls on the Thai side of the menu.  He insisted I order that instead... if I'm not mistaken, it was a dollar more?  I just found that a bit confusing.
 *  The beverages were a bit over-priced.  Nearly $3 each for Thai Coffee and Lychee.
 * Panang Curry.  We were not impressed.  In Lilly's defense, the veggie cuts in the Panang Curry were larger than usual and did have a more fresh taste.  It's just that it was not as flavorful when in comparison to other places where we had this dish.

Tips:
  *  Make sure to eat your Calamari while its still hot.  It doesn't taste as great after it gets to room temperature (I've never had this problem when ordering Calamari elsewhere).  Also if you want a lemon wedge with your Calamari, you'll have to ask for it.
  *  The dessert was big enough for 2 to share.  
  *  I know some Thai restaurants use a 1-10 scale for level of heat, but at Lilly's they just ask if like it mild, medium, or hot.  Just a heads up.
  
Overall,  I plan on coming back.

When we walked in, we were pretty much given a warm welcome by everyone and seated at a nice table by the window. The waiter gave us both the regular menu and the lunch special menu and asked us if we had any coupons. We debated on whether we were going to get lunch specials or use the certificate, but since they already took it we figured we might as well. The menu had a VERY large selection with one side being Thai and the other being Vietnamese. Since we originally came here for Thai food, we decided to stick with our plan. We ordered Calamari, Beef Pad Thai, Chicken Panang, Lychee drink, Thai Coffee, and the Fried banana with ice cream dessert. 

The drinks came first and we were both in love. The Thai Coffee I got was was light and tasty. Sometimes i get Thai Coffee or Tea and it's just waay too sweet or concentrated. This one was made perfectly. The Lychee drink, however, was the star of the whole meal. It was SOO delicious! It tasted just like the Lychee Jelly cups I used to eat when I was a kid. Don really had to try hard not to drink it all at once. 

They brought out the Calamari first. It didn't really strike me as calamari at first sight/taste. It was extremely crunchy and fried, but I really enjoy crunchy food. I actually tasted the batter a lot more than the Calamari itself. It was served with a little cucumber/peanut salad and sweet/sour sauce. We left a few pieces and ended up eating them during our meal, but by then they were kind of cold and a little soggy and the flavor just wasn't good, so I suggest you don't let it sit for a while. The Panang Curry wasn't as flavorful as what I'm used to; it had a more subtle taste, but it was okay. The Pad Thai was very good though. The noodles and meat were both perfectly cooked. 

After eating our entrees, we decided to try their Fried Banana and Ice Cream (coconut). The presentation was very nice (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wWrB4eU6MmK4J9I_8vzOPQ/l.jpg). The banana pieces were so small, especially since they were all surrounded in wrapping, but they still went very well with the coconut ice cream, which was very fresh (not icy at all). 

Overall, we definitely plan on coming back here. Next time, we'll be trying items from their Vietnamese menu!

Tips:
-You MUST try their Lychee drink!!
-Get a Restaurant.Com certificate for more savings
-If you order Calamari, don't let it sit for more than 5 minutes

The soup came out, piping hot and quite tasty.  There was a certain 'funk' about the mushrooms that we couldn't pinpoint, but it was good, nonetheless.

I could smell the odor of (raw) fish steaming from my dish.  I took a couple of bites and was completely overthrown  by the stench and overpowering taste of fish (my guess is it was from the fish sauce).

I did like the fact that I could hear in the kitchen as they were making the salad, hearing everything being chopped up and mixed - fresh and homemade.  

For some reason, I didn't care for the tea.  Perhaps it wasn't hot enough.  The service I thought was OK, not great, but not bad either.   Functional, but lacking the ""warm and friendly"" factor I think is so important for these types of places.  

Also I think the physical presentation factor of the place could be improved.  It looks ""hit-or-miss"" from the outside, and if it weren't for the good yelp reviews, I doubt I would have given it a shot.

The waiter seemed to be very invested in the food, so I think he may have been the owner or manager.  He asked us how he could improve the dishes, even though they were already delicious.  I told him I would have to try something *better* before I could critique it.  He was very friendly, very attentive, and it was a wonderful experience.  We will definitely be back.",iVwrlLVs3J2mgS7Pix-Wkw,0,0,5,iLDjxJdOgeLCUE3jTar-Sg

We ordered Chinese style egg rolls.  They were quite good, served very hot such that we had to let them sit for quite awhile to prevent mouth burn.

For main courses, my wife ordered their garlic stir fry with chicken.  It was just the way she likes it, lots of garlic and a good amount of chicken with some vegetables.  I ordered the soft shell crab in garlic curry sauce.  They didn't ask me about a spiciness level and I didn't specify one.  It was a mild curry, but it was very good.  The crab was on top of asparagus and some yellow squash and zucchini.  The presentation of both dishes was very good.

For dessert, I tried the custard-Thai style.  It's more like a piece of bread pudding.  It was very flavorful and quite enjoyable.  My wife got some green tea ice cream.

We enjoyed our meal a lot!  The place is small--the sign says Maximum Occupancy 49.  Our server was very efficient.  There was a small language barrier but we overcame that with numbers and by pointing.

After the meal, he asked two things--how was the food?  Did we think it was priced fairly?  It's as if they are trying to find pricing that gets business but doesn't break their bank.  I did find the question quite odd.

We will be back.  I have to try some of the Vietnamese dishes.  And when my wife asks, ""Are you going to write about this restaurant on the computer?"" (Is the pope Catholic?), you know she enjoyed her meal a lot!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,3,4,4KyavdkWrtxKUeKvfpXTTQ

We came here with high expectations after reading some of the reviews here. Ordered the Tom Kai gai, viet spring rolls, the pad Thai, pho bo, and panang curry chicken between the 2 of us. After tasting them all, I've concluded that this is the worst Thai/Viet restaurant I have yet to try in the entire Las Vegas area. The pho was absolutely tasteless, almost like water and noodles, and even with some hoisin sauce it just tasted like water with noodles with hoisin sauce. The curry looked like it came out of a fast food place, the carrots and chicken were so horribly cut they look like they were made by a 5 year old, and the sauce was way too salty. The Tom Kai gai was too creamy, it was literally like coconut cream with some chicken in it. Maybe I've gone to Lotus of Siam too recently to have my tastes spoiled, but after trying 5 dishes I can safely say that I don't know what every other review says is right, perhaps it's even contrived.

She says... 
Coming from a Vietnamese gal, I really have to say the broth of the Pho was extremely tasteless. I never seen a restaurant who did not bring out the hoisin and hot sauce when serving Pho. I had to ask the servers for it and after having the sauces for 5 minutes, the servers took it back as if they only had one set. I understand that there might be a possibility that the chef forgot  to add the flavors but we did not receive an apology after telling the server about the Pho. Pad Thai was the best out of all we ordered I have to say. Panang curry was wayyyy to salty. Even with the white rice didn't help hide the saltiness. Servers was very attentive, too much I say, but maybe because we were the only table there at 7:30pm on a Sunday night. I'm usually not to critical when it comes to food but I could not say anything for this restuarant. I give them a solid 2/5.",1Rrbrr16vEI9fGhYKOVOGQ,1,0,2,bubhPJVmyNEycoc1nIjPdw
4470086,2013-02-27,0,_RxbfEugCvI93ByH2Bg_oA,"This was our first and last visit for dinner using a $10 Restaurant.com coupon.  It was hidden in a small strip mall on W Sahara Ave/near S Rainbow Blvd in Las Vegas.  When we walked in, the owner gestured for us to sit down.  There was only a party of three there with a coupon. A woman walked in with a Groupon and the owner said they are no longer accepting Groupons so she walked out.  

They do not have a website but they do have a Facebook page.  They had Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese items on the menu.  The Vietnamese food was reasonably priced.  The curry, duck, seafood, and some of the specialty entrees were expensive.

The tables had burgundy table cloths covered with glass.  A single Cala Lily was in a vase at each table.  Rap music was playing.

The owner took our order, left the menu in our hands and then brought us glasses of water 10 minutes after we walked in.  My friend ordered the Shrimp and Pork Noodle Bowl and I ordered the Shrimp Rice Plate.  We also ordered the Summer Rolls.

The two Summer Rolls came out on a plate with peanut sauce.  They were not cut in half.  I like my Summer Rolls to be cut in half.  There was no mint or shredded carrot garnish like on the Facebook page.

About 25 minutes after we arrived, the owner told me that thay were out of white steamed rice.  He asked me if I wanted brown rice or noodles.  I said noodles were okay.  Why didn't he tell me that when I ordered #34?  What Asian restaurant runs out of white rice during prime dinner time?

The owner was also the cook.  I could see him frying something.  A young Asian guy walked in and started clearing plates from the other party's table.  He must have been out on a delivery.

The Shrimp and Pork Noodle Bowl had 3 boiled or barely grilled shrimp on a skewer with yellow squash and sliced carrot.  There was about 2 tablespoons of BBQ pork. There was shredded carrot and peanut garnish.

The Shrimp Rice Plate was now a noodle bowl with 2 skewers of 5 shrimp and vegetables with a garnish of shredded carrot and chopped peanuts.  It was served with fish sauce.  I had to ask for a spicy tray to give the entree some flavor.

We did not get a refill of water nor did the owner check on us.  We will not be back.",XKo5IT6o-WslzHPT69PRSQ,0,0,2,c3PTB3lF2zQMbsvaabHg3A

I was put off a bit by the exterior - ""Vietnamese and Thai Restaurant"" in hand-painted letters made it look like a take-out joint.  Inside it was rather plain, too well-lit, and lacked much atmosphere, but didn't look like a take-out place.  

The menu was huge, and it was hard to decide what to order:  Thai? Vietnamese? Chinese?  Our friend is Vietnamese, so she helped us choose which Pho to order.  The Pho was absolutely delicious!

We also asked for two orders of the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, and she even repeated the Vietnamese name.  But when the first of the two orders came out, it was the fried roll, not the healthier unfried one our friend specified.  Our waitress seemed flustered, didn't speak English very well, and apparently was Thai, and not Vietnamese.  She also didn't seem to have very much experience.

The other hubby ordered the Calamari and he liked it;  I tasted it and it was way too greasy for me.

Our Asian friend had a dish with pork rinds and rice, and when it was served, she was dismayed by the tiny portion of pork;  she said that at other places, there's usually a big mound of it.  Here, she had to do extensive digging before she could even find it.

We also got two orders of Pad Thai, one with shrimp, the other with chicken.  Wee all found it too sweet, and I thought it was unsufferably sweet.

Other than the Pho, there is nothing compelling about the food here, and the service didn't make up for it.  If it weren't for the Pho, I'd be giving Lilly's two stars.  But I guess I'm in the minority, since other reviewers seem to disagree with me.  I guess that's what makes horse races.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,0,3,6ZvBGxBrg8jZPBlDvmWBwA

We stopped in for our midday meal, and we were greeted with friendly, attentive service even though they were training a new waitress who couldn't answer all of our questions. However, we ask a lot of goofy questions (can we get this with broccoli only, or that with more garlic, is this a good one, and so on). They were very eager for feedback and special orders did not upset them. 

The menu is huge, so it is hard to imagine they can do it all well. We went with some basic stir fry dishes on their lunch specials menu. Fresh, generous and saucy are the three adjectives I would choose. I ordered the garlic chicken with broccoli only, and later in the day, driving down the highway I realized I had an entire chunk of fresh garlic wedged between my back teeth. Not so great for the breath, and perhaps a bit too much information, but a perfect indicator that the chef here is chopping up the cloves by the dozen and cooking them up on the spot in the dishes. The waitress said, ""If you like garlic, you will not be disappointed,"" and she was right! It was very flavorful. 

The lunch special comes with a spring roll and is $6.95. A little cup of soup would be a nice addition to the lunch price, but I had enough to eat. 

One disappointment was the lack of brown rice. We are avoiding white rice as much as possible these days, so the husband went without rice. I ate about half of the jasmine rice they served, and it was good, just the wrong color. Hopefully, if they get busier, they will add brown rice, and Lilly's will then become a true repeat eat!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,15,7,4,4590PyWxo_chgcjrurnokQ

So I dropped in for lunch just after 11am on a  Thursday and I had the entire restaurant all to myself until I was 95% done with my meal.  It was pretty awesome, like having your own personal chef and butler :)

After studying the menu for along time, as if I was cramming for a quiz, I ended up ordering Lilly's Chicken Wings again.  It was crispy with good flavor, before being dressed in a modest amount of sauce. It comes with 6 pieces of wings, so it is perfect for sharing. But this appetizer came out last, contrary to my expectation of the order that the dishes I ordered would be brought out to the table. 

Lilly's House Noodle. Stir fried noodle in house sauce w/ vegetables and seafood was tasty.  It packed just the right amount of flavor for me, and I would not hesitate to order it in the future.

The Crispy Duck, made with boneless duck, lightly battered and topped with Chef's special sauce was good. Big portion, but the nice crispy duck was covered in sauce.  I was told that was the traditional country style presentation of that dish. I still like it, but felt that it was a shame to undo the crispy duck skin at plating. I liked this duck dish, but will tried one of the other duck items on the menu in the future.

Service was great.  Food was brought out promptly. I also drank a lot of water as it was still rather warm outside, and never had to asked for the glass to be refilled.

I really don't want to be a hater, but the dining public has to be WARNED. the whole dining experience to SUM it all up was DISAPPOINTING & the food was UNSAVORY, MSG filled and OVERPRICED. I went on an MSG induced coma after that dinner. Now i am going to give you our orders by the $$$  $9 minced pork lettuce wrap (way too salty with frozen veggies), $11fried calamari (very greasy and it was mostly batter little squid), $4 Vietnamese fried spring rolls (2 pcs of mediocre egg rolls) $9BBQ pork(bland no flavor, it wasn't what I wanted anyways, I asked the waitress if they were on skewers and she said yes and they weren't) $9 grilled pork meatball(5 tiny pieces with lettuce and limp noodles, mediocre at best) THATs just appetizers! For entrees we had $8 Pho Dac Biet (contrary to other reviews it was not good. The soup did not taste like real beef broth at all) $10 lemon grass steak (small pieces of beef with tons of  overcooked veggies, green onions mostly, I did not see nor taste any lemon grass, too salty) $9 Singapore noodles (again wrong info from waitress, seems like she just answers yes to every question asked...hmmm) honestly I really did not understand the flavor of this dish, it was not good too. $19 sea bass with ginger sauce, the sauce was good, but the fish was not fresh, it was flaky & dry. $5 Tom yum gai soup bowl (supposed to be with shrimp instead of chicken, but language barrier once again) it was ok, nothing special, the chicken had a stench to it, my nose is really sensitive to that kind of stuff.) DRINKS $3 lychee juice(ok), $3 Thai lemonade (too sweet) DESSERT $6 mango with sticky rice (mangoes were sour, sticky rice & coconut sauce ok) Which leads us to a GRAND total of $153 including 18% gratuity & tax, less $50 gift cert we paid $103 out of pocket, divided between 5 adults, it was $20/person. Now don't get me wrong am not whining about the price nor did I say that the servers where rude, I just thought it was a huge RIP OFF and for the %18 tip we had to leave the service was at best mediocre (they should provide an interpreter) Needless to say I learned my lesson, sometimes what you think is a good DEAL might turn out to be a RIP OFF.

We decided to share a panang curry with pork and a chicken pad thai to share.The curry was pretty good, but I had hoped it would be a little thicker and flavorful. It was just a little more watered down than I had expected. The pad thai was on the slimy side. It wasn't the most pleasant texture, but aside from the texture it had a good flavor, albeit a little on the sweet side.. We finished our meal with a mango and sticky rice. I can never resist sticky rice, so was happy with this rendition.
