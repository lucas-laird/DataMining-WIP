I wouldn't recommend this place if you have more than 6 people. We also came on a bad day because one of the air conditioners was broken, so it was really hot in there.
You seat yourself and grab a check-off list to mark what you want to order. I ended up getting the cuttlefish nugget noodle. The noodle was okay, soup was flavorful. The cuttlefish was extremely bland though. We also marked that we wanted to get the milk with mango snow ice. Turns out they ran out of mango and milk, but they didn't tell us until we finished our food. I have no idea why they didn't let us know in the beginning since we could've ordered a different one. We ended up not getting any. Bummer.
Overall, this place is just okay. Nothing special. Would've been a 3 star but dropped one star for the lack of communication, especially since it wasn't even busy.",Mji05ZiUS4dtjjAH8oQ5mg,0,0,2,Sr_ti4cj2-MOkPUwd8nGdw

It's only my second time here. The first time, my friend treat me for some shaved ice. I LOVED it because she asked for extra milk and even told us that if we need more, all we need is ask.

I tried it the second time, by myself, and ordered the same exact thing. I asked for extra milk, and they gave me just a little. The second time I ask, the guy gave me a small platter of nothing but condensed milk. He told me that it's $.50 extra! I was like WTF!

Waiting.  Waiting. The lady who seemed like she owned the place came by twice to see if I got mine and she yelled to the back.. About the meatball.  Nope. Saw a new table get seated next to me ten minutes later.  They ordered something. Then saw one of the staff member bring over their meatball. I was really annoyed at that.  
Finally I just asked for the check.  Then the lady came by and said ""so you want me to wrap it up for you to go?""  

No. I do not want you to wrap it up for me to go!  You forgot about my dish. She didn't offer any compensation.  No discount for forgetting. Horrible especially when you over look a dish and I only had two. And then you try to sell me to take it home after 25 min sitting and waiting. I had already finished my first dish a while ago and I just sat there.

Stinky tofu is a dish I always get at every Taiwanese restaurant (if they have it), so I have tried some from the 'bleh' range to the 'best' in Taiwan. The tofu they serve here is crispy, juicy, and not too stinky! It's not bad~ however, the pickled cabbage on the side wasn't too great.

4005024,2015-09-08,19,U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ,"We were looking to grab lunch in the area, and came across this Taiwanese restaurant on Yelp. The large counter, tiled floors, open kitchen, TV, and a handful of small tables summed up the small interior. We were the only customers throughout the entire time, so there wasn't much of an atmosphere to report. 

The paper menu came as a checklist of Taiwanese street food and old country flavors. I initially wanted the Taiwanese Pork Intestine Noodles ($7.99), but they were out and waiting for the ingredients to arrive from California. Instead, we ordered the Rice Cupcake ($4.50) where the wet, mushy sticky rice had already fell apart by the time it reached our table. Our server didn't seem to care whether we noticed the sloppy presentation. The other peculiar aspect of this dish was the red sauce. It was not supposed to be tomato based, but resembled ketchup. 

The Taiwanese Meat Ball ($3.99) came with a very good glutinous exterior. The thickness, and firm chewy qualities was spot on along with the embedded ground pork. However, the Meat Ball also came with the same ketchup sauce, which ruined the experience.

Finally, the Minced Pork Rice Noodles ($6.99) came with ground pork and hard boiled egg that didn't carry the deep stewed flavors. Equally subpar was the broth that tasted like water. 

Service was friendly, but the experience was so lackluster that we didn't care to stay for shaved ice or other desserts. In short, I rather eat at other mediocre Taiwanese restaurants than this one. It was not worth the visit.",0juzbrgcLHqobdK-OZAyiw,23,20,2,Rt-ui8ehjWNiCpH64iwTsw

If you have room for desserts, definitely try either the Strawberry or the Fresh Fruit. The size is good for about 2-3 people depending on how hungry y'all are.

4119102,2013-09-04,0,U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ,"I have been to this place 3 times. And it went from 3 star to 2 star and finally stayed at 2 star. 

First of all, severely over-prized. Average dish price is around $7 if not more. The portion are small. Initially, it gets a 3-star for a good shaved ICE that is not available in the entire valley of Las Vegas, and the only similar shaved ice can only be found in southern California. This is the highlight of their dish. 

However, their hot dishes are average at the most. Over priced and portion very small. Having taste buds that is spoiled by authentic stuff in southern california and Los angeles, this place will be out of business within few weeks if it were there. However, rarity survives and unfortunately there is not competition in vegas. 

That being said, a few things that really upset me. Most of all is their pricing. A few examples are: Their pig ears and all the ""small appetizer plates"" that they have in the fridge are a total rip off at $5 a dish. I can get those less than $3 in any other decent place. I don't know if they're paying for the expensive rent at the location. The spicy Wonton has 8-9 pieces of wonton in a very small place for a costly price, that was the most ridiculous dish. The crispy chicken rice is decent, but again, over-priced. Taiwanese sausage rice is not bad, but again, overpriced. I've tried most of their dishes before I wrote this review, and it's sad because being one of the few Taiwanese cuisines, they have so much potential but completely screwed it up. I'm going to say I will not go back there again. 

Word of advice: With the price you have to pay, you might as well go next door to decent Japanese Restaurants, or all you can eat sushi, or even tea station next door.

One of the few foods I ate while on my excursion to Vegas needed to be good. I love Taiwanese food, so why not? I got two things, the chili oil wontons, and stinky tofu.

Chili oil wontons - these tasted all right. They weren't as flavorful and oily as A&J Restaurant (Irvine, CA), but they were okaay. It tasted very fresh, and the flavors were bright, but nothing really stood out for me on this. The oil itself wasn't spicy at all really and didn't really stick to the wontons themselves. It was more of a dipping sauce I guess.. 

Stinky tofu - This is probably best shareable. Compared to that one place in Rowland Heights (can't remember, sorry), the stinky factor isn't totally pungent. It had the stinky element yes, but it wasn't bad. These I enjoyed more than the wontons I think. The tofu however, when you bite in, seemed to have more holes in it than actual tofu. Wha?

The service is kinda whatever. The guy got my order wrong and almost gave me something that I didn't order, and insisted that I had ordered it. They never really checked up on me but that's cool, it's not like I need someone to talk to during my meal lol

She sat me and gf at the tightest area by the cashier even tho there are more spacious tables available.  Shit.. Should have walked out right there.   Ordered a fried pork chop rice,  spicy wonton, wonton soup, and sticky rice.   

The spicy wonton was not spicy at all but drenched in vinegar.   Sour.   Disgusting. Ding Tai Fung spicy wonton is 1000% better. 

The pork chop was the smallest chop I've ever seen.  It was disgraceful.  Its the size of my asian palm divided by 2.  Couldn't believe the waitress handed me the dish.   Tasted ok but the egg and vegetables are super sloppy. 

The wonton soup was plain.  I actually tried to wash the spicy wontons with the soup but they were still sour.

Sticky rice was frozen and cold still in the middle and the sauce was overly sour.   Damn..  what is up with the sour!?   I'm from Taiwan and this stuff is really bad.

Meanwhile the grandma lady consistently hover over us while eating and said.. ""delicious huh?   The best u ever had huh?"" In Chinese...   No its the absolute worst I have had but it's the holidays and I didn't want to hurt her feelings.  She is delusional but make a great timeshare sales person because I think she really believes the food is great.

I'll definitely be coming back for more!",FzT-ujff-c11Wa_WdItwig,0,0,5,8nSDZ3YFdVX1x-NpBKaBWg

5817008,2016-02-18,0,U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ,"We thought this place was fantastic. Some of the best Taiwanese food we've had in Vegas for sure. In fact we liked it more than Noodle Pot a few doors down. The salt and pepper chicken was truly amazing. Huge portion size, cooked to order, very authentic and hearty. What set it all off was the nice variety of pickled vegetables that come with it. We always judge a Taiwanese place based on their minced pork and this place did not disappoint. Tender and flavorful. Service was decent enough, the food came out quickly and their prices are very reasonable. We'll be back for sure.",w-fkht6rk_MszTx6g9zqXg,0,0,4,mWH7-3Lj8bBmHLGRl7Kwog
5844743,2014-04-09,0,U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ,"For those looking for a bit of Taiwanese taste in Vegas, especially southern Taiwanese flavor (Tainan, Kaohsiung area), this is a great place to find it. As the name suggests, the place isn't about big and fancy. It is more about home cooking or comfort food, Taiwanese comfort food, to be exact. I really enjoyed it.  Too bad I was too full.  Otherwise the shaved ice looked pretty good. Definitely something you won't find anywhere on The Stripe. I will return again. I highly recommend it.",St-jKSpxe3v0qAT9y8TsYw,0,0,4,wVEv7V1CYSE_PMuf-OZabQ

In a place where Taiwanese food is not abundant, you can't really complain.  However, coming from the San Gabriel Valley, this is such a ripoff.  The food was ok too.  If you're that desperate for some Taiwanese food, this place would be the place, but I wouldn't really bother.",CkVjeTQNQol9A7R21sa_mw,2,0,2,AE2VQu67l4z5UdcEUkWVoQ
