Staff --super duper friendly smiley and attentively checking on me often and happily give recommendations
Food - -Great portion size if not on the larger side For the sake of trying out their food i ordered chicken fried steak, pay $1 extra to have French toast as my side. Otherwise it comes free with toast, pancakes or muffin I think 
Fried steak is totally crispy outside and moist inside 
I chose over easy eggs with it 
French toast done perfectly ..unlike most restaurants they bathed the heck out of the toast in eggs these are done perfecto!!! 
Theres also a car wash service while you eat lol! If you choose to, then come by Sat or Sun 
I say two thumbs up here but I like give them one extra ...so Three Thumbs Up",n_TY6rd1wXZBczBaOaK6Rw,0,0,5,B7SL5z4PiWoYRJZ17mwg6A

It had been awhile since we ate here so we thought what the heck.  The service was the worst I have had.  Figuring it was just a bad day we ended up going back twice.  Both times I felt like they could careless if we were there or not.  Don't know the waitress' name but she is there all the time.  I know it is a family ran business and all but if my family was just sitting on their butts and not paying attention to the customers they wouln't have a job anymore.  It just seems like they don't need to go the extra mile, well hate to tell ya but you do.

This chicken fried steak and cream gravy doesn't match up to my favorite places back home but when I have a craving for CFS I can go here and it hits the spot.

I ordered the breakfast meal with the wggs over medium and breakfast potatoes and wheat toast.  

Portion size: perfect.  The CFS wasn't hanging over the plate like back home but I could eat everything and not feel too bad about myself. (Should have asked for more gravy)

Eggs were slightly overcooked. But id rather have harder yolks than runny whites.

Potatoes yummy. Nicely seasoned. 

Toast was well toasty. 

To drink I had the sweet tea.  Now that also was to my tast.  It not as sweet as say a Georgia Southern sweet tea but more like a Texas sweet tea.  If you don't know what im talking about just go to breakfast and try it.

Now about the service.  (A lot of the reviews here talk about the rude guy)  there were two guys a littler guy (quiet and friendly) and our server. He was a bigger guy (hed be a hoss in Texas)  I wouldn't call him rude.  Gruff maybe blunt yeah but Frienldy and didn't treat us poorly.

We go in, the place is nice.  It is small, with a country home type of vibe.  There were a few tables with people sitting and one waitress.  (This was a Wed. early afternoon.)  The waitress came by and was the most unpleasant person you could ask for.  No ""How are you's?, Do you have any questions? First time here?""  Nothing.  She just asked, ""Are you ready to order, then just looked at my wife.""  She had the fried chicken, and I had the chicken fried steak.

Salad came first, it was filled with wilted, brown lettuce.  You couldn't, or didn't want to eat half of it.  (Now, I am NOT one of these weird picky people, I'm a hungry man, I'll eat most crap).  The food came out next.  My wife's chicken was fried to a burnt dry crisp.  The size of the chicken portion was so small it was a joke.  You have never seen a smaller wing.  I joked that it must have come from a chick.  You know the reject wings you may get at Buffalo Wild Wings when you order like twenty of them, yeah, these wings were smaller than those reject ones.  Garbage.  

I had the chicken fried steak.  It was a tv dinner.  It was a breaded salisbury steak you get in a hungry man dinner.  They slop the mashed potatoes on top of it.  The potatoes were ok as were the rolls.    

Waitress asked for our coupon when we ordered, I wonder if they give you crap food because of the two for one?  Wilted lettuce and mini chicken.

Maybe we got the wrong food, I don't know.  I ordered the chicken fried steak because it said on the coupon ""Best in Vegas"".  I thought the place was nice, maybe breakfast.   

Now, this is my third review....all negative.  That's most likely what it's going to be.  I'll review positive places if I think they need the help (like a new place), usually they don't as people know they are good..  I just want to warn people to be careful of some of the bad experiences I've had.

I had the quesadilla with the best salsa I've ever eaten...very fresh and not too hot...just perfect for me.  My friend had the shrimp basket ... excellent quality and taste there as well.  It was a ""to go"" order, and the young male server was friendly and courteous.  Outdoor seating in this quaint place...if you are going to Red Rock or the state park out Blue Diamond...just turn south on Buffalo (Rainbow is having construction), past Mountain's Edge Parkway (there will be a park on the left) and then left on Cactus (you will see their placard on the right edge of Buffalo at Cactus) and go till it dead ends about 1/4 mile on the right..

The boyfriend, daughter, and I walked in.  There was one table in the whole place and there were 4 people waiting inside by the door.  Waitress was sitting backwards in a chair (very professional) next to the only existing table talking to them and still didn't acknowledge ANYONE for at least a full minute. Finally she comes over, scoffs, grabs a hand full of menus, doesn't say a word and walks away to a large table. She looked back, seeing our confusion as to what she was doing, and she said ""aren't you all together?"" She took the 2 separate couples to their tables, then walked us over to a booth, still not saying a word, threw down the menus, and walked away. Had she not already been talking when we walked in, I would swear she was a mute. 

Eventually, a dude that I assume is a busser, came over and said ""What do you want to drink?"" And asked us if we wanted to start with a cinnamon roll. Bf said yes.  Finally receive our drinks, and cinnamon roll, for which they gave us no appetizer plates so we could share it, and the waitress asked ""What do you want to eat?"", basically barking at us, without even asking if we were ready.  

Took forever to get the food, and throughout our whole meal, we got to hear the loud, obnoxious conversation between the wait staff and the table next to us. Obviously they were regulars. Never got checked on and food was absolutely disgusting. Bf had pancakes, my daughter had kid's mac and cheese, and I had a veggie omelet.

All while I was eating there was a table with about 8 loud idiots and one even louder obnoctious server ( she was overweight missing teeth with random tattoos also heard it was Jason the monoton grouch's sister) well she showed them all the love and none stop loud banter. At one point she asked them all to turn around and flip off her brother (Jason) which of course they did!

The whole time I was there the only person who gave a crap and asked if I was ok and asked of I needed more water was the young bus boy!  He had to be 12 years old maybe and had more class and professionalism then everyone combined.

Servers were very friendly and always quick to offer refill on drinks.
Daily dinner specials are offered beginning at 5pm.
We came for brunch as my son and daughter in law treated me and my wife in celebration of Fathers day.
Our table ordered the following;
Chicken fried steak breakfast w/side of pancake
Chicken fried chicken breakfast w/side of biscuit
Chicken and Waffles
Oatmeal w/all the trimmings.

Let's start with the chicken fried breakfast first.
While I didn't get to taste the chicken fried steak,
I was told that it's above average.
I did try the chicken fried chicken.
Very crispy, moist and the gravy (peppery) was the key to this dish.
I didn't care for the biscuit as it wasn't the light and fluffy type that I prefer. 
A little too gummy and dense for my liking.
The side of pancake looked better, although, I didn't get the opportunity to taste it.
Oatmeal that my wife ordered was really good.
Very flavorful when I tasted it plain, but when she added all the goodies, then it became a porridge of sweetness.
My special of the day, Chicken and waffles ...
Waffle was crisp but dense and chewy.
Different then what I prefer but really good.
Chicken was heavy on the batter, very crispy and of the fingers variety.
This place gets very busy so set your expectations accordingly.
Also, when the dining area starts to fill up, it got pretty stuffy/warm in a hurry.

LOL its at the edge of mountains edge and you have to cut across mountain's edge by buffalo and down cactus to the end. If you are in the area or live in the area, its actually not that bad. I live on the west side of town but was in the area for work so decided to meet up with some friends for brunch. 

Decor, outside, looks fairly simple. Inside, the decor is very country style. There are two wall racks of cups. Lots of wooden decor. Tables in the middle and booths along the side. 

You find your own seats. We were greeted fairly fast and were given our drinks (waters lol) quick. 

After referring to yelp the day before, i had noticed a lot of people had recommended the chicken fried steak as well as the biscuits and gravy. Upon reviewing on the menu, the Country Breakfast is the one with a chicken fried steak and smothered country gravy. Biscuits & Gravy has two golden biscuits smothered in homemade country sausage gravy, with homefries or batter fries. Not being too much of a fan of biscuits & gravy, and wanted a more full brunch, so decided to get the country breakfast instead. 

Upon ordering, i was told that the Country Breakfast comes with a side of either toast, or biscuits & gravy and i think there was some other stuff... I didn't hear the rest of it after i heard the biscuits & gravy ! i was like O.O biscuits & gravy ! woo i get to try both ! woo :D 

*edit* LOL so apparently the top of the menu says ""All Two Egg Breakfasts served with HomeFries (Diced Potatoes, Bell Peppers, & Onions) or Batter Fries (Fried Seasoned Potatoes) and a Choice of Toast (Wheat, White, Rye, Sourdough), English Muffin, Biscuit & Gravy, or Hot Cakes... 

Country Breakfast - $9.99 - Chicken Fried Steak, smothered in country gravy, a side of seasoned cubed potatoes, as well as two eggs. And as i had said before, i decided to get the biscuits & gravy for the side. Overall, pretty big portions ! Though i had expected the country fried steak to be bigger (have seen bigger, but whatever and LOL thats what she said XD) ANYWAY... the main attraction of this item. The country fried steak. I would say it is about the size of my hand. About give or take 8-9"" across, covered in gravy XD To my surprise, the chicken is juicy and flavored wonderfully. The batter used reminds me of batter used at popeyes fried chicken batter. Light and super crispy. Overall, a great item and highly recommended. To be honest, prior to this experience, i wasn't too fond of eating a chicken fried steak (maybe bad past experiences? but i dont remember lolol). But this has completely changed my mind XD ! The gravy was a nice creamy sauce, that is not too salty but seasoned nicely. The potatoes are diced are seasoned and cooked with chopped bell peppers and onions. Fairly yummy side. Eggs were cooked to perfection. Perfect over-easy as ordered. Breaking a yolk over the country fried steak adds a nice rich flavor. 

Biscuits & Gravy side - two golden biscuits smothered in homemade country sausage gravy. The  only thing that is different from the normal menu item, is it doesn't come with homefries or batter bites... The biscuits, i dont know if it was because i didn't eat it till the end, but the biscuits not as good as i had hoped for. Biscuits are one of my favorite items in terms of baked goods. The gravy used is made with some uncased sausage. Adds a nice flavor but a little salty, in my opinion, to be eaten alone. Overall, still pretty good. 

Overall, great experience. They are willing to split checks as well. Would love to come back in the future, to try other items on the menu. Though a little out of the way... XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,2,4,Xv57LGlczvr3foD6PY1T2g

Yes, you do seat your self and the wait staff can seem a bit surly but I attribute it to their being busy all the time. Its a small place with nice country ambience but it seems to be bursting at the seams with patrons all the time. I can't blame them for forgetting to smile now and then.

The Families Country Cafe is truly a family affair, with sons, daughters, sister, brothers, mothers and fathers all lending a hand. So even if you're not greeted immediately you will still get that down home feeling.

My favorite meal of the day is breakfast and that is what my wife and I had. I ordered a simple sausage and egg breakfast while my wife got the 2 step breakfast. When my order arrived I was a bit disappointed in the portions but I did not feel that way when I was done. There was plenty to fill my hearty appetite and my wife couldn't even finish hers. The food was delicious, too, by the way, especially the home fries. My sausage links were not the iddy biddy splinters of meat you might get at chain restaurants but were big, juicy and very tasty. Even the toast was superior.

FOOD 
The fried chicken came with mashed potatoes and green beans. I'm usually not a fan of green beans and I finished my vegetables. They have a special seasoning that made me keep on eating. Fried chicken has hints of fried chicken and it definitely hit the spot. I also enjoyed their lemonade. Perfect balance. My friend had their rib eye and she said it was yummy a couple of times during the meal. Her son had the pizza which came with homemade chips that had special seasoning on it too. We all help eat the chips, so good. Everyone at the table also mentioned that the clam chowder was yummy too. 

SERVICE 
The owner/family member took pride in all of their food. Rightfully so. I did enjoy her service, thought it does take a while for her to warm up to you. Our Family's Country Cafe is definitely comfort food at its best. I really felt like there was a grandma back there or eating in someone's home. I look forward to my next visit. 

My friends also mentioned that they enjoy their breakfast menu too.

When we walked in, we were told to take the last table as a party was sitting at the ""last"" table. So we had to figure out the puzzle on our own - still had an open mind. I did observe the people who were probably regular customers being treated like royalty which is a good sign they have a heart somewhere. They knew their names and waited on them hand over fist. It took quite a bit for anyone to take our order or pay us attention. We had to flag someone down to ask who our server was and she was very friendly. Food came out quickly - good. Taste was very good. We never got drink refills or periodic check ups once we were served our food. I will return because it looks like you have to go several times in order to receive decent service. Even my daughter said they aren't very nice here and normally a kid could care less or even notice the service. I think the service flaw was due to lack of organization on the floor.

2) As soon as you step in you feel a nice little comfort about the place. 
3) Seating was quick and painless, we got the last booth and it was busy. 
4) Offered a cinnamon roll, but I wasn't craving, but when people did order them they looked nice and completely fresh out of the oven. 
5) Got our drinks right away. And they topped off our water all the time.
6) Ordered our food. Average wait time for food to come out, it was about 10-15 minutes. 
7) FOOD WAS AMAZING. We both got Chicken Fried Steak with home style potatoes, over medium eggs, AND Biscuits and Gravy for $10.99!!!! Chicken fried steak was soooo crispy and juicy and smothered with their yummy gravy! The batter they used was absolutely delicious. The home style potatoes were well seasoned and had yummy bell peppers mixed in. Perfect over medium egg! THE BISCUITS AND GRAVY THOUGH! That is definitely a reason for you to come in and try this place out. The biscuits were so delicious that they basically melted in your mouth! And you can tell if was fresh (even if it wasn't, it was still amazing) the gravy (same gravy as on the chicken fried steak) was so good with the biscuit! I nearly licked my plate clean! 
8) Bathroom experience was pleasant they really need a deep clean on the tiles, but it was clean, and didn't smell.


Our waitress accidentally charged us for our water, and before we said she already knew she made a mistake and fixed it up right away! So definitely pleased that they care about the service they are giving.

This place is pretty close. It is hard to find good ole country breakfast joints without them Vegasing it out when you are in a big city like Las Vegas but I have to say I am pretty lucky I live down the street from this restaurant. 

I have to say it is kind of a neighborhood place tucked away in small almost none existence shopping center with only a bar right next to it right smack dab in the middle of Mountains edge master community. 

But if you do decide to make an effort it is worth it. Food is good staff is great and price is just right. Oh and if you are a regular being your own mug for you cup of how they will keep it there for you so you can sip from your own favorite cup every time you visit, how cool and homey is that?

I want to give it another star, but the service and quality of my entree prohibits me from doing so.

We entered the restaurant and waited several minutes before we were acknowledged.  OK its Friday night and there are only to two other tables of diners.  We finally got our drink orders by very courteous young man who was efficient.   We were given children's menus also.  

It appeared that our server, Jason, was also one of the owners.  At first I was a bit puzzled (put off) by his demeanor which would be perfectly acceptable at ""Dick's Last Resort"" but here?  I was trying to give him the benefit of a doubt that maybe he has a real dry sense of humor, since he seemed to be well liked by any regular that walked in and he would chat with them quite a bit.  Not sure if he has the ""Diligaf"" attitude also about not trying to make new customers feel just as welcome, but we dd not get that feeling from him.  

Onto the entrees:  I had the fried chicken dinner.  Not bad, the chicken was definitely cooked in oil that was too hot, since the chicken had a dark brown hard crust.  It was bit salty too.  The menu, describes you getting a drumstick, thigh and breast for $10.49.  The pieces of chicken reminded me, size wise, of what you get from a box of Banquet frozen fried chicken in your local grocer's frozen food dept.

My wife ordered the Rib Eye steak sandwich which she enjoyed and would order again.  She thought the macaroni salad was ok and did not finish it.  Jason noticed this when he cleared her plate and asked her in an unpleasant  manner if she thought here was something wrong with his macaroni salad:  she told him no, she was just full from the sandwich.

2138590,2011-12-15,5,fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A,"Very weird place for a restaurant in my opinion... ha. Well, at least for now it is. Before I know it, that whole place will probably be filled with businesses. But, for those of you that want to try it.. I know the address says it's on Rainbow - but Rainbow does not go through all the way yet. So, if you're on Blue Diamond, Get onto Buffalo, turn left at Cactus and go all the way down, and you'll see it on your left. 

I'm not really sure what I was expecting when I walked into the place, but I liked what I saw. The place was decorated with a crap load of Christmas stuff. A little own of miniatures houses and a huge Christmas tree ! I'm not sure how festive the restaurant is on a normal basis, but it looks cute now. 

I really wanted to try this place for two reasons:
1. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF BREAKFAST FOODS !
2. I'm on a mission to find the best Chicken Fried Steak in Vegas. 

The CFS here was good. Almost comparable to my favorite in Vegas so far [Babycakes]. It was good, very good...[not chewy at all!!] but a little too peppery for my taste [not overpowering or anything]. Now, if you're a person who likes pepper, then you'll probably enjoy this. It's safe to say that this is the 2nd best [at least in my opinion] CFS in Vegas. The portion of the CFS is also quite smaller compared to Babycakes, but still big enough to fill you. The gravy was a very nice. Probably the best gravy I've gotten on any CFS. It was rich, thick, and had bits of sausage throughout it. Very, very good ! 

I ordered the scrambled eggs with my CFS, as well as the battered potatoes. The scrambled eggs were underwhelming. Well seasoned, but definitely overcooked. Potatoes were good. I'm not a big potato fan at all, but I actually ate quite of few of their potatoes. They were nice and crispy.

I'm excited to go back and try the rest of the offerings.  The service could have been better, but it wasn't quite bad enough to knock this review down to four stars.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,8,7,5,GUxa1Dhl6zC_EwKj083MkA

The home fries DEFINITELY came from a frozen bag.  We could tell because they had 3-4 random bits of veggies included, and the chunks were seasoned perfectly even.  My wife described her sausage patties as being ""soggy"" (frozen food cooked incorrectly)

Been here three times and it's amazing every time. Definitely an amazing place and the only reason why it's not 5 is because I've gone twice and they've been so busy they were once out of country fried steak, and the second out of beef barley soup. But we did get samples which made us want it even more. 

From what I've had it's completely homemade deliciousness. The biscuits and gravy are mouthwatering. Rich and creamy. The burgers are made with lots of spices and you can taste the meat. Idk how to explain it but it's the rarest occurrence that I had only experienced once before. 

I'm not a big drink type f person but I love their sweet tea. It reminds me of mcdonalds sweet tea ad my husband loved their lemonade. I hate lemonade and it tasted surprisingly similar to raisin canes lemonade.

Best part?! They are linked to a bar. Yep, have dinner and head to the bar. The waitress even said we could leave our car and we are close enough to walk home. The restaurant is warm an cozy, grandma style and the bar side is the crazy whiskey side.

She had so much attitude, she definitely needs an attitude adjustment. Then, it took so long to get our food. Eventhough they were busy, it took FOREVER to get our food.

We came on a Monday night. About five other tables were occupied. I know some of you had mentioned about spotty/bad service but our experience was anything BUT that. Our waitress and busboy were attentive and friendly. 

Originally, I opted for the cowboy burger but that chicken fried steak just looked too good. It comes with your choice of soup or salad. My soup for the night was potato soup. And waitress claimed their ranch dressing is homemade. I'm not sure about my potato soup though. It was good and it wasn't salty at all...which I like. 

The chicken fried steak was wow!!!! It came out pippin hot. Crisp to perfection on the outside but moist and tender on the inside. It was topped with some creamy country gravy.

2612945,2016-02-07,2,fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A,"My husband and I wanted to try something different and we stumbled upon this restaurant. 

The restaurant is pretty small from where we were sitting and I also found out that they have a bar as well! It's homey with lots of country decor and mugs all over the place.

Upon sitting down, a homemade fresh cinnamon roll was offered to us and you could tell it was homemade! Delicious!!!! We ordered our meals and drinks and it came pretty quickly.

My husband and I weren't too impressed with the food- we got a country nacho plate because we are obsessed with nachos and a meat burrito that had a few varieties of meat in it. The picture of the nachos looked better than it tasted. It basically had regular tortilla chips, sprinkled shredded cheese that looked microwaved, a mix of country white gravy with chicken fried steak and jalapeños, sour cream and salsa. Nothing too spectacular but I think the shredded cheese didn't so anything. For the nachos, If you're looking for something cheesy, this isn't it. The burrito was good, a good size for 2 people and it's very filling. It had chunks of ham, steak strips and chicken. Their home fries are delicious, so I recommend getting that as well!

All in all, I think we will come back and try the breakfast menu instead of the nachos.",rqb5abV146wcU-Z7JxfEIQ,2,2,3,_XZFCKyFICdjk0HFEIUrWQ

Rainbow dead ends at Mountain's Edge Parkway so you have to get on Buffalo and take a left on Cactus to get there. They're located within the Mountain's Edge community at the corner of Cactus and where Rainbow will eventually continue (right now it's just a dirt road).

The restaurant is relatively small but the interior has a cozy, old-school country feel to it. Something along the lines of Cracker Barrel (for those familiar w/ that east coast restaurant chain), but on a much smaller scale. If the name of the place sounds familiar it's because the owner used to own a place in north vegas with the same name. He sold it 2 years ago and opened this place earlier this year.

As for the food, I came here for lunch and had the country fried steak sandwich. It was a huge serving -- lightly fried and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It was served on a toasted bun, smothered in gravy and topped with onions and lettuce. I haven't had a country fried steak in years, but this was as good as any I remember. The fries it came with were big cuts, again perfectly fried making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Cost: $5.99 with tax

There was no wait staff, just the owner and his wife (I think) working the place. He stopped by a couple times to chat and check to see if I needed anything else. He seemed like a really nice guy. Hopefully they'll get enough business from the surrounding neighborhood to stay in business a while. 

Their prices are very reasonable. $6-8 for sandwiches, $8-12 for entrees. They're open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,1,3,4,9BNHlYAqqJylgiz47P_JoQ

The waitress just stared at us when we walked in. I said, ""Do we just seat ourselves?"" She responded, ""Well that's what the sign says."" Obviously I didn't read the sign if I asked the question, but she didn't need to be sarcastic about it. Maybe they should have a recorded message that says, ""Please seat yourself"" when you walk in the door, since they get irritated when people ask. It took us about 15 SECONDS to find a table and sit because I couldn't decide if I wanted something by the window, a 2 seat table, or a 4 seat table. I didn't think that was long at all, but when the waitress came up to us with our menus, she said, ""Wow, I didn't realize finding a table was so hard."" Then she took our drink orders (coffee and water). The coffee was $1.55 with unlimited refills. When she came back, we both ordered veggie omelets ($7.75 ea.)

The veggies omelets were average. I just found it weird that they put whole slices of tomatoes in the center (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eDX3TWDnGMXq4hXmwgBkJg/l.jpg).  The coffee was very good though and I got about 3 refills. 

Overall, I don't think I'd come back here even though I live a couple miles away. I just don't like the service and the food is just mediocre. If the waitress was completely quiet the whole time, it would've been better.

3018309,2014-04-11,5,fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A,"One big thing that I've noticed since my initial visit to this establishment is that the customer service has steadily declined.  Don't get me wrong, the food's great, but the people that work at this restaurant are the most miserable people I've ever met.  

To speak from a previous experience, the woman that waits tables is loud and obnoxious.  At one point, my friend ate her meal but left the vegetables on her plate as she didn't enjoy that particular vegetable (they rotate which veggie they serve on a nightly basis).  One of the perks of being a self sustaining adult is that if you don't want to eat something on your plate, you won't be sent to bed without dessert.  She noticed that there was food still on the plate, picked it up and loudly said, ""uh, you didn't touch your vegetables.  Is there something wrong with them?""  Seriously, unless my friend is also your daughter, calm down! 

Honestly, I didn't expect anything different from last night as this has been the habit recently, but I can't believe we were actually given worse.  In all reality, I have to admit that I can't believe there was a worse to give, but if you can expect anything out of the staff of this restaurant, it's that they will let you know when they're in bad moods, take it out on the customers and make you feel as uncomfortable as possible in the process.

First off, we didn't get our drink orders placed until we'd already been seated for ten minutes and the drinks tasted flat.  The problem was that we were barely checked on during our visit, so explaining that the drinks tasted horrible wasn't going to happen.

Second, my friend ordered a salad to start her meal off.  Let me explain, first, that to this restaurant, a salad consists of a plate of mixed lettuce with a chopped tomato and dressing.  When it was brought out to our table, the waiter acted like he was in such a rush that he just sorta threw it at my friend and left before it had even finished sliding across the table to her.  She took, maybe, two bites and didn't finish it.  Once again, nobody noticed or cared that it barely got touched.

Finally, I wish I could circumvent my rant about their horrible customer service with how great our meal tasted, but we never actually received our meal.  We waited for forty five minutes in vain.  This restaurant was hardly busy and the main server was fiddling with the register for a good ten minutes before I got fed up and walked over to them to hand them my debit card so that we could at least pay for our drinks.  When I got up there and told that man that we wanted to leave, he responded with, ""are you sure?  Your food's ready.""  HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?!  You've been standing in the same viewable spot for ten minutes!!  Has it been ready that entire time but fixing the register trumped your customers?!

I won't be back.  With the rate of decline on their service, I shudder to think of what I'd be subjected to next, especially since I'm paying them for my meal and experience.  Honestly, who would actually continue to endure that kind of crap at their own monetary and time expense?  Not me.  Also, not the people that I associate with.

I went here because I really wanted breakfast and we went with a place with higher star rating and 100+ reviews.

First we walked in, the place was pretty nice.  We stood at the front for at least 10 minutes before any employee acknowledged us. We got a table and were seated. The person who sat us seemed to be grumpy having a bad day. They didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink.  We got our drinks, the person spilled the orange juice and looked at us like it was our fault. We had to ask if we could order. Once we ordered, we got no acknowledgement until I asked for a refill.

I asked how long our food would take at about 40 minutes of waiting. I was snapped at because they had too many orders from the bar. This should not be our problem. We didn't go to the bar next door. It took about 50 minutes to get our food. I was really looking forward to it. The bacon crumbled every time I bit into it. Not really what I like. I can go on and one about what I didn't like. The sausage was pretty over cooked.

My wife ordered French toast, which was very good.

Not going to lie this was a little hard to find due to the gps being weird and google maps placing it where it wasn't but once found it certainly is a treasure.  You want to go ahead and take buffalo instead of rainbow due to construction.  Once this place is settled I have no doubt that I'm going to have to wait in line for this place.

Once I found the place and stepped inside the decorations were very very nice.  What I would expect from a country cafe.  A very quiet place.  I came with a friend and we were the only ones in the place, which is definitely a nice change from the bustle that I am used to.  

Once seated the menu was right there waiting for us.  Good layout of the menu and pretty decent sized lettering which made it very clear what you were reading.  The menu was also decorated like in the westerns with letters misspelled or even missing but you can obviously tell that it was done on purpose.

I had read on here that this place had bomb country fried steak so I of course had to try it out.  It was surprisingly good.  Not what I had expected at all.  Even writing this now my mouth is watering because I remembered how delicious it was.  The steak was a hearty slab that was in fact very tender.  The gravy was so smooth yet thick and flavorful just like what you would expect from that specific gravy.  Indeed one of the best I have had.  Compliments to the chef.  The portion was pretty big as well.  My friend got the hungry farmer and the bacon strips were huge.  The biggest I have seen and was very impressed.

The owner was definitely a nice guy.  He even admits he's a little sarcastic but definitely a good guy.  If you can't take a little poking then maybe you might want to come back when the roads are finished and has more staff on hand.

This is a place that I see myself being a regular at.

Our Families Country Cafe is a little breakfast place attached to the side of a local Bar. One unique aspect of this hidden gem is that you can leave a coffee mug at the restaurant and grab it on your next visit when you sit down. It's nothing major, but it adds to that ""at home"" feeling.

The food is awesome! They use the good patty breakfast sausage that isn't too fatty and has good flavor. The steak is perfect, the bacon is crispy, the French toast is sweet and delectable, and the biscuits and gravy are addicting! Everything you get for the price is amazing! Even if you order to go, it'll be ready faster than you expect; I've never been disappointed. 

The only real negative is the location. For me, it's not too difficult to commute, but unless you live in Mountain's Edge or Southern Highlands, this place is REALLY out of the way. Although, I don't necessarily mind that, because the less busy, the more I can enjoy!

Famous for the country fried steak so both of us ordered that and were very impressed with the taste and portion size. Good ol country gravy over real mashed potatoes. Mm mm good.

Then we were in the mood for the home made desserts and those were awesome too. Had the peach cobbler first and then we decided to try the strawberry shortcake too. YUM O

Very nice waitress named Lee. She has been back with them just a few weeks but worked for them at their previous locations so you might know her from those. Sorry to hear some folks didn't have that same great service but Lee will give it to you so give em another chance.

*Personal opinion - Can be interesting if you look a little different.... My friend and I are both fully sleeved (tattoos) and I never have a ""normal"" hair color (style most times, color never).  We don't have anything offensive tattoo-wise, but seem to draw alot of stares or consternation from both staff and patrons depending on the day.  They always seem to be surprised that we act like normal people.  I do expect that to some degree but it can be a little unnerving at this place. It's not ALWAYS like this, but it's happened quite a few times.

Classic America fare (country food).  Food has been consistently good.  Service is another story entirely.  It ranges from great to ""why did this person even bother coming to work today"".

Pros:  Good food and super large drinks  
Good prices
Large portions
Good location for Mountain's Edge/Southern Highlands.  Not hard to find since they have signage everywhere directing you to the spot.
Connected to a Bounty Hunter should you want to partake in the spirits
Large lot for parking
Have a copy of the current newspaper available at front to peruse at your table for free

Cons - Inconsistent service
Have had takeout a few times and have never had one order that didn't have something missing

Grown up in Texas for 35 years we know how it should be.  Fresh cubed tenderized steak that should be dredged in flour with buttermilk sometimes twice before frying.

I waited to write a review because I wanted to try the chicken fried steak for myself. I love crispy, and this batter was one of the best! I chose over easy egg, potatoes and pancakes instead of the hash browns and biscuit. I like that the gravy was not too rich or heavy. The first time I came here, I had the breakfast sandwich with hash browns and it was ok but didn't rock my world - same for the coffee. From my picture, it looks like the hash browns are burnt, but they didn't taste burnt.

But what stands out to me are the people who work there. The first time, we chatted with the owner a bit who was quite personable. This second time, one of our servers was so chatty and made us laugh with his storytelling skills!

I've been coming here for years and would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good ol' American food that's hearty and full of flavor. 

My favorite dishes: 

Wednesday Roasted Pork dinner special: The pork is tender and fatty! Tastes great with the homemade mashed potatoes and gravy made from drippings. Green beans on the side are sometimes overcooked but it's still good. I always make sure to get extra butter for my dinner roll on the side. 

Country Nachos: a must try! It's huge so you can enjoy it as an appetizer or share w/ a friend.

Country Fried Steak - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, delicious all around! Get it w/ the pancakes or French Toast. Home fries are my go-to over hashbrowns for all breakfast items, which is served all day! 

Everything else you can think of. Haven't had a bad meal here yet. It's all affordable with large portions. We always take home leftovers because the entrees are that BIG! 

They offer daily dinner specials and other deals on their social media. Breakfast is served all day so you can enjoy brinner any day of the week :-D Excellent brunch spot w/ the girls and there's a bar next door so you can stop there for drinks and play the slots.

Huge shout out to the staff! They always make us feel like family when we come here, which makes the entire dining experience so much better. They're a hard-working bunch and their efforts pay off since they're always so busy too!

I felt guilty taking up a four top dining alone but this is a relatively small place with no counter and no two tops.  I was brought coffee quickly.  They offer you Half and Half in flavors but since I drink my coffee black, that's nice to have available but it doesn't affect me.

I ordered the Wisconsin Omelette with rye toast and batter bites for my potato.  The omelette was OK but all I saw and tasted was some sliced cheddar like I'd buy in a big bag at any grocery.  There was no pepper jack nor Swiss cheese that I could discern.  Had I read the menu a little more carefully, I wouldn't have been disappointed by the batter bites.  Look at the words and what do you think?  The batter bites were in fact home fries.  There's no batter to them.  The menu describes them as fried seasoned potatoes.  I was thinking of something more in the tater tot line but that was not the case.

My coffee was refilled without asking and there were always servers going around asking about refills.  I hurried to finish because the place was getting busy again and I wanted to let someone with a larger party have the table.

An OK place but not a return to place.  It's out of the way for me and just not worth it.

That being said.....THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS. Well worth the confusion!

I had the Two Step Breakfast (2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausages, and choice of 2 pancakes or toast) $7.75. Hubby had the very delicious biscuits and gravy. Both were served with ""batter bites"" crispy, well flavored potato nuggets of bliss. 

The waitress was super nice. I would love to go back soon since I noticed there was fresh baked pie on the menu. She even said they deliver. Check out their website!

My only star knock off is the fact that they inundate you with country music. Ok, I know the restaurant has ""country"" in it's name, but I really do not appreciate the twang.

The home fries were so incredibly salty it made our mouths burn and we couldn't eat them. The hot cakes had a rubbery texture and much like the biscuits and gravy, didn't taste homemade.

Moving on to our two eggs over easy--one of the eggs had a busted yoke so it was cooked through in the center. The cook artfully disguised his mistake with extra salty home fries--which I want to note I didn't order. I asked for the fried potatoes. The fried potatoes were also crazy salty and couldn't be eaten.

Lean cuisines. Dog food. Cat food. Bird seed. The cold, sad, vomited remains of a Little Caesar's Hot-N-Ready. All things I would rather EAT than ever even have to LOOK at the slop they charged $40+ to serve us. I honestly don't know how this place is still standing!! Maybe they actually serve secret edible food to the ""regulars?""

Appalling service, as others have mentioned. Disgusting, bland, straight from the box/can/freezer but still takes 45 minutes to get on your table and served cold. My boyfriend ordered a steak and I think I had chicken? With green beans (canned)? Idk. Was that gravy? I'm still trying to figure it out!

Plus every time we tried to order something (that was ON the menu) on a TUESDAY night (we were the only customers in there), the ""waitress"" just said ""we don't have that."" 
""We're all out."" 
""The blender is broken."" 
""Trust me you don't NEED steak sauce for this steak."" (Because they don't have any.)

And I had to write quotations around the word ""waitress"" because it'd be laughable and insulting to other servers to call someone who flings plates on your table, then the check, without more than two words-- a ""waitress.""

It was ridiculous. I'm not a good cook, but I am somehow capable of ""cooking"" canned vegetables and frozen meat better than they do. And I don't buy groceries often, but I actually have more options in my pantry than they have in their ""cafe.""

It's so sad, because with this huge population living in Mountain's Edge, we have THIS as our only option. I was hoping we would eat here once a week at LEAST! I drove home with my boyfriend feeling like a prostitute-- cheap, used, near-vomiting for being forced to swallow that, a bit dizzy, and wondering ""how did I just get royally f***ed that hard, and what can I do about it?""

Facility:  This is a med size restaurant that has tables and chairs, and booths along the wall. It has a cafe/small restaurant feel. It also shares the building with a Tavern next door, but since it was Sat afternoon, we will skip the booze. LOL! 

Service: When you walk in there is a sign that says wait to be seated. We stood waiting as we saw 3 different wait staff look at us, but not acknowledge us. After a few minutes, we discussed leaving and where else we wanted to go, and finally one of the wait staff came over...just in time too. He explained that they are a family place, and used to repeat customers. Their usuals know to just grab a seat in one of the booths, unless they have a big party. Um...ok. 
Now besides this first bad impression, I actually loved the service and the staff. They are a family spot, with Dad in the back cooking, brother (Jason) running things, and the sister (Kyla - ?... Sorry, I forgot) and nephew serving. And, they were all friendly and helpful when they came to our table...even Jason, who doesn't really smile. That's the family joke. LOL! 
So, we were told they used to be located up North and then relocated to the Southwest for a better location. 

Food: the offer a cinnamon roll to start, but I'm not a fan, so I skipped this. Jason told me that have Chicken fried steak comparable to the South. So, being the Southern gal I am, who can resist anything fried and smothered in gravy, I was sold. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak dinner 4/5 with mashed potatoes, roll and fried creamed corn aka corn fritter.  It was good, he was right about that. I've had better in Louisiana, but this is probably some of the best you'll get in Las Vegas!

Overall:  I liked this spot. I like the family part of the restaurant. I liked the staff and service was good. And I really liked the food. Just sucks it's in the Southwest. Still, I'll come back someday. :)",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,3,4,aqU9rrewu6r7s3qone0AUQ

She gave me a dirty look and said ""I gave you unsweetened"". I said oh simple mistake but it's very sweet, I cannot have sugar, may I get another?.

4818596,2013-03-24,2,fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A,"03/23/13 DINNER

I was tempted to give this place only 1 star, but since the owner/server was a nice guy, I went with 2 stars.

On 02/27/12 spouse and I had dinner here. We brought a GROUPON along, and as it turned out, it was worth the long drive and price for what we had. Spouse really liked the chicken fried chicken.

So a few months ago a repeat of the GROUPON was offered. I got one.

Well, we were extremely disappointed this time. It had a few ups, but mostly downs.

We came this night for their announced Saturday night special, which I will copy verbatim from their Facebook page: IT'S SATURDAY MARCH 23rd AND....TODAY'S SPECIAL IS....ROASTED TURKEY BREAST WITH DARRELL'S HOMEMADE CORNBREAD STUFFING (THIS IS DELISH!!) SERVED WITH FRESH MASHED POTATOES AND GRAVY(made from the drippings mm mm good) VEGETABLE, DINNER ROLL AND CHOICE OF HOMEMADE SOUP OR CRISP GREEN SALAD!!!

We arrived. I saw a sign at the front door announcing ""Saturday & Sunday only, check in with Facebook and get unlimited mimosas for $10 or half priced bloody marys"". I said to myself, Why Not?, and proceeded to check in. I showed my phone to the owner/server (Darrell?), and he said ""Oh, that's only offered at brunch, and as I don't own the bar, I can't make that offer for dinner."" It's a tavern with him (Darrell?) subleasing the restaurant side of the building. That's fair enough. (It's similar to what Carluccio's did, moving from the Liberace center to a Henderson tavern.) But he (Darrell?) proceeded to bring us a free basket of fried mozzarella sticks, which was very nice of him (Darrell?), and were actually pretty good.

We got the bloody marys after all, and it was one of the worst I've ever had. Why? For one, my olive was previously attacked by a bug (no lie, a chunk bit out of it, obviously insect-eaten) and the cocktail tasted metallic. I probably should've returned it, but then there were those free moz sticks, sitting there...

After ordering said Saturday night special, next up were cup of soup or salad. I got the homemade chili, which was good. Spouse got the salad, and was quite happy. It even had dandelion greens. In the 2.25 years of living here in Vegas I don't think we've seen those in a salad. (Was it a packaged salad? If it was, it was surprising.)

But then the main course comes. It was not turkey BREAST, it was turkey LOAF. Lots of white and grey-dark meat, sliced from a loaf, perfectly circular, falling to pieces. It was OK, but it wasn't anything special, or worth the price charged. And the ""veg"", the green beans, we forgot about this part from the last visit, they were sadly canned. Remaining was some cranberry sauce (OK, likely canned, no problem), the potatoes (a small scoop of homemade, these were good), the dressing (also seemed homemade, good) and the gravy (which I think wasn't from ""drippings"" because the last time I cooked a turkey loaf I don't recall all that many drippings, so we think it was bottled/packaged). The dinner roll was a version of texas toast, no garlic, just a grilled roll.

Didn't order the homemade, just out of the oven, peach cobbler, offered by the owner/server (Darrell?). We promptly left after dinner. A lot of the turkey loaf came home for the kitties.

If I hear they've improved, we might again make the trip out there. But I doubt that will happen.

PS One other problem. We arrived to find a couple of uncontrolled kids running around the VERY SMALL restaurant, at times screaming. It continued throughout most of our visit. I guess the word ""Families"" in the name of the place should've been a clue of the possibility of an undesired child ""carnival"", supplied by their uncaring-of-other-patrons parents. (At the same age as those kids, if I had behaved that way in a restaurant with my Navy Commander father at the table, I would've been beaten to a pulp.

Pros: Food was very good, big portions. Food came out pretty quick, drinks always full. Staff was very friendly, you could tell there were a lot of regulars there because they were really buddy buddy with a few tables. It truly is family owned and family run, which is nice.

Cons: Terrible location, hard to find and not near anything. Inconsiderate jerk smokers right outside the front entrance when the door was open, made the whole place stink, I had to say something before they closed the door but the damage had already been done. Place is kind of small so I imagine there would be a long wait during busy times.

 I'm a very picky person when it comes to eating out and this place on my first visit had me doubting. But man did they come through, its a small place which gives it a nice warm feeling. The decorator needs a nice round of applause also. 

Once you find it ( take your time ) its a small treasure. The owner can at first seem a bit on the rough side but he truly cares and will fire sarcasm right back at you. 

The drinks are huge and they wont go empty on you. They have very well put together menu for all three meal times. And there nightly specials are a great deal.

 Its clean and has a tunnel ( ok hallway ) the the bar next door which they often run drink specials with.

 I have been several times now and had a good sampling of the menu i have yet to find anything I did not like. And if you ask real nice they will bring you a sample of the sides if your not sure about them.  I took my granddaughter with me a few times she is only 10 months but I was surprised to find they have baby spoons available if you forget yours.. how cool is that. 

Now a secret well ok not a huge one But they close at 9pm, But the menu is still available till 2am at the bar next door, good thing for those late night munchies.

 If you haven't been then its worth a trip there, but if your looking for one of those places where they kiss your butt you wont find it.. Grab your own table and enjoy.",r2wK-bxWTIRTupmbOcrEWg,1,0,5,yL5HLcG6pcW0TXcXZFq66g
4957990,2013-08-26,0,fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A,"We went to Country Café on a Monday very late morning, nearly 11 am.  As many note, it's NOT on Rainbow, despite what the address indicates.  You need to take Buffalo, then turn left on Cactus.  Then, it's up on the right where the road dead ends.  Why they have a Rainbow address when Rainbow isn't completed is beyond me.  Depending on where you live in the Valley, it's a trek to get to Country Café.  We live well into Hendertucky, so it was quite a drive for us.  But, it was worth it.  

I had the chicken fried steak sandwich, I wanted to order the dinner plate, but the mashed potatoes weren't ready yet.  That was a little frustrating since we ordered after 11 am, but you gotta love that they are making them.  Sometimes homemade food just isn't ready when you want it.  So, I had the sandwich, which comes with lettuce, onion, pickles and gravy with a side of fries.  I didn't care for the lettuce on the sandwich.  The fries were large and very crispy.  Sort of a beer batter breading, thicker than usual.  I really liked them, and you get quite an order.  The chicken fried steak was excellent.  I'd read that it was the best in town and it lived up to the billing.  It's certainly the best chicken fry I've had in Vegas.  The sandwich basically fell apart as I was eating it, so I finished with a fork.  Can't wait to return to get the dinner.

The wife had chili and a grilled cheese.  These were both standard, but the chili lacked heat in a big way.  We tried the fried creamed corn bites, and they were fantastic.  Excellent breading, and you could taste the corn, not just breading flavor.  Excellent.

Service was very friendly and prompt.  We will definitely return despite the long distance from our house.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,4,0,4,4R1WxE5t9B-uzVzB3zx5KQ

We were there on a Sunday morning and thought there'd be a busy rush but there were only 3-4 tables there while we ate. Despite it not being busy, we counted at least 10 employees. Also, 'our families' implies more than one but it's only one family so it should be 'our family's'? I asked about who the 'families plural' are and was told 'we consider everyone who comes to be family, so it's everyone's families place'. Mmhmm. Anywho, the food is good and portions good sized. Boyfriend got a meal and a coke, I got a small sized version of a meal and water and it was $30. That seems a bit much, but, like I said the food was good, so, at least that money is supporting a local, family place. I just hope an ihop or Denny's doesn't open nearby or else I fear they'd go under. I think my favorite thing was that the breakfast ham was grilled. Everywhere else I've had breakfast ham it's griddle/skillet cooked. Here it's grilled and has the lines and tastes a tiny bit like grill char.

The food came out fast, we waited about 10 mins till it came to our table. I read other reviews about people waiting longer.

Honestly, it was a little overdone. The place looked so cluttered with decorations, it was almost overkill. 

The coffee was decent, and food was alright, nothing spectacular. The service is why this is only getting 3 stars, and not 4... it was HORRIBLE. Our server came over to our table and seemed like she was in a rush - except there were only 3 other tables there. She took our order so quick and abrupt that it was almost like if you didn't have a quick answer for her, she would yell at you! She never explained the difference between batter bits and home fries, so we each just got one. She never came back to ask us how we were doing, until the end of the meal when she handed us our check.

I ordered chicken fried steak, and my man got the pork chops with eggs. Both were good... like I said before, nothing out of the ordinary, and definitely not bad, just not memorable. Also, the only difference between the batter bites, and home fries was with or without peppers and onions. And WHY are they called batter bites anyways?? Makes it seem like it should be pancakes, or something with BATTER not potatoes with peppers/onions. 

This place has so much potential, but it's just missing the mark. Get better service, and de-clutter your brand new restaurant, and maybe it would be more inviting, and make us want to come back.",6gb0T4_MngSXukRUbIMEfQ,6,1,3,j-QXIYcWr6965oYxoTTKkQ

I didn't mind the zig-zagging through neighborhoods to find them, I actually enjoyed the scavenger hunt. (Kudos to the person who thought of putting signs out on the road guiding lost people to your restaurant!)

My issue came at the time sat ourselves down to order. We weren't welcomes by a hostess (you seat yourself) but our waiter didn't come by for a good 5 mins and the place only had 4-5 busy tables. When he did show up, he didn't even look at us directly. He asked for our orders like we were his construction buddies and annoyed with us dinning there. Exact words ""what will have today"".. last time I checked this was not polite. I wasn't done with placing my order and he moved onto my girlfriend to place her order. I interrupted him as he started walking away to ask for a side item (which showed up on my friends plate when we got our food). 

Little things matter Country Cafe. As simply as being welcoming a guest into an establishment goes a long way. Your place is grandma's house cute, but the food was ok and the service we sub par. Maybe you should target construction workers not families and neighbors as your customer base. Or better yet, get rid of the tall, 230 lb, dark haired waiter and hire a well-mannered person with some hospitality skills to replace him.

The staff are very attentive and friendly! We ended up ordering the Country Fried steak and my son and I shared the French Toast platter. The portions are huge and everything was flavorful. The mimosa was made strong, as it should be. Hehe. We also made a last minute decision of ordering the Apple pie. Seriously, the best apple pie I ever had! Soooo delicious!

Another really cool thing about this place is they offer toys and a bunch of crayons for kids...I love this idea so much, anything to keep my son from his iPad!

* Food: In one word, amazing! Everything is made from scratch and has a very nice taste to it. We tried the sliders, fried chicken and soup and everything was tasty and filling! Oh, and if you visit do NOT leave without trying their peach cobbler...it is awesome.

* Service (the reason I did not give it 5 stars): AWFUL!!!!!!!! The guy who was waiting tables clearly did not want to be there. This person did not offer a smile, was pretty short with every question we asked. He seemed bothered by me asking for extra condiments and rarely checked in with us. THIS IS A GREAT RESTAURANT BUT YOU NEED FRIENDLY STAFF!!!!!!

* Overall experience: Pretty good. I wil definitely visit again and try other menu items. One thing though, and I cannot stress this enough...I HOPE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT SERVER WHEN I GO THERE AGAIN.

Conclusion: Definitely try this place!",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,1,0,4,Giev7ycHJ2kDL8Gu38-4zA
5361257,2011-07-15,2,fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A,"**Summary**
       - Taste - The rib-eye steak sandwich was pretty good, but their BBQ burger is what will keep me coming back. Also, their seasoned fries were delicous too.
       - Service - It might be because we came in after a group of 12, but it took an hour for us to order and get our food.
       - Location - It's pretty hard to find. The address on google maps points you elsewhere. If you go east from Buffalo Dr and Cactus Ave, it's where the road ends.
**Ordered**
       - $8.95 Rib-Eye Steak Sandwich - Steak was a little thin, but very flavorful (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A?select=lXru8IuEhgR41KQtOa0Dow).
       - $7.99 Cowboy Burger - One of the best BBQ burgers I've ever had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A?select=7I90Agn0u79pvZ34qr7lbg).
**Recommendations**
       - I've yet to taste their entree meals, but from what I've had already, this place is definitely worth trying.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,8,6,4,NoLIqXJ5j-ZIDi7pfTxwZg

I got the Honey Stung Fried Chicken, it wasn't the best fried chicken but it was tasty and not at all greasy. I wasn't a big fan of their mashed potatoes (could they be instant-maybe?). The roll was tasty. I also got a cup of their Cream of Chicken Soup...wow! this stuff is good. I'd go back just for the soup!
My husband got the Rib Eye Sandwich with Fries. The sandwich was good, no grisle like you get in some steaks. The fries were also good, I stole my share from his plate!

I truly want to give this restaurant a single star. Unfortunately, the food doesn't merit that, as the food was better then you would expect. The truth is the service was so horrible that if the food had been flawless I would still give them two stars.

From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we were treated as though we were a definite burden. Our waiter (who may have also been the cook) was put out by every request.  He was cold, rolled his eyes consistently, and was extremely short. 

The bus boy attempted to do a good job, but it was clear he was burnt out. The only positive thing I can say about our service was that our food came out correctly, and the waiter was competent.

At the end of the day if you only go to restaurants for sustenance and service is irrelevant to you then I suppose you might enjoy yourself. If you care about receiving good, friendly service I would highly recommend going elsewhere.",rgLBQ5jdRJ7gpZwp-aQqZw,2,1,2,Zwh8r7tq7k3f7k1iuojvug

Take Rainbow, take a right on Blue Diamond, then take a left on Buffalo, and finally turn left on Cactus. The restaurant will be located on the right at the end of the street.

My boyfriend read good reviews about the country fried steak and wanted to try it. After reading the menu, I ended up getting the country fried chicken because I was craving fried chicken. My boyfriend ordered the special, which was half a rack of ribs. 

Our orders came with clam chowder, and I must say it was pretty tasty. It was a bit on the salty side, but that might have been because of the delicious pieces of bacon in it. 

The country fried chicken was fried to perfection! Battered just right, nice and juicy inside, and covered in gravy. Honestly the best I have ever had. The ribs were fall off the bone soft, with just the right amount of sauce. My boyfriend ordered battered cream corn for one of his sides, and it was interesting. Tasty but a tad bit dry. 

Definitely recommend trying this place, especially if you live around Mountain's Edge. My boyfriend normally doesn't care much for this type of food, but he was impressed with it and so was I.

It was not easy getting here either since Rainbow street was blocked off and we had to drive around it.  I think the only other establishment in this center is the bar next door.  
So I ordered the 2 pork chops with scrambled eggs, hash browns, biscuits and gravy.  Yes thats right folks, this is all part of the order for $12.79.  The biscuits & gravy was very good and the gravy was nice and thick.  Definitely not bland, but not the best I've had either.  The pork chops was the main feature here.  It was boneless and juicy.  It's nice that I didn't have to cut around the bone.  Grilled and seasoned with pepper and salt.  The has browns was nothing special.  But good though.  
One thing to keep in mind is that when you sit down, the server will ask you if you want to get started with a cinnamon roll.  Just remember that this roll is not complimentary and costs $2.99.  I wished the server would have explained that to us.  The way he said it made me think that it was complimentary.  Too good to be true.  It smelled great and fresh out of the oven soft, but not the greatest and definitely not worth $2.99.  
If you plan on getting their sweet tea or soda, keep in mind that it comes in a very large cup.  But the good thing is if you don't finish it, you can ask for a to go cup.",WpCqwLoXyRL8Yx0NbPzxDw,0,0,4,7AZK_GpmnyA5P6UiISIA5A

Our party ranged in ages from 10-90. Although the restaurant doesn't take reservations, I called ahead for the large party and for handicap/elderly accommodations. On a Sunday? For 10:30am? The gentleman on the phone obliged and we had reservations for the restaurant, on a Sunday at 10:30am!!!!

We arrived, and there was no out of the ordinary fan fare going on. It was a quaint little restaurant, with booths on the right side, and several tables. My family that was in town wanted to buy some of their decorations. :D It's a country cafe, and it is great. 

Food started out with a couple of warm and delicious cinnamon rolls with a regular pastry glaze. Not too sweet, just perfect. They were so soft! A great little breakfast appetizer, if you will.

Although we waited for our food for quite a while, we were a large party, it was definitely worth the wait. There servers were friendly and worked efficiently. Our cups of coffee, soda, and sweet ice tea never went dry. 

Bottom line: We will be back. Sooner, rather than later, I hope. 

Thank you to the owners of ""Our Families Country Cafe"" for sharing your wonderful food and bringing a quaint cafe to the neighborhood.",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,0,0,5,FZojuSE1G43cAUKBqShsKQ

Made a third and final trip back hoping for a better experience...but was def not the case. The service was beyond slow.

5813285,2017-07-31,0,fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A,"Definitely give this place a shot for comfort food and breakfast!
The seating area is very small, sporting a kind of midwestern/country '90s vibe reminiscent of my childhood. In addition, it is made even more intimate by the close proximity and small curtain which separates the kitchen and the dining area. It really feels as if you're invited over to dine in the home of the owning family. 
The service is incredibly friendly and attentive, and the food has never failed me once in the many times I've ordered to-go or came in around brunch hours. Their country gravy is the best I've had in town, the corned beef hash crispy, the potatoes always perfect and the portions huge. There are healthy substitutes if you're not feeling like such a heavy meal, and they have creative/unique options like the ""Country Nachos"": sporting a country gravy instead of cheese 
With the great prices on top of all of the above mentioned, I have yet to find a single thing I don't love about this place.",h1_dtTGShzrIG9a3MB-ptw,0,0,5,GT_xeBV6Q818uv_RpZZEew

5837357,2011-09-29,2,fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A,"We used a Groupon on the way to southern California, and were glad to be introduced to a fine restaurant with which we were previously unfamiliar. The atmosphere inside is nice and homey, with comfortable seating at tables or booths. It reminded me of a warm country cafe. Artificial but colorful flowers abound. 

I began with a bowl of the soup of the day, which was Creamy Chicken Soup that, besides a creamy chicken broth and hand-cut pieces of white chicken, contained pieces of celery and carrots. Unfortunately, the strong flavor of these particular carrots dominated the taste of the dish. It was good but served warm rather than hot, and was just too carrot-intensive for my palate. Garlic bread actually consisted of dinner rolls that had been cut in half and treated with garlic butter. These altered bread products struck me as neither fish nor fowl, and just did not satisfy. I would have greatly preferred pure dinner rolls or crisp slices of garlic bread rather than the hybrid combination that was presented. 

Other than these two misses, the rest of the food Diane and I enjoyed were definite hits. My Chicken Fried Steak was superb in taste except for two bites that included tough sinewy meat. The rest of the breaded cube steak was spot on. And, the Country Gravy that was generously spread over the Country Fried Steak and accompanying delicious creamy mashed potatoes was delicious. Both the gravy and the mashed potatoes would be hard to top. I was told that green beans are normally served with the Chicken Fried Steak, but it was the end of the day, and the restaurant was all out of green beans. So, broccoli was offered instead. I demurred, and nice slices of red tomato were plated instead. I also sampled a big bite of Diane's Fish & Chips, and the hot and crispy battered cod was also excellent in taste, just as were the seasoned french fries. 

Most of the food here is homemade on premises. And, the chef/co-owner enjoys baking pies and cakes as well. His Peach Cobbler with a scoop of yellow-colored Vanilla Ice Cream was light, spongy, and excellent. His version of Chocolate Cake was very moist, chocolaty, and delicious with its own scoop of sun-shaded Vanilla Ice Cream. What is a restaurant review without testing desserts! Ah, the sacrifices I sometimes make in eating high caloric foodstuffs for the benefit of my readers, and to compile a comprehensive multi-course review! 

Service was quick and very friendly by the daughter of the owners. As the name reveals, this is a family enterprise. In fact, we were extended a friendly greeting by one owner not long after being seated, and met and chatted with both owners before we departed. They are Yelp friendly, too. For, a Yelp sticker appears on the cafe's glass front door. The place is difficult to find situated as it is near a dead end on an edge of Mountain's Edge. But it is worth making a trek to this fine diamond in the rough for one or more fine meals! 

I know that I will soon return to this lovely cafe for other edible treats!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,6,4,pLVMjEL8xmcz-nirIl2iQg

5959450,2013-06-01,1,fW7SHgmidc32kHSoyLTM2A,"Great little spot for classic American fare. 

We arrived around 11am for breakfast and the place had a good amount of people seated. We were lucky enough to arrive just as a booth became available. We were greeted quickly and drinks were brought out. The cups were so large, I didn't even need a refill. That's saying a lot since I'm the queen of refills. I was really impressed with the service. Everyone was very attentive. Refills were swift and food was extremely large portions. 

I decided on the Wisconsin cheese omelet, my fella got the sausage and cheese omelet and my mom got a breakfast combination. We all decided on hot cakes as our sides. The food was quick and everything was great. The consensus was that the hot cakes were our favorites. They were fluffy and fabulous. Some of the best pancakes we've had in town. Everyone had a great meal. It's a bit of a drive from me, but worth it for some fantastic pancakes. 

This is a family run business and almost everyone working here is related, so I'm all for supporting locally and family-run restaurants. Definitely give this place a chance. They also have a mobile car wash in their parking lot and you can put it on your food bill for convenience, if you're interested. 

Just to note, unless you live in the area, it may be a little difficult to locate this restaurant. My GPS directed me all the way down Rainbow to the restaurant but the street comes to a dead end so make sure you follow the signs to the restaurant or call and they will direct you properly.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,4,4,JBPt5ubgu7d3TrGlQJkyOw

I will do everything in my power to pass on a good word to help them continue to grow until Rainbow blvd. is completed and they can have a steady and predictable business. As it is now, they maintain the same high quality whether I am one of a few patrons or they get a surge of 10 tables. My hat is off to them.
