134919,2016-11-13,0,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"Wow..

well the service sucked. they did the best they could but being understaffed expect to wait like we did, 20 minutes for a drink and over an hour and a half for your appetizer and food.  yes the appetizer came out the same time the food did which was amazing cause my entree was room temperature. don't expect refills on your drinks in a timely manner due to the nature of their staffing. if you sit at a table and not a booth, prepare your a$$ and back for some uncomfortable times. wtf is this kindergarten?

I tried the chorizo hamburger which was cooked perfectly but had NO chorizo on it...?  the trash can nachos.. well buy your own canned queso Blanco throw it on some chips and there you go, your $20 nacho appetizer. 

the fried ice cream for desert was amazing. the $15 margaritas were small but good. it's hit or miss depending on how much alcohol they actually contain with some being strong and others tasting like a drink from sonic 

all in all, it was worth a shot and spent time with family. but for an entree, margarita for each of our party of 5 plus a desert and appetizer.. $300+ for the 5 of us after getting the service we got and the quality of food we received was a complete waste. the only reason this got 2 stars instead of 1 is because the staff was friendly and the fried ice cream was that good but very very sweet. 

Guy you should be ashamed of yourself. this is supposed to be what you do and this restaurant has your name plastered all over it and this is what we get?  I'll take my family else where, I spent over 300 bucks for a dinner that should have been served in a styrofoam container from a place called robertos.  

your restaurant made me want to hit myself in the face really fu**in hard... never again.. never.",513_UGWFaYP5rPz9VA11Cw,0,0,2,KbKwRSE_cVWQJ3VE4EkVrw

Cadillac margaritas were fabulous and recommended by our server, Gracie.  Halopenia Poopers were nice and spicy with just the right amount of cheese. I had the Carne Asada tacos which were incredibly tasty. So full that we just couldn't stuff in dessert.

219527,2016-08-13,0,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"I just left Vegas, and all I can think about is the Chicken Tortilla Soup I had for dinner the night before I left.  I'll be back the end of September, and already know I'll be dining here again!  I go for Business, so I'm by myself.  I love having the option of sitting at the bar, where the cooking and prep is done, rather than at a table by myself. Makes the dining experience so much more enjoyable.  

The Chicken Tortilla Soup wasn't too spicy, just enough--I don't want it so hot it burns my taste buds, but I do want a bit of a bite. If you like it spicier, they have a tower of hot sauces to pick from.  I loved how they served it.  The broth is cooked separate, and served separately.  The chicken and veggies, including chunks of fresh avocado, are served together.  They're combined at your seat by the server, with any remaining broth left in its serving dish to be added as you eat.  The tortilla strips are served separately so you can add yourself--no soggy strips!!  And a grilled lime, and julienne radish serve as condiments you can add to your taste.  EXCELLENT!!!

I also had a craving for Guac!  Again, a unique experience.  They brought the basic avocado, garlic, lime concoction, along with a separate plate containing chopped onion, chopped cilantro, chopped jalopeno, and julienne radish.  You can decide what you want to add, and how much, and server creates the final mix right there in front of you.  Very good!  I like the freshness by doing it this way, but the flavors don't have enough time to meld.  I imagine the Guac would be even tastier after a couple hours, if you actually have any left!  Which I didn't.

This was a filling meal, and delicious!!  The entrees I saw all looked great, huge platters.  I'd recommend sharing everything so you can get lots of flavors.  Another diner admitted he and his wife shared the guac, and each had a bowl of the Chicken Tortilla Soup.  By the time their entree was served, he was full.  Be forewarned!

The Service, too, was outstanding!  I ran into a bit of an issue trying to charge the bill to my room, but Server went above and beyond to resolve the issue, and make it happen!! 

I've eaten in one of Guy Fieri's Johnny Garlics restaurants--mediocre food, overpriced--so wasn't expecting to get the meal or experience I did.  What a pleasant surprise!

Before tip, $22.   It sounds high, but the complimentary chips and salsa, Guac and soup were a filling meal for me, and not many places you can get a meal served in Vegas for less.than $25!!!",mLy5l3Flp0NJpoq3CMbgYg,0,0,5,E_UkMS3JnKBburH_9R6AhA

320508,2017-11-28,0,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"This restaurant is an embarrassment to the Guy Fieri brand.  We purchased tickets to see Penn & Teller, and were looking for a place to eat before the show.  Seeing that there was a Guy Fieri restaurant at the Rio, we were excited to give it a try. Our first clue of the problems there should have been the fact that there was zero wait time at dinner time on a holiday weekend.  

The restaurant has all of the atmosphere of a tired and failing Mexican restaurant.  It was just flat, boring, and with no energy.

The service was slow and very inattentive.  It took 45 minutes to get our food, which ended up being underwhelming.   

I ordered the enchiladas.  They tasted good, but were not hot and were undersauced.  

It was such a frustrating experience.  The kitchen is open, so we could see the whole cluster happening before our eyes.  It seemed to just be chaos.

We assumed this place would be great - there was a line, further confirming its popularity

We were given a small table, which honestly i didn't mind because it meant not waiting another 15 minutes. Our server was pleasant.
I ordered the vegetarian tacos, a side of street corn and we had the churros for desert.

As a vegetarian i encounter the usual difficulties eating out, but was pleasantly surprised there was something on the menu for me.
The first bite I took, was hard to swallow. There was a flavor I could not identify, so I assumed it was meat or fish. My face said it all. My husband was a little exasperated, as we encounter similar problems a lot. I told him not to worry - it was probably nothing and i would try another bite - instead he did, and said it tasted awful

So it was not meat or fish
After explaining to the server, she said it could have been cotija cheese which messes with peoples taste buds - but unless cotija tastes like - I'm sorry to say this but actual poo, then it was not that!!!!
She took the tacos off the bill, but charged me for the rest of the meal as three side orders (beans, rice and the corn) which didn't even make a dent in our very expensive check

Somehow we ordered drinks and it took over 10 minutes to bring us a beer and margarita.  Yet when we ordered the ""carne asada"" it somehow arrived in literally less than 2 minutes.  I can only assume someone else got served this, informed the wait staff it's not what they ordered, and so it was re-routed to us.  Or they just stuck it in a microwave.

My favorite part was the tortillas; the first batch was literally rock hard.   We asked for fresh tortillas from a waiter walking past, who brought us a batch of edible ones.  When our waitress eventually came back, we asked for the sour cream that was supposed to have come with the meal but never appeared.  She let us know she'd put in an order for ""extra"" sour cream, so we had to let her know it never was there in the first place.  We also asked for more tortillas, and again we were served 3 burnt tortillas that were so inedible that when you touched them they crumbled.  

I was really hoping they would ask how our meal was, so I could let her know that this was literally the worst restaurant I ever ate at.

The HH menu is small- the ""nachitos"" are $8, add on fee for protein. On Thursdays they have tacos on special, if $6/street taco is considered some sort of great deal. Even the HH margs are priced in the double-digits, which is surprising even for a casino- even more so considering this one is not actually located on the Strip. But whatever.

The complimentary chips and salsa are slow to come out, but the strip-shaped chips are nicely seasoned. Unfortunately the fire-roasted salsa only has a tiny kick of spice. The trash can nachos were just okay- not quite what was expected, but in the layers where the toppings really melted together they were best.

After attending Guys's Celebrity Chef event at Disney's food and wine festival at California Adventure, my husband and I decided to try out Guy's restaurant!!

I loved it!! The atmosphere was so cool! It really had Guy's special touch of kick $$ cooking!

To start the tortilla chips were a perfect combination of crunch, texture and flavor.

The mole soup base in the tortilla soup a flavorful twist to the soup 

The borracho plate was amazing! I felt that this plate was a great way to try a little bit of everything. I ordered the carnitas, drunkin fish tacos, and the cheese enchilada.

The carnitas were so well cooked they we soft, juicy and season well, that my husband who usually hates carnitas loved them. 

The drunkin fish taco was prepared well and had a nice slaw that went with it.

The cheese enchilada was such a delicious combination of cheeses.  The cheese was melted well and the enchilada sauce on top had a nice hint of smokiness to it!

My over all experience was spectacular! The service was great and the price was right we order 2 drinks, soup, and 4entrees and the bill was about $130, which is easily a dinner for 2 at Bobby's Mesa Grill.",vW2eg0IJ0pQlhh6IwOxLnA,2,1,5,dQ0-sOUq6zYSpKsON6EQPg

We both had tacos as our main course - shrimp for my wife and fish for me. When I say these were perfect, I mean PERFECT.

Drinks were exactly what you'd expect in this environment. Margaritas were made just right - which means you crave another because the tequila is there but not overbearing. 

Passed on dessert only because of time getting to a show.

Service was the highlight (once we sat down). Rochelle was handling multiple busy tables with ease and doing so in a way that made you feel like her only table. Did not miss a beat. In fact exceeded every expectation here.

Why a 4? For a Vegas restaurant and bar, get a reservation system in place OR extend your bar service so that people waiting in line can enjoy some cocktails.

I was so thrilled to read on the menu that the fajitas were made with poblanos instead of bell peppers, but it was bull. Maybe they ran out, maybe they think people don't know the difference, but I was served bells. Boring and typical, and the tortillas were white corn, barely hotter than room temp, which tastes kind of mealy, imo. The house salsa was flavorless pace - style mush. The ""spicy"" pineapple Margarita wasn't spicy. The guac was sorely lacking, but I'm a fan of lots of garlic, onions, lime and cilantro in my guac, so maybe thats just me. The service was slow (at 6pm on a quiet monday) but very friendly, the view of the pool was entertaining, and it was relatively inexpensive. And the hottest hot sauce was hot & had good flavor. But I really had high hopes for a celebrity chef take on Mexican classics and...next time I'll know better. Not terrible - just not worth hype.

Our server Peggy didnt understand the server/customer dynamic. Most of her time was either spent telling us what we couldnt have or far away from our table. at the end of dinner she told us because of our large party we couldn't split the bill. Our ""large party"" consisted of 4 adults and 4 children, all under 11 and 2 of them didn't even eat. When we were finished I asked her to split the bill, she argued with me telling me no and insisting the hostess explained the policy to me when we were seated. When I asked her if that did happen was that when I should have gotten up and left? She gave me a dirty look and walked away. She also added a 20% gratuity for her terrible service and that is when I had enough. I told her I am not going to sit back and let her rip me off with her automatically applied tip. I told her I had to get my own plates when the food arrived, and my own place settings. I had to go find the hot sauce I asked for when she never showed back up with that either. I told her considering the service, I wanted to decide on my own what her tip would be. I told her to take our 2 credit cards, take them to the manager and have the manager come speak with me. The manager refused to speak with us, but did split the bill. We were so anxious to get out of there and forget the place that we didnt notice until after we left she split the bill with her 20% on it.

I guess I shouldn't completely judge it on the one entree and appetizer but unfortunately that is the only thing I have to go on. I did give three stars because of the prompt and friendly service.

My quesadilla was mostly tortilla with some cheese and a few bits of chicken, but with that weird salt.

But I figured why not go for it, I mean. Guy Fieri is a celebrity chef, his restaurant must have cuisine on par with the likes of other Food Network greats. 

Boy was I wrong, but I guess I wasn't aware nacho cheese sauce was a culinary trend right now. The highlight (I use that word loosely) of the meal was the ""trash can"" nachos. I can't complain about something that tastes like a 2 hour old nachos bel grande from taco bell.

I've been wanting to go here since they first opened in Laughlin.  I am rarely at the Rio and their limited hours has made it a challenge to visit before now.  

We sat at the bar and ordered a Burro Punch and Horchata Colada for our drinks, chips and salsa (free w/ yelp check in) and the smaller Trash Can Nachos with Carne Asada to eat.  Food and drinks both came out super fast considering the restaurant was fairly full.  Drinks were $12-$15 which isn't bad for a casino.  The drinks were strong and tasted great.  Trash Can Nachos were the star of the show.  Super gooey and delicious.  I don't know how they get every chip covered like that.  No dry chips here.  Only slight critique is that they could have used a little kick.  Maybe a salsa or sauce to give it that little something extra.  There are two sizes of the Trash Can Nachos the regular is $15 and there is a grande shareable size for $32.  Any protein is additional.  We opted for the smaller size and ate the whole thing.  We wished we would have gotten the bigger one.  (EDIT: 2nd visit we got the bigger one and it is way too big for 2)  If you are by yourself or having entrees the smaller is probably fine.  

Our bartender Jerika was awesome.  She is what brings this from a 4 star review to a 5 star.  She was super nice and welcoming.  She took the time to make conversation even though the bar was fairly full.  When she found out I was a local she let me know that with a Total Rewards players card I would get 25% off the bill.  I had no idea.  I didn't have my card on me so I ran to the TR desk real quick and got a replacement card.

Boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Sunday night around 6:45pm. We arrived to a pretty long line and the hostess quoted us 40 minutes. It only looked long because there were a lot of large parties but in reality, we waited less than 30 minutes. 

So of course we ordered the trashcan nachos that was so highly talked about. It was actually the main reason why my boyfriend wanted to try this place. Presentation was pretty cool but personally, those nachos were unforgettable. Sure there were all the fixins with cheese, black beans, chili beef (?), jalapenos and pico de gallo.....but it just tasted dried and lacklustered to me. Boyfriend loved it....he said he would actually eat this as an entrée. These nachos were big enough for 4-5 adults to brush off. (I feel like this would taste better with fries instead of nacho chips?) 

On the side, I ordered a street-style carne asada taco. Nope. I had better elsewhere. It tasted generic and Amercanized. No way this was street-style, it was more Tex-Mex, if anything. Boyfriend had the enchilada combo platter. It was edible but once again it was bland and flavorless. No way in hell we would come back here again. Side note: you cannot order the tacos a la carte. You can only order it if your party orders an entrée. 

Definitely a ""I came, I tried"" kinda place. And I'm not coming back. If I was ever at the Rio again, I rather go to the buffet instead.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,11,6,2,Cz-eGNOZx2b6ygqU1y9E-w

Our party enjoyed the Chicken Mole enchildas, the El Gringo, the Carna Asada street tacos, and the Verde Asadas street tacos. The portions were large, with the exception of the stree tacos (3 tacos with a side of cilantro rice and black beans in a small black cast iron pot). We each enjoyed our meals. 
The music was a little loud at times, but after a couple of margaritas one didn't mind. The service was great! The staff brought me a drunken donkey sombrero to wear while they sang happy birthday. Absolutely loved it! The flan that they brought for dessert was to die for!

2936073,2017-03-31,10,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"This was a very cheesy meal and as in cheesy I mean there was lots of cheese involved. I'm not sure when the next time I'll be in Vegas so I took the opportunity to go try the infamous trash can nachos from El Burro Borracho that's been flying all over social media. 

I'll start by saying ""that's what I call a beer!"" I ordered a Modelo and it was perfectly ice cold. Have you ever had a beer so cold and carbonated that when drinking it almost brings tears when hitting your throat during the first gulp? Well much like an perfectly cold carbonated Coke, this beer did just that and it was refreshing. The beer stayed cold until it was finished. I cross my fingers and hope this will be the case for all future visits.

To go along with the beer I ordered trash can nachos with carne asada added and jalapeno poppers. The poppers packed a spicier kick than expected. They were stuffed with both chorizo and queso casero cheese. The chorizo is barely noticeable with the cheese stealing the show in terms of flavor. Good dish with lots of queso but I would have liked to have tasted the flavor of the chorizo. The lime chipotle ranch given on the side was flavorful and helped to cool things down a bit with the spice.

Now for the main event...the trash can nachos. CHEESE OVERLOAD! These nachos had all the fixings to make one flavorful tower of nachos with the cheese once again stealing the show. However the other ingredients in this dish are noticeable. I tried taking this tower down solo but ended up stuffed half way through. My only gripe is the carne asada that I thought was awesome. There wasn't enough of it in the nachos. Getting a hold of chunks here and there the meat looked to be prepared medium (borderline medium-rare). The pieces were tender and juicy. It is an extra cost for meat in addition to the $20 cost of the nachos so that's why I wish there was more than what was given. Come on Guy, Go Big Or Go Home is your model! Gotta apply that model to the carne asada. Great nacho dish as a whole nonetheless.

I'm kicking myself for not remembering my servers name because she was excellent. The hostess at the entrance was also excellent. Both had awesome personalities and provided great service. 

Beers that make you tear and nacho towers...not bad Guy, not bad at all.

The hostess and server were both attentive and friendly, although all the staff seemed overworked. It wasn't that crowded at the time I went but everyone seemed preoccupied and distracted. 

I ordered a basic burrito. Ground beef, cheese, cabbage. It came with sides of rice and beans. The rice was good. The burrito really tasted like the kind you can make from a box in the supermarket. It wasn't bad but it wasn't like a meal out. I also got a rather strong and overly sweet mojito and indulged in fried ice cream for dessert. The crust on the ice cream was tasteless so I ended up breaking it and just eating the ice cream with the sauces. Kind of defeats the purpose of frying it.

The food here is great! The chips are seasoned and warm. Trash Can nachos were every bit as delicious as I had imagined. The portions are huge.  The first time I got it on my own and had massive leftovers. The second time I shared with three people and still had leftovers. Also, the enchiladas are phenomenal. I had cravings for them the next day.  

One thing I will say about the trash can nachos, if you want to take a picture, make sure to tell your server otherwise they'll just remove that tin can so fast, you won't get a shot of it. Yup, that happened to me. 

The drink I ordered was on the weak side.  I think it was a pineapple habanero margarita. The server cautioned me that it is spicy.  I'm Indian, spice is in my blood.  The drink was not spicy, but it was tasty. I probably wouldn't order that again.  My friends enjoyed their regular margaritas.

Definitely check out this place. Food is great and service is good too.",oRmoaSv38FFRR9HNyrpwcQ,4,1,4,89ydPYlbPe0NZBnRXruhnQ

My friend ate the trash can nachos and got sick off of it. I ate the vegetarian enchiladas they weren't bad but way too expensive fit what you get. The chips were so oily ugh. I really expected alot more from this restaurant but it was all hype. Save your money and go elsewhere. Way too many good Mexican restaurants in Vegas to eat here.,nUcQM8aXckWq0WraI2_3kA,0,0,3,W7Pabn0_6CW3AladkUC8nw

The salad was great but the shrimp was cold and chewy.  3 shrimp for the $6 upcharge.  The fish on the drunken tacos was WAY over cooked.  My husband couldn't even finish the meal.  The rice was cold and the canned beans were tasteless.  The server did take the tacos off our bill.  So many better places to eat in Vegas.,7OP_yv5pKwOkscfDZJwqzA,1,1,1,5N8-ydQu_QK9qe9nHHQKcA

3157911,2018-03-22,0,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"A friend of mine had told me if I was going to the Rio this restaurant was a must go to. At first I was skeptical because I was like what does Guy Fieri know about Mexican food? I'm from New Mexico so I'm very picky about Mexican food. But, my experience was pleasant.

Located inside of the Rio the restaurant had interesting decorations and murals it is pretty large inside with ample seating w/ a big bar for those parties dining alone. Which is where I sat so I don't see it right away. Immediately I was greeted by the bartender who was very friendly and looked a little drunk lol but it's Vegas who isn't? She was very attentive and made sure everything was to my liking.

I was feeling antsy to get back on the slots so I didn't order a drink. From the pictures I had already looked at on Yelp I had already established I wanted some enchiladas so I opted for the pork Chile verde enchiladas as everything else seem to be covered in mole. They came out pretty quickly the presentation was really nice you get the rebate enchiladas. My first bite wasn't so great as the tortilla was extremely crunchy as if it was old or reheated too much. However, the taste of the Verde sauce was good and those beans were amazing! the rice was good as well. After the first 2 bites I got in the middle where it was softer and it was delicious! My only complaint would be there is more cheese inside than meat and if you don't eat the enchiladas right away the cheese gets cold & turns gummy. I suppose they did that to cut back on the meat cost. Other than that the dining experience was good but I'm curious to try the tacos now.",03I5PkJiXk2V0I3moiCVXA,2,0,4,WD43f1iHFn3aD8wzTCbDGA

We went to El Burro Borracho and the first thing we noticed was the helpful staff. The ambience is fun and casual. We ordered caliente marguerita and the Austin Sweet tea with vodka. These were great!
Drinks and food arrived quickly. We had the shrimp fajitas which were plentiful, and tasty, but whose sauce was a bit unremarkable, and the rock shrimp tacos. These were not wonderful. Taco shells were tough and pieces of fried shrimp were batter without much to recommend them.
Both had rice and refried beans.

From the drinks (the Caliente Margarita and Cadillac Margarita were both excellent) to the awesome bar staff (HUGE thanks to Jerika and Anthony, our bartenders) to the food itself, the experience was such a pleasant surprise! We shared the medium spicy guacamole with chicharrones which they prepare tableside to your liking and it was so fresh. The Mexican Fundido was just delicious. I had the Beef Machaca enchiladas for my main and I couldn't believe how good it was - like literally so surprised how insanely tasty. My husband had the Carne asada tacos which were so tender and flavorful. Beyond the food which was shockingly good, the staff there really care about the restaurant and the brand and proudly defended Mr. Fieri when we teased them about him. Will it last? We sure hope so.

First, El Burro Borracho is located inside the Rio Casino/hotel and you can park for free at their parking lot if you are a Las Vegas local. The Rio is located right by 15 on the West side of the strip which means that it is pretty convenient to get there. The place itself is of average size so you might have to wait to get a table on the busiest nights.

We had the trash can nachos and I must say that I was surprisingly satisfied in spite of their price ($20 with no meat). Even though $20 for nachos can seem exaggerated, they are very big and will easily be enough for 4 people. On top of that, they are organized in layers and are very good tasting.

The atmosphere inside the restaurant is pretty great and mexican-themed. Service was incredibly bad when we went, even though it wasn't even such a busy night, but I think that our server, Manuel, was just ridiculously bad at his job. He came by once to take our order and never came back afterwards. We even had to hunt him down for 15 minutes to get the check.

In conclusion, I would say that this is a good place for mexican-style food. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",JR7AYVUJ1_Nq36UBW3XHYw,1,4,5,RI_T--5hZCkyRdwnfwTm0g

I dont usually include too much about service, cause I am there to eat good food. But man oh man. First off, theres a line. No, they don't take your name, dont hand you a little buzzer thingy, and they cant tell you approximate wait times. Just a really long line in the middle of a smoke filled casino. 

We were served chips and salsa, with no water. We finished the chips and salsa before anyone even came by. My alcoholic beverage came out 15 minutes later, which btw they were out of what I really wanted- some horchata drink. The pineapple one was meh. Not convinced there was alcohol in it. 

As everyone around us was being served, we realized it took over 30 minutes for our nachos and a quesadilla to come out. Never checked on us, offered us more drinks or chips. Then, they didnt serve us all of our food at once. Nachos came out finally, and my sons quesadilla 5 minutes later. Tacky

Wanna know about the nachos? 4 pieces of carne asada were found- one was gristle. Just heaping piles of cheese and beans. A little sprinkle of queso fresco and pico on top with some deelish pickled jalepenos and onions and cilantro. Too bad this wasnt throughout the nachos as we fought for little pickings of it.

Most people rely on the Internet when visiting places on vacation, so to change hours is absurd.

3398143,2016-07-03,0,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"We patronized this restaurant early evening Saturday 7/2, as they were opening at 5pm for dinner. I was nervous about wait times, due to there being a line to get in, but we all got sat simultaneously. The problem with that, was waiting 10 minutes to put in a drink order, but I understood and gave benefit of the doubt. I'm also in the service industry. They apologized and made the rest of our experience quick and efficient. 

First, we will start with the drinks. Yum! My husband and I ordered the pineapple habanero margarita and a Cadillac margarita. The pineapple habanero one was fantastic! Sweet, slightly smokey, with a little kick at the end. I would definitely drink this again. The cadillac was good, but just your basic Cadillac margarita. No complaints, it tasted just how it should, with an orange for garnish. Only complaint on the drinks is the price. Its served in a standard martini-sized Cabo glass, not huge, and $15 each. We stopped at one each, because we couldn't justify spending $60 on drinks alone. Bummer. Would have loved another round. 

Now for the food. Omg! It was better than I was expecting. I'm from Orange County, CA, where Mexican food is top notch. This was on par, for being a full service restaurant. Usually full restaurants skimp somewhere in the details. This place does not! The complimentary chips and salsa to start was fantastic. The chips were fresh and seasoned with a perfectly balanced spice blend, and slightly spicy and sweet salsa. As my entree, I ordered the machaca enchiladas, and they were so moist, flavorful, with a perfect kick of spice at the end. I think it was smothered in a mole type sauce, but I could be wrong. It all worked well together, and was so cheesy! Yum! Brown rice (standard course!) and beans were the perfect compliment on the side. I was able to take half home and enjoy it later.  My husband got the asada burrito, and I was almost jealous I didn't get that. We ended up sharing everything! The tortilla they used tasted house-made, and was perfectly flaky and grilled on the outside. Inside was some of the most perfectly marinated and spiced steak I've had in a loooooong time. It was stuffed along side a marinated/sautéed I believe cabbage, which might sound weird, but was the perfect texture to compliment the meat and tortilla. He had the pico on the side, he's lame lol, but that was a nice addition too, had it all been mixed together. Now, my step son joined us, and is extremely picky with food. I've tried... He doesn't budge. They didn't have a simplified kids menu, which is a bummer, because they usually cater to simpler palettes. However, the server was more than happy to accommodate him. We got him just a steak, bean & cheese burrito. I was afraid he was going to think the steak had ""too much"" to it, but he ate the whole thing, and was happy. Thankful for that! It's hard taking picky eaters out. And we all had half our meal leftover for later! Great portions sizes!

The experience as a whole was great. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice. We had a view of people enjoying the pool. I also like being able to watch the cooks in action, as the line was open air to presentation for the whole restaurant. Not tucked in the back like most. I only docked one star for the pricing. I get that it's a famous chefs restaurant, but it's also at the Rio, which isn't fancy by any means and off the strip. We would have loved to get one of their appetizers, like the trash can nachos (which looked fab), but again could not justify tacking on another $18 (plus $4+ for meat) to add it on to the bill. Our bill for three entrees, two cocktails and a soda was $103, before tip. A tad too high in my opinion, but at least the food was delicious, and redeemed that one problem. 

Overall, my hubby and I plan to go back! But next time, we might share an entree and app, and use the extra money on those extra two yummy margaritas! I'll frequent even more (we're locals) if they adopt a good happy hour or something! Or locals discount? Thanks for the yummy food, Guy!

El Burro was a great! The appetizer we ordered, Trash Can Nachos were a hit and was shared by three people with leftovers to bring home for round two! $18 for nachos can be a deal breaker and is often a letdown on the Strip, this will not disappoint. Presentation is everything and this is the fun part. The server arrived with a mini trash can, then lifts the can and there is a stack of nachos. No worries because the filling is filled throughout the stack. My only wish, the beans were just barely room temperature, they could have been a little warmer. 

Another plus, it has an urban feel and trendy.... The best part, the music was NOT blaring! Restaurants take note because I will return here if I want to visit with friends! Thank you for that!

The service was excellent! I wish I could remember Adrian? From Mexico! He was great. We had imbibed earlier and were there to sober up, some servers will snubs you when no alcohol is ordered, he did the opposite, he engaged us and knew our guide from the Wine Cellar. This is great team building. 

I did not visit the bathroom to check to see how clean they were, however the open air kitchen proved the cooks were keeping it all clean!

I will return for drinks in the future, I think I missed out by looking around.

After a long 9 hour drive from Los Angeles. I had my heart set on trying ""trashcan nachos"" by the end of the day. I starved myself knowing I needed to make space. And it was worth all the pain. Got in about an hour before closing time. We were seated right away. 

Very hip location at the rio. Modern design With an Americanized Mexican feel. Seating is cozy but not clustered. And all of the dinning-ware has an authentic Mexican look. 

Or sever Gracie was amazing at helping us pic cocktails. We went with the margaritas which are definitely the way too go here. My friend loves spicy so she went with the jalapeño margarita and loved it. I opted for a hoppy and smokey margarita. This one in particular is mixed with a stone IPA beer. both amazing and at a great price of $15

Finally the trashcan nachoes we're as amazing as they looked on the food network. Chips are home made and fluffy like a feather pillow.

The menu had a variety of Mexican food. And although it is not to the T of authenticity it has an amazing tasteful spin to it. I had chips and salsa as well with guacamole for starters. I do recommend especially since the way they season their chips taste so delicious. for my main meal, I ordered enchiladas en Mole Verde with chicken also came with a side of rice and beans. The sauce in the enchiladas was not spicy which is different to the enchiladas I am used to. And of course, with any meal, you must try desert we ordered all three of the items on the menu churros, fried ice cream, and flan.

We were quoted an hour wait at American Grill but then spotted El Burrito Borracho and they quoted a half an hour. That'll work!

I asked if they had a way to notify us of our table being ready, which they had no capability of doing. Super weird in a casino I assume wants their guests to wander and gamble while waiting. Nope, we just had to park ourselves nearby. 

Half an hour came and went, so Brandon went to ask the host desk how much longer we'd be waiting. At this point, the hostess tells him that we'll basically be hungry for at least another 30 minutes. Um, what. 

I went up to the hostess, Nikki, who I'm giving the 2nd star for...she was apologetic, explaining that they opened 3 DAYS AGO and the kitchen was completely floundering in executing this new menu. I asked her to level with me, ""so what you're saying is even if we wait the extra 30 minutes, we'll likely wait ANOTHER 30 minutes to get our food?"" She nodded.

Yep, take us off that list. At this point we were able to walk right into American Grill and get our food in ten minutes.

Poor girls at Burro's host stand seemed totally unsupported. The manager should have told them to set expectations with waiting guests...something along the line of ""We're estimating 30-45 minutes, however we just opened and cannot guarantee seating in that timeframe."" 

See? Is that so hard? Bummed we weren't able to experience the food because people who got fed seem pleased with the menu.",Zj5Caq3EXPQD8g4gV8KoMw,13,10,2,OqcNIURjVCvhkezm5d47VQ

We went during Happy Hour which is between 4pm-6pm. What I loved was that they offered a mini size of the Trash Can Nachos for $8! Yes! These nachos were amazing. Usually when you order nachos, they put the toppings on top and by the time you get to the bottom, there's nothing good left. These ""Trash Can Nachos"" ensured that every bite had a bit of cheese, crema, beans, carne (you get the point) These nachos are freshly made - not store bought. 

The next item that we ordered was The Gringo burger (not really Mexican food) but I'm a huge fan of Mac n cheese and that's why I was so disappointed with this. The burger came and the cheese already looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp for too long.  The Mac n Cheese lacked flavor. The fries are heavily seasoned and too salty.

3966732,2016-08-26,10,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"I was going to see Rock of Ages at the Rio and decided to try Giy Fieri's newest restaurant in Las Vegas, The Drunken Burro in the spot where Buzio's seafood used to be.  The room is almost identical to what it was except for changing some of the decoration and adding a booth seating area.

I was seated at the first two person high top near the entrance.  The place wasn't busy enough to get a counter spot where you can watch the cooks work.

My server was Gracie and she was very good.  She brought a menu and went to get my iced tea.  I asked her about the comparative sizes of the appetizers and other dishes as I was dining solo.  I opted to get the roasted chicken tortilla soup.    For the main course, I ordered the pork chile verde enchiladas.

While waiting for the soup, I munched on too many of the chips and salsa.  The chips are house made tortilla strips rather than chips and the salsa has a small bit of heat.  It's a fire roasted tomato salsa and it's quite good.

In a short time, Gracie brought my soup.  She put the wooden platter in front of me and cautioned me that the cast iron broth holder was VERY hot so I should use care when pouring the contents of the cast iron pot into the soup ingredients which the menu lists as shredded achiote chicken, tomato, cilantro, lime, shredded cabbage, diced avocado, sliced radish, sweet onion, roasted jalapeño, and crispy tortilla strips.  The soup was very good and there's a spicy kick to the broth.  There was one time when some of the spices got to the back of my throat and neither my tea nor a drink of water put out the brief fire.

A problem arrived when a runner brought my main course while I was still eating my soup.  The runner said, ""Oh, I hope I'm not hurrying you.  Here's your enchiladas.""  She then pushed some glasses aside and put the large platter on the table.  I didn't quite finish the soup and then moved the soup holder to the other side of the table and brought the enchilada platter in front of me.

The menu describes the enchiladas as marinated pork shoulder, queso casero, tomatillo salsa, sweet onion, tequila-lime crema, and cilantro.  The enchiladas came with the requisite beans, rice, and small chopped tomatoes, onion, and guacamole to mix in with the enchiladas or eat as a small salad.  The main course was OK.  The enchiladas were fairly standard--nothing that I would walk away remembering.

After finishing, Gracie stopped by to see if I saved room for dessert which she didn't realize was a rhetorical question.  I asked about two desserts that had caught my eye and I ordered the coconut tres leches bread pudding.  She explained it wasn't the standard kind of bread pudding that it was not baked like other bread puddings.  It sounded intriguing so I ordered it and I'm glad I did.

The bread pudding is sort of a cross between angel food cake and sponge cake that has been soaked in the three milks and topped with some coconut pieces on top.  On the side of the dessert was a small pitcher of crème Anglaise to pour over the bread pudding.

Guy, and I think I can call you that because we once had a photo taken together, here are some suggestions.  Instead of having a server take the time to tell me to be very careful about adding the broth to the soup bowl, why don't you have the server do it?  I've been in many high end restaurants where this has been done and it's classy.  Having me dump my broth is not what I'm paying for.  Think of all the photos and/or video that would appear on social media showing the joining of the broth and soup ingredients.  What advertising!  Also, can servers keep an eye on those dining and course the meal better.  If the soup is that hot that I have to be very careful, it's going to take longer to eat.  It isn't rocket science.  A diner should never have their appetizer interrupted by the arrival of the main course unless they've dawdled which I assure you I wasn't.

Note to locals:  El Burro Borracho gives a 25% discount when you show them your Nevada driver's license.  This makes the Strip plus Fieri pricing much more tolerable.

With that said, I'm very disappointed at his restaurant at the Rio.  I ordered the trash can nachos and the chicken enchiladas in Verde sauce. The nachos, I was was lucky to see maybe an ounce of carne asada, black beans, and salsa. The white nacho cheese sauce resembled more or a veschmel sauce.  The tortilla strips were very puffy but soggy. 
The order of chicken enchilada was the same. I was lucky to have gotten 2 oz of chicken meat in all three enchilada and lacked any kind of Verde mole sauce. The rice had no flavor and look like it had been colored with the juice drained from a 6 oz can of tomatoes, minus the tomatoes.  I can judge a place for Mexican cuisine by the way the beans taste.  A good pot of bean is everything. El Pollo Loco makes better pot of beans but barely.  The small container of salsa that was given with the order, tasted nothing like crushed tomatoes or salsa... what was that!
I knew something was wrong when you barkeep dropped a bunch of paper cones on the floor behind the bar...picked them up, and just restack them instead of throwing them out in the trash can less than a foot away.
I'm very disappointed at your restaurant in what saw and tasted.

4057346,2016-07-17,6,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"Removing any feelings about Guy Fieri, this review is based on a few things:

First, the late night menu is super-limited. We in Vegas, son! 10pm in the second town known as the city that never sleeps should have good options (and definitely include ones for folks that don't eat the meats.)

The ambiance is that of Red Robin on 'Cowboy Day.' Nothing against Red Robin; I would have preferred to go there instead.

Service: the poor servers looked harried. Too busy for the number of people coming in the doors. They were all nice, but rushed when speaking with us, which made me feel rushed.

After nursing a few drinks over the course of the evening with my group, my choice was... nachos with queso (sans red meat.) I chuckled inwardly at the overdone presentation: they brought out what looked like a flour sifter with a bottom that opens. They place it on the plate and RELEASE THE KRAKEN! Meaning that the chips and jalapenos dumped onto my plate. 

Woooo...

For all cheese lovers (yeah, I'm talking to you) you know that queso's liquidity needs a chip that can stand up against it's food-soaking quality. 

The instance that they poured the queso over my recently freed nachos, I was swimming in a mushy bland corn soup.

The Pineapple Habanero margarita is incredible.

Bad News

There's no kids menu. One of my daughters ordered the Asada tacos (plain), which came with 3 tacos, rice and beans for about $20. Add plain cheese enchiladas, and a simple chicken, rice and beans burrito for the other two and you're looking at damn near $60 for something that would normally run you about $15. 

Good News

Best jalepeno poppers I've had in my entire life! We're talking 4 large size jalepenos stuffed with cheese and chorizo then fried to golden perfection.

Bad News

Sodas are going to run you $5 a pop and while the first run of chips is complimentary, the rest are gonna cost ya! (And they're frickin addicting... Which is still bad news given the situation.)

Good News

When your dad is a Diamond you get to jump to the front of the line (wait on a Sunday at 6:30 was about 15 minutes)

If you're not a Diamond...or platinum... Or 7 Stars, your wait time is more like 45 minutes.

If I could rate the service separately I would rate 5 stars.  We had an attentive server who was very pleasant and made sure we had refills and checked-IN periodically, despite it being a very busy night.

We ordered the Taco Tuesday - All you can eat tacos and margaritas meal.  On side note, their website price is outdated at $45 and has increased to $55.  If you can take down a couple of margaritas then this price isn't so bad as individually they're $15-$18 each.  I must admit the Pineapple Habanero Margarita stole the show! I'd have to say these are the best margaritas I've ever had and boy did they pack a punch and are 5 start worthy!

As far as the food....  MEHHHHH...   So I couldn't wait to try those infamous Trash Can Nachos that circulate all over FB.  The entire production of those towering layers of cheesy goodness could go wrong, right? WRONG!!!  Those by far are the worse nachos I've ever had!!!  In fact, tried them 3 times before I threw in the towel and said I just couldn't go on anymore.  The cheese isn't cheese, it some sort of Velveeta floury sauce blend not even near a cheaply tasting nacho sauce.  Wasn't good at all!  Normally, decent chips and decent nacho sauce can makes a decent nacho but OMG this sauce made the nachos tasteless.  The veggies and black beans did nothing for this disaster.  SO DISAPPOINTED!!!

The chips aren't bad but the basic red molcajete salsa was so bland!  I could've tried the other salsas for an extra $4 if I wanted but I figured I'd stick with my $3 chips and salsa.  BTW, I've never paid for chips and salsa before at a Mexican restaurant.  

The taco's were okay for a gringo version of tacos.  When it came down to it, the $55 for the unlimited top shelve margaritas were worth the Taco Tuesday deal.  Not the food and certainly not the $34 horrific nachos!!!

The 3 stars are averaging the food at 1 star with margaritas and services at a 5.",lUxw1KQ6pnEjoL8URb8pWg,1,0,3,QCjeyeyb5odLhIrIPHyEEA

All the food was delicious but we should have ordered the small nachos since there were just two of us & the chips get soft very quickly. The margarita was great!

4718763,2016-12-03,0,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"Sad to say this place is overhyped!! I was so excited to go here being how there were so many videos on Facebook showing those trash can nachos and so I guess that left me with super high expectations. 

The restaurant is located in the Rio Hotel, pretty far off from the strip. So unless you have a car, expect to Uber there most likely because the walk can be brutal during those super cold and windy Vegas nights or extremely hot summers. (Fortunately the ubers in Vegas seem to have a flat rate around $8 which isn't bad at all. )

Once we arrived to the restaurant there was already a line outside the entrance which was to be expected given that it was prime dinner time (around 7pm) and it was a Saturday night. Fortunately, the line moved fairly fast, so we weren't waiting too long. Once we got to the hostess we were promptly seated. The decor inside was pretty cool, and there was a pretty view of the pool nearby. 

Our server was awesome and we didn't wait long at all for the food. She even waited for us to take pictures of the nachos before she took the ""can"" off of them and was super cool about it saying how everyone does it. 

The chips you get at the table are actually super good and way better than your typical free table chips that taste stale and flavourless.  These actually tasted fresh and were full of this really good spice on top. The salsa was also delicious! We also ordered sangria, but it was probably the WORST sangria I've ever had. It was honestly super bitter so I'm assuming the ratio of alcohol was off. I've had sangria in Spain, Cuba, and Puerto Rico so I'm familiar with what a proper one should taste like and this was definitely lacking. 

TRASH CAN NACHOS VERDICT: 3/5
 Okay so basically the piece de resistance of Guy Fieri's restaurant here are the trash can nachos. You didn't come here unless you ordered them. First thing to note is that the serving size is super deceiving. They look super tiny but in reality it's probably fit for a good 4-5 people as a dinner meal. It was only two of us, so we basically had to take more than half of it home. The price was around 20$ which was totally worth it when you think about the amount of food you're getting. Honestly though, while the concept was brilliant and really does make sure every chip has a bit of the topping on it, they just didn't do it for me. Being spoilt with good Mexican food in LA, these nachos just didn't have the authentic taste I can get with regular nachos in LA. They even lacked guac which is probably the most important ingredient to nachos if you ask me. Don't get me wrong, the ingredients made were definitely fresh and overall they were delicious but they just seemed overly americanised ""tex-mex"" more than anything. (& yes I'm well aware nachos aren't even really Mexican, but Mexicans in LA just know how make them much better with real ""carne asada"" and some fresh guac over them) 

So that being said, I still think it's super overhyped but it's fair to say you should give it a try on your own and be the judge yourself!",GX9iSyZ9JdJBW6Owxqbb0w,0,0,3,k24J5MF3Zu7qgNPaxsN87A
4737373,2016-06-05,0,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"Really a 4.5, but went with 5 because of overall experience.

Just left Mexico a few days ago and ate at Fieri's restaurant in the Cancun airport; Guy Fieri's Kitchen & Bar. Had some pretty good hot wings there, and know him from his TV shows, so why not give this joint a shot.

Was already staying in the Rio Hotel and Casino so it was just a short walk through the casino to his restaurant.

Chose to sit at the bar located adjacent to the cooking stations. Always love restaurants which have this kind of seating. Allows you to watch everything in the kitchen, from prep, to cooking and plating. Spent a leisurely hour and a half eating and enjoying the show in the kitchen. A definite 10 on this aspect of the restaurant!

Service, was great.

Atmosphere seemed nice throughout the restaurant, but by choice we were staring at stainless steel in the kitchen. Once again, an excellent show to watch in the kitchen.

Complimentary chips and salsa were brought out after the drinks. Great flavor on the chips and the salsa was very good; love charred tomatoes and fresh garlic!

So many items on the menu looked great. Could've eaten at least ten different things which sounded good.

After the chips and salsa, chose to split a dish. Chose the Picadillo Tacos which had incredible flavor in every bite. A lot going on in those three little tacos.

Was told the borracho beans have lard in them, if so, it worked for me. They were very tasty.  Cilantro and lime rice, as Guy would say, was, ""on point!""

Have to say it would be nice if they would allow you to get a mixed plate of tacos because so many if them sounded great when reading the menu. Love a sampler type plate!

Would definitely return. Overall experience, a solid 9!",fR71JY0G1jPsncawehuBKw,1,0,5,RaDZZ8dvOIleBjfrw1FnvQ
4751054,2016-04-30,0,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"So, my experience at Guy Fieri's El Burro Borracho may be slightly unique. My boyfriend and I found ourselves here prior to attending the Penn & Teller show at The Rio. As expected, the shuttle to take us from our hotel over to the Rio was running late that night. So we found ourselves in that unfortunate situation of having to inform our server that we were running late & needed to have our food ready and eaten as quickly as possible. 

Despite this less than ideal situation, however, El Burro Borracho was able to deliver--in terms of both fast service and food quality. We sat down and began eating the complimentary tortilla chips, which were thicker than normal and had were highly seasoned and very crunchy. We then ordered an enchilada platter and a chimichanga, which arrived very swiftly and tasted delicious. Although we had our doubts considering neither of us are a huge fan of Guy Fieri as a Food Network personality, the food really did transport us to flavor town. In fact, the type of enchiladas I ordered I usually don't even like, but the sauce was lime infused, fresh, and delicious. My boyfriend also expressed that his chimichanga was delicious and of course I couldn't help but notice that it was giant (even for a chimichanga!). 

While the prices are standard Las Vegas strip fare (about $15-20 for a meal that only comes with rice and beans), I can't deny that we received great service and great food. My main regret is that we did not have time to indulge in a margarita or some sangria. Also, because the restaurant is not very large, expect to wait to be seated, even if it is only a 5-10 minute wait.",GAZZA2IrIDeQkaIPrRik_w,0,0,4,vTN-UUzAo5y4cEqnRclapQ

4855744,2016-04-04,3,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"It's hard for me to believe that Guy put his name on this place!!! I am only giving a second star because our server was a really nice young man and I felt truly sorry for him that he believed that the food coming out of the kitchen was good. We came here on Saturday 4/2/16, supposedly the night before was the ""grand opening"" to the public where the man himself Guy was there. We were told there would be a 30 minute wait however, like most of the other reviews no pagers or intercoms to notify us so we took a seat on a chair behind the hostess stand. I noticed so many open tables in the place and wondered why there was a wait to begin with. I watched many other people come up and put their name in. After three other party's came in after us (one was a party of seven) and were sat within 10 minutes of putting their names in I was furious! The hostess then notified us we could sit at the bar where there was a full menu. Now I worked in the industry for nearly 10 years, if there was a true wait where the place was full you could have given me that option right away before allowing me to sit there for 30 minutes. My husband then intervene pointing out all the people sat before us who came in after we did and the hostess just looked at him like she had popped a few too many pills. A young man then came up (who would be our server), begging the front to seat him. The restaurant was half empty when we went back yet they were telling people 30 minutes!

  Now on to the food, Guy you have to be joking right?!!? Flavor town? Did you leave it behind when you came to Vegas? Everything we ordered was bland. I ordered the rock shrimp tacos (crispy) the shrimp was mushy and our server suggested we put lime over everything to ""bring out the flavor."" First off, the lime which was put on a grill was dried out and there was no juice left, if you have to put lime over everything to ""enhance flavor"" run because there probably isn't any to begin with. My husband ordered one of their ""overly priced $18 strip burgers"" which we expect to be over priced being locals and eating on the strip but damn it was so bad.  The Yuca fries were dried and when my husband asked for some sort of sauce to mask the taste, our server said it was recommended by the chef to eat them plain. Ya no thank you, one needs sauce just to bite into them because they were so dried out and hard.  The beans and rice that came along with my dish had no flavor. Our appetizer which was some ceviche taco (3 of them were $15) just tasted of straight up lime juice in a hard overly salted shell.

All in all one appetizer, a soda, and two main dishes totaled over $60 not including my husband's beer while we were patiently waiting for our table. Save yourself the trouble and the ding to your wallet and head on over to Flaming Fajitas off of Tropicana and Fort Apache! Maybe I was spoiled growing up in Southern CA but Guy, you travel to better places to eat on your show then your own place you stuck your name on. Your eatery is hundreds of miles of way from ""flavor town.""",iXJSKY9JDBBbiKsgkQC0jw,4,1,2,DE6gHuwOxnmBtgFnAtFOkw

A group of friends decided to go and try it out since all we have been hearing about was that the trash can nachos was something we absolutely needed to try. So we decided to go and before you know it we had a group of 10 people! (We roll deep!)Lol!

This place is located inside the Rio hotel and Casino, not far from the main entrance. It opens at 5pm and closes at 11pm so if you want to try it out, plan accordingly. The restaurant it self has a good vibe, and has a lot of cool decor on the walls and has a cantina style feel. I want to give you guys a heads up and tell you about the attire, this place has big window walls that over looks the pool area so don't be caught off guard if you see guest in there with shirts, and bathing suits. I'm not gonna lie, that one threw me off guard just a  bit since your use to the no shoes, no shirt, no service policy in many places but what the hey right, it is Vegas and it is the Rio!

Now, the good stuff, the food! The trash can nachos we came for, the reason for being at the Burro Borracho! The larger size Trash can nachos will cost you $32 you have a choice of meats which are on the Menu. It is suppose to feed up to 5 people....yeah well if your a Yelper it will feed two people! The trash can nachos were good, it was more of the fact that they were presented to you in a Large tin can which makes the experience cool, and different. To be honest you can probably go to a mom and pop shop and get the same quality for a whole lot less. 

The desserts that were ordered look like good portions, and those were something two people could share. I didn't actually taste them because I was too full for desert but they looked very pleasing, the churros looked good, as did the deep fried ice cream.

I had the cheese enchiladas. I don't know. It was all just forgettable. Our server was older and awkward. She seemed out of her element. I question the hiring.

On our last night, after a long day walking up and down the strip and coming off the free shuttle from Harrah's, we wanted some late night bites but didn't want to leave the property again. We opted for Guy Fieri's El Burro Borracho for chips and salsa and fried ice cream. My party enjoyed the chips and salsa, which were served in rectangular strips and came lightly seasoned. The salsa had a little bit of kick to it too, which was a nice surprise. If it's your first time dining here, make sure to check in on Yelp to get chips and salsa for free. As for the dessert, it was a bit disappointing. With it being closing hour on the late night menu (up to 11pm), I appreciate getting seated and being able to order what we wanted. However, I would skip the fried ice cream and go for the churros or flan, which sounded good too. The quality of the ice cream was not the greatest, and with it being served in such a large scoop, we could barely finish half, even with the three sauces poured on top. I have had other fried ice cream desserts at American Mexican restaurants which were much better. 

Other than that, the serve was excellent! Our waitress was Rochelle, and she was happy to give us menu recommendations, chat with us a bit about things to do on our next trip to Vegas, and share about Guy Fieri's visits to the restaurant every now and then. Even at 10pm, she was friendly, high energy, and super helpful. She even gave us an extra basket of chips after we paid! Definitely a great service experience, even if we ordered just two items.

The tacos were okay. The meat was seasoned pretty well and had flavor, but these tacos just didn't do it for me. They were decent, but I can't say that I loved them or that it is something that I absolutely must have again.

Just kidding. This place is alright. It's situated inside the Rio hotel so everything is likely to be more expensive. For instance, a miller lite costs $6.50. We walked in because of the Guy Fieri name and how the logo made his skin look very discolored and pale, kinda creepy actually hahaha. (The donkey with the sombrero image is also kinda out there)

The inside is what you'd expect from a more bar type establishment, plenty of seating and a large selection of alcohol. The waiting staff were friendly and the quality of service was certainly satisfactory.

They have pretty tasty chips that go well with the salsa and the food is also average. My buddy ordered the house salad and it's really nothing to write home about. 

NOW MY FRIENDS, let me tell you about their lemonade; it's spot on! (I'm a huge lemonade fanatic) I instantly fell in love with the drink!

I showed up in Las Vegas with a bunch of restaurant suggestions from a foodie friend, only to be undone when a member of our group discovered this place and announced she loves Guy Fieri and all his TV shows and couldn't eat anywhere else. I grumbled and relented.

The meal got off to a good start when we were seated quickly, but also carefully - there were several large groups that night, and the host wanted to be sure we didn't feel lost or ignored seated behind them. We got a big comfy table and had no problem getting served - plenty of attention all evening.

We started off with some chips (tip: check in on Yelp for a free order!) and salsa, which I liked, and which seem to have been bottomless as refills kept appearing. I got a plate of street tacos, which were just the right amount of spice for me. There was a side of rice and beans and I don't know what they did to the rice but it was so well seasoned that it really stood out - I'd honestly go back just to have it again!

My friends ordered the Tres Leches cake for dessert and holy smoke - do not order if you're on a diet! It is huge, rich, creamy, delicious, and topped with a delightful crunchy toasted coconut. We shared it among five of us and it was just the right amount - a few bites are all you need, given how rich it is.

Sadly, the woman in our group who wanted to eat there in the first place was disappointed with the experience. The two of us who didn't really want to eat there? We loved it. Go figure.",auAs9H2-PBZavrM9xjOXug,0,2,4,uysMPvJoy-rJn_f1h-TTlw

Six tables remained uncleared during the one hour that I spent there. Never once did I see anyone clearing tables. Patrons stacked up dishes on nearby tables to make room and dealt with surfaces that hadn't been wiped down. It took forever for food to be ready and orders were coming out in the wrong sequence.

We asked for spicy salsa to help with the flavor, but were told we could use the bottles on our table (same bottles I have at home) and if we wanted fresh salsa then it would be $4. What Mexican restaurant charges for a side of salsa? Isn't this an item that's always given for free in Mexican restaurants?

Service was friendly but slow, and although the server let us know the kitchen was behind due to higher than normal patronage, I'd estimate only 60-70% of tables were occupied.  We were there over 2 hours and waited 30 minutes between the salad and off-the-cobb elote. 
Elote takes about one minute to assemble, less time if it's coming from a pot of seasoned corn drizzled with crema and garnished with cotija & cilantro. Ours was late and cold, not sure if it was supposed to be served cold or not. 
But I digress...
The highlight of the meal was the Trash Can Nachos, as seen on numerous food porn posts, this is the way God intended nachos to be made and they didn't disappoint. 
The margaritas were large and filled with tasty mixers and fruits/veggies but they were light on actual tequila which was disappointing at $15 a pop. Guy, this is not how you make them on TV!
When my super large dinner platter arrived, everything except the beans and tortillas (carne asada, pollo, enchilada, rice) was luke warm and under seasoned. I ate about half the dish but declined a take-home box. It wasn't delicious at the restaurant, and I couldn't imagine it would improve after a day in my refrigerator. 
Bottom line, in my humble opinion, is this is a decent place to pop in for happy hour (or late night nibbles) at the bar. Get the nachos and your usual cocktail, don't bother with the rest, unless Guy himself is there to make the cocktails and expo the food.

Everyone enjoyed their drinks and their meals all around. A solid joint for some quality Mexican cuisine!",-AGLoncQKBFVYCkfe59Hmg,0,0,4,5bhplI56YpzjC6jBI0HfGw
5871435,2016-03-12,1,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"this is my very first yelp review and I am glad it is a good one. On 3/10 my friends arrived in las vegas and they were staying at the RIO. I went to meet them for dinner and we decided to try this place out. the decor was pretty cool, the mural painted outside was nice but I think they need signs cause if your not looking for it you may miss it. we approached the hostess and was immediately told it would be a 15 minute wait. which I was a bit confused about since the restaurant was not that busy. I asked if they could page us so we could walk around instead of just standing there but they said they had no system in place for that since they just opened. Finally we are told our table was ready and we were seated near the bar, our server approached right away and was crazy cool right off the bat. 
she said they called her ""bigred"" and she would be taking care of us, she started to tell us about the drinks and food but there was alot and it all sounded good so not being able to deside she said she would make it easy and asked us to trust her and she would bring us what she would have. so we said what the hell we are in vegas lets go with it. she came back with some bad ass margaritas, they were sweet and spicy, then we had the a shrimp cocktail to split and she gave me a deep fried burrito that was so freaking good! I have never gone to a restaurant and just let the server order for me but I have to say I would do it again. it was fun, i never knew what to expect with each course. i must also mention the currios....OMG they are a must try! So to sum this up our experience was a great one. the food and the service were top notch. bigred made us feel like we were guests at her party, she made us laugh and choose great food and drinks. Thanks red for kicking our night off right! and since I am local I will be back and will bring friends and I can't wait to see what she serves us next. 
so yup this place is five stars!",xpUM32Ybdw80k_7opF3BFg,0,1,5,8KYZ9y_rmZeZNS-meKG0Rw

We arrived just before they officially opened for dinner, but the gracious hostess offered us a table in the bar area for happy hour until the dining room opened.  Once open, we opted to sit at the bar that overlooks the kitchen staff whipping up the masterpieces!  What a show!  And they were very friendly and engaging, even though they were very busy.  We ordered the fresh guacamole (excellent) and the queso fundido (BEST THING EVER) as appetizers.  Our entrees (we shared) were one of the GIANT (I'm talking the size of a football) beef burritos, pork enchiladas & the mango / jicama salad (which was so tasty and a fantastic balance to the heaviness of the other entrees).  Then for the best part of the meal... the CHURROS!!!!  They are so light and fluffy, not too sugary and they have some sort of spice (cayenne pepper maybe) to give them a slight edge.  I will go back to this place FOR SURE next time I'm in Vegas and will start with the Queso & Churros.",hzWwPJu9yOeYw5zpLxz4ew,0,0,5,qHp_yhPE8qjaz4nbuNnFnw

The ""pork and roasted corn"" had no corn. When we asked if we got the right tacos the waitress explained the corn is hit or miss, sometimes you get it sometimes you don't. One taco had two kernels and the other two had zero. She wasn't kidding. The margaritas were okay, I had the caliente margarita but the was no caliente. They also served the margarita in a beer stein. Wasn't at all impressed and the prices are way over what they should be for that type of food. Also the tacos are poorly constructed. They put the shells in the holders and then throw all the toppings across the top so when you pick them up the toppings either fall off or it's only on the center taco. Wouldn't go back and really wouldn't recommend. You're in Vegas, there's an abundance of good Mexican food, save your time, money, and appetite for someplace better.",ZESa3rP6i5doBFgtFCwupA,0,0,2,BBLJW8celD-9ClD0DP2Rcw

The chips are ok but the molcajete style salsa was very blend it tasted like raw tomatoes.  Then i ordered the borracho platter. To start of the bean were bad like if they were discomposed  i ordered the fish tacos and fish a la plancha. Both fishes had a veru fishy smell and the were very dry inside eith no flavor at all. I guess the only ok thing was the cheese enchilada. Very dissapointed that it was a bad experience will never recommend this place or come back,_hSr7sJXBwBlBVV3juJqWQ,0,0,1,NTSajILwgINO7MpKFuMX8Q

The chicken tortilla soup was basically canned enchilada sauce poured over chicken chunks.. So strong you couldn't eat it. The chips were over cooked with no salt added.  As for the shrimp cocktail, Presentation was very pretty, however you could not get to the sauce unless you deconstructed everything, and of course you had no where to put what you had to remove. Five rubber  shrimp for $20   Not my idea of a good thing. Wish we had looked at  the previous reviews before going.  We will not back.

Watered down margaritas, plain tasting tortilla corn chips, dimly lit eating areas, and too little flash for too much cash. From the foothills of the Sangre de Cristos and Rockies, I'm familiar with great margaritas. I'm just not impressed at all. Maybe I hoped for too much. There are plenty of Mexican restaurants that can do it as good or better. Guy has a very limited menu here, especially what they call late night, 9pm. This is Las Vegas right?  It feels like they are trying to shutdown the place long before close. I don't think this installment of Guy's style will be a success unless some more radical tastes and exotic ingredients are added. One thing that really works here is that the desserts are good here. Otherwise, this one you can skip. Head for The Pink Taco happy hour at the Hard Rock Casino for a rock glam Mexi-Vegas tequila experience.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,2,2,3,z7vRcK85ilb6FvrCA0rNmQ

We were undecided where to eat, but settled on Guy Fieri's new restaurant.

Expectations WAY exceeded. Jalapeño infused Caliente margaritas to start...perfect heat, but nice and smooth. Chips and salsa were zesty. My wife had the mango jicima salad and loved it. My vegetarian Tacos were outstanding...smokey and full of flavor. Our son devoured the fish tacos. Too full for dessert. Service was outstanding. Be sure to ask for Violeta.

When we arrived, the greeters were wonderful. We told them we were a party of 6, and when they would leave to check on a table, another person would come up and asked if we had been helped.  

The lady who sat us was wonderful...she made suggestions on what to get, and was very friendly.

Then we met our server. We waited about 5 min till a server came over. She finally did..and we told her we wanted the Trash Can Nachos with Carne Asada.  We didn't see her again for about 10 min...and we never got asked if we wanted anything to drink. I had to flag her down to order one. We barely saw her after we finally ordered our food, no refills on the water we had to ask another server for. We saw her when we wanted to order a dessert, and the bill. We were there as part of a group with a discount wristband...where we were supposed to get 15% off the bill...she said it was only 10% off of my personal entree. She was very rude about it.

Now....for the best part...the food.  The Trash Can Nachos were amazing!!!! There were 6 of us and we still didn't finish them...huge portion!!!

5971543,2016-03-08,1,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"The first thing to note is that there is NO SIGN for this restaurant.  And to further confuse things, the staff refers to everything and everywhere in the restaurant as 'flavortown' - clearly a Guy catch phrase.  You'll also notice that the staff nearly makes a poor Guy impression through your stay, giving that 'hey, I'm cool and relaxed and this place is HIP' vibe - only it's not genuine at all.  How neurotic is Guy that he imposes his personality on the staff?... 

The food is actually quite pleasant! We had two of the Mexican infused burgers and the guac, it was truly great.  I would eat it again and recommend!  The only downside to the food are the chips - they're stale, hard, and flavorless.  If I didn't need a vessel for the delicious guac, I would have avoided them at all costs.

The wait staff was somewhat of a toss up here.  Our waiter was Ok, they were speedy and stayed on top of things.  

However, the management is clueless.  During our entire meal, the general manager and bar manager hosted a vendor (Shane) who was selling a drink infusing gimmick so they could start making Mules at the bar- he was loud, right next to us and we couldn't even hold a conversation.  The bar manager even asked how we were at one point - when we pointed it out she responded with ""oh cool, yeah we're trying to make Mules"" - hardly the appropriate response to a complaint.  You'd think they would do business deals and host sales events outside of operating hours.  

Overall I would give the food a 4, atmosphere a 2 and the staff a 2.5.  In short - order your food to go.",-buUufCa2So-2lKdeBrxCA,3,2,3,IUI3wPLdQqY-v2-xBdyCJg

Having opened/worked with several Mexican Food concepts/restaurants, I expected more from this restaurant. The three star rating is for service that lacked and some of the food items that we ordered were very bland (especially for Mexican food)... Here is our experience...

We arrived at the restaurant inside of the Rio Hotel/Resort around 6:15pm on a Sunday. We greeted by a nice hostess who wrote our name on a notebook and said it would be about 15 mins... While we waited we admired the Chef's jarred salsa and publishings. My wife and I owned a Salsa business for several years before selling in 2010 ( www.salsatimoteo.com )... Our name was called by a second hostess who wasn't as ""personable"", but she explained the Fieri Swag and the Tequila bar... 

Once sat we were greeted by ""Lada""... Very personable lovely little lady... She said we can call her ""Enchilada"", very cute... Having owned a Salsa Biz, we ordered the Salsa Verde and Habanero salsas to try at $4 for about 2-3 ounces of sauce in a small dish... The salsa that is complimentary with the first basket of chips is tasty (as well as the 2 salsas that we ordered)... At the time of ordering the salsas, my wife ordered a Mango Mojito and I had a Pepsi.. Took about 11 mins to get the Mojito (no kidding)... The wife said the drink was very tasty despite the wait...

On to dinner... My wife had the Picadillo Street Tacos...The meat was very bland and almost flavorless and the other disappointing part was that they used ""pre-formed"" hard taco shells for these ""street tacos""... Pretty disappointing from what we are used to out in Arizona..

I had the Pork Green Chile Enchiladas and the Pozole (I love Pozole)... The enchiladas presented warm at best... Plate was not warm either, which may not be Guy's style but sue helps with quality... The Pork Green Chili was tender and decent flavor, but where was the Chile??? Definitely not enough Green Chile in this recipe... The Tomatillo sauce was ok too... Didn't wow me at all... The Pozole was a 2-3 stars too.. Again, not enough flavor or Chile (not heat chile but flavor chile)... When I eat Pozole, the broth should stain my lips so that when I use my napkin, it wipes ""chile-red""... Again, disappointing...

With prices being charged for the food ($5 for a Pepsi), I would expect better service and much better food!!

Definitely underwhelmed and I would be happy to help Guy out with some Restaurant visits out here in Arizona... I even have some original old Skool recipes that are amazing!!",HjSRzfDNEPQiEahrDPkjrw,4,0,3,EZLICExCFBxfItoSyEtnQg

5995126,2017-04-28,3,fuW-VCynECpKukrm-9nxdg,"I had high hopes for this restaurant given that Guy Fieri is from the Food Network. He must know everything about Mexican food as he's tried many of them from all across the national. But something was totally lacking from this restaurant to which I felt like was not a great reputation of the celebrity. 

Honestly, if I wanted similar food at an affordable price, I would go to Roberto's. My girlfriend got a burrito that costs about $21 which did not do justice in the flavor. Remember guys, just because it's expensive, doesn't mean it's delicious. I learned that the hard way last night when I found myself paying a lot of money for mediocre food. I got the chicken mole enchilada which started off delicious but lost its touch halfway. Not sure how that worked out. Maybe it lacked seasoning? Nothing was memorable about this entree and I can attest to you that I've had better. It was very basic to say the least. 

For appetizer, we got the jalapeño poppers which we thought was going to be like the one from Gordon Ramsay's BURGR. We were wrong. It was too breaded and you can just tell that it was sitting in the fryer for wayyyyy too long. Not a fan because it was bland. 

The service was great, but it looked like she was too busy tending to other people. I felt sorry for her seeing her running around as she made sure everyone was happy. Towards the end of the meal, she took a while to get to us which was understandable. 

After our meal, we decided not to get dessert even though the bread pudding sounded delicious. We really just didn't want to get disappointed anymore. 

Now, I just have buyer's remorse. Don't be like me; just go get Smash Burger.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,8,4,2,_ED6_JBO9gGfi1Wu3Ars6w
