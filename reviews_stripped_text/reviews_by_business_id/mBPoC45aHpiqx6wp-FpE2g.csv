I asked for it all to be remade because i hate eating reheated food. It returned and the server told me that it had been remade. Ok so the patty before i sent it back i had picked some parts out. It returned and claimed
To be freshly made. NO. it was reheated. Because it was hot in the inside and hard on the outside how food gets when its nuked. And had the parts is picked out on it it was the se patty. Altogether good suckeddddd.  I will never return and neither will the other 5 people i came with.

I've passed this place a ton of times but finally decided to stop in a see.

The decor sorta feels like a living room, which is a little strange, but it was comfortable so it works. We saw the happy hour appetizer menu and with everything $5, decided to pick three.

Pretzel bites with cheese - SOOOOO GOOD. That cheese is out of this world. 
Artichoke dip - Definitely not like any I had had before but it was really good as well. It also comes with chips and pita bread so it's nice to have a choice.
Chicken Skewers with Peanut Sauce - Pretty simple but had a little kick. Good as well!

1533296,2010-07-19,2,mBPoC45aHpiqx6wp-FpE2g,"Lets just start by saying I will never recommend this place. I went today with my girl since we had a coupon from the Valupak and figured we can try something new. We get there and sit down and it took almost 10 minutes before our waitress came to greet us. She asked first for our drink order and I asked for Iced Tea, she told me they were out and she only had an hour left on her shift so she didn't want to make any. But yet the table across from us they were all enjoying glasses of Iced tea. Then I decided to try their NY Strip and shrimp special which is supposed to come with a baked potato, but she once again said they were out of baked potatoes but again another table next to me which came in after received a baked potato with their meal, weird right??? Another thing was the table next to us asked her for tarter sauce, and she replied that they didn't have tarter sauce since they didn't serve fish on the menu. The customer then asked if they didn't have fish then why was there a fish sandwhich, BBQ Salmon, and fried Tilapia on the menu. She then replied saying that ya its on the menu but they never sell it so never make tarter sauce for it. What kind of answer is this right? Obviously we were at a bar so we both weren't expecting a great meal, and big surprise... the food quality was poor. The corn on the cob was nasty and over boiled, and nothing really had flavor. Lastly when it came to paying, we tried to use the coupon we received which was buy one meal get one free. She told us since I ordered the daily special they can't honor the coupon even though my girlfriends meal cost more. But if I would of picked a meal that was on the regular menu that cost more then it would of been free. I was like Really? They would rather give me a free $12 meal versus an $8 meal.  I'm no mathmetician but they should be happy I wanted the cheaper meal free. So like a fellow reviewer said, the coupons must be a scam since they wouldn't honor ours either.  So in a nut shell.... The service was awful and the food wasn't worth the money.

The service was ok, though very slow. And the food just seemed to take way too long to come out. 

We started off with the appetizer combo platter. It definitely all seemed like it was something that was just popped in the microwave. The wings were decent. The jalapeno spinach dip was actually pretty tasty. Everything else was a fail.

For entrees, we had the BBQ beef sandwich and the BBQ burger. The sandwich was ok. Not too bad on flavor. And I even enjoyed the pasta salad that I chose as the side. The burger, however, was barely edible and the fries were left almost completely untouched.

Now, there could be other menu items that are great. The BBQ flavors were decent enough that I would try other BBQ menu items. And the breakfast part of the menu did have some tasty sounding things.

My wife and I like to try new places so we use various sites like yelp and restaurants.com to get reviews and deals in places we don't usually eat at. I checked restaurants.com and saw a deal close to the house for this place...I've driven passed bomas about 900 times and never even gave it a thought. It's always seemed like a crappy neighborhood bar and there's never anyone there. I said why not, it's probably slow and I can get in and out. I called and tried to order off what I thought was their menu...it was linked to their website and restaurants.com so I didn't think anything of it. The lady in the phone said everything I tried to order was on their old menu and they didn't have it anymore. I told her id look again and call back. I found another menu link on their website, called back, and gave it another chance. This time yet again they didn't carry those items again...it was only a sampler and a sandwich!! And they didn't have it. So I just ordered the most basic bar food I could think of, fingers and a steak sandwich. She told me they don't make a steak sandwich anymore, but she can ask the kitchen. She said it would be ready in 15 mins. I get there and there's maybe 8 cars there...it's Friday night at 8pm. There's people dealing drug's in the parking lot.. this is by Rhoads ranch btw...so that has to tell you how much of a drag this place is. When you walk in there's a restaurant side and a bar side. I sit in the restaurant side since I ordered food and there's only 5 people there at two tables. I waited for 10 mins before someone came out of the back to tell me they couldn't help me and I had to go to the bar. I go to the bar and waited for 10 mins until the bartender came and asked me what I wanted ..there were only 4 people there! I said in here for a pick up..she told me ok and had the guy from the restaurant side bring over my food. She comes over with the bill and I hand her my card and the certificate..she tells me that I can't use it for take out. Now just to make this clear, I read the certificate all the way through including the fine print and it does not say that anywhere in there. I didn't argue because I'm not a crazy cheap bastard....plus I can just exchange it on the site I got out from which is a great feature. I paid and left...I even tipped. Now the moral to my story is..this is las Vegas, I live in the south west ..there are about 150 places around my house I would gladly of paid full price for..this crappy little bar with poor customer service and even worse food is not one of them...and I would urge you not to as well.

we sat on the bar side, wasn't too smoky and we could vape at the bar. very friendly!! will go back when I'm craving a burger again.",KfEiBR-KaeT6NLBgm81j0Q,0,0,5,fMhFzvOI1_RsW939ibaGMQ

Very updated design-wise (felt contemporary, yet comfortable) with a good variety of food stuffs on their menu.  I went with the crispy chicken salad and I loved it....loads of spinach, perfect crispy chicken (not just a cut up chicken tender) and a delicious dressing ( come to find out they make all of their dressings in house!).  Some better than average Pinot's on their list too.  You can tell by taste and quality that someone thought hard about the food in this place and wanted to make this a highlight to an otherwise gaming bar.  

My husband and I loved this local gem and we will absolutely be back.",QGtuYyH2w_R1r-X5BGmgzw,0,0,5,fTsk7_7Dn-1416z5Dn51Ng

The service was excellent, and considering that the event was quite a large number of people, the staff managed to keep everyone's drinks full and get food out at a very reasonable pace.
I had chicken fingers (hot) and french fries, very good, and excellent ranch dressing. If you eat hot chicken fingers with ranch dressing like me, you know that good ranch is key.

While the menu is mostly standard bar fair, she puts a nice fresh spin on the preparation.  Food is hot and fresh and cooked nicely.  Some of my favorites are Chicken Picata, Taquitos, Chicken Caesar wrap, and Nachos. If you're out and about late, stop in for a bite and a drink.   The bar machines pay  good and the drinks are good too.  The only reason I didn't vote 5 stars is I don't love their sweet and sour bar mix so that means I have to choose drinks without that ingredient.  My husband has happy hour beer here and a late afternoon snack. He loves the ease of access and all the sports showing on TV.  If you haven't tried this place in a while, give it a chance.  Drink Eat and be happy.  It has a great lounging area and pool tables too.

$5.95 Steak Special- This is a monthly special that seems to not expire.  For a very reasonable price you get a very poor cut of meat (appx 6 oz), but it is wonderfully seasoned.  I opted for the Mashed Potatoes and Gravy and it also included a healthy portion of brocolli, carrots, and squash.  Excellent meal for the price.  I was quite impressed.

My better half had a Veggie Sandwich and she complimented it more than once.  She made it clear that she would definitely order it again, so a decent option for the more health conscious.

I even called while sitting in the restaurant area just to double check they were open.  After taking our drink order and app order we didn't see her again for another 15 minutes!  Both times she came back to our table someone from the restaurant went and got her.  Food was ok but not great. They were super lazy and put the toothpick with the plastic stuff on it upside down in my sandwich so I had blue plastic pieces in my food.  The pretzel bites appetizer was pretty yummy though.

I go with the Chicken Piccata ""Chicken breast sauteed with white wine, garlic, lemon juice, capers and fresh mushrooms.  Served with roasted red potatoes and vegetables."" for $14.95.  I was actually surprised with how tasty my chicken was, and for it being the breast part, it wasn't dry at all.  My potatoes were quite the red ones that were advertised, but it served it's purpose.

The Big F ordered the Ribeye Steak ""A 14 oz. steak with cracked black pepper and garlic then broiled to your specifications, served with baked potato and vegetables."" for $22.95.  It was actually too big for him and he had leftovers! 

Our dinners also came with soup or salad.  Soup of the day was cream of mushroom and it was a tasty soup alright.  Lots of cream in it and I almost regretted that I chose the salad instead.  I had requested for the dressing on the side, but it ended up on top.  The vinaigrette was pretty tasty over my salad though.  The Caesars salad is an option too.

Service was standard.  Our waitress looked like she may have been handling something else other than the two tables because she looked overworked.  

Overall, a simple meal in a simple place.  Nothing special, but it worked for us.

We ordered a few simple sandwiches from the menu, had a few simple requests (hold the mayo, hold the onions, mushrooms etc). Every single food item was wrong. Cup of chilli was hotdog chilli quality, cold and loaded with raw red onions, two of the sandwiches had mayo and onions, neither sandwich listed mayo as an ingredient on the menu, but NEVERTHELESS we made sure to let them know that we don't want mayo or onions on ANYTHING. 

There was mayo and onions on EVERYTHING and awful little rubber mushrooms on the dog food quality steak. The soup was also cold and quite boring.

On top of that, this bar is an absolute dump, the staff is completely disinterested in everything, and the bar is loaded up with career drunks and gambling addicts who stare daggers at every unfortunate female who happens to come through the doors, like a bunch of date-rape predators.

What's weird in this town is that a couple of bars that actually had great food went out of business and those that serve the typical burgers and appetizers maintain a steady clientele, go figure.

Anyway, I ordered the ribeye steak medium rare, it came out medium well. Sweet potato tots were good, baked potato- alright.

Shrimp scampi and the angel hair pasta a little dry...I think you could go to a second rate buffet that has a live cooking station (Red Rock, Silverton) and get a better shrimp scampi over angel hair.

I guess my mistake was to go for the entrees expecting a good dinner when it's really a place to grab nachos and burgers and other finger food so I won't really burn them for it.

This is just an ok place to catch a bite and a beer in the area, but if you stay within the confines of spending $35 bucks here (including your beer), you'll actually get away with a pretty cheap meal.

I went with my usual wings + side salad no carb meal, and the wings were nothing special.  Flavor wise they were good (but it's hard to screw up hot sauce and butter), but crunch wise they were a little soggy.  My husband's food was forgettable, so much that I forgot what he ate.
