785858,2016-02-21,0,6a3n4Hd0niHndoPywSkb7Q,I came upon the Red Ribbon Bakeshop when I was waiting for Rocket Fizz to open just down the strip mall. I went in to see what types of bake goods were there. I've heard of Jollibee from Buzzfeed but I had no clue that they were housed in the same building. My eyes mostly when to the bread wall than the cakes (those the mango cake slices looked inviting). I love mocha so I bought the Mocha sponge cake and the Taisan chiffon slice. The taisan was kind of dull. Very light sponge and not very flavorful. The mocha sponge was great! It had the taste of mocha and was also very light despite being 240 calories (Got to put in extra work at the gym). My visit was very nice and I look forward to trying other things.,4KQ_INZcDdjC8xw5p0nDrw,0,0,3,o2xkhxTNLBbFIUQ7HchWuw

1416507,2017-09-10,0,6a3n4Hd0niHndoPywSkb7Q,"The only thing I get at Red Ribbon (and you have to call 24 hours ahead) are the specialty cakes. When I have an office party the Mango cake is always a hit, not too sweet and not too tart. If you need it decorated it's best you go in and spell out the name to go on the cake (it's ok if it's as simple as Mike) as sometimes things get lost in translation over the phone.

As far as service, it's always a hit and miss as the counter help is never the same and they seem to always act like space cadets when they're ringing up your order. I believe this has more to do with lack of training versus lack of trying.",hazFjLv3rVO_9V9wSQ55Gw,1,0,3,I12yZUoan1Hpo-H5YbR55g

I stopped in with the bf the other night for some dessert. Luckily, they had just what I wanted... slices of ube cake and mocha chocolate crunch. We had just stuffed our faces for dinner elsewhere, so we ordered some slices to go and headed home. Once I was able to change out of my slacks and put on some sweat pants, I dug right into the cakes.

Sadly, they didn't live up to what I had experienced before. The mocha chocolate crunch lacked the mocha and the crunch. And both cakes were dry and missing a bit of the sweetness.

I've had wonderful cakes from here before, so I'll come again to see if I can get what I've been craving.",5OW5HpsyZe1-hoxHHZKbsA,2,1,3,WC_t8qLmUTGuPSK47pDCQg

I don't care for the ube cake everyone here raves about, but the vivid color is cool. The mango bar is sweeter than expected but not off-putting. 

But the empanadas are where it's at! Both times I've been in, they only had beef available so I have yet to try the chicken. Empanadas are kept in a warmer and a good size for the low price. Will continue coming back for these!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,3,3,JkgcU3t9B3wwuVfc7FtCpg

We also love buying mamons here for our kids but it sucks because when you open the wrapper and remove the mamon, top of the mamon is all gone left with the wrapper lol!!! I hope they can improve that issue.

By the way...
Make sure when you're buying a cake you come at a early time and not when it's almost closing time and you watch where they get the cake from and not from the display. I was not a happy customer when my hubby brought the cake home. 

Also for any last minute occasion when buying a cake and having it with greetings/lettering for the occasion, don't buy the mango cake (we all know mango cake is yummy) because the greetings/lettering will melt away, move in all different directions or all letterings will combine as one. 

When buying a cake, buy it early morning is the best and always ask when do new cakes comes - so you know how long the cake is good for.

Enjoy the rest of the goodies",rUZjcflekmf7Igd2UNFrUg,0,0,3,swAfSOd5u5MaXph5H73bOA

We came here specifically for the ube cake because I didn't know such a thing existed. I am a huge fan of ube ice cream, so I had to try the cake out for myself. We left with the ube and the mango cakes. The cakes were spot on for the flavors, but the moisture was lacking. The mango was much more moist that the ube, maybe because they were pre-sliced and refrigerated.

2865438,2013-11-17,0,6a3n4Hd0niHndoPywSkb7Q,"Red Ribbon serves a few Filipino dishes but is mainly known as a bakeshop so don't expect their meals to be that great. The dinuguan (pork blood stew) lacked meat and was too soupy and the palabok (filipino rice noodle dish) is mushy like it was cooked in a microwave. It's best to get these dishes at an actual Filipino restaurant. The bakeshop, however, has some pretty good fare. Some cakes are better than others but one must try their ube(purple yam) cake. I suggested it to a friend and she loved the novelty of it. It has a very light and sweet flavor. I like taking home the different sponge cakes, also called mamon, and the sweet brioche or ensaymada. Just make sure to check the expiration dates on the pre-packaged goodies because they have a short shelf life.",HVa84WqQT5Klz4knWtGBqw,3,1,3,PHqUK6Q4TBYbNRASJkXP-A

I did have a slice of their Rocky Road cake for $2.69 and a slice of banana cake for 99 cents.

3433020,2016-01-16,0,6a3n4Hd0niHndoPywSkb7Q,"For a Filipino franchise, this place is great. For a limited menu of Filipino comfort food, it is pretty good, but then again, it might be because I have limited access to Filipino food. If you get a combo of Arrozcaldo (chicken and rice porridge) or palabok combo (rice noodles with sauce) it comes with a slice of cake! Super affordable too!

Now it is also called a bake shop. Cakes are actually delivered from another location. I do recommend when you purchase a cake, ask for the most recent deliveries. I just learned that if the cakes are on sale for 20% off, it's because the cakes are close to 4 weeks old. However, don't let that deter you from purchasing a sheet. Just remember, a year old frozen wedding cake taste as great as it did on your wedding day. I've also learned that cakes that are 4 weeks old are just as good as the recent deliveries.

Depending where you're from, it's a rare occasion that you can get an ube (it's purple) mango or mocha cake.. And the cakes is so moist and not too sweet.

Cakes come in a loaf size that can feed 6 people, 9"" round and the largest is 1/4 sheet. Prices for cakes run between $14 to $25. So although you can go to a grocery store for a less expensive option, impress your family and friends with a delightful cake from Red Ribbon.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,0,0,4,742fBpr5MLMqSEeS5s9LqA
