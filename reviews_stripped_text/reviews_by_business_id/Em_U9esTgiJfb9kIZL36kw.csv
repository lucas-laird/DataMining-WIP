And I never had any issue ever til awhile ago, I arrive around 2309hrs and I ordered two footlongs teriyaki and the new sandwich turkey avocado. Teriyaki was perfect as always, but the turkey is missing ""avocado"" that was the most important thing on my sandwich the ""AVOCADO"" without it's incomplete, I was so dissapointed. I didn't wanna come back for it and beside I'm already home didn't wanna do another trip just for that , so I decided to call them multiple times to let them know that they messed up my order but no answer. Hopefully next time that do better job!",C6STMOoitQCUWtgExK1etQ,0,0,1,k36wI7P6WORT2e4p11h6EQ

697824,2016-03-13,0,Em_U9esTgiJfb9kIZL36kw,Emily the shift manager wasn't very helpful. I saw her use the restroom and then make a sandwich without washing her hands. I would highly recommend you do not go to this Subway on boulder and Russell. And if you look closely behind by the electric box. There are bums doing drugs. Which really worries me and I would probably not recommend eating at the Popeyes that is connected to the same building.,Mi3b37y6bLatxLpLc345EQ,1,0,1,JIlnlyuGCKzbme-spY3ydw

4066381,2016-01-14,1,Em_U9esTgiJfb9kIZL36kw,"Honestly this place is subway lets get real on the reviews people. its not anything but a sandwhich and everytime I've gone the person making my sandwhich asks if it looks okay before they wrap it. Poor kids that work there being open 24 hours in that neighborhood is hard enough, imagine how many people go in messed up and begging for food. Be thoughtful, theyre probably not having a great day. I have never had a problem here, everyone who has made my sandwhoch has been very nice and whenever I give them kindness they return it. I give everyone who works here props!",EIeq1qCpgj_RLfgSXPUG7A,3,2,5,eE_3vMqvKRwyWyC5di1h_Q

The service is consistently fast, and the food is just fine. I've also had no problems redeeming my survey code for a free cookie (if you don't know what that is, check the back of your receipt next time). Preparation seems pretty consistent except for one occasion where they might have skimped a bit on my chipotle mayo. It's kinda small, but aren't they all? Only things stopping this from being a 5 star are that it's a fast food chain restaurant and that the white guy (haven't caught his name) constantly tries to upsell. He asks if you want more cheese and whatnot, and it gets annoying.

Note to self: keep getting my sub toasted because it seems that it's $5.41 for both toasted and untoasted.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,0,0,4,R3d8GcsULfnbLg9Rkb8ffA
4488190,2014-05-20,0,Em_U9esTgiJfb9kIZL36kw,"So here's the deal... Subway is subway. I leave reviews for these chain restaurants mostly based on the location and service. 

The sandwich I got (chicken breast) was about what you can expect for $5. 

The guys working in the back were friendly and fast. Very personable. 

There were some homeless folks right outside, they are here in the shopping center pretty often, not always by the subway, but in the vicinity. I give them a few bucks every once in awhile...if I'm gonna be honest its annoying to see the same three or four able bodied men there week after week. I wish someone would kick them out.",MuYklhk7iLSvwLBLpjC9XQ,0,0,3,H8_8cDlAIQoipibThb9AeA
