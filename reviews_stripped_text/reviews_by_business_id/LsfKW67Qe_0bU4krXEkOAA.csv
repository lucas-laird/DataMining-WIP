We didn't realize this until we got back to our home in California and she told us at 11pm (right at closing time). I tracked her phone with an app and called the restaurant right away. The manager who answered said it wasn't turned in and refused to look for it, even though I told him I could see it was still there. So the next morning I called again and got a new manager this time, LaKiko Spaight. She said she also didn't see it in lost and found but agreed to take my information in case someone found it or turned it in. A half hour later she called me and had found my daughter's phone. I was so happy. But then she did something I didn't expect. She offered to mail it to me. Last night I received a phone call from her that she had just left the post office and paid to send my daughter's phone back to her. I am absolutely going to reimburse her for that cost but I couldn't let that act of kindness go unnoticed. She went above and beyond and my family is so grateful to know people like her still exist in this world. You are so lucky to have her as an employee and she deserves recognition for her kindness.

Fine, whatever it's 6 am on a Monday, everyone can have a bad day. We pull up to the window and she confirms our order before charging us. When my boyfriend checked the receipt however it was way more items than our two hash browns, so we kindly stated that we think she charged us for the wrong order.

Let's try Austria.
McDonald's launched two noodle offerings in Austria in 2012.  This was a world premiere to test consumer demand for the Asian dish.

""McNoodles"" went on sale at its Austrian restaurants in a test, set to last two to three months.

The meals feature noodles with vegetables, chicken, salad and either sweet-and-sour or curry sauce, and will cost around 4.99 euros ($6.56).

The company said it hoped to tap a trend toward noodle dishes and show off its ability to innovate by launching the products, which it will import from Thailand.

Three-quarters of the products sold by McDonald's Austria are developed locally, and the latest experiment was prompted by the growing popularity of noodle dishes there.

U.S.-based McDonald's has 179 restaurants in Austria that generated sales of 515 million euros last year.",EZmocAborM6z66rTzeZxzQ,32,31,2,QJS2soUZ0f_inZTIqAOzkA

Besides waiting 20 minutes for a Big Mac, I witnessed a customer treatening to hit a member of staff. I am not sure what happened as I only arrived when the customer said he would ""hit him later"" and then left.

Then staff members began shouting at each other about using each other's cashier machines. 

It was so obvious that the staff were untrained and completely unprofessional. The manager seemed to have lost control and was berating staff in front of other customers.",k2jH-UirzoElLdLIujb9FA,1,0,1,TCggYj1NkCQ4GrjaAAnXig

The lady who was taking my order was inattentive. I was giving her my orders and I can hear her talking to someone. And then she'll ask me what's my order. wth. I had to repeat myself like 3x. Girl, listen to me! 

So she got my order, finally. Went up to the first window to make my payment. This lady opened her window, did not even say hi or confirmed my total.

Got up to the next window to get my order hoping for a nice lady who will turn my experience into a better one...

We asked if she could switch the menu to the lunch and she said an employee has to do that. So I asked her to read the lunch menu off to us, thinking that she wouldn't do it, and she did! Lol she started reading the entire lunch menu.

Finally we ordered and next issue was drive thru was taking forever! They said they were waiting on the chicken wrap since they just switched from breakfast. So then they make us pull forward to the front so we can wait. We counted 7 cars that got their food and drove thru while we waited for about 10 minutes. 

Finally after a grand total of 20 minutes a lady opens the door and just sticks her hand out with the food. Doesn't say anything, no ""sorry"" or ""here you go"" or ""thank you""

I've never done a 1 star review as I never felt I've had an experience so horrible that warrants that, I always try to find the silver lining and highlight the positive. That has changed as of yesterday at around 3:30 PM, I guess there's a first for everything.

We ordered from drive thru, a part of that order is a PLAIN cheeseburger and a Quarter pound with cheese NO PICKLES. He repeated the order and I confirmed what was displayed on their order monitor. So I drove away thinking everything is good because why wouldn't it be, right? WRONG! I dropped my husbands food to him and left, only to be told by my daughter that her cheeseburger has ketchup. When I checked, it was the total opposite of plain, it had EVERYTHING on it: ketchup, mustard, pickles and onions like I had asked for the total opposite. REALLY??? So I decided to drive back over there since it was on the way. We went inside, I spoke with the manager Alejandra and she gave me a new one. No apologies, NOTHING! She acted like I was the one inconveniencing her. 

I brushed it off, it was not worth my aggravation. Since we were already there we decided to just finish our meal there, then I get a text from my husband informing me they had put pickles on his burger! ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? At this point I was livid already, I went back to the register and asked for the manager AGAIN. I told her they put pickles when I specifically asked for NO PICKLES because my husband is allergic to it. She asked me for the receipt, I told her I threw it away but if she was skeptical, to ask her drive thru employee and he can vouch for my order since we were there not even 15 minutes ago. She then tells me it's their policy not to address any issues without a receipt, no refunds only exchanges. WHAT?!? I have never heard of such policy at a food place. I was disgusted at that point, I told her I didn't want any replacement or my money back but a fair warning as that issue could have gone south fast. You cannot mess around with peoples lives like that. Anaphylactic reactions are no joke, someone could seriously get hurt because your employee decided he/she doesn't really care about their job. I'm pretty sure the franchise owners wouldn't want that kind of mess in their hands. The thing that really irked me the most was her half ass apology and the smirk she had on her face. All I wanted was a sincere apology and she couldn't even give me that, because on top of my husband's would have been allergic reaction had he not check his burger but thanks to them he now didn't have lunch either.

Obviously there is a disconnect between the people that take your order and the ones that actually prepare them. It's not rocket science, read the damn order slip!!! This place is a lawsuit waiting to happen!

Also an advice to the management: PLEASE train your managers properly, they are the face of your company/franchise. Learn manners and how to handle a situation accordingly! UGHHHH!!!",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,11,3,1,ogOEs1GS2N1Yk8qi8eYMhw

So I ordered chicken nuggets since I knew they would have that and before I was done ordering the man cut me off and told me what the total would be. I then told him we had more to order and he gave me a dirty look and took the rest of my order. Eventually he gave us our food and the chicken nuggets tasted as if they had been sitting under the warmer all day and then the quarter pounder my husband received was basically just the meat and bun besides one pickle and like 3 or four small shredded pieces of lettuce.
