I was grossed out and threw it away. My hashbrown seemed too cold and we didnt even bother with the other 2 sandwiches. I would have post a pix but no need all that plus you guys need business!

He is the epitome of an all around great employee who knows how to carry himself, showing a great representation of the establishment. 


So my boyfriend and I pull up to the Jack in the Box that actually looked pretty busy. Mind you, it's 3 AM in the morning. 

As soon as we pull up to the intercom, we get greeted by this really nice guy. Professional, friendly and clearly the perfect man to be working a night shift. I can't tell you how many people we've run into that work grave shift who are completely unhappy to be there....and show it. 

He's totally an easy going mood, making small talk as we wait for our food. We get our food & drive away thinking ""man, that guy was good.""

Unfortunately, there was a confusion with our order. We show back up to the place & Kevin greeted us with the same Welcoming smile that he had our whole experience. He was completely understanding and accommodating about the whole issue and I've honestly never encountered someone with such poise..working at an establishment such as this.

My order was missing my large curly fries... What's a burger without fries!?!?  I know I should have checked my bag before leaving, but after the wait I just wanted to get home. 

If that wasn't bad enough, all the tacos I ordered were mushy, cold, and greasier than usual.

I wish there was another location nearer to me so I could avoid this one but it's down the street from my house so I'm stuck with this location.

This time was 2-fer combo of #'s 2 and 3. I drive up to the speaker and the person behind the mic sounded as if she was hurried and/or English was her second or third language. Now when you order a breakfast combo, they always ask you ""What do you want to drink"" which naturally a person will ask for a soda choice. What they don't say UNLESS YOU ASK is that getting a soda is an up-charge because the drink it comes with is coffee. COFFEE? With hashbrowns or a buttery sandwich? THAT'S DISGUSTING! It should clearly show something either on the menu or they should say it to you. I was headed home so I cold get soda from home so I ordered the coffee anyway for my food order (YUCK!) and drove up to the window. 

When I got there, I thought to add a Jumbo Jack to my order so I could eat it for lunch later. I asked the window person to add it and she looked unbelievably puzzled. She asks me if I want to change my order to which I reply ""No, just add a Jumbo Jack."" Then she goes and calls the mic person I first spoke to in which she says ""You ordered a #23 though"". I asked again, ""I just want to add a Jumbo jack to my order! Is that okay?"" They both reply with a ""Yeah, I guess"" YOU GUESS? So sorry to make you think outside of the realm of a single combo order. I finally get everything, drive off, and arrive home to find my coffee to be lukewarm anyway, just a plain hamburger Jumbo Jack with no toppings or lettuce, and a smashed bun.
