I questioned them why and they said because you ordered to go. I then ask what if I change my order for here can I now please sit? No was his answer because I did not order at a table. I stepped outside trying to avoid further confrontation and As soon as I did I turn around and he is laughing and pointing at me to another employee. Seriously? I am a paying customer at a empty restaurant. So the next thing I know he invited a small group of also ordering to go inside to have a seat at the bar while they waited for their  food.

First, I ordered a margarita pizza and asked the waiter if it came with a red sauce or something else. He didn't know and said that he didn't think it came with sauce so I ordered a basic cheese pizza. Common sense tells me cheese pizza comes with pizza sauce. Obviously not at Sammy's. What I got was Little Ceasar's cheesy bread. 

According to the menu there are multiple locations and I can't image why. DiGornio frozen pizza is better than Sammy's. Besides the taste of the pizza, the waiter wasn't knowledgeable and seemed overwhelmed.  Which means the location at the Vegas airport is under-staffed.  They must do a good bar business.

1379135,2016-02-27,0,FFolUMaFqs8vdu9ybE4-IA,"Good food,  reasonable price. 

Airport food is usally a grab and run affair for me but we decided to stop in Sammy's because it was the only place we could find with vegetarian type food in our corner of the airport. 

The Greek salad is huge. I think it was 8.99. Very good.  I cook and I shop. There was at least 8.00 worth of home shopped ingredients. It was very fresh and easily enough for two people. 

The pizza was surprisingly good and was made very quickly. Getting one special made--without cheese and with ingredients that were not in the menu--was no problem. We just basically said we want a pizza with this and that on it. The pizza magically appeared just as ordered. The silverware was metal and the plates were real. The crust was crispy and good. The pizza was hoping to. It arrived at the same time as our huge salad. 

A couple of other things caught my attention. If you eat in a real restaurant at an airport like Chili's or maybe TGI Fridays the seating is cramped,  there is always a rush,  the menu is small,  and there is no chance to see the food prep area and who might actually be cooking the food. Earing for alot of other places in sitting in a center area like a mall food court. Sammy's has everything in plain sight and the tables are normal sized. The waitstaff and cookstaff were all mature and professional. The restaurant was clean and well laid out. We were not rushed to order or to leave after we ate. It was a peaceful respite from the sterile hustle of the airport,  just a few feet away. They didn't even charge us for our iced teas,  and drinks at the airport are generally ridiculously priced. 

Good restaurant.  Sammy's opened my eyes to the possibility that an airport dining experience for a non drinker vegetarian--beyond a cup of yogurt or fruit--can be a worthwhile experience. Compared to the tiny,  expensive,  offerings of the Starbucks a few feet away,  well,  there was no comparison. Sammy's is also located adjacent to the A Terminal.  So close,  in fact,  that you can see and hear when it is time to go.

I didn't eat here because already eaten, I'm anout to board in a red eye flight.
I ask for a glass of Pinot Noir, you can chose between 6oz, 9oz or the bottle.
Since I'll have a long flight I asked for a 9oz, listed for $ 19.50, not cheap and a small bottle of sparkling water.
When the glass arrived I noticed immediately that it was not 9oz, I sell fragrances and 9pz is more than 250ml, more than a quarter of a liter.
I thought they made a mistake but after tasting the wine I was happy they did because I've rarely tasted such cheap, acid, disgusting wine. That type of wine that takes 30 min to finish a glass because you can barely swallow it.
Well the check arrived for over $ 26.00, ONE glass of wine and a small bottle of water .
I left $ 4.00 tip because I always feel bad for waiters so I ended up to pay $ 30.52 for a glass of cheap/disgusting wine and a small bottle of water.
Is there anything else that I can say?
Yes there is: there was also a light that was keeping getting on and off, perfect to enhance the robery armosphere...

We had a late flight out, and this was one of the only places open.  The sign at the entrance said to wait to be seated, so we waited.. and waited.  Finally, one of the servers noticed us and told us to just sit anywhere. We noticed that many of the empty tables were dirty, but finally found a clean place to sit. We then waited some more. The server came over and apologized, saying they'd been ""slammed.""  He left for awhile longer, then came back to take our order.

I ordered the sliders with cheese ($12 plus an additional $1 or $2, I believe), and one of the ""fancy"" cocktails, and my dining companion ordered a Stella beer.  The food was just okay. The sliders were supposed to have some sort of sauce/aoili on it, but did not, just the cheese. A small container of ketchup was on the side; I had to ask for more.  My drink tasted good, but did not taste like there was any alcohol in it- just like punch. 

The cost- $50!  I have no idea how much they charged for the drinks, as the prices weren't listed, but they must have been quite expensive! I really felt like this was drastically overpriced, even for the airport, and especially because of the experience.  I'll know better next time!",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,0,0,2,ZwoBaWaWij0nToYnQSkKsQ

Not overly clean (pieces of dried food left on silverware in this case we well as silverware and napkins under our ""clean"" table) and no real sense that anyone cares that you are there. But I guess when you have a captive audience, why try?

The positives about this experience were the food - my Mediterranean-influenced grilled chicken salad was very tasty. The chicken was dry but flavorful, the kalamata olives were sliced very tiny, but plentiful and the dressing was light in texture. All over, a great value for the quality and location ($11). My husbands pepperoni pizza was also a nice surprise. The pepperoni had a bit of zing to it and the cheese and sauce seemed fresh in taste. We both had water and found it odd that both glasses came with zero ice. 

Our server was pleasant and while the service wasn't terrific, she sure was better than some service we've had in airports.

So, for the money and considering the location, I'd suggest trying it. They also advertise a dessert of tiny doughnuts with both chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces. That sounded delish, but we didn't partake.",Vw-2QsrVJbxV6JryaxR7_Q,2,1,2,S9iiSAX0rGgVbnbKFFlapA

I also sat next to the server station so I had the extra joy of hearing the servers complain to each other about how slow it was.

Ordered the breakfast pizza with ham, tomatoes, egg, onions and cheese. (That's exactly how the menu words this pizza). 

The place is more of a lunch / snack and dinner type of restaurant at the airport but they do have a couple breakfast items. 

Well pizza arrived with bacon as well (not cooked well done so it was raw/fatty like), and the eggs were scrambled - what jack ass thought that was a good idea. In my mind I saw a fried egg on top of the pizza in the middle as many places do... But not here. Anyway, not to my liking - I kind of picked toppings off and ate those for breakfast.

With that being said let's move to the service side is Sammy's. HORRIBLE !!! My server was more concerned about not missing any of the staff gossip as 7 staff members talked openly in the restaurant  floor about customers, other staff members, and whatever else. They don't have cream or milk for coffee but rather go over to the Starbucks pour some in a plastic cup and pour it into your coffee she actually didn't even see people coming in and sitting down. She passed by my table many times and seeing I was finished didn't ask if I wanted more coffee or how anything was. Finally I flagged her down for my bill actually had to ask again two more times because she got caught up talking with coworkers. Paid for my meal even though it wasn't really even eaten.

After 15 minutes of waiting, my server hadn't even greeted me, or even made eye contact to acknowledge me. I had to approach another server and ask who my server was. 

With this restaurant being in an airport terminal, one would think that they would be able to accurately forecast business with flights and passenger traffic. Not the case at all.

Affordable, tasty, prompt and pleasant. 

The pizza I ordered, Margherita, was delicious. Nice and cheesy with whole, thick slices of Roma tomatoes and freshly chopped basil. It was a thin crusted slightly crunchy, slightly chewy pizza that was perfectly executed. Deeeeelicious!  My mom and daughter had lobster bisque. They devoured it happily and then ordered a Margherita as well. 

My son ordered a grilled chicken wrap. He enjoyed it...the fries, I was told, were like barbecue chips. He polished them off. I tasted a bit of the wrap...it was nice!

The only negative part of my experience was the manager forcing us to pay so he could close our the register.  I wish he had made all of that clear before we ordered additional food.

5022948,2014-02-21,1,FFolUMaFqs8vdu9ybE4-IA,"The wife and I were leaving Las Vegas on a mid-morning flight out of McCarran.  A captive audience in the D Gate area and wanting more than just a cup of coffee, we decided on Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill since they served breakfast and we could sit down, charge our personal electronics, and relax before our flight.  We were greeted by Janet, our personable server, who excelled at keeping our water glasses filled throughout our meal.  Leftover pizza is one of my favorite breakfasts, so it was intriguing to me try a pizza specifically made for breakfast.  My 8 inch pie ($11.49) was topped with a surprisingly generous amount of bacon, eggs, mushroom, cheese, tomato, and onion.  While the crust was very likely not made fresh on premises, it was reasonably crisp given the amount and type of toppings.  It was a much tastier crust than you'd find a Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Papa John's.   Frankly, it was a filling, satisfying breakfast adaptation of pizza that could easily be shared.   

For airport dining, Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill exceeded my expectations.  Compared to your average airport dining experience, it was measurably better than average.  It should go without saying that while I gave it a solid 4 stars, that rating was compared to other airports restaurants catering to a captive audience of air travelers and probably not comparable to other Sammy's stores let alone most of Las Vegas' excellent dining options.

Upon my last trip back home (this last weekend), I was wanting to hit some of my favorite spots, but didn't get to. To my surprise (and delight), there was a Sammy's right next to my departure gate at McCarran (D Gates, Terminal 1)! I also had an hour to kill, so it was like kismet. Or fate. Or whatever. 

SERVICE: It's Christmastime, they were busy, I get it - but first off I have to say the service was lacking. They actually weren't THAT busy, but maybe they were slammed earlier and so they were over it, I don't know. First off, I noticed the host wasn't very attentive to the stand when people were waiting to be seated. I was one of them. My server was the worst though. She looked like she had not smiled in years. I tried to be as polite and easy-going with my few needs (pizza & wine), it's the Holidays, but not once she did she smile, welcome me, thank me, anything! Maybe these are little gestures, but that's just it! They are LITTLE gestures that go a long way. She almost made me uncomfortable they way she stared at me while I ordered. I was sitting next to a couple I also heard complain that the busser came and took his plate away before asking if he was finished - which he wasn't and asked for his side dishes back.

(side note: I overheard my waitress chatting bitterly with the host at a nearby server station about how ""they don't know what they are doing and messing up our schedules"" so I am guessing there are some management issues.)

FOOD: The food & wine I ordered, however, delicious! I ordered a small Chardonnay (to try it, it was good, so I ordered a bigger one after that. What? I wasn't flying the plane). I also ordered the New York Style pizza - yum status. A bit bummed that they didn't have the Gluten Free crust options like I had heard the other Sammy's do, but I figured that was maybe due to airport location, size of menu, etc. I actually didn't feel bloated or sick after eating the crust as I do most often with pizza dough, so I was a happy camper. I scarfed the whole thing down along with my wine and hopped onto my plane home. 

So, that's why the 3 stars.

If my experience had to be Christmas-ized, the food was like a gift from Santa, the service was like a visit from the Grinch!

5935682,2017-05-08,0,FFolUMaFqs8vdu9ybE4-IA,"This place was better than I expected it would be. I liked that the hostess asked us before seating whether we had 45 minutes before boarding, as that was the average duration.

Our waiter was friendly and often checked in with us. He asked us if we were ok with our appetizer arriving at the same time as our entrees, instead of making that decision for us.

Their pizzas were good. We ordered the New York Pizza, the Four Cheese Pizza and the Garlic Cheesebread. The latter was mostly a garlic cheese pizza cut up into smaller pieces. It was not cheesy enough and is not worth the price imo.

Their pizzas however were good. Plenty of toppings on the New York, which had the ideal cheese-tomato balance. The Cheese pizza was very cheesy and flavorful but a bit of tomato sauce would have taken it to the next level. The size of the pizza was a small to medium size pizza elsewhere. If you are really hungry you might want to have one for yourself instead of sharing. 

All in all not a bad experience for an an airport restaurant.",-5Q2O-UsLeTvXxj310AGUQ,1,0,3,rRJuYzNuNRf5blM-1apmfQ

The pizza is ok but overly cheesy and haphazardly made. Unfortunately, there aren't great food options in the LV airport in general. 

Service is a bit slow as well and kept forgetting things. Also, they didn't put any effort into bussing or cleaning the tables. I actually took a photo of the mess of straws and used napkins at my little nook at the end of the bar and uploaded it to Yelp. But then felt photos should focus on the food and took it down. 

In short, I can't see myself coming back here again.",vU7fP7uAWF3os-7woIQAXw,0,0,2,V6w0KlxawW_mxLqzfoh05Q
