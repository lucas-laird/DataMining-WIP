When we walked in we were greeted genuinely, and this location is busy, 2 customers when we walked in and a line after us that lasted til we sat, ate, then left, WOW! The team members were great showed no signs of stress, just smiling faces, helpful and sincere, Food kept being filled in the warmers. We had the noodles, kung pao chicken, spring rolls, and a drink, The food is delicious as always, served hot and flavorful. Panda is NEVER a disappointment!

Regret every penny spent here.
Food was old, fried rice looked like its from yesterday, asked for white rice instead and was still dry and old.
Chicken choice barley had chicken.
Dirty place, stay away.
McDonald's next door is better choice.",U2nuMDTP6u3znQfPWKrJHg,0,0,1,GE3Wcjt1Ckg5dMDtA-8i1g

This place is in the back of casino at the shuttle bus stop, a small corner ""food court"", along with 3 other names.",doUlJJ4JK0LWphe2zVIbMg,0,0,1,Le9d5stLse-31j16VNkbnw

The string beans were dried up, the sweet fire chicken was stale and hard, the chow mein lacked noodles. To make it an additionally horrible experience, no e of the staff were present. We banged on the counter and shouted out.
Only the soda was good!

Food was old ,taste disgusting,rice was dry ,looks like day or two old. Chicken selection was very minimal on the chicken,looked old and greasy.One plate costs $9.

5513402,2013-02-25,1,AiXzyI2Xehh-1yvbB-WcYw,"I try and stay away from Chinese fast food.  I don't know why... it's just who I am.  But, there are times that I can be purely lazy and have a hankering for some Broccoli Beef and steamed rice.  Anyhow, Panda Express is close and easy to get to.  So, here is my review of tonight's visit.:

 - I drive over to Sam's Town, which has the closest Panda Express to me.  I park in the 2nd parking lot, on the ground floor.

 - I walk in to the North East entrance and Panda is right there on the left. 

 - There wasn't a line and I ordered my meal.  I had to wait a couple of minutes as they were replenishing their stock.  So, I had fresh Broccoli and Beef.  Woo Hoo!!!

 - I paid and then left...  easy as that.  

My meal was okay but nothing to give it 4 or 5 stars.  With that said, it's an okay place to go if you are in a hurry and are too lazy to make your own rice.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,2,2,3,TFg_eHeJt15pdcr1-Wlhow

The food tastes old and soggy like It's been at the wrong temperature for days and going. It's strange how can something get old if they are selling quickly. Still I don't care about my money I care about the animals they killed to let food go to waste that's a waste. 

The pieces that should be green on the chow mein were brown. The meat was soggy had quite a side taste and ultimately it felt old. I ended up not eating most of it. 

I told my friend about it she told me her sister got food poisoning from the food at this location. I just ate this 30 minutes ago I have to wait a little...  
 
Should be a while before I know.",Jne7UiKCp_VsSsvh-utyQw,1,1,1,EjrP_rEb8kf10P3hilf-nA
