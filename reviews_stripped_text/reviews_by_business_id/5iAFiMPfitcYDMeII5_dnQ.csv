629745,2017-12-27,0,5iAFiMPfitcYDMeII5_dnQ,"My family is visiting from Hawaii and decided to go shopping at Fashion Show Mall. While here, we got two different cups -- one of the mini pretzel bites & the other being the mini pretzel dogs. At first, there were no problems. But when we started eating the mini pretzel bites, my mom felt something in here mouth. It looked like a broken fake nail or plastic of some sort. Then when she went to show the workers, they tried to tell her to go to the back of the line instead of letting her speak first. So she just said she had to show them something. After she did, the worker just told her coworkers about it and didn't say anything else. Not even a ""I'm so sorry about that"" type of thing. 

We understand that they are busy but we're very disappointed with such bad service. :-(",ML5Jkb-zszlVM4PMo60qJA,0,0,1,dcxm-1D3KORYylLN5R7kMA

I've had many variations of their pretzels... Each time I was more than satisfied! My favorite menu item is the Pretzel Dog. 

The one negative thing I have to say is, the opening crew needs to pay better attention to turning the lights on in time... There have been many times I've had to ask, ""Are you open?""

For a quick snack at the mall, I'd definitely recommend this business. I will continue to do business with them, as long as I am in that mall.",VNYmMD-TYQM0qXdrA_Omhg,0,0,4,QfujxRFArcIiXTgUcOZEzg

I asked the fool if he had any of the other flavors. He goes"" I have all the flavors here, watchu  talkin about?"" He spoke to me like I'm one of his homies. It would've been nice if he explained to me earlier that all he had to do was add the ""flavoring"" to the pretzels in order to have the other flavors. Instead he treated me like I'm dumb and told me that I wasn't listening to him. To make a long story short fool kept on yapping about how he had everything instead of explaining how he has all of the flavors...ticking me off.

I waited about 20-25 minutes. I'm irritated because I would have ordered something else or be less upset if time was accurately provided. The only reason why I didn't get it a 1 was because I still like the food regardless of the wait.

The pretzel was a little harder than what I was expecting, which I assume means that the pretzels have been out a bit longer. It was enough to fulfill my satisfaction, but hopefully I am luckier to get a nice warm pretzel right out of the oven!",Fv8azDg49KaU26FrPLkITA,0,0,3,avEaOsSWACAZikgxiDTxLw

Maybe I reminded her of someone or maybe my glasses offended her? I mean, I guess Im Asian and we do kind of all look similar. Keep in mind I'm a tourist, have no idea who this girl is and I wish I got her name.

Gave me the silent treatment and dirty glare. I asked for dipping sauces and she placed them on top with disgust. When I asked for a water bottle she BANGED the bottle a FEW times for some reason. Maybe to kindly get the condensation off?

After I finished paying, she kindly greeted the next person as loudly as possible just to show that I was obviously undeserving of her kindness. I felt like I was in high school again.

My mom and I just wanted some pretzel nuggets, damn!

I really hope her day went better after taking her anger out on me.",R4qCqf9F4PxcPumVtpnhoA,0,0,1,HSZ8osOf36erEfU_xXtjTA

I was waiting for my turn to order and saw one of the employees was pouring something from a type of juice bottle into their lemonade dispenser. I was not sure if it was water, juice, or pre-made lemonade. But, in a few seconds, I could see what that was. After the employee pour it all in, she went to their hand sink and started getting tap water into the juice bottle. It didn't look appetizing or sanitary either. Yet she came back to the dispenser and pour the tap water into it again.
It was repeated until the dispenser was filled up.
I was very disappointed since I thought they used purified water for drinks at least. 
I would probably come back for pretzel later, but not for the lemonade.",2GtifEU-7O12aIGdtGaU-w,0,0,2,ZyJyjJu5tEsIVyadBTwq8w

First off, there was a decent line, but soon we got served.  *I don't remember the young lady's name but she needs to recognized!  She had on glasses, she was very efficient, friendly and went above and beyond for us!  My mother works in the mall and receives a mall discount, so she reminded us that the large size employee drink is almost the same price as the small we originally ordered (which helped us out since we were all sharing it), she gave us an extra cup w/cover to help assist me with my 2 year old son AND she made our pretzel bites fresh out the oven w/sour cream n onion (I saw her accidentally drop 2 on the kitchen counter, but also remembered to add 2 more to our order before she presented it to us).

She seemed genuinely kind and we appreciated her for going out of her way to help us out.  It's something small, but I appreciated her help.  In Vegas, a lot of food places just wanna turn a table or rush people out to get their lines down during the busy periods, but this server of yours kept it together during the rush, she was patient and kept her cool the whole time we waited and got served.
