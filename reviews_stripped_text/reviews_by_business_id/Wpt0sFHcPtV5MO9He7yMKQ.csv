771957,2012-06-20,0,Wpt0sFHcPtV5MO9He7yMKQ,"I would give this place a 0-star review if I could! I swung by with my son (autistic ADHD/severe-anxiety), and my cousin while on our way home from job-hunting.

1. First off the cashier serving us--I had to repeat parts of the order a few times, he repeated some way wrong, then he repeated the whole thing and I heard burger in part of the order (wow this place was noisy, too), so I thought he finally got it right and I was tired of how long it took to order a burger for my son who's very particular about what he gets (was ordering as a reward for being good), and get myself and my cousin a couple spicy chickens.

2. The guy didn't give us our soda cups, IT TOOK COMPLAINING TO ANOTHER PERSON TO GET SOMEONE TO GIVE US THE CUPS FOR THE SODAS WE BOUGHT!! (Thank you, miss!) And we weren't the only customers he wasn't giving cups to, might I add!

3. We walked to the table to get out of the way and I looked everything over to make sure it was right...Spicy Mc Chicken instead of a burger. So I thought, they're busy, I'd ask if my son wanted to try a chicken sammich, he was fine if I scraped everything off. Someone who was working here said its not necessary and she'd get what he ordered. (Another nice lady!)

4. The cashier came to our table and started ARGUING WITH US, walked away and asked (a manager? I couldn't see), then came back and said ""We'll have to charge you to get what you wanted"", when all they had to do was replace the $1 Mc Chicken with a $1 burger with only ketchup on it. Other McD's have made the simple swap without hassle when they've messed up, although mess-ups have still been rare and except for this McD, those cashiers didn't try to pin the blame on the customer!

End of it: I simply told him that he can forget about that, that we weren't going to pay extra to buy another item because HE messed up, and none of us are ever eating here again. Some other McD's can get our money.

Putting smiles on kids' faces, huh? Yeah right.


EDIT: Oh, and we didn't get our receipt back, so I can't exactly take it straight to the store manager. But we did get names.",ySyXNs92s3_sItaZlt1f5w,0,1,1,T-Mc0-citdxvIjI59Rfqzw

She told me if I had just dumped my cup I fuxken come here a lot its literally on the same block from where I live...i will take my fucken money else where.

1670180,2016-06-27,0,Wpt0sFHcPtV5MO9He7yMKQ,"It took over ten minutes to get my order as the fifth car in the line.  They were out of two ingredients needed for my order.  The cashier was mute, displaying a very poor affect.  My order of two items needed to be fully repeated three times for the woman taking my order.  I'm torn between whether she put little effort in listening to the order or has a short term memory problem that should prevent her from working at that station.  Regional management might want to check in on this location's management.

Food was the same sub-par, just barely edible quality that it ususlly is.  

I would have gone elsewhere if I wasn't trapped in the 'drive-thru' lane.

They don't even make sure that the order is correct if you order just make sure you double check your bag I have had them mess up my order 3 different times it's written right on the damn screen and they still can't get the order right. They can't say they heard me wrong I did mobile order so it's sent right to their screen and they still can't get that shit right. I ordered a Powerade with no ice and I got a damn cup of just ice like seriously????!!!!!!! It's horrible and if you ask for any extra sauces forget it it's like they have to pay for them out of their own paycheck I got 60 nuggets from them and they gave me 6 sauces and made a big deal when I asked for more sauces. Just horrible and if you go at night forget it you're going to be sitting in your car for a looooong time cause they can't get their shit together.,9ZW-dVfFoHvEOkH5m5cHYg,0,0,1,wIiwvegF4on0lp8LuOAncg

There is absolutely no logic in that so after I ordered and tried to pay I was refused (even though I go thru the drive thru all the time! So I pointed out there was no signs anywhere saying that and they still refused.

But this restaurant is awful, despite the fact that they just remodeled.  I tried it a month ago because I wanted to try the 1/3 angus burger and see what that was all about.  The burger was ""okay"", but it was almost necessary to run a gauntlet to get it.  Right next to the front door, they had a full, full garbage can, and the stench was horrible - right next to the front door.  And then, I kid you not, I had to walk through a swarm of flies on my way to the front counter.  NOT appetizing.  I mentioned this to friends who said call the health dept., but I'm not going to do that to someone unless I see poisoned people in the aisles, let someone else do it if they want.  The reason I'm compelled to write is that I wanted to try another product (this is really close to my house), a chicken biscuit to compare to one I had in St. Louis to see if there were any decent biscuits here and McD's advertises this all the time - the biscuit was overcooked and horrible and the chicken was burnt.  I wasn't going in after the first experience, but I figured the drive through would be okay. The first window where they take the money was ""womanned"" by what seemed to be the manager, she was beyond rude.  The take out window girl was nicer, at least she smiled.  There are a lot of nice nice people at McDonalds, and a few have better food, but not this one!  Again, sorry...",-mzS8ZrsN5vIhAM22gcS3Q,1,0,1,yusUJFKCluKPobtRLHjpDQ
3542947,2013-02-07,3,Wpt0sFHcPtV5MO9He7yMKQ,"This location has always been a bit seedy. I guess they have problems with the homeless trashing their bathrooms because they make you ask to use tge bathroom & then buzz you in which is extremely inconvenient when you have toddlers who can open the door from the inside. 

The service was friendly enough, but the guy didnt have change, and though i ordered (and paid for) extra ranch, it didnt come with my meal. 

The kids area has been recently renovated. I cant say its an improvement. They took away the toddler slide area to add more seating. They didnt add that much more seating, and i miss the toddler slide for my kids. 

This location is also homeless central. There are always three or four ppl begging on the corner, and often asking for change when you walk in or out. While I dont mind giving to those less fortunate than myself, i dont like being accosted by an army of them like a zombie apocalypse. 

Three stars. Would be less except the play area looks like a big tree house , which thrilled my kids.",6ehZ3X1gaHe-fxzndNRweA,1,0,3,Ne8AE42eO9lLrCVHltC-UA

4451918,2011-09-26,1,Wpt0sFHcPtV5MO9He7yMKQ,"I know, really, I'm writing a review of McDonald's? Well, there is a good reason. I always pass this McDonald's when I work at a convention on the strip. It's just on my way. I do not eat a whole lot of McDonald's, but sometimes those Golden Arches just call to you.

Usually when I am on my way to work it is early morning and I have just run out of the door and I haven't eaten anything. I tend to swing through this McDonald's through the drive-thru. Usually I just get a coffee (I do have an affinity for their coffee btw), but sometimes I get the breakfast burritos. I won't lie, I'm addicted to these things. Um, I'm not even sure what is really in them, but I really don't care.

Anyway, my experience with their drive-thru staff is always awesome. When it is early in the morning and the McDonald's employees are still being really nice and happy I think that is a good thing.

4687602,2012-07-25,2,Wpt0sFHcPtV5MO9He7yMKQ,"Dear McDonalds Corporate. The franchisee running this McD location needs to be recalled to Hamburger University and retrained on how to run their franchise properly. This location fails on so many things. Start by teaching the staff to listen to a customer's order. Follow up by teaching them the importance of order accuracy over sheer speed. Train the staff to give the customer options if something is not available. And last but certainly not least spend some money to make sure your basic equipment works correctly. For example if you're a McCafe location and every time someone rolls up to your drive thru and they can't order anything, you're really not a McCafe location at all. 

In short most of the problems at this McDonalds can be traced back to MANAGEMENT FAILURE. Someone needs to extract their head from their derriere and run this location the way it's supposed to be run. 2 Stars and a complaint to McD Corporate in Illinois is the best I can give this place.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,5,1,2,zOI_TSPajlSrVRSu9Rr8uA

*Customer Service- B They smiled and created me and said thank you.
*Food Quality- Its McDonalds what do you expect???? The food was warm and the parfait was good as always. B *********Update********** A homeless person just walked in.

Yet, every time they forget something. One day it is the fries, next it will be his toy, some days it is the sliced apples.
