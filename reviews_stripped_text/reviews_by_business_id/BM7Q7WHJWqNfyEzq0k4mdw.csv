4375033,2017-12-20,1,BM7Q7WHJWqNfyEzq0k4mdw,"Very disappointed. I walked in with the hopes of it being Chinese food but they asked me what toppings I wanted on my sub. Martha was chewing her gum ferociously as she put cheese on my ""sub"". I asked if they had chow mein and they replied ""This is subway."" AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW. I give them a 3 because it was tasty but was really hoping for a dish of orange chicken and chow mein.
Update: Apparently if you are in Chinatown, the Subways there don't serve Chinese food. Good to know.",dL7EmVPL7iab70MkgRh25w,0,0,3,Q7f1dZLgCwB5IGmkdIS2zg

I asked them to check a sauce to see if it had dairy and they refused because there was a customer behind me. one customer.

I ordered my regular foot long ham with Swiss.  The employee asked if I wanted it toasted, I said yes, he said no.  At first I thought it was a joke, so ami asked again adding Please.  He then informed me they were ""resetting the oven.""  No big deal I thought.  Let me get a cup of broccoli cheddar.  ""We don't have any soup"" he said.

Ugh, at this point I gave him one last chance.  May I please have a chocolate chip cookie.  ""Nope, we don't have those either.""

Seriously!?  You don't have a toaster, nor soup, nor any cookies?

I'm an avid Subway customer, in fact, I'm there more then any YELP review.  Check my stats, because I'll never come to this location again.",Y6otbk7H7mDMbXBVKL9yeA,0,0,1,aBMGKib-zAXL7098HfMLbg

I love subway cause you can get something healthy quick. All the employees I have ran into at this location where friendly and did their job well. Like I went to another location recently and got a chopped salad, I prefer more spinach the lettus basically I like a spinach salad with a little lettus. And she didn't even lesson to me I thought it was so rude of her I should prob write a review about that location. I specifically asked for ALOT of spinach and a little Lettus and she barely put any spinach, then i asked for more spinach and she literally added a few leaves. I was like omg, really?  maybe she didn't like me personally or something maybe she was racist against asain lol idk. But then I thought well if I don't add lettus this is gonna be the tiniest salad ever. Then I asked for lettus and she grabbed a huge handful and dropped it in. I was like god that's so rude to not even lesson to the customer about what hey want and she was skimping on literally everything not just the spinach like I asked for more picked and she added a couple pickles, even tho she put very few to begin w. But not at this place, I think most places give you about a average size salad, and ad more of whatever you ask for. That's what I like about this place. They lesson to you. To bad I just moved and will very rarely be around the area to come back. I go to subways enough to know which ones have good service and which ones to avoid but this is on the good list.  love it. I'm surprised I have never ran into bad service at this location, and I have had many diff people help me.",N26-dXhOoB3gHhX6meMMNw,1,1,5,wXDKqKT1rnN_gjwiI3NktA
