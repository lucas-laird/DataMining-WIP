134923,2014-07-07,2,Mb8qJps-OBFmDALFo5dkJA,"Terrible service. Me and the wife arrived and we're told it is a 15 minute wait, no problem a waiter takes our name and says were on the list and will call us an hour later my wife flags someone down and asks how much longer it will be, this waitress asks for the name, turns out the previous waiter never put my name on the list and lied to my face. We wait another 20 minutes and right when we were getting ready to leave they called us....all of this to even sit down. Mind you the restaurant is more than half empty. 

After sitting down it takes 10 minutes for a waiter to get our drink order,  two iced teas with lemon, not complicated. 15 minutes later the waiter comes with plastic cups and straws, YES PLASTIC and brings one iced tea, then proceeds to ask me if I had ordered a drink....  wow. 

so with the drinks straightened out we ordered our food. 45 minutes later we see the waiter coming with food. I expected to see paper plates but they used normal ones, moving on up. the waiter places my wife's meal in front of her then places the exact same thing in front of me. I notified him this is not what I ordered. 10 minutes later my pastrami was brought out Luke warm. we were given condiment bottles. one of mayo was unopened and had the plastic still around the cap, the freshest thing this place had to offer. the service is absolutely terrible, the food is mediocre at best...I don't understand what happened to this place or who is running it but it is terrible. 

we showed amazing patience as I saw at least 5 other groups complain about being told it's a 10-15 minute wait as a default and waiting an hour. one lady even got up spoke with the manager and left. I assume the manager as she was dressed formal. the dead bugs on the window sills were unappealing and our waiter thought everything was a joke.  the best part about this lunch was the beautiful thunderstorms that formed up there.

261641,2012-06-08,3,Mb8qJps-OBFmDALFo5dkJA,"Have you ever seen the show ""Restaurant Impossible?""  That's all I could think of while I was here.

If I had been walking in out of curiosity alone, I would have turned back around before anyone would have had the chance to seat us.  The restaurant looked tired and worn and the people that were already eating there didn't look too happy.  So why did I stick around?  Well, I got a deal from KSHP AM 1400 and thought it would be nice to have breakfast up on Mt Charleston.  Unfortunately for me, I didn't check the reviews on Yelp beforehand, nor did I check my coupon- lunch and dinner only.  I could have waited until lunch, but I already psyched myself up to get some breakfast.  So I decided to stick this one out.

I ordered the waffle breakfast, my husband the pancakes.  They both came with scrambled eggs and seasoned potatoes on the side.

While we were waiting for our food, that's when I started to notice the ""Restaurant Impossible""-ness to this place.  The walls were repainted, but only from the floor to about 6 feet up.  The rest of the walls (which are actually pretty tall) were still the older color of paint.  I could see the paint difference where they removed light fixtures.  The carpet was very worn and the chairs were out of style.  The windows needed cleaned pretty badly.  I started to wonder how clean the kitchen was.  Robert Irvine would love this place.

As for the food, it wasn't great and it wasn't terrible.  Just some pretty standard waffles, pancakes, and eggs.  The potatoes were incredibly salty though, and that was the only ""seasoning"" I could taste on them.  For what you get, the food is overpriced.

Basically the place was ok.  It will do if you are hungry on Mt Charleston or staying at the Resort.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,5,1,2,DgrkNZmzCoUfKj-T9GBImA

1120724,2011-10-21,1,Mb8qJps-OBFmDALFo5dkJA,"Fantastic!  Went for a one-night stay at the Resort on Mt. Charleston with one of the Valpak coupons.  Coupon included dinner (two entrees) and breakfast (also two choices) at the ""A Cut Above"" restaurant in the resort.  

""A Cut Above"" is known as a steak house, but as my wife and I don't really eat meat, we looked for other options.  We chose the Almond Crusted Trout and the Atlantic Salmon as our two entrees.  Both were simply perfect!  Our salad was also fresh and tasty, and for dessert we had cheesecake with raspberry sauce.  Don't think we've ever had cheesecake so good in a restaurant, it showed no hint of having been previously frozen and melted in our mouths.

For breakfast next morning we had a Southwestern omelet and the blueberry pancakes.  Both servings were humongous, the omelet came with toast and seasoned potatoes, the blueberry pancakes were cooked perfectly and loaded with fresh berries.  Servings were large enough that we could have easily shared one or the other and still been satiated.  

The serving staff was just right; attentive without being overly intrusive.

Prices were middle of the road, just about what you'd expect, we would go back in an instant!

Update 9/25/14:  I've taken my rating from five stars down to two....  

We stayed at the Mt. Charleston resort again, and were looking forward to another excellent dining experience at ""A Cut Above"" but were let down.  We ordered a spinach salad, waitress came back to our table and said the spinach was no good.  Really?  A restaurant that can't deliver spinach salad?  We were offered the option of romaine or iceberg instead, opted for romaine, and received iceberg.  Sad. 
      Also as an appetizer chose the spinach artichoke dip, dip was good, but the flimsy chips were oily and weak and a poor delivery method for the dip. 
       Lastly, because there was NO background music playing, we ate in utter silence and were able to hear the other diners' conversations in total clarity, and were shocked to hear another patron ask for ice cream for dessert, only to be told there was no ice cream.  Yikes.  
       As a small token of redemption, the breakfast was the usual high standard.",I2LqdDguUbkh22hc06dgWQ,1,0,2,x9rQwVJVHMMxVzbWN_N_Og

2032365,2013-12-28,0,Mb8qJps-OBFmDALFo5dkJA,"Its really sad to see that this restaurant is failing miserable considering all the recent bad times it has gone through (with the devastation of the Carpenter 1 fire then flooding from all the rain during our monsoon).  

I suggested this place for a group of 11 hikers today and not only am I embarrassed that it was my choice, but I'm literately sick to my stomach and have a metal taste in my mouth from the fish & chips I had.  Trust me, I don't write reviews (I don't have time to) and I should have trusted my instincts to NOT eat the food (I usually do trust my instincts, I've watched ""Restaurant Impossible"" way too many times!!)

My fish & chips consisted of realllllly salty fries, mushy tarter sauce and one large piece of fish...wth??  I've never seen just one large piece of fish when ordering fish & chips.  But I was starving after doing a snowshoe hike and sometimes when you're hungry, you'll eat anything, then pay the price later lol.  The fish was obviously frozen and sort of gray looking, dipped in batter, and separated from the fish altogether...ick in hindsight about sums it up.  

After waiting 40 minutes for a table, why I'm not sure, our server was sure to tell us that putting our 11 orders on separate checks vs. one check was going to take A LOT longer to get our food AND our checks.  Why couldn't he put our food order in to the cooks on ONE order and figure out the check later??  Sure enough, what took longer was the food getting to our table.  It appeared, that the kitchen had the orders done in a timely matter but the food sat and was served cold to everyone at our table.  The server kindly explained that what took longer was HIM entering the orders.  Then he didn't remember what anyone ordered.  Then he brought soy sauce instead of balsomic.  Not to mention half the table was done eating by the time the other half got their food.  And Kevin was probably their finest server on staff.  

As if the food and server wasn't bad enough, the place is honestly a dump.  The old, worn and wrinkled carpet is taped to the baseboards with duck tape and littered with food.  The chair cushions are held on with velcro, outdated and dirty.  Everything thing in this place is musty, worn out, outdated, dirty and dingy.  Not to mention beat up and unappealing.  

Again its very sad to see but understandable in a depressed state of operation.  I predict it will be shut down by either the health department or due to financial reasons.  

Don't waste your money here, go to the fun-crowded-country-lodge at the top of the hill instead.  I will NEVER go here again!!",rqs2Re2VyIgIDorU3GspKw,0,0,1,tMmP1VahQADVC2L3q3gmMQ

4403080,2013-01-08,1,Mb8qJps-OBFmDALFo5dkJA,"My husband and I recently went to Mt.Charleston to play in the snow. We stopped in to the restaurant to get some lunch. We had been to A Cut Above on several occasions. On this occasion, the restaurant was only about half full. The lobby of the hotel was packed with people trying to get warm. There was a long line of people waiting to get in to the restaurant. The hostess ran around the restaurant, frantic, although the place was only half full. A couple in front of me was told that the wait was 20 minutes. I inquired about the wait and said to the hostess that I couldn't understand why there was a long wait when there were so many open tables. She then told me that it would only be a 5-minute wait. She was very overwhelmed...why, I have no clue. You would think that with the snow, the restaurant would have a plan in place for an influx of people.

I have to say that this restaurant is becoming more and more shabby in appearance over time. My husband and I sat at a table with chairs that didn't match. The carpet and windows are dirty. Then our waiter appeared. He looked and acted like Lerch from the Addams Family. He had zero personality, provided terrible service and would come to our table, look at it, take things away without a word. It was very bizarre. The food was mediocre at best, definitely not worth the price. 

I must add that a couple sat down at a table behind us shortly after we arrived. We shared the same strange waiter. Our food arrived and we were finished (in the span of about 50 minutes) and their food had not even arrived. To say that they were frustrated is an understatement.

Oh, and then there was the joy of getting the check. I asked Lerch for the bill and waited more than 15 minutes for it. Finally, when the manager walked by my table, I asked him for it. he brought it with a to-go pizza box. He held it out to me blankly and said, ""Do you know how to put this box together? I have no clue."" Really????

A Cut Above, in my opinion, doesn't even begin to make the cut. The restaurant has so much wasted potential. I will not return and waste my time or money.",FSqkfnjurMjbS3Hf-CQHTA,3,1,1,vqSeRbt5MylyjmzPjX8UQg

We were seated fairly quickly and given a table right under a vent. Instead of blowing out warm air it felt like the A\C instead. We noticed all the other people were seated at the opposite side of the room close to a fireplace.  How odd we get seated over here instead. Even with coats on and hat with gloves we were freezing. We asked the hostess if we could move closer to the fireplace. She did move us but it took like 15 minutes and there were many open tables.The waitress took our order and it took forever.  We ordered appetizer and a salad.  It took 35 minutes to get them. We noticed other tables had bread and butter on their tables yet we never were offered any.

My sister ordered salmon and the rice was mush. The turkey wrap had cheap quality turkey luncheon meat. She forgot the coleslaw my friend ordered. So I dont want to be totally mean to the waitress as she was the only server in the whole restaurant.  But the odd thing was we saw like 3 bussers walking around and talking. They were occasionally filling water glasses and that was it. So not one of them could have helped the waitress? Though the experience was not a pleasant one, I still tipped the waitress 15 percent and my friend who manages restaurants for a living gave her 20 percent. He said though the service was not great he didn't know if she was just having a bad night and it was also due to the the restaurant and hotel having bad management.

Went on a Sunday to escape this ridiculous heat wave and hoped to get a little rain as well. The hosts were very courteous and accommodated my broken ankle situation, so that was nice. Everyone was really nice so they get an A+ on that. However, this place lack efficiency with its staff. Our waiter was a super nice guy, just really inefficient and somewhat socially awkward. He had a large group he was waiting on in addition to us but in a well-oiled machine of a restaurant, that means others might pitch in to help things run smoothly. There were several occasions that left my fiance and I with puzzled looks on our faces but I think that most significant part was when he brought our food and then asked if we needed anything else. We had asked for sides of mayo and ranch with our food and assumed he would forget it, so we asked again. First he brought out mayo packets...that's it. Then went back to get ranch cups, then when he brought those, he asked if we needed ketchup. I think anyone with a little experience or common sense would figure out how to bring all three at once instead of making 3 trips. In the end, I tipped him well because I did feel he was doing his best...just don't think this is the right line of work for the guy. As for the other aspects of the restaurant...food was at best mediocre. We ordered and shared the warm goat cheese/pita bread and the club sandwich. We preferred the goat cheese appetizer with the pesto and sun dried tomatoes. Not bad, could be better in some way I'm sure. The club sandwich was pretty much what you might expect at a Denny's or other low budget diner. The bread should have been more toasted. The fries are actually pretty tasty though. The decor is blah and doesn't bring anything to the table there. I read the comment about ""Restaurant Impossible"" and started laughing because that is EXACTLY what I was thinking when I was sitting there with my girl. Overall, if you are absolutely needing to eat because the kids are going nuts in the car or if you get pissy when you have low blood sugar, this place will do.

After 15 minutes I went to a waiter filling up salt & pepper shakers. He said he was going off duty. I asked him to find someone. Another 15 minutes and he comes back to take order. Had to talk 'slow' so he could take order.

Ordered ""Siegel Mountain Burger"" $13.95 (menu said Kobe beef). Was told it was named for the owner.

1 hour goes by, no food. I search for wait staff -- none to be seen, only one other table with people in restaurant.

Another 30 minutes goes by, I get up, hunt for anyone and inquire again.  Am told my well done ""Kobe"" burger accounts for the delay.  Finally food comes after 1.5 hours. We stayed because we had a chance to talk and catch up on old times. 

This was no Kobe burger! Lettuce was white core pieces! A cheap bun, a load of french fries -- for $13.95. A Carl's Jr $6 burger is better. With tax, the total was $15.80

Robert Irvine could do nothing for this place without first firing everyone associated with the restaurant.

We started with the FIlet Tips as an appetizer.  As you'd expect with filet, the meat was tender.  The meat wasn't really hot nor did it boast a lot of flavor, but the port wine sauce and the creamy horseradish helped fill that void.  All in all, not a bad dish, although it could benefit from a bit more creative plating as it was just a lot of meat on a white plate.  

I played it safe and ordered the BBQ Kobe burger.  Though the meat was slightly undercooked, it was juicy and tender.  However, the bacon had a beef-jerky-like texture, as if it had been sitting under the heat lamp since breakfast.  It was tough to chew, so I removed all the bacon from the burger.  The fries tasted like they had been frozen, just lacking anything resembling freshness.  

My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Angelo.  This wasn't a bad dish, but it wasn't great either.  The chicken was fine, but like the burger, I question the freshness of some of the ingredients used in the dish.

All in all, the meal wasn't horrible, but it definitely did not live up to it's name.  I considered the prices to be reasonable before we ate the meal.  After we dined there, I felt it was a bit overpriced. 

We returned for breakfast and went with the standard bacon and eggs.  Totally diner style in quality and presentation.  I found the breakfast prices to be more reasonable.  

Some improvements and this could be a real gem.",w_1Iqe8mGdofBIeY9Y0V0Q,1,0,2,lQQZHwJZEIUkhqlqcnuxyw
5837381,2014-04-04,1,Mb8qJps-OBFmDALFo5dkJA,"My recent one and only meal here was actually pretty good.  Black & Tan Battered Onion Rings were plentiful, and a fine shareable appetizer.  And a Chopped Salad that was filled with large pieces of bacon and memorable chunks of bleu cheese was almost entree size.  Mountain Stew was filled with chunks of beef and cubes of potato swimming in a slightly spicy broth.  I would have preferred the broth to be more rich and gravy like, and all of the cubed potatoes to be fully skinned instead of just half.  Pieces of potato skin kept falling off their hosts and landing like tasteless rind in the liquid part of the soup.

Diane and other table mates liked their Haddock Fish & Chips and Club Sandwich prepared with Wheat Bread.  Cole Slaw was not at all creamy, and only fair.  Service was very good, especially considering that only one person was working the cavernous dining room as both host and server.  Largely for this reason, it took awhile for us to be greeted after we arrived on time for our reservation.

This place seems to have an identity problem.  It can't seem to make up its mind whether it is a coffee shop, a spot that serves sandwiches and other lunch fare, or a fine dining establishment.  So it offers food items from all three perspectives.  It would seem to be better to focus on only one type of eatery, and broaden the menu for that genre.

The view here is great from the tables, especially on a day like the one where we ate here after it snowed.  But furniture in the dining room is sparse and looks worn.  So, a makeover and some more help for the overworked single server would be in order.

3-1/2 stars overall!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,5,3,3,VYZJ5YTVBGhjVOHjY-U6QQ
