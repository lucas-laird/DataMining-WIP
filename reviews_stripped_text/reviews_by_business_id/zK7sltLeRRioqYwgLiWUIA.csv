165424,2015-12-27,0,zK7sltLeRRioqYwgLiWUIA,"If you're in search for a burger spot, but don't want to settle with in-N-out this is the place to go. It has such a wide variety yet a simple menu (includes vegetarian options too!) the service is usually never bad, I've been here a handful of times and haven't gotten rude workers approach me. It's a very modern and up-beat scenery, which is perfect for the area of downtown-near all the bars and such. My recommendation would be the old fashioned burger to test the waters a bit, and to recognize the quality compared to most burger spots. The malt shakes are irresistible when in search for the sweet taste after a burger, and to mention the fries (which also have a wide variety). Honestly, a burger joint I'll always recommend to anyone who wants to try something different, that still won't hurt their pocket either.",T7ot0AtUj1uwQtlnzqqOxA,1,0,4,a_ZXWEvWgIVZKu-CUp2tIg

They offer turkey burgers, but no veggie burgers. My friend was kind of upset about that, doesn't effect my review but I do think it would be a smart addition to the menu. I'm sure they could make a veggie burger Flippin good!

Their website has a banner on the front page which proclaims ""keepin' it vegetarian"" advertising the Garden Burger and Portobello Philly. They've apparently removed these options from the menu. 

I would strongly advise management to at least bring the garden burger patty back to give veggie people an option. Also, the new beer selection is lame, all lagers and IPAs and domestics.

Speaking of the cup, I had a very difficult time because my spoon did not fit through the hole in the lid! I discovered this after leaving and had to stop at a trash can to remove the lid because the custard was filled above the level of the cup. I had not been given a napkin, and the liquidy custard made a huge mess when I removed the lid so I could actually *drink* it. After paying almost $4 for an 8 oz custard, I was very disappointed.

Since my review, Christina (The manager?) reached out, which is nice, saying they might reconsider in the future. There was no way to reply to her, but I just wanted to say that I understand it is a business decision, but I strongly believe it is a must-keep flavor if they just try to suggest it more. Everyone I suggested it to fell instantly in love with it; It is not as heavy or loaded as other flavors which are good too, but because most of my (and my roommate's trips) were specifically to get one of those (and a burger and fries of course), we decided it is not longer worth the frequent trip now that it is removed. We will still stop by when there of course, both the burgers and fries are delicious, but taking a star is my way of protesting the cancellation of this delicious and unique flavor which you cannot find anywhere else! I hope you bring it back someday....  :(((((",N6PAVmnVS24YDjvZgaXkmQ,0,0,3,nMYCle6WxIVkXVEiewuhHw

Soo I saw Amelia's post about the chkn' sando and thought ""dang, no way can this compete with Garden Grills crack chkn' sando"".......well it does!


Thick crunchy batter, ginormous portion, juicy chkn', and a taste that makes Colonel ""Murder"" Sanders turn over in his grave.

It truly rivals GG. But slicing and stealing 1/4 of hubby's sando and adding the pickle and sauce...holy shit I think its better than GG. Maybe I was just hangry? I'm really not a fan of fried foods nor supporting non vegan restaurants...

They will make you custom vegan rings...yep! 
He got 1/2 fries 1/2 rings. The bite of the onion ring dripped oil down my face, but they tasted like White Castle, unknown how that is even possible. Fries where fresh cut and nice, not greasy.

A-ok. Would I ever go there and order one? No way. It's too big, I don't normally eat oil and I can't imagine the dead cow smell in this place. Oh and the bun is ginormous. The bun is thick AF. Dang its big. (that's what she said *eyeroll*) 

This order was to-go and everything was nice and separated just how I asked for it. Don't want a soggy ass bun and sauce drippin' everywhere now do ya'? Five stars on the to-go execution.

Four stars for the sando, two star for rings, three stars for the fries. Five stars for the vegan Flippin' good sauce, I put dribbles on my homemade salad I ate during his meal  ;D",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,7,5,4,H6X9ygC19iCxC94t5xUOdQ

I grabbed one and we took a seat at the bar and glanced over the options. We ordered one Nashville hot and one Vegas hot. A bartender showed up and I stared at him until he realized he had never seen us before and perhaps we needed to place and order or might like a beer... we placed our order ToGo which was also recommended by others. The food came out packaged well and smelled really good. We walked back to our place and got to work. The Vegas Hot is HOT! The Nashville was really tasty, you'll still break a small sweat but it's good! The fries were good too, lightly seasoned or maybe that was just salt! Either way... there is nothing healthy about this food. The presentation was well done and I could tell this was no fast food burger. It was layered well and surprisingly didn't fall apart while eating. The actual plant based party is smallish... but super well coated in the rub and adds for a lightly greasy but flavorful bites.

1559512,2015-12-15,7,zK7sltLeRRioqYwgLiWUIA,"Flippin' Good is a flippin' cheap option for Fremont Street eats- two can easily dine under $20, and that's with a side and dessert to share! I was excited about this spot opening but hesitant to visit given the generally-underwhelmed reviews, but their claims of freshness eventually tempted me through the door. 

BURGERS: The menu lists single- and double-burgers for each style, I opted for the classic and realized why. The patty thickness is somewhere between White Castle and Dollar Menu Double. Props for offering a lettuce-wrapped version. Beef quality, like all the other reviews, lends itself to a less-favorable comparison to that West coast chain. The turkey burger retained a surprising juiciness and the toppings were fresh.
FRIES: The regular variety are lightly salted, but if your a fan of spice, opt for the Flippin' Spicy style. I openly admit that these were WAY too spicy for me, with tons of chopped grilled jalapenos in every nook and cranny. These were perfectly topped too: so much cheese and pepper that it was difficult to find bare fries, even at the bottom. A win for most people, a lose for me, because it rendered the dish inedible, but this is entirely my fault.
CONCRETE:  A few specialty versions for a sweet dessert treat, BF opted for the Brownie Delight, whose chocolaty tones were reminiscent of a Frosty, in a good way. The 10oz small is just the right size and the bits of brownie blended in added a nice texture that didn't take away from the overall creaminess.

Service was quick and cheery, space is clean and welcoming with framed, mirrored windows on the walls lending a farm-house feeling. This is a nice addition to the area given their relatively low price point and the fact that they deliver on their promised freshness. But it's not the kind of meal I'll cross town for, nor one I can justify paying a parking fee to access due to the location. Outside of the downtown area, I'd probably be more inclined to give them another try.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,11,3,d6H5MoFYmj-RbCRWaKINMQ

So,  i had the chicken sandwich with the hottest sauce and fried pickles.  It was perfect. The flavor wqs on point! My husband had the hamburger well done and fries.  It was juicy and flavorful.  Now, my fried order ""grilled"" chicken salad and it came to the table with fried breaded chicken. It was still good but server suggested just to keep it beause it would just take longer to eat . Ugh ok . Then my friends husband ordered the hamburger with the fried egg and requested the egg with "" no"" yolk. Well that came to the table with the egg drooling with yolk again server suggested it would take too long to remake ugh ok .  Also, my fried ordered the white wine and was brought rose but server quickly replaced. I dont kow if it was just an off day for either the server or cook but for half of the order to be wrong i must admit i was expecting some kind of discount. But , the check came and nope not even 1% off. Im not the type to ask but it would have  definitely been a plus in my book if they would have been more apologetic about all the mess ups and sweeten the bill with a comp or discount...

The space was smaller than I expected from walking by it a handful of times, but not cramped. They have plenty of TVs for sports and a decent sized bar. 

I tried the Nashville hot chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken was breaded and seasoned well, but the meat was a little dry and bland. The fries were the best part for me! Freshly made and on the thicker side, which is usually not my preference. 

Service is good, but unfortunately on my visit there was an employee walking around the floor doing basically nothing but eating...and drinking. Taking a premixed shot was the first thing she did after stepping on the floor. Super uncool from a health-code standard and it's what drags this review down from a solid 4 stars.

My roommate on the other hand has been a strict vegan for two years. We had the vegan chicken sandwich a while ago and thought they had vegan chicken tenders from an instagram post we obviously mis read. So we Ordered our vegan chicken tenders. And we said ""vegan"", i mean trust me if you're a vegan and trying to order chicken tenders you are going to address that. So we get our tenders trusting that they are vegan because the waitress was quick and chill and had no hesitation when we ordered, so we go about eating when our food arrives. My roommate was so impressed by the way the tenders broke and tasted like freakin chicken! So when the waitress comes To check up on us, wish i can remember her name, but a redhead chick. I ask what brand they use for these vegan tenders or if they make them bcos they look so real and i see a cloud of guilt slap her in the face and she goes on to say that they have a vegan chkn SANDWICH but not tenders. Okay, so you didn't hear me say vegan. Thats ok, i would forgive you if you showed some type of sympathy and tried to make things better but instead insisted you didnt hear me say vegan. seriously dude? i clearly said vegan! You weren't listening. You messed up. And as someone who has worked and has many friends in the serving industry, you should do anything it takes to make this horrid mistake better Bcos now we have to digest this dead animal bcos she didn't hear us say vegan. And it was ""our"" fault according to her. Didn't even offer us any comps or anything. I even had to swallow my pride and ask if my friend, who btw threw up in the bathroom after this whole ordeal, could get the actual vegan sandwich to take home comped. As soon as I'm asking i then felt bad bcos of her energy and her saying shed have to ask her manager then i said never mind, please fix your post on instagram and not let this happen again.

I'm always excited when a new burger joint pops up, and I was especially excited to see another food option in Fremont East.

I spent this past weekend downtown for Life Is Beautiful, and I ended up at Flippin' Good.  Considering the amount of people in the downtown area, I wouldn't say that the place was slammed.  Defintiely busy but not at all crowded to a point of being overwhelmed.  The staff, however, was definitely acting like they were overwhelmed.  The service was slow.  Food came out after a very long time.  My onion rings were well done on the outside and raw on the inside.  My burger was average - I think this is as much of a comment as it warrants. 

The only perk of my visit is that I got a free beer.  Just to be clear, the only reason I got a free beer is because the staff was overwhelmed and accidentally put the order in twice.

2223926,2015-09-05,0,zK7sltLeRRioqYwgLiWUIA,"Overall assessment is average. I'm cutting this place some slack since its brand new, so here's the review. 

The place is very nice inside and the location is great, right on Fremont and LV Blvd. I stopped in for lunch and ordered the ""Farm Burger"" and fries.

The food came out quick, I would guess around 8 minutes after I ordered. The meat was very plain, just tasted like decent quality beef with no seasoning at all. The bun, while soft, was very greasy. I don't know what the shiny stuff is all over it, I'm assuming butter or oil to give it the shine. It made my hands greasy with every bite. See the picture in the review. I liked how the bun was soft on top but toasted on the grill as well. The egg was slightly over cooked and wasn't runny, the bacon not crispy but more rubbery. Grilled onions were just there as well, not much depth of flavor. 

The fries were ok but I was hoping for a little more crunch than the soft ones I got. This preference so I'm not factoring it into the star rating. Very lightly salted, but also a preference thing. 

I'm still trying to find what will make this burger place different from all the others. Nothing about the food stood out as better than any other burger spot. Because it wasn't the worst burger I've had, and it's a convenient lunch spot, I'll give it one more go. When I go back, I'm going to just try a plain burger to see if it's better than one with all the extras like the farm burger has.

When we were invited out to try the new vegan chick'n sandwich at Flippin' Good Burgers, my first response was ""don't threaten me with a good time!"". Settled into the heart of downtown this small and casual burger joint is effortless enough to deal with the 2am drunks in need of a soaker, but pulled together enough to happily accommodate this accent-chair shopping, Hallmark ornament wait-listed wife and mother of cats. After we settled ourselves onto the dining bar that shelved an open window facing the Fremont, we placed our order and people watched. 

Oh- the glory of these bad boys when they arrived. Now mind you, I'm a vegan of the kale-munching variety. I have hemp hearts, spirulina, apple cider vinegar AND chia seeds in my pantry. So I was a bit intimidated when this beastly tray slid in front of me, held together by nothing but prayers and a long toothpick. But, I'm no quitter, so I gathered my wits and tucked in. 

And thank god it wasn't just a pretty face. Hot damn it was good. 

20 minutes and several pointed questions later, nothing but crumbs remained on the tray, except maybe for a little of my dignity. I learned that:

-the onion rings aren't vegan, but Chef Chuck made us up our own vegan batch without the buttermilk. 

- they fry the vegan chicken in the same fryer as the onion rings but NOT in the chicken fryer. We chatted about maybe then getting a fryer for vegan only or frying them in the French fry fryer. I feel like that's a bit nitpicky though. I personally don't have an issue with it. 

- yes the mayo-like sauce on the chicken is vegan, as is the bun. 

- ask about the BBQ sauces and DON'T eat the sauce on the table with the other condiments- it's a chipotle honey.",G4-0IiHDfhsuCM4x1XIh5g,8,2,5,I4wIXdCSahxtzCtAhLUgpg

They have outdoor (2 large picnic tables) and indoor seating with plenty of TVs to watch sports on. We opted for outdoors since the weather was perfect!

Our waiter was friendly and came over right away. The items on the menu are very affordable, especially for a place on Freemont Street in Downtown Las Vegas.  We ordered the bacon burger with avocado and chili cheese fries. Despite being from Texas, where we love our Whataburger and meat, we genuinely enjoyed the burger. It was a perfect size and very flavorful. The patty itself is on the thin side (so get double meat if you're not easily satisfied) but with the bacon, aged cheddar, and avocado, it all comes together beautifully and is a true portion. The chili cheese fries were good too.

2587106,2018-04-22,0,zK7sltLeRRioqYwgLiWUIA,"Soo disappointing.

Two stars, because they actually offer vegan options. Unfortunately, they are not that good.

First off, they advertise local/special beer, but for the flights, your choice is 4/5 of the 5 options that they offer...lol. Two of which were IPAs. No browns on the menu exc 10% ABV Imperial Stout & Guinness....k. I just expected more given the beer in the title. If they didn't advertise their beer, I wouldn't gaf. Just bad marketing there. Their cocktails seem more interesting, but we didn't get one, so I can't comment there.

The vegan onion rings were the best of what we had. The fries weren't bad.

But the vegan chxn burger.......ufff. It was just really seasoned & if you don't like the chosen seasoning, you are SOL. Idk if it was cumin or some rub or Frank's Red Hot or what, but I kinda couldn't escape it in a bite, 'cause it wasn't just the sauce, it was IN the breading on the chxn. The bun was like a school bun & soggy on top & hard on the bottom.

The waitress actually said, ""You don't like it?"", which was super awkward to me, haha.

I understand that it's located in a touristy area near Fremont St, but $56 for a burger meal & drinks for two peeps is steep, considering we aren't at the Wynn/Bellagio or something.

All in all, I appreciate catering to a veg crowd, esp. given the ""down home"" theme that this place has is usually very un-vegan friendly...but I just wish it was done better.

Located in the gateway to East Fremont this burger joint offers fresh made food that will soak up any booze you might have consumed during the evening....or day for that matter because day drinking is fun!  You start by ordering at the counter and you can choose 1,2 or three patties (classic, large, or extra large). Then they have their specialties that include the Flame, Farm, Old Fashioned, BBQ, Cheese, or Bacon Cheeseburgers.  

This visit I went with the large Bacon Cheeseburger and it was delicious.  Topped with traditional lettuce and tomato and some Flippin good sauce and crispy bacon, this is the kind of meal I needed to cap off a night of cocktails and beers in DTLV.  The natural cut fries on the side were seasoned and cooked well.  With a good size portion of fries and a double patty I did not leave Flippin Good hungry.  Reasonable prices make this a win for East Fremont dining.

Quality establishment with some tasty burgers, fresh potato French-fries and real ice cream milk shakes / custard ""concrete"" deserts. Did I mention draft beers too? 

Was there for the ""soft opening"" today and they knocked it out of the park. Bright white decor throughout - might be an issue keeping clean in the future? Right now it works, and the inside looks great. They have rock music playing over the speakers and a giant 70 inch high definition TV on the wall. The menu consist of burgers. Some with bacon, some with jalapenos, some with all of the above (and then some). You can order them as single or double patties. They even have a turkey burger on the menu. The French-fries are delicious and come from fresh cut potatoes. 

I spoke with management and they have plans to stay open until 3am on busy weekend nights / mornings. I expect their late night traffic will be strong with the busy nightlife next-door. Burger combo with a large fries and drink cost about $13. Personally, this is what Downtown needed. I think they are going to succeed in this location and I wish them success with this new restaurant. 

Without hesitation that I recommend Flippin' Good Burgers and Shakes. Good people, and good food.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,2,0,5,hp-YxKtdkhlSHhLlI44bCw

My order was always a double turkey burger (extra pickles, mustard), a side of fries and a water. Total: $7.xx. I know you can find some cheap eats on Freemont, but anytime you can REALLY stuff yourself for under $8, I'm a fan. As for the food itself, it wasn't half bad. Like others have mentioned, it's a step above a McD's, but probably a step down from a BurgerFi or Smashburger. Much respect for having a potato bun, 'merican cheese, fresh veggies (which you can ask them to pile on) and a legit sized patty. The Flippin Sauce on the burg' is no Animal Style from I&O or Mac Sauce, but it's not the worst. Bottom line, when intoxicated or in need of a relatively quick and inexpensive meal, this place isn't a bad place to be. Coat that stomach and rage on!

3166897,2016-06-20,0,zK7sltLeRRioqYwgLiWUIA,"I really wanted to like this place. I was with my ex and the kids closing out our Las Vegas trip and we were wandering around Downtown Vegas trying to find a decent restaurant that wasn't a horribly overpriced chain. 

At our first choice - Hash House a Go Go - we were virtually ignored by staff. I mean seriously, we were standing at the hostess counter for about 10 minutes and none of the staff acknowledged us or came to seat us - thanks a lot, a**holes!

By the time we walked the entire length of Fremont Street we stumbled upon this restaurant by accident and were starving. I love EAT in Downtown Las Vegas however we needed a kid-friendly place that could get the food out promptly as everyone was pretty ""hangry"" (hungry+angry) by the time we got there.

PROS:
-It's brand new so everything is very clean and in good condition.

-Cashier was friendly and professional, seeming to go out of her way to address our concerns (more on that below).

-Has a variety of items on the menu and the frozen custard desserts are something different.

CONS:
-We ordered the Banana Monkey frozen custard and it DID NOT look anything close to the pictures on the menu board. It didn't have any bananas or other toppings in it, and frankly looked pretty pathetic. To their credit, when we complained to the cashier who took our order, she brought us a second frozen custard that was prepared correctly at no charge.

-Food overall was pretty ""meh,"" really nothing to write home. If you're solely a burger joint, you really have to nail it, IMO. Price didn't seem worth it as the food was pretty average.

As Fremont Street is pretty tourist-trappy, you could do worse however in hindsight I wish we went to Pizza Rock instead. Could our grumpiness have attributed to the lower rating? I don't think so. Am hoping some of the issues are related to their ""new-ness"" and that they eventually get the kinks out to can improve operations and quality.",GnsO0wH4sRjppc3Ju3SFNA,0,0,2,-1potlB_srdRLdv4tUye7Q

Yum.

Double Farm Burger (fried egg, grilled onion, smoked bacon, ketchup and melted american cheese) with Onion Rings and regular 16oz Martin & Lewis (vanilla milkshake) came to the total of $14.75. The price is ok but if you only get the burger and onion rings, the amount would be around $10. The prices of the burgers, fries, onion rings are pretty standard but the quality of the food is delicious.

The onions rings are thick cut, well battered and perfectly fried. Everytime I took a bite, it made a wonderful crunch and the onion itself stayed intact with the fried exterior.

UPDATING MY REVIEW SINCE BEING CONTACTED BY OWNER:

So to clarify, we wasted $11 on a melted shake & lame--- fries that should have CAME with our sandwiches. A REFUND would be appropriate, not an invite back to your crappy restaurant that has no place on fremont st. My bf couldn't even finish his meal so I'm actually being nice.

The fries look crispy but they aren't, and they taste weird... The onion rings other people ordered looked much better than the fries tasted.

Along with that they have shakes and malt type drinks. I was looking to get a malt and decided to try the apple pie cement. The picture looked a lot better than what actually came out because it was in a small sized plastic cup, not a regular sized glass with pretty presentation. But it did taste very good! I had gotten the farm burger which comes with bacon and egg. All sandwiches and burgers come with fries. The burger was good, again the presentation wasn't pretty but it was good.

Place is big. With any new restaurant or bar down on Fremont, I always try to remember what was there before. I'm always guessing a defunct check cashing place. It was very nice and clean and plenty of people working behind the counter.

Had trouble picking out what I wanted to eat as there are a variety of options. I decided on the farm burger (fried egg, grilled onion, bacon, American cheese). This is the way to go. Huge fan of eggs on my burger and the meat was juicy. All the ingredients complimented each other and the bun held up to the challenge. Other great thing was that, it didn't get too crazy mushy or anything (a common drawback to having ketchup and fried egg on a burger). I was actually taken aback on how good it was.

I wasn't expecting too much of a semi fast-food burger place on Fremont but this exceeded my expectations. As with all good things, you will wait a bit before your burger is ready, but it's definitely worth it.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,0,4,sEKUlIJvFwPvYVIQxdqRRw

I won't lie to you and tell you I was excited to see it coming into view over the past few months - because truthfully I thought it was just a joke! I would have preferred to see a more local spot owned by people that might charge a bit more for a quality and unique product. Even for a burger joint, it can be done better. It's true that it's around the quality of a McDonald's .. On that I agree with other reviewers that have mentioned it.

I went in last weekend with my boyfriend late at night and ordered two meals. Soon after after we ordered we noticed an employee went up to the front and started turning costumers away and letting them know that they would not be taking orders orders for another 20 min due to being super behind. This went on for a while so we decided to ask him why it was taking so long to get our food, he replied that the grill at the restaurant can only take so many burgers and that they couldn't make too many orders at a time. 

 We spent a while looking around at the same 6 people that were before us and they still did not have their food either. They had two different people pick orders to go (nothing too big) but the whole time the staff just talked, brought signs in from the outside and didn't seem concerned or stressed about the people waiting. 

Let me just say that I've seen more of a hustle at McDonald's!!! I couldn't believe my mind. More than 30 min went by and we still didn't have our food so we decide to go to the manager at the front and ask for a refund because we were starving. The manager decided to reply ""we told you it would be 15 min"" my boyfriend then asked him to see what time the check was printed and he then realized that it had been over 30 min and said, ""oh well your food is ready"" my boyfriend told him off and reminded him that a ""manager"" should always apologize for making people wait for ridiculous amount of time for their ""fast food"" and never give a smart ass reply when being asked for a refund. He then realized his mistake and gave us our money back but with a side of attitude.

How in the flip do you charge your customers almost $1 for one damn onion ring?? I was flipped off when I saw the portion. I even asked the girl that served us about this flippin' small portion & she looked as though she was in full agreement with my dismay!! I wanted more flippin' onion rings but we made due.. I had 2 1/2 & my husband did too.. I was going to be salty and was going to only give 4 stars.. but decided to be flippin' nice & give 5 because the burger was delicious & was under $5 so I'm going to flippin' forgive them for them onion ring hustling their customers.

We walked by Flippin' Good and saw a sandwich board advertising their happy hour insinuating great deals so we decided to check it out.

When we sat down at the bar, we asked the bartender what their happy hour deals were. He said that we could get a Bud Light for $3, a Coors Light for $3, or we could get half of each mixed together for $3. He then proceeded to laugh at his own joke (I'm using the term loosely here) for a solid ten seconds. Those happy hour deals sounded pretty lame to us so we decided to just order some chicken bites. A few minutes later though, he came back saying that he ""spoke with his manager"" and that he could offer a deal that basically amounted to $2-3 off of any beer. This was a much better deal although I'm not sure why we had to go through the whole rigamarole. 

We tried a flight of local Las Vegas beers and a plate of chicken bites which were accompanied by buffalo and cluckin' sauce. The chicken was tasty and both of the sauces added a nice amount of spice to the chicken. The flight offered a diverse array of beers: a pale ale, amber ale, lager, and a double IPA. None of the beers were super impressive, but maybe Las Vegas just doesn't have much of a craft beer scene yet. 

Overall, the chicken was pretty good. The happy hour negotiation was weird. Not sure if we would come back.",2DiEYMcbzJwCYxCRNaRoDw,3,1,3,1zYAvenUWvV6WOLOEnBAeg

The buns they use are the right amount of fluff and taste kind of sweet. They practically fall apart and they remind me of potato bread. The chicken - so flippin' juicy, so flippin' crispy. AND THE FRIES. They have these hot fries with jalape√±os and cheese - maaahhh gawww - sooo good but definitely not for the one who can't handle the heat. If you can't handle the heat, they have their version of animal fries like in n out with the cheese, the sauce, and the grilled onions! Their specialty sauce is just like any specialty sauce that reminds you of thousand island and it's tasty! 

I wanted to evaluate the menu before judging whether or not this place is flippin' good and it flippin' is. Service is awesome too!

4728284,2015-09-16,0,zK7sltLeRRioqYwgLiWUIA,"I'm updating my review from three stars to four based on my most recent visit to Flippin' Good in downtown Las Vegas. On my first visit, I was extremely excited to visit Flippin' Good because I'd been looking for an old fashioned burger and custard place here in Vegas. The store is very nice on the inside, with wide booths and evenly spaced tables, a small counter area with bar stools, and a large flatscreen TV. The outside looks a little hastily painted (as the door handles are already chipping) but it's still very presentable and attractive. 

One of the best qualities of this restaurant is how amazingly CLEAN everything is (a rarity for eateries on Fremont Street). If the employees aren't taking orders or cooking food, they are going around wiping down tables and mopping the floors. 

I had to wait momentarily to place my order as all employees were busy, but the employee who came over apologized sincerely for my wait and patiently took my order. She made sure to carefully make adjustments to my husband's burger (no toppings beside the bacon and cheese), and asked us to make sure that the order on the screen was correct. She had accidentally punched in a 2-patty turkey burger for me but quickly changed it to 1 when I pointed it out.

Be prepared to wait a little bit for your food (approximately 7-8 minutes), but that's because everything is made fresh and piping hot! My husband LOVED his bacon cheeseburger, and while I enjoyed the fresh toppings and homemade bun, my turkey burger was extremely salty. I'll probably just stick with a regular beef burger next time. 

I went back up to the counter and order a brownie concrete (and added banana for 50 cents). At first the concrete was hard to eat (the lid isn't large enough for a spoon to fit through, and the overflow of concrete spilled out onto the counter when I took the lid off), but the combination of brownies, banana, and smooth custard was BOMB! 

I'm sure my husband and I will visit again soon.",sjl8z9XTo0cQGnUedkzIPQ,1,1,4,8Lw9uE6Xa0BHbRjef1cvfw

No greeting at all! Sat at the bar in between shift change I assume. The lovely blonde finishing up didn't say crap; no menu nothing. Whatevs... Dylan her replacement was even worse. He literally looked like he just crawled out of bed. After placing my order I realized I didn't purchase any sauce and requested Dylan charge me for the additional sauces.

FGB is a cross between McDonald's and Smashburger, but waaaay closer to the McD's side. It's fast food. It's no IN-N-Out, it's not even Carl's Jr worthy. Yes, it's cleaner than a McD's and the staff is definitely friendlier, but it's just not special.

I ordered a classic cheeseburger and a side of fries. The burger was bland, overcooked, served in a big ass bun (really, it's mostly buns, hun) and came with the lettuce, onion, and tomato (which were all fresh and still crisp). The fries were fries. Again, nothing to write home about.

There was a vivacious bartender from upstate New York called Kayleigh (or something like that).  She was quite witty and engaged in light hearted banter about the 'Bills' and their historic failings in the Superbowl.
I like IPA's, so she recommended one of the local brews on top, and it was delicious.
I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and was very happy with the quality of burger meat, Applewood bacon (yummy), and freshness of all the vegetables.  The chips (fries as you American's call them) were crispy and tasty.
Definitely one of the best burgers I have had for a long time.

I got the vegas hot instead, since he said ""that one is normal hot"". It was not normal hot, I could of done it, but the sandwich was caked in half an inch of rub. There was just hot rub everywhere, to the point where I had to take the breading off of the chicken just to eat it. 

Once the server came back at the end, he told us how he likes to purposely push people to order the flippin hot by telling them its not that hot just to see them sweat it out and burn their mouths from the heat.

Casual eating smack in the middle of the Eastern Freemont Downtown action, reasonably priced for the location- burgers start at around $5, but are served a-la cart. 
Clean, bright and family friendly.
Beer on tap, and thank you lord, it's not just Bud Light and Shock Top- they offer Alaska Amber. At $4.75 for 16 OZ, it's not a bad proposition.
Three kids items on menu. 
Burgers are tasty, but not out of this world, just ok.

The ""meh"":
Who doesn't love some kick? Be careful though, if you ask for jalape√±os, you are getting JALAPE√ëOS. Fresh, unseeded, and LOTS and of them, completely overbearing any flavor of the burger. 
Fries are very average, and the ""secret sauce"" is little more than thousand island. 
Shakes are tasty, but the picture in no way matched the finished product- none of the presentation or flare in the menu pic- it looks like a small boring plastic cup filled with a less than generous helping of whatever flavor shake you went for. Don't know that it's worth $5.
Overall- ok, got that one crossed off the list, no need to come back.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,0,0,3,RWixFj5sfxjyPe3eFfJa9Q

Today we visited around 1:30pm it wasn't too crowded for a Saturday. We walked in and was immediately given a warm welcome and nice smile. 

We walked up to the counter to order our food and was immediately impressed with their staff that took our order. She was very friendly. We ordered a Flippin' Good Cheeseburger Double patty-$7.45
Bacon Cheeseburger single-5.95
Kids Grilled Cheese-$1.95
Flippin' Fries-$4.25
Onion Rings-$3.95
Fountain drink large-$2.65 x2
Brownie Delight-$4.25
Total tab-$35.80

The food came out fast and everything tastes delicious. Onion rings was very crunchy and fresh. Burgers were great tasting and fries was also delicious as well with the grilled onions and Flippin' sauce.
The Cherry Coke was tasting awesome because it was set to the right syrup / Soda water setting. Brownie Delight was very delicious too.

We usually do not eat at Fremont, due to the fact that we have not had the best food experiences here in the past. However, we decided to give this place a chance since we were downtown already and, hey! Who can say no to a good burger?! The menu has about six burgers, but we got the Flippin good burger and a side of fries. First, let me just say that I am happy that there is a place that does not over salt their fries. These fries are pretty damn good... They are fresh, and have the right amount of salt. The burgers were fresh, and the Flippin sauce was a good touch. You can tell by the taste and quality that they do use fresh ingredients, which is a MAJOR plus in my book, because who likes a poorly made burger. I didn't have a chance to try the milkshakes or ice cream ( mostly due to the fact that I was stuffed from the burger and fries) however, I do plan to return here before the summer is over or during the life is beautiful festival.

I ordered a white chocolate macadamia crunch (vanilla custard with fresh baked macadamia nut cookies and Ghirardelli white chocolate sauce). My milkshake was delicious. All of the ingredients blended great together. Milkshakes are made to order, so expect a wait. If you like macadamia nut cookies, definitely? try FGBS cookie milkshake.

When it first opened up it was essentially an in n out knock off that was nicknamed flipping mediocre. Which is why when my mind was blown when I walked in here recently and it was completely different. The inside has been remodeled to have more group friendly seating. The menu has also streamlined to be burgers and chicken sandwiches. The food is definitely of a higher quality and you get to choose your heat with the chicken. I will say the Vegas and the Flippin can get pretty hot, so beware before you order. 

My only two gripes with them is that sometimes the wait can get a bit long and you just have to roll with it because it's right in the middle of downtown so that's understandable. My other major issue is that you don't get fries, or any side when you order a burger or sandwich. If I'm paying $9 for a burger, I shouldn't really have to add $4 more for fries or onion rings.",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,1,0,5,yFMKDEw0DzPhZyz9-EOw-g
