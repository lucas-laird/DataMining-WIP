I and 7 of my buddies signed up for the gold package for bullets and burgers, which included the 50 Cal sniper rifle. Needless to say, we had the best time. All of us walked away grinning from ear to ear, and we were comfortable and taken care of the entire time I was there. Jordan, Barry, and Brandon (the 2 range instructors) were great people. We were a bunch of nerdy tourists, but they respected us, didn't talk down to us, and maybe even enjoyed our company! 

My group has already started talking about how we will find a way back here as Bullets and Burgers are still upgrading their facilities and their arsenal. They have some interesting plans (helicopters and bullets.... At the same time??). I will be back.",rvzxWVVQyWIHbxPghFXrGw,1,2,5,55x5PcUaey9J72RuWwR4jg

I do disagree with some of the reviewers that it's not as fun if you're an experienced shooter (because I'm sorry, but no matter how many more guns I purchase I will never own a .50 cal Barrett sniper rifle). This place is great! The guys that run this place really do put safety first (unfortunately like anywhere accidents can happen). We had very few failures while on the range and most of the equipment our group used was in great condition (also being from the east coast, I have few opportunities to shoot outside in the desert which was another fun factor). At the end of your experience (we had 7 people doing the platinum package) you get to have one of the best burgers in America (and honestly who doesn't want a huge burger after sweating out on the range for a couple of hours?). This place is jam packed with unique opportunities you aren't going to find at your average shooting range even if you are an experienced shooter. It's a novelty experience, not one you're likely to do every weekend, but a few times a year when you visit Vegas.  I cannot sing the staff's praises enough! Great group of guys!!  This is a definite must do if you've been itching to get your hands on some fun guns and happen to be in Vegas with your buddies.",dX-EG3H5ftWCnqW-GU0Pkg,0,2,5,9ZQ-wOlugSPK5T5ouNnwxQ

The instructors at the range were patient and informative. They also did a great job to help us have fun and feel safe. Afterwards we ate the burgers which were absolutely delicious....I was craving another one when I got back home, too bad it is several miles outside of Vegas!

We then rode the monster truck which was really fun and exciting! THEN we went to the hoover dam. It was really a LOT of stuff packed into the tour so you get a lot of bang for your buck .. literally! Lol

I would highly recommended this tour to anyone who wants to have a great time, have an amazing burger and shoot guns with professional and fun instructors!",sqOY0JmQeUXVj2S4wm2_Ig,2,1,5,18JM9S_xj9FwtF3ahNPw8w

We had a great time and truly enjoyed our 20 mile round trip ride on the ATV's through the desert.  We also had the best time at the range, shooting a large selection of fully automatic weapons.  The weather was perfect and the experience was truly overwhelming.  A Huge THANK YOU to our guide, Brandon Taylor,  for a wonderful day!  I would highly recommend this adventure and Brandon to anyone seeking a Great Time in the desert and an awesome time at the range.",t915J2Cz0sMYQk-nEwA0Ng,1,1,5,K0ApVCB2Rb4KBJmVsj3MiA
4163525,2015-02-02,0,9Bu4mbMrtSq6lrAtSjJq2w,"This was a tremendous experience, period.  Would it have been more fun to have additional rounds?  Of course, but they were stacked up this weekend and we needed to rush a bit.  That being said, they did everything to make it ""right""

Expect the standard ""up-sell"", we originally bought the bronze package and were up-sold to Gold that includes shooing a 50 CAL sniper rifle.  WOW

This was a great decision and an amazing experience that I would recommend to anyone.  Just a heads up that the location is 52 miles off-strip and a requirement as it is apparently a law that a 50 CAL cannot be shot within 50 miles of an airport.  Having now shot one, I can understand why.  Our driver's name is Joel and he was a pleasure to have on the experience as he was both, into guns as well as the history of where we were driving.

4528911,2013-05-24,0,9Bu4mbMrtSq6lrAtSjJq2w,"I was looking for an exciting, unusual, and big time blowout surprise for my boyfriend's birthday present. A friend had told me about Bullets and Burgers, so I looked it up online. After reading through the website, I thought 'this might really be 'The Place!' ... so I called.

I spoke with Russ and explained that I was looking for a unique and fabulous experience gift for my BF. I have to say, WOW! Russ really listened and helped me set up a gift package that would ROCK!

Russ had gone over all the details and set everything up so we could just have at it when we got there. Our appointment was for 1P and sure enough, when we pulled in, there was Russ, Ali and Robert waiting for us. I think Bill was in shock for the first 8 minutes or so, because he had always wanted to shoot the Big Guns and now, HE WAS GOING TO!

Ali took charge of us and showed us the large array of guns we could shoot. He let us check them out and then decide on the ones we wanted to shoot. We also added a few more rounds, heh heh!

After a short safety briefing (we explained that we both have CCW permits) we headed out to the huge outdoor range. WOW! We went down into a bunker to shoot the first 3 guns. Ali was right there, patient and super and willing to help us in any way. He was so nice and quite funny. To be honest, I think he was the icing on the cake! Anyway, he gave us our eyes and ears and let us have at it - TOTAL BLAST!

We then walked over to the long range shooting gallery to shoot the .50 calibers. HOLY FRIKEN COW, MAN! Now THERE is a WEAPON. One again, Ali was key to our fun as he exudes expertise and ability - after all, there is nothing better than to have total confidence in a guy who is shooting a gun that can blow up a tank. Yet he was fun and delightfully entertaining. He made us feel like VIPs, stars of the show. I do not know how else to say it, but he made us feel like it was his mission to give us the best time possible while we were in his company. And the outdoor range was spectacular!

Once we finished shooting all of our guns, Ali took several pictures of us in different poses holding a few of the guns for our Memoirs, lol! If we had not looked so funny (the wind was BLOWING by the time we took pics, wild hair) I would have posted them.

We headed back to the 'barracks' to wind down. Russ had come back over to greet us. He took our burger order (medium rare X 2!), drink order and called it in so the restaurant could start on it.

We then walked over to the restaurant and ate a SPECTACULARLY FABULOUS, TASTY AS IT GETS burger! Now mind you, I am a picky eater and particularly when it comes to beef. I had read all the reviews where ppl had exclaimed about how good the burgers here are.... And thought, 'whaaaaaatever'. But I am here to tell you, they serve SUPERIOR TASTING burgers. Even if you do not shoot the guns, HAVE THE BURGER.

Once we finished, Russ sent out a big, hot Birthday brownie with a giant scoop of yummy ice cream on the top! OMGOSH!! What a great surprise! He should open a hotel there, because, after all this, we kinda didn't want to leave.

If you want to shoot Big Guns - DON'T MISS THIS PLACE! Like a great Burger - DON'T MISS THISPLACE! Want to surprise someone with a fun, unique, and wholly VIP experience - DON'T MISS THIS PLACE!
This is the first place ever that I do not have a Helpful Hint on how to improve - It really was perfect and I can't recommend Russ, Ali and Bullets& Burgers enough.",zdBimmPhkpN4xM3cYk6KQw,0,0,5,HYiS3GXSfOSH9S6vG5b87A
5014723,2017-10-30,0,9Bu4mbMrtSq6lrAtSjJq2w,"Had a decent time but it was not nearly as much fun as I had doing something similar with the Vegas Off Road Experience last year.

Here are my issues-

1) What people really want is to shoot some guns and take some cool photos.  The website for Bullets and Burgers shows people holding cool guns and or getting ready to shoot where you can clearly see the person doing the shooting.  When you arrive they tell you you can only take pictures from a small barrier behind the shooter and a little to the side.  This means you are taking a picture of someones back and it could be anyone for all the person looking at the picture knows.  That sucks from an I want to remember this experience perspective.

2) The package I got says you also get to ""Walk the Hoover Dam Bridge"".  I have never been to the Hoover Dam so I assumed this meant I would be on the Hoover Dam.  Not so.  I got to take a quick hike to a bridge that looks at the Hoover Dam from quite a distance away- What???",aHbQipMd86u4Rrfzlfl5RA,2,1,3,ieRLtRGFFdupRhQ9p5UPXg
5049111,2015-03-23,1,9Bu4mbMrtSq6lrAtSjJq2w,"This is not your typical Sunday morning gun range.  It is a chance to go full-auto on a litany of machinery that is scarcely available anywhere.  Our driver was more than personable and apologetic that he was late as the group  in front of us didn't have their act together.  Corralling a bunch of guys on a bachelor party is hard enough so I get it.

They explain to you that you are not here to improve your accuracy, learn how to be a better shooter or even learn how the guns work.  They make sure the recoil doesn't get you and that you can handle the gun, then switch you to full-auto and let you just blast away.

That said, there were a few safety concerns that I had where an instructor was demonstrating with a pistol the proper way to hold it (and what not to do) and although he cleared the slide and it had no magazine, he pointed it downrage while another officer was hanging up targets.  There were also times when dozens of guns and ammo were left out on the table while the instructors walked/ran away to their storage unit in the range pit to get more guns and ammo.  The 15 of us stood around and looked at each other while there was no personnel immediately around to ensure nobody did anything stupid.  There were also a lot of jams on our guns - it seemed half of the subs and machine guns had issues.

The Barrett .50 is a hell of a machine and was a beast to fire - but the first shooter in our group experienced an FTE (failure to eject casing) after his first shot and as he wasn't familiar with guns, had no idea what was going on  Neither instructor saw the FTE.  I had to yell out to them before they jumped in and cleared the jam.  

Lastly, the targets are simply pieces of paper hung up on a string tether and they bob up and down in the wind.  The tether broke several times throughout the shooting session, resulting in a 5-minute stoppage to replace and re-hang the targets which are pointless anyways since we are going full auto.  I think it would be a ton more fun to use bargain-brand soda or water bottles as targets to give the shooters something to hit that gives feedback.   

The hubcaps and bowling pins on the machine gun range were chopped to pieces and laying in the sand downrange so again, target feedback would have made this a lot cooler.  I realize the Barrett .50 vaporizes a yoga-ball sized circle around the impact point but still....

As a person who owns guns and shoots regularly, I had a good time with my buddies and can see how a novice shooter would find this a blast.  I would happily tag along again for another group outing but wouldn't book on my own.",sbVPOGXCoU87oT8zI5pw9Q,11,2,3,ldfw58Srx7xaNjBd-Bcz1Q
5257179,2018-03-12,0,9Bu4mbMrtSq6lrAtSjJq2w,Thank you Johnny and the team at Las Vegas Outdoor Adventures  for an awesome Sunday adventure on ATVs .

5465935,2015-12-10,2,9Bu4mbMrtSq6lrAtSjJq2w,"I'm going to be upfront and say that I'm not a gun guy.  To each their own, but I AM, however, an ""experience"" guy.  New and quirky stuff draws me in like you wouldn't believe, and since I've been adventure deficient of late, I needed a new experience.

We started out with a drive 51 miles out (the amount of miles needed to be able to shoot higher end guns) to Arizona.  Our guide Rick shared all sorts of stories about what these high powered guns can do, as well as stories about Las Vegas, as he is a born and raised local.

We get out to Arizona Last Stop, which turns out to be more than some tiny little gas station on that BFE drive out from Vegas to Kingman.  We got out, and walked to this below ground bunker where we could fire a selection of weapons in peace (Tip: Let Rick pick your selection out for you. He's ex-military, and knows his business for ""fun"" selections).

The shooting experience feels a bit fast, but no one is rushing you.  They give you a run-through and stay with you to ensure gun safety for everyone.  The rounds were fun, and despite my inexperience, I did manage to hit a bullseye with one of the military grade firearms.  Shooting the gun from the Jeep was my personal favorite.

After the shooting, we went on this Guinness Records awarded monster truck, which was HUGE.  You strap inside this multi-seated vehicle, and go for a ride on a test course.  It rides weird.  Not bad weird, just weird in a way that's hard to describe to you, o' reader.  It felt and looked like something out of Burning Man.

We had our burgers, all freshly made there, and they are good with lots of fixings.  After our meal, we hopped back into our shuttle to hear more of Rick's stories, as well as a brief stopover at the Hoover Dam.  It's a full experience.  You see and do a lot on this tour, and Rick was great.

As I said, this may not be a ""usual"" thing for me, but it was an entertaining experience, and I had fun doing something so off the beaten path.  They do ATVs and motorcycle tours as well (and helicopters are coming), so they are definitely diverse, and it's something that you won't experience on a standard tour of Vegas.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,4,2,5,hZaEN1U-e3DErl6SZ7mmiA
