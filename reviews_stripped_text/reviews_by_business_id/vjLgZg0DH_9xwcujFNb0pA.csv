The food tasted kinda stale and funky. I've been here twice and the second time was no different than the first. The orange chicken doesn't taste like orange chicken and my sister felt the same way. Their rice was also stale the second time around. It's OKAY but definitely not the best. It's like a last resort place to eat",nqZ1G0v4rfMMKxMPMXNYUw,2,0,2,u1QoAGi0Kz9-x3M9oYIPNw

None of the food trays are labeled leaving you to guess what mystery dish awaits you. Fried items were overcooked with very little attention paid to details or any finesse of the ingredients.

No bowls were available and when I asked for bowls one of the waiters said, ""oh thats not my job to give you a bowl"" and walked away.

989358,2014-06-25,1,vjLgZg0DH_9xwcujFNb0pA,"I understand that $6.99 is a very cheap price for  buffet food however this was the nastiest Chinese buffet that I have ever eaten at.

Once I arrived and paid I had to use the restroom which was discusting. The urinal had a hefty bag taped over it and the restroom smelled like a sewer. The sink basin literally had corn all over it and in the sink. I am not sure if someone was sick however it left the impression that management is not checking the restroom on their own. I will say I alerted the manager and he got someone on it. The restroom had trash all over the floor. The health department should close the restroom because it's so disgusting. Should have left and went somewhere else based on this experience alone however we gave them a chance. 

 They had no sweet and sour chicken - I asked and was told ""not today"". The food did not appear to be fresh. The only good thing was the chicken in the Broccoli Chicken. The calamari rings looked fresh however it tasted old. The temperature of the food was not hot. The desert station did not have much selection and the one roll we tried was hard and dry. 

Avoid eating in this place. Take your $6.99 and pay a little more for another place with better quality foods and selection. 

The health department should take a look at this place, it's hard to believe they have an ""A"" rating in the window.",aiOp4lhnH-nezm6PqX4VcA,2,1,1,NAc0GlYn2qZOQzDBYtlU-A

2759588,2013-08-01,5,vjLgZg0DH_9xwcujFNb0pA,"Ok, so the large 6.99 AYCE signs is what brought me in. Judging by the reviews, it was either gonna be hit or miss. Since it is only 4 reviews so far, I would say giving them a try was the least I can do. To my pleasant surprise, it was actually decent.

First off, drinks are not included in the price so be aware of that. If you refer to my pic on the tip, I think kids are cheaper. Other than that, the food is actually edible meaning they have your basic Chinese items. The best way I can describe it is they are comparable to a Panda Express but with more choices. To me this is a good deal because with Panda, you only get 2 or 3 choices for about 10 bucks.
 
What actually got my attention was that they have a Mongolian Grill section. That alone is worth the 6.99 price. Come on, you get to put all the veggies and sauce you want. Then you give it to the dude that grills it for you. He will ask you if you want pork, beef, or chicken to go with your veggies and sauce. I went with all 3. I can easily eat 2 full plates of this stuff and im set.

For dessert, they have the basics you will always see at all the other Chinese buffets. Things like fruits, jello, cookies, and frozen yogurt.

Service was tolerable. We came in, got to our table, got our food, and ate. The servers basically just make sure you get your drinks and take any excess plates. No complaints here.

So for 6.99 all day everyday is not a bad deal at all! Just don't expect gourmet top of the line food.  Right now they have an eat free for your birthday special with proof of I.D. Give these guys a try, I thought they were ok.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,13,8,3,CbSaqXC6DJ9DwWqWYunFCg

For anyone who is reading this review, I beg you, please do not embark this heinous journey. This restaurant is a shamble. The food was glossed with generous layer of grease, prawns were fried a ridiculous brownness, pineapples were moving and the broccoli beef? Was semi-cooked. How do you screw up broccoli beef? Even Panda Express does a better job. 

There are ton of amazing places to eat here in Vegas so do your stomach, soul and future self a big favour and well, walk away. Sure, it's $7 all-you-can-eat fake Chinese food but you better be prepared for a long date with your bathroom. (Edit: To be fair, since it is $7, and the restaurant didn't try to hype up the food...

First off, the customer service is HORRID. I walked in expecting to be welcomed but instead it was almost the exact opposite.

We ordered our drinks in the front and we took our seats in the very back which was nice and I couldn't help loving the deco. It's just beautiful in there (this earned the stars) 

However It's a bit misleading . Or actually I want to say extremely. The pictures on the wall picture food that do not even exist there . I was excited when I saw the pictures but that excitement quickly vanished when I made my way to the buffet line . Nothing on the pictures were there , false advertisement ? Maybe .

The cream cheese wontons had no cream cheese in them and the ones that did were dehydrated and crummy.  The rest of the food overall was not bad, the ambiance was beautiful.

Price is $6.99 for an AYCE all day, every day. Extra for drinks
Unfortunately, this has to be one of the worst Chinese buffets I've ever been to (if not worst..)

Horrible service- ordered our drinks at front cashier when we walked in. The servers failed to give us our drinks until we reminded them maybe 15 minutes later. Also failed to refill any of our drinks and did not pick up ANY of our dirty plates. One whole side of our table was stacked full of dirty plates, and it wasn't until we were on our very last dessert plate did they come by to pick them up.

Food- It seriously tasted like I was eating the same thing with every dish. There aren't so many choices.  It was all also really really salty.. Felt my blood pressure rising with every bite. Friend thought that the soups were a hit or miss (mostly miss..). Everything was either decent or just bad.
The tastiest thing was the ice cream- At least that was good! 

Environment- at least the place was clean and pretty filled up! Being a Chinese buffet, it was weird to not see any Asians (beside myself & my friend) eating there. I should have caught that first warning sign..
