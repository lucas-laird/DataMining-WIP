This was my first year going and I look forward to going next year.  I didn't arrive until mid afternoon so I missed some bands I was hoping to see.  However, I got to see Purple Rain, One Republic and GooGoo Dolls perform a few songs before we left early to beat the crowd. Which brings me to the reason I'm only giving 3 stars.  As I said, we left 1 hour before the concert was over, it took us approximately 15 minutes to get to the vehicle.  It took us ONE HOUR to get out of the parking lot.  There was very little organization to the parking lot I was located at. Apparently people who were far behind me began fighting. Thank goodness I wasn't in that crowd.  When the concert let out, everything got worse.  So I'm hoping you all fix the parking issue or find a bigger park with ample parking and organization to boot!",1tRZCWlt2BEm9FlTaaiGLw,0,0,3,2PuoPkhQGSzaYLUPKxpLww

Nothing would stop me in 2012. Matchbox Twenty as the headliner? Counting Crows on the lineup? All the noms I could possibly of in one area? $15 for pre-sale admission? You had me reeled in before you even cast the bait.

The event lasts from 11 am to 9 pm, but you can come whenever you'd like. Just remember that there's no re-entry. There were so many food venues to choose from that everyone will find something they'll like at a cost of $3 to $10 per item. I picked up a delicious chicken gyro and fried calamari from the Mad Greek Cafe booth.

Event logistics seemed well-organized with their volunteers and security definitely on top of their duties. The booths had ample space for lines and even small dining areas. If you're willing to shell out the extra cash, there is a raised VIP section behind , but I personally love the feel of standing close to the outdoor stage.

The live music left me speechless. I managed to make my way through the throng of Ed Sheeran fangirls to the front of the crowd, so my short Asian self had a great view of the stage for Counting Crows and Matchbox Twenty. Can I just say that they really know how to put on a show? An extended set until MB20 gets kicked off the stage? Seriously, it's a dream come true for this almost lifelong fan.

Every minute was worth it. From parking my car on the rocky dirt lot to watching my favorite band in concert live for the first time, this event was hands down worth all the waiting and the money. Mix 94.1's gonna have a hard time topping this one.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,5,3,5,47GHv2OATJVQqTdAYEvcwQ
187401,2010-10-26,0,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"This was my third year attending Bite of Las Vegas. Is it just me or is Switchfoot the main headliner EVERY year? I was very excited to hear that Sara Bareillis was performing as she is one of my favorite artists. 

I agree with Heather, even though there were the same amount of booths as last year, there were noticeably less FOOD booths. I even noticed some booth's charging $6 for certain items, I thought all portions were to be between $1-$5. 

The parking situation was HORRIBLE, I knew not to park in the Flamingo/Twain but I was still stuck in the rocky gravel. It would be fine if they had some kind of control of the aisles. Their were huge gaps between rows and cars that could have made parking a lot easier for many. My friend mistakenly went to the Flamingo lot and was told the only way out was to jump the curb, in a Honda Accord! That is unacceptable at an event where there is an entrance fee. They should have enough money from ticket sales to afford proper parking attendants. Less American Idol rejects, more parking attendants!

The food was really good and I definitely overindulged, I do like the layout of the event. You basically make a loop and try out whatever you want.",H-QtPvPgVNUcuPKq8yAyCQ,1,1,3,HsEvV13550X3DDuQx73TIQ

476625,2015-09-12,0,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"First time ever at this festival and was excited to have some fun and see some great bands. Even paid for a nice teenaged kid to get admission in. It was actually a bit of a mess and well I guess you get what you pay for right !? ($13 Groupon deal) Anyways we enter the festival walked all the way to the back area where Coors light blue VIP area was, dying for a cold beer and the security guard said we needed to purchase a wristband and told us to walk all the way back to the front. So we walk ALL THE WAY back to the front in 106 degrees Fahrenheit only to have the people at the front say ""you have to go to the blue hospitality tent inside."" We walk ALL THE WAY BACK talk to the 2 new guards at Coors light blue tent (one with a huge attitude and not very nice) and they said walk to another area--that's where blue tent is. We walk to THAT AREA and they send us all the way back to the front AGAIN! Are u kidding me!? We saw someone actually barfing from heat stroke with medics around and they send us on wild goose chase?! I was about to leave at that point but guess what, there's NO re-entry allowed! Are you trying to NOT make a profit with this event? It was terribly annoying. So we decided to stay a little longer to see if anything would improve. AND...well, it did. I had to update/upgrade my 1 star on this event to 2 star because as I was hunting down some shade too cool off over by the stage, I ran into and met Andy Grammer!! He took a photo with me and so we stayed to listen to him play and enjoyed that part very much. I guess I must've manifested a better time! LOL  Oh and the food stands were at least pretty great and t hey vegan options too! Other than that, this wasn't the greatest festival I've ever been to. It could be improved if they trained the staff better.",0PDuIlK-VLy3oZNngNeaWQ,0,0,2,7jHK_MYosoGJYjskL6Gv2g
585824,2012-10-01,6,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"I came across this event while browsing Yelp for stuff to do. I was somewhat disbelieving when I finished reading the advert for this food festival and they tagged on to the end, almost as an afterthought, that there would be a bit of live music...including Ed Sheeran! 

The line up changed a few times (originally Alanis Morisette was appearing) and I was waiting for Sheeran's name to disappear too. I checked again before leaving for the event, his name was still there, due to play towards the end of the 11-9 day.

Having parked for free, in the quickly filling field across the road, I walked into the Desert Breeze Park for a minimal fee of $15. This was obviously well advertised, most of the area in front of the stage was already a patchwork of blankets. 

The smell of food immediately made me hungry. Every 20 yards brought a new aromatic assault; barbeque, asian, burgers. Each stall had to have dishes for $5 or less...many were $3. These were all tasters from local restaurants, stall holders talked about their restaurant and gave out tickets for 20% off when you next eat there.

After eating my body weight in garlic chicken and rice I went to find a position at the front of the growing crowd by the stage (using my freshly garlicked breath to my advantage). It seemed everyone there was waiting for Sheeran to take to the stage, the organisers obviously knew this and put on the less popular bands first. It was becoming a battle of wills...who would give up their spot in the blazing sun to bathe their heads, for a moment, in the relative coolness of the shade? I gave up...two more acts to go...I found a large truck to sit under and guzzle water, but on hearing the crowd roar I was able to squeeze into, maybe, the third row back. 

Ed Sheeran is AMAZING! He was just on stage for 25 minutes (10minutes more than I banked on) but it was totally worth it.This event was real treat. The food was great, the guys on the stalls weren't pushy, the music was awesome. If there was a downside to the day, it was not being able to get out of the sun. Although fans were being handed out for free and you could buy water, I would suggest next year that hats and sun umbrellas be on sale and the limit, of bringing only one bottle of water with you, be lifted. The crowd thinned out a lot after Sheeran and I know, for me, if it had been cooler or more shady, I'd have stuck around for more garlic chicken and rice :)",TY1sDQJaw-iSGNZQTG68hQ,9,6,4,opBpt3o4pUqtq-sy1Gjk8w
664115,2012-09-30,0,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"This review is for the 2012 Bite of Las Vegas.  I had never been before.

Holy cow this thing was awesome.  I didn't show up until 7pm and it closes at 8pm so I was a little apprehensive but my gf still wanted to go.  I'm so glad we did.  Parking was FREE but it's at this really rocky dirt lot and I can't help but wince at thinking of what the poor tires are going through driving over all those rocks.  It was 15 bucks at the door, which let us in to a grassy area with a bunch of food trucks/tents.  We had just missed the Counting Crows concert, and we knew Matchbox 20 was going to be on soon, so we didn't have a chance to shop around.  I was seriously wondering if we kind of made a mistake coming here so late and if this would be a ripoff.

We found a vendor with no line (Bahama Breeze), grabbed a plate of habanero wings and fries for $5, and gorged on that while waiting in the longer line for H&H BBQ.  10 more bucks got us a sampler bbq plate and fried catfish.  Yum.  Then Matchbox 20 was on and well, that was the reason for this 5 star review.

Amazeballs.  The first thing they do is come out and say... ""Hey everyone we love you for coming out here, and I know we're supposed to close at 9 but we are just gonna play until they kick us out"".  Suddenly my respect for Matchbox 20 just went up several notches.  I didn't realize just how many songs of theirs I had heard on the radio over the years.  They sure were one of those bands I hear in the background on the radio, kind knew their name and all, but never really knew anything about them.  Really love how energetic they were and how dedicated they are to showing appreciation to their fans (or in my case winning over a new one).

Anyway now I'm totally kicking myself for not coming to this thing earlier.  Still, 15 bucks alone is totally worth a two hour Matchbox 20 concert.  Everything else was gravy.  I can't imagine the value this thing would have been if I got to see Counting Crows as well, plus had a chance to gorge myself on much more of the food.  Definately can't wait to come back.",F-30y9xB6szLkn22jc8rQQ,2,0,5,J8PgHPXYlahuuoZpDpJIpA
895276,2014-09-29,1,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"This festival was a waste of my money. I paid $20 to get in and still had to pay for food on top of that. I would have rather paid a little more and actually had ""bites"" of Las Vegas--unlimited or inexpensive tasting portions of food from local restaurants. Of the 55+ food vendors,  80% were fast food, ""fair/ carnival"" food, and chain restaurants. Of the few local places, their offerings were very limited. Hash House A Go-Go (known for fabulous breakfast food), only had a burger and a lemonade offered. Papa Johns had their pizzas delivered. Very few places to sit and eat..a couple of dirty picnic tables. 

As for music, I arrived at 7pm to hear Daughtry play at 8pm. My friend ordered one ""gourmet"" pancake from Stacks & Yolks which took 15 minutes to make after she ordered. What?! Another friend (vegetarian) wanted a slice a cheese pizza (very few vegetarian options available) and we waited for Papa Johns to get pizza delivered. By the time we walked over to the stage area at 8:30, Daughtry had left the stage. No other band came on and by 9 pm the festival was packing up.

1244550,2012-10-01,0,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"This year was the first time I had gone to this event. In short I LOVED IT!!

I had seen a commercial on tv and heard Ed Sheeran was going to be there, I bought my tickets the next day. My plan was to go a little later in the day to avoid the heat since Ed wasnt going on until 5pm, but the group I went with wanted to go earlier to see a band that was playing at 12pm. I will say that the heat was a bit overbearing at times. They were passing out hand fans that helped and of course freezing cold beer! If you act interested enough you can find some shade at a few vendors too. You can also walk down into the park and find a nice shady tree to sit under. We were close enough to still hear the music and thats where we enjoyed most of our food.

I thought everything was well priced. Ticket $15, Parking Free, Drinks $3-5, Food $1-5. I ended up spending 40 bucks for the entire day from 11:30am to 6pm (LONG day) but well worth it. My only intention was to go see Ed Sheeran play, but I was actually glad that I got the full experience!! 

The only thing I was turned off about (besides the heat) was that people had shown up early (even earlier then me) and ""set up camp"" by laying out full size blankets and sheets in front of the stage. Only leaving a few inches in between to walk through. It was pretty annoying when trying to make our way to the stage and tip toeing around them. I was actually surprised when we got dirty looks or even a comment or two for stepping on their disgusting dirty blankets. 

All in all I would definetely go back! Even if one of my favorite artists wasnt playing.

Oh and Ed Sheeran was AMAZING. Which was no surprise!",-gO-X4lMH1eKnic4Z-bdCQ,1,0,5,BevPMzVkAr9R2GpLAmzr1g
1339974,2014-09-28,1,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"This was my first time attending but I was volunteering through Meetup for the Burn Foundation working the beer tents. Parking wasn't hard to find since I arrived early (11:10am) & was easily directed towards the front gate. Would have been nice to have signs on Spring Mountain advertising the event. The line to get inside was long but lucky me I didn't have to wait in it due to working the event. It would have been nice to of had some signs up in the park making people aware of which way to go for food, bathrooms, stage, etc. Or maybe a map? You pretty much had to just walk around to find things. I also think it would be easier & less confusing if the park had a ticket booth for people to buy their tickets for booze & food vs @ the stands. Things may had moved along quicker when at these tents with people only having to deal with tickets vs cash. Also they should have signs up @ booze & food tents that state Cash Only and advertise on the website for this. ( I don't believe this was on there) Though there were ATM's it would of saved some people the ATM fee's who don't carry cash. 

I found customers a little confused when coming up to the beer tent. They bought tickets at one table then went to the table next to it to hand their ticket in for a drink & get carded. One customer had made a valid point. ""Why am I being sold a ticket without getting carded if you know I'm going to be buying a drink."" Good point!! A lot of people were headed to the tables where the volunteers were handing out drinks wanting to get one but hadn't bought their tickets yet to have to be told to go to the table next to them first. Very unorganized & then the fact that they had to go to another tent for wine or hard liquor. 

I unfort. didn't get to eat too much food because I was having fun passing out beer having a blast & our tent was busy. I did get some chinese food that wasn't bad, found it a little expensive $10 (mine was free) for the combo plate. Included rice, noodles, chicken & a small egg roll. The egg roll was the best!! My friend had gotten some mini bundt cakes to share that were delicious!! But Anything but Bundt is a favorite of mine. Their cake are always so fresh tasting & moist. When I walked by there the line was long. That's a great sign of how delicious their products are. 
My friend also shared some pretzel bites with melted dipping cheese, I think he said they were from Hard Rock cafe? They were pretty good but I bet they are even better if I was able to eat them when they were warm. My friend was able to walk around & check out the food stands & said there were a few that had food for $4-$5...what a great deal esp. for one who wants to try several items esp. from places they may not have eaten at. 
As the day went on the place got so crowded. Unfort. you couldn't hear the music from the beer tent I was working @ (near the food) & had to go near the stage to hear them. I think its awesome they let you bring in selected chairs to sit on and/or a blanket since there really isn't much seating in the park. 

 Another one of my friend's went & did the VIP section for $100 that included parking but she had said they ended up running out of food (around 6pm). I know I would  have been a little upset to have spent that amt. of $$$ on VIP to end up not being able to eat when I wanted to. These tickets are bought prior to the event so you would have thought they could have planned that better. 

It's definitely an event worth checking out when its back next year. If your not a big fan of huge crowds I'd recommend going early afternoon & getting out of there before it gets too busy, more so early evening. 
Bring plenty of cash, an appetite, blanket or chair if you plan on relaxing & sit back & enjoy the music & the AWESOME people watching.

Parking is on gravel & was definitely crowded but no complaints there because the ushers were so helpful! Parking our car & leaving the event was a breeze because it was definitely organized. 

Loved the food choices!  We were able to try Pineapple Park, Stripburger, Hash House, Sauced, Amore & much more. Our favorite would have to be the single slice Amore pizza that came with water since water was sold separately with other dishes & the fact that we didn't have to buy a whole Amore pizza for $20+. We also loved the Kiwi Watermelonade (?) from Hash House; so refreshing on a sunny day!

The weather was definitely perfect on this day! It did get a bit cooler at night & I was not prepared at all. Haha. For $17, I was able to see American Authors & a little of Colbie Caillat! Music was great but we were definitely more fatties & ate continuously throughout. We were unable to stay any longer cause it got too cold for me but I will be prepared next year.

Honestly, you don't need VIP treatment (overrated!). We enjoyed walking around, eating vendor foods, standing for the concerts, relaxing on the grass (many spots with shade) and people watching. I would not want to be stuck under a tent for what, $100 or something like that? Pfffft! As my Hawaiian boyfriend always says, ""No need brah! No need!"" Get in for cheap & enjoy the event.

The vendors change every year, but there's always big names there. Pretty much all of the vendors are local, which is helpful to those businesses and helpful to locals to experience something different.

The Bite of Las Vegas has been around for 19 years.  Since I am still fairly new to the area, I have only been twice.  For how affordable it is for tickets, it's hard to pass up.

For less than $20, they put together great musical lineups.  This year(2015) was Lifehouse, Third Eye Blind and Matt Nathanson just to name a few.  My first visit was 2012 with Matchbox twenty and Ed Sheeran.   There are usually about 5-6 acts which makes for a great show.  

Various restaurants have booths set up with small plate menus.  Braddah's, Culinary Dropout, Mint Indian Bistro and Shake Shack are just a few of the over 30 vendors.  It's great to try many places for usually about $5 at each place.

Food: 8/10
Music: 6/10
Family Fun: 10/10
Overall 9/10 


Affordable Food, Beer, Live Music, Activities For The Kiddos, Awesome Weather! As far as music/food festivals go (in this price range), it doesn't get any better than this. 

Reading the reviews from past years, I guess I lucked out. Parking was a breeze (and free), not hectic like most people warned. They had police officers directing traffic in & out. The weather was great even though it rained all morning and I was worried it might get rained out. Better than being too hot like some other yelpers said of past years. 

I really enjoyed my time here and so did my kids. Walking up you'll see all the obstacle courses and activities for the kids so naturally that was our first stop. My daughter did the inflatable obstacle course and my son climbed the rock wall. Later in the evening so did my daughter, she's fearless. 

On to the food. I think it was so incredible that everything is so affordable. Everything ranged from $3 - $10. $10 being the fishbowls of alcohol but they were a decent size even though I didn't order one. Needed my hands free for all the food haha. I got an entire plate of food from Fogo De Chao for only $5! Still in shock, lol. My daughter was drawn to Shake Shack like a tractor beam and we ordered a shack burger for $5 and a side of fries for $3! Again, great prices. Added bonus: playing corn-hole while we waited for our food. That was fun and a great idea. Kudos to shake shack who I might add had the longest line the entire night.  

Great variety and lots of vendors like Me Gusta Tacos, Aloha Kitchen, Ben & Jerry's, Hash House A Go-Go, Panda Express, and many many more. 

Highly recommend. Family fun and worth going to every year it comes around. Keep an eye out on Groupon for tickets, I never pay full price for anything lol. Music could've been better (lots of bands I wasn't familiar with) but even if your favorite bands weren't playing this year, there's always next year with a completely different line up.

The set up from previous years on the other side of Desert Breeze park was much better. This would be so much better if it was back in October or even March. The food choices were ok. A decent selection of food. Aloha kitchen and Gordon Biersch were good. It was almost too hot to eat. Not sure that I will come again. Not worth the hassle of parking two miles away and walking in the hot vegas heat. The artists were excellent.

2016937,2015-09-23,5,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"What a fun event! Went with two fellow Yelpers and had a great time listening to music and munching on various bites. The weather was ridiculously hot and sunny for a couple of hours, but eventually the cloud coverage rolled in and things improved overall.

MUSIC: I'm not a huge fan of any of the musicians featured, but I enjoyed what I heard. Arrived in time to hear Andy Grammer's upbeat, poppy set, got a kick out of Needtobreathe's southern-flavored rock, Lifehouse got the whole crowd singing along, Matt Nathanson was engaging and a little odd, but Third Eye Blind was what everyone waited for. They mixed old and new songs (and more of the latter than I would have preferred), but I skipped out early to avoid the clustercuss of the parking lot... and the clouds of pot smoke. I didn't come here for a second-hand high.

FOOD: The bites were mostly under $5, and there were several featured vendors from chain places putting out their specialties (Raisin' Cane, PDQ, Shake Shack, Smoothie King, Lazy Dog, CJ's Custard) to local places and various food trucks (Clever Chefs, Going Green, El Ceviche, Aloha Kitchen & Bar, Violette's vegan). The low pricing allowed our group to sample several smaller items without spending a lot of scratch. Standouts include Lazy Dog's pumpkin cheesecake (the obvious award-winner in the dessert category), the gelati fruit bowl made from a halved baby watermelon at CJ's, and the tender and savory grilled chicken skewers at Aloha. The businesses with cooler treats (ice creams, slushes, Dole Whip) seemed to get the most  business.

ORGANIZATION: I found it odd that bags weren't checked at the gates, and I wish this event allowed you to leave and reenter (I don't know how anyone stayed the entire day, the heat was brutal). That said, crowd control was effective, I saw few smokers (it was technically only allowed in ""designated areas"" despite being an outdoor event), and there were ample portapotties.

This is definitely an event I'd come back to! Check Groupon for tickets leading up to the event- at $16 presale and $25 at the door, Groupon had 'em for $13 (and you could stack on a 20% discount for a total just over $10).

Got free tix so that alone was a good reason to check it out for the first time. Found out general admission tix were $25 bucks a person. There was a VIP package for 80 bucks but didnt bother to see what that was all about. Was more interested in what foodie opportunities that were gonna be there. 

Parking was easy. So glad they didnt charge to park. Plenty of parking dudes and local police to control the flow of traffic.

Picked up our tickets at will call and had our bags searched. I was a bit concerned that the security at the entrance gate was a bit laid back, not really checking people that wore baggy clothing.

As for the lay out of the event, you have one big stage at one end and a decent open space in front of it to stand and watch. As you go further away from the stage, the landscape goes uphill a bit which is perfect for viewing, but halfway up they decided to put some trucks there I guess for the audio/visual controls? Anyways this ruins the view for those that want to sit down on the grass.

When you go up a bit, that is where all the food trucks are. Now this is where it peaks my interest. Well, except for the part where there are stands for Panda Express and Port of Subs. Really? 

Concertwise this year's line up was Zowie Bowie, Shawn Hook, Vertical Horizon, Eve 6, Leann Rimes, Rachel Platten, and Neon Trees. Now if you are remotely interested in any of these acts then the admission price was worth it.

Since it was an all ages admission, there are all sorts of mini carnival rides and activities for young kids. Not sure whether they charge for I had no reason to check it out.

Need to go to the bathroom? There are port o potties grouped together in the corners of the park. You can wash your hands with those portable hand wash thingies that you have to pump water with your foot to make the water come out the faucet.

Overall, im a fan of this event and I would not mind paying next time especially if there is a group or two that is performing that I like. All the food trucks and stands there round it out. I just wished that security could be just a bit tighter although I did notice police officers walking and bicycling around in pairs.

We ended up coming around 1pm and just started walking around and eyeing the park and everything that was around. We started out by the Race Now tables and worked our way around. After our first go around our other friends showed up and we started to get into the food. 

Food 
Pineapple park- My first stop on the bite road. I wanted the dole whip and I got it! I order the pineapple upside down cake and it was amazing, it reminded me of a shot i order when I first turned 21, not sure why I haven't ordered it since. 

Texas Twister- First drink stop, We though lemonade and you can refill, why not? And we were a little disappointed. It didn't taste sweet. It was more of a bland lemonade. Only plus was the fruit in the cup, my friends ate it all. 

Papa Johns- One of the last stops of the night. When you only have $3 left and you need something hot and homey, when papa was the way to go and it was close. Haha, super glad they handed out the garlic sauce. 

Culinary dropout- Not my first experience with Culinary drop out. They had the sames cheese and bread at the B&W party and it was still as delicious as ever. 

Panda Express and friends- When over because I saw sushi and was interested. My friends told me it was a bad idea but they were wrong. Probably my favorite meal of the day. They had spam musubi and some cream cheese wontons. They said for a dollar more I could get two egg rolls, so I told them to throw it in the bag. My friends of course stole some but that's why I got them. 

Rainforest Cafe- Our favorite place to sit and eat. We happen to grab a small table after grabbing some food we needed to st down to eat. They kept the tables clean and they were fill. 

Claim Jumper- Two of my friends went here and order some sliders and chips, as well as a salad. I of course ate all their chips and a lot of the salad. It was a Cesar salad and it was pretty good. We dipped the chips in the cheese fondue form culinary and it was bomb.com. They also had a guy yelling about double chocolate cookie that were as big as his head.. Very tempting sir. 


Vendors
After stuffing ourselves with food we started walking the tents of free things and sign ups. The first stop was State Farm, who I already have insurance for but sign up to win a $250 ft card, I was down. Also they gave out shades, awesome. Next was Toyota. They had iPad to sign  up for stuff and they you spun a wheel for prizes. They had black shades, awesome. Also they had chap stick and hats. Next was KB homes. We literally just went there to get the free cotton candy. It almost blew away when the wind started but i saved it with my mouth. We walked our way the the Metro PCS booth and threw a phone in water to get more shade, purple, awesome. Then checked out the idea image booth. Orange shades, awesome. Then went over the the hospital booth, the had heart clip magnets, sunscreen, stress ball brains, and many different colored shade including pink, awesome. I got a lot of shades now, just saying. 

Music
My real reason for going, because lets be honest a $15 is a steal. The line up included Daughtry, Colbie Caillat, O.A.R., American Authors, Lindsey Stirling and The Script. We really were just listening to the first couple bands and didn't actually sit and watch til Colbie. She was wearing shade which I though was funny but I love her song Try. During her set is when I had to get up and try and find a sweater. Her crew had shirt and some long sleeves but no hoodies or anything so we went on a mission to find something to warm me up. We failed. The military hoodies sold out and the race shop said they would get more in a hour. We ended up telling security we were grabbing a jacket and sat in the car til The Script came on. I thought they were so high energy and fun. At one point the lead singer asked for someone to call and ex boyfriend and he took the phone and sang and talked and kept calling back when he hung up. He also wanted to make a moment and ask for everyone to put down the camera and just turn on lighters or lights. I really liked that. He also came into the crowd which was really cool. 

Random
The Vegas area was really nice and chill we ended up there multiple times to sit and relax. The best part was right before The Scrip came on they were giving away Tshirts, hats, cards, and dice for your car. The lady was really cool and was trying to make it fun by throwing it over her shoulder. The red couches were comfy and right my grass so you could take your shoes off. Other random was the bathrooms, i mean porta potty. When i went in the early day i grab some TP assume they would run out. I came back later and the potties still seem pretty clean and stock. Also love that they have the sinks to wash hands.",MZ70U0pR16IiZEfxVmkyyA,11,11,5,XyiSq7wZ-WqvrGtPkdrpzQ
3088047,2015-09-13,0,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,We went last year and had a blast so we bought our tickets pretty early this year for the discount. We got there yesterday at 3 and left at 430. Why? Because it was too freaking hot for anything. Even sitting in the shade. I kept drinking water and misting myself and that didn't even help. Last year it was later in September so it wasn't nearly as hot but this year it was MISERY. It wasn't fun. The few booths we did get to no one was really trying to pull you in because I bet they were hot too! And there weren't nearly as many free swag and contest things. I was so disappointed and we'll definitely pay attention to the calendar and line up (really? No Hilary Duff last minute so you add an American Idol nobody??) next year before we buy tickets.,fbbXmHoCfd6wXMHnkjgDTg,0,0,1,bzd6ElQacYugs-fzAm2bSw

The ""bite"" started at 11 am but we decided to go at 3 pm to avoid being in the sun too long. There was parking in a dirt lot across the street and it was free. All the food ranged in price from $1-$5. 
We checked out the food booths and tried the following:

""Texas De Brazil"" was something we have already eaten at the restaurant but couldn't resist a bite of what they had. For $5 we got a sampler that  included a piece of Bacon Wrapped Chicken, Sausage, Garlic Steak and a Roll. This was worth every penny! So flavorful and the people working the booth were very friendly.

""Martorano's"" is a restaurant inside ""The Rio"" and it is on the upscale side so this was the perfect place to try something like this and not have to wear a skirt or pay menu price! We split a ""Philly Cheesesteak"" that had caramelized onions, american cheese and was on a crusty roll. They were charging just $5 for the same size sandwich they would charge $16 for at the restaurant. It was very cheesy and tasty. I would defiantly eat it again but not for $16.

""La Salsa"" had the best deal of the day. They were offering Steak or Chicken Tacos for only $2. We got a Margarita for $5 and 2 Steak Tacos. They were generous with the meat and cheese and it was very good.

""Molly Malone's Pub"" (who was there is also apart of ""Kavanaugh's"", ""Sean Patrick's"", ""Morrissey's"", and ""Mad Matty's Bar & Grill"") had a booze only line and then a food and drink line. We just got a Coke that was $2 and ""Pretzel Sticks"" that were $1.50 on the menu but he only charged us $1. They were 2 BIG Pretzel Sticks and it came with a homemade cheese sauce for dipping. It was very tasty and I would like to eat at one of their Pubs to try other food.

Everyone was friendly there was plenty of security and police on hand keeping an eye on things. They always have someone emptying the trashes and keeping it clean.
The only complaint I have is that there aren't any chairs unless you pay for a VIP section. It is hot during the day and standing for several hours is tough! 
The concert stage is nice and we were pleased with how close we were. Matchbox Twenty rocked the park!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,8,5,4,tCLFS5P0XC7EPUazvCYNZQ

The last time I was here it was food truck after truck. This time there was only one food truck which was Sauced and I did enjoy them. 

I had Braddah's and Skinny Fats as well as Drinks from Big Dog Brewery. We purchased the VIP tickets which gave us access to free food, beer, a covered tent and seating area as well as separate Port-a-pottys. We arrived around 11:30 and stayed until 5ish.

This is my fourth consecutive year attending Bite of Las Vegas and unless my eyes are playing tricks on me, there were noticeably fewer food booths this year.  I had some Hash House and H & H Barbeque.  Both were great.  On the way out of the festival, I grabbed an LBS burger (yes, I grubbed hard).  Never eaten at the actual restaurant, but I was not impressed.  To me, there's just something so wrong about ketchup on a burger.

As far as the bands were concerned, I didn't make it to the headliner because I had to cut out early, but overall, the concert lineup was not as good as it has been in the past.  I will definitely be back next year, but I would like 94.1 to get some better acts. Ryan Starr? Seriously?  On a positive note, this festival remains one of the best values.

4108294,2015-09-13,6,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"I tried more of the food this year (scroll halfway down for more info), but I still mainly went for the music. Bite of Las Vegas delivered on both counts.

The weather was ridiculous to start the day, but unlike last year, they managed to keep the bands going pretty much on schedule. I skipped Nick Fradiani and the two local acts, whoever they may have been, but I arrived just in the nick of time for Andy Grammer's start time at 3:10pm. Some of you may be familiar with his popular singles from radio stations such as MIX 94.1. Anyway, he and his band were energetic, and he played a lot of songs that were easy to enjoy in his ~30-minute set, including his current catchy tune ""Honey, I'm Good."" I also loved his incorporation of loop pedals on one of his tracks, as well as the talk box on his cover of the current Jack U single.

A quick reflection on how easy it was to redeem the Groupon (which I got for $10.40 after stacking discounts vs. $16 early pre-purchase). The signs were clear on where to go as long as you read them, and they just waved you through once they scanned your barcode. Interestingly, they didn't bother to check my stuff, so that sealed gallon of bottled water could easily have been an open gallon of vodka, or something even better. Maybe next year...

Most of the music was great after that point. Needtobreathe brought a Southern rock sound that I just wasn't feeling, other than their current single ""Shelter."" Lifehouse killed it though, with energetic playing and spot-on vocals for their first live performance in three months. They played most of their hits, to the delight of fans. Matt Nathanson was also awesome with a cover-filled set and charismatic audience engagement. Finally, Third Eye Blind rocked the headliner spot with old hits and new songs - perhaps a few too many of the latter for some listeners, judging from how I was able to inch closer to the stage every few minutes.

I was actually quite surprised after last year at how I was able to get relatively close to the stage with minimal effort if I wanted to. I'm not sure if it was just the broader appeal of last year's acts that led to a massive turnout, the scorching temperatures of this year (what a relief when cloud cover arrived at around 4:45), or if people had other things to do today, but it felt that attendance was down - which is a good thing for the people who did end up showing, including yours truly.

I know a lot of you wanna hear about the food, and I finally did get into it. Several chains were present, but I focused on interesting bites from local restaurants, all of which happened to cost $5. Props to everyone for keeping most of the items affordable and allowing for a lot of sampling - I see the point of this event now, despite the lack of high-end restaurants.

My first order was a small steak plate from Via Brasil, which was cooked to medium but was tender enough for a plastic knife to do its job. It was seasoned and wasn't too bad aside from the lack of a starch.

I also had a sample of Aloha Kitchen's chicken. They were really pushing samples, and the chicken with its extreme tenderness and light sweetness could definitely have been a pick if I'd had fewer other options.

Next dish was a ceviche from El Ceviche, a shop that is aiming to open on S. Eastern Avenue in about two weeks. It was actually a nice portion with good chunks of fish, Peruvian corn that wasn't too mushy, red onion, a thick potato slice, and lettuce. I liked it and enjoyed their complementary (yes, the one with an ""e"") passion fruit juice for $3, which came in a pretty large cup and provided the sweetness to counter the acidity of the ceviche. I think they'll be worth a visit once they've launched their business.

I made a final round at around 7pm, at which time the lines had predictably grown. I had found an interesting chicken tikka masala with rice and naan at Mint Indian Bistro's tent, and their line was quite short either due to being overlooked or because they were able to plate quickly. The rice may have been a little bland and dry, but the chicken was excellent and the naan wasn't too bad. I'm interested now in trying their actual restaurant, which probably means that they've succeeded.

My final bite was the pumpkin cheesecake ($4) from Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar, which I realize now is a chain, and yet I really couldn't care less. They had won best dessert of Bite of Las Vegas 2015 earlier, and I can't really argue with the judges on this decision. It was rich and had nice pumpkin flavor, and I had to restrain myself from eating it so that I could share a taste with my friends.

Overall, it was a very fun day for at least four of the five senses (not entirely sure about touch). There is good food to be found, and while the music lineup was a step down from last year, the big-name artists generally delivered. Go to Bite of Las Vegas when you can, and hopefully obtain a cheap ticket.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,7,5,fI4YeYUs6LsxaPiOanDc1Q
4260593,2010-09-14,0,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"My sister and I went to the original venue held at the Fashion Show Mall parking lot, years ago- just wanted to show you how long I've known about it. We've gone a few times in the larger location- it's gotten huge (ie. packed crowd, so just a warning). The entrance fee has gone up, but you can get a four pack on www.lasvegashalfoff.com for $18. No outside food or coolers allowed. 

Where else can you sample food from so many different restaurants at one time? It's like a super food court outside (but way better! most food courts don't impress me anymore, except Hawaii's Ala Moana) with live music (MIx 94.1 FM artists) and events scheduled- except the prices range from $1-$5 for smaller portions. One year, I got a humongous slice of Key Lime Pie for $1.00. The weather is just right at this time of year. The park, located on the west side, is such a nice one, that you can enjoy the grounds. It's a nice family thing to do. And the food choices are amazing. Make your rounds before deciding on what you really want or you'll be sorry.

We used to go to the San Gennaro Italian Festival but it's gotten pretty pricey for food and admission, that the whole thing cost us about $50 and this was a five years ago. This one's much better.

 My favorite of course @hashhousegogolv and the pork tenderloin sandwich. But thats just me being an Iowa boy.

Not only does this event have top notch music for CHEAP-Admission is ONLY $8 per person.

They always have 4-5 headlining bands like this year : @parachute @blueoctoberband @Uncle_Kracker @train plus another 1/2 dozen or so bands playing on both stages. Personally I really enojyed Imaginary Dragons!. @train did cancel because someone in the band was ill. 1st ever canceled show by the band. The show did go on....

There's was also a small midway with rides and games for the kids including a rock climbing wall and carnival food stands like kettle corn,corn dogs,funnel cake and more.

The main walk featured about 50 restaurant boothes serving food and drinks with GREAT PRICES-everything iwas UNDER $5!!! Did I mention admission was only $8!

Several booths like @PortofSubsLV offer even CHEAPER deals like $2 sandwiches & drinks.

CanyonRanch had kabobs 2/$3 and @hashhouseagogolv had sandwiches for ONLY $4.

The only knock on the event is parking but what can you really do with this many people wanting to park close enough not to have to be bussed in.

4424991,2014-09-29,4,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"Bite of Las Vegas this year has redeemed Las Vegas food festivals for me. We were blessed with AMAZING weather all day that cooled off in the evening...sooo unlike typical Las Vegas weather. The crew was very well organized and helpful as they really had their stuff together. The parking was relatively painless and traffic entering/leaving moved along without a hitch. Most of the food vendors are local restaurants like Hash House a GoGo, Culinary Dropout, Rainforest Cafe, The Great American Pub etc., but the great part is that they are not food trucks that are slow to deliver, these vendors were very well prepared to handle the crowd and keep the line to a minimum.... something that food truck festivals fail miserable at.

Let's start with the ticket prices, which we bought prior to the event for under $20. That gave us the viewing pleasure of 8 artists on stage and access to about 40 food vendors that were priced about $5 per item. What a great deal!

Food:
Now having experienced some other ""food fest"", I was a bit soured and didn't expect much from the BLV vendors. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised, not overwhelmed though, but pleasantly surprised by the food selection and value. We started with Texas de Brazil that offered 3 choices of meats with a roll for $5...garlic sirloin which was melt-in-your-mouth good, sausage was very tasty, the bacon wrapped chicken was actually not bad at all. The roll was a bit dry but a nice addition. All the food was about $5 and portions were decent for a food festival. The Culinary Dropout offered Pretzel bites with cheese fondue with a ""happy hour 2 for 1 special""...2 orders of pretzel bites or 1 order with a salmon bruschetta. The pretzel bites were fun and tasty to eat. My daughter tried the salmon bruschetta and liked it. We also had the Hawaiian shaved iced that was perfect to enjoy under the mild Vegas sun. 3 flavors for $5. They had it down to a system where you got your ice pretty quick with generous amount of syrup. Hash House A GoGo is one I would never go eat at again because I think their food is terrible, but they did know how to make a refreshing 3 color Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade that had everyone gawking. H & H BBQ had rib tip fries that were off the hook delicious. Generous amounts of tender BBQ rib tips atop natural cut fries...I would have loved seconds on this. The Great American Pub had lobster mac & cheese and crab fries. I don't usually like anyone else's mac & cheese other than my own but GAP had a pretty good version that we all enjoyed. Creamy cheese sauce, not overly cheesy with bright hints of green onion and crispy bread crumb topping...and it had actual pieces of lobster. I think I would go to GAP to get this again. The crab fries were ok. I don't know where they came up with crab since the white sauce didn't have any crab in it, but still a nice outdoor fest treat.

The entertainment was awesome. There were some moments when the bass was a bit too much and caused some of us to loose a filling, but the lineup was great. Lindsey Stirling was our favorite and she delivered a great show. I don't know how one dances around like her and maintains playing the violin. She's one talented gal. OAR was good too. My brother is a Daughtry fan but he wasn't on until 7:30 and the weather was getting cold so we packed up. He said he has the album on iTunes :)

All in all, this was a great event that we will look forward to again next year. Just some tips that made our experience that much better was that we came prepared with comfortable cushy folding seats ($19 at Walmart), a large frozen Smart Water bottle for each of us was plenty of hydration to last the day, a collapsible picnic shade tent (at Sears) was perfect to cool off in and the envy of everyone that walked by us. They don't allow outside coolers, but in the event you have special medication for your kids that need refrigeration, they do allow a lunchbox sized cooler to carry it in. I hope next year's weather will be as beautiful as it was that day, but also bring a light hoodie in case it gets cool.

I'd never been to Bite of Las Vegas, and seeing as I am very shortly leaving the city I figured I would check it out. After all, this was the 19th annual, so I figured it would be a pretty down-pact event. 

To begin with - there is no official website, which I find odd for an event that is going on two decades of being around. The website on 94.1 doesn't even show up with the 2015 dates when you search on Google. Someone really needs to help them out with their SEO.

Moving forward, the lines to get in were convoluted and made no sense. It was stinkin' hot. They should consider pushing the event to late in September.

The amount of food vendors was decent, but the quality was lacking. Panda Express? Port of Subs? Really? Smaller local places were lacking. There were a few larger local-ish places there, but not enough to keep me there for very long. 

Pros - the food was capped at $5 which is nice. It's easy to budget for this event. Do you want to eat three things? Bring $15. Plus there were places that had food for lower than $5. This event won't break your bank. A lot of the places were also taking Credit/Debit, so thank goodness we are past those times now that you absolutely have to bring cash to these types of events.

I did not stay for any of the bands. I was sweating bullets and there was only one tent with sparse picnic tables to sit under. For an event that started at 11 AM and went until 9 PM I am really surprised at the lack of shade.80% of the event would have been when the sun is out -- more shade is needed.

Overall, I would not return to this event.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,7,4,2,IpTwg_buhqHKfHDP_GGI4w

The food options were plentiful. Drinks were a bit limited though. I did enjoy visiting the different vendor booths and my friend did the ice bucket challenge. Who wouldn't?! It was 102 degrees outside. Definitely stay hydrated and maybe come when the sun goes down.

The reason I got the VIP parking was so I could park close and if I wanted come and go, I didn't have to fight to find parking. I found out after I bought the ticket that there was no reentry allowed. An 11 hour event that people are held captive at?? And can't even go to their cars to grab anything. Ever heard of a distinctive stamp?
Next I agree with Gina about the signage. Or have a map at the entrance so people can figure out where they are going.
I found my way to the VIP tent, where due to lack of signage, I didn't know I had to go to the first table to get my wristband so I proceeded to find an area for my friends and I to sit. I then proceeded to the food line. When I got to the first volunteer at the food table after standing in line for about 10 minutes she told me about having to go to the wristband table before I get food. I did and waited another 10 minutes in line to get food. The food consisted of rolled meat for sliders, crab cake and chicken wings. We were told that we could only have 1 of each. Then there was salad and chips and salsa (no salsa was available). I later found out that the House of Blues provided the food for the VIP tent. It was horrible food and cold.  As VIPs we received 3 food tickets. I went back a few hours later and they had Jambalaya and chicken wings. Nasty and cold. I was lucky I got food. My friends went about 30 minutes after I did and there was no food left. At 6:30!! For an event that lasted until 10. Poor planning House of Blues. My friend complained to one of the people in charge of the tent and we got sent over to the volunteers tent to eat. Omg what a difference in quality. The food there was hot and tasty.
The placement of the VIP section was good; right next to the stage. We had our own porta potties. Too bad they weren't serviced enough. Ran out of toilet paper and paper towels throughout the day. Also there should have been better signage for men and women. Guys were using the women's and vice versa. 
The bands were great! Although speakers in the food area would have allowed for everyone to hear them. Although jumbo screens on either side of the stage would have allowed people to see them.

So all in all, I was disappointed. I overpaid for the event. Next year, if I decide to go, I will pay the cheap price and buy at the vendors since the VIP was not worth the price.  I hope the organizers take all these suggestions and improve for next years event.",zoQ7PP4MlKL_XLZKuIp2Zg,4,1,2,JUTGvedLc5L9bIWoc2LIKw

This event was ALOT of fun! they have a good system set up for entry which prevents long waits. The variety of food options is amazing and for a small price you get to try all sorts of food. Sauced came out on a list of favorites that I tried.

Not to mention a amazing line up of artists performing.

So many local companies show up and give out fun little goodie bags. Over all this was tons of fun and I can't wait till next year!",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,3,6,5,tvz5zc7oSIgfeJPtvOTrVQ
5171596,2017-09-09,0,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,Park #3 today.  We are here for the 3rd year in a row for the Mix 94.1 Bite of Vegas.  This park is great.  It's huge and has plenty of room for everything including these music events.  They have all kinds of food venues here too.  Great day for this.,keBv05MsMFBd0Hu98vXThQ,0,2,5,bcze2xM_ZF-Y3gTuqw9EDA
5232710,2011-02-09,2,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"I'll be the first to admit - I'm a high maintenance lady! I hate lines, crowds, and in general I'm not big on festivals. After having a mental breakdown at both Lollapalooza and Taste of Chicago, I had basically decided I was too old for festivals and needed to give up trying. 

This my friends is a festival even this high maintenance lady can handle. The parking isn't all that bad if you arrive early-ish in the day (like in the first 3-4 hours!), and from parking to festival entrance we're talking 10 mintues. Not a big deal. I do think it sucks to pay admission AND pay for all the food, but I know they are raising money for charity so whatever. 

The food here is usually pretty good. It's not gourmet, but it does the trick. My main issue is most of the food is sizeable portions for like $5. Ok, it's called BITE of Las Vegas, I'd like to try lots of mini portions for $1-$3. Some places get the concept, but most didn't. At Taste of Chicago, for instance, each booth has to do a mini portion for like $1 or $2. I wish they'd kind of mandate that each place did one ""BITE"" portion for a small price, then sell freaking meal sized portions for those that want it. My husband and I usually split 3-4 $5 items before passing out into a food coma - I usually end up wishing my stomach and wallet had room to try more of the appealing items offered, but they are too damn big. 

My other minor complaint is I wish there were more seating. It gets fairly crowded under the few tents they have with chairs. I guess I could plan ahead and pack a blanket or something? I'm never that clever though. 

Overall it's fairly inexpensive, it's low key, and it has food - my kind of event. I've been 3 years in a row now and had a good time every year.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,5,3,4,Wjl41QQaSv0QWsq6BNlgQQ

I'm a huge fan of Lindsey Stirling and I didn't stay to listen to anyone else. I'll be coming back next year!",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,3,5,4,n80aD9_Q6mfc0qAwgH3waA
5319929,2013-09-29,3,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"I've been coming to Bite of Las Vegas every single year since I moved here. Lots of food plus music, heck yeah! Great combo in my book. They do it when it's no longer unbearably hot in Vegas.

You get a map before you enter. The admission fee isn't bad. They did bump the price to $25 this year but still. Different bands/singers in one place...that's a steal! They had Train, Sarah Bareilles, Counting Crows, etc in previous years. This year was One Republic, Matt Nathanson, Better Than Ezra, Goo Goo Dolls and others. I was stoked to watch BTE and GGD! Hello 90's!

Restaurants/ businesses that participated this year include Texas de Brazil, Edible Arrangements, Via Brazil, Funnel Cake Cafe, H&H BBQ, Braddah's, Skinnyfats, McCormick and Schmick's (our first stop this year. Hi Sarah Marie! ^_^), La Belle Terre, Stripburger, Voodoo, Nothing Bundt Cake and many others. I'm surprised Whole Foods and Serendipity weren't here this year. You can get food for $2 and some combos for about $5...and they're small enough portions where you can hop from one place to another to try other goodies.

As usual, we got free food, alcohol and other stuff. Parking is quite complicated but did I say free stuff? Also, don't plan on using the bathroom when you come here.

The highlight of the evening for me was ""Iris"" by Goo Goo Dolls. Oh my, Johnny Rzeznik still looks the same! Mix 94.1, Mark and Mercedes...awesome event! 'Til next year...",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,6,5,_ICsUYKCTWF2jUWGer5wSg
5693008,2013-09-29,0,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"My wife and I had wanted to go to this for years.  We opted for the VIP tickets with the free drinks to include Budweiser products and water as well as 3 plates of free food.  We also had our own VIP covered area and 4 porta pottys.  

We arrived at approximately 1230pm.  I was worried about parking, but it was well organized and easy to park.  

The band lineup was great.  Plain White T's, One Republic, Better Than Ezra, Matt Nathanson and of course the Goo Goo Dolls.  We especially loved The Plain White T's, Matt Nathanson and the Goo Goo Dolls!  The Goo Goo Dolls were incredible!  Great opportunity to see so many great bands for the money!  The sound was also very good for an outdoor venue.  

The weather was great as well.  Maybe a high of 85 and a slight breeze!  We did the Fremont St. free concert to see HInder in July and it was simply too damned hot to enjoy.  102 degrees at 930pm!!!

The food for the VIP was provided by Top Dog Catering.  The food, especially, the kabobs, were incredible.   The only negative was the amount provided.  We were each given a wristband that included three numbered tabs to get food.  The food was pretty sparse by 8pm.  Most of the trays were empty and people were waiting 15 or minutes in line for more food to be brought up from the grilling area.  

Overall, an incredible value for the money.  We will definitely be back next year.

A couple suggestions for next years VIP section.  The chairs provided in the front of the tent were nice.  The little tables inside were nice as well.  However, a LOT of people in VIP did not get a chair or table and had to sit on the floor.  Maybe provide a chair for every VIP ticket you sell, or simply not sell so many VIP tickets?",R9bmy99DDOGvh1j0OPoUcA,1,0,4,M9-LsbzoNrdvZxHxKNYmLw
5910945,2014-09-29,0,QkSf6Dgn4hYWNfaT6_kd5A,"OMG, I had such a nice time at this event on Saturday :)

I unfortunately had to work during the day, but was able to make it for Colbie Caillat, Daughtry, and THE SCRIPT (omg, talk about an amazing band to watch live!! so interactive and they sound amazeballs!!)!!!! 

The line up was great, and all the food vendor options was awesome. I had a yummy burger and garlic fries from StripBurger which only cost me $5.  A great family friendly and music-lover friendly activity. Great crowd, and great music :) 

What more can you ask for? ... Maybe some free blankets cuz it was cold yesterday...and re-entry next year?!?!?!? 

Cover to get in was $25 at the door, which would have been even MORE worth it if I could have attended the whole day, but alas....work  -____-;",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,4,3,4,JZa4eb1nhZSHoan1rtJp0Q
