No big deal, so we went to the bar. My friend waited literally 10 minutes at the bar (we know this because our other friend was on the phone while it happened and she saw the call timer) waiting for one of the 2 or 3 bartenders to hand us a menu. Before handing us menus, she demanded to see our ID's. We brought them back right away (we had a table like 3 feet from the bar), and then we had to wait even longer for her to check them. After looking through the menu (and getting such horrible service before we even ordered anything), we decided to go back to our room and drink in there instead.",iQgm7ZCSuyWklP8fsUDfcA,3,0,1,bylBAarD3DRZvfrjpnWFPA
18431,2015-08-28,0,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"I just scrolled through previous reviews and read not so good reviews. I had the total opposite experience here.

I got married on August 22, 2015 and decided to have our rehearsal dinner the day prior on August 21, 2015. We had been searching and ""tasting"" different restaurants on the strip being that many of wedding party were coming from out of state and we wanted to keep the dinner near their hotels. Our wedding reception was pretty formal, so after many taste testing ventures, we decided we wanted to hold our rehearsal dinner at a venue where everyone could mingle with eachother in a fun comfortable atmosphere.

I remembered that we had taken my son to Senor Frogs for his 21st birthday. I contacted them by email inquiring about special events and I was immediately contacted by Denny. I requested to come into the restaurant after 5:00 PM to view the area of where we could hold our rehearsal dinner and he stated he would make himself available at any time. My husband and I visited that same night and knew the restaurant would be a perfect place for the atmosphere we were wanting! 

We held our rehearsal dinner for 30 people on August 21, 2015 and everything was set up as planned with food, tables, chairs, and was even accommodated when I had to add 6 extra people with the very little notice.  We chose to have dinner buffet style non-stop for 2 hours. Denny continuously checked on us to make sure everything was ok and our waitress Veronica (I think that as her name) was very patient with our large group! Thanks a bunch to these 2! :) 

The only complaint I have is the heat! lol We sat outside facing the strip, which was a beautiful view but hot, and although they provided misters and fans, we were sweating! August is a very hot month in Vegas, so I had I been a little bit smarter, I would've requested to be seated inside! I'm a local, so I should've known better! lol 

Overall, we all had a great time! :)",vBzS9zWS9Iz8sTOveyytIA,0,0,4,SP5W28TVJjIsPzaKQk4xZA

389002,2013-03-09,0,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"I was very disappointed with Senor Frog's.  

My husband and I wanted to have a nice evening and chose to go out to the strip. (We are locals)  and I have a few complaints.

1. Very loud.  I couldn't even talk to my husband who was sitting next to me.  We had to ask our server multiple times to repeat herself.

2.  The free shots.  I don't drink alcohol for personal beliefs and a spotlight was put on me despite the fact that I did not have a napkin flying above my head.  The guy came over and I had to cover my mouth and say no.  He did not want to take no for an answer.  I had to repeat myself 3 times before he left me alone.

3. I did not receive a balloon hat.  I may not drink, but I understand silliness.  I work with children. . .

4.  No Id's were checked.  Their were children in the dining area and alcohol freely being given.  I noticed an older woman looked very angry that the free alcohol guy was trying to give a shot to a younger girl at the table.  

5.  Food was not great.  I got pasta and it seemed more like soup.  Way too much sauce for anyone.

Afterwards, my husband and I agreed that we would not go there again.  We have had wonderful  experiences at other bars and restaurants and we will not go back to Senor Frog's.",eRSWoSVjMddwUKSfUFY__g,1,0,1,6ttzWVZeRxUURa3jTzN_7w

We had a group of ten plus people for two years and a row.  We ate dinner, it was mediocre at best.  Chicken tacos where dry and no flavor, basically just cooked chicken with cheese on top.  Enchiladas were ok, I could do a better job cooking at home, kind of sad for Vegas.  Last night oct 31, 2014, partied all night there after dinner.  Spent $60+ on dinner, plus $35 for all you can drink for myself and $55 for my wife's top shelf all you can drink.  Pretty reasonable drinking price for Vegas, but by 2 am tried to order tap water, in my all you can drink cup, and the bartender said $4 for a bottled water.  I said no tap water for free in my cup, he said no again trying to get me to buy a bottled water.  As we argued back and forth I finally gave up.  My wife went to the manager and complained how much money we spent for all you can drink and dinner, and that we should at least get our free water.  Crazy!  Then during the costume contest confetti was sprayed throughout the crowd, of course what do you do with confetti other than throw it.  Everyone was doing it, but the manager came over and grabbed my hand said not to throw the confetti.  He then grabbed my wife's hand too, I told him to let her go.  I can't believe he had the nerve to put his hand on her.  I was so pissed.  Unbelievable this guy is a manager.

Order chips and salsa, argh. Brown bag chips and canned salsa for $5. Totally low quality.

Order apps, bogo deal 2:1 at 50%. Nachos were ok, quesadilla was a brick of cheese inside a tortilla.

Bill comes full charge on everything, including $40 drinks, not the 10oz, waitress totally lied.  

Most offensive part, we ordered some top shelf drinks, they totally pulled a fast one with the booze, and put bottom shelf in it. Thought such an establishment wouldn't pull that old trick. Sorry, not some dumb college kid that can't tell the difference. Watery too.

Yeah, terrible service, full price on everything during happy hour, waitress straight out lied, hostess was high as a kite, bar served us bottom shelf yet paid for top, and unbelievably expensive even for Strip prices.

Big mistake the idiot they sent me should probably picked a career working with animals not people.  He tried to be apologetic by telling me he didn't sell me the groupon so I had to understand that my 75.00 bill that should have been 25.00 with my voucher was.... Um we'll too bad!  Lol. I would have got mad but was so shocked at the lack of care for a customer I just paid the bill without tipping and thought I got the best education today. I can use this experience while training my customer service staff in the future.  I will call this training ""what not to do"" when dealing with people.

Also, my friends chicken salad looks amazing when it came out... Well looks can be deceiving. There was zero taste, seriously, the sour cream was the only thing that made it edible.

so we show up at 10ish (no cover charge) and went straight to the dance area, it wasn't full so we were able to get a good table. my friend and i went up to the bar and ordered a bucket of beer and 2 shots total was $30 some bucks, not bad at all compared to other places on the strip plus the bartender was a total hottie, i forgot her name but she was really nice too so i tipped her $10 on the first round. we get back to our table and let me just say the music was sooooooooooo good. i'm not a big techo/house/top 40 fan and that's usually all you get at the clubs so it was super refreshing to hear some reggaeton/bachata/salsa :D right then, i knew it was going to be a good night!

the place filled up pretty quickly, by midnight it was packed, the dj was awesome the whole night, the bartender stayed amazing, and there was this other girl walking around with 3 dollar shots (gummy bear/adios) gummies weren't that strong, i'd def go for the adios ones. and then the classic photographer came around. we bought our pictures for $18+ tax (again, not bad at all)

long story short, i had a BLAST. all you ""it's too expensive"" critics need to take your broke butts home. you're in Vegas! i think prices are perfectly fine especially for all the fun you're having!

690925,2013-03-08,0,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"Summary:  The wait staff does a very poor job or paying attention to the diners.  They are also very unprofessional and childish.  The food is pricey and bland, but they do give you a decent portion.  There is nothing at Señor Frogs that had a positive impact on me.  It's unprofessional and poorly ran.

I've never been to a Señor Frogs before so maybe they're all not like this one.  After being seated, no attention was brought to us by the wait staff for a little under five minutes.  The place was half full, but our waiter, Robert, was at a table next to us entertaining three moderately attractive girls.  We gave our drink and lunch order at the same time and the food came out pretty quickly.  The Philly Cheese Steak was bland and was served with gravy.  Not sure why they felt the need to give me gravy though...

Throughout our meal we were distracted several times.  A whistle sounded behind me and our waiter Robert was standing with one leg on the table next to us and one on a chair.  He was standing above a (what I assume was) a teenage kid holding a bottle of some mixed alcoholic drink.  The boys mother asked if it contained alcohol, confirming my assumption, and Robert said it did.  Regardless, he started tweeting his whistle and another waitress chanted ""Chug, chug, chug,..."" while pouring the drink down the boys throat.

Not long after, Robert was back at the table next to us desperately trying to hit on the moderately attractive girls.  He eventually put one of the ladies' face into his chest and had her motorboat him.  The two elderly couples at the next table were none too pleased.

Basically, Señor Frogs was very unprofessional and had pricey, bland food.  Additionally, they never brought my table the sugar for the ice tea we ordered.  I will not be returning.",w727ylVwBZq6Ytpjvn2DpQ,1,1,2,4nKMmDyLfoAGOL-8G4FhUA

Anyway, they gave us wristbands for the evening. Was something like 15 bucks for me, 10 for him. Was ladies drink free all night and we were told I can share the drinks with my bf, so effectively, we will be getting free drink all night. As this seemed too good a deal, we kept confirming with them what they were offering and they were like 'yep, that's right'. This was at 6pm- the club part the offer was for didnt open till 10 sowehung around waiting. We got into line and as we paid, I was given a cup. I said ' does my bf not get one?' To which they replied 'ladies drink free only' I explained what I had been told and by whom and was told 'if we are caught sharing drinks, we would be asked to leave' we left of our own accord- after paying 25 bucks - 10 of which for just admission for my bf into a crappy bar. We found the promotions guys straight away and explained it to them what happened- to which the guy told us he hadn't said that- even though 100%fact he did. And was obvious he was lying as he was stammering and stuttering all over the place and didnt look his friendly self like he I'd a few hours prior- but worried and nervous. Waste of money, ESP as we were out on a budget. Wasted 25 dollars. Yeah, we coulda stayed, but wasn't in the mood after getting lied to and paying for drinks when we were 100% told they were included.DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!

My review is based on atmosphere and music, I cannot speak for the food which I see a lot of poor reviews on.  For a Sunday Night, the DJ kept an upbeat crowd, despite the fact that it was a tad bit dead at first.  Within a few minutes, people were up and dancing around.  When he made us do the Wobble dance, it was almost shoulder to shoulder, but everyone was having a blast. 

The drinks were strong, and the 2 for 1 margarita call topped it off.  We wish we came here instead of Pure of Friday.

We went on a Wednesday night, which is notoriously slow here in Vegas.  Even though they weren't crowded, we still had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.  We did end up being seated outside, which was nice. However, they were doing karaoke and during the karaoke sets the speakers were almost too loud. 
Onto the service, it was just poor.  We waited another 20 minutes before anyone came over, and even then we had to ask for a server.  Our server walked by numerous times prior to us asking and not once did he greet us, or acknowledge us in any way.  
Onto to food, I ordered the fajitas and the BF ordered a burrito.  Again, took a long time for the food to come out.  The food was just so-so.  I got the combination fajitas but I wish I just got the chicken, the beef was chewy and fatty.  The fajitas did have good flavor though.  The rice and beans tasted like something you'd get with a TV dinner.  His burrito was OK, but the chips that came with it were stale.

It was an excellent Mexican restaurant with a variety of tasty, well prepared Mexican dishes.  So, when we saw Senor Frog's smiling frog face at Treasure Island we were excited to relive the experience.  DIDN'T HAPPEN!!!  This Senor Frog's is basically an over sized bar, serving bar food quality dishes and the noise level is so high that it is difficult to have a conversation over dinner.  It isn't even a Mexican restaurant anymore.  Although, they do offer tacos, enchiladas and burritos and a variety of other things including spaghetti, hamburgers and BBQ.  The chips and salsa, which aren't complimentary, are not worth the 5 dollar price tag.  Seriously, we've had better salsa out of a jar.  Can anyone spell PACE?  We had the cheap margarita.  If, you can call 11 dollars cheap (top shelf was 13 dollars).  It was served in a small plastic mug and didn't even come with a lime wedge.  And, to make matters worse, they weren't very good.  If you want a really good margarita, go across the Strip to Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville at the Flamingo.  Jimmy knows how to make a margarita.  If you want really good Mexican food and margaritas, then, go to Lindo Michoacan.  There are several locations in Las Vegas; but, none are on the Strip.  So, you have to drive.  But, the drive is worth it.  

We had lousy chips and salsa, 2 lousy margaritas,  an over priced order of 3 fish tacos and an over priced chicken quesadilla for $62 including tip.

Placed seemed nice enough so we went in, no wait!

Taste was fine but $9 gets you a maybe 20 oz mug packed hard with ice. Drink was maybe 10 oz.
Ordered food and another drink, app Guacamole for the bag of chips we got. Guacamole was poor and obviously from a can. Had fajitas chicken and steak, they didn't suck but smaller than expected. In a nutshell the food didn't suck but was a little overpriced. Drinks good but overpriced. I would expect more. Here's my real problem and the 1 star rating.
In an effort to make ""fun"" they have a DJ who plays loud music or portions of music making it impossible to talk during dinner. Worse yet they want to involve the servers 'in his little games.

The show is really funny and a perfect way to start your weekend off. Shangela is really funny and despite being a self proclaimed ""professional"" she lived up to it. The queens at today's show were on fleek and very friendly.

We were attracted by the rowdy party atmosphere--it was Friday night--and the fact that all of the customers seemed to be wearing balloon hats. We were in Vegas for my girlfriend's birthday and a loud, rowdy, balloon-hat-wearing bar experience was exactly what she was looking for.

The atmosphere was definitely silly with signs all over the walls and ceiling painted in dayglo colors and cute freestanding signs that looked like fingers pointing placed around everywhere. I dragged one over to our table that said ""high maintenance"" and placed it behind my girl's head and it took her 10 minutes to catch on. So funny! Definitely no shortage of interesting décor.

Our server was awesome! Didn't catch his name. He was adorable, charming, funny, and attentive even though they were pretty packed. We'd already eaten dinner and just wanted drinks (diet coke for me, as I was the designated driver). As far as the food reviews go, it sounds like we probably didn't miss much. He kept the drinks coming and made some good recommendations for my GF. Even better, they have all these little games and activities. They really get everyone involved with the promise of free shots. They had us standing on our chairs, acting out hand motions to go with a song they taught us. Then they got everyone wanting a free shot to form a conga line around the restaurant and had a server pouring shots down people's throats, two or three different times around the restaurant.They had a few different contests where they made volunteers stand on stage and see who could chug a free beverage the fastest, and they made one girl sing karaoke for a free drink. Several servers, including ours, got on stage and danced around. It was hilarious! Our server was the best dancer out all of them! The MC was very funny and entertaining, he did a great job controlling the action, keeping the games going, and generally making sure everyone enjoyed the evening,

There was a cute young gal going around making balloon animal hats for everyone for free. She made some fairly elaborate balloon hats for my group, then took a couple pictures of us wearing them, then took a picture of herself! She was too funny! She got a good tip from our table.

Everyone in there was having a good time. There were at least two other groups there celebrating a birthday. My girlfriend and her cousin and cousin's husband all had a blast. EXACTLY the zany, silly, alcohol induced shenanigans we signed on for when we booked the trip. We were all talking about Senor Frogs for the rest of the weekend.

We went here to celebrate Cinco de Mayo and it was just a bad experience all around. I wish we would have saved our money and gone elsewhere but in the name of being festive, we went anyways. I've been to Senor Frogs in Cancun when I was in college and it was a little too tacky and rambunctious for me then and much hasn't changed since then. 

We sat out on the patio hoping to enjoy some food and drinks and we did but everything took forever and their prices for what they're serving are completely asinine. I got a chicken burrito that was swimming in different types of salsa, one of which smelled like curry and made me want to throw up. There was no taste whatsoever and I could barely choke down 1/3 of it. The drinks weren't much better either but at least I could taste the hooch in them. If you're going for drinks it's a great place (if you got money to burn) and if you want to do a conga line for free shots poured down your throat, again great.

This place is in the Treasure Island hotel and has many tables & seating. Not only that, they also have a MC and a dance floor. They were offering free shots to people that were on the dance floors, as well as KTV on the stage. I'll give them credit that they try to make it as festive and upbeat as possible, but the drinks and our waitress was not too pleasant.",7u7MyN89FakNus-IGkfd2Q,2,0,3,OmgK1HHIbHVt0yc5mmnECA

1670559,2016-06-06,0,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"You and everyone that you know need to experience Drag Brunch at Señor Frogs Las Vegas. I know that this happens in Señor Frogs in other cities as well but the Las Vegas one is blowing it out of the water! A friend of mine and I decided to partake in the Saturday brunch a few weeks ago and had a blast! First off you walk in to a very exciting environment with energizing music and images in the background that are reminiscent of Studio 54, yet nouveau. My friend and I are fans of RuPaul's Drag Race and if you are as well you will most definitely enjoy your time here and recognize some of your favorite contestants from past shows. The entire thing is hosted by Shangela, and let me just tell you, she KILLS IT!!!! She brings this amazing fun and funny energy that you would think is reserved for an evening or late night show. You will find yourself clapping and laughing at all times. The cast is awesome, we clearly recognized India Ferrah, Yara Sofia, and Coco Montrese. They were excellent! The production numbers were great and the individual numbers take you to a night time drag show vibe. They also do meet and greats at the end, so stick around. You don't have to be a drag queen fan in order to enjoy the show, you just have to be a fan of having a great time, laughing, and if up to it, singing along to the songs.

Now, on to food and drinks, many many dranks! There is a great array of brunch selections. Wether you feel more like breakfast or lunch, there is something there for you. There is a clear Mexican direction in many of the dishes but trust me when I say that there is something for everyone. The bottomless champagne mimosas are ever flowing. Thanks to our server Saidel, we never went empty on either the champagne or orange juice. As a matter of fact, I never saw an empty bottle or a dirty plate on any of the other tables he was tending to. Regardless of how busy it was, he would manage to come around consistently to make sure we were doing great and ask if we needed anything. My only regret is that I did not have enough cash to tip him more. Because the price is a flat cost up front, I didn't have an opportunity to include an additional tip for the amazing service, and there is no atm in the venue. Make sure to bring some extra cash. Also, don't forget its a drag show. Tips tips tips. There is also a full bar if you feel like something extra. If you are on here you probably appreciate great service, you will definitely appreciate not having to worry about a thing with the incredible service you get here. Hopefully you will get Saidel on your visit as well. 

Over all you will have a great time, eat yummy food and get taken care of by amazing service. The $50 price may scare some people away, but you will see that you will want to keep going back, I know I will. You won't even think about the price when you are having so much fun being entertained all while enjoying good food and endless champagne. The experience is 21+, my friend and I are already talking about going back with a big group. Its that much fun! I highly recommend this!!!",n_JkxLDM54i4IrkyG8pIkA,1,0,5,yI0iXUKG16y1PeJzDK9Leg

We were told that there was a wait to be seated inside and would could sit outside on the patio. We looked at each other like its 45 degrees outside why would we sit outside? That's coming from people from Wisconsin. We found out later that there were patio heaters outside. We sat outside.

Upon looking at the menu for 3 minutes we knew that it was time to go. 17.99 for a Quesadilla? What in the same hell? 19.99 for a bug... gotta be kidding me? Then 15.99 for chicken wings... yet its time to go. We high tailed it outta that place pronto.

The initial reception of Senor Frogs on Yelp has been less than stellar with a little less than 3 stars. Nevertheless, my friend and I still wanted to check out Treasure Island's latest cantina. Senor Frogs is clearly visible off the strip and is the backdrop to the Treasure Island Pirate Show.

The bar/club was relatively slow on the weeknight we visited. We had no problem getting barstools at the main bar. If you turn around, glass walls give you a great view of the Las Vegas Blvd. and the free show. Our server was quick to  bring us their drink menu along with their food menu. We skipped the food since we had just had some appetizers at Margaritaville. Drinks are pricey with an average price of $10 and up.

The drink menu is extensive and my friend had plenty of options. I'm not one for mixed drinks and I stuck to a Long Island with no sweet and sour. The bartender was fast with our drinks and courteous throughout. The bill for two drinks was about $23 not including tax or tip and we were quickly on our way out. However, we did enjoy the servers dancing to the music inside the bar and the pirate show outside.

As we were leaving, we discovered another side of Senor Frogs where it was much more lively. Lots of dancing, lots of balloons, lots of drinking. I'm sure if we had seen this on our way in, we would of stayed a bit longer, but we were ready to head back to our hotel. Senor Frogs isn't bad nor is it great.

The host, Chanel, was AMAZING! So funny, I was laughing so hard I had tears. All the ""women"" looked amazing and were so entertaining. 

The food was decent. Nothing exciting or worth going back for. But you're paying for the show & experience not the culinary portion. You had the standard bulk rubber scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, store bought muffins & cereal. Some Mexican food. Chips & salsa, rolled tacos, chimichangas rice & beans, then random Chinese food & some fresh fruit & granola. 

I unlimited crooks champagne mimosas and the staff was so tentative and always clearing plates, replacing empty champagne bottles and OJ. 

I took one star off for the food and the fact that everything was cash only. And there was no ATM in the place so it limited you. Two girls in our party needed to buy their tickets at the door but we had a reservation. And it was cash only to buy it. They said they would have to go to the atm in the casino and then get back in line. Luckily we all had enough cash to buy their tickets then. Then they have a dollar girl who goes around breaking change to tip the performers. Obviously the more you tip the more attention you get from the performers. They also sell shirts that I would have bought, but again, cash only. 

I would definitely be back again, with cash. Lol",bf-MBZUzp-arMSKvcp_3AA,4,2,4,FMFqtnil-NeZCs1LVE2GRA

It was hard getting to the venue by transportation, since you literally have to walk the whole square all around to get there 20 mins walk in addition to taking the bus. The show started late. The lineup inside of the Treasure island casino was long as was the wait. We had good seats-with bottles of champagne waiting for us at our table-we went through 3 bottles as drinks were included part of the package. The quality of the buffet was average -it had an array of brunch items-the pancakes and bacon were my favourites. Once we settled down with food the show started. It was around an hour long-the drag Queens would perform and then walk around for tip. They were great! So come prepared with small bills, however Chelsea was available to break bills to smaller ones on site. 

This was definitely one of my favourite shows of my trip! I wish I got to purchase the brunch with bitches tank top though!",g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,5,3,4,bXajteNFTS_1RhPlmG6j9Q

Service 
We made a reservation (probably a good idea on busy nights) and were seated right away. Our server (I wish we got her name...) was really great. Fun and casual but not crazy or full of lame jokes. She got our drink and food order whenever we were ready and got the bill quickly when we were done. They had another worker passing through making balloon hats for everyone (no extra charge). She made some pretty amazing balloon creations!  No pressure, however, if you decided not to wear hot air on your head. They were selling raffle tickets that night (and based on Yelp this seems common). I think it was 7 tickets for $20 to win a trip to Cancun. They seem to do a drawing every one and a half to two hours or so. You're only competing with other patrons in the restaurant, so potentially the odds aren't too bad (we bought them but aren't heading south of the border anytime soon). 

Ambiance
Basic bar environment. High chairs and tables generally. Fairly comfortable. Lots of whimsical jokes and puns decorate the ceiling. It wasn't too loud when we were there (Sunday night). They have a stage for live music (none when we were there). It was on the noisy side but still easy to have a conversation. 

Food
Tried the wings, spinach dip, ribs, chicken tacos, and churros. The ribs were the highlight - tender and flavorful with seasoned fries. Otherwise the food was very average. The food menu is actually fairly limited in terms of selection. We had two rounds of assorted cocktails too. Their cocktail menu is extensive!  Tons of mixed and frozen drinks and all different sizes to choose from. They were having a buy one get one free on the largest size drinks I believe (about $35 each). The frog's punch was really good as was the daiquiri. Don't expect garnishes or fancy glasses; plastic cups are the standard here. The drinks were very tasty!!  For very average bar food it is not cheap. Our total with four of the smallest size cocktails, two appetizers, two entrees, and one dessert was about $122 before tip. We did have a restaurant.com certificate which knocked $50 off that. 

Mojo
Overall a fun environment with an extensive selection of cocktails which are tasty but very average and expensive food. I guess after a few of the cocktails you don't notice the food.

-Upstairs has outdoor patio and spacious inside on the second floor, with Latin/Spanish music primarily playing reggateon and salsa music (Senor Frog vibes)

Overall, there are better places than this when in Vegas and I would recommend skipping Senor Frog's and just saving it for when in Mexico.",HyAAsCY79JtNBjjU7pn_dQ,13,9,2,WzZUPPKCBPLDOy-8GqZGVw

The food was OK.  Nothing special about it. It was definitely a bit on the expensive side, being that I did well on the tables outside I didn't mind. 

The club side of it is a different beast!!!  Cover charge changes depending on how busy it is and what day it is.  One day it was $11 and the next $33. They have two floors and three dance floors for all your dancing needs.

The only negative thing I have to say about Señor Frogs is that they need more than one bartender per station. If you want a mixed drink you'll have to wait a very long time.

2241890,2012-10-18,3,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"Well. 

Now, keep in mind.... I have been a fine dining server for 14 years, and a pretty darn good one at that. I really wish I could find other hospitality staff as dedicated to the guest as I am with my own guests. Definitely couldn't find that here. Let me tell you what happened.

Not much to say besides this place was HORRIBLE. I was in Vegas alone, and craving some shrimp fajitas. When I walked in, I asked the hostess if I could be seated outside. She asked how many people? I replied, ""Just me."" She said, ""There's a bar outside where you can order food. You can sit there if you want."" I replied, ""umm, so I can't get a table for one outside?"" She said, ""No, not for one."" 

Now, I don't know who this girl is turning down a person because they are only one. I tip as much as four people would, and probably would've tipped more that night being I had just won $1300 10 minutes before walking into this place. 

Anyhow, I said ok, and made my way to the bar. 

Once at the bar, I took one of the only seats available...it was near the end of the bar, and appeared to be near a service station. Oh well, I guess I have no choice. 

It was a busy night, and being I saw 3 people behind the bar, I assumed they would have the service covered. BOY was I WRONG. I sat there with nothing in front of me for a good 10 minutes. NO exaggeration. I actually looked at my watch. NO Acknowledgement. No eye contact. NOTHING. I even said to the couple next to me, ""How has the service been tonight. They just shrugged, and said, ""It looks like they're pretending that they haven't seen you yet. "" And they laughed. 

As much as I hate doing this, I waved my arm in the air as if in a tacky chinese restaurant. I even said ""Helllllllllllllllo???? "" out loud. FINALLY he comes over and says, ""yes?"" 

I said, ""Hello, how are you this evening? Sorry to BOTHER you, but may I have a menu?"" He gave me a drink menu, and before I had the chance to correct him and request a dinner menu, he was gone again. Like the wind. Then I sat another 10 minutes waiting for him to come back around again. Which he never did. Finally I flagged the OTHER bartender down, and said, ""Hi, I wanted to see a dinner menu please...oh, don't go away. I already know what I want."" 

I ordered the shrimp dish. Then I asked where the bathroom is. His reply was ""You're sitting next to it."" and he laughed. I wasn't amused. He continued, ""JUST KIDDING. It's outside in the casino."" I just nodded, unamused.

When I got up and went to find it, I never wound up going back. 

So, I left. Still starving. And VERY dissatisfied & ashamed of the HORRIBLE service. 

There wasn't a manager to be found either.

2491257,2016-07-15,0,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"This review takes into account the fact that I had a $24 Groupon for $40 worth of food. Otherwise, the meals are WAY too expensive for what you get. 

Both of our meals were fairly good. I got the Chicken Quesadilla ($17), which featured actual cheese that was filled all the way to the edges of the tortilla--unlike some places where you're eating JUST tortilla until you get to the middle. The chicken was a little dry, but not enough to ruin the meal.

My fiancee ordered the beef nachos ($19), which came with REAL cheese, instead of nasty cheese-like sauce. These were impressive, considering this was a gimmicky-type of restaurant. By the time she (with my help) got down to the bottom of the plate, there was plenty of cheese and meat leftover. We didn't have to eat a bunch of plain chips with nothing on them. The nachos were also layered with refried beans, which added a nice touch.

Food-wise, the guacamole was the low point. It was way too oniony and relied on that for its taste.

The atmosphere is pretty cool, so you have to give it points for that, but I don't think I'd come back without a Groupon.

The food isn't terrible, but just doesn't live up to the price tag. In fact, I'm not sure anyone's nachos or quesadillas would. If you're going to dine here, make sure you find a deal online, otherwise you're overpaying.",STPMW3_6Uk1CGCStvJkn4A,2,0,3,g1W8IGHEeOvbZ0YGYJmsVQ

Even under those circumstances, if I could take it back I would.  For starters, no outside drinks.  We had purchased a daiquiri at a bar upstairs just 5 minutes before in the same hotel and had to chug it to get in.  Why the hell can't I take a drink inside that I purchased in the SAME HOTEL as the restaurant?!?!?  Oh I know so I can spend more money at your restaurant!!!  Then the food was very expensive and fairly mediocre.  $17 for an average burger and fries? methinks not.  After chugging our daiquiri and having a pretty good buzz going you'd think the food would taste better.  On top of that the service was just horrible.  Pretty much as long as you're not drinking you don't exist.  I understand that I'm not getting drunk and spending a ridiculous amount of money in your restaurant but I am still a customer.

2597311,2017-05-22,0,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"This review is for the Drag Show Brunch at Señor Frogs only.

This show was amazing!!!

We arrived at 11:00 am for the 11:30 showing.  We started being checked in immediately, and were are able to get our food before the show.  While the Brunch Buffet was okay, the Drinks and entertainment far beyond make up for it.

The Brunch Buffett has a wide variety of breakfast.....cereal, waffles, egg omelets, bacon, sausage, pancakes and also a Mexican lunch option which I wasn't very impressed with.  The lunch option was taquitos, tamales, rice, chimichangas.  They also had additional coffee and grapefruit juice plus fruit and yogurt.  So there is a wide range of food to choose from.  For me though I thought the breakfast was better than the Mexican lunch.

The Drinks......So we bought our tickets and Groupon which you have to redeem both the Groupon and show tickets at the same time.  Also make sure you book the show tickets separately in advance.  Our Groupon was for $57 and the drinks alone were well worth it if you know how expensive a Vegas cocktail is.   If you get the VIP package which we did, we had the entire show of premium open bar plus unlimited mimosas available on the table.  Let me tell you the wait staff was amazing, our bottles on the table were never empty the second a bottle finished they were putting in a new one on ice.  The bartender was awesome, he was quick and those drinks were strong.  You can get seriously wasted during this 2 hour show and they strongly encourage it!!  Between my friends and I, we had 6-8 drinks from the bar each on top of what was on the table.  To top it off when the show is over they tell you to take the bottles on the table with you so many people walked out with full bottles of champagne.

The actual show is AMAZING!!!!  These ladies were fabulous and didn't disappoint.  Chanelle the host will have you laughing from the get go.  The costumes and makeup are incredible.  They work the entire crowd so it didn't matter where you sat.  most performances start on stage and move into the crowd.  And yes they get tips,  but don't worry if you don't have smaller bills, before the show one of the hostesses will exchange you big bills for smaller ones.  And trust me once you see their talents you will be holding up dollar bills for your favorite performers.

Also don't forget to tip your bartenders and wait staff.  They were all great kept our tables clear and our drinks full.  This was well worth it and we had a great time.  I would definitely recommend this show.",vuxUfKN7Lg0edobnVOclfw,3,0,5,7fIlVBQunxG9uVBcNqRsrg

The service was good, with the exception of trying to pay, my husband did not want to just hand over his mobile phone for them to get the Groupon code from so they made him go up to the cashier so that she could use HER mobile phone to scan it.  Other than him getting irritated over that and charging us for tortillas that should have come with the meal, I found the service attentive.  That was the end of the good for me.

I had a hard time deciding what to get so I finally just got a Mexican Platter which was a bunch of different things.  It came with steak (tasty, but tough), chicken enchiladas (not tasty, dry, and funky), a chimichanga (boring), some fried jalapenos stuffed with cheese (probably the best thing on the plate - hard to jack up deep fried pub grub), beans (my husband said they were great - I don't eat beans), and rice (yuck).  Plus sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  I felt like with the steak, it should have come with tortillas because usually that's how I eat Mexican steak, you kinda shove it all in a tortilla, so I asked for a tortilla and they brought me three small flour tortillas (barely warm) and charged an extra $2.50 to my $25 plate.  The husband ordered, as usual, buffalo chicken wings, served with ranch dressing, celery, and carrots, and he liked them, although I found them a disturbing color of neon red.

I had ordered a drink in a plastic palm tree.  Now that glass was an interesting shape!  YIKES!  But, I ordered something with rum and tropical fruit punch flavors, all frozen-y.  It was good and I think it was about 22 oz for $20.

The total bill came out to about $70.  AT A SENOR FROGS!  So overpriced for seriously low quality food.  They should be embarrassed.  It's true that my other experiences with Senor Frogs were all in Mexico where the food is good and prices reasonable and here we are in Vegas, but let me suggest you choose another option for your Mexican dining pleasure.

We got the:
1. fish tacos 
2. chicken burrito

Yes! We could have probably saved $$ if went to a regular taco place, but it's the casino. What do you expect? 

Fish tacos were actually bomb and I actually wanted more of it.  Eat it with Cholula sauce if u get it.

The chicken burrito was underwhelming. There were a lot more rice than chicken, but it will definitely fill you up.  Recommend it, if you like QUANTITY over Quality!

Located inside Treasure Island! Sitting at the table looks more fun than sitting at the bar. Good choice of alcohol! Moderate amount of patience needed!",s8EFIOWZo5kjmVbbNmblkg,0,0,3,FrABuqQer4-pYaAwKzbKwg

It doesn't have the same feel as the ones down in Mexico and the drink prices are very over priced even for a regular sized cup.

Honestly though, the environment is really energetic and loud so don't expect to actually talk to anyone you are eating with. The fish and chips are good, food wise. Oh, and you can take goofy pictures, so that's fun.

Hint: if you walk in somewhere and they ask if you are there to drink or to eat, never eat the food. Unless you love globs and globs of cheese. The rubbery, oily kind. 

Cons: Literally the WORST meal that I have ever paid for. Had to pay for chips and salsa. The salsa was awful. How do you mess up salsa in a Mexican restaurant? My partner ordered tacos. Only ate two bites of one taco because they were gross. Again, how do you mess up tacos in a Mexican restaurant?

The food was also both a pro and a con...some of it was great, like the bacon, salsa, lox, and...well, that was it.  The eggs were dry and much of the other food was super carb-ie and bland.  The plates are small, too. I like to eat, and it was hard to fit the food on my plate.  Difficult to carry coffee and stuff through to my seat, since the tables are super close together.

The place was small inside and a bit overrated.  The drink list they showed us was WAY overpriced.  Drinks starting at $10 each and going onwards of $12, $20, etc (good thing we had popped open beers we had brought ourselves before entering the restaurant).  I thought the menu would be strictly Mexican food, but it was a mixture of Mexican, Tex-Mex, and American.  Everything on the menu was about $12 and up for a plate.  The food was decent, but unlike other Mexican restaurants where they provide free chips and salsa, they charge you $4.99.  Here's the kicker.  When I got my bill, I realized the tax was $11 (my total bill was approximately $76).  When I alerted the waitress of this, she checked with the manager to find out why the tax was so high and he said that there is a 10% ""Entertainment"" tax.  WHAT?!  Entertainment tax?  I've never encountered such a thing.  There was absolutely no entertainment of any sort going on, unless you consider a MC chick trying to get the crowd all pumped up entertainment.  Due to this ridiculous entertainment tax and high prices, I don't think I'll be going here again.  Please check your receipts to see if you got charged this ""Entertainment tax"" too.

I am going to give them 3 stars because they knew what gluten free meant and I did not get glutened. Also, they had a great atmosphere, an energetic and entertaining DJ, good music spinning and some of the staff was energetic. They could dance well, so that definitely counts for something too.

I thought my food was so-so. At best. I got the chicken enchiladas, and to be quite honest, I've had several microwave enchiladas that were better than these ones. There was no cheese on the inside of the enchilada, a random slice of swiss cheese (swiss cheese in Senor Frogs?) on top of the enchiladas and there was also no sauce in the inside of the enchilada. The sauces were served on the side and were delicious, definitely, and the guacamole had some character (I stole it from my fiance), the rice was decent and the beans were just beans. I also disappointed by my lackluster corn tortilla. Just not exciting.

My fiance's food was tasty for him. Chicken tenders (if you mess those up you should pack your bags), chicken quesadilla, barbecue wings and taquitos. The chicken quesadilla was good, but nothing too exciting, the wings were also good, but nothing to write home about, the chicken tenders were great for him and so were the taquitos. His platter came with a bunch of sides which was nice (sour cream, guacamole, salsa, etc), but it just didn't excite either of us in any way. My friend also get the Tex-Mex Tacos and they just weren't exciting. Seriously. Blah.

The one thing that saves this place? THE DRINKS. Wow are they good. If you don't want something sweet, try the Pimp Frog Juice. It has every liquor possible but not a lot of juice; it could get you in a lot of trouble though! The best value is getting the drink in the palm tree cup that should be Rated R due to its shape. LOL. Sorry. I reverted back to adolescence there. The drink is a perfect size and you can take the glasses around after you leave the restaurant and move on to more booze and happier times.

We start out by putting our name in, we are told it will be a 15 minute wait. No worries, were in a casino! We can just hit the slots and grab a drink while we wait. 30 minutes go by, and we haven't been texted or called about our table. I decided to check with the hostess, just in the event we missed something. The hostess states she forgot we were waiting, and that she could seat us now. As we walk in we notice there are empty seats all throughout the restaurant. I'm not quite sure why there was a wait to begin with....

Needless to say, we are starving and can't wait to get some stuff to eat! we start with the chips and salsa. And we get two of the souvenir drinks (for the price of one). The chips come out nice and warm, unfortunately the cook forgot to grab from the fresh batch, because they were so stale and lacked flavor. Luckily the salsa packed a small punch so it could sound out the stale chips.

My fiancé and her friend shared an order of the chicken fajitas, while I ordered the chicken tacos.

I enjoyed my chicken tacos very much, I felt like the food was cooked perfectly, again except for the fact that the tortillas were also stale. It was very noticeable and concerning, but I was so hungry i didn't make a big deal of it.

By the looks of it, my fiancé and her friend also enjoyed their fajitas, but for some reason it didn't come with any sour cream or cheese? And the guacamole wasn't to be touched, it looked like something that sat in a can for about 3 weeks before it was served.

As far as the service goes, I kind of got a ""Dicks last resort"" kind of feel. The waitress wasn't necessarily rude, but she could clearly care less if we were having a good time or if our orders were cooked to order.

We left with that feeling like ""I'm full, but I feel gross, and wish we went somewhere else"". 

So with that, I would suggest you dine somewhere else.

Today, it seems like everyone is offended by everything and that the slightest thing will tick someone off.  These reviews for Senor Frogs are just ridiculous, people demand so much perfection, its actually hilarious reading these and how pathetic each individual sounds.  By the way, if you want perfection, then go to a 4 star $100+ restaurant; quit wasting everyone's time complaining.  Regardless, Senor Frogs, what a great place!  I purchased the groupon ($20 for $40) and the Yard drink groupon ($33 for 2 yard drinks)

Waited about 15min to be seated, they can take your phone number down and text you when your table is available, so it's not biggie going inside TI to play some, instead of waiting in the very small waiting area, definitely a nice perk.  

Let's start off with the food, I went with the burrito and my fiancee went with the fajitas, we also ordered the chips/salsa.  The burrito was unreal, and hard to finish, the fajitas were very filling as well.  Again, not sure what people are complaining about when they say the portion sizes are small??..

Yard Drinks, well, they already have a BOGO, so the groupon is pointless, unless you can snag a promotional discount on groupon (like I did; extra 20% off purchase) which makes it worth buying.  The drink was delicious and they did not cheap on alcohol.  

Atmosphere is great; the DJ kept giving away free shots (like every 5 minutes), and entertained with great club like music.  He also made sure to get everyone involved (singing along, clapping, etc).  I guess if you are boring and do not like fun, exciting, loud crowd involvement, then this place is not for you, and you should probably stick to eating at a senior center, though, I have heard those places can get out of control as well.  

I will say, without the groupon the prices are slightly steep, but remember, NOTHING is cheap in Vegas, groupon and travelzoo make it way easier to save money, so take advantage of it!

I ordered a chimichanga plate and my girlfriend the chicken enchiladas. Each plate came with Rice and Beans. All of the food was cold. The chimichanga had some redeeming factors such as decent chicken (okay only one redeeming factor). The tortilla was overcooked and drenched in some sort of tomatillo sauce which was bland. My girlfriends' food was even more disgusting. What half-way decent restaurant puts Kraft Swiss Singles on top of enchiladas? None, but a restaurant like Senor Frog's does!

Maybe someone who doesn't have a clue what Mexican food is will find the food satisfactory. I will not be eating this garbage ever again.

On top of the long wait, their food was supremely subpar. Their iced tea was watery and didn't come with any lemons (or sugar for that matter... our table was void of any sugar what-so-ever and it took another 5 minutes to flag down another waiter to get some for us).

To start, the Soda is $6 each! The two pops I had were $2 less than my meal. The cups were half filled with ice, so the pop was very watered down. We were offered the unbalanced cups to take home, but they were heavily used and dinged. When getting the bill, I confronted the waiter about the price and he didn't seem to care, or make any effort to resolve my concern.

The food we ordered was terribly bland, and I am disappointed this was my last dinner Vegas. The nachos were soggy because they put all the toppings on top of the chips (guacamole, sour cream, salsa, fried beans). The cheese steak was terribly bland and dry, with just a thin layer of beef.

The restaurant itself was empty, although we went at dinner time. This could be for a number of reasons, but it meant a restaurant with blaring music, 5 servers bothering us every minute, and a friendly note on the bill that said

The waiters sang a Backstreet Boys song and opened up the karaoke for anyone else.  They would leave signs behind patrons, like ""single and looking"" or ""kiss me.""

I tried to be a good sport and drink it, but it was burning my esophagus.  Did I ask for cold liquefied salsa and sugar in a cup? Ewww.  Also, it was in one of those clear plastic cups from the dollar store.  For the prices, the could use better cups!

I do not recommend this place to anyone.",_oEWe8fnyAif0sBYrju-Lw,15,14,1,9egETIyI1FKoBxiKGAJDAA

We were given a 2 for 1 drink special coupon while walking down the strip. I decided to drop by this place to grab a drink before blowing our money at the Casino. I was worried there was a catch to this coupon, but to my surprise, there was none :) We ordered 2 Jameson on the rocks for only $10! What a steal :D I believe the amount of alcohol poured was very fair (I HATE when it's 90% ice 10% alcohol).

This place is C-C-CRAZYYYY. Everyone is drunk and getting their groove on. It's actually quite fun to just watch while sippin' on drinks. I saw a few tables dining in, but I think I'll pass on food served here. It's VEGAS! There are so many other appetizing places to eat.

It's super dark in here. That's how you know it's going to be crackinn' ;) Fast service, but nothing spectacular.

Tip: Gather a bunch of friends to grab a few drinks here before going to bigger and better things. This place will light the party fire in you, no doubt.

I've made it a point to visit every location including their sister restaurant- El Squid Roe (now that place is bomb check my review on their Cabo San Lucas location).

SF makes some fun drinks and the decor is really gritty. Plenty of hidden puns and if you pay attention like you do with a ""Where's Waldo"" book you'll find some hidden gems.

You can either drink/dine outside or inside where it tries to have a club setting.

The sound system is average not up to par for a venue in Las Vegas the crowd is a mixture something you would find if your in college  and on spring break. The music was decent  but that shows when the headlining  Dj's are Pepito & Pepe. There ok but the musical selection was to predictable.

Their alcohol menu is big and they have decent specials for being on the strip. Unfortunately their food menu was very basic. They don't have a lot of the traditional Mexican entrees. Pretty much quesadillas, chips and fajitas. So I stuck with the enchiladas. 

I must say, the enchiladas were definitely tasty. They didn't skimp on the chicken and that sauce had a good flavor and had a nice kick to it. It also came with a small portion of rice and beans which also tasted great. Just like any other place on the strip, it's on the pricey side, but felt it was a fair price after I ate it all. It for sure filled me up.

Now we are locals... so we can eat all over town from between 15-25 dollars.   But I took a chance... and we went into this overpriced tourist trap.   It is located in Treasure Island.   

First of all we had our kids with us.. and when we walked through the casino to the restaurant, they said it would be about 15 min and that we could sit on the bench outside the restaurant.   We sat down there, and then one of the Casino Security People came by to say that my children could not sit there, that they had to stand in the restaurant.   I protested but he acted like he wouldn't mind kicking us out of the Casino altogether... so we complied.    

Once seated, I told the waitress that we had a groupon coupon, and that we wanted to spend $50  but no more and no less.  She offered to let me know how much it was as the meal progressed and I said great.   Well, the place was fun and the signs on the ceiling were fun to read... and we were enjoying the tourist flavor of the place.  We ordered.... but the menu was very expensive.   Appetizers were $28  slammers were 13 clam chowder was 8 and a couple of beverages brought the tab to $67 dollars?

Then I had some trouble with the waitress taking my cell phone... then demanding that I go online to the Groupon site...so she could redeem my coupon.  I went there after some awkward moments... and it was already redeemed.  Then I asked for my bill and a to go box, and she brought the bill, but after that.... she went on to wait on other tables,... and we had to go hunting for a to go box.   

The food.... the food was ok, but not HOT, the soup was lukewarm,   the pepsi was in a tiny little mug......the sauces were old and prepared in advance so the Guacamole was dark on top... the sour cream had water around it... so it was sitting in a fridge for a few hours...... the whole experience was a dissapointment, as I didn't expect to have to pay another $25 for the balance of the tab and tip.

I will not be returning to this place.   So after a  long drive to the strip.. having to park and walk a mile.... waiting and being harrassed by security, then finding that  this place is priced so high.... that even with a groupon coupon... it is a rip off...I don't recommend anyone go there.

Most of the things we didn't like about our visit other reviewers have already mentioned in recent reviews: our table was all sticky even though we were among the first customers for the day; the hard chairs were uncomfortable, if you're not tall your feet will be dangling when you sit; our nachos were good but my friend said his chicken fajitas were really lacking in flavour and my beef chimichanga was not even the way it was described in the menu -no cheese, no sour cream, only a tiny bit of sauce underneath and inside half the filling was the same red rice that was served as a side order on my plate. Why would somebody want so much rice? This was a very poorly composed entrée. How about getting rid of some of that rice and instead have some retried beans, cheese, sour cream, salsa, salad or something instead of all that rice? 
And you better like that bright red sauce they use because they seem to use it on everything; the nachos, the rice, the sauce on a stuffed tortilla. 
After I asked for my missing sour cream it didn't get brought to our table until we had both given up on wanting to eat this overpriced, bland meal. 
Oh yeah, the tall Margarita slush drinks tasted weak, too. If you want a good one with lots of Tequila at a good price try the Circus Circus casino.

My tacos arrived and I took one bite - zero flavor. Lots of chicken, but NO flavor. It came with guac, sour cream and salsa, cheese was smothered on the chicken but it was so gross!

1.  Seating was assigned, and you were not smashed together.  We had a table near the stage, smack in the middle.  Good location, but right next to a speaker.
2.  Food was a brunch buffet.  A mix of breakfast items, and Mexican food.  It was just average, maybe a bit below.  Nothing special.  It was easy to get to, never a long line, and they didn't run out of anything.  You could go up as much as you wanted.
3.  Drinks.  Each table had 2 bottles of champagne and a picture of oj.  There was no waitress, so for any other drinks, you had to get up and go to the bar.  They were included, but you had to get them yourself.  They did have top shelf liquor at the bar though.
4.  The show.  It was decent.   These were not the best, nor the 2nd best, nor 3rd best, drag queens that I've seen.  It is like watching a movie that went straight to video.

4415613,2016-05-17,6,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"We had a Living Social deal for $40 worth of food (I paid about $15 with discounts - coupon didn't include alcohol).  

TBH, I wasn't expecting much even after the oddly positive NYT review of the Times Square location.  But this was a pretty damn decent lunch.

There was a wait for a table at 12:30 on a weekday.  They notify you by text message when your table is ready.  You can choose to sit inside or outside, where there is a view of the Siren's Cove and the strip.  But it was hot out and I prefer indoor tables.  Diva.  Wait was only about 15 minutes.

Service was very friendly and quick.  No issues whatsoever with the Living Social deal.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is quirky, casual and fun.  They really push the Yard drinks but it was lunch time and I'm not 19 so we passed on those.

We started with the guac and chips (11.25).  Nice and fresh tasting guacamole and chips served in a paper bag (?).  Good way to start a meal here.

I had the sliders with fries from the appetizer menu ($14.75).  Large portion - plenty to eat as a main course.  And they were pretty good.  I was happy.  She had the veggie fajitas ($14.25), and she deemed them ""excellent"".  Again, very large portion size.  Senor Frogs delivers on the value for your buck.

We really enjoyed our lunch here and the Living Social was a terrific deal...  highly recommend you grab that deal if you see it and hit up Senor Frogs in Vegas.",0x9xu_b0Ct_6hG6jaxpztw,11,9,4,YHi0eyunWvTq5qdvS3E1ow

I ordered the blt wrap. There was hardly any bacon, what there was was like bacon bits. The lettuce was slimy, wilted and just gross. The tortilla was so tough that it took effort for us to tear it at all with our hands,  let alone take a bite.

It is harder to judge food in a drunken state of mind. When you taste the food at Senor Frog's while sober you might find it hard to come back a second time. But even with the BOGO deal on the drinks there are limitations as far as the selection available for the voucher. Do I really want a Bud Light? Nah. Do I want a house margarita mixed with the crappy tequila? No, thanks. 

The only thing that was decent was the chips and salsa. The taco salad would've been acceptable too but the chicken was way overcooked. I understand chicken breast can be dry some times but this one was beyond dry. It was desert dry. I guess this suits the environment. The new tag line for the chicken taco salad should be, ""Think the Las Vegas desert is dry? Try our chicken salad."" Get your jaw muscle ready because you'll be chewing for awhile. 

The worst part is the price point doesn't match the quality. With a beer and entree you're looking at around $25-$30 per person for a disappointing meal.",1IDGT7RHqYF76jm7CRuXdQ,2,0,2,2cneUppb2IN38Dl4J3zhDQ

My guy did notice that bar tender dude has Invisalign (which I currently have and suffer 'major bitch moments' from) so maybe his face just hurt and he was really grumpy. 

Either way - we asked for a recommendation on a frozen drink with good tequila and bar tender dude clearly states that frozen drinks are not made with good tequila. Well. Sh*t. Just wanted a rad frozen drink but ok.... You only use trash tequila in frozen drinks. Got it.

Every other interaction with bar tender dude was a bit, well - snooty. Oops, our bad, we were a customer in the establishment that you WORK at. Sorry to inconvenience you. 

Eventually we made our way outside to a table, but only to be told we could have a table, yet we could not be 'served' because it was 'just a table'. Guess paying triple the price for food does not warrant table service. Cool.

My daughter is a HUGE fan Rupaul's Drag Race & some of the cast perform at this show. So she chose this as one of the activities to celebrate her 21st birthday in Las Vegas. 

A group of us gals bought tickets via groupon. You need to redeem both the ticket & groupon voucher there at the venue so make sure you have it (or on your phone). VIP's do not need to wait in the very long line.  So I highly recommend the VIP tix --- no waiting in line, you receive priority seating, unlimited alcohol at the bar in addition to unlimited mimosas, and their buffet. The buffet had many choices, such as waffles, eggs, bacon, cheese omelets, yogurt, tamales, taquitos, juices, coffee, etc. 

All of the performances were amazing & the show had great energy.  The host (dressed in red here in this pic) was my FAVE--very funny & so entertaining!!!

I already had a souvenir glass (several, actually) and he said he'd give me the refill price to fill it even though it wasn't theirs. I think I chose the ""fruit punch"" option. There were only 2 options and I think the other was ""margarita"". Whichever one I chose, it tasted like it had a frog in it. I joked that that was the origin of the name, but seriously it was not good. I was able to go to a regular bar in the casino and have them add some grenadine to cut the frogginess and it made it palatable enough to finish.

I've been to a few Señor Frog's and they are crazy and wild and fun ... this one wasn't.  Except for a table of drunk guys wearing balloon hats, it was mostly families.  Not a good sign :(

The free appetizer was mini nachos.  It took a while for them to arrive and they were cold.  It's bad enough that they use canned cheese ... cold canned cheese is gross.  They were definitely not worth the price.

I ordered a chicken chimichanga, without sour cream or guacomole.  Though the chicken was good and there was lots of it, there was definitely no cheese mixed in with it.  The Mexican rice inside really overpowered it (especially since there was rice on the side too).

My server, while efficient, was rather cold and abrasive ... not warm and fuzzy at all.

4738665,2017-11-19,1,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"Introduction: 
Since we've never been here, thought we gave it a try, man was it a disappointment.  I am definitely surprised the rating is so high. I mean, there's nothing great I can find to say that's exceptional.  I really try to look for something positive.

Price: 0/5
Generally, I don't care about price if the food and service is good. About $17 for 10 pieces of horrible buffalo wings and about $26 for a horrible mixed chicken & beef fajitas is def expensive.

Service: 1/5
Our server was actually friendly, we don't deal with her much right after she took our order. Except when she bring us our bill. But what makes their service so bad? No Chips, in addition, they nickel & dime you to death. Even charge you for salsa. WTF? I have never came to a Mexican restaurant with no courtesy chips and salsa. Also, took forever to get our salsa and when we finally got it, it tasted horrible.

Quality: 0/5
NO Bueno! The buffalo wings were salty as hell and had a peanut taste to it. Kinda weird, tasted like a Thai Chicken Sate. Just doesn't taste right on buffalo wings. The fajitas was also gross, way too much paprika powder. Tasted like I was sniffing someone's bad armpit the entire time.

Quantity: 3/5
They do give you a lot of food, I am assuming it appears there was a lot because it tasted so crappy, I left a lot behind.

Cleanliness: 3/5
Not immaculate or nothing spectacular, but definitely not dirty, just a Meets standard rating. 

Tips:
If you still want to try this place out, at least get a Groupon special. Personally, even with the discount, I still don't think it's worth it.",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,1,0,1,rpBlbpdNkP8ozCDKSv9BOw

4781101,2016-07-24,8,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"The saga of the 3-4  hour meal.

Our waiter (Jameson) steps up to the table and does not speak, just stares at us. 

""Hi?"" We ask tentatively after 30 seconds or so.
""Water"" He grunts.  
We don't know if he is offering it or requesting it but we say ""Yes! Please!"" hoping it is an offer because it is HOT out on that patio we are sitting on even though the hostess who had talked us into sitting out there claimed it was cool, and we have already been waiting 15 minutes for a waiter to appear.

Jameson turns and walks away. 
10 or 15 minutes later he returns with cups of water and again just leaves.

Another 15 minutes later and he comes back to stare at us.  We had been laughing and debating on whether or not he even  is our waiter, and I ask if we can get a pitcher of water because we have all drank our little cups and sucked down every sliver of ice.  He does not acknowledge the request and only says ""Order."" and then ""No Fettuccine Alfredo."".

We place our order and I again ask for a lot more water which goes unacknowledged but 10 minutes later he comes and grabs a pitcher from the pile of dirty dishes in the corner and a bit after that appears with a pitcher of ice water. 
It looked and smelled clean so I am hopeful that he washed it. 

30 minutes later he comes out again.  By this point the patio is completely deserted except for our table, the couple of other guests who had been there are long gone.  At some point the music has come on so loud we cant even speak to the person next to us.   We ask for the ice tea my friend had ordered and for more water and he just  smirks but does grab the pitcher and eventually dropped the tea off at the table. We asked about the chips and Salsa that come with our meal but he acts like he did not hear us. He didn't leave any sugar but ay some point someone came in to clear the dirty dishes and that guy kindly brought over some sweeteners. 

An hour after we ordered he comes to me and screams in my ear (because its so loud) that if we want fresh taco salads it will take 20 minutes to make. Is that OK?
I was shocked to discover that he could speak more than one word at a time and I said that 20 minutes was fine because we do want fresh salads but that if we could get our chips and salsa that come with our meal  now that would be great.
He said chips and salsa don't come with our meal but we showed him the menu and that it does.  The chips and salsa (2 orders even though there were 4 of us and it was supposed to come with each meal) arrived after about 25 minutes.

We begged again for more water and finally got that too (It was SO hot on the patio)  

THEN IT GOT WEIRD.
Finally our Enchilada, Fish Tacos and 2 Taco Salads arrived.  AND 4 plates of Fettuccine Alfredo.  He doesn't say a word, just drags another table over next to our table and motions for one of us to go sit at it.  We say we didn't order Pasta, he says we did.  I start laughing so hard I think I am going to pee my pants, are we on a Reality Show????

We eat and we all agree that the chicken in our food is AMAZING and I begin to wish the service was not SO Awful. I take a tiny bite of rice and it is SUPER hard.  Either uncooked, or cooked many many hours ago, so gross.

We eat and 20 minutes after we are done we find Jameson again, he comes to clear the plates and we ask for the dessert that comes with our meal. 

No he says.   The Kitchen is Closed.   Then he walks away.",4-eJQ4otGWVtFUpd2URC2w,3,0,1,-_WnzX5P1ReECNNXPd7zqw

Senor Frogs fit the bill pretty well. Although we came just as a torrential downpour occurred, which pushed us from the patio, to the bar to finish eating, the food and service were quite good and the prices reasonable (for Vegas standards). BUT, while we were there there was some sort of singer/karaoke going on. I'm thinking a mixture of the two because we heard one girls' voice for several songs, but every once and awhile some obviously amateur's voice would ring out ""I'm too Sexy"" or a Spice Girl song.
Problems: First of all, I did NOT sign up for karaoke. We sat AWAY from all of that to avoid it, but the problem was that they have speakers over all the tables, regardless of where you are and they were LOUD! Secondly, the woman singing, who, from what we could gauge over the speakers, worked here, was NOT a good singer. It was like listening to one of those American Idol auditions, where the person thinks they're great, but just sort of yells the song out and no one can be bothered to tell them they suck, because they're not nails on a chalkboard, but they're still not good either.
Sadly, we had to listen to this, even though we were in a totally different room!

Bar fee?? ... what the hell is that?? ... I'm being charged to sit in their place, I guess. Whatever.  Back to the drinks....nothing but a complete rip off.  The waiter conveniently over charged me for drinks we didn't order...and later when I brought it to his attention...he said ""my bad"" (LOL...really? That's all you got for me?). Also, when I mentioned the lack of alcohol in my yard size margarita...the waiter brought  me one small shot to pour in....and said ""sorry, next time you visit us, and if the drinks are weak, just let me know. I'll take care of you."" (again,  I'm laughing and shaking my head).  I suggest you turn around and walk back out before you sit down and get trapped.  Next!!!

So we asked to be moved, and the host was hesitant to move us, because we already ordered items at the bar and apparently it's hard to move you to the ""restaurant"" in the system ... We were able to move after some pleading... Which seemed pretty silly. The host had an attitude about it, which put us off.

We noticed lots of empty tables in our new spot, so we are thinking they tell you there is a wait, so people think oh this is the spot to be, let's put our name down on the waiting list ... or the waiters are lazy or something.

Back to the food .. think upscale Taco Bell. We weren't impressed. Our appetizer was like $18 and our Carne Asada was $29... I mean damn. And it wasn't spectacular.

Why is the food here so gosh darn awful?! Such a prime location with great views of the strip yet they can't give you a decent meal. Tsk tsk! Especially at these ridiculous prices! My girlfriends came here for happy hour which is between 3-6pm. No food specials but their souvenir cup drinks are buy one get one free. So roughly a yard would be anywhere between $10-$15 for one during hh. 

We shared an order of chicken quesadilla, steak nachos and sliders. Chicken quesadilla was good. Nice pieces of grilled chicken but for some reason it was hard keeping it together. Not for the lack of cheese but whatever cheese they used didn't melt that well to glue the tortilla together. Steak nachos were awful! Hardly any steak and nothing about it would make me want to order it again. How can you mess up nachos? So easy!! Sliders were awful! Dry dry dry! The buns were so hard they were inedible. We really should have sent it back come to think of it. The patty looked like something that came out of the microwave. Are you serious? 

Senor Frogs has so much potential! Such a cute theme and nice fun restaurant. Would be a great place to day drink and have a shareable meal, unfortunately it is just all crap. If you're looking for a fun day time place to lunch on the strip, I'd go to Diablos at the Monte Carlo instead.

Senor Frogs is the vacationing tourist bar/ dance spot to go to if you don't want to deal with the crazy pretentious crowd of Cali residents that drove all the way to Vegas to be packed in a club on top of one another.

Its located in the front of the Treasure Island Resort and at 10:30pm you have to be at least 21 or older to enter for a night of drinking and dancing. The DJ was cool, he played top 40s and some hip hop music so we all danced the night away. They were celebrating one of the staff members leaving the TI pirate show so in honor of that we all got up and did the Wobble dance. There was also this 2 for 1 margarita special with the huge souvenir cups so you know we jumped up on that deal.

Rather than order inside, we decided to order our yard-style drinks before coming in. I clarified with the bartender what drinks were 2 for 1, she said all of them. 

I said great, we'll take two of these size (pointing to the 22oz containers for $24 directly on the menu) and picked the flavors. She quickly made the drinks, served them and I handed her my credit card. As I handed her my card, she took it quickly and said that would be $35...

Whoa, even will a full tip our order wouldn't be $35. I attempted to call out to her as she stepped to the side to do the transaction. Excuse me, ma'am...   excuse me, ma'am.... She didn't hear me. She came back over with my copy to fill out and I asked her, weren't these supposed to be $24? She then goes on to say, no the $35 ones are 2 for 1.

Strange, she got the flavors right, though.  The gentlemen next to us at the bar even corroborated my story when they heard our conversation with her. 

I asked if she could make the adjustment and this is not what we wanted. Her response was that they didn't even have the size we ordered (strange, considering they were on the menu and I pointed at them) AND again said that only the $35 and higher drinks were 2 for 1... THEN ASKED (with an attitude) IF WE WANTED HER TO TAKE THE DRINKS BACK AND BE CHARGED FULL PRICE FOR TWO SMALLER DRINKS, which would have come to more than the $35 she JUST charged me. Seriously? This is how guests are treated at Senor Frogs? Nooo... not the Senor Frogs I know of. But it was... really happening. Frustrated, I said you know what... no, we came to have fun. We'll keep the drinks if you're going to be difficult about owning up to YOUR mistake. I signed the receipt with ZERO tip and we joined our party inside. 

When we got in, our enjoyment was completely leveled out. The fun atmosphere we came to enjoy wasn't enjoyable. We didn't even want to order food anymore as we felt we'd just been ripped off and essentially told to deal with it. At that point, I asked to speak to a manager. 
I spoke to the manager on duty and told her the situation. After defending her bartender's mistake, she scripted an insincere apology (Robotically, ""LET-ME-SAY-I'M SORRY-ABOUT-THE-INCONVENIENCE."") and again offered to TAKE THE DRINKS BACK and offer a full refund. 

Think about that.... 

Her bartender makes a mistake, she fakes an apology and then destroys inventory (because obviously she had an attitude as well) and doesn't even attempt to satisfy the guests needs. We never asked for free drinks... we just wanted to pay for what we asked for or to be offered a reasonable exchange.

It was more or less, I'm giving you a f***ing refund, give me my drinks back.  Just here's your refund, bye. She didn't even offer to order another drink for us, or say we'll take the drinks back and just apply the funds to your dinner tonight that you're about to order... nothing. 

We wanted to have drinks,  order food and enjoy our night. That was the plan. Our night was effectively ruined by the staff that evening. The bartender, Lila, (check number 773174) and her manager need definite lessons on guest service standards.",0jiK8OqIYc5A5oLLy39SOw,7,1,1,fhS1wNJSQ7-utppHmvURWQ

5323883,2017-04-23,4,HWl2EbZhkhAkFgqt44yUkA,"Avoid this sheisty tourist trap. Eight of us dined here Thursday night, and the waiter, Felix, tried to scam our party on the check. My group ordered drinks, food, and several rounds of shots. Two people in the group, including myself, were not drinking, so we had our logical thinking caps on. It started off with Felix telling us he could not divide up the check as it would back up the system for too long. We were the only group on the patio, but we did not want to be a pain, so we told him OK. 

Next let me just say that the food is really over-priced. I paid $15.99 for a cheese quesadilla that was all cheese and tortilla with small scoops of sour cream, guac, pico, and jalapenos. It was good, but not $16 good. 

Also, I tried to walk outside to take a phone call as the music is blaring on the inside. The bouncer carded me - on the way out, and told me if I left without showing him my ID I would not get stamped to come back in. Ummm, dude, it is obvious I am coming from the inside, so just stamp my hand already. Why the grief? Plus he was a dick. I just went back inside. I'm not trying to waste my time to walk back to the patio, fish my ID out of my purse, walk back to the front to show him my ID to satisfy his doorman power-trip. 

Now, back to Felix. When we ask our waiter, Felix, for our bill, he returns with a receipt for $360. It just shows the total as he already ran the credit card. One girl in our party had given him her card to pay for one round of drinks, and ended up charged for the entire thing. We had to ask for an itemized receipt. Felix told us the computer did not print itemized receipts. One member of our party was standing next to him at the computer and said, ""yes it does. There is the button for it right there. Just press it"", and voila - the itemized receipt was printed. Upon viewing it, we discovered we had been charged an automatic gratuity. Felix the waiter purposely did not give us the itemized receipt hoping to get double gratuity.  The pricing on the shots was pretty questionable as well. Felix was extremely shady about the entire thing and not cooperative at all. Felix swindles tourists.  

Everyone in the group left feeling like they had been taken. My advice is to just avoid this place all together. There really isn't any redeeming quality about it. Want to visit a Senor Frogs - hit the one in Cancun instead.",-ugFDhdMt-p8-2dA-Tmxiw,21,4,1,uyK1Vgyu-ADN2j9tEHyoxg

We ate here for dinner because my friends wanted to check it out. The night we went was mostly dead because I think it was a Wednesday. The food was good but nothing to write home about.

We already tried The Yard in Myrtle Beach so we stuck to water. Eventually we reminded ourselves that we were in Las Vegas and needed to man up so we searched for the shot girl we saw walking around earlier. She was nowhere to be found and we had to flag down our waiter, who brought over a round. What he brought were these mixed shots/shooters, which were tasty, but there was definitely not much alcohol in it. So much for manning up. We got another round just because and then the waiter gave us the next two rounds after that for free. I would not have gotten more otherwise because it simply wasn't worth paying for. Our waiter was very nice, attentive, and able to keep conversation. Even his awkward flirting was entertaining.

While all this was going on, we were watching a group of British men being aggressively accosted by a birthday girl and her friends in the bar area and dance floor. The guys were visibly uncomfortable but they all left together so I guess that turned out okay. We had to sit through a few cover songs by a cheesy, awful band. Thankfully we got there as their set was finishing up. A little later all the servers got up on stage to do some type of line dance which was fun to watch.

I think the prices were about the same as they were in Myrtle Beach, but this time around I wasn't sticker-shocked. This is probably due to the fact that I already experienced Senor Frog's before and/or was used to paying Vegas prices.",Zyf0_HOcdFeTDRntrYOlRA,0,0,3,qbUXpTbKGNx63vC0nOXeJg

The staff was fantastic and made sure we always had a bottle of champagne and OJ through out the show. We went through 15 bottles!
I have never been to a drag show and have never watched RuPauls Drag Race but this was an absolute blast. The Queens were beautiful and put on a great show, I can't believe how well they dance in those outfits and heels! Don't be shy...there will be audience participation as well.

We were seated at our table and was greeted by our waitress 10 minutes later. We ordered our steak nachos and a bucket of beer. We waited for our beer to come out but about 10-15 minutes later the nachos came out. Nachos and no beer does not make me happy. About a minute later the assistant manager (I believe he was) asked us how we liked the nachos. We explained that we just got them but we had still not gotten our beers that we ordered at the start. Less than 5 minutes later we had our beer from that time.

Now on to the nachos. The nachos were just meh. The steak was not very flavorful and could taste that it was cheap meat. The nachos and bucket of beer cost us over $50.

Harbor"" which we thought, ok this is better. Upon sitting there, the gnats were so over-whelming, that everytime you open your mouth to take of a bite of this CRAPPY food, you also ate a few gnats along with it!!! It was simply disgusting, flying in your face and up your nose, just crawling in your ears.. HORRIBLE. I've lived in Vegas almost 7 years, and by far... the biggest DISAPPOINTMENT I have ever had the displeasure of eating at. My Gf and I are Chefs at hotels here, and this place was just sad. The only reason for the ""1"" star.. you get a cool view of the pirate show, which none on Senor Frogs staff members attempt to warn you of the fire and explosions 15 feet out the window, we had twin 8 month old babies with us...I have never Yelped before, but this place brought an urge on me to do so. Its a POOR ass Attempt at mexican food, actually a Disgrace to my culture and heritage... DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!",1M8Z2vfebMGq1GG_W4_XzQ,1,1,1,uUOuI1vIa5YgIGTuLMoB7Q

Well, I did because it was a) recommended by the bartender and b) expected more alcohol. I literally drank a whole thing of margarita mix with ""zero"" alcohol content. 

I really was not in the mood to argue with the seemingly busy bartender with only couple of patrons at the bar so I'll have to suck it up for not being outspoken about my unfulfilled needs. However, I could've used some loving when it came down to alcohol content.

Location is kind of off out of the way... all the way down at the Treasure Island hotel. But it's fine if you're in that Wynn/Venetian/TI area.  

If you want drinks and a spring break atmosphere, this is the place.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Yard frozen drinks, etc.

Get the $5 discount card from Tix4Less.  It entitled me to $25 off after ordering $50 of food. If not for that card, it definitely would be over priced for what you get.

That all could be forgiven if they actually handled the alcohol properly. I tried the yard, and it tasted metallic and not very strong.

My aunt won a flipping trip to Cancun!! Awesome place to celebrate. I had the chicken tacos for taco Tuesday and they were amazing! Mango margarita yards were 2 for 1. Music was loud but it's a bar! What do you expect!? Our waitress, Angie, was a crazy lady!!! But super fun.",nwTYGMddUDVhVGVW9BOOow,0,0,5,YFTOzBHzB-xRcBIC6b0BLA

For 3 girls we shared the nachos, and white queso dip and were absolutely stuffed! They were delicious and filling portions!  I would recommend for a quick simple no fuss meal on the strip (with a nice view!).",8kQnJFSUBoFEp_RGwdXFww,0,0,4,9ToK9809NK0xyKHLJ37tcg

Get outside, waiter ok, but guy who brought our food was rude when he threw it on the table.  Waiter never came back to check on us after the food was ordered!  Love this place in the Bahamas but not in Las Vegas... No fun here! Stick to Senor Frogs in the Caribbean ...",DT2rrnOzGmBSItlotPIIKg,1,2,2,lVfODXyFMfWzUyI1jCI2xQ

Once we were finally seated the waitress came over and took our drink order right away (good). 20 minutes later and we got to order our food. The food is the only reason this place even gets one star. It was very good! Not $18 for nachos good but good. Surprisingly. Place looks very run down as well. My friend got a refill on her water After the 4th time of trying to get the attention of our waitress. She only had 3 tables too. Come on now. Not worth the price or the time. Go to any other place on the strip. This place is terrible. I'll never go back or go to another senor frogs for that matter. 

Also while we were leaving a bouncer asked us if we had gotten our stamps to which we were like no we're not staying he asked why and we replied ""because the service was terrible"" at this point you would have thought he would have gotten a manager to resolve the issue before it left the restaurant ( which is the right thing to do ) instead we walked away while he stood, astonished and speechless",e_SL4IgHh-1f-YuVmlJNfA,3,0,1,MU5YOALjngjU5suZ26TXOw
