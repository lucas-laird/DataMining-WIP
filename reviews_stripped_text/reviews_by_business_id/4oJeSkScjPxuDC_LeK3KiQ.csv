746728,2015-06-29,0,4oJeSkScjPxuDC_LeK3KiQ,"The food was marginal (soggy fries, food lacked flavor). The server disappeared for what seemed like long periods of time. The band, ""garage boys"", played covers. They sounded okay and played upbeat songs and got the crowd going a bit. Then the band started making sexist, homophobic jokes and the jokes weren't even funny to top it off. They Sang to a woman who was there for her and her husbands anniversary and her birthday. In the middle of the song they added ""show is your boobs"" while the couple was dancing. Seemed like 40 year olds trying to be 20 again...lame.  I wish I had gotten a hot dog at the hot dog stand.",_WPabFDM_72iVBW3SV3aYA,0,0,2,H1LSrD6S0JrcucDshg-68Q
929132,2016-02-07,0,4oJeSkScjPxuDC_LeK3KiQ,"Wandered in on Friday night around 10 or 10:30 because the band in there was ROCKING it!! I approached the host who was leaning on her hand at the host stand and asked if it was open seating. She nodded so I went straight to a table right in front of the stage. I was about the go to the bar to order a drink, and maybe some fries or nachos but I noticed that all the tables around me had servers tending to them so eagerly awaited for one to approach. I sat there for about 4 songs and noticed that a table that seated itself behind me a few minutes after I'd sat down had a server tending to them. At this point I no longer had an appetite for food. But still wanted a beer. Servers kept walking right past me, attending to other tables, even empty ones with dirty dishes were getting plenty of attention, I was not. The band finished the set they were on, took a break, then got back on stage--still I was ignored. I began to wonder if perhaps I was invisible. But when a man at a table next to me (seated long after me, and was being attended to be a server) kept asking me if I wanted to dance, I thought, nope. I must not be invisible. Then finally, a server approached my table! I was about to order a beer, and was going to ask why no one had come to help me after about 30 minutes of me enjoying the music. She put a couple of silverware rolls on the table, looked right at me, then walked away. I stayed for a couple more songs and left. I was planning on spending the $20 I'd won at black jack at the D down the street on beer there that night. But I left completely sober and thirsty. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is becasue that band was so good I might just be back if they play there often. I guess I'll just have to bring my own beer.",a6H1ZSm8J1zZtzMz0cJAVA,0,1,2,fZnzLE8FizlxH8VxMzniow

The decor is very authentic of an Irish pub. Plenty of seats and tables available. We didn't have food but the grub that was coming out looked and smelt amazing. They have plenty of whiskeys on offer and even bottles of Harp!

Best thing about Hennesseys has to be the bar man Jeremy. He was so friendly and professional. Great craic!!! Loved him. The 2nd night we were here the band was really not the best, Jeremy more than made up for that. We stumbled out hours later very happy and very merry too!

Granted, my review is from St. Patrick's day so keep that in mind.  Although we visited at lunch time & it wasn't a madhouse.

The menu is extremely limited.  Not sure if that is normal or because it was a holiday.  Hard to find something to eat if you are picky (like my boyfriend).  He was not impressed with his chicken fingers, actually made him sick and run to the bathroom.  

The waitress was hard to track down.  Half of our visit was looking for her to refill our drinks, bring napkins or get the check.  

Might return, not sure.

Pricing was decent.  Place could use a good deep cleaning.",_MlLCLp-hv4sTsBDUKOyhQ,1,1,2,XKhRuBqjUyoYGTwRd9SZnw

The fries were that yucky grainy from-the-freezer variety. I think the fish was also from frozen. They were these little breaded fish pucks, four of them. So, yeah, likely from frozen.

The cocktail waitress was completely nonexistent and we had go to the bar order our drinks and then she brought them to our table. I could understand if they were busy there was literally 10 people in the bar. Waitress was too busy talking to her friends for 2 hours to come and take our drink order.

The food was bland with absolutely no taste. Ordered our burgers medium and they came out well done. The Parmesan encrusted sourdough just tastes like burnt cheese and the burgers have zero flavor to them. When the waitress finally came over to refill our waters, it was with warm water and no ice, and she never checked on us again until we cashed out. With all of the options on Fremont street, I'm bummed we chose this one. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. It would have been a different story if it was busy or if the waitress would have apologized.
