11292,2013-07-28,0,J7EUrh1q3lgENaoTrHZl_w,"I am a big fan of Bradley Ogden going back to his Lark Creek Inn in Larkspur, CA.  I loved his restaurant at Caesar's, until they started tinkering with the menu in its latter years. I had high hopes for his latest entry, especially since its in my neighborhood, and I'd love to see Tivoli Village get some traction. 
Having said that, I confess to being mildly disappointed when my wife and I stopped in for an early dinner a few weeks ago. Don't get me wrong...it wasn't bad, it was just far from great.  
We got there at 5:30 and Happy Hour was ""in play"" so we ordered from both the HH menu and the ala carte menu.  For starters we had the fried polenta cubes (nothing special...bland, little seasoning, do not recommend at all) and the grilled cheese bites. This turned out to be an unremarkable grilled cheese sandwich cut into eight pieces and plopped on a plate. We had the skirt steak and fish&chips for main courses. The skirt steak was well seasoned, but a little tougher than I was expecting. As there was no steak knife accompanying this dish, I was left to tearing apart the steak with a fork and un-serrated utility knife. 
On the other hand, the fish and chips were outrageously delicious, and worth a return trip solely on the merits of this dish. 
Happy Hour pricing is very friendly with $3 beers and &4-$5 apps.  The ala carte menu is not quite as value driven, especially the beverage side with beers ranging from $6-$10 ($6 for a PBR...really, a PBR!?!).  Anyway, like I said, we'll be back for the fish&chips but will likely show up during Happy Hour.",kUbr62cPuM1io42-G6Of9Q,1,0,3,Lgs_YhoVJgOPiUIyp8z2uA

I shared the Bibb Lettuce Salad which was lightly dressed and the goat cheese crepe was tasty. Also split the Short Rib Patty Melt, it was perfectly melty and delicious and the short ribs were moist and delicious. The food was a 5 for sure however the setting is where this place lacks. The 6 tables up front at reception area are terrible, no one would want to sit there and the tables inside the dining area are much too small for the food to sit on let alone to try and conduct any business. We were the first people to arrive at 11:30a when they opened and they seemed a bit scrambled to get us seated. By twelve they were fairly busy and our service slowed a bit but was still acceptable. I will probably return here as the food was very good if not a tad over priced.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,0,0,4,B49QVC274c5UZ8Z8Ct1pXg

161544,2013-06-28,4,J7EUrh1q3lgENaoTrHZl_w,"Located in the former Bottles & Burgers space, Hops utilized the same restaurant, bar and kitchen layout for its new venue, but added a few finishes to make it a tiny bit nicer than it was before. Unfortunately the hostesses still have some training to do, as they had a horrible time of trying to explain their seating options to us. Coming in on a Monday night at 6:30pm we didn't bother making a reservation, but were greeted with a 10 minute wait for a booth, the option to sit outside on their side patio with misters, or to sit right away in their back lounge. Without thinking twice we chose the back lounge, only to be brought outside to a desolate back patio area with very minimal mister coverage and one employee sitting on a laptop. After well more than a 5 minute wait and a bit of sweat in the 95 degree weather two waiters came out at the same time to finally set our table and bring out menus. We promptly expressed our frustration with the location and were brought inside to an empty booth near the back... a booth that was located right by the loudest party of people ever assembled in a restaurant. So loud in fact, that we didn't realize there was background music playing in the restaurant until after the group had left. I will note that our server Diana was very attentive, funny and super nice.

Seating woes and noise problems aside, we're here to discuss food. Both the lunch and dinner menus offer a variety of clever sounding small plates and starters, sandwiches, salads and main courses. Being a lover of pork belly, we tried the Spicy BBQ Pork Belly before our burgers came out; they weren't really spicy, but had a sweet, not so great bbq sauce on them. The pork itself was chewy and not cooked all that well, and the cheddar-ale dipping sauce didn't have much flavor either. My friends had this same dish a few days earlier and thought their pork belly was crispy and delicious. Apparently the restaurant inconsistency never seems to work in my favor.

As for their 'famous' burger, the Grilled H&H burger, it is more or less served as just meat and bun. The bun is a house made bun; almost biscuit-like with a slight smell of brioche, while the meat is supposedly a house-ground chuck blend. The bun was good; a bit crispy on the inside, fresh but a tiny bit more dry than I would have liked. It was also a bit larger than my patty so the ratio is a little off. The patty was quite good; it had a great beefy flavor that did hold up on its own with just the bun, but was cooked a little more than the medium rare I had ordered. I added provolone cheese, and it seemed plentiful, but didn't really represent at all in the few flavors. Overall the burger is really good, but just not stand-out great. A few minimal, really good flavors don't necessarily come together to make a fantastic burger, and this is a perfect example to me. This kind of reminds me of my first experience at Honey Salt; everything about the burger was good but it just didn't stand out as having anything special going on. They regrouped, seasoned their patty, changed the bun, added some toppings and now offer something excellent. While I wasn't totally impressed with Ogden's burger at Caesar's, I got what he was doing there; unfortunately I don't think it works here anymore. I think it's time to ditch this simplistic approach, add some creativity and come up with something truly special.

The hand cut fries were no good either; hot and very fresh, but seasoned with not quite enough salt on them, and too oily with that lovely flavor that the oil should have been changed yesterday. They instantly made me yearn for the fries I had at his hold location as they were far superior. Why can't they replicate those? Given this experience, I'd rather go across the way to View to have their fan favorite burger and fries than this one. Also this burger jumps from $13.50 for lunch to $15 during dinner for presumably the same thing. Comparing the two menus, it appears that several other items make a similar jump as well. Plenty of restaurants throughout the city do this, I'm just not a fan. Regardless of which price you're going for, there are better and cheaper burger options very close by at Fleming's, View or Honey Salt. I'm sure my opinion on this will be debated by the ass-kissers and hype-mongers in town, but that's what they're good for these days.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,2,2,YqjlH53U5PvWrvweBgNxxg
237547,2013-06-05,1,J7EUrh1q3lgENaoTrHZl_w,"First I hope the the owners look at some of these reviews and take in what is said. 
1- the atmosphere is like a BAR not a fine dinning experience
2- even though you think your in SUMMERLIN your not less than 1/2 mile away lives common folk, and they will make you more money than you think
3- the staff uniform remind me of a service department at a car lot

OK enough of the hurt, the $45 steak is great very tender seasoned very nicely we also tried the salmon very very good but still over priced. The grilled cheese was very good. The chocolate cake was ok but again not worth the money ""dry"" .  The Mac & cheese was good but no depth, if your ever in Anahiem California try Woods Ranch Resturant there Mac & cheese is awesome. Overall not to exciting, sorry guys we won't be back with the pricing you have. 
Last thing your hostess Raylnns personality is not suited for that environment, she walked around giving everybody strange looks and didn't smile once.

Good luck and I hope you make the changes",f2V1rJG28lmpIiYzJyUFOQ,1,0,2,WdRmPLnSmvA3qDRVIKz5Hg
461046,2013-07-12,3,J7EUrh1q3lgENaoTrHZl_w,"I was so looking forward to Ogden's new restaurant after years of enjoying his old place at Caesar's. The burger there was one of the best I've ever had, and for once I was ahead of a trend- I've been ordering burgers at steak houses forever, because that used to be the only place you could get a high quality hamburger.


I loved everything at the CP location- the food, wine list, service and ambience. Every trip for the last several years, I've sat at the bar and had that sublime prix fixe burger and a bottle of wine- sometimes on more than one night.


John Curtis, one of the trio of authors of the annual ""Eating Las Vegas"" (a wonderful guide if you go to Vegas with any regularity) has just written a review of H&H and called it 'the best food suburban Las Vegas has ever seen"". I usually find their reviews to be spot on.


In any case, H&H is a much more casual space and everything about it is was just awful. Our server was manically cheerful, and the food sucked. As in, I can't remember the last time I had such a bad meal.


The complimentary blue corn muffins (which I had to ask for and wouldn't have known about except from the review) tasted like sawdust. We started with the Maytag Bleu cheese soufflés and they had no flavor. Followed with a Bibb lettuce salad that was so over-salted it was inedible. 

By this point, not only was I starving- but I figured at least the burger would redeem this meal. The server messed up our order and only brought out one burger, so in the meantime dropped off a passable pork belly app, took back the one burger and came back with 2 freshly cooked burgers. Wow, again so freakishly over-salted that we both could only take a couple of bites.


I asked the server for iced tea (we'd finished our bottle of wine and needed something to get the salt-lick taste out of our mouths) and she said that the tea ""didn't come out so well today"". She was right, it was really weak. Excuse me, but it is 105 degrees out and 9 pm and no one could make a fresh batch of tea at some point during the evening?


Obviously, we skipped dessert so I don't know if the butterscotch pudding and Snickerdoodle cookies survived the transition.

 
I asked when we first arrived if Bryan (Bradley's son) was cooking that night and the hostess told me he was on vacation. I realize this spot has only been open 8 weeks or so, but seasoning food is pretty basic stuff- as is making tea. 

The 2 separate incidents of the clatter of trays of breaking dishes in an hour and a half, hostess over-sharing, server not asking why we weren't eating our food, etc. are all things one could expect in a new spot. But food this wretched is just unforgiveable by 2 chefs like the Ogdens.


At least we were able to drive out there, because if I had spent the money on a cab I would have been pissed. Instead, just disappointed and $150 poorer.",jX1qYFyrIuWtyFQgVkKrMQ,4,1,1,IrDUZb5yt_LCjSQzHxIwng
551166,2013-06-09,0,J7EUrh1q3lgENaoTrHZl_w,"First off I would like to thank previous Yelp reviews for letting me know to order the grilled cheese bites, they were delicious!  First off, it's a really good grilled cheese sandwich, but then they put a little dijon mustard in there to give it a kick and it was sprinkled with lemon and lime rind which gave it a nice little bit of acidity to go with the richness of the cheese.  And the tomato sauce they served on the side for dipping was ridiculously tasty, and went perfectly with the bites.  There was a little of it left over, but not for long as my friends and I used the bread on the table to finish it off.

For my main, I had the pulled short rib patty melt, and it was sinful.  Slow cooked and pulled short rib meat, sauteed onion, gruyere cheese, and Bradley Ogden sauce inside crunchy bread (rye I think).  It came with fries just like I ordered them, crispy.  I hate limp french fries.  The sandwich was literally OMG tasty, my friends both tried it and said it was the best out of our 3 lunch choices.  Bradley Ogden even came by our table, and when he saw what I had, proceeded to tell me he had the same thing for breakfast this morning.  I would go back here just for this sandwich, no joke.

The beer list is also really good, and stocked primarily with beers out of Nevada and California.  I was super excited when I found out the had Old Rasputin on tab, but then immediately got sad when told they had just poured the last pint.  So other than needing to get their keg ordering straightened out, I was pretty happy with the selection.

Service was fine, nothing special.  Our waitress was super friendly and got all of our orders right, and remembered to bring the water pitcher around whenever we needed it.  On the whole, while it's a bit pricey, it's totally worth the money, unlike a bunch of other places in Tivoli Village.",0D5WAgaOM1M00t3KIEf_Fw,3,2,4,RkN_UmFQVX30GKNX_sWtTQ

728868,2013-06-27,0,J7EUrh1q3lgENaoTrHZl_w,"After reading some of the reviews, I have to say I strongly disagree. I still do not understand why people come in thinking it is  fine dining restaurant and walk away disappointed. It's called Hops & Harvest meaning beers, and Bradley's farm to table idea which could be brought in any format. I have been there 3 times since they opened, and this last time I was super happy with everything that came out of that kitchen. Our server Jackson was very nice, and very happy to be at work, always makes it a better dining experience. I came with two of my friends for brunch, and we started the cocktails early. My friend ordered the Harvest Shandy which she ended up enjoying and ordering another. I had the Tivoli Tea, after the first sip, just my kind of cocktail, it was very good. it just took the bartender a while to get them to our table. 

We started with the heirloom tomato salad, summer vegetable hash, and some pastries. The heirloom salad was perfectly dressed, the plating not the greatest, but all three of us wiped the plate clean wanting more, the summer vegetable hash was great, I especially love the egg on top, it was the cherry on top of the wonderful hash. The blue corn muffins were awesome!

For entrees we ordered the Steak and Potato, the BLT, and the Lemon Ricotta Griddle Cakes. The steak was a skirt steak, probably the best tasting steak I've had in a minute the fries a tad bit greasy. Not your usual BLT it was served in their house made bun, which was not expected, but surprisingly delicious!!! I'm not the biggest fan of pancakes, but these just made me want to change my mind, I wasn't able to get much ricotta anywhere, not that it really has a big flavor, but maybe it was more of a texture thing, I do wish it would have had a touch more of lemon zest, the honey lavender almonds were just great, although I do wish there were more peaches on top. 

Everything we had was very good, and I was so excited that both my friends were very  happy with everything we ordered. The drive is a little far for me but totally worth it. I strongly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking for some good, casual food, still my two favorites over all are the grilled cheese bites, and the butterscotch pudding (to die for).",lerZc5wx9j5eQICt7mdS0Q,2,1,5,e8ON0lz8RL6h9_jT5jXO2A

992615,2013-08-27,0,J7EUrh1q3lgENaoTrHZl_w,"I made reservations via opentable, 7:00 was booked so I chose 7:30. When we arrived about 15 minutes early we were seated right away. There was only one other table dining at the time. A bit odd, but our server was bubbly and friendly. She warned us that several beers were out. My choice, Summerfest, was no issue, but the husband wanted an IPA. All out. Four varieties. Also, out of his next two picks. Summerfest, it is.

Our server was very apologetic and mentioned that keg orders won't come in until the new month. My husband has watched enough Bar Rescue's he pressed the issue; asking about keeping inventory at par. She had no idea. Hopefully, management can get it together, a place with Hops in the name should have kegs on hand at all times. Customers like to drink hoppy beer at the end of the month too. My husband used the restroom and they were out of paper towels as well. They must be coming in with the kegs.

The restaurant week menu is three courses for $40.13

We got started with the Blue Cheese Souffle and Corn soup with shrimp. I liked the roasted fennel and fruit salad that accompanied the soufflé, but the soufflé itself seemed to be lacking something. A crunchy salty crust would've been nice. The soup was served room temperature. I don't know if that was intentional. It had nice flavor from the sweet corn and the shrimp were grilled to perfection.

For the main course, my husband chose the steak (medium rare) and potatoes, and I had the roasted halibut with medley of vegetables. The fish was good, nice prepared and seasoned. I liked the vegetables, but not the chickpeas. They were too bland. The potatoes that came with the steak were French fries. The steak had good flavor, but it was inedible because it was so chewy. I've never encountered anything like it. We had it removed from our bill. They offered something else from the menu, but he had lost his appetite. 

Dessert was Butterscotch Pudding and Devil's Food Cake with walnuts and vanilla ice cream. I was a bit nervous to order the pudding fearful that it would be overly sweet, but it was a pleasant surprise. It was creamy with a well balanced butterscotch flavor. The cake was pretty good with ice cream, but the pudding was the better dish.

Writing this I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars. It had the potential to go right, but it just didn't. I'd expect more from a restaurant with a chef of this caliber. Pretty plates isn't enough in Sin City. There is just too much competition.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,2,3,Hj-ytNXGSr5PANAvdup8jA

She started with:

Sierra Nevada Summerfest ( $6) hers
Great Basin Icky IPA ( $6) mine

both very refreshing

Short Rib Nachos ( $9.50 )
Crispy Polenta bites ( $7.50)
Blue Cheese Souffle ( $12)

grilled Cheese bites ( $9??)

The nachos fell short - we digged the ingredients - potato chips, cheddar cheese, short rib with horseradish sour cream.  The problem - some of the chips were stale, the cheese with the short ribs created a consistency of beef stroganoff - not a bad taste but not what I wanted.  and the serving size  - seriously ?!

The polenta bites - loved the green goddess dip ( fresh tarragon taste ) but the bites were too dang small !  Why not put blue cheese inside them - seems like you put blue cheese on most the items on the menu ( and yes, I love blue cheese ) 

Blue cheese soufflé - I liked my mini soufflé, the gf felt the need for a  greater blue cheese taste. we'll agree to disagree.

Grilled cheese bites is basically a grilled cheese sammie cut into squares - we both loved the flavor.

Little did I know she was just warming up.

Heirloom tomato salad ( $7.50 )
Crispy chicken sliders ( $9.50 ) 
H&H Burger ($15) 

Big Dog, Dirty Dog IPA ( $7 ) for me

Salad - excellent flavor but literally four bites.

Crispy Chicken sliders - nice crunch, decent flavor, the buttermilk ranch had ... blue cheese ! ok by me.

H&H Burger - had them split in 1/2.  Great flavor ! but where's the ... CHEESE ?!? The fries were wimpy,limpy - why ? 

and if that wasn't enough

Mac n cheese ( $7)

Butterscotch pudding with crème fraiche and snickerdoodle cookies

the mac n cheese - can we put this in the oven to get a crusty top and given the cheese to blend in with the macaroni ?  I guess not

The pudding - gf choice - I don't like butterscotch - though I did try a bite, not bad;  she loved it.. We both loved the cookies.

I left the place with a similar feeling I had at Nosh & swig.  I like the concept, I like what I read on the menu ( sans price ) but the dishes were inconsistent and generally speaking, improper execution.

I will definitely consider another visit during happy hour, otherwise, been there, done that.

Yeah, I admit I was palette pumped, but I still like to think I kept my expectations in check and on low key for fear of disappointment .

I couldn't remember if the decor had changed much since its Bottles and Burgers, Beer and Burgers, or whatever the heck that place was called before; which I had only been to once before, right before it closed.  The surroundings and atmosphere are banal and ho-hum dull, but the tin ceiling is nice and I could move on, after all it's a farm to table venue, ""but as I sat there watching, I had the feeling that something was missing...and it was  .""

We did a lunch/happy hour hybrid.

""Let's break out the booze:""

Noam's Punch / Pusser's Rum, Amaretto, St. Germain
Firestone Walker, Pivo Pils 
Great Basin, Icky / IPA 
Sierra Nevada, Summerfest

Because our first round languished at the bar, The Noam's Punch glass was drenched in tears, like the forgotten foster child that it was, but tasty nonetheless.  All the draft beers and wines are half price for HH, so ""lets keep dancing.""


Pre-lunch pickie:

Grilled cheese bites with tomato herb sauce
Maybe clowns, elephants and dancing bears would have helped.

""I'm not ready for that final disappointment ""

Short Rib Patty Melt / provolone & gruyere, onion, ""fancy sauce""  
Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich / crispy bacon, roasted pepper, bibb lettuce, basil mayo.

Well, ready or not here it is,  overwhelming drenched in mediocrity and tasteless calories.

A lot of 70's Elton John crooning in the background, but it didn't replace the Peggy Lee tune ""Is That All There Is"" that kept playing over and over in my head and on my palette.

It's pretty awkward inside.  When you walk in the doors, there are about 4-6 tables and then a random side table where the hostess is.  I also noticed a weird smell right when I walked in the door.  Almost like a raw seafood smell, like when the store cleans out their bins for the night.  It was a little bizarre.

Once you get past the entry, there is a bar on the left side, some tables on the right side, another bar area and a back room.

We were able to get a table for 4 on Friday night at 7pm without reservations.  It's very echo-y in that back room and at one point the music was turned up very loud, it was hard to hear the person sitting next to me.

The service was good and the wait staff was very nice.

We ordered some wine and beers and settled in with our main courses:

1. Spicy BBQ Pork Belly / cheddar-ale dipping sauce | $11.00
*Husband ordered this ans said it was delicious!  Loved everything about it.

2. Sweet Corn Soup / grilled shrimp, pine nuts, Diane's basil | $10.00
*Husband also ordered this and said it's the best soup he's ever had.  The flavors all flowed together nicely and the corn was sweet.

3. Beer Battered Fish & Chips / Bradley's tartar sauce | $14.75
*I ordered this and the fish was light and flaky.  The fries were crispy and the tartar sauce is one of my all time favorites.  It wasn't your typical ""cheap"" tasting tartar sauce.  It has nice flavors.  Not sure how else to explain it- haha!

4. ""Steak and Potato"" / grilled skirt steak, hand-cut fries, red wine-herb butter | $22.00
*Both of our friends ordered this dish.  One said the steak was extremely salty while the other said it tasted perfect.  One steak was much bigger than the other.  (it almost looked like there were two skirt steaks on one plate!)

For Dessert:

5. Bradley's Butterscotch Pudding / snicker doodle cookies | $9.00
*Very good!  The snicker doodle cookies were nice and soft.  The butterscotch had really nice flavor and texture.

6. Seasonal Sorbets | $9.00
*Our friend had the mango and raspberry flavors and said they were both really good!

Note: for the gluten free people- their salads usually can be done gluten free, but that's about it.

He recommended the bleu cheese souffle and he did not steer us wrong.  It was excellent!  However, the bibb lettuce salad was bland and the short rib nachos were a bad idea as well.  The nachos are supposed to have horseradish on them, but I couldn't taste it.  Bland, bland, bland.  The polenta bites were ok.  Kind of earthy.  I used the green goddess dressing that came with the polenta bites to spice up the bibb lettuce salad.

The desserts were to die for, though.  The butterscotch pudding and the strawberry shortcake - both divine!  

The beer selection was a little lacking, especially for a place that has ""hops"" in the name.  But they do serve each beer in the appropriate glass so I'll give them props for that.

I only made it to the previous restaurant in this space, Bottles & Burgers, once.  But I don't remember the space being so awkward.  The entryway had no shades and was blazing hot in the summer.  It was a large, round room with tables and we were unclear whether we accidentally came in a back door until the hostess approached us (as she tried to stay out of the direct sunlight). Also, the women's bathroom was so small and the diaper changing table location blocked the doors to the stalls.  Very embarrassing when I was trying to change my daughter.  Finally, we had to play chicken with the people coming into the valet at breakneck speed to even get there.  

I hope they do a redesign of the restaurant.  The staff were nice with friendly efficient service.  I definitely like the concept and the chef.  Just stick to the items that he specialized in at his namesake restaurant (now closed), like the burger, souffle, and butterscotch pudding, and you'll be pleased.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,2,2,4,3EvFEPYctTufWg48tRV60A

There is very little difference between this restaurant and the burger joint from before. The menu is similar except they added a steak and a fish item and the decor is almost identical.

The food was fine but really nothing special. The servers were trying very hard, which we appreciated however they lacked the training of a proper service. 

Food: pork belly appetizer was good but too salty. Corn soup tasted like a sauce and lacked any real depth. Mac n cheese was pretty good. Crab cake sliders were drowning in tartar sauce (even though we told our server to leave it off).  I get that it Ogden's signature sauce but uts not tgat interesting, especially if you don't like tartar sauce to begin with.

Secondly, a business lunch with donors who had come from the Strip to try Chef Ogden's latest eatery: the highlight of my meal was the blue cheese in the salad. My fellow diners were underwhelmed with their choices as well except for the grilled cheese, which was apparently amazing but also hard to f up; but this is Bradley Ogden of well, Bradley Ogden where many fabulous meals were enjoyed, so... 

Deciding I'd give it one more shot - especially since I'd not yet had the signature Maytag blue cheese soufflé - and again, was disappointed by a dish I'd loved at Chef's previous eponymous Caesar's locale. The inevitable breakup. It's not me, it's you. There's the fact that it still looks like Bottles & Burgers inside (for real) and I keep expecting the servers to ask to check my oil because of the weird uniforms.

Service was EXCELLENT. Our server, Jessica, was great. I'd highly recommend you ask for her if you come here. She was attentive, friendly and just great.
Reservation was for 11 but 14 showed up and they got another table and chairs SUPER quick!
GM came over at the end of the meal to see if we enjoyed the food.
Drinks were pretty good. I had the watermelon cream, which was OK, and the Shandy which I asked for Grand Marnier instead of Contreau ( Jessica was awesome making sure this request was accommodated), was delicious. It had a piece of lime that was dredged in cinnamon, so not only did it taste fabulous, it smelled heavenly!

CONS :(
Overpriced IMO. 
A ""sweet corn soup"" was $12. Wouldnt be bad if 1. the corn was actually sweet, and 2. it had more shrimp. If you advertise that shrimp is in the dish, let there be shrimp. 2 TINY pieces is pretty lame, if you ask me.
The garlic mashed potatoes needed salt, although they were tasty. If you dont season your potatoes, they just dont taste as good as they should.
The grilled cheese was OK, but not spectacular. The size/price point is OK, but I was definitely 
I know this is silly, but I have to....they make the servers provide their own pens. Very weird, but true!

I'd definitely come back and try some other stuff. The fish and chips look delicious. The summer veggie hash tasted pretty damn good to me! I didn't care for the grilled artichoke at all. Maybe because I usually eat artichokes stuffed. I also didn't care for the dill cornbread. Not only did it look offensive, I didn't care for the taste one bit. Took a bite and didn't even finish it.  I know they offer HH specials and I think I'd rate this 4 star if I came for that.

3517681,2013-06-20,5,J7EUrh1q3lgENaoTrHZl_w,"When it comes to fine dining restaurants Las Vegas can compete with any city. But, what the city lacks (with the exception of Chinatown/Spring Mountain Rd.) is casual, moderately-priced dining spots with excellent food. Hops and Harvest fills that void with Bradley and Bryan Ogden's farm to table concept. 

The James Beard award winning chef and his son have created a menu full of comfort food with inspired and creative touches like the goat cheese stuffed crepe in the bibb lettuce salad and brought back  items from their former restaurant in Caesars Palace like the blue corn muffins and the Maytag bleu cheese souffle.

The short rib nachos are one of my favorite dishes with its great salty and savory flavors. The potato chips do tend to get a little soggy with the sauce  covering them, but the combo of ingredients are so good that the dish won't last long. The pork belly bites are another hit with its sweet and spicy BBQ sauce and cheddar ale sauce. I've tried both the tuna sliders and the crispy chicken sliders and wasn't disappointed either time. The heirloom tomatoes may be a small dish but the combo of tomatoes and bleu cheese was excellent.

The bone-in prime rib eye was slightly overcooked but the seasoning and the zinfandel shallot sauce made up for it. I rarely order meatloaf, but the bacon wrapped version here was good enough to make me want to order it again. I've also tried the crab cake dish, which was pretty good, but the star of that dish was the carrot-fennel slaw. It was so good they should offer that up as one of their sides on the menu.

The butterscotch pudding and the cinnamon sugar donut holes were both good. Each one is large enough for two people to share.

There were only a couple things I wasn't crazy about. The blue corn muffins could have used more salt or something and the polenta bites were bland.

Our server, Jessica, was amazing. Each time I've been back I made a point to request a table in her section.

I had explained that I was there with a reservation and he mentioned that the rest of my party hadn't arrived yet and he said they were still getting a couple things ready to open for the day so he gave me a lunch menu to look over. 

I have to say the inside looks like a gas station or farmhouse. With the decor, I would expect to find BBQ type food on the menu. Since Hops and Harvest is a farm-to-table concept, maybe they thought the decor and menu would mesh but it doesn't seem a fit to me. There are some awesome happy hour specials from 3-6pm daily. There is a bar and beer, cocktails, and wine are on the menu. The tables are very spacious. We were sat at a booth and the table was so long! You could easily fit 6 or 8 people in just one booth. There is also a patio outside with tables if you prefer to dine there. 

I was sad to see the salad I saw on yelp wasn't on the lunch menu. I asked our server about it and she said it was on the dinner menu but that she would check if it could be made for lunch and I was in luck. I ordered the ""Heirloom Tomato"" priced at $8.50 and was pretty shocked when it came to the table. It was tiny! The plate is way too big for the amount of food being put on it. That being said, it was so good! The tomatoes were fresh and delicious, the blue cheese really paired well with them. I would have gladly paid more to have a bigger portion. I noticed that during happy hour you can currently get this same salad for $4.50 and given the size, that price would be more appropriate and I would for sure order the heirloom tomato again. My friends ordered the ""Grilled Cheese Bites"" and I sampled just a taste. It was good! I saw several things on the menu that looked appetizing so I will be back to check it out.

With an envious location and a pleasing architectural design, it's the kind of place where you just know you will want to go - except for the fact that just about everything there is a serious disappointment. 

Ogden's Hops and Harvest is the latest attempt to occupy one of the four pillars of the Tivoli Village's main square. I do not claim to be an expert on the comings and goings of restaurants within Tivoli Village, but as an outside observer it still looks more than half empty and it's already had more than its share of failed eating establishments.

Approaching the front door, one feels overly enthusiastic. The layout of Tivoli is warm and inviting and just about every location within the Village has an entrance that, well just feels right. Your enthusiasm quickly fades when you enter the main floor as you start to wonder what the architect of this layout was thinking. Walk toward the back and you will find a bar whose position and design defies all sense of logic: there's a whole side of the bar that pins you in a corner - how uncomfortable. I never gave the second floor a look, but I have to hope it must be better than this.

The staff was delightfully pleasant and the bartender had a whit that could charm the feathers off a peacock. These factors alone could make Ogdens good enough to revisit - that is if you are not planning on eating anything. 

I know I am probably someone who completely fails to appreciate haute, so take that into consideration before judging the next few paragraphs.

I simply do not get the menu - which is probably the easiest way to explain it. Just one small page of items from appetizers to dessert which I can only assume is some type of artistic statement by the chef. The problem is none of it seems to make any sense, at least not to me. I am certain there is some section of society that will find this kind of haute simplicity appealing, I just don't know if there are enough of them to keep a place like this in business. It was Friday night and no one was knocking down the door to get in, so I may just be right about that.

Interestingly enough, the food itself was both a disaster and a success, which makes the whole concept of this restaurant even more confusing. The seemingly signature Oggie's Doggie was nearly indigestible and could easily ruin your appetite, whereas the Crispy Polenta Bites were a surprising delight, an interesting and unique dish. 

As with any review, this is bound to upset a few of those interesting people who simply love this type of haute cuisine (and quite possibly the chef himself), but over-all I came away feeling Ogden's Hops and Harvest is not going to make Tivoli Village the kind of place everyone hopes it will become.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,3,3,2,9eOA8RQExEILv90w4u_l_A

Mains:
BLT - asked for the basil aioli on the side, which was the only sauce listed on the menu. It did come on the side but the lettuce was drizzled with something that looked like russian dressing, so we sent it back to get it dry as ordered. The bread was good but not a lot of bacon and the tomato overpowered everything so we wouldn't order it again. 

Starters:
Blue Corn Cakes (complimentary) - delicious and super moist.

Crispy Chicken Sliders - this was good but again asked for the buttermilk ranch on the side which was the only sauce listed in the menu but the arugula was dressed with some sort of vinaigrette. The waitress said there was nothing on it, but after we pointed it out to her she said she didn't know. We ate it anyway and might order it again.

Grilled Cheese Bites - the best thing we ordered! It was simple but tasted so good. Would definitely order again. It might be the only reason we come back to try their happy hour.

Spicy BBQ Pork Belly - the waitress described it as crispy and not very spicy, however it was the exact opposite. Really fatty pieces of pork belly soft with hardly any meat and extremely spicy. No one at the table would eat it so we sent it back.

Sides:
Mac & Cheese - not very cheesy. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Wouldn't order again.

Dressings/Sauces:
Buttermilk ranch - pretty good, but an average house made dressing.

Bacon mustard - amazing! I would order something just to put that on it. 

Beer cheese - did not taste that much like beer or cheese.

Basil aioli - really good with lots of basil flavor.

Drinks:
Watermelon Cream - absolutely disgusting, it tasted like dirt. No one would drink it so we sent it back. People at other tables who ordered it didn't drink it either. It probably wasn't a good sign that when watching them make it they had to dump it out the first time and re-do it. My guess is no one on staff knew how to make it. 

The waitress didn't quite know how to handle a lot of the screw ups that were going on and also didn't seem to know the menu. The manager did come over and apologize and they didn't charge us for anything we sent back.

The entrance is a bit odd because you walk through a dining area to get to the hostess stand - it makes it seem as though you accidentally came in through the back door! It's definitely a better layout than the previous restaurant in the space - more secluded booths so that it doesn't just feel like a big empty space the way it did before.

I was pretty impressed with the food! Thanks to prior yelpers, we knew to order the grilled cheese bites. Wow, wow, wow. The grilled cheese has grated lemon peel in it which gives it a delicious zest, and it comes with an awesome tomato-mustard dipping sauce. We were literally eating the sauce with a knife once we finished the grilled cheese. We also tried the burger, short rib patty melt, and fried chicken salad. The burger was really good, but was just a burger (I probably wouldn't do it again). The patty melt was amazing. Crispy fried bread, cheesy, plenty of juicy short rib meat...yum. The salad was the weakest. The fried chicken was actually really good because it was very lightly breaded, but the dressing on the salad (supposed to be buttermilk dressing) had way too much egg/oil to buttermilk ratio, so it tasted more like mayonnaise than a dressing. For dessert, the devils food cake was light and fluffy and delicious, and the sorbets (mango and raspberry) were really good.

Bradley Ogden was walking around the restaurant and stopped by our table a few times. He said he had eaten the short rib melt for breakfast! Then he shook all of our hands on the way out. Definitely a nice touch as he gets this restaurant going. The kinks are still getting worked out - our entrees didn't come out at the same time - but we were all very happy!",C2RTNSaPYu_TKvpHxN41YQ,1,0,4,ynMRl4TeL_vv2sW7bqVJow

The one thing I don't like is how we're sat without being given a menu by the hostess.  We sat there looking around until the server brought the menu to us.  Both visits I had the grilled cheese, but I kept the butter from the bread and layered another butter layer on top of the grilled cheese and yum!  The tomato side is alright but if it came with tomato soup, it'd be heavenly.  

They were sold out of grilled artichokes both visit.

The meatloaf to me wasn't impressive, it sounded good being that it was wrapped in bacon but I'm not sure if it was undercooked or the simple ketchup smear over the top ruined it.  My mashed potato seemed to be made fresh cause I had chunks, even half a potato inside.  Mash mash mash more please.  My second visit entree was the steak and potato, that was simple and good but it cost over $22.  

I've had the strawberry shortcake and chocolate devil's food cake.  I prefer the chocolate dish over the strawberry shortcake.  The cake was almost as hard as the plate.

They were out of several drinks I really wanted but I settled for the Lips of Faith beer which was great tasting.  I ordered it on my second visit and will probably order it again after that.

First of all, the chef is Bradley Ogden, so you know you're getting spruced up, fresh American food with quality ingredients hat tastes good. We only sampled appetizers and the happy hour menu: mac and cheese, grilled artichoke, chicken sliders, grilled cheese, and fried polenta bites. The grilled cheese was as good as grilled cheese can get, served with a creamy tomato dipping sauce, and we also loved the macaroni. The artichoke and sliders were solid, but not outstanding, and I wasn't a fan of the polenta. It was well prepared, i just didn't really like the taste of cinnamon (or something) that was in there. 
The really good thing about this restaurant is the beer list. There were about 15 selections on tap with nary a bud light to be found! Choices included Full Sail, MOA, Lips of Faith, and some other keepers. I didn't even have to look to their bottle selections, which I'm sure are also excellent. 
The drawback of Ogden's celebrity status is that everything is a little overpriced...EXCEPT during their awesome happy hour! Half off draft beer and wine and a selection of apps for $3-5 everyday from 3-6 aaaand you can enjoy happy hour anywhere in the restaurant! Even with your kids!

The Chef Bradley Ogden who is great at transforming traditional american food into an amazing sensation has done it again in my opinion.  Not only does it have a great american food appeal but a bit of a twist to everything to appeal to all food or foodie  types.  

We were greeted and seated at a booth in the back away from the action.  Started to look over the menu got our drinks and the manger came over to ask if we needed anything.  I thought it was great service on top of the great service we had already received.  As we ponder the menu we really came to a point of ""wow it all looks good and what the heck do we order?!  We decided to do family style for 3.  The waitress helped us in our selections and told us about each dish to help our decision.

Our apps for the table included Seared Tuna Sliders they set a great tone for the whole meal.  Great...
Maytag Blue Cheese Souffle/ I could have possibly eaten the whole plate! OMG good The soft but rich flavors of the cheese melted in my mouth, I so wanna go back for this ALONE!
Spicy BBQ Pork Belly It was great moist and delish!
My next choice was a Caesar Salad something this chef is known for and now I know why.  It was the creamiest blend with a mix of things I remembered.  I ate this salad like there was no tomorrow it was probably the best salad I have ever had...

We went here over the weekend while we were hanging out at Tivioli Village for the Harvest Festival.  The mail was packed, but Ogden's was empty.  There were only 2 other tables in the entire place.  It's always a little odd to eat in an empty restaurant.  

We tried the fish & chips and the chili with cornbread.  Both items were good, but only good.  At $17 for fish & chips seemed really high.  The chili and bread was $6, which I thought was a great deal.  I have had better rich & chips at other places and for much less moolah.  

The servers tare all very friendly.  We had my 2 year old wit us, so she attracted all of the ladies working, which she loved.  Our drinks were never empty, which is always a bonus.  Our server checked on us regularly as well.

If you are into beer, Ogden's had a great beer list with a lot of the smaller regional breweries from the West Coast.

Plus, the last couple times I went to the bar, I noticed a really terrible smell.  Huge space in a big, high-end shopping development, and the restaurant stinks.  Over the years, I've loved some dives for their stench, it's part of the package or overall experience.  But at a place as sterile and pristine as Tivoli Village (an Italian village that looks like it's been plopped down in the desert by aliens), bad odors are out of place and totally unacceptable.  Write your own jokes about the aliens who developed this spot and plays on Bradley Ogen's initials (BO).  

Add to that that service is stilted for a place that's trying to cultivate a ""fun"" vibe.  I've been to places that have elevated food in a playful or at least relaxed atmosphere, where they pull off that delicate balance.  OH&H misses the mark.  It must be a challenge to attract quality staff to the suburbs when there are so many great opportunities for good people on the strip.  But that's not my problem.

I really like Bradley Ogden.  My 1yo daughter loves him, and we love his food.  His spot at Caesars was a special occasion place for us.  We can actually walk to this place from our house.

-Excellent service

Where this restaurant falls apart is the food and the ambiance needs a lot of help too.  We tried a lot of the Happy Hour menu.  The polenta bites were bland and soggy.  The spinach dip was runny and weak.  The calamari was breaded and cooked pretty good, but there was no sauce so that ended up bland too.  I am not sure what is wrong with their Caesar salad but it reeked of fish.  I know Caesar salads have anchovies, but you can smell the dressing from across the restaurant it was so bad.  The best thing we had was the macaroni and cheese.

""Must try!"" reviews were posted prior to the grand opening.  Scan through the tips section and you'll notice who're the ringers that has given them the under served 5 stars during the soft opening and still trying to tip the scale)

1st impression: Service hiccups, kitchen delay, and not great food.  

Service (lack of): The Asian bartender was too busy flirting and rubbing her rack on male guests to actually serve.  She took 20mins from when we sat to take our food order.  We asked for water, twice, but she never brought them.  Got it from a busser passing by instead.  When the food arrived, still no utensils.  We had to wait some more until our food turned cold when she forgot condiments for the fish & chips and sliders.

Taste: The crab cake slider was flavorless.  The tartar sauce overpowered whatever flavor I was supposed to taste.

Months later, decided to give them a second chance.  Results: service improved but food is still not worth the trip.

We happened upon Restaurant Week and got the $21 3-plates set course.

Our server was excellent.  She informed us that she's actually the bartender filling in.  (Shoulder length dark hair.  Sleeved forearms) The restaurant was freezing cold.  She saw goosebumps on my arms and got the manager to adjust the climate.  We appreciate that not only did she acknowledge the guests' discomfort but she  acted on it all on her own.  Throughout the rest of the meal, she took the same great care to make sure our drinks were filled.

Appetizer: 
Heirloom tomatoes in blue cheese.  This was tasty.  +1. 

Entree:

Fish&Chips.  Served w/ the same fries.  Lot of batter.  Very little fish.  Slightly over fried leaving the fish dry.  It was hard to taste anything other than the grease of the batter -1

Located off the strip, the restaurant is more of an upscale brewery or gastropub, different than Ogden's usual white linen affairs.

We went on a Saturday for lunch with a few girlfriends and ordered a bunch of lunch and brunch plates to share. On Saturdays, there's a farmers market outside in the main square. The chefs go and purchase produce, and create specialized dishes based on what is available that day. Farm to table at it's best.

We had a Farmers Vegetable salad, containing thinly sliced, well dressed pluot (hybrid of an apricot and a plum) carpaccio, fried goat cheese cubes and market lettuces. So delish. Even my friend who dislikes eating fruits/veggies was fighting for the last pluot! Fried chicken sliders were also great, fried to a shattering crisp but maintaining its juiciness and flavor. The buns are house-baked, which is fantastic as not many places bake their own bread, let alone a gastropub! Lastly, we got the ""shrimp cocktail."" I put that in quotes because I expected it to be a regular cold shrimp cocktail served over ice but it wasn't ... the shrimp was served warm and grilled (huge shrimp, btw), over a bed of chunky, housemade cocktail sauce, which was also warm. The cocktail sauce complimented the shrimp perfectly and was dusted with a light sprinkling of lemon zest to round out the acidity. If you get anything on the menu, GET THE SHRIMP COCKTAIL.

For entrees, we got the short rib patty melt, which was served with french fries. I was afraid the melt would be heavy or greasy, as it often is it diners, but it was nicely balanced with the amount of short rib and cheese. We also got a hash with fried egg, which was really well done too. The hash and potatoes were mixed up in the dish and really well seasoned. I appreciated that the accompanying sauce was on the side of the plate (but not in its own separate container), so you can add as much as you liked to it. But the dish most highly recommended was the french toast with farmers market berries. I don't know how they made the french toast taste so light, yet satisfying at the same time. Diner french toast this is not ... it wasn't overly sugary or heavily dense. Dare I say, it actually tasted healthy?!

The thing I appreciated about all the food is that they weren't oily or heavy tasting, the way a lot of gastropub or brewery food is ... but full of fresh, delicious flavors that really stand out.

I could take 3 or 4 orders of these and just make it my meal.  They were warm and perfect when they arrived at the table.  And, the cherry sauce went well with them.  Fantastic blue cheese flavor.  A must order at Hops and Harvest.

To eat, the wife had the burger and I had the short rib grilled cheese.  Of these, the short rib was the winner.  It was crispy and gooey throughout, and the onions added nice flavor and a bit of crunch.  Solid short rib as well, it got a little crispy around the edges, but what do you expect?  It's a grilled cheese.

The burger was good, but not as good as I was expecting.  I think it needs a bit more fat perhaps.  It was dry and a tad overcooked around the edges.  We tried the mac n cheese, which was fantastic.  Crunchy crust on top and great cheese flavor.  Another dish I highly recommend you order.

Hops and Harvest is in Tivoli Village so I get they probably have high rent, and therefore feel justified with charging more for everything, like $14 for a bottle of beer because it has a cool name (but still tastes like an average beer.) I have no problem paying more for food and drinks, but they should earn that higher price for their quality and taste.    

I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and my date ordered the BLT.  We also got the mac and cheese appetizer, which was basically your average mac and cheese but with cheddar cheese and not worth $12.  Our dinners were good, but nothing special.  I probably won't be back because I can get the same quality for half the price from somewhere like Jason's Deli.  I just expect something more from these kinds of places.

The pacing of the food was perfect. I like to go out to dine and not feel rushed. The timing is everything. It allowed me to talk with my friend and still eat at a comfortable speed. 

We had ordered the heirloom tomato salad, the crispy polenta, the grilled cheese, vegetable hash, and the strawberry shortcake. The salad was not very big. The heirloom tomatoes were disappointing because they were cherry tomatoes. I would have preferred chunks of larger variety. They tend to be sweeter. The pairing with the blue cheese was delicious though. The polenta nuggets were all different sizes, but retained the moistness in the center. The green goddess was not my favorite. I liked them with the tomato sauce from the grilled cheese better. The sandwich was delicious. It is a grilled cheese. As long as the center is gooey and the bread crisp, could you go wrong? The sauce is what makes it. It is an innovative take on the classic combo of tomato soup and grilled cheese. The vegetable hash was solid, but it is inconsistent from the pictures we see online. The slow cooked egg is fried, we were expecting poached. The hash is more of a potato pancake. The flavors were all there and melded together well. Execution will come with more time. As for desserts, the strawberry shortcake was a good offering. The lemon buttermilk ice cream falls short at the end. It does not possess enough of the tartness to hold up to the generally sweet dessert. The shortcake itself is a combination of a biscuit and coffee cake. It was different. It was apparently good enough to distract me while my dining partner pulled her shady business. ::fist shake::

All featured apps are $3.75 to $6 and then all beer & wine on tap is 50% off.  They were out of a few beers, but that is not surprising for a new hot spot that hasn't had an opportunity to gauge demand and make adjustments to supply.  

Of all of the happy hour apps, the grilled cheese bites were the winner in our group.  No, actually it was the herbed tomato dipping sauce that accompanied the grilled cheese bites.  It was so good we dipped almost all of the other apps in that sauce.  When bartender attempted to clear the almost empty dish, it was like an over-dramatized slow motion scene.  Bf groaned out a deep, breathy nooooooooooooooooooooo!  Without a doubt Hops and Harvest is the current pace setter for all happy hours around; it doesn't get any better.  The next time I return I plan to order one of their pork belly dishes.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,11,7,5,XUnyjopXraGPDSmj0J8hFQ

The food is good (grilled.cheese bites, polenta bites, mini burgers) but the beer is overpriced unless its half off for happy hour. Pork belly bites are pretty good. I'd come back due to proximity to other awesome places around tivioli.",eVufnL_jVKhqqeaAfysgCw,0,0,3,kflUcuJiu4UBBJEhXPqdKw

Complimentary Blue Corn Muffins were very tasty slathered with butter.  I found Bradley's Caesar Salad with Parmesan Croutons to have a delicious house-made dressing, and Heirloom Tomatoes with Maytag Blue Cheese and Rosemary Brioche to be colorful, well prepared, and flavorful.  

I found a grilled H&H Cheeseburger with a soft house-made bun to be very good, but the meat was prepared closer to medium than my requested medium rare.  And, Hand-cut skin-on Fries were good but not great.  A sampling of Diane's Beer Battered Fish and Chips revealed moist and quite tasty battered cod, and Bradley's Tartar Sauce went very well with the fish.

For dessert, Bradley's Butterscotch Pudding with candy brittle and whipped cream on top was outstanding, while a slice of Chocolate Devil's Food Cake resting on a pool of Hot Fudge with powdered sugar sprinkled on top and a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream deftly placed nearby was small but rich, and very good in taste.  A larger portion was not needed.

Service by friendly waitresses dressed like gas station attendants was very good.  My initial visit to this casual eatery was very pleasant and satisfying.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,5,4,4,bTyLOaijIFJBhjxKlZEpUw
5868547,2013-07-10,0,J7EUrh1q3lgENaoTrHZl_w,I've been here for both lunch and dinner. Great food and very nice beer selection. One of the better burgers in Vegas; perfectly cooked and nice beefy flavor. Excellent fries as well. Service is good and improving from visit to visit. Some areas can be noisy due to the room acoustics so be careful where you sit if you want to have a quiet conversation.,bYE5X-TTejK1yVMdKfRYdA,0,0,4,8cQ3awkDLm0pOCe7vAnuZA

What makes this place extra awesome is the service. Rebecca was a fun server and very attentive to our table. We definitely will be back!",yhsWUWex0RtJvOwdRnZLuA,0,0,5,Vm-hOSQIipSShnslsB707A
