Upon entry there was a BK employee on break eating BK food, always an encouraging sign when employees eat company food. Customer service was friendly, unfortunately that was about all that was good. $7.80 on two chicken sandwiches plus value onion rings. Food was below average although not terrible. What really brought this rating down was cleanliness, it seemed as though no matter where I sat a group of nats or a fly or two were sure to follow! That and the seats looked like they haven't been wiped down in days.

Now that I think about it, the last time I enjoyed BK was when I was a kid and my friends and I were in San Diego staying by the beach, we'd grab the original chicken sandwiches at night. 

Bottom line: Don't bother with this place, if you're in the area just go a bit further east and you will find much better places in Chinatown.

Customer service = 4 stars.
Food =2 stars.
Atmosphere = N/A
Cleanliness = 1 star.

Easily located right off Rainbow, however in an empty deserted shopping center, this location is usually very consistent and quick with their service.
I would agree, the food is pretty typical fast food Burger King and they dont put a lot of effort when they make the items. Why is it that all the items at any fast food (not just here) looks like it was just thrown together in the most haphazard way. Makes the food non appetizing. But hey when you are craving something, you gotta hit the craving no matter how the food looks. 
Really good customer service here though.
Angeee really helped me out when I went through drive-through and I noticed my order was wrong. I ended up having to go back through the drive through one more time as she told me to wait in the parking lot while she brought out my order.

When I was a kid I remember really liking their Chicken Sandwiches, before BK rolled out variations of them. Maybe last year I ordered it again when I finally used one of their coupons that found its way into my mailbox with all the junk mails destined for recycling. It just wasn't the same at all, and noticeably more salty.

Anyway, I was being lazy and decided to stop here on the way home and took a crack at their current $5 Mixed and Match promo (ordered the Big Fish and Grilled Chicken, glad the man who took my order told me about my choices since I was just going to order what I saw on their promo ad). Not the greatest but good for the price tag.

I also ordered their Mocha Iced Coffee. That was the only disappointment for me. It was tiny relative to the ones I tried recently from McD but most importantly the taste a dud. Definitely crossing off BK from all future iced coffee run list of providers.

So quick recap:

Good service
I don't like their Iced Coffee
Whopper, Chicken Sandwich not as good as I had remembered as a kid, but I did like their BK Big Fish

This Burger King is located in the Rainbow Dunes Centre and is not very hard to spot since it is the only business left in this area. Looks like there used to be a buffet, hair salon, a shoe store and more that have all sadly closed down due to the bad economy.

I have never been inside, but the drive-thru service is always pretty good. The employees are pretty nice and they have not messed up any of my orders yet. One thing that is nice is that they always seem to make a fresh batch of hash browns when you order them. They make you wait for a while, but they are still hot after I get home!
