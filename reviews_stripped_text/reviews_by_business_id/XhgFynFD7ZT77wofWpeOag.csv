Walking in, I didn't get a welcoming vibe, the blonde hostess had a attitude and rolled her eyes. On the way to our table she tried to sit us at 3 different dirty tables. Then finally being sat she just through the down the stuff and walked away didn't say anything. After being sat we weren't greeted by our server for another 15 mins. Not welcoming at all. Being that the host is the first thing you see that starts off the experience. Especially because a lot of people are coming from every where. You should have someone more friendly and welcoming to your guest.",a1ZxgZXNFbsGnprZKQILGQ,0,0,1,UQ7z-lyhjwElk_XzGRCLMw

Keep in mind, you are escaping city life when you come, so in our experience, service is a bit slower, but you're in the mountains with fantastic views and on Saturday night, there is live music, so we really don't mind the wait. The food is basic American tavern food (burgers,
Sandwiches, salads, appetizers, etc) that is tasty m, but again, nothing to write home about. The servers are all very pleasant and don't overdo it in my opinion. Drinks are cheap and their signature cocktail menu is fun and tasty. One star off because the restaurant could really use a few updates with nicer decor, but the rustic look it does have is quite cozy.",xw9TVjE9XnQVx_kcv2EzSA,0,0,4,b6TPPVy-LeKYxFv4cm7BAA

I'll tell you why...Drove up from south Vegas and arrived at 1134 a.m. due to being stuck for 25 minutes in a local construction zone a few miles away from the lodge there.  We were craving breakfast and doing a late mother's day breakfast since I had to work those days.  Host says sorry, no more breakfast after 1130. I say what happens to all the breakfast food from four minutes ago? Sorry no breakfast after 1130.  So lunch it is...no room to accommodate our request for breakfast.  I guess the breakfast stuff evaporates after 1130 a.m.  Anyway,  lunch was average and the prices are fair. Service was good and scenery was fantastic and that's why they get a three star rating. Disappointed that they made ZERO effort to scramble up some eggs and make any effort to accommodate a simple request.  Be punctual or be ready to eat lunch!!!

About 30 minutes in, we got out lemonade. No less than 4-5 times in the first 70 minutes, the server told us our food would be served within two minutes. Not to worry, we filled up on the delightful water. When our food finally arrived, it was completely wrong. Simple bar food!! The excuse given was that the cook was in training. May I suggest finding a new trainer? After all that, they had the audacity to give us a bill (having removed 50%) , so in all- we spent two hours, $26 and left hungrier than when we arrived.

We kept getting hit by a balloon sword from the table over and the woman making balloon animals had her ass on my husband majority of the time. All I had was a cup of soup and a cesar salad. A salad is pretty hard to mess up, they got they right. But do NOT order the french onion soup!! Usually my favorite soup when I eat out. But this was horrendous! It tasted like dirty water, the cheese was gross, and when it was placed in front of me it had already been spilled it all over the plate it was on before it touched the table and they didn't offer to get a new one with 1/4 of it spilled. The waitor saw that I didn't eat it but clearly played with it, and  he didn't bother to ask why, we had one refill the whole hour we were there, and the others food was decent but not for the price it sits at. I understand we were in a tourist destination so the food is more expensive, but at least make it worth the price. $50 bucks for two burgers(beef, not elk), crappy side soup, side salad, no drinks(water).

595561,2015-03-01,0,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"The girlfriend and I were looking to escape Vegas for a Saturday afternoon and decided to head up to Mt. Charleston after living here for 8 months and not having checked it out.  There was a recent winter storm  that dumped a good amount of snow in the area and another storm brewing that would sure bring some snow flurries and make it a unique experience. 

The restaurant itself is a bit old and small; however, it provides the feel of an old cabin high up in the mountains compared to most modern restaurants you see in mountain destinations these days.  The outside deck, which looks to be open for seating during the warmer months offers great views of the surrounding area, definitely selfie worthy!  We brought our little dog (10 pound papillon) to eat lunch with us on the Doggy Deck (yes, dogs get their own menu as well.  However, it was just too cold to eat outside so we placed her back in the car with blankets and opted to eat inside.  Some people did eat outside though and they looked miserable while the snow flurries were gusting around LOL!  The inside is very old and rustic and just has that overall old feel to it, which is nice though!  Just dont go in here thinking you're eating at a 5 star steak house!

The service was nothing special.  The server was nice but the actual service was just average.  Had to ask for water multiple times.  The server never came back to check on us after the food was delivered and I had to flag down a busser to get the dressing for my salad.

My girlfriend had the french onion soup with a chicken caesar salad and I had the chicken garden salad with the soup of the day (pasta e fagioli).  THE FOOD WAS GREAT!  I'll give them a 5/5 here for sure.  We got to eat along the window and ate as it was snowing outside for a few minutes here and there which made the experience great.

We'll definitely be heading back again in the future!",DpGRP2GXrAaFZWJ4gro1yQ,1,0,4,k1fCQXNAFSBtAxuJ7JoEug

The service is so below mediocre,  but I could get past it if the food was good.  I couldn't bear to pay the lunch prices, for a burger or something so I got the chili dog
 How can you mess up a chili dog? It was over cooked and dry, and the chili was not fresh or even close to good. My water was okay though! My husband ordered a hamburger.  The onion was a tiny ring, about an inch in diameter, with 1 wilted lettuce leaf.  He commented that they are obviously proud of their food for the price,  but then they skimp on condiments.

I've been going to this restaurant for as long as I can remember and I feel like the quality now has been downgraded. There is really nothing special about their food. They are a bit pricey but probably understandable since it's kind of far away from the city. On today's trip, I tried the 10OZ steak and a bowl of French onion soon. The steak came with fries and coleslaw. I got it cooked medium well and it turned out to be very dry and it was almost cold when they served it to me. The French onion soup was good, too much cheese and a little sweet. The best part of my meal was probably the coleslaw and my bottle of Coors Lite. The coleslaw has a tangy pineapple taste to it which gave it a tropical taste. I hope that they lower the prices for the quality of food that they serve. I do enjoy the live country music they play on frida nights. Try this place for breakfast - the servings are a lot bigger than their lunch ones. If you're looking for a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Vegas, this place is conveniently less than an hour away.",1uO7nwlNX3PRmdN7mxZ-PA,0,0,3,gtzsmeHrBoXiq3UBsdG7sA

My husband and I took our dog here on Saturday of Labor Day weekend. They advertised online and in the restaurant they would be having barbecue and drink specials both Saturday and Sunday along with entertainment. That didn't happen. They sat us on the separate patio for dogs which would have been fine but it was a dump. Broken, dirty furniture and plastic folding tables. It felt like we were being punished for having a dog. The main patio was much nicer. Service was terrible. I asked for water 3 times & never got it. Thank God for a bus boy that came around & at least gave my dog water! We figured we would try an appetizer and order more if it was good. Got a chicken quesadilla. Processed chicken and the cheese wasn't even melted. We left.

It was packed so we understood why we had to wait an hour for a table. Once we were seated and ordered our food I noticed that a party had just left a table that was right in the corner of the restaurant with a better view than we had. I asked one of the workers if we could move to that table instead, she told me that we couldnt because we had already ordered our food. Couple minutes later I asked my server if we could move and she said that if we moved it would cause confusion and that she couldnt guarantee that we would get our food? She also said that since we would be at a different area where she is instructed to be that she wouldnt be able to be as attentive. First of all, the restaurant is really small so I didnt believe that. Second, Ive worked at restaurants and when guests want to move we will move them and still attend to them. When we ordered our food their wasnt that many people anymore like when we first checked in so it didnt make sense why we couldnt just move.
My bf and I ordered chicken and waffles and chili beans to share. Chicken was a little hard. Waffles were delicious! Our chili however was warm and not hot, it was also on the dry side. When I let our server now she did exchange it for another one. It was very hard to get our servers attention. It took her a while to come check on us after they had brought our food. She mentioned earlier she wouldnt be as attentive if we would of moved but she still wasnt at all attentive even when we stayed. My daughters had pizza. Dominos is better.

Reminder to never go Christmas week.  It was packed w/ kids, tough to find a parking so parked for the first time in the mud & ice mixed back parking lot.  We also sat by an irresponsible mother who let her son run wild.  

I hate to say the Christmas tree in the lodge was sad.  They had better ones in past years.  It was leaning & had a scary angel topper.  They could really spruce this place up more at Christmas time, maybe some holly & pine sprigs on the tables or ornaments for sale or not for sale, Christmas music..

Roccio our waitress was quick & friendly as well as her helper & the hostess.  Even though the waitress brought us the wrong check, I still give her & the Mountain Chili 5 stars.  Also a bottle of Chardonnay is $24-30 or $7+ a glass both reasonably.  Since there was 4 of us we got a bottle.  

$6 for a Cup of the Mountain Chili & trust me it is very filling!  I posted a pic of how we ordered it.  Under all that cheese, jalapeño, onions is a slowly simmered meaty chili w/ kidney beans.  You can get it w/ pinto or no beans & they have a variety of toppings for .50.  I also get sour cream.  The spices in the chili taste similar to mom's chili!    Mmm so good & consistent.

I love snow so usually visit in January, but from afar the white topped mountains looked snowy, but tricked us.  Lots of brown dead grass & remnants of the beautiful fall leaves.  40 degrees, we still had a wonderful time & left w/ a full tummy!

1368033,2018-01-14,0,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"Mt. Charleston Lodge Restaurant is home to all patrons who very much desire a good hearty American meal while enjoying the natural beauty and spectacular view of mountain ridge landscapes. My friend rides a bike and he knows the best place where riders gather to enjoy a great meal together. And this location is one of their favorite hot spot. We road on a gorgeous day after the rain. As you know, the temperature is still cold and when rain comes it makes snow. The road travels toward the lodge at 7,000 feet in elevation. There are already crowds and large groups of people doing selfies and family snapshots. The parking lot is small and it does get full quickly. Luckily for my friend and I, it didn't take long for us to find a sizable space to park his bike. 

When we enter the lodge, there is a tall fire pit in the center of the room. Instantly, I felt the welcoming warmth and liveliness of people genuinely having a good time. The place is busy as a bee. Thankfully my friend found a suitable table for us. He ordered the Half Rack St. Luis Style BBQ Ribs ($18) with Seasoned Fries and it comes with a Signature Hawaiian Coleslaw . I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($15) with a side of ranch dressing. I was asked if I would like chips, coleslaw, or fries with my meal. And to no surprise, I always choose fries.

The St. Luis Style BBQ Ribs are slow roasted at a low temperature, it's done to achieve optimal flavor, and then it's finished on the grill. The BBQ ribs are so tender that the meat just easily glides off the bone. My friend is not a fan of coleslaw but with the addition of pineapple in the Signature Hawaiian Coleslaw, it makes all the difference on how great it taste. Now my Buffalo Chicken Wrap has crispy chicken tossed in a spicy hot sauce and it's serve with diced tomatoes and lettuce in a jumbo flour tortilla. This is almost like having spicy chicken hot wings in a wrap. It's delicious! The crispy chicken has an amazing spicy flavor and the ranch just complements real nicely. I do enjoy seasoned fries when it's serve hot, well-done, and it taste great when you dip it more in ranch.

Overall, the service here is quick and the meals are very satisfying. The only minimal issue I see is that the ladies room can somewhat be a tight quarter to maneuver through even there is a long wait line. Nevertheless, coming to the lodge is so much worth it, especially with the view I wouldn't mind returning here in a heartbeat!",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,1,5,cObJRukCRjhc8TT1kg6WLA

It's too bad this place doesn't make an effort because according to the other reviews I've read I'm not the only one who feels like someone should come in here & save this place. 

It's tucked away with picturesque views in every direction and it's very rustic cabin charming. I love places like this because it reminds me of the summers I spent with my family in the hills of Poland. It was busy so that looked like a great sign & it also smelled great from the outside. There's a large fireplace inside which would be perfect for colder evenings and the outside patio was perfect today being in the high 70's! Being just over half an hour from Summerlin this was truly a treat!

We overheard several parties complaining just after we were sat about waiting for their check for over 20 mins & the food being cold. It wasn't a good sign but I already had my Chardonnay in hand & I wasn't going anywhere. My wine was great, had vanilla & fig notes :) 

I ordered the teriyaki salmon & my man got chili with a side of fries, 25 mins later our food came & the chili was greasy & bland. The fries were cold and my salmon was overcooked with mushy, very overcooked jasmine rice & undercooked zucchini. The food sucked to say the least. 

The service wasn't any better, having to ask for water several times & refills a few times more. The check took about 20 mins to get & we were over it. The price for all this was just over $50 which was insane. It would have been worth it if the food was decent but it was far from it & most of it was left behind.

Skip this place unless you come in just for cocktails. Instead pack a picnic & have a meal outside at one of the many picnic spots. Next time we're bringing our own food & booze...",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,26,25,3,gZVr19pBjWTLhE1R-YO7SA

No complaints there. So, onto the fish n chips...also great.

My dad ordered a burger and fries and everything was cold, on top of that it was a burger that you get from the freezer section. (Just those premade burgers from the microwave) the fries were also just from a package but (whatever for those) they were super cold. I'm assuming they were sitting out for a while. My mom ordered a thing of ribs which was just 3 bones covered in bbq sauce, again cold. It also took the waiter about 20 minutes after bringing the food to come back and see how we were doing, he seemed to have gotten very angry that they were both unsatisfied with their plates - Mom requested hot fries and Dad to heat up the burger. So now that took a lot longer to bring back than necessary. Afterwards we manage to somewhat eat lunch and when the waiter brings the bill he had already added a huge amount of tip in (at least 20%)

2641308,2015-10-26,60,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"""Hey Boo Boo, let's go get us a pic-a-nic basket"" - Yogi Bear

Most people come to Las Vegas for a quick getaway, but where do LV-locals go for a short escape? We love dining at Mount Charleston Lodge, located at the summit of Kyle Canyon: It's about a 40 minute scenic cruise on our motorcycle from our home in Summerlin, through the desert and up the mountain, reaching high altitude and a whopping 7,717 foot elevation.

The first time I stepped foot into the lodge, it stole my heart! It's a log cabin with all the woodsy styling you would expect: quaint décor, rustic floor to ceiling windows framing the view of the mountains, large 360 degree fire place in the middle of the lodge, and you're surrounded by uninterrupted views of Mount Charleston; ponderosa, juniper and aspen pines as far as the eye can see. There are a few vendors that set up tables in front of the lodge selling handmade jewelry and unique crafts such as pottery, bird feeders and boxes decorated and etched with fire. They also have a tiny gift shop in the back called the Holiday Shoppe, selling ornaments, trinkets, dolls, novelty, collector items and some Mt. Charleston Lodge-branded souvenirs. The lodge is fully experienced in accommodating beautiful and rustic weddings as well; my eyes sparkle at the sight and thought of it. The views here are charming!

Sitting on the outdoor patio is a must for me! Why not take advantage of the crisp air and soak in beautiful Mother Nature? They also have covered seating on the patio on sunny/hot days. There's typically a wait, but for me it's worth it. The brisk fresh air is exhilarating and the view is relaxing. They also have a dog friendly deck with a special menu for your pup! On Sunday's we enjoy the live music and they also have the cutest clown balloon artist for children (and for the young at heart!)

It gets busy during prime breakfast, lunch and dinner hours; however, most people don't mind waiting with a view. All of the host/hostess and servers that we've interacted with while dining here are always super friendly and accommodating. We haven't received bad service yet. Comfort cabin food is their specialty. We've had the pleasure of trying all 3 menus and always find something that we like.

- BREAKFAST: Served until 11:30am on weekdays and until 11am on weekends. I recommend the pancakes or biscuits & sausage gravy. The pancakes are massive, crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside- you also have a choice of protein (bacon or sausage.) The biscuit with sausage gravy is rich and flavorful; I just wish the portion size on this dish was bigger, since it's so delicious! The biscuit and gravy also comes with 2 eggs and country potatoes. All of this and drink totals $22 - not bad for breakfast for 2 with a gorgeous view! 

- LUNCH: The fish and chips were average - The beer battered haddock was served in nice big pieces and the batter was light and airy, but the seasoned fries were lackluster and soggy. However, I really enjoy their signature chili! I also appreciate that I can order it without beans. It's loaded up with huge chunks of ground beef and has the right amount of spices and deep flavor. Chili nachos are an obvious lunch option if you can't decide. 

- DINNER: I enjoy the baby back ribs with sweet potato fries, the lodge's signature chili nachos, and also snacking on the spicy fried green beans. The ribs have a nice sweet and tangy BBQ sauce and the sweet potato fries are abundant, piping hot and fresh. The nachos are hooked up with a generous amount of their signature, beefy chili. You can even get your chili without beans if you wish. The half size portion is only $8 and a generous amount of food! We're always stuffed midway and barely make a dent in it; such a fantastic value! The spicy fried green beans are lightly breaded in a special spice blend and then fried up crispy and golden brown - we can't stop eating them.

The overall pricing is fair for the portion size they offer and the ambiance. We always share an appetizer and entrée and always leave stuffed with leftovers. They also have a fully stocked bar, alongside some treats such as coffee, coffee liquor, hot chocolate and spiked hot chocolate - all to keep you warm. I've tried the ""Warm Apple Pie"" spiked warm apple cider with Tuaca vanilla orange liquor, topped with whipped cream and cinnamon and I love it! It's such a cozy drink to warm you up and get you in the holiday spirit! It gets chilly up here and the weather is typically 20-30 degrees cooler than the valley, which makes it the perfect retreat from the Vegas heat.

Be sure to check out their special menus -they sell picnic baskets for your local hikes around the mountain. I'm sure Yogi Bear is pleased! The lodge even specializes in seasonal holiday menus for Oktoberfest, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Eve. Dining at the lodge is our weekend ritual! We're looking forward to dining here in the winter, when it's snowing and enjoying the mountain scenery!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,79,75,5,sopH3iJV3yITA1c_nRSTUg

The reason for 4 stars is the service was terrible.

She has been pushing hard to keep up with the sudden rush of people and they Crazed need to see snow (My words not his on the Crazed part). We normally stay at the mid mountain lodge on their top floor. Looks like this week we will go up and stay at the upper lodge. I am kind of excited since this will be a new place we have not stayed yet. 

Attention: Miranda (and Management). 

We have been here a couple times now and all was well except for the hostess. I get it you do not feel like dealing with yet another Ski Bum walking in and asking for a table near the fireplace. 

Here is a little surprise for you. I was in shorts, shoes and a button down shirt. Yea not a Ski Bum, Not a Ski Bunny, and not a tourist. I am what WAS known as a repeat customer. I am someone that has been there before had a great time tipped well and brought more people. I am so ashamed I brought someone there now because after you told us No those tables are for 2 people only (Yes we had 3, Oh just like last time and they just slid 2 tiny tales together and we were happy) and then you dropped the fist menu down hard enough that not only did it draw our attention to your rudeness but a table by the fireplace also looked up. 

The food as always was good. We are addicted to the Chili. It honestly is worth the drive from Sahara/ Decatur to go there eat it and drive back. But the hostess makes it not worth walking in there even if I was actually staying at the upper lodge. 

I guess the end of this will be, We may or may not be back this season. The Chili sucks at the other canyon but their employees were overall more pleasant. You could tell a cashier over there was a bit stressed (she had idiots that did not have enough money), but she did not treat everyone along the way bad.",cav24ztwyZ-ddNNWCplIpw,1,0,3,b9ZGaYrr2KxQp3L_YoxHcA

Once you get seated, the service is friendly and very good. Today, it was great. But, the gentleman at the check-in - well, sir, you are not cut out for it. Seems the need to handle the pace and ""complications"" doesn't quite match his skill set. Their notification buzzers ""...don't work outside."" Really? Ten feet from the door and they don't work? We, and two other parties, were all taken by surprise *after* we went in to find out we'd been passed over.

Next, sit down and figure out how to increase your business by offering better food. You already have some pretty hefty margins in your dishes and drinks, make it actually taste good!

Go for the view, maybe a drink or to hear a little music (which, again, the execution of which is not really thought out - you can't actually hear it unless you  sitting in front of the musicians).

For dinner, I did the twilight menu which included a starter, an entree from a select menu, and a dessert. I opted for the caesar salad (an upgrade to the house salad or soup of the day), the pork chops, and creme brulee for dessert. Each and every part of the meal was divine.

Drinks are strong, as well. We tried a margarita, some wine and beer, and of course, their famous boozy hot cocoa treats. Yum, yum! The perfect thing to sip on the patio and watch the storm, which we did!

My husband had the ribs for dinner. They were divine.

For breakfast the next day, we both tried a Bloody Mary. They were outstanding. Probably one of the best restaurant bought I've had. My husband can still make them better at home, but this was damn close. Again, drinks were strong. You get what you pay for, definitely.

I had the corned beef hash with my eggs over easy. The portion was so huge that I just finished eating it the next day for breakfast! It was fantastic, the best corned beef hash I've ever had. No canned stuff, here!

My husband had a breakfast burrito. He is quite the breakfast burrito connoisseur, and he said this was definitely top three in the best he's ever had.

Luckily, I can get my hand on one of those burgers at the Mt. Charleston Lodge, which is just a 30 minute drive away from Vegas.

Quick note: When it comes to burgers here, mayo is optional and offered on the side, so what you'll receive is a plain burger with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cheese.

Elk Burger: The patty was thick and deliciously lean with a subtle, gamy flavor. Cooked at medium rare, it was quite juicy. If it was cooked any longer, it would've been too dry. 

Buffalo Burger: This was my boyfriend's order. The patty was also thick, succulent, and flavorful. Though the elk burger was delish, I liked the buffalo much more. 

The ambiance is relaxed and the decor is, well, lodgy, which I love. There's a great view of the mountains and pine trees that remind you that you're not in Vegas anymore, until you hear the sound of slot machines ringing in the background -- what a mood killer.

It's quite a drive to take just for a burger, but Mt. Charleston Lodge is perfect to have a filling meal after spending the day up in the mountains and exploring the trails.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,8,6,4,IH0c6Bq5QkltOh7FYIof_w

Great view, decent food and mediocre service. The low rating is due to the service.

We had a good server named Miguel out on the patio. He seemed to be the only one happy to be at work today. The manager was loud and trying to set up for a wedding later in the afternoon which made us feel rushed as they were removing all of the furniture around us. He made it obvious that he wanted us to leave so he could vacuum the area to prepare for the next guests.

When we first walked in, the host was on the phone and we noticed several servers standing around talking. Once off the phone, the host informed us that since we had our dog with us, we would have to sit on the dog patio which currently had no service. She let us know that if we didn't mind going up to the bar to order, that the bartenders would bring our food out to us, which was no trouble at all. 
Our experience started off fine, until I stopped up at the bar to grab a glass of wine to go with my lunch while enjoying the view. While there, I was handed our lunches in to go boxes which seemed confusing as the host said the meals would be brought out to us on what we assumed would be regular plates. 
Later on in our meal, two couples sat out on the patio and were immediately greeted by a server that brought out a water dish for their dog (none of these things were ever offered to us). Another gentleman was sitting with his dog waiting to be greeted as he watched the other table greeted. The servers continued to ignore him until he finally went up and asked to be served after watching two servers help the table of four.
Being servers, we were turned off by the fact that we were not served at all, did not receive the same level of service as others and mostly that there were several servers sitting around that could have easily made a good tip off of serving us.

Wasn't very busy at all, lot's of empty seating, but it took about 5 minutes to be seated as the party in front of was debating whether or not they were actually going to dine. They left & finally we were seated. We were asked if we were there for lunch & I mentioned not all but some of us would be eating. The hostess made it a point to say that she could not seat people for just beverages. I get that rules are rules & this place probably gets very packed at times but I found it interesting that that was a necessary thing to say considering it was a slow day & also considering some of the drinks cost as much as the food. 

We all ordered hot drinks, I ordered an Irish coffee ($10, expensive) & the Giant Bavarian pretzel ($9) which I shared with my mother. My friends ordered a pizza & they mentioned that it was a bit undercooked. The pretzel was yummy but pricey. The general food experience was average at best & there were not many decent options for vegetarians & nothing vegan that I could obviously make out. The floor under our table was filthy, forks & garbage from previous guests everywhere. I was also the only one who was carded for alcohol when there was another person drinking at my table. I'm always flattered to get carded but if you're carding you should card all, It should be a system of just making sure all drinkers are of legal age. The waiter service was excellent. Our server went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed & even another waiter who was not serving us checked on us. One thing they are doing right is hiring excellent servers. I'd probably be back again if I was in the area with friends since it's really one of the only options at Mount Charleston but I think I'd prefer to hit the bar instead of the restaurant.",rx6TW2QmrfImGX0dvLyPQg,3,1,3,6dDbkztFmMzwR78tulMsuQ

3762590,2017-02-23,1,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"Let  me start off by saying I love to watch the television show Restaurant: Impossible. Many times my wife and I will ask ""What Would Robert Irvine DO?"" when we go out to eat. This place was no different.

So is this The Resort At Mount Charleston or is it A Cut Above? According to websites, and pictures here on YELP, I believe, they're one and the same. Seeing how our receipt had ""Mt Charleston Lodge Restaurant  at the top, that's where I will go on YELP.

When looking upon for menus on YELP, each time I was lead to a website for The Mount Charleston Resort. The website showed a breakfast menu, and a dinner menu, but no lunch menu. The website does advertise Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Just no lunch menu.

Upon entering the hotel lobby, we (my wife and I) noticed no signage leading us to the restaurant. While taking pictures we actually stumbles upon the entrance to the restaurant. We stood there for a few minutes, I saw a female sitting at a table, but other than her the place was empty. We figured maybe the place was closed and were contemplating other options for dining. Then a woman came from around the corner, wearing what I perceive to be her day to day clothing, grabbed to sheets of paper, and then proceeded to seat us at a table next to a window. Awesome view!

The pieces of paper she grabbed, she placed on the table and they turned out to be the BAR menu. Mind you the bar is located on the other side of the hotel lobby. This must be why the website has no lunch menu. Then again it didn't advertise a bar menu either. Here is what we ate and how the bar menu described them.

Mozzarella Sticks: Hand Breaded And Served With Marinara .

Sriracha Burger: Bacon, Caramelized Onions, Cheddar and Pepper-Jack Cheese, and Sriracha Aioli.  (these were served with steak fries, topped with sea salt)

BBQ Chicken Flatbread: Cilantro, Red Onions, BBQ Ranch.
(the flatbread seemed to be topped with some sort of an aioli or mayo as well.)

The food was fine, my wife liked her Burger very much.
The BBQ Flatbread was fine but seemed to be think with sauces.
The Mozzarella Stick tasted good, but as if they were bought at a freezer section of the local grocery. I'd be very surprised if they were hand breaded.

I do have gripes about the cleanliness of the place however.

Carpet: The carpeting directly under the chair beside me was torn. Needs to be fixed, possibly done away with.
Chairs: not the most comfortable, and personally I think they should all match! You will notice in a few of the pictures I added, that the chairs throughout the restaurant do not match.
Dust: On the blinds, air ducts, some of the furniture like the piano. I spotted dust on ledges and other flat surfaces. Everything needs to be cleaned on a regular basis. 
The are two fireplaces each with dark smudges leading up from them. Seems like a chimney sweep is in need. 
Staff: I have a few things to point out about the staff.
 Friendliness: Our server wanted to talk with us about things like how she loves her commute to and from work. No offense, but if I didn't ask about your commute, I don't need to know about it.
 Uniforms: Why are we not wearing uniforms? Our server was wearing short sleeves. The other server was wearing long sleeves. No logo or name tags either. 
 Visibility: At least one person should be in the dining room at all times. My wife could have done a dine and dash and no one would have noticed until it was too late. The two servers today seemed to be chatting a bit in the back of the house. Instead, let's take care of the front of the house, maybe by cleaning it up a bit?

Big positive: If you are given a window seat, chances are you will be given a great view of the great outdoors. The background music being played was mostly country music from the 1990's. Which I love, so from me that was a big plus also.

But inn closing I'd like to say that this place could and should be top notch.

It started to drizzle, then rain, and by the time we got to Mt. Charleston, we were in a full blown blizzard! The lodge was CRAMMED with people, it was hard to find a parking spot. 

There were people sledding, families taking photos, and a line of people waiting to get inside the lodge to warm up. We made it inside to see a lovely, picturesque scene that you'd see in a ski movie. There was a duet strumming and singing hits from the 80s. People peeled off hats and coats and wrapped their frozen fingers around steaming cups of hot chocolate and munched on some incredible noms from the kitchen. We thoroughly enjoyed the TBLT and the chilli. There's a full bar, including an awesome menu of adult hot chocolate drinks with clever names, and you can take hot cocoa to go!

I have one critique. Their bathrooms NEED an update. Not only are they unbelievably small but they look like they haven't been renovated since the 50's.

The cooler temperatures of the mountain make it a good getaway from the city in the summertime.  There used to be a round fireplace in the center of the lodge which was removed several years ago.  The place lost a bit of its charm in the winter.  

We stopped two weeks ago for our summer lunch.  I had their Reuben sandwich and fries.  It was filling and OK.  Nothing special but a treat after a tough hike.

They have gotten a bit stricter about breakfast/lunch times.  It used to be if you go there a little after 11:30, you still could get breakfast.  This year, they were very precise that breakfast had ended and only lunch could be ordered.

A nice place to visit to escape the heat for awhile but don't expect gourmet food.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,9,3,0Mr5bNT6hjj47Wubc05vgA

4107135,2014-07-18,1,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"One of the major reasons that I agreed to go on a hike at Mt. Charleston was to try the food here. It didn't meet expectations, but was still good. Oh, and the restaurant too.

We asked to be seated outside so that my friends could keep an eye on their dogs. There were two other parties with dogs, and all the dogs seemed to bark and growl, especially when near each other. Be forewarned about this (and the breeze blowing away trash and napkins) before choosing to enjoy the fresh air and the view.

While I was ordering my entree, I learned that adding a cup of soup or a salad would only be an additional $2. When the server told us that the soup of the day was cream of mushroom with chicken and rice, I was sold. This soup ended up being the best experience today. Tender chicken and not too mushy or hard rice, and the mushroom flavor of course, made for a great time.

I managed to convince a friend to try the buffalo and elk burgers with me, so we split the patties half and half. We ordered each burger medium rare, but we got medium at best (note to self: try asking for rare in the future). After a miscue when they brought the order out, I finally got blue cheese crumbles on the elk and started eating the meat alone. I really couldn't tell what it tasted like, but it wasn't that savory. The blue cheese ended up being necessary for flavor.

On the other hand, the buffalo had a nice flavor similar to the bison patty served at Burger Bar on the Las Vegas Strip. I describe buffalo/bison as cleaner-tasting beef, if you're curious. I also liked my friend's choice of provolone melted on top of the patty. I think the buffalo patty could have passed as medium-rare, but it didn't seem as juicy as I remembered my first bison patty being. As for the fries, they were very good, the kind that's salted/seasoned like curly fries but isn't curly. Reminded me of my favorite fries at Henry's American Grill.

I also sampled a few other items from another tablemate. I got a sip of the ""world famous"" Mt. Charleston Coffee, which is basically coffee plus alcohol (Drambuie) and didn't seem sweet enough for me. I also tried the fish from the fish and chips, which was spectacularly tender and juicy inside and may just be my order next time. Finally, a bowl of chili without the meat and with some cheese added on top was also great, although I don't think the spiciness would have sat well on my delicate tongue through a whole cup, much less the bowl.

Overall, I wasn't impressed with the burgers, but I was happy enough with other items that I would go back as well as recommend this place to visitors of Mt. Charleston.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,2,4,mKbvz2a-GmVBFQ7Tfp3lsA

As we entered the hostess was a little clueless, but at least it wasn't busy and it was lunch time. Our waiter was a little pushy to take our order and I felt rushed, which is not good. 
Since we were rushed we just ordered spaghetti for our kids, which was a big portion so they shared and my husband and I shared a Caesar salad and a hamburger. The food was good, but not as good as it was 5 years ago when they had a more specialized menu. We sat there and ate our food and enjoyed the scenery and the outdoors smell, especially in the rain, absolutely wonderful. We will return at the end of September for our anniversary and take advantage of the 3 course menu that they have.
Oh and they would have have more stars, but being rushed is a no no and the price on some things are over priced. Other than that it's a nice place to relax in the mountains.",4d14iYYxxaVrlAWVh8sbFQ,0,0,3,E5OUv4SkvksUN4bOGkumjQ
4109509,2014-11-03,2,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"A good place to get away!

Located on Mt charleston near the end of Kyle Cannon Road. The lodge is next to some rental cabins and fantastic hiking trails that have recently been upgraded by the local parks department.

The restaurant decor kind of reminds me of a log cabin with wooden seating, fireplaces and massive open deck area with a Stella view. Your able to bring your dogs to the deck area, providing plenty of bowls of water and sometimes they have small snacks. A small gift shop with different trinkets and souvenir items are also available for purchase. 

The cool wooden fully stock bar with a rotating seasonal beer selection has bar gaming machines to still remind you your still in Nevada. The menu is a pretty standard selection of burgers, sandwiches, soups and salads. I do recommend the Fish 'n' Chips. I don't know why you go to the desert and up a mountain to get good fish 'n' chips but take my word for it they are pretty good.

In winter it's a real white Christmas experience with great views and custom made seasonal drinks. During summer it's cooler weather on the deck will have you wondering if your still in Las Vegas. I believe it's mostly locals that visit, so you won't have to worry to much about the tourist trap.

Good food and great views make it worth the occasional visit!

There were 7 of us. We ordered 2 Big Kahuna burgers, 2 fish and chips, one Reuben, on stuffed turkey burger, a buffalo burger, a giant Bavarian pretzel and a cup of chili. I tried a bite of chili, a bite of fish, and a bite of pretzel. My meal was one of the Kahuna burgers. I also took home half of the buffalo burger.

My burger was cooked a little beyond the medium I requested. I was OK with that but it would have been better a little less done. Good flavor with the grilled pineaplle though. The chili was very good which I had been told before. They weren't lying. The buffalo burger was good too. Maybe better than my beef burger. A cleaner flavor. The fish was a little fishy for me. I'm more of a turf guy than a surf guy despite my SoCal pedigree. And we all agreed the fries were amazing. Not too thickly cut but thicker than shoe strings. Seasoned. Perfectly cooked.

Service was very good today. Attentive and jovial. There was a little mix up in the kitchen that delayed the buffalo burger and they were quick to apologize and keep us informed of the status. They brought an extra plate of those amazing fries as my aunt waited. The food was good but not all of it was phenominal. A solid 3.5 stars for the food.

No, it was not that busy, these servers are just insanely slow. I'm typing this as we made our food order half an hour ago. Diane spent way too much time talking to her regulars. I timed her and she spend 10 of 15 minutes talking to one couple by the windows about random people they both knew.

When the food came the burger was over cooked. It was supposed to be medium and it was dried out the whole way through. My daughters got dog was grilled halfway to Armageddon. The first ah and chips were cold. You could tell they sat a while under the warmer, the top of the tartar sauce was cooked. Kinda nasty. On a bright note the salads were good. I like how they cut the parmigiana a little thicker than most places. It adds a great touch. The hot cocoa was spot on and we are always thankful they serve Coke. That's tougher to find in Vegas than you would think.


This was about my 10th time to the Lodge and it was my first disappointment. 

The Lodge itself is nice, on cold days the smell of the wood burning fireplace inside is a welcome treat. On this visit, I brought my dog, so we sat out on the puppy patio. The weather was perfect! The restaurant was understaffed and by the time we left there was a 20 minute wait even though there were 30 empty tables. I ordered chicken strips as they were awesome in the past, the recipe changed: these were foul tasting. My 9 year old wouldn't finish hers. The Coke was watered down and the fries were bland. The prices were high for the poor quality of food.

The view is spectacular with big glass windows overlooking the mountain and hummingbird feeders that attract a lot of these beautiful creatures...the place is lovely BUT their menu needs improvement, specially their breakfast options, it doesn't offer healthier or lighter options like oatmeal or yogurt for example. No pastries or bread basket/options for those who doesn't eat a lot and maybe just want a continental style breakfast before hiking. You have to consider this is the only option if you are staying in the lodge/cabins on site. For a restaurant in a mountain, you would expect more hearty food and less ""sports bar style food"", but they do offer some good options for dinner although only one option for chicken and it comes with pasta, not an option of only chicken with any other side. On the bright side, their pizzas are good and the hot chocolate is awesome, specially on chilly nights. I also consider the prices to be excesive, it's really pricey (I know is the only restaurant in the mountain - there's another in the other hotel but at a lower altitude) but wow: onion rings for $14?, mozzarella sticks $13, a quesadilla $14 and a simple spinach salad $16? Come on! It's ridiculous. Sandwiches with potato chips -not even fries- $15? So a simple lunch of turkey melt sandwiches for a family of 4 plus 1 beverage each will be about $70!

This is exactly why the menu specifically says ""NO SUBSTITUTIONS""!  Worst meal ever. We have eaten here various times and food is always sub-par, we always hope for improvement but in 4 years its just gone down hill. Save your money and either eat before you heard up to Mt. Charleston or get food when you leave! Better check with the health department before eating here.... because the food is definitely not kept to an acceptable temperature!

UPDATE:  After Thomas S (a manager?) saw my review he has offered us a full refund for our  meal, which is greatly appreciated.  Waiting to see if that happens.

Please also note this review while not good, is the not the result of dining here only one time.  We have eaten here many times over the years and try to make this a New Years Day tradition, but the food was so bad I had to write a review.  As I stated before all the food they were serving for breakfast was pre-made and kept below health department standards in terms of temperature.  If you are going to shell out good money for food, especially in the Las Vegas area, you better be prepared to serve fresh made to order food.  We have seen the quality in the food decline over the years and yesterday was kind of the last straw. To those of you who have dined here and enjoyed your food, I'm glad, keep going back. It has the potential to be an amazing place to dine.

Yelp is a place for customers to write reviews on their experiences at various businesses.  I did just that, but only after dining here several times, and the manager is mad about my review.

Maybe now that I'm becoming more of an #adult, I'm starting to see the things my parents probably rolled their eyes at ten years ago. 

Parking is always a nightmare - not much they can do about it because of limited space but it is a major headache. Snag a spot as quickly as you can. I walked in to get a table and waited 25 minutes on my husband while he waited for a parking spot.

Again, beautiful view. But $15 for a burger, $17 for a small pizza - overall overpriced bar food. Nothing too special.

We didn't take the opportunity to come up last year and now discovered the old gift shop that was once located inside the restaurant is no longer :( The owners retired. That was definitely a staple.

Upon arriving, the first thing I noticed and then utilized was the (clean!) baby changing station with privacy curtain. Most restaurants that do not have a bathroom large enough to install a baby changing station do not go to the lengths to make sure there is a changing station elsewhere. This was very impressive! On the same note, I also noticed that they have a large supply of high chairs, not just one or two. 

The hostess and 2 servers we had were pleasant, prompt, and never overbearing. My husband is very particular with his food, and his order was prepared perfectly. The food was absolutely DELICIOUS. We had the French onion soup, Reuben sandwich, BBQ burger, chicken quesadillas, and the Paul Bunyan burger. Worth noting: their adult hot drink menu is amazing!! I had the ""ski lift""- coconut rum, peach schnapps, and hot chocolate. SO GOOD! 

The central wood fireplace is beautiful, and my toddler loved it! She also loved saying hi to (one of) the cat(s) that live at the lodge and was on the doggie deck. We did not bring a dog with us, but I love that they are dog friendly and even offer a dog menu!

4628610,2016-10-13,0,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"I'm kind of a sucker for these types of mountain lodge places. I grew up in a mountain town, and there's just something in me (call it nostalgia?) that gets a little giddy over them.

The Mt. Charleston Lodge is very large. It has a massive indoor space with a large bar and dining tables (a live music area, too), as well as an extensive outdoor deck seating area. It makes sense, during the nice weather months folks wanna sit outside and enjoy the cool weather, and sometimes it's too cold for that, so in they go. I get it.

This is a popular location for hikers, bikers, motorcyclers, tourists, locals, you-name-them. Be prepared for a crowd, especially on a weekend when it's stupid hot in the valley and people are looking for relief. Or in the fall when the leaves turn, or in the winter when it snows. You get what I mean? Consequently, parking can be a little bit of a bear, be forewarned.

Food-wise I've had their elk burger and I was not impressed, the elk was too dry. I'd go for the chili instead. That's always been a winner, and it pairs well with beer. Speaking of libations, they have a few custom cocktails to choose from, and a few beers you can have, too. Be careful, at elevation these will hit you a bit faster and harder than you might be accustomed to.

Service can be hit-or-miss. As mentioned before, this place can be slammed and consequently the staff is sometimes running around with their hair on fire trying to keep things running smoothly.",eurIEcpGa_tTi1LMWa1pUA,1,0,4,WOANcOltkS7qrDoAlTKHUg

We also ordered the mountain club with turkey. It use to be the normal triple decker which has now changed to a turkey sandwich with two pieces of turkey and a piece of bacon. The waitress informed us that the owner changed the menu and made the club smaller because people were not finishing it. What does that matter as long as they are paying for it!

Both dishes come with Seasoned fries, very tasty!

The burger is very much a hit and miss!
It is either under or over cooked!
You just never know!

Almost every time I had a great experience for eating lunch or dinner here.

Today, my elk burger was extremely over cooked. I had to shave the top layer off. It was burned!
Well, after doing that, I actually ate the burger. It was good meat!
BF liked his Buffalo burger. 

Our waiter and waitress, both were very attentive.
Checked back for refills on the drinks ... 

If you like to come up here for dinner, they have a great special waiting for you!
It called the Twilight dinner special: $22/person, including a three course meal. Soup or salad, a choice of entrée, and dessert.

I tried it before, and I liked it. My favorite entrée was the BBQ ribs. And my favorite dessert was a cheese cake.

I also enjoy coming up here for their amazing fire pit, at cold evenings ... sipping hot chocolate or maybe some wine ...

The setting is perfect, Mt Charleston and most of the trails for Kyle and Lee Canyons within minutes of the lodge. This is the lower lodge, not the one near MaryJane Falls Trailhead. This is really the only very positive plus I will give it.

The restaurant's food was good, but the service on all levels was horrible. The staff in general were very friendly and not rude at all, but the service was so slow, it overtook everything else. We got into our room, no towels. No biggie, we asked for towels and got them. We went to eat dinner, well, it took about 30 minutes after seating us for anyone to offer us drinks or an appetizer. Then when we did order, we ordered our whole meal because we sat long enough to decide on everything. About 20-30 minutes later we got 2 glasses of wine and our appetizers, soup and salad...that's right 20-30 minutes later and it all came at once, even the wine. So basically we sat for 45-60 minutes without even a glass of water. It wasn't even busy, maybe another 4-5 tables of people. When our Entrees came, which also took a very long time...another hour or so. We had been sitting there food-less and drink-less again. We only ordered water this time, which also took them 10 minutes to bring. So, we finally after several hours were done with dinner which did taste very good. I will give them some benefit of the doubt that they had a wedding party in the next room and most of their staff dedicated to it. The prices were pretty steep considering how poor the service was. I will say our waitress did bring us deserts on the house due to how long we waited in the beginning.

The next morning, we reluctantly decided to have breakfast there, a little worried about how long it might take considering our long wait for dinner the night before. It was as expected, a fairly long wait, not as bad as the night before, but still it took over an hour to get and eat breakfast. We were supposed to have 2 boxed lunches ready for us (it was a hikers special that included a box lunch for each person for an extra $15). We asked the lunches be ready at 8am. we finally got them around 9am, having to leave for our hike late. I expected a better sandwich, it was turkey, American cheese, tomato, lettuce, no mayo, no mustard, not even packets, one orange and a bag of chips. It was a boring lunch.

While I was standing around the lobby waiting for our lunches, I overheard the bride's mother putting in a complaint about the service for their wedding party. She was very cordial toward the person she was complaining to, but it seems she had similar complaints about the service being extremely slow and disorganized. I'll second that! The person she was complaining to responded by saying they only have one cook and are having trouble finding staff. Really? In this economy, there are lots of good people looking for jobs, including cooks. Their excuses didn't go over with the bride's mother well nor did they me.

The potential of this place is amazing. They really need to work on their level of service though. I will use the place as a place to stay if I have a long hike the next day, but I won't eat there or rely on their service again.",F6lHT23hTEjOg8FRy9Iv3Q,2,1,1,5l82zNqTOh-etQH4HgMDew

I had a buffalo burger which they recommended should be cooked medium or medium rare. I went medium as I get all my burgers cooked. It came out well done with a bun that was either stale and/or toasted to hard cardboard status. The fries were soggy and inedible, probably an issue with the oil it was fried in as the onion rings in our app sampler were the same.

That's what the kids wanted and I had to shell out 10 per because they could only charge me for a hotdog all The way and put the chilli on the side. But the view alone is worth 2 stars and then 2 stars for the good food and prompt service. We will be back.",EcYPCwJtFcQ-Ih9BG6mcUA,0,0,4,jj-jJzRT8X_XKKuxtAVGTg

Half portion nachos with chili were more than sufficient for me and my wife. Reuben was tasty with a nice melt of cheese. Thousand island came on the side but if you know you want it on the sandwich, just ask for it (cheese kept the sandwich pretty nicely together). Mountain omelet for breakfast is basically 3 eggs (looked like 5) with usual peppers and onions double stacked like hearty pancakes plus, country fried potatoes on the side. $1 more gets you a decent tasting biscuit and gravy instead of toast.

Crowd is awesome. Seems to be primarily locals and there was a chill Harley club the morning I had breakfast. This was in July though. I wonder if the snow season and crowds will change the ambiance here much but I'm excited to check it out when the time comes! Also can't wait to try their fireside drink menu.

I LOVE the interior.  Its cozy and really pretty with a beautiful view, like a lodge should have.

Service was slow and confused, but polite.  We had a few people as our ""servers"" and they forgot to bring out our pretzel with the other two the table ordered.  We also had to ask 3 times for a water for one person in our party, and for another, we asked 4 times and still never received one.  

We didn't try much:
2 bowls of French Onion soup:  a little bland, but not bad at all.  They used a good amount of cheese which always helps.
The hot chocolate: standard...kinda boring.  I want to go back and try the alcoholic version. 
The giant pretzel:  THIS I would drive back up here for.  Served with a huge helping of dipping cheese, this pretzel is what soft pretzels should aspire to be...if they could have aspirations.  Soft, salty, delicious...omg.

5328944,2014-07-24,4,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"Coming here for a intensive workout hike, I expected my choice of French Toast to be well worth the calories. Years ago ( 2010 B.Y. ""Before Yelp"" ) I had eaten here for lunch and loved everything about it so I expected atleast 4 stars. After hiking Sunday morning my friends and I found a cellphone lying next to a car. We immediately asked the outside dinners if they were missing a cell. No claims. We went inside to ask the manager Thomas if there was a PA system to make an announcement and he was very cold about it. He wanted to just throw the phone in the LOST & FOUND, but knowing how sick anyone would be wondering where their cellphone is we decided to take matters into our own hands. Tables weren't quite full yet so we looked at the screen photo and tried to find the couple in the picture. Thomas kept walking around us, giving us dirty looks as if he was really annoyed by our persistance. He didn't take in consideration that we were not only hungry too, but hot, sweaty and just really wanted to sit down. Finally after no luck finding the couple, he gave us a seat on the windy cold patio. I immediately was not having that. I politely asked to be moved inside and he did so without hesitation. Our server Jason, although stoic, was rather cool and seemed to tunnel vision his way through his work hours in order to make it through. (Happy place....) It wasn't his fault but our food seemed to take a REALLY long time to come out of the kitchen. I realized it wasn't just me thinking that because 2 different servers came over to let us know that it was on the way.
Meanwhile as we waited, we watch the manager Thomas grimace and bark at the servers. He ripped some female server a new one and she seemed to look medicated on Xanax, because like Jason, her facial expression never changed either. She continued to go about her duties as Thomas was imaginary. (Happy place.....) Thomas was the only one who seemed---alive, with uneasy emotion. 
Finally our food arrived and I new immediately my French Toast was warm (not pipping hot like I get at Blueberry Hill.) For $12 you get Rum french toast and I think a side of ham was $6 or $9). I didn't want caramel, I didn't want banana's, or whip cream. I hate EXTREMELY sweet breakfast. Yet, there was no option for JUST french toast. So for two pieces of bread dipped in batter it was $12! I picked all those sugary banana's off. Atleast at BH---I get 2 scrambled eggs! 
My friend who I was with likes her food WELL DONE/EXTRA CRISPY. If she complains, then it MUST be OVERCOOKED! The ham was hard as beef jerky, the home potatoes were like corn nuts, and the french toast was so thick I almost asked for a steak knife! The bread wasn't even SOAKED in the batter fully. It was like they lightly brushed it with batter then set it on the grill for an hour that we waited. I had to saw at the thick dry bread--almost giving up and pulling it apart with my fingers, and then put syrup in between the layers of the bread!!! 
Every thing SUCKED---but we were so tired, and so hungry we just ate around what could and never complained to anyone. We just wanted to go home. 
Now, I don't totally dismiss this restaurant because every establishment has their weaknesses AND not everybody can handle a breakfast rush. Breakfast is tedius and you have to be organized and fully staffed. While Burgers, salads, sandwiches, and deep fry goodies may be their strong point, breakfast certainly is not--atleast not a busy weekend. Breakfast service is probably much better on a weekday.
In the end, 2 stars because of the managers attitude and lack of discretion, and crappy breakfast food. Best of all the couple finally realized they didn't have their phone and it was returned.",jwvmw22-y4eMq2rzi0wAeQ,2,2,2,qVS1Ttq8nB_7bry8-mYFBg

For example, The Nutty Irishmen is tasty coffee with Irish creme, whipped cream, nutmeg, and many other goodies (wish I could remember)...

5429075,2015-03-03,1,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"We've been here before but this time we came when the mountain was covered in snow, and it was actually still snowing. Needless to say the warmth of the restaurant was a welcome escape from the 29 degree weather. The restaurant is always cozy and the staff always helpful and welcoming. The other times we came it was good but this time everything we ordered really hit the spot. 

We started off with the chicken florentine soup of the day with an order of warm French bread. The soup was amazing. I don't understand why they don't make it a daily soup, at every restaurant in the world. It was warm, creamy, comforting, and perfectly flavored. We cut up pieces of the French bread and dipped it in the soup and it was sooooooo good. I would drive all the way back up the mountain just to have that again. If they had that in a sourdough bread bowl I would just rent a cabin for a week and gorge myself. I don't know if it was because it was cold but it just really did the job for me. 

Next we ordered the mozzarella cheese sticks (more like triangles) but they were perfect as well. You know how sometimes when you order cheese sticks you just basically get a warm breaded cheese curd? Well that isn't the case. This was an oozy, stretchy, stringy cheese stick. Even 12 minutes after we initially got them, the cheese was still stretchy. That's some good mozzarella sticks. 

And for our entree we decided to share the fish and chips. It was good and what you would expect. The fish was moist and flaky. The seasoned fries that it came with were awesome though. Crunchy outside with soft potato in the middle and seasoned well without being too salty. We ended the meal with two hot chocolates and whip cream to go for our drive back down the mountain. 

I would say this place is a solid 3 1/2 to 4 star place all the time, but I don't know if it was the perfect circumstances but our last trip in was definitely a 4 1/2 star experience.",I0JqG0FOL1FXDTTi_VVJhg,1,0,4,AqqakoWFPzvOM24XIdIbug

My friends each ordered their 3 course meal deal for $20 each, while I went with the Southwest Chicken Quesadilla appetizer. They liked their food and finished everything. One of my friends remarked that his clam chowder didn't look and taste like clam chowder, and more like clam soup, which I've remarked as a tip below. 

My quesadilla appetizer was sizeable and good. It was cheesy and the chicken was seasoned well. There was an abundance of tomatoes, though: Tomatoes in the quesadilla, on the side, and in the salsa. Maybe a different side would've been better?

Frankly, the food is just fair at best and they're not ashamed to charge for it. I guess for the restaurant alone I'd give the place a 3... Maybe.  The view is great from the large back deck.  However: They get a giant ZERO stars for their poor parking and total disregard for their clients.  This is a popular stop for motorcyclists and with paved parking at a premium (there is a large dirt...er rather rock-garden lot in the back) this place took up 4 or so spaces with a new coffee truck, labeled another handful of spots as ""staff only"", put up a whole bunch of ""NO PARKING"" signs in areas that were a great fit for motorcycles (not for cars) and essentially left us with limited spots.  I road in today with 3 guys, we couldn't find anywhere to park our bikes (they're large 900lb touring bikes, so the rock garden lot is less than ideal...and could puncture a tire).  We left.  There are a lot of other places that they could park their coffee truck and employees should not be taking up prime spots that paying customers need.  I guess they just don't want the business??

I had the French onion soup. The cheese appropriately draped over the edges of the bowl and was warm, melty cheesy goodness. The broth was excellent and not too salty, like you can find with a lot of French onion soups. The onions were not uniformly cut but they were caramelized well.
My husband ordered the chicken strips with French fries. The strips were store bought frozen and were not anything special.

That's even noted on the website. No worries, we checked and raced up there. 

We arrive a little after 10 and some guy immediately gives me his hostess-stand beeper for his party of 8; ""it's an hour wait."" Understanding his party of 8 is part of an even larger party, I understand his delay and take a chance. 

I check in and explain that I've been given the seat/beeper and there's only two of us. I see open seats at the bar and ask to sit there so someone(s) else can take the table(s). 

Nope. They closed the kitchen 30+ minutes before (they only opened at 8?) and claimed an accident made it so staff couldn't make it. 

""But everyone else made it up here?"" The parking lot was PACKED. 

""It was a bad accident."" 

Huh?! 

This is the third or fourth time they've done this in recent months. There was NO accident on the road up nor any delays of any kind. Happening once, a holiday weekend maybe?, I get it. But this place IS popular and at least two of four of our last breakfast visits they closed the kitchen early for various ""staffing"" reasons and pushed everyone to wait for lunch service. 

How about figuring out the staffing and management? You're open 90ish minutes and already shutting down?! 

Instead we recruited about 20 people outside and invited them to Big Dog's... where even when they're busy they know how to handle service and guests without blowing smoke.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,0,0,1,FLZcvgSt6D5SxOgEm8JXeQ

The restaurant is a rustic lodge that is a little run down but I can appreciate the charm.  It has nice outdoor seating.  The fireplace is a nice touch as well.

The menu has very few options. I slimmed down boring bar menu.  Beers from the tap never seem very cold either.  All of the food items are on the high side. The burgers are so dry.  I order a side of mayonnaise, and they come in squeeze packs, just to choke down the burger. I have had a few menu items, and I think everything on the menu was previously frozen.

5626831,2017-02-07,0,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"I have come to the Mt. Charleston lodge many times throughout the years and seen it gone through many changes. For the most part it still looks the same. The fireplace in the center is still there but no longer are there the low rustic couches surrounding it. The gaming at bar is gone. I remember when it used to be open 24 hours and we would drive up here late at night. And the little gift shop at the front is gone. So kinda sad that things have to change. 

So heres my review for my most recent visit. We came up here for superbowl weekend and stayed in the cabins so of course utilized the restaurant several times. We stayed the course of the game and for food we started off with the Bavarian pretzel. It was huge and delicious along with the cheese sauce. Then we shared the Buffalo burger and the garlic chicken pizza. The burger was great, pizza not so much. Pretty flavorless. For drinks I tried the bloody marys which were good. They have a good selection of beer and wine.  Cant forget their specialty hot drinks which are a pricey $10 but good. 

Next day had breakfast. Did the nutty Irishman and my husband the mountain scramble and I , the corn beef hash which I highly recommend. Came back later for dinner and wasnt as impressed this time with their bland French onion soup, garden salad that we had to ask for the tomatoes that the menu said was on it, and the small battered chicken wings that are way overpriced at $15. (Have to say most of the menu is overpriced) Wish places would say when the wings are battered. 

Also, a funny thing we experienced on all our visits, was we would get greeted by the server who would take our drink order and a minute later someone else would ask if we want to order a drink.  They werent servers but assistants we guessed.",nVaEKWMYWVGdJKsSx0Bb_Q,0,0,4,nfY3oJD3ZbSx1QCvzvZcBA

We had not been up here in quite some time, but after hiking Saturday, stopped in for a refreshing brew. The place was busy and parking can be a challenge, but lucky enough I ran into a friend who was leaving and he gave me his spot!

We walked in and headed for two spots at the bar. Our bartender was friendly and served us pretty quick. We had already ate so we just hung out and took in the views! 

They have really changed the lay out of the lodge. In the old days, there was a fireplace in the center of the room and a lounge where everyone could sit around the fire and enjoy a hot chocolate or Mt. Charleston coffee. Now there are dining tables everywhere and they extend outside. In addition, there is a new patio that accommodates
more outdoor seating and also features an outdoor fireplace. I really love the outdoor seating as the weather was perfect for sitting outside and enjoying the beautiful afternoon. They still have a stage for live music but there was none on this particular day. 

We still enjoyed our brews and took in the views all around us. This is a great getaway spot and a treat for your friends and family visiting as you can show them a different side of our desert home!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,3,1,4,r_Q3wbdT51_ll0iDBX1AUA

5680389,2016-08-18,1,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"After a beautiful hike up Cathedral Rock, I was starving!! We fought for a parking spot, walked up, and got in line to get a table. Gave my name to the server and we were told it would be about 45 minutes. So we grabbed drinks from the bar and headed outside. 30 minutes went by. 45 minutes went by. Finally got to an hour and we decided to check out what was going on. Back to the hostess stand, where someone new was standing. I tried to be polite about asking when we would be seated (and either I was successful or I was rude... who knows) and we were instantly seated. I was pretty annoyed, to be honest, because when we did go up to the stand, we saw several open tables and then they had crossed off names below ours on their list and it seemed that we were completely overlooked. Gee, thanks. 

So anyway. We were seated outside on the patio, which had a beautiful view. Our server came by quickly to get our drink order then a few minutes later came back with said drinks and took our food order. Then came more waiting! Hooray! 30 minutes. 45 minutes. Almost got to that wonderful 60 minute point without our food. I ordered a regular burger and my boyfriend ordered the elk burger. Both were served with fries (which the menu said they'd be ""seasoned"" fries, but they were not). My burger was ""OK"" at best. Boyfriend's burger was better. Fries were ok, but I was hoping for seasoned fries. 

The restaurant itself is nice looking and has a beautiful view. It's loud inside, but there's a nice patio that's not as loud. 

The service... not good. The food... over priced. It's convenient for post-hike food & beers but I think I'd rather make the drive back to Vegas to get food rather than return here to Mt Charleston Lodge Restaurant.",vQxahO21JB6-C32lYgcHaQ,4,0,2,qWtKgKKzMLX5Qf24x-uA-w
5772777,2017-09-20,0,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"I have loved coming to the Lodge since I first arrived in Vegas 16 years ago.... however, after the service - or rather lack thereof - we received today, I may never come back again. I don't remember the last time I've had such an excruciating experience. 

I decided to take my 2 year old grandson and our two dogs to Mt Charleston for a quick excursion. When we arrived at the lodge, I made sure to ask the server to let the hostess know we were there so we could be seated. I took my grandson to the potty so he wouldn't have any accidents. We go back to the car to get the dogs and he pees right next to the car. No biggie. Pee happens. All the while, no hostess appears. (I was parked right next to the patio so well within view). I get the dogs and my grandson and wait for the hostess. I had to ask for her two more times. Two women show up with two dogs. It is crystal clear that I was there first. The hostess comes out and seats the two women first. I don't say anything. After all, it could just be a simple mistake, right? Although, the two women could have had the decency to tell the hostess of her mistake. 
The hostess seats us and I ask for some water - as I am with a toddler and trying to think of his needs beforehand. She comes back with a bowl of water for the dogs. Huh??? So I tell her I'd like some water for me and my grandson. Nothing. The bus boy comes by and I ask him for water and he brings it. Meanwhile, the two women already have water and drinks at their table, other people are getting seated and ordering drinks and my waiter hasn't even come to my table. 

I asked for a server THREE times before one finally came over. Again, all the other tables that came on after us are already getting their food and I haven't even been able to ORDER. My grandson is crying. I'm trying to keep him entertained. Two ladies (not the ones with the dogs that skipped us) gave us some French fries. So now I'm getting really upset. 

I go inside and ask for the manager. I start telling her what's going on. I'm not yelling or cursing, but I'm clearly agitated. This B tells me to CALM DOWN. I'm here thinking, are you kidding me right now???? My Peruvian Italian ass IS CALM! She didn't offer an apology or anything either. Wtf??? Manager says she's going to check on my food. 

Food comes out. The boy and I are eating... although he's over it now. In three seconds, he climbs the chair and almost face plants. Thank God for my chair catching skills. 

At no time, did the waiter, the manager, the busser, or the hostess come by to ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything. 

Finally the waiter comes around and asks if I want to order desert. Are you kidding me right now??? No, I don't want desert. I want my bill and I want to get out of here. I'm so embarrassed at the looks I'm getting from all the people. The waiter finally brings the bill and says he'll be back. No. No way. No chance. No how. I tell him I need to go and I go to pull out my wallet... and it's not in my purse. It's on the damn kitchen counter at home. Now I'm desperately trying to fight back tears. I ask him if I can pay with a check since I have my checkbook. (Mind you that they didn't have the near decency to even give me a discount for the atrocious service). One of the ladies that had given us some fries earlier, and had been watching everything that was going on, said, ""this is enough""... she grabbed my bill and said, ""you're not paying for this"".... she paid my bill and I thanked her. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. 

All I wanted was to have lunch with my grandson in one of my favorite places, away from all the chaos and craziness of life. However, after the way we were treated today, I will never step foot in the Lodge again until they change the management and the staff. Ever. I simply can't believe how horribly we were treated. 

Finally, to the bus boy, a big thank you for being the ONLY employee to try to help me... to the couple that was trying to help me keep my grandson entertained and offered  some of their chips and fries... and to the other couple that also gave my grandson some fries and paid our tab, THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.",KzEHXFjbayCxD12DR8ficA,3,2,1,jS-W32pt9IzJ2QkbN_VUmA
5802215,2014-11-24,3,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"Based on a few other reviews I've read it sounds like I'm not the only one to be thinking ""what exactly is going on here?"". There are all kinds of subtle absurdities...
- There is a hostess, which doesn't seem required since the place isn't that big, it's not a complex seating system, and...
- There are plenty of servers. You don't seem to have a dedicated server for your table, they somehow all float around and get things done, interchanging frequently with some kind of weird hive group-think
- There was a guy playing the guitar and singing some songs. Well, he mostly talked actually (very interactively with the crowd which was kind of far away). He also had a girl sitting behind him or standing by him who seemed to do nothing at all besides take a sip of wine periodically.
- They serve lots of special hot drinks, their signature being the Mt. Charleston Coffee with Drambuie, and some other stuff. Sounds cool, we get one...it comes out in a Stella (beer) glass. True, it is an adequate vessel to contain a liquid but it was the complete opposite of what you would expect this drink to arrive in
- My wife asks what the soup-of-the-day is. Was told the name which in no way described what the soup actually contained. It took some more questioning to learn this info. Server went to the other side of the table and those we were with asked the same question since the couldn't hear our convo. Same response. You'd think the server would just auto-fill with what was in this fancily named soup. Nope.
- We ordered the pretzel. The pretzel was awesome, big, salty, soft. But it came with this heinous fake cheese sauce that resembled plastic more than it did something edible. I'm no restaurateur but I don't think it takes a gourmand to think ""hey, how about I class this up with some whole grain mustard vice this alien cheeze-whiz stuff I've got going on.""

We love just taking a ride to Mt Charleston. We always stop in to walk around the little store they have inside and we have had dinner here a couple of times.
We love the pizza. It is really better than most pizza places! 
They do have some different items on the menu like Elk. I never had it but if you want to try they have it.
What is nice about coming here if you want to stay in one of their cabins they are next to this restaurant especially if the weather is bad or just as a weekend get away. 
It is not too far from Vegas but it is a whole different world here.
The summer you can sit outside and it is nice to come up here it is much cooler when it is over 100 in Vegas just as a nice getaway.
Just be careful there are lots of wild life on your way up to the Restaurant.

We wanted to escape the 117 temps down in Vegas so we drove up to Lee Canyon and discovered it was closed during the weekdays for summer hours. On our way down we stopped here for lunch. We ordered two alcoholic drinks, then a burger for me and a salad for my wife. Her salad was huge and she dove right in. Two bites in, she found a large dead fly on her plate. She was to disgusted with it and didn't want to swap it out for another dish. We showed the waiter and asked he take it back. He offered her another but she declined. He took it off the bill and gave us 15% off but I feel that wasn't enough. It pretty much ruined our afternoon and we stopped at a fast food place on the way home so my wife could get some lunch. I know accidents happen, but we won't return :( 


UPDATE: MANAGER read review and emailed me and provided us with a gift card to try again.

5862127,2014-07-27,0,XhgFynFD7ZT77wofWpeOag,"I need to eat gluten-free and sadly that is almost impossible here. As a day tripper you can get round it, but if you stay on the mountain in the adjacent cabins you don't have a choice of where to eat. It's here or the ""resort"" hotel and that's it.

I plumped for a NY Strip Steak which I have to say was rather good actually. Unfortunately I couldn't have the fries because they are seasoned and breaded. So instead my steak came with the tiredest, driest worn out baked potato I've ever encountered. Luckily for me the waiter was gracious enough to remove it from my plate and deduct the $1additional cost of the offending article. Yes, he actually picked it up off the plate in front of me!

The following evening, I hoped I could have something else. Running through the menu my eyes stopped on the chili; nope, the sauce is made with beer. How about the nachos? Nope. Pizzas? No. Fish and chips? Double no. BBQ ribs? No, because of the sauce. Salmon fillet with rice? Yes, but without the sauce it's horribly dry. Couscous? No, obviously. The millions of options that are deep fried and breaded? Clearly NO.

In the end, I chose a buffalo burger which was actually really delicious, even without fries, bun or baked potato.

They also offer breakfast, and again this is a festival of gluten, with the non-gluten options being bacon, eggs or an omelette.

I know g/f eaters are not a huge percentage of the population, but families with 1 or more g/f eaters won't go anywhere that the whole family can't eat. I would love to see management give a little more thought to the requirements of people like me. It wouldn't be that hard.
