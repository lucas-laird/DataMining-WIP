If that wasn't enough to get you in the door, the service was extremely nice and attentive to the needs of my kids.  We look forward to trying breakfast soon.",QW-BiJacnXWChzDkE0vzvw,2,1,5,6vDw-ABLzLweUpC5avb_qQ

Prices are incredibly reasonable, food is wonderful, and the staff is so friendly and attentive.

The Flight Decks' location across Las Vegas Blvd from Town Square gives the added bonus of a Strip view. With an impressive menu which boasts a wonderful array of outside the box appetizers like fried green tomatoes and gourmet burgers & sandwiches, plus breakfast selections all day, I would like this newer eatery to remain my own secret dining spot, but I am certain it won't be hidden away for much longer. I thoroughly enjoyed my gourmet burger, fries, spinach salad w hot bacon dressing and tea. I shall return!",nBenF2ly5Ig285-9u_1EXA,0,0,5,zIiwh4SRb958rNxDiIKUdQ
1956220,2016-01-09,1,Pd52CjgyEU3Rb8co6QfTPw,The first time we ate here everything was good.  Since that first we have tried it four more times.  The service and the food have been a big disappointment.  On the last visit I had to return my burger because it was not cooked.  When they brought it back it had an unusual odor but I ate it anyway.  Sick for three days.  Great location but we wont eat here again.,7Iga45IMB_VKyPZnbhSE2w,1,0,1,3recIhisA9vC4wnQOMCj7g
2290477,2016-11-17,2,Pd52CjgyEU3Rb8co6QfTPw,"Awesomely constructed carnitas nachos! With cheese sauce and beans! And they're only $6 during happy hour (remember there are 2 HHs here - one in the morning and one in the afternoon).

Also an incredible $6 wing special as well (mentioned in my first review) and I always ask that they smash the hottest buffalo and BBQ sauces together when I order them. 10 jumbo wings means 60-cent wings every day if you happy hour here. 

Really delicious Huevos Rancheros available all day. The kitchen here is something else!

Their ""Flight Deck Lager"" is a draft beer made for Taylor Made by Anheuser-Busch, and is similar to a Cass or OB beer but a bit lighter, with a clean aftertaste. It's $3/pint all day long.

Great, friendly service every time. And a bright, airy, north-facing environment with a horizonal view of the Strip and plenty of HDTVs, this is a *perfect* starting point for any bachelor, bachelorette or reunion weekend. Not to mention there's a full-fledged driving range 10 feet in front of you. (Locals: ask about the amazing bottomless bucket of balls special.)

Always easy parking, spotless bathrooms and friendly staff. Gotta love corporate-owned gone right! 

This place should be packed, and I'm always surprised to see when it's not! For now, it's our little secret...",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,1,3,5,Uiwl8hZaIzTUJ1zpaNuP6Q

Nice view and actually you can seat at the patio site. Staffs are nice and very friendly. I saw some  tourist comes enjoying view and hang out at the range area.
Atmosphere is clean and welcome to everyone even if you are not a golfer.",bZnjSVQApjVHrAV9jjtH_A,2,3,4,nNUaNk8s0elCDn6vjnpqSw

Staff and owner were very Golf friendly had great atmosphere and wonderful menu. New staff is not golf friendly and doesn't have same golf atmosphere. Taylor made should address this. Menu and prices are not as good as previous owners. Took way to long to get good and my appetizer came out with meal

Waitress says cooks not here he is late. I asked if she has apple juice and ice tea, apple juice for my daughter. She shot me a look and in a dismissive voice says we don't have any.  I said forget it and left. How bout ya don't open if you don't have a cook? How about you are at a driving range you need some kind of something for kids. Not all kids drink soda. Get it together, get some people who care.",IvBzaJeCcuChLuKGq3xhxA,1,0,2,18i3YtCuEGMxYSS7fQdR8Q

The atmosphere is casual and relaxing. The view of the Strip is a plus.There are numerous TV's to watch sports.
