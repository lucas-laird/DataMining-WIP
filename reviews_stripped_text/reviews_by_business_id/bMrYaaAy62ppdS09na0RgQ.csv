34590,2016-03-20,2,bMrYaaAy62ppdS09na0RgQ,"HORRENDOUS customer service. LOUD, grating environment with endless shouting. 

This 1-star review is because of the attitude and the mouth on the main cashier, clearly a New Yorker in his 40's. When we ordered our food he was not very friendly, which is the ""authentic attitude"", I suppose, but as my dine-in experience progressed, his volume and language became increasingly outrageous. 

Three times he apologized on the phone for mistaking orders; he referred to another unhappy customer as ""a bitch with the tiramisu"". 

Twice they made my girlfriend the wrong pizza. TWICE! Then, when she asked for the garlic knots we ordered, he mumbled under his breath ""I'll kill you"". EXCUSE ME??? You'll kill your customer for asking for the food we ordered!?!? 20 seconds later, our garlic knots arrived, still hot, indicating that they were sitting in the kitchen and possibly not served to us on purpose.

I will not be patronizing a restaurant with this level of abuse in customer service. ""Authentic New York-style"" or not, there is NO EXCUSE for any of this cursing and venom.

The pizza was ok, garlic knots were good, but I'd advise that you order online if you must have this pizza.",Eiviv8zwIzhRMngtno5HdA,2,0,1,vL7eREbP1cesCVa_LGZbUQ

618369,2015-07-03,1,bMrYaaAy62ppdS09na0RgQ,"Ok. I changed my mind about this place. I orderdd tonight. 1 large roni, chicken parm sub w a side of sauce and a bag of zeppolis. This place is so foul now, they should do theirselves a favor and stick to the dent wizard business which their car is always parked in the cleaners spot. 
The pizza is not NY style, their service sux like A-rod, and they dont even have a bathroom. 
Their pizza took about 40 mins to make. It is legitimately cardboard. They should change their name is cardboard house of pizza. It was 15 dollars. The chicken parm sub was ok but no side of sauce. The 6 dollar bag of zeppolis had about 10 little zeppolis. I called them and asked how many were supposed to come in the order. She said 6-7. I got ten so i guess i scored. For 6 bux, what a joke. They taste like puke. Their pizza cant stay hot bc it is so thin. 
I called and the girl said, sir i dont make the prices, im just the register girl. Now i know why she is just the register girl. My wife picked up the pizza w our 3 year old who had to use to the restroom bc it took so long. She asked if they had a bathroom, they said no and referred her to the chinese food place next door. I find it hard to believe they dont have a working restroom. Overall, this place is a pathetic excuse for a new york pizza place. We already didnt like going bc the guy would try to upsell u 17x when all u want is a slice. It took them about 2 years to open and now i know why, they have no idea what they r doing.

1. The online ordering service is poorly designed and makes ordering a pepperoni pizza extremely difficult. You are stuck making special adjustments to the items hoping they come out right. The descriptions are lacking.
2. I waited 90 minutes after ordering before calling the location to inquire about the wait. The employee was unapologetic. I tipped 5 in advance and can't get that back.
3. By the time it finally arrives Im about 3/4 through a bag of chips I got from the gas station during my wait and moment of desperation. The pizza I received was a disappointment. The white pizza promised fresh basil and mozzarella and did not deliver. The ricotta was an unusual texture. My other pizza had unwanted toppings, which ironically just slide off the crust to where they belong.. The garbage.
4. Ultimately the most important factor is the crust. There is an expectation that comes with New York style, and this crust was a cookie cutter press out on a wire screen. The evidence is on the bottom- an imprint of the lazy pizza makers short cut. Leaving me with a chewy cracker instead of a pizza crust.

They have a Sunday-Wednesday $8.99 pick-up special, a two slice + drink $5 lunch special, offer the usual pizzeria dishes, slices, some desserts, and they deliver. Will definitely try a regular pie and maybe a white slice next time.

The pizza order was an absolute disaster. Never, never, never again will we order from this place. We order at least twice a week from Sabatino's, Angelina's, Red Rock and the favorite of all Rocco's!!! When I called to let them know Johnny (who took the original order) answered again. I told him to forget sending another pizza, we just wanted a refund and wanted to speak to a manager.
Guess who was the manager?? Johnny was it!! To my amazement I let him know that we would not be ordering from there again and that I would be Yelping, as that's what Yelpers do.
He did offer to send the correct order, but unfortunately after trying the wings we did receive, we said ""no way"". The wings were not edible. 
He did give us a full refund, and he also apologized for the error. However, when you make an order to go, you expect to get what you ordered. As a manager you should be checking every single order going out to ensure it is correct. 
I just can't allow spending ""hard worked money"" and not getting what I asked for. And not even close to what I asked for. I ordered a thin crust and received a thick crust. Are you serious?

What makes a great pizza? Is it the dough, water or is it that special ingredient that has been passed down generation to generation? 

Located along West Lake Mead and Del Webb rd, House of Pizza will have you wanting that extra slice every time. Ordering the Works pizza to go, I was honestly a little surprised at the layout and effort that has gone into this place. It really does seem like a pizza joint staight out of a corner of the big apple.

The dough of the pizza was actually one of the best parts, the crust was soft and really had a nice flavor to it. The ingredients seem to be fresh with a decent serving. I will recommend some of the pastries they offer. I'm not sure if they are made onsite or not but the custard pastry was amazing.  

A nice flat screen is on the wall that shows whatever game is on and the soda selection is quite extensive. Also I over heard the owner saying that the recipes were his grandfathers.

Not a bad little find House of Pizza. Service and quality of pizza is something I look forward to eating again soon.

A step up from the fast food places, but without spending $20+ on each pizza. I, also, wanted some variety. In my research I came across House of Pizza.

I went the day before to scope out the location in case I lived outside of the delivery radius AND to try a few slices before ordering for my party. The blonde girl running the counter was pretty great. She answered all my questions about ordering for the next day, and seemed eager for my business. She said if I was ordering a lot, they would deliver outside of the 5 mile radius & they only needed an hour or so of notice...things like that. The slices I tried weren't part of the 2 slices & a soda special for $4.50 (that's only for cheese?). I tried the white & the pepperoni. Honestly, they looked a bit dried out behind the glass case, but the same girl warmed them up for me...and they were delicious...AND HUGE. For my 2 (non cheese) slices and a bottle of water the bill was under $7.

It is kind of a small place with very little seating. And, it is on a section of W Lake Mead I just never go to (until now). They also have very nice expensive take out menus. I used to work in commercial printing many moons ago, so this detail was not lost on me...heavy cardstock, double sided color, glossy!!! LOL

On the day of my party we called at 5pm and were adamant about a 630pm delivery, and they assured us it would be on time...and it was! They had sent an extra sausage pizza ""just because"" along with tons of parmesan & crushed red pepper packets and paper plates. We ordered 2 cheese, a meat lovers, a veggie, and a buffalo chicken. All large. Again, the slices are pretty huge...for all the bill was $86 plus tip. There were 14 people at the party and we still had over a whole pizza's worth left over. Everything was hot and delicious...and on time with extras!!! Several people emailed me afterward asking for the name of the pizza place because it was so good. I will, also, add I do not like anything even a little spicy, but I LOVED the buffalo chicken pizza!!! I HIGHLY recommend ordering that one. And, I never eat sausage, but their sausage pizza was delicious.

It was an all around bad experience. We won't be returning.,Sv-FJn3-mnwFecRfhJOvQg,3,0,1,284P2Kz9LCqb85i0Rvky0g

Mike was very gracious and kind when we spoke.  He would not allow me to pay for the new pie and even insisted on throwing in some Coke and an eclair.  The pizza was good with a ton of toppings, the crust is outstanding!  I'll be back.",_x2w5bP1t6nE2pOA8HbvTg,3,0,4,DCQ80c3yCZlrI1V4USJNVQ

Recently brought up in conversation as one of the ""Top 10"" pizzas in the city, House of Pizza - New York Style on West Lake Meade Boulevard clearly warranted a look considering its proximity to home and the assertion of transplants that a ""good slice"" was nowhere locally to be found, the results far from justifying any such accolades while the scene itself was undeniably one of the most bizarre in town.

Located in the same small shopping plaza as the amusingly named New York Chinese Restaurant, House of Pizza is immediately identifiable due to the blaring voice of Frank Sinatra emitted from an outdoor speaker and not-so-subtle window painted signage, entry just past 11:15am seeing music give way to equally loud CNN political discourse as wall-to-wall Yankees memorabilia quickly flooded the visual field.

Just opened at 11am, a few pies already cooling on racks as a small menu hangs overhead, it was with greetings from the lone clerk that the ordering process was sorted, the owner and a friend sitting idly at a table, talking over the television before pulling out a wad of money and counting it in the dining room as though there was no one but the two of them to be bothered.

Offering several ""deals"" for slices plus beverages, none of which applied to a $1.59 bottle of water that was offered as the only option in the face of a request for a cup from the tap, further financial insult was added when the clerk neglected to add a 10% Social Media discount before running the credit card despite fully acknowledging it twenty seconds earlier, an offer to cancel and reprocess refused as $2.54 hardly seemed worth the hassle and potential double charge.

Taking a seat amidst the ongoing Mob-like scene of bills being filed into white envelopes it was at most five minutes before the two plastic clamshells were delivered tableside, a $4 filled-to-order Cannoli joining Tiramisu from the refrigerator with each pleasant, though nothing worth writing home about, the rest of the order emerging from the kitchen after just a few more moments.

At this point frankly amused by the fact that one person was acting as cashier, clerk, prep-cook and server the scene grew even more perplexing when the young lady was charged with the task of driving down to Starbucks to buy the owner ""a Caramel Macchiato - the biggest one they got,"" the four-part order quickly discovered to be vastly underheated as relates to the Grandma Square and Sicilian while the Knots and Pepperoni Slice were both hot.

Now left with just the owner and his counting, a question of ""you good?"" offered before he returned to the back, first bites of the slice showed a complete lack of char but generally good crust structure and Tomato Sauce, the Garlic Knots featuring a pleasant bit of ""chew"" compared to most while the aforementioned lack of heat significantly compromised both of the thicker wedges, though even if well-cooked they'd have fallen far short of the quality at Metro Pizza, Cugino's, Pizza Rock and many more.

**  Perhaps not their best showing, though not really excusable as I was not only the first customer of the day but also the only one present throughout my stay, House of Pizza falls far short in almost every way possible, particularly in a city with so much great Pizza to be found at a variety of price ranges.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,5,2,beHEFTKncI1tIgUrC2qvPQ

5326313,2016-03-13,1,bMrYaaAy62ppdS09na0RgQ,"I was contemplating writing a review for a while now. This place had a shaky start, got really good, and then tanked because of their lack of delivery and new employees. 

We recently tried them again and as I was walking in the owner was hiring two new delivery people. He had brand new delivery decals and equipment (like those black padded bags for keeping the pizza hot). It was refreshing to see that he cared enough to really listen to the customers and bring back delivery. 

We ordered a few slices of pizza and meatballs. Everything was on point. The cheese is amazing, the sauce is fresh, and the thin crust is crisp. There is no better pizza in town and I'm glad we can start going back here.",PazA0-jaDSSoV0VbzJWsDA,3,0,5,pmfgTztWPRSKPugcNomy5g

5495315,2016-08-23,1,bMrYaaAy62ppdS09na0RgQ,"Being a born and bred New Yorker and having eaten in so many Pizzarias I've lost count,I have one question regarding this place.  How do you call yourself a New York style pizza shop and cook your pies on a Dominos style belt oven?
I have never seen NY style pizza cooked on a belt.  It is always cooked in a deck oven which is what gives it a distinctive char and chew.
I tried this place and the pizza is bland and has no texture.  The guy behind the counter whose name was ""Magic"" (go figure) had the nerve to compare his pies to L&B Spumoni Garden in Brooklyn NY.  Are you kidding me? Anyone who knows NY pizza knows L&B knows there is n o comparison.
Get over yourselves guys.  You're not that good.  You're a step above Domino's and that's not saying much.  You only get 2 stars because your pizza was edible.",L0AoWLv7jUmM_rfDlq_Msg,3,1,2,v1AOo2JagfMCKbor9WJxrQ

Why offer half and half pizza if you don't know what it means?  And, considering they're less than 2 miles from my place, my food should not have been stone cold.

Updated- I called to tell them about the pizza being cold, sauceless and rubbery.. Guy on the phone didn't give a royal hell and I asked to speak to a manager.. He's not there. 8pm on a Friday? Hmm ok. Asked him to have him call me. Never did.",nny2I0oKEtUzS24gyk02xw,1,0,1,7PDksxqdoN97YFiz24LpXA

We were fortunate enough to meet Vinny, one of the owners who couldn't possibly have made us feel more welcome. Even their desserts are made in house and they're SO GOOD!!
