And of course she opted yes, as she was still hungry. (her first dish was was the pho , & it was so horrible she could not even complete one bite). When our check came they still charged her for both meals!! Even meal that she NEVER even ate!!! They said it could not be deleted& they would call the police. Even Taco Bell refund your money when you are not pleased ... Really? I guess our first sign should had been when we noticed we were the only customers at prime lunch hour....

200084,2012-02-25,2,ZBPwZv0QFWF9QGyR7LbIsA,"Atmosphere: Very empty. I guess I know why now.

Service: Service is okay. The waiters don't understand English very well, so you have to explain how you want the food done many times, and then they still mess up.

Food: Pho is decent. Spring rolls are okay. The fried chicken is gross. They didn't have any stirfriend because ""the stirfry is broken."" whatever that means.  Oh yah, for an extra plate of beef steak slices, (6 small pieces), it's $4.50!!!

Drink: No comment since only got water. 

Bottom Line: 
Food is okay.  Not bad if you take the food however they make it.  But difficult if you want them to do something different, like take out the onion, or put in more meat. Extremely expensive extra meat for pho.",KMH0-vcV0atzuNN0LABsRQ,0,0,3,QMBVHjrUCJR726Ln9ZMTeQ

Service is alright (depending on who's working).  It's pretty pricey and the soup bowl is kind of small compared to other places.  One thing I really love from here are their vietnamese sandwiches.  I prefer the pork because it is more tasty than the beef and it is very affordable around $3.50 a sandwich.

1282885,2015-11-26,0,ZBPwZv0QFWF9QGyR7LbIsA,"I've been here before and I remember it being good food with decent service.  Stopped by here recently with the family again.  Was seated right away.  While walking to our table, I did notice that half their tables were  full of dirty dishes.  No one seems to bus tables here.  

So I ordered a rice dish with pork chop, eggloaf and shredded pork.  It was good. I actually liked the pork chop.  It had a nice sweet glaze on it.  Wifey and son had a simple bowl of pho.  My parents each ordered pho also.  Each item we got was $7.99.

So while we were waiting for our food, I noticed these 3 little kids cleaning the tables.  The youngest one was probably 4 or 5, no joke. My wife and I were like....WTF?!

After we were served, which didn't take too long.  But then again, the restaurant was pretty empty.  I go up and ask for the bill.  They didn't give me an actual bill.  The guy just told me the total was $51 dollars.  I actually did some calculating while I was eating.  I ordered 5 items at $7.99 each..So thats $39.95.  Tax rate for restaurants in Vegas is 8.1%.  That comes out to $43.18.  So how the heck did he get to $51 dollars?  Whatever.  I just paid it and left.

Afterwards I read some of the other reviews on this restaurant and found out that this is not the only time the restaurant has ripped off a customer.  Apparently they overcharge several customers regularly.

To make matters worse, I learned (afterwards) that they were shut down not too long ago from health department.  Are you kidding me?!  There's a video of them on Dirty Dining.  Check it out.

So we had decent food.  But kids cleaning tables, overcharged for our food, and shut down by health department.  That's a definite NO-RETURN in my book.",BAAFYijEbFgJbVVYh2XE-w,4,0,1,AmwCpNO6qF5V5PQwaYNH7A

1466793,2014-08-07,0,ZBPwZv0QFWF9QGyR7LbIsA,"there are 3 Pho places between sunrdige hieights and the 2-15 that I know of. Pho Mai lan, Pho Saigon 8 and this place. Out of the 3 this is by far the best. The Pho here is the most authentic out of the 3. Pho mai lan is just like plain beef broth no real Pho flavor. Pho Saigon 8 for some reason the broth is a bit sour if you taste it before adding the noodles, meat and veggies (once you add those things its good but it still doesn't have the true Pho flavor). This place Pho Little Saigon is definitely my go to place when I am to lazy to make my own traditional Vietnamese food at home. I just wish they delivered!!! Why is it that none of these places deliver?! they could make way more money!!!! Now that i'm done griping about delivery you really need to come here for some real authentic Pho. It is also the most reasonable in price! They also have a $4.99 Chinese lunch special. I really think you should skip the fast food and come here!!! Everyone is very nice and I am never disappointed with my order. just a bit sad they offer egg rolls and no true spring rolls! I got this place mixed up with Pho Saigon 8 so I need to go and adjust my review accordingly. I did think the Chinese menu wasn't all that great because I did it for take out and it was very soggy because they put the sauce on the sweet and sour and not on the side like most establishments have started practicing. So if you are ordering the Chinese portion that has batter with sauce I would certainly ask for the sauce to be put on the side. The fried rice is a bit too oily, I am really more a fan of the Vietnamese portion of the menu rather then the Chinese but I would still come here instead of for instance panda express. The lemon grass beef is better then the lemon grass chicken. it seems like the beef pickes up more of the lemon grass then the chicken does. but Pho sure you will never be disappointed with their awesome Pho!!! I give the Pho a 5 but the establishment a 4 because I think the Chinese portion is a 3!!! good luck in finding your perfect Pho place!!!",1wFyL5H_QDO3kGY9WSdndQ,0,0,4,fqLWeCwy9yHoCu9Dkk9YoQ

I had barley taken 2 spoonfuls of soup when they did this & she was asking if I wanted a to go container. I told her I would later. The hovering was just rude & annoying. I get you close @ 10 but there were a good 20 other people in the place & ot was like 9:40pm. They also forgot the sandwich we ordered & when we mentioned it she tried to say they were baking the bread for it because they make everyone of them from scratch. Give me a break you don't bake the french baguette upon order of a sandwich. Ordered seafood soup & it was just mediocre. Not a whole lot of flavor. Ordered the spring rolls & they were not freshly made. Servers kept eyeballing us to get us out of there making us feel uncomfortable so we finally took our food to go.

Usually most places I go to serve way too much noodles and like 4 pieces of meat, but this place is very generous with their portions. The reason I give it a 3/5 is because there was just a handful of downsides. 

CONS:
-the water taste disgusting; I advise to either get a canned beverage or BOTTLED water.
-the smell of the actual restaurant smells like old wet towels or a wet dog.
-the bean sprouts they serve on the side for your pho was super brown and grimey. You definitely could tell it was NOT fresh.
-there were obviously 3 people designated to be runners/servers, but two of them just sat around on their phone and had another bus/wait on the tables and it was fairly busy.

PROS:
-our waiter was attentive and super polite.
-a lot of parking spaces in the parking lot.

1953076,2010-12-22,6,ZBPwZv0QFWF9QGyR7LbIsA,"Craving pho this cold and rainy night and instead of Saigon 8 in Henderson, our usual pho restaurant, We decided to  try out Pho Little Saigon , which was across the street from Saigon 8.  

There were 4 other people in Little Saigon when we pulled up and there was lots of room with plenty of tables and chairs. First thing I noticed was the large chinese food menu right by the front door, hmmmm, I can feel my hopes being slightly dashed at this point , but we've made it this far, so we went on in. 

I ordered my usual  Noodle soup with rare eye round steak & beef meatballs and Tanya got her usual Grilled shrimps and sliced pork over vermicelli and vegetables for comparison against Saigon 8's. 

For my dish, the main complaint was broth wasn't as rich as I was used to and the meatballs had a different texture than what I was used to. Everything else was similar. For Tanya, her bbq pork was not as tasty and she ate something that tasted like bad fish (twice!) in her bowl. She could not figure out where that taste came from.  Prices are slightly higher than Saigon 8, for the exact same meal, we would have paid about $2 less across the street.",pf0PmYE6s-EjBWaeMeQXsg,5,3,2,5fYQN5yZWy1JF1gxIA1aJQ

2104744,2011-07-09,0,ZBPwZv0QFWF9QGyR7LbIsA,"Stopped by with my fiance on a friend's recommendation. Didn't scope out Yelp until we were done with our meal. We were both really surprised by the low reviews only because we had a good experience overall.

I sort of walked in knowing I'd be comparing them to Lemon Grass Cafe. I was craving a seafood egg noodle & veggie dish, so I ordered the #150 (with the noodles cooked soft). I'll admit the price was a dollar or two higher compared to Lemon Grass, but the potion size was at least double!...not to mention the dish had an over abundance of seafood. Such a bonus!! My left overs at Lemon Grass consisted of noodles and a few carrots. The left overs I took home from here was like a whole other entree, there was so much left. 

My fiance ordered the Chicken Pho. His initial comment was how he liked their Pho just a bit more only because he didn't prefer the meat balls that Lemon Grass added to their Pho. He did like both though. Little Saigon's Pho is only available in one size, which is equivalent to a large anywhere else. Good if you're hungry, but not so good if you're used to having options.

Oh, and they offer Thai Tea with boba!! I'd never had boba added to mine before. Love it!

That being said....

I am a fan of Pho Little Saigon.  Sure the atmosphere leaves lots to be desired (the last time I was there the TV's were off and the manager was at a table watching an Asian comedy TV show on BLAST on his laptop) and the service is average (you pay at the register but they decline to tell you that), but if you are looking for a quick, hot bowl of Pho with all the fix-ins, Little Saigon delivers.

Typically I order the #32 (rare steak and beef ball) and #34 (rare steak, flank and tripe) and both are solid.  Tripe is generally scary to eat but it blended well in the huge bowl of noodles, broth, rare beef, mint, sprouts, onions and whatever else they find to put in those bowls.  My biggest complaint is that the flank steak is very fatty and it typically takes some time to get rid of the fat before you get to dig in to the soup.  I am not sure if the flank is always served that fatty (again, refer to my noob status), but it is a small price to pay for a nice inexpensive meal.

Soups run around $7.50 and there are lunch specials for $5.99 but you need to ask for that menu when you sit down.",NRGJ4IvauajqqCbhT640cw,2,1,3,WPfxlSew_kVukHfradLsFA

First impression: cafeteria vibes. We were glad that there were plenty of tables open. Tables are numbered to keep tabs of orders and your check. Pay at the register. I actually dug the simplicity of the place. Get in, get out! No frills. 

To start, we had the GOI CUON TOM, fresh shrimp rolls (2 pieces). I thought they were okay, I had to slather on the peanut sauce in order to taste anything. Their iced water had an odd taste, to me it smelled like bleach, so I asked for some canned coconut juice. I don't know if they were trying to up-sell, but they only had fresh coconut. I'm glad I took it -- refreshing!

We opted for small sized servings, which was plenty. I decided on the PHO TOM (shrimp) and my dad ordered the PHO HAI SAN (seafood). We were given the standard plate of veggies to share: bean sprouts, jalapeño pepper slices, basil, lime. Pretty good. My dad also tried their taro boba to-go, but he said it was too sweet.

I've been here a few times already and the food has been pretty decent, but what I find noteworthy is the service.

I've been to both, and I can say the people at Pho Little Saigon are way nicer. 

I've had the traditional Vietnamese dinner here with the Tamarind soup and the braised fish. The employees let us know that the soup wasn't going to have all the ingredients that we expect from the traditional meal since herbs and other vegetables are scarce/expensive. Going out of their way to buy the proper ingredients would lead to them being tossed out because the clientele typically stick to what they are familiar with.

It was a bit on the soapy tasting side. I ended up using A LOT of hoisen sauce to get some sort of flavor, other than the soap taste I felt like I was receiving. They do give you a good amount of meat and definitely a good size bowl of Pho for the price. In Seattle, it would be about $8 for what they call their regular sizes, so that was a plus.

It's a pretty well kept place. It's got tacky paintings up that have nothing to do with an Asian restaurant, but then again, it's an Asian restaurant (no racism intended!! I'm the most Asian girl you'll ever meet). Lol. While eating here, I was reading the reviews about what other people said and how they don't like that they don't tell you that you need to come up and pay. That wasn't an issue for me because almost every Pho place I've been to, they require you to walk up to the register and pay when you're done. When walking in, I didn't see a sign that said ""cash only"" though. And apparently this place is cash only. If my friend didn't get up and secretly pay for all of us, I would of been in trouble because I rarely ever carry cash on me. So, maybe I missed the sign, but it is cash only for those of you who don't ever carry cash and need the heads up.

It was a bit sour, as if it was old. I wasn't asked how the food was after the meal, and the guy who served me (came from the kitchen to take my order) was very rude. The hostess was very sweet, but she didn't take my order. 

Find somewhere else to go, this was a major disappointment.",3pbkIutK-A1Gm3SAOGbFow,0,0,1,KqxgDsZwm5CbgRteNZCNWw

Still, we came here one day because Pho Saigon 8 wasn't open yet. 

The pho broth was really whatever. It was really watery and not that flavorful. I also ordered the banh xeo (Vietnamese pancake) which was greasy and soggy, not at all crispy. 

I would much rather go to Pho Saigon 8 or Pho Mai Lan, which are both better and cheaper than here.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,1,0,2,s6QEhZgZpO1eRkCRsZ5JRg
