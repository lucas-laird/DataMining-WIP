However two of the orders at my table were messed up I asked for the banana foster brioche and got a couple slices of banana. So that was kind of upsetting. And we asked for cheese on hash browns and the first time didn't get it. The second time they put it on the eggs.

You stand in line for about 10 minutes with the hopes of being noticed and no one notices you. Until you have to approach an IHOP employees and suggest if they are willing to give you a sit in or not. Since nobody has noticed you stand in line for about 15 minutes. A restaurant is nothing without courtesy and excellent customer service. I have nothing against the employees because as of right now they are working hard to make sure everyone is getting what they need and request. But towards IHOP I am very disappointed.

Third of all, he doesn't deal with customer concerns very nicely, several people had asked him why he was sitting larger parties instead of them. And trust me I get it.

The service, no matter where the establishment is located should still be consistent across a chain like this.

I do not know what he was going through personally or if he was simply gazing out the window wondering what his other options where apart from the service industry. What ever his issue was our order(in my party of three) was incorrect. Two out of the three specials ordered were served with the incorrect food items. I had to wait and wait and wait and oh yeah wait for him to come back for me to inform him of the issue. I asked for the correct food on my order again had to wait. When the second order finally came it was not cooked to my request. The bacon wasn't crispy like I requested and the eggs were too runny. I know the cooks/chefs in the back know how to prepare the food correctly, the order was simply not communicated correctly. I ended up sending it back and leaving hungry. The management didn't even bother addressing the issue either. Needless to say I will not be returning to this location. Get it together Vic!",mTZIZkzVGBBQVSub9nlLwQ,1,0,1,t58SZQvbUVKLq_62ZMLzSw

We come here at least once a month at around 1pm. For two years, we haven't gotten a very good experience with them but we don't complain and kept going because it's close to our church. Today however is different or worse than usual. I asked if they would honor the birthday freebie emailed to me while showing it from my phone and the guy at the reception said yes. We ordered our food which was almost the same every time except for the pancakes that come with the meal when you choose their specials. My husband's breakfast was served COLD , my eggs were raw when I ordered for over medium and I got the wrong crepes. Still, we were very patient and asked for what we initially ordered. My two kids and husband were already done eating when they finally gave me the crepes. Then came the bill and everything was ala carte as opposed to the special meal combos that we were pointing at on their menus while we were placing orders. Of course it was more expensive which we could afford but just surprised because it's not exactly what we have expected as that was not the price of what we have ordered. Then another lady in red which seemed to be th crew chief asked us if we were okay. And that they won't honor the freebie for myBIRTHDAY. This is a birthday bonus you give your customers. It is not the ONLY item we ordered for and we are willing to pay for. I don't understand the attitude that they were pulling. Then the guy at the check out was telling us that the waitress is new. We don't even blame her. The kitchen screwed up our meal. The manager could have easily straightened it out but won't. Needless to say, we did PAy for what we ate but we will NEVER go there again not because of the price nor the food but the behavior of the staff who could have been sincere in giving a good service if not excellent and should have been sincerely apologetic for their bad service. 

P/.S 9 out of 10 time we went there, the waiting for the food is always long . Today is no different . Just saying it matter of factly.",9pe2TiGGtsOIbzAFlU6FAA,2,1,1,0oWYLtWAGHbMuzHvemyILA

This IHOP is pretty much the same ol' thing: Pancakes, omellettes, and an occasional loiterer trying to hit everybody up for some change to ""catch the bus"".  Nonetheless, this IHOP was good in terms of quality of food and large group accommodation.  The service was a bit slow but we came a busy night and there were other drunks in the crowd so maybe they just had to spend some extra time trying to decipher the slurring and drunk bar jargon?  But the gentleman was nice and refilled our drinks often so I really don't have too much to complain about.  If the service was a bit faster, this place would've got the five star treatment from me.

Great place
I will NOT be coming back here.
Saturday morning just before 10am and this place was not to busy at all. Still not coming back.
Finally got my food and my eggs had more cheese then eggs, it was the egg Scrabble. So if u want cheese for breakfast this is the meal for you.
Its to bad that they have a cook or cooks in the back that give the restaurant and servers a bad rap.
Maybe this place needs a new cook.
Or maybe a manager since all heis doing is hiding around corners.
One last thing there was a young girl asking for donations $5.00 a children's hospital and we were happy to do that and they give u a $5.00 coupon toward ur breakfast. The lady gives us our bill and they charged us again for the donation instead of taking off the $5.00.

I've gone into places where the manager is just so involved in the customers this place is not that way at all. This manager either needs to greet customers and stop hiding or this place needs to to find a new person to manage this location.",q_GNUKJXBlMnuezCaxTNOw,0,0,1,cuggcLmvIJktm1-W-Blf-Q
4374020,2014-03-11,0,d2rFJ3_8ux87uyZVFGmlag,"Usually my experiences at IHOPs are pretty decent, but this time it just wasn't pleasant. 

The positives are of course a nice variety of items. You aren't stuck with pancakes at lunchtime and you aren't limited to soups, salads, and entrees at dinnertime. Our waiter was friendly, however it seemed obvious that he was too busy to handle his section and that he needed help, but I saw no-one was willing to assist him, even though there was a bored looking hostess up front playing with her hair and not washing her hands after digging in her scalp, gross. 

So I ordered an egg white omelet with sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, and spinach, with a side of banana pancakes and hash browns, didn't seem too complicated. When our food came out, I was disappointed to see that there was no cheese melted inside my omelet, it was a single slice of cheese melted on top. In my opinion that's just lazy, plus a square of cheese on top a long omelet looks silly. Also, there was no tomatoes in my omelet, as well as regular eggs, not egg whites. Additionally, they forgot to bring my hash browns, and my pancakes came without the bananas and cold with a block of ice cold butter on top.

I used to be a server so I tried to be very patient with everything so I politely asked another server (since ours was too busy) to take the omelet back. She did with a smile and our waiter stopped by shortly after and apologized for his mistake, which was actually a nice thing to do. About 6 minutes later, my omelet comes out, and it's technically correct, but still unappetizing. they just gave me an egg white shell with some spinach and mushrooms mixed in, with again, a block of now unmelted cheese on top, and uncooked poorly sliced tomatoes on top as well. 

At this point I'm pretty upset but still calm and patient because I felt that causing a big scene would do more harm than good. The server came by, told a few jokes, and dropped our check. No-one checked on us between bites, and the manager came by once after I pushed away my half eaten plate, asking if we were okay as she kept walking away. Time to pay..

I go up to the host/cashier and ask if our checks could be split down the middle, since my girlfriend and I like to share the bill. With an attitude she tells me that she can just split it by what we ordered. Even with old Micros systems, you are able to do the math and authorize a card by the dollar amount but she was too lazy to do so. We payed our bill which was not discounted and left. I'm a manager in the food industry. I know how things work. The only apology or acknowledgement we received was from our busy server, and no manager stopped by to apologize and let us know that we were being taken care of.

I can honestly say that this was the worst experience we've had eating in awhile. To come into a restaurant with barely ten tables seated, a host scraping her scalp and not washing her hands and touching peoples menus, to a server that's too busy to handle his station, to food that comes out wrong and is lazily made, to an incompetent cashier with an attitude, I can say that I will stay away from IHOP for awhile and NEVER return to this location again.",SJskhjbY1VPfL8ej0fYPdA,1,0,1,FArAfvNhKZPg4JV98C0XEw

Whenever I go late at night, I have sudden cravings to eat certain meals... cravings usually caused by how soused I am. So sometimes I go in there and I need something greasy and unhealthy, and I pick the appetizer sampler. You get mozaralla sticks, onion rings, and chicken fingers. Plus, you should be cool and order all the sauces they have to dress up your fine, fine meal. I like ranch, marinara, and honey mustard.

Then waited 20-25 minutes for the waitress to tell us from across the room that there are 2 tables ahead of us and she would come get our order when she had time. Wish there were negative stars to give.",UyIqpo9N-zzroG8PK_epvw,0,0,1,KlK0nox1LlWKZ8iebC1rPg

We stood right next to the hostess podium, and were told ""we'll be right with you"" for about five minutes, while the hostess continued to seat people who were just coming in through the door. They seated four brand new parties while we stood there waiting. Sooo we ended up having a nicer, less expensive, quieter breakfast at the PT's down the street.",1Qo3Pw-XRPaaNfpGPmmORA,1,0,1,zRCQTS1Zeg8UA4eJW-G2QA

It took us asking a manager for one of his employees to help us . Poor poor service here,JVhrYUCpRt0qYW3GaiAMxg,1,0,1,h5PRmiw6Ip17oxPq6nIu2w

We were greeted well and felt at home by Ashley and Laura was very quick and accurate as our server.  Perfect trip to an IHOP.,14AtoV_RS6VHP9ZpnhtE8A,1,1,5,gdZ2kOVZmycstpQXgKZoxw
