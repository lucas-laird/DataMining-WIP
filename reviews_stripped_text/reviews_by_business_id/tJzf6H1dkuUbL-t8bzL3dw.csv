20781,2013-01-02,1,tJzf6H1dkuUbL-t8bzL3dw,"Carve is a steakhouse-restuarant for those who want a more formal ambience without the pretentious uptight atmosphere found in some ""dressy"" restaurants. 

I'll start with the attire since it might be an issue to some people. In general there appeared to be customers from the casino or more smartly dressed people with jeans and a nice shirt so it's not very strict like some other establishments that require ""dressy attire"". Tidy overall though.

There is a very subdued low lighting, just enough to see the table and others around you. You never feel like you're in the dark though, just right for ambience. It was also pretty quiet so you could easily talk with others without resorting to vocal cord abuse. 

The service was very good as others have mentioned. A nice bread basket arrived with a variety of sweet and white bread as well as a very tasty crisp bread, looked like tacos but it might have been parm crisps. 

We started off with fried calamari as an appetizer: big portion but I was somewhat disappointed with the crust, tasted the same as the mozzarella sticks on TGI Fridays. Not bad tasting, just expected more.
We also ordered a Caprese salad which truly stood out.. The fresh mozzarella was so soft, moist and creamy and combined with the vinaigrette it created this mild antithesis of textures of flavors.

For the main dish we ordered the famous prime rib that Carve is known for. It is available in 3 sizes: 12, 16 and 20 oz. Frankly we did not notice much size difference between the 12 and 16 oz. The prime rib itself though was a revelation. Very soft and juicy, with sweet fat portions, cooked to perfection. I am not a prime rib fanatic but I do enjoy well cooked prime rib and I have to say this was the best I had so far.

As far as the price goes, it came to roughly $35 per person (we did not order wine), which I think is very reasonable for the food quality and service. I will definitely visit again to try the other interesting dishes they have and I suggest you do too!",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,8,2,5,AKKIFPumzL2_sdltCi1DRg

I ordered the 18 oz Boneless Prime Rib for $23 and my wife had the Filet for $32.  I like the fact that you get a dinner salad and a side with your meal included in the price.  The high end steakhouse we were looking at was $60 just for the Steak with no sides.  I had Mashed Potatoes for my side and my wife tried the Au Gratin Potatoes.  The Mashed Potatoes didn't come with gravy, but I saved some of the butter that came with the very good basket of bread that came before our meal.  The Au a Gratin Potatoes were excellent.  The Prime Rib was so-so.  My wife really liked her Filet that had an herbed butter on top of it.  It was excellent.  One of these times I am going to finally start ordering a Filet because I am usually disappointed with the Prime Rib I get.

Our server was very good and he was very busy taking care of most of the tables in the room.  We would try Carve again.  I will just get the Filet next time.",10iB6N_cOacNMW6AiJpw3g,1,0,4,dmUx8U8lQ_83djD1yJ-mAw

Hubby and I live about five minutes from this place and we've always wanted to go, but we're cheap, so we always passed it up. Well, we sucked it up because it was my birthday and we decided to go to Carve because we actually have a free hotel night at the Eastside Cannery (review for this place to come!!).

We arrived at 7:15pm even though our reservations were for 7:30pm. We were seated immediately (sorry, I've dined at enough places that if I have to wait more than 10 minutes, then I've waited too long!) Within mere minutes, we were given glasses of water and yummy bread. After not more than a few more minutes, our drink order was taken and given a few minutes to look over the menu.  Altogether we ordered: 

* 2 sodas
* Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail (Three jumbo mutant size shrimp that Chris
   didn't want to share with me!)
* Blue Crab Cakes (Two fat crab cakes that I didn't want to share with 
  Chris because they were that yummy!) 
* House Salad (fresh and crisp, did NOT taste like it came from a bag
  from the grocery store!) 
* King Cut Prime Rib roast with mashed potatoes (mine - OMG melt
   in your mouth, worth the $21.99!!!) 
* 16 oz Tuscan Rib eye with baked potato (his - also melt in your 
   mouth, didn't want to share, didn't need any special sauce because
   it was flavorful and cooked JUST RIGHT!!!) 
* Broccolini with Garlic (side - I liked it, he's not a broccoli fan) 
* Asparagus Hollandaise (side - I loved it great compliment to the 
  meal) 
* 5 layer chocolate cake (his - this could've fed 3 people!! Priced at 
  $5.99, we at half, then the next day ate the rest!) 
* Crème Brulee (mine - custardy and sugary  heaven!)

I had to point out what we had because AFTER EVERYTHING (tax, discount and tip) we paid $66 and some change!! Where the heck else can you get this much food (quality food I may add) for this price? Everything was truly divine, the service was great and I'm glad that Chris enjoyed a real steakhouse!!! This place is affordable and I love patronizing restaurants where the staff is warm, friendly and know what real service (not fake like what I sometimes find on the Strip) and be treated as if we were high rollers! 

So go...RUN...don't walk to your computer and go to restaurant.com and buy a gift certificate to this place now!! Especially before they change their minds and take it off the website!!

1989317,2012-10-15,2,tJzf6H1dkuUbL-t8bzL3dw,"First, let me start by saying that the service here is impeccable. It's so 5-star that you won't believe it!

Unfortunately, the food doesn't get quite that high a rating. 

Started with delicious bread and butter; French, a parm crisp and a raisin bread. All were delicious. My water was kept filled the entire visit. 

Immediately got the warm spinach salad and it was lukewarm at best. I really like my warm to be warm, warm. Not so-so-not-really, warm. That's what this was. The vinaigrette was bitter and the bacon tasted processed, not real. The mushrooms were okay, but odd for a spinach salad, I thought. Distracting.

I asked for a bone-in steak and they told me they had Porterhouse. According to the menu it was the best steak on the menu. I ordered it medium rare.

When it came out it had the strangest dull sheen to it. It didn't even look like meat. It had the grill marks, but seriously, I was worried. I cut into it and it was medium, which I don't care for, but more toward the center it was better. 

The first thing I thought of when I took my first bite of steak was, this has to be the cheapest cut of meat I've ever eaten. Being a huge fan of steak I can immediately tell whether this is going to be okay or not. No, it wasn't. And, I disagree; $38 for a steak is NOT cheap. And, it's really expensive when it's this grade of meat. Which is, grade F for FAIL. 

For sides I had the baby button mushrooms. They were okay. It's hard to mess up a mushroom around me. I also had the vegetable risotto which was undercooked, but had really nice, big pieces of vegetables. Had it been more cooked it would have been awesome. 

I am not sure if I just got a bad cut of meat here, or what, but it doesn't hold a candle to the other steak places in Vegas, and for almost $87 for drinks, steak, sides and a tip, I feel like I got ripped off. 

I would not recommend, which is sad, because the restaurant and service are amazing.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,3,0,2,gudVMsGKK1-w45GnfGznfg

I am kinda conflicted and reluctant to share this secret gem with the world because now this restaurant will get even busier, but everyone should try prime rib like this once in their life - each cut is beautifully marbled and cooked to perfection, so tender you can cut it with your fork.  Their filet mignon is just as perfectly prepared and fork tender.

We always start with a Caprese Salad; I have tried many and theirs is by far the most flavorful with soft melt-in-your-mouth buffalo mozzarella, Roma tomatoes, fresh basil and a rich drizzle of Balsamic glaze!

My husband loves their Shrimp Scampi which is sauteed in a savory, buttery wine sauce that you will want to wipe the plate clean with some of their delicious bread.  Oh, the bread!  When my family first starting dining here, we said it was because of their ""chocolate"" bread.  Like eating a ""lick your fingers"" warm sticky bun.

The place is fancy inside. You can't tell by the entrance from the casino.

The dark mahogany floors and crisp white table cloth made this place elegant. The music was low but good taste and very relaxing. 

The bread that was provided was perfect. Raisin and white loafs were fresh and delicious.

I decided on a good whiskey as I ordered the huge rib eye. My friend tried their NY Strip.

Both were served with a heaping size of potatoes and asparagus/broccoli. 

Since we couldn't decide on the steak sauces, Victor came out with three of his favorite which was the mushroom Demi, red wine demi and truffle demi. 

Honestly, our steaks were seasoned and cooked to perfection, they really didn't need any additional sauces. I literally took my time savoring the juiciness of each bite. My friend did the same.  He's a chef and he was pleased with his meal and the service.

2159345,2015-09-05,0,tJzf6H1dkuUbL-t8bzL3dw,"Came here with high hopes due to all the praise I saw on here. Overall, It was... okay.

The ambience is very nice. Dimly lit, with a classy feel. Was not aware that it was inside of a hotel, about 15-20 minutes from the strip. Initially thought it was a stand-alone building.

Service was mediocre. You know those waiters who tries to be funny by picking on customers, like they're buddies with them? We had one of those, who just over did it. We had a younger guy dining with us, and the waiter pretty much singled him out. Saying he does not trust him with a knife, and that he should sit alone on this side, etc, etc. It's funny at first, but becomes old quick.

Here's the food breakdown:

Starts off with bread. Woo-hoo. Pretty good bread! Then it slowly starts to go down-hill.

Appetizers:
* Crabcakes - $14 for two small portions. I guess our fault for not asking about it firsthand. Taste was okay.
* Shrimp Cocktail - $14 for 4 pieces, decent size. It was good. A shrimp cocktail, is a shrimp cocktail. Nothing really special about that.
* Calamari - $13 I believe - Had a good amount compared to what the others ordered. Breading a bit stale, seemed to be pre-cooked and kept heated. Tasted bland.

Main Course:
* Rib Eye - Okay.
* Prime Rib - It was pretty good. If you were to dine here, I would recommend this out of the rest. Taste is not as good as Lawry's or Wood Ranch though. Girlfriend complained the prime rib ""skin"" was too salty, it was.
* New York - I had the New York steak. It was not too good. Steak was tough and the taste was really under whelming. It was really disappointing that I could have made a better steak at home.
* Filet Mignon - My friend ordered this, and it pretty much messed the night up for her. Since it was pretty much burnt on some areas. Tough, tasteless and charred. 
* Porterhouse - My other friend said he liked it. Not crazy about it, but it satisfied him.

So pretty much, everything about this place is either average or slightly below that.. We regret going here, but hey, atleast we know now. =[",cnWEN9ei1TvxNPFqsJhbpw,1,0,2,wcUQ7T7OlrPluIzyn5YDOQ

And things have changed quite a bit . . .the menu is MUCH more limited now and really revolves around Prime Rib . . .which is fine as we like that . . .but our experience did not go too well.

To start off, the bread that arrived at the table was hard as rocks.  No one could even really crack them open to even apply butter.

As for the food . . .it was hit and more miss.  The prime rib was tough and without flavor.  The scallop potatoes hardly had any cheese and needed MUCH more.  The salad was ok.  But the worst part were the chef's choice of vegetables . . .they were made from FROZEN bagged carrots, broccoli and cauliflower.   I coudn't believe that in a place with prime rib they would resort to FROZEN vegetables.  This was really bad.

Other people ordered the fish special and they seemed to like it . . .but usually at a ""meat"" place, the fish is never better than a steak or prime rib . .but this was the case.

The deserts were pretty good and raised this from being only a one star meal.

This was a birthday celebration meal and the people who hosted the birthday were embarrassed by the meal.   Needless to say, we won't be back.",8q_hQwTR-v-xRt35sexavA,0,0,2,5F7LYqu0_24Hxi5dkQN3NA

The ambience was perfect. Nice and quite so you don't have to talk loud so your guests can hear you.

I was really surprised that on a Saturday night this place only had a few other tables with diners. You'd think a place like this would be packed.

The service is what really made this place great for me. I would rate this place in the top two or three restaurants I've ever eaten in as far as service goes.

The food was good to. Everyone in my party  of 6 enjoyed their meals. I personally would rate my steak a 4 out of 5. But with the kind of service you get here I didn't mind.

The total bill came to 274 and change for a party of 6. That includes one bottle of wine and a couple of other mixed drinks. So really not a bad price for a place like this.

Nestled inside the Eastside Cannery, Carve is the penultimate restaurant found in that smoky old-timey casino filled with those seemingly stereotypical Walmart-esque type customers.

The ambience is typical of that of a steakhouse in that it is dimly lit, white tablecloths, and an impeccably dressed waitstaff.

For starters, my party and I ordered the baked oysters and calamari appetizers. ""m usually not the biggest fan of oysters but gave it a taste anyway and was pleasantly surprised. Although there was quite a bit of baked cheese topping the oyster itself, it had this delicious warm, gooey-ness to it that was quite nice. The calamari was unique in appearance in that it was shaped and breaded just like a mozzarella stick. The marinara dipping sauce was decent, but nothing to brag about.

For dinner, I elected to try the New York strip(which I believe was 14 oz.) cooked medium-rare topped with shoestring onions with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. When asked if I wanted a sauce or demi-glace to go with my meat, I declined. Sides ordered for our table included asparagus, mushrooms, creamed corn and spinach.

The steak was cooked to perfection. Just the right amount of pink on the inside and it was quite juicy. I have to admit, I was smitten. The garlic mashed was so good and not overly 'garlic-y' as most are, that I almost asked for seconds. The asparagus, salty spinach, and mushrooms were on point and the creamed corn was perhaps the side I most enjoyed.",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,5,2,5,le9BIkS9tm8RjkKP9dUj5Q

I do like my shrimp a little firmer though but it's the cocktail sauce that will make it or break it. The first time we ordered SO much food. We shared 2 appetizers, each had an entree with sides, and then shared 3 desserts. I was not as gluttonous the second time.

This is the BEST thing off of the strip! My friend and I went there on our food and shopping trip to Vegas. We figure, if you're going to drop a bunch of money in Vegas, you might as well get a bunch of clothing and shoes and a full belly right?

I wish they would turn up the background music a little more. The ambiance was definitely VERY quiet and lights were dim. It was like a museum even though there was a baby and a couple kids in there... that part was a bit creepy. I felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb when I got that itch in the back of your throat that causes an insane coughing fit. We were at the front waiting to be seated and I literally almost hid myself in the corner until the host arrived.

We started with the blue claw crab cake - it had this remoulade that was so good I dipped my starter bread in it. I'll be honest, I wiped off the entire plate with it. SO good! 
We also shared the caprese salad which had THICK buffalo mozzarella slices, you could taste just how fresh the mozz was. The strange thing was that there was an odd tomato-to-mozzarella ratio. There should always be an equal amount, but I gladly ate the extra slice of cheese. :-)

Carve served up one of the best steaks I have ever had. We both ordered the filet mignon, my friend the 6oz and me the 10oz. Yes, the fat kid eyes came out and I went for the 10oz. I figure I usually down a 12oz with no problem, so why not? The thing is, when you have a steak that is this perfectly cooked - good char on the outside, rare-ish pink inside - you don't need 12oz! I could barely finish all 10 ounces. I literally had only a few bites left and I was so full and satisfied. With a steak that good, you have to finish it....  there was a major debate happening between my head and my belly. I finished the steak. Next time, I'm going for 6oz instead. I don't even remember which side I ordered... either sweet potato or mashed potatoes. Whatever it was, it was good but I did not finish it.

The food was served tableside, with the rolling, linen covered cart. Service was excellent all night. 

I was too full for the wine and we had a show to catch back on the strip, so we took the bottle with us for later. faux pas? illegal? I'm not sure, but I didn't care!

Carve is not as pricey as it looks. We expected fancy-pants steakhouse prices, but we would not have even broken $100 for two people without the bottle of wine.

As stated in previous reviews our Golf Group of 8 like to venture out and try different places so tonight reading multiple Yelp reviews that this place has the ""the Best Prime Rib Ever"" We board our bus and head out to Boulder Highway to the Easst Side Cannery Casino to visit ""CARVE"" 

If you have never been our to Boulder Hightway it is not the strip and as we enter the Local casino and work our way through to Carve you know your not in Kansas anymore.   Having a reservation didn't matter but they are not busy anyway. Even though we arrive with reservation the table is not ready, but it only takes them seconds to put it together so no big deal.  The Room is typical motiff for a Steak Place as menu's are presented. 

1st off Top shelf place and NO wine list.  Pretty good indication that things are off on the wrong foot when wine list is back of the food menu and no vintages are present on the list. Even so we choose a ok wine, some cocktails and review what is not an expensive menu.  

Off we go... Bread is terrible, gummy and not hot. Were not on the East Coast so I'll give this a passs. 

Appetizers: 
Shrimp cocktail were in short Mealy with not your steakhouse size, texture or flavor. 

Escargot a bit better served with Filo dough and lemon sauce. 

Scampi were good too, 4 shrimp in decent garlic butter sauce. 

Excellent Portobello Mushroom Frittes which were deep fried breadcrumb pieces of portobello with a pesto dipping sauce. 

The Spinach Salad and the Wedges were quite good also cold fresh and excellent , 

Unfortunately that is where the party ended.  What was presented for steaks etc was by far the worst presentation of meat ever for a top Quality steak / prime rib house. 

The Good Chicken Marsala actually ok and good...

NY Strip Passable but certainly not Upper Echelon.

Rack of Lamb Gamey and inedible 

The Prime rib Hands down the worst, toughest, inedible piece of meat 5 slabs sent back for 5 more slabs of horse meat.  You needed a frigging chain saw to chop through this saddle bag.  Absolutely horrible. to top it off, the garlic mashed potatoes were ICE COLD as well as the Baked Potato.  

I have NO WORDS to describe how bad this was.  Service was OK, but no apology from anyone regarding the level of food presented for entrees. 

So Giving them 1 star is not picking on them as if a Place with the ""BEST PRIME RIB AROUND"" Can't do that right and presents garbage then no matter quality of soups or appetizers. This place fails.

We had made a reservation via open table and had made a special request for a private booth because it was my birthday.  When we arrived, the host didn't notice the note and tried to set us at a table.  When we mentioned to him that we had requested a booth, he immediately apologized and brought us to a great private booth.  Not only that but he offered us free champagne to celebrate.  When I declined, he insisted that we at least take a free dessert.

I ordered their rack of lamb.  I was not disappointed.  It was amazing.  My wife ordered some lobster and steak dish or something of that sort and she was very happy as well.

My birthday is coming up again in a couple of weeks, and I would be happy to go to Carve again.  The quiet and classy atmosphere is so reminiscent of 'Old Vegas' to me.  It's got real charm.  The staff were very professional and treated us top notch throughout the entire meal.

And lastly - the prices for what you are getting can't be beat.  I would imagine if they were near the strip everything would be at least twice the price.

Started with shrimp scampi which was sooo good! Only comes with 4 pieces but the sauce and the way they were cooked was perfect. Even dipped the bread in the sauce. Yummm! 

Next the wedge salad: bleu cheese crumbles omg! AND a balsamic reduction! I love wedges... 

The bf got the bacon wrapped filet w the bleu cheese topping but that bleu cheese was a little overpowering. 

I got the prime rib and every bite was wonderful! Some almost rare pieces, some crunchy crusty pieces, and some fatty pieces all of which melted in my mouth. And the gravy sauce really made it for me. I got the sweet potato on the side. The cinnamon butter that came with it was the best part!

It was kind of awkward because there was only one other patron in the whole place besides my girlfriend and I.  The other issue I had was that this place is way further outside of Las Vegas then we realized when we made our reservation (which wasn't needed)  additionally the casino this restaurant is located in is kinda trashy and run down.  It takes away from your experience when you get dressed up go out then have to walk through a run down casino full of smokers with cut off t shirts.

5048217,2013-01-10,2,tJzf6H1dkuUbL-t8bzL3dw,"So we came for Christmas dinner with my in laws. We haven't had grandma out in weeks and weeks but she made the special trek for the lure of prime rib. 

I started off with their warm spinach salad and shared with the BF. This was pretty good. I liked the dressing on it, it's a bit sweet and taste like caramelized onions were blended into it.  Only thing is I would order with croutons to add some texture contrast. Love their bread basket here - the raisin bread is great!  

We all got prime rib and unfortunately our orders weren't quite right. I like mine on the rarer side of medium rare and mine was more medium but it was still good. The BFs was also medium but his was oddly a very dry piece compared to mine? He had his sent back and the second piece was much better. Mom and Grandma are not big eaters and split theirs. Our server asked if they want just a plate or have theirs split. They specifically asked to not split, they prefer to do it themselves as grandma likes the fatty parts and MIL likes the leaner middle. It came split into two very thin slices instead of down the middle so it was not as juicy as a whole would be. I was trying to get them to send it back but they wouldn't and told me it was okay. 

The server and us just did not jive at all. The BF was really irritated everytime he wanted his attention he would poke him on the back. There were times we felt ignored because this persons section had people he was hugging as they came in so those preferred people got a lot of attention and he was chatting them up and another table was what seemed to be two higher ups of the casino having a business dinner. He would come and walk by and drinks were not cared about. He would even sometimes come and ask, things okay? but see that all sodas, teas and waters empty and not do anything about it. We only got refills because bussers here normally check on tables too. We got actually really good service from our busser considering how many tables he's running. 

We never complain but the BF was so irritated he walked out on us during dinner and took a breather and came back and had to talk to the manager. I will say the manager listened to him and did try to save the experience. I noticed right away he walked to the back with our waiter and after that our server apologized. Our busser was purely waiting on our table and not our waiter after that. The manager also sent us dessert- one for each of us. We were full so we took a few bites and took it home for later. I did want my prime rib boxed up which was nearly half, but it got taken to the back and never was packed with our desserts to go home. Unfortunate for me the next day looking for a quick bite after a long busy day, not able to eat at work. 

I do recognize it was Christmas and a Monday which is not their usual service day as they are closed on Mondays... maybe that played a part, who knows. As much as this visit was pretty shoddy I still think the prime rib here is a good deal and worth coming to.Unfortunate since my first visit was great enough to get a 5 stars (I really don't give that out on first visits) and now it feels justified why I shouldn't ever give that.  Hopefully our next visit isn't like this one and this was just a big fluke.

We were going to a show at the Eastside Cannery (the Bangles!), so I opted to make a dinner reservation here, as to not have to rush through multiple locations of things. 

The ambience is definitely more upscale than the rest of the casino. Tablecloths, dim mood lighting, and rich reds and browns are very ""traditional steakhouse."" 

Thanks to Yelp's suggestion, I ordered the Lobster Bisque as my appetizer. It was very rich (a friend who also got it thought it was salty, but I disagree... just very rich). There was good lobster flavor, and it was very creamy. I wouldn't say it stands out as a best-ever, but it was very solid. 

Oh, did I mention the bread? It was warm (thanks, bread warmers!). I especially liked this nutty bread they had. There was a sweetness to it, almost like a crackle. I dig it. 

On to the main event. I ordered my prime rib medium rare (my go-to for new steak places - I dislike it when I order it rare and the center is cool - I prefer rare, but warm). It was cooked to specification, and the meat was flavorful. The au jus was a little thick for my taste, but it was well-seasoned, and the horseradish sauce had a modest kick. Some might prefer it spicier, but I thought it was in good balance with the meat. 

My only complaint is the service. Servers were very amiable and friendly, but were hardly around. I think it has to do with how they run service, as the servers are the ones who are running and explaining a lot of the food, so they're occupied for huge chunks of time when dealing with larger parties. It's just tough if you're looking to hunt someone down for a check. But it was good enough, if not a little absent. 

The prices are reasonable for what you get, I'd dare say it's a value. I'd come back here if I was seeing another show at the Eastside Cannery, but I don't know if I'd trek out from the Strip just to eat here.",Fd8Heu1mZEra7bCX3Xb3-Q,0,0,3,SX47SDzEtWBUYggB20GW5g

The price was very good on all their steaks. I got the 12oz junior cut prime rib. It was PLENTY enough, only $20 and came with a side. The salad was extra, high quality greens. Most importantly the steak was cooked perfectly, great flavor.

We salivated over their oysters on the half shell, delicious vegetable inspired appetizers, overindulged in their wine selection, and smiled at their perfectly requested and delivered steaks.  

Fast forward to Mother's Day (2016) and our evening was anything but perfect.  The food was bland, overcooked (horrible Beef Wellington!), and the service left much to be desired (waiter: there is a fine line when making fun of someone when it could just cross  a line.)  The price however at Carve hadn't changed much.  

When we first dined I didn't take a second notice spending $300 for a dinner for three but this last time our experience was on par grabbing a $9.99 steak dinner across the street at Longhorn.  It is hard finding a steakhouse on the East side of town in Las Vegas and Carve perhaps does deserve another chance from us but not during something as special as Mother's Day.  

Was this maybe a fluke?  I'm not confident making another $300 gamble at this time.",L4pC7c5zWGMhk06uXY_75g,3,0,3,YWzh3uJUKzsYMiOI7C0UlA

Lobster bisque, one of the best I have had, great flavor, nice pieces of lobster, very nice indeed.

Spinach salad, probably the weakest dish, just blah to be honest, the dressing was cold and flavorless.

Prime rib, a very good piece of meat, perfectly cooked and seasoned.

Tiramisu.....Ok, I was wrong about the spinach salad being the weakest dish, this was, there was no coffee or marsala  flavor, pretty much it was sponge with a creme filling and a little cocoa sprinkled on top, this thing has no right to be called a tiramisu.
