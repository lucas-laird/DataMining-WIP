Always on the hunt for the best Hawaiian food this is definitely a go to spot. We always order the meat combo with kalbi, meat jun and chicken. I love their meat jun sauce. I always get the fried saimin too. Yummy!!! The portions are pretty big. The customer service is excellent. The one man that is from Hawaii is always super nice and goes out of his way to accomadate your order and then some. He noticed I injured my finger and without asking he hooked me up with a bag of ice. He also gave us additional rice at no charge. You can't beat the Hawaiian spirit no matter where you live.",PN4U68T2TPhfATDxiISdKA,0,0,4,sHL5ozZkih2tYlMe_hoQow

1986197,2018-02-26,0,oE-vW0S6wRh0YVki7_pVBA,"Nestled snugly in the Greenland food court, Island Flavor 2 showcases an interesting blend of Korean and Hawaiian cuisine. For this trip, I ordered the $10.95 Spam and eggs breakfast meal, and with it came seawood soup, two kinds of kim chi, sliced hot dogs, and a curious vegetable dish coated with mayonnaise. 

You need only know that the food was made with absolute care, thought, and love. The middle-aged gentleman who took my order appeared to not look very Korean but dutifully carried out the continuous, foreign marching orders barked out by the nice Korean lady who split half her time in the restaurant stand and the other half with a table full of customers who were potentially chatting about this weirdo at the next table over, snapping photos of his lunch from various angles while leaving this here review.

The side dishes came out first and were crisp and flavorful. Standard Korean fare but at least here one can be assured that none are recycled--dishes are returned to a communal dish-return stand shared by the entire food court. The eggs were a perfect over easy, the Spam hot and crisp, and the rice poofed into a pleasantly fluffy cloud of carby goodness that offset perfectly the salinity of the meat.

While I can perhaps vaguely understand that Spam is not a universal favorite, the blessed union between yolk and short-grain rice here is undeniably, universally awe-inspiring and is akin to having the sensation of slow, sensual love-making in one's mouth. Mix with the provided kim-chi for an extra kick, if desired.",e7BvDS2tODO8lDRuIsR31g,0,0,5,BdVhz_UxxlagfSlmOGJM6A

Since we are already there we might as well eat.  My companion ordered a bowl of Saimin and I ordered Loco Moco from the counter.  A short while after we sat down, a very polite gentleman brought us 3 good size dishes of kim chees and Korean white seaweed salad along with 2 cups of hot tea.   He even came back with another dish of kim chee when he noticed we finished the first one.  My companion told me the Saimin's broth tasted like their kitchen actually prepared a real broth and not out of a can of Swanson chicken broth.  I know there's not much to a plate of Loco Moco but I felt satisfy with what this joint served.  The macaroni salad was light and tasty.  Most Island food joints tend to serve heavier version.  We really enjoyed the kim chee they serve here.  I wish they would sell a jar of that stuff to go.

I also asked for double squid for my husband and said from the beginning that we both wanted the non-hot version. When the guy told me that he was getting us the hot, more expensive version, I corrected the order. He then told me that I was difficult, and his ""staff"" (one cook) would find our food too difficult to prepare!  Seriously?!?
