19422,2007-08-08,0,PlMJAouo0D0ZXHkCDj6eeg,"Reliably sub-par to mediocre 24-hour jobbie in the otherwise food-friendly MGM Grand Hotel.

Had a waffle there once at 3 a.m. and was pretty stoked to find decent eats in my hotel at what would be considered by most to be ""off-hours.""  (Although in Vegas I think 9am to 11am more readily qualifies.)  Regardless.... waffle - good.  Coffee - good.

Subsequent breakfast visits there have been less than adequate.  Bacon that doesn't taste bacon-ey.  Ham that doesn't taste ham-ey.  Syrup that doesn't taste maple-ey....  are you getting the drift here?  Do you grasp the collective upshot of my grievances?

At least they got the ""over-medium"" part of the ""eggs over-medium"" thing right.  Beyond that, this place pretty much blows.  It's crowded.  it's noisy.  Many of the tables are in high-traffic areas, so single-diners that don't rate a booth will feel like they are dining in pit row at Daytona. It's expensive.  Overall it's not horrible, nothing here is flat-out vile... but if you're in Vegas you should be doing things right and breakfast at the Studio Cafe is just. not. right.

In short.... don't make the same mistake I made.  Don't make it so my suffering was all in vain.  Heed this warning, i beseech you.  This is your faithful correspondent signing off.",yDbtyjFQKhqLhCFjfqQ08A,1,0,2,TgsX8MNCW_e-2wNjrZopQw

We actually came here twice while we were in Vegas due convenience (when you don't want eating to get in the way of gambling). 
During to first stop I ordered the club sandwich. If you are ever here and order this make sure you are going to split it with someone, the sandwich is huge. As far as taste, it was decent, but it's hard to really judge when you have to eat it in pieces because it is physically impossible to eat the whole thing with one bite. The second trip here I wised up and split a pizza. It was a four cheese pizza and we added Italian sausage, onions and peppers. It was actually surprisingly good for a diner pizza. 
Our service was decent both times. I would say the food is a little pricey, but I guess you have to adjust your price scale when eating in Las Vegas. If you happen to be in the MGM and want a casual/quick meal this is a decent option.",kngL5mBU4Dcal41rXwACXw,0,0,3,HWoZrB20vwGDv45tSGV3Qw

Well, with the exception of the soda. Two SMALL Cokes (which were obviously fountain pop) cost a grand total of $8.00. I know that doesn't sound like much, but for two small drinks packed with ice? Come on!!

We were seated quite fast but found it interesting that our server had to wait for a table for two to be cleared off when I could clearly see several of them from where I was standing. Once we were seated our server was friendly and quick to bring us our drinks and take our order. This is where the speedy service stopped. We had to wait a long time for our food to arrive. Even after repeated assurances by our server that she had just checked on it and it was on its way out.

I was also disappointed by the noise level in the restaurant. I understand that it is located directly off of a Vegas casino, but dear God was it loud.

I can honestly say that with all the other options for food in Vegas, this place is only good for a really late night lunch.",zFEUxh9bedGHYf_5HF3hkw,1,0,2,4mRw25SyYIDZLFF67XF1LA

We ate at the Studio Cafe after a late, late night. We were seated promptly. It's true that there weren't many frills, but the waitress that we had was highly attentive. Never did I see the bottom of my glass of water. She even made a comment along the lines of - ""... too much tequila last night, huh?"" Well, this review isn't about the prior night, so we'll keep to the point.

I had the club sandwich which came with french fries. The french fries were piping hot and tasted wonderful. The sandwich was humongous and definitely satisfied. It was filled to the brim with tomatoes, bacon, avocado slices and slices of turkey/ham/chicken meat. My friend an omelet that came with hash-brown. The omelet was a great size. Made with three eggs, the portion was perfect. The hash-brown was sub par. It could've used a little more time on the grill, but even then, how can one turn down hash-brown. This one was made with non-standard 'thin' potato strands.

He begged me to get something else off of the menu, but after my experience of the $17 ""roast beef"" sandwich, and waiting over 30 minutes to get it-I wasn't going to go through that again.

Walk outside, get in a cab, go to Caesar's, go to Bradley Ogden's and get the burger at the bar.  Same price.  A world of difference.  

After eating the burger I felt cheated, bamboozled.  There are plenty of great burgers in Vegas and this place has the balls to claim this is a world famous burger?  Jeez.  Let me deconstruct this for you.  Bun - tough.  Burger - dry, chewy. (It sure wasn't cooked medium).  Fries - Meh.  And let me tell you about Mr. Personality working at the bar.

We tried to go at lunch but with no waiter in sight we finally decided to go to the food court so Geoff would have time to get to his conference. But I went back that night because I wanted to use the Prima offer of a free ""gourmet cupcake"" with the meal. (I chose strawberry shortcake. The other flavors are German chocolate or carrot cake.) I told the guy at the podium that if I had to wait around by myself at dinner I would not want to eat there, and he made sure the waitress did not ignore me. She was so warm and friendly and went the extra mile by tossing some plastic utensils into my leftover bag. (These came in handy when Geoff came back from his meeting with some treats that needed a spoon). 

I ordered the chicken club sandwich. It came with those crispy fries in the mini fryer basket (not hot, unfortunately). The huge, yummy sandwich had applewood smoked bacon, sprouts, tomato, and avocado on a ciabatta roll. Cut in three pieces and held together with bamboo skewers, it covered the length of the plate. It cost more than the chicken sandwich I had at Nathan's for lunch, but it was better by a magnitude that far exceeded the extra cost. 

One mark of excellence is not that you never screw up, but that you remedy any shortfalls with grace and good will, which is what I experienced here. Contrast that to our horrible experience last June (so traumatic I haven't written about it yet) at Emeril's Fish House (also at MGM) where, when I tried to talk to their manager about it, he practically insisted I produce a receipt to prove I had eaten there or he wouldn't believe that I wasn't trying to ""scam him out of a free meal""!

You really only want to eat here if you have no other choice.  This is one of the only 24-hour choices in the hotel so if you don't want to venture far, this is your best bet, albeit not a very good one.

The service is hit or miss here.  Sometimes I dine here and I get a great, attentive waiter deserving of a large tip.  Other times, not so much.  The menu has been cut down big time in the last few years.  What was once a multi-page menu with an abundance of selection has been whittled down to nothing but a small cardboard rectangle with some food items on it.  I'm not joking, they hardly have anything on here anymore.

The food is below average.  Nothing here is very good including the massive burgers.  They are just massive assive hamburgers that only the likes of Joey Chestnut could finish.  It's one thing to be really big, but it's a completely other thing to be tasty.  These burgers are the former.

The prices are what you expect from a restaurant that has no competition late at night - expensive, but what else can you expect from a Vegas cafe that sits in a humongous casino?  Be prepared to spend $20 a head here for mediocre food.  If you have a car, hit up In-N-Out across the I-15.",r-Y00BpksG8RmgRZxywrYg,2,2,2,6jlTPGDBbaDoL2lli9zSLg

1709267,2010-06-16,12,PlMJAouo0D0ZXHkCDj6eeg,"One of those cheap live show ticket places was doing a great deal by combining dinner and a show.  They offered us a significant discount on a packaged night that included tickets for Ka and a 2-for-1 meal at Nob Hill (both at the MGM Grand).  Unfortunately, Nob Hill was booked up (as well as almost every other MGM Grand restaurant due to an Eagles concert) so we had to settle for their Studio Cafe.

For dinner, they had a wide variety of choices, which is usually a bad sign.  Like most other casino cafes, the food was overpriced while the portions were big and filling.  We did not get anything to start except for the complimentary bread.  We also skipped dessert--mainly because they did not have much to offer.  I think they only had cupcakes for desserts.  I rarely see cupcakes on any restaurant menu (and definitely very rarely see it as the star attraction).

I went with the grilled Wagyu Prime Rib.  I have had grilled prime rib before (I used to work at a restaurant that made it) and it seemed like a good option because it was both reasonably priced (compared to the other stuff) and would probably be at least okay.

The prime rib was probably part-roasted and then thrown on a grill to heat up.  The prime rib was somewhat tender, but it was cooked closer to medium than medium rare.  I would imagine it would be difficult to get prime rib medium rare when you have to grill it.  Despite the Wagyu label, the quality of the meat was not that great.  The flavor wasn't great either.

The sides included some mixed veggies as well as a loaded baked potato (cheese, sour cream, bacon, etc.).  The sides were pretty average.

The place was pretty busy.  Service was okay.  The food came out quick.  There were definitely spots when the service was inattentive.  Getting and paying for the bill also took longer than it should have.

I've visited the cafes at Bally's, Aria, Caesars, and now MGM Grand.  None of them were great experiences.  I've often had to dine at these cafes because the decision revolved around what was close and what was convenient.

These cafes may be suitable for breakfast (though some of the breakfast reviews for Studio Cafe are pretty bad).  While I may give a Vegas cafe another shot for breakfast, I think I am going to avoid Vegas cafes for lunch and dinner moving forward.

Completely overwhelmed by all the lights and the glitter, at 11:30 I stood wide-eyed and useless in the lobby of the MGM Grand.  My boss had to come and retrieve me before I short-circuited.  It was decided that despite the late hour, we were both starving, and once I had deposited my bags in my room, we headed to the Studio Cafe as it was the only restaurant open at that late hour.

I started with a vodka soda, which was very heavy on the soda.  In fact, I only assume it even contained vodka because vodka is in the name of the drink, but it sure didn't taste like it contained vodka.   However, the weak drink was balanced out by one of the better Cobb salads I've had in my life.  It was huge, for starters, and filled with bacon-y, avocado-y, bleu cheese-y deliciousness.  It did not, however, contain olives, which functionally disqualified it from officially being the best Cobb salad ever.  Still, yum.

Then, in case I hadn't had quite enough Studio Cafe in my life, I had a breakfast meeting there the next morning.  I had the special, which was a whole wheat Belgian waffle panini with Vermont Cheddar, ham, two eggs over easy, and micro greens.  It was ambitious.  It wasn't as good as it was trying to be, and though I enjoyed it enough, it sat in my stomach like a rock for the rest of the morning.

I wouldn't come back unless it was, as in the case of the late night dinner, the only pace open, or, as in the case of the breakfast meeting, required by my employer.  But it was serviceable nonetheless.",geeRP-gkEQmiYRp5vMJ-zQ,2,0,2,sHK95zh-hdoGdZQR1Q3RgA

GREASE.

Sounds gross, no?  Well you'd be wrong.  The thing I crave the most after a night (or in the case of Vegas, an entire weekend) of gratuitous drinking is an awesome greasy meal.  Unfortunately we showed up a bit too late for the breakfast fare (their all-day breakfast includes boring staples like a bagel, omelet or cereal) so ordered the BBQ burger.  It was damn tasty, though the fries stole the spotlight.  The boyfriend ordered the BLT, which he claimed was also tasty, but smothered in mayo.  Apparently the mushroom burger and the Reuben were also winners.

So, don't go if you're on the verge of morning hangover porcelain praying, because this much grease might just put you over the edge.  But for those who just need something in their bodies other than mass amounts of Vegas booze and sparse amounts of 3am food, this is for sure the place to go.  Especially if you're already parked at the MGM Grand already, which we so conveniently were.

I wouldn't be surprised if they had no remnants of bacon grease in the back kitchen...I'm sure they put it in a spray bottle and saturate their food with it.  Delicious.",mBV9OLTPvmKSQheM36zzsA,1,1,4,_hjow_i-slsEPD2dEDP5cw

As many restaurants in Vegas offer this: inflated prices for simple meals, very few of them healthy and almost no stated vegetarian options.  I sat at the bar and ordered the breakfast burrito and got a contorted look from the bartender.  ""Um, I don't do that.  Gloria will take your order. I can get you a drink though""

O for goodness sake! Can I just order? Don't make me hate not ordering room service at my hotel? Eventually Gloria hustles on over.  She is, however, superfriendly and warm.  Were this anywhere else I might think Gloria would go back in the kitchen and fix it up for me.  I ordered the breakfast burrito to go with no of the fatty sides and no meat.

Visit 3: Recovering from the worst hangover.  My bf & I were staying at the Signature and by principle would not order from room service bc everything was over $20 practically.  So I dug deep and mustered the strength to go down to the MGM Grand to get some dinner.  I wasn't in the mood for anything in the food court so I decided to go to Studio Cafe.  I ordered the club sandwich, chicken noodle soup, & orange juice which came out to around $26.  I must admit it on the pricey side which I whined about for 5 minutes to myself.  But the food wasn't that bad.  The Club sandwich was pretty legit and was more than enough to feed one person.  It took me 3 meals to finish the whole thing so I was pretty happy overall.  Didn't try the chicken noodle bc it was for my bf...but I assume it did its job.

WHY IS THIS POORLY RATED?!

I thought this place was bomb! Their chicken strips?? MM! (The only thing that sucks about this place, is they charge extra for ranch..the hell would do that?!) But, our second waiter was kind enough to give us a giant cup of ranch to go..for free :D

A bit pricey though..well of course, it IS Vegas afterall..but for 4 people, pretty much JUST food..the bill was over 100 buckaroonies. 

Went here for the second time, and we ordered some more chicken strips, pizza, and chicken wings. THEIR CHICKEN WINGS ARE SO CRISPY DELICIOUSLY DELICIOUS..OMG. We ordered another round. (Well, because my dad was super duper drunk status..and well yeah self explanatory.) But..damn, they are GOOD! 

The waitress was being a bit bitchy though. I asked for a straw, and she said, ""HUH?!?!?!"" across the room. Really lady? And she pretty much threw the straw at me. Also, I asked for some hot green tea, and she spilled the hot water all over the table..AND didn't clean it up. Poopy ass waitress.

1) we had breakfast here, not late night food (when the choices are much more limited) so in theory, we CHOSE to eat here out of convenience since we were staying at the signature.

2) we ate at bouchon restaurant (venetian) the morning before, and had incredible - and i mean INCREDIBLE, 5 star worthy breakfast there for the SAME price.

3) the service SUCKED.

4) the COFFEE was the WORST. $3.50 for coffee (they ask you if you want coffee like it's free but it's NOT. I found out after I ordered by looking closely at the menu...if I knew, I would have spent less than that at starbucks for better coffee). They bring you a carafe that I'm assuming can be shared by multiple people because it's refillable but who wants a refill of burnt sand? Not me. I thought they'd charge $3.50 per carafe but no, they charge per mug. We ended up paying $7.00 for coffee that was so disgusting we had to ask for a pitcher of HOT WATER to dilute it and the waitress asked, ""Oh, is it for the coffee?"" Uh... wow. she KNEW. I bet sooo many other people asked for water to dilute their horrible coffee. I can tell you this much. that nasty coffee was the last thing i consumed in Vegas and it woke the hell out of me. I guess it did its job in a fraction of the usual sips I need (too bad i drink coffee for the taste and not so much for the kick start).

If you are going to eat breakfast, please people. go to bouchon. you won't regret it. get the sausage there. it's sooooo soft and delicious. the french toast is like bread pudding and the ham/cheese/egg sandwich is killer. the mimosa is bomb, too. since i can't give this place zero stars, might as well recommend a better choice (so my job is done).

for late night eatery, i guess you have no choice but to come here. stay away from the coffee.

4484551,2010-07-22,1,PlMJAouo0D0ZXHkCDj6eeg,"Even though I'm a local, with two major locals' casinos near home, the casino at MGM Grand has become my casino of choice, ever since I discovered that MGM is the only brand that actually rewards its players, even us little ones.  I'm now usually there once a week, on Ladies Night Out with my other poker widow friends, but I'm not a high roller by any means.  My measly few bucks has translated into generous food comps, so I now spend my gambling dough there, instead of Suncoast (best comp: a free ice cream cone) or Rampart at the Marriott (never even so much as a key chain).

That usually means we're eating at Studio Cafe, and the result can be great or totally disastrous, depending on which chef showed up that night.  Since the bad times have outweighed the good ones, it's two stars instead of three.  But tonight the good chef clocked in.

My friend and I shared a Reuben, and it was perfectly grilled.  The corned beef was moist and not overly fatty, and the amount of dressing was just right.  The Reuben is usually a good bet, though once in a while, when the B Team is in place, it will have to be sent back to actually get grilled instead of just toasted.

My friend wanted fries, but I wanted to try to salvage an otherwise ghastly week of overindulgence - I wanted fruit.  We solved the problem by getting the fries and ordering a side of fruit.

The fries, as others have probably indicated, are served in a miniature version of a fryer basket.  Tonight they were fresh, hot, and crisp, but that's not always the case here.  The fruit cup side order consisted of exactly 10 pieces (two each) of cantaloup, honeydew, watermelon, pineapple, and strawberry slices.  The waitress must have told the kitchen we were sharing, and I chuckled as I divvied up the portion, imagining someone in the back counting out each piece and making sure it was exactly equal and divisible by two.

We each had coffee, one regular and one decaf.  I'm the one writing this review at 1:00 a.m., so guess which one I had!  I'm a Starbucks junkie, so I don't rate the coffee too highly.  It's barely passable, IMHO, but others may disagree. [Note: Starbucks is right next to the Cafe].

Gloria was our waitress tonight; she's served us before, and she's efficient and businesslike.  

The one consistent Five-Star performer at Studio Cafe is the bread that's served in a basket with meals.  It is absolutely OUTSTANDING, and I can't find bread this good anywhere else in Vegas - not in restaurants, bakeries, or supermarkets.  It's a dense, whole-grain bread covered with a fantastic New York, Eli's or Zabar's-like crispy crust.  It's the kind of stuff I'd be bringing back from the East Coast if the airlines hadn't started gouging us for checked baggage. The bread alone is worth the price of admission.  And if they ever decide to save money by changing that bread, I won't ever go back.  I'm not kidding.  It's that good.

Speaking of prices, they are - ta-da - way, way too high for what is essentially a coffee shop.  Sandwiches are around $15-16.  But if you're a tourist staying on the Strip, and want sit-down service that's a notch above the nearby Denny's, and more choices than the McDonald's in MGM's  miserable excuse for a food court, then you can give Studio Cafe a try.

Now I am fair when a place is busy, but it was empty and he only had 2 tables to serve!

Our server got his tables mixed up, by taking the order of 2 people that came after us. Plus he forgot to serve us water. He got the other tables right, but realized he fuc*ed up when he came to our table with a pitcher of water to pour in our glasses he never gave us! IDIOT


2 hambugers with fries and 2 diet cokes! $42.16... McDonalds looked better after this experience.

you want to pay $16.00 for a hambuger, you better not mess up my order! 

OK! the meat was a good size! not a juicy buger, but a good burger. The fries were your typical standard size.Nothing on it but salt.

But the menu needed crayons to go with it. It was a piece of paper and the selection wasnt alot. For paying a high price, you would think u will receive a better menu selection.

My family decided to have a family reunion, and we decides on Vegas to be the spot where we all congregated together. Although I do enjoy fine wining and dining, I usually prefer cheap spots because the outrageous prices for drinks (although it's a well known fact) can burn a hole in anyone's wallet. On the day of our departure, my Uncle forced us to have brunch and he decided on having it at Studio Cafe. I'm definitely not a breakfast kind of person...my idea if one bowl of cereal, and that will satisfy my hunger pangs. But since we were all being forced to spend quality family time, I had to conceal my disappointment and attend. When we were seated (which was a relatively painless process since we weren't in Vegas on one of the crowded weekends) I scanned the menu for something comparatively cheap. Voila!  My mouth salivated for some French Toast, and that's what I ordered. It was quite expensive, and yes, I do agree, Vegas is expensive but I had to pay 14 bucks for it! I envisioned how moist and delicious it would be, with large slices of bread, divided in four mouth watering slices. My hunger pangs were taking over now, and I was slightly impatient at waiting. The service was quick, especially for a group as large as ours (10) and we received our food in a span of twenty minutes. When they handed me my French toast, I was utterly disappointed! The slices were unbelievably small! I shrugged my shoulders, and generously poured maple syrup all over my meal, eagerly anticipating a bite. Again...disappointment! I finished it up, anyway, because for the money paid, I felt guilty about wasting a bite. Usually, I savor French toast, but I was repulsed by it and tried to repress my nausea. The only good thing about the meal was that it was small, and I finished it quickly. What a painstaking process! I'm not knowledgeable about other items on the menu, but I won't be eager to return.

Since we had lil guy with us, and although he showed no signs of sleep deprivation at 11pm, we were worried and decided to stay within the compounds of the hotel to have supper. Since this was the only restaurant opened, we had no choice but to eat here.

The restaurant was comfortable and it being so late (for us it is late.... we're old!) we definitely welcomed comfy chairs. My big thing being in Vegas is to have French onion soup. This was a tradition a good Hawaiian friend of mine got me hooked on when we were in Vegas with them. Each time we'd go to a restaurant late at night, we'd order French onion soup. This one's for you dude!

So I got the soup and some chicken wings. Hubby got the salmon benedict. Lil guy was happy drawing on the menu our waiter gave him. 

Service was definitely slow. Hubby decided to get a drink -- an alcoholic one that is -- since he didn't need to drive anywhere. Our waiter was just great. He always made sure that we were doing fine while waiting for the food. Not his fault that the food was slow.

My French onion soup arrived. Mmmmm tasty! Topped with the gruyere and caramelized, I couldn't wait to dig in. Only problem was, the broth was extremely salty. I ate the onions, the crouton, the cheese but couldn't finish the soup itself. I kept drinking water because the salt had taken over.

Hubby said his benedict was good. I had a bite. It was okay. I generally prefer the Florentine benedict. My wings were really good. I asked for them not to toss them in the spicy sauce so they'd be nice and crispy, and they were!! I couldn't even finish them. Our waiter also brought us a bread basket of ciabatta rolls and corn bread. GOSH the ciabatta was so yummy. He brought us more.

In the end, I took the remainder of the wings AND the bread back to the room which I finished the next morning. 

Service was great. Food was good but definitely overpriced. I probably wouldn't dine here again even if we stayed at the hotel in the future because we found some wonderful places with great food but at far more reasonable prices.

My husband ordered the cowboy ribeye, I ordered the Marguerite pizza to split with our daughter and some fries.  The food looked amazing... But it failed to deliver on favor each time.  The steak was so charred and under seasoned it tasted of smoke and burnt meat, and nothing else.  When we tried to salt it, every salt shaker was empty on our table and took us a full15 minute to even make eye contact with our server.

Even with the addition of salt, the steak was a fail, and a 30 bucks it should have been at minimum edible.  This is Vegas, Ive had amazing 10$ steaks, so this was truly unacceptable.  The veggies were very nice though, and our daughter gobbled it up over the fries.  YES she actually chose to eat veggies over the French fries... That's how horribly mediocre the fries were.  

My pizza was boring, no tomato sauce, but halved cherry tomatoes on top... Not really my thing.  The crust was burnt and tasteless like shoe leather.

First of all, it looks like an old run down buffet. I was just craving a chicken sandwich on our last day and this place was bragging about their burgers. Once we sat down we saw that their burgers were ridiculously overpriced. Like most were $17 or more. Usually I've only seen prices like that for burgers at very nice hotels or fancy restaurants at lunch. If they are trying to make this place a high end burger place they should start with a massive remodel. This restaurant is ugly, old and depressing looking.

I didn't feel like going to another place since we were going to get on then road right after. We decided to share the $17 chicken sandwich & stop later when we got hungry again since we weren't super-hungry at that time.

The food took more than 30 minutes to come. Even though I wasn't super hungry when we ordered, after waiting that long I was. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. When the food finally came it was barely warm and the fries were cold. Completely unacceptable. We were so hungry that we scarfed down the burger before the server came by to check on us, which was also at least 10 minutes. I told the server the food had come out cold. I asked him of he could exchange the fries with some fresh ones, because if I'm going to eat unhealthy food I want it to at least be good. Fresh fries came out within 2 minutes.

When the check came I was irritated to see that I had been charged $2 for a small side of BBQ. If I'm paying $17 for a sandwich with no type of sauce then I don't think I should be charged $2 for a condiment. And $2 is ridiculous for any condiment.  I've never done this before, but I actually asked the server to remove the charge and he did. I just thought for such a disappointing meal that was ridiculous.

I will never eat here again. I would rather eat at McDonalds or pay a few bucks more and eat at Fiamma or somewhere that's actually nice.",5uwsIgJFakD6AJ_wji6ThA,1,0,1,oAIVH-_VbyaBilnaTla0Xw

Also, we were able to sit at the bar and have a beer while watching the women's world cup soccer game, which couldn't be done at most other restaurants we checked out before stopping here.",RQR-bncvVssevK_WIPWvCA,0,0,4,TtBtg0BIkVTR-YWNpFTRxA

I ordered some egg thing, thinking it came with the bacon, hash, cheese on the side, but it was an omelet mix? Basically scrambled eggs, no I am not that dumb to see if it was in the omelet section because it wasn't lol! However, I asked if I could have something else because I did not know that it was supposed to be like this, and he got me what I wanted, and even went the extra mile as to bring me fruit to munch on as I waited. I was so impressed that I left a comment for the manager, saying that I did not know if that was mandatory or just him, but I appreciated it! Great service and the food, particularly the breakfast, is awesome!",Hhc5iKV5CDoFLruTunY7YA,0,0,5,yZe-KZCWYVO_ptK3b916kw
