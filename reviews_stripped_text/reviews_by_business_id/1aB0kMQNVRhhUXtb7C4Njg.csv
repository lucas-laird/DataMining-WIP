1394600,2018-05-07,0,1aB0kMQNVRhhUXtb7C4Njg,Saw the reviews on Yelp and decided to try this place. I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken cooked here is the best I ever had in all of Las Vegas. It's extremely tasty and juicy. The owners are very friendly and have great customer service. Also their fruit drinks are wonderful. This place in my opinion is the best mexican food place in all of Las Vegas. I would definitely come back and recommend it to friends and family. The only thing kind of lacking was the decoration in the eating area. Other than that A+++++.,lZq-WhordOin_B_PTxK5-g,0,1,5,sK52Sy_FIIYqtwcBzHkM2A

I didn't have time to return as I had to get ready for work. Kind of bothered me because I was kind of forced to eat something I didn't like.",rblTb-xxefHMMQymTP5riA,0,0,4,yDwUa4lGLjt-xfxyj7vKVQ
1802510,2018-04-16,0,1aB0kMQNVRhhUXtb7C4Njg,"Damn this chicken is GOOD!!!

I tried a whole chicken, 2 chicken tacos and a carne asado taco.

Whole chicken - Crazy good flavor.  You can't fake that char-grilled taste.  They even cook it out front making it harder for you to smell it and not stop and try!

Chicken tacos - Hard shell, cheese and sour cream.  Very good!  They use the same chicken they grill, which makes me happy.  Some place might rely on pre-packaged frozen tacos to cook, but not this place.

Carne asada taco - Not the best asada, but pretty solid.  Also no fat, which to me is a big deal.  I can't stand getting carne asada tacos when 20 to 30% of the meat is actually fat.  

Overall, highly recommended!",CjdDInWRJOVEKgGjT9vxeQ,0,1,5,gda2NRUo5cCgY7svonzwow

The street tacos are wonderful and authentic! They make a home made sauce that is out of this world, be warned it's a bit spicy though. 

If you're near here be sure to drop in and support this family restaurant!",_dx5ArFkm1SHp4_POjHlyg,0,0,5,KF2teZ_EcqZ0ZN_01-vJnw

Water had no ice & was warm.  Wasn't sure if there was inside seating or not, but we found it around the corner.   They had a salsa/ relish bar  & I not sure what it was for , my grilled chicken? It's kinda off the beaten path.  Probably will not go back",TgMHNBr0bou7dc2LFClJcw,0,0,3,YOPjkCG9mZVRu1JsZ98Z6g

The chicken was moist and had a great flavor the sides were great and there was literally nothing to complain about other than the fact that I didnt stop by sooner. This is a family owned business and the owner is extremely friendly. The price is also extremely fair, try getting this much food for this price at El Pollo Loco, KFC or Popeyes. Won't happen! Also, he makes all the sauces homemade! Stop in ASAP!",V7cGEFexpXTY-jKWhqkHcw,0,1,5,C5No6Dx7CiDhaJ0riZ5FPg

My favorite menu item other than the chicken has to be the al pastor huaraches.

3243986,2018-06-25,0,1aB0kMQNVRhhUXtb7C4Njg,We just moved to Henderson and this was the first place we tried! WOW! You cannot beat the flavor and tenderness of the chicken. The price is incredible. We fed our family of four with 10 piece chicken meal and had so much left over. Fresh food  and cheaper than a fast food chain restaurant! We have found our new favorite!,-vgtrwdPgidfgEPMtCs-kg,0,0,5,ayV2ibAlSAeDIqqaaiUAqQ

Came with two sides and 6 corn tortillas. Rice and beans were good, not over seasoned but not too plain. It was a good balance.  Inside looks like work in progress. We came in to pick up a late lunch and eat it at home, and i would say this is more of a to-go place. Overall good food at great value, and owner was working register himself; why support a chain when there's a hard-working small business grinding. will be back",ldhpFDH3Su4OtJi7ytINzw,0,0,5,-VcTRgtyGXtrGaLwFovEog
4090590,2018-02-05,1,1aB0kMQNVRhhUXtb7C4Njg,"BEST FAMILY OWN CHARCOAL GRILL  CHICKEN JOINT EVER!!! I think I found a new  go to hole in the wall place.  First thing first that I want to address was the intoxicating aroma of the season chicken from the charcoal grill ugh that right there is the number 1 reason why we walk in at this place. It looks empty outside so Im kinda nervous that this place might not be good but I was wrong. Since this is a newly open, (2 months now they have been operating) they have a ton of LOYAL customer that do take away since the dining area is not yet completely finish. They are also working (in the process)  of  setting up the patio outside so thats gonna so LIT when its all set and done. I can see myself smelling the grill and eating outdoor YASSSS. The inside is small and cozy ( not a bad thing ) 

Customer Service: The guy and the Lady (owner) are really nice they talk to us and made us feel welcome like its their home. It reminds me of when we walk in to our TIO AND TIA house and you ask whats for dinner?  Lol . 

SALSA BAR: this is a big deal to me I always enjoy selection of salsa that adds more flavor to my food ( the salsa bar are clean, homeade , delicious and freshly made daily.

Food: We order the whole chicken combo (6 tortillas and 2 sides which is Rice and Beans plus a small bag of  tortilla chips) which was like 13.99 plus we also pay for $1.00 for the extra side of 6 corn tortilas our total reciept was $18.93. It was for 2 adult 2 kids and we couldnt finish the chicken we had to take the leftover home. If we go to Mcdonald or other fastfood It would easily be atleast 30 bucks and not so healthy but here you cant beat that price. The chicken is flavorful (not dry at all). Next time you eat at a fastfood consider this place first and I promise you wont regret. 

Overall I would give this place a 10 out 10 rating",pjtxQ20NW5qUGr6pzwSfSQ,3,1,5,OYmi-o7TnqezJzSJW-VEsg
4109799,2018-05-27,0,1aB0kMQNVRhhUXtb7C4Njg,Chicken is delicious. The place looks clean. It's easy to pass by like we have many times. We decided to give it a try for dinner and we loved it.

If you can find it, you'll see the smoke coming from the grill. You can smell it from the street, so awesome. You know exactly what your in for. Very clean establishment with a variety of sauces. Try the homemade tomatillo sauce, very good with the perfect kick. The chicken speaks for itself. I know it was going to be good before even tasting it. Flavorful throughout, not just the skin. Rice and beans are amazing, rice has a little garlic flavor and probably the best beans I ever had. Chicken goes well with the red sauce but green sauce is just as good",-VNv58eLhbQpz787rcD8VA,1,1,5,8wlYyBU-gHhNysqsiEVzmw

We ordered a whole chicken with beans and rice as our sides. The chicken was moist and seasoned well and the beens were delicious. The price was very reasonable. This place is close to our house and I'm excited to have a restaurant within walking distance. Nothing ever survives in this location, so I hope people will choose to go there.

5773670,2018-03-07,2,1aB0kMQNVRhhUXtb7C4Njg,"This place opened 3 months ago. I'd stop at the Minit Mart on the corner of Russell and Mtn Vista and look over at the smoking grills in the parking lots and smell that wonderful smell of chicken cooking over a wood fire. If it wasn't for the terrible entrance to get here I'd have stopped before.

I finally made it today. I'm glad I did. $7 for a 3 piece with 2 sides and tortillas. And it tastes as good as it smells. A hint of citrus mixes with the herbs and charbroil. Delicious!!!

It's a small place with an entrance set up for to go, and a small dining area to the right. Nothing fancy. A huge room occupies the rest of the building, for more dining or large functions.

Staff was friendly. Good customer service.

I'll definitely be back. A nice selection of Mexican food options to explore. Simple and priced right.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,5,4,4,x7DJxdiXYfKJiMh8rFcsOA
