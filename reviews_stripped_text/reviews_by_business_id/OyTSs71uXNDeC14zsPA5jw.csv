I took a spoonful and it was so good. At the bottom was the pineapple juice. It was topped with a cherry and umbrella. As we sat eating our delicious desserts, there was trans dance music playing. I liked the music and vibe inside. Prices were worth it. They even serve ice cream from Thrifty's. They sell drinks, candy and even milkshakes.

Came here for Dole whip because Dole whip rocks my world. And once a year I get like a huge craving for it. My lovely hubby indulged me by heading out of our way to satisfy my appetite. We ordered it and it came with a little umbrella and maraschino cherry. Cute.

Then I dig in. Ummm....there is kinda of a large hole in the middle of the Dole whip. Lame!

Given that it cost $4.50 for this relatively small treat, it is pretty pricey for what it is. Sigh! I guess it's okay if you only go back once a year to get your Dole whip groove on. Otherwise, probably should avoid this place.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,3,3,--qSbS_ZX052hAqKVtNx9Q

2655050,2016-05-15,1,OyTSs71uXNDeC14zsPA5jw,"My husband and daughter tried out this place and said that it was great. The shave ice & the customer service. 

We came down as a family on a weekend to get some shave ice. I put my order in with a guy with glasses. I ordered a single scoop of ice cream on a cone, a child shave ice - strawberry, and a dole whip. I reiterated that my daughter only wanted strawberry flavoring and nothing else. 

After we ordered two big parties walked in to get shave ice too. They gave me my sons ice cream order after a minute or so. And he told us that we had two people in front of us before my daughters shave ice was ready. Well we were skipped by 8 orders or so. They served the parties that ordered after I did. The employee was trying to give my daughter a shave ice that we didn't even order which was for the second party that ordered. I had to tell him what I ordered again after waiting more than 20 minutes. They gave me my dole whip order and the guy calls me up to the order window to ask me to pay again for my order again!

I was explained to HIM that I had already paid for my orders. He never gave anyone a receipt, he had to look through the transactions to find my order. Then he says, ""Sorry about that and the wait. We're busy."" While I'm walking away from the window the other employee (a girl) tells him you need to print out the receipts so you don't mess up anyone's orders! 

My husband is disappointed with the service today. He's been raving about this place to me, our family & friends. I wouldn't have cared if he skipped us a couple times but to skip us and forget our order, and ask me to pay again?! I was close to asking not for a refund and walking out of there. 

We will probably come back one of these days if we're ever at Meadows Mall again. But hopefully we'll have better service.",gKaDD6UtLYdLfoKhnB7V2w,1,0,2,E_v9MjbC2bCNIorG0L7jxA
2698461,2016-01-14,4,OyTSs71uXNDeC14zsPA5jw,"This business was brought to my attention as the owner visited a patient of mine from work.  Offering real Hawaiian shaved ice, Thrifty's ice cream, and Dole Whip, one stop could satisfy a whole family's various sweet tooth/teeth. 
Normally I would not go out of the way to Meadows Mall as it is far from where I live but I now have a reason to stop by if I'm in the area again.  

Two locations inside Meadow's mall (a booth downstairs) provides some of the nicest dole whips and Hawaiian shaved ices you can enjoy here in Vegas.  I opted to try a shaved ice with half Tiger's blood and half P.O.G. with condensed milk drizzled over everything. 

Tiger's blood (usually watermelon, strawberry, and a hint of coconut) was nice and sweet and I also enjoyed the P.O.G. (Passion fruit, Orange, Guava).   Served with a spoon and a straw, the size was huge and good enough for two.  

The dole whip was just as refreshing as ever.  I'm not nearly a pineapple fan but I'll gladly take this frozen concoction any and every day.   I suggest you try this as well if you have never had the opportunity to do so.  If it was Disneyland's best kept dessert for a long time, you know it must be good!

We've only had the Thrifty ice cream (lots of yummy flavors available) so far, but my in-laws had the Dole Whip (said it was just as good as they remembered having it on our past Hawaii trip). I grew up with Thrifty ice cream (there was one in my city that we would go to regularly, especially after school), so it's part nostalgia whenever we get Thrifty ice cream nowadays. When Thrifty (the store chain) closed down here, lots of places (ie. gas stations) decided to carry the popular ice cream brand. Glad it's inside of the Meadows Mall, too.

""Bettah than the place at container park."" After trying this place out, ""Yes, I can say it is."" They have more options and flavors to add to the shave ice. And more aloha spirit, it adds to the authenticity. 

They have other cold dessert options, such as Dole Whip, Thrifty Ice Cream, milkshakes, malts, floats, dole float, hot fudge sundae but your best bet here is the shave ice. The other ones you can find else where, but if you're in the mall and craving for something other than shave ice, go for it. 

They have a variety of toppings: mochi, condensed milk, dole whip, sour spray, li hing mui powder, strawberry/raspberry sauce, Ghirardelli chocolate syrup. 

The only thing that's missing which would make it more authentic is having azuki beans as a topping. 

The guy at this location, was for real a local braddah from Hawai'i. Super friendly and we chatted with him while we sampled some of the shave ice flavors. He definitely had the Aloha Spirit. Although he's lived in Las Vegas for 14 years he still had a strong Hawaiian Pidgin accent. It was nice to hear. I miss it. I don't hear it that often. 

Sorry, I forgot a photo of the shave ice. I only had a few spoons of it because I'm trying to watch my sugar intake (diabetes). 

This place made me miss home. Will be back soon!

TIP: They have Melona, POG (Passion Orange Guava) & Tiger's Blood syrup! 

TIP: There are two locations at the Meadows Mall, only locations in Vegas right now. One is in the food court near the mall entrance with more seating. The one we went to was the one downstairs in the middle of the mall near Bath & Body Works and The Disney Store.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,7,7,5,qtijOLZTtNp1TgM_paDTKw

5260776,2016-09-17,0,OyTSs71uXNDeC14zsPA5jw,I've read several reviews before going. I went and was greeted by a young lady (didn't catch her name) I asked for a pineapple dole whip. I asked for a direct pour since a lot of people mentioned about the empty hole. I did ask and she said the reason why they swirl it is because they weigh the amount given. So for everyone complaining about the hole it's not their  fault it's company policy. I only went for the dole whip and I was happy. Will be going back.,_tKckzzITu2XYyDfxqqqpg,3,0,5,R8HurXBaP0uGjFUFx-76QQ
5289263,2017-11-18,4,OyTSs71uXNDeC14zsPA5jw,"We wanted something sweet after our loss at the YMCA gym across the street back in September so we came here after checking on Yelp. What we didn't realize is this was inside a mall (That's what happens when you're just here for the weekend). 

Anytime someone writes ""Real Hawaiian Shave Ice"" or the ""World's best shave ice"" I have to put it to the litmus test. That is, for me to come and taste it.  Not saying I have the best tongue for the job (tho my tongue can be good for something else...lol), but I've tasted many and here my take on this place inside the Meadows Mall. 

First when you walk in, you see a mixture of albums and skating. Then this place sells shave ice along with dole whip and Thrifty ice cream. The food choices are great, the decor I wasn't sure what they were going for: A sports theme or just a fan of music. But regardless of either one, there were more uncertainties. 

They advertised on the counter to buy a giftcard for $10 and you get $15 worth.  Which at first sounded great, and when we arrived at the register after the line here, the girl at the counter told us we can use the $10 now, but the $5 later? Which makes zero sense because if we were to gift this gift card, wouldn't the recipient be a little pissed thinking they can only use partial at a time? 

So regardless of us trying to save some money, we as a group all bought shave ice and ice cream anyways. The inside is very tiny, seats about 3 parties for a total of about 10 to 12 people. And the wait for shave ice was not short either, it took nearly 20 minutes from order to receiving it finally. 

The verdict? A little sweet on the syrup, but the ice itself is fine and perfect.  This place doesn't have the usual Hawaiian flavors like POG but I would say the choices were decent.  I do think the price/quantity ratio is a bit expensive for what you get. 

After our party had received our shave ice, the counter lady gave us a small dole whip on the house. Quite nice, tho it didn't have that cap at the bottom of the dispenser so it kind of looked like tasty yellow poop. 

I realized this place had restaurant.com gift certificates after the visit. I wished I had known because I would've done that instead of asking to purchase the awkward gift card.",GaTWkVy-pY6phZOqW6ykuw,4,3,3,q7I-QQQJR0HeRO_jURf01A

5517478,2015-07-14,1,OyTSs71uXNDeC14zsPA5jw,"Beats having to track a food truck down just to get it. We used to go to the shave ice stand at the indoor swap meet on decatur and Snow ono...but since they all closed down...this is by far the next best thing. It's the closest thing to Hawaiian Shave Ice as you can get! They even serve that famous Dole. 

I love that it is situated in a mall. Beats having to stand in the sun on a scorching hot summer day with 2 kids, a toddler, and a baby in tow. It's located in the food court across the nail shop. How is a nail shop in a food court? It's not really, just gotta walk down a few steps after Panda Express and boom.

As for the clutter of random candy sold on their counter...I don't mind it. It just reminds me of the mom and pop shops back in HI. 4 stars because it only comes in 1 size. Wish they offered at least a kid size for those with children...5 bucks a kid is pretty steep and a waste if they don't finish it. So why don't I just use my brain and split between kids? Welp, with all the flavors to choose from...none of my boys will want to share or give up portioning. They'll end up fighting trying to scoop some of whoever has shave ice left. Nothing like a bunch of kids fighting to ruin the vibe. Lol

I can go on but you gotta go for yourself. You won't be disappointed and it really is a great treat esssspecially if you have dairy allergies (as a few of my kids do). 
Eat up then shop up after! Haha...",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,2,1,4,YlO8YhuvBpgbRY4wTl6-rQ

Took my wife here cause I told her it was like island style environment. Went there it was busy. Took an order of ice cream , shave ice and the dole whip. 

One the guy messed up the order gave someone else's order then skip our order by 8 people. Wife been waiting for almost 30 mins. Gave my wife the dole wipe  then messed up the order again for the 5th time. Saying we only order one thing. And that my son had chocolate ice cream. 

Another 10 mins pass still waiting on my daughters shave us after receiving the shave ice the quality was not great at all. Didn't look like what the other people had. Like they rush the order just to get it out. Well this is just one Yelp view and this place has a such high rate cause others where being taken care of. But my family was not very said cause I hype up my wife to go here and we live in the other side of town. 

Well I would come here again for the first guy that served me. But if I see these two again I refuse to go.

5715433,2015-06-29,2,OyTSs71uXNDeC14zsPA5jw,"Yesterday 6-28-15 around 2PM I got a strong hankering for a Dole Whip.   I turned to my trusty friend, Yelp, and found this place.  
I was so torn because I wanted a shave ice AND  a Dole Whip...but get this...you can get your shave ice ""snow-capped"", meaning a little dollop of dole whip ON TOP OF YOUR SHAVE ICE. Genius.  The shave ice is $5 and there's only one size, the snow-cap was like 50, so the total with tax was $5.95.  
The shave ice was very nicely shaped and had an adequate amount of tiger's blood syrup on it.  My only complaints would be the syrup was just sweet...there was no sourness or acidity to it, and the texture was more icy than I'm used to for shave ice.  I prefer Sno Ono...DAT DOLE WHIP THO....oooh lordy it was good.  
The gal working was nice...she really took her time and made our treats lovely and delicious.  They were playing techno music on a big screen tv and I saw a DJ turntable...they're going for an EDC vibe I think.  It was clean enough but the front is completely cluttered with miscellaneous junk like candies for sale, broken suckers, a valentine's gift basket??? Bizarre...looks like they should do a little spring cleaning. 
Overall not bad, and I'd come back.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,1,2,4,crZSdI--7GbfxiOf-PhbRQ
5760264,2016-09-02,0,OyTSs71uXNDeC14zsPA5jw,Awesome place. Was craving something new and not to far. Located in the food court and atmosphere was okay. It was kinda loud so I had to talk really loud to get my order across. Service was fast. Would come back and recommend this place. My friend tried the dole whip and they even had a raspberry flavor which tasted yummy. The candy kinda threw me off didn't really fit with the theme.,5qQ_p-UbtsK9pCZe_khiag,0,1,3,kbT-D3eXEDgVHcWfEE0StQ
