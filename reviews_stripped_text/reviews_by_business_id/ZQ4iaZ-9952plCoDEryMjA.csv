I eat alot of sushi in the Seattle and Vancouver area and the sushi rice was really poorly done. The rice is the basis for sushi and they got it wrong. It was rice that was cooked with too much water and was mushy. Service is good, but that does make up for poorly done sushi.",GJaODcpqqsfk_BG1jIjj6g,0,0,3,FDPxnfIKFHKm9fdjzs-UOA

Hostess called 2 hrs prior to reservation to confirm and let us know main dining room not open. Told me it was on website but IT IS NOT! Said we didn't have to eat there and if I wanted we could cancel. But no notice to find another place. Ate in Lounge--akin to a fishbowl with gawkers in sweaty shorts walking by. So much for a ""nice, high end"" dinner out. Robata was far too salty and cold. Sushi was terrible--mushy rice and mealy fish. Thankfully my husband suggested we only order minimally at first to see how the food was before going crazy. Best choice! Spoke to Manager after paying and he cut me off telling me that Hotel knew main room not open and I should have been told. It wasn't! Told me I could have cancelled and gone some place else!

376510,2017-07-24,0,ZQ4iaZ-9952plCoDEryMjA,"We visited OTORO yesterday 7/23/17 and had an exceptional experience, but it was 99% due to our server, Pauline. I do not know if Pauline is a manager or in a Leadership position, but OTORO/The Mirage Hotel execs need to seriously offer her a Leadership position where she teaches her service skills if not. 

My wife and I needed a quick, light, basic meal before seeing a show, and despite our very basic order, Pauline gave us royal treatment with skill and devotion. 

Having been taught, and continuing to study customer service and hotelier acumen, my wife I have fairly high standards for service and Pauline got high marks in every area. From noticing my wife's vision problems while guiding us to the tables and pointing out the stair steps in the low light environment, to asking us from the start if we were seeing any shows in order to expedite our service, to her knowledgeable, helpful, and unpretentiousness guidance on our menu questions, to her overall humble, yet steadfast demeanor, Pauline represented the best in a dining and host/guest experience. Masters courses in customer service should come and study Pauline's technique. She reminds me of those who understand service does not mean ""servitude"" but a noble and honorable old world skill of being a good host. She is THE reason I would make repeated visits to OTORO on my Vegas visits. 

The food was of good quality. I had the poke salad and my wife the soba noodle salad which is not much to judge the food on, so we do look forward to visiting again when we have more time. The price point was significantly higher than what I prefer to pay, but not uncommon for Las Vegas fine dining. I was extremely pleased to see Chimay Bleue on the beer menu. That too is a sign that someone in their purchasing or the F&B Director has great taste and ""Gets it."" 

Again though, if you are listening OTORO/Mirage Hotel management, keep your eyes on Pauline and take good care of her. She is a highly valuable asset and made our simple dinning experience a delightful memory we will cherish for years to come.",YAwxFb09bSeHq7dWQUnDrw,0,0,5,OR9YpOxLsJ-JYlWpraf0Cg

1094513,2018-03-28,0,ZQ4iaZ-9952plCoDEryMjA,"This restaurant was just okay, nothing special, and definitely overpriced. Had plans to watch The Beatles LOVE show here at the Mirage with the in-laws, so decided to check this restaurant out for convenience. The husband was aware that the price was on the hefty side, but due to the great reviews and pictures on Yelp, he was excited to go all out and treat his parents out to a fine-dining experience. We ordered 2 sushi rolls (Rainbow and Hana), a half dozen of fresh oysters, and a handful of tapa style items from their Robata grill menu. The oysters were fresh and refreshing, and the items from the Robata grill menu were tasty too. However, we felt that the price was way too overpriced for the portion and quality of the food. The sushi rolls were the biggest disappointment because having them priced at $20 for 8 measly bite-sized pieces (which is the most we've paid for any sushi rolls), our expectations were a lot higher for them. The husband and I both agreed that they were not even as good as the ones we normally get from our favorite all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant back in our hometown in Orange County. We understand that tapa plates are meant to be smaller portioned, but after trying the quality of them, we decided that it was not wise to keep ordering. We also felt gypped when one of the oysters' shell was cracked in half which also reduced the oyster meat in half. One of the roll pieces was also the ugly, leftover end piece which was skimpier than it already was with barely any fish on it. Paying $2.50 ~ $3.33 for one small bite, I expect them to be full bite sizes at least. The service was excellent and the waitress put immense effort to converse with us. The busboy also stopped by our table to change out our plate after every single item that we ate. We felt that we were essentially paying more for high quality service than high quality food. I rather have my plates changed out less often as I find it unnecessary to have them changed out after every single piece of food I eat (and that's also waste of water for extra dish washing), and have the food be more in proportion to its price instead. In conclusion, we left the restaurant paying $40 per person and only 20% full.",NEPXt3GjXwribBAyXpWfKQ,0,0,3,vqnZ3ucW7l21hh15gmZ7eg

1562816,2017-08-21,0,ZQ4iaZ-9952plCoDEryMjA,"Quality at a price.

My boyfriend and I chose this place given its convenient location within the Mirage where we were staying. No reservation needed for a Friday night.

We started by selecting items off their robatayaki menu, which involves slow grilling food over charcoal. The skewer portions are similar to the small plates you find at an izakaya, and the ordering system is similar to that at dimsum places. We decided to go for skewers of salmon ($8 for 2 decently-sized pieces), day boat scallop ($9 for 2 small scallops), chicken meatballs ($7.5 for 2 pieces), and pork belly ($7 for 2 decently-sized slices). I liked the pork belly the most (umami indeedy), followed by the salmon (juicy but a bit flavorless aside from glaze on top, but that's because I'm spoiled by homemade broiled marinated salmon). The chicken meatballs tasted odd--not a fan.

I usually don't order rolls if I can avoid it, but they were the more cost efficient options on the menu. We opted for the Surf & Turf roll, $21, with spicy snow crab and salmon rolled into rice and topped with seared sirloin, and the Bakuchi roll, $19, with spicy yellowtail and fresh yellowtail seasoned with white onion and jalapeño. I enjoyed both rolls, especially the chew that the sirloin lends to the Surf & Turf. Also, the jalapeño seemed to have hopped from the Bakuchi to the Surf & Turf, giving the Surf & Turf a spicy profile and the Bakuchi a crisp profile due to the onion. FYI, both rolls come with 8 pieces but are about half the diameter of normal rolls, which is unfortunate given the price tag.

We didn't consume any otoro during our meal, but OTORO was a good choice! Just don't be surprised by the sticker shock ;)",sPqHcRC--tRanPC-g4pNwQ,0,0,4,XevSNhWN7iF-EJFQeU4NRw

I am VERY particular about sushi  so when I'm craving I already have my spots picked out and rarely venture,  as it is very easy to get disappointed.

Ambiance and presentation were great. Loved the sushi bar that went all along the side wall of the restaurant. Beautiful, Zen like tree in the middle of the restaurant and LOVED the tables with the ""couch"" like seating. Service and friendliness was top notch. 

Now the food! I had the Small Chef's choice which included an array of Nigiri, Sashimi and rolls. Felt as though the price for the amount was very reasonable. Everything was so fresh and yummy. Now the hit for my wife and I would have to say a surprise for me was the Robata Grill. We picked from all the categories; vegetables, seafood, beef and poultry.

She took forever to get our drinks, didn't seem like she cared at all about giving service or working for that matter, we saw her standing at the entrance where the hostess is located talking to 2 girls one in a suit whom I believe is the supervisor or manager and the hostess. They were loud and just not concern about doing their job, socializing was their priority. What a poor display of professionalism. I have been here as I said before and never saw something like this. I recommend this place for the food and i give it 5 stars but make sure you sit at the other side of the restaurant where this waitress is at. She should be fired or definitely retrained, as for the supervisor she should know better. Hope on my next visit things have improved.",jm3EqkhrP4ExoxYVT1R6VQ,1,0,1,mFcyrdTh4YI8jt37Ra_7MQ

3751566,2017-10-05,1,ZQ4iaZ-9952plCoDEryMjA,"I hope my review does this fabulous restaurant justice.

There are many factors that come into consideration when considering what separates a good, from a great, and from a memorable dining experience:  Food, presentation, ambience, service - all working in concert with each other so that it appears more organic than synchronized is a rare experience - and so it was last night at Otoro in the Mirage.

There were 10 of us - all brought together in Vegas from Ireland and Los Angeles for a wedding.  As regulars at the Mirage, we were putting all of our eggs in Otoro's basket and hoping that the evening would be as impressive to our guests as the food would be delicious.  Nobody was disappointed, and without getting lost in the review - I want to send props out to our server, David.  He was the concertmaster to what was a symphony of great dishes.

The Spicy Seafood Ramen will call me back, probably tomorrow before I leave. It arrives lush, piping hot and visually as impressive as it tastes.  Everyone else's dishes appeared perfect.  When you have a table of Irishmen and women, expect some complaints and vague reference s to the chefs mother.  There were none last night, only compliments and toasts to the newlyweds.  

Vegas is hurting at the moment, and we need to support this vibrant city.  Otoro Robata Grill & Sushi is one thing that is great about this town, in a hotel that has been our second home for many years.  The Mirage continues to morph and re-invent itself.

The cod dish that we ordered was also served less-than-hot and was not particularly flavorful. The dish was also quite small, although this may have been a gesture of mercy.  

The cod was followed by various charcoal-grilled meats that all tasted the same, from the chicken to the steak. And in an impressive nod to consistency, these too were brought to the table cold. 

I had intended to finish with some sushi, but by that point in the meal I had lost my faith in the kitchen. (Although I suppose that the sushi was more likely to be served at the right temperature.)

On the plus side, the grilled steak on a hot stone was good, and my cocktail was delicious. I had no complaints about the service either.

Was seated promptly and had an awesome waitress that started with a ""S"" with dark short straight hair and she was awesome and nice and we had her running around with our large group. Food comes out from 3 different kitchens so it's kind of slow and here and there. Started with sake, edamame, and miso soup. Then ordered some Robata from the fire grill which was amazing. Robata is like mini skewers that they cook over a fire grill and it's only like 4 small pieces of meat per skewer but it's so tasty! Prices range from $9-$42 (wagyu is the highest priced). My favorites were the sea bass and the octopus. The octopus was seriously flavored and cooked so perfectly I have never had it prepared that way before. I'm craving that now! I'm not a plain octopus fan either but I am now! Then we ordered some rolls and sashimi and the Rok. The Rok is cool because it's a 500 degree rock that they serve you and you out the thin raw steak on it that is marinaded and it cooks in front of you in like a minute. So tasty and novel idea for a fun table. Ordered the Dreamy Clouds Sake and had about 5 bottles of the stuff. Light and easy and slightly sweet. Bill came to like $750 with gratuity included and had a slight problem with the timing of some of our food since we had a show to catch but spoke with the manager and he soon took that off the bill since we didn't eat it and all was well.

We sat in the bar/lounge and ordered wine and a bunch of sushi/robata. The food was good, I especially liked the Tiger Roll and sashimi/nigiri lives up to LV strip quality and freshness. 

Unfortunately the service left a bit to be desired. Our waitress, Dana, was having an off night. The wine arrived after the first course was finished and there were several botched orders that were wrong /completely missing or had to be reordered. Oops.

I however can safely say that this is one of the worst places I have ever eaten for the money. If the prices were one-third what they were I would say it is a 4-star however based on what they charge I would say it is less than a one star. They literally have $10 eggplant options for appetizers that are two slivers of eggplant which realistically is about a maximum of $0.20 and they charge $10 and it's not even good. Order there Lobster appetizer which is $18 and again 3 oz which means they are charging nearly $120 is a pound and it is disgusting. Shrimp appetizer $12 for $1 worth of shrimp that is not even good..... the concern is not the price however the food. If the food was three times more money yet good it would be different however for what the quality is and the flavors it should be 1/3 the price. This should be a fast food restaurant.... I eat everywhere and this is very rare that I make a post negatively however I am so offended by the prices on the quality that it was a must that I stop people from going here if they read my post. This is Vegas literally the capital of food quality and I would go anywhere but here even if it is 3 times the price because at least you will have good food.....

The king crab skewer was NOT fresh. They try to compensate with the butter,but when it comes to seafood it's hard to make up for that. I would expect that At a low end buffet offering, but here? 
As for the sushi, we only tried some rolls, but considering that one was labeled as the house specialty, we expected decent. Nothing special here, you are better off in a strip mall. Keep in mind this is only for the rolls and the few pieces of fish that were present were good. For example, I. Their Philly offering, the cream cheese should be an additional component, to add a texture not be the main element and compensate for the lack of anything else.

Mirage needs to look into this restaurant because damn they're a waste of space In such a wonderful casino. Of course the place is beautiful inside and drinks are good but anyone can do that. Now food, I can honestly say is disgusting. I don't say that word much at all but it's literally gross. Embarrassing to Japanese sushi as well. Their rolls are sad, they are cut into 6 huge pieces which are just not enjoyable at all. Their huge and full of rice! At that was just a California and phile roll that was ordered I can't even imagine the others. Now onto the main course which we ordered the seafood soup and chicken rice bowl. First off the rice was just almost like rotten flavors to it. How can you make rice taste bad? But they cook it and flavor it with who knows what but it's just not right. Than the chicken was battered and was burnt to a crisp. To top that off a huge bone sticks out the side of the chicken piece which is just not classy because once cooked all the nasty redness turns into black and it mushy around that bone piece. Seafood soup was just okay, the broth to it was bland and they put a few pieces of seafood in there that were gone in literally three bites. Our appetizer calamari was the only dish that was actually good. The batter was perfect it was cooked perfect and the flavors added with the sauce on the plate was great. I believe it was a wasabi type of sauce that's brushed on the side of the plate to compliment the calamari. BUT of course there's a but, the portion was so small it was so tiny I couldn't help but to count how many strands of calamari there was on the plate which turned out to be 13 tiny little pieces of calamari. For a table of four that plate was gone within 1 minute. Out bill turned out to be $176.00 with just those items. It would have been perfectly fine if the food was great as expected on the strip and inside a great hotel like Mirage. I highly do not recommend and really hope they do some changes because I'm not that picky of an eater at all. But that food after the rice bowl we didn't even finish made my mouth water up in a bad way almost wanting to throw up. Sorry to say but it's the truth and it hurts to pay for such sad dishes.",SaCb2s1SnXuOgG6OCMLurQ,1,0,1,oPWer08i0QLT84iLIsdgQQ
