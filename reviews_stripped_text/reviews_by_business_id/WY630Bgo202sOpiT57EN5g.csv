Let's begin with a useful quote: ""It is what it is."" 

It's Pizza Hut. But! It's not every Pizza Hut. It's just this one Pizza Hut... and the Pizza Huts of 30+ years ago. (Back when ""Pizza Hut vs. Pizza Inn"" was as likely a topic of contention among friends as ""Coke vs. Pepsi."") The rushed concoctions bulk-built in those Wingstreet regret factories made for carryout and delivery only? Or worse, the little cafes inside Target stores? Not the same thing.

We visited this Pizza Hut for the first time last month specifically to try the  buffet, something neither of us had tasted in decades but we both had fond memories of. This is the only Pizza Hut left in town that still offers buffet. The next one's in Boulder City. The buffet runs from 10-3 every day and recently was added to Tuesday evenings.

My expectations were as follows: freshly made food, more than one vegetarian option, not too greasy, decent ingredients, courteous service, and a non-skeezy dining atmosphere.

I have no idea why I'm not giving this Pizza Hut a five, honestly. They hit if not surpassed all of the above. Pure snobbery on my part, I think. It's hard to give five stars to a chain with a ripped sofa-bench by the cash register and a grim (but adequately safe and spacious) parking lot, but I'm hard pressed to find anything else to criticize. I guess I can't give it a 5 because it's not my favourite pizza in the valley, but it's in the top five.

The hostess/waitress was genuinely personable and was interested in describing to us how the pizzas were made so they wouldn't be like delivery-style Pizza Hut. The pizzas on the buffet (so many types that they ran out of room to place them) were piping hot and replaced as soon as the tray was empty. Refills on soda came before they were needed. The salad bar was neat, fresh, and beat most Strip buffets in terms of the build-your-own ingredients.

The pizzas themselves were good. I had both cheese pizza and a veggie works. There were five different meat options with varying crusts plus a dessert pizza. On the side was baked pasta,breadsticks, and marinara sauce. Nothing was soggy or greasy about the pizzas, unlike what I order online from my local PH in dark moments of being too tired to leave the sofa. I still prefer Northside Nathan's and Grimaldi's, but this held its own. 

Where else are you going to drop in for a relaxing, casual pizza buffet that lives up to wholesome childhood memories?

(Do *not* say Cici's. Cici's is a playdate flash mob that happens to serve food. At Pizza Hut you can sit, enjoy the meal, and not dodge grotty toddlers under the fluorescent lights.)

Consider this a 4.5 star review that will get evened out when my husband writes his review and gives it a 5. I know, I know: PIZZA HUT. 

Look, we're not comparing it to some eatery at the Cosmopolitan or a micropub with handwritten menus or a big chain with scripted service. It is what it is is. And, if you judge it strictly in the ""affordable, family-friendly (including families without kids) salad/pizza stop in a homey and hospitable environment, with food that, while not amazing, is solid in flavour and reflects preparation and pride in care"" category, what it is is a winner.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,4,2,4,13I5NwOpt1Ld4REvTR3ToA

5.99 Lunch buffet, YES PLEASE! I used to live in Colorado and had one right by the house; cheapest and best pizza buffet imo. Of course as soon as they bring out new pizzas the people flock to it like vultures on a dead cow. But I love that they have cinna stix. The server was Meh, but the little beaner one we had the next time was suave. I'm a beaner fyi so I could say that... lol. She was awesome, the first one asked how old my 5yr old was and said she would have to charge him full price and I was like wtf?! He ate 1 slice of pizza!! (my son hardly eats, hes a skinny mini!!) but this next one didnt ask and didnt charge! My kinda woman!

Anyway, pizza here is good... salad is ok, and the service is meh if you get the good ONE. Also, seems like they always only have 1 waitress there; so I always tip a little better... unless she tries to charge me full price for the mini!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,0,0,4,5uxzuufXxX-qO3Ua1gjnqQ

We didn't really do pizza, and if we did we were ordering in Hungry Howie's. So, I admit some of the nostalgia is lost on me. 

Alas, this PH seemed to be getting a little buzz, and it's in our hood. We decided to give it a shot for a quick lunch. For $5.99, it satiated our hunger quite nicely. The salad bar was fresh, and I love the carrot sticks. When we arrived, the buffet appeared to be mostly meat pizzas. They did not appear to be fresh out of the oven. However, by the time we finished up our salads, they brought out a new veggie lovers. I hadn't experienced black olives on a pizza in quite some time, and those guys were potent! The Pizza Hut crust seems a little box-like to me, and call me crazy, but their cheese seems to pack a bigger than average sodium punch. I didn't feel great about myself afterwards, but I was no longer hungry. 

The pizza wasn't spectacular, but for the price, it works when you need to eat a lot and eat it quickly! Value earns them that third star!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,7,4,3,z2ZgkMy6MhQAPi1UGEWA-Q
