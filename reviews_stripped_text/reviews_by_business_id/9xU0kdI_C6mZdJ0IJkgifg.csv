My boyfriend and I have been going here for a while since it's near our house. Although it's not the same as Kai sushi and Brians Beach (my two fav sushi joints but located SW of Vegas), Yoko Hama Sushi is not that bad. They offer happy hour from 2pm to 4pm and 9pm to 12am. The all you can eat happy hour is $17.99 and $19.99 (not bad at all). For regular price all you can eat it is $25.95 for dinner and I think $23.95 for lunch. 

The service is great because since we go here a lot the lady always knows what we want to drink which is iced green tea and she never leaves it empty. If you sit at the bar the chiefs are really nice, they always make sure everything is okay. 

Must tries: 
Screaming orgasm (by far my favorite, you will not be disappointed) 
Tako (if you like octopus) 
Yellowtail (delicious) 
Surf Clam (Mmmm yummy) 
Tuna kari (a kick for your mouth) 
Baked Mussels (fantabulous)
Tempura green tea ice cream (what a great way to end you delicious meal)",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,4,2,4,XMozcxFrYuFNtRup0JyWyA

I got to know the chefs and they got to know what I liked, But the next time I came - the chefs had changed and I started all over.  That happened over and over.  Why is that? low pay?  

Over time the chefs got sloppier and the recipes didn't get passed from one chef to the next...Several times the rice was either over or under-done.

We nicely told them in advance about the groupon voucher as we were seated. She said we could only use 1 voucher but it was clearly stated 2 vouchers allowed for a table of 6 or more. After talking to the manager, she accepted the vouchers. The waitress collected our order sheet and disappeared for a while. She came back to inform us that they were ""out"" of uni (sea urchin) and sweet shrimp, as you know those two are the most expensive items in the menu (coincindence? I think not!) And she started giving us BS about how they were out of both since Saturday and their vendor close on Sunday. We were so disappointed but decided to give them a try since we were hungry. It took more than 20 minutes just to bring out the first batch. The place wasn't even packed at the time. The sushi did not look fresh and tasted bad. The tuna was pink. The salmon was pale. At one point the chef signaled us to pick up our own foods. Drinks were not replenished until we were about to leave. When we asked to get the receipt, the waitress said she couldn't give it to us because we used groupon (seriously???).

We started eating here sporadically about 3 years agoi and it was hit or miss.  About 18 months they hired two incredible sushi chefs.  Ryan is one of the two chefs, and he is still there.  There are two things that get you better sushi in this restaurant:  First get to know the owner (thin japanese lady in her late forties/early fiftties), and second talk to the chefs and get to know them.  Ryan is a great chef, and if you tell him what kinds of fish you like, he will make you the most exquisite dishes.  There are a few places that might have better sushi, but they are not AYCE (all you can eat).  I would much prefer to come to Yoko and pay them $20-$25 per person for AYCE, instead of paying $200-$250 for the few other places in town that might have a slight better taste.

**the food** The food was... well.. Average. There wasn't anything stand out. The Agedashi tofu was really good, but you go there for sushi, not tofu. The fish seemed fresh enough, but teetering towards the edge of ""uhoh"", and I just wish it was more memorable. We just went a week ago and I honestly couldn't name a single roll on the menu.

**The AYCE rules** I know that all AYCE sushi joints have rules, but this place had more rules than rolls. They had the usual ""waste not want not"" rule, but it also extended to rice too. Plus they had a time limit and all the good items, like Green Mussels and Mochi, were all One per person. Sadness- it made my tummy cry... 

**The service** lol, perhaps the only saving point was the Korean chef who spent most of the night cracking of the wise. The two waitresses spent the whole evening chatting in the corner and acted like you were inconveniencing them by asking for anything. Also, WOW, you should have seen the look of sheer disgust on her face when I asked for the obligatory post-dinner mochi. Yeah, I know I have a big bum and hips, it goes with the territory of being Sicilian, but don't look at me like I am trying to eat your child's arm when I ask for some mochi.. Seriously, it really made me feel like a schmuck...

**Over all** We only went their initially because it is close to home, work and our schools, and that will be the only time we go. The price was fairly high for the food and service, I paid more there than at any other AYCE sushi joint, ever.. and that was before the tip..",wPvp7ok3vK43HRE4Y930LA,1,1,2,90kCE097i64Subm1k7wNQg

The Volcano Roll, which is a baked california roll topped with scallops and mayo and rolled up in salmon,

The Tuna Karai Sashimi, which is an awesome Japanese version of Hawaiian poke,

This is an AYCE sushi joint with 2 order limits on Uni, Amaebi, desserts (ugh..at Sushi Mon, AYCE desserts)  and Mussels. You can't order half rolls like Sushi Mon, and their service was exxxxtra slow this time. (Maybe because the chef was watching football more than half the time.)
When me and the hubbs tried the Uni, it was not as fresh as we'd like so we took a gamble on it. Thank God we didn't get a stomach ache. There was only one waitress/cashier and she was trying her hardest to keep everyone satisfied, so kudos to her.

In my entire existence, I never saw beer battered tempura until I decided to stop by this place.  Not only was it the worst tempura ever, it was greasy, mostly batter, and flavorless.  Someone needs to teach the Mexican guy in the back (yes, he was, I heard him talk and he came out a few times) how to cook real Japanese food.

Their curry was boxed Japanese brown curry.  I could buy that at the Asian market for 2 bucks, and they charged us 12.  

I won't even mention the sushi because it was flash frozen fish, thawed, and served.  I believe that's a sin to serve frozen fish for sushi.  I've seen off strip places serve real fish, fresh ones, and to serve all-you-can-eat frozen fish is a disgrace.

Food: worst sushi place I've ever been too and I eat a lot of sushi. The sushi at this place taste like plastic and the portions suck. Its like 70% rice and 30% sushi and we all know the crab meat is imitation, so what part of it is even real fish? The only thing that was decent was the bento boxes. The most recent time I went there it was super dead, they had like 1 person there which I think was a groupon person because they were arguing with the customer about what their groupon really meant. Then I saw the waitress taping up a sign about groupon customers right in front of that groupon customer. How rude? Well back to my experience, when you order a bento box you get either a California roll or tuna roll with teriyaki, salad, fried veggies and tempura, and rice. Everything in the bento box was decent expcept the rolls. This sushi chef during lunch hours must've been new people my rolls weren't even rolls they were falling apart! and super small portions. 

Service: The waitress lady was kind of rude to the groupon customer and when it came to me she seemed to totally ignore my table. She never came to refill my drink or ever came to ask if I was doing okay. I had a hard time flagging her down to get my check I literally had to get up and walk to the counter and ask for my check.

I got a Groupon for Yoko based off the fact it was close to my boyfriend's house. The Groupon was for $30. Originally I had planned on just ordering a few rolls that my boyfriend and I would split because he's not huge on sushi. He's more of a Cali Roll and ""I'll try it, but won't like it"" sushi eater while I'm the ""I'll eat anything and probably like it"" sushi eater. Therefore doing an AYCE typically isn't the best idea. However, the girl sold it to us because with the Groupon it would be like a buy one get one. Wish I hadn't done it.

First off, the AYCE here is $25.99. Look, I'm not cheap, but if I'm going to pay $25.99 for anything it better be good quality and the sushi here is not good quality. The fish was okay, it was the preparation that was inconsistent and poor. Half of our rolls were terribly put together. Every time I picked one up the rice would fall off. There were a few pieces that didn't even have fish in them. The only rolls that looked like they had any time put into them were the specialty rolls. Also, the nigiri was kind of warm. Freaks me out when my fish is on the verge of being warm.

The ambiance is nice, the seating around the bar was as well. They were playing some top 40s music and there was a decent amount of people there, but I won't be back, even if they do offer another Groupon.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,2,HN4FaFo2fSnbw2ZbdBRxIg

The fish was fresh and very tasty. We did the 25 dollar all you can eat and it was very much worth it. (EDIT)
I am changing the end of my original review. This is because the last three times we have gone in the quality has dropped quite a bit. The rice is hard and does not taste right. Also the quality of fish has suffered as well. On a piece of yellowtail sushi the scales were still on it. And the salmon and smoked salmon sushi is not good at all.

#3 They don't make half rolls

#4  I wanted a roll on the menu made into a hand roll and he wouldn't do it for me (and yes it was very easy to do if he wanted to)

#5, They don't carry my favorite item Natto (fermented soybean)

#6 One time they wouldn't serve me uni (sea urchin)  and I saw him with the whole container and I complained to the manager and she said it probably wasn't fresh (I think he just didn't want to serve it)  and now I find out they only serve it on Friday and Saturday because that's when they get a good quality.  (My other favorite place SUSHI MON, has it everyday and always has a good quality) 

#7 I filled up my stamp card and they wouldn't let me use it on the same night and told me I had to come back and use it on the next visit. (It didn't make sense and I was pissed because I didn't expect to pay that night) AND they don't include my drink (iced green tea) like SUSHI MON AND HIKARI SUSHI. 

#8 So I come back 4 days later use my free meal and my bill should've been about $3 due to the drink, and it was over $6 because she charged me the tax for the full all you can eat meal EVEN THOUGH IT WAS FREE!!  I said how can you charge me tax on a free meal and she said I come there all the time and I should know this.

Even though this place has some menu items that are different and not offered at my other 2 places that I REALLY enjoy , it's not enough to keep me coming back. I'm tired of the excuses, and the little things they are trying to get away with and not really caring about the customer.  

It's their loss too, because I spend a LOT of money on going out to all you can eat sushi, on avg 3 times a week. I guess my business will continue to goto Sushi Mon and Hikari sushi.

You can opt for either ordering rolls a'la carte or go for the All You Can eat option depending on just how many rolls you can eat.

AYCE is about $25 and the average price for their rolls is about $9, so if you can eat more than three whole rolls, make sure to go for the all you can eat option. 

My current favorite here and will probably be my favorite for a while is the Volcano which is Salmon wrapped cream cheese with scallop topping set ablaze with cooking wine while it's transported to your table, so you have a mouth watering inferno sizzling away in front of you and you have to wait for the fire to go out, because if you try to grab one of those yummy sizzling morsels and just shove it in your mouth and try to chew it while it's on fire it FREAKING hurts! especially when you try to cool it down with HOT tea Arrrggghhhh!....The Pain!!!

In business, just like in life, it is the little things that matters.

As far as the food.  I have no complaint, except that uni is always out when I decided to go.  It could just me my poor timing plus it is not a deal breaker for me.
