My husband had been working 48 hours straight and on the cranky side called and wasn't very nice to the young boy that picked up the phone (West I believe his name was). He was very nice and apologetic. As soon as my husband got off the phone I scolded him for being rude and he felt bad. I drove back to apologize. Instead of them being upset with me due to my husband they were extremely apologetic and very nice. West said not to worry about it and he completely understood. The young girl at the cash register was also very sorry. Everyone always seems very nice whenever I go there.,_-BoZP9m-rWshuQwW5nVlg,0,0,5,wujemzifLjgnFGeVTJtCBg

I went back today and got my free pizza and again it had very little sauce on it. I would go to Pizza Hut if I wanted a pizza without sauce on it. Little Caesars use to load up on the sauce. The obnoxious clerk at the counter is so rude. He has worked there for quite sometime now. He is so loud and has no customer service at all. I walked in today and he had his back to me washing his hands and yells out hello so loud that even his coworker told him he needed to take it down 5 notches. So it is not just me. He told his coworker that he did not need to take it down any. If this was my store I would never have someone of this caliber representing my company.

For the money you just can't beat it. They have $5 large pepperoni and cheese only pizzas ready and waiting for you. We've been to this one a number of times and the pizzas are always good, never taste like they've been sitting forever. If you've never had a sleezers pizza before I'll tell you what they are like...the crust is on the thin side (and isn't the best cold, if you like the left overs definitely want to nuke it or put it in the oven) the cheese is good and the sauce has a nice unassuming flavor. Highly recommend some crazy bread to accompany your pizza. There is some nice garlic butter on it and cheese sprinkled on.....if you really adventurous go for the Italian cheese bread....it is quite a delight!

I totally love their pizzas the crust and dough are a hit with me and my family. Of course we like other high end pizza but we always come back to Caesars pizza one of the few pizza that I can eat cold right out of the refrigerator.

Now I was a fan of Little Caesars  when I was young it was a lot of pizza for cheap and as teenagers that was good lol but I had not tried it in 20 years.
I would say if the pizza is fresh and hasn't been sitting there long like the fast and ready pepperoni its not bad however sometimes they seem a bit old if business is slow.
Its better to order a special one and not the fast and ready ones for a tastier fresher pizza.
Out of all the other pizza joints fast food style they are better I think its not great pizza but its OK for a cheap take home to the kids for a quick dinner.
Time will tell if they get there act together and last I think he biggest hurdle is making sure there not serving pizzas that have been sitting there for 30 minutes plus and are already hard and dried out.
I will keep trying them from time to time to see how it goes so far the quality hasn't always been good sometimes its OK and sometimes its not good.
I wouldn't mind if they stayed in business its nice for a quick pizza and really all the other places are not good at all except of course the oldest one in fallon but they are a bit pricey.
I do have to say the other pizza place starts with a D wont be in business long only reason they were around this long is they delivered.",1RAJ46MnzMjnflM8c8ZrAg,0,0,3,takwezkrNc1YZEvwjc4DBQ

Wait, you've never been to a Little Caesar's? Their big thing is that they have a $5 pizza ready for pick up all the time. It's not the best pizza ever, and it's only slightly better than the frozen $3 pizza at Target, but it's ""hot and ready"" so I guess it's not the worst. They also have an $8 pizza that has extra meat or something, but I've never ordered it. It's probably also just ok.

Also, they have the other traditional things the other pizza places have, such as soda, breadsticks, wings... all that stuff. You can probably get a ton of food for your large group for like $20. It's certainly a deal if cost is your main concern. 

Ok, that aside, the service here was actually pretty damn good. In my case, I had to pick up a ton of pizza, and they were really polite, really good about letting me know I was kinda early so it'd be like three more minutes, and I was welcome to sit and wait or whatever. On one of the other pick-ups, they were actually kinda behind on their pizzas because they said one of their two ovens was down, so they were slow. I get that stuff happens, and my pizzas were only late by about 10 minutes, so it's no big deal. 

The only snafu here, and the reason I am debating bringing this place down a star, is because my first pizza order was for 16 pizzas. The guy put them all on the counter and asked ""Do you want me to help to you your car with this?"" and I said that'd be great, man, thanks. He kinda rolled his eyes and sighed and then helped me. Dude, why'd you even offer?! You could've just said ""You're all set, thanks, adios"" and it would've been cool. But, no, you had to be a jerk. Good job. 

All that said, would I return here? Probably not. The pizza is only barely ok, and I'm not sure I'd want to save the $2 or whatever and go to Domino's and wait the extra ten minutes.

I get there and wait 10 mins while the lady in the long pony tail pretends to be busy and im the only 1 here then when i order my pizza thats spost to be hot and ready she says it will be 15 mins. So i left hungry and had to go back to work hungry.,l2J5G5Q41hm2aUcCBXd-OA,0,0,1,eTm0bKMqobPNlqnsaswmCQ

I watched a father request for only half his pizza be covered with pepperoni and the man behind the counter gave him a hard time and wanted to upcharged him. Why upcharge for using less ingredients? Why is it some restaurants comply and listen to their customers and others simply do not? The father said he would pay for pepperoni and worker was rude about it. Very bad customer service, no wonder your rating is so low. Never again. Im tired of giving Little Caesars a chance, there are other options. I do not like seeing people mistreated for simple requests.",6DXUETDxtqmugLOAtBmDlw,1,0,1,Raw4HA9MqKfXmBZl_ftU1Q

This Little Caesars pretty consistently makes the best $5 cheese pizzas and Crazy bread. The sauce to cheese ratio is perfect and it's never over cooked. I'm very particular on how 
the appearance and taste of the Crazy Bread too. I like it soft and spongy, hot, buttery, and seasoned evenly. They nail it every single time! Lastly, the employees are very courteous and respectful.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,4,4,4,2lffT--gC_I6MctRY5wxhQ

I noticed and walked back in and told the guy on register if I could have breadsticks with nothing on them. He rolled his eyes at me and said ""ugh now I have to throw these away"" and snatched the everything breadsticks out of my hands like it was a huge inconvenience. He got me new breadsticks and threw them on the counter. Safe to say, I won't be going back. 3 dollar breadsticks were not worth the attitude I received.",3wJR63n6zMXRmAfaytguNQ,0,0,1,dgATeFi2Q7r3delA7PiVqA
