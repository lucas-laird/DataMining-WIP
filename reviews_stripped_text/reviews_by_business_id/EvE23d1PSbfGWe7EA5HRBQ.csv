169743,2017-12-08,0,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"Let me start by saying that the food is GREAT! Which is what those stars are for. The service however, was absolutely not. My brother and I were greeted and seated upon arrival and the experience just depleted from there. The older lady that was our waitress seemed to be servicing the entire restaurant which I know can be stressful, so I didn't expect much. But she literally paid no attention to us AT ALL.. she walked by our table on several occasions with not even a ""how is your food?"" or ""do you need anything"". We asked for napkins and she threw them on the table. Our water glasses sat empty and unattended, while we watched her walk by our table and happily refill the glasses of the other guests. Luckily, one of the other younger girls working noticed we were being ignored and attended to us. I honestly feel that we were discriminated against racially, since we were 2 of the very few ""non Asian"" people dining. 
Nonetheless, our experience was very disappointing and we will be getting take-out moving forward.",GLSGE08JPXt4RQWmdvLSww,1,0,3,rbc_gYTATsRxIICGJjoS8Q

925488,2018-02-18,0,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"We arrived and everything was very clean and new. We ordered red braised beef noodle soup, house chow mein, and their gyoza/potstickers. I originally wanted the vegetable chow mein and asked our waiter if that was good and his response was, ""if that's what you like."" And then I said well you work here.. have you tried the noodles?? Did you like them? What would you recommend? So that's how we ended up choosing the house chow mein. 

The beef noodle soup came out and we were eating. It was very salty and not as rich as beef noodle soup is supposed to be. 

The chow mein came out and it was good. It was tasty.. But salty also. The house chow mein comes with shrimp, pork, chicken, and beef. The whole works. I wonder if the vegetable one would have came out the exact same except with vegetables and if the waiter only suggested the house one over the vegetable one bc he liked how it came with a lot of meat.. as most guys would enjoy that kind of dish. I on the other hand do love my veggies. 

The gyoza/potstickers came out and I really liked them! I liked them so much I ordered another. But at the same time I also wondered if I liked them so much bc I was hungry hahahahah and didn't really eat much of the 2 salty noodle dishes. 

The bill came and I was disappointed and surprised at how much the gyoza/potstickers were!... $7.50 for 6 pieces.. the 6 pieces were in actuality only 3 since they cut it in half.  Imagine an egg roll.. cut diagonally. The chow mein was $8.99. 

Safe to say at least I tried it.",kli4pFv0HPieztzbW2v3Ew,0,0,3,mc-6oUYEvmhHP7NlrF3pjQ

1380589,2018-05-26,0,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"Came here for the first time on a recent Friday, to pick up some lunch for myself and my friend while she was at work. 

Magic Noodle is located in the same plaza as Infused Tea Lounge, Makai, etc, just south of Tropicana on Fort Apache. I had arrived less than 30 minutes after they opened but almost the entire restaurant was full already. Every table was occupied, if not mildly over occupied. The layout of the restaurant is fairly similar to that of Shang's Artisan or Noodle man, with an open kitchen blocked off by a large glass wall showing the noodle being pulled. 

I had ordered a dan dan noodle for myself, shredded chicken noodle w/ garlic sauce for her, and a beef brisket noodle for another friend at the office. It took maybe 15-20 minutes to get my order but it was still fairly quick, considering how busy the restaurant was. 

The food smelled really good in the car as I was being mildly tortured while driving over to the office my friend is at. 

They separate all the sauces and soups since it was ordered as take out. For some reason, the dan dan noodle sauce got all over the place, leaving like less than an inch of sauce left in that huge take out bowl. Fortunately, that was still enough to cover all the noodles, if anything, it was still a bit salty. Sauce had a good amount of numbing spice/oil to it which was pretty decent

The noodles, even after sitting in a take out box for give or take 30 minutes, were still quite al dente and had a good amount of bite to it, which was great. I noticed their strands of noodles are not too uniform throughout. Thickness varied quite a lot in the same order. 

Great to have a hand pulled noodle place so close to home. Beats driving to Noodle Man or Shang's Artisan when feeling a bit lazy. Parking is much easier here than Shang's !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,4,5caUlXuugMEXqL-gtqmSDg

I always have to order spicy wontons if I see them on a menu, and the version here were generously portioned and very thinly-skinned, with a great house-made chili oil sauce. The Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup is a huge portion of ""spicy"" (not really) broth with chunks of beef brisket, broccoli, and plenty of noodles- specify knife-shaved for the chewy, curly style I like best.

The chili wontons ARE a definite must. The wontons have the perfect texture, not soggy at all and you can taste the meatiness of the filling without the heat overpowering the dish. Would order two of these next time. Don't let the chili in the name stop you from getting them!

Also ordered the szechuan beef brisket noodle soup and the reviews weren't kidding, the beef is super tender!! Plus there were plenty of it. We had it with the original noodles and I'm not too particular about noodles but the bf said the soup doesn't really hold onto the noodles well but it's a soupy soup you know. Cooked al dente. Broth was also light and not too oily which was surprising. No msg here!

And last, we had the combination chow mein. Again the sauce doesn't stick well on the noodles but the flavor was all there. Simple but satisfying, would like it to be a tad bit more saucy but that's my preference. Lots of veggies and meat (shrimp, beef, chicken, spam?). Good enough for two people too.

My sister recommended this place and I really liked it. First off kudos to the server working there, he was very honest about the menu and made honest recommendations and did not just say yes to what I asked for when he knows it would not be a good choice, I appreciate the honesty! I ordered the first noodle and asked for knife cut noodle and the server said that is not a good choice because the broth works better with the regular noodle so of course I went with his recommendation!

We both got the first noodle on the menu (forgot what it's called), and it was so good. Noodle was fresh and chewy, broth was simple but so flavorful with a little chili providing a nice kick. The only thing that threw me off was the meat, it had that ""fridge"" smell that was a little strong. It was not inedible or anything but ruined the noodle a bit. 

I cannot wait to come back and try more.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,1,4,wAjO56fP8HlqrMx7ZALTfQ

2006062,2017-12-23,1,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"First time here and I will be back for sure! My dad and I decided to come here for lunch after I had my tires changed at Walmart (across the street). It was a cold and windy day so this place definitely hit the spot.

House special pancakes (pork): this was sooo good. The dough was thin and had a nice crunch to it. The pork inside was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Highly recommend. 

Lan Zhou noodle: my dad got this dish. He's a picky eater and even he admitted that the broth and noodles were tasty. He didn't get it spicy but you do have the option to make it spicy. 

Fish noodle with pickled vegetables: if you love pickled veggies, then you'll love this dish. The broth was delicious and had a nice tang to it that wasn't overwhelming from the pickled veggies. 

If there was one thing I could recommend, it would be to add more meat into these dishes. I think mine only came with 5 pieces of fish and my dad's came with 3 or 4 slices of beef. I do want to try the other stuff on their menu so I will be back :)",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,3,2,4,kBMLM31-p2E1xljC1gOf8g

I tried both the Mongolian beef chow mein and the beef brisket noodles (not pictured). I'd definitely recommend the Mongolian beef chow mein but for the beef brisket noodles I would be wary if you prefer a moderately savory/salty broth as this one was pretty salty. Both dishes were served with flat wide noodles which had an extremely nice texture and chew. I wouldn't exactly deem this restaurant as a 5/5 as I felt it lacked any redeeming, special qualities setting it apart from any other noodle restaurant.

We were seated probably in about a 20 minute time frame and we had a party of 3 so it was pretty reasonable and it was about 8:30 at night.
We had a front row seat to the noodle making as well and our 7 year old loved that. The waiter was on top of everything and thanks to yelp we saved a lot of time and already knew what we wanted. 

I got the brisket noodle bowl soup , daughter got chicken fried rice and husband got he Mongolian beef chow mein

I was kind of disappointed in the brisket because it was sooooo fatty, like extremely fatty very large chunks. All white pieces . And that's my only complaint. So for that bowl being all the rave that was the only let down. Noodles and broth were amazing. Chicken fried rice was absolutely amazing. The Mongolian beef chow mein was great and perfect amount of spice .  The service was very fast and the mason jar waters are a great touch.

I like to know what I'm ordering.  Usually I do, but I still have not a clue was Dan Dan noodles are.  And tap water had a normal great taste to it.

Ended up with the Mongolian beef item.  It was really super tasty.  Noodles were obviously fresh and flavors were great.  Veggies cooked nicely.  Came with peppers, onion and carrot I believe.  Portion is solid.  Cost $8.95.   Not too shabby.  Wife got Szechwan Beef Brisket.  I didn't like it but she did.

I had noodles on my mind and thought of the perfect spot that been on my radar. So first impression was really like the interior with the original artwork one of the walls, the open kitchen look always favorite, and ample seating from counter area to tables. Truthfully it set up like lot of Ramen or Noodle shops around the valley or the ones I have been to. The menu is nothing crazy only two pages but has most of your favorites soup base noodles, sauce noodles, stir-fried and fried rice plus appetizers. The key or trending is the noodles  fresh made or really not keeping up with the times. Lol. It was lot of decisions only because it was my first time. I ended up settling for the Mongolian Beef Chow Mein and since first time had get appetizer went with the Onion Pancake. 

The Onion Pancake asked my server if should go with the add egg. He told me is very popular but wanted try the pancake without no distractions. It was pretty awesome. The texture is little bit like pancake. It not as fluffy or looks like pancake. I more like pita bread kind of. It filling like bread, see the onions, not over powering but definitely can taste the green onion, and nice starter or like getting basket of bread. Maybe if add the egg game changer?? I enjoyed it and would recommend it as starter.

The Mongolian Beef Chow Mein was awesome. The portion size is generous and not doubt get your money worth in food. I love! Hearty this dish was with ample amounts of noodles. The vegetables and the beef felt like every bite got the best of all worlds. It had nice depth of flavor in the sauce. Solid noodle dish. 

The service was five stars!!!!! The gentlemen was awesome since it was my first time. Never had empty glass of water. Checked several times make sure everything was good. Friendly. 

The Magic Noodle player in the noodle game for me. I love the fact close to home for me. No doubt plan on coming back cause barely tapped the menu. Till my next noodle recovery meal. lol!",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,10,9,4,x-L5dLoOvdovhgxUBmtoAQ

The spicy wonton was very very good. We love the sauce, it wasn't plain of chili oil, this sauce had a very good flavor. The wonton itself were delicious. 

My noodles was so dang delicious. The broth looked red but It wasn't that spicy at all. I chose the thick cut flat noodles. The noodles were so perfect, cooked perfect, wasn't too soft that can make it mushy. The broth was rich flavorful, it contained with peanuts, ground pork, shredded Chinese cabbage and bok Choy. 

My husband's soup was also delicious. He chose the usual cut type of noodles. The noodles came with slices of beef and the broth was the best broth! It was so rich of beef broth flavor. 
Because this noodle soup was so good, my husband ate it all! No leftover! 

The restaurant isn't that big, so I am pretty sure at lunch time, it will be packed. The price is not bad at all, and so worth it. And the service is fast and efficient.

2716929,2018-03-22,2,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"A friend recently introduced me to Magic Noodle and after that first visit I was compelled to tell other friends about it and to start making return trips for lunch.  My recommendations after several visits include:

Appetizers:  I highly recommend the House Special Pancakes or the Spicy Wonton.  Or just get both.  You'll thank me later.

Soups:  I can definitely recommend the two I've tried so far:  Lan Zhou Noodle, and Chong Qing Style Spicy Noodle.  I need to be disciplined and try others as well, but both of these are so good, it's hard to force myself to give something else a try.  Even so, absolutely everything I've seen brought out looks tempting.  Now read on; you'll have some choices to make when you order:

Types of noodles.  All the noodles are hand made right there in the restaurant.  In fact, the magic happens right behind a glass wall separating diners from the kitchen, and it's pretty cool to watch as the noodles are being stretched/pulled by hand.  If you have kids, bring them--they'll be as fascinated as you are to watch.  When you order, you'll have the choice between original noodles, flat noodles, or knife cut.  They're all good, but give the knife cut noodles a try.  Rather than being uniform in shape, they're literally cut by hand and you'll end up with a variety of sizes and shapes in your broth.  The waiters will always be happy to recommend a noodle type deepening on the broth you're going to enjoy.  

Types of broth.  Speaking of broth, ask the waiter to explain the varieties.  There are six or seven different broths available based on the various soups you chose.  You may want to focus on the broth when you order rather than just what's floating in it.

The staff is awesome!  They'll obviously talk to you about the menu, but one of the best things about everyone I've spoken with there is they seem genuinely excited about the restaurant.

Parking:  The Magic Noodle is in a storefront, and there's always sufficient parking available.

So many delicious choices and at a very reasonable price!  If you enjoy noodles and haven't tried Magic Noodles, treat yourself and add a Chinese noodle house to your noodle house options!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,6,2,5,ZVUG0tMw6kSqbx-NxyfiVw

We chose two types of noodles and I'm a bigger fan of the knife cut noodles (thick and chewy!) than the flat wide hand pulled noodles (got soggy after a few min in the broth). 

Also recommend trying the sliced pork with garlic sauce- tender pork and lots of minced garlic. Just wish it was spicier! The house special pancakes were just oversized gyoza. Nothing too special. The beef filling was flavorful and juicy though.

Food came out really slow, so it was nice to be able to watch the noodle making from the dining area. Service was ok. Good location in the SW, fair prices, good portions- 4 stars",4ywoghefRTsbi1SzkR-fcA,0,0,4,Cx5HBiKhOUseyQdjmuL_ww

When I see the words ""Spicy beef noodle soup"" c4 and  fresh hand pulled noodles"", I get more excited than I should, and fear I will never burn off the calories to justify my noodle habit. 

One caveat: I think the soup, at least the spicy one, goes better with the hand pulled noodles than the knife shaved. I enjoy a doughy noodle every now and then but it's almost like they soak up too much spice. 

If for some reason, you come to magic noodle, and don't want noodles. The house fried rice and appetizers are bomb too...detour

Literally (not literally but almost literally) everything tastes better with the chili oil from the spicy Wontons. I know it's just(?) chili oil but maybe it's the flavor the wontons leave behind that make it taste better than straight up chili oil. I like to use it for as many different non soup items as I can. End detour

Seeing the word burrito gave me pause but the burritos and pancakes (A3 was my choice) at this Chinese restaurant are quite good. The sweet and sour cucumber, B5 are a refreshing treat as well. I could easily imagine coming here splitting a bowl of noodles (I haven't tried it yet so I don't know if there's an associated fee) and splitting two or three appetizers the cucumbers might be necessary if only to make me feel less guilty about all the carbs (bonus that they taste good).",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,1,1,5,pUynIOA2o6Zom4v0e753kA

They only had two servers working, and one was helping out with a to go order, so the service was a little slow, but I can't blame them the server was working hard and fast running around every where.

The restaurant itself is not very big though, clean and nice decor. There is also a see through mirror to the kitchen and you can watch the chef pulling noodles right in front of you! So if they pick their nose or spit in your food you would see it right away, and of course that wasn't happening here :)

I love the noodle soup I got (lan zhou beef noodle soup), soup was perfectly seasoned. The noodles were chewy and had great taste!  I also got the spicy wonton as an appetizer, and that was wayyyyy too much food. I was very hungry too before dinner, I still could not finish all the noodles and soup.

My friend and I went here for dinner around 6:30 on a Friday. We got lucky and only had to wait for 5 minutes. There's no waiting area though as space is really tight and fully utilized, so we had to awkwardly stand by the entrance door while waiting. Located in the same plaza as thai noodle house and infused tea. Plenty of parking.

We tried their spicy wontons for appetizers and they're really good. The wonton skin was soft, while the filling was firm, giving you a nice texture. I could taste the shrimp and pork in the fillings too, so they didn't have much fillers. The chili sauce had a good flavor and went well with the wontons. It's quite pricey though. $6.50 for only 6 wontons. 

For noodle soup, I had their Szechuan beef brisket noodle ($8.95). I chose to have their regular hand-pulled noodle. The noodles were cooked perfectly al-dente. However, the broth was not spicy at all. I was expecting that numbing spiciness that comes from Szechuan dishes, but nope, tasted just a regular beef broth with some chili oil. The brisket was tender for the most part and they gave a lot of it too. I do like that their broth is not too salty. 

Service was ok. Had to ask for water refill a couple times. The place is clean, but you will still smell like beef soup after. Just like after you have pho lol. I would come back again and try their other soups.",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,1,0,3,-IYICTwByMzgM_FjOeoWow

We tried the beef brisket with knife cut noodle and the fish with pickled vegetable and knife cut noodles.

Beef brisket: broth is ginger flavor forward, slightly floral and sweet. Overall good, but could have more depth of that beefy flavor. The knife cut noodles were fabulous, perfectly not-too-thin-not-too-thick. Meat was tasty, as well. Very filling on this cold night.

Fish & Pickled Veg Noodle: This one packs a good spicy kick. Loved, loved the spice level! Especially with the pickled vegetables cutting through the spiced broth. It's only missing some fresh thinly sliced cabbage or other fresh vegetable to add some texture. I noticed with the noodles, some were very thick and others more similar to the size of the noodles in the beef brisket bowl so their cook was inconsistent. Fish was tasty with all the broth flavor, but a little muddy on the finish.

The shop is small and steadily busy, yet tables were rotating at a good pace with no one left waiting too long to find their spot. Service was also good. For beverages, the hot spicy soup would be great washed down with a nice beer, so hopefully they'll add beer and wine to the menu eventually (soft drinks/teas/juices currently.)

Service: When you first enter, there is a sign-in sheet where you can indicate how many are in your party. However, both times a waiter had quickly greeted my friends and I to inquire himself how many people were in our party, and the wait times were not very long.

Food: I have tried the chicken with mushroom soup, as well as the beef brisket soup, spicy wontons, and house pancake appetizer. First, the house pancake, and spicy wonton appetizers. My boyfriend and I ordered the house pancakes with pork inside, and they were amazing. The filling was similar to that of pork dumplings/gyoza, but what really sold them for me was the outer bread encasing. It was light, crispy, and tasted like pastry dough. A must try! And although I do not mix well with spicy foods, the wontons were not overly spicy, just more on the chili-oil side. They were soft to eat, and the wonton wrapper actually reminded me of the noodles used for Pad Kee Mao. 

For both soups, I ordered the original noodles. You can also order knife cut or flat-wide noodles. The original noodles had a good texture to them-- not too thin or too thick, and had a good amount of chewiness. There were a variety of mushrooms in the chicken with mushroom soup, which I really enjoyed. The chicken was not over-seasoned, but still very moist. For the beef brisket soup, the meat was very soft, but made the meal misleading as the brisket came in big chunks, so it seemed like there wasn't enough protein at first glance.

I like the service here. They acknowledge you once you walk in. I usually go off hours so I never catch the rush hours, which works to my benefit. The servers are always coming around to check for empty dishes and to refill our drinks.

I found their broth to be superior to other handmade noodle shops. The chicken and mushrooms was outstanding. We also got the brisket. The brisket was far too fatty for my liking but the few meaty pieces were tender and delicious. The broth on this was pho-esque. The dan dan noodles were very spicy. Too spicy to be able to eat an entire bowl. A few bites would suffice.

I got the beef brisket noodle soup with shaved noodles. I couldn't be happier with my decision. The shaved noodles are perfect to my preference. Great chewiness, not too long, not too short. The broth was delicious but I've had better. The beef was so tender and just melted in my mouth. Hands down, there isn't a beef brisket noodle soup in Vegas that can compare.

My wife got the black fungus and the chicken and mushroom soup with the wide noodles. The broth was pretty good, there were a ton of mushrooms and the chicken wasn't dry as I was half expecting, especially for white meat. The wide noodles had great texture but they were extremely long and it just felt like the noodle was too overwhelming for the dish and took away from the flavor. I would personally prefer a thinner noodle that would be able to absorb more flavor and broth. The black fungus was awesome. The last time I had it was probably in my childhood when my parents ordered it somewhere. Definitely something I wouldn't have ordered on my own. It had great crunch and texture with a nice sweet and sour flavor. My wife loved it, we would probably order it again. 

I looked over and saw that someone had ordered the pork belly and string beans noodle stir fry. It looked so on point! My wife hates fatty meat and even she was eyeing that dish.

We sampled a lot of appetizers and ordered individual dishes as well.  Appetizers came out quickly and our main dishes came our shortly after.  Great work by the staff and kitchen.

Magic Noodle Cuisine:  My main dish was the C4/Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle and it was very tasty.  The broth was spicy enough to make me sweat but didn't burn the mouth, love it.  The fresh noodles made in house is evident.  The Spicy Won Tons were so spicy and delish, we had to get another set in and I'm definitely ordering on the next visit.  The Onion Pancakes with the braised pork belly is another one I'm ordering again, full of flavor.  I sampled the House, Chicken and Mongolian Beef Chow Mein, all were good-tasting.

Magic Noodle Ambiance: The kitchen ahs glass windows which showcases the chefs tossing the lovely in house noodles.  The kitchen is surrounded by bar seating and the dining area is aligned with wooden tables and seats.  The wall is adorned with Chinese drawings and Hanzi in black and white to make for a very clean look.

Every noodle I sampled with our big party of 12 had the same characteristic, you can taste the freshness and it will bring you back.  The $ pricing for $$$ quality food will also bring you back.

Picked up my order, the restaurant was close to full... with happy faces. Bounced back home with my food opened up the wontons. WOWWWWWWWW. I don't eat this type of food very often.... I love these. Good thing my lady doesn't eat red meat or pork...is pork red meat?
The spicy beef wontons blew me away. I ate them all in less than 3 minutes. Added the spicy oil stuff after the first one I ate. Straight firrrrre

Now, I move onto the kung pow... don't know how to compare it... cause I don't usually eat this. But it's GREAT.

For appetizers, get the sweet and sour cucumber, spicy wonton, and the Chinese beef burrito. Pro tip: Dip the Chinese beef burrito into the spicy wonton sauce. You're welcome. 

All the noodles I've tried have been really good including the spicy beef noodle soup, Dan Dan noodles, and Mongolian chow mein.

But we've 86'd all the usual takeout places we used to patronize closer to home, after appearances on KTNV's Dirty Dining in one case, and a change of chef in another, made them no-go. So I went to Yelp and found The Magic Noodle. Despite the name, it didn't occur to me that this wasn't going to be the typical Chinese food place of our past, but oh, well, we go with the flow. 

We brought along a bottle of wine, just in case they didn't serve it. Not only do they not, it was tolerated because it was Christmas Eve, but strongly discouraged other times. Good thing we thought to bring a corkscrew. And since I drink exactly two things - coffee and wine - the coffee mugs we were provided (to sort-of hide the contents) were perfectly okay with me.

Service was very friendly, and our waitress was patient with our questions. That was good, since there are virtually no explanations for menu items with Chinese names.

We started with a Szechuan dumpling appetizer, which was very tasty. I ordered Lan Zhou noodle soup, and my husband got the Szechuan beef brisket. But as soon as they were delivered, we switched dishes. He expected the brisket to be sliced, but these were chunks, and covered in fat. The Lan Zhou was sliced.

I thought I could handle the chunks of brisket, but it turned out to be so fatty that there was almost no meat to eat. I filled up a small plate completely with nothing but fat, and in the end there was virtually only soup and noodles. (The noodles were excellent and broth was good). The waitress brought me a small plate of the sliced Lan Zhou beef. I have no idea what kind of cut this is, but it was ice-cold, looked greenish in the center, and tasted weird to me. 

The restaurant is clean and modern, the noodle-making show in the open kitchen is fascinating, the prices are reasonable, but to us it just wasn't worth the trip.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,9,5,3,nWFnBbkvl9xJoyKGg5-Y4Q

- Wontons in chili oil (not too spicy and the wontons skins were fresh and soft.  The meatball inside was flavorful and juicy)
- House Special Pancakes (slightly crispy and the meat inside was juicy, but it made the pancake outside a little soggy. The vinegar that came with it was such a great dipping sauce.  I also used the chili oil from the wontons for this too)

Entree:
- Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle with the wide noodles (I personally like my pasta a little al dente and that's the texture of the wide noodles.  It's a little thicker, with slightly more chew.  The beef was tender and flavorful.  The soup base was sooo flavorful and not spicy.  Don't be deterred by the all the chili oil-- it's not bad at all)

2. The food was delicious and very fresh. 
3. Our waitress did not have the best English but thankfully, we speak Chinese and the owner or manager was also very helpful. 

Our beef noodle soups came out fairly quickly and we also enjoyed some cold side dishes and spicy wontons. In addition, the stir fried pork belly and string bean noodles took a little longer to come out. I would have also liked the string beans to be cooked a little more, they seemed to be steamed and then stir fried in. 

My family greatly enjoyed their noodle soups and the side dishes. I loved the spicy wontons and it's always great to see any place making fresh noodles in their restaurant. I give extra props since it is a difficult and tedious task to do. 

The pricing is extremely reasonable and their menu reminds me of the Noodle Man and Shang's. However, I really did enjoy this restaurant and will definitely be back, especially since it is so close to home. 

We went when it first opened and I'm positive it has gotten even better since we have been there. We look forwarded to going back in the future!",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,6,3,4,JCjQNUf1uewkhoqC8qhxyA

We ordered:

-Sliced Pork Garlic Sauce (If you love pork and garlic, this dish is a must!)
-Spicy Beef Shank with Beef Tenderloin (Meaty, it wasn't bad.  We were hoping it was similar to another dish at Chef Hung in Irvine.  We miss their Spicy Beef Tendon.  This dish has the same taste, but different texture since we had beef tendon there.  Fresh and cold.)
-C1  Lan Zhou Noodle (Clean broth, fresh noodles, I think I like the noodle texture at Noodle Man better.  But this is still very good.)
-C3  Beef Brisket Noodle  (Husband had this noodle soup and he really liked it.)

We enjoyed the service and food here.  Only about 2 miles away from home.  Happy there is another noodle spot similar to The Noodle Man, since it's a pain to drive to off the Rainbow.

4934018,2018-01-05,0,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"I was looking forward to trying this place out since it was a new Chinese noodle place near my house. We placed our orders which were two noodle soup dishes and specifically requested the knife cut noodles option. We were waiting for a while and were wondering why everyone seated around us (and seated later than us) were getting their orders first. 

Thirty minutes later, we were told by our server that they don't have fresh knife cut noodles and that their hand-pulled noodles were fresher. It would take an additional 5-10 minutes to make our order. Why didn't they tell us this information 30 minutes ago? 

After waiting patiently and being almost borderline hangry, we finally received our orders. We ordered the Fish Noodle with Pickled Vegetables and the Beef Brisket Noodle which were both delicious. The former has a savory, spicy broth that complimented the fish and the latter, a nice succulent dark broth that was brightened by cilantro, green onions, and other veggies. 

So long story made short, the food was definitely good and worth returning for but the staff need to communicate better with each other and their customers about their orders. The customer service was a 2, the food was a 5. Another recent review also mentioned waiting a long time for their order due to miscommunication in the kitchen.

The inside of the restaurant is fairly small and they can't really sit many people at the same time. That is why I think it is important to go early in order to be seated promptly. I went with a large group of people at 6:00pm and had no issues getting a table. By the time we left though there were at least 15 people waiting to be seated. 

The food here is REALLY good. I ordered the beef brisket soup with wide noodles. The noodles were awesome and the soup was very flavorful. I was impressed with the amount of meat they put on the soup as well. They do not shy away from that! 

I also ordered the pork garlic appetizer and I honestly think this was one of the best things! I had never had something like that before and it is on my list to order it again!

Luckily we missed the lunch rush, so we were greeted and sat quickly with very prompt water service.

We got the treat of seeing the noodle man handmaking the noodles, so definitely worth the wait since the times I've went to Noodle Man, there was no noodle maker!

With the help of our server, Benny, we picked out their house special Beef Brisket Noodle  (next visit will be with the knife cut noodle) and Mongolian Beef Chow Mein.

The broth of the beef brisket noodle had great depth and body to it. Noodles were al dente, with enough bite. And the seasoning all through out was amazing. For someone whose allergies are working on overtime and can still discern the taste of the dish, it makes me wonder how others can say their food is bland... 

The Mongolian Beef Chow Mein had great spice and heat. Definitely made my nose run, but not horribly. Fifteen minutes in I'm surprised my allergies weren't kicking in to overdrive. With all the soy sauce that they use, most Asian restaurants I go to my sinuses are already going full force, but not here.

 The highlight of the meal was when I kiddingly asked our waiter, ""As you can see, my friend is white, are you sure he can handle the spice levels?"" Without missing a beat, he said it's not the spicy but throughout the meal, he was very nice to ask to make sure it really wasn't spicy haha. Sorry Larry, love you friend!

Definitely coming back to try their other dishes. Move over Noodle Man.

It was also a rainy day, which is perfect for hot noodle soups. The food here is just ok. I had the ""beef burrito"" aka taiwanese beef roll, and the pork pancake to start. The pancakes are long and rectangular, not like the normal shape of this dish at most places. The beef roll was a small portion for $6.50 and was just mediocre at best, like the kitchen didn't really care when they made this. I ordered a C1 lan zhou soup and subbed knife sliced noodles for my entree. The soup broth had a pleasant taste. Although whoever cut my noodles needs to learn to be a little more uniform in their slicing. Some were really thin, and some were way too thick and not cooked in the middle. And the chili sauce which is on the table, they need to fix this. Has no flavor at all, it's not spicy, just tastes like straight oil and sesame. That was really disappointing.

The garlic chicken was very garlicky for the others not so much for me.  It did have a kick at the end.  
The onion cakes were crisp and thin.  It didn't get 5 stars for the price it was 5.99 and oil am use to paying less than 4.00 or even way less.

5492430,2018-01-16,1,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"We ordered food to go, so maybe that detracts from the food a bit.  The beef wraps were tasty but small and more expensive than other places.  The beef noodle soup wasn't too impressive.  The broth didn't stand out and the noodles were a little too soft for my liking.  The beef was tender but again could use more flavor.  I'll probably have to give them a try in person before I write them off, but so far I think Noodle Man and Shang Artisan are more impressive.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,2,1,2,PZqtszDPpbKUKC_G9faYGg

5539297,2018-05-22,0,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"This is a restaurant in a popular strip mall that has pretty much all types of options. My boyfriend ate here before and he recommended we go for dinner. It doesn't seat very many, maybe 25-30 people max? Clean and barely smelled of food until the people next to us got their order. I got the Vegetable Chou Mein and he got the Szechwan Beef Brisket. These are good portions, might even need a take home box. I would wish for hot tea as an option vs just cold drinks, as hot soup and cold drinks don't really go well for digestion. And perhaps a non-spicy egg/spring roll to enjoy since not everyone eats spicy? It seems they do a lot of to-go business too since there's not a lot of seating. We ate well for under $20 w just water to drink.",efDWQZJ5QX_uGhpVRLjo-Q,0,0,4,2cBqq2ELWdgqUQCwoJlnZA

5566600,2018-02-18,0,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"The food was 4 stars.  Why 3 rating?  

1) I ordered an appetizer and a main - the main came out 4 minutes after I ordered and the appetizer arrived when I was 1/2 way through my main. I had a feeling I should have ordered the app and just waited.  But I thought I would give the service a try on timing.  
2) If you are going to run an open kitchen and seat people along the counter area by the glass to watch -  be ready for all eyes on you.  You are the show.  You are the star.  
2a) If you're going have an open kitchen with glass - the glass should be clean.  It was not.  I'm not talking about a little flour from the hand made / tossed noodles being on the glass...I'm talking the glass was hazy and needed attention.
3) The containers on the tables that hold - Chili Oil, Soy Sauce, and Black Vinegar were dirty.  The spoons looked like they've not been changed in a long time and the dried crusty residue around the top of the lids was nasty.  May take a bit of effort but when a customer is finished dining the  spoons should be changed and the lids should be wiped down.  Perhaps keeping the condiments ""to serve"" would be a better remedy instead of leaving them out on every table.  
4) One employee came into the open kitchen. He wasn't wearing gloves.  He reached into his pocket, pulled out his wallet, went inside and brought out a sum of cash.  He began to count and fan it.   He put it back in the wallet and walked behind the rear curtain (you could still see his legs) 
4a) Another employee came from behind the curtain and when he did you could see the employee from (4) peeling fresh leafy vegetables with his bare hands.   He never washed his hands from handling dirty money. 
5) When I informed my server of the situation he said he wasn't a manager but would tell them.  He went in the back for a minute or two and came back out to me and said ""thank you'
6) The employee that needed to wash his hands was still standing doing his work.   I then said to the server - HE NEEDS TO WASH HIS HANDS NOW.  He went back and had the person washed his hands.  

They are still a new place.  The food was indeed delicious.  Am I a bit worried about eating my full meal and watching the sanitary habits of the employees?  Yeah....just a bit.  If you have an open restaurant like this you need to be on TOP of sanitation and all employees need to be handling food properly.  I will try it again.  I hope what I noticed the first time doesn't happen again or to anyone else.",tuzWTI-1psOsSsyFJLuthg,1,0,3,vHXJJZXMJMykVuYzkdbPQA
5620463,2018-01-19,9,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"Hot and new noods! 
If you're in a mood for good noods, try the Magic Noodle, where we got a free show with our delicious meal.  When we arrived last night, we were seated immediately although we probably came at just the right time because the place was full of patrons.  Mr. Wang was pulling noodles almost the whole time we were there (I only know his name because I asked our server who that hard-working bespectacled fellow was behind the glass).  That's the free show part.  The delicious part came when we had our noodles. I chose the knife cut noodles for the Beef Brisket soup.  These noodles were just the right consistency, not too firm and not too soft.  I loved the tender beef brisket served with the soup, as well, with its nice flavor and quite a generous amount of beef.  Service was great throughout our meal as we were checked on often and our water glasses were never empty.  I would definitely recommend this place for a magical meal.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,13,13,4,eEnluoV_Qo4IbhkUCF9OFQ

We walked in and were greeted by a smiling face.  He sat us immediately and got some drinks right out to our table.  I cannot even describe how delicious the place smelled.  I had no clue what dish was creating it, but I was hoping that whatever I chose would be it.  While we decided, my son was entrances watching one of the chefs making the noodles that they use in their dishes.  
The staff remained attentive through the whole meal even as the restaurant filled.  Every dish we ordered was absolutely scrumptious.  
I cannot use the word AMAZING enough for The Magic Noodle. The atmosphere is AMAZING.   The staff is AMAZING.  The food is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  And the price is definitely AMAZING for all that they offer.  
This is definitely a must visit again and again.

The decor is modern and through the large glass windows into the kitchen, you can watch them make the noodles. I came because I love Pho and Ramen so I wanted to give Chinese Noodle Soup a try. The presentation is made my mouth water as you can imagine by the picture. I had the spicy beef noodle soup (can't remember the actual name). It was really tasty and quite spicy but I didn't realize this dish is a ground beef dish which isn't my preference. I will come back and try another soup. It was really inexpensive as well.

5885456,2018-05-22,0,EvE23d1PSbfGWe7EA5HRBQ,"I really liked the Lan Zhou noodles! They were delicious. Also the cold cucumber appetizer was super garlicky, sour and delicious. Plus points for the Chinese TV in the background that was playing some delicious looking cooking show. My fiancee got the Chong Ching noodles, which were pleasantly mala.

This feels like a strange reason to knock the review down a peg, but I did notice that this restaurant has no ambient music. Maybe it was the day I was there, but there was no background music at all. This lead to easily hearing conversations in the kitchen, as well as from other customers. I prefer there at least to be some background music to set the tone. As it was...it just felt quiet. I would have appreciated some tone-setting tunes.

We're getting down to the nitty gritty again, but the owner/server seemed like in a big rush to do everything- set down utensils, clear tables, and take orders. Not that it's bad to do things quickly, but I picked up a rushed, almost frantic vibe. I guess it's good for speed of service though.

Price is great, service is quick. Highly recommend.",J34k0e2Lnc5-aTWJ2HT2rA,1,0,4,P_4v7U070LcTCRI-S-GJLg
