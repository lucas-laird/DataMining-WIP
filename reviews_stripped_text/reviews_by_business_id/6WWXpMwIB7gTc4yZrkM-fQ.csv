Ordered turkey dogs on sticks the first visit which were good and lemonade on the second visit which was not good.  It was bland, I'm assuming because it must have been watered down from the ice melting in the display.  I actually worked at a Hot Dog on a Stick location in Texas as my 1st job over 15 years ago.  I remember making the lemonade and it was soo good back then, not at all like it tasted at this location.  Lastly, there was one other customer in front of me in line and we both had to wait a little while before an employee even appeared at the register to help us.  I thought that was strange. Also, the menu board listed light lemonade, but the employee told me they didn't have it.  Again, thought that was strange.  Doubt we will be back on our next visit.",aYeffoVtucmVNOwHYV5I6Q,0,0,2,D5AchuKou7dtWjpIB3pYmA

1311582,2016-11-22,0,6WWXpMwIB7gTc4yZrkM-fQ,So disappointed in the level of service I received. Kylie the employee was rude while taking my order. As I was waiting for my order I noticed a shift change. The new girl coming in saw me waiting and informed me that she had to throw away the ones that Kylie started because she didn't know how to work the equipment and it would be another 5 minute wait. Wish there was a way to give less than one star,cZW6XLA5swUQBLhkX-k15Q,0,0,1,qTSjrwnetIaiJc0aGU4RLw
1350924,2016-10-23,0,6WWXpMwIB7gTc4yZrkM-fQ,Two stars because a half star is not an option. The batter on the hot dog was over cooked and not golden vron. And the potion of funnel cake sticks was a sad excuse of a serving. Overall disappointed.,xp8r-czTIOEFC6UqUp73TA,0,0,2,UfLr5C_KJqt7FPL1IZST7Q

However, for some reason the food was just not as good as I've come to expect. The corn dog tasted oily like they needed to change out the fryer oil. We spent $9 for two hot dogs on a stick and we could have eaten somewhere else :(. Sad sad sad.",KQ9TbTOBwC5PTX0HXq1Tng,0,0,2,_G6qLkd_VGCQK6Ec6ommcw
2350691,2013-08-22,0,6WWXpMwIB7gTc4yZrkM-fQ,"Located in the Excalibur food court and like all other Hot Dog on a Stick locations, it is a great place to get a snack or some lemonade. However, if you're looking to have a full meal it may get a little pricey. The employees are very nice, fast and efficient even when this place gets busy and a line forms. I would highly recommend their lemonade, get the lime/green one!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,0,4,wXSKqoc1MX03UPoLZ5QLug

Like the other food places there, they are currently offering special deals so be sure to take advantage of them while you still can! I recommend getting their lemonade if you feel like drinking something chilled and refreshing (and are tired of drinking water lol). Also a good place for a quick bite.

There is nothing fancy about hot dog on a stick, but in my opinion good food doesn't have to be fancy. This place is perfect for a quick inexpensive bite, and who doesn't love a corn dog? Staff were friendly and prices are very reasonable. I always stop and get a hot dog on a stick when I'm in Excalibur.",op2Not9DW8mjpoNbLgth2g,0,0,5,D4kgtr6zpmhjUxiGtCZRTQ
3538398,2016-04-29,1,6WWXpMwIB7gTc4yZrkM-fQ,I love hot dog on a stick. Been going when I was a kid growing up in Southern California. They use all beef or turkey hot dogs and they are so tasty and crispy. I like mine with mustards. The cherry lemonade is too die for.,3jZ7W7ZPXBCX7opq1IUdPw,1,2,5,iP5I0pHgJ0Lnmcn3n9evCA

It was always a favorite must have. I recently got to take my husband and he loved it. It's as good as I remember.

3677320,2014-02-25,3,6WWXpMwIB7gTc4yZrkM-fQ,"As we walked around the food court at Excalibur, I noticed someone carrying a tremendous, golden brown, crispy-fried corn dog. Hello, delicious food on a stick! I wasn't really in a ""hot dog mood"".  I never am, to be honest, but after giving up on the other lack of options, we went back to look at the menu. 

Holy veggie hot dog! What are you doing up there??!! I had no idea this place also fries up veggie dogs. On a stick. In golden brown, fried dough!  I was a little reluctant. Would it look the same? How would it taste? I didn't know, but I gave it a shot and hot diggity dog I'm glad I did.  Yum yum yum.  

While the veggie dog (mine)($3.69) and beef dog (husband's)($4.39) were cooked in the same fryer, I thought about the surprising fact that the veggie dog was less expensive! How is that possible?!  We ordered a fry to share ($2.79) and a Light Lemonade (with sugar substitute) ($3.69 for large)

Everything was really good. We were the last customer of the night or else I probably would've ordered another dog, even though I really wasn't that hungry after the first one.  I wish EVERY food establishment would have a veggie option. Most of the time it's going to be a very tasty, healthier, guilt-free treat.  I do eat meat, but if there's a veggie option, I always take it! Glad I did here, The food was great!",1dQiuUvvK8427TBmqj_4Vg,6,4,4,lxMUFjBc9f5SooGkAbys0w

While it looked like a novelty/carnival setup, the actual taste is actually pretty darn decent. It is quite expensive for what they are, but you'd come to appreciate them making it on the spot, rather than warm them up in a microwave.

I've had both before, and you can't go wrong. This location was no exception. The girl working behind the counter was very sweet and friendly. She took our name when we ordered, and it wasn't too long before she called it out telling us our food was ready.

5217225,2012-11-29,1,6WWXpMwIB7gTc4yZrkM-fQ,"This place recently open and it's just like any other HDOS place. Employees are friendly. Will start small talk while corn dog is being fried. They serve you with a smile. I like their lemonades, there are three different flavors to choose from. To me it seems that the corn dogs there are quite small compared to other HDOS places I've been to, and the price for it doesn't sit well with me.

Be wary of  people on disability scooters, they will run you over and not give a F***.
