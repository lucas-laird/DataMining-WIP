564173,2015-07-20,0,J2nCJBrGn4EQT1abnBHaUQ,2 girls work together and watch your video poker machine and your every move. All conversations seem to be monitored. Cameras are everywhere and there is absolutely no privacy. Food was terrible. Video poker machines are some of the worst I have ever played. DO NOT GO AND WASTE YOUR $$$$$!! THERE ARE MUCH BETTER PLACES IN LAS VEGAS.  THIS PLACE IS ONLY INTERESTED IN TAKING YOUR MONEY!! WILL NEVER VISIT ANY 5 STAR TAVERNS AGAIN!!,eLZGpvBJBTCN0lMyvBGDxw,2,0,1,JOTJikJdgFS34eAIgjq5WA

Ist of all I am not fond of the help on Thurs. - plus they have no clue how to run a restaurant.  Bartenders are waiters and they are not friendly at all.  The food is good if you don't mind waiting 1.2 hour to figure out who is suppose to wait on you.  This was suppose to be an asset to sun city....NOT!  It is also, THurs. night and NO FOOTBALL - right!!",DKUzQMvBN2eT1303Mlwrcg,2,1,2,uU7kqOfAxTXlsMsUxa-DUQ

1027147,2014-03-24,0,J2nCJBrGn4EQT1abnBHaUQ,Recently stopped in for a beer and to gamble with my girlfriend. From the moment we walk in the bartenders were friendly. As soon as we sat down the bartender(short guy with jet black hair) approached us and got us drinks.  We started gaming and he suggested we should sign up for a card.  So my girlfriend signed up. Overall this was a great experience and we will be back a lot more often.,ly8ljxaWuNWIkfQEDvMixQ,0,0,5,pT1Kq-LLecCcB5pWM4s_TA

They have a super happy hour with 2-$5 big draft beers and $5.00 appetizers.  We had chicken fingers which was more than I could eat that came with 4 big fingers and fries...  Hubby had hot wings, 12 nice sized wings in the basket with veggies.  It was great good for $10 and the staff is really nice!",hpnys6ZjW7d7SMYct6t10A,0,0,5,U82Y12RE6iSzKACow4nXxA

The daylight cocktail goddess Anita, will re-fill the beverage of your choice before you even know you are ready.  We have been in Vegas for 32 years, and you just can't find service like this anymore.  That is why you will only find us there on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.  Stephanie and Jim run a bar that is both classy and blue collar at the same time. The decor is dark wood and timeless elegance, but the vibe is everyday fun.  The Rancho/Craig location is our favorite neighborhood bar, but the Five Star at the location of the previous Cooler Lounge (for you native Vegans) is another favorite of ours. There you will find Omar...the finest cook of Cuban cuisine this side of...well...CUBA ! !

For a good time, visit Anita at Rancho and Craig.  All you bikers out there will find it next to your favorite leathers store, facing Craig.

Five Star is the best Vegas has to offer, and it is our daytime bet for good food and good gaming odds.

2856229,2018-03-01,0,J2nCJBrGn4EQT1abnBHaUQ,"This used to be a good place to get a drink and a bite to eat. I don't know if they changed management or what but they went downhill. The last time my friend and I came here we waited 20 minutes for a drink while the two bartenders just sat there and bullshitted. Then after asking for a menu we were told that the chef would be out to talk to us about the menu. Well 45 minutes later with no menu we left. Since this place is usually pretty good I didn't let that stop me from giving them one more chance. Went back again around noon and the bartender Jennifer was amazing! Very attentive! Once again we were told that the chef would come out and talk to us about the menu, which he did in a timely manner this go around. Basically in a nutshell they only serve ""sliders and fries"" or ""wings and fries"". What kind of menu is that? Sadly, another decent spot gone to crap.",njaFnH4k7IQd48ygnDOe9Q,0,0,2,f7L22OaSxJQafbS_RQdSeg

Top of the bun over nuked and rock hard, bottom of the bun completely soggy mess.  Good thing the bartenders are AMAZING!

When you enter its a nice candle aroma with a friendly smile from the awesome bartenders.  The food is always fabulous and the drinks are super cold. The locals that hang out there are also very friendly and it reminds me of the show cheers where everybody knows your name (or at least remembers your face and says hi and will hold a great conversation!) I have been going to this bar for a few years now and miss a couple of faces that got kicked out due to talking loudly when the owner came in one night! (I don't agree with that part!) I do like to bring my people here and show off my nice clean bar w/ the best bartenders ever!

Five Star Friday's with Katie and Amy were the hi-light of my week (and date night tradition with the hubs) until my work schedule ended it.  Welcome though to Five Star Saturday morning with Jordan, my new after work spot!  6 am the guys from work and I love to go hang with Jordan and enjoy his exceptional service!  Bored on Saturday night, then Katie and Rich will keep you company (and keep you laughing all night!) And let me just tell you about Sunday morning breakfast with Terri!  She is the sweetest!  Always has our redbulls ready as soon as she see's us and knows my breakfast order by heart!  Can't beat Five Star Tavern on Craig and Rancho!  I fell in love with the place the first time I walked in the door and it's the only place I feel comfortable going by myself!",VeAYUb4tWFgWi81NjKTWEA,0,0,5,RUpqosR_NOGk_WWQW5NVSg

Today I wanted more than just a drink, unfortunately I was sadly disappointed. After looking at the menu and attempting to order a couple items the cook very apologetically told me the only food he had to make was burgers or chicken fingers. Don't have a full menu if you are not going have the food to cook! If I want a burger I can always go to Five Guys or In and Out!",pL6AYnGhT_anmq5nckJVrg,0,0,2,fm8XSCVivn14Pzj7636xbQ
