1311472,2012-10-24,0,4QmwJBk9VPKyO2DfUeIVWg,"Yikes. Went here about a year ago and had a great time and good food. Boy have things really gone downhill for this place. Went last night to use our nearly expiring groupon deal. The place was pretty dead. We looked around for a spot to sit, and decided to grab a booth. Upon sitting realized the seats were filthy and dirty, as well as the table. We were approached by a waitress (the only one) and she also looked to be tending the bar. She was very short with us and UN-friendly. Never smiled or acted polite, was just cold. We ordered our drinks and my wine glass was dirty with lip marks on it. We ordered the queso dip to start, and the chips were all broken and small, pretty much crumbles (maybe it was from the bottom of the bag). Our entrees were very mediocre at best. My boyfriend said the steak in his burrito was nasty and chewy. 

I know this place has been around a while, but it needs some major sprucing up and maybe some new management and new employees ( maybe ones that look like they want to serve you, not act like you are a nuisance). They also need to deep clean the place. Its too bad because as recent as a year ago we liked our visit, but things are going south here. They need to make changes asap, or I see it closing down soon.",P5neFGzLzxsvFLFEhxKx3w,2,0,2,iXhCL431TzcgaJEDayse-A

The bartender (a man who works Thursday nights) told us we couldn't sit at the bar to order food. It takes our server a good 15 minutes to come over because she's chatting  with People. She comes over and come to find out she's insanely wasted! Dropping F bombs, drooling on my sisters leg, and being a little too touchy for our liking. It takes like 35 min to get our food. My food was made incorrectly. She profusely apologizes , but I've been sitting here for the last 53 minutes waiting for my replacement. It's not packed at all, I'd understand if it was body to body, but it's not. I had to order in Spanish to the cook myself since our drunk server couldn't. She offered free drinks and said the  owner didn't give a shit about the food or the drinks all we care about are the poker machines.

It's conveniently located off the strip but close enough so that you can get a bite or drinks if you're near the strip but don't want to be ON the strip. 
Service is so-so. The one male bartender I always seem to have has usually been more  helpful than a particular waitress (that's also always there) that never seems to be too happy to be there. 
Drinks are pretty good, so that's a plus.
Food is good if you're in the mood for bar food that's a bit on the oily and greasy side. Like not always, but sometimes that really hits the spot! 
Personally, I like the chips w guac the best. Their guac is delicious and tastes as it should (like ripe, fresh avocados).  
One not so great thing is that even for a bar, this place is REALLY smokey.

I ordered the chicken sandwich and my friend had a burger. It took a while for the food to come out, but once it did, I was happy. The chicken was moist, the bacon crisp and the veggies on it fresh. Ended up taking half to go, and it held up nicely as a midnight snack.

3748559,2015-03-01,0,4QmwJBk9VPKyO2DfUeIVWg,"Tommy rockers is always the place to be after you're done working and can't find one of those places that is open during the day. Not only is it a bar, but it is also a restaurant. Years and years ago used to be a bar, restaurant, and strip club. Just about everybody who knows what it was like when there was a strip club is happy that that portion of the business is now gone.

The bartenders are super nice, though they are sometimes busy and hard to get the attention of. There's always cool events going on at Tommy rockers and some nights it's so busy that it's hard to find a spot, but that's what makes me want to go here-people are actually having fun and hanging out.

There is smoking allowed inside at the bar, and for us non-smokers it can be a bit annoying when you get your food and somebody sits next to you and lights up.

As far as the food goes, their menu is full of choices. It's possible to get healthy food such as the Mr. Feelgood (chicken sandwich). You can also pick out on the typical bar food as well.

Prices are very reasonable, with most things coming in between $7 and $12.",gakhurT9xcjCdPCBY541Gg,1,1,4,7QnAMMbJ7Akry4ItZ3ak6w

Now, it's no longer a topless strip club, but it's lost the momentum it once had.  Which is too bad because it was a really fun place to go to meet up with friends, have a few drinks, shoot some pool, have some food, and sing along with the band.  Well, not really sing along, but the bands were so much fun (think Jimmy Buffet style) that you couldn't help but sing along with your drunk friends.

I recently stopped by the joint to see what it was like now.  I walked into the place and it just didn't feel the same.  It's the same building and not much as changed inside the bar, but it was missing the people that made it fun.  It was replaced with other people, but it just didn't seem right.  I had a Beer and left.

Despite losing it's luster and momentum, this place is one of the best places to be during a weekend that Jimmy Buffet is performing in Vegas.  Although Jimmy has opened up a joint at the Flamingo, many Parrot Heads still come here.  Before Margaritaville opened up, this was Parrot Head heaven during those weekends.

Will I return?  Only during a Jimmy Buffet concert weekend.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,17,8,3,V_PGxaLvmlf53fHvysIwww

We came in for lunch at about 1pm not specifically looking for the topless aspect, but really for the food.  It was close, and affordable.

So reviewing the food, it is great!  We had the spinach artichoke dip which was served with this warm bread that melts in your mouth!  It was great.  The chips served with it as well were light, cripsy and full of flavor.  It' went well with the dip.

I also ordred the fish n chips.  4 very large portions of fish and some fries (chips) on the side - with some coleslaw.  Everything was great.  The fish was warm and flaky, and did not tasty fishy at all - the batter they use holds a lot of flavor as well.

  Good atmosphere -- nothing stuffy or pretentious, and I was pleasantly surprised that not only were the staff friendly, but the clientele was too.     There was an band there called Face First, playing lots of great, popular songs from the 1980s.  They were walking around talking to people in-between sets & it turns out they were friends attending UNLV in the 1980s that formed a band, did some touring throughout the 1980s, then went on with their lives, & were back doing a reunion that night.  Sounds like a possible horror-story, but they were very good at covering popular 80s songs but with their own 'sound,' instead of just trying to completely emulate other bands.

The proprietor, Tommy Rocker, was making the rounds & he's quite a character.  It's amazing what lyrics to obscure songs he knows (ask him about Johnny Cash's Live at Folsom).   It's always cool to hang out a little with the owner of the place & thanks to good staff, he can afford to focus on ensuring the customers are having a good time instead of having to supervise the staff. Unfortunately, we didn't get the opportunity to hear him sing (his era is 1970s) but that's a good reason for me to get back there.

  Ventilation could have been a little better, especially around 10-11PM when the place was pretty busy (but not so full of people that you couldn't walk around), but I mostly say that because of one jackass sitting at the bar smoking a cigar.  I'm a non-smoker that definitely hates smoke, but other than the guy sucking his phallic cigar, the air wasn't too bad.  You're in a bar in LV so you gotta just deal with it.  I did take a shower to get the stench off me when I got home.

I just had a couple Pepsi's, and Mozzarella Sticks plus Spinach Dip appetizers.  The food items tasted great, and the sauces they came with were fresh.   Our total bill was only $19 something, and they had no problem running a tab.

   If you're looking for a relaxed, fun hangout close to the LV Strip with good food & music, some pool tables (at least 2, maybe 3?) and NOT the hipster nightclub crowd, Tommy Rocker's is a great choice.

  I live in Henderson, where they have their second location, and I'm very curious as to what that one is like so I will probably stop by it soon just to check it out.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,1,0,4,sOIL2rlIUFHyts1lK2g0pQ
