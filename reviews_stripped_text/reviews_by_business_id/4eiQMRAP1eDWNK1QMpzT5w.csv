Unfortunately upon calling in an 3 item order for delivery they didn't have the pizza listed (no big deal) so we opted for a different item.  After 30 mins they called back and said they didn't have the Mediterranean burger we originally ordered as well, so we asked to please omit the burger and continue the order.  One hour later still no delivery so I called in to check on the food and they said that the driver had left over 20 mins ago and should be there soon. (we live 5 mins away). We waited an additional 30 mins (a total of 2 hours) called in again and was told the food had in fact been delivered, which we definitely did not receive.  With attitude the woman i spoke to did not believe we didn't get the food and could care less about the whole situation.  So I asked for a cancellation, luckily I was going to pay with cash.  I don't think she would have refunded a credit card had that been the case.  Stay away from this place.",jyEJxWv4lmGuw6hcxzhJ3w,2,1,1,lwJ6ihBxwTuRdJWtvzKkqQ

2264725,2018-02-17,1,4eiQMRAP1eDWNK1QMpzT5w,"My first experience here was great, the food was fresh and the service was excellent. I decided to bring some friends a few days later and the food was not the same. They took out the chicken and beef shawarma from the fridge and cook it on a small grill. While the other day it was slowly roasting on a vertical broiler.  The chicken was stale and the beef was bland. There are no seasoning on the rice, which lack flavor. I did enjoy their cucumber salad and hummus. Other than that, I will not be going back.

Update: as the comment stated below the recipes never change, and I highly doubt it will change for whatever reason. I doubt I am that special, that a restaurant will change their recipe for me. But I had the chicken shawarma that I enjoy before and the beef was the first time I had that day to be more clear. The chicken was cooked on the grille because it could be cook quicker as you stated. Why was I not inform of this information? Would it not alter the taste of my food? If it was not the same standard as my usual great taste as you stated, why did you guys bother to serve it? Was it a convenient to serve a customer a food that is not on par with the usual. I don't understand why you guys couldn't just stated the chicken is not ready and will take time to cook, would you like something else. Instead of just serving it and not saying anything. 

I will change my original stars from 3 to 2 stars.",wLhtn4lDHLtkPTF7GLN7dg,2,1,2,fz5tBXWfmo16vwKdPOyh-A

My co-workers keep telling me about ""Chickpeas"" how good it was... So I had to try it :)
new location in SW close to 215W and Sunset

Ordered lunch for my team. Restaurant decor is nice and modern.
A young man helped me ride away. Many options from bowls to salads to kabob.
Looking at the precut veggies and all, I wasn't sure...
I like the fact that they offer Small Medium or large portion. Their homemade salad dressing with olive oil and balsamic is yummy.
I ordered 
1 Beef plate that came with white rice, ""yellow"" rice, tomato lettuce, olives (enough to feed 2)
1 Lamb plate 
1 falafel plate salad. the Falafel was fresh and fried while i was waiting for my order.
Team got excited :)
We were little disappointed even the food was good and portion generous (enough to share).
Hummus and ""babaganoush"" roasted eggplant wasn't amazing.
You know when so many speak highly about a place, you expect more ...
it's how i feel about chickpeas.
beef and lamb were little dry. The falafel was good.
the mix of lettuce, tomato, red onions, feta and cucumber were delicious. I would suggest to peel the cucumber skin, it was too chewy and hard
I prefer Meraki Greek Cafe. 
adding a star because staff was nice even the owner said ""bye Sir"" lol it made me laugh... next time i will wear my mustache LOL",XEH2VtVx5ZYATKEM4jZOXg,3,1,4,x1IgkU0Ed97cxw0lzjB6bQ

We ordered the chicken barg and the shawarma; both of which were inclusive of over cooked rice and a lack of flavor. The rice had the texture of mashed potatoes- that's how over cooked it was. The chicken on both of our dishes just tasted like they were cooked with a dash of salt thrown on them- very bland considering chicken kabob is typically super seasoned and full of flavor.

I ordered the Salmon Salad lunch special and while I understand it takes a little time to cook salmon, I feel like 20 minutes to wait to receive my food from time I ordered seemed longer than it should take.

Although the taste of the salad and salmon (though they could definitely decrease the gob of garlic placed on top of the salmon - major garlic breath!) was just average/decent, they do give a good portion size of salmon and their lunch specials pricing were nice. I think pricing on items from regular menu seemed a bit high in comparison to other Mediterranean/Greek restaurants.

a bit slower on the delivery.. again.. because one guy was teaching the others how to put together my meal.. i didnt mind it though.. just a tip.. might be frustrating for those in a hurry.. 

probably wont come back only because of the price difference.. other than that.. good luck !",A0Sy2srGc-AhXEuFoErDkw,0,0,4,KAiuV0rT14n7kLYzMOupjw

The restaurant is really small, a little crowded and certainly crammed in behind the counter where their grill and salad station and registers are. The grill is so small it can maybe cook 3 items. So when it got busy, the wait seemed to be long and perhaps they were understaffed. 

We waited a long time for our two items. I had a salmon salad which was tomatoes and cucumber and salmon. The salmon was totally over cooked and tasted like tuna. I thought it should have more in it, like garbanzo beans or feta or something that would make it more exciting than what I could throw together at home. The salad also came dry, they have bottles of vinaigrette on every table (with the IKEA stickers still on them). My husband had the Mediterranean burger which was cooked well and tasty. 

For $25, it seemed like a waste of money and definitely not satisfying.",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,0,0,2,4FFcxCrqnlU9pPU2wEzlaw

I had the gyro sandwich, fries and a coke all for $10. Glad I was able to eat enough and save the rest for later :) I will definitely be back soon.
