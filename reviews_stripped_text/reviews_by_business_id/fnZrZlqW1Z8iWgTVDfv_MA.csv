270889,2015-04-02,0,fnZrZlqW1Z8iWgTVDfv_MA,WORST experience EVER!!!!! never have i ate anywhere to the level of grossness this place offered. They actually served me garbage for food. I ordered a chicken sandwich i got to work took the bun off put some ketchup then took a bite of my burger it was so stale and hard i immediately spit it out. So after being in shock of what just happened i took the bun off once again and saw some of my lettuce was black. And the worst part it that the chicken patty was grey with some spots of meat missing inside its really hard to explain when i called the manager she really was not too concerned with the quality offered me to remake the burger . I couldn't possibly eat at that location again. She then offered me a free burger coupon i had to go and pick it up at the carls jr. So when i got there i went inside for my refund and it was not the best looking inside either all the employees seemed to not even care that they served me that and they gave me a small fountain cup while i waited and the soda was flat. I then realized the problem is with management and not running that location right.  Lack of employee quality.   you can even see how  stiff the chicken looks on the pictures i took.,xammeA3ftpFoAN13v5Blyg,2,0,1,i2Soid_X8XsSTyIrPOst6g

Offered a token apology and still took another 10 minutes to get my food",CMMlQQxJXr6f4Jop_ozZKA,0,0,2,eDqCFNQyAv74NID-BcT5KA

This place was one of the good ones but appears to be making the move from good to bad. Yesterday, the food was horrible and incorrectly made, the restaurant and the bathroom were both dirty, and the service was not good. It was as if the manager was AWOL and the workers did not care about their jobs enough to step up and run the place correctly. I don't know if I'll ever return to this carls jr. Looks like we are going to have to find another one.",PbYyhY9x6ETJ5Gn5xTaOdQ,1,0,1,7CAj381UGIsh989OfVEk6Q

I watched the cars at In N Out moving, and there I was, waiting to place an order. Finally, I decided to go across the street, where a young girl was outside taking orders, and these idiots never returned to the speaker. So I drove forward, to get out, there was ONE car (not 100) in front of the window. Luckily I was able to back out, as there was no one behind me. The ONLY reason I ever go to them is when I'm in a hurry and don't want to wait at In N Out. Now I won't even try them then!",PtD-ku_bORwUgFaYa7u7Qg,1,1,1,VKRbWWxlhrb6fy-6gEOXYA
1698248,2015-07-01,0,fnZrZlqW1Z8iWgTVDfv_MA,Horrible!!! I haven't been here in ages and now I know why! I ordered the chicken sandwich and I can't even describe what the meat was. I took a bite into it and it had the weirdest texture. At first I thought it was a tomato but then I realized it was the chicken. It had some sort of rubbery skin looking thing on the chicken.

1919742,2014-08-14,0,fnZrZlqW1Z8iWgTVDfv_MA,"Hot fresh food usually.  Staff seems to turn over lots.  Bad place to put them right across from in n out, but when in n out is busy this is a good alternative.  Don't try the new Texas burger, get the Memphis instead(much better deal). The jalape√±o straws are worthless!  No spice and taste stale.  Burger isn't bad once you take them off, but then again it's pretty much a Memphis with less ""brisket.""",gQhFacMGI41mfVXqw1E7bQ,0,0,4,uDYGaAOUgo7SLuH5nUZs3w

3257868,2010-08-11,0,fnZrZlqW1Z8iWgTVDfv_MA,"You would think that since this Carl's Jr. is next to a new In N Out Burger, that this place wouldn't stand a chance.

I thought so first at too, but let me tell you -- Carl's Jr's variety in their menu sets them apart .

Their chicken sandwiches are hard to contend against.  My all time favorite (because of taste and healthiness) is the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich!

Only 510 Calories, 17g per sandwich.

Combined with the Light Minute Maid Lemonade it is an awesome and low calorie meal. 

The shakes are also top notch!

Food is a 9/10.

Service is a 10/10.

Cleanliness is a 10/10.

This is going on the work lunch rotation list!",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,1,1,4,dxUZv_54YdrmxEFSHnW42w
4227636,2013-03-11,1,fnZrZlqW1Z8iWgTVDfv_MA,I'm a Carl's Jr fan for their fried zucchini and their crisscut waffle fries. The biggest thing about this place is their chicken sandwich. I definitely choose their chicken sandwich over any other fast food place in town that is. The chicken isn't breaded and its always tasty and moist. Their customer service could be a bit better though but it doesn't stop me from coming back.,sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,1,2,4,baoWrBWaH_WdDrLhnN11NA
4265108,2011-04-07,0,fnZrZlqW1Z8iWgTVDfv_MA,Customer service has been top notch on every visit. Their food is consistent and I only get two things here (not including my drink) which is the spicy chicken sandwich and criscut fries. They're my classics :),77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,0,0,4,IH998Fi8vDa6In8oyYa3bA
4573129,2010-11-27,0,fnZrZlqW1Z8iWgTVDfv_MA,"So why would I be giving a Fast Food chain location a 5 star rating? For some reason, THIS Carl's Jr. is one in a million. Yes, there is an In-and-Out across the street but this Carl's Jr is everything In-and-Out can't be. 

First of all, THEIR SHAKES!!! Carl's Jr. shakes are hand scooped, and mixed upon order unlike they're competitors across the street. The chocolate shake IS the best I've EVER had from a drive thru. Point for Carl's Jr.

Second, the hand battered chicken strips were literally hand battered, i watch the guy through the service window dip and fry. The single best chicken strips i've ever had (but they may need new sauces, tired of BBQ...but still outstanding nonetheless). Point 2 for Carl's Jr

Lastly, Hours. 24/7 on the weekends and midnight on the weekdays. Brilliant for my late night guru-ness.

Worth the drive!",YDkC5VVT8s9NlIZtAr8NUA,0,0,5,WUAt5-krh075Ie44np8Hew

However... they advertise hand breaded chicken fingers and WOW they are REALLLLLY GOOD.  The bad part is they are over priced for em though.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,0,0,3,snRJkwDEB_A7xz83cYqO1w
