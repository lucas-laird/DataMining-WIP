Please forgive us for us rolling in at 9:20 on a weeknight totally oblivious to your closing time. We feel honored that you still took care of our unruly hungry bellies, and we're so glad to have experienced such delicious take-out!

You were actually our first introduction to Vegas, and the fact that you didn't turn us away spoke volumes to the credibility of your establishment and commitment to service. We had been driving all day, with three pets and the last of our moving boxes and your restaurant was the closest thing to where we were staying. Lucky for us! (Late night for you...)

We've since enjoyed many of your menu items, often as take-out but in the comfort of the restaurant as well. Thank you for delicious tom Kha, tofu larb, egg rolls, pad see ew, drunken noodles... And an extra star for being welcoming that first night we were moving in to our new place.

Cheers!",J5irHjVyff4x-BoFjPt9cQ,0,0,5,-49BP1vtGrMBxcyCNll_Wg

The lunch specials are amazing. I often wind up with lunch, desert, and a soda for under $10.

Caveat: this is a small place, and they can get overwhelmed. If you walk in and see lots of people, prepare to dine at a leisurely pace. It's worth it. 

Also: it is not fancy.  It is tucked in between Goodwill and a Vape shop. There is some tape on the booth seats, and the carpet could be replaced.

Still it always feels clean - and the Goodwill next door is pretty nice as those things go.

One of the few things she eats and loves, is the pad Thai here. We order it probably three times a week. Deliver, pick up for take out, dine in... you name it. We loved this place, the server knew us and our order by heart. 
I took my daughter and my 16 month old son to dine in yesterday. My autistic daughter who has just become semi verbal was greeting everybody with an emphatic ""hi!"" And smiling and happy to be out. It was a 75% full restaurant. The server That has taken care of us for the year and a half we have lived here, asked us to leave because other customers were complaining about my daughter being loud. 
Let me repeat that. 
I was asked to leave this restaurant because my autistic child was apparently ruining other guests experience. 
As I then said that we no longer wished to eat here, ever again, she tried to tell me to please understand. I work in a restaurant.  So does my husband.   I understand that this was absolutely discrimination and if I could go and take this instance further than just a review, I would.  My child struggles enough with daily things in life. It was very sad as I packed my kids up and my daughter is crying bye food, bye pad Thai.  I took the opportunity to kiss my child's face and remind her that she's beautiful and did absolutely nothing wrong.  
A nice man and one of the guests we apparently disturbed helped us out. I said I was just asked to leave because my special needs child was disruptive and he was appalled. 

F this place. And if anybody has any advice on how I can make this a bigger deal, please let me know. I will be letting the autism community know as well.  Thanks for reading.",20rcDxZ9hlj9oevGmk_uGQ,1,0,1,7ZSmhket7SFzdufKxuVPdQ

The egg roll is all cabbage, celery, onion. Not tasty. The soup is all cabbage, celery and onion. Not tasty. The salad was big leaves of lettuce with honey mustard on it. The leaves are too big to get in your mouth unless you want dressing all over your face. They need to be cut smaller, but all you get for flatware is a fork. So... For the entrees we got a beef stir fry, a chicken cashew, and red curry with pork. All came with a side of rice.

While it is not a high dollar, dress up, date night place, it can become a couples casual, relaxed, comfortable night out place.

The decor has upgraded over the years but they are in a shopping center strip mall. There is a limit to what they can accomplish. 
The Spicy Basil Beef is wonderful. I recently had the Pad Thai and it was great also. They have appetizers specials all day on weekends and certain hours weekdays. Check the menu out and give them a try. You won't regret it.

My bf & I have been eating here consistently for years now. It's our go-to delivery option- the food usually arrives in under 30 minutes (granted, we live very close), hot, huge portions, great prices, phenomenal taste, and friendly service. 

We've also gone in a time or two for the lunch special- always a good deal.

The food was tasty, variety is wide enough you wouldn't get bored and the service was attentive. 

I still order from this location, though it seems as though now you kind of get a ""luck of the draw"" when it comes to quality of the food. Almost as though it depends on who is in the kitchen that day. 

My usual is the spicy chicken friend rice with a side of peanut sauce (to mix in). The flavor is good, though sometimes there's a bit much of the basil leaves. It comes in a hearty serving with onions, bell peppers and garlic sauteed in. 

I just ate here last night, called in an order which was ready for me by the time I arrived (less than 10 minutes later). I got lucky with the cook as it was very flavorful without too much basil. :) Just the way I remembered getting it. 

I don't have many complaints about this place. It's a little hole in the wall next to the Goodwill Super Center on Tropicana and Pecos. Service has always been friendly and efficient and the prices are great, too. 

The fried rice is 7.99, 9.99 if you get it with shrimp instead. The most expensive items on the menu are 14.99, though the average price for dishes is about $10. Everything is very affordable. 

I only hesitate to give 5 stars due to the inconsistency of the meals. 99% of the time I have been in heaven, but that 1% really ruined the 5 stars for me.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,1,1,4,c2KFrm9LGbwZPDCvyYbKyg

I'm no expert in authenticate Thai cuisine, so I can't speak to the authenticity of their grub but it IS tasty. 

My boyfriend and I popped in to grab some lunch to go the other day. There were a couple of tables occupied but they weren't busy. Our waitress was quick to help us and let us take a seat at a table while we waited. Their dining room has been decorated cutely with lots of cushy pink chairs and natural lighting. We got thai iced coffees while we waited and they were satisfying and delicious.

We were told the lunch specials were not available, despite it being around noon.

I opted for the regular portion of yellow curry, heat level 3, and a papaya salad at a level 3 heat. They aren't afraid of spice and I found the salad especially left a pleasant tingling burn on my lips. My curry was flavorful and saucy, with big chunks of carrots, onion and potato studding the vibrant sauce. It was extremely satisfying after a long night. I was surprised to find shrimp studding the papaya salad, a nice addition!

My boyfriend ordered the dinner portion of lemon chicken, which he enjoyed. The bite I tried was satisfactorily tasty. I'm usually the one who polishes their plates in our family, but he mowed through his entire box!

Our meal came with an egg roll, fried shrimp, a small salad and a small soup. I'm not sure if they were included with one of our meals or if they were just an extra thing thrown in.

We ordered the Thai iced tea ($2.50), the pad see ew with chicken ($8.99), and the green curry with beef ($8.99).  You'll probably notice that the prices are a little higher than your average hole in the wall Thai place, but the extra dollar or two is worth it to me.

The Thai iced tea was sweet and creamy, and had a little hint of original flavor in it.  Some sort of herbal tea might have been mixed in.  I liked it a lot.  

The green curry with beef was very nice, and the basis of my 4 stars.  It was basic, consisting only of bamboo slices, small chunks of beef, chopped eggplant, and green beans.  For a basic recipe with no fanciness though, the curry tasted good.  It was subtle, but at the same time flavorful.  Order this one with some heat to offset the light sweetness.  The curry was liquidy, which is always a good sign for curry.  I kind of wish there was more flair with this dish, but for a basic recipe it was tasty!

The pad see ew was also quite good.  It was a bit saucier than the drier style of this classic Thai dish.  The chicken was cooked with a smoky tasting herb, which was nice.  The Chinese broccoli was slightly skimpy, but fresh and yummy.

I would say it has moved curry into a favorite dish category for me. Rich, creamy with perfectly cooked potatoes & carrots. 3 level spice has a great kick for me, while still highly palatable.

We tried the Chicken Tom Kha level 3 and Chicken Spicy Basil level 3. I always try a low heat when it's my first time at a place. I also had their thai iced tea which was comparable to archi's (my favorite) perfect amount of sweetness yumm!! The wait was a little long but when I tried the Tom Kha, I no longer cared about the wait haha It was very creamy and flavorful and had lots of mushrooms, chicken, lemongrass, you know, all the good stuff. They didn't skimp. The Chicken Spicy Basil had not as much flavor as the Tom Kha but it was still pretty good and I liked that they added some fresh green beans to it.
The waitresses were friendly, had to ask them to refill my water but that's fine, not a big deal.
I'm always in this area so I've been on a hunt for a satisfying thai place nearby and compared to Dang Dee, and Thai Chili, this is the place that I will definitely come back to. I wanted to try the deserts because they had roti, mango with sticky rice, and fried bananas with coconut ice cream (all of which I love) but my boyfriend was craving sweet addiction's ice cream cookie so we went there after.
I will definitely be back and hopefully their deserts are just as good as their food! :)",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,0,0,4,u7_QHqi4fhijTErpeynNzQ

3375537,2013-02-09,0,QDF7w0casJ78PcPmtMDISw,"Just ordered food for delivery. Delivery was quick. They quoted 40 minutes, but I believe the nice man arrived in under 25.

I ordered Panang Curry with pork, Pad Thai noodles with shrimp, Thai Room Chicken Satay, Mango Sticky Rice, & of course, their Thai Tea. All of this was delivered to my door in about 20 minutes!

Please disregard the 4 stars I gave in my previous review (in fact, reserve the 4 stars just for their green curry & fried tofu. Today's review is based on the dishes I ordered today, which in turn was based on other Yelpers' recommendations.

Panang Curry with pork: I ordered this with a heat (spiciness) level of 3. This dish is delicious & perfect. The blend of spices & ingredients, the texture, the heat--all PERFECT! I cannot stop eating it. I tried it with both sticky rice & regular steamed rice. It is better with regular steamed rice. 5/5 stars!

Pad Thai noodles with shrimp: This was also delicious. It was delivered, so they separated the bean sprouts & placed the noodles in foil, which was awesome. I've had pad thai from many restaurants in Hawaii & in Texas. This pad thai has a unique flavor that I haven't encountered before, but I like it. It's refreshing & filling at the same time! 4.5/5 stars!

Thai Room Satay: The chicken was deliciously marinated, & it came with some kind of pickled salad on the side & of course the yummy peanut sauce. Overall, I enjoyed this appetizer, but the chicken was just a tad overcooked. Still delicious though! 4/5 stars!

Mango Sticky Rice: This dessert blew my mind!! It's basically two huge pieces of ripe mango next to a bed of warm, sweet, gooey (in a good way!) sticky rice, all on a light bed of condensed milk. AMAZING! 5/5 stars!

And last, but not least, their Thai Tea! Like I mentioned, I've eaten Thai food at dozens of restaurants in Hawaii & Texas. Thai Room's Thai Tea beats them all with their hands tied behind their back!!! They also delivered this Thai Tea, & it was just as good (if not better) as the Thai Tea I had ordered in person previously! Cold, smooth, & refreshing (& all ice cubes intact!) 5/5 stars!

Thai Lao in Kapolei, HI was my go-to restaurant for Thai food in Hawaii. Thai Room here in Las Vegas is now officially my go-to Thai restaurant In Las Vegas. If I had to choose between the two, I'd choose Thai Room here in Las Vegas!

P.S. They included wontons with sweet & sour sauce, steamed white rice, fortune cookies, & loads of forks & soy sauce packets---all of these for no additional cost! These guys are so awesome :D",6CtC7rVQqvB-GwTuINvbog,5,1,5,3-d2UlZYfoC11yPXKXBghw
3376459,2018-06-15,0,QDF7w0casJ78PcPmtMDISw,"I never thought it would be SO challenging to find an authentic thai place in VEGAS that actually took pride in the food they served! I can always tell whether thai is authentic by the mushrooms - dead giveaway. HOWEVER - I will not judge the entire meal based on this & I've still had delicious thai despite this. 

First off - the egg rolls were SO mushy & soggy inside & had a really strange after taste, so unfortunately - I didn't enjoy these at all. The soup was WAY too sour, to the point where you can't even taste anything BUT the lemongrass. I hate when they do this because it throws the entire ingredients off & just RUINS the soup! The chow mein wasn't bad but definitely lacked flavor.

But the most annoying thing wasn't even the food, it was the lady at the counter. I asked her if there was any way she could offer a discount or make something ELSE for me since I didn't even EAT my soup or egg rolls, to which she replied, ""No."" No apology WHAT-SO-EVER, just a flat, emotionless ""NO."" I was beyond irritated at that point because they didn't care whatsoever about making their customers happy as long as they get their MONEY! 

I also found it funny cause there were people there saying this was the ""best thai in town""... & I thought how the heck would you know unless you've tried every single thai place in town? LOL I only came here cause I wasn't in my area & this was just convenient for me. But so far my favorite place (on Fremont st) is by far the most authentic & FLAVORFUL thai I've found YET.

Prior to a yelp search, I've never even heard of this place. With its nearly perfect rating, the bf and I decided to stop in and check it out. First impression: neighborhood joint, hole-in-the-wall feel. This didn't bother me -- we've been to plenty and most times, these kinds of places have the best food. Unfortunately, this wasn't true for Thai Room.

Solid five stars for value, but only three stars for quality. (Another three for service.)

Their lunch specials are a steal at $6.95... Probably THE CHEAPEST Thai lunch special I know, considering what's included: soup, salad, egg roll, steamed or fried rice, entree, AND drink. That's insanely cheap.

I got the pad thai, spicy level 2 (from 1-5), but it was super sweet. Like the sauce came from a jar is a way to explain it. My bf got the yellow curry and it veered more towards the watery side, but he thought it still tasted good. Personally, I've had better pad thai and yellow curry, but again -- you get what you pay for. The soup was egg flower, but I wasn't a fan. The lettuce for the salad was freshly-picked, the egg roll was good, and the fried rice looked bland but was surprisingly tasty. We shared the coconut ice cream for dessert, which was a good palate cleanser for all the differing flavors of our lunch.

The best panang I've had anywhere, for sure -- even better than Lotus of Siam.  Large portions are the name of the game here and I've always been surprised by the size of every single dish I, or anyone else I was with, has gotten.  I also did get a roti with a Thai yellow curry as an appetizer once.  Kind of odd for a Thai place to have such a dish, but it was absolutely perfect.

I come to this review having eaten in Thai (or at least that's what it said on the menu) restaurants across America. We've eaten Thai in probably 24 states and 4 provinces (in Canada). We have a new winner. Unreservedly, this is the best most authentic Thai food we've ever had. This is not fusion, Thai/Chinese or anything adapted to the American palate. This is Thai food. If you like Thai food, you will love the Thai Room. If you're visiting it's not far off the strip. If you live in Vegas how did you get to be so damn lucky? I had to drive 2500 miles.

When you go try the glass noodle salad. You've probably ordered it before, so have I. You will not be able to order it again and appreciate it, this version tops them all.

The experience here was a bit underwhelming, and confused. We were given lunch special menus and then told that the lunch special wasn't available... ...And it was difficult to get answers from the serving staff. Things were workable, but a bit awkward.

The Panang Curry, at 3/10 spice level, was absolutely delicious! -- except that I could barely eat it. I was consuming 3 parts water, 1 part curry, really; it was much too spicy, feeling more like an 8/10. And it's not a matter of perspective either; we ordered another entree at level 7/10, and which tasted like a 1/10 at most. 

The restaurant can definitely serve some good food, that's for sure, but something as fundamental as the spice levels shouldn't be an issue in a Thai restaurant like this. It's too bad, what I could taste of the Panang Curry was some of the most delicious curry I've ever had! I'm tempted to go back for the sake of trying that curry, at the right spice level this time, but it's not quite worth the distance and the gamble, given all the nearby, consistent Thai restaurants that are closer to my area.

Now, I think he might have just been overcome with jealousy of my dish so I may update this review later as I definitely plan to be back here again!

I was that guy.  You know, the asshole that tells the waitress to just bring whatever?   Yup.  To her credit she took it in stride, asked a few questions and I basically told her I am not picky and if it was a spicy dish to make it a 4.  My dish came out last and I'm pretty sure it was intentional to build up the drama.  There was quite a bit of guessing as to what it was actually going to end up being.  A nascent bet was also starting to form on whether or not it would still be alive when it got to the table.  Fortunately, everything arrived fully cooked.  I am sorry to say I did not get a picture of it because I devoured it nearly immediately.

She brought a seafood panang that was outstanding.  I don't get to eat seafood often at home since my wife is allergic to it so I am always excited to get it when I'm eating out.  The panang was perfectly seasoned and the heat was just right.  I do like my food spicier than most, but the 4 was definitely not overwhelming for me or one of my other coworkers at the table.  Admittedly, we are both kind of spice heads but it was a definite middle of the road 4.  Good nose run but not sweating.  The seafood included four mussels, a ton of calamari, some shrimp and what I think was catfish.  Good variety of textures from the chewiness of the calamari and mussels, the flakiness and tenderness of the fish and then the kind of crisp meatiness of the shrimp.

The thai iced coffee was great as well and did a great job cooling off the heat from the dish.  Like I said, this has the potential to move to 5 stars for me.  We'll be going back for sure.",2z7zF1x0yt_vR5aZKVE6GA,1,0,4,sOH0F0KR2AjK6aYzoXHZ1g

I recommend the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry. 

Even when it's not lunch special time(11a-3p), the value is still there. I ordered a Pad Thai entree today for lunch and just ate the leftover for dinner. The portion was impressive.

Started off with the vegetarian tom yum soup which had a tomato base to it. It was filled with cabbage, tomato slices, mushrooms and lots of carrots.

I don't like smelly food and this smelled pretty disgusting.  The Taste was magnificent full of lemongrass flavor.  I prefer a clear tom yum soup. I think the smell came from the cabbage or tomatoes.

I ordered chow fun noodles with a combination of meat.  It was season so well it reminded me of my days in Oakland California. When I could not find a good Asian restaurant which served St Louis Style Chinese Fast Food I relied on chow fun noodles because they are seasoned perfectly for my St Louis palette.

Another woman at our table ordered the pad thai with chicken. I enjoyed the dish.

Our spice levels were number one. You can order spice level 1 through 5.

My mother ordered a salad with shrimp and chicken. The salad came with a sweet, peanut and Spice sauce. Very tasty.

We ordered all single dishes which feed up to three people per dish even the bowl of soup. We were not expecting that. We paid $33 for all four dishes.

I am very pleased with this restaurant. Even the rest room was clean. I will try ordering the tom yum soup on my next trip and ask them to have a clear sauce.",QOg1dKpQklyjWzel1LeNgQ,1,1,5,wEEo6qwx-uU4B__zwuCIAw
