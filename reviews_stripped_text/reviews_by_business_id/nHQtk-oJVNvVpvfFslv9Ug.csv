Then when it was all said and done I spent over 20 in gaming. I earned 26 pts and my friend earned 28. He refused to comp my drink because I played my machines by entering 5 instead of a 20 bill. Honestly it was a slap in the face for a 5 dollar drink. I'm grateful I'm not a crabby old man like him.,_zPpPWC_HHGTeDZjPNvMLg,0,0,1,d5_iZQciTolGcIeGEbZtqQ

1258707,2010-06-23,0,nHQtk-oJVNvVpvfFslv9Ug,"This is one of my favorite places to just hang out, have a drink and watch the game, or gamble.  It is officially licensed as a casino, so they do serve food along with allowing smoking.  The ventilation is pretty good at this location, so its not too smoggy in there.  

The swing shift bartenders are awesome (Alyssa & Ben), and seem to never forget a name or face - or drink for that matter.  There is a decent local following at this location, lots of the same faces, young and old, most of the time.

They have a decent variety of beers on tap, which I appreciate, because I hate beers like Bud, Miller, etc.  Our favorite is the black velvet - Guinness floated on pear cider (some people call it a snakebite).   The menu is your standard bar food.  I love the chili cheese fries and the nachos.  Be wary of ordering any of the monthly food specials though.  I don't know who comes up with these weird combinations, but I've never had a good one.  Stick with the main menu.

I've had better luck here with the poker machines here than any casino in town.  That's not to say that there haven't been days where I've lost my britches.  They have progressive machines, but watch where you sit if you want to play it, not all of the machines are on the progressive.  A few of the machines are triple play, but not many.   Their players reward program is decent.  If you're gonna play, make sure to sign up for it so you get the meal comps/discounts and cash rewards.  There are also three pool tables, which are often busy, and couches with big screen TV's.  The place is clean and maintained well.  The only problem with this location is the women's bathroom has some sort of ventilation problem that flares up at times (sewer stink) so I have to knock 1 star off for that.  But other than that, the best PT location in town, hands down.",vH0VRF0veP-nwaLoAjpl7A,3,5,4,vxXbpibcQ7KGJZpDscPaTw

I was in a table with four if my friends of whom I was train to introduce to this bar. She took the beer order of a guy next to us, then brought his beer later and took the food order, then brought the sandwich and never once did she ask us if we we needed a beer or food for that matter. As she was walking away I got her attention with an ""Excuse us"" as she did a slow 180 while rolling her eyes. We asked for our beers and a food menu.

Now she has seen me several times but asked for all of our IDs including mine. I have her my voided drivers license which can now only be used as an ID, the real one is in the mail. She said she could not take it that I need the drivers license paper. I argue against so she involves her manager which today confirmed is just as inept. He says I need that paper. I let him know that this was not an issue the previous day when their internet was down and could not take credit cards. He said he'd make the exception this once because what else could he do. I assure him that just because I did not have the paper to rest assured that my age has not reduced since they stamped it VOID. We drank one beer and when she never returned for our food order we got our check and left.

Today I come in and this time I leave my ID in the car and ask to be served. He asks for the paper and provide it to him and point out where it says that it isn't a valid form of ID. So I ask him if this is just valid for driving why do you need it? ""That's just the way it is"" he replies. So after reading that he asks for my license and I let him know that it's not on me. He replies that he can't serve me then. At this point it was obvious he had an agenda and too dumb to admit he was in error and provide customer service. We left and I won't return now.

One waitress for whole place, but only three tables. Still barely saw her and had a mistake on our order. It was fixed and she was polite but not particularly attentive. When not serving she was seated at the bar watching a screen and drinking from a mug, maybe she wasn't feeling well.

Menu describes wings using the word ""giant"" but I found them quite small- one in the bucket was literally the size of my car key. Medium buffalo sauce was spot-on, regular and curly fries are both tasty. Standard bar fare, really.

Ordered:
Coors Light on tap- Ice cold and cheap!
Party bucket of Buffalo wings (feeds 3)
   

PROS-
* Good Food for cheap
* Friendly staff
* plenty of seating
* happy hour
*AYCE sliders, wings, pizza for super bowl

CONS-
* no happy hour during super bowl
* overwhelming smell of cigarettes
* no hand soap in bathroom

TIPS-
* Sharing is caring:  Take advantage of their awesome party buckets for wings.  You can order up to 3 different flavors.  I highly recommend trying the Garlic Parmesan flavor!!
* I'm not lucky at gambling at all, but I was lucky here... 5/6 #s on keno
* pool tables available behind bar
* had wings then realized there was no more soap?  It's okay... ask for a lemon wedge and extra napkins.  It serves as a good substitute to clean off those fingers and kill the wing scent.

Overall, this is a great place to enjoy the game.  There are enough tv screens in the place so there is no bad seat in the house.  The only thing that hindered a perfect score for me was the lack of the happy hour during the Super Bowl game.  Bummer!",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,3,4,_UgFySeSXRaRePvranWZ9w

Bartenders are friendly, Teresa the waitress is hilarious, and overall the place is mostly empty. When I go in there anways.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,2,2,5,wC4wL6l2SQPezpkbgN2iSg

Tuesday nights Troy is there and by far the best bartender I have met in the city. Attentive and drinks are amazing. He even has his own menu of drinks and all I've tried have been great!
I only come here when Troy is there because of his experience as a bar tender and customer service. Don't get me wrong the other nights are great too but I come only Tuesday nights. Try his cherry cheesecake drink, awesome!",uYCjMIWMjb1mE1SzMaBXFQ,0,0,5,L7Lz2OGvpIh1ypDFYHvNKA

Great deal on the bucket of chicken wings with 3 flavors. It was much cheaper than getting 3 orders for the 3 of us. We'll worth it and will come come back for this deal when craving boneless wings.",wVntggABnXioSB1NAwl2AQ,0,0,4,9Jf26CZVFBtW54pE_s8j7g
5355543,2016-11-16,9,nHQtk-oJVNvVpvfFslv9Ug,"I feel like PT's is one of those places where no matter which location you go to, you're most likely getting these three things: an unfriendly bartender, watered down drinks, and low quality food.

What keeps everyone coming back to a PT's are the cheap drinks and mediocre bar food. Here's a tip, though: just stick to the pitchers because the mixed drinks suck. The only good thing about it is that they have happy hour, but it's from Midnight - 2 AM. Come if you don't want to spend your dough on the swankier bars of the strip. 

Other than the cheap booze, there's really nothing special about this place.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,15,12,1,iatts-_hfoVIqnlkAmXPrg

No wonder it was empty. The little african american waitress/barback was the rudest person I've ever dealt with. How do you make any money if you're working for tips? She messed up my order, and then gave me a crazy, sideways attitude about it when I nicely, while apologizing (for her mistake), informed her that the order was wrong. Then, 5-10 minutes later, she came out and snapped at me across the bar and said ""it's going to be another 15 minutes"". Then, when I finally got my food and just decided to leave, she only gives me 4 tiny to-go boxes and no cups for wing sauce (the sauce I apparently paid $9 for, despite ordering $25 worth of wings). I thought blonde bartender was sweet, she even gave me a few free drink vouchers... Then I saw my tab. Nachos, Fries, and the 2.5lb of boneless wings, and ONE drink, was $55. Never at a PTs have I been charged $9-12 for BBQ sauce. I didn't even say anything because I couldn't deal with the stupidity and attitude anymore. I still left a tip because I can't in good concience leave no tip, but I will never be back. Y'all are terrible. Good luck to you.",E0QbflvM1V1BDlkODc3U4w,0,0,1,xNboq4he1wjWnL1QFZNqmw

And Vince is the best bartender in Vegas, hands down. Super cool dude. I always make a stop here when I'm in town.

Food 1 out of 10, I got the wings and fries and my wings tasted like they tried running away from the deep fryer but failed. My fries were soggy, just imagine cereal after 20 minutes. Best of all the barkeep didn't know his taps and gave me a lager when I asked for stone ipa. Honestly I don't know what happened to this place, but you get what you pay for I guess now.",CHMXWID3s5f6EAIBua6KqA,0,0,1,Mfc33kV1b7NtWpBOFBaRvA

We were meeting a group here for an evening of drinks and pool. The service was really great. I was quite impressed by how attentive our waitress was and how easily she was able to keep our rather large party happy. I was, however, completely turned off by how smoky and smelly this place is. I know it's a bar, so what do I expect, but I really wish they had some better non-smoking locations.

Overall, exactly what you expect from a PT's.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,5,3,1OOCVkIDvXUN3QBQJzE_UA
