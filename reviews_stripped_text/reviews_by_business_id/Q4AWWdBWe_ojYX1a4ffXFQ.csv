Expensive ass tiny taco; asada needs salt. The only salsa that was good was the habanero one. 
Of course they ran out of lime, radishes, and cucumber. Wonder what else they're out of, that's just what I noticed. Oh and they did not have horchata. 
Won't be coming back next time I visit the strip. 
My cashier Diego was nice, it's not his fault they don't have limes for my tacos.",GNhhQhcaX5C6zN1yvUK4Kg,0,0,3,arbEkmyXQYtsahwZgcGpIA

It deserves five stars for the great tortillas that hold everything together. They're just a little bit thicker and small than your average tortilla; they don't really get soggy or stale up within 5 minutes they way most do. Salsa verde and habanero salsa were really tasty and fresh. My favorite were the chicken and carne asada. The corn cob was also superb. The corn is very sweet and juicy! Great for sharing if you cut the kernels into a plate. The service was really kind as well and gave us all cups of water.,fhZtdEyrtkFqybH9nQeiPw,3,1,5,B7GATnLz81kNj9aP1zi1Gw

Tortilla - 100% yellow corn tortilla. Good in size and fresh. Double layered

Al pastor meat - Fresh! Delicious in flavor. Savoy. Soft and tender. 

Cilantro, onions, pineapple - good portion on all. Pineapple was diced same as the onion. 

Salsas - avocado salsa and red salsa. Both were really good! Ask for extra avocado sauce. Delicious. 

Open 24/7. It's $3 a taco. There's a special offer of 15 tacos for $30. $2 a taco ain't bad!

I was looking for a cheaper option to eat on my last night and I recall seeing this place when I got donuts in this area earlier. They had a free taco giveway if you did the Yelp check in as one of their offers. I used it on top of buying 4 more tacos. Some mix ups here... walking in no one was at the register. I was the only one here. The cook came out and acknowledged me then yelled at the cashier to come out. She intially thought I wanted just the free taco and rang me up. I had to tell her I wanted 4 more tacos with it. Both of them looked like they were still really young so maybe that had something to do with the mix ups. The food itself was alright (there's better Mexican street tacos in my hometown of San Diego). They have a banner claiming it's a Yelp top 100 eatery.  Most of their business probably comes from late night eaters as they are open 24 hours. My tab was around $12 pre tip for 4 street tacos plus one free taco from the Yelp check in offer. The one thing I thought was off putting was a side of guac was $4. Pretty steep. That cost more then the street tacos individually.,-fUARDNuXAfrOn4WLSZLgA,0,0,3,cFtAXSG0wh7w-16UoFSREg

When we arrived they were cleaning the counters and stove so the cashier attended us. She shouted out order to the guy who had been cleaning and wiping stuff down.. I assumed he was going to change his gloves since they were clearly dirty but no that didn't happen..now I get that this may happen at other restaurants and I just don't see it cause it's in the kitchen but if you're cooking right in my face then I should be able to look at what your doing and be satisfied with the quality of my food and it's preparation. My husband is a ""fire kills everything"" guy and so he proceeded to eat 3 of the tacos. Long story short - either fire doesn't kill everything or the they just weren't prepared correctly because he ended up getting heartburn and indigestion.

I was so excited to find the new Boulevard Food Court.  Its literally less than a ten minute walk from my room at the Grand Chateau until I'm ordering!  They are open 24 hours!  This is fantastic.

Inside you will find a pizza place, a donut shop and El Dorado Express.   The food court has indoor and outdoor covered seating.  There are restrooms there, accessible with a code that comes on your receipt.

El Dorado Express is an offshoot of El Dorado Cantina which is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas in my opinion so I was excited to try it out.  They have a good sized menu, but its about the tacos!  Yelp check ins get you a free taco and on Tuesdays street tacos are $2 each.

I had one carnitas taco, one cochinita taco and one al pastor taco.  They were all yummy and I cannot pick between the al pastor and the cochinita for my favorite... they both had delicious elements.  

Overall, I see myself coming here pretty much every time I'm in Vegas.  I highly recommend it as an affordable place to eat a quick meal.  Seriously, the tacos.",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,2,0,4,7oGiqBFyYutpYirPGFJ_1w

Tacos as simple street style, two 3-4"" soft corn tortillas with a large helping of meat on each. There's a salsa bar for toppings. I recommend the salsa verde, it's not the best in the world but it compliments the pork quite well. Only complaint about the tacos is the price. At $2.95 each it's hard to get full without spending a lot.

The quesadillas are good too. They use real cheese and dry cook them (no oil or, God so help me, butter) on the outside like you see at some places. Served with a side of chips, these are the best deal in my opinion at $4-8 each.

Burritos were the least good. Not bad, just not amazing either and at $8-10 not a great deal either. The meats are the same as the other items, it's the rice and beans that lets this dish down. They're both bland. Stick the other items or find yourself a salt shaker and grab some salsa.

So, it's nice that there are other options , but there isn't much seating inside.  There is a pretty large patio but who wants to sit outside in the middle of summer?  

After seeing the high reviews on Yelp, we headed on over.  Unfortunately, they did not live up to those reviews.  I'm guessing that those high reviews were written after a few too many drinks when anything tastes great.  First off, we were told they were running about 15 minutes behind so we'd have to wait for our food.  Okay.  So, we ordered some chips and salsa, hoping to enjoy those while we waited, but nope.  They came out with our tacos.  How hard is it to reach behind you, grab us some chips and salsa, and send us on our way? When we finally did receive our food, I was surprised to see how small the tacos were.  It was fine because they were only $2.50 each, but the menu should specify that they are street tacos.  At this point, I was glad that we ordered the chips and salsa because there was no way two street tacos were going to fill us up and I wasn't willing to wait another 15 minutes.  The tacos also weren't anything special.  They were just okay.  I ordered one al pastor and one carne asada while the hubs ordered one pork and one chicken.

5441703,2017-11-07,0,Q4AWWdBWe_ojYX1a4ffXFQ,Pricey (6 tacos and 2 drinks for $25) but the tacos were delicious and flavorful. We unfortunately couldn't tell which was which but we're not picky. We split everything between two people and wish they had given us two plates instead of just one. Service was quick enough - we weren't in a rush. Nice location - in the same place as a pizza place and donut shop. We got donuts for dessert.,8B0xeKHI6OY1Ta2OeeF3Zw,0,0,4,lXY6fed32S5CJbn85uwRKw

The pastor was good and so was the asada. Naturally, i compared it to the pastor at Tacos El Gordo, and Tacos El Gordo pastor was better. The location is great and is right next to Fatburger, in a lil food court with a few options of different types of food. Service was excellent, and everyone was really nice. They also give you a free pastor taco for checking in on Yelp.",vHES_pfiB-7b2Wfsz3IqAw,1,1,4,Pb1DwP_9tOK3ZnOQeGr-og

Tried the veggie nachos which were basically chicken nachos without chicken, but they didn't give me grief about it so that was great. They were quick and tasty. So much so that I went back the next day and had them again (I will say that had more to do with convenience than how good they were). My husband had the chicken quesadilla and a pastor taco and said both were very good.

This is a perfect Vegas late night find!",ica-FXNzyDzoOeArmg9Lwg,1,1,4,jqj4t7VRr92IAN6EOI1D9w

5878649,2017-09-25,2,Q4AWWdBWe_ojYX1a4ffXFQ,"So my review may be a little influenced due to alcohol.... lol... After drinking beer, walking up and down the strip, dancing to latin music, watching some weird street performers, I found myself standing in front of El Dorado Express... It was a hell of a treat because at 3 am and many beers, the only thing anyone really wants is TACOS!!! I ordered myself the Elote, 3 carne asada and 2 al pastor... 

After receiving my tacos I found this salsa bar which had so many options. I went straight to the HOT. The Elote itself was one of the best ive ever had, it did need a tad bit of salt but other then that it was perfect. The tacos so amazing... I wish I had room or else I would have ordered like 10 more... The meat was juicy and tasted well seasoned. I would recommend this place to anyone... IF you want to enjoy it as much as myself do what I did... Drink all day and night and stumble in at 3am... You wont be disappointed.",bDF4XoMF-bApT_YQD_duTg,3,2,5,Wo_6ru-wch7sWFSpiQUL3Q

I do have to admit that the tacos were excellent however not at the price advertised outside the place.",N0CrVBJs5rd2mDcmGutTxw,0,0,3,Onqi72_mIeUMwNFbQIK_2w

Tacos were just ok. Meat was not as tender as I hoped, but it was edible. The salsa station was messy and not very appealing. Don't think I will be returning.",PI0AJGt93MprMH6Myq7RNA,1,0,2,JiP6LK13TZLdT9RAYRWVOw
