42680,2013-12-22,1,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,"My husband received a gift card from one of his clients and we had never been here before.  We had been wanting to try it for awhile so we went there for dinner last night with no kids.  We got there around 5pm and for a Friday night we did not have to wait to be seated so we must have gotten there before the dinner rush.  The greeter was friendly and so was our server.

My husband loved the bread they give you before your meal with the olive oil & balsamic vinegar and I must say it was delicious.  We did the 2 for $9 appetizers - fried macaroni and the baked prosciutto & mozzarella - both were delicious but the baked prosciutto was our favorite..we could have just ordered a couple of more of those and be done..lol.  

For the entree, I ordered a new item. It was 3 cheese ravioli with butternut squash & pine nuts..  Oh man the raviolis were huge and the sauce, pine nuts and squash on the top was SOOO good.  It was a big order so I was only able to eat 1/2 after eating the bread and appetizers.  My husband ordered the Mama's Trio which included chicken parmesan, lasagna bolognese, chicken & mushroom cannelloni.  the servings on his plate looked like he had 3 entree's ...this was a huge portion so we probably could have shared this between the 2 of us.  My husband said everything was delicious as well.  

As for the restaurant itself, I really liked the ambiance of the place.  I would definately NOT take our kids here.  Seems more like a place to go with your date. And since its Christmas time right now looked there were a lot of maybe office gatherings.  We saw people coming in carrying gift bags.  I dont recall seeing any kids there last night either.  And a couple of times the hostesses came out and sang a couple of Christmas carols and WOW they sang awesome...so I really liked that.  When they werent singing they had Christmas music playing.  

For us, we really liked Macaroni Grill and will definately go back.  Next time we would like to go sit in the bar area and just order appetizers and a couple of drinks...I think that would be a great time.",WeDKeBEt3d8o9kk9vshOXg,1,1,5,yu2SvUtbdtG4kpURMJaCGw

She was outstanding and so was the food. I know it's not Mario Battalii down at the Venetian, which we hated, but it's extremely good for the price. The new half pound meatball and pasta dish is outstanding. The bread is great, the service was fantastic. The only surprise is that the place isn't busier.

We were seated quickly, our waiter Lemmand was efficient (hence the one star). My favorite bread arrived, it was good but the olive oil for dipping tasted rancid.  I ordered Lasagne and hubby ordered Carmelas Chicken. Entrees now include a Cesar Salad, but these were disappointing, wilty romaine and bagged grated parm topped with non descript dressing. The entrees arrived, my $16 portion of lasagne was small and tasted like canned ravioli topped with crushed tomatoes. I couldn't eat it (TOTALLY out if character for me).

204140,2015-08-04,0,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,"We had a birthday party there last night, and we were really disappointed with the experience.  There were 7 of us, and 5 of us arrived at 5:30pm (our reservation time) and the other two came about 5:45 pm (traffic delayed them).  We were not offered any drinks while we waited for the other two to arrive.  Then the other two guests arrived and it took a while for our server to come take our order--even just drinks.  We finally placed our order and it took something like 45 minutes for our orders to come.  Our server was working hard, but it seemed to us that he had too many tables to take care of (though the restaurant was not super crowded, he seemed to have to cover quite a large area).  It was extremely hard for our two 4-year-old grandkids to wait 45 minutes for some macaroni, but they did their best.  The food, when it finally arrived, was mediocre at best.  My husband had a shell in his lobster ravioli, the bread seemed stale, and my shrimp salad was bland and had only 4 shrimp (though the shrimp was yummy) on it.  This place has really gone downhill.  We used to love the food and the service was usually good, too.  I'm not sure if the long wait was because of the kitchen or the server, so I'm not sure who's at fault there.  Our server was pleasant and helped us with our birthday gift pile and brought a piece of birthday cake to my husband (it was dry).  I think he was trying his best and was working hard, so I left him a decent tip for his efforts (hey, waiting tables is hard).  I don't think we'll be back to this place for a very long time.  It was so disappointing.",Zf3R31xtJ6s7Ne7emZk7dw,0,0,1,lQ-ujtJ2MDBtCinXM2IxBw

first off, i am a demanding diner and our server, michael, aced it. he was right on spot: pleasant, accommodating and  attentive w/o being annoying. our food came out in a timely fashion but not rushed.  

michael immediately brought out our wine $6.(nice fill) and --the fresh baked rosemary bread...a+.
 
we ordered the 4 course tasting menu $18.00:
fried ravioli...a+, yummy. 
caesar salad...b, fresh crispy lettuce, tasty dressing, but...not enough croutons.
pasta w red sauce...b, large portion, came out nice and hot, waiter grates the cheese over the pasta, nice touch. 

i like my food highly spiced with loads of garlic. even though the sauce wasn't prepared that way, i still enjoyed it,  it wasn't bland or tasteless, by any means. 

chicken marsala, w roasted potatoes...b, tender chicken, good sauce and yummy potatoes.

the waiter made a fresh pot of coffee which we enjoyed w my
birthday dessert and italian opera serenade, from  a lovely lady named sarah.

     It was quite a disappointment. The atmosphere was quite comfortable, there were about 4 customer tables and the rest was empty. The food was great, but I had to wait about 30 minutes before my first order arrived, just to find out that it was the wrong order. It then took another 30 minutes for my food to arrive. By then everyone was done. Then the waitress suggests dessert (while my relatives were holding their coats waiting for me to finish my last bite); not the best experience...
     I was drinking coffee (during the 60 minute lapse) while waiting for my food. I asked the waitress for creamer and Splenda. It took the waitress 25 minutes to bring the creamer, by then the coffee was cold.

605052,2015-02-25,0,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,"I have to agree with some of the comments here. My wife and I were unimpressed with this restaurant from the start. We arrived during the lull period between lunch and dinner and stood at the host stand for a few minutes with no response despite servers in the room. As we were about to leave a girl came in that was clearly getting ready to start her shift and sat us despite not being in uniform. Strike one. 

Our server took a few minutes to get to us for the first time and pushed the appetizer special pretty hard despite us not being interested in having one. After that it took over five minutes to get our drinks - a water and a Coke - despite having enough time to walk in the kitchen, back out, drop off bread, pick up dirty dishes from another table, then back into the kitchen. Strike two, although the rosemary bread is rather good. 

We decided to get some side items before the meal since we were a little hungry. I ordered a bowl of soup and my wife got a side Caesar salad that we requested before the entrees. The salad was pretty dry, requiring her to order a side of dressing from the manager that was walking around since the server didn't follow up. My soup portion was extremely small - one layer and almost no broth. Unacceptable for a five dollar bowl. Strike three. 

At this point we had maybe a few bites down and the entrees came out. I had the chicken marsala which was about average, though not as tender as it should be. She had fettuccine alfredo with chicken, also average. The portion size for both meals was about normal. 

Overall our experience was very subpar, despite the friendly nature of all staff members we encountered. I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for anything more than an average chain Italian experience.",VBnse3ADbMPtwyQBDRwPKA,1,0,2,PEgb-va8q7qquVWQNoBEiw

My pasta was swimming in lemon butter sauce, it was way too much.  They took the bottles of water off our table and quit asking/serving us any water after that.

1200668,2008-12-14,2,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,"Looking for a bargain with good Italian food? Look no further than Romano Macaroni Grill. 

We chanced upon this place while do some shopping. The bargain I'm referring to is the chef trio which features a Cesar or garden salad, choice of five different entrees and choice of three desserts for $12.99. 

I ordered the chicken milano which was bow-tie pasta with grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms in a garlic cream sauce. The portion was generous, so much so that I couldn't eat all of it. More importantly, it was very tasty. My sister and the honey ordered the chicken cannelloni which is cannelloni shells stuffed with grilled chicken, cheese and spinach in an Asiago cream sauce. The serving is three tubes and neither my sister or the honey were able to finish theirs. 

Dessert choices are sorbet, a devils food chocolate cake with chocolate sauce or a lemon cake. We ordered the sorbet and devils food cake. The cake was very moist, made even more intense with the chocolate sauce. 

An interesting approach to how they serve the house wine. A large bottle of the house wine is brought to your table. It's on the honor system. You pour yourself a glass and make a mark on the butcher paper on the table. At $4.99 a glass, it's quite reasonable. The Chianti was very smooth and had a good mouth feel. 

Our server, Chris, was just finishing his training as a waiter. He couldn't have been sweeter as well attentive. 

Macaroni's is a chain, but I'd definitely go back to this location for the food and service, especially when you can get such a bargain for a prie-fix.",apH-zpPZLpr6PTZ84vzklw,3,2,4,FpQQbrUDuDgqnBQNP5a9fg

However, rather than trying to rectify the situation, he just avoided our table altogether.Oh, and once we got our food is was pretty meh.

I did receive communication back from Macaroni Grill and they sent 5 $5 gift certificates in the mail. This is the only thing that saved this review from 1 star.",JVh1vxfHySEA30mm6ymhjQ,2,0,2,g0cUguN45uNE8ZpOYfHVwA

Each time I went in for lunch the manager gave me a BOGO coupon and said that even after it was expired that he'd still honor it. Sounds nice but I'm sure it's because the location is hurting. Inside there has either been nobody dining inside or maybe 2 table with customers while i""m waiting for my order. The only thing I have had that's been worth it is a sausage and rigatoni dish. It's a good portion and tastes decent but a lot of the other menu items have been terrible and not worth the $7 let alone anything higher.

The bread was fresh and yummy. i love any place that bring s a variety of bread to the table. Speaking of the table, you can COLOR ON IT!!!!!!! How fun is that?!?!

Service is always stellar- Charles in particular stands out.
The house wine (and rockin' honor system policy) and bread are both higher quality than other chain's standbys, but their smaller menu allows them to shine instead of spreading themselves too thin.

We always get the stuffed mushroom appetizer.
Favorite entrees include the chicken under a brick, Carmela's chicken, and the shrimp portofino. For lunch visits, the bibb and bleu salad is my usual, and I'm really bummed that the italian wedding soup is now a special instead of a menu staple. Favorite dessert is the lemon passion.

They typically do some sort of nightly special, which never disappoints. This has even included a lamb entree previously that was perfect. 

The place also has a full bar (duh) with plenty of wine selections (and their menus even go so far as to recommend what wine pairs with what entree, pretty neat).

I even went the way trying one of the newer items on the menu the blackened chicken parmesan. My last visit been that long forgot the last thing I tried off the menu. I came with my brother guys on Ohana dinner night. We ordered couple appetizers the fried calamari and fried zucchini. I only tried the fried calamari. I thought it was ok. Not that much fan of the breading feel like could use more seasoning. It was on the dried out side comes straight out of the fryer. The dipping sauces were ok two different ones. Neither one stood out. My entree would say again on whole the dish was ok. I really enjoyed the side of vermicelli pasta simple tossed in olive oil. The blackened chicken has nice seasoning but feel like slightly overcooked. The meat was not very moist throughout the outside especially felt like eating crust on pizza rather then chicken. The bread that complimentary always always been fan of! It was exactly same as remember hot, delicious, and love the fresh olive oil dip the bread in. Overall the food is ok.

The service on the other hand never had bad experience can think of. On this visit they were on point again. The waitress was on top of it the whole night. She was very friendly, attentive, and made dining experience great one. 

Another thing that always liked about Romano is the paper on top of all the tables or booths. The waiter or waitress signs there name on the paper once sit down greets you. Especially if you have kids of any age. It great way for kids keep busy and never know might bring out artistic side of them.

Server was nice enough, had a positive attitude, but too little too late. We won't be back, we'll get better food at the same price at Olive Garden.",oTLY1xiJBheerlvuulXocQ,1,0,2,PNnEgtIxtNNJEdwZvKBkEw

Today my Dad was visiting and he wanted to take the kids to lunch. He had several gift cards to Romano's Macaroni Grill so off we went. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly hostess and seated immediately. If this review was strictly based on the service, I would have no problem giving them a 5/5. Unfortunately, the food quality alone takes this review to the 3/5 mark. 

The Rosemary bread and oil accompaniment was delicious as always. The service by Sandra was excellent on all levels. Quick to refill drinks and quick to bring additional bread as requested. 

The appetizers and main dishes, however, left much to be desired. My dad ordered two appetizers: one of stuffed mushrooms, which appeared to be extremely greasy and possibly frozen; and other of Calamari which was an extremely small serving and though tasty, were a bit over-fried. 

For my main course, I had the $10 3 course lunch special. It included a single triangle of fried cheese, a small Caesar salad, and a main dish which I picked the Fettucini Gorgonzola. Though it was okay, the cheese sauce was layered in oil and dripped off each piece of pasta, leaving me with a sunken stomach and an overall bloated feeling. 

It really seems like the quality of the food has taken a strong dive in recent years and it is because of the food quality alone that I must give them a 3/5.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,8,6,3,-4neZiEMj44yBb0SixctfA

The food is enjoyable enough, but fairly crude, salty, and utterly lacking in the finesse and character of truly good Italian food, with an obvious mass-produced mediocrity of either meat or tomato sauces or the other, overly creamy, sauces.  The bread is annoyingly herbal, a crude, mass-produced, cheap attempt at providing ""fancy"" or so-called ""artisan"" breads when the herbs just cover up the fact that the bread is mediocre, getting in the way of enjoying bread with oil and vinegar.  The pasta generally has too much meat, not enough sauce, and a ridiculously small amount of actual pasta, problems that were particularly obvious with the spaghetti and meatballs. 

 It is overall fairly similar to Olive Garden in food and décor.  It also has that ubiquitous and obviously fake feel in service, food, atmosphere, and the like - transparent ersatz ""local Italian trattoria"" atmosphere and obviously generic, mass-produced stereotyped ""Italian culture.""  The ""Italian lessons"" being blurted out in the restroom, for example, highlight the annoyingly hokey insincerity of the places ""Italian"" credentials, but the whole thing is perfect for a city like Las Vegas.  It's decent enough and I would eat here, but I'd never choose to go here on my own.

3003969,2016-06-10,0,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,"Yesterday was my second visit to this location, and by far my worst restaurant experience of the year.  I should have been warned when the car park was full but the restaurant was not - this must mean that everyone is at Chili's across the parking lot.

To start, our server Ali was quick to say hello and was very friendly.  It took a while to get an order placed, but not too long.  Food for my young daughter arrived first, which she began to eat but also to complain about - over cooked chicken, undercooked broccoli.  Regardless, she's eating.  But 20 minutes pass and my food, a steak salad, is nowhere in sight.  Ali stopped by and told me that the kitchen was having issues with ticket times.  The salad was ready but the steak was not - ""do you want the salad now?""  I told her that I would wait until the entire entree was prepared.  Then another 20 minutes pass before the salad arrives.  The steak is rare (it clearly sat in the salamander for under 3 minutes, so why did it take 40 minutes to prepare?) and the cut is inedible.  It was filled with grissle and was tougher than leather.  The salad is just ok, and I ate only a few bites before I tried to get the check so we could leave.

In the entire 40 minutes that I waited for food, a manager never stopped by to express their apologies.  In fact, it didn't even look like there was a manager on the floor.  They weren't busy but as the night progressed, finding my server Ali became a real problem.  I waited 10 minutes to find her to simply ask for the check, and then I waited so long for her to return to take the payment that I eventually got up and approached the host stand to make the payment.  Except there was no host.  One of the kinder gentlemen servers finally helped me to settle the check.  The only positive was that the salad had been removed from the bill, yet we still paid for the kids meal.  We left, and I went to get a slice of pizza.

I've been there - heck, we've all been there - bad days are going to happen.  But the lack of communication and human interaction was astonishing.  The core of a restaurant is hospitality, and we received none of that at Romano's.",NZ_MNakh_nK6zmxNmYg5Gw,3,1,1,Tt5bvaEKOCUCDQPMjh2Fxw

Our server was also the bartender but there wasn't anyone at the bar. While she greeted us right away, it took her forever to take our orders and bring out our food. Our salads were sitting on the counter and no one ran it out. I've worked at a restaurant before and if there is food out for that long, another server or the manager would run it to the table but that wasn't the case here. Customer service was definitely lacking on our visit here which is disappointing because the food isn't that bad! 

We were given an herbed bread with olive oil to start. We also ordered calamari which were rather on the small side but the flavor was there. The crispy mozzarella was delicious.

The bread they give you is delish. Its soft and yummy and the olive oil jug they leave you to refill your dipping plate is great. I just wish there was already parmesan cheese offered on the table.

We then ordered their 2 for $9 appetizers. We got the macaroni bites with truffle dip. Now think of a mozzarella sticks but filled with easy mac... This could be a great appetizer if they  made their own mac or used a different cheese. truffle dip was yummy.

we also got the baked Prosciutto & Mozzarella. It was a little crispy to be baked. It was pretty average. wouldn't order it again (assuming I ever go back).

Then I ordered the Lobster ravioli which had a very strong lobster taste. I was expecting it to be subtle with the taste of butter, but nope. If you like the strong in your face Lobster taste then go for it.

When our server came to the table for drink orders, she was pretty austere. No smiles, no chit chat. All business. She brought the drinks and bread. The bread, as always, was delicious. Crispy, flaky crust, and tender, soft inside. Love it. 

Salad came out next, and even though it was light on the dressing, the ingredients were all fresh and crisp.

I ordered the Chicken Scallopini, and my companion ordered the Hot Wing Chicken Parm (don't knock it). the chicken parm was huge, flavorful, and just a really fresh tasting well done dish.

The scallopini was a disaster. The chicken was cut into medallions, which were seriously overcooked. I mean, overcooked to the point that I couldn't cut it with my knife, and when I tried to bite into it, I thought I had bitten into straight up gristle. The artichoke hearts and mushrooms were not seasoned at all, the ""lemon sauce"" was just a puddle of oil that didn't even seem to have ever been in the same room with a lemon, and I think there were a whopping 3 capers sprinkled on top of the dish.

The really sad thing is that the server never once came back to check on us. When I finally was able to flag her down (after my companion had finished eating), she asked me if I needed a box (despite the fact that it was obvious my entree had been barely touched). In defense of the server, she did offer to have something else made, but I honestly didn't want to make my companion wait, since she had already finished eating, and I was tired of sitting there/

Not sure what happened to what was once my favorite dish, and main reason to visit. Only reason they get two stars is because the person dining with me got a great entree and was happy.",Clj5WdwsjRRBvN5byPvdlA,3,0,2,XC7TxxugXFzmK_85J09IAg
3563105,2015-07-27,0,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,"First of all, I know this is a chain restaurant, so I am reviewing it for what it is. I just had dinner here tonight after a trip out of town.  I went by myself and the host didn't say the dreaded ""just one?"" when he seated me.  My server did, but I let it pass. I am not a regular here. I don't think I have ever been to this location before, and I think I have been to different locations maybe three or four times ever. 

I had a glass of  the house red, which is served in kind of a cool way. They leave a giant bottle at your table and you keep track of how many glasses you have. In my case, almost a whole one. 

Their bread is pretty good. I am not a huge fan of rosemary, but if you are, you'll love it.  They didn't give me any balsamic vinegar, just olive oil and I didn't care enough to ask.  

My server could have taken my order a little faster instead of schmoozing with the people at the next table, but it was not a long delay and she seemed to have a lot of tables other than mine. 

Their green salad is nothing special and next time I would probably get a caesar or skip the salad. It's not bad though. I had the chicken marsala for dinner. It comes with a mushroom sauce, soft cloves of roasted garlic and spaghetti that's tossed with chopped parsley. I think that is the only thing I have ever ordered here, and it was good. I am not a red sauce lover. 

I'm not sure if I came on a good night, because my experience was not consistent with the bad reviews that I have seen here. I would definitely go back for more of their house red and some appetizers.  The atmosphere is also very relaxed with nice music, mostly standards like Sinatra and Tony Bennett.",msxc1VlPTD6E-0Kns7bIFw,0,0,4,jr64YomfWHEaFVjobsqkPQ
3575521,2015-05-12,0,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,"I've been coming here at least once a week for almost 10 years; mostly for lunch, and sometimes just for an iced tea while I work on my laptop for an hour or two. This place is like my 'Cheers.' And most the staff know who I am, I seat myself and they know my ""the usual""s. I usually sit on the bar area where Sandy, the bartender & shift manager takes good care of me. Joey, the GM usually makes his rounds to the tables to make sure everything is a-ok, which is really good. I like that personal touch. On the rare occasion something is not 100%, I'm not afraid to let them know and they always make it right in a jiffy.

Okay. Here are ""the usual""s. 
1. The bread is a must, unless you are a no-carb Nazi. They give you a small plate of oil & vinegar on the side. Here's my tip: ask for a separate plate of their shredded cheese. Break the bread, dip it into the oil, and then into the shredded cheese. The cheese magically sticks to the bread and it's wonderfully even more delicious. I've been known to 'borrow' one of these magic cheese shredders and keep it at my table for the duration of my visit. I love the magic cheese shredder so much I bought one for home from Costco.
2. Lobster Ravioli. Lobster and ravioli we're just meant to be together. Make sure to tell them to sprinkle the cheese from the magic shredder on top so 'it looks like a snowy day.' 
3. The Bib & Bleu salad. I love Bleu cheese, so I always add extra Bleu cheese crumbles,  (You can never have enough Bleu cheese crumbles.) AND I always add 6 grilled shrimp. (4 is too few. 8 is too many, but 6 is juuuuust right!)
4. Parmesan Crusted Chicken Salad. I always ask for extra .... Wait for it .... Cheese. LOL, they have large tasty shaves of parm cheese on top.",EpD7gvvA7z0XhksxIqe9vg,0,1,5,gOBfCOQnMISB6zBV4T8HTw

The ""sea-bass"" was overcooked, and yet seemed like it was cooked 15 minutes earlier!  It was not what I am used to being served when I order sea-bass which is usually a thick moist cut of fish.  This was a tiny portion of thin fillets of tasteless  fish which totally seemed more of a trout than a sea-bass.  This dish cries out for some pasta on the side - all it has is basically a warm salad.  The only saving grace of the dish was the little pools of balsamic reduction - the only hint of flavor in the dish.  We also ordered the Shrimp Portofino which once was a very flavorful dish, but it lacked any semblance of sauce or flavor.  Also surprisingly disappointing is the complementary bread which used to be perfectly little loaves cooked fresh.  I believe they have replaced their fresh baked bread with ones that are baked elsewhere, reheated and brushed liberally with olive oil.  The bread now lacks the freshness and rosemary flavor of the old ones from years ago.  The calamari was very good, but the thimble of sauce was tiny compared to the size of the basket and it was very chunky making it impossible to dip.  The lobster stuffed clams appetizer was pretty awful - firstly is was severely overcooked.  I could detect neither clam nor lobster in these things which were 95% bread crumbs and celery - not a good choice for $10.

I've never been to a macaroni grill but have worked in the food industry long enough to know what good service is.... the server neglected us...multiple other tables who arrived after received their orders before us...And when our food did finally come the it was barely warm and my friend recieved the wrong sandwich...we called the manager over to voice our concerns only to be scolded him. He did comp our meal....but our overall experience was terrible! Needless to say they've definitely lost our business.,fY2YJ9WJmRC_1L3_8BmS9w,0,0,1,7CwmyeVHKryQltYe5kQ7fw
4482553,2018-03-20,0,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,Buyer beware--Romano's Macaroni Grill has changed their menu (and not for the better).  They still have the old menu on-line and show pictures of food on their site that no longer exist.  We went for the chicken parmesan that was excellent in the past. Now you can order a small portion or full portion of any of the pasta but there is NO salad included if you order the full portion.  Everything is now ala carte.  The quantity and quality of the chicken is not what we have come to expect.  They have already closed the restaurant on Sahara (across from the Palace Station) and who knows when this will follow.  This will be our last visit to Macaroni Grill.  It's a shame because we were regular diners in the past.,R-gsradh-0niyke-NYUuJw,0,0,2,1X64uzYQqhVm1V0KLSoBqg
4484703,2014-09-14,3,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,"I would never have set foot into a Macaroni Grill - which I went to only once in New Jersey before most of you young Yelpersnappers were born - had it not been for one of those ""have a free dinner on us"" presentations that try to suck your money out of you.  We went because the hosts claimed they weren't selling anything.  And, hey, you can't beat free.

So I was pleasantly surprised when we were led to a comfortable table in a kinda private part of the restaurant, where we were given set menus to choose our dinners from.  I verified later that these were regular menu items, not some rubber chicken specials thrown together à la tour groups.

A nice salad was followed by our entrees, Shrimp Portofino for me and the Grilled Salmon for my husband.  I was surprised by the abundance of meaty shrimp in the pasta dish, together with spinach and fresh mushrooms, and both were perfectly cooked.  The only flaw was the complete absence of the touted pignoli.  When I asked our wonderful waitress about it later, she said she'd noticed it, too, and had asked the chef if they were in the dish.  ""He said 'yeah, two.' ""  Two pine nuts?  I must have missed 'em, and they didn't make an appearance in the leftover pasta I had the next night.

The salmon was awesome.  I would have ordered it - it was highly recommended by the waitress - except the menu said it came with ""sun-dried tomato orzo,"" and I'm not wild about sun-dried tomatoes.  But when I tasted it, I couldn't believe how fantastic it was, and now I want to go back and order the salmon.

Even the coffee - freshly brewed just for me - was excellent, and I'm really picky about my coffee.  

My dessert was the pitcher of milk accidently spilled on me by the otherwise-terrific waitress, on a brand-new shirt, of course.  But that wasn't enough to mar a serendipitously delicious dinner.  The pine nuts, on the other hand...",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,1,4,aV7S_7U6gB0-bYS2xA76Tg

The macaroni bites: YUS. 
The sauce they came with, even MORE yes. 
The mozzarella triangle: not bad. Very good mixed with the Alfredo like sauce from the macaroni bites. 
The prosciutto and whatever it was cheese was good too.
The bread they bring at the beginning was good, I didn't care much for the oil sauce.
The house wine was dry so I tried a glass of the peachy moscato. 
I had the giant tortellini with Alfredo sauce. It was so good I ate every single bite and nearly made myself sick. But it was so good I couldn't stop.
Gabe had the chicken parmesan. I'll try his leftovers, he was smart enough to stop himself xD 
He had tiramisu 
I had vanilla gelato with caramel sauce and toffee bits that I couldn't finish cuz I was too full from everything else.

I like places with natural lighting, especially since we came during the day...this place had horrendous lighting, it looked like they bought the cheapest light bulbs which makes everything yellow.

Our server looked like he hated his life and wanted to die. He took our drink order and came back with this loaf of bread and sort of just plopped it on our table and left, which sort of pissed me off. The bread was nice and fluffy though!

We had a table of 3 so we got the portobello fries for an appetizer and then shrimp scampi, signature truffle Mac and cheese, and a Caesars salad with chicken. 

The portobello fries were alright...not something I would order again. There was way too much breading on it, I couldn't even taste the portobello. I've had better.

It took little while for our food come out but it all came at the same time so that was understandable. The shrimp scampi was drowning in oil but other than that, it was pretty good. The Mac and cheese was quite heavy but it had a lot of flavor to it. 

All of our drinks were near empty and our server was no where to be found. Instead, another server got us refills. We all finished eating and waited long enough for one of us to start getting annoyed before our server came back to get our check. He offered us dessert and seemed upset that we didn't want any. 

I'm sure I would've liked this place a lot more if we got a different server. Sadly, I won't be coming back here.",IPGCGImT5tsLWWpLbvmLZQ,2,1,2,If3RC0Ft3BP1_l4qQULf9A

Very pleased with my service and our food. They have a few new menu items that are off the hook. 
Fig porkchop is to die for. Melted in my mouth. Cooked perfectly.

5593577,2018-03-28,1,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,"First off, a mini #StoryTime: Our family was eating dinner one night last week here at Romano's Macaroni Grill (and the husband was unintentionally still in uniform [because it was right after a long, hard day at work]). At the end of our meal, the manager walks over and lets us know that several regulars chipped in and paid for our meal, and that our dessert was on the house - manager's treat. I was blindsided: this was, in all honesty, the first time I experienced this in my years of service. Safe to say it moved me to tears in the privacy of my car - this small reminder, as my faith in humanity was slowly starting to grow more jaded, that people still care and people still give. Thank you, kind strangers, and thank you, Macaroni Grill in Las Vegas, for your kindness and generosity. 

By the way, the meal was incredible. The Portobello Fries were absolutely savory, especially coupled with their dipping Aioli. My Chicken Fettucine Alfredo was extravagantly rich, flavorful, and filling. Even the bread they bring out complimentary had the perfect crunchy crust texture they describe in Disney's Ratatouille. The dessert, Lemon Passion Cake, was ridiculously good. There was a balance between the tart lemon curd, sweet citrus cake, and rich but bland fresh creme that just WORKED. it never came off as bland, too sweet, or too tart. It was truly the perfect medley and complementary combination!

Our server, Josh, also went above and beyond for us. I wanted to make sure his efforts were recognized. Despite being obviously busy, he made time for us and made sure we had what we needed, that we were satisfied with our food, our drinks never went empty, etc. I'm surprised by the low-starred reviews... I can't attest to their experiences, but something has clearly changed and I was beyond impressed and highly recommend Romano's Macaroni Grill!",NO7hzgi7ZS3b2D5gNi2Gfg,1,1,5,6tPt4oXJ7uSh8t0l6aUMKA
5698134,2015-05-12,0,fpM-O9Ul62xizBq9YNO_tQ,"Went here for Mothers Day I have been many times with my family. Macaroni grill isn't anything special just an Italian chain restaurant. They were pretty busy we had 8 people in our party they gave us one loaf of their bread to start because the kitchen was so backed up they also couldn't find the balsamic vinegar to add to the olive oil for the bread. After about 25 minutes they finally found it, the bread is always good and fresh though. 

I got Carmela's chicken for my entree. It was rigatoni with chicken and mushrooms in a Marsala cream sauce which was pretty good for a chain restaurant. My uncle makes the absolute best Marsala and have never had one that comes close. I still do love chicken Marsala even if my uncle doesn't make it. 

My advice is if you are expecting some incredible Italian good look somewhere else. This is a big chain restaurant though it isn't terrible it's pretty basic.",NR8hSGOUqD-iY8rQPw4UAg,0,0,2,RM69zlpN_ued_FMb2MqyzQ

I am just hooked on Eggplant especially since I cut meat out of my diet, all but my sushi .
So we were seated with a waitress Julie. She was excellent from the moment we sat till we left. She was on top of everything. Very accommodating. One of the best waitresses we have had in awhile.
The food was very good tonight with the special requests that I wanted angel hair pasta and I changed the sauce to Vodka. No extra charges like some places would do.
My husband had Angel Hair pasta with Vodka sauce a bit spicy.
The food came out hot and perfect. 
No problems at all.
We highly enjoyed our dinner here and would for sure go back as well as our waitress being good that helped a lot!!

Calling to put the order in took sometime. We were put on hold for sometime and then someone hung up on us. I will chalk that one off to being Sunday night, even though the place wasn't crazy crowded. 

Pros - It is a franchise, so the food is always the exact same way every darn time. 
The price is always great for the same darn reason. The bread is the bomb!

Cons - It took 20 mins for the food to get done. Plus the 15 mins to get the order submitted. It is not in Summerlin!!!!!",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,2,2,3,yrS8Qi04D3CJNBQe3ZlHBg
