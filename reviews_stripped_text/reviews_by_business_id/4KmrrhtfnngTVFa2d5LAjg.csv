It was a great find and the decor inside was executed perfectly! The staff we really quick to serve us and the meals came out really quick. We had asked for a white sauce instead of the tomato for one of our meals which they got wrong but were very apologetic and came out just as quick with another one for us.

All up a great meal and find in such a great casino.",wcKvC0jov-kAHg-GIvWJqg,0,0,4,WVckAkG4n5WM0S5rngVY-w

After being seated and ordering drinks the restaurant manager Joel began insisting we order more food even though we all had ordered drinks. A few of us had already eaten at the Wynn's buffet and really couldn't eat more at the moment but wanted to stay with our group until everyone ate dinner. Rather than hear us out and let us eat the food we ordered, they took the food from the table and insisted we move to the bar. 

While I understand the desire to sell more food, Allegro should take into account it is a hotel restaurant and at least try to accommodate hotel guests.",Mc_PwQF-d5oCigck30WZhg,4,0,1,HGEeCPradXFXjuf7p8uiRw

The Lamb shank osso bucco is phenomenal. The nightly specials tend to always be good. They do not have chicken parm listed on the menu however will make it upon request and it is one of the best that I have had.

Sat at the bar since they offer a full menu and they couldn't seat me right away. Not sure why since there were plenty of open tables but they were showing the NCAA championship at the bar so can't really complain.  Ordered a Caesar salad and their rib eye steak.  Caesar was good no complaints but the steak was definitely not worth the price.  For $44, they had some tomatoes and a cheese layer on top which I'm assuming is there to make up for the lack of quality.  Wasn't the worst, but definitely average.  Wasn't cooked to my request. I asked for medium rare but most of it was medium.  Didn't have time to send it back so I tried to make the best of it.  I really want to give this place 3.5 stars because of the bartenders.  They are really attentive and want to make sure you're taken care of.  Really impressed by them.

318271,2013-04-08,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"The most exciting thing for my family vacation to Vegas was to stay at a nice hotel, eat at great restaurants, and experience great service. The Wynn is a beautiful hotel, Allegro has very good food, but service at all Wynn restaurants were terrible. 

From the very beginning the host(esses) profile you. If you are not in high end designer clothes you'll receive the condescending smirk to let you know you're not important. For someone who uses their work clothes for a wedding, funeral, or other like event, they are not making enough money to be a judge. In fact, a message to the staff at Allegro....You are all servers, you are expendable!!!

It took our server a very long time to come to the table. I can assume that when she saw we had kids she was thinking to herself, ""great, kids"". While I can appreciate that thought, my kids stay on their bottoms and keep their voices down. Before passing such judgment why not greet the table and get an impression?

Once our server made her way to us she tried hard to be cordial and hide her opinion. When she realized we weren't afraid to order from the menu she immediately perked up. Because the bill is high she knew at that point that he was going to get a good tip, so she tried harder. As a former server, I was offended by her reaction. I truly believe you appreciate the job you are in because there are plenty of people who would love to have your job. 

Fortunately, the food was very good. My daughter had a pizza, and my other daughter a noodle dish. They were both delicious. I had clam linguini which was amazing and my wife had lasagna, equally good. Had it not been for the the initial greeting by all parties, the meal and experience would have been great. Because of the poor service from the host and server in an industry that relies on great service, Allegro earned itself 3 stars.",aBD2aLEgTlCX_1rJYIaDZw,1,0,3,hq5QCGqVusI7p7FAmf8JHg

Got seated and decided on the special, which was a homemade sausage and buckwheat pasta plate, and the Zuppa Guazzetto, as well as a side salad.

The caeser salad was split for us to share and very nice taste and portions.  When the entree's arrived, both were good, but we thought the Zuppa was a little bland.  The special plate was flavorful and unique, but wouldn't be a repeat for me as the buckwheat flavor was a little overpowering.

The other dinners we noticed from the nearby tables were nice portions, pizzas looked great as well as the spaghetti with meatballs.  In retrospect, I probably should have gone with a pizza, the spaghetti or lasagna, but we will go back to try again.

Appetizers included a very good Caesar salad, excellent meatballs in tomato sauce, fried calamari (which my husband loved) and an exceptional prosciutto-arugula-Parmesan pizza with uber thin crust cooked in the wood burning oven - it was fantastic. Two entrees included a tender filet with eggplant Parmesan and a seafood risotto. All cooked very well and very tasty. To finish, a super creamy tiramisu, which was delicious, and a cherry-cake-cream concoction also quite good. As an added bonus, is located just steps from the Wynn theaters. Our server Amanda was wonderful- friendly, warm and welcoming who knew the menu well and offered good suggestions.

Our server was unprofessional, not trained very well in customer service and lack luster with his service.  They served our bread basket 30 minutes after we sat down and removed with in 10 minutes.  Our chicken francaise was DISGUSTING.  The very 1st bite was nothing but oil filled chicken.  I have never had it prepared like that and I had to cut to the middle just to get some kind of decent bite of chicken.

We opted for the extra olives/eggplant/pickled onion combo. Our superb waiter, Jack, allowed us to sub another portion of olives for the onions. He was very helpful with wine suggestions and brought two samples, unasked. It was busy, and Jack was really attentive to all of his tables. We appreciate such professional service! Back to the food! The grilled bread with the fresh mozzarella and the delicious small marinated tomato halves was perfect! We also shared the rigatoni and meatballs. I usually don't order pasta, but this was al dente and also

571914,2012-11-29,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"Well, the food was generally good. The calamari was disappointing, the tomato soup was tasty and the mushroom pizza was good but too much of something. I loved the first piece but then really struggled to eat any more of it, not sure why. Maybe too much truffle oil made it just too rich?

On the other hand, our waiter was exceptional. He was very friendly and professional and he spent just the right amount of time at the table, never checking on us too often or not often enough.

As a caveat, I absolutely adored this restaurant when it was Stratta. Part of the reason for this trip to Vegas was to eat at Stratta one more time before my husband and I moved to the East Coast. Unfortunately, we didn't do our homework and I didn't know it had changed to Allegro. Once we arrived, I called the Wynn to make reservations at Stratta and they assured me that although the name had changed, the menu was the same. It is not. It has the same structure (i.e. it's a typical Italian menu but it also has a small vegan section) but not the same dishes.

599184,2016-07-14,1,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"From a Celiac:

The Good:
The boyfriend loves this place. He loves the ambiance of being right inside the casino and watching all the action. He loves eating a great meal at 2:00am. The wine list is stellar. The risotto is his favorite.

All of Steve Wynn's restaurants have menus that have each allergy listed and what is ok to eat according to your allergy. Awesome! 

The Bad:
I'm going to skip to the ugly...

The Ugly:
I ordered a really delicious glass of wine with GLUTEN FREE pasta with plain marinara sauce. No appetizers. No salad. I've done this before, it's always very good. 

I didn't realize that I would be reminded of this meal for the next 2 weeks at the time. But waking up a few hours after this meal I knew what had happened. I had been given wheat pasta. I woke with a bloody mouth, open bloody sores on my tongue and roof of my mouth and raw gums. By the end of the day I had a rash on my face and had spent the day dealing with having bloody vomit and diarrhea. Nice. 

Servers that aren't Celiacs don't know what can happen by giving someone a wheat meal. I remember being a server and one lady ordered decaf coffee. I brought some over and she asked if I was confident enough that it was decaf to give her my phone number so if it did have caffeine she would call me in the middle of the night. I brewed a new pot of decaf, just to make sure. 

For people who really are Celiacs, eating out is terrifying. It is not a ""fad"" or diet for us. It is real. It's been 2 weeks since eating at Allegro and I am still having complications from that stupid wheat pasta. 

I know I will have to eat here again because we always stay at Encore and the boyfriend loves it. But I don't trust the servers/kitchen here so I'll be ordering plain lettuce, with no dressing next time.",CIrNEyR640XX9w2Pp9dA3w,3,0,1,aJwVATWu-9pQHGCRCfzXOA

Though we went on a Friday night, everything took a looong time from the water to the bill.  Total dinner time was about two and a half hours.  I understand dinner is an ""event"" when you are in a nice restaurant but the service was about three stars at best.  The pizza was good, nothing special.  I didn't try the lasagna though it had great eye appeal.  I ordered my steak medium rare and it came back medium well.  Normally I would send it back when paying $45.00 for a steak but it took us an hour and a half to get our food so I passed.  My friend ordered his steak medium and it too was overcooked to about medium well.  The steaks had a nice sear on them however and were seasoned well but it's hard for me to eat an overcooked steak.

Compared to the other fancy restaurants within the hotel this place doesn't look like much, in fact you wouldn't be wrong to assume it's another restaurant amongst the casino. However rest assure that the food is goooooood.

Our server was great and gave some superb recommendation. I'm a diehard calamari fan so it's a must try everywhere I go and this have it pretty good here.

The Bruschetta is a must try. Definitely very unique compared to the regular garlicky tomatoes that you're used too. The figs add a great flavor too.

We shared mains and we had the seafood linguine(was originally risotto in the menu but we changed it to linguine), lobster mac & cheese and pork chop. Wouldn't change a thing and loved every bit of it!

992630,2012-08-30,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"Tuesday's Restaurant Week dinner was at Allegro inside Wynn. It took over the space that was formerly Stratta. Alessandro (of TC Masters fame) got the boot. Chef Enzo Febbraro was highly regarded in Washington DC and hails from Naples. The restaurant has only been open a short time, but it's already getting great praises.
 
Our table for three wasn't ready when we arrived so we ordered wine at the bar. $42 for three glasses: riesling and pinot grigio. They later seated us in the bar area, which I found a bit odd since this area is generally reserved for those without reservations. The restaurant week menu had three choices for each course. We decided we'd each order something different and share so we could sample a bit of everything. One of the entree choices was spaghetti and meatballs, but we learned while the restaurant does make its own pasta it does not make its spaghetti. Odd. We wanted to try homemade pasta so the waiter asked the kitchen if we could substitute the lasagna. They approved, yay. 

For the first course we had Bianca Pizza Mozzarella; Proscuitto, Arugula, Shaved Parmesan, Panzanella Salad; Tomato, Cucumber, Celery, Red Onion, Double-Baked Fresella, Red Wine Vinaigrette and Calamari & Shrimp; Fried Calamari, Shrimp, and Cherry Peppers, Spicy Tomato Sauce. The Bianca pizza was fantastic. Crisp crust, gooey cheese and topped with Proscuitto and Arugula it reminded me of the flavors we enjoyed while in Italy. The Calamari was very good as well. Tender and lightly breaded with a kick... just the way I like it. The Panzanella was a bit bland and the weakest dish. 

Next up was Roasted Pink Snapper; Escabeche of Vegetables, Salmoriglio Sauce, Chicken Parmigiano; Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella and Baked Lasagna Napoletana; Meat Ragu, Meatballs, Smoked Mozzarella. The snapper was delicate and nicely prepared. The pickled vegetables were much too pickled for my liking, though. The Lasagna was very meaty. Too meaty. I've heard raves over this lasagna but it didn't thrill us. I'm not one who enjoys chicken parmigiano, in all honestly, chicken dishes in general don't appeal to me, but this was excellent. It was giant breast well seasoned with light crisp breading. The sauce wasn't acidic. We agreed it was likely the best any of us has had. Who knew?
 
And finally, dessert offered a Cannoli; Sweet Ricotta Cheese, Candied Citrus, Chocolate Shavings, Cassata Frozen Nougat, Raspberry & Meringue Sorbet and Tiramisu; Mascarpone Mousse, Coffee Soaked Lady Fingers, Chocolate Liqueur. The cannoli was not liked by any of us. It was heavily orange flavored. My bite brought back memories of spoonfuls of Trix as a kid. The Cassata was nicely done, but it was the Tiramisu that wooed us. It's right up there with the one made by angels at Circo.
 
Overall, we enjoyed a delicious meal. Service was great until the very end when it took forever to close out our check. Being held hostage is a definite pet peeve, but our waiter did go above and beyond to see about getting lasagna so it was forgiven.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,0,4,3v0_5faJfJoLQaTaDYWlww
1009965,2015-02-14,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"Just after a show, probably 10:00 pm, I hoped for the best. I walked up to the Allegro greeter's station during a very quiet week in Vegas, and asked if there was room for a solo, seeing that the front portion and bar of the restaurant looked lively and comfortably full. The first question was ""are you staying with us?"" (meaning the Wynn/Encore) Thankfully (I thought) I was, and was asked for my room number, name and food allergies. Interesting! I was immediately shown to a table near the back (which I appreciated, giving me a great view). I was the only solo at a table but I also didn't feel like others were inconvenienced by a solo taking a table for two. (Solos have a lot of time to think ...) 

I was greeted and served by a charming young man whose English I didn't quite understand but whose french-like accent managed to get his message across even if I had to ask him to repeat. As I had already read the menu out in the casino space, I didn't take much time to decide on my order. He picked up on my quick dispense of the menus and offered to take my order. I ordered veal Marsala and was stunned to find it delivered what seemed like minutes later. Meantime I was offered a white bean hummus and selection of breads/flatbreads which were spectacular. I've since read that many share my enthusiasm for this hummus. The speed in which my order arrived made me suspicious however I will (after tasting, prodding, looking at the kitchen which is semi-transparent in that you can see the expediters working) say that if well prepared, my dish was put together with organized speed. The demi-glace that was my Marsala was tasty if not a little too shiny, and the mushrooms (piopinni?) delicious. The veal was fork tender. This dish does not come with accompaniment so it is very brown. A diner seated next-table asked about it and lamented he didn't order it instead of his pizza. 

I didn't look at the dessert menu because I was satisfied with my meal, but expect it have to been excellent.

1085658,2017-01-15,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"Update:
Ok so I wrote a review below for our tough experience here. The manager Gabrielle kept her word and called us back the SAME night. She gave us a credit back for part of our dinner since we didn't have time to eat it. I am impressed with this follow up. All forgiven. We will be back. We will just make sure to do 5p dinner next time instead of 5.30 if we want to catch a show. 

Old review:
It's not everyday you spend $230 for your family and have 5min to eat your dinner and have the manager say that's plenty of time. 

Our server Adam was great. Very nice to our kids. He also told us he would get our food in asap since we were catching a 7p Le Reve show. Food gets placed at 6p. At 6.30 I get concerned but Adam assures me it's almost done. 6.45 comes around and manager Alex comes by and says almost done don't leave. I guess they wanted the business. Alex the manager proceeds to tell me ""oh you have plenty of time to eat.""  They bring our food at 6.50. No apology. I told him to bring me the check. My poor kids were so hungry but the food was too hot for them to just shovel down. So we ate what we could in 5 minutes and left majority of the food on the table and left. I did come back after the show to voice my frustration w another manager, Gabrielle. She took my name and room number. Let's see if they actually do something. We decided to stay at the Wynn this time but normally we love our M life. Looks like it's back to Bellagio.",oyxETmi-dsoxX3Jnwt_pbA,0,0,4,yZHzBp-MrCSdtoQPIReHtQ
1095393,2016-05-08,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"Mediocre at best. Service was ""ok"" in every aspect other than the busser. The Hispanic gentleman was helpful and actually cared- everyone else seemed to just be there and not enjoy what they were doing or care if you enjoyed it either. 

Was pretty excited to try Allegro after how delicious Stratta was, which is the Italian restaurant that formerly held the space. A complete downgrade. Pepperoni pizza was decent, definitely not worth ordering. My friends got the Margherita pizza which they said was ok just because they were starving. 

I asked my server to recommend an appetizer and he recommended the bruschetta- comes with 3 pieces and has prosciutto on top. I love prosciutto, but this dish was just ok. I had half of one and we left the other 2 1/2 pieces, but they never inquired as to why we barely touched it. I understand it's a casual dining restaurant and open until 5 am so I get its not going to have a huge culinary and 5 star service focus, but I still expected quality from the Wynn. 

The friends I was with said that the cafe was much better, so if I ever happen to be in the area late at night, I guess I'll be trying that.",eMOpOLfR1Zz5tfHUlzMp_w,3,1,2,fMzw--dO5AZDfB84Gdatvw

1171279,2017-08-29,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"A-MAZ-ING!!!!! I can't say enough great things about this place! I stayed at the Wynn this past weekend with my husband for our anniversary. We booked the trip exclusively because we got one of those mailers earlier this year which mentioned a package with free Le Reve tickets and a complimentary meal if you stayed for at least two nights. The rate was pretty good so even though we aren't Vegas people, we booked it and were very happy that we did (I'll write a review for the hotel later and stick to the food on this review. 

We chose this place while waiting in The Buffet line earlier that day. Wynn has a great app that shows a couple of their menus and since we were seeing Le Reve that night we picked Allegro because it has a specific menu meant to be had before the show. The app doesn't include all of the onsite restaurants and I was having a little bit of remorse heading into dinner here rather than at one of the more high-end onsite restaurants since the space opens right up into the casino, but when we approached the hostess I just asked to be seated further into the room and they were happy to accommodate. Once seated, I totally forgot we were only maybe 100 feet from the casino. The lighting was very romantic and the music choice was very different, but nonetheless great (it went from 80s to current, throw in some country, and then even a light reggae song- it liked it all, but my husband and I noted during the meal that it was an odd mix of songs).

When our waiter, Adam, came we were still debating what to order. The Le Reve menu in person differed a little from the menu on the app, but it still sounded great so I just needed to decide on an entrée and pick a good wine to pair with it. I love wine so I am open to trying something new and Adam recommended the Chianti. As much of a wine lover as I consider myself, I have never tried a Chianti so I told him I'd love a taster before committing. He ended up bringing a couple options for me to try so I could ensure that I had the best wine for my meal. I ended up loving the Chianti and the chef even gave the wine at a very reduced price since he was so certain that it was be the best choice for the meal and wanted to make my decision that much easier.

The Le Reve meal is $45/person and you must have at least 2 people ordering from that menu. They serve all of the appetizers to you and each person gets to pick a main entrée. The chef curates the meal so you can't customize it, but he is a talented chef who knows what he is doing so customization isn't necessary. I went with the veal marsala and my husband went with the chicken parm. The apps were amazing! I monopolized the Caesar salad while my husband devoured the meatballs. The dressing was great and you could tell that they make it fresh. The eggplant parm was great too as was the bruschetta. They gave us enough time to enjoy our apps without feeling rushed to the main course, while also not giving us too much time to sit with leftovers in front of us. When dinner came I got a second glass of wine (which was served with a very generous pour) and the food was amazing!!! My veal was a little more cooked than I prefer (but I like my steak rare, not medium-rare, I want that thing marinating in it's own blood), but like I said, the chef seemed to have a vision for the meal and he delivered. The entrees were delicious and the wine pairing was perfect!

Going into dinner, I had mentioned to Adam that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and that I wanted to see if that could do something special for us to celebrate. Also, right before the entrees came out I asked him if he knew of any classy yet relaxing places to listen to classic music and smoke a cigar. He got really excited about my question and after a couple of minutes came back with recommendations. When desert came, he brought our biscotti along with a chocolate cigar. Apparently they had them for a special event and since I mentioned our search for a cigar bar he figured that would be a cute dessert. He was totally right and it was perfect.

In summation, the restaurant was a perfect mix of romantic, classy, and intimate, the staff was accommodating and friendly, and the food and drinks were perfectly designed to compliment each other through the entirety of the meal. At the end of our meal I had some leftovers and they were happy to package it up for us. I ended up with some extra wine as well (that heavy pour gave me more than I was ready for at dinner) and Adam was happy to get me a glass that I could walk into the casino and even into Le Reve with so I didn't have to spend an arm and a leg on the wine cost in there. I already spoke with the manager directly about how great our service was, but I would HIGHLY recommend this place especially to anyone on there was to Le Reve (It is only about 100 yards from the showroom).",Y7EkNdRl_WCML9zo9lw1nw,1,0,5,rKGqy9HKtuO6cSsQANnV-g

The margherita pizza was one of the best I have had! It was so authentic and the thin crust was perfect. It tasted just like pizza in Italy that I had many years ago, it took me back! The pear cosmopolitan was very good and strong, just like I like it!

Allegro is the worst dining experience I have ever had at a restaurant in Vegas. It's actually pretty shocking that a 5-star hotel like the Wynn, in which Allegro is located, would allow for this restaurant to negatively affect it's superior image.

The food came out very late. The tomato soup I ordered was warm and bland. It was as if they had just bought a regular can of tomato soup from the market, put it into a bowl, and charged $14. The chicken parmesan that my friend and I both ordered was also very disappointing for $40 each. I have had better frozen microwaveable chicken parms.

The server, Jamie, wasn't even apologetic for how long it took for the food to come out. And it's not surprising that other Yelp reviews include Jamie as being ""absolutely the worst server."" She was also not very accommodating when another friend came to join us.

The hostess with the mostest with the tight black dress that *barely* covered her a## cheeks asked if we were guests of the hotel (no, hotel next door) and promptly sat us in the far back at a wobbly table, next to a family with 5 kids and another with 1. If I wanted baby land I'd go to Circus Circus. 

We asked for, and received, a different table from the captain. 

Next minor strike was that my Moscow mule wasn't served properly. 

I ordered the Big Eye Tuna - rare. I WAS SERVED TUNA THAT WAS NOT SUSHI GRADE.  Seriously. If you are a restaurant serving tuna to someone who orders it rare (and requested it as raw as the chef is willing to serve it), you sure better have sushi grade fish that isn't riddled with gristle like deposits that make it inedible. 

My mother's steak was delicious by her account. 

Espresso martini was very good. 

Server was average and treated our table like an afterthought. I think he was in the weeds a bit. 

Tuna was not good. I should have sent it back, but had already switched tables and didn't want to be ""that' customer.

Let me start by saying I'm not a big reviewer, I will only write these if something was so extremely disappointing I feel compelled to warn others. I'm not a unreasonable nit picky food snob either. This place just missed every mark across the board. Service was decent, and apparently whoever was there previously making guests life hell has been removed. 

Love the Wynn, have eaten at several places there and finally decided to try Allegro in lieu of Nove at Palms (due to the unfortunate demise taking place at that hotel) and unfortunately, for the first time was extremely disappointed by something at the Wynn.

We did the Chefs Table and the only thing that was good was the Calamari and Caesar Salad. Very disappointing for a ""Italian"" establishment and the price. You could close your eyes and eat the egg plant or a spoonful of salt and wouldn't know the difference in what you were eating. 

The meatballs? Rubbery spongy and simply not authentic, you will know what I mean the second you bite in. My girlfriend referred to it as ""spammy"" which is pretty accurate. I make my own meatballs with 5 ingredients and it absolutely destroys these, it's not hard!

The steak was pretty good, pasta was so-so and cold, and the dessert mediocre. It's just simply not worth the price and a good example of using the name and establishment to significantly overcharge. 

The seating is definitely a bit odd as well. I would simply avoid this place, it will give you a bad impression of the Wynn. I kept telling my girlfriend that everything at that hotel is excellent, and then this happened. Very unfortunate.

The best part about this restaurant was that we didn't have to wait. The drinks are overprice - as is everything in Vegas, and the food was just okay.

It had fresh mozzarella, balsamic, arugula, the whole nine yards and was probably worth the price. Another friend with a food allergy ordered just a salad, but they took her food allergies very seriously - which was reassuring.

Carpaccio was thinly sliced and fresh.  The paccheri lobster with pesto and eggplant was rich, flavorful and usually I don't like lobster, but this was cooked nicely, still tender.  

They pay attention to the little details, like a cheesy sun dried tomato dip, we devoured it and providing utensils with the doggy bag.  We usually end up eating with our fingers.

Neither were especially outstanding, despite a hefty dinner bill. 

Admittedly , we were a little early for our reservation.  When they seated us at the bar, we assumed it was just until our table was ready.  However, it seemed they intended to serve us dinner there.  This would have been fine except there were some loud bachelorettes at the next table.  No problem,  when we inquired about this they seated us in the dining room.

The food and service were ok.  My issue is that for 50 plus dollars per person, we expected a little better.  You can get the same food/ service at a Macaroni Grille or an Olive Garden.  I understand this is the Vegas Strip, but still....  The Wynn is a higher end resort.  I would not go out of my way to dine here again.

The reason I have to drop it a star is because of the service. Our waiter seemed to be stretched rather thin and wasn't around much. We had better luck with the bus boy.

The smoke wasn't overwhelming, and everybody was distantly pleasant overall.

3pm starts the happy hour here. Nothing happy about it EXCEPT the bartender, I don't believe she offered her name, but she was wonderful.

I ordered the pizza, the pepperoni pizza, I always like to get pizza when I'm traveling, just trying to see who really makes a great pizza. 

The pizza was dry, had no cheese and it was burnt. I didn't complain to the bartender, she was by herself and was trying to entertain all of her guests. 

Firstly the guy who brought my pizza out dropped it in front of me without a word, and if you are going to be so rude, then at least drop off some decent pizza. It was the worse pizza I have ever eaten. Again no sauce, no cheese, just pepperoni on a cracker, and I'm a huge fan of thin crust.

I seen people winning on the floor, that lets me know the slots aren't super tight, I've never actually seen anyone win in Vegas on the slots, I won, then I lost it back, that's fine, I was more disappointed in the food than I was losing my money.

2130114,2016-12-19,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"Had an intimate dinner at Allegro and the Wynn Casino last night. The bread came out (literally) frozen, and we had to request ""warm"" bread.  The bean and arugula soup was delicious, but the portion size was massive (hence the $14 charge). It was a meal unto itself, seriously.  We ordered three Makers Mark Old Fashions, which were disappointingly prepared, and at $19.00 each, an insult. Someone needs to school the bartender that ginger ale is not simple syrup and that Old Fashions shouldn't be bubbly.  My spouse ordered minestrone soup and an ordinary arugula salad, both of which were decent, but unremarkable.  For my entree, I ordered the risotto pescatoro--or seafood risotto.  I had to send the entree back to the kitchen because it was too salty.  The chef came out and apologized, saying that the assistant chef had put too much lobster sauce in it, rendering it inedible.  The chef prepared a second order of seafood risotto which was much more to my liking--although the rice was a tad bit undercooked. The risotto did have a decent amount of shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops to justify the $37.00, but if you are going to offer risotto, then the rice should be perfectly cooked.  The two of us spend almost $200.00 for a dinner that was uninspired, disappointing, and sadly forgettable. The service was, however, attentive; and the ambiance was classy, but for this critic, quality food is paramount, especially when they are commanding such prices.",A7e6sBajAjwaFdRv69px_Q,0,0,2,BDiBSKjGMUzDqJE4okVwaw

So, say no more. 80% of my group of friends are Italian so boom. We win. We were feeling adventurous so instead of each getting a dish, we all shared a bunch of plates. We had wine, pilsners, Caesar salad, baked lasagna, gnocchi, and two pizzas. The meatball pizza is fantastic as well as a pepperoni. Could we be more Italian? It was amazing. The environment was great and our server was outstanding. He even over heard us talking about how we wanted to go to a club and so he got us on the list somewhere. It was really kind of him.

2152021,2015-05-24,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"There are several things you should know about this restaurant.  First, there's a daily happy hour with a limited, lower priced menu and beer/wine selections.  The bar gets very crowded during the happy hour period when the hotel is busy.  In fact, it's not uncommon to see people sitting at the bar area, which is open from the casino floor, starting around 2:30PM while the restaurant is closed just to ensure that they can get a seat.  The happy hour guests typically extend their stay at the bar beyond 5PM and well into the dinner period.  If your intension is to sit at the bar around 3PM, you should scope it out around 2:30PM to ensure that it's not one of those crowded days when you won't be unable to get a bar stool for most of the night.  You should definitely make dinner reservations to ensure a seat if you know you'll want to eat there.  Now, the food is really why I'm writing this.  Some of the dishes have changed over the years, and not always for the better.  For example, the Ribeye steak used to come with perfectly roasted potatoes and mushrooms.  It was a perfect dish.  I was there in May 2015 and had it twice, but this time they offered it only with roasted rutabaga, which is a root vegetable that eats like a cross between a turnip and a chayote.  Not a great choice on their part.  The steak is perfect and nothing goes better with a steak than potatoes and mushrooms.  They had it right before.   The other dishes are all pretty good.  The pizzas are unbelievably thin and crispy with terrific toppings.  The veal parmesan is a show-stopper.  It's a pounded, bone-in veal chop that's about 12"" across, breaded, and covered with great marinara and fresh mozzarella--don't order it unless you're very hungry.  The beer, wine, and cocktail offerings are first-rate.  Great place, if you can get a seat.",r9gpNUoMKfHs_VeOWGqHuw,0,1,4,QlAV9PDEZFszpm4-XGifUA

They suggested we just stay at the Wynn for some drinks, appetizers, and great conversations catching up in life. Allegro is someplace that they have been too few times during their stay this trip so why not. It was the first time for me. 

Talk about great service and even better memory from the hostess. Like mention before my friends been here couple times already. So as soon as we were getting seated she mention remember the name and just something hardly see restaurant takes notice of repeat customers.  Overall our waiter was very attentive giving us time too order knowing that we were more about conversation then eating. Never empty glass of beer or mixed drink the whole time. We went just for appetizers and drinks. Not problem. The menu is your standard Italian fare  high end strip $$. I let my friends order since they been here few times. We got the beef carpaccio and meatball pizza. The beef carpaccio was nice. It was refreshing too see carpaccio not about bunch of stuff under or topped off. It was simple just shaved parm, nice wild mushroom of some sort, and seasonings on top. One that with each bite can taste majority beef just the accent of the toppings. The pizza very thin crust style pizza or could call it new york style. I liked the meatballs nice flavor, moist, and juicy on the inside cooked properly. The tomato sauce felt like could have had more flavor. Overall would say solid pizza but thin crust style had better at other restaurants. The bread basket like the assortment. 

Allegro definitely has your upscale Wynn feeling too it. The chairs really comfortable and talk about heavy. It takes effort too push your chair in more less when your about too leave. seriously. Thankfully its open kitchen because nothing inside terms of decor that really makes it stand out. 

I feel better Italian high end places on the strip or outside the strip. I would be open too going back trying more of the menu.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,2,2,3,FGOBT0If9OLV3iF0lVGe4w

The calamari was outstanding - the inclusion of peppers in the dish was a very unique and pleasing choice. Easily some of the best calamari I ever had.

The bread is decent - not the best I've ever had, but acceptable. The lasagna and rigatoni were both delicious (though on the pricey side - but hey, it's the Wynn).

The staff provided us with attentive service, and our water glasses were regularly topped off. The customer seating is a bit on the uncomfortable side.

If I were evaluating this restaurant solely based on palatability, service, and relative value, the score would probably be about 4 stars. However, enter the category of ""food safety"" ...

... and on that note, I need to mention that my dining companion showed me what appeared to be a single strand of human hair that she found baked into her plate of lasagna (see the attached photos). What, did the chefs at Allegro mutiny and refuse to wear their ubiquitous chef hats?

Given the level of cleanliness and customer satisfaction that Steve Wynn clearly strives for (and mostly succeeds at), I was quite disappointed and shocked at this discovery. As you might imagine, I would not recommend patronizing this restaurant, and would suggest trying your luck at one of the other many dining establishments located within the Wynn/Encore (my experiences at Jardin, Wazuzu, and The Buffet were definitely more hygienic than the one I had at Allegro).

The server/staff was friendly, and for the most part the staff were attentive; they meticulously documented my uncles food allergies and adjusted accordingly. 

After the complimentary bread with olive oil (but no fresh parmesan offered), I ordered the hearty minestrone soup and the veal chop parmesan. 

Minestrone soup had a better broth than my recent outing at Milo in Olive in Santa Monica -- and at the same price.

The veal chop parmesan was incredibly taxing to the wallet, and served a la carte, but thankfully my uncle was paying for it. 

I however, falsely assumed that this dish came with a side of pasta, but that was the CHICKEN PARMESAN, NOT VEAL. At nearly fifty dollars though, most Italian restaurants throw in a complimentary pasta side, and with Allegro this should be no exception considering the Las Vegas Strips premium for fine dining.

For dessert, since it was my birthday, they brought me a complimentary cross-sample of the tiramisu cake. Small, but beggars can't be choosers I suppose.

I am completely disappointed in this restaurant. I used to come here with my family whenever we came to Las Vegas because we enjoyed their service, food, and ambience. We came to Vegas during Thanksgiving and made reservations to come here for Thanksgiving dinner. When we showed up we realized that it was empty- that should've been a sign. 

When we made the reservation we mentioned that we had a baby in a stroller so they could accommodate us accordingly. We get there and the hostess was going to seat us in the corner by the casino and have us put the stroller outside on the casino carpet! Thankfully, our server rushed over and had us sit in a corner which had more room for a stroller (and just made more sense). 

We ordered one of their pizzas as an appetizer because bottom line is, they have damn good pizza. The pizza sauce they use is amazing. When placing our orders our server let us know that they might be out of turkey dinner but might have one left. It was only 6:30 so I was shocked but my thought process was ""MIGHT have one left....MIGHT not be fresh"" so I decided to get a steak instead. We all ordered different types of steaks and shared some side dishes such as the sautéed mushrooms and potatoes au gratin. 

The potatoes were not cooked and were super thick chunks. Our server apologized and brought us out another batch. Yet again, not cooked thoroughly. I mean, you expect them how to properly cook what they advertise at their specialty sides. My steak was cold, as if it was sitting out there for an hour. Our server was kind enough to reheat it but once it came out, it just didn't taste right. I've had many steaks in my life, really good high quality ones but this was not worth it at all. I can get over the fact that with the price it doesn't come with any sides. But don't serve me a slap of bland meat for your jacked up prices. And learn how to make potato au gratin please.

Our server was attentive and courteous to us even though we only wanted to order only from the dessert menu: A short list consisting of 9 decadent items, covering all of the sweet tooth needs. You have the traditional Italian delights: tiramisu, affogato, panna cotta, rum cake, panetTone bread pudding, cookie and truffles, a small array of gelato, sorbets or even a vegan tart.  

My fiance and I started with a refreshing and light dessert coffee, Iced café au lait, although we asked for an extra shot of espresso, it arrived extra milky and the espresso flavor was muted. We let our server know and he kindly replaced our drink with a re-make. We both felt it was still on the light end, but we appreciated the effort. Flavor rating: 2/5

These sweet treats spoke to me: 

The Praline chocolate affogato -Vanilla parfait, chocolate ice cream, praline tartufo, illy espresso $12 - The portion size is extremely tiny, served in a highball glass barely enough to share; and trust me you wont want to share this divine creation. The espresso is dramatically poured onto the ice-ceam ball table-side. If you have never had the pleasure to try an affogato, this is one of my favorite ways to enjoy sweet and bitter together in perfect harmony. The espresso is dark with a nice kick, plus the sweetness of the praline and creaminess of the vanilla ice-cream pair together magically. I just wish the portion size was not a tease. Flavor rating: 4/5

Peach almond pana cotta White peach jelly, fresh raspberries, almond cookie tuile $12 - Also a tiny portion served in a highball glass, you might reconsider sharing this as well. This is an extremely light palate cleanser and leaning more towards refreshing versus a sweet tooth remedy. After letting the smooth pana cotta and white peach jelly melt on your tongue for a while, you are invigorated by the tart fresh raspberries and delighted by the deliciously crisp almond cookie tuile. This delicate dessert is also a great end to the evening, but remember, it is super light and may not be a substantial craving destroyer. Flavor rating: 3/5

I would say based on our late night dessert experience, the ambiance and scene would reward a return trip back to try their cuisine on one of these witching hours.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,9,9,3,T8ueYrA5OC24zGkopfw-qg

We had worked long and hard all day on the two occasions that we visited so we wanted and needed something delicious yet reasonably priced and conveniently located within our hotel as we were dining into the later hours of the evening.  Good thing for us that Allegro is open all night until 6am!

When I originally checked reviews of this ""casual"" option within the Wynn, we were almost scared off with the amount of people that ordered ""pizza"" - we didn't necessarily want food that was uber casual and being from NYC/NJ, we certainly did not fly to Vegas for a flat-bread with high end cheese and sauce.  But guess what - it was delicious!  I didn't order it myself but on both occasions at least one of my coworkers ordered a flat-bread pizza and was extremely delighted!  On both nights I tried a slice of each and enjoyed both the meatball version as well as the Vegan with roasted veggies on top.

The first night I ordered the Amazing Fava Bean & Yellow Beet Salad to start and had the Veal Marsala for my entree.  A couple nights later I had the Arugula Salad along with the Mushroom Crusted Salmon.  I could probably eat here every night and be perfectly happy with this fresh, delicious food!  It all starts off with a beautiful bread basket and a white fava bean & garlic spread so don't miss out on trying that!!  The Banfi Chianti Classico is highly recommended but there are actually several wines on their list that are reasonably priced.

 fettuccini pasta with chicken, cauliflower and broccoli

- Eggplant parm: 3 stars - flavors were there, but the eggplant was over cooked to the point where it turned to mush.  
- Side of mushroom: 5 stars - love mushrooms and love how they had a varietal if mushrooms

Unfortunately I had to send back the pasta with meatballs dish because the pasta was so under cooked it was hard to even cut with a fork, and the meat ball tasted really strange. They were nice enough to replace it with a different dish, but just a few bites in I started feeling sick to my stomach. Was it the pasta & meatball I had sampled? Could it have been the new dish? Who knows but whatever t was it didn't want to stay down! The only problem was the bathroom was closed for cleaning.

We started out with the calamari and Caesar salad, both of which were above average.  Similar to my experience at SW, a really tasty bread basket was brought to the table.

I ordered the lasagna, but requested to hold the pine nuts, the server said that unfortunately they are inside of the lasagna and cannot be removed.  I found this kind of strange, but I understand perhaps this dish is mass produced so I lived with it.

The lasagna was good and better than what I have had at Chicago Joe's or The M, but I would expect that for $10+ more!  It uninformatively wasn't worth the price and quality that I've had at other higher end Italian restaurants.  I did pull out a few pieces of hard fat/meat which is understandable because it wasn't ground beef, but obviously isn't a highlight of the meal.

Food was in general very good, though the seafood risotto can only be summarized by the word ""undunte"" as the rice was still raw! It was terrible. That went untouched.

Granted, eating pasta at 1:00 in the morning isn't usually advisable but when in Vegas... go for it. And this pasta was indeed worth it. Cooked to a perfect al dente with rich and flavor sauces, whether the rigatoni with meatballs or the kale and ricotta ravioli, everybody enjoyed their meal. The chilled cucumber soup was a bit odd, with a lack of salt that was almost made up for by the spicy kick at the end.

The big issue was the terse and inattentive service, but I suppose that's what you get at 1am.",J45QEVlSMUFVQGH5iWf0JA,0,0,3,peBuD-aIZiL0XXcEmhfkKQ

The not so good: it's expensive? It's in the Wynn so expected. The service is not good for a higher end restaurant, it took 10 minutes to get water, 20 minutes to order. We asked for bread and it came out at the same time as our meal.

We customized a vegan pizza from the mushroom one on the menu, which was encouraged. It was mediocre at best and cold. When asked if liked it, I said it was ok and would not order it again. Our server proceeds to say well its best the way it is put on the menu with regular cheese. If I ate regular chees do you think I would have ordered soy cheese?? Think before you make ridiculous comments. 

On another note, very upset that this restaurant serves two veal (baby cow) dishes. Get with the times and quit serving babies.

However, it took forever to get attention from the waiter after he left the menus. The food didn't take long to come out after we ordered, so it wasn't the kitchen, it was solely the wait staff. 

I ordered a Caesar to start, a petit filet minion, with potatoes au gratin and asparagus as sides. Yes, I was starving. First bite into the salad and the only thing I tasted was salt. I had maybe 4 bites and put it to the side. My perfectly cooked meat was inedible with how much salt was added on. I was so saddened by this. As you might guess, this was the same story with both of the side dishes. 

The cocktails weren't anything to get excited over, and the glass my champagne came in was sticky. Gross.

I recently came over my birthday for a romantic dinner with my husband and they rolled out the red carpet for us. One of the main reasons I enjoy dining here is for their vegan chicken parmesan. As a vegetarian, I really respect Mr. Wynn for always including vegan and vegetarian options on all the menus at both Encore and Wynn. They are all delicious, well-done and thought out. To start, I ordered the eggplant parmesan, as I have always wanted to try it here. It is now, hands down, my favorite eggplant parm that I've ever had. It was amazing, flavorful, and was an entree in itself. Then, I ordered my usual vegan chicken parm. The only slight critique I have for the dish is it tasted slightly barbecued (not burnt, but more of a charcoal tast), which I know is to give it a more meaty or grilled flavor, but otherwise it was amazing. They even brought me out a small dessert to celebrate my birthday! The details in everything, from the service, to the menu, to the whole overall experience at Allegro, it is truly a class act. I don't expect anything less from Steve Wynn and his resort/restaurants. I can't wait to come back to Vegas to dine here again!

The only actual restaurant serving food was Allegro, which was initially pretty crowded but I was later able to find an open seat at the bar.  I went with the wood-fired Meatball Pizza ($21).  It comes out as a somewhat large oblong-shaped flatbread cut into eight square pieces with each square containing a small wedge of meatball.  Doubtless, it hits the spot late at night when you're jonesing for food, but I wouldn't recommend Allegro for anything beyond that purpose.  The pizza and meatball lack any distinctive taste, and a better presentation would have been to cut the meatball lengthwise and scatter throughout.

This is a classic Italian restaurant. The food was just excellent. I found it even better than Sinatra's next door, for far less money. I had the lasagna. It was as good as I have ever had it.

Service was great. We had tickets to the show, so dinner came out fast, but not rushed. Even talked to the head chef, who was a very nice guy.

If you want a nice and casual Italian meal for a descent price, I think Allegro is a great choice. It is better than many of the more famous Italian restaurants in Vegas.

I've always gotten their linguini pasta every time I'm here, it's perfectly al dente with lots of Manila clams in a white wine garlic butter sauce.  It's simple, familiar and frankly, when you're drinking in Vegas, you'll want to have a tummy full of good eats. 

Their beef carpaccio is nicely accented with capers and creme fraiche, while the bf's ribeye is so mouthwateringly desirable. 

I hate that they charge you $10 for a ""tiramisu""  but it's nothing like the real thing!  it's served in a short glass with lady fingers layered with marscapone and chocolate. I'd say, skip this and order another a digestif instead.

Their bread basket is amazing. There is this focaccia flat bread that is simply divine. The garlic spread they serve with it is outstanding.

3584182,2012-10-17,3,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"AWFUL!!!

My girl friend and I went here last night around 4am hoping for a nice, quiet dinner.  Right off the bat we were treated with disrespect from the hostess who apparently doesn't enjoy single females in her restaurant.  The place had maybe 3 tables of people and 3 people at the bar total.

After sitting, the service was slow and inattentive.  My friend tried to order a drink only to be told that the bar was probably closed but they would check on it.  They never did so she ended up ordering her own 10 minutes later.

Our food was DISGUSTING.  The salad tasted bitter and awful.  My friend liked the soup but I didn't..  the pasta was just meh.  

Some extremely drunk hotel guests sat at the table right next to us and slid their table into ours for an attempt at a 4am hookup but we tried to be nice to them.  One of them ended up getting really rude so we had to tell them to get the hell away from us.  They caused a small scene and were kicked out by security.  I do applaud our waiter for helping us out.  

While the guys were next to our table he took a sip out of my water.  I obviously wouldn't want the water after that so I told the waiter and he took it.  I ended up with no water for maybe 20 minutes until I tracked down someone else and he got me one.  We asked for ice water and never got that either.  ugh.

So, not even 5 minutes after these two guys get kicked out from the place, the hostess sits two more drunk guys at that same table.  Not even 30 seconds after sitting down the guys are asking us 1,000 questions and being loud and annoying.  The people that worked there were laughing.. I was too because I had given up on having a nice dinner at this point.

We weren't asked if we would like anything else before receiving the bill but my friend wanted more drinks so they had to go back and redo it.  Then, part of our bill was put onto the neighboring table's tab so we had to talk to those annoying guys even more

He took both of our bills back and then ours came back with one of THEIR items on it.  It finally got fixed and we tried to get out of there as quickly as possible.

3594499,2017-07-25,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"OK. So, this place upset me tremendously, from the moment we arrive. Let me explain what happened:

We arrived for our 5pm reservation, as we had an early flight, at 4:55pm. 5 minutes before they were ""officially"" open. Though, there was service in the bar, the host refused to seat us at our table for 5 minutes, while we waited for service to finish their set up. The host, did offer us a seat at the bar, but I was already thinking about where I would rather spend my money, than spend it on a place that refused to seat someone 5 minutes early. Not usually a big deal, except the early party included me, and an 84 year old guest of mine. And the tables were cleaned and set. I could see them, and pointed at the tables, to the host.  

I was truly upset about this and complaining while we went to the closest roulette table to sit down for 5 minutes, in which, we were AGAIN told to move (another story, for another time). 

Secondly, when our dining companions arrived, the host made a big show of how our dining companions, (whom had the early flight) had luggage, and weren't allowed on the dining room floor with their luggage. What the fuck? You're a mediocre restaurant in a hotel. You expect people to not have luggage in Las Vegas? One of the most heavily touristed cities in the world? In a hotel, in which people stay, and bring luggage, in and out, on a LITERALLY DAILY basis, you're going to luggage-shame us? 

I don't understand how luggage is disruptive to one's dining experience, unless you embarrass the guest's with the luggage. I don't understand how luggage might be disruptive to another guest's dining experience unless those with luggage are wholly inconsiderate and put the luggage on someone else's table. I don't how purses, backpacks and shoulder bags are any less disruptive than a couple of wheel-y bags. (If someone could please message me, and explain to me this etiquette I would greatly appreciate it. Also, will be forced to retract these last 2 paragraphs of this review.)

I was always taught that first impressions are the most important. And on 2 separate, EARLY occasions to impress a diner, they basically told us to fuck ourselves. Twice.

That being said, the ambience, food and service was fine, but I was already super pissed, and too frustrated to give the 3 other components to our meal a fair review.",awQhT121Pe0R33sukfTyuA,5,1,1,6L1oOa6icu2xk9kGobsaYQ

3972789,2015-04-20,4,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"Five of us came here for dinner and Executive Chef Enzo Febbraro came to talk to us as we perused the menu.  He asked if we wanted him to just send out dishes, put them in the center of the table, and enjoy them family style.  We agreed to that.  Some table leaves were raised so we had more room for the 5 of us with plenty of room in the middle for our dishes.

We were given bread service and instead of butter, we were served this very tasty garlic creamy spread that was very good.  

In short order, we started with the appetizers.  We got eggplant parmigiana, calamari which contained some fried peppers and tomatoes and was served with a very spicy, very good tomato sauce.  We also got a platter of mozzarella that contained burrata, stracchino, bufala mozzarella along with two kinds pf prosciutto and some Italian tomatoes.

This was shortly followed by some meatballs in tomato sauce and a focaccia pizza which had mozzarella, crème fraîche, smoked salmon, chives, and red onion.  

Moving on to the entrée type plates, we got this huge--think the size of a large round pizza--bone in veal chop parmigiana.  The menu lists it as 12 ounces, but it had to be a lot more than that.  It was huge!  We also got osso buco with pappardelle and vegetable stew.  Accompanying these two dish were a lasagna and seafood risotto.  

We ended with four desserts--tiramisu, pear ricotta tart,  pannetone bread pudding, and baba au rhum.

Standout dishes for me were the calamari and the hot tomato sauce.  There was a lot of red pepper in the sauce and it had great zing to it.  The mozzarella platter with prosciutto was another good dish.  The osso buco was good and the pappardelle and sauce from the osso buco was very tasty.  The pounded veal parmigiana was good but I'm not that big a fan of veal parmigiana.  I credit Chef Febbraro with not breading his dishes to death.  The calamari and veal were nicely breaded.  

I did not try the baba au rhum because one of my dining mates let me know it was infused heavily with rum.  The other three desserts were good with the pear ricotta tart being the best.

The amount of food we ate and the heaviness of the dishes filled us all.  It was a fine dinner with the chef sending out some of his chosen dishes.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,5,3,Ku1klpdQsZOZhhMVX7ErJw

While I can appreciate that Allegro is considered casual dining, nevertheless, I expected a classier environment.
  
My husband and I dined here on a Saturday evening around 6 pm. We had reservations, not sure if they are required or not. I was not thrilled when we were seated in the lounge area, directly next to the bar. There was a party of 6 sharing 2 stools at the bar who were obnoxiously loud. There was a 6 seated behind us that seemed unreasonably close for a restaurant of this caliber. If you are dining at Allegro with the intention of having a romantic Italian meal with your sweetheart,  you may want to request being seated away from the bar.  Or dining at another place... 

With that out of the way.. Adam was our server and he was fantastic. We had a minor snafu with our show tickets that my husband was trying to rectify while I was seated, Adam got his manager involved to assist. 

For our meals, my husband and I started out by sharing the minestrone soup. He had the potato gnocchi as his entree, and I went with one of the specials; a mushroom risotto with shrimp, which was served in a pumpkin. The chef at Allegro uses pesto in the minestrone, which I love but I don't think my husband cared really cared for. My risotto had tons of tasty, wild mushrooms and 3 large, delicious shrimp. Neither of us drank any liquor, which kept our final bill fairly reasonable, considering we were on the Strip.

With it's proximity to the Le Reve theater, reasonable on-strip pricing and late hours,  I can see why Allegro stays as busy as it does. I can see myself returning, however I will know better than to expect any kind of romantic ambiance when I do.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,1,1,3,ftzAQenoxO79qrGZkWOncQ

The fresh bread service was the best part of dinner. The Caesar salads were clearly made ahead of time and were neither crispy or tasty.  The pasta dishes were good, not great.

4171104,2014-08-28,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"Before going to the night club XS in the Wynn Hotel we had dinner at Allegro which is a nice Italian restaurant with good food and nice décor.  There were 8 of us so we decide to order family style so we could try a number of dishes.  Before any of the appetizers came out they brought a bread basket with some great baguette and a garlic butter spread.  The bread was very good but I'm not sure why a social place like Vegas always serves or cooks with so much garlic when you're constantly in people's faces.  To fix that we asked for some olive oil and the server happily brought it out.  The first few appetizers we orders were just ok and pretty average except for their bruschetta.  First was the fried calamari with marinara sauce and there was nothing new here.  The calamari was lightly battered but the squid was a bit too chewy.  I liked how spicy the marinara sauce was but I'm guessing it would be too much for the average guest.  Next was the clams casino and what I liked was they used very big chunks of clams so when mixed with the bread crumbs you could taste the seafood.  Many places will just mince up the clam meat so it gets lost in the breadcrumbs. Finally, their spin on bruschetta was excellent.  Nice crispy baguette, fresh mozzarella, ripe tomatoes and prosciutto.  This had an amazing blend of flavor and texture and it wasn't loaded with garlic!  Next was the pizza course and this is where they started to shine!  We ordered a pepperoni and one meatball pie.  Both had impressively thin crust and the sauce and cheese was very flavorful.  If there were a local pizza joint that served this type of pizza it would be jam packed every night.  Finally we did a pasta course and tried three different types.  First was the Risotto Pescatora and they did a nice job with this dish.  It had excellent flavor, nice al dente rice and the sea food was cooked perfectly.  It's real easy to overcook the seafood when preparing in a sauce and they got it spot on!  Next was the Rigatoni and meat balls and this is where I had an issue.  The Rigatoni and sauce was good but the meatballs need an overhaul.  In my experience a meat ball should be light, fluffy and easily split with a fork.  It's the breadcrumbs that help create this texture and I don't think Allegro added much.  In their defense using less bread crumbs makes a more expensive meatball!  However, it made the balls very dense and the flavor of the sauce wasn't able to penetrate the ball to give it flavor during the cooking process.  Finally, we had the rosemary and black pepper scialatielli carbonara.  This dish was very rich and flavorful and was very good.  It was actually my favorite of the pasta course but I'm glad we did family style since it might have been too rich to just eat it.  Over all we really enjoyed the restaurant, the service and the food even though I'm a little critical with some of the details.",3BZ2tPVSzsKuZiSoZSwaKA,3,0,4,KOTWjLRDvStySkAqMoGQqA

I returned because it was about 3am and there was nothing else open in the Wynn where we were staying. There were four of us.  We ordered a couple of pizzas and drinks. The service on this visit was excellent. The pizzas were average. I am not complaining about the prices because they are on par with what you would expect at the Wynn  but they are pretty high.

Service is never so great, but in past years the food has been a solid 4, so when we were looking for a place for a casual but tasty meal, I suggested Allegro. Not going to do that again.

Service was really strange. We had two waiters (didn't seem to be a shift change). The one that started our order wasn't particularly friendly but managed to take our orders for drinks and food. When i ordered the shrimp pizza he went out of his way to say it was excellent (more on that later). He then proceeded to disappear for the duration of our visit. Another waiter started serving us after we got our food, and he was friendly, but there was a period of 30 minutes where nobody visited out table (not even to refill drinks).

Oh boy the food. What a disappointment. My friend ordered the seafood risotto which was OK at best. Nothing to write home about but nothing deserving a scathing review. I ordered the shrimp pizza and it was awful. Just terrible. it had a white sauce and ricotta cheese, and one shrimp per piece. But the real trouble was that it was so very very bland and the texture was mealy and difficult. There were onions and peppers and peas on the pizza as well, but all were chopped into small, pea sized pieces which further accentuated the mealiness. I was starving after a long day working a convention and i could only eat one piece. My friend thought i was crazy - ""how could it be that bad?"" - and then he tasted it. I would have complained at this time but there was literally no way to flag down a waiter - they were all just GONE. So it became kind of a joke for us and i shared my friend's plate.

When a waiter finally came we told him how bad it was. He offered to get a manager and serve us something else but by that time i had no interest. In the kindest way possible we asserted that there was really no redeeming quality to the dish. He said it was a relatively new item on the menu, and we suggested everyone try it--because if anybody did they would know that nobody in their right mind would like this dish. Later he came back and said that he shared our opinion with the chef. Apparently the chef told him that it was ""more of a european style pizza"" to which i thought ""give me a effing break!"" 

Seriously, the nerve of the chef to defend his dish by criticizing our palates. I love all kinds of food but this dish is seriously flawed. I dare that chef to eat his own dish and come back for seconds.

A 3am, just rolled outta the club starving and need to sober up meal. For this flexibility, I have the utmost respect for Allegro. And if you must know, I had experience #2. 

So, I can't comment on your average dinner date at Allegro, but I can tell you that at 3am in the morning, if you snag a ringside seat, you can enjoy an upscale breakfast with some primo people watching and endless entertainment. Their late night menu (available from 10:30pm-6am) features 3 breakfast selections, including a lobster omelet, alongside Italian fare. This is simply brilliant because everyone wants breakfast when they're stumbling out of the club. I will say that the three eggs scrambled soft we ordered didn't come out soft. They came out as an egg brick, which I despise, but I was having a good time, so it was a minor concern. I also sampled a meatball from a fellow diner's plate, and it was one delectable ball. 

But, the real beauty of this experience for me was that it was at 3am, in a beautiful surrounding, and we were seated in a table that abutted the main Wynn walkway, so in our tipsy state, we were able to have a lively interaction with passerbys, or as they came to be known this evening ""drive by hollerin's.""

5279629,2015-04-22,2,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"Highly praised by a pair or palates that I've come to know and trust it was with four friends that I sat down at Wynn's Allegro on Saturday evening, and although the restaurant features prominently just outside Showstoppers at the crux of the Wynncore complex the food being served inside is every bit the definition of a 'treasure hidden in plain sight,' the three-course tasting billed at $60 per person proving a remarkable dining deal in a casino where lofty prices and luxurious environs almost invariably are the rule.

Dubbed as a 'casual' restaurant on resort website, but in reality a swanky sort of space with dark mahogany juxtaposing buttery red leather seats, offset by lighter tones of white woods and hints of beige, Allegro features the culinary talents of Enzo Febbraro, and with teeth cut in some of the East Coasts most classic Italian Eateries the cuisine is the heavy yet elegant sort served up by many Italian Mamas but with the sort of ingredients few would be likely to invest in, the product sourcing of a billion-dollar enterprise on full display with everything from produce to proteins flown in fresh with the same quality seen elsewhere in the resort without all the pomp or circumstance as Dean, Frank, and even Neil Diamond serenade softly overhead.

Served 'family style' at our request to the chef, leaflets raised to accommodate the quantity of food, it was with the first of two bread baskets that the meal began and eschewing olive oil or butter for a puree of legumes and garlic the creamy concoction proved a hit across the table, a second helping replenished without request, though for my part the tomato-topped pannino and pillowy focaccia was far better suited to sopping up tomato sauce from saporous, smooth meatballs or for topping with a slice of San Daniel Prosciutto and funky sheep's milk ricotta from a board of charcuterie that would have easily topped $60 by itself anywhere else on The Strip.

Continuing with antipasti, suffice it to say that kitchen's take on Wolfgang Puck's signature pizza was a masterwork of crisp crust, smoky salmon, and plenty of tang from crème fraiche while the oft overdone calamari was highly touted by the chef as 'just a little undercooked,' resultant rings and tentacles the very definition of creamy beneath crunchy without a bit of over-breading or oiliness to be found.

At this point already impressed, and surprisingly full as a result of so much bread and cheese this early on, it was after a bit of respite and conversation that round two arrived and as plethoric as the first selections had been, the pasta and secondi were absolutely gargantuan, a ""12oz"" pounded veal Parmigiana undoubtedly under-billed and easily sixteen inches in diameter while lamb osso buco was fatty and rich, literally falling from the bone into ribbons of house pappardelle slicked by a smoky vegetal stew.

No less impressed by tender risotto, cooked in octopus stock with at least a pound of mixed shellfish kicking up the flavors of the sea to a significant extent, it was finally with an unbreaded approximation of Eggplant Parmigiana and Shortrib lasagna that savories would conclude, the former essentially reinventing a classic into something light and creamy beneath the caramelized cheese while the later was substantially more decadent, the layers of pasta barely able to keep up with all the mozzarella and meat as ground pinenuts came through as a basenote at the end.

Upcharged on espresso, a double over ice billed at a steep six dollars, it was again after a much needed delay that desserts would arrive and although far less substantial in portion than the plates preceding the pastry staff proved no less skilled than the luminescent and bustling savory kitchen, the tiramisu a bit run of the mill while bread pudding and a caramelized pear crostata were texturally complex and well balanced in sweetness, the baba felt a bit too boozy for some, but an absolute reference standard of the Italian variety to those familiar - a dessert worth seeking out in a city where sugar-steeped versions are far more easily found.

Priced on the level of similar Strip-Side eateries like those at The Venetian, but turning out the sort of cuisine that takes 'red sauce' to a rarified heights, it is truly a shame that Allegro is relegated to second tier status by the reign of celebrity chefs, because as much respect as those folks may deserve for their pasts I'd be hard pressed to name anyone on Las Vegas Boulevard save for the team at Portofino putting more passion into Italian Cuisine at this moment, the Mirage space a bit more 'formal' while the later feels like the sort of cooking passed from generation to generation in a grand Italian home.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,6,4,HcyWedVXvWD4CGSchYkdEA

Good thing the bartender was extremely nice and you could tell she enjoyed her job. We ordered the ravioli as an appetizer and we both ordered two different pastas and they were actually good. I wasn't a fan of the bread basket but I really did enjoy the pastas. Overall, I did like this place especially if you don't want to spend too much.

Last time I ordered the pasta with faux chicken. I enjoyed that. It was filling and tasty. I little heavy sitting in the belly. Priced at $31 dollars for one decent option is ok.

Then comes Davide, this wonderful and courteous waiter, who did his best by asking everyone if there's anything to cover my sister, he wasn't going to give up, and that's when the man in suit realized he needed to do something, thus, he FINALLY brought us a t-shirt that he had at the back.

5401503,2017-03-26,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"We came here for dinner last night as we were going to a show. It is Italian American and the best part of the night was the service. Our server, Sean, was just awesome. He was friendly and helpful and always on point. So, why only four stars? Note that the service gets five stars, and the majority of the food gets about 3 1/2 stars, so it averages to four stars. Here is why: we started off with appetizers and I ordered the mozzarella appetizer,  which came with four different types of mozzarella at $29 and we paid an extra six dollars for roasted bell peppers and another extra six dollars for olives to come with it. It was very yummy, but we thought very expensive for what we got. The kids both ordered a Caesar salad which looked good and was good.
For entrees, one of the options was a pork with porcini mushrooms special for that night. It was roughly $39 per plate. It was not very good. I was surprised that that was considered a special for the night and would never order it again. What is nice is that one of the young kids at our table simply wanted pasta with chicken and they were able to accommodate easily for this, which I thought was great.
Dessert is where this place shines: I had the vegan coconut tapioca with fruit and it was absolutely delicious. My friend ordered the cannolis and they were impressive. The tiramisu was also delicious. Dessert was a simple homerun.
My friend and I both ordered a The Dream cocktail composed of fine champagne, St. Germain liquor, and hibiscus. Delicious! On the expensive side as $22 for small/average champagne flute serving, yet very good.
To start, the bread basket that comes with the meal is incredible. It has amazing fresh bread with lovely spices, focaccia, and incredible Italian wafers/crackers.
The ambience is nice and the seats are comfortable. It is a great location if you're going to see Le Reve as the walk is not even 10 seconds from the theater.
It is on the moderate to expensive side, so if you are on a budget, be careful. My best suggestion is to stick to the pasta for your entrée if you want a for sure phenomenal meal. They kids order pastas and they were all wonderful. We were less impressed with our meat dishes.
We will definitely be coming back, but our orders will be different next time in terms of entrées.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,0,0,4,DaTbQm8qkMGpF7CisHEzMQ

We sat at a long table where half of us could see the waterfall ""show"" and half could not. I was one of the unfortunate few who saw part of this show which seemed like it was pretty cool if I got full view of it but I didn't. Plus while we were there they repeated the same show once, maybe we took too long to eat... but it was only 2 hours. It was a pretty psychadelic show that would have been FANTASTIC on mushrooms. So that may be a suggestion, but they don't sell that kind at the restaurant unfortunately.

The food was pretty solid though, most of the table ordered the Prime Rib which was kind of their signature dish but I ordered the filet. I asked for rare plus but got medium rare closer to the medium side. Not a huge deal but annoying. The steak was tasty but not the greatest steak I've ever had before. It passed. What was amazing was the side dishes. I had the whipped potatoes and crab cake mac and cheese both of which were super good.

I've been to most of the restaurants in the Wynn, and the hotel remains my favorite place to stay on the strip and USUALLY my favorite place for fine dining. My parents accompanied me on this trip to celebrate my mothers birthday, and since they love Italian food I figured we would try Allegro. Upon requesting a table, Joel the manager all but ignored me. I figured he just hadn't heard what I was saying, so I spoke louder. Without even looking in my direction, he waved me away like I was some sort of peasant. My mother seemed upset but a hostess soon apologized and seated us. By the look on her face, I got the impression she has to apologize for her boss quite often. 
My mother orders the Margherita pizza. The waitress brings her a pepperoni pizza. I tried to send it back as my mother is a lifetime vegetarian (for religious reasons). The waitress is about to take the plate away as Joel comes up and asks us what the problem is. I explain that there must have been a mix up, as my mother is a vegetarian. I could not believe his response. ""Take it or leave it, we're very busy tonight."" Then walks away. No replacement, no apology. We had to pick the peperonis off her pizza. The meal ended with my mother in tears and her birthday ruined. 
If the owners of the restaurant are reading this, please fire this manager. He is a disgrace to the Wynn and has no business being around people, let alone in the hospitality industry.

       Chef Enzo Febbraro creates classic Italian-American dishes from Italy's freshest ingredients at Allegro at Wynn. Allegro's casual atmosphere is perfect for a pre-show meal or late night supper, open until 6 AM, yes you read it right. So perfect for post clubbing right.

     Well it was CES 2014 trip,so no late night out was allowed, but we managed to come here a few times for late night snacks. 

     Love the red decor, the pasta-like chandelier from the ceiling, such a beautiful space, warm and inviting, surprisingly gorgeous for a casual resto here at Wynn. 

- MEATBALL SLIDERS * Housemade Meatballs, Baked Brioche Bread, Served with French Fries - the bomb, love it.

- MARGHERITA * Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Basil,  it was so thin crust, the cheese was melting nicely, it was so good.

- CALAMARI * Fried Calamari, Italian Green Fried Peppers, Spicy Tomato Sauce - this  sauce is so addictive, this is  1 of the signature and we  LOVE IT.

- PARMESAN POLENTA * Creamy Corn Polenta, Italian Sausage, Parmesan Cheese - this was so creamy, buttery, melt in your mouth goodness, the sausage was delish and I can't describe how perfect this dish was at the late night hour, after CES 2014, after you lost a few hands + 10 at the tables, this just hits the spot.

- BAKED LASAGNA NAPOLETANA* * Sunday Meat Ragu Sauce, Meatballs, Smoked Mozzarella, Pine Nuts - chef Enzo Febbraro's signature dish... Now this is why I work out and run :-) it's totally worth it, PLEASE order this dish.

       Allegro also offers many dishes for vegan and vegetarian, it's such a great spot for quick bite, quality food, relatively cheaper than all the restaurants here at Wynn and Encore, open till 6 AM. Jackpot! 

       The wine list by the glass was surprisingly reasonable, old and new world.         We were at the bar and our bartender was KAOU, she's from Hawaii. She was so awesome and gracious with our louder than life group, OK, just me with my big lung :-) 

       Chef Enzo Febbraro was in and out of the kitchen greeting his diners. He's so personable, kind, and has the biggest smile and hug. He was lovely enough to explain to us about his food and ingredients, made our visits were much more enjoyable. My team loved every visit here.

This is actually a great spot to people watch and late night always proves to be quite the spectacle lol. The cool thing about allegro is they have a full menu offering all the way until the 5-6am. Meaning, you can stumble off the craps table or out of XS  and still grab a gourmet meal, that is much better then the run of the mill egg options usually offered at late night eateries. This comes at a cost, be prepared to spend a pretty penny. But so worth it!",w0Yyvns5BCIL5s_7JuFrug,0,0,4,4vlC5H9ze1BeL1Vro1rYlQ

They have finer foods, but by far I keep coming back for their chicken wings. I of course get them to-go so I can get messy with the wings by myself.  

Probably the best wings I've had, anywhere. Why? I can't tell you, they just are. Flavor, texture, freshness, it's all perfect.  The downside, wings aren't available until 3am unless you pay extra (to equal a dinner entree price).",1kkQtcFWAk1jQGixPVJ4xA,0,0,4,KO1fcThF-ljBX6YbLpdzGw
5697771,2014-11-05,0,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"After a long night of partying at XS and seeing my favorite DJ ever (Zedd), we popped in Allegro for some pizza. I guess this is the place to be after partying at XS because the Wynn/Encore does not have too many late night food options. This is probably the equivalent of Secret Pizza at Cosmo, except a lot more expensive and much more formal.

Between a group of 7, we shared the Bianca and Foccacia pizzas. The pizzas came in 8 square slices and was plenty of food to share. I really liked both pizzas, but they were definitely more like flatbread than pizza.

We also shared the Calamari and Baked clams, but nothing notable to say about those two. 

One of the things about this place is how slow everything is. Took a good 10-15 minutes before anyone came to take our order. 

Because there are so many great restaurants at the Wynn, I probably won't be coming back to this one.",n19tYG7tHbX6rHhAjJ8PPA,1,0,3,awG3qqqZ_pDJa0PdW84Njg

We were seated upon arrival even without reservations, maybe my date had 'secret powers' to get us in so swiftly! Very impressed with the decor and ambiance. The only drawbacks for me are: 1. Super loud atmosphere 2. Tables are not intimate enough for a normal conversation because we were so far apart(they can pack a lot of guests in at one time thats for sure).

The food and service were excellent. Im in love with both pizzas we ordered. The Margherita and the Bosco Mushroom pizza were mouth watering! I did enjoy our appetizer of Calamari as it had jalapenos and red peppers mixed in to give it a spiciness. Most Delicious!

We ordered a greyhound and a beer, we got the bread basket which was filled with goodies, not basic stuff but interesting stuff that will make you like bread again.  

Got the Carpaccio, was excellent.  Then we added the Caesar Salad.  We followed that up with the Lobster Mac N Cheese, and the Carbonara.  Both were excellent.  We were not worrying about the calories or anything as usual...these dishes were all decadent, to say the least.  We took most of the pasta away in boxes, we could barely eat any of it after the bread, salad and Carpaccio.  It was still good the next day!  Thanks fully we brought an ice chest since you can't use the refrigerators at the Wynn for anything other than their own mini bar stuff.  

We actually sat at the bar on Friday of our stay as well, and had the Clams Casino, and the Calamari.  I think we went in because there was a Happy Hour?  I honestly can't remember, we were obviously drinking.  I have no idea what we spent or if it was a good deal.  But that goes to show, we had a good time!

What we got:
Beef carpaccio: okay,
Butternut squash soup with crab: okay
Bianca pizza: this was pretty good, the only thing. 
Calamari: not good considering level of quality we were expecting, rubbery. The spicy sauce was spaghetti sauce with red pepper flakes.  
Frisée salad: way too expensive for what it is, we didn't eat it 
Baked clams: my bf chipped his filling because there were some hard little pieces in 2 of the clams. 

I wish it was better. Maybe we didn't order the right things, just wanted to try a bunch of dishes. Service was great but can't give it higher than a 3 for a place we wouldn't return to unless it was for pizza after a club night.

5837961,2018-03-03,5,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"After seeing a color photo of Baked Lasagna Napoletana in a local magazine, I just had to try it.  So off to Allegro I went with Diane and a game friend.  We opened with Fried Calamari with Cherry Peppers and Spicy Tomato Sauce, and received a requested Citrus Aioli to further supplement this well-constructed and tasty app.  At the same time I enjoyed excellent Housemade Meatballs finished off with Burata Cream.  

For me, a bowl of Minestrone Soup was next up.  This classic Italian dish, prepared with roasted vegetables, Tubetti Pasta, and a touch of Basil Pine Nut Pesto, contained flavorful broth but it was not that well integrated with the vegetables.  A Caesar Salad with thin sheets of Mozzarella and requested anchovies boasted a Creamy Garlic Dressing, and was a nice prelude to the main course.

The quite generous portion of colorful Baked Lasagna Napoletana was as good as it looked, sporting excellent Sunday Meat Ragu Sauce, along with meatballs, pork, Smoked Mozzarella, and pine nuts.  Although Diane asked for Penne Alfredo to complement her Chicken Parmigiana Alfredo, she received Fettuccine Alfredo instead.  Both tasted fine, and she decided not to broach the issue any further.  Otherwise service and the work in the kitchen were very good.  

A Trio of Gelati--Vanilla, Pistachio, and Chocolate--furnished a suitable ending to a memorable repast.   4-1/2 stars overall on this initial outing!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,9,6,4,tnU_c93P1uL4Kr4T7iz-VA

5841558,2017-08-31,2,4KmrrhtfnngTVFa2d5LAjg,"I had two words repeating in my head after my dining experience here: disappointed and expensive. I have looked at some of the reviews, and I am thinking my experience was partly due to menu choice, but a good experience should not depend heavily on menu choice. 

I ordered the bianca pizza, which according to the description has mozzarella, arugula, prosciutto, and shaved Parmesan. First of all, the word ""pizza"" has a certain connotation. I expect at least a thin layer of dough that is not the texture of a cracker (that texture I associate with ""flatbread""). Second, the description of the ingredients was not wrong, but they each had a problem: 1) The mozzarella was difficult to find 2) The prosciutto had a fishy flavor and reminded me of smoked fish 3) The arugula was overwhelming and excessive 4) The Parmesan was shaved on top without the benefit of heat, so it was falling off the pizza with every bite. Third, I was expecting some seasoning: salt, pepper, basil, oregano, balsamic drizzle, olive oil drizzle, etc. 

My impression was that I paid $21 for a dry and bland cracker loaded with a dressing-less arugula salad. I guess that's Vegas - you win some, you lose some.",Joc84PIqf70m-dCFhWM0XQ,6,2,2,4SCsYZ2kMcxECWcSxJZ7sg
