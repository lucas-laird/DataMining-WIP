The reason I say this is because I had Asian and Chinese cuisine and I have not found one that I really loved. Until I had teriyaki brother is one day. The food taste amazing especially the salmon. I haven't had anything that I did not like. One thing I would say is I am obsessed with the Macha tea. I always get one when I go. Everyone there is very friendly. It's a small restaurant but the food is really good. I also tried the almond ice and the orange ice which was really good. I would recommend anyone who wants a good cuisine to come i'm here.

Back to back with this place. First night we ordered the teriyaki with veggies and the beef with mushroom. Boy this is he exact teriyaki flavor I was looking for. Brings me back to the sarku days at queens center mall. 

Day two we came in for the sesame and general tsao chicken. They delivered in flavor and there were plenty of sauce you can roll over into the rice. 

Pretty decent size menu, you have our tempuras, teriyaki and bubble tea too!  

Service is unbeatable and they also offer a reward system. A stamp card is you may, buy any 6 meals and you can pick up a teriyaki chicken for FREE!

Teriyaki Chicken - Bland and flavorless
Teriyaki Beef - Tough, leathery, and very oddly seasoned. Not teriyaki at all (or even edible)

I love me some teriyaki but I find I'm very picky on the sauce itself.  I like sweet but not sickly sweet, and I kinda like my sauce on the thicker side & not too thin.  Can't be too salty either.  Wow, Teriyaki Brother nicely fits the bill!

Pretty much still a newer place in town to eat, I can say I'm a fan!  Kinda a no frills type place but no matter to me.  They actually do really good in their take-out operations.  We went for their grand opening special - Chicken Teriyaki plate for only $4.99!  What a great deal!  Even better was the portion size, lots of chicken & lots of rice!  Take it home and add your own veggies!  Seriously, for the price the Chicken Teriyaki plate fed 2 of us easily.

We also ordered their Beef & Shrimp Teriyaki plate with yakisoba for $8.98 ($7.99 + $0.99 for yakisoba upgrade) - also very good!  HUGE portion!

Tasty food, the sauce was just right and pretty flavorful.  The meats were cooked well but not overcooked, and even the shrimp were of decent size!  Definitely a great meal for a great value!  They even offer boba drinks which we didn't try this time around but maybe next time.  Owner was pretty nice too, told us some of his favorites on the menu and if we wanted extra sauce on the side too, no charge.  Teriyaki Brother is now our go to for cheap & delicious teriyaki!  I don't even care if the place is in the ghetto!!

There was also chunks of the part of the chicken that is rubbery, gristle maybe. The serving size was large, and I ate less than half & tossed the rest. We had ordered a teriyaki plate to go for a coworker, and she said hers was just as bad as mine. I felt so bad at my choice of lunch that I offered to treat my coworker next time we went for lunch. 

When I saw the great score on Eat24, I thought it was a different Teriyaki Brothers. So I came into Yelp to discover that there's only the one. Well, despite the great reviews on here, I do not have the desire to go back.",xQMe_pYu6yfZdeCaF5cHzA,0,0,2,K2_EX8oF3b7mt-I4X4ng_Q

I was not disappointed!  Also tried the Crab Rangoon which were also amazing and very fresh!  Highly recommend this place a must try!,oHxEe4XXAkLMWjlKXLUxLg,0,0,5,qGQz4QittKmRMsaLa0nhEA
