Fresh, delicious and generous servings of everything included in the 12 oz bowls we built. Yes, it's a bit pricier than another new poke spot we tried recently, but I don't mind paying a little extra for awesome sized servings. These were MEALS. I had the lighter mixed greens as a base and my husband had rice, and he brought home leftovers. Friendly staff and a clean, ""Green"" atmosphere... perfect!

The ingredients couldn't be fresher, every bowl is utterly delicious, and I'm not mad at the fact that it's also healthy for me ;)

Well, it checked all three boxes as it was soooo damn good. There were loads of choices for ingredients. Anyone can find a cool mix that will suit your tastebuds.

The service was fast, yet they took the time to explain all the additions b/c I didn't know anything abt poke. Their suggestions compliment the fish and helped me build an awesome bowl.

Not at SoulFish.

I'd literally eat here for lunch and dinner as often as possible.

I'm dedicating a portion of my life to eating healthy and just taking better care of my body over all and it is so challenging to find healthy food that is delicious. Not anymore!

The salmon was cut soooooo thick I could barely chew it.  No gluten free dressing options made for a super sad bowl.  Really pricey for what you get.   Be aware, the crab is imitation crab!

First of this is a nice clean designed and simple looking place, it feels welcoming, open and inviting walking in there.

The menu is simple and refreshing, and the food was the same, the bowls are put together from some standard options in a like built your own style and it works, i like every bit of it. The price point is there, not to cheap and not to expensive, good lunch value.

The staff was super friendly and overall i would definitely recommend giving this a try.",oGiQ7ZXInvgrZ0nKpGZdLA,1,1,5,5XY1rcLpFiRNfR1wBHbsCg

First off, I love the decor very clean beautiful colors compliment the wood framing in the entire restaurant.  The kitchen behind looked very clean and already well kept. 

Second, the workers were great. Asked how are day was going, asked about our job, & lastly he made me his favorite poke bowl.  I love when employees are engaging and know what they like.  

Last, the food was extremely good.  I loved the poke bowl I had with rice noodles, spicy tuna w/ sriracha mayo, seaweed salad, tempura crunch.  It couldn't have been more flavorful and everything went so well together.

You can get 3 scoops of different kinds of protein at other places for the same price. However, the flavor was on point and so was the service.

5918961,2016-10-06,2,sV_8f7ChS4m8LxbQo4Nmdg,"This is the second Soulfish Poké location I have visited in the past 24 hours. Today just happened to be their official grand opening, and just like the other location on Durango, it is not busy at night until I was about to finish my food (at 7:25pm). I practically have the entire restaurant to my self (the illusion is complete since the only customer is seated behind me all the way in the back, but he might be a reporter there to speak to the owner).

Service was plain, being a new place with new employees that are still learning the menu and the ropes, it is what it is. Pretty sure in a week he will be brimming with knowledge and personality just like Matt).  The owner(?) Edwin R was friendly bough to ask if I wanted something to drink, which I politely declined. I drank a lot of tea all day.

Anyway, love their decor. The artist they pick to work on the art incorporated into all of their locations did a great job.

There are plenty of seats and tables, but maybe during the lunch rush the situation will be different.  Parking lot is small, and not many open spots considering the neighbors in the same plaza.

Tonight I tried a large Zen (Salmon based Poké bowl) made with Edamame, a lot of Jalapeño, Green Onion, Orange Segments, and Orange Citrus Yuzu Sauce on a base of Rice Noodles. It was just alright, I barely tasted the Orange Citrus Yuhi Sauce, and overall it tasted dry. It is caused by a combination of not adding enough sauce and me ordering the Rice Noodle base, so the experience fell short of the amazing one I had last night.  (But being the official  day 1 of operation, I am not going to be too harsh but actually a bit more generous about my rating.)

Just keep in mind if Rice Noodle is selected as the base, ask the staff to be more generous with the sauce, since it can definitely absorb a lot of the sauce leaving the overall Poké bowl tasting bland and dry.

What's good? Fresh ingredients, order made pretty fast and it is healthy.

I will drop by again in a few days to check out their Buddha Bowl and Sutra (I am going to pass on the tofu-based Dharma, which will cater to the vegetarians possibly vegans amongst us).

Okay. Back to finishing my Poké bowl which is surprisingly filling, a compliment to the portion size considering I normally orders two entrees just for me).",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,9,11,4,FuTLIZLIv7GItWDuM_V9gg
