I got bombarded at the front door for ID, keep in mind I'm 25, so my ID is horizontal but the guy still insisted I take it out of my wallet. The person at the front did not know how to work their merchant operating system. My card wasn't working so she told me she couldn't use it. I had to prompt her to enter it manually, I thought that would be common since. I had a party of 8 but was told I could not put tables together. Eight people at 13$ entry that's 104$ and you couldn't but tables together? Ridiculous. Overall they had terrible customer service, and seemed not to appreciate my business, so they have lost it. It's no wonder they went under before, with this service it guaranteed to happen again.",yv_7U8JNb5lAa54LmKCnEQ,4,0,1,HwEKqifBFfadlIRje5Od-A

I remember visiting a few times before they moved locations and it was good but now they're even better. Hookah is great; $12-$20. Drinks are just as good! Especially on Thursdays . I haven't tried the food but it smells amazing! 

I like the fact that, they know when they're getting at capacity and put a hold on letting people in. It's always a good time.

One thing I have to put a little damper on is one bartender/waitress. She never looks friendly and seems like she always has an attitude. Put a smile on, you'll feel a lot better.

I use to come here when it was al maza, that place was amazing and so sad they closed. Sitara truly is a crappy hookah lounge. The customer service was great besides having to wait forever for hookah and not having half of the stuff they offered on the menu. Then when we did place our order for food it took half an hour for them to clean the utensils so we could get our food. Then our hookah only lasted for about 10 minutes then hit harsh every time. The hoses were plastic which I have never seen anywhere around the world and I have been to many hookah lounges and I am from the Middle East. When we walked in the place was dead, the girl at the front said it would pick up around 10 when the dj started spinning. We where there until 1130 when the dj started spinning and the place was still half full on an ""event"" night. So sad that we spend more then 50 dollars and left totally unsatisfied.

Except for the service. Hookah wasn't hitting right and had to call 3 different people over instead of them checking on us. Towards the end of the night I ordered one more bowl and I asked a gentleman where it was and he said let me get your waitress. She never came. He walked by me again and I told him tell her to cancel my order it has been over 30 min and I still haven't received what I ordered. I walked up to the hookah bar and finally my waitress came.

2288683,2015-04-23,0,WXzA4jW-E2UtaFd3v86Xfw,"This place was so ridiculous period... First off we brought 5 people to this place, mind you that is $65. We sat down and the music was great and we were brought out our hookah relatively fast when we asked the woman at the front desk for another hookah considering we all payed $65 for ONE HOOKAH (5 people to 1 hookah isn't a good time), thinking we would be able to get another one without hassle...NOPE... She said we had to have 6 people total (which would be $78 for 2 hookahs) to get another hookah. I was astounded when she told us "" I would give you another one no problem but it's a very busy night"" as we sat there with at least 30 hookahs not being used... So as the night went on we could do nothing but deal with it. As we called the hostess over to tell her the bowl was terrible we had wanted a new bowl she told us we weren't aloud to get a new one until the coals were out, and insisted she only will make an exception if it was harsh to her.(Last time I checked I was the customer and the harshness of the bowl is preference on how much you smoke). So we all got up and left with a very bad taste in our mouth literally...All I could do on the way home is dwell on how much we spent for one very horrible bowl.

So we got there it was good they only changed our bowl once. This girl came took our order so we excited so we waited 20 mins passed my coworkers started leaving so I had to physical get up and chase the girl to be like hey where are our new bowls she was like there's coming. 50 mins go passed I found this other server guy to be like hey my group leaving we've been waiting almost an hour to get our new bowls he was ill go get them. That's when I got pissed. The girl was prancing around like it wasn't her job to make sure that everyone was satisfied. She went to the table that had all guys asked them if they were okay fixed there hookah, flipped there coals, and got new bowls. Like I was so livid. But after an hour an 40 mins we got new bowls. My whole group left so it was just me and my best friend but when we go our hookah it was harsh and disgusting. They only cater to the 21 and over.

Sun-tues by bowl but its more laid back and you can watch football games which is awesome and music isnt too loud.

Thursday - Saturday are pretty poppin musics loud usually tons of people good if your tryin to dance and turn up.

Food is A+ their zookies are delicious,  loved the buffalo sliders. And even the fried gouda mac n cheese bites are bomb. Only problem is food takes alittle while to come out depending in what you get but its totally worth it!

2. There is plenty of parking.
3. It is super easy to find.

5867932,2014-06-12,0,WXzA4jW-E2UtaFd3v86Xfw,"Okay so I have been to myriads of hookah lounges, and this one is just not what I expected. I have been here three times and it's kind of the same every time. SADLY, the cons weigh over the pros by far. 

THE PROS: The inside is very nice and modern with colored lights and a Dj booth. They have a dance floor which is always fun. They have local DJs play and that is always nice as well. The music itself ranges from rap to EDM. 

They offer food also ( I haven't tried anything so I can't comment on the restaurant aspect of this business). They have very keen security, so you will feel safe and not like you're in a ghetto hookah lounge to get shot or mugged in. They check ID immediately so you know they are serious and not trying to just get money from minors.

Another plus, it is always clean and well kept from what I have seen so far. They are always very courteous and say welcome as they have a door man open the door for you. The staff is never rude, but they are very firm. There is no horse play in this lounge for sure.


THE CONS: I have come here to meet with a large party one time, and only to find that their seating is WHACK. You cannot merge a 4 top table with another table, you cannot move chairs to seat more people at the 4 top table, and do not try to even justify it because you are wasting your breath. It is supposedly a safety/fire hazard. So with a large party, you have to sit awkwardly with someone in the middle gap of the two tables and try to have a good time from an uncomfortable distance. 

On top of this awkwardness, the tables are high like a restaurant normally would have. This means these two feet tall hookahs are literally sitting there like annoying table centerpieces that you have to keep looking around just to talk to your friends. 

Their customer service is very strange and rushed. For example: They will take your refill bowl order and, I kid you not, they will come back and ask if you want another bowl (very irritating and makes the servers look foolish, especially if ALL of them are doing that like my experiences). They always are switching your waiter it seems or they can't keep track of their tables. This one guy took my order for a water($1.50), and an entire hour passed until I finally told my original waitress. THEY WERE NOT EVEN THAT BUSY! They have always been completely understaffed for the Friday and Saturday evenings (10p-12a) I have gone and the waiters act like they can't remember their own names. It takes about 20 -30 min average to get your hookah from the time you order AND they don't even milk the hookah for you.

That leads me to the true reason you would go to a hookah lounge: the hookah quality. Out of the ten or twelve hookah bowls I have had here, only three hit really nicely. I know some flavors hit better than others, but I mean I have had a cigarette hit better than those hookahs. The specialty house flavors(not just basic, single flavors but these are mixed with two or more) are nothing to brag about. I like the Spiced Chai and the Shooting Star best. Even if you ask for help to get it going, the waiters will take a fat inhale and act like it is fine, then you get it back thinking it's better, and nothing has changed. 

The DJs are either ON or wayyyy OFF. It is either whack, random mixes, or some good quality bangers/hits. The dancing is pretty ratchet, it is usually just a couple of people who are going crazy with twerking or yiking or some other wild, fun moves. 

OVERALL:
I don't mind this hookah lounge. It isn't obnoxious and it is a safe, fun environment.  From the hookah lounges I have come from though, this is low grade for sure. They may have put in good money into the appearance, but the service is so poor. 
For the future customers: 
          try all the flavors you can, it is $13 all you can smoke
          don't bring a large party bigger than 4 unless you can figure something out                               with the management
          be a patient person and expect to wait quite awhile, even if it seems not so crowded

For the business (this is NOT to be rude, it is just things I feel might help get more positive feedback): 
          please try to staff for busier nights
          please try to fix the seating issue, it's like the second biggest problem
          please get creative and start making a larger menu
          please try to help enhance your waiters' performance by emphasizing organization and communication skills
          please try to maybe have the waiters milk the hookahs for customers, it is just annoying
          please make customer service NUMBER 1 always, that is the biggest problem

Thank You and I hope my review helped at least one of you readers :)",IlEOrIbda1urqs5L6NrlTg,1,0,2,3lLKEYYbz9zADiwDxkHX5w
