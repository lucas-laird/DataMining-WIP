I know I shouldn't be expecting much or be hopeful when eatin at a food court! But at least the Seafood City Super Market down the street has a much better selections n variety! They got Jolliebee, Chow King, Filipino BBQ, Red Ribbon, Halo Halo n more. I feel satisfy n happy when eatin there while doin my grocery shoppin at the same time!  But Asian One doesn't cut it for me! I already ate there a few times to see if things improve. Each time just got worse. Even my own cookin has more flavor! And I m a bad cook! Also they substitutes parsley for mint leaves. That is a total travesty n insult to Vietnamese food rule!",o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,0,0,3,3p-t2tKtzEm8dXR4mwttIA

I asked how much extra, she replied, its two dollars! First of, rarely have i been to a noodle place charges extra for soup. Secondly, if its a store policy, at least be polite and tell customer how much extra when you said you charge extra for soup instead of waiting for them to ask. If you cant be flexible, dont be in hospitality industry. You will have a lot of hard times!",_5EP3FaDXu0KE9MWDllU5A,0,0,1,nEErlzPM11gmYuKQihH0sw

Oh~ egg roll was sooooo good. Its more crispy than other place.

; #2, The food is bland, I had the Pho Dac Biet the soup was greasy, it supposed to come with beef balls, tripe, tendon and rare sliced beef. All I got was a lot of rare beef, half a meat ball, one tendon and one little, itsy bitsy, strip of tripe that I hunted for. The Pho has no flavor. I am from Colorado and if this place came to Denver it would not last a week.",EFjryvlvcnfHcLTKAOiWSw,0,0,1,iLRDsLwt3g57SBoYVeuMnQ

Service isn't excellent. Food is average.",eKivq_BI9l1DUo_bjD7NEw,1,0,3,x1-GSJUdsolYPhIkXuPD6Q

But repeating my order back to me only to get it wrong, (spicy basil chicken became basil tofu) is just frustrating. I will not be coming back.",RLlMRWRMe99uIBGHdMJGWw,0,0,1,Y85591PKB6J6zw1UX-9gjg

Just one thing, more human sauce and hot sauce. Broth could be stronger. I'm very happy thought  will order again.",zSUo1fT1pO_kHfVf4scBsw,0,0,4,Tyo7-BD3nlH5EjL94QAzMA

Had the:

Porkchop & rice = good
Crispy egg rolls =  good
Summer rolls = bomb! 
The fish sauce was very good. 
Service was friendly.

Can't wait to try out their pho and some other plates off their menu.",xZDovqMdVGNOmjKK83VbUw,1,1,4,-U-ungWh6JsOyKZLyCrHNA

I like my food to be well seasoned and flavorful, I find it a little on the bland side but it was still good.

Prices couldn't be better at $3.95 for sandwiches and $6.50 for soups. Employees are always smiling and friendly.",k1FxBPNVosnWJHttRNdvPQ,0,0,5,uKIsVvsY8Sjo5YUl4veCOA
5448491,2016-01-26,2,rJPIzQ_vfrNtZ5duPoksyg,"I was so looking forward to eating a noodle bowl, but, its started out by us standing under the ""order here"" sign and being ignored for a few minutes (it was just us two,  other customers around),  then we finally get waved over to order on the other side under the ""pick up here sign""; this would confuse any patron!  Very slow service. Then, I wanted a grilled shrimp rice noodle bowl, but they would only put shrimp in Pho, so I settled for chicken - not flexible on simole special requests, you have to order what's on the menu.  Our hot tea was given to us with loose tea leaves and no strainer,  I could not drink without tea leaves and sticks getting sucked up with every sip - who does that! Sip, spit,sip,spit...
I ordered the Bun GA Nuong, I didn't like the taste of the chicken,  so I ate only the noodles which you really can't go wrong. 
I'm from Denver and this place wouldn't be able to compete with the Vietnamese restaurants there. This is my first 2 star rating,  I am not a very picky eater and very optimistic with my ratings but, this time around, I was very disappointed.",KsctQRk0lYc1HUTOyL9l2Q,0,0,2,3-anh2Q2G3kMhZ77HdwVVg
