Saturday morning my mother had a stroke... i had been visitinging her all day saturday...and all day sunday... i had just left the hospital...and wanted to relax at my favorite Dotty's.... i wanted a cocktail... i had been thinking of how good it would taste... I rarely drink at Dotty's... maybe one or two cocktails a week... my normal drink there is Coke out of a can....

I entered the store about 1215 am.... and behold the wrath of god cometh.... I sat down at my favorite machine there...and put my first $20 bill in.... aobut 15 min later... the gentlemen bartender finally starts making rounds.... he asked the lady sitting next to me for her drink order...an totally ignored me... about ten minutes later...he was walking down the isle...so i said... Jack and coke... he stopped in his tracts and wanted to know who had said that.. i raised my hand.... he came over and said no...you can not have a jack and coke... u are only playing 40 cents.... i immediately stood up and told him that i had allready put $60 in the machine....and that I was playing 45 cents... he argued with me...and said 40 cents... People...it turns out that this guy can not do math... 9 times 5 is 45 cents...not 40 cents.... i told him that i had allready put 60$ in the machine...his statemewnt to me... was... I didn't see you do it.... so...he called me a liar... i was now getting livid.... just then...a regular came up to him and told him that I was a regular there... He said he didn't care.... and then went on about how I was trying to get a free 3$ drink...

Now...I spend 200 to 300 a day at Dottys... this can be verified by any other employee there.... which whom i always tip...and take care of them all...that is when i am winning.... 

he said he would bring me one drink...and one drink only....about ten minutes had passed....and i shouted to him...hey buddy...you can have your jack and coke...he quickly responded.... I wasn't going to give it to you anyways.... which im sure that everyone heard... Now I was really livid....i did all I could do to compose myself.... I used no bad language... I did not want to deal with this guy again... so... i grabbed my cash out ticket...and walked out the door.... I went to Joanies Jackpot on sahara... i couldn't concentrate...thus...I lost 200$ about an hour and a half later... i took my cash out ticket back to the store...i rang the buzzer... he was cleaning a table... he totally ignored me...i rang it again...and he waived me off,,,, at this time..i held up my cash out ticket....and he was grinning ear to ear...as if was experiencing pleasure in doing what he did....

It is my intention right now never to frequent that chain again...as long as he is in their employee..... he is very rude.... it is also my immediate intention to retain legal help. its pretty bad.... when you spend so much money in a place...and they treat you sub human... not even acknowledging me.....",xqphvpFaK2TwX6fp-XDghA,0,0,1,RToPVYL03v-h2GniWhLSKg

Staff here can't make up their minds how much drinks cost, either.  Today, $4 for a screwdriver....last week, $2.50.   Same time of day.   No one pays any attention to whether or not someone had just walked in...despite the bell that goes off upon entering.     I gave this place a couple of chances, thinking it may have been an off week or what have you .....Will not be returning",AlbAdoh_cQGy0TTvRg7VZw,0,0,2,uXOYbuCdWUx5yaeNmSft-A

Now round 2 I believe she said her name was Diane or Diana either way on Sunday August 14th, 2016 she was working at approximately 4:22 PM. She was in no way polite as I entered. Even with my young face she never asked to see my ID. Which I actually appreciated. So I have a condition where my esophagus is herniated causing painful gas to build up in my chest, I burped and immediately after she starts ranting and raving about how every time on her shift I burp and she's going to ""throw me out"" I said I have a medical condition and you are going to throw me out because of it? She said ""I don't care that shit is disgusting"" and you can't be on your phone that's strike two. As this is going I paid for my soda that I asked for because A she didn't even ask me if I was staying, and I know that you have to at least be gambling $10 and I had no intentions on doing so. She goes in the back mumbling about its time for me to go now. I still have money I the machine and when I look at it there's a charger port for a cell phone and I say so I can charge my phone but I can't have it. She claims she said speaker phone I asked her if there was somewhere I could read such a rule that it could have me out out of a pretty much empty building, and she says it's not posted its what she said. I informed her I would be writing a letter to corporate, she made a face and said like oh I'm scared. I will be penning that letter after I go to the hospital. As I was only killing time for my friend to drive me there after someone hit my car yesterday. I will never again return to this dotty's there's one right across the street anyway.",zUW2xPh2MUceDWmfx3PrZQ,0,0,1,36m1HPSE04iCMc8YjVsUfg
