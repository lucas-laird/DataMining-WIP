53585,2015-07-04,0,L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA,"Came here for dinner with my family on a Friday. The inside is pretty big and can seat a good number of parties. Overall a very average HK style restaurant.

Price- The dinner prices are more typical of the Bay Area, but is a bit pricey compared to other Chinese places in Vegas.

Service- We were seated immediately after we came in. The waitress was nice and came by once in a while to refill our water and to see how the food was.

Food- Very average. The Chicken with Ginger and Onion Sauce and the House Special Pan Fried Noodle were the 2 that stood out and the ones I would recommend trying. Both had enough flavor and tasted delicious. The Seafood Soup and the Seafood Fried Rice, however, needed work. Both were bland and definitely needed more seasoning. I ended up mixing the ginger/onion sauce with the fried rice; 100x better after that happened. They also gave us complimentary white rice, but I'm not sure if that happens for everyone or it depends on what ypu order.

On a side note, their tea cups were kind of dirty and sticky, so make sure to wipe it off a bit with napkins before using. Also, my dad and brother-in-law said the men`s restroom was extremely dirty. The women's one wasn`t that bad though.",Mji05ZiUS4dtjjAH8oQ5mg,1,0,3,IrNGPU1VVQXbkWu7I9PZeQ

Although I stopped coming here for a while after that incident, as soon as I came back, I thought the food was still great. People might think I'm crazy but I believe this place serves one of the best Chinese food here in town. 

Quick rundown of what we ordered:
Salt and pepper fish- I love it! Ive tried it at other places and did not like it! It actually has flavor here! Eat it before it gets soggy though or it won't taste as good!
Seafood panfried noodle- Great flavor, one of my favorites here. But it could've used a little bit more sauce and more seafood!
BBQ duck and pork- The guy ordered this and he loves the BBQ duck but mentioned that the pork was a wee dry. 
Red bean with crushed ice drink- It was ok, nothing to get excited about. I guess it could've been a bit sweeter.

The portions are decent and prices are somewhat reasonable. Each dish cost over 10 bucks. They do offer lunch and late night specials though so prices then are cheaper.
The service was actually pretty good. I guess because we're regulars here and it wasn't as busy at the time. Overall, it was money well-spent.",kDUoBp9SgJSeS7-5443k5A,2,1,4,E2Ie1oYz2_Wca4doPIoZow

They had just opened at 11 a.m. and  several of us went to the Men's bathroom to wash our hands only to find the paper towel dispenser was empty!  Like I said they JUST OPENED and they didn't have the bathroom stocked.  That should have been done the night before.  We kind of wonder if the employees even washed hands before they started working & cooking in the morning??  I mentioned to the waitress about the paper towels and it was met with a blank, long-faced stare.  We had to ask for the lunch specials otherwise you get a more expensive menu which seems pretty unethical like they're deliberately trying to rip people off.  My wife asked the waitress if she speaks Mandarin and she RUDELY replied, ""No! Only Cantonese! Speak English!"" (which she wasn't very proficient in either). We ordered 9 dishes for the 7 of us and they gave us one serving bowl of rice that was only enough for 4 people.  After the dishes started coming out, we had to ask for another serving bowl of rice. We liked the fried fish and crispy chicken.  The salt & pepper pork chops weren't very flavorful at all.  We've had better food at the Asian Supermarket's food court and cheaper too!  We were shocked when we got the bill and they charged an additional $5 for the extra bowl of steamed rice! What the heck!!  To make matters worse they automatically added a gratuity of  $11. We didn't see any signs that they add gratuities   for groups of 6 or more so we felt like we were robbed. For the so called SERVICE that we received it wasn't even worth 11 CENTS!

The broth for the noodle soup had no taste at all. the floors are blackened, and i had seen a waiter drop the napkins and chopsticks on the dirty, yet blackened floor. You would think he would put them in the dirty bin, yet he blew on the chopsticks wiped them with a cloth and put them back in the drawer. he also fanned out the napkins and put them back as well. OMG i just wanted to puke. What they should do? In my opinion, if it was my restaurant. Get someone to clean the restroom on an hourly basis to refill the amenities. Also downsize the restaurant, so you can afford to get flooring. If not carpet, some cheap tiles. Maybe keep the size of the restaurant and lease half of it to a boba place so then you can finally afford to fix the flooring, and maybe have a decent bathroom. I had to wait til we left and headed to rio, so i could use the restroom. Avoid this at all costs. You rather go and get some mc donalds or pho!",X-Cigys2FQ0nWOySwG2rLw,0,0,1,Hq7FoOqa21Mv2Esal7bNLw

No wonder the basket of spices and sauces look so clean and new.

We ordered iced water. To our biggest surprise, the waitress brought a jar of iced water for refills. For this, they earned one star! Outside temperature was 107 degrees at 11 am.

We ordered Singapore fried noodles and beef with choi sum over the rice. The portion was good. The beef could be softer but ample sauce over the rice. 

The waitress came and checked on us frequently. She even asked us if the dishes were good.

However we were not sure if the air conditioning unit was not working or they just opened for the day, the inside room temperature was very warm.  So they earned a total of 4 stars.",9ElcsQca9jJ-Is-do2whhA,1,0,4,hk5ntAt_KWr9ngMxemij4A

I first tried Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast hotel and casino for Valentines day and my boy friend and I loved that place but then my co-worker told me about Cafe noodle as Ping Pang Pong is a lot pricier then cafe noodle and she said they have the same owners so their recipes  are the same (I'm not 100% sure how accurate that is but the food was still just as good here) so you get the same for a better price. I like that cafe noodle has a lunch special menu where you get a good portion for a very reasonable price. Everything on the lunch special menu is less than $8.

-soya chicken (M) which is a half chicken. If I had to compare, the taste of this is slightly better than DC and almost as good as Toronto. Juicy and tastily-flavored while still being very light.
-baby bok choy with garlic. The portion size was quite generous and taste was just right, not overly greasy despite being stir-fried. 
-wonton egg noodle soup with duck. Not a huge portion but was appropriate for the price. The duck was not amazing but I would still say very good, and the broth was light and still salty enough. 
-sweet & sour pork. My dad ordered this at the end out of a whim, and I wasn't thrilled by it, but you'll like it if you're into very sweet marinated meat. Definitely was more sweet than sour.

They are just located in a strip mall west them.  The interior is actually above average when compared with other restaurants in the Chinatown area.  Service fits the Asian restaurant stereotype quite well with their poker faces.

They got varies special deals going on at this place, most traditional one is the night snack after 10pm, then there is the afternoon tea specials, and I think they also got something for lunch as well.  The best thing I like about this place is Chinese comfort food.  I never miss a chance to get their flat or egg noodles soups, usually Wonton Beef Stew or Dumpling Noodles.  Stir fried noodles were just as good.

Congee and BBQ were decent as well.  Rice plates were another thing I get every now and then, notably Curry Beef Stew Rice and Minced Beef with Egg Rice.  For regular dishes, I was not such big fan about them.  They prepared them decent enough compared to ones I had in my home state.  The cod dish seems to be pretty good deal at night snack hours.  They have off menu items such as oysters upon request.

In Cantonese, their name is pronounced ""Luk Ding Gei"", which had nothing to do with Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque.  Since most of the places suck in the Chinatown Plaza, this place is the closest place being decent near that area.",B2F7f8NdlBUESv8cskE-jw,1,1,4,xqv2s5mLy3cMggkm-IrIiQ

Cafe Noodle is a great place to go if close authenticity, without the high price tag, is important to you. They offer a fairly large array of items (including the ones that would probably steer you clear of inviting a friend that is not familiar with authentic Chinese food).

You are greeted by a happy buddha, that stands on top of the counter. 

Most tables are round that can seat 6-9 people. There are also booth tables available as well. I usually prefer sitting away from the roasting area, since the smell of duck can get overwhelming and possibly change your palette and appetite. 

The menu is extensive and has standard Chinese fare plus many authentic dishes. The sesame chicken is great. I always order the honey shrimp. Be forewarned though, that Cafe Noodle's honey shrimp might have more of the sweet mayo than usual. But the shrimps are large, which I like. Also, their duck is fantastic, as well as their fried bass. Also, try their pan fried seafood chow mein. I love my noodles extra crispy, and they make it just right. It is amazing. 

Service is up to par. I would actually say better than majority of ""mom/pop"" chinese establishments that I have been at. A good amount of the workers there understand and speak english well.

Fried Tofu: This dish was pretty good. The fried part of the tofu wasn't thick and the sauce that came with it was pretty good.

Food is nicely portioned, so like I said, I definitely like the price of everything here especially because they have the ""special price/portioned"" menu.

There was no fresh garlic in the pork chops, and the jalapeño was raw as if the cook remembered at the last minute to actually throw in some pepper with the salt and pepper pork chops.

The jellyfish was hardly marinated or pickled. It was just drenched in chili oil. It was also missing the pickled radish at the bottom. The pan fried noodles were okay. It didn't have any exciting flavors, and there wasn't as much seafood as they used to serve.

All the food on their menu is always cooked perfectly. They even have a lunch special menu if you come within the lunch hours. My boyfriend and I used to come here at least once a week or once every 2 weeks. 

Coming from a family where my mom works in the food and beverage industry, she has always taught me to ALWAYS give tip no matter how bad the service is or how horrible the food is. Just put down a dollar at least. My boyfriend also having his dad in the same industry he taught him the same exact thing..

When the waiters/waitresses gives us the check we pay the bill first and then place down the tip on the table before we leave the restaurant. I guess one of the waitress recognizes us and one day comes to us while handing us the receipt she has the nerve to tell us that we don't tip or that her other co-workers tells her that we don't like to tip. 
So when she gives us the bill she asks us 
""Do you guys not like to tip because the service is bad?"" 
And then we answered
""No, we always tip. Even if the service was bad we tip.""

Then after that little conversation we had, she backed off and didn't say a word. When we were about to leave I told my boyfriend to only leave a dollar on the damn table. They didn't deserve any more than a dollar because they had the damn nerve to talk to us about tips. 

So since then, we've never been back and never will. This place is good for the lunch specials but the company isn't gonna get our money no more.",YB0ElN56cYSQIQw2_53oug,2,1,2,fIl0pxRnBCDlooa5SlgeeQ

There are a bunch of things on the lunch/late night special menu and when you think about the portion size, you're getting a great deal.  An earlier review made mention of the taste of Vegas Tap Water being a predominant flavor in the tea.  I'd have to agree.  Quite unfortunate.

2470360,2011-12-15,20,L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA,"A three hour walking exploration of Las Vegas' Chinatown culminated with a large and delicious lunch here.  Relying once again on the ratings of Las Vegas Yelpers I decided to check out this spacious restaurant along Spring Mountain Road.

It was like stepping into a restaurant back home again as a lady greeted me in Cantonese and asked me how many.  A single index finger answered that question as I was escorted to my table.  Judging by their conversation two gentlemen seated beside me on their lunch break seemed to really like this place.  Honestly I don't eavesdrop but sometimes when you're sitting there reading your cell phone you hear things.

The menu being clumsy and tattered was definitely a symbol as to the popularity of the place.  The prices on the other hand were about double what I would pay in San Francisco, but I usually keep an open mind on that being that things are rarely as good as they are at home.

Noodles or Chinese barbecue?  Not having steamed rice for nearly a week the Chinese in me went with the latter in selecting the rice plate with two BBQ meats.  Roast Duck was definitely going to be my first choice, but it was the recent review of a San Francisco Yelp friend who wrote about a San Francisco deli with very good Soy Sauce Chicken that influenced me into trying my second choice.  I hadn't had soy sauce chicken all year so that's what I picked to go beside my duck.

Not sure about portion size I selected the Crispy Fried Tofu appetizer as well.

The tofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA?select=2qOeThevkuoRKc9Enk6mSQ) arrived first.  The eight squares of crispy, golden fried silken tofu on a bed of shredded lettuce served with a simple soy sauce infused with chopped, fresh jalapeno was simple and fabulous.  The taste was very clean and very fresh without a hint of frying oil.

When I saw my rice plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA?select=8UiNNR3cVaxzUVHi3UoCDw) I knew right away I couldn't finish it.  Not only was the steamed rice piled high, but so were the meats.  I knew I'd end up concentrating on the meat since I wasn't about to carry leftovers back to my hotel room.  The drippings from the roast duck mixed into the rice was so good though it was hard not to eat all the rice.  Both of the meats were cooked well.  The chicken had good flavor but the meat was a bit thin and a bit chewy.  The duck was actually meatier than the chicken, and I definitely enjoyed the flavor more.

My sensitivity to MSG didn't come into play.  It's hard to imagine Chinese style BBQ without MSG, but since I couldn't detect any I'd have to say this place did it right.  The health score of ""A"" was quite reassuring too.  That's something I don't see that often in San Francisco!",8Aq_UdlsrjhBwGWb_U-xRA,24,23,4,NjFDvcay-w9IYLtJV7onQg

The interior is definitely not as hopeful-looking as the exterior.  The service is pretty sporadic, you definitely have to make an effort to get the attention of the servers if you need something.

My friend was right about the noodles.  They were as fresh as egg noodles go and perfectly cooked (egg noodles are usually overcooked in most places).  I ordered the BBQ duck and pork & shrimp wonton noodle soup.  The wontons were a good size and very delicious.  The BBQ duck was all right, a little on the bland side.  The noodles certainly were the highlight.

I also judge Chinese restaurants by their complimentary tea pot, I believe it gives me a sneak peek of how much effort they put into their food.  Cafe Noodle's tea was made with tap water, I could taste the Vegas pipes, which means points have to be deducted.

I came here to eat with my good friends and ordered wonton noodle soup, beef and broccoli, and a few other dishes I have no idea how to identify in English. Seasoning was just right for my taste--not too salty, not too bland. When you're in Las Vegas the heat dries you up already. No need to dehydrate further with excessive salt intake.

Instead apologizing for serving the bad congee, they denied that anything was wrong with it. That in itself is a big no no in my books. What happened to the customer satisfaction.

The rice, spring roll and won ton were more then less forgettable.  For 6 bucks though the deal was good and the food filling.  If you eat there I believe you get soup and tea.

We just visited this cafe twice in a week. The first trip we found a used tea bag in the tea pot  the server gave us. I brought it to the Manager attention and he apologized sincerely. he explained that sometimes customers bring their own tea bag into the restaurant. Since we enjoyed the food, we decided to let the matter rest. Two days later, we visited this restaurant again. The food was reasonably tasty. However, when we asked for the bill, that is when our entire experience went down the drain! We normally do not check the items listed on the receipt and like many we merely pay the total amount as shown. This time for no reason we checked the items listed on the bill and found out shockingly that an item of $3/- was automatically added into the bill without even informing the customer! Normally we leave cash on the table but in this instance we were shocked! how can a waitress or establishment secretly and automatically add on ""tips"" onto the bill and not inform the customer? Also if we did not even notice the ""tips"" we would have double tip bec we always leave 20% behind anyway! When we confronted the waitress and asked how can she do such a secretive billing, she merely tried to cover it up by giving ridiculous reasons ..she explained that when the convention is in town, they always add automatic tip onto every customer bill. Such practice left us totally disgusted and we pledged we will not visit this establishment ever. We learn now to check every item on the bill because you never know what extra item can be added.

4759501,2015-09-05,0,L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA,"This place serves arguably the best fried rice in Las Vegas. Like i always tell my friends, if you want to judge the standard of a chinese restaurant, always start of with a plate of Fried Rice. This seemingly easy dish is actually very complicated and requires alot of delicate effort to create.
 From the type of rice, fire and wok control, you can tell how skillful are the chef. If a chinese restaurant cannot even get the simplest fried rice correct, how could u expect the rest of the dishes to be good? 
This was my second time at the restaurant, the last time i was here i was a good 1 year ago and i didn't want to write a review based on my semi - hungover judgement. So this time, i took a huge amount of effort to convince my colleagues to try it. 
So there are a bunch of different fried rice to choose from, you have the classic Yang Chow Fried Rice, which is a benchmark for the restaurant, to the more exotic and adventurous salted fish fried rice. What i can tell you is that their fried rice, no matter which choice you make, you are bound for a great meal. Besides, for about 8 dollars a plate, the portion of the fried rice is HUGE. If you are a small eater, you can definitely share a plate with your partner. 
Another thing to note here is that they serve porridge as well, although not the best I've tasted around the world, it does brings me the nostalgic feeling from the days I've been in Hong Kong.",vtqFTMUq-oCn30GCgWqMsg,1,1,4,lBGToH6WJiggljDOJilzVQ

This place is located below Ichiza in the same plaza, a little hidden, but worth it if you want some Hong Kong stye Cantonese food.

We went for breakfast so ended up ordering the jook (rice porridge), some gon chao ngau hor (flat noodles with beef and bean sprouts), fried tofu for the young man and some Cantonese style sui gao (dumplings). 

The gon chao ngau hor smelled wonderful and tasted pretty good. Only thing was it was super greasy. I think next time I'll have to tell them to go easy on the oil. The jook was really nice on a cold morning. Portions are much smaller here. The bowl of jook is about what you'd get when you go to dim sum, not when you go to a restaurant that has jook on the menu. 

The sui gao weren't bad at all -- I mean it's not like what you'll get in HK but since I can't just hop on a plane every time I'm craving something like this, I'll just have to make do.

First of all, they have $4.95 lunch specials from 11am-5pm, so regardless of your vampire schedule, you can pretty much bet the special is happening. If you have impeccable timing, however and can stall lunch until 3pm or perhaps go for an early dinner at 4:30pm, you can get a free large milk coffee or milk tea with your entree. The ice coffee is superior to the tea in case you were wondering. This is an amazing deal given that an iced coffee can set you back at least $2.50 elsewhere.

As for the interior, it is a step below okay, but close enough to okay to not offend. If you are used to Chinatown-esque restaurants, you will be just fine. The service was a bit abrupt, definitely not a bright spot. When the Mr. tried to ask about getting a vegetable mei fun as a special, he received a very abrupt: ""If it is not on menu, you can not get it. Mei fun has fish cakes."" The tone was enough to prevent any further questioning, so he accepted the fish cakes, and I ordered the stir fried mixed vegetables without any questions. 

The food was good. Not too saucy, and the mixed vegetables were all true vegetables: no baby corn, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots or odd fungus.  Despite the sea of fish cakes, the noodles were also tasty. There are definitely some experienced men in the kitchen, as everything was hot and seasoned appropriately. 

For $4.95, it is hard to beat. A little smile from the server might have edged me over to four stars. I might have to give it a second shot to see if there is a friendlier server on a different day.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,4,4,3,Guw5oUZ3kfiG5RTw80MTUw

I have a pretty much constant craving for asian noodle soup, so we decided to go to Chinatown, since my Vegas resident friend said that it was the ONLY place to get asian food.  

We randomly drove down the street and saw this place...""Cafe NOODLE...blah blah blah.""  That was the place for me!  It was around midnight, and we were dressed up in very small pieces of clothing, but the waiters still made us feel comfortable.  He pointed us to the Beef Brisket & Egg Noodle Soup, so that's what we got (me without wontons and my friend with wontons).  

We weren't expecting much...after all....we just found any place with noodle soup and got whatever was suggested. But MAN...it was GOOOOOODDDDD!!!!!!! The broth....beefy goodness without feeling overwhelmed by the beefiness.  The noodles were JUST the right texture  to complement the beefy broth.  And there were HUGE chunks of beef, the kinf that breaks apart easily and it attached to a huge piece of tendon/fat.  I know it's bad, but i've always specifically loved those fatty/tendony pieces of meat.  I got like....10 huge pieces in that little bowl!!!   It was...to die for.  So good, that we both ate the whole thing, were so full that we wanted to sleep, and we decided to go home instead of go clubbing. hahaha.  Any food that can do that to a couple of club girls MUST be amazing.

5220892,2017-02-18,1,L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA,"I was introduced to this restaurant about four years ago and it was a great, affordable place for families and friends to eat at. They categorize their menus by prices starting with $4 family style plates and up from there. One small bowl of rice is included with your entree but if you wanted more rice you would need to pay $2 extra for it. I always ordered the salt and pepper pork chops, chow fun, and black bean chicken! You could also ask for their hot tea because it goes well with your dish. 

I love their food but there are some problems with this restaurant. Initial thought is the restaurant is nice but once you are seated you will notice dirt/ stains on your eating utensils. They do not wash it good, as a matter of fact I always used my napkin to wipe off any excess dirt and my napkin would be filled with brown stains. Tables and chairs are still dirty. When I let the servers know about it they are rude. They speak in another language to each other aggressively and give my party and I a mean stare as they go to get another set of eating utensils. Customer service is bad here, you will not have a good experience with them. I don't get it? They sit and watch TV and get up whenever a customer flags them down... they're chillin at work! Card minimum is $10, lies! They sometimes enforce it and sometimes they don't, they just want you as the customer to spend more. One time I paid with card and was going to tip with cash so when I put ""$0"" on the receipt to sign off my card, the server gives it back to me and says she can't accept it without the tip... wait, what? I told her I was going to tip cash then she switched up her rude attitude. She didn't apologize to me and obviously I knew she was getting rowdy because she thought she wasn't going to get a tip. 

I was a regular here but they ended up being on dirty dining and their servers are the worse! The only good thing about this place is their prices on their food, good price for the amount you get.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,4,2,2,WhlM96D-cnnCSKfgh0-qCQ

We are a group of 8 including my family and my aunt's family. We were seated pretty quickly, at around 10:30 pm. Customer service is pretty similar to other Chinese restaurants - quick, immediate, sometimes impatient but not really. 

We ordered some different drinks, they had coke, diet coke, hot tea, and they even served thai tea drinks that were really good as well. We usually order an array of different Chinese food, from fried pork chops, to pan fried noodles, and vegetables, and my family at their fried soul fish (which I personally cannot eat due to my allergies). What I really enjoy trying out in every Chinese restaurant is their orange chicken, and this spot has really good orange chicken - not too sweet, but with added spice and flavor.

Cafe Noodle offers a surprising amount of wholesome dishes for $4.95. My hubby and I went after to work to see what the fuss was all about. The restaurant seemed kind of run down, but the food makes up for it. We ordered whole fried chicken served with sweet and sour sauce, beef chow fun, Chinese broccoli, and salt & pepper pork chops. The food was actually really good and the portions were more then generous. The Chinese broccoli was slightly steamed with the perfect amount of oyster sauce, the thing that makes great chow fun is when the beef is tender, the noodles tasted fresh because it wasn't mushy or soggy and the bean sprouts were firm, not wilted. The salt and pepper pork chops are smaller than most locations but not as fatty... mmmmm.... so good with their chili sauce. Lastly, a whole fried chicken for $4.95?

5314307,2017-07-11,0,L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA,"I'm from both NY and LA.  I couldn't understand why Chinese food sucks so bad in Vegas compared to the other major cities.  I finally learned it is because all the head chefs go to the major cities and all the sous chefs go to secondary towns like Vegas to try to fool the locals.

Tonight I ordered 4 things:
Fried Tofu, Eggplant, Brisket Curry, and Peking Porkchops. 

The fried tofu was the only thing done right, but of course, they're frozen and just refried. To mess up this dish would be like ruining french fries.  Possible but unlikely.  They're cut into large squares which strange, traditionally in Asia they're only a quarter of the size.  The point is to eat more fried surface, not less.

The eggplant, the sauce was.......... super American it was a sweet sauce which is strange and looked like it was a spin-off of barbecue sauce.

The brisket curry had no brisket, it was 100% tendon.  Plus I don't care where you go or what anyone says,  you don't add green peppers into curry dishes.  Just like when you find carrots in your beef and broccoli or peas in your fried rice.  They didn't do this because someone in the kitchen has a culinary passion.  No, not for 7.98, they did this to fill the dish and make it look bigger.   I'd rather have a smaller bowl of curry but it is done right like in authentic Indian joints.

The Peking Porkchops.   Do you like ketchup? its just fried pork smothered in ketchup except it was even more acidic.  You can smell the added vinegar from a mile away.  It was awful.
We barely ate any of it and when we got the check, no one cared why we barely touched the food.  

They then handed me the bill on an American Express tray and handed me back my card saying they don't take American Express.  I pointed to the logo and laughed.   

I looked around and realized what I had done wrong.  EVERYONE ELSE ordered a bowl of noodles.  Like some type of wonton noodle variation with duck or something.

In summary, if you come here just get the wonton noodle bowl and stfu,  don't order anything else.  its a nightmare and it's too tall of an order for their service ability.",udSgW1BGOjP4lw9_Fsqqpg,0,0,1,GoxCpjCG-DuWit5BtzWxxw

The staff is blatantly rude and did not give a warm welcome when my party and I first entered. It continued to go downhill from there because our waitress was curt, and she didn't even seem to care about our table. When she came to take our order, she approached us with a harsh tone. It sounded like she was annoyed, but our party just got there and the restaurant wasn't filled up with people... She then proceeded to cut me and my friends off a few times while we were trying to say what we wanted from the menu. She also kept stopping in the middle of taking our order to have conversations with people in her language, which is okay, but I didn't see it appropriate to have full-on conversations while writing our order down... 

There was another employee who was refilling our drinks and also brought the food out to our table. He wasn't friendly either, and whenever he'd pick up our glasses to refill with water, he would smack it back down so water droplets came out of the cups. Same thing happened with the food. Even with us saying ""thank you"" with a smile and a happy tone, there was no response from him. Way to make your customers feel even more unwelcome...

We ordered the salt and pepper pork chop, BBQ pork with soft noodles, the crispy noodle dish, beef chow fun, and the garlic and onion pork. 

The salt and pepper pork chops were small bits of pan-fried pork ribs. They were a bit salty, but nothing too harsh. They actually were quite good.

The BBQ Pork with soft noodles is just your average ""lo-mein"" type of dish. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was good enough for us to chow down on.

The crispy noodle dish was alright as well; it's crispy until the sauce makes the noodles soggy. The veggies they put in it were green and tasted fresh. 

The chow fun and the crispy noodle dish both looked slimy from the sauce, and the meat in it looked like unidentifiable protein. Anyway, it was good for what we came in for (to eat a bunch of Chinese dishes), but definitely not worth the sit-down experience. The presentation of the food wasn't too appealing, either. It looked like they just slapped it on the plate and expedited it to our table.

Overall, they have a wide selection of different dishes on their menu, but the horrible service was unforgivable. Honestly, I've never been to a restaurant where the workers were this rude to their patrons. A good business should cater to customers to build customer loyalty, but I guess giving out acceptable customer service is just not one of their priorities. 

Sigh... I don't mean to sound like I'm ranting (and typically I'm easy to please), but save yourself from giving your money to a place that doesn't care about your business. If you do decide to try their fare, heed my warning -- you'll get subpar quality food paired with awful service.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,18,11,1,6dOp5_ByvFKfow30vUkOug
5373623,2011-07-08,0,L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA,"Does Cafe Noodle have regular hours? At any given point, in the day, they are running some kind of special. My family came here for the lunch special that runs from 11am-5pm. They have one two sided menu that dictates what you can order and everything is $4.95. 

The best dish was the Mandarin fried pork chops. They were hot, crispy, and thrown in sweet and tangy sauce. Each plate comes with six or seven big pieces and it was hard to resist licking my fingers clean. So good that we ordered a second plate to take home and began to pick at it while waiting for a box. The fried soft tofu with cod was not bad. The filet of fish were moist and tender. The cod with ginger and scallions was delicious, but you must love scallions because they sauteed it with large cut stocks. The pepper beef over rice came with thick slices of tender beef and big chunks of green peppers and onions. The dry beef flat noodles was a generous portion of everything, but was oily. The kung pao squid was tender, and not rubbery, but it was the greasiest of all the dishes. For everything that we got, you would think it would be expensive, but we were able to feast for less than forty dollars. That alone is a reason to love Chinatown. 

Most of the time, Chinese restaurant employees can come off as gruff and curt, but not here. Everyone from the hostess, both servers, and the busboy were quick and attentive.

And I believe they're open late. you can't beat the price either.,FRxGcIRukrH5lW2SQSxstg,1,0,4,HicTVL2Hx1Ab-URWXoCp8w

Tasty dishes, a little bit on the greasy side with some of them, and if you're vegetarian the menu is limited to about 4 choices you can choose from (the pan fried vegetable mix is a smaller portion than I'd like it to be), but for everything else you get a pretty good deal ($5 a head? You can dine like a king!) I'm giving this place four stars because the service has always been friendly and attentive, and most plates you really get the bang for your buck! This place is perfect for those in larger groups, they don't seem to mind in the least! ;)",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,0,0,4,VMtRiuqjEJfvLoKFRzkOkQ

The kids had a table for themselves and they were grubbin'.  The waiters were very helpful with the menu.  Our favorites are the salt and pepper shrimp, salt and pepper pork chops and salt and pepper squid...hmmm...did we miss another salt & pepper dish?? LOL.....  The best dish was the beef hot pot.

My mom ordered from the splendid Lunch Special menu (which had a pretty good selection of tasty sounding entrees) &&got the Black peppered pork w/ soft noodles. I opted for the BBQ Duck, Won Ton in Egg Noodle Soup

Overall: it was deelish and since my mom barely touched her plate, We still had leftover for this morning. 

Must try since its located in the heart of Chinatown, once you're done you can head to Tea Station located a couple of units down for a drink.",ANLSKvFmCgRMjxtELq70FQ,1,1,3,N8_ZO-WvBdAWG_14UcHEbQ

It start going downhill with the smell of rancid fish when you walk in. I've been to other places like that but the food was good. We had a noodle bowl, egg rolls, and kung pao chicken. The noodle bowl was a mess with no taste, the egg rolls were mostly hot nasty oil, and the Kung pao was all onions and peppers with 10 small pieces of chicken.

5918783,2014-01-17,3,L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA,"Lunch (11am-5pm) & Late Night Specials (for $4.95, and the portions are generous, definitely the right spot to hit up for decent hot meal on a glacial global economic recovery budget.  That was how I felt about the economy back in 2011. Vegas has definitely recovered a lot from the dismal lows, but not really back to what it was before the crash.  So I continue to seek out decent restaurants that is budget friendly, and Café Noodle & Chinese Barbeque continues to be near the top of my list for curing hunger on a tight budget.

Like many other Yelpers have mentioned, the restaurant is not the cleanest.  Even after clearing a recently vacated table and sanitizing it, it still feels not quite clean. Maybe it is that lingering thin film of grease or they simply needed to use a cleaner rag to clean the tables.  Well, at least the utensils and tea cups are clean.

Anyway, I ended up here at Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque, a restaurant that I have walked past numerous times to other businesses in this super busy plaza with the ridiculously inadequate parking spaces. However, the American name is completely foreign to me, and to locate it I had to look up the driving direction.  The place was relatively crowded at 11pm on a Tuesday night, and pretty much every patron was Asians.  I immediately sensed a good vibe that this place must be at least decent.

After looking over the menu, I opted for the Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings appetizer (tasty but on the greasy side, occasionally not very flavorful due to insufficient amount of ""salt & pepper"") and the Pan Fried Noodles with Beef and Vegetable (very large portion and pretty flavorful).  The food is not high end, but for the prices they are charging you, it is well worth it.  That was from my very first visit back in 2011, and the incomplete review draft sat and sat and sat some more until now.

So two years have gone by and several visits later (both dine-in and take-out), my impression remained roughly the same.  Service for the most part is their weak point.  Not the friendliest or most attentive, but occasionally you will get a waiter that stepped up his game (a refreshing change). Then there are times when you end up standing there for 5 minutes wanting to place an order and be completely ignored by the lady behind the counter and ultimately walk out and head across the street to another near 24/7 Chinese restaurant that is just as good, if not better.

The food at great value is what keeps me coming back once I get over their latest service mishaps. 
What I do recommend here:
* 2 BBQ Items Combo on Rice (I usually get their BBQ Duck and Soya Chicken) - it will set up back $8.75
* Spicy Eggplant Hot Pot - one of my favorites
* Salted Fish & Chicken Fried Rice - I usually get this to go plus something else. Slightly adventurous due to the salted fish.
* Any of their Pan Fried Flat Rice Noodle dishes - but sometimes it is a little greasy, so drink plenty of hot tea!
* Crispy Fried Chicken (all day special dine-in only offer for $5.95 each) - that is a very sweet and filling deal!

From 3PM to 5PM, they have a limited ""High Tea"" menu, customers get a free HK style milk tea or coffee (hot or cold) along with your order. Not an awesome promo, but if you have to pay for said complimentary beverage it will cost you $2.50.  

NOTE: In their recent Chinese newspaper ads, they have all day specials from $4.95 to $7.95, but I have never tested that during normal dinner time.

Minimum for credit card use is $15, so order enough or bring cash.

The food was delicious. Service wasn't too bad, I didn't have a hard time flagging down our waiter, and they are open until 2am!

Went around 10:30pm on a Monday night and received the after hours menu.. Didn't really even bother looking at the regular menu since there were four pages of choices for $7.95 and under.

This is the best chinese restaurant in chinatown hands down.  The food taste so good and the prices are cheap.  The atmosphere is comfortable and they give you decent service.  

If you want authentic chinese food without feeling uncomfortable, this is the place to go.

I stopped by with a friend for dinner as we were starving. We ordered a gluttonous amount of food, expecting to have plenty of leftovers. If the items we tried, there were a few items I enjoyed, but overall, nothing really stood out. My favorite from the meal were the salt & pepper pork chops and the service was surprisingly attentive.
