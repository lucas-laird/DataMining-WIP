For dinner, we ordered the prime rib, Joey's Filet, and the crab stuffed shrimp.  All were very good, the shrimp was fine, but not as good as the steaks.  They have a great deal on the sides, 3 sides for the price of 2.  We ordered the mac n' cheese (we added lobster for only $10), mashed potatoes, and asparagus.  All were done very nicely.  For dessert, we got the creme brulee and the turtle lava cake.  Both very good.  Very good place and a cool atmosphere.  Would definitely come back to try the NY strip.",GDPd8xGn1CtrbEo4hOoVVA,1,0,4,5KpVLf63vUXz5CFU54s6wQ

He is probably the friendliest and classiest server my wife and I have ever had. It also helps they also offer a better NY strip than any we've had at other steakhouses in town including Gordon Ramsey's. Hands down a must visit every time we come to Vegas. We stay on the strip every time but make a trip to Fremont just to eat here, that's how good it is.

The location is in the Plaza Hotel & Casino in the revitalized downtown area. From the outside, the large glass-walled dining room looks as though it might be old-style Vegas at its worst, but from the inside it's actually quite nice. We've been there twice. The first time the service was excellent, the second time it was very good. The food is whimsically described on the menu, but well prepared. In short, I thought this might just be a novelty place and instead found somewhere to which I'll enjoy returning.",z3QfjD55F6YjDNIjcii5Ew,0,0,4,2dUeVPjTxDAEj-OLW060Zw

We stopped at the bar prior to our 5:30 reservations and enjoyed some delicious/strong drinks with happy hour prices (try the Sazeriac it's great). Our waiter was Frank who was really wonderful and attended to every detail, including getting a black napkin vs. the regular white for our friend who had black pants on (Frank said he didn't want any possibility of lint getting on his pants that's classy). Frank was very conscientious of our show time and kept dinner moving and a nice but not rushed pace. I ordered the lobster bisque which was wonderful even without large pieces of lobster in it. The rest of the table had Caesar's salad and wedge salad both reported them to be good not great. I had the blackened salmon and it was spectacular, well cooked and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend had the small prime rib which was amazing, our friends had the small filet which was cooked perfectly and the spice rubbed flank steak which was stuffed with garlic and massive. We all shared asparagus (nicely cooked), potato wedges (great only wish there were more sweet potatoes) and the corn brulee which was the best of the sides for sure. Frank recommended cheesecake for dessert and it did not disappoint (it was flown in from NY). We left at exactly 7pm which was perfect and we were to our show in perfect time.

We both ordered our 8-ounce filets medium rare and both cuts were different; one came out medium and thin while the other was perfect. Luckily my awesome husband traded with me and gave me the perfect cut. He also traded steak knives (the knives they give to the ladies are a little wimpy!!)

Beef, Booze and Broads....so three in our party of four had the steak, one chicken with artichokes and all had booze....However, the broad looked a little tired and failed to stop by our table to wish us a good dining experience.  The beef was excellent, the beef eaters all ordered Joey C's filet, one had that served Oscar with lump crab, asparagus and Béarnaise sauce.  The steaks were tender and cooked to perfection.  The béarnaise was one of the best I have eaten both in taste, temperature and consistency.  It melted perfectly into the beef.  Chicken and artichokes was good as well, however, the sauce that it is served with was a bit salty.  

We ordered mashed potatoes (excellent) and creamed spinach as sides for the table.  None of us cared for the creamed spinach, the cream was not very creamy.  We wish we had gone for sautéed spinach.

So why did I only give this place a three......the waiter, a gentleman with long grayish hair pulled back in a ponytail had a superior condescending attitude.  We are locals and we travel and dine out extensively.  We seek out dining experiences, so while the food was excellent the waiter really put a damper on an otherwise excellent evening.

It started when one member of the party asked which steak was better and waiter with attitude kind of chuckled at such a 'stupid"" question and said ""whichever one you like best"".  very helpful then he acted perturbed as the diner tried to decide which to get....

One member of our party saw the onion rings that were served at another table and asked waiter with attitude to please bring some to our table.  They were not served when out entrees came out but we figured since we ordered them a little later they would come later...That wasn't the case and waiter with attitude never did stop back to see if we wanted anything...

Because of waiter with attitude we decided to fore go desert...We will go back to Oscars but will specifically request that we not be seated in waiter with attitude's section......If he is still there.......",u75L5cco6mPpBz4rbyxTEQ,3,0,3,7UWvj-nm0EGKKFeoj6SeWg
169303,2014-07-25,1,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Nothing special. 

Got the filet mignon (rare) which was very tender and cooked perfectly...I just wish it was a bit more bloody. Haha. The flavor was alright. 

Also added a side of king crab legs. For $20 I basically got two crabs legs which were split in half. It wasn't even really good. Texture seemed fresh, but it still lacked flavor even with the addition of lemon juice, butter, and salt. I've had better tasting crab at a buffet and for $20 it was so not worth it. 

Other people at my table ordered the New York steak, which was decent and again cooked to the right temperature. The flavor was okay for this as well, albeit it wasn't anything spectacular. If you are expecting to splurge on a piece of meat that will knock your socks off, this isn't it. 

We also ordered mushrooms and onions to go with three of the steaks. It was a total of $24 for the mushrooms and $15 for the onions (3 orders each).  The mushrooms were okay (again nothing special), but the onions were wayyyy too sweet. Now I love and prefer grilled/caramelized onions to raw onions because of the sweetness, but these onions were on a whole 'nother level of sweet. Nobody at our table even wanted a second bite. So uh yeah, the mushrooms and onions were a complete waste of money.

I wish the manager would have cared, but all he told us was that the grill gets overworked and by the end of the night it doesn't cook the steaks right.

I always get the filet mignon butterflied well done and they do it perfectly!  The garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus are delicious sides as well.  The dinners here are just so so good. My husband ordered the salmon and I don't even like fish but it looked delicious as well.

Their drink selection is fair, ranging from Coors lights to IPAS, martinis, champagne, whiskey, vodka and mixed drinks. We also ordered a few appetizers which were made quickly and were extremely tasty.

We told him that we weren't in a hurry and didn't want to be rushed, and the timing on the entire meal was just about perfect.  Our water glasses were refilled regularly, without asking, Frankie was friendly and charming and his attitude just added to the pleasantness of the evening.  We all were very pleased with our food - the onion bread was great (I loved the lobster bisque), and our steaks were done perfectly.

The waiters were dressed in crisp black and white striped shirts and black ties, and looked great!

254810,2012-02-17,1,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Look, I'm not going to lie-- I was skeptical.  Very skeptical.  One might even say scared.  Other Yelp reviewers have torn this place apart.  But the hubby had his heart set on Oscar Goodman's name sake, and so we made reservations and went for Valentine's Day.  And in all honesty I really enjoyed myself!  I'm not sure why some other horrendous reviews.

Yes, my review is long, but I'm trying to help others.  Here's how I see it:

Service:  2 1/2 stars. While I hope Oscar's management takes my whole review to heart, this is the area they need to take most seriously.  Our waiter was nice enough, but not the best I've ever had.  Both the hostesses (those at the front desk who check in reservations and those that seat guests) and bussing staff were, well, lackluster--hard to get a read either way.  Quite honestly the two best staff members I met during the evening was the general manager circulating the room and our food runner who always came by with a smile.  To those complaints from other reviewers that say their waiter was never seen between order and bill-- apparently we didn't dine at the same restaurant, because friendly or not, all the staff was present.  I will agree however that all of the staff could use an afternoon seminar on smiling and saying ""Yes.""

Food:  3 1/2 stars.  The food itself was more like 4 stars (I am clueless what poor reviewers have been eating--most everything we had was wonderful), but the menu selection gets them ""knocked down"" a 1/2 if not a full star in my book.  I've never been to a steakhouse that doesn't have at least one pasta dish on the menu, and because I'm not a steak fan (hubby is a fanatic) the pasta is what I always order.  However, Oscar's does not have a single one.  When I inquired of the waiter if a pasta request could be accomodated (I know they share a kitchen with sister restaurant Italian ""Simpatico,"" so this shoudn't be impossible.) he stated that I could see a Simpatico menu, but if I wanted to order off that, we would have to be re-seated in that room.  That's ridiculous!  My husband wants the Oscar's menu, and we both want appetizers and desserts from your menu, all I'm asking for is a pasta entree from the kitchen.  I had already even viewed the Simpatico menu and was going to order one of the most expensive dishes!  (Pricier than what I ended up ordering off Oscar's real menu, oh well, your loss of a bigger check, Mr. Waiter.)  Anyway, I pieced together a dinner for myself.  I started with the lobster bisque--5 stars!  It was atypical an delicious!  It has large pieces of lobster in it, which I've never been served before when I order the dish at other restaurants.  Then I had the crab cake ""appetizer"" as my entree and a side of sweet potato fries.  4 1/2 stars for the crab cakes--very little filler and lots of lump crab meat.  3 1/2 stars on the fries--delicious, and they sprinkle them generously with a cinnamon sugar mixture.  My husband started with the caesar salad, and then the cedar planked salmon and a baked potato.  In his words, all three items were solid 4's.  And we both agreed--the free onion bread--5 stars all the way!!!!  My disappointment was dessert.  We ordered the triple chocolate mousse (which the food runner called triple chocolate cake as he delivered it, so the house doesn't even know what it is) and it arrived still partly frozen.  Sorry, Oscar's, but please jump off the ""thawed-pre-made-desserts"" bandwagon and make your own.  Even if you specialized in just one or two and could recommend those to the customers and the rest were pre-made.

Decor and Ambience:  4 1/2 stars.  Near perfect.  ""Old School Vegas"" as my husband calls it, and what we were both hoping for.  So many places here in Las Vegas nowadays are some hip interior designer's idea of ""new and fancy.""  That has it's place and time, don't get me wrong, but I really do enjoy occasionally going to a place that makes me feel like I've stepped back in time.  Oscar's is definitely upscale, and has fashionable decor with it's faux-croc upholstered booths, and metallic chairs and couches, but still feels classic, and cliche as it may be, like I said, ""old school.""  My only caveat is the way the music ""competes.""  There is a live piano player in the bar, which is great for that area's ambience.  However, they play canned music in the dining room, and because the restaurant is not huge, when dining you hear both.  This not only makes for an overly loud atmosphere that makes hearing the waiter and your dining companion hard, but is annoying due to the two different battling tunes.  If anything, Oscar's, I would skip the piped music.

Final note-- The floating ""Broads"": Unnecessary and tacky.  They didn't approach us, I'm assuming because it was Valentine's Day, but they were there.  And I just find it insulting that Oscar's believes these women are appropriate for a restaurant that should be catering to couples with quite a bit of money to spend on a nice date night out.",sUN0W4KhYvHE3TGNd6cGGA,12,2,4,yZOBH_fjjVvZ0rExhUULfA

I ordered the filet with Bearnaise sauce, it was cooked to perfection. Husband ordered the crab stuffed jumbo shrimp and he loved them.

This may be the best experience we had during the entire visit - We each had the Filet with Oscar ""over the top"", the chopped salad, and creamed spinach.  Everything was delectable, with a huge thumbs up on the chopped salad!!  

Our server (turned sommelier) was extremely courteous and prompt and was very knowledgeable when it came to assisting us in choosing the perfect wine to pair with our meal - Like the food, the service was exceptional.

The atmosphere was perfect for Old Vegas and really encompasses the glitz and glam that one would expect.  My husband put it perfectly when he said he expected Dean Martin to walk in with a cigarette and a martini in hand!! The view of Fremont Street, the piano player, and the laid back ""lounge"" feel was just perfect.  

In closing, I will say that anyone visiting Vegas should not miss Oscar's!! Truly a top notch place!!",MJ2pFZQUxa9CHdLftfhp-w,0,0,5,zdUDKgpuLdt3bMv1KM7vRw

When entering the restaurant, the experience was much like entering a different era, politically incorrect and refreshing amidst the landscape of generic dining establishments, think Applebee's and TGI Friday's. But unfortunately, Oscar's sizzle has now been reduced to a mere fizzle - you know, the way January 2nd feels like.... The reception was less than stellar - do not dare to arrive 5 minutes before your planned reservation time unless you don't mind having to wait the extra 5 minutes anyway because these folks are clock-watchers. The view of Fremont Street was been permanently obstructed by this ridiculous Zipline monstrosity but who could fault the restaurant for that? The service was great, luckily those standards have not relaxed, but the food was mediocre at best. The Prime rib was lackluster, lacking in taste and colder than expected for a medium cut although medium rare was ordered. Mayor Carolyn, please stop by and sample the cut named after you - I would suspect you would have preferred to order the chicken dinner instead. The Ahi tuna was peppercorn encrusted and that's about all I tasted - Peppercorns - a hint of the flavor of tuna was not to be found. The side dish of asparagus was room temperature, ho-hum. But the biggest disappointment was the obvious lack of ""broads"" not that they really would have made the dining experience any more enjoyable, but hey! That's what is advertised and a good reason to go there, or so I thought. In summary, beef not so great, Booze okay, but isn't it everywhere else?, and Broads, well not around when we were there. I guess they need a day off too. But as a whole the restaurant itself has taken a day off. O how I long for the good ol' days of sizzle!",3fHpaLIiRBf1NiI4ZarmKg,0,0,2,z5xTIPTa-GyVDoc1esgLBQ

The bar staff is friendly, the food was delicious, and the price is wallet-friendly by Las Vegas steak place standards.

649997,2013-01-06,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"My friends and I were looking for a swanky yet informal restaurant at which to dine, when we stumbled upon one of the few olfactorily, not to mention visually, auspicious venues in the downtown area of Las Vegas.  Oscar's invited us in via its sophisticated leather-bound bar stools and perfect lighting.  After perusing the extensive wine list at the bar, we were lucky to be escorted into the main dining area which resembled a glass dome atrium which allowed diners to see everything on Main Street and feel as though we were dining at the top of skyscraper.  While basking in the ethereal beauty of the dome, we all remained puzzled as to the restaurant's gregarious tagline, ""Beef, Booze, and Broads"", which I am not ashamed to admit was another factor in getting us to eat at this intriguing establishment.  Thinking that the tagline simply referred to the finer things in life, we were taken by surprise when a tipsy showgirl sashayed on over to our table, whose bosoms and lips had been artificially enhanced so much that she seemed in constant danger of falling over.  Utterly pleased with how Oscar's had thusfar come through with its promise of broads, we bravely tackled the menu so as to experience the beef and booze.  After deciding on a bottle of Spanish Tempranillo, we decided to order a melange of dishes for the table to share.  As difficult as it was to choose, we decided to order the Spilotro-Style Flat Iron steak, the Alaskan King crab legs, the Cedar Plank Blackened salmon, a few orders of the Cardini's Two-Bit Caesar salad, Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese, Steamed Asparagus and Broccoli, and Ralph's Smashed potatoes.  The steak was perfectly cooked to a medium-rare state, as requested, and came brimming with delicious bits of barely cooked garlic, which might turn off your average garlic consumer, but not me, I reveled in its fiery goodness. The crab legs were moist and fresh, and we were tempted to order another serving because we went through the first one so quickly.  The salmon was cooked to perfection and we all watched it tenderly flake onto our forks, each bite brimming with its natural juices. Not being a huge fan of mac & cheese, I was prepared to have little opinion of the dish, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the pasta was not swimming in a cheese sauce, but had been appropriately baked with cheese and cream, so that the pasta had actually taken on some of the delicate cheese flavors, especially something that reminded me of a smokey gouda... c'est si bon!  The broccoli and asparagus were barely steamed (perhaps blanched?) which is exactly how they should be served, and acted as healthy palate cleansers.  Did I forget to mention the Tempranillo?  It was divine.  Each sip reminiscent of lazy, sunny days spent in the spanish countryside... not too tannic, not too acidic, and definitely not too fruity. We finished off our feast with espresso,cappuccinos and a tiramisu for the table to share.  The coffee was exquisite and balanced the delicate richness of the house-made tiramisu.  Overall, my colleagues and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would return in a heartbeat.  Bravo, Oscar!",kzqygmP7ihsZJEzy0dPp4A,0,0,4,8-cH85wiUCmjWJw8hCZIrg

892552,2012-10-06,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"If I had to rate this place on my personal experience I would have given it four stars. The view from the restaurant is amazing (inside and out) I had the french onion soup, absolutely amazing. And the chicken with artichoke and mashed potatoes entree, again amazing. The only thing that would have cost this restaurant a star was my broccoli side, unfortunately it came out cold (very cold) for being steamed broccoli.

Sadly I am rating this on our groups experience. We had a party of 8. everything went well from the start. Drinks, calamari (perfectly fried not greasy at all), and salads and my soup. Out of 7 salads one came out with a wrong dressing, not a big deal the salad was eaten anyways. It when the entrees came out that the whole dinner went downhill. Out of 8 entrees only 4 came out right. 2 of the guests who had each ordered the dinner special of the 22oz ribeye were presented with a prime rib, one guested ordered a filet mignon well done with a butterfly cut, received her filet but since it wasn't butterflied it was still very red in the center. Another guests prime rib topped with sauteed mushrooms came out with the mushrooms cold. (not to mention about 2 other orders of broccoli and 1 asparagus order also coming out cold)

The manager was quickly at our table apologizing and ensuring the food would be recooked...Which it was. First came out the new orders of broccoli and asparagus, so the guests ate just the veggies while the waited for the meat not wanting the broccoli to get cold a second time. Since a 22oz ribeye and the filet are rather big pieces of meat they took a long time to be brought up to the correct temperatures, the guests who were waiting (While the rest of us ate) were presented with a shrimp cocktail. A nice gesture but after appetizers and salads those who even liked shrimp were getting full and just wanted their meal. 

Finally the food came back out 2 beautiful ribeyes (Which tastes amazing too). Unfortunately again the filet came out butterflied cut but was STILL very red in the center, not acceptable after waiting 30+ minutes for it to be made a second time. We were offered desserts on the house but for those who ate we were all too full and the other half of the group just wanted to get out of the restaurant. We had asked for the check to be split 3 ways, again many problems (which I understand I am a server and splitting checks is a pain but not impossible!)  Finally after about another 20 minutes our checks were figured out and we could go.

The chopped salad is fantastic and is a meal in and of itself.  It is more than your typical chopped salad and has great texture from the candied pecans and onion strings.  

The chicken soup was just so-so.  I didn't eat most of it and wouldn't order it again.

The lobster tail is incredible.  You can order it as an add-on to any other entree.  One of our guests ordered a steak and I had the lobster tail as my entree.  I wish that you could order the lobster by itself, so if two of us go and we both want lobster and nothing else, we can get it.  And, perhaps you can and the waiters will accommodate, but from the menu, it clearly states that you can add on the lobster to an entree.  

The side dish combinations are also a good selection.  You can pick any 3 sides for $15.  We've had mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and baked potato.  All delicious.  We've also ordered the Ahi sashimi as an appetizer and it didn't disappoint.

The view from the dome is incredible.  Make a reservation for dinner when the Fremont Street Experience light show will be on, and ask to sit near the window.  You won't hear the music, but you will see a great light show and possibly some interesting characters!  Oscar's also has some fantastic live music at the bar, who will entertain you as you sip cocktails.  

Buxom ladies walk around and visit you at your table (hence, the ""broads,"" in ""Beef, Booze, and Broads"").  It's kind of corny and slightly uncomfortable, but I won't hold it against Oscar's.  It's not like Vegas is known for being a refined and classy place.  If sequinned and silicone'd vixens are going to fit in anywhere, it's Vegas.",IoBj-2_XaOx3AZljDKvdlA,0,0,5,QtkvhW38lgypHRATeUjpBw

986372,2014-01-10,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"I have been in search of 3 things in this town. 

1. Good Service 
2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home. 
3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.

After eating at Oscar's Steakhouse on Wednesday I can say I'm still looking! 

I'll start with the service.  
We arrived just before 6pm and were quickly seated in the main room with an amazing view. We were in a booth that sat a little higher then the tables so it really made us feel special. However, looking back I can't imagine being sat anywhere else because...we were the only people there. In other words the entire restaurant was ours! Before my bottom was on my seat our waiter (Frank) and his helper (David) were right at our service asking if it was our first time at Oscar's. As we tried to remove our jackets and find a comfortable position in the booth Frank kept charging on with the history of the restaurant and his long and distinguished service career as a waiter. As my arm was coming out of my jacket I found David waving the menu in my face for me to look at. Two seconds later Frank was ready to take our order. After stepping over Franks conversation about him working during the Johnson administration, I found my self raising my voice to notify him that we would like to look over the menu first for a while. Once he finally left the table we couldn't help but laugh about the amount of excitement we must have brought to the place. It was like we were the only people to eat there in days. Franks willingness to drop by our table and ""chat"" about his many travels as a waiter never seemed to tire. As it stands Frank has to go down as the kindest, pushiest waiter I've ever had. I took the time to put our most memorable interactions with him below. 

1.
Frank
""You ready to order"".
My girlfriend 
""Just a few more moments please""
Frank
""Well you have to order now because I'm going to get busy soon""
My girlfriend
""Oh""
2.
Frank
""What would you like miss""?
My girlfriend 
""I'll take the flank steak""
Frank
""You sure""?
My girlfriend 
""Yes""
Frank 
""Do you know what a flank steak is""?
My girlfriend 
""Yes""
Frank
""So you know it's chewy""
My girlfriend
""Chewy""?
Frank
""Ya Chewy and hard to eat""
My girlfriend 
""That's not a good way to describe a steak""
Frank
""Well it's the truth""

Now for the food
After being forced into it my girlfriend got the filet mignon ($32) and I tried the veal ($40). We also decided to get a side of asparagus($9) and another well poured martini ($17). Once at the table it became apparent that the kitchen was also in an unnecessary hurry. Because the presentation was terrible. Her steak was alone on the plate and my veal was just the opposite, it was  pouring over the plate! On top of my extra large portion was a pound of greens that sloppily covered the breaded veal. As I fished down the forest of greens to cut a bite I got lost and ended up cutting a bite of fat. Once in my mouth I quickly noticed that it wasn't meat so I spit it out on the plate. Then I took another bite....it tasted exactly the same as the first!! It seems that the breading was so thick that all you could taste was the grease that it was cooked in. Needless to say, I could cook veal better myself, My girlfriends steak was small but good. However, she can definitely cook a better steak at home as well. Nothing about the food was worth going back for. 

About the bill
To sum it all up...this place is in need of some direction and managment to get a handle on what the kitchen is putting out and control the service staff. It feels like they spend more time on the name of the dishes then anything else. The food is tasteless, the presentation is comical, and the staff is pushy.  They have a great name, great location, and amazing potential but it's obvious that repeat business is not a priority.  
Here is my free advise:

First step, lower the prices. The food is not better then what my friends or I can cook at home so don't charge more then $17.00 for your most expensive meal. 
Second, drop the a la carte crap and include some sides with each meal. 
Finally, add a table wine that won't break the bank so people can have fun and let loose without spending their paycheck on drinks.",SUnbwW60dJZnxciYgtTGYQ,4,0,2,XILS551umlpb1AxLz8354Q

1057573,2016-02-06,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"It is with a heavy heart that I write this review for Oscar's.  I'm like most Las Vegans and adore our former mayor. I want everything Oscar Goodman touches to turn to gold. And I have such a high regard for his taste, that this restaurant, at least in my mind, should be one of the best steakhouses in town.

As it stands, I'll have to tell people to avoid it.  In short, after the ""case of the raw gratin potatoes"", I can say with certainly that I won't be back to Oscar's. 

This was my second trip to Oscars and when I visited last year, I enjoyed the steaks and sides. While I did not love any of it, I was so taken with the ambiance, the style, and use of the space that there was no question that I would be back.  There is no other place like this in our city--they serve great drinks in an iconic space. And it manages to capture that glamorous feeling of old-Vegas. 

We didn't see any broads this visit, but one can't help but enjoy the view and the established feeling of it all. 

The problem on the return trip was the food. Period. In fairness, I came to a steakhouse and ate the salmon, so feel free to disregard my comments, but my experiences speak to an overall level of quality. 

Here's the thing---while I was satisfied with my piece of fish and hubby was pleased with his fillet, no one else was happy with the quality of their protein. Our friend with the shrimp dish found the shrimp to be overcooked and our friends with prime rib stated (and it was visually obvious) that it was not presented at the temperatures requested.

Those things I could overlook, and was ready to overlook even as we talked and laughed and ate, but the there was snafu with one side dish that I am still shocked by. The au gratin was a disaster.  We received a pale looking item in a small ramekin type dish. I had the first scoop when it hit the table and it was cool. Not completely ice cold, but slightly cooler than room temperature.  And there was not one piece of melted cheese on the dish. Even the top was a creamy white chopped mix. There was no sprinkle of yellow or bunt orange or crusty brown anywhere. I still took a bite because my brain hadn't processed what was wrong with the dish. The flavor was disconcerting--it was bitter. I chewed and offered a bite to another table mate to get a second opinion. She agreed that something was wrong with the dish, but neither of us spent too much time thinking about it as we ate.  

We were celebrating that night and didn't want to think about the potatoes that were...crunchy and toothsome and the fact that there seemed to be no cheese. Before the waitress came to pick up the dishes I stated to the table that I thought the dish might have been raw. But with the conversation shifting and Occam's razor in full effect, I talked myself out of that ridiculous guess. We were celebrating Brad's birthday and I didn't want to spend any more time bemoaning a weak dish. People were dissatisfied enough with the main dishes that they had already eaten and I didn't want to add to anyone's dissatisfaction.

But the raw gratin kept gnawing at me. Was I wrong? Was this how they served their potatoes? When I got home, I went through some Yelp photos of others' experiences looking specifically for a picture of their au gratin potatoes. I can count the number of times I have ordered and/or eaten them, so I didn't trust the clear voice telling me the ugly truth.

 One look at Dennis T's pic of a yellow, golden cheesy crust that had clearly been baked in the dish provided all of the evidence I needed in the case of the ""raw gratin"". They had absolutely served us raw au gratin. 

Add to that the fact that hubby asked for a Diet Coke and was served a Diet Pepsi. I don't fault them for serving Pepsi products, but why didn't our server stop and clarify at the time the order was placed?  

Mid-meal a manager came by and asked how everything was. There were an awkward few moments of silence and one friend stated flatly, ""It's OK."" And the manager never followed up. 

Mistakes happen and certainly are forgivable. But for this mistake to go unnoticed  means that someone in the kitchen put them up raw, the expediter and/or secondary server saw them and found them acceptable to served to use and they were placed on our table raw and pale and anemic . Then when we were finished, our waitress saw the generally untouched pure white raw gratin and never said a word. 

That's a problem for me. I can easily forgive a raw dish at a casual diner (although I've never been served one) or at a mom and pop spot (although I've never been served one). But not at an ""upscale"" steakhouse ""tailored to meet the tastes of even the most discerning diners"". 

In fairness to Oscar's, I called and let a manger know about the issue the next day.  But the damage is done. There was a breakdown in both the food preparation and in the service. There are too many great steakhouses in this town for me to seek out another experience at Oscar's.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,8,0,2,AAqJbAndHn_0wifbpZ2lLA

The view straight down Fremont Street is great, other than the new Zip line ride blocking the view under construction.  How does a guy who used to be the mayor and is married to the current mayor allow a Zip line to block the view at his own restaurant?  I'm guessing when construction is completed it wont be as obtrusive..........Or else.  

The Prime rib was extra tasty.  Burt's hint - Order it one degree under what you would usually order it at.  

Mom ordered the Schnitzel and loved it. Also the Caroline cocktail.  Burt's broad ordered the Halibut.  She didn't ""love"" it, but if you ask Burt, what the hell is this broad ordering Halibut for in a steakhouse?  

For a side make sure you order the corn.  It was great.  The mac and cheese and the au gratin potatoes were OK.

Overall the food was mostly good.  For  starters we had a the chopped salad and the crab cakes.  I love a good salad, but this one was not it.  The avocado was perfectly ripe, but under-seasoned.  Everything was piled together in this very creamy, bland heap.  The salad also had large pieces of fresh herb that became overpowering when you bit into it.  So it was both bland and overpowering.  I know that is a contradiction, but there it is.
The crab cakes were delicious with large chunks of crab just barely held together.
My NY strip was cooked perfectly with a fabulous crust.  Though I wish I hadn't opted for the au poivre sauce.  We shared a corn brulee side, which was good.
The cheesecake was not that good, don't bother.
Service was friendly but extremely rushed.  We had our second course arrive while we were still eating our first course.  Then they started clearing dishes while I was still eating my steak.

On my first visit, we only stayed in the bar and enjoyed their great bar appetizers.  Crab cakes, steak tartare and huge chilled shrimp.  All are as good as can be had.

This next visit on a Thursday night we were seated in a great booth that was used in the movie Casino.  Great views of Fremont street.

We shared fried Calamari, a Caesar salad a huger bakes potato and one of the best pieces of prime rib I've had in Las Vegas.  I usually will only eat prime rib in lieu of steaks and have eaten at many steakhouses in Vegas.

Valet parking was a little bit confusing since we pulled up and there was no valet guy...or girl...present. Since I was waiting and causing a little traffic in the small driveway just outside the restaurant, a security guard told me to go around again. When I went around again, I saw the valet guy show up and he was chillin' at his booth. WTH?! We had to flag him down and tell him that we're eating at the restaurant. We got out, got our valet ticket and he parking our car at the front of the hotel.

We walked into the hotel to go upstairs to the restaurant. The hostess was able to sit us immediately. Here is when it really went south. Our assigned waiter to our table was nowhere to be found after 10 minutes looking at the menu. We haven't even placed our drink orders in yet. My wife wanted to walk out. I had to flag down another waiter who was taking care of another table and ask how come we weren't served yet. He at least took over drink orders. He came back with our drinks and told us the waiter that is assigned to our table was no where to be found. Thumbs down! I was so nice and HANGRY that I told my wife that let's give this place a try. The waiter who I flagged down volunteered to be our waiter for the night.

Our volunteer waiter was 'okay' since he had to take care of an additional table and the tables he was assigned to take care of. It took him a little longer for him to take care of each table which is understandable. 

As for the for the whiskey cocktail I ordered that had an orange juice taste to it was good. I forgot what it was called. I ordered a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon which is good as I would expect it to be. As for the food, we split a rib-eye and shared a side of corn and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked the way we wanted it...medium. The corn and mashed potatoes were cooked well and not dry. In short, the food was great compared to the lack of a waiter.

We didn't bother for dessert. My wife was not happy at the end of the night even though the food was great. She wanted to get out of there so fast, I paid cash and we did not bother to ask for change.

Just getting an uber or the bus to get there and back takes over an hour of your time. 

The restaurant in itself is not huge the hostess was not very professional never spoke to us just seated us and left. 

Our waitress we did enjoy she had been there several years very dry personality that we got and enjoyed thankfully - I can see it going different for some people though.

We ordered the crab cakes - the crab cakes were the best out of the entire meal I promise you. There is a reason people rave about these on numerous reviews. Never have I ever had a more fresh crab cake! Their bread was the next best thing of our entire meal including the steaks. Their bread was fresh and had onions baked into it. Very different and very delicious. I'm shocked we didn't ask for a second loaf! Their serving/helping of everything is very generous! 

Also, we dressed up in a dress and my husbands wore khakis - don't feel like you have to in this place we were the most overdressed in the entire dining room. People were wearing jeans and baseball caps. The entire dining room itself overlooks freemont street so really no view is a bad view. 

My husband really enjoyed the asparagus I thought it was so so. The mac and cheese definitely was mediocre. The filets weren't near tasty as I have back in Oklahoma. No seasoning it seemed like.

When we walked out we felt as If we wasted our evening coming all the way to freemont for this deal.

You can pay a small fortune to eat at the table of a famous chef or, at the other end of the spectrum, you can eat well for a modest price at places like Lotus of Siam, arguably one of the best Thai restaurants in the country. I find the middle ground somewhat difficult to navigate.

I found myself in LV last night - just for the night. My husband told me to make a reservation at Oscar's, where he'd eaten a couple times. He said I'd like it. The experience was perfect from the moment we walked through the door. 

We were seated at a window table overlooking Freemont Street. I loved the view. The waiter walked over, greeted us by name and introduced himself. His name was Bobby. He may have been the best waiter I've ever had and as often as I eat out, that's saying something. He offered recommendations, explained the preparation of various dishes and handled our requests flawlessly. He was funny, charming and dedicated. Since we were sharing several things he even sliced our steak into strips and set the plate between us so we could each take pieces without the hassle of cutting it up - a service that the kitchen charges $8 for. He told us he just considers it customer service and if they aren't slammed he does it.

We ate:

BREAD AND BUTTER: Not something I often mention but it was incredible! Hot and soft and flavorful with onion and delicious whipped butter. We ate two baskets of it! Well, truthfully we brought one home. 
CORN AND CRAB BISQUE: Absolutely delicious. It was crazy hot so take care with the first bite. Also, crab isn't nearly as good as lobster in a bisque.
SURF AND TURF: Ribeye was cooked to perfection. We barely needed a knife to cut it. Shrimp was stuffed with crab cakes and served in a light flavorful sauce. I ate more of the steak and my husband ate more of the shrimp. We were both very happy.
CORN BRULEE: I would eat this every night! They roast sweet corn, cut it off the cob and bake it with a cream sauce and parmesan. My mouth is watering just writing about it.
MAC & CHEESE: Very good. Nothing unique but baked in a cast iron dish. Yummy.
BRUSSELS SPROUTS: Also really good. I'm not raving about these sides because they were great but that corn...

Start to finish we had an incredible time. The food, setting and service were all five star. If you read this review and decide to go to Oscar's ask for Bobby. You won't be sorry. He really was the best waiter I've ever had.",v-gCiEr8vr9JnMkkR5Uq_A,7,2,5,6aq-A7obr8BLQ532J-zIZQ

I was not a fan of the calamari (too small and mostly breading). The meatballs were flavorful, I just hoped that they were served with some kind of bread to dip in the sauce, they also served them barely warm which was another minus. 
Now, for the best part: the crab cakes; I can finally say that I found the best crab cake place in town.

Oscars has fun history and a view, and a broad that walks around and visits at your table, very old Vegas which I so love.

The only thing negative I can say was when we were in the bar the one and only cocktail waitress failed to let us know that it was ladies night and women drank for free. I knew that seeing it on the website where I made our reservation that night, so I  was surprised she did not mentioned it to us as she did  so happily to the gals sitting right next to us. ALL LADIES..

 My conclusion to that was because I was with a guy and not just women she chose not to let us know, and I felt it was a mistake on her part. Is that upcharging on her behalf ? Im not sure.

There really  should  be no discrimination on ladies night if that was Oscar's offer. We enjoyed our bar time, with some disappointment, but entering the dining room and enjoying the excellent service and view took away from our prior event in the bar.

I was mighty reluctant as the signage denoted ""beef, beer and broads."" So I instantly thought it was some type of sports bar. NOPE. It's a high end steak house that is well worth a visit.

Named for the former mayor of Las Vegas, Oscar Goodman, Oscar's sits above the hustle and bustle of the Fremont Street Experience and is beautifully decorated. We sat in a perfectly situated booth that was extremely comfy. As we walked to the table I felt like we were in a movie about mafia drug lords. But it was a great experience.

The prices were more than I wanted to spend, but when I got the food it was TOTALLY worth it. My partner and I had the surf and turf and added a piece of blackened salmon to it. It was delicious. I don't mean that lightly either. I HATE steak, despise it and this was THE BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD. With the surf and turf came crab stuffed shrimp with tomatoes and grilled artichokes. These, too, were delicious (and I hate artichokes).

We tried three sides: the mashed potatoes, asparagus and the Mac-n-cheese. It stands to mention that the sides are served family style and can be shared between parties. I enjoyed all the sides we ordered. The asparagus was cooked perfectly. It still tasted fresh. The mac-n-cheese was delicious! Creamy and plentiful. The mashed potatoes were equally as good.

The service was impeccable. I was very happy with the attention and expertise of or server Lorene. She was incredibly professional, yet personable and friendly. Very attentive to our needs.

Located on the 2nd floor of the Plaza hotel, it faces the beginning of the fremont street experience. Upon entry from the MAIN ENTRANCE of the restaurant (not the back elevator or whatever), there are photos of some ""famous people"" who had dined at this restaurant including the current (sigh...) and the former 3 US presidents as well as some others like Celine Dion, etc.

The restaurant has a huge dome like design with glass panels so view is barely hindered by anything. The restaurant is really brightly lit by natural lighting during the day and looks a whole lot better inside than it does outside. 

Service was really fast as soon as we were seated. My water cup never went below 50% empty. Our waiter, Bobby, was fairly attentive to us during our visit. There was a little confusing part when we were ordering but was clarified pretty easily. Bobby even apologized for it even though it was not entirely his fault. I asked him for the ""bone in specials"" as directed on the menu, and that had my friend, who was also the birthday boy, change his decision REAL FAST ! lol he originally was dead set on getting the bone in rib eye. The second the waiter had mentioned a special on a 42 oz tomahawk steak, i saw his eyes and smile widen !! Him and his friend opt'ed to get the tomahawk with lobster tail combo. I dont remember the prices exactly but the tomahawk itself was in the $90s. I dont remember how much it was as a combo. 

I opted for the bone in rib eye steak ($64). We had saw they offered a ""special"" (not really) of any 3 sides for $22. Why i said not really is because it was printed on the menu. so its not really a ""special"" per se.. But it still saves you money if you intend to get 3 sides. Their sides average $7-9 dollars each, so  if you get all $9 ones, saves u 5 bucks. Other things ordered in the party were the ""Spicy Flame Charred Spoilotro Steak"", ""Sally's New York Strip (Prime)"", ""Johnny Quinn's Crab Cake"" (by recommendation of a couple who were leaving the restaurant while we were waiting), ""Jasper & Hunchy's Tomato Salad), and some sides. 

SIDE NOTE - so apparently they give different knives. A larger knife for the males, and a smaller knife for the females... LOL REFER TO PICTURE ! 

Tomahawk Steak w/ Lobster Tail - to be honest, it didnt look like 42 oz when it came out. Probably more in the 30s. Bone is a little shorter than i've seen for tomahawks. The steak was ordered medium. The center was borderline rare. Cool red center. The birthday boy loved it though. He had no complaints !

Oscar's Bone-In Ribeye ($64) - Not sure the size of the steak but id probably say around 16oz or so. Ordered medium rare, came out a towards medium in the center. The exterior of the steak had a really nice char to it. The cap was really tender. Overall the seasoning was really good. Wished it was slightly less cooked as i had ordered in the eye portion though

Spicy Flame Charred Spilotro Steak ($29) - A well seasoned skirt steak, as described ! Infused with garlic, red chili fakes ! The kick it had was actually much more than i had expected from a steakhouse. As my friend and I love eating spice, we were both quite surprised. Seasoned well. Well made skirt steak ! 

Johnny Quinn's Crab Cake ($19) - this was recommended by a passing couple that just finished their dinner as they were leavin the restaurant and we were standing in front. They highly recommended the crab cake as it was a ""crab ball"" and is one of the best they've ever had. They weren't kidding. Two large balls of a crab cake arrived with some stone ground mustard and a pepper remoulade. The crab was very tender and sweet. Not overpowered by any veggies or seasoning some others may do. The crab was definitely the star ! The ground mustard was subtle and not overpowering as some may be. Paired well with the crab. Preferred the mustard over the pepper remoulade. 

Jasper & Hunchy's Tomato Salad - seasonal (red, yellow, orange) tomatoes with burrata cheese, EVOO, and micro greens. (drizzled with a balsamic reduction on top). YUMMY ! apparently burrata is a combination of mozzarella on the outside with 2 other cheeses in the middle creating a soft interior with the ""normal"" mozzarella outside. very clean, simple, but delicious dish ! 

As for sides, we got the ""Jose Leonardo Roasted Corn Brulee"", ""Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese"" and ""Steak Fries"". The roasted corn was the best of the 3. Fresh chewy corn, not mushy. Was a bit saddened there was a lack of ""brulee"" part. Was hoping to crack through something when i first dug into the side dish. The mac & cheese was most underwhelming. Using gemelli pasta, it was yeah a rich creamy pasta but nothing too special. The steak fries were fried well with a soft, fluffy interior. I'd probably prefer the fries over the mac. 

Overall, good experience ! Good place to try in downtown !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,14,4,4,rF4Lwurp7fahXz2aL7XlKQ

This was quite shocking actually~ especially for a big name restaurant/bar in Vegas.

 First Issue~ seated ourselves in the bar....no one approached us, a manager did walk past us, after 12 min my husband got up asked the hostess if there was a cocktail service? She responded yes & pointed to a girl talking to friends at the bar....we did finally get our drinks delivered by the manager who walked past us 20 min earlier.. No napkins & NO olives in the Martini 
     The table behind was having similar service issues, until someone who is running for Judge joined them, then their service was golden~ except NO cocktail napkins either~  WTF? Even dive bars in the middle of nowhere give u a napkin under ur Beer  
   Our server (who needs training and lots of it!) Tosha recognized our displeasure & did comp our drinks.

1441220,2012-04-08,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Having met the man twice and finding him quite the entertaining character, I decided to try the restaurant inspired by him. Oscar Goodman. The (formerly) happiest mayor on earth. And former mob defense attorney. He and his image are quintessential Vegas. I had to try his steakhouse. 

Entering with a coworker at 8 pm on a Monday night, we were seated right away. Service can only be described as short and surly. From the hostess to the two servers we encountered, I consistently got the strong impression they were looking at their watches in anticipation of closing time. A stark contrast to, say, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse over at Golden Nugget (see separate review). 

The menu is mob-inspired, consisting of names of gangsters you'll recognize. I went with the Spilatro's Steak with garlic mashed potatoes. It may not look like much from the attached photo, bit it was actually quite good. 

The restaurant is adorned with photos of Oscar and his career. I think the theme works fine here, and the location is great. It's in the area formerly occupied by Firefly, directly at the West end of Fremont Street. The dining area over looks the Fremont Street Experience. It's an excellent view. 

All in all, the food was good. The theme was fun. But the service not so much. I'm always deeply disappointed when a place gets so much right and then just drops it all at customer service. How do other places like Vic's get it right consistently and places like this don't? I think it starts at the top. Carefully screening the right personalities to hire and then training and evaluating them. Consistently. 

Oscar's needs to make an attempt, here. And until they do, the servers will bring down the house. This may be why there was so much open seating at 8 pm during Spring Break week. 

I sincerely hope they do bring it around because I'd like to see this place survive. If enough people point this out to them, maybe they will.",NOWHAb-N0BBLVc_WPklY7w,7,2,2,ZYKg1Kg_g3EU4msaMuBZYQ

1617138,2012-01-07,14,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Hmmmm, a lot of Orangehead glowing reviews. Seems a bit suspicious to me.

I was at Oscar's earlier in the week and did not have the phenomenal experience as some of these alleged Yelp rookies. As a fan of old school Vegas, I was very excited when a Vegas native recommended this to me. ""Beef, Booze, and Broads"" sounds like something Dean, Sammy and Frank would frequent so I was excited. Overall, Oscar's left me grouchy despite the fantastic view of Sesame, I mean Fremont St.

First off, let's get the location out of the way. The wall of windows provides and exciting or romantic atmosphere, depending on your purpose. Unfortunately, a half empty dining room on a weeknight does not inspire the staff to seat you unless you decide to pony up for the companionship of a ""broad""

So let's discuss this elephant in the room. They have ""broads"" who roam the room looking to spark conversations with customers. OK, I am cool with that. You're supposed to buy them a drink. Uhhh, OK! And then dinner....and then tip them? An acquaintance bought into the ploy (although in fairness, the girl did not push that hard). Her glasses of wine and entree tacked on $50 to the bill and then we had to tip. We were celebrating and not afraid to drop some cash but it seems that the restaurant should have done a better job of explaining the concept. As it was our reunion of buds was continually interrupted by these broads.

The service was slow but engaging. several of us were put off by the fact that their cuts of meat were ""choice"" but charged ""prime"" prices. The consensus was that they were OK but not worthy of the price. The sides were uninspiring. 

Oscar's is new so maybe it will improve. Also, being from Dallas, we do steakhouses like nobody's business so perhaps my standards are high. For a cheaper prices at Nick & Sam's or Pappas' I can get a steak that will put Oscar's to shame and some adult mac n' cheese with lobster that will make me swoon. Go, enjoy Oscar's view, and beware.

I had made reservations to dine here after the show that was at The Smiths Center and although we arrived  here 15 minutes later than the reservation the hostess who seated us and our server and the guys at the bar were all very hospitable and welcoming.   I didn't even have a clue they were closed when we arrived.  Only when I asked what the hours were was when our server told us they closed at 10pm right when we had arrived.  He said not to worry he already had let the chef know that he had seated us and another party who also came from the show.
   
After hearing what the specials were for the evening I decided on Surf and Turf...Lobster and Filet Mignon. I totally forgot to find out the cost(sorry!)  I know the prices for entrees on the menu were in line with other steakhouses in the area. Our bill came to under 15o bucks so pretty much average for 2 steak, sides, desserts and drinks.   

Now this is steak! High quality, grass fed. Light char and  when sliced it was like butta and flavorful! Ordering it med rare is the way to go.  No wonder it's #5 in top steakhouses on the strip.  I told Mr. B. this steak so far tops the other steakhouse we dined at last month. The lobster..was a good sized portion too. Either I was super hungry or my meal was so good because I cleaned up my plate. (and those of you who know me know that's very rare!) 

The ambiance has a throwback feel of the old Vegas era. The servers have pin striped vest with white ties ala mob inspired. The restaurant is located the dome area of the revamped Plaza Hotel so it has an open airy feel to it. Colors of white and silver, and the trio of huge crystal chandeliers gives it a touch of elegance. This sets the tone for dressy casual wear.  I'd leave the shorts and tanks in your hotel room, but the vibe is casual and friendly enough where you wont feel like an outcast if you are under dressed.  The added bonus of this restaurant are the views from your table or booth. You can catch the Fremont Street Experience light show from this restaurant.
  
Service as mentioned was excellent. Our server Ray was pretty easy going.  In fact us, our server and the table across from us were all conversing about the Burt Bacharach show we saw. I told him I'm making it a point to make sure I'm seated in his area next time I book a reservation.  The runners kept our table cleaned, crumbed our table and kept our drinks filled. Oscar's ""Broad"" Vanna made the rounds and came to our table in her showgirl outfit.

For the sake that someone looking up this review wondering who is Oscar...It's your Hizzoner! Former Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman and yes this is his restaurant.  ..and yes this is the where they filmed some scenes from the move ""Casino"" where he played himself the mob lawyer! ..it's not why we wanted to dine here but real happy we did.

I think Mayor Goodman sucked all of the charisma out of his sommelier, because she was more dry than a New Zealand Savignon Blanc.  

The service was outstanding, and personable.  Very much what you would expect from Oscar himself.  Try ""Crazy Phil's Onion Soup"" to start, and definitely save room for dessert.  

High marks for the latkes and the schnitzel from the table.  Go early to get a view of the Fremont Street experience, or ask for a table with a view when you make your reservation.  Certainly worthwhile.  Enjoy.",xtB67YuRwbbNFAuwbolqfg,1,1,4,W3tGM4h6vXd4rvI_OV0VYg

I feel like the valet/shuttle BS is on The Plaza and not Oscars, and I would definitely recommend the restaurant. Read below for the original review:


Beware the ""free"" shuttle to the Smith Center, there is fine print. Et tu Oscar?!?

Food 4/5
Service 4/5
Experience 4.5/5

Full disclosure: the restaurant experience is great. I'll review that first.

We were seated in the main dining area. It's an airy, bright, but old school feel steak house. The circular dining room is unique, and the window ceiling is so cool. I really enjoyed the early evening meal under the Vegas lights.

I had the bone-in filet and the wife had the 8 oz filet. Cooked to order, tasted like it was seared under a salamander, had a nice salt and pepper crust that was not intrusive. Bone in was a good value at $55. Service was on par with a standard nice restaurant. Prompt water refills, and staff was cognizant of our need to make our show time, which makes the end of the evening so confusing.

One of the reasons we were attracted to Oscars (besides the reputation), was that the restaurant had a free shuttle to the Smiths Center. We had no problem with the valet or the shuttle driver but to our surprise when we returned we found out there was a $15 charge to pick up our car.

I hate posting reviews where something like this sours the experience but it felt like such a bait and switch I couldn't help the deduction. The ironic part is that if I had known it was $15 to valet ahead of time I wouldn't be upset. Instead I felt cheated. With the number of options in Vegas, and most places not looking to nickel and dime you, I'm sure there's a better option. Try Golden Steer or Top of Binions, I've never felt cheated at either.

Perhaps if they are more upfront on the policy or realize that a nice dinner and a show takes more than four hours I may return, but until then let this review serve as a warning to potential theater goers. Learn from our mistake.",Fhius40l4G-Dc0Zdou9HSg,0,0,4,raGlFasK4XCesoWhUgfxVA

The view is OK given you look over a bunch of kiosks and half naked girls pushing slushie drinks that frankly look a little trashy.  After all , are I not sitting in an upscale restaurant owned by the previous mayor of Las Vegas?  Confusing, yes.
The bar is nice and roomy, however dining room jammed a little.  Menu: Cute and named after Mobsters so its a step away from culinary standards.  I think ONLY McDonalds has silly names for food. A little trendy and silly for a serious restaurant.  Did I say serious.
I ordered the fish and it tasted very ammonia old like even 8 lemons are not going to help this.
My date ordered a steak, which wasn't anything special, but most certainly beef.

Creme Brule: Had better at a buffet.

This is not a serious restaurant, so know that if you go here.

However off their own website 

  ""addition to great food, Oscar's Beef * Booze * Broads pairs a great meal with the unique opportunity to have one of Oscar's ""Broads"" visit with customers during dinner. These attractive women will be dinner companions who can discuss subjects such as politics, sports, wine, Las Vegas history or things to do downtown or on the Strip. When not dining with customers, they will roam the Downtown Las Vegas restaurant as hostesses, adding to the glamorous and uniquely Vegas style of Oscar's""

Women are not ""Broads"" and when I saw this form of what borders on what looks like some weak form of prostitution I don't even think this restaurant should be allowed to operate.

My husband and I were in Vegas a few weekends ago, and decided to step out of our Hugo's Cellar routine and try Oscars.  We had heard good things, Yelp had good reviews, so we gave it a shot.

I ordered the pepper and garlic infused steak, the waitress explained that this rough cut of meat becomes very tender due to the time it's marinated.  While the flavor was good, the meat was TOUGH.  I ate about 20% of my steak and the rest went to waste.  My husband, who will pretty much eat anything, said my steak was awful.

My husband said his order of steak was good, but needed additional salt.

Our sides: potatoes and asparagus.  The potatoes... OMG, SO GOOD!  The asparagus was awful... it was woody, oversized, and tough.

For the amount we paid, I was pretty disappointed by the time we walked out of there.  Our waitress was slammed busy, so didn't really allow me the time to bring up my concerns, so I left... I ended up ""needing"" an order of fries from the hot dog place at The D later that night.  ;)

Most disappointing of all... I called the next day to let a manager know of my disappointment with my steak and asparagus, and the fact that I paid all that money for stuff that went to waste.  I was told one wasn't available, but I left my name and number.  I still have no returned call.  :(",1_EY5gz6Izpg-xSoJfhNDw,1,0,2,aP8ok4i_5PxhyEJvdow-5A

The one overlooking Fremont Street in fabulous downtown Las Vegas. Take the escalator to the 2nd floor and you will see Oscar's Beef, Booze, and Broads steakhouse.

Service was friendly, informed, and efficient. Food was quite wonderful. Being locals, we were delighted to see a Las Vegas legend on the menu ... Alpine Village's Chicken Noodle Soup. Not your typical chicken noodle soup, but so savory and satisfying!  Now I do recall the Alpine Village restaurant, but never enjoyed their chicken noodle soup, so I am not sure how Oscars' version compares. I hope a Yelper who has first hand knowledge will share their ""soupinion"".

We had a window table, close to the center of the dome, with a fun and entertaining view of the people parade on Fremont street below. 

Our entrées, the Halibut Special and Bone-In Prime Rib, were fabulous! Halibut was perfectly cooked, and the prime rib was ginormous, medium well, and still tender. Oscar's horsey sauce is top-notch as well; perfectly balanced to our taste. We ordered the creamed spinach and mac and cheese for sides. Both were good, albeit slightly under-seasoned, but adding a little salt/pepper was an easy fix.

Splurging for dessert, I chose the Creme Brulee, and he had the Tiramisu (both made in-house). I actually thought I was full after dinner, but somehow that magical creme brulee vanished mysteriously into my mouth within seconds. It was crazy good!  The tiramisu was yummy too, but the CB still makes my mouth water.

Not so crazy about the ""broads"" aspect ... Nice enough ladies, but the whole bit felt kind of like being visited by an annoying mariachi band with tits. I am not sure I would want to wander a room full of strangers, wearing an evening dress, like a puppy begging for attention, making small talk and then expecting the strangers to pay for that privilege. Awkwaaaard! 

Overall, a fun and enjoyable dining experience, and the bar appeared to be hoppin' as well. We also thought that the cool smoking lounge outside the restaurant/cocktail lounge was a nice touch, appreciated, and thoroughly enjoyed.",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,9,7,4,JQtvKVa4Oc1BAbEP00CNFQ

Food was good but the service...  first off even though we were sat at 9:30pm we were still rushed to order, literally, even though we obviously were studying the cocktail menu it was our food order they asked for first. After our steak was served my birthday wife was dying for a nice glass of red wine to match up with the steak it took way too long for a server to check back! Why I said unfortunately it was my wife's birthday is the key!! So our server was nice enough to treat her to a dessert for her birthday but when we asked about the desserts she said it's going to be a slice of cheesecake; we asked to see the dessert menu; she responded ""i can't afford any other dessert for her!"" Firstly; as if she's actually paying for it, and secondly: all the desserts are 7$!!  So before we got a chance to order a dessert they put the cheesecake in front of her! I would have rather paid $7 to give her what she wants on her birthday! I'm already paying  $60 for a steak! So now when it comes to her birthday dessert we have to settle for what they have in mind, rather than me spending $7 to give my birthday girl what she wants?!?!? But that's not even the end of the story! I ordered her a glass of ice wine$25! (But, once again;how dare we choose our own  $7 dessert) from inniskillin, where i grew up. I though it would be a good pairing with that stupid cheesecake that was forced upon her. This is where it gets crazy!!!! We both swear that the wine was watered down!! I know that's  a big accusation, but it's viscosity was like water (i grew up where it's from,so i know!) And you could just taste the watered down flavor of it. So I'm assuming that it was the last of the bottle and they added water to get it up to the level in the glass to be acceptable! Poor birthday girl!!!

They seated us in the dining room facing main st. I have to say, Slotzilla is a monstrosity & eyesore and not a great view for the steakhouse. Even worse, from the restaurant you get the worst view of the eyesore-the back of it. Ughhh. I know it's not the restaurants fault & no stars deducted on this note. 

The service was decent throughout the night. Our server was attentive, brought the food, and followed up. There were a couple of ladies (the broads? Lol) - not Oscars customary showgirls- walking around talking to diners. They asked if we're local, do we know why it's called oscars, do you know who Oscar is, etc. Im not a huge fan of being bothered while I'm eating out. But maybe the tourists get a kick out of the history tidbits. 

The food was pretty good, not 5 star quality, but good nonetheless. They serve complimentary onion bread for starters. I had the bone in ribeye ($68) and my husband had the pork chops. Both were tasty, but the ribeye cost rivals strip competitors who are offering a higher quality steak for comparable prices. I would rather go to delmonicos for the same price. The price on the pork chops was reasonable given the quality though. For sides (served in shareable portions a la carte) , we opted for the super healthy options of au gratin and mac & cheese. Both were good, but next time we'll get one and share it. 

Overall, the steakhouse is a decent option on Fremont street. But not the best one in town. I wouldn't avoid it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here either.  If I do go back I'll try something else easier on the wallet to see if it's worth it (the bone in ribeye was the most expensive cut of meat on the menu).",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,5,2,4,oZgk6GKOWOpmq5YIXMbc1w

Pros:  The New York Steak was outstanding.  Perfectly cooked and the insides cooked to the right temperature.  The salmon was good as well.  Had seasoned potato wedges, and they were a good accompaniment to the steak.  Creme Brulee and Chocolate Lava Cake were outstanding.  Extensive wine lists of moderate to expensive wines.  Also, the ambience was great.  The piano man playing in the background, the showgirls walking around on the floor talking to patrons, and the walls of photos of Oscar Goodman with politicos, celebrities, etc... were great.  

Cons:  Open since Dec 11. Still growing pains./  My wife ordered onions with her seafood, and it did not come with the meal.  The waiter had to be reminded and it finally arrived AFTER she had finished her meal.  It was taken away and an apology from the waiter.

So, if you like steak, this is the place.  Depending on he time of day, expect a long wait.  And do not be surprised if they get the meal wrong.  But, when that steak arrives, you should be very pleased.  For two people with a main course, 1 soup, two side dish accompaniments, two desserts, one soda and one cocktail, expect to drop $130 plus.

We went to this place after a Saturday show at the Smith Center. I ordered the Halibut dish, and my husband ordered the Ahi Tuna, along with 3 side dishes (Cream spinach, mashed potato and onion strings). Our friends ordered calamari for appetizer and prime rib and shrimp salad for main dishes. 10 minutes after our order, our waiter informed us there was no more Ahi tuna nor Halibut for the day. The only seafood they served was Tilapia, and per waiter it was supposedly sublime.

The Tilapia turned out to be super greasy and overcooked. And our friend's $61 prime rib was over cooked as well. All side dishes were tolerable, but definitely very greasy. We also had wine here which was not too memorable.

When our bill came out, we were surprised that they charged us each additional  $10 for ""Oscar's top"" which we did not order. Per waiter, it was the creamy sauce they placed on top of the Tilapia dish, which they did not tell us about in the first place. Since there was no Tilapia on the menu, the waiter went on to charge me $38 for my Tilapia dish, and charged my husband $41 for his. I have no idea why the pricing was different although we got identical dishes. Upon questioning, the waiter mumbled something, and since I don't like to argue in a high end restaurant we just paid and left.

I would not had given the restaurant 1 star had my husband not gotten so sick from the food the following day. My husband had nausea sensation for the following 24 hours, and some diarrhea. I also had mild nausea, but symptoms more mild. Overall, for a $80 per person meal, I can think of many other places to go to",a-jN0HYSCm8vYOPF5tgdDA,0,0,1,ydB_C7ByXvtd63OMNWwHJA

We arrived early so got to enjoy a drink at the bar first. Soo. After we were sat a beautiful round table right in the center of the restaurant. The view was gorgeous with an open roof and windows all around the site of downtown Fremont was a nice way to enjoy the evening. 

Crab cake and meatball appetizers were tasty and a generous portion enough to share amongst the 10 of us. Shrimp served with the shrimp cocktail are huge!
I had the sea bass and was shockingly surprised by the size of the fish. Definitely do recomend the seabass if you prefer seafood for dinner. Again, generous portion. Unfortunately the bone in filet was a disappointment, very dry and little flavor. Desserts were a nice way to end the evening. The cheesecake was soft and moist and the creme brulee was delicious. The tiramisu on the other hand was good but the presentation horrible. It looked like slop was just plopped down on the plate.

Pretty awesome jumbo lump Crab Cakes (two big ones for $17) - the waiter actually declared a 'money-back guarantee' if I didn't like them. I didn't have to take him up on it because they were as good as crab cakes get.

The environment is very vintage Vegas - as you'd imagine it to be, with a mid-century modernesque atrium where every seat has a commanding view of the Fremont Street Experience.

Every trip out of town and special events in town, I always love a good steak...I hoped for a 5 star time...but settled for 3. The ambiance in the bar area aims for an old school Vegas/ speakeasy vibe to it...and it hits the mark...I could picture this place as being back in the day...although the lights would be a bit bright for Mr Sinatra's taste I would guess :-)
I sat at the bar and interaction with the bartender was minimal...did his job,nothing bad or great to set him apart. I ordered the Steak Au Poivre...the ny strip was cooked to order...and quality wise...ok...average for the price. What did stand out was the Au Poivre sauce was almost more BBQ than peppery. Maybe the chef didn't stir it and the pepper settled to the bottom before he ladelled it...I don't know. It didn't ruin the meal, but it was not what it could have been. The Potato Croquettes, on the other hand, were perfectly done. I recommend that as your side for any meal in the place.
What finished off the experience for me was the floor manager. she came by and asked how the meal was. I commented on the positives and then told her about the Au Poivre sauce...to which her reply was ,""Oh, are you a food critic?"" Perhaps her aim was not to be condescending...I would hope that's the case...but my immeadiate thought was ""Isn't every customer of yours evaluating their meal?""...and as someone who has run front of the house in restaurants for 20 years...that was the wrong way to interact with a guest.
So...overall...an ok steak house...but I left with a bad taste in my mouth...whether it was the sauce or the manager, i'm not quite sure.",-tnodf38uCXjogMhZtcWxw,2,1,3,JCDDHJf_Xv0dbOwFG-Q0Cg

Food was unremarkable  as other reviews indicate. Not high end quality as prices would suggest. Bread and water delivered well AFTER appetizer was served. The ""prime"" rib was good, not great.

Portions were large. 
Our first two wine list choices were ""not available"", so made a third choice. To their credit, they offered our third choice at 2nd choice price (again, thank you Cody! But by this time he was obviously embarrassed and weary of apologizing. We felt badly for the guy).
Suggestion for Oscar: Hire a top notch manager,  pay attention to inventory control, train the wait staff on some basics customer service skills (they appear to want to do a good job, & buss staff working really hard, but chaos was the norm),  staff for a busy room, (which, despite your mediocre food and service offering, you still seem to enjoy), and buy better quality beef roasts.

Our reservations were at 7pm, and of course the 6 of us showed up at 8pm.  Jack, the manager was on location, and he and the host did the best they could to get us seated asap.  The place was bustling, and roughly 30mins later, we were seated by the window overlooking the Fremont experience.  In short, I'm glad I gambled on Jack instead of taking the easy way out with so many other choices in vegas.  I would and will dine at Oscar's again.  

The bread and butter came out quickly, and it was delicious.  It was like a onion loaf, perfectly crisp on the outside and moist and chewy in the center.  I do my best to avoid carbs at night, but there was no avoiding the 3-4 rounds for the table.  All of us were still raving about it the next morning.     

A buddy got the prime rib, and sampling it made us regret we ordered anything else.  I'm a big Lawry's fan, but it blew it out of the water.  My filet wasn't bad either, but it was like dating a victoria secret model from a pool of sports illustrated models.  Everyone enjoyed their entree.

Service was attentive and our server really hustled for us.  We were drinking and being rambunctious, and he managed us without a hitch.  We got water and drinks when we wanted them.

No dessert, as we needed to rush out of there for the club.

The 'Broads' is a novel idea, and under different circumstances, it might have added to the experience.  Good logistics and 'knowing your audience' because they didn't bug us at all.     

***pre-dining review***
Firstly, haven't dined, but have resv in a couple weeks, so will update my rating after actual experience.  My current rating was a judgement call purely based on my conversation with the manager on duty, Jack, about their Yelp reviews.

Friends and I are big Yelpers; we read the good, bad, and some inbetween.  We try to avoid anything 4 star below.  However, we also love trying new places, and moreover, i love dt vegas and having Oscar Goodman's name on the door gave it novel appeal.  Yes, he may personally overcook a steak like any other god fearing consigliere, but sure ""he can make an offer you can't refuse"" to pull in the right people.

Short of it is, I called because I wanted to get his take on the negative reviews and offer assurances that they got rid of the gremlins and have grown out of new restaurant pains.  Conversation could have gone two ways.  First, his reply would could have been defensive and dismissive considering Oscar Goodmans name recognition, and the fact he has a captive audience being the Plaza Hotel's fine steakhouse.  That response would have made me more leery, and we would have gone to an established 4 star.  It didn't.  Instead, Jack, the manager, took the true owner/operator approach, owned up to past mistakes, and was very earnst about the fact they defintely went through some new reataurant pains, but they've since righted the ship.  He didn't make any exuses, and offered his word and his handshake through the phone.  That gave me the confidence to keep my reservation, so I'm looking forward to the actual experience.

0.5 STAR for the View

I made a reservation for Friday night on the day of. We arrived at 9:10pm for our 9:15pm reservation. We were seated at 9:30pm.

The dining area is located in the dome directly above where the front valet entrance is for The Plaza. The dimly lit circular dining room provided a front row seat to the Freemont Street Experience. We were able to enjoy the festive light shows and people watch all throughout dinner.

There is definitely room for improvement when it comes to service. After our dinner, we were asked if we would like dessert. I said yes. Our waiter disappeared for 5 minutes only to return to tell us that he could not find a dessert menu. (The restaurant was not full. There were empty tables. So how is it that they ran out of or somehow he was not able to locate a dessert menu?) When it was time for our check, our waiter was nowhere to be found. The assistant waiter told us our waiter will be back in 3 minutes.

Onto the food:

Lobster Bisque($8): Mediocre. A bit on the salty side.
Fish of the Day ($32): It was the Bass and and it was bland. To be honest, I didn't even finish it. It tasted like something from a cheap buffet. Very disappointing.
Creme Brulee ($7-8): Mediocre. The caramelize finish was not really achieved. The actual creme part lacked vanilla. However I did enjoy the fresh fruit (strawberry, raspberry, etc.)

Now what about the ""broads?"" I mean, it is in the name of the restaurant and I too was curious about this. As soon as we were seated, it was quick to see who they were. They weren't skanky looking or anything. Just a pair of girls, looked like any other girls you would find walking around at a club wearing their little black dress. They sat down at a table with 3 guys and they had a couple rounds of drinks and then they got up and left. Didn't really have any effect on my dining experience. 

However, I would recommend dismissing the broads and using that capital to focus on the dishes, which is sadly in need of work. To be charging main courses from anywhere between $25 to $40+ a plate and having it taste like something from a dime a dozen buffet line is a real shame. 

Would I recommend this place? I think not. 

(The only reason why I ate here was because my dinner was comped. If I had to pay out of my own pocket, I think this review would've been a lot angrier. Haha)",qlaVQkSxKcqfHJhoZU3rKg,8,0,2,8Q2lvPbWwQpCKwM6wxT6eg

We were sat right by the window with a view of Freemont street.

We were started with their signature onion bread accompanied with soft butter. The bread is fresh, soft, and delicious.

I ordered the 8 oz filet and my husband ordered the 12 oz filet both cooked medium.  We also ordered the side of corn.

Both steaks were cooked perfectly. The steaks were well seasoned and a great amount for the price.

The corn was sweet and buttery and a nice compliment to the steak.

We also ordered 2 glasses of red wine. I had a pinot noir and my husband had a merlot. Both wines were good quality. The wine section by the glass is a little small.

And last but not least was our server Brad who is a true master at what he does. He gave the perfect amount of attention while we were eating and then chatted us up at the end of our meal, which we liked.

Back at my hotel I got a recommendation about two steak houses; one of which was Oscar's  Beef Booze and Broads at the Plaza Hotel and Casino opposite from my hotel on Freemont Street

Named after Oscar Goodman, the former mayor of Las Vegas and in the plaza above the Hash House, I headed up there for their Valentine's Day special, $50 prime rib steak, smashed potatoes and one of the best onion soups I have tasted in a while.

This time the food was portioned just right. I was able to finish everything and a dark coffee as well.

They have a sexy clientele of ladies, both customers and staff at the bar and although the broads (staff) were a little bit too old for my taste, the food was first class. Well worth a visit. Total cost of meal excluding drinks $50+gratuities and drinks extra. I paid $68 for everything. Not bad for a steak house. In NYC you would be hitting above $100 quite easily.",Lh7KVMJ8MMf6DK77eP-Q_g,1,0,4,Ogsa3m19yuQ5dzozrKV_JQ

The waiters seemed to have a little attitude. We waited 20 min before getting our drink order in and even then it was only cause we stopped the host to ask if we can order. We got asked about our meal when we were already done and had to ask twice for drink refills. He didn't seem friendly when we are a light hearted group.
The food was average. I got the tuna appetizer and it wasn't popping with flavor like ahi should be. The calamari the rest of the table got was like you can get anywhere, nothing special. For my main dish I got the crab stuffed shrimp, good not great. I like crab and shrimp so enjoyed but again the sauce and food wasn't popping with any flavor. The asparagus I could make at home. The sweet potato wedges were good but must have been a white sweet potato so not what I imagined and not sure I would have ordered. I don't tend to eat white potatoes. Lastly they brought cheesecake for the birthday, we aren't much into cheesecake but I'm told it was good. Now I love cobbler and have had some good ones based on my travels but their apple cobbler was bland to me. I don't know if it's the apples used or again the spices missing.

2716953,2015-01-31,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Oscar's is another example of ""you get what you pay for"".  My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at the Plaza, with Oscar's as our dinner plan.  The evening started in the bar with Martinis before dinner.  Rather than sitting at the bar itself, we chose two very comfortable padded leather chairs at a small table and settled in to enjoy the ambiance.  If these weren't the best dirty Gin Martinis we've had, they were too close to split hairs over.  Our waiter was very courteous, ensured we knew it was Happy Hour, and had several recommendations for us in the event wanted to try something other than the Martinis.  Not long after we sat down, one of Oscar's ""Broads"" introduced herself and made sure we knew to call on her if we needed anything.

We were told our table was ready slightly before our reservation time, and the hostess was quick to tell us we could finish enjoying our drinks at the bar or bring them to the table, which ever we preferred.  Our waiter was ready with the bill in case we wanted to move right away.  We paid and moved to our table.  We sat along the outer edge of the restaurant and had a wonderful view of the intersection of Main and Fremont Streets.  The restaurant is even with the second floor and sits in front of the Plaza Hotel and Casino.  Surrounded by glass with a raised center section, it looks like there isn't really a bad seat in the house.

We were happy to see that the man who was our waiter at the bar had moved into the restaurant and was now our waiter for dinner as well.  He was fantastic and represented the ""Old Vegas"" class and courtesy that is so much a part of our city's reputation.  He treated us like royalty and ensured we knew that we could order another round of Martinis (or other drinks) at Happy Hour prices.  (We did, of course.)

We ordered Shrimp Cocktail to start the meal and Filet Mignon (Oscar style) for dinner, with smashed potatoes and creamed spinach as sides.  Everything was prepared perfectly.  The portions weren't excessive, but there was enough food that we could have taken leftovers home.  Our waiter ensured our glasses were never empty, was never pushy, didn't rush us at all and even took time to talk with us after dinner.  As we ate we saw the Broad move casually through the restaurant several times, ensuring any and all questions were answered, and sitting with guests for conversation when asked.  When we were done with our meals, our waiter had our check ready.  It was a pleasure to tip generously for truly superior service.

We can't wait to head back to Oscar's.  There are many more things on the menu we'd like to try and we're excited to experience the equally amazing service again and again.  If you live in Vegas and haven't gone to Oscar's yet, find the time and go.  If you're visiting and want a special evening to enjoy some Old Vegas hospitality right where it all began down on the original Las Vegas Strip, be sure to save a night and go.

I had order the Sally's 14oz New York Strip, the Joey C's Filet Mignon, and a side order of the Alaskan King crab legs. The steaks were made to perfection (rare/medium-rare). 

When the crab legs came out, I was extremely disappointed to see the portion amount they had to offer for the price I was paying. I was not too happy. It was a measly two legs that were placed on the dish in front of me.

Another thing I really was not too fond of was the caramelized onions. I thought I was swallowing a spoonful of sugar with every bite I had of the onions. It was too sweet to the standardized caramelized onions that I am so used to.

2742780,2013-08-03,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"The good:
1. Amazing happy hour at the bar: 50% off the beer! Can't beat a $3 blue moon! Awesome price
2. The crab cakes were amazing. Huge chunks of crab meat in the perfect ratio of meat to filler. The outside was also perfectly crispy with the right amount of crunch
3. You MUST, and I repeat, you MUST order the Chocolate Mousse for dessert. It was best thing I ate all night. Layers of fluffy clouds of mousse and the bottom layer had a rich rum flavor? or was it espresso? I could not pin it down, but it kept drawing my spoon back for more and more bites until I was scraping the plate clean.
4. The onion dinner bread was different and delicious. The service we had was not that great and our dinner bread did not come to the table until after our appetizers were served and then cleared. But the bread was great- warm with cheese baked on top. I can always tell a good restaurant by their dinner bread and this was pretty good.

The Mediocre: 
Chopped salad: The salad already came with pepper on it and there was so much of it that it just overwhelmed my whole palate. The candied pecans seemed out of place. When I would actually bite into one, it just seemed strange and it did not go well with the rest of the flavor profile. The onion strings on top were stale. If they were crunchier, it would have been enough texture to replace the candied pecans. 

To pass:
1. Sally's New York Strip: sorry to say that you should pass on this steak even though this is a steak house. The steak was cooked perfectly- good grill marks and perfectly charred, but there was no flavor! It lacked seasoning and salt. Sorry to say that I wish I had steak sauce but I didn't want to be rude and ask for it. Also the meat was a little tough. Was not tender like I would expect from a higher end steakhouse. 
2. The cheesecake- not good. Too dense. You're better off going to the cheesecake factory if you're craving cheesecake.",-267Yx8RmdP6io2-qI4UcQ,1,0,4,cOV1iHQWd9UP6Cl4Id_7-Q

I was served two totally different colored and tasting apple martinis, one the waiter brought, and the other my husband ordered. The bread basket came cold and without butter. The soup was luke warm, and even thought we ordered our steaks medium well, they were so red, they could have moved off our plates!

2807784,2017-09-29,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Another really fine steak house in downtown Las Vegas.  Downtown has been working overtime to shed its image as the place where busloads of white haired old ladies go to play penny slots, and high on the list of improvements are some really first rate restaurants that rival anything on the Strip.  Oscar's, at the Plaza, is one such.

The room itself is stunning, with its floor to ceiling glass dome and its views of Fremont Street.  We arrived on the early side, hoping to get a window table fronting Fremont, and we did.  We didn't even have to ask.  The hostess was very nice, and took us right to the best table in the room.  Our waiter, Scott, took our drink orders promptly.  I tend to pay attention to the bread basket in restaurants, because I think it shows attention to detail (or lack thereof).  The bread at Oscar's was a fabulous fresh-baked loaf of onion bread.  We raved about it, and on our way out Scott brought us two loaves of complimentary bread to take home with us.

Scott was very attentive throughout the meal, and was both helpful with the menu and personable in chatting about things like the history of the room - it seems it used to be the site of the Plaza's rooftop pool.  

The menu has quite a few twists, which are going to leave you either adoring the food, or thinking that it isn't quite right.  For example, my wife and I both started with the onion soup, which was made with veal stock - my wife loved it, while I thought it was a little salty (veal stock will do that).  Next, I had the crab cakes which were quite large and served with two very good sauces, but which were a little short on lump crab meat.  My wife had the wedge salad, which Scott had chopped at her request, and enjoyed it.  It was a bit heavy on the blue cheese, which made it strongly flavored.  My entree was the bone-in rib eye, which was a fine steak - flavorful and properly cooked, but a little heavy on the fat and gristle in the cap.  It was not the best steak I have had, but it was pretty good.  My wife had the crab stuffed jumbo shrimp, which she thought were excellent.  Both of us had plenty of food left to take home for dinner tomorrow night.

Prices - my steak was on the high side of what similar restaurants charge, but much of the menu was a pretty good deal.  In our case, the good deal aspect was given a boost by a TravelZoo voucher, which allowed us to get out the door for under $200, tax, tip, drinks and wine included.  To top it off, complimentary valet parking at the Plaza was (unexpectedly) a breeze.  We were very satisfied, and we will be back.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,5,L4KUNtQG4HmZ-FIXiXWt-w

First, you know it's going to be a bad night when you start off with attitude from the hostesses. Ya can't have this table but you can wait for that table, even through your whole meal the table you could have sat in was never used.... Not good.

Second, while not your fault it really sucks that the view has been blocked, bummer. it would also help if the hotel would clean the nasty dirty dome glass once in a while.
 
So now let's talk about the meal, if my drink had alcohol in it you could have fooled me. Chopped salad was good so that started to give me hope. Then came my steak not so good. Dry, chewy, my friends came out raw. Wife had the stuffed shrimp and liked it... 

So when the waiter who was pretty talkative goes on about how he likes this place much better than say Flemings,  I'll go to Flemings in a heart beat over this place.

Big salads with decent flavor and at a good price. For the main dish my wife had the chicken and I had the Big Chris Steak. The chicken was good and my wife seemed to enjoy. The steak was not good. The New York had a gamey taste and smell with a texture and taste of venison. We told our waiter and he reported back to the manager. The manager argued that it was the wet aging process and that there was nothing wrong with the steak. Not asking for any compensation he did take the steak off the bill. After this encounter we were presented with the bill, no ask of coffee or desert. When I asked about why this was overlooked the waiter indicated that we told the manager we were done.

Observation: They are getting going but it seems that this place lacks experience. The ""broads"" gimmick does not seem to work and just seems to annoy the customers.

The steak was outstanding! Very juicy and tasty! A great portion size that was satisfying and filling. The sides were a-ok, if not spectacular.

I'm growing to love this place...the food, the atmosphere (sans the showgirl) and the service both at the bar and the wait staff.  This establishment will easily earn a fifth star when I have a chance to explore the menu a couple more times.

This last visit I had the wood plank salmon and corn brulee.  Fantastic on both accounts!  The salmon was delicious, fresh and piping hot.  The corn brulee was made with very sweet crisp corn kernels...not sure how, I figured it would be mushy but not even close; my new favorite side dish!

Highly recommended...great happy hour too!",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,5,2,4,8QGjTPVwvkDJgkgiIzq8UQ

Service was super friendly but slow-going from the start, they should've been prepared and had more servers in the lounge. 
They were offering a three course menu for v-day $60 or $85 with wine pairings. Four of us got that - two with Scallops and one with filet. Two others got NY strip, one got the pork chop and one the flank steak. We all shared bites - because we are family! And all of the food was amazing!! I'd say the NY strip was best, even though it wasn't my selection. 
This review might of gotten five stars, but the fact that my grandma's dessert - included in the three course meal took 20 minutes longer than ours - and we noticed later they charged extra for it combined with the 45 minute wait for our check put a damper on the experience.

Starting with that bit of info because their website says ladies get half off drinks on Thursdays... we were informed they are no longer doing that (they should probably take that blurb off their menu). Happy hour (goes until 7pm) includes white and red house wine, well drinks, several beers and select appetizers.

Service was a bit underwhelming. The waitress was almost throwing herself at the table of men next to us and barely paying attention to us.

That being said, the food at this place made up for it. The crab cake app had so much crab meat in it I'd happily pay regular price for them!

This was my second visit to Oscar's and in both cases the service was extremely slow - the servers are nice, but I think they need more than (2) in the bar area on a busy night and more than one on a slow night.

The charcuterie plate was great and when ordered for (2) was ample for (4) people.  From there it went down hill.  The three meatball appetizer came out cold in the middle and the Ahi Tuna appetizer came with the wasabi and ginger, but absolutely no soy or ponzu sauce for dipping.  So I ask you, why put wasabi paste on my plate, if you're not going to give me either sauces for dipping?  The server got the drink orders wrong and thought it was odd that we would want bread to actually come with a charcuterie plate...

My martini glass had leftover soap residue, which tainted the a very simple Kettle One, straight up with a twist :-(

I must say, I was happy we went here.  The ambience was nice. Upscale old school feel to the place. Not modern. Being in downtown vegas the clientele seemed more of the older midwest, southern crowd.  

Was it the best steak i've had? No. 
Was it good because I had really low expectations? Probably
Was it enhanced by the fact that we'd been drinking for a couple hours prior? Likely

The bread is awesome! I can't tell you how much of that stuff i ate. The menu was a bit limited. We got the crabcakes which were excellent (not alot of breading).  Also tried the lobster bisque which was pretty good (alot of places make it too salty but this was just right)

The service was good, however; the staff is not refined for the prices that they charge. I did not expect a lot since this is downtown and the clientele show up wearing t-shirts and shorts.

Im a 2nd generation Las Vegan and this has always been on my bucket list to try. A good friend of mine/customer got a promotion at his company so it was definitely a much needed celebration dinner. I made my reservations on OpenTable, and oscars called me a couple hours before to confirm that we're still on for my party of 10. When I showed up To valet my car they somehow knew my name and asked if I was here for the party and then they parked my car in the front of the casino (that was really cool). 
We then went upstairs and was greeted respectfully and sat at our table that was amazing, then of course I ordered the famous Oscar Martini it was made perfect in did not disappoint. I glanced over the menu, I already knew what I wanted, I wanted to eat like Oscar Goodman the man that I've looked up to for a long time.  My parents and grandparents would always tell me stories about how Las Vegas used to be when they were growing up, they would explain that they would get dressed up with their friends and significant other and go out to enjoy the casinos. I believe a lot of that is been forgotten over the years that I've seen growing up. But I'm so glad Oscar kept his place the way he did. It was classy and a little gangster, I felt like I was Oscar Goodman for the night LOL. This is a must try place if you're from out of town or especially if your local.

The bone in rib steak was superb; sides were pretty solid, and dessert was also excellent, though ridiculously oversized in some cases (looks like they got the portions from Heart Attack Grill down the street). The variety is not as strong as Joe Vicari Andiamo at the D, but the quality was excellent. Service was also superb and the order was done just right - I decided against booking on a weekend, as most of the reviews that showed problems with the order were on these times.

But this restaurant was a total and complete miss for us.

Bread: with onions? Onions?? Awful.
Chopped salad: very nice flavors, embarrassingly small portion.
Onion soup: nicely presented, but weird taste.
Filet mignon: ordered medium, got well, very dry inside. Not offered or served with any sauces at all, like peppercorn as an example.
New York: portion was very generous, also overcooked, taste was very boring. No marinade, no flavor, and again, no sauce.
Sides: does every side have to have bread crumbs? Couldn't taste the difference between macaroni and cheese and corn, because both are drowning in bread crumbs. Baked potato was very dry, seemed like sitting a very long time.
Tiramisu: not bad, not great.
Service: waited a long time to be greeted even though when we arrived, only 3-4 tables. Busser was excellent, seemed like he cared much more than server. But all small details missing: drinks not filled very quickly; no one decrumbed table until time for dessert even though we needed it; not much care to arrange silverware between courses, etc. 
ALSO: when I made the reservation, I stated that it was our anniversary. But it was never even mentioned or acknowledged by the server, the maitre d', the manager, no one. Not a single sound about it.

We eat out every single night, and really hoped for a great experience. We really know the restaurant scene in Las Vegas, and know what to expect at different price points. But unfortunately, this restaurant falls FAR short, even had it been at a lesser price point.

Honestly, we were very disappointed, especially as this was a special occasion for us.",Ys-EcbaWcpnpvhV_rbv02g,1,0,2,OJwOvDZGEuv6hIoah8J5hw

The prices are normal for Vegas so if you are looking for a $15 filet mignon, go visit Kansas, but you're not going to find a decent one in Vegas for less than $35-$40, and most places on the Strip start them out at $45-$50 so Oscar's is not out of line.  Would like to see better wines by the glass, but that was the only thing I would change...and the wines they did have by the glass were NOT overpriced as others have said, again, if you want a $5 glass of wine, stick to the poker bars, not a high-end steakhouse.

We went on a Thursday night and it was only moderately busy with patrons. We waited about 10 minutes to be greeted by our server, he apologized and said that another server would be assisting him. The other server promptly showed up and took our drink order. We then ordered a Blue cheese salad wedge and French onion soup. My husband ordered the special steak of the night- a huge bone in ribeye for $65, I ordered a small cut prime rib and side of mashed potatoes.  His salad wedge arrived but my onion soup did not. After about 10 minutes I got the attention of our server and asked where my soup was. He apparently didn't hear me or remember that I ordered it. It arrived and was your typical onion soup, nothing special. Our steaks arrived and looked beautiful. My husbands ribeye was to die for! He said it was one of the best he's ever had! It was hot, seasoned well and cooked to perfection!  My prime rib was another story; it was luke warm, had little to no taste but it was super tender and not full of fat which I love. Our $9.00 mashed potatoes were not hot enough to melt the butter I added. The thing I hated about this restaurant was the blaring pop music! I love the old school Vegas vibe here but the pop music ruined it for me. It was music you would hear in a dance club. I couldn't wait to leave. I would recommend spending your time and money just down the street at Hugo's Cellar in the basement of the Four Queens. We ate there the night before and have eaten there for over 16 years.

3732882,2012-10-22,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"This was our 2nd time at Oscars.  Our first experience was an ""Oh Wow!"".  Our 2nd time there was a bit of a disappointment.

To start things off, the cocktail waitress inside the bar had no clue about the custom drinks on the menu.  She wasn't even familiar with the names of the drinks!  After ordering our cocktails, our table became available.  The hostess said that she would have the cocktail waitress bring our drinks to the table.  It took 15 minutes to finally get our drinks.  My martini was supposed to have bleu cheese olives; and it had regular olives instead.  I did finally get them; but it took the cocktail waitress a couple more requests and another 15 minutes.  I was also surprised that they couldn't transfer my bar tab to the dinner check.

Moving on to dinner, the seafood that my wife and mother ordered was very good.  My prime rib, the Oscar bone-in cut, was at least 50% fat!  This cut of meat should have never left the kitchen.  The real kicker is that it was cold.  Not just lukewarm or cool....but COLD.  I sent it back where I think they just poured hot au-jus on it because it still wasn't very warm.

As for the service, I was disappointed in our waiter.  He never even acknowledged my mother's birthday, even though I informed the hostess upon checking in (and tipped her $20!).  When the waiter brought my prime rib after I sent it back, he did not wait while I tested, nor did he ever check back to see if I was satisfied with my entree.  At the end of the meal, he commented as to how much of the prime rib was still left on the plate.  I replied that it was all fat that was left...and he simply laughed!

I expect excellent food and excellent service when enjoying a fine restaurant, especially when the average bill at Oscar's is around $100 per person.  I am sorry to say that I will not recommend this restaurant to others, nor will I go back.  One or two small mistakes, I can understand; but a series of them throughout the night is unacceptable!  The service and overall experience at Oscar's was just plain sloppy.  There are too many other amazing restaurants in Las Vegas that get it right every time.",nXbK69DWDOYataimFGUw9w,8,0,2,ydYDG-jxOIkk-wvRzCl0yg
3748758,2014-08-04,3,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Let me preface this review by saying that I did not have a steak. But, I have gone to culinary school and the food I did have was quite disappointing, so I was really glad I didn't order a steak. I hate having to send food back when I'm dining with a group (which I was) and my prediction is that the steak would've needed to be sent back.

Oscars bills itself as a first class steakhouse.  I'd expect it to have a chef on premises tasting the food and making sure that everything is excellent.  I strongly suspect that isn't the case.  When I'm looking at $100 per person without drinks, I expect a super meal, not something phoned in.

I ordered the beef and barley soup, which was described as being made with home made stock and fresh vegetables along with prime rib. The stock was (I strongly suspect) not house-made--it was bland and greasy and nothing like the stock I make at my house.  The prime rib was chewy. The barley was under-cooked.  My husband had the French onion soup and had the same review--it was just awful.

I ordered a $15 side of lobster mac & cheese......the lobster was flabby and not sweet.....I suspect it was frozen and then thawed, and maybe they didn't even squeeze the water out.   For $15, I honestly expected very few pieces of lobster but I did expect them to be firm and succulent....which is why people order lobster (or lobster-anything).   

My husband ordered what he thought was an entree sized chopped salad and it came doused in so much dressing that it never lost its shape after being squished into a ring form (like restaurants do for things like a stacked tuna tartare).  He said it was mediocre at best.

I tasted my friends' orders of au gratin potatoes (okay) and truffled mashed potatoes (very good, but $15?).

Honestly, if Oscar's wants to be considered to a first class steakhouse they're going to need to up their game with these side dishes, salads and soups. Who wants a dinner brought down by the fact that the sides and salads/appetizers are terrible?   If you can't make those things well, then take them off the menu.",NwFkXVuLdtkWF1cmGbvScw,4,0,1,0nyAX-ArK6bwL-NLjrNomA

The view did not disappoint. It overlooked the west end of Fremont Street and the ambiance of the restaurant was great.

The service and the food, however, left us feeling sour.  The waitstaff, excluding one bus person, were rude. For whatever reason our waiter seemed to be picking on my girlfriend, seemingly annoyed that she was sitting there.  We watched as he was so hospitable to a couple sitting next to us, and wondered what we had done wrong to make him treat us so differently, and to be frank, badly.  He never came back and checked up on us for both the appetizer and entree courses and only saw him when he asked if we were interested in dessert. If he had checked up on us at all, he would have known that we were not satisfied with the food.

I do have to say, not all the food was bad.  We ordered the calamari and crab cakes for appetizer, which my girlfriend got picked on when ordering it by the waiter.  The apps were tasty.  The calamari, which lacked a bit of seasoning, were crispy and went well with the marinara sauce.  The crab cakes were not dry and flavored well with huge chunks of crabs.  The entree, however was not great.  We ordered the New York strip and it came, borderline burnt.  The burnt-ness came through on every bite and masked all of the natural meat flavors, ruining the steak.  We would have complained except the waiter was no where to be found.  But I guess it was my fault for not waving him down.

For the price I would patronize other steakhouses on the strip, or even chains like Morton's or Fleming's. I did not enjoy my experience here. I would only recommend the place for its views and maybe their appetizers. We didn't try anything else on the menu so I can't say much on that.",ulKQAWrDGBBrciZDPvLJHQ,6,0,1,BfNtWKp_2jlfK9xr1w_-bg

Bobby was very old school and everything you'd want in a waiter, attentive, able to make suggestions, point us in the right direction of ordering pretty and pretty much a class act. We started with the onion strings, which were pretty damn good. Then we ordered the filet which was seasoned and cooked perfectly and enough for two. We had three sides, the creamed spinach which was just okay, the au gratin potatoes and possibly the best corn I have ever had - the roasted corn brûlée. Seriously get the corn, don't share it, actually order two. If you aren't a local, share because the the portions are generous and you can't really take leftovers in Vegas. But people please remember, this is a nice steak house so class it up - don't wear your booty shorts or your best looking bro shirt.

3960773,2015-05-21,3,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"My visit to Oscar's was my first time in the old town Las Vegas.  The restaurant seated us at one of the window seats in their ovular shaped dining room.  We were able to gaze out the window at how different everything looked compared to the main Las Vegas Strip.  The decor was definitely old school-- it felt like I went back into time to the 80's. 

We came here for Prime Rib.  We all went with the Bone-in PRIME RIB Special, and we were not disappointed.  The prime rib is HUGE!  I shared this with one of my girl friends and we couldn't even finish.  The meat was super tender, juicy, and the crust was nicely seasoned (I love this part of the meat!).  There was just the right amount of au jus on the prime rib, and was served with a creamy horseradish sauce.  For the size and quality, I'd say this is a great deal!

We shared a few sides as well: Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Creamed Spinach, and Sweet Potato with a Jalapeno Butter sauce.  My favorite side was the lobster mashed potatoes, but I wish there were bigger chunks of lobster in it in stead of shredded pieces.  The creamed spinach was good, but there was nothing special about it.  The sweet potatoes weren't very tasty.. it's pretty much 3 gigantic sweet potato fries, served with some sweet/watery sauce.  It did not taste like buttery nor jalapeno-- I wouldn't recommend this side.

4026832,2016-05-17,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Me and my boyfriend Roland ate here last night for our anniversary, 5-16-16, because we met here. When we met, it was during his company's Christmas party which had an open bar so I don't remember what the food was like but I do remember they make delicious martinis! Honestly, there are so many other places I would have rather gone to for this price point, but I'm so glad we came here. The food was really, really good.

Roland ordered Carolyn's Cut Prime Rib ($34) and I had Joey C's Filet Mignon (12 oz - $46) with a side of Bearnaise sauce. We ordered 2 sides - Brussels Sprouts with Caramelized Onion and Bacon ($8) and Ralph's Smashed Potatoes ($7). You can order three sides for $20 but we couldn't decide on a third. Our server, Lenore, was kind and knowledgeable about the menu. She even double checked ingredients with the chef for me since I'm gluten intolerant-- and lucky for me, they have many choices for people with allergies.

As for the food, it was SO GOOD! I couldn't get over my Filet. I ordered it medium-well and it was cooked perfectly, which almost never happens. I always order a side of Bearnaise sauce with my steak and they make it pretty well, although I like it just a bit tangier. And the Smashed Potatoes - OMG. Order these for sure! They will clog your arteries but they are the most deliciously decadent potatoes ever. Roland's prime rib was about a pound in weight and also very yummy. We are big fans of Lawry's Prime Rib and he thinks Oscar's does a pretty good job. I tried a bite - so delicious! He also used the complimentary bread (he said was amazing) to soak up the juices. The downfall is that we were both disappointed with the Brussels Sprouts. They weren't very memorable at all and lacked flavor even though they were cooked with onion and bacon. It was nice to add a little freshness to the heavy meal, but I wouldn't order these again. After our entrees, Lenore was so sweet and brought us cheesecake for our anniversary. Though I couldn't eat it, Roland enjoyed it. Thank you Lenore!

Additionally, I love the restaurant space. It's totally old school and charming. The dining room is circular with windows for walls. It looks straight down Fremont street, or at least it did before the scaffolding for the zip line was built. This definitely takes away a lot but the room itself is still beautiful. We came on a Monday night and there were just a few other tables with diners. It was quiet and the lighting was romantic.

With two entrees, two sides, and a glass each of house Merlot and house Pinot Noir, our bill came to $130. It's pricey but it was worth it for the special occasion. We will probably revisit every year but I don't know if I can wait that long to have the Filet Mignon and Smashed Potatoes again! Honestly, I'm daydreaming about it right now. Thank you Oscar's for a beautiful dinner!",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,6,0,4,UTz91fNkIX6Ja3o9Zobeeg

It was delicious.   We ordered the chicken entree, steak & lobster, prime rib, & bone in rib eye.   My wife & I split the ribeye, as it was 12oz cut.  The food was great.  I had a chicken soup which was amzing.   We all had mashed potatoes/baked potatoes/steak fries.  The asparagus was tasty too.   Service was top notch too.  

Very friendly waiter too as he shared a few stories with us.   Will recommend to all my family & friends.   We had originally booked another steakhouse for Christmas day, but the prices was pretty steep for the Xmas day menu.   Thus I saved a ton of money.

As a tourist, you wouldn't really know how to find this place. It is situated in a small local casino, The Plaza. I assume it's populated mainly with locals.  I dined here upon my cousin's recommendation, who's a Vegas local, and a true foodie. 

Food: incredible! You must try the rib eye! It was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The portion size is HUGE! I've never had such a large sized rib eye for that price. My cousin and I shared the plate and it was more than enough for the two of us. We also ordered the fried calamari, shrimp cocktail, and the chopped salad. The shrimp cocktail was probably my favorite. It's 4 pieces of jumbo sized shrimp that is super fresh! The chocolate cake was damn delicious and again, they don't skimp on the portion. It's a large slice with a chocolate/ cream sauce on the side with two scoops  vanilla ice cream 

Ambiance: Gorgeous! The center glass chandelier really sets a romantic and modern vibe. The first thing you notice as you walk into the restaurant is the dome shaped glass window. It's jaw dropping! The wide side glass windows really opens up the space and gives the entire place a truly unique dining experience. Be sure to request a window seat- this way you have a spectacular view of flashy downtown Las Vegas! 

Service: You really can't ask for better service there. We had the manager Cody come check on us a few times. He was such a sweetheart! Our server, Scott, was so nice and funny. He came and checked on us regularly and made sure we were satisfied with service. Oh! And they validate your parking. I didn't know that! Nice little perk! 

Price: Very reasonable considering the atmosphere and food quality. 


I would definitely come back here. I recommend this to all my buddies. The prices may be a bit steep but essentially, you're paying for a unique dining experience.

I had the Caesar salad which was nothing fancy, but just right. The bisque was flawless, just flavorful spoonful after flavorful spoonful.

The highlight is clearly the steak. To put it lightly: I've eaten a lot of steaks in my day. This was the best. 

I was there over a month ago and had the filet. and I'm not exaggerating when I say my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Just an incredibly tender piece of beef that could literally be cut with a fork. And it was prepared exactly how it should be: a nice charred crust, a little salt, and a little pepper. Nothing else. No crazy nonsense. No BS sauce. Just delicious meat. 

I don't know when the next time I'll get to Vegas is. But if the Gods are good, they will make sure Oscar's is still around. I have recommended it to all my friends, and will undoubtedly visit multiple times during my next trip.

The atmosphere is great. When we walked in their was a guy on the piano and a lady singing some old time 40s style music.  I was immediately excited that we found the right place.   We were seated up in the overlook area where the views of the old Las Vegas strip and Fremont street were awesome.  The place was at most half full when we arrived so not to busy.  THEN we waited and waited and waited for some one just to say hi and maybe pour us some water.  I watched our waiter walk by multiple times before I had to loudly call to him to get his attention as he passed again to get him to acknowledge we even existed.   I expected him to come right to us but he said he would be right there and we waited more.   This ruined the start.   FINALLY when we got some attention and he was a nice enough guy.  Kind of rough which maybe maybe didn't make sense to the atmosphere it was a little confusing.   Ultimately once we got service it was quick.  Drinks stayed full and the food was delivered quickly.  I'm from Texas so I have had great steaks.  I had the 46$ 12oz filet mignon.  It was cooked perfectly and was a good tasting piece of meat.  They could have seasoned it a little better but all in all it was a good tasting piece of meat.   The 46$ steak comes with nothing, no sides at all.  All of those are extra!  What!!  At 9$ average each you can get some not so good sides.  We tried the steamed asparagus ( no taste ), the potato wedges which I found odd tasting ang aw grotten potatoes which again were just ""ok"" at best.  Strangely you can get a Sam Adams beer for 5$.  Lol.  So everything is overpriced except the beer.  

All in all I'm glad we went but it's because of the atmosphere of the area.  I'd maybe do it again.  I definitely visit Fremont street again.  That place is great!

I finally had the chance to visit Oscar's on my last trip home.  It was a great experience and I loved everything about this place.  Here are the highlights:

1. The menu! The menu is full of classic steakhouse fares.  They have your fancy steaks, seafood, and lots of tasty sides.  What kicks this menu up a notch is that many of the items are named after Vegas big wigs and many known Mafia figures.  Gotta love Oscar and his style!

2. Great location! This resturant is located in the Plaza at the head of Fremont street.  The resturant is in a big glass dome, so you get some great views of Fremont Street, even if the new zip line blocks some of it these days. 

3. Fantastic service! The service here is top notch. From start to finish, we had a great time!

4. Tasty food! On this visit, we had a filet with Oscar topping, the Spilatro steak (named after Tony Spilatro or the guy played by Joe Pesci in the movie Casino), Mac n' cheese, cream corn brûlée, and the sweet potato fries. The filet Oscar was fabulous! The Spilatro steak, which is a flank steak stuffed with garlic and marinated in garlic and red pepper flakes, was ok.  The taste was good, but it was a bit tough, which is normal with flank steak.  I don't think I would order it again, but it was a fun steak to try.  The sides were all unbelievably fantastical in taste. Very top notch, in my book. 

5. Oscar's is on OpenTable, so you can make your own reservations and get points for it too!

I would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for tasty food, great service, and who loves Fremont Street.  I also would recommend this place because you have a chance of an Oscar siting, which would be awesome to anyone who knows Vegas Mafia history or have watched Casino.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,13,12,5,x_RkYgyLhQiXUwSAM2ef0A

Sides:  mac n cheese, asparagus and potatoes au gratin.  Smaller portions than other high end steakhouses.  Mac n cheese was very good, asparagus needed butter and seasoning, potatoes did not come in an Au Gratin dish and were bland.

Dessert:  cheesecake and berries.  Very creamy and the best slice of cheese cake I've had in Vegas.

Oscar's is perfect for that. 

Full Disclosure:  We spent 4 nights in the bar from open to close and on our last night we had dinner.  

Lounge:  I'm a Plopper.  I like to sit and watch the world go by.  Depending on your location, Oscars is perfect for this.  There are 3 types of seating.  Standard bar top, high top tables & comfortable chairs and couches.  Unlike many of the lounges/bars on Fremont, Oscar's doesn't cram you elbow to elbow with some stranger danger. 

We discovered on our first night there, we could happily nosh off their menu. They have an extensive cocktail list as well and full bar.  Sunday night we were the only ones in the bar/lounge portion, but the restaurant itself was quite busy. Our waiter was actually the bartender so our drinks were perfection.  

I am a die hard bloody Mary girl from way back but I've discovered the Carolyn - named after Her Honor, Ms. Mayor.  The menu said made with gin, but I can assure you it works well with vodka. We alternated between the Carolyn and a Patron margarita.  

At the suggestion of the staff, who all came over at one point or anther to welcome us to the Plaza & Oscars, we had the caprese salad called Jasper & Hunchy's Tomato Salad, the crab cakes & shrimp cocktail.  Excellent and light choices.  Oscar's #1 Broad, who is actually 2 different woman, made it a point to hang out with us several times a night.  Yes we are just THAT interesting. LOL. 

As our succession of nights progressed we also tried the Jose Leonardo's Roasted Corn Brulee,  Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese & Hymie's Latkes. all side dishes from the main menu and all done extremely well.  

Our last night, we hosted a dinner for 6 in the restaurant.  They seated us in the prime location, front and center of the window that looked straight down Fremont, as it was bathed in the golden light of Vegas.   I started with the onion soup, continued with Nicky's chicken and finished with a shared creme brulee. Our dinner guest each had the Carolyn cut of the prime rib with various toppings and sides. NOTE: the sides are very plentiful and can certainly be shared family style as are the appetizers. Since these are locals, they are used to the 9.99 prime rip. The Carolyn is NOT one of those, cut and cooked to perfection. Our total bill for 6, including several rounds of cocktails was under $300.00 with a 20% tip.  

Since it was still early, we retired back to our spot in the lounge.  Imagine our surprise and delight that the MAN himself came over and sat with us.  

Going to Oscar's you won't find yard long drinks or fishbowls full of cheap liquor but what you will find is a throwback to when people dressed to go to dinner, had cocktails at 6pm and considered it an experience instead of just getting as drunk as possible.  Ok we did some of that too.  

2nd Full disclosure:  our nightly bar bill for anywhere from 2-6 people ran about $150.00 per night.  Well worth finding this little gem of heaven to watch the world go by.",Y9kqjPcj-QCsH48PWATQ3g,5,3,4,gFyV-2sx51XQwYdUHoE0MA

The cocktail sauce was nice and spicy- you can tell they made it rather than it coming from a jar. The shrimp were very large, more like prawns! They were slightly waterlogged, but still good. The next was a Cesar salad. Now, I love traditional Cesar salads with the anchovies and raw egg- I think it was delicious. My husband on the other hand has never had a real/traditional Cesar salad and said he prefers the Kraft Cesar dressing to the one Oscars served. So to each their own with that. This is when the dinner took a turn for the worst. We ordered the halibut with cauliflower purée and sautéed spinach. The spinach was good- great seasoning. The fish was hard, not the least bit flaky and at one point I needed my knife to cut off a bite size piece. There was no seasoning at all. Also there was virtually no purée, and what little was there was tasteless. Seriously- the fish was horrible, red lobster is ten times better! We were also disappointed in the ""caramelized roasted"" Brussels sprouts. There was zero caramelization, the sprouts were underdone, woody and steamed, totally changing the flavor- also there was pretty much no seasoning. Lastly we got the creme brûlée for dessert. The sugar crust was done correctly but that was it. The custard was clotted and had the consistency of ricotta cheese- super unappetizing.

I visited Oscar's on a Saturday night as part of a group of 10 there to celebrate my grandmother's 70th bday. We all had flown in from Cali and looked forward to eating at Oscar's. Brad was a funny host but that did nothing to save the evening from plate after plate after plate of ice cold food. Yes, our $40, $65 and $90 steaks came to our table COLD. Imagine cold meat accompanied by lukewarm mashed potatoes, room temp creamed spinach. Even when the plates returned, the food was still cool, never hot.

While Brad tried to compensate, he ended up frustrated and short-tempered after literally EVERY meal (steak + sides) was sent back except one. Eventually the manager came over and while they took off half of our items, they never apologized or explained WHY the cooks couldn't get it right.

I only heard one good review, and it was from this guy named David Sadjak, who lives by the motto; ""A free meal always tastes better"".

He loves Bucca Di Pepo, and every second rate buffet in town, that gives him free or half priced food, and in his case, someone else was buying.

I had to see for myself. I can only sum it up one way;

On Anthony Bourdain's programs, he always tastes the food and then raves how good it is. If he has nothing good to say, he just doesn't say it. He talked with Mayor Goodman about the ""old days"" of Las Vegas, and did not say one thing about the food.

Since I can't say anything nice, out of respect to Mayor Goodman, and his service to the City, I will simply not say anything.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,3,1,2,jt5lxmd4BzMGfLeYNbR7QA
4241236,2012-03-11,9,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Steak & shtick -- of COURSE I had to check this place out!!!

I was a HUGE fan of the old steakhouse that used to be in that location; it was unpretentious and very reasonably priced steakhouse fare. Then they replaced it with that poseur-ass tapas joint, which thankfully didn't last...and now it's back to being a steakhouse, although a bit more expensive than the old steakhouse.

I'm guessing the new higher prices are to subsidize the cost of having Broads on the payroll -- sexy women in fake Marilyn Monroe costumes who sashay around the room from table to table, telling you all about Vegas. This was the main reason I went -- I wanted to see what these Broads were all about, in case I ever need a new job!

I pretty much expected it to be like at a strip club, with aggressive Broads forcing themselves on you, trying to make you buy them a drink or buy them dinner or pay their ""law school tuition"" (stripper-speak for coke and pills). But it wasn't that way at all! 

The night I went (Friday) there was only one solitary Broad working the room...and she was very easygoing. She stopped by the table a few times to chat, and sat down once...but even when my friend offered to buy her dinner, she said she was too busy working the room! Her loss -- my friend is one of those guys who gives $100 bills to any bimbo who comes down the pike; she could have made some cash off him, easy! To her credit, though, she didn't pander. Nice! 

Foodwise, it was average steakhouse fare -- no better, no worse than any other steakhouse. I had a caprese salad (very good), a petit filet ($32 and good) and a loaded baked potato. Bottle of wine, cocktails and sheesecake for dessert. The only real bummer was that the bar did not stock B&B, which we ordered as after-dinner drinks. Our waiter said they had Benedictine, which they could just mix with brandy to make B&B...but man, it tasted like ass! I think it was Benedictine & BENADRYL or something! Bleccchhh!

The service was ok -- we never did get a bread basket, and the table was never crumbed or anything. But this is NOT a hoity toity restaurant -- it's shtick! From the Oscar Goodman memorabilia all over the walls, to the Broads in their cheeseball gowns & feather boas, to the poor waiters in their cheap-looking pinstriped ""Mobster"" shirts and ties....it's more Disneyland than fine dining.

Which is fine by me! My friend and I made a day of it -- first we hit up the Mob museum, then took a leisurely stroll down Fremont St, and had dinner here. A very shticky day!

My one complaint is that the decor and ambiance is weirdly lacking. They went through all this trouble to hire Broads and get a live piano player in the lounge and basically re-create an old-time swanky Vegas steakhouse...and then they furnished it with what looks like leftovers from a 1998 cruise ship! Boring, uninspired and drab -- boo!! How about some really cool, retro, vintage swank? Right now, the lounge area isn't even cool enough to bother stopping in for a drink :-( You'd get more atmosphere in a Holiday Inn!

The food was OK, and maybe in another city this would be the best resturuant in town....but Vegas has so many outstanding steakhouses, that Oscar's seems to be mediocre in comparison. My dinning companion and I both ordered the same thing, crab cake appetizer, and NY strip steak with a lobster tail. The crab cakes were good, and so was the steak. But at most high end steakhouses in Vegas, the steaks come out perfectly seasoned, where you don't need to put anything on it at all....that was not the case with Oscars (you will definitely need the salt and pepper shaker for this entree). We also had the steaks topped with mushrooms. The mushrooms were good, but they were not sautéed, so they were a little dry and lacked some seasoning. The lobster tail had a slight unusual flavor....it is hard to describe....but I would say it had a hint of woody/nutty flavor to it. As for the location and decor: We ate in the main dinning room, overlooking Fremont street (by the way, anyone who is a fan of the movie Casino will recognize this place immediately, as one of the resturuants the Robert De Niro character has a big fight with his wife at). The resturant's view is not as good as it used to be, as a large two story platform was built at the end of Fremont Street, which blocks a good portion of the resturant's view of Fremont street (I am not sure if this structure is permanent or temporary, but it definitely is a view blocking eye sore). The interior decor is nice, but nothing exceptional (certainly no where near as elegant as some of the high end resturuants on the strip). But it does have an old world Vegas charm that you may find appealing. Overall, this is a decent resturuant, but there are so many better steakhouse resturuants in Vegas (in the same price range), that Oscar's would not be my top choice.",jylt6aurOs--IviJliM70w,0,0,3,dkOjo-D6-4aLojbq37VMUQ

4625638,2017-04-05,1,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"I recently signed up for the IndiCard App for service industry workers to receive a discount from restaurants. So my husband and I saw Oscar's had a 20% off offer and wanted to give them a try. We walked in Tuesday night with no reservation and were seated promptly in the center most table facing down Fremont st. We were impressed by the ambiance and the view and were both super excited to dine there expecting nothing but an exceptional dining experience. Boy... were looks deceiving. Our waitress approached our table and I immediately told her about my IndiCard discount because I know as a server I like to know about discounts ahead of time. She wasn't familiar with the card, which I understood because I was new to it as well, and said she needed to ask her manager which was fine. About 7 min later a well dressed man who I assumed was a manager approached and noticed we only still had water and asked if we were ready to order so we told him our entire order... an old fashioned, a fruity cocktail for me, and the filet mignon medium rare Oscar style with 3 sides of Brussels sprouts, creamed corn and onion strings. Our drinks arrived, they were ok, the old fashioned was kinda syrupy. Our food arrived with all three side and the filet mignon but not Oscar styled. We informed the food runner that was missing and he went to find the server. As we waited we cut into the filet which was burnt on the outside and blue on the inside. My husband and I both felt it tasted like whopper meat from Burger King it was so charred. Our sever returned to tell us our ""Oscar style"" was on its way and we told her our filet tasted burnt. She took it to have a new one made and we were left with out creamed corn, Brussels sprout and onion straw sides left on the table so we ate those. Another 10-15 min went by and we finished our sides without being checked on by our server or manager who took our order. By then I realized we had been there a while and all we had to show were ok drinks, bread, and side dishes that were now either gone or cold and we had no steak or apology for how long it was all taking. So I decided for the first time
In my service industry life to grab my husband and get up and leave without paying for anything. I would normally tip too because it sometimes isn't the servers fault but I believe it was all around a bad experience from every person we interacted with. I walked right up to the manager who took our order and told him how severely disappointed I was in our service and I just wanted to leave and we did. It's so sad they have such a wonderful ambiance and dining room that screams you should have a great dining experience but unfortunately I will never go back again... discount or not.",b-QBXPiLxKth98KDrDcgiQ,0,0,1,Q4MkVCwttuob-NZAofet_A

This leads me to have a strong hunch the meats are just regular USDA cuts, and most likely not aged or anything of that sorts.

As for the sides, they were ok - I can quite frankly make better mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. It just wasn't really there as much as it tried.

If you're feeling like cleaning yourself up a bit and enjoying a very nice atmosphere in a well decorated steakhouse; then you'll do fine with Oscar's.  Only in Vegas could you get away with a sign that says ""Booze, Beef and Broads""!  I wish I could remember the bartender who served me my dinner.  He was polite, fun to talk to, efficient and professional.  He fit the atmosphere of this classy place perfectly.  I had this one cut of steak that was literally infused with garlic; and lightly seasoned with peppers. I wish I could remember the name of that steak..I'm forgetting everything!  
One thing I won't forget is letting you know that you'll have an exciting dining experience if you get to the 2nd floor and stop in at Oscar's.  There's even a piano there; but no one was playing while I was there. Oh...The Caesar Salad wasn't really anything special; and even though it had a hint of anchovies; the dressing bordered on bland.  The mashed potatoes were a bit runny.  I'm sure they intentionally served them that way; but the consistency wasn't really to my liking.  They were flavorful, though. 

Even if you miss their Happy Hour; you won't mind spending a bit more for the wonderful service, atmosphere, and great steaks.  I'll probably come here every other time I'm in Vegas...That's because I'm a cheap skate!",4zjP4hB8SuO1eidapzk4Vg,0,0,4,pY2P9LzLd3yFHIf0VCXw9Q

We showed up on a Thursday which was ladies night. I had a Bellini of all drinks -lol and my wife had a free Corona.

We ordered the sliders, crab cakes and meatballs, which were all discounted for happy hour.
The Sliders were amazing and had some sort of either marinade or teriyaki taste to them. 
my wife had the crab cakes and said it was the best she had and the meatballs were fluffy and filling!

We were hoping to meet Oscar but was told he only shows up early in the week. The bartender was friendly and inviting. This place is upscale and almost seems out of place to be in the Plaza Casino/Hotel.

5181449,2016-02-04,2,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Welcome to Oscar's. We arrived early and checked in then went to the bar for a beverage. The Bar tender was friendly and responsive and had great recommendations for their craft cocktails. When our party was finally all together we contacted hostess and was promptly seated. There were several large parties so it was a little loud. Our drink orders were taken and were not exactly promptly brought. Our waitress was Lenore and our bus person was Maria. This may sound trite, but when asking for a diet coke most places ask if Diet Pepsi okay. Oscar's did not ask and some in our party do not care for Diet Pepsi. They should specify. (or Not??). I like that the Menu is one piece of paper on a cardboard backing. Finally our drinks arrive. We did not order wine because our waitstaff never returned after we said we were deciding on wine. Once they did return we just decided to order our main courses.
Our orders; Manny's stuffed shrimp. Shrimp was over cooked and tough to even cut. flavor lacked seasoning. Josie ordered Prime Rib medium  with Caesar Salad, Salad bland did not have capers, but that is a probably a taste I like in the salad but not many do it that way anymore. Her Prime Rib was more rare than medium was tough and lacked favor as well. I also ordered Prime Rib Mid Rare which came more rare (I can mostly be okay with that). Blue Cheese wedge.(Bleu). Could have used more dressing but the cheese crumbles were sufficient. Also a wedge to me is old fashioned wedge not one that is broken in four parts on plate. The other guests had 8oz Filet (more like 4oz). It was cooked correctly with good flavor but lacked a few ounces. Cedar Planked Blackened Salmon, Cooked a little more done than our guest liked however the flavor was good. Wonder if strong seasoning covers lack of a great cook on the fish. We had the three sides for $20. Steamed Asparagus, this was salted but it seamed like an after thought not cooked in for flavor(cooking 101). So no real flavor, however, properly cooked. Smashed Potatoes, Warm around edges and cold in the middle and bland to the taste. Finally Potatoes Au Gratin, Not sure what this really was. It seamed like half shredded potatoes and whole. Had a white cheese on top and as the Smashed, cold in the middle. These potatoes also had a funky flavor and a texture that is unable to explain. At one point we had a Manger(we assume) stop and ask how things were. We responded with ""It's Okay"". No real response to this and she rambled on with some touristy rambling about our seat location. Not sure what this interaction was(Awkward, uncomfortable). In to the side dishes, we were told they were share size so I imagined A family style big plate. Each one except for Asparagus was more of a decent size for a side dish. 
Since it was my Birthday they brought me a piece of Cheesecake with a candle. The Cheesecake tasted like it had been defrosted recently and had that freezer burn taste you get once thawed. The candle may have tasted better.
For the most part our wait staff was attentive and drinks were kept filled. 
We had great expectations and half our party had been before and said it was quite different. As a rule we are just simple blue collar people who save up to go out and have a meal beyond our normal budget. Sometimes our meals are worth the expense, this, however was not. No photos, nothing stood out as a wow factor. Maybe the cook staff was focused on the big parties and we just took a back seat to the good food. 
Goodbye Thank you for coming. We did not have an Exit farewell from the staff. (We may have left from the wrong door maybe). I can say I will not be back. The hype was not as good as reality. No Broads...I thought they had some showgirls or something. I can not recommend going here unless you like over priced, bland, over/under cooked, and freezer burnt food.",QtuzG4-zmGTdB0jSMC54tg,6,2,2,8AHv1Csy8FNhdXnpuur8_g
5213222,2011-12-26,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"I guess I should have read the other reviews before going? We made dinner reservations for Christmas. I called before 5 PM and left a message as directed by the voicemail with my name, number, date and time of the reservation, how many and contact number. They open at 5PM so I expected a call back by 5:30 PM, Not! I called back at 6:15PM and after the language barrier of the person who took my reservation I was set.
We arrived at 4:40 PM for a 5:00 Reservation and were directed to the bar to wait unit we could be seated. Drinks were well made but a little pricey even by most restaurant standards. We were seated a little after 5 and we found the decor and table arrangements pleasing. If you do go ask for a table overlooking Freemont Street.
Our Waitress was pleasant and friendly when she came over and offered up the wine list, which we declined. We ordered several appetizer's and the Ceaser Salad. While we waited we ordered Iced tea and water and that was delivered in a reasonable time. The Crab Cakes were good as was the Tomato and Mozzarella platter. The Salad was drenched in dressing and I was unable to eat it and sent it back. The Waitress claims she spoke to the Manager and took it off the check (I will cover that later). After the appetizers we were served a cold bread basket and no butter. After about 5 minutes the Bus Person came back with the butter and reaching over my Mothers head dropped it in the middle of the table. As one of the other reviews said the bread was cold and the butter was actually bland with no taste.
Our Waitress came over to let us know she was going to place our meal orders and it would be about 15 minutes or so. That's fine we were in no hurry. During this time we had to ask for water refills and Iced Tea. It seems that everyone just walked around but paid no attention to the tables? While we were sitting there the Bus Person reached over and took my Wife's bread plate off the table for no apparent reason. My wife had a dirty knife from the Tomato Salad and when she tried to give it to her she told her to keep it and reuse it.
During our wait one of the Hostesses making the rounds stopped by our table and my wife mentioned this to her. She brought a new plate and knife for her. After that our table was ignored by the Managers who walked around and the Hostess, though they did visit one or two tables for long periods of time (I guess High Rollers).
Our waitress checked back and told us a 5-7 minutes for our dinner. We waited 12 but Good Food takes time. If this was good food I would have not minded. My 6 oz Steak was perfect inside (medium rare) but had no taste to it at all. My wife's Prime Rib was dry and there was no offer of any Au jus Sauce to moisten it up. My Mothers Salmon was over done and burnt on the outside. The side dishes were ok, nothing special just ok. None of us finished our dinners and we did not request to pack them up. (These are signs good Managers look at when their customers are still at their tables).
We declined dessert for obvious reasons an our Waitress gave us the option of her returning with our check or did we want to wait 5 or 10 minutes. I asked for it right away so I did not have to sit their and think about the experience. She disappeared and after about 6 or 7 minutes came back and dropped of a final check with no listing of what we had so I could not tell if the Salad had been removed. Had she come back or someone else was close I would have asked for an itemized bill. They also did not ask for ID on my Credit Card which is not signed on the back for that reason.
For a small place with so many Servers Bus Persons, etc the attention to detail is minimal. Everyone runs around but it seems nothing gets done. We had high hopes for this to be a return to destination with friends and family but that is not going to happen.
If you go delight at the venue and the view of Freemont Street, maybe get an appetizer or two and leave.",INKXOZhtBqUyQm4N27nA_Q,15,0,2,jOGIA-n54f0oHruxBHhq4A

Then a 10+ minute wait for a server to approach us. Then only after we asked hosts if there was table service and was told that the waitress visiting with patrons seated at the bar was our server. Tasha, as we learned her name to be, came to serve us only after being approached by host. She took our drink order and the drinks were delivered another 10+ minutes later by a manager without requested garnish ( blue cheese olives ) and no napkin. A while later Tasha reappeared and asked how were our drinks - to which we responded no garnish no napkin - no recognition of bad service by Tasha. She asked our appetizer order - we said we changed our mind - in large part based on bad service, also because 4 of 5 offerings were seafood ( no beef based app in a steak house!).

(there's a bunch of drink & appetizer specials, plus we each got a free glass of wine for checking in on Yelp.) comfy barstools, lots of room for us to spread out and eat, convenient purse-hooks under every seat. the only ding for ambiance is that the bar was SUPER loud (and only got louder about halfway into our meal) and i could barely talk to my friend without SCREAMING at her. service-wise, Steve was a gem. (not to mention fine as helllll. hey boo hey.)

the food was delicious. i had the beef carpaccio. (which was on special for $9, usually it's $17.) next time i'll order it sans capers, but the beef & mustard aoili were both delicious. i also had the burrata & heirloom tomato salad with microgreens which was killer. my friend had the spicy flank steak, which was insane. i may have to get it next time. if you're the type of person to get excited about finding whole cloves of spicy garlic hiding in your steak, this is the dish for you.

if you're staying downtown and craving steak, Oscar's is an extremely solid choice.

Caesar Salad- Excellent 
Filet Minion- Delicious. 

There are three reasons I am not giving this 5 stars- 

1) The wine selection was way overpriced. $50 for a bottle of Chateau St. Michelle from WA? I don't think so...
Simple and common economics shows us that if you reasonably price goods, consumers will purchase more goods overall. We would have purchased the bottle at $37, giving you a $17 dollar profit, but instead we didn't purchase anything because it was overpriced. 


2) Again with the wine... No Chianti? Really..? C'mon. 

3) The hispanic lady who was bussing our table on 3/4 at 5:30 pm was overly aggressive and bored. She kept interrupting our conversation every five minutes asking if we wanted more water. 
NO. For the millionth time! 
Then she tried taking our plates before we were finished. 
We were trying to enjoy dinner and an nice view. 
Just because we weren't shoveling food in our mouth-holes like ravenous beasts, didn't mean we were finished. She wouldn't leave us alone!!!

The tag line is; Beef, booze, and broads. They do have all three. The beef was decent. I had the steak tartare and the New York strip. The tartare is the better of the two. The chopped salad with the peppercorn dressing was better than the caesar as well. That tend to be the trend with most of the items on their menu. If we ordered two items, one was the crowd favorite. I do have to make a special note about the jumbo lump crab cakes. They are spectacular. The separation in meat was impressive. It was predominantly crab. If you want to try more than one side, the option of pick any three for $15 is a small savings. The portions are big, so it is easy to share. We got the jumbo baked potato, corn brulee, and sweet potato wedges. The sweet potato was the favorite. It came with a honey jalapeno dipping sauce. I would definitely order it again if I went back.

As for booze, their bartenders are good. I have had better Manhattans, but it was nothing to frown upon. My friend tried a cable car for the first time and enjoyed it. Their specialty drinks all tailor towards the sweet cocktail drinkers.

The broads are present as well. As we were being sat, we saw a girl in a gown with a large head dress was walking around. Near the end, she asked if everything was to our liking.

As for the food, I've had better steak, bread, and sides at just about every other steakhouse I've been to.  We each ordered filet mignon and shared our sides - creamed spinach, corn brulee, and garlic potato wedges.  Our complimentary bread was an onion bread which I personally wasn't too crazy about.  I liked the garlic potato wedges the best which basically just tasted like a cut-up baked potato.  Btw they ran out of the prime rib over an hour before closing which one of my dining companions was set on ordering so that was rather disappointing.

The place was about half full and there were plenty of windows available. The waiter was borderline rude and annoyed with us because our friends are from out of town and were late from getting lost. I would get it if the place was packed and they needed to turnover tables. The busser brought dessert before we ordered and did not understand English when we tried to say we didn't order it. Isn't basic English necessary to perform the job duties? I would hate to get dessert that had been sitting in front of someone else. Yuck. The food was mediocre. I had skirt steak, which had huge cloves of garlic embedded somehow. I liked it alright. The potatoes were ice cold. Husband had filet. Said it was OK. Friends said the prime rib and fish were great. But neither ate more than a few bites. I think for the food and service it was ridiculously overpriced. $196 before tip for 4 dinners, no wine. Sorry Oscar, I think you need new management. I don't see this place lasting long. The caliber of Fremont street people won't spend that and locals won't return. As usual I would have preferrred Outback. That's rather sad. Return?

Happy hour runs 4-7 pm, though it's a little vague, I had to ask about what it actually included. Was told beer and well drinks were half off. As they had no beer on tap, I went for a house margarita and the other person in my party, after some pondering, went with a Midori sour, served straight up. Midori isn't a well, so no happy hour pricing, but bar tender didn't correct us nor did he actually realize it, I overheard his co- worker correct him in a hushed voice later. 
 We also ordered calimari, which is priced on a menu at $8, incredibly reasonable for a nice steak house. The portion is so enormous, we couldn't finish it. Sadly, however, it totally lacked flavor and seasoning, just lots of heavily breaded, though thankfully well cooked and not over fried fare. 
 The bill arrived in two separate parts, one for food and one for drinks, sort of unusual. The calimari was actually cheaper than listed on the menu, so I'm guessing there's some sort of mysterious happy hour pricing involved with appetizers as well.

5610117,2015-01-16,4,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"I would imagine back in the day this could have easily been one of your 5 star restaurants in Vegas.  However, do yourself a favor and DO go before the end of this era completely has been diminished with all the techno, opulence and glitz Vegas has now become right down to the gin and tonic that has become the redbull and vodka. 

It's a shame what this place represents is going fast that if you miss going, you'll miss living an experience you might not be able to find soon.  Even if it's just to check out the memorabilia on the walls near the restroom of what may be (crossing my fingers it hasn't) a by-gone era.

There is a history to Vegas; a vibe and certainly an attitude down to the description on it's website still a place where broads ""will roam the Downtown Las Vegas restaurant as hostesses, adding to the glamorous and uniquely Vegas style of Oscar's.""  Yes there was certainly an older legendary looking guy who I'm sure has more stories of old Vegas to share with you who roamed the restaurant as a host.   I was waiting to take my picture with him but of course he was only talking with the good looking broad in the restaurant! (Duh!)

And as a thorn in the side reminder of this reality of an era gone by, the amazing Vegas view this restaurant is known for has been somewhat covered up by the stupid zip liner right in front.  Sure the colors of the ceiling look cool if only the zip liner stage could just get out of the way! 

And like the attitude I so remember and sometimes miss of Vegas back in the day where you would go for some gambling and a gin and tonic, a smoke and stuff that really does ""stay in Vegas"" my description of the food is well; it's a steakhouse served up by the old legends of what they would consider very good food. The Rib Eye is as big as the serving plate, the potatoes are finger licking scrumptious and the bread has been more buttered up than the woman you came with.

The larger issue was, someone at the table had a good amount of sentiment in the bottom of his wine glass.  Not sure what it was, but they were the size of grass blades.   When pointed out to the server, he did nothing, and offered nothing - not even replacing the glass.  

Finally, while the server was friendly, he was far too friendly.   We were not there to socialize with him.  He hung around the table far too long, telling jokes, sharing stories.

Also, the French onion soup was amazing, this is the French onion soup that has started my love of French onion soup.

The restaurant is in the plaza and overlooks the freemont street experience (you can see the view of this restaurant in the movie casino where Robert dinero and Sharon stone are having dinner). Great atmosphere and very friendly wait staff. The only thing that didn't make sense was the ""broads"" thing.. There are ladies that walk around and talk to you to help give you the vibe of the old days I guess I don't know.

I started off in the bar area, which has a happy hour every day, including weekends.  It is a really cool area and the bartenders are great, along with the drinks.

For dinner I had the salmon and the filet, which did not disappoint.  Oddly enough, one of the standouts of the dinner was the dessert, though.  We got a layered chocolate mousse, that was the best I have ever had.

It's not cheap, but if you are looking for a really nice dinner in downtown Vegas, Oscar's won't disappoint.",LwvPZ1bQt5-Zl1xxPberVQ,1,1,4,-6sj1oivWi2vx_sNv4OHKQ

Not a cozy place for a date.
Many things on the menu were not available so we settled for the Mob Meatballs by default.
Pretty good but we would have rather ordered dinner.
Has that going out of business feel to it.

Very expensive.
Booze prices well more than double the rest of Fremont St.
Especially if you like premium or high premium drinks you'll really pay through your ass.

Not a destination that's for sure.
The Plaza itself still has that ghetto, ashtray-stink, piss and lysol smelly, bus-station-in-defeat atmosphere that lingers in and sticks to you.

Can't imagine every going back especially with several other much better places to choose from just a short walk / $6 Uber ride away.",BCy-Hut597GtNvlnx3pB4Q,2,0,3,cNKebNZcJHYhpgfDsQ4cSg
5837868,2012-07-24,9,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"Now that my recent 3-star reviews are out of the way, I can share a new, surprisingly enjoyable find before I enter a short period of temporary hibernation.  The place is Oscar's Beef  Booze Broads.  Yes, our previous mayor's steakhouse that opened to some disappointment and poor Yelp reviews!  I'm glad I waited until some kinks were taken out of the delivered product.  I'm sure I experienced marked improvement on my recent visit, because I was quite impressed by my dining experience here.  All was not perfect, but overall it was a 4-1/2-star dining experience.

Let's begin at the beginning.  For starters I selected Johnny Quinn's Crab Cakes, which featured large hunks of fresh lump crabmeat, Stoned Ground Dijon Mustard Sauce, and Pepper Remoulade.  The pair of crab cakes had very little filler as our waiter had declared, and the Pepper Remoulade was especially mellow and tasty as an accent to go with the crab.

Next up for me was Crazy Phil's Onion Soup.  At first I was a little disappointed in its physical appearance because, unlike most classic Onion Soups Gratinee, this crock of soup did not have a crusty crown of cheese overlaying the broth.  But once I tasted this beauty, my initial negative visual impression went quickly out of mind.  Made with sherry infused white wine, veal stock, a deconstructing crouton, and Gruyere Cheese, the sweet broth and other ingredients were simply delicious.  This was a truly outstanding and hot French Onion Soup!

Complimentary Onion Bread with visible pink onions was also very good as a starter, but I didn't want to continue eating Onion Bread all night, so I backed off after downing two slices with butter.  Oscar's Chopped Salad was artistically crafted in a nicely shaped circular mound of creamed up chopped vegetables topped by sprouting Onion Straws.  The salad, containing Grape Tomatoes, carrot shavings, Italian Squash, and mostly diced zucchini tossed with Maytag Bleu Cheese was cool, creamy, and refreshing.

An interesting twist then occurred as large steak knives were laid out for the men in my dining party, while much more slender and petite steak knives were set out for the women.  (See pic.)  Diane bridled a bit at this, and so I asked our server why females were not provided the same knives as males.  With a serious expression, he replied that it was more appropriate to furnish the men with ""a manly man's knife,"" and women with ""an elegant lady's knife.""  I suppose whether a person views this practice as sexist or chivalrous depends on one's point of view.  It also could be deliberately done a bit tongue in cheek, reflecting upon the image of ""Beef, Booze, and Broads"" which the restaurant plays up rather than down in a whimsical sort of way.  Soon after we were seated, a comely, white-gloved buxom blonde in a lacy black gown came over to welcome us; she said she was ""one of the broads.""  (See pic.)

My slightly charred medium-rare Filet was cooked perfectly, and went well with a very tasty house-made Bearnaise Sauce.  A large King Crab Leg that Diane and I split was warm rather than hot, and not very sweet; and the Drawn Butter to go with it was not very hot either.  But Lobster Mashed Potatoes were very hot and very good, except for the two tiny pieces of shell that were encountered.  Wild Mushrooms were a very good second topping for my steak, as I made sure that my stomach was fully indulged this particular night.

And to complete a fine meal, the oven-baked Apple Cobbler with Cinnamon Bread Crumbs that I chose, which was made in a La Cocotte Staub all-metal Dutch oven and served with a strawberry, raspberries, and blackberries on the side, and with two large scoops of quickly melting Vanilla Ice Cream on top, was as delicious as it sounds!

With many tables and booths facing the Fremont Street Experience and sumptuously decorated, amid a nice airy ambiance, with white-tied waiters taking orders  under a glass ceiling, this is one classy place turning out memorable meals.  Hizzoner should be proud of his new downtown eating palace!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,17,17,4,S_tigMdZcCIulp6Rm38-Gg

5850628,2017-10-26,1,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"I have always wanted to try Oscar's Steakhouse and this week while attending a convention at The Plaza I had the opportunity. The restaurant is small and intimate by Las Vegas steakhouse standards and affords an interesting even if obstructed view of the Downtown Freemont Street Experience. I was greeted and seated promptly at a nice table and after checking in with Yelp given a complimentary glass of Pinot Noir which was very nice. I took the waiter's suggestion and ordered the Prime New York steak, sautéed mushrooms on the side and creamed spinach. I passed on a salad as I was sure I wouldn't even finish what I had ordered (I was correct). While sampling fresh baked onion bread I noticed the appetizers being enjoyed at an adjoining table and couldn't help but wish I had been eating with enough friends to warrant an appetizer or two. The calamari and the assorted cold cut/cheese plate looked wonderful. My dinner arrived after a reasonable wait and I was very pleased with the steak. My waiter was spot on; the New York steak was tender, delicious and done perfectly. The mushrooms were just good and complimented the steak. The creamed spinach was disappointing particularly since I had that at Ruth's Chris two weeks ago and it was terrific there. Still the meal was very good overall due to the steak. The service was very good and attentive.
One note is that the clientele were well dressed particularly by current Las Vegas norms. That made the entire evening a bit nicer.
I'm happy I tried Oscar's and wouldn't mind going back with a group especially to try a couple of the appetizer dishes. I would order the same steak but not the mushrooms or spinach; maybe a salad instead.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,1,1,4,t28GIdjVtgT6cM3HwD0gBg
5876938,2014-09-01,2,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"The food and ambiance was near perfection if only the service  would have lived up to everything else.

I took my Fiancé out for a staycation to Fremont st and ventured down to Oscar's as she loves the ""old Vegas"" feel of downtown. We had a window seat and the tint on the window makes the view a gold yellow antique feel as you watched the crowd shuffling down on the street. I couldn't have asked for much better than that.

The food, Awesomely cooked to perfection filet mignon. Good Mac n Cheese, great mashed potatoes so creamy and rich I could have eaten them all night. The fiancé had a great looking salad and a huge baked potato with tons of liquid butter you couldn't take a bite without dumping butter on the table. 

Service was poor however. Our waiter we guessed evaluated us as a two top and minimum tip and spent much more time interacting with the 4 & 7 tops in his section. They were offered specials, we received a pitty smile. Our glasses were empty most of the dinner, glad I brought in a bottle of water. They were served multiple drinks and bottles of wine. My beer was empty and no second was offered.  When we finished I wanted desert but skipped it as we then spent at least 15 mins with empty plates and glasses before the bus lady came to clear the table without our receiving the bill yet.

We mentioned the service on the way out and the manager wanted to make it right lower the bill etc but we refused. The food was spectacular and that was all that saved our experience here.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,8,2,3,D2V-MeG9RH7QaLBntmkn4g

He doesn't even pack your leftovers.  Gave you boxes & bag to pack them yourself. For this price, that should be a no brainer. Too bad coz food was great.

5928902,2012-09-29,0,JRh14J_be0jl7Wbt412vDA,"We find ourselves in downtown pretty often because of out-of-town visitors who like to stay at hotels on the Fremont. This place always made me curious because honestly it seems too fancy for the Plaza. On the other hand, I heard from a co-worker that the food here was actually good. So on one random night, a few hours before the restaurant opened, we made a last minute decision to eat here. I called and was able to get a reservation. The restaurant is located on the second floor in a dome that is overlooking Fremont Street. Apparently, the location used to be the hotel's swimming pool back in the day.

Unfortunately, we didn't get a table by the window, but that's okay. We could still see all of Fremont at our table in the middle of the room. Service was great. Our server was friendly and was very knowledgeable with the menu. The other servers were very attentive as well, taking away empty plates immediately and refilling our drinks promptly. Here is what we ordered:

-Johnny Quinn's Crab Cakes: very good! Hot, tasty, and we liked how it was basically just crab. There were a few pieces of red peppers in there but you could barely taste them. The mustard sauce was a nice touch as well.
-Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese: our server said it was made with 5 types of cheese, but it was very bland. Something to avoid.
-Steamed Asparagus: my husband said that they weren't very good and it was a bit cold.
-Joey C's Filet Mignon (8 oz): this was awesome! Cooked right and very easy to cut. It was very flavorful and melt in your mouth good!
-Prime Rib (Carolyn's Cut): my husband ordered this and enjoyed it. His favorite restaurant for Prime Rib will always be Lawry's, but he said it was pretty close!

i was looking forward to dessert, but their kitchen went down while we were there. Our server said that the fans in the kitchen stopped working and they kept setting off the fire alarms in the hotel. We were one of the lucky tables to get our food. The staff was apologizing to other customers who didn't have a chance to order anything. 

I would come back again for sure because of the great steak and service. Maybe next time we can convince family members to come along and hope that they will take care of the bill! :P

A table for two is set up so that you sit side by side like you are going to watch a show.  This is less intimate and makes it difficult to just have a nice dinner conversation.  It is also disappointing to see so many people show up to a nice steakhouse is shorts, t shirts and flip flops.  Why there is not a minimum dress code in the main restaurant is unknown because Oscars does have a pretty amazing old Las Vegas feel to it.   The steak was amazing (bone in rib eye for me, filet Oscar for my wife)  the portion size for sides are a bit off, almost too big for one person but too small to share.  The chopped salad was fresh and prepared just right.

The butter was where the expression ""like butter"" came from.  It was so smooth and warm.  My goodness. Yum.

The reason I give this place 3 stars instead of 5 is because even though the food is splendid, the price isnt.  A steak is a minimum of 40-something dollars.   What the heck.  Am i made of money?
