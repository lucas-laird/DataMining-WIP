Wanted to show the place to my brother who recently moved nearby. Waitress took order at 9:55 and was helpful. We ordered from the late nite happy hour menu, sliders, pizza, beers, and one fish stew. Beers then arrived on time, still waiting till 10:30 for food and asked waitress to check; she offered us bread because of the delay. Checked on food again at 10:45. Food arrived at 10:55.

Last time I ordered the iceberg wedge and the blue cheese dressing was generous and delicious. The bacon was perfectly crisp and had a nice smoked flavor to it. Really good. This time I ordered the goat cheese bruchetta and it was really good too. I'm not sure if the honey drizzle was real honey or not, but the taste was spot on. Both items were on their Small Plate menu and cost $4 and $5 respectively. The portions were perfect for a light lunch and it was    probably under priced given the quality of food you get.

Winterbock beer- great carmel chocolate flavor but ours were a little flat & not cold enough for me.

Chili- Impressive. very tasty & hearty.. a cup wasn't so small. shared it with my husband.

basic side salad- ordered this as my app & it's not so basic..lol. spiced pecans, tom, cucumber, cheddar cheese, pepper jack cheese & jalepeno ranch!!! YuM yUm!

California Cobb flatbread- the fresh greens they tossed in balsamic vinegrette dressing then put on top, is what completes the taste of this flatbread.. must try. loved that they didn't use blue cheese!

161552,2013-10-17,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"If you've lived in Vegas for any length of time you have probably been invited to join a group of coworkers for Happy Hour at Gordon Biersch at some point. I've been there countless times in the 9+ years I've lived here for going away parties, or just random group gatherings, but never gave much thought to the quality of the food. So when I was recently sent over there during the day for another work related item, the suggestion arose for me to take the opportunity and check out the burger. I can't say anyone has mentioned their burger to me throughout my time as 'burger blogger', so I was a bit skeptical by this idea but gladly took on the challenge as I always do.

There are two Biersch locations in town, the long standing one on Paradise near the airport, and a newer location in Summerlin. I actually haven't been to the one in Summerlin because there are far better selections in the area if I'm going to bother eating around there. The same could be said for the Paradise location, but it's probably the cheaper of the touristy selections around there. The exterior of the restaurant is still pretty cool, but the interior's 'brewery' look is starting to seem a bit dated. Whether you're there for lunch or dinner the place is always fairly populated between the close proximity to convention halls and hotels as well as the adjacent office parks. There are plenty of seats around the bar/lounge, as well as booths and tables both inside and out. The menu is all over the place with appetizers, pizzas, sandwiches, desserts, you name it. While they may not offer the healthiest options, they do have a decent Happy Hour with a few good snacks.

While pondering which of their Knife & Fork Burgers to try the waitress suggested an off-the-menu but highly popular Swiss and mushroom burger, which also happens to be one of my favorites so I jumped on it. Served with a large knife skewered through it, the massive burger looked great upon arrival. The flaky, gooey bun was quite good and very well-proportioned to the meat. The patty seemed to be pre-formed, but of good quality; the char flavor was present upon the first few bites but got a little lost with everything else once I really got into it. The mushrooms had great flavor, and the Swiss was melted well but not incredibly present. Overall it was very juicy, flavorful, and a huge surprise.

Their 'legendary' fries are good, but actually a bit too garlicky for me. Also the whole batch was a bit undercooked and soggy so they weren't the best example that day. You get a huge portion, easily enough for two people if you're looking to share. $11.50 for this burger is a great deal considering its size, quality, large portion of fries, and proximity to convention-oriented hotels. While I hate spending $2.95 for an iced tea, $15.62 is still not a bad deal for everything you get. Swap that with a beer and you've got yourself a pretty good meal.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,4,9xY_5PI31kGCvpWWpzq_8A

On being told that the period is beyond the restaurant waiting policy, they still charged us for the dishes. 
And when you the food did arrive, the steak was burned and the mussels were not even cooked. This meant sending the food back and waiting for it to be cooked again.

Additionally, we had our private dining room (the Marzen room), got to take a private tour of the brewery, and thoroughly enjoyed our two hour open bar!

Best of all, this VIP-style experience was reasonably priced (under $100 pp, including all taxes and tips!). Would highly recommend Gordon Biersch to anyone planning a large group dinner in las Vegas!",oa76FUX19b2QciPVr-7IFw,0,0,5,HlCaAYJSujoqtorGMv4leg

Calamari. Please, don't serve this. Literally little chewy rubber bands of bland breading. Zero stars. 

The famous garlic fries. Way over done and not nearly enough garlic! One star. 

Southwestern rolls were yummy. Spicy and full of flavor. Four stars. 

Flat bread pizza. Just a complete miss. Nothing artisan or quality or even ho hum about what came out. It was tiny and completely lacking any touch. Zero stars. 

The ONLY reason I'm giving this experience two stars was because the server was doing his best to make up for really, really off food.

271749,2013-03-09,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"After having visited their other location in Las Vegas, I was incredibly disappointed on many levels. 

I had come to expect a certain level of service. I don't mean speed alone - I realize I visited on a Friday night and that it would be busy. But the staff was impersonal, uninterested, and acted as if they were getting paid $30/hr. no matter how they treated us. 

The food, though I don't know how, didn't even compare to the other location. The signature garlic fries were soggy, rather than crisp, and the fresh parsley that usually tops the lot had apparently wilted under a heat lamp. Fresh chopped garlic was seemingly an afterthought (on GARLIC fries?), as it was unsoftened and spicy.

The turkey burger looked, tasted, and felt like leftover meatloaf. Not leftover from last night, but maybe last week. The fresh avocado was the only saving grace, though the steamed veggies on the side weren't hurting anything.

I don't usually give restaurants too hard of a time on the weekends, but the combined service, flavor (or lack of both) was offensive.",9gf4vMja2w9dxFH0u-3W6w,0,0,1,cgC-lD6_8fyXWGGmtQSPQw

Staff: Waitress was nice, smiling and polite. She went along with some of the witty banter me and the lady were spewing. She was prompt and checked on us often, refiling the free bevs each pass. 

Food: OK so maybe I am an Italian from NY and I have high expectations for pizza, however they did have a Margarita flat bread on the happy hour menu and figured it was worth on try. Turns out I should have held out for elsewhere. The 'flatbread' was more of a crispy communion wafer then actual bread. The ingredients on the top did not do it any justice either. We each got the harvest chicken salad (not be design, i was hoping to critique 2 dishes but it was exactly what I was craving (salad with chicken, pecans, raisins, apples, etc). It was actually a sizable portion and I ended taking some home. It was good, but not great. The dressing was lackluster, but the chicken was really good. Felt like maybe I should have found a chicken dish on its own and tried that

Ambiance: Actually has a good feel to it. Plenty of light and space - doesn't feel like you are in a hole of a bar like some of these places. Wasn't too busy (Tuesday early evening). But the bar was full by the time we left around 730

Happy hours - looks like a pretty decent deal, some cheap food, however I cant comment on quality as I only had the flatbread (see above food). Tuesdays they have $2.50 beers, just not specialty/bottled, so no cider for me ($5)

Overall - I like the feel in there, just wasn't big on the food. But the staff was nice and I feel like I will probably give it another go and try something else on the menu",7C0Tw-SIYjUMVXE8OH71HQ,0,0,3,Kzgyr7WHcwZztAKKy3FTBg

I tried the fries from my friends dish and those were ok.  From the rumors, I was expecting a lot of flavor, and didn't get much.  I ate the remainder because they were ok, but mostly because my stir fry was so small.

There was no onion in there at all as far as I could tell...  the filet mignon sliders were supposed to be 2 ounces... well if they were a half an ounce that is generous.  They were tasteless and smelled like old beef.  The brats were tasteless.  The pretzel roll was probably the best thing we ate... and that's not saying much.  Even the mustard was tasteless and old tasting.  We have always loved the beer but this evening, even the beer was bad.  The Maibock was flat and tasted turned.  The Pilsner was underwhelming and also flat... far beneath our prior experience.  Happy Hour prices for beer went up and no one informed us of that.

979899,2014-03-03,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"We dined here this evening and I had such high hopes for this place, mostly because I've been to the location at Boca Park and the service and food is always great.

Being restaurant managers and coming from food service backgrounds ourselves my boyfriend and I tend to take it easy on our fellow comrades, but this was a little crazy. The only reason we are giving one star is because we could tell most of the issues might have been resolved if the poor waitress didn't have so many tables in her section.

To begin our party was a surprise dinner planned by myself and a friend for her husband. Everyone was to arrive by 6:45 and the birthday boy was to arrive promptly at 7pm. At 6:53pm the hostess came over to our table where 95% of us had already arrived and had our drink order taken and told us that there was a miscommunication and that that table was for another party arriving shortly. According to her our table was ready outside. I asked her if we could make the switch RIGHT AWAY that we would go. She assures me it is, walks out to the patio (maybe unaware I was following her) and proceeds to look bewildered at the scattered empty tables and heaters. Long story short, the guys in our party rushed to put this table together, our table had 2 heaters for 15 of us, we did not receive menus/share plates/silverware for quite sometime, and our server took even longer to take our food order. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: I was not going to write a YELP about this experienced as I noticed all the tables the server had inside (and, again, I tend to take it easy on industry in situations like this), but the kicker came when I politely pulled the manager aside to give him a friendly heads up about the situation and he took zero blame and made no apologies. According to him it was entirely the servers responsibility to ask for help and as far as he was concerned all the tables he saw of hers were doing good (although he mentioned the only table he didn't know about, conveniently, was ours). Interesting to know given that I walked to the restroom and host stand several times for separate reasons, keeping my eyes peeled for a manager that was never there. In my professional opinion it is NEVER OK to make excuses to your guest and blame your staff. Was this guy serious? My intention was to give him a friendly heads up as a fellow restaurant manager and instead I left feeling more disappointed and a little bit disgusted.

My hope is that this particular manager reads this YELP and realizes the effect of his words and demeanor. Customer service rule #1 : The guest is always right. (even when they're not) and in this case we definitely were. Not sure I care to give this place another try in the near future. Hope this helps GM (I'm assuming this manager was not the GM).",isMA_MrPns_6tzUwp0qUWQ,3,0,1,0eqoqGk4ASz1VIuwRWv-AA

I assumed they had me confused with someone else. I asked how much ""I owed"". and he said the amount of my bill which I indeed remembered was the amount I had paid. I went back inside, to show my face to the barmaid who had been taking care of me, and asked if she got the tip. She said she had, but not the bill. How does one get the tip I paid with the change I got from breaking the $100...without remembering breaking the $100?! They ""graciously"" checked her drawer to see if there was an overage, there ""was not"". I don't think that if she took the money, she wouldve put it in her drawer! Rather than concern the police, I paid again (no tip the 2nd time! lol) The warning here is, altho it's a decent place, just pay strict attention when you pay, to whom you pay, and get a receipt!

By the time we picked up the car from the valet it was past 9:30PM and we were STARVING!  All dressed up in our theater finery, we didn't much feel like fast food and the thought came to mind that we had never tried Gordon Biersch on Paradise and it always looked inviting from the outside so we thought, why not?

So glad we took a chance.  We got there about quarter to ten and were quickly seated.  Admittedly, they were not busy at that hour but still, it was nice being attended to so politely and with such courtesy.  Our server came over moments after we were seated and introduced himself to us.  Being that it was our first time there, he went over the menu with us and based on our feedback, made some recommendations for beverage and food.  I ordered one of their craft beers and my sweetie had a glass of wine.  Both were very nice.  For dinner, I ordered the Jambalaya and wifey the Chicken Pasta.  OMG!  Both were so good!  Her Chicken Pasta was full of flavor and my Jambalaya had just the right amount of ""bad"" in it to be wonderful.  Oh, and the desserts?

1427691,2015-03-08,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"The good:  We were promptly seated by a friendly hostess. Our waiter (Jose) was excellent; prompt, professional, personable. He alerted us that the kitchen was running ""a little slow"" so I put in an order for a calamari appetizer before we looked at the menus.
 
The bad: The calamari...without exception, the worst restaurant offering of calamari I've ever had. To be clear: It arrived hot and was served with two ""sauces.""  The rings and tentacles were either  ""hard"" or very chewy...depending on whether you picked a thin ring (hard and without flavor of any kind unless you dipped it in the sauce) or if you picked the tentacles, then you got an equally tasteless morsel....only chewy instead of hard. 

I'm confident they can find a better supplier of calamari than the one they're using. Restaurant management should be all over this, it is a supplier issue not a cooking or wait staff issue.

My wife ordered the fish and chips, it came out hot and very good. Chips were crisp, fish was battered and crisp without being oily. The portion size was large (she was unable to finish). 

I had the lettuce wedge with blue cheese.  You can select either the 1/2 or full portion; I selected the the full. What arrived was a very small wedge of lettuce...I checked to make sure it was the ""full"" portion and was assured that it was. 

If I had to guess, I'd say it was 1/6th of a small (not medium) head of lettuce. There was plenty of blue cheese dressing. 

We had a side of slaw and a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The slaw (very good)  came out with the meal, the waiter advised us that the mashed were not ready but they were working on them. They arrived well after the balance of the food had been served and (mostly) eaten. They were hot and very good...just very late. 

Over all, the service was very good (the only fault I found with service was being given the check without being asked if we wanted dessert).  The kitchen was very slow, the food portion sizes confusing and somewhat disappointing.  Confusing because the fish portions were larger than expected...the lettuce smaller than expected. The calamari? Unnecessarily poor in quality. 
We ordered soft drinks, we did not order alcoholic beverage. The total with tax was $61.",wdpRUUss3hGYWOK2QXJV5A,0,0,2,W5yX_HEeXlN6D7f1-YG4vw

Many many moons ago, shortly after I had turned 21, on a trip with the girls and guy to celebrate our newfound glorious world, we arrived at GB. It was a first. We were curious. Asked the waitress what she suggested. Among other things 
""Why not try the glazed chicken wings with honey and ginger?"" 
""Which beer do you recommend with it?"" 
""Try the Marzen.""

Next, and this is the important part, is the tasting. Take a sip (or two if it pleases you) of beer, a bite through the crispy chicken wings, and another sip of beer. Note how the interaction of the chicken wing sauce pairs PERFECTLY with the beer and brings out subtle flavors and nuances that went previously un-noticed. 

My friends, a fascination for beer, finger foods, and more beer begins here.

And, yes, I HAVE heard, and have experienced the sad decline of quality and consistency of GB over the years. *sigh* a painful sight to taste and watch.

I love the industrial look of this place. And the fact they're brewing their own beers.
Our server was friendly but not really paying attention. He messed up with our order and one out of our three orders came wrong. Then my portion of sweet potato fries came out way smaller than the others. When I told him that, he said he would bring some more as he also noticed it. Never made it to the table though.
The food is very good and served in a good size (except for my fries...). Very tasty.
When it came for us to leave, same thing, the two hosts didn't even care about responding to our goodbyes...

In this case, both were very tasty. I had it topped with thick applewood smoked bacon and onions. I just dipped in a little ketchup. 

I'd heard about the garlic fries and knew I wanted to taste them. They were exceptional. My mouth is watering just writing about them right now. (I will advise you not to have these if you're on a date or headed to one in the following 48 hours because they're very garlicky).

Came here during happy hour which is from 3:30-6:30pm. Not quite sure if that's their only happy hour. Started off with the oatmeal stout beer, which I believe is a limited beer. They have different beers every few weeks depending on what they have in stock. For our appetizer, we had the Southwest wonton nachos which is super big for an appetizer! It's served with wonton chips, black beans, red onions, guacamole, and tomatoes. There's a sauce that's swirled in it, that honestly is everything! 

For my entree I had the smoked chicken and mushroom pasta. So yummy!!!! I love pasta, but I'm usually very picky with it because I like a good cream sauce, but not too saucey, if that makes any sense. And this pasta is just that! Comes with shrimp and chicken and a bit of Parmesan which is just perfect! My boyfriend ordered the California chicken sandwich with a side of garlic fries. Those garlic fries.....so so good! The fries are perfectly cooked with bits of garlic and Parmesan. Just perfect.

The food is good and they're a good spot for lunch unless there is a convention going on in which case they are a lot busier and service tends to slow down.  

Seating at the bar or high tops around the bar is a quick and easy solution for solo or couple diners.  They have several tvs going with whatever big sport events are on at the time and/or financial news if nothing else is happening.  

My biggest problem with Gordon Biersch is something that many people probably enjoy--they frequently change the menu--at least once a quarter if not more.  I joke that I have to re-read the menu every time I go because it changes so often.  The reason I don't like it is that some of my favorite dishes are no longer on the menu.  One my favorite meals here is the Housemade Tacos.

2358788,2015-01-08,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"Eeeeh.
What can I really say about Gordon Biersch. Below expectations? Poor value?

First thing - our bartender had to say ""bro"" every couple seconds. Drove me batty. Also had no clue what an IBU was and tried steering me away from their seasonal beer because it ""comes in a smaller glass"" (it was a 10%abv beer. of course its not served in a larger glass). I'm not looking for cicerone level knowledge - but come on... It's a brewery/restaurant. 

The beer:
I was very underwhelmed. I tried both their standard IPA and season IPA - not impressed. Ended up ordering their Pilsner (hard to mess up a pilsner). Also along side grabbed a bloody mary. The bloody was nothing to get excited about but I wasn't expecting anything really from it.
However - for a place that is a ""brewery"" I expected the beers to be quite a bit better. Nothing really to write home about, very round and bland. Also expected the bartenders to at least have SOME beer knowledge.

Food:
The food was actually really good! I had the crab/artichoke dip and the tenderloin sliders. Food temp was great! Food quality was great! I would come back for the food over anything else.

Value:
When I visited Gordon Biersch I came for happy hour. For two apps/small plates, one beer and one bloody my tab came to $40. Not exactly ""happy hour"" pricing - despite having ordered items that were supposed to be ""happy hour"". Price point was the biggest let-down of all actually. At $40 for a beer, well vodka drink and two apps - you can dine at some phenomenal restaurants here in Vegas. This clearly is not one of them.

The food its self is good - but at the price point there is much better. Because of the poor value I would probably not try this place again.",dMkng5MjkLjzTsawOS31mg,0,0,2,ubKOnY08G8kGxFBCqPoGEQ

I generally sit at the Bar with my favorites bar tender Andy. Since I come during lunch hours I don't usually order the beer but I have tried some of their in house selections. One of the main reasons I come back to GB is due to their wide  variety of options on the menu, not to mention I can order a full lunch of side selections for under $10 . Side of chicken $3.00 side of mash potatoes $2.50 side of veggies 2.50 . Another sandwich I like to order is the California chicken club or the chicken BLT with garlic fries or replace them with any side.
 Their menu is always changing. They even let you order your side of salmon or chicken blackened if you'd like. The burgers are good the salads are descent.

2705923,2011-06-29,1,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"I definitely had my expectations of this place set WAY TOO HIGH.

I came here with a group of friends on a Sunday Brunch. There wasn't much of a wait for it being around 2 in the afternoon. Had a good group of people with us, and as i walk up to the hostess counter and tell her our number of people in our party, all i got was the ""really, that many"" sort of look. The roll of the eyes, the walk away unhappily before staring up and down at our entire groups' clothes, was not in the least pleasant. I'd say the two hostesses were quite rude if you ask me. It's your first priority to make the customers feel welcome the moment they walk in the door, we definitely should have left after the initial greeting, we had no idea it would be the initial horrible experience we should have foreseen at the beginning.

Our large group got the nice little back room to our selves. pretty open, quiet and enough seating for all of us and it was away from the jazz band playing during the Sunday Brunch.  It definitely felt like the restaurant was going for an older scene with the jazz band. Definitely no place for the 20 somethings that we were, walking in our pajamas and sweats after a long night of partying.  Just a bit annoying that when the door to our room was initially closed, they kept opening the door.

So maybe the 9 out of 11 of us, actually order food. Food was overall very good, decent amount of time taken to actually get our drinks, take our order, get our food and then finally get our check. So for prompt service, for the most part, i'll give you guys that.
But one of my friends ordered a tomato juice. just regular plain tomato juice.  A few of us got alcoholic beverages, and got them as soon as we got our waters. but 20 minutes later, we get the tomato juice? seriously? were you guys opening up another can of tomato juice that was in the cellar down stairs, that was behind all the cartons of orange juice and milk?  The Bloody Mary I ordered had tomato juice.... couldn't get the tomato juice from the bar? 
I don't know if it was just our server, but she didn't seem all quite there...
So here's where I absolutely could not stand the rest of our experience. 
yes, we know big groups you have to add gratuity, i get it. and thankfully that's all we gave our server for the experience.  I've worked in a restaurant and know how things work. 2 things on our bill were never accounted for. So another friend ordered a side of fruit, which we never got. So while splitting up the check i kindly asked if we can get it. first the server suggests she take it off but i said can we just get it instead. the server then suggests do you want it to-go. I agreed thinking i'd get the side of fruit in a small to go cup, and what does she walk back with.... a side of fruit in a regular bowl. so I don't get how she was the one who initiated the food to-go and we didn't even get it.... Then on top of that, while paying the bill equally among cash and credit cards, I wrote down how much should be paid on each card. wrote down amount, last name that belonged to the card, and the last 4 of the card. Pretty simplified, easy to read. One of my friends should have only had no more than $10 charged on her card. instead while preparing to sign it, she's like am i reading this right, $60?  and when i go tell our server, she said her manager was the one who charged the different cards. so you're telling me a manager doesn't know what he's doing????? Just because we're a bunch of young people who like to party cuz it's VEGAS doesn't mean you can try to take advantage of us. 

WOW.

Rude Hostesses, Dimwitted Servers, and Uneducated Managers?

Lani was extremely hospitable and sincere; he always made sure our drinks were filled, made all the right suggestions regarding our orders, he'd constantly checked up on us, and had outstanding customer appreciation. During our meal, Lani brought out samples of a sweet beer for my friends and I to try and I absolutely loved it. I'm not a huge beer drinker, nor do I like sweet drinks, BUT this particular brew was really on point.

I don't eat much so I ordered house salad and the steak kabob appetizer my other friend ordered a hamburger fries and a Ceasar salad and my other friend ordered steak mashed potatoes and a salad as well 

You can't really mess up a salad so those were fine .... While waiting for our main courses the bartender was basically screaming behind us we could barely have our own convo 

Finally course my kabob was fine no complaints my friends hamburger completely not cooked right  but we don't like to complain and we were so hungry he ate is anyways my friends steak was cooked fine but there was more fat then meat smh

Don't get me wrong, I love Gordon Biersch . . . their happy hour is pretty awesome, but my last  visit to this particular establishment sucked !

Pros-
* awesome happy hour menu w/ cheap eats
* good selection of brews (including GB home brews)
* chill atmosphere with outdoor patio area

Cons-
* bad service
* slow service
* would not accommodate our seating request
* No reservations at bar. Not even for large groups!

Tips-
* if you go with a large group of people, make sure to bring cash
* happy hour is limited strictly to the bar area.  Sit at the bar itself for quicker service (not the surrounding tables in the bar area).
* the patio is part of the bar area.  Make sure to take advantage of it. 
* heat lamps are available on those colder Nevada nights.
* Summerlin GBs has way better service (I'm just saying) !

Overall-
I love GBs , but I don't think I'll be returning to this particular location.  The server was horrible and it was evident that she was having a bad day.  She did not smile and was frustrated the whole time because we had a larger party.  We tried to get seating near the bar for those that were under age in our party.  The server explained that it was ""closed"" and that if they wanted to join us, we'd all have to move to the dining area.  She was not helpful at all and did not even make the effort to help us.  The food was good as always and my company was great so I had a good time.  It's a disappointment that the service was subpar.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,2,2,f4lLSIRaTpzSGZIxTUq9mQ

I shared the calamari ($7) and slider combo ($11) with my boyfriend.

I came here for an end of the year feast with my coworkers a few days ago, and we were impressed. The restaurant is big and roomy, the ceiling is high like a cathedral and the giant windows makes the environment look bright and comfortable. The service was exceptional and there was never a moment we had to ask for a refill, even with +15 people.

I had the salmon dish as well as the steak tacos. The steak is so tender it almost tastes like the salmon in terms of texture and consistency. Their garlic fries are amazing. The home-made root beer is excellent, if you're a root beer fan. If you want to try something exciting, I recommend the lobster tacos or the crab cakes. Despite whatever you order, everyone's feedback in the group seemed positive. Whether it was the BBQ hamburger, pasta, tacos or salmon, it was well enjoyed.

I'm not sure if I would go here for sports events simply because there isn't enough TVs. In the corner I was sitting, the closest TV to me was about 6 yards away near the bar.

I think any toddler is familiar with the difference between crackers and bread.

So $10 for some crackers and tiny scoops of hummus, bruschetta and tapenade is steep. But then I realized my friend had ordered the flatbread pizza and was struggling to eat it because CRACKERS can't support the weight of pizza toppings and sauce.

Another guest politely asked the waiter about the crackers and the server said it was a permanent change.

Here's a permanent change: I will be going to one of the other couple hundred gastro pubs in town with great atmosphere. Or hell, just walk across the street to Firefly for actual tasty food!

Service was a little slow that day, but the food we were served was pretty good and definitely worth it for the price we paid.

I was staying nearby and figured it was worth checking out, rather than making the trek towards the strip. I'm glad I put my biases towards macro beer aside, because I actually enjoyed my short visit to this brewery that just so happens to serve food.

The beer here appears to be brewed on site by brewmaster Julio Lanzas. That alone is rare for a restaurant brewery chain. It shows in the final product. They have a few beers that you won't find bottled in your local supermarket.

The Session IPA was surprisingly hoppy and not exactly what most people think of as a sessionable beer at over 5% ABV. Who knew a German brewery could brew such a decent West Coast style beer. No it's not fantastic but for the price and location, there's not much better fresh from the tap.

The IPA was a bit of a miss. It's a bit less balanced than the Session. I didn't taste much hops on this one. It was what I would expect from GB. Especially after trying the smooth hoppy Session immediately before it.   

The Stout was a thick, delicious, slightly stronger version of an Irish Stout. A mix of Imperial and Irish perhaps? 

I was pleasantly surprised with their Belgian Tripel. I'm not normally a fan of the Belgian stuff but this was an incredibly well done take on this style. Kudos to the brewmaster on this one. 

I like how they have several different size glasses to choose from at reasonable price differences. I rolled with the pint size since I wanted to try several different beers during one visit, but you can go all the the way up to 23.some odd ounce glass if you're feelin' randy. 

The service was great. The bald bartender was on top of it with me and all the other customers at the bar. He is definitely an asset to this business.  

Actually after visiting the strip, I appreciate this place that much more. It's not overpriced, the beer is decent, with a variety of styles and great customer service. Other brewpubs could use a lesson from this place.",Y61y11_nYsbc2UWjDh8ZEA,13,11,4,_OJpQWSpePzlOQqdMxJXrw

Lunch - They do not offer a lunch special or half portions during lunch but it is a great place for business lunches. During the lunch hour it is mostly workplace professionals throughout the dinning and bar area. 

Dinner - Full menu offered including drinks. Reservations are not required nor usually needed. They can easily accommodate small and large groups. 

Group & Private Events - I've utilized their private room for two work events now l with group sizes ranging from 15-30. They provide a menu upon booking to order catering style. In the past we've done sliders, bruschetta, salad, pizzas and risotto appetizers bites. The room can be set up with long or round tables to accommodate the room along with linens. The space also has a coat rack for guests and is located near the restrooms. They also have plenty of parking accommodate large groups.

Other than its misuse of real estate, this Gordon Biersch is not bad. The environment is really nice. It's pretty busy, so if you're looking for an all-male business crowd, this is the place. 

The $5 pizzas during happy hour are pretty tasty. The crust is good.

3877131,2012-03-07,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"After living in this area for so long, I finally tried Gordon Biersch. Of course what intrigued me to come was the happy hour menu. My friend and I came around 10 at night on a Wednesday. There was a private party going on at one side of the bar area so it made it seem sort of packed. Other than that I think the amount of people there was the standard small size crowd for a week night. Unlike Yard House, the happy hour here is only for the bar area. So I guess I can't bring my friends who aren't of age yet.  First we received our drinks, I ordered the Marzen beer and she ordered a mojito.  I'm kind of embarrassed to write this, but I am honestly not a beer drinker and it tasted normal to me?  I only drank a few sips and that was it! hahaha.  I feel like I wasted the other 3/4 that was left. Oh well, good thing we bought it at happy hour price. My friend also said her mojito was just ""okay."" After she tasted her drink she wished she had the Dragon fruit strawberry mojito which sounded 10 x better than the boring classic. As for the food, we ordered the Southwest Combo and calamari. I really enjoyed the garlic fires because of the Parmesan cheese and the garlic flavored oil drizzled on top. I also thought the calamari, was pretty standard. However, I am not a fan of the other items that came with the Southwest Combo. The egg rolls was on the verge of having soggy wrapper and the pork sliders were nothing special. We order the mini warm apple bread pudding for dessert. It was delicious especially the contrast of textures and flavors between the bread, caramel, and apple. If you want dessert but don't have enough room for a normal size one, the mini is perfect. I really want to come here again to try other items on the HH menu, but I don't know if it's worth it knowing other places (ie Yard House) have better selection, quality, and prices.

The service was pretty mediocre. Yeah, it was busy since it was St. Patrick's Day and a Saturday night to boot, but I still have reasonable expectations. It seemed like forever for them to bring food out, and my friend's whiskey on the rocks took way longer than the other drinks for no good reason. We also had to ask twice for the vegetarian menu, and this was for the birthday boy no less. Finally, it took them forever for them to bring us our check even though it was clear that we had finished our food. You know, based on them clearing out our empty plates and whatnot.

However, I did enjoy my half-liter (standard size, apparently) of Marzen beer, and the food was pretty decent (but nothing special) overall. My kobe burger was nothing special, so I'd recommend that you pick one of the other burgers instead. The garlic fries were delicious though, the fish portion of the fish and chips was really nice, and the potato chips nacho appetizer that my friends were sharing wasn't bad.

Even so, this would probably be a three-star review if it wasn't for one thing: they had my Sharks game playing on TV. We were playing the Red Wings, and a couple of their fans just so happened to be sitting near our section and had the TV tuned in to the game. Now this happened to be on the NBC Sports Network and wasn't a legit regional broadcast, and it wasn't in HD for whatever reason, but I'm still very happy that I caught the game because we won in overtime and managed to climb back into position for a playoff spot down the stretch.

Sat at the bar for immediate accommodation, found the service hit and miss, sometimes she was ready at the right time and in other cases you'd have to wait for a while with an empty drink (which any bartender would I'm sure rather have topped off for any willing patron).  An appetizer I ordered since I was famished also came so late it might as well have come with the meal itself, which defeated the purpose.  

Amber lager tasted excellent, so I did quality assurance a couple times, for consistency's sake.  They were equal, so they get a pass.

Location is easily spotted and parking was more than plenty for when we visited.

Had a seafood pasta which on paper sounded busy, but worked well enough in reality.  

Debating a 3 star vs. 4 star just because of the service, but the drinks were tasty and the food was fine, so I'll chalk it up to bad luck in this case and not the norm for the place.

Two things which have nothing to do with anything, but are memorable nonetheless.  The full size mirror in the men's room is mounted at an offset downward angle, which after you've had a couple beers messes with your balance.  Thanks for nothing.

Pros: super clean, plenty of tv's to watch March Madness games, decent happy hour prices, convenient location for me. It also does not reek of smoke. I am not a native, so I still hate that I have to tolerate smokey bars after getting used to smoke-banned bars in other states. The bartenders were also very nice and efficient in their duties, even though it was a busy night.

Cons: the bar food was really disappointing. I ordered a crab artichoke dip and it just tasted like warm mayonnaise. It was very bland and needed some spice or tangy cheese and even the crab on top looked like it was sort of watery from a can. My friend ordered a charcuterie plate.

Here's the sad part of this review: I use to love this restaurant brand. I ate at my first one during Spring Training in AZ near the ASU campus. It was a tradition for us all to go there yearly for dinner & drinks and we always had a great time. Then on flights through SFO I would go and grab some of their famous garlic fries. I'm sure my airplane travel neighbors loved that as was we flew to China. Recently we had a team dinner here at the Vegas location and it was anything but good. 

I am not sure what has happen but the food is just terrible. I know they brew the beer fresh but why can't the food be fresh too. I'm not sure how this place is going to survive because there is just too much good food out there to be wasted on this stuff. 

We ordered a ton of apps and they were worse then warmed up Costco samples. The sad part is that we were paying for these & Costco samples are free. If I was the chef that designed this menu, then I would be embarrassed to tell anyone I even worked on it. The visit here left enough of a bad taste in my mouth that I may never ever visit another one of these chains again. 

For my entree I ordered the tuna blue and it was the weirdest piece of tuna I've ever had. The colors were not vibrant at all. It was probably the saddest piece fish I've ever eaten. My friend & fellow Yelper kept saying, ""Your fish doesn't look right!"" I used his famous line on him saying, ""Never order fish in a desert!"" It was the only way I could admit to my ordering mistake. I was just trying to be healthy. Guess what comes with my fish as a side?  Garlic Fries! Because noting says raw fish side more then garlic fries. Not!!! The kitchen couldn't even get them right. There was not a single chunk of garlic on my whole dish of fries. In the past this dish would be so garlicky that you couldn't talk to people for days. Not anymore. They were basically French fries missing any of its past glory. How can a restaurant go backwards on one of their signature dishes? It just doesn't make sense. All I know is that this place doesn't care about its food anymore. The temperature of the food was not hot which meant my dish was sitting while the other 12 dishes in my group were being made. It's not cool to send back a dish when you are trying to eat as a team. 

My buddy Tony M got the beef medallions and he really didn't care for it. Another co-worker across from us cut up her swordfish and didn't even eat it. She said it was really dry. It's sad to have a group meal where the food is pretty much tasteless and inedible. I really wish we would have gone to another place. 

The only app that was halfway good was the Southwest egg roll but honestly anything deep fried is really good. Except for the deep fried crab balls which were really crabby. I don't like eating crab which tastes like the sea. These things were really fishy. In fact, if I threw it into the ocean I am sure a fish would throw it back at me. The fried calamari was also not really good either. There was nothing fresh about it. The rings were really thin and it was more batter then actual fish inside. 

Service was good. Our waitress did a nice job of serving us except she forgot to bring our chicken wings. I didn't get the bill so I'm not sure if we charged for them too. Hopefully another table enjoyed a couple of baskets of wings. I felt bad for one of the guys in our group. He didn't get his food until 10 minutes after we got ours. Which means the chef didn't make it or the waitress forgot to order it.  

If you come here then just stick to the bier. It is the only thing that is made in house. The food is an afterthought and the chefs don't really care. Food needs to be made with love and passion but that is not going to happen here. Stay away from the food.",CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,16,7,2,zVxtu23rhFJWouceFyHMOg

The burger was great as always, but I was somewhat disappointed by the garlic fries, served lukewarm, and the chicken wings had a different, less appealing seasoning. These are two of their signature dishes they shouldn't mess with. The beer was great as always, and the dessert -chocolate budino cake- decent.

Everyone loves the Marzen, it is a perfect beer. I am not a beer fan, but this is the reason why I return to this place. It's August, and they have a tasty Seasonal beer that was perfect. 

The Garlic fries here are popular. I arrived at happy hour and tried the potato chip nachos. I don't think nachos should go on anything other than tortilla chips now because of this experience. It was not bad, but I would have been happier if it were regular nachos. They were generous with the sour cream, but skimpy on cheese, pico de gallo, and it didn't have black olives or jalepenos. I understand every place has their way of presenting a food, but I didn't enjoy this particular dish. Anyway, it was only $5. 

The pizza was Ok too, a personal pan pizza for $5 is a great deal, especially at a place that has nice ambiance. 

I think they are known for their burgers. If I were prepared to have a real meal I would have chosen the sliders, which are pretty tasty. I have had those before. 

My suggestion is to come during happy hour, to get the dollar off beers and $5 appetizers. Their regular menu prices are a little pricey, and if you are not a total fan already or just looking for a decent place to have beer, it can seem a little over priced.

We decided to come here after work to kill some time because we didn't want to drive in the monsoon.  Our waitress was less than enthused to wait on us.  She spent quite a bit of time talking to the table next to us.  It appeared that the one young lady worked there and maybe it was her day off because I saw a cook also come out and chit chat with her.  
Anyways....I asked for water when she had a moment.  That moment was 10 minutes later.  She only had 3 tables so not quite sure why that took so long.  Our food arrives and I promise you it was so much bun and a lil baby patty (I never remember to take a picture until half way thru or at the end after I'm done).  I've never had a burger that small at GB.  I was very disappointed and was even more disappointed with our waitress who came by to see if our food was ok but didn't really give us a chance to comment because it was a drive-by how's everything, meaning she said it as she kept walking.  But then a cutie comes in and sat behind us and she was so chipper and happy go lucky.  I interrupted to ask for another coke because there was enough garlic on my fries to put on 4 other dishes.  12 minutes later I got my coke.  I watched her go in the back, talk to the  someone and talk and talk and then I saw my coke in hand but then she began talking to 2 other employees right in front of the bar.  I was very close to going to take it out of her hands myself because I was so thirsty from all the garlic.  
My friend ordered the cod fish and chips I believe.  She said it was ok.  Not good, not bad.

4574414,2011-09-09,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"one of my most favorite breweries in Vegas.^^

----Time Spent
prolly 30+ visits past 4yrs.

----LAYOUT
spacious open seating built out of an old fire station's hull and complete with garage doors left from the past.   there are godzilla size beer vats at the far side of the entrance...   while not a very original layout, i think you will found it charming nonetheless.^^

----SERVICE
attentive and friendly staff...   the food delivery at the bar seem faster then on the floor.

i LOVE the menu.   although not several pages deep, i've been surprised by everything i've tasted on the menu.^^   F*CK.... where do i start.?!  my mouth starts to water as i think about the selection... LMAO.!!

for those coming to Vegas and want that UNIQUE experience in food...  both the sampler platters (Chef's Sampler/Brewer's Feast) have flavorful surprises.   i do like the rest of the appetizer menu, but the sampler platters are really where you want to start.!

main platter wise...  i've had their salads, but recommend the variety of pizzas (Pepp & Sausage) or fish (Chilean Bass - NOT Lobster Mac & Cheese - meh).   what really stands above the rest is their New York Steak & Shrimp...  very juicy... omg - so juicy.... LOLz.

my only CON with the menu is the Bistro Steak Medallions.   it was the very first thing i had at Gordon Biersch and recalled the portions small and the taste to be forgettable.  *cry*

finally, what's a Brewery without it's beers right.?   Gordon Biersch's beers were MEH to me... LOLz.   however, i NEVER go there without having at least 2 orders of my favorite Marzen.   OMG - the MARZEN is sooo good.^^   that dark drink that leaves my mouth with a smooth somber after taste.  *dies*

----PRICING
i don't recall the menu breaking the bank.   probably slightly more expensive then a trip to Outback Steakhouse.   i tend to eat a lot, so my bill averages $50 vs the $30 that i would spend at Outback...  i dunno if that'll help u gauge.

----CLOSING
if not for my discovery of Hot n Juicy Crawfish or my MOST favorite Ichiza...   Gordon Biersch use to be my favorite regular spot to hit for a place to kickback and relax.   you NEED to really try their sampler plates and the NY Steak at least once during ur Vegas visit.^^ .....

As another reviewer stated, the garlic fries smelled amazing (Although I didn't have any) walking through the restaurant.  We debated on sitting inside or outside and chose outside since the weather was nice.  When we got out there they had the misters running which normally would be a good idea I'm sure since it's the middle of the desert, but it was totally unnecessary tonight.  Of the 8 adult males at our table all 8 were nearly shivering, shirts, table, menus, appetizers, etc were all wet too.  We asked the waitress to see if they could turn it down or off, didn't hear anything back, asked again about 20 minutes later and the response was that she could go ask the manager if we wanted her to but that would mean that she was going to sweat her ass off for 8 hours (Direct quote)...which tells me that she completely blew us off the first time.  So I did notice that our table was up on an elevated part of the patio which places us closer to the misters.  Pretty bad design, it may be worth looking into nozzles with a different flow rate or just capping off every other one on that level of the patio.

Additionally, the restaurant was just not that busy and our food still came out piecemeal, with one in our party waiting an extra 10 minutes for his food, and everything was just slow.

Experience aside, I ordered the seafood stew and it was great.  All sorts of seafood but not an overwhelming fishy flavor.  There was enough but it was balanced and the real unique thing was the fennel.  I've never had fennel in a seafood soup before and it was perfect, I think it offset the fishiness enough to keep it from being one dimensional.",2z7zF1x0yt_vR5aZKVE6GA,0,0,2,OlUpoQzNwLk6-_es68ntrQ

Our recent visit was prompted by a group dinner with co-workers, so we were situated in one of their private dining rooms and a set menu. The group ordered a couple extra appetizers as well.

Bruschetta: Served with toasted crostini. This didn't seem particularly fresh and was so overpowered by garlic. I really do love garlic, but that was basically all you could taste. The crostini was rubbed with garlic and grilled, so they were really nice by itself, but too much with the bruschetta.

Fried Calamari: Served with marinara and spicy lemon remoulade. The calamari was okay; tasty, but not tender and too little squid to batter ratio. Enjoyed the marinara.

Crispy Crab Risotto Fritters: Crab, pancetta and havarti in creamy risotto, served over spicy lemon remoulade. Good fritters and the spicy lemon remoulade worked much better with this appetizer.

Southwest Egg Rolls: Stuffed with pulled chicken, black beans, corn, roasted red peppers, carrots, zucchini and pepper jack cheese. Delicious! Flavorful, crispy exterior, and great dipping sauce.

Classic Caesar Salad: Your usual suspects. Decent salad.

Smoked Chicken and Mushroom Pasta: Chicken, tomato, mushroom, herbs, beer-infused gorgonzola cream sauce, bowtie pasta. Another shrug. The beer-infused gorgonzola cream gets an 'A' for effort.

Steak Frites: 7 oz Cab top sirloin with Gorgonzola Garlic sauce and Legendary Garlic Fries. The steak was delicious and cooked perfectly medium rare. I really liked the gorgonzola garlic sauce! The garlic fries were really awesome this time. (I've had really bad ones in the past)

Triple Chocolate Brownie: Caramel and chocolate sauces. Lacked the moisture and tenderness of a really good brownie, but still good.

Across the board, food is just okay with nothing remotely special. I would say that it was a decent spot for beer and eats, but there are so many new spots in Vegas that serve up great beers and equally amazing food.

My wife got a salad and it was okay, but the greens didn't taste fresh to me. I told my server about the burger which I could barely eat half of because it was so over cooked and he offered free dessert. I kinda just wanted it taken off but I was still hungry so I settled for the triple brownie with ice cream. The dessert looked good, but again, it came out barely warm expect the very middle, I'm pretty sure they microwave it for 30 seconds and bring it out. It was a little bitter for my taste. I prefer a decadent brownie and maybe a little more moist. It was rather dry considering it's price. I got it for free so I can't complain too much, but it was only free because they messed up the burger too. I have never had a bad experience at GB in Az, but this one is not good!!!

After walking in, a host/hostess is asking if you would like a table or sit at the bar. 
If you choose to sit at the bar or around the bar area, you can go ahead and find a seat, or a table around it. 
Our waitress came by immediately, gave us the menu, plus the happy hour menu, and asked if we like to try one of their beers.
I personally don't drink any beer.
I really like this place for their bar food! Especially at Happy Hour. 
I ordered Fish Tacos. They are perfectly prepared. The sauce is very spicy (good if you like spicy food). It's not listed spicy on the menu, so be prepared.
I also ordered pepperoni pizza. They only make personal size pizzas, so everyone can order whatever they like! I love their pizza! Thin crust, baked in a wood-fired oven.

Previously I ordered the California sandwich, it's grilled chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and avocado.
Love, love, love their garlic fries! Lots of fresh garlic on it!
My other favorite is the New York steak sandwich.
Real New York steak on a sub roll.

NY Steak dinner with mashed potato and asparagus. It's a hit and miss! Many times meat is not cooked perfectly. Well, it's not a steakhouse, so I am not going to be outrageous, but for $29 entree, I expect some decent meal.

My BF also tried many different items, too.
Sliders from HH menu very good! Only $5.-
Their sausages were also very tasty.

For dessert I ordered Strawberry Cheesecake, and it was okay, better than I thought.

Service is always great. Waitresses are very attentive, especially when alcoholic beverages were ordered! 

The place is always very loud. Music is always playing on the background. 
Television sets are playing sports with captions on.
Lots of TV-s everywhere! 
Of course the place is always packed, so be prepared.

Our server seemed scared when he saw all of the kiddos in our group..which I found pretty funny. That apparently effected him through out the meal since he was not doing a very good job.
I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with some really yummy garlic fries.
The burger was done proper and was really fresh as far as the toppings went. Those fries were addicting.
We also had a plate of homemade potato chips that are loaded with bacon & cheese..those were even better than the fries. They get 5 stars!

4746154,2011-01-13,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"Gordon Biersch is close to a hotel I use when in Vegas on business.
I've eaten here several times, over a two-year period, and used to like the place. But, my recent experiences have been disappointing.

Things got off to a poor start when we were seated at an unstable table that rocked like a small boat on the high seas.  We were told that was the only available table...but it wasn't.  We insisted on being reseated and another table became magically available after we challenged the ""no other tables"" explanation.  We were re seated, and ordered a couple of their in-house microbrews. The beers were OK but lacked character, perhaps my memories of their beer were incorrect, or perhaps they have a new brewmeister..maybe new recipes? 

I ordered the new york steak and tempura shrimp combo and...well...the tempura shrimp are not like the light flakey  tempura you might find in a Japanese place. Gordon Biersch ""tempura"" seems to be  just battered shrimp, and the batter is little better than what you might find at a fast food place. The steak was more or less an Applebee's quality steak, and the garlic mashers were average at best.  I realize the prices here are less than on the strip...but come on.  You can beat Applebee's for God's sake.

Still, the place is conveniently located, so we went back again, a couple nights after our mediocre experience, hoping for a better outcome.  

Nope.

This time the service was poor and their signature KOBE burger came well done when ordered medium rare. We had to get up and find our waiter to order a replacement.  Even the replacement burger was a disappointment:  A perfectly formed hockey puck of beef (read made in a burger press), a slice of cheese that looked like a Kraft single, a very basic bun, a tiny side of fries and not much else.  We then had to ask twice for some ketchup for the fries. When the best thing you can say about a $14 burger is ""the bun was fresh"" it's not a good value.

Gordon Birsch is not far from the strip. Although it is not very easy to navigate to its spacious parking lot, it'd be well worth the effort, especially for its famous Happy Hours (3-7pm, AND 9pm-Closing!)
- Its Happy Hour menu has a nice selection of tasty dishes, starting at $5), and a variety of German beers, especially their special ""SEASONAL"" beers, are legendary; not to mention its selection of wines and well drinks. 

- This location has an impressive brew kettle tower by the front door (much like that at the BJ, Yard House and the Chicago Brewery). Its square bar is huge and classy, as well as comfortable; there are also many bar tables and booths as well. It even has a corner space for occasional live entertainments on special occasions such tapping a new seasonal beer!

The barkeeps and the serving crew are very efficient and friendly, making customers feel comfortable and welcome.

This place seems to be always busy with happy, repeat customers, and many tourists. It is generally quite crowded and loud - a very typical HH atmosphere in a good bar/restaurant. I enjoy very much my frequent happy hours with local friends here, and having occasional dinners with out of town friends.

By the way, please note that their ""Seasonal Beers"", which are NOT listed on the regular drinks menu, could have an usually high alcohol content, so be sure to ask the barkeep of their alcohol contents, just in case you don't want to be OVERLY happy by surprise!

This location is not like any other location I have visited.  Before i start with the food, let's talk about the horrible service. We waited an hour for our food for a party of 5. The issue wasn't our party size because 3 tables that walked in after just as equal in size received there food before we did. The waitress wouldn't even come over to address the wait time.

We had to ask numerous times for water and soda refills.   I wanted the CBLT with a turkey patty instead of the chicken breast. Apparently this was the hardest dish in the world for the kitchen because that is not what I received. They sent me the regular turkey burger. My colleague ordered the Seafood Cobb and received Shrimp Tacos.  I  had to remove the bottom of my sandwhich bun because it was hard as a rock.

The manager gave a 40% discount after he informed me he didn't even understand my order. Really? How hard is it to switch a chicken breast out for a turkey patty?

I was going to order the Blonde Bock since that is the best that Gordon Biersch has and was told that it was removed from the menu. I was upset so I ordered their Heff. I normally don't like it but at the restaurant it was very good. Must be something that the bottle and shipping does to it. I then ordered the Salmon with Garlic Dill sauce and substituted for more Garlic Fries. 
(YES THEY ARE THAT GOOD) The salmon was about 25.00 and is pricy but it was tender and good flavored. I was going to order another beer but was driving that night and didn't want to get a buzz going. 
I wish that there is one in Sacramento but I would suggest having them even though my total bill came to about 45.00 but that was because of the 18% tip because of being a large party.

5645313,2016-12-06,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"Arrived just in time for happy hour! 

As a first time patron, it took us - a party of 4 - a bit of time to go over their menu. Getting drinks wasn't the problem - we just couldn't make up our mind with appetizers because we didn't want to order ALL OF THEM. 

We ended up with: 

* Beer Infused Mussels: the mussels were great, BUT, dipping the bread in the broth upped this dish! 

* NOLA Yellowfin Tuna: fresh and went great with the bed of sauce beneath it. The veggies and the pita bread were great cleansers. 

* Southwest Eggrolls: These were bigger than the ones I'm used to being served at happy hour on some random place. Wasn't too cheesy and it did well even without the dip. 

* Individual Grass-Fed Beef Slider: Hubbers got one (medium) and was pretty good for the price! 

* GB Wings (Full Order): Very typical buffalo wings. Went pretty well with our drinks, but nothing too special about it. 

* For the life of me, I can't remember the last appetizer we ordered. But 'eh. It was pretty darn good. 

Our server, Birdy (aka Aileen - there's an interesting story to her preferred name, by the way, so ask her about it!) was such a cheerful, patient and funny attendant. 

Being it happy hour, the prices were more than reasonable. 

We all had a wonderful experience! I'd probably make a stop on my next visit!",wiW5i1UnGSR_SEaOg5F2UA,0,0,4,S5K9drxni1pm1AeMm8bGcA

There happy hour has changed quite a bit over the last couple years as has the menu.  Sometimes I do not think they know exactly what kind of restaurant they want to be.  As with most places the prices tend to creep up with each menu change and that has been happening quite often lately.  As far as the food goes we rarely find something on the menu that we do not like as there is a lot to choose from.

The party room we were in had the ac blasting and we all had our coats on while eating despite asking if the ac could be turned down which never was.  The French fries were old and cold and we asked for new ones only to have the ones sent back reheated in a microwave.  So disappointing!  The fish had waaaaay too much breading and had absolutely no flavor.  Their homemade root beer is missing the 'root' part because it tasted horrible and was sent back as well.  I can see why I lived here for 3 years and never went.  I will never go back.  They did have a live band which was cool.

Entrees:  BBQ Ribs - Excellent!!! Served with Garlic fries, another winner.  However, again, nothing you can't find easily elsewhere...

Schnitzel - a disappointment, had no flavor

Beer - ugh!!!  Sadly, I was extremely disappointed.  Ordered the sampler, the Marzen was the best tasting and even then couldn't finish the whole glass.  All others were left behind.  Amstel Light tastes better than all of them, I don't know, maybe I'm spoiled having acquired my taste for beer while living in Belgium.

We sat at the bar, ordered a Hefeweizen, mojito,  veggie personal pizza and the garlic fries. Holy moly! Never had more garlicy fries, ever. I figured this was normal so we just ate and ate. Then we see the couple next to us who surprisingly ordered the same exact things..their fries were no where near as greasy or garlicy.

We ask one of the bartenders which fries are ""right"" and he says those, pointing to the couple's and that ours were beyond garlicy...What happens next? He bring out more fries, eek! Needless to say, we ate 30% of them. They were so much better than our first ones and we can't have them go to waste, right?!

The veggie pizza was great, never had one that the spinach wasn't cooked but we liked it!

The mojito was delicious and so was the large hefeweizen. Mmm!

5893383,2016-12-23,1,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"GB has a solid happy hour featuring a small ($1) daily discount on house drafts ($3 for all house drafts on Tuesdays!), specialty cocktail discounts and food specials. The food menu changes often & the food quality has been on a downward slide lately. They have a huge menu with plenty of apps, entrees and small plates. The flatbread pizza is a menu highlight, and usually there is something worth trying on the seasonal menu. The artichoke/crab dip app and the grilled veggie small salad are among my fave menu items. The beer is the highlight of the menu, & trying a sampler is a great start to the GB experience.

The brewery/restaurant is basically one large open area with a rectangular bar, dining room seating and a large patio as well. The chain's Stein Club members enjoy a slew of goodies and  weekly e-mail deals, as well as a free beer at all seasonal tapping parties. A recent promotion offered a free dessert, app or entree daily during the promo (for the next visit) with Stein Club card swipe. I went the first day and nothing showed up on my receipt. A manager was kind enough to offer me a comp. There always seems to be some issue with their promos, and this makes going there slightly less fun for me.

5902839,2017-03-02,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"Gordon Biersch has some good things about this place, but overall, it's just meh. 

Let start off with the good:

SERVICE: 5/5
The service was amazing. Our server was friendly and attentive, and checked up on us several times during our meal to make sure we had everything.

ATMOSPHERE: 5/5
The place is really nice, well-decorated, and clean. We came here when it opened at 11:00 am, but it quickly filled up with convention goers and business people close to the area. Despite this, I really enjoyed the casual vibe.

FOOD: 3/5
We ordered an artichoke and crab dip for starter. It was waaaayyy too cheesy (and I am not one to shy away from cheese). It was 90% cream cheese and 10% artichoke and crab. It was really disappointing, because we could hardly taste the artichoke and crab. They also didn't give us enough chips/bread, but we didn't want to finish it anyways.

My boyfriend had the Kobe cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. He said it was good, cooked well, but had a salty aftertaste. The sweet potato fries with ranch were yummy though.

I got the house made fish tacos with garlic fries. The tacos were meh. They were edible and okay, but definitely not memorable. The garlic fries were good, but so are the fries at McDonalds. 

PRICING: 2/5
For the starter and two entrees, our meal was about $45. Definitely not worth it. 

OVERALL: 3/5 
Overall, I wouldn't come back unless it was to try the beer. There's a lot more places with the same pricing that offer better food.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,2,1,3,JLa_u-czDa144Ed1K6HMKQ

5918948,2010-08-15,0,OFw59czUoeeosFMKfRawmg,"Just want to qualify my review before I get into it.  1) I don't really drink, so the extensive fine beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages was not a big draw for me. 2) I was there for a coworker's birthday dinner and we had a large group.

I arrived on time at Gordon Biersch, and there was only 1 couple that was there on time waiting for the rest of the group to show. I spoke to the hostesses and they were very friendly.  The restaurant wasn't very crowded at all for a Friday evening at 7pm. And they have already setup the table for our large party.
 
After debating what to order, I opted for the House Special Gorgonzola Bone-In Ribeye Steak. It is an 18 oz steak topped with Gorgonzola butter, served with garlic mashed potatoes and vegetables for $27.95.  When it was served, the steak was definitely huge and cooked to my desired doneness of medium rare. But the flavor of the steak was totally underwhelming, and I question if they even used at least USDA Choice grade steak.  Pretty disappointing, considering that I can grill a mean steak at home or in the culinary school's kitchen.
 
A friend ordered a Vegetarian Pizza.  That looks good and although they were not hungry, they still managed to finished all of it.  Definitely a better sign.
 
Anyway, service was okay.  Our waitress kept coming back to ask if we were ready to order, but since not everyone has arrived we decided to wait and she had to come back several times.  So A+ for the patience in dealing with a large party and the indecision when it comes time to order.  But she lost some points for neglecting to mention that an additional 18% is automatically added to the amount charged when the credit card is swiped.  Even if the amount charged already factored in the mandatory 18% tip.  So had we not caught the billing irregularity, the waitress would have made way more than 18%.  So D- for that.
 
Also the water served didn't taste that good. I am sure they use some sort of water filtration system, but the Las Vegas water still won and what we were served tasted more like common tap water from Lake Mead. A lemon wedge would have helped masked the taste, but none were offered.
 
Overall, I would only give this Gordon Biersch a 2 star rating.  Food was just not that good. I am sure the beer is at least decent and at $5 per glass, that seems like a good price.  But food really was a major let down. The chicken wings were way too sweet. Bone-In Ribeye, which is one of the most expensive menu item, but had a Denny's taste.  

I definitely would not recommend anyone to come here for the food alone.  If you need a place to hang out and get some beer and relax and watch ESPN, I guess you could come here, but there are way more better options around town.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,2,0,2,xCx1DRD9O3Xc6XHLe4aSIw
