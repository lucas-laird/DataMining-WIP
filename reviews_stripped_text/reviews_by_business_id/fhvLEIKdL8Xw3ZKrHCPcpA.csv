When the Canter's sign went up at Tivoli Village I was really excited since I had grown up in LA and went to that Canter's frequently. Ordered the Thanksgiving Dinner and Roast Brisket dinner. I assumed that the orders I received were incorrect as they were not the same as when I had had them from the LA Canter's. The Roast Brisket Dinner comes as a sandwich on rye with only a side salad and mustard. The Thanksgiving Dinner comes as turkey on bread with a mound of fried onions and mashed potatoes and gravy. There is no stuffing or cranberry sauce. After receiving the order and opening it at home the restaurant was contacted and they stated that these were in fact the correct items despite the menu (and previous orders) stating otherwise. If you're expecting LA Canter's quality food, you won't find it here.",lHuQYF26DUB-Nj_UoZnVcg,0,0,1,ozKRFQG82L61PoEf2KYeBQ

The menu was rather limited for a Jewish deli I would expect to see fish platters ( white fish, sturgeon, cod, chubs and such) also the sandwich meats were very limited (no tongue or salami) it is just a corn beef or pastrami sandwich lunch spot nothing like Canter's on fairfax. You get a bigger bang for your buck at the Bagel Caf√© which is to bad becouse I was looking forward to Canter's, also in my opinion they would have been better off locating their restaurant in downtown Summerlin, Tivoli Villiage  is a dead mall.",-9ZxHpVBCi8IVedOvB194g,0,0,3,o8FGevjOjd0jK8NetL_uzQ

Is Canter's Las Vegas a bit pricier than some other local delicatessens? Yes. Were our Reuben Sandwiches considered small in any way? Absolutely not! Were they absolutely delicious?  YES! Was our server too nice or too soft spoken (what the heck kind of a complaint was that anyway)? She was friendly and helpful and kept our soft drinks refilled without us having to ask. What a great ""problem"" to have, right?! Was the restaurant spotless and comfy with a great atmosphere AND great tunes playing? Yes!

The food is always good, great matzo ball soup, sandwiches, etc....  but the service at the Canters Las Vegas is the shits.  The server obviously forgot our order.  It's busy, lots of customers, I understand how this can happen.  Except 3 parties got seated and completed their meals before our order arrived, and when it did arrive, as expected, the food was cold.  We asked that they prepare the dishes again.  It came back within 5 minutes - it was the exact same plate (eggs were slightly broken the first time, same eggs came out again).  So they basically popped the dish in the oven, heated it, and it came out hot this time, but dried out, as expected).  The waiter finally brought out part of our order - wrong order.  Even took down the original order wrong.  

It's an hour and 15 minutes later, the place is almost empty, and WE'RE STILL WAITING.  Don't know yet how this afternoon is going to end.  They just brought out a complimentary plate of pastries for us - for a table with people with diabetes.  

There's no need finishing the review.  I'm going to see if they do the right thing.  If this meal isn't comped, the management staff at Canters Deli ought to be ashamed of themselves.

Update - nope, we were still charged for the meal, but we received a whole 15% discount.  This basically means management docked the waitress from her tip, because we weren't about to tip.

Like, it was so intense to watch her take the order. she also couldn't even answer the questions I had and just responded with ""uhhhh"".  I almost thought she has some sort of a mental problem. Besides that, I ended up giving her the appropriate tip that she deserved. After she looked at it, she rolled her eyes and then completely ignored me.

1. At  $20 per sandwich it's a poor value.  Good deli sandwiches should be in $14-$15 dollar range. Haven't seen anywhere near $20 in LA or San Francisco which are way higher cost of living cities.

2. Person who took my order was not trained well.  Told me my only choice for bread was rye when I tried to order a different bread...at $20 per sandwich????

3. Although menu says Swiss...there was No cheese on the four $20 sandwiches.  Kevin... you owe me 4 slices of Swiss. Potato salad portion was tiny and was not in line with $20 cost.  Kevin don't tell me you need to look into whether a shot glass of potato salad is a appropriate. You KNOW it isn't .

4. They were out of black and white cookies. Had to go elsewhere for dessert.

The extremely slow, unorganized service should have been our first clue of how our meal was going to go. Three different servers stopped by our table to let us know that someone else would take our order. When someone finally did, I ordered a Rueben with their ""famous"" corn beef. Probably one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had. It was dry and obviously had been sitting for a while since the melted cheese was cold and hard, the potato salad was mediocre at best and the pickle that the menu bragged about was missing (not a loss - since when I did get one after asking, it wasn't even completely pickled! What I got was more like an old cucumber dipped in vinegar). The other sandwich at our table was the brisket. Average at best, but came out on the wrong bread. The Mac n cheese that we ordered for my daughter came out of a box, was ridiculously hot and came out a good 10 minuets before the rest of the tables food. The spoon that they brought out for it was enormous! More like a serving spoon, not something that you would give a two year old (or an adult) to eat with.

Their turkey burger lacked flavor but the sweet potato fries that accompanied it were good.  Their roast beef sandwich w/ fries was decent but pretty bland and a little overpriced at $15.95.  Their chicken strips kid's meal was good, 4 meaty strips w/ a ton of crinkle cut fries and a kid size drink for only $5.95.  

We stopped by the deli on our way out to grab some dessert, a black and white cookie along w/ a chocolate cupcake w/ sprinkles.  I took two bites of the cookie and couldn't go any further cause it was stale.  It was free thanks to my yelp check in but I'll have to pass on stale food, even if its free.

It was breakfast time so we ordered our meals. I ordered an omelet with country fried potatoes. Hubby ordered an omelet with fruit. When the food came we noticed the table hadn't been set. We had to ask for silverware and napkins. 

Now the food comes and I put one piece of the country fried potatoes (which looked delicious, browned with onions and sweet peppers) I my mouth. Immediately my tongue started burning. I asked hubby to try it and he said the same thing. 

Called over server and she said "" Do you want fruit instead as she took the plate of potatoes. I asked if I could have another plate of the same potatoes and she replied that they cook the potatoes in advance with CAYENNE Pepper. What??? No wonder my mouth was burning. I got a plate of hash browns instead.

At the end of our meal after we paid I asked to speak to a manager because I couldn't believe they would arbitrarily put so much spice on the potatoes and how disappointing it was. The manager took the plate to the kitchen and instead of coming over to us to tell us anything she chose to tell the server she gave us 10% discount. 

I didn't want a discount. I wanted them to explain to me how and why my mouth was burning.when walking out I passed the manager I spoke with and told her I expected her to give me an explanation but she shrugged me off as she was too busy and had I waited longer she would have come over to talk to me.

You may want to check with who was working on November 5th, because your quality control was not there. The sandwich was small, the bread was not thick cut, seemed squished almost, and the meat was like thick chips of meat that had a greasy coating while the meat itself was dry. The mazto ball soup tasted like nothing, thanks for explaining to me how you make your boiled chicken water, adding no seasoning or salt explains why the soup tastes like nothing.

You definitely didn't sound at all like you cared that we had a bad experience at your restaurant, and effectively said for us not to come back, so, don't worry, if we ever get the inclination to spend $20 on a sandwich we will go elsewhere.",f--ona4DuvVKoKoumX4Tyg,6,3,1,2li2CmxKm5ZJalkNQiR-1A

And I also need to remember give everyone a month or two once they open. But it was a miserable experience. First the waitress we had was probably the worst I've had in my 40 years of existence. We sat down and immediately i ordered a Dr Browns Cream soda and a cup of Matzoh Ball Soup knowing no one else would be getting an app. When the sodas come out I ask the waitress if she put in the Matzoh ball soup she said I didn't order it .    Next my friends ordered 2 quinoa salads and added chicken and my wife ordered a Ruben grilled and the bread well done. I ordered the meat platter to make my own sandwiches. The kids also ordered a hot dog and open face lox.  First thing to come out was the Ruben and it's not grilled we send it back. Next two salads come out and it's ceaser salads no where near what they ordered  and no chicken either so we send those back. The Ruben comes back out and all of the pastrami is fat.  And finally a bowl of Matzoh ball soup comes out but we had to ask for spoons 3x. Which I will say the soup was pretty good. They bring one of the quinoa salads out w a bowl of grilled chicken. Never brought second one out.  45 minutes go by and my meat platter is still not out. Eventually a sandwich w pastrami and brisket comes out just to feed me since I was hungry.  But my platter never came out. The brisket was ok.  Pastrami was all fat. So at this point it has been an hour or slightly more and it's the first time out waitress asked for refills.  At this point I spoke w the manager and let her know how upset I was.  They blamed the computer which I can understand some of it but I pointed out how bad the service was. There was one girl that was amazing that did help out some. I thought they would of probably wiped a lot of that bill off. But they removed my dish which never came anyway and gave us 50% off which is the employee discount.  And brought 4 cheesecakes slices for 6 people???  Cheesecake was good but we had to fight amongst ourselves for it. I wish I would say I won't ever go again but I will try it again later down the road.  Last but not least it's so overpriced because of the name. A pastrami sandwich on rye wo fries cost 19.99. Bagel cafe and Weiss Delis is better service, best cost and significantly better food as of now.  If this keeps up Canters has no chance",cDIr-GpMeIuUHjrqU-0Pkw,2,1,1,5JAohEA_dmGNtV4iZxNwiA

I also had some really decent coffee. They brought almond milk for one of my coffees and for another one they brought milk and cream. I also tried the chocolate coffee cake and was very satisfied!

It appears that they've tweaked the menu and most prices are now fairly reasonable, and a group meal here went well but service still seems to be an issue despite ample staffing.

SANDWICHES: 
For the classic options, expect about $9 for a half, $17 for a full, stacked like Pamela Anderson. I recommend the Rachel, on rye. But I came for the Franklyn (now named ""The Best Damn Egg Sandwich""), with steamed brisket, grilled & raw onions, melted cheese, and an egg, on an Everything bagel, plus a side, originally ~$14 now down to a reasonable $10. Sando was huge, filling, and delicious, with fresh-popped yolk drizzled into the melty cheese and plentiful, tender beef. Couldn't finish the top half of the bagel, or the side of fruit, sandwich was huge, would get again.

NOT SANDWICHES:
Other reviews say that their famous pickles are served free upon seating but that wasn't our experience, ordered a half sour plate and they were solid with a mix of pickles and tomatoes. The surprise hit dish was the house-made chips with pastrami, blue cheese, and honey, for a flavor bomb of crispy-chewy, salty-sweet, shareable and reasonably priced at $8. Most orders come with a side of coleslaw, potato salad, or mac salad- the last one was the best choice. Looking forward to coming back for the latkes. Tempted by their Smoked Fish Planks, but disappointed to see they're served on regular plates and not the classic wooden planks as advertised. 

BAKERY: 
Use your Yelp check in for a free black & white the size of your face! They're huge and comparable to that other deli up the street. Everything in the bakery case is comically huge, like softball-sized cupcakes. Planning to return for their bagel chips, which were bagged on display throughout the dining room. Did not see rainbow cookies on either visit. 

SERVICE:
For our initial group visit, service was friendly but odd. I expected a wait on Sunday morning but they were empty, yet the hostess stand was unmanned and it took a while to be seated. Our server was polite and friendly but somewhat slow and inattentive (didn't offer takeout boxes, did not split bill, didn't check on us after food was served, didn't get water refills, etc).

Their house made pickles clearly need more time- tasted like a plain cucumber. Waiters are so hurried they run away before you can order. They ran out of a lot of things and we were warned to not order bagels as their machine was broken so they were very thin. On the plus side, the matzo ball soup is excellent.

It is never thick sliced in a sandwich. It is never topped with melted Swiss cheese and cole slaw and it is never served on rye bread as thick as Texas toast. It was accompanied by a side order choice of cole slaw, macaroni salad or potato salad. I chose cole slaw and that was simply 'okay'. My friends did not eat their potato salad.

They weren't that busy, lots of seating and it took some time to sit us in one of the many available booths. It then took awhile to get our drink order, then another wait to order.
Our food, latkes, soup and sandwiches actually came fairly promptly. The soup was watery. The sandwiches were boring, while the meat quality of the pastrami was good, the brisket was visibly dry. It was meat and bread on a plate,  no sauces, no sides. It took a good 10/15 minutes to get a a to go order of some pastries.
The service overall was very very slow, extremely slow, except for one young man who was very nice and prompt. He brought us boxes after asking one lady for a box that seemed to have forgotten. And they were not busy..
Then the problems with the bill began. $77 for lunch for 3 adults and one child. We wanted to split it three ways, not an unreasonable request. Instead one card was charged the full amount and it took 20 minutes and three managers to fix it, however they couldn't produce a void receipt. During this time I suggested that with all the problems we call it a day, to which I got blank stares. One lady did come over and ask if we were ok, as we were visibly upset. She listened then walked away.

Staff very inexperienced & didn't know what a LEO was when I ordered it & I won that bet with my friend. Was asked twice what type of bagel I wanted & when the LEO came out no bagel came with it.I  ordered a chocolate egg cream & was asked twice & a vanilla one came out. Wasn't going to complain about that. The one good thing as far as the food was the chopped liver but it didn't come out with the toast & had to ask the server for the toast. The server was very pleasant but we saw lots of people complaining & we can't blame her for no bagel or toast that's an expeditors job in the kitchen to send out want accompanies each dish to make it complete. On the way out I stopped at the hostess stand to lodge my complaints a very nice blonde lady I think Catarina was her name & she took my info but seemed clueless that the sandwich should be served steaming hot. Said the Micros had been down was one excuse for the 40 minute ticket wait times & that they were taking all the feedback & trying to iron things out. I told my friend we should not go until they were open a couple of weeks but he insisted in going on day 3. In my professional opinion they had no business being open yet & not having it together. I know they are good in LA & this was a big disappointment. I'm a Summerlin resident & was looking forward to being a regular but won't be back for at least another month.

1872628,2017-12-22,2,fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA,"Look, I am not a Yelp Elite reviewer (although I probably should be) and I don't work for a magazine putting claims out there that a restaurant that just opened the doors it the new hot place in town and potentially lining my own pocket. Driving by Canters on the west side of town and looking in you would clearly see this is not the case. The restaurant is always quiet during dinner time and even lunch. Rarely do I see a lot of people in there, and we go by that location and area often because we frequent other locations in that area and outdoor mall...

After leaving my first review, I had received a reply from the owner of the location, as you can see telling me about the quality of the meats, the cuts, this and that, blablabla...then i received a PM a week or 2 later inviting me to come down and go over my ideas of the place, free meal on the house. So i have been thinking about it, and decided actually to go there again without letting them know I was going in, when i had the time or was in the area and just see how it is going since my last review and many more negative and positive reviews.

So anyway, went back there and thought about it and right before i went in this time I picked up the phone and called Canters in LA (located on Fairfax and Beverly-ish) and I asked the guy that answered the phone if the Canters in Las Vegas was the same as the one there in LA and his reply...NO, WE ARE NOT RELATED TO THE CANTERS IN LAS VEGAS THEY ARE JUST A FRANCHISE... nothing more. In fact this guy has gotten plenty of these calls also, so I was not the only one asking about this. Just a Proof of concept to see if a franchise would work out. The guy also told me they support them with the food or concept and that is it, nothing more than a franchise. More than likely a idea or agreement to see if it would work doing a franchise like Pinks did, or some of the other LA hot spots have tried...

After hearing it was a franchise, that was pretty much that, i just kept on driving.

I really don't get it. why do you insist on telling people you're the same as the one in LA, same owners, same this and that when your renting the name? Look, not all franchises make it, not all franchisees know what they are doing. It happens. Just stop making these fluff up stories that LV Canters is the same as LA canters because it's not. It is just the name.

When a McDonald's opens up on a corner, it more than likely is not the same as the one 2 miles away. Nor are 2 subway's a like. Point is again, just because you rent the name Canters does not mean you are Canters.

So, just to clarify I will NOT be going back there for my free meal or even to spend some money to buy a sandwich. A little individualism goes a long way with me, especially when it comes to being a restaurant owner. Do it under your own umbrella, don't drag Canters' name through the dirt to try and win some of their LA customers that visit or relocated here.

And since I can't reply to ""business owners"" comments on my posts, please don't bother replying to this update/post. Doing so with a copy and pasted msg is just making you guys look foolish. Hell, you're even replying the same message on reviews that have nothing to do with your reply. Not professional, not classy.

I've been here a few times now and each time it gets better. I went to this place when it first opened and it was a bit chaotic and I was not impressed with the price but the pastrami was excellent. Hot dog for the kids was over cooked and they ran out of corn beef. It was a brand new restaurant and I was expecting some hiccups. Not a big deal.

The second time we came (2weeks later because the pastrami was so good) they had a new menu with more options and the price dropped a little and I got a higher stack of pastrami. Food was flawless this time. So they were quickly adjusting to the make customers happy. This was a very quick turn around!

I recently saw they have only a 3 star average and I don't think this is very fair. Most of the people are complaining about hot dogs....who come to Canter's for a hot dog? I get it if the kids want it. My older kid shares a Rachel with her mom. Also I've always had great servers. 

Best part, they now have a punch card! Buy 4 sandwiches and get the 5th free!!!!  Best punch card value in town!!!
The server remembered us from our previous visit and was nice enough to give us credit for our previous visits.

(I noted below someone suggesting Canter's isn't up to NYC standards; I've taste-tested Katz' & the 2nd Av Deli -- neither matches Canter's [while the Carnegie Deli went out of business in 2016 after being found to have been stealing utilities from their neighbors].)",52UlgP4xB66tCUO0vE0AJw,0,0,5,5w7l08JIRbmWrLl2PFitAQ

The youngsters at the counter in the afternoon were personable too.  Aside from the cheerful crew, Canter's pastrami is unique and unlike others.  It tastes like someone yanked it out of the oven and slapped it directly on my sandwich....as opposed to the typical shaved pastrami you get elsewhere that was probably packaged weeks ago.  I will gladly pay a few extra bucks for something that tastes superior.  Not a fan of cream-filled eclairs, but their apple crisp squares are excellent.  All in all, some real nice-tasting chow here.

We ordered a pastrami and Swiss on rye ($18+), a side house salad with raspberry vinaigrette dressing ($4) and an extra kosher pickle ($3.50). 
I'm giving three stars for several reasons:
1. What we received was a full house salad (charged $11) with Italian dressing. 
- Italian dressing tasted off. Something wasn't right. Salad was pretty plain for $11 charge which we only wanted a small side salad. 
2. No extra pickle that we ordered. 
3. Pastrami sandwich with a kosher pickle
- As many other reviews have stated, this sandwich is not worth $18+. The pastrami was hand carved and very tender, but 1/2 pound of pastrami for $18 is way overpriced. Kosher pickle that came with the sandwich was Amazing! I don't know how Canters makes their pickles, but I could eat these all day. 
4. Forgot the side potato salad that came with the sandwich 
- The potato salad tasted store bought. I won't go as far to say it was the grossest potato salad I've ever eaten... but I could only manage one bite. I would expect better, much better from a Jewish Deli. 
5. Our server left my credit card in her chip machine and forgot to return it. When I asked for my card, she said ""oh my gosh, I keep leaving these cards in there!""

The hosts were very nice and I was seated within 10 minutes of walking in, which is fine since they were really busy. But, then it took over 20 minutes for someone to finally come to our table and get us waters. Which I learned is because the managers never communicated to their staff what tables they're in charge of. The waitress that helped us was very nice and I could tell she was trying her best. I actually felt bad for her, because she has to work in this establishment. 

It took an hour to get out food and the food that was brought to us was completely wrong. After waiting 15 minutes for a manager to come to our table my friend and I decided to leave. As we got up to leave we over heard a MANAGER TELLING AN EMPLOYEE TO SHUT UP, and as he was YELLING this, he had his hand OVER HER FACE!! This reaction was caused simply by the waitress trying to inform him she was taking her lunch.

2322788,2018-01-01,0,fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA,"Set prominently in the new Tivoli Village addition on Rampart Avenue in the center of Summerlin, Canter's is my favorite place for Jewish deli food in all of Las Vegas. To me, this is a satellite location of Canter's on Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, although it technically is a franchise. It certainly rivals its namesake in these major areas: service, decor and innovative dishes. I admit I will always love the crankiness of the food servers at the original Canter's, but now that I am an active senior, I appreciate the friendly, young waitstaff, who go out of their way to make their customers satisfied, even if we know deli food is quite foreign to them! This eatery, I would guess, is a quarter of the size of the one in L.A., but it has a much more pleasant atmosphere. Of course it has the requisite, comfortable booths, but also has a nice assortment of tables, if you are so inclined. And you don't have to choose to either walk up to the second floor or squeeze into the tiny bathroom next to the Kibbitz Room as you have to do in L.A. My favorite decorations are the murals that are exact copies of the ones painted on the south wall of the building on Fairfax Ave. In addition, there are other memories of previous locations. Besides the mural of the Brooklyn Avenue deli, there's a nice write up of the history of Canter's on the menu. (I thought I  knew a lot about Canter's, but that the Canter brothers' first location was in New Jersey was a new fact for my collection of trivia.) Ah, the food. So what if it's not exactly the same? It's delicious. Personally I prefer corned beef to pastrami (and if I still lived in Southern California, I'd be occasionally venturing into the Latino community that surrounds Langer's for its amazing pastrami, the best reason to make that trip.) I ordered the corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup, which unlike its L.A. counterpart actually contains pieces of carrots, onions and celery. The bowl is twice the size I'm used to, filled with delicious broth and two nice-sized matzo balls. In addition to the amply stuffed sandwiches, you must try the Las Vegas Canter's homemade potato chips that are topped with melt-in-your-mouth perfect pastrami chunks, bleu cheese crumbles and topped with honey. Yes! It works! And don't forget to take home an assortment of yummy danish, tempting macaroons and hamentashen! Trust me, Canter's is a Vegas must-go restaurant.

I read some of the issues people had with pricing and service in other reviews, but i am a fan of deli food so i decided to give it a try anyway, big mistake. $18 for a sandwich with no sides is unacceptable (you get a thimble full of bland potato or Mac salad. One spoonful. Doesn't count). I'm more than willing to pay that much, being from Chicago and growing up eating Jewish deli sandwiches the size of my torso for that price, but Center's Las Vegas' is barely bigger than a sandwich at Arby's. Beyond that, the employees i dealt with dining in were distracted, unavailable and short. Management was nowhere to be seen and every employee seemed to be lost and/or not doing their job besides maybe one young lady at the register (seemed to be the ""to-go"" section. I should have just had it to-go in retrospect. If i was going to throw my money away, i didn't also need to deal with listless, uncaring employees while right within my view the purple-haired take out girl looked to be doing a bang up job).

We were very excited to have a Jewish deli open up in Summerlin. We all had the chicken soup with a matzoh ball. We asked for noodles and they had said they ran out, but we got the soup anyways. The chicken was super dry and tasteless. The carrots and celery were hard like they had just added them to the soup. Matzoh ball soup is a staple in a Jewish deli. They should be making a ton of it and have extra on hand including extra noodles made just in case. Both of my kids had the Mac and cheese with they seemed to like. I had a bit and seemed to be Kraft Mac and cheese..nothing special. We also ordered a piece of the 7 layer cake. It's from freed bakery and wasn't worth the price or the calories.

At the end of the Linc walkway, and fairly new, I thought I should try it out since I'm a lover of good Reubens!  This was anything but good.  First,  it took forever to get waited on, then an eternity for the food to arrive and when it did it wasn't and didn't look appetizing.  The cheese was cold and just sitting on top, it was small (for the price).  I sent it back to have it prepared properly, all they did was flip it over and nuke it.   These guys need to take lessons from the deli at New York, New York and the Mirage.  Now those are sandwiches with style and flavor.  In addition, I ordered the coleslaw. I could have eaten a wedge of cabbage and it would have tasted better.  Much better.  That definitely wasn't coleslaw!

There is a serious lacking of good delis in Las Vegas. I lived in Los Angeles for my last 30+ years, so I am qualified to know what a legit deli is when I tell you that Canter's is not one of them. We walked in tonight and were seated right away. The restaurant was completely dead with just four other people here besides us. I ordered 1/2 a pastrami reuben with matzo ball soup. The soup was practically flavorless and had no chicken in it; I think it was a vegetable broth instead of chicken? Bizarre. Although their menu lists a ""soup of the day"" our waitress informed us they've never had one. How nice. The sandwich was definitely on the small side compared to what I would expect from a $18 sandwich elsewhere. While the sandwich tasted fine, it was certainly nothing special and would be a sorry excuse for a good deli sandwich in LA or NYC.

The service was definitely lacking and this is kind of shocking since we were basically the only people dining here. Our drinks sat empty for more than half the time we spent there. Before we were done eating, the waitress offers us dessert and when we declined she immediately brings the check and comes back in 60 seconds to see if we'd paid her yet. When she recognized we hadn't, she drops it back on the table at which point we were invisible for the next 30 minutes. Just because you're in a hurry to get us out of there doesn't mean service ends. I don't know how long Canter's has on their lease, but given my experience doesn't seem to be isolated and the place being a ghost town, I can't expect this to last very long.",8dOqtvJubv4nUcl04XFU1w,4,1,2,aoem6ojsCR147HYp-ZcqUg

Today I bought essentially the same order at the Bagel Cafe and paid nearly fifteen dollars less for a far superior product. Canter's sells this weird, very un-deli like, thick cut dry corned beef for twenty nine dollars per pound. Today I got a pound of excellent thin sliced, familiar, 100% deli corned beef for eighteen dollars and change. Canter's pickles were soft and soggy, Bagel Caf√©'s were crisp and fresh. Canter's cole slaw smelled and tasted bad - bad enough to go right into the trash. Bagel Caf√© slaw was fresh and tangy. 

The Canter's order cost fifty two dollars and change, vs. Bagel Caf√© at thirty eight dollars. Both times I've been in Canter's thy have been virtually devoid of customers while there's always a wait at Bagel caf√©, never a good sign. In fact, the day I was OVER-CHARGED BY A MILE the employees literally had nothing to do until I gave my order. I have NEVER seen a deli like this. The corned beef was wrapped loosely in just a piece of paper that had spilled in the bag on the drive home, and I could have made jelly out of the terrible pickles. I don't usually leave negative reviews but I was hugely disappointed with Canter's and people need to know, based on an honest review. When I heard they were coming to Vegas I was really looking forward to it based on my positive experiences at their Los Angeles location.

Food was a little pricey for off the strip Las Vegas, but amazing. I am a native New Yorker and have eaten in all of the big delis from Katz's to Carnegie to 2nd Ave Deli. The food here is just as good as any of them. We wanted to try a bunch of stuff so I ordered a hot dog with sauerkraut and spicy mustard and knish while my wife had the matzo ball soup and pastrami sandwich. The hot dog bun was slightly toasted, while the hot dog was crisp and delicious. The knish was slightly crispy on the outside yet warm and soft inside with that great knish flavor. The pastrami was excellent, Just enough fat to keep the great taste but not overly fat and greasy. My only criticism would be the broth of the soup. While the matzo ball and veggies in the soup were both excellent the broth was slightly bland and  there was no actual chicken in the soup. We also got 2 mini black and white cookies for desert just for checking in on Yelp that were also very tasty

Lastly I can't speak for all the serving staff but our waitress Romeo, yes a female Romeo, was awesome. Attentive but not overbearing, with a little sass thrown in for fun. Perfect for good NY deli food.

I exchanged it for matzah ball soup and it appeared that they brought the same bowl back with a matzah ball in it.  My son ordered the prime rib sandwich.  It wasn't freshly sliced prime rib as we expected (especially for $14.50).  It appeared to have been boiled in water all day.

My son ordered a piece of chocolate cake and we also ordered one to go.  The cake was delicious.  However, when we got the bill we were overcharged.  When we asked the server, he brought back the menu and kept pointing at the chocolate cheesecake price.

My thought was that after all this nonsense - it would have been a nice gesture if she had comped the cake....but no, we paid full price for everything.  $48.65 (including tip) for a horrible dinner.  When I think of the hours it takes to earn $48.65, it makes me mad that I wasted it at Canter's.  Horrible experience and no reason to ever go back again.

Folks, we're talking unbelievably bad. 

Like many, I'm a fan of ""real"" Canter's - the one on Fairfax. 

Ate here, at ""fake Canter's"" with my parents last night. 

In no particular order, here are the ways this abomination trashed the hallowed legacy of ""real"" Canter's in L.A.

(1) Upon ordering, we were told they were out of rye bread. At a Jewish deli. (What?!)

(2) We made the server check, he said they would make more rye bread but it would be a 15 minute wait. 

(3) The rye certainly wasn't worth the wait. A pale, disappointing, soggy kind of yuck. 

(4) I would venture a guess that the ""pickle"" served saw 45 seconds of brine. FAIL.

(5) Joke of a menu. NOT what you would expect with the Canter's name on it. What sort of Jewish deli has no tongue?

(6) With the ""abridged"" menu, you'd expect there would be less to learn. My sandwich featured badly burnt pastrami. Upon mentioning to our server, was told, ""that's what pastrami is supposed to look like.""

(Wrong!) 

I am not sure how a legendary deli allowed their name to be dragged through a sewer like this, but I'd sooner buy Carl Buddig for 99 cents and drape it over Wonder bread with fake mustard than eat here at ""Canter's.""",Bk6zmpCCFlFGeVXKYmkH2A,11,2,1,2xya0DdioF8kz9rzabmznw

I was craving a bowl of chicken soup and felt so lucky that Canter's had just opened near me. I called to place an order to go and was informed that I needed to go in person to place such an order. So even though I was under the weather I ventured over only to discover that they didn't have any chicken soup. Couldn't the lady on the phone have told me that? 
I looked for something else on the menu that appealed to me that they had available (limited menu apparently) and I selected a chopped salad with chicken for $12.95. The menu listed ingredients including chicken even though under the listing it said ""added chicken $14.95"". I asked the cashier for the chicken on my salad and she informed me that I didn't need to pay the extra $2.00 unless I wanted an extra helping of chicken. I said ""Thanks, but a standard portion would be fine""
I paid for it and waited a pretty long time until it was ready. As I was waiting I was asked by the numerous help staff if I needed anything. I said that I was just waiting for my order and one of the ladies went to the kitchen to expedite the process. I got my bag, went home, opened it and Surprise! No chicken. Not only was there not any chicken on my ""salad"" but it consisted of a soggy premixed variety of lettuces and very few other vegetables or goodies added to it. I don't normally do this but I called to complain about my  experience. The staff graciously offered me my money back and asked me for my receipt number. I gave it to them last week and I still do not see a refund posted to my credit card. I don't think I will be back until they get the kinks worked out. I hope that will be soon.


I am very pleased to say that I have returned to Canter's on 2 separate ocrecently and had much improved experiences.   The corned beef and pastrami sandwiches were very good.  The only drawback was with the bread that I do not feel is dense enough or the crust hard enough to qualify as an excellent sandwich. The wait staff was excellent and really aim to please giving my sister an opportunity to taste the chopped liver from a small sample size ramekin.  I still have not tried the chicken soup but I understand that it is on the menu now. I will definitely be back.

3030187,2017-10-06,1,fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA,"I wish there were separate stars for service and food because I'm caught between five stars for the food and two stars for the service.

First the food: two friends and I had lunch there yesterday. I ordered a cup of chicken soup with a matzoh ball on the side, and The Rachel which is a pastrami sandwich with Swiss cheese and coleslaw on rye bread. Both the soup, which was thick with vegetables and chicken, ( The restaurant does not serve noodles with chicken soup... What?)  the  matzoh ball and the pastrami sandwich were nothing short of excellent. Very fresh bread, and delicious roasted pastrami piled high.
My friend had a Franklyn  sandwich, which is a beef brisket on a French roll. He wasn't particularly happy with it but that was a matter of taste.
His wife had three cheese blintzes, which  she said were very good,  however there was no sauce served with it so she sent it back for sauce and they unrolled  the blintzes and put the sauce inside. Very strange but she did like it. 

OK let's talk about service: it was obvious from the beginning that the two women that waited on us had never done this before. They were completely confused with simple instructions and the order was pretty messed up.  Don's sandwich came with french fries, So the fries were brought out to the table a full 10 minutes before his sandwich. My soup and sandwich came out together, but I asked that half of the sandwich be put in a takeout container with the bread on the side of the sandwich so as not to become soggy on the way home. Half of my sandwich was served with pickles (absolutely delicious pickles) on a plate, The other half of the sandwich was also served on a plate. Did they want me to take the plate home with me? I had to explain for the third time that I wanted the pastrami separate from the bread in a takeout container. It took two other people to get it right.  My friends blintzes never showed up and we waited several minutes before asking what happened to the blintzes. Apparently they were never put on the order check even though she clearly ordered them.
Twice they were told separate checks, one for the couple, and one for me. The check came out with all of the food on one bill.  
This place has been open almost 2 weeks and by now they should know what they're doing but they were totally confused by simple instructions as I said.
This can be rectified, they just need more training.  The kitchen needs to know how to put an order together and that too can be rectified.
But I will repeat just so it's understood, the pastrami sandwich, the pickles, the potato salad that comes with it, the outstanding chicken soup, the french fries and the blintzes are over-the-top excellent.

I smell amazing pastrami as I walk in!  I'm in love with their all day breakfast here.  This reminds me of a restaurant called Cozy Grill in Warwick, Rhode Island.  I went with French Toast and bacon with a water.  Boyfriend had latkes with apple sauce.  Also Bagel with cream cheese and chive.  His cup of coffee was large compared to other places, I was impressed with how good it smelled black reminds of a medium roast straight from the east coast.  This place screams east coast Jewish place, the industrial lighting and tile on the pillars adds a nice touch.  The deli is even nicer with the white marble looking quartz I assume. 

My new favorite place considering it's so quiet and intimate.  All the conversation is so soft you can hear a pin drop.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,1,0,5,mmY-yx-7bYY9q1_Ma5AAqw

I've had better sauerkraut from a can. The Russian dressing was good. I tasted the pastrami from my mom's sandwich and there was absolutely no flavor. Our bill came to a whopping $50 for lunch for two, at a deli!! Our server, Chris was very nice and accommodating.

Both soups were delicious with the chicken soup having an abundance of chicken. The sandwiches were served on fresh rye bread and the meats were moist and tasty.

Our server (I forgot his name, and I usually don't) was very courteous, and explained many things about them menu, as were were first time customers.  To start, we ordered an Everything Bagel with cream cheese; he came back shortly after and told us they were out of Everythings, so I ordered a Garlic. It was toasted like I had asked, and had and a lot of cream cheese with it. He also brought an assortment of pickles, of which I loved, but my hubs didn't care for most--his loss! Our entrees were a type of BLT with fries, and I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs and toast.  Our server was kind enough to let me sub Potato Latkes (with sour cream and applesauce, of course!) for a small upcharge of $2.00 instead of having to order them ala carte for $8.95. The female food runner brought out our food, but didn't have my toast nor the Potato Latkes; I asked about them and she returned with them a few minutes later, but without the sour cream or applesauce. I asked about those, and she went back to get them. I dislike runners delivering the food because they never know what you ordered, even if they read the ticket, which clearly this young lady did NOT.  Or at least it seems most never pay attention to the ticket, as inevitably most runners always forget something.  Our server came back and asked about everything, and I asked for the sour cream and applesauce, but did tell him a runner went to get it.  He came back with it quickly.  The runner then returned with it as well, in addition to another Garlic bagel.  The runner was a very young female (possibly a very light skinned African American, with black rimmed glasses--the only reason I describe her is she wasn't wearing a name tag), and apparently doesn't pay attention to detail, and seemed like she didn't care about her job very much.  She had a very tired look about her (as if she'd been out too late the night before). Her attitude about being there was VERY nonchalant, and seemed like she could have cared less about what she did, right or wrong, let alone making sure folks had their CORRECT orders with all the accompaniments the first time.  Our server, during the brief two times he re-visited the table after taking our order until we asked for the check, was very courteous and attentive, but seemed to have too many tables assigned to him.  My hubs enjoyed his sandwich very much.  My breakfast was very good as well.  The hash was pretty thin on the corned beef, however, being mostly potatoes and green onions as filler.  Eggs, toast, and latkes were all excellent. Saw others' sammys as I walked to the restroom, and the meats were piled high on the Rueben and Pastrami I saw, and looked delish.

The manager solucited our feedback. We advised her the latkes were greasy and not very crisp. The matzo ball soup was ABSOLUTELY tasteless! The reuben was dry and I wouldn't have recognized it as such if I hadn't ordered one. I requested extra sauce after an initial taste but I guess our waitress was too busy. I flagged another who promptly delivered. The Dr. Browns diet cream soda was delicious...but $3.50? Our 3rd diner ordered a pastrami which she enjoyed. She also liked the cole slaw. The pickels were good, too (but I don't think as good as Clausen!).

Overall, i won't be back for a $30 lunch ($17.95 for half an overstuffed but very dry sandwich and cup of tasteless soup, 1/3 of the $10 potato latke and $3.50 Dr. Browns) served by a ""very busy"" waitress.",wybW_CtlmnS79tCxwtrSTg,0,0,2,ohiLex_Y2_BFkv2zqFhkdg

I don't normally like visiting restaurants during opening weeks because there are a lot of kinks to work out and it's really not fair to criticize new places until they've moved pass the opening. I will say this though the pastrami was as good as the L.A. location and the recipe is on point. Same goes for the coleslaw, taste like back home. 
On the other hand the Potato salad was not familiar and definitely needs to follow the L.A recipe, not sure what's going on there. Same goes for the Matzo ball soup. The soup wasn't bad, but just didn't seem to follow the Canters formula. I know certain things are hard to replicate away from the Fairfax location, but these seem to be easy fixes.

Food: The pickles were about the best part of the dinner.  My waitress gave extra that made me happy. Drinks came quickly.  We both ordered soup and 1/2 sandwich. I got Turkey that was completely dried out. Mom got corned beef again that was very dry. The matza ball soup or should I say Matza ball and vegetables. The Matza ball was so big it was good i don't think there was any soup in the bowl. But plenty of vegetables and shreded chicken but i didn't order a bowls of Matza ball and vegetables and shreded chicken.  
For dessert mom wanted a piece of chocolate cake to go. $8.00 and we were told it was chocolate but when we got home it had a ring of white and powdered sugar and coconut. No one mentioned coconut.

The Bakery; what Bakery enough said.

However given that the restaurant hasn't even been open 1 entire week I'm going go give them another shot in a few weeks. Here's how my Saturday lunch went at CANTERS...

ATMOSPHERE:
The interior of Canters is very nice and clean, great tile work, nice floors, and nice tables. First thing you see when you walk in is the deli, the sweets and the delicious meats being carved right when you walk in make you feel you made the right decision going here. Very casual and family friendly environment. I love that they have USB ports and outlets at the deli counter. I'm impressed with the layout.

FOOD:
Beware if you go for corned beef, they might not have any, I'm still perplexed to how they ran out of corned beef at noon, but so I was told. 
To start I the matzo ball soup which was tasty, not bland, and the veggies were fresh, the matzo was also seasoned well. I also got some onion rings which were supposed to come with my sandwich but since it wasn't ready my waitress felt bad and brought them to me as an app. LOL
Last but not least I had the brisket sandwich, it was okay, nothing special but not terrible. And after that I remembered, what about my damn coleslaw? After I reminded my waitress voila...my coleslaw came, that was actually good!  Before I left I stopped at the bakery area to grab somethin sweet (I'm just glutton for punishment) it took way to long for us to get TWO pastries, I thought I ordered another sandwich. Do get the almond croissant DO NOT get the cream puff croissant, it's filled with that fake buttercream.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
This is where things start getting choppy. As soon as we walked into Canters we were greeted, and placed on the waiting list to be seated. The wait wasn't bad, considering how busy they were we waited around 10 mins.
Normally once your seated at a restaurant its smooth sailing from there, it took us over 20 mins just to get water, another 10 to get our actual drinks, and it took close to an HOUR to get our order... throughout this I had to remind our waitress for our sides. There was definitely a gap in communication to say the least. Honestly I truly couldn't enjoy my food because of the wait times, I was shocked that they were so unorganized. 

Hopefully things get settled at Canters because I definitely want to go back, perhaps next time I'll order to go as the dining experience left me frustrated.",xX1wftld9-ndtISAAihqng,10,3,3,ZelB14A0z6ynpoQWmRiXqg

He was fantastic other than that no kasha vashingas and no rainbow cookies. Extremely small bakery. Very very overpriced. The bagel cafe down the street is much better.

I recommend ordering the sandwich side by side instead of mixed so you can enjoy the different flavors of the meats.  The soup was amazing, hot and delicious.  The matzo ball was firm and the bagel chips that came with it soaked up the broth in seconds.  The meats were lean and sliced thick but not too thick.

When a woman rang up my order, she left off the sandwich and had to ring me up a second time. I checked in on yelp and was supposed to get the black and whites. She yelled in the back to bring black and whites. The order took about 15 mins to get, and I was handed two bags to go. When I got home, the black and whites were not in my bag. I would say the nature of verbal exchanges with any of the staff members were never hospitable or friendly, just a monotone, unexcitable conversation.

Kitchen was backed up and the server was too busy to take our order, so the runner attempted to take our order but didn't know the answer to any menu questions we had.

So my wife and I redirected and thought we'd try a variety of things. Here's how it turned out.

The chili dog was meh! The bun was hard and crusty with bland chili flavor. 

The meatloaf looked and tasted more like Alpo than meat. The gravy was bland. The mash potatoes were the only bright spot on that plate.

 The latkes were very greasy and unseasoned. 

The matza balls were good but they came in vegetable broth. You had to order the chicken broth if you don't want it that way??

We did order it that way but they still sent the wrong broth. But that did give us a chance to try both broths. The vegetable broth was better than the chicken and the vegetable broth tasted like it came from a grocery store box. 

Then we tried the carrot cake and cheese cake. The carrot cake was decent but the cheese cake tasted more like cheese cake pudding that Jello would sell. I'd be embarrassed to serve that to anyone.

It's a real bummer to have to give such a bad review as we were hoping to have another good restaurant in Summerlin. This didn't do it at all. They barely even phoned it in. Just living off the name. The one bright spot was our server was great!

At other similar restaurants (Stage Deli, Carnegie Deli) you get sliced pastrami piled HIGH.  This was thick cut pastrami and not very much.  It tasted fine but for the price I paid I expected a larger sandwich.  At an average diner you can get the same sized sandwich for about $8 - $10.

I was originally going to order breakfast, but breakfast prices were also high.  Thought I'd get more bang from my buck with a sandwich.  I was wrong. 

I guess I had higher expectations since they were touting themselves as a real Deli. This was a big disappointment. I probably won't be going back.  Maybe the rent at Tivoli is high and they need to charge more.  But my guess, like other restaurants that have been at Tivoli, Canter's is not going to remain in business long.

3886196,2017-10-12,0,fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA,"So I purchased a meal at Canters on 9/29. The menu reads  pastrami sandwich lightly toasted mustard and cheese with a pickle ... $18.95. Management at canters had offered a 10% for employees at Tivoli so when i go to pay my total for my meal and a drink was $26.47. I advised them I work at Tivoli and they said sorry those discounts are not being placed at the time. I said it was fine and moved on. When i get to my workplace to sit and eat i looked at my receipt and noticed the charged me $2.50 for the pickle. I unwrap my sandwich and its just a cold piece of bread meat no cheese no mustard. I was very disappointed given the amount i was charged and over charged (pickle). I called management and was asked to walk there again to discuss the matter. When i get there management took about 5 minuted to see me. Then when i told them I had called and explained the situation they said they had no idea who i was or what i was talking about. Manager (Julia) said to give her a second walked away for about 10 to 15 minutes came back and said she was sorry but wanted to take care of this for me and took my number and said she was reimbursing my meal. She promised a follow up call. It is now Thursday 10/5 NO reimbursement in my account AND no phone call. This place is horrible. Extremely disappointed and as of today when our office is asked what places to recommend i will NOT recommend this place. Over priced doesn't deliver and doesn't refund customers as promised. 

Here is an update... after I placed the above review, this story get much more upsetting. I called Thursday 10/5 spoke to the ""GM"" Katrina and told her the situation she insisted she needed the receipt... I told her I didn't have it because Julia kept it. All I wanted was to get my money back for the horrible service and troubling time. She took all my information down promised to talk to Julia because she might have kept it in her ""purse or something"" (why would it be in her purse) At this point, im truly upset but u take her word and believe she will call me back as promised once she talks to Julia who comes in at 3. I heard all the excuses but I figure shes the GM she will handle it accordingly.

Monday 10/9 5:18 im upset no call back as of yet no refund or anything. I ask to speak to a manager again... I get Joann. I explained to her the situation... again I get the same BS and ear full about being new getting it together sorry but she says and I quote "" I am a woman of my word I am writing all this down as we speak and I an getting my GM involved and she will get this taken care of for you."" So i ask ""are you talking about the same GM who I talked to last Thursday who as of yet has not returned my call""... she says ""No, since then we have a new GM"" I said ""so you are telling me the GM i talked to has been replaced since then"" she said she was making sure this was handled and promised a call back the next business day even if it took her coming in on her day off (Tuesday, next day) 

Today is Wednesday 10/11 I called again since no one called me ... as promised again... Katrina answered the phone (wait per Joann she was let go) she said she knew who i was and what i was calling about... she said at this point there is nothing they could do since it had been more than 24 hours since the incident. So I told her its been more than 24 hours because Every Single ""Manager"" has dropped the ball. I promised a refund the day of and no one did as promised. How is this my fault how is this my problem. I am baffled. She requested my information again and I told her for what I gave that to all over you several times. She raised her voice and said "" are you going to give me the information or not"" i gave it to her but at this point in escalating the issue. 

Customers, please understand this is not about $27.00. This is about the principle. This is about this company over charged me for something that was included in the meal, is that stealing?  Lastly this is about poor poor poor customer service and over charged meals. I beg anyone to think twice before stepping foot in here. I am disappointed and honestly feel taken advantage of.

For the price, $26 for a bowl of matzo ball soup and sandwich, everything should have been excellent.  There are many other NY delis in Vegas. Most are better quality and less expensive.

I asked for it sunny side up like the menu photo.  I also ordered breakfast potatoes which is one of their choices to accompany the sandwich.

When it came, there was a steak knife with it, and that was a good idea.  I broke the yolk, let a bit drizzle on the sandwich, and then pressed the top of the bagel into the the egg.  

You get about two bites of the bagel as a sandwich and then I'd recommend you finish it open face style.  That's when the steak knife came in handy.  There was ample brisket and the sandwich was a good breakfast sandwich, something I generally would not order.

The potatoes could have been hotter.  They had red and green peppers and onions.

I did not eat real food here it was really just wine and some cheesecake, but I was happy with them both. For the $7.00 a glass that I paid for the white wine it was well worth it.

Let's face it folks, you can't duplicate the original atmosphere of any place that's transplanted weather it be from New York, New Orleans, San Francisco, or Los Angeles. But I do have to say these folks do a very good job of at least duplicating the quality of food served in their original location.

I was disappointed in the Du Par's in Las Vegas, and feel it lacks the quality of the Los Angeles parent, but I am not disappointed in the quality of food at Canter's. 

We have been there twice now, and agree the Corn Beef is very good and lean, and the Pastrami may be the best in town. This is very good deli food, and though not as ""homie"" as Begal Cafe, I think they are a lot less cocky and try to put out a good product. 

If price is an issue for you, don't bother going here. This town is full of low quality food bargains, and I'm sure you will find something that suits your taste for a bargain. 

However, if you are from New York, Chicago,  Los Angeles, or any place that you remember good corn beef and pastrami, this is certainly worth spending the money for a treat you will enjoy.

They were OUT of Corned beef, and had to settle for pastrami.. thick cut (which my wife hated) she also did'nt care for the taste.

We both had the Matzo ball soup (way too many veggies in the broth) I had them bring to me without the garden (this the authentic way to prepare Matzo ball soup), should only consist of the Broth with a few carrots, celery, a dib of onion and the Matzo Balls. It SHOULD'NT have chunks of chicken in it too.
The Matzo balls themselves were ok..still packed with some unknown herbs. But passable.
The broth itself was amazing..clearly made from scratch..

Not sure how these people got the legal right to use the ""Canter's"" name, but what a total insult to the original Canter's in Los Angeles.

This restaurant does not begin to compare to Canter's on Fairfax, the Bagel Cafe on Buffalo or Carnegie Deli on the Strip.  

The extremely overpriced food is nothing better than average.  The pastrami is thick-cut and chewy, nothing like what traditional delis serve.  Check out the size of the sandwiches at Carnegie and Bagel Cafe.  
The pickles are a joke.  Most of the sides were probably bought in bulk from Costco.

The overly forward and overly tattooed server almost ruined my appetite, as every other word he used was ""awesome"".  Who needs this?

We won't be back.  This wanna-be a Deli will close soon because they won't be able to extract enough money from so few customers to survive.

I can't wait to read the defensive, long-winded diatribe Dinah, the marketing manager, writes.  I'm sure it will include the tired 7% crap, along with the weight claims and comparisons.  Notice Dinah never defends their outrageous prices - an impossible task.  Dinah belongs in a Diner, not a Deli.",wXR0Bis9TnbJR1ijE49sfw,2,0,2,g497mcRxqVSYn3lFm3VwnA

Was there a flood on dark chocolate cake and pastrami knish orders and ran out of supplies?! C'mon! This is a ""seasoned"" well known deli along with Carnegie and Katz.. that doesn't make sense.

I asked for the salad plate and the server had to look over my shoulder at the menu to see what was on it. The hubs ordered half a pastrami sandwich and soup. Everything we ordered was fabulous, so clearly food is not their problem. When my plate arrived I noticed it did not have a pickle on it as stated by the menu. I asked and the server became somewhat flustered. She said she'd get me one right away. That didn't happen so I just took one off the hubs' plate. She was extra confused when she finally returned and saw me eating a pickle. I said it was fine and I didn't need the plate FULL of pickles she was holding. She took them away, brought them back, took them away again, and finally put them down and walked away. 

When the check came I noticed the charge for the half sandwich and soup was $28.50. No way. I called her back over and she fixed it. It got weirder waiting in line for a black and white cookie to go, but at least the cookie was delicious. All in all we will go back, but not for a while.

After much delay, Canter's opened at Tivoli Village in Las Vegas (Summerlin).
At dinner time on a Wednesday, a surprisingly small amount of people were dining, but my waiter told me they do very well at lunch.
I ordered a small serving of Chicken Noodle Matzoball Soup. A filling portion with a matzohball as good as my mother's. The soup could have been slightly less salty and there were no ""as advertised"" noodles to which the manager was very concerned. It was very good non the less.
The sandwich was ordered was half pastrami, half corned beef. Both very good, as was the rye bread, no complaints. My side choice of potato salad was very good.the sampling of chopped liver was very good, though tasted too ""oniony"".¬†
My waiter was very attentive and management was very concerned how my food tasted and open to suggestions.

However this location was absolutely horrible!
The pastrami sandwich arrived ice cold,bread toasted  (not soft and warm) and the meat was not only cold it was thick sliced and flavorless.
The Cole slaw which we look forward to heaping on our sandwiches was also flavorless and was so disappointing. 

We were also disappointed to see the bakery counter was 1 case and half empty,with another bakery case completely empty no assortment of our favorite cookies and pastries to purchase and take home :( 

We were sat,across from the cash register and were annoyed that the lady took our order from the register never coming to our table. When I told her I had a question about the menu she looked up and expected me to explain across the aisle...I just gave up and ordered my usual pastrami sandwich....ugh so dissatisfied with making the effort on my Vegas holiday to drive all the way out to this location for what easily was below average for a bad buffet on the strip.

Do Not Make the Effort, because this location makes no effort to replicate the true spirit and flavors of the Orginal Canters Deli.

5094852,2017-11-04,24,fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA,"KISS.  You come here to have a classic hot pastrami or corned beef sandwich PERIOD.  Burgers, hotdogs, fries, chili, salads, blah blah blah, go somewhere else.

For the big boys of Jewish delis, the guys with serious history who have survived decades and served generations,  pastrami is their cornerstone.  We're talking Katz's (NYC reigns supreme), Langer's and Canter's.

This one, at Canter's, deeply seasoned with a spicy rub, slow cooked, so moist and tender it quivers when the slab hits the board for slicing.  A heaping pile, about 1/2lb, on slices of fresh baked rye.  A smear of pungent deli mustard if you choose.  A side of zesty, creamy potato salad and a couple of crisp, flash brined pickles.  That's it.  Something with less spice impact, replace the pastrami with an equally good, beautifully brined, it's flavor penetrating all the way through, equally juicy corned beef.   

IMPORTANT TIPS:

1.  Don't deviate from the NYC sensibility.  We on the West Coast love choices but seriously, when they opened in 1933 and through the decades, there was no such thing as pastrami on multigrain gluten free mumbojumbo add tomato and cheese.  PASTRAMI ON RYE.

2.  Sandwiches cost $16 - $18 each.  Accept it.  It will set you back as much in NYC or LA.  It's reality. 

Service is a little slow as they still try to get their footing.  It will improve with practice.

Simply put, the best pastrami and corned beef sandwiches in Vegas.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,40,31,4,QzIw2qU4TetaqRq2Ja0Eng

5279259,2017-10-14,7,fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA,"Open on Fairfax since 1931 Canter's Deli was serving Los Angeles before Las Vegas' population cracked 10,000 and although a previous attempt to expand into Sin City at Treasure Island in 2003 apparently did not go so well a recent re-launch at Tivoli Village in Summerlin sees the new space from Celebrity Brands Restaurants making a lot of good choices, though there is a lot of room for improvement as well.

Long considered to be Los Angeles 'other' place for Pastrami, Langer's house-made version considered by most to be superior to that of Canter's which is still brought in from New York, it was with one other that lunch was enjoyed on Friday inside the restaurant officially opened on September 28th and having already adjusted prices due to myriad complaints early-on about being ""More expensive than Los Angeles"" and even ""Strip Priced"" the new menu reads very much like a truncated version of the original with prices not so different from The Bagel Caf√© just a few miles away.

Still doing some marketing by way of its Los Angeles legend, stories of the fourth-generation owned and operated Original told by both signage and a wait-staff that is universally pleasant and welcoming, though still quite green, it was immediately on entering that every guest was greeted with a big smile and ""Welcome to Canters,"" the seating spacious and laid out over the left side of the Restaurant while the right features a Take Out counter plus cases of Desserts, Bagels and Salads.

Mostly filled just prior to noon and completely packed by 12:30, the average diner sporting white or grey hair though several 30-something suits were seen in the midst, it was by a middle-age woman with great manners that the table beneath a continuously blowing vent was served, the offer of Doctor Brown's Soda declined in favor of Iced Tea and Water and several Jewish Deli classics selected in addition to ""The Franklyn"" which appears to have been created specifically for the Las Vegas market.

Serve housemade Pickles prior to the meal, both Cucumbers and Green Tomatoes showing well and working nicely to refresh the palate between plates, it was after the first of two mis-deliveries from a younger waitress that all four plates arrived with a big smile and complete description, the Latkes suggested on the menu to be served as a duo in fact offered as three crisp and hot Pancakes with almost no residual Oil while the split-Knish stacked with Pastrami was a best-of-both-worlds way to experience each item without filling up, the beef appropriately fatty with a modest amount of seasoning while the mixture of Mashed Potatoes and Onions was creamy and comforting without being too dense.

Chatting while eating, the continuous blow of cold air admittedly uncomfortable after a while and not something that was able to be addressed during the course a nearly ninety minute visit, it was after enjoying the lightly sweetened rolled Pancake that the fork and knife Sandwich was approached, the toasted Bagel providing a good chew around steamed Brisket, Cheese, a soft Egg and two styles of Onions served next to Sweet Potato Fries that can be subbed for housemade Coleslaw, Steakhouse Spuds or Potato Salad.

Making both the Bagels and several styles of Cakes and Cheesecakes in-house, the Muffins and several styles of Cookies outsourced to locally-owned Freed's, it was focusing on Canter's own creations that four desserts were ordered, the $8 slices of Cheesecake a bit spendy but absolutely on-point in terms of taste as well as their velvety texture while the $5 Carrot Cake and $2 Black & White Cookie were both generously portioned, the latter not quite as fluffy as Weiss Deli but using far better frosting while the Carrot Cake was moist and dense with a lot of chopped Nuts and plenty of tangy Cream Cheese Icing.

***1/2 Thus far making a big error at launch in terms of pricing and still not up-to-speed with service it will be interesting to see how Canter's at Tivoli Village evolves with time, the property already notorious for shuttering several restaurants not really a place where starting off on a bad foot seems well advised but the food, at least what was tasted, so far good enough that it can hopefully keep the place afloat as they work the kinks out.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,15,7,4,_5yImFAaxAKu-6SoZqjJww

We arrived at Canter's before 4:00 on Friday & were prepared to cut some slack since they had been open just a few days.  It was busy, but still plenty of seating, & we chose a booth.  There were many servers available & the wait wasn't long.  At first glance at the menu I realized why it wasn't yet online... the prices are exhorbitant.  In fact, they're ridiculous on every item, be it B/L/D.  

I chose a bowl of matzo ball soup ($9) and my partner chose the Brooklyn sandwich (consisting of brisket, onion, cheese & an egg atop a bagel) with choice of 2 kinds of fries or coleslaw for $13.95.  The food took a half hour to arrive & we had to ask for more water.  The soup was not  as rich in broth as I'm used to & was quite filled with large hunks of potato which I'd not had on that soup before.  Otherwise it was good enough.  He liked his sandwich, though meat was scant & fries were greasy.

Canter's appears to be ""the place to be seen"" & for those with a bigger wallet than average.  Yes, I preferred other items on that menu, & my partner would have chosen a pastrami or corned beef, but the prices were way off compared to two other fine Jewish delis in town.",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,3,0,3,P1HQaTfLhmM3Qv2lFfXRSA

5397258,2018-05-04,3,fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA,"Wife and I stopped in here on a Thursday afternoon around 2:30PM, and the place was empty.  We were seated immediately and our server was prompt.  

My wife ordered the ""Rachael"" (turkey sandwich) and potato salad. She said her sandwich was really good, but the potato salad tasted worse than something out of an old grocery store's refrigerated section; very blah and little to no taste, even after adding salt and pepper. 

I ordered the Kevin sandwich (pastrami with coleslaw and russian dressing on it) with fries as my side. I bite into my first French fry and it's COLD, not warm, not even on the warm side, just plain cold.  

I inform the server, ask her to touch them, and yes, cold to the touch.  She takes them back and immediately returns with my sandwich stating ""they are making fresh fries now and it'll be a few minutes"". While I wait for my fries, I begin to eat my sandwich, which is good, however,  there is no russian dressing on it. 

Potato salad sucks, fries are cold, and my sandwich is missing the dressing; we're done with this place. I tell the server to cancel the fries.

As we are finishing eating a pudgy man with a shirt a couple sizes to small ""trolls"" by our table and asks if everything is OK?  I tell him about the fries and he states ""ya, I know, I comp them"", then states they are making fresh ones and begins to walk away. 

So he already knows things are not OK, because he took the fries off our bill, so why wouldn't he, as the manager, not approach the table in a ""managerial way"", and directly address the situation, versus trolling by like he doesn't really care and is just going through the motions like he does past every table.  
 
The man never identifies himself, but we presume he is the manager. 
I informed him that I no longer want the fries, and further let him know that in a town like Las Vegas with thousands of good restaurants you cannot afford to serve substandard or mediocre food. He gets a little attitude then waddles off.  

A few minutes later he returns with a small container of goodies (cookies, etc.) and states that he will be ""insulted"" if we don't take them.

While we truly appreciate his effort and gesture to make things right, we truly want nothing more to do with this place, keep your cookies. The damage is done.  It's a Thursday afternoon, the place is empty, and they are having issues with the food being cold, not prepared correctly, etc., I would hate to come here when they are busy!     

Again, the manger states that he will be ""insulted"" if we don't take his small goodwill gesture, WTF.  He should have thought about that before he insulted me by serving me cold fries, a sandwich without one of it's main ingredients, and my wife's food with little to no taste.    

Bottom line - the manager's knowledge, appearance, people skills, and lack of leadership is definitely a direct reflection of this mediocre at best deli. Chef/kitchen manager should be terminated for allowing food to leave the kitchen as there was/is absolutely no, zero, natta reason for it; just poor leadership all around.

Someone in our party ordered the meatloaf which came with gravy as well as potatoes and it was OK. The cheesecake with strawberry was good. We ordered a strawberry shortcake as well because they were out of rice pudding and the strawberry shortcake is from Freed's bakery, so it was very good. Would I come here again? Not really sure...

When it finally arrived her chopped liver was on rye.  Spoke to the waiter and sent it back.  Waiter blamed the kitchen I lay partial blame on the waiter who did not write down the order at the table.  After a couple of minutes he came back and now it was on untoasted white bread.  It's called chopped liver toast.  Toasting is on the name.
I pointed this out to him as well and again he blamed the kitchen.  Hey buddy how about checking your order before you deli we it especially since you had to refire it.
Didn't change this out as the wife said it was fine.
Finally we get to the food.  The Reuben was good pastrami was tender. The cole slaw however was dry and tasteless.  Switched it out for potato salad which wasn't much better.  The chopped liver was good but nothing special.
The waiter tries to make it right by offering some free dessert which was appreciated.  But then he proceeded to top of my unsweetened iced tea.witb some fruity tropical ice tea that I hate.
I had enough...check time.  Only reason I left what for me is a mediocre tip was because he put in some effort even though I partially blame him for the screw ups.

We went with much anticipation as former New Yorkers (I realize it's an L.A. brand, but the Canter bros. were originally from Jersey City) hoping for a solid deli more convenient to us than our stand-by, Bagel Cafe. 

Matzo ball soup was good although we had four cups on the table, and some had bits of chicken & vegetables while others were just broth.  Good matzo ball and broth, though, so at its core, it was fine.  

Turkey Reuben ran a bit dry, which is a danger when ordering turkey, for sure, so no foul there.  Cheese was not quite melted with the sandwich, though.  It's as if the cheese was melted separately then placed on the sandwich, but cooled a bit in transfer, so it essentially sat on top of the turkey.  We had two of those on the table, and they were prepared the same way, so points for consistency, I suppose.  Sidebar:  Potato latke was crisp but a little bland, and cole slaw notably lacked character as well.

Staff was welcoming, though our server kept pushing Russian dressing and kept questioning our requests:  ""Are you sure you want more drink?""  ""Are you sure you want to order that?  It's a big plate!""  

Kicker for me was when I ordered a brisket sandwich and he brought me pastrami.  I pointed it out, he immediately agreed, and he took it back, but quickly returned with it saying they had changed the recipe, and it was brisket.  ""Since 1931"" and they just changed the recipe?!  Either way, it was pastrami, and if I let myself think about it too long, a Las Vegan trying to pass-off pastrami as brisket to a New Yorker is enough to make me upset... but I digress.  For some reason, he did not want to take it back to the kitchen.  Fortunately, I'm easy, and they are known for their pastrami, so I was fine with eating the PASTRAMI sandwich.

Four of us recently came to Canter's for dinner.  We ordered the potato knish.  When it was finally delivered to the table it resembled the frozen knishes you could find at Smith's Supermarket-not a real knish.  What was worse, it had been cooked (or fried) so long that it was as hard as a rock and we had to send it back.  We ordered a brisket sandwich.  One of the things that sets brisket apart is that it is juicy and moist and cooked slowly for a long time.  The brisket we received was so dried out that it was almost inedible.  We ordered a corned beef sandwich.  Corn been, regular or lean, should also be juicy and moist.  The corned beef we received was so dry it stuck to your tongue. We received the sandwiches 40 minutes after we ordered them.  The restaurant was almost empty at the time so a delay was unacceptable.  We never received pickles or the cole slaw which should come with the sandwiches.  We asked for a manager to explain the situation with the hope that positive criticism would help the place.  No one was around who we could talk with.  We left almost all of the food, paid, and went some place else for dinner.

Next, the matzoh ball soup had no taste but salt. I make chicken soup from chicken, water, carrots, celery, parsley, and a touch of onion, this just tasted like water, even the carrots and celery in the soup were flavorless! The third strike was the corned beef, which was not Jewish deli corned beef but was heavily flavored with clove! Who puts cloves in deli corned beef? Cloves in corned beef are New England boil fare, not deli! The corned beef was sliced too thick and with the grain, so it was tough and nearly unchewable! I am told the countermen are former Katz deli workers but, I have had corned beef at Katz's, Carnegie deli, Corky & Lenny's, Slyman's, Stage deli, Vienna, other ""big"" delis, and homemade by my bubbie, and I have never had tough, thick corned beef like they served at Canter's. Again, cloves, really? Finally, I don't mind paying for quality, but this was NOT quality. I must warn everyone, Canter's chopped liver is beef liver. Also, their menu is so very limited, you would think they could master those few options!

I'll never go back to Canter's. It was the worst dining experience I have ever had in Las Vegas. I can't imagine anyone who knows delis will be pleased or satisfied with a meal at Canter's!

I have to add, I see the managers answering the bad reviews here and repeatedly saying their corned beef has 7% fat. I call b.s. on that 7% fat statement. My cousin's corned beef had so much fat, she put it in a container to take home to her dog, and that container was full!
I would also say that it doesn't matter how high the quality of the ingredients are if they are mishandled and served poorly!  

Be warned, Canter's is not a ""real"" Jewish deli!",vl3xdjqA_0o_-ZG_mmqrqw,1,0,1,4btQlsieyjwDpdxIg6lvbw

5794612,2017-10-31,0,fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA,"Terrible experience and here is why. I drove 40 minutes to be disappointed. I called at 6 and was told by the hostess they are open until 10.  No it's 9.  I called in my order.  Corned beef and pastrami. The sandwich comes with potato macaroni or cole slaw as a side. I thought it was another side and the cole slaw came automatically with this special sandwich.  Well it doesn't. I was VERY specific I wanted cole slaw. When I arrived the dark haired lady with the lovely accent said to the young man behind the counter to check the order twice three times and four times.
So I drive all the way home and I get to sit down to a tiny and I mean tiny corn beef and pastrami with some type of jalape√±o or spicy creme cheese. The pickles are not sour st all. How do you serve a sandwich like this without a sour, not half sour pickle. They also have the audacity to sell dr Browns sodas for 3.50.  Pretty much a greasy tiny sandwich and rubbery knish for 26 dollars. 

-----------

Just ate the sandwich. Could not tell where the meats started and stopped. It all tasted the same. There was no graininess to the corn beef nor any bark to the pastrami. It was all just a greasy and creamy ( fat texture ) mess. Maybe would have been a better flavor if I got the cole slaw and not creme cheese.",FRxGcIRukrH5lW2SQSxstg,3,0,1,cYkagQ4bDwAwrJei0hHpGw
5811274,2017-12-29,1,fhvLEIKdL8Xw3ZKrHCPcpA,"I've never felt the need to post a negative review about anything on Yelp, much less a restaurant, but after having been to Canter's in Tivoli Village on three separate occasions, I must finally say something.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! I would have given zero stars if I could.  Seriously, it's been a nightmare each and every time I've been there.  I work in Tivoli village and waiting with anticipation for the opening on this ""restaurant"" for months before it opened. 

Knowing what I know now, however, they would have been better off delaying their opening (beyond the amount they already delayed it) until such time as they could get their sh%t together.  This place is full of frantic, disengaged, unknowledgeable, and overall hard to deal with employees, managers, you name it, from the top down.  After my most recent trip (I keep wanting to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that next time will be different) I finally said something to the manager, Elizabeth.  I told her about issues I had had on all three of my trips there, including the most recent one in which despite placing my order online, getting an email confirmation and estimated ""pick up"" time for my food, they seemed to have no idea about my order and literally took about 20 minutes to basically start from scratch (this was on top of the 20-25 minutes I had already waited to show up based on the time given in the email confirmation of my order.  

At no point during my conversation with manager Elizabeth did she apologize, ask what she could do to fix things, or otherwise show much (ie any) real concern about things.  I can't fathom how anyone running a restaurant (much less a restaurant in service-oriented Las Vegas) doesn't understand the basics of keeping customers happy.  It's textbook stuff that she either doesn't know or doesn't implement, either way it's unacceptable. Her response was instead to give me a laundry list of reasons why things were the way they are at Canter's.  Everything from being too busy, understaffed, etc.  THOSE ARE THE RESTAURANT'S PROBLEMS, no mine.  You'd be wise not to make your problems those of your customers, customers that by the looks of things, are vanishing at an ever-growing rate.  

It's a shame this place is so disorganized, poorly run, and overpriced, because I truly wanted them to do well and give folks who work and visit Tivoli one more dining option.  Unfortunately, this place reeks of yet another restaurant that will close its doors in the not so distant future.  I sure hope the corporate folks at Canter's in Southern California realize the damage being done to their brand here in Las Vegas.  I won't be going back and I cannot in good conscience suggest this to my family, friends, or colleagues.  

Stay away from this place, you'll save yourself countless headaches.",QokIEBX7ST9AY5mn2JWvfA,2,0,1,Rj9RpHTDPPIgcd6ermGiGQ

The girl at the take out counter was very friendly and nice welcoming us..after that everything went down hill.. 
We were seated... we sat there for at least 10 to 15 minute before anyone even greeted  us.. the single gentlemen that was seated after us... was already served, he already had a beverage and his soup.. Finally the bus person asked us for beverages.. and we continue to sit there.. I watched the single gentleman across from us he already had his food by the time the server came by.. 
I also observed a booth, it look like a group manger having a meeting in the corner..while this was going on..
Finally the server came to take our order and were then told they were out of Corn Beef for a Ruben.. REALLY....This Is Lunch Time 12:00 noon..
I had to then look over the menu again.. I ordered 1/2  Beef Brisket Ruben.. with a Soup that took forever.. That was the driest Sandwich I have ever had.. The sever was really nice and offered something else.. I just settle eating my soup..I could get a better sandwich at Subway for a cheaper price and not have waited a hour to eat.. 
To top it off our experience the Computer system went down and had to wait to get a bill.. we waited again for the system to come back up..then we were told that they could only take cash that the credit card system was down
What would happen if I did not have cash!!!!
The only good thing the Manager, that was sitting in the booth happened to stop by our table and we explained our situation.. very nice.. He took some stuff off our check..it took 2 hour for lunch and all I had was soup and onion rings..
I will definitely not be returning anytime soon..",xfFbRSH1T609k_aR_D99FQ,1,1,1,8RysOhPpXhoW3jepaUVnyQ
