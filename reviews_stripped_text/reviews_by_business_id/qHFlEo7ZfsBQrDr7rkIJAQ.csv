The first thing I wonder is why it has two names, Mamacitas and Mamitas...maybe it's a Mexican and Cuban way of saying ""little mama""? Anyway, I ordered the Cuban sandwich and asked for platanos verdes instead of the fries. They accommodated my request without extra charge. The Cuban sandwich was delicious!  The plantanos came with a sauteed onion mixture that had lemon juice and garlic, just like my Cuban mother in-law used to make. Everything was very tasty and filling. I want to go back again to try the Cuban tamale and other dishes. BTW, the atmosphere is charming!",3ys-KNMUsMK_3hoE6-tCrg,1,1,4,QnKrliuRQjwoBJ5XBrDlsQ

They took our party of 12 without complaint or reservations (we started out with 5 of us then other friends joined us last minute) arriving around 5:30pm on a Sunday. We were brought LOTS of yummy salsa/chips and our drinks right away. The food service may have been a little slow because there was only 2 waitresses but the fun 70's/80's videos and the March Madness bball games on another big flat screen TV made it such an entertaining wait. The waitress even grabbed my boyfriend to go dance under the disco lights! Everyone enjoyed their food and the price was right on. The birthday girl got a free dessert and the employees sang happy birthday to her. The only reason for 4 star is the bathroom wasn't the best.

We stood at the door waiting to be seated.  For fifteen minutes.  ""No big deal,"" we thought.   We've never been here before, maybe you just seat yourself, and after all, they were really busy.  So we sat down at the only table that wasn't occupied and didn't have food at it.  That table was a filthy mess.  ""No big deal,"" we thought ""they're busy and they'll surely clean it off when they come to wait on us.""

So we sat and waited.

And waited.

And waited.

And waited.

Throughout this time, I was trying to make eyecontact with the wait staff to get them to come over and at least give us menus.

Nothing.   We were invisible.

Another twenty minutes later a couple of hipsters walked in.  A waitress immediately sat them down  and gave them menus.   I stood up, and looked at the waitress in disbelief.   Finally, she brought us menus and chips and salsa.

Didn't bother to clean the filthy table.  

And then we sat and waited.

And waited.

And waited.

And ate some chips and salsa (which was actually really good).

And waited.

And waited.

We then got up and began to walk out.  Waitresses all around saw this and just didn't care.   There was a group of 8 laughing as we left.   They had been there for quite some time and were taking bets on how long we would last before we gave up and left.

I am glad that someone got something out of our time.

I noticed that the table behind us had half eaten chips and was abandoned as well.   Looks like we weren't the only ones.

These guys are really busy.  They really don't care how long you wait.  It's also no big deal to them if you just get up and leave.   They cater to tourists so they probably don't need to worry about reputation (they should with me, I'm local).   They'll treat tonights crowd like crap and it won't matter because in 3 days there will be a fresh set of tourists in town.

Anyway, I've always said the best restaurants in Vegas aren't on the Strip they are several miles west of the Strip and downtown.   This place is frustrating and no good.  Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.",5283cNL5nCc1cqvgiR6liA,0,0,1,KoIaHH0Pogj72RxPsyznUQ

Yeah - they were recently shut down for Health Department violations, but seriously is there any better time to eat at place than right after getting their license reinstated?  At least you know it's now up to snuff! Besides, we're pretty fearless eaters...so onward!

The menu was surprisingly HUGE!  Cuban and Mexican and American dishes - oh my!  After looking it over for a few minutes, I initially felt that the prices were a little high.  It was the first hot day of the year at lunchtime and I wasn't in the mood for completely stuffing myself silly, so I ordered the Tostada with Camarones a la carte.  When it arrived, it was a nicely prepared fresh tostada consisting of a crispy corn tortilla topped with a MOUND of good sized shrimp with chopped onions and cilantro.  It was served with a slice of lemon, but I think I would have preferred lime.  The waitress offered a bottle of Tapatio which spiced it up nicely.

My husband companion got the chicken fajita tacos with rice and beans.  Definitely NOT what you're thinking.  The ""tacos"" were really 10"" flour tortillas stuffed with a mixture of primarily spiced chicken with some onions and bell peppers tossed in.  The ratio of chicken to veggies was great, not mostly veggies like some local restaurants.  Chicken seemed of good quality as well.  

Service was a little, um, ""relaxed"", but so were we so we didn't find it annoying.  We chatted with the waitress (whom I assume is either one of the owners or someone who has worked there a long time) and she said they've been there for 14 years.

Nobody seems to know exactly what the name is, including the restaurant itself, so I will post this review under Mamita's, which is what the sign says outside.
Overall, the food is decent and very well-priced. Chips and salsa are really important to me at a family-style Mexican joint like this, and Mamita's c&s were really good. They have both Mexican & Cuban food, but my party of 4 stuck to the Mexican side, so I can't comment on the Cuban. Taquitos, 'mexican-style' tacos (that means onions, cilantro, meat on soft tortillas vs 'american-style' which have cheese, lettuce, and meat in a deep-fried tortilla), and quesadillas were all good.

The chief complaints regarding this place seem to concern the cleanliness and the service/attitude.So let me address both.

Apparently, the place was closed down by the health dept. recently for having 52 health code violations (!). I might not have dared to eat here had I known this...but as it was, I have been here twice and had the chicken fajita tacos both times: once Mexican, and once Cuban-style. Both times they were way above average! The veggies were fresh and ginormous and delicious, the chicken was well spiced and succulent, and the accoutrements (rice, beans, etc) were average. 

On both my visits, my friends had the chimichanga. One friend loved it, the other one said Meh. 

The chips and salsa were pretty good, but they're stingy with them and only give you one little basket for free. The guacamole was kinda eh, but with all the other food, I didn't even notice, And the place LOOKED really clean, so who knows?!

As for the service, on my 1st visit we were one of only three tables in there at the time, and service was fine. But on my second visit, it was busier, and it took about 45 minutes for them to get our food out. And all that time, they were too cheap-assed to give us more chips. LAME!

All in all, the servuce sucks, the food is OK, and the atmo is GREAT: crazy decor and amazing retro 80s music videos playing on a big screen TV while you eat. 

Other reviews also mention Mamita's hater-ish attitude toward food trucks...and I think this is the crux of Mamita's image problem:

They were on East Fremont Street before Zappos was even a gleam in some Modest Mouse fanboy's bespectacled, bicycling eye. Mamita's predates the hipster infestation...they survived YEARS of life on East Fremont before it was cool, so is it ANY FUCKING WONDER they don't want trendy shitty food trucks rolling in and stealing their bidness?! 

Mamita's is like that grumpy old man in the neighborhood who's constantly yelling at you kids to get off his goddamn lawn. They don't have a Twitter feed, they don't have a thing to ""check in,"" and they don't serve Pabst Blue Ribbon or have a bike rack out front. 

Mamita's, if you're listening, and you want a piece of that sweet, sweet hipster buck....stop complaining and start being more ironic, STAT!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,6,5,2,Yj4khIuIxTBv5koOzjbPsQ

When she had time she refilled our chips frequently. No drinks were refilled throughout our dinner and the table was only set after we got our food. 

The food is ok. Nothing spectacular. The combos are cheap at under $10 a plate and the food is plentiful. Most of the Cuban plates came with rice, black beans, and plantains. The rice was under cooked and not fluffy. The beans were good. The copious amount of plantains were a godsend. I was not super hungry so I just shared a bit of my friends' plates and an order of the Yucca Con Mojo. I was probably the happiest with the side items. 

The best part about Mamita's is their video dj. They play a mix of 80's-90's music and it is stuff you have not heard in ages. The atmosphere is a mixture of club and restaurant.
