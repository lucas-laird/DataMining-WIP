2467690,2018-02-24,0,-Pv-3Moxm6is6COkQIA7Kg,I have been to Bropards a couple times with friends and have enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed the karaoke and dancing there. I like the food but the menu is somewhat limited and has entrees that do not exactly fit my dietary needs otherwise I would give it a better score. Chicken Adobo or Pork & Pimentos or even Pork with Mungo Beans would be nice or Chicken Long Rice would be good additions. I do like the chicken wings though and the service is attentive.,TTemlnsYaGzVKwt0lFFsiA,1,0,4,uLBWBdAaDOex0FggYKKPjw

The staff is very well trained. Order their sizzling sisig, lechon cebu style and a bucket of beer, take a seat and enjoy the fun and laughter. Meet new friends or just enjoy the night. This is my favorite local spot in Las Vegas.",qpU4OkOBT4rBaPFpWUHbxw,1,0,5,P-zuYb3nN0chIrDE8E1nCg
