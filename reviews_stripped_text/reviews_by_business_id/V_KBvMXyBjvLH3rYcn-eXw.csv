19591,2010-07-26,0,V_KBvMXyBjvLH3rYcn-eXw,"Checked this place out on a Friday night around 730PM.  We had a BOGO Combo coupon from the Entertainment Book.  Thought it was going to be pretty busy, but it was only about 2/3 full when we got there and about 1/2 full when we left.  It's a little confussing as to how to get your order in and the large menu to read is in a weird place.  We actually didn't notice it until we were leaving.

Went with the make-it-yourself burgers.  His: 1/2LB patty with just about any/every topping he liked and regular fries.  He liked it, but did comment that it probably wasn't the best combo of toppings (his bad for not thinking it through).  It did get really messy though, and had to finish it up with a fork and knife.  Mine: 1/4LB patty with mostly veggies, wrapped in lettuce (more like sandwiched with 2 large lettuce leaves) with sweet potato fries (tasty-  tossed with cinnamon and brownsugar).  Total, with the coupon, came to about $12- 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 drinks.  They do charge extra for sweet potato fries ($.60 I think), and for premium toppings (like avocado, bacon, sauteed mushrooms, etc).

Overall, the burgers were tasty and filling.  As mentioned, the toppings kind of overpower the meat, but that was fine with us.  You can go as basic or as intricate as you want.  There are a ton of toppings to choose from which makes for a very neat concept, but I think I'd try SmashBurger down the street, before giving this place another shot.",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,0,0,3,N_-HNlRFjOAIJvLdkflkjw
29033,2011-04-08,0,V_KBvMXyBjvLH3rYcn-eXw,"Pretty great burgers considering this place is sort of halfway between fast food and a sit-down restaurant. I always go for the Medieval, and it's always delicious.

For those who demand a bit more control, a ""build-your-own"" burger is an option, so you can really go nuts and craft your own personal dream burger.

Service is fast, and they're always insanely friendly at the front counter. Some of the nicest people I've ever seen working at a restaurant, regardless of class.

Prices are a little high, so I don't go there as much as I would if they knocked it down a buck or two. That's a pretty small complaint, though.

I'd definitely recommend everyone who likes burgers try Create out at least once. It's a permanent fixture in my food-run repertoire.",UYACF30806j2mfbB5vdmJA,0,0,4,0czQdM7dYFAVhmaajtH8_g

92982,2009-08-17,0,V_KBvMXyBjvLH3rYcn-eXw,"I seem to be on a burger kick lately and looked forward to trying Create.

Like Cheeburger Cheeburger which I recently visited for the first time, Create challenges you to...well... Create your own burger. With plenty of cheeses and toppings to choose from, as well as a choice of buns, there should be something for everyone here. Where I tip the cap to Create, however, is that they do have a few ""pre-Created"" (?) burgers on the menu for those that aren't feeling creative.

I went with the Impressionist, which had jalapenos, spicy mayo and pepper jack cheese.  Overall, a tasty burger, although I felt it could have been warmer (temp wise, not spicy wise). Not sure if the toppings may have cooled it off some.

Since I'd just been to Cheeburger Cheeburger, I kept comparing the two burgers and had to say that I like the Cheeburger Cheeburger burger a little better. 

The sweet potatoes fries were actually a little too sweet, but I loved the regular fries.

Never having had frozen custard before I went with two scoops: the flavor of the day, Cake Batter, and Chocolate.  WOW.  The frozen custard just blew my mind and my stomach is still happy.

Service was super friendly and helpful.  And the prices were quite reasonable. More $$ than fast food but certainly less than other area burger specialty restaurants.

The burning question - Would I go back? The frozen custard tipped my answer to YES.  My burger tip: Create your own with a couple toppings and go for the 1/3 pound. I bet that would have increased my enthusiasm on the burger.

When I go back and get Creative with my own burger, I'll update my review.",tyPhJy0OMJqf9k9Xzck3uA,1,0,3,6hQ_P5GG-J9qayz1QrZuXw
124283,2011-10-31,0,V_KBvMXyBjvLH3rYcn-eXw,"I have been to Create a couple times in the past year or two, but not since I started the blog so I was long overdue for a return trip and full analysis. I remember liking it well enough in the past, so I'm not sure if it's because I've had a string of not-so-good burgers lately but I left this most recent meal extremely happy. I know you're not used to hearing these words lately around here, so please read on.

Create has one location now, but according to their website there are more on the way. Located in a typical Vegas strip mall on Lake Meade near the 95, the interior really leaves something to be desired. There are hints at something decent, but the tables are kind of cheap looking, and it's just missing something I can't quite put my finger on. It doesn't help that the ordering process is totally convoluted, but more on that in a minute. When you walk in the main doors there is a small counter to your right which I think was added since the last time I was there, and I think might have been placed there to help figure out how to order? Who knows.

About the ordering process, it's called Create for a reason; the menu is set up for you to really create your own burger, from amount of meat, type of bun, toppings, fries, etc. Enough burger places follow this format now so it's not completely original, yet still appreciated. But what sets this place apart for me from a lot of other places is that they also offer quite a few pre-designed choices. You've heard me gripe about this many times, and I fully acknowledge and welcome the menu choices that a restaurant actually takes the time to make. Last time I was there I was handed a clip board, golf pencil and sheet of paper with things to circle or check off. They've updated this slightly for the green movement by using a laminated sheet and dry erase markers. They have also alleviated some of the confusion by adding two large LCD screens above the registers with 6 different burgers to choose from complete with fries and a drink so you can just order a meal number like so many other fast food burger joints. But that's really where the fast food ties end.

I can say it; the burger is excellent. The meat has great flavor on its own, and when you order it medium rare it actually comes out this way, unlike some other places I've been to lately that can't quite get it right although they are charging a great deal more and are in a much fancier location. I had the Classical, which comes with crinkle cut pickles, American cheese, onion strings, shredded lettuce and thousand island-ish dressing called ""the sauce."" I had a choice of a few different buns but stuck with the white one for simplicity. The bun is totally dense and fantastic, just the right amount of meat and bun. I've also had the Hawaiian sweet bun and it was great and dense as well. Cooked medium rare, the burger is just juicy and drippy enough without being sloppy, and is moist all the way to the end. My cheese was melted, the veggies were fresh, and I was quite happy with it.
The fries are also great; although I think the few times I've been there I have thought that a few on my plate were a bit undercooked. They are of the 'natural' variety and a million more times flavorful and better than Five Guys' overrated version. Yes, I'll be picking on that place quite a bit now until everyone gets it out of their heads that they're good.

As for the price, it's also right on the mark. At $8.37 for my meal which included a great 1/3lb burger, plenty of great tasting fries and a drink for something that was cooked to order and better than regular fast food, they hit it right on the mark. I've heard people rave about Smashburger, Five Guys, and other slightly-fancier-than-fast-food burger joints lately, but those are all way too greasy, and come in at least $3-5 more for a meal. Plus their burgers can't compete with this one. For those who love any of those other places I just listed, I compel you to try Create.

Also on a side note, they have fantastic custards with all sorts of options. I had one last year and liked it a lot, but skipped it on this trip as I am trying to lose weight still...",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,5,o7NTeKLSSXijkEG4qT61KQ

Their ""veggie"" burger is mushy and really kind of super vegan, ricey, wierdness.  Suggestion for Create -- Get a simple ole regular Boca Burger.  Not impressed by the fact that it took about 5-8 minutes to place an order at the counter and another 23 (yes I timed it..how OCD of me) to have them make 2 kids burgers with fries and a veggie burger for me.  That is a little long for counter ordering.  I suppose it's fun to try it out cause it is a novel idea, but the time it takes to get the food and order the food etc really is not for someone wanting to pop in for a quick burger on your way to your next destination.  Also I looked across the room and anouther 3 person party hd a mistake on their order, and both people with correct orders were done eating before we left and she still didn't have her order corrected.  They are slow, not impressed with the food, and if they want to speed up the ordering process maybe they need to organize the ordering screens a little for the employees, they seems like they are really busy wiht the modifiers.",S4b2Z1Z-HPCW8mDR2dE2eA,0,0,2,1F1QUhes-Uq9e3AOR4m1Kw

She had never eaten there before so we both decided, why not?

The menu is odd, because you have to literally create your own burger.  Now, the choices and combination are way to large for me to want to do the math on, but when you know what you're doing, its a piece of cake.

I don't really remember exactly what I had that day, or the several visits after, but each creation was amazing.  Now that is partially my fault as I am the one picking the toppings/sauces, but the show stopper is the burger itself.  The meat is perfectly cooked, comes apart in your mouth and is just heaven.  The sweet potato fries are amazing, as well as the onion rings and the french fries.  You can't go wrong with either of the side choices.

I had a pretty typical burger. Pepper Jack cheese, Kaiser roll, L, T, O, their ""special sauce"" paired with sweet potato fries. Husband had a very similar burger with grilled onions and onion rings. Pricing was very reasonable and on top of that we were using our Entertainment Book BOGO coupon.

Right off the bat I can say that while it was OK, we won't be making a special drive up to eat here again. It was just OK. Nothing super spectacular, just kind of average. The bun was not my favorite, too chewy. The ingredients fresh were but the burger lacked flavor and juiciness.

Upon walking in, we were greeted by a friendly employee who explained the process to us - either we can order directly off the menu, or come up with our own creation - including choice of patty, size, cheeses, toppings, sauces, etc. And they truly have a ton of options. Create also offers beef, turkey, and veggie burgers - definitely something for everyone.

My husband and I decided to create our own burger, while our friend opted to order off of the menu. Everything tasted great, including our sides which included the sweet potato and fresh cut fries.

As I love custard, we had to try some for dessert. It turns out that if you sign up to be a text club member, you receive a free custard of choice. The custard was a large portion and really good.

So used to driving up and down Lake Mead asking my girlfriend, Wendys? In-N-Out? etc... I was worried about the prices initially because of the gourmet label, but we each got a 1/3 lb burger + combo for under 15 dollars. Add dessert to share and it was still under $20.

I hate walking up to a counter at a new place and looking stupid by not knowing what to order, but the menu is away from the counter so you have time to customize your burger if you so choose, without holding up the line or saying uhhh...

Nice little area outside to eat, and the weather right now is perfect in the evening. They bring your food out to you in a reasonable time, faster than most quick sit down eateries. Even though we sat outside the counter girl, guy who brought our food, and even the owner made a special visit each just to chat and ask if we needed anything / if the food was to our liking. 

Food was excellent, exceeding our expectations and left us wondering why we always go to fast food drive thru's. The burger was cooked thoroughly and was REAL, non-greasy and tasteful. The texture is almost like handmade but I did not inquire. Girlfriends turkey burger was also an A+. Fresh cut fries were on point, will have to try the others some other time. Like I mentioned this was our first trip so I didn't want to try anything too different for my comfort. 

Dessert was ridiculous, we usually have sonic and the Create 'custard' blew them out of the water. Strawberries and nuts were mixed throughout, every bite was great, most places have toppings that you never taste halfway in.

Sure, they have some pre-constructed burgers for you to choose from, but the fun and the sheer amount of time deciding between all of the customizable options is what this place is about.  It seriously took me and the girlfriend 20 m to decide how to construct each of our burgers.

Part of the problem was that there are no samples or pictures for you to review.  That would have helped immensely.  The pictures for the add-ons and some samples of the various sauces would have been good.  Or just have all the sauces available for you to just pump yourself.  That would've been fine too.  It was kinda fun constructing the burger though.

The burgers did take a bit on the longer side to come out.  But they were nicely cooked and tasty.  The sweet potato fries I ordered were good, not great.  The onion rings were massive.

The interior space is very open, clean and modern post/diner. Create seems to have hired an entire waitstaff of 'cool drink of water ' girls to take your order. Nice, but points off because I ordered a burger and they forgot to put the order in, thus resulting in me waiting around for twenty minutes with nothing to do but poke at my empty custard cup.

The custard comes in three flavors: vanilla, chocolate and strawberry, with a variety of toppings. I had hot fudge and chocolate chips, and they were very generous with the hot fudge. Plus for that.

The burgers also come in with a bunch of toppings, but I had a pre-made setting: the Modernist. Avocado, mushrooms, tomato and swiss cheese on hawaiian roll. It was delightful and just the right size. I was not fond of how the waitress at the counter tried to upsell me to buy a double or triple patty burger as she claimed it was a 'small portion'.

For Las Vegas, I would say this place is fairly expensive. The food was fine, maybe not rock my world, and needs a bit of smoothing out with the staff.

Apparently the name implies an artistic flare where you craft your own burgers (and frozen custards) with a myriad of toppings and choices for size of meat (1/4,1/3, 1/2 lb) and breads (white, wheat, hawaiian, and onion) and even fries (regular, sweet potato).  Being given the privilege of selecting everything a la carte reminded me of assembling a bowl of stir-fry at a mongolian barbeque, but like most mongolian barbeque experiences, the customer usually does not have a good sense of balance when it comes to flavors (typically overdoing one thing or another) so that may explain some of the mediocre reviews (to critique one's own CREATE burger is perhaps critiquing oneself).  When it comes to creating the perfect burger, I'm more inclined to think along Steve Jobs' quote, ""People don't know what they want until you show it to them.""

Therefore I opted to choose amongst one of the 5 pre-named titles posted above the cash register to see if the guys behind the counter really knew how to create a decent burger.  The one that caught my eye was ""The Surrealist"" consisting of lettuce, tomato, applewood bacon, fried egg, chipotle mayo, grilled onions, and a fried onion ring.  I opted for the hawaiian bread bun and cheddar as my cheese of choice and braced myself to yell ""Who's your Dali?"" upon biting into this seemingly mouthwatering work of art.  Unfortunately, this burger will not be worthy of persistence in my memory.  This was a case where the sum of the parts was not greater than the whole since the piece of lettuce was extended about half a foot outside the bun in all directions, the fried egg was overcooked without any runny yolk (where's the fun in that?), and not sure about the rationale of grilled onions + fried onion ring.  Bright spots were the well seasoned and meaty cut of the applewood bacon, the perfectly melted cheddar cheese, and the smoky yet smooth addition of the chipotle mayo.  I would probably bump this review to 3.5 stars for the sweet potato fries.  Crisped to perfection with a gentle dusting of cinnamon sugar, these were a pleasant sweet foil to the savory burger and reminded me of the crunchy nearly-burnt edges of a solid french toast.  

Conceptually this sounds like it should be destined for greatness, but given the shoddy assembly of the separate components and the requirement of an artistic burger eye from the customer in building the perfect burger, one could do so at a more modest price with unlimited attempts in the comfort of his/her own backyard picnic.

It's pretty nearby my boyfriend's house, but we've never really thought about checking it out until we heard about how great it is. I ended up going with one of my friends on a pretty hot day (perfect weather for frozen custard) and I ordered a Modest Modernist combo ($8.99) and Berriesoho masterpiece ($4.99). My total came out to about $14. It was more than I normally spend on this type of food for myself, but a third of the bill went to the giant frozen custard; more than enough for two people. 

My combo came out fairly quick and my first impression was that the meal looked pretty boring and a little dry. I think I'm just so used to going to burger joints that have all kinds of sauces spilling out of the burger when you take your first bite (kinda like a Carl's Jr. ad). However, when I took my first bite, it was like instant love. The reason why I chose the Modernist is because I love anything with mushrooms or avocado and this burger had BOTH along with Swiss cheese, tomato, and chipotle mayo added into the mix. The burger was just exploding with all kinds of goodness and they didn't even need a bunch of crazy sauces to make it taste so delicious. The fries were cooked to perfection; perfectly crisp and fresh, just how I like them.

I actually ordered my frozen custard after I finished my burger because I figured it would melt if I just had it sitting there while I ate my meal, but I ended up inhaling my burger in a matter of three minutes, so that was pointless. It was weird because the frozen custard took longer to come out than the burger did and I would think it'd be the complete opposite. Since I got it ""Masterpiece,"" all the ingredients were just blended together. The other option would be to get it in sundae form, but I guess I was feeling ""artsy."" It was my first time ever trying frozen custard, so I don't have much to compare it to, but boy was it fantabulous! It was very smooth and not too sweet. I was pretty full from the burger already, but I'm pretty much a glutton for any type of dessert and ended up eating half of it. I put the other half in my freezer the second I got home so I could have some in case of a withdrawal.

2931757,2010-11-17,0,V_KBvMXyBjvLH3rYcn-eXw,"Not bad.  

In theory, Create is an amazing burger joint.  The menu allows you to choose what type of burger meat you want (angus, buffalo, etc).  It gives you a grocery store's worth of options for toppings, including varieties of cheese, veggies, etc.  And if they did a good job cooking the burger, Create would be a five star place.

But Create fails on the fundamentals.  A burger joint should let you choose how you want the meat cooked (rare, medium rare, medium, etc.).  Create doesn't.  It's unfortunately one of those restaurants that requires all burgers to be cooked medium-well (probably on the advice of some lawyer without taste buds).  And a medium-well burger makes my  taste buds cry.

That said, their toppings were fresh and damn tasty (I had my burger with cheddar and avocado).  They also have sweet potato fries as an option and they did a solid job with those.  The milk shakes were outstanding (although can you really screw up a milk shake?  It's the perfect sweet, tasty treat).

So, 5 stars if you don't mind tasteless burger meat.  Otherwise, Create gets 3.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,2,2,3,jQ9lP7SF87xJ9dR_8nfXEQ

The burgers  are super good. I would go so far as to say that they're better than Five Guys Burgers. And its not as blindingly bright in here as it is at Five Guys. Plus the retro burger theme has been done a million times. 

The custom menu is pretty extensive - both my little niece and my vegetarian  gf found something they liked here. Fries? Awesome. Sweet potato Fries? Awesome. Service? Awesome. The giant chunk of meat? You better believe that was awesome. There was an older lady who very patiently explained their menu to us, we got free samples of their yogurt, I got a free soda for being a good boy and everyone had a grand old time. I didn't leave feeling like an overstuffed grease ball.

I would actually come back here to get a burger next time I'm in town. And its next to a miniature golf place so if you have little family members or just feel like touching a glow in the dark gorilla's butt...then this little strip mall will satisfy all your needs.",HwmTzORmEfa9HgSfmA0RQw,0,1,4,eo2eXRjwF3O7uwKTJ4YwgQ

After countless drive by's and wonderment, I decided to pop in a few days ago and try it out for lunch.  This is one of those places where it's your fault if your burger tastes like crap because you choose your toppings.  I think that's fantastic!  After all, what's not fun about making a crazy burger and trying it out?

Since it was our first time we took a few suggestions from the dude behind the counter and went with the hawaiian bun (it's like Hawaiian bread, sweet and yellowish), and I went for a fried egg, mushroom, roasted peppers and provolone cheese.  My boyfriend went for something quite similiar.  We ordered some sweet potato fries on the side and sat down with our number.  

The burger itself is great.  I love the texture and flavor of the meat.  On top of that, their toppings are good and make it fun to eat.  What I really enjoyed here was dessert--their concrete.  I love custard now and will order it here whenever I crave it.  Our first experience with custard was their berry concrete: vanilla custard with berries mixed in and topped with a nice heap of whipped cream.  It was yummy.

YUM! the burger was juicy and messy. (just the way i like em!) my mom drank some of the jasmine tea and said it tasted a bit watery. that was the only let down, but on another upside to the food it all came to right over 8 dollars too! what a good deal.

Just a quick recap it's a burger place where you basically pick out exactly what you want on your burger, from the type of lettuce to about 25 different sauces they have, endless.  The meat is tasty and all there different buns are soft and fresh so if you don't like it there is no one to blame but yourself.  They have different size beef patties, turkey, meat free, and portabella caps for you vegitarians or if you are just feeling healthy.  Their fries are OK but there sweet potato fries are real good.  

They have delicious custard too and there flavors change daily.  You can get sundays, shakes, or get the custard with toppings mixed in like coldstone does. 

I talked to the owner a bit when they first opened and he had all kinds of taste tests with friends and family and the end result shows.  The service is real friendly and the owner is always there.     

I think the prices are real cheap, 2 people can have burgers, fries, and sodas for under 20 bucks, good for me.  It's not a fast food place after all.

P.S.  My favorite is the 1/3lb on a hawaiian bun with pepper jack, grilled pineapple, lettuce tomato and red onion, mayo and teriyaki.",WANhIVSoD5oIIu2LfKx5Ig,1,0,4,PfmZihp8n0M5k7kOMmpyRA

  Since I'm working on eating a little healthier these days I opted for the turkey burger. As turkey patties go this one was very flavorful and juicy. Create allows you to build your own burger with the use of a checklist of toppings that can accompany your patty. I went pretty traditional with the tomato and lettuce, but tried the bleu cheese and chipotle mayo. Both of those items made my sandwich far different than what I would have gotten from the run-of-the-mill chain burger joint. I opted for the regular fries while my wife went for the sweet potato fries. Both orders of fries were quite flavorful and the sweet potato fries received a health sprinkling of cinnamon which set off the flavor real well. 

  I have to admit that I have a hard time swallowing a $20+ price tag for two burgers and fries, but as burgers go Create has a quality product with a great variety in clean, friendly surroundings.

There was a used rag sitting on the table next to me, I guess someone was cleaning up but I find that hard to believe. There was a LOT of trash on the floor (straw wrappers, fries, etc). Some of the tables were pretty dirty but no one was in the restaurant so I guess that is just the way they leave the place looking. The bathroom trash cans were overflowing, the hand soap had been watered down in a big way and the urinal was broken. My girlfriend said the women's restroom was the same way. The kitchen looked awful from the glance I saw coming back from the restroom. The food was not bad but with how disgusting that place was I will never be back.

Also, the owner came to our table before our food came out and let us know that he's gonna try to make sure we all get our food at the relatively same time.  We had a group of 8 guys.  They, apparently weren't ready for a group our size to come in for an early lunch that day.

The people love talking to you, and are more than welcome to help you out, and give you direction when making your own burger. Afterall, it's not easy to be an amazing culinary genius! You need a little help sometimes.

Everything is freshly made. I got the veggie burger. The patty is made with brown rice, tofu and beans I believe, and packed with corn starch to keep it together. It's a VERY filling patty so I got full fast. I did choose to top it with mushroom, swiss cheese, and avocados. Yum! I also opt for the king hawaiian bread (that bread goes great with any burger!)

Awesome burgers. Can't wait to try their custard which is also freshly made! Just a heads up though, the tab will rack up as you add more toppings. You get an option of ONE choice from every section, and some selected options are extra (like the king hawaiian bread for 15 cents).

He had the Medieval and I had the Classical both a 1/2 lb. and on whole wheat buns (medium-well). They were perfectly juicy and flavorful.  The sweet potato fries are yummy and my regular fries were pretty good but a tiny bit limp.  They have fresh brewed iced tea - 2 flavors today (2/13/11) and both were yummy.

For first timers like me, you'll be extremely overwhelmed by the menu.  I know the gimmick is that you can build your own burger, but seriously, do you need 24 different sauces to choose from?  At one point, the menu all blended together and I went with one of their ""specialty"" burgers that have pre-chosen fixings.

We didn't have to wait long for our food, which was a plus.  However, both my husband and I ordered our burgers medium rare, but they came out well done.  We didn't send them back because we were pretty hungry.  Mine came with avocado which was nowhere near ripe and hard as a rock.

I decided to give myself a treat after a great workout at the gym.....have to give back some of the calories, right?

I had no idea how it worked and the menu in the restaurant is posted at the front door facing your back when you enter...so you see it when you exit.....what the hell?  Seems very illogical to me, but whatever.  Because I didn't see the menu when I walked in, I had no idea what to do....so I asked the kid at the register, how does this work?  He kind of looked at me with a puzzled expression and said ""You place an order and I take it""......he was kidding around and explained that there are specialty Burgers that I can choose from or I can ""Create"" my own.  You choose 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 lb patties, the bread, and the toppings.

After browsing the specialty Burgers for a minute, I decided I wanted to order two of them.  I ordered a 1/4 lb Dali Burger  with White Bread & (Avocado, Peppers, Onions, Monterey Jack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, & Southwestern Ranch) and a 1/4 lb Impressionist Burger with Onion Bread & (Cajun Seasoning, Jalapenos, Lettuce, Tomato, Pepper Jack, & Atomic Mayo w/side of BBQ Sauce) and a bottle of Water.  He suggested that I get a side of BBQ Sauce with the Impressionist Burger....I took him up on his recommendation.  Total damage ($11.73), for the Burgers & bottled Water.  The price you see on the menu is the combo price.  He issued me a number and my change and told me they would bring out the Burgers when it was ready.

The restaurant has plenty of seating and nice comfortable booths....not what I expected.  They also sell Frozen Custard here....since I'm unfamiliar with what that is, I passed on trying it this visit.

After a few minutes my order was delivered by the manager.  He apologized because they ran out of Guacamole and substituted it with whole Avocado on the Dali Burger....I told him that was fine.  I started to take pics of the food and when he saw me, he asked if I wanted a picture with the Burger....I laughed and said yes.  What a nice guy.

I jumped into the Impressionist Burger first.....I couldn't wait to try it since it was loaded with Spicy Toppings.....I decided to take the first bite without the BBQ Sauce.  Wow....it was Spicy!  It had a very nice kick to it....not too blazing hot, but very enjoyable.  I am impressed because most joints make their mild....not this one!  Then I tried it with the BBQ Sauce per the cashier kid's advice.....yum!  The BBQ Sauce combined with the spicy flavor of the Atomic Mayo, Jalapenos, and Pepper Jack made this burger taste really good.  I wish I would have ordered a 1/3 lb patty though as the 1/4 lb seemed to be too small with all of the toppings.  The Beef was very flavorful, but I could have used more of it...next time I'll get the 1/3 or 1/2 lb patty....my bad.

After devouring the Impressionist, I went for the Dali Burger.  I loaded the Avocados into the Burger and again took a bite before I tried it with the Southwest Ranch Sauce.....it was pretty good, but needed the Ranch.  I poured some of the Ranch with each subsequent bite.....wow, another excellent Burger!  The Onion Bun added to it.....another great recommendation from the cashier kid....he must eat a ton of their Burgers to figure out great combinations of stuff.

Overall, it was a good experience....fresh, flavorful ingredients and the ability to customize your Burger are the highlights of this place.  The one knock would be the Bread....it was very ""doughy"" and just didn't do it for me.....tasted like and had the consistency of Wonder Bread.  Despite that flaw, I still gave it 4 Stars.

Yum!  Next time I'd like to try the Portobello burger...and opt for a wheat bun and maybe get a little more creative with toppings, but the combinations are endless...

The options for the custard is just as abundant!  Candy, nuts, berries, sauces...and of course the pre-set combos.

Not overdone with too much toppings that take away from the beef.  Ever heard of In N' Out?  That's what a hamburger's all about!  They do it simple...but right.

Create I tried with the fam on a whim.  We always pass by it and I've seen the good reviews.  I said to myself, ""Self...why not?  Give it a shot!""  The restaurant is nice, clean, quite modern-y.  Stainless steel, bold colors, very pleasing.  We were welcomed by two high-school employees, and right away were asked if we had been to Create before...to which I replied a healthy ""Nope!  But Yelp seems to like you guys!""  We were given the rundown of how it all works:  start with your size of burger, choose a bread, choose a cheese, choose your toppings (lots of em'), then choose a sauce!  So many friggin' combinations (I can't count exactly, even though yes I am Asian and yes I am good at math)...it drove me nuts!  The possibilities were endless!  So much so, they actually gave you a little pad and pencil to mark what you wanted on your burger!  Thankfully, Create has some featured burger combos you can choose from as well to lessen the stress.

For the four of us we chose two 1/2 pound burgers to share.  The first one was the 'Modernist' ($9.93) - sauteed mushrooms, avocado, tomato, Swiss cheese, and chipotle sauce.  The other burger was a 'Create Your Own' ($8.63).  We went crazy on this one!  Tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, romaine lettuce, roasted red peppers, alfalfa sprouts (I love this on sandwiches), with Pepper Jack cheese, mayo and spicy mustard!  These combos come with fries and a drink, but for a nominal charge we upgraded our fries to sweet potato fries and onion rings.  

The verdict?  Not bad!  Our burgers were cooked just right (lil' bit of pink in the middle), the bread was fresh, and the burgers were huge!   There was enough for the four of us to share.  The Modernist was very good, and our creation of a burger wasn't bad either.  I think next time I'll try a sauce with a little more kick.  The sweet potato fries were good but not as crispy as I like them.  The onions rings were great, I wish the serving was a bit bigger!  They were good dipping in a side of ranch.  

If you go to Create don't forget to try their frozen custard!  It is actually quite yummy.  They run at least 4-5 different flavors daily.  You can get scoops in a cup or cone then put various toppings on them, you can have a shake, or you can have Create's version of a Blizzard...the 'Concrete'.  We opted to try two Concretes in their sundae size ($4.99).  We got the 'Smithsonian' - vanilla frozen custard with hot fudge, caramel, pecans, whipped cream, and a cherry.  We also tried their 'Van Gogh Bananas' - vanilla frozen custard with bananas, hot fudge, fresh strawberries, caramel, peanuts, whipped cream, and a cherry.  Both were scrumptious!  I myself favored the Van Gogh Bananas because it was like a banana split.  Great way to end our meal.  Also a great way to make me start thinking about the dreaded treadmill again.  Ha!

So we walk in. There is ample parking in the strip mall lot, the facade is clean and neat.   Sufficient seating for around 50 patrons???  Guessing...Clean inside, bathrooms are clean.  There is a  process for ordering, so if this is your first foray into burger paradise, don't be nervous; they are there to help and will do so with a smile and zero, zip, nada attitude.  There are three resources you can use for your order preparation.  A sandwich board upon entering, strategically placed to your right as you enter the front door.  There is a menu board above and behind the counter and then you can pick  up a paper menu and fill out a check list to place your order.  However, I believe the boards have more ingredients listed, so you can write in your selected ingredients.  

Several bread selections as well as lettuce wrapped options are available.  My friend, she got the Portabello wrapped in lettuce and a side salad that all looked filling and refreshing all at once.  I, however, submitted to my whims and got down with a 1/3 pound Angus burger on the Hawaiian bun, lettuce, tomato, pickles special sauce and the best fries I've had to date.  I heard that that sweet potato fries are rockin' too.  

Can't wait for my next visit to try the highly recommended Turkey burger with the sweet tater fries.

We sampled the Custard and it was AMAZIING!  If I weren't so full from my dinner, I would have had a custard.  Maybe next time.

=Chocolate Custard with Strawberries and Bananas - First off the Bananas were not ripe, so it was bitter.

I guess, not a strong chocolate taste at all ,umm basically it was nothing to remember...
=Vanilla Custard with Sprinkles - The vanilla custard reminded me of soft serve ice cream ( I don't care for soft serve) and how can you go wrong with sprinkles?

4286930,2008-07-17,0,V_KBvMXyBjvLH3rYcn-eXw,"For a burger joint in Vegas, its a little pricey. For a burger joint in LA, I'd say it fits right in. 

I've been here once before, but never noticed they had a veggie burger. How did I miss that before? The Abstract kinda sounds gross. When I hear that name in regards to burgers, I think of Spam or a hotdog or some kind of FORMED meat. But the Abstract is their homemade veggie burger with grains and crap. Whoever made the batch that I ate, didn't mix thoroughly. I was hitting chunks of salt left and right. 

Maybe no one else cares, but veggie burgers are a serious affair to me. This veggie burger was meh. But I really appreciate that they're trying to satisfy the vegetarian demographic AND, they're homemade and crap. The inner texture was mushy, but it was super ceded by the crispy fried outside. Like a burger french fry. They also have portobello burgers for the carniphobic. 

They have a lot of add-ons available. Which can be dangerous. You could probably make a $20 burger. 

On my burger, I also got cut greens, provolone, and garlic mayo ... which was not very garlicky. I got the Hawaiian kaiser (like Hawaiian sweet bread, NOT with the intestines). 

My friend got sweet potato fries. They were alright. But the best sweet potato fries I've ever had was at Outside Inn on Charleston and Hualapai. 

My friend ordered the third size up in burgers. The smallest was the mini, then the something, then the majestic, I think. Anyways, it really wasn't that big. Like the diameter was the same size as that of the bun, but it was thick. 

The frozen custard. Luv It is now the yard stick by which I measure all other frozen custards (which will be henceforth referred to as: frotards). Create's was not as heavy, BUT it was also not as smooth ... until it melted. Their ratio of egg to milk was probably more milk, I'm guessing. It was more like ice cream than frotard, I think. They have a good variety of topping, though. 

If you dine in, after you pay for your junk, they give you a number to put on your table and they run the food to you when its ready, like Jason's Deli. 

This place is dangerously close to In-n-Out, Chipotle, and the Golden Spoon. And i would hardly call these burgers gourmet.

First - to say something good, wow they have a big menu with lots of options. 

Ok. 
Quality of meat - was not a big thick juicy meaty thing. It was like Burger King. Sad.
Out of Hawaiian bun, went with whole wheat. Very generic. Didn't have that yummy bready/yeasty flavorey thing that says, ""Mmm, someone must have baked this today!"" Nothing special here. 
One burger. To go. That's all I ordered. Took 45 minutes. Jeeze. 

I'm comparing this to the phenomenal burger (and amazing bun, btw) that I had at Neon Carrot in San Luis Obispo. Top quality meat, homemade ketchup (you don't even know how good and pure real ketchup can taste until you have homemade like this). After it is consumed, you sit and just say to yourself, ""Wow. I'm going to remember that forever now.""

Bottom line - this is just another lame burger joint. Set your expectations there. Nothing special. I've had special. This is not it.

Right away, the staff was super friendly and attentive. It was a little confusing when you walk in and I don't always love having to be instructed on how to order, but the personality of the staff won us over.

I ordered a turkey burger on wheat with swiss and carmelized onions. My boyfriend got a beef burger with fried egg and mushrooms.  Both were totally delicious.  We shared the fries, which were kinda soggy here and there, but overall tasty, and really enjoyed the multitudes of sauce options for dipping.  Surprisingly, my turkey burger was moist and didn't feel like one of those pre-fab frozen patties, like most turkey burgers you get dining out.

They did forget my boyfriend's chocolate malt... twice. But remedied it by being REALLY apologetic and serving a large instead of the regular size we ordered.  It was also a damn fine malt.

The ambience is your typical burger joint/fast casual kind of place. The booths were a bit busted and duct taped together, which was a bit trashy, but that happens. It's fine inside, but the whole place could just use a little zhush.

Unfortunately, there was a table full of really obnoxious people (adults, no less), laughing and yelling at the staff for more sauces and generally carrying on. More people kept coming and they started moving tables and chairs around, playing musical booth, knocking over condiments... and the staff kept accommodating them instead of asking them to tone it down, so that was a bit irksome, but likely a one-time thing.

We'll definitely go back, though. It's 3 stars this time, but could go up once we've tried more things and maybe they fix that  duct tape so it doesn't stick to my ass. :)",eH5cPO1SV9hTVktzenjYgw,0,0,3,_u-OuopkptJ3YAa9oHGAUg

My first thought as i entered the restaurant was ""how the f*** do i order???""  they have these little clipboards up by the cashier with order sheets.  You simply go down the list choosing what you want.  Its a bit overwhelming at first but just relax, take a deep breath, and slowly choose what you want.  They have so many toppings from alfalfa sprouts to grilled pineapples.  for i believe 85 cents more, you can add either mushrooms, quac, bacon or an egg.  

My burger 

-1/3 lb (a bit big, 1/4 lb would've been a better choice, but im a fat@ss)
-Wheat Bun
-Onions, lettuce, sprouts, grilled pineapple, tomatoes
-Added mushrooms (im a fungi fanatic)
-Swiss Cheese
-Chipotle ranch sauce

results = MUY BUENO!!!

I was very pleased with my choices, only thing i would have changed was the size of the burger but it tasted amazing.

Afterwards, I decided to get  strawberry shake which was also a good choice.  The custard based shake made the consistency very thick which i love.  Also the counter girl hooked it up with a mountain of whip cream which made everything that much better.

Just about any burger finickiness anyone can have will be satisfied here, and the people working here genuinely seem happy to help you in every way.  One of the girls working the counter took the time to patiently walk my 7 and 9 year-olds through the clipboard menu, where they mark off their choices (size, type of bun, toppings, sauces, etc.).  Another guy helped my wife review every type of burger that was offered while standing at the big stand-up menus.  And it didn't stop there.

After bringing our food to the table, one or more of the people working the counter or bringing food out would consistently (but not disruptively) glance over to see how we were doing, and somehow, would know when the time was right to ask if we needed anything.  I also noticed that when a party vacated a booth, it took about 5 seconds before someone came over and did a thorough cleaning job on the table.  The place is spotless and visually very pleasing in every way.

The food?  Well...consider that it's located 1/4 miles east of an In 'n Out Burger and 1/4 west of a SmashBurger...and it was crowded at 8:30 p.m. on Monday night, that says more than anything I could say!

Oh...and unlike the other 2 places, a half hour after devouring my burger and yummy frozen custard, I was *pleasantly* full.  If I had eaten at the other places, I would've been looking for a bathroom!!

*Create* definitely is doing something right, and I only hope even more people discover this place!

PS - How Heidi Knapp Rinella of the LVRJ could give Smashburger an A- overall and Create a B, I'll never know!

The atmosphere was a little too bustling for my taste, but that was most likely because there was a large grouping of girl scouts the night I was there.  The idea of Create is very cool, and is a rising trend in burger restaurants: create your own burger.  You pick up a clipboard with a sheet of paper giving you options for your burger, and boy do they have options at Create!  You could choose between 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 # patties, and many other choices, but I got the 1/3.  You could choose the bun, the cheese, toppings, and sauce.  The sauces is where the options because almost limitless.  They probably have around 20 different sauces to choose from.  Sauces range anywhere from different mayos like Horseradish, Cajun, Garlic, or regular mayo to steak sauce and their in-house special sauce.  

I got a 1/3 pound burger with pepper jack cheese, roasted green chiles, grilled onions, white bun, green leaf lettuce, and cajun mayo.  I ordered a side of their special sauce to dip the fries in, which I would highly suggest.  The burger was good.  Not great, not bad (by any means), but good.  I felt that it lacked some crunchiness, but how can I complain when it's me choosing the ingredients!  The best parts of the burger were the patty (very juicy), and the cajun mayo.  Their sauces are one of their high points, and I feel like this is a very important thing to be good at.  

The fries were actually pretty impressive, tasting a lot like In-N-Out's fries, giving me the assumption they use fresh potatoes.  The sweet potato fries were also very good, but weren't any different than most sweet potato fries.  

Overall, I would go back to Create if it weren't so far, and would probably come back if I was in the area.

We always do the create a burgers and hand them a sheet with clearly circled items. None of the burgers came out right. Some were missing toppings, mine and the BF came with no sauces in it at all. Mine was to be cooked to a medium pink and it was well done with no pink at all and seemed to be the same size as my mom in laws even though I ordered a bigger burger patty. They have a new item on a dry erase board of onion strings so we put on our papers we want onion strings as our sides. 3 of us got onion RINGS instead of the onion strings. I asked for a side of a sauce to go with the strings and it wasn't brought either. Grandma isn't too picky and just ate her stuff, but I think hers was right only because she barely put anything on hers. 

They got to making us onion strings which was nice of them to correct the problem. One batch came and it was really chunky into onion cakes. Good flavor, but nothing was string about it. A second batch came out and it was more like strings and was much better.

5181366,2010-07-01,0,V_KBvMXyBjvLH3rYcn-eXw,"So, I've been into burgers lately and trying to find different places who will serve me a giant-honking beef patty that'll satisfy my preggo appetite.  Me and the hubby it up Create on a Tuesday night, an hour before closing.  I was happy that the place wasn't completely empty, a few people here and there, because that always makes me feel awkward having the staff watch you eat because there's nothing else for them to do.

The hubby and I decided to take the option to make our own burgers.  He got a 1/3 pound (majestic) to be cooked medium well, with Hawaiian bread, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, grilled pineapple, and green leaf lettuce with teriyaki sauce.  I got a 1/2 pound (monarch) to be cooked medium, with a lettuce wrap, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, grilled onions and a fried egg ($.55 extra) with the garlic mayo (highly recommended by the cashier, he said he eats everything with it).  We both got combos, hubby decided on sweet potato fries and I got a side salad (salad is an extra $.99).

We found a booth, had a sat, and waited for our food.  It actually didn't take too long, but they mixed-up our orders a bit, the wrong sides for the wrong burgers.  Not a big deal, we just asked for a extra plate (that took about 5 minutes) and then got down and dirty into our meat patties.  They both looked really good, but the burgers were well overly cooked.  The burgers got the crap cooked outta them (well done + an extra 5 minutes), but they still had a bit meat juice left in them.  I felt the beef itself was missing something...oh flavor!  It didn't seem like they season the meat, which is a shame.  At a place that is serving strictly burgers (yes, I know they have custard too, but we didn't try any this time around), I tend not to season it and let the burger speak for itself.  The garlic mayo is way overwhelming by itself, like a punch in the face with a garlic bulb, but on the burger it seemed to have mellowed out and was really yummy.  It helped my dried out burger taste better.  The side salad was just some chopped lettuce with tomatoes, cucumber, and some dried out carrot grated on top, nothing to get excited about and I'm still wondering if it was worth paying the extra $1 for.

The hubby liked his burger and his fries, he does have a very large sweet tooth.  I didn't get a taste of it, but he said he enjoyed it and did notice the overcooked burger.  A little surprising because he normally doesn't comment on things like that so it wasn't just me being crazy picky preggers lady!

When we were there, we weren't the only ones having overcooked cow problems.  There was another couple that complained and I'm pretty sure they made them a new order.  I was way too hungry to send it back after a taste and wait for another one.  Baby would have been pissed to tease her with food and then wait for it to come back.  My insides would have been bruised.

Overall, the jury is still out if we'll go back for burgers, but we will probably try the custard sometime in the future.",HG2Q5IgDp1vc-SDrFr_hMQ,1,1,3,zbWui2pzckU7VX5RUqVHBA
5199069,2010-03-28,8,V_KBvMXyBjvLH3rYcn-eXw,"You know I am the worst 'vegetarian' ever if I am writing a review of a hamburger joint, but actually, Create has a rather enticing salad selection. However, I did not try them. Sigh. I just can't work this protein thing out, and generally, if my friends want to try a new place where meat is the main attraction, I am happy to give it a shot. I just think it's a friendly way to be.

Me, Borg and Hendee (my artist pals) piled into the Camino (the El in the El) and headed to Create.  I think it is a pretty nice environment. It definitely feels like it is part of a chain--very clean, bright and crisp, and there are plans for more locations and franchise opportunities; however, it is a locally owned business. The joint was jumping with mostly younguns, i.e. teenagers and 20-somethings. They had a wildly catchy pop soundtrack bumpin'. I admit: I sang along on more than one occasion.

The menu is a little overwhelming because there are a lot of choices. I knew I wasn't eating beef, though, so I quickly settled on a turkey burger with grilled onions, mixed greens, pickles and spicy mustard with a side of sweet potato fries. The bill came to a little over $6 without a drink, which I think is a darned good deal given that a ""side"" of fries was literally an entire sweet potato of goodness. They were not the best I have had, but I am always very happy to see them on the menu! Plus, they were hot hot hot, and food served hot always tastes a smidgen better. The turkey was a little dry; making a juicy turkey burger is hard. (The juiciest I have had is at Fat Burger.) My friends also ordered a Caesar salad, and I was able to steal a couple of servings of that tasty number. Unfortunately, we did not sample the custard, but that menu looked pretty delightful with both Fruit loops and Kit Kat, along with a bevy of other candied treats, on the topping list.  

The standouts for me were the sweet potato fries, the selection of toppings and the salad offerings. For now, I am going to slap four stars on it because I am curious to go back and eat more salads. Oh, and I am feeling a little sheepish, as I just looked at their online menu and they have a veggie burger that I overlooked when I was there. You can also order a Portobello. My meat-eating subconscious must have just scanned right over that. Tricky little devil.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,7,4,UMcV4LDYfCD5aPbMaprZug
5204216,2009-09-06,0,V_KBvMXyBjvLH3rYcn-eXw,"After going here for lunch I think Rose O.'s review is spot on. The food was in the 4-5 star range, but the service was in the 2 star range.

One day at lunch I noticed that some guys had come back from a new burger place because of the amazing looking sweet potatoes fries I saw them chomping on. I asked them where they got it and they said Create. I had seen the place open up a while back, but never stopped in to check it out. After ""sampling"" a few fries I decided I would look the place up. When I found out they had a couple of vegetarian dishes I was sold.

The next time I went out to lunch with a group from work we figured we would go here. There were a number of us going so we had to take several cars. I hit the gas so we could be the first in line, and first we were. Unfortunately we were the last to get our food and head back to work. That's where the 2 star service comes in. Apparently one of the cashiers made a mistake and had to ring the order up as pickup order.  So we sit around waiting for 20 minutes wondering where the food is and when we ask it was sitting in the kitchen the whole time!

Normally I would give them the benefit of the doubt because mistakes sometimes happen, but after reading Rose O.'s review of the place I have a feeling that mistakes are a common occurrence rather than a one off affair.",5iOHz6pHmXi9SoB5qomRWQ,2,0,3,7wWgZdT9tr8io3exYe7JBw

*Great value/affordable - Check (some people call this place expensive - but I think $7 for a combo at a ""nice"" burger place is reasonable)
*Awesome fries and SWEET POTATO fries - Check 
*Cool topping list - Check (pineapple, lots of veggies, tons of sauces, etc)
*Freaking awesome custard - banana was the flavor of the day! We mixed it with caramel and oreos - OMG good.
*Juicy burger - nope

So this is my issue with Create. I ordered a 1/4 lb burger and asked if they could cook it medium. They said no it was too small and would have to be well done. Alright, I don't mind a well done burger (ie I love in and out and their's are certainly small and well done!).  The burger comes out and while it's tasty cause of all the awesome toppings I added to it, the burger itself was very dry. Not only was it very dry it was flavorless. If you're going to make a dry burger at least season it well so it tastes delicious. I'm a huge beef fan and when I eat a burger I'm looking for that certain ""j ne se qua"" .. the magic.. the beefy goodness that is a burger! In n Out provides that for a freaking $1.29, not sure why they can't get it right here.

Overall : blah burger with awesome toppings. I'm rounding it up from 3 to 4 stars based on the amazing custard and overall decent value.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,6,2,4,fCCyB0dMHqwQD4ioJXPlLA

We had been running around found errands and were really hungry, we were close to Create and been wanting to try it for a while.
I ordered the Classical burger with french fries, my hubby ordered the Medieval burger with onion rings...we both ordered our burgers as 1/4 LB. cooked medium.
The burgers were small, and not cooked medium. It reminded me of the flat frozen burgers you get at an amusement park stand. My fries were limp and greasy. The onion rings were just the big fat run of the mill rings that have no taste and were probably frozen.
We had a coupon for buy one meal get one free, I don't know if that's why the food was so bad, but as soon as I started taking pictures of my food, one of the workers ran over to ask us if everything was alright.

5511152,2012-05-02,0,V_KBvMXyBjvLH3rYcn-eXw,"When Lance owned Create it was super amazing. Ever since it was sold, it has gone down hill fast.

My wife and I used to go to Create every Wednesday night, but now, we have stopped going at all. Our orders come out wrong every time without fail and the staff has lost their energy and drive.  One time, there was a young child (probably 10 or 12 years old) at the register when I walked up. The adult behind the counter looked at them and said, ""you can do it."" The child proceeded to take my order... for 10 minutes while she searched for the buttons on the screen and tried to understand my request for ""roasted red pepper Italian vinaigrette"" on the side.  I ended up with red peppers on my burger and The Sauce on the side... not what I asked for.  Meanwhile, the adult behind the counter did nothing to assist; this experience was the last straw for me.

Also, when Lance was there he always had three custards: vanilla, chocolate, and a flavor of the day.  Create still acts like they have a flavor of the day, but in reality, it's a ""combination"" if the day using vanilla or chocolate custard. There is no additional ""flavor"" like orange, banana, or peanut butter.  And, when I ask the staff what is in one of the combinations, they honestly have no idea and aren't willing to find out.

The restaurant was very loud and it was too windy to eat outside so I decided to make my order to go.  I ordered a medieval burger (bacon cheeseburger with BBQ sauce) and fries to go.  Fries were ok.  Definitely fresh potatoes, which is nice to see, but they were quite limp.  I would have liked to see them double fried so they were more on the crisp side.

The burger was horrible and lacked flavor.  The meat was cooked medium but was very quite dry and bland.  Bacon was quite crispy, too much so for my liking, and the bun was gummy.  To be honest, it tasted like a poorly made Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr. but cost twice as much.
