As a good Jew, I don't take kindly to cold pastrami, but the staff told me it was too late to heat it. Also, the sandwich seemed to be comprised of leftover pastrami bits - like trim. It didn't taste terrible, but was a bit odd. The matzo ball soup is pretty good. For a safer pastrami fix head to Towers Deli in the Canal Shoppes.",rd1kcbcis6EfEBGMOnsGtg,2,2,3,5zSGm5PU9c9hNZT3KNE6Pg

The sandwich was a good size, light, very flavorful and cole slaw comes on the side with it.

1578408,2013-07-01,1,gtgwlSNqDAehi723uMdpIg,"Rialto Deli is located in the Venetian casino food court.  It is cheap and tastes cheap.

I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and the BBQ beef sandwich.  The ""grilled chicken"" was a breaded chicken patty.  I felt very tricked by that!!  mush mush.
The meat in the bbq beef sandwich was drenched in barbecue sauce and it was just super sweet and gross.  This was very similar to food you'd find in a high school cafeteria.  And hey, I never minded cafeteria food in school... but that ish was cheap/free for me and I'm not in high school anymore.  I would rather spend a few more bucks and get something else in this food court.",lNQRXZpPiNRDxCU6Uv7mNg,1,1,2,1tFGecuFSVryfu5E5M84Zw

The french dip was average portion, but tasteless.  The au jus was tasteless.  A small container of cole slaw was very good.  The onion rings were very tasty and a large portion.

Two stars is all I can give it because of the lackluster sandwich, but you could certainly do worse.",s7eI04en5to4udzesyRNPg,0,0,2,potJvEkc0Kbkec9DMixlnQ

Have had it repeatedly, never disappoints (tend to stay at Venetian/Palazzo quite often). For under $10, it's a steal on the strip. Quick. Cheap. Easy. Delicious. Good enough that it'd still get 5 stars with a higher price tag.",mjS46QR4b81Gq3knsd7Ieg,0,0,5,IuoS1ZBXdAXQGXhB1JpCaw

Various sandwich options with different breads to select from.

I went eeeeennn on the Pastrami Sandwich ($8.95) that comes with coleslaw.  

Average sandwich, not good, not bad, just ok. Decent price point and amount of meat, especially for The Begas.",Y0DSxhhChQwzoQsLeDuvRw,0,0,3,PLQlyXB9tG1z-Flx3QWzvw

The guy helping me was very accommodating.  I alwayz ask for extra lettuce which I know can be a pain in the ass.  My only two complaints about this place were that their wheat bread wasn't very good and they gave me my meal in a to go container when I asked to eat it in the food court.  Otherwise, a great place to get a simple sandwich when you want something quick at the Venetian.",lLfcbYGTeVxQN5Ig0ompJg,1,1,3,OUsFziJH4wooHm24FsIL1Q

My wife and I were hungry and wanted a quick sandwich to eat before heading to the pool.  The price was right, I believe around 7 bucks for a chicken sandwich, but the sandwich was TINY.  Not much bread at all, which is what I was wanting to absorb the alcohol that was about to be coming.

Sweet and simple review.  I would rather pay 15 for a pastrami sandwich from Canters for sure.  Our next time in Vegas this will be a vague memory.  And if something isn't worth trying again, it sure as hell doesn't get more than 3 stars from me!",InxaL8hCQrs6XmLtbkcjSA,0,0,2,QMJwHDH7Xz8LvXDRkypJ-Q

4341535,2009-07-22,11,gtgwlSNqDAehi723uMdpIg,"This is the place you go inside the luxurious Venetian Hotel on the Las Vegas strip when you are:

1. Broke after losing all of your money gambling
2. Don't want to spend $50/person for lunch in a finer Venetian Restaurant
3. Want a sandwich that costs less than $10
4. In a hurry
5. Want a snack before you get into your car in the parking lot
6. Is the last money you will lay down in Sin City before you leave
7. All of the above

The Rialto Deli is inside the Food Court on the main floor of the Venetian Hotel, near the escalators going up to the parking lots.

So it makes sense that you stop here for a cheap bite before you leave Sin City.

You know, all of those beautiful luxury hotels, like the Venetian, with all of their Glitz, Glam, and Amenities weren't built off the ""Winnings"" of the visiting gamblers. 

Nope. 

To support that type of Luxury found on the Strip, you need a lot of losers willing to give it up, over and over again.",UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,7,8,2,j6_KUcMlP7Yx2Lu2pkKJ4w

But, this little Jewish deli (run by Asians) serves it up hangover style! $5 for an egg, bacon & cheese sammie - on kaiser roll or bagel, with your choice of beverage. They also do the standard breakfast thing, as does the cafe next to it, but they change $9! The service is really slow for a place that's just a to go cafe, which makes it hard when you are swooning and in need of caffeine and grease. It is what hits the spot though for sure!",vgwdQ0fpDZdoTidJuwYq7w,4,3,4,Ob5Kp2nrVmBKfbK952_FGw

The sauce and sauerkraut were awesome, and the bread was beautifully grilled. There was a ton of pastrami too - I wish they actually gave a little more bread for the sandwich.

It's self service - you order at the counter, pay, then pick up your food. All in all, highly recommended for a casual lunch bite, although fairly pricey for what you get (everything in Vegas is pricey).",vZ60gN0Tx-sDhTOUh9EWMQ,0,0,4,YInIqj8NUqmgBpAQ11ullQ

I chose the matzo ball soup and it reminded me of a light ramen soup that was light on the salt. My taste buds were thankful for the light flavor and did not over power the palette.
