I'd rate them higher if it wasn't for the fact that ordering online was a huge issue.  Originally, my friend and I called the restaurant to place an order, and they answered and said that we had to do it online so we hung up went to the website and tried to find where to place an order but could not find it on the website. Turns out they had multiple different website so it was hard to know which one to place an order on. Finally my friend and I found the one where you could place an order and when we tried to place an order, we kept getting bounced back.  We tried to place an order for probably at least 20 minutes! Out of frustration we called the restaurant and spoke with someone and they ended up having to just take our order over the phone. So basically we wasted 20 minutes when we could've placed it over the phone in the first place! After we ordered the food it didn't take them too long to deliver it, probably about 20 minutes. The food was pretty good and the pitas were pretty good-sized! I say your best bet is to just go into the restaurant instead of trying to order on their website.",E3LyTOlYe0KmB25bqKAWlw,1,1,3,G23FFfg7sJK4D7RLpOnNYg

Ordered the Gyro - fork style (salad) with double meat.  This is not my normal order so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I got the mix of iceberg/romaine/spinach, tomatoes, cheese and caesar dressing, tzatzike sauce on the side.  Exactly like a salad I get at a greek restaurant here in town (instead of it being a chicken caesar, it is a gyro caesar.  For about 1/2 the price at the greek restaurant this was very comparable and very delicious.

I have yet to have a bad meal there and like every other time I have been there, the person and/or people behind the counter are always friendly, courteous and customer service orientated.

A similar place that serve pita as well, cost me $8, comes with a skewer of grilled chicken breast, side salad and pita with Txatziki sauce. With an additional $2.50 for a combo, it comes with fried or rice and a drink. Food was super yummy at this other place.

Quick tip: Monday through Friday between 5 Pm to 7 PM, it's happy hour which is buy 3 pitas, get 1 free. And also, DOUBLE MEAT FOR 99 cents. 

It's honestly my go to place for quick, yet relatively healthy food. One of the beauties of this place is that you can choose what vegetables you want and the save you want. 

I normally get the Philly on wheat pita with the peppers, mushrooms and onions grilled with it. This may sound odd, but I usually get teriyaki sauce on my Philly and it's amazing.

You order your choice of meat first then move to the end of the counter to customize your pita while they cook the meat on a grill in front of you. I saw the comparison to Subway in other reviews and in my opinion the only comparison is perhaps the business model (the concept of customizing your food). The quality however is not comparable. I don't have anything against Subway, but based on my experience with both restaurants, Pita Pit exceeds in quality of ingredients, customer service, and cleanliness.

2028102,2016-01-06,4,eY98EH_PHGnJVaJ7t2UpoQ,"Not bad at all. I may have to work this place in to my regular rotation.
As other reviewers have mentioned, this place is like Subway/Qdoba.
You pick your base protein, and everything else is pretty much customizable. You choose between white or wheat pitas, and you have a wide choice of add-ons, even some Mediterranean stuff such as hummus . Avocado spread does not carry an extra charge. And there are a wide range of sauces.
Being a ""healthy"" joint, they also carry a lot of smoothies. I question how healthy smoothies really are, but that's another debate. Smoothies are the expensive items on their menu.
Today was my most recent visit. I had the Chicken Souvlaki with a Mango Tango smoothie. The price point for the pita seems to be slightly less than most of Subway's footlong sandwiches, which is awesome since I think the food is much better than Subway anyways. And with the Yelp check-in 10% off coupon, this was a great deal. I spent just under $11 before tip.
As far as how healthy this place is, well, that's entirely dependent on your self-control. If you eat your pita straight as it is, then yes, it's healthy. But if you have to have potato chips and cookies, and you have to drench your pita with dressing and sauce, then you've just defeated the purpose of eating healthy. That being said, even if your goal isn't to eat healthily, this place is still a tasty option to change things up once in a while.",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,4,4,4,nhZapezP-Fq5sIbt-5nlGQ

I was visiting a girlfriend, we didn't want pizza or Chinese, so our options were limited. We Yelp-ed and finally stumbled upon the Pita Pit at 9:15. The website said that they delivered until 10p, so we thought we were all set.

Ordering online was a real process- it seems as though they have a few different websites and not all of them lead to online orders. After 10 very frustrating minutes trying to navigate them online, we finally called the store, who told us that they didn't take telephone orders, only online ones. 

Ok, back to the website! We FINALLY got to the right one, placed our order, entered all of the information, and clicked ""complete my order"" at 9:38, only to get an error message saying that they were no longer taking orders for delivery. What?!?! It isn't 10pm yet!!

We called Pita Pit and a very nice employee named Paul apologized for the glitch and said that was an issue that someone else had reported- the website cutting off orders before 10p. He took our order over the telephone and said that he would make sure we got our food and look into the website issue.

Our order arrived shortly, and we were starving. My friend got the Chicken Slouvakki (sp), and I got the Chicken Crave. We also got an order of pita and hummus to share. The pita was just average. Barely warm and kind of tough. The worst for me was my Chicken Crave. It was FULL of onions- the first bite I took was ALL onion! I definitely didn't expect that. I ended up having to unwrap it and try to pick out some of the onions because they were so overwhelming. It also didn't have much sauce on it, so it was a bit dry.

Between the headache ordering and the extra oniony pita.. I don't know if I'm inclined to try Pita Pit again.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,5,1,2,d8s39zAhhKgoPho6Rwcx_g

1. You go to the register and order the meat you like. They have lots of options, even vegetarian options. I've had the chicken souvlaki, which is Mediterranean seasoned chicken and falafel, which is ground chickpeas/spices rolled into fritters and deep fried. Both have been so flavorful. 
2. Then you head to the vegetable station while your meat cooks. You have the option of a wheat or white pita. They pack your pita full with whatever veggies and sauce you like. 
3. Once the meat is cooked, they roll it all up and you're done!! 

The employees are super nice and help you if you're undecided or if you're new to the place. They have a rewards card where it's a point for every dollar you spend.

So anywhooo!  I went there, and I got a chicken pita, and got my hubby the Philly steak pita.  It's like subway sandwich, they have so many toppings, and sauces, it was so hard to choose what topping to put on it.  Our pita's were so big, she couldn't hardly close it.  All I know is it's worth the $8.00!  We loved our pita's there big enough for 2 people, or eat half for lunch and half for dinner.

I got my usual grilled chicken pita.  The order taker told the sandwich maker to throw a chicken, and instead of doing it then going back to reorganizing the station (which makes sense cause it takes some time for the chicken to heat) she finished what she was doing first. I then  asked her to change her gloves because I'm very sensitive to onions and peppers which she had been handling. She did it but wasn't very happy about it. 

I guess the new thing they do is steam the pita. She did it before I could stop her. I asked her to use a new unsteamed pita which totally annoyed her. Then we had to wait longer for the chicken to finish. The iceberg lettuce was kind of bitter because it was mostly yellow. Also I'm not liking the slices of cheese. What happened to shredded cheese? Anyways the experience sucked and my pita wasn't very good. I only ate half of it and threw the rest away. I guess I will have to live off my memories.",RFObi04WoSb-CgKL2GN5ww,0,0,1,lhy_oSogm6-xyiPcD32YMg
