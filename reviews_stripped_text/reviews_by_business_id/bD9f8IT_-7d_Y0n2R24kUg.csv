I ordered surf and turf (~$60), and lobster was ok, and they screwed my steak THREE TIMES!!!  This place suppose to be upscale, but felt cheap.  I don't know, felt expensive for no reason.  Thank GOD my company paid for the meal.  I think big mac would've tasted better.  Only reason i gave it two stars is when they messed up my steak for third time, they gave me free drinks.",mkD0HHJV6K7709FTxUuVnw,1,0,2,WQoOIjFyJb-pRleOdj9DCQ

The food was mediocre and according to the people I was with, the steaks were bland and not the right cut or cook.  Their food is not worthed! For a supposed upscale dimly lit dinning, this place is bland. Don't waste your time or money here... except for their dessert! Which you can always get to GO.",-WNUoT-OsSqkaseEh5k_sg,0,0,2,V_KEJbn_YTSf37EvnJgeRQ

She was super nice.  We ordered fried zucchini as an appetizer and it was amazing.  This is the one of the few places that I have ever been to that cooked my steak perfect, Med Rare warm on the inside.  The crab was wonderful and the desert, forget about it.  We loved it so much that we decided to eat here two nights in a row.  Wonderful, expensive but wonderful.",B5XfyhnUdjm8xXp4LKTe-Q,1,0,5,cl6Ap4gUlflPtWnBNoJiyw
