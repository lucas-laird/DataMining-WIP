64197,2016-04-08,1,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"Was craving a good Gyro and after a Yelp search decided on this place! The reviews do not lie, one of the best Gyro's I've had in a long time! Got the Big Fat special which includes a Big Fat Gyro, fries (which I upgraded to greek fries for a small upcharge) and a regular fountain soda. Total came out to about $12 which is not bad because the Gyro was definitely big, fat, delicious! The fries were also very good - nice and hot on the inside, crispy on the outside, just like good fries should be. Highly recommend and will come back again next time I have a craving.",WptCfZ_h6pdnkBJx4ha8Aw,1,0,4,llwWY1EqsiLZTA_nY_ULqA

Yassou Greek Grill Caf√© is my favorite little Greek restaurant in Las Vegas.  This unassuming restaurant serves up some of the most delicious Greek food in town.  My favorite is their Chicken Souvlaki platter.  It is served with two skewers of savory, tender chicken and comes with a small salad, buttery, lemon rice, warm, fresh pita bread and cool and creamy Tzatziki sauce this meal is very filling.

Their menu has all the standard Greek favorites such as Gyros, Spanakopita, and Dolmades. Other notable menu items are the Greek Fries served crispy and hot served with spices and feta cheese. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. The one drawback is the parking lot is small and hard to navigate any vehicle larger than a Mini Cooper. Yassou Greek Grill Caf√© is located at 7871 W.

449138,2012-04-05,0,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"Wow this is probably the best service I have received from any restaurant in Las Vegas. While it's hard to find decent Greek food in town, I would have to say that this is probably #2 on my list. Plus they still accommodated us when we showed up 15 mins prior to closing. There were a couple items that prevented it from getting a 5-star rating. So let's break down the food. 

A great way to help judge a Greek restaurant is by ordering their hummus and we did just that. They provided quite a bit of pita and croutons for you to dip in your hummus, unfortunately the hummus had no flavor. There was no lemon zest or taste of olive oil that normally comes through at other places. Heck I'm not much of a salt person and even I thought it needed some sodium. 

Next up, we had their Greek fries covered in Greek seasoning, feta and parsley...I thoroughly enjoyed these. These would be so good with a gyro!

Now the main dishes - Your steak souvlaki was overcooked and tough to chew. Your chicken souvlaki was the savior as the robust flavors bursted in my mouth. Ah yes! Your lamb was tender and flavorful. Surprisingly it wasn't very greasy either.  Your tzatziki sauce wasn't as thick and tart as other places. I could swear it tasted more like sour cream than Greek yogurt, but whatever, it was still good. The rice was instant rice which was ok but I love me some homemade rice. The salad was good, mine just had a bit too much dressing.

The owner is a great guy and constantly checked on us to make sure we were satisfied with the food. Though it seems pricey, I thought for 3 people it was a great deal especially all the food we ate.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,0,0,4,j1S3Y18R1wlRE4oJTP0SvQ

Today I had the Calamari under the Greek Plates section of the menu. It was the best calamari I have ever had, and I have had a lot of calamari in my lifetime. The plate was generous for the price; with salad, rice, and the fluffiest pita bread I have ever had surrounding. 

The sauce that was also provided with the Calamari plate would be a world wide phenomenon if it was ever bottled and sold. I can't quite pinpoint all the flavors in it, which leads me to believe it is something special. All I can tell you is that you must try it for yourself and be enthralled in its zesty goodness as I was today. 

The place is very well kept and clean with table clothes and sturdy chairs. It's as authentic as you can imagine. With authentic Greek Coffee in their Espresso Bar, Gyros, Hummus, Pita Sandwiches, and all sorts of authentic sounding appetizers and plates. They even have imported Greek Olive Oil and Greek Coffee Grounds for purchase. 

The service was beyond excellent and as I was standing by the cashier to pay for my meal, I read a framed article about the place. It was then I realized that I was served by the owner himself and his family. 

It was a wonderful experience and I am now determined on completing all of the menu.",o8mSOr_TZVRXP4p6Q6P8Dg,1,1,5,xhR-o-mYoiV7C9sRgiOpOw

I should warn new-comers, they don't make falafels. According to the owner (who is a nice man that loves his restaurant), falafels are Mediterranean, but not Greek. He only serves strictly Greek food. At first I wasn't sure about the place, because of that, but it helped me try new foods that I probably wouldn't have given the chance otherwise.

We have put up with the high prices (2 plates & 1 drink always seem to come out to $20+) & super long wait time, (for a FAST food place) but today was the worst.  In order to avoid waiting the usual 15+ minutes I called ahead.  When my husband paid, the cashier got the order wrong that had been given over the phone.  My husband had to correct her a few times in the same transaction.  We thought it was strange we were not given a receipt or a table number.  Over the phone they had told us it would be ready in 10 min but it took 19.  We were once again waiting.  Also, over the phone I had said I was calling in advance to eat there, yet they set up our food in to go boxes - but didn't give us a bag...I don't understand the logic there.  When we got the food both to go boxes had smeared food marks on them - looked very unsanitary & unprofessional, and the order was wrong STILL.  We had been charged $2 for the extra rice my hubby ordered, but it appeared that they simply substituted his salad for a small amount of rice because the salad was missing altogether!  To make it right, they quickly (for once) made a salad to go, but even THAT box had smears of food or whatever on it.  GROSS!

The ambiance isn't great, but let's be honest-- few places in Vegas give you that. If you're in Vegas, you aren't there for the scenery. So get over it.

I digress. Back to the food, oh God the food. The gyros are whopping fistfuls of juicy, perfectly seasoned delight. The spanakopita is just flaky enough to give you the feeling that you're eating something healthy-- but it's Greek, so you're not. The steak souvlaki..... sorry, just choked on my own drool. Perfectly tender, marinated, I'll even lick the skewers those beautiful chunks of meat are served on.

The food is delicious. My mom had the Tuna Mykonos Pita, I had the Super Lemon Herb Steak Pita & we shared the Greek Fries. Mom loved her super chunky, lemony albacore tuna pita with tomatoes and onions and the magical sauce. Lol. I also had the same condiments and veggies but mine came with seasoned, tender steak bites. The herb and feta cheese-topped fries were crispy and were a great pair to our pitas.

The ambiance of the place is casual and I would expect it to be super packed around rush hour cause it's not a very huge place.

1678707,2018-05-13,1,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"We have been going to Yassou for at least 10 years and have always loved it (and still do). However if today were our first visit I am not sure how we would have felt. First things first the cashier (I believe her name is Sara) was somewhat rude. When she informed my wife that the red caviar spread was not available she rushed my wife on making a decision on which sauce she wanted extra of. This may have been acceptable if there was a line but we were the only ones ordering. Christian was working hard on the line so I am not sure if he was aware of the shape that the restaurant was in, once again if this was our first time we would have a really bad perception of Yassou.

During our dinner there was another woman cleaning, not a bad thing but the mop water was so strong with bleach that it somewhat interfered with our meal. There were two couples that came in after us and each had a less than stellar experience. The older couple seemed to be almost harassed for asking for an extra plate while the young family seemed to get attitude for requesting the fries and pita they ordered. 

We have been avid visitors of Yassou and have recommended it over the other Greek restaurants in town so it was sad to see today be so off. Christian and his family work hard to make it a great experience and I commend him for having such an authentic and delicious restaurant. Maybe there was something in the air or everyone was just way over stressed but today was really just not a good day at Yassou.

All the meats they serve here are amazing, and but what really blew the meal out of the water was the rice pilaf!! 

Since our first visit, my boyfriend and I have since come up with our regular order; we each get a Yassou Gyro, an order of rice to share, a couple sodas, and extra tzatziki sauce.

As for taste, no it's probably not the best I have ever had, but for me, I order the chicken souvlaki plate or greek salad with chicken and I am happy with it consistently. The pita on the salad is very buttery and I believe fried, so not exactly the healthiest, but good. The dressing is excellent and I always ask for it on the side since they tend to go heavy on the dressing. It somehow always seems to be mixed in every time, but when I ask them about it, they say it's the marinade from the chicken that gives it that taste or feel that the dressing was still mixed it, but they say it wasn't. The people working there know us by face now and it always seems to be the same people working, I know the owner is always there, but the other guy might be his son? He is always there too. 

The chicken and rice soup is really yummy but sometimes they don't have it, especially over the summer. My hubby orders the steak skewers or gyro and isn't as impressed with this place as I am.

The location was easy enough to find. I ended up parking in the McDonalds parking lot and walking next door. The decor is very nice with a few tables outside for outdoor dining during the warmer months.

Greek Fries
Standard fries with feta cheese and some chopped parsley. Given the price difference between Greek fries and American fries being 50cents more i would have gotten the standard fries. There just wasnt enough feta or herbs to enhance the fries and make them tastes different or Greek for that matter.

Chicken Souvalaki
Overall excellent, the side salad was fresh and crispy, could have done with a few more olives. The Pita bread is EXCELLENT soft and chewy very nice texture. Excellent rice pilaf, buttery with a fresh lemonly taste. Chicken was cooked to perfection, nicely flavored and still juicy in the middle.

The lunch specials are well-priced and delicious- for $10/each we got a gyro (the big fat for him, the lemon chicken special for me), with greek fries and a drink. Not bad at all, and portions are huge. Price for value is excellent.

Both gyros were delish, but i'm more a fan of the traditional gyro meat rather than the chicken, though it was good to see a healthier option on the menu. Worth a try, at the very least.
Greek fries are the bomb- regular fries with feta, and maybe some garlic?, and parsley. Delicious. And for a take out order, they are carefully wrapped so as not to displace any of the plentiful crumbly cheese. Smart thinking!

Love how the owner himself is working alongside the employees to make and fill the orders- great sign and also underscores the quality you can expect here.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,0,4,qEhGoNuiUuZcxtsS2DwwIw

Also ordered a side of the dolmades (stuffed grape leaves).  Unlike most places that serve the oily canned meatless variety, these are homemade with ground beef.

Generally speaking, I'm not going to go out of my way to eat here.  I think there are better Greek/Mediterranean places at about the same price-point...and most of them are sit down places with more comfortable seating. 

The gyros are solid here...they do their chicken gyros better than average...nothing else telling my stomach to tell my brain to come back here though.

The Greek salad is awesome! The rice is to die for! The pita bread is so good too.
This is a great family owned and run restaurant and the prices are awesome considering the amount of food and quality you get. Most plates are $8- $9.

Uses Kronos gyro meat which I like better than even homemade ones I've had and they must sell enough that Pitts are fresh. However, I wouldn't get a Greek salad or any of the sides like tiramusalata etc. I ordered a few because I love all those sides. They were very disappointing. Grape leaves were so so (there is one place that has by far the best in town). I was told once a week they make their own, but the ones I had tasted like the canned ones, which are fine but not what I was hoping for in a mom and pop place. Greek food is tough in Vegas, which is why it's generally first stop when I go home.

They really have a way with adding flavor with natural ingredients such as yogurt, parsley, lemon, etc. I'm thrilled this place is down the street from us, they are really tasty! 

I ordered the super lemon herb chicken pita. It was a nice big freshly homemade pita stuffed silly with grilled lemon herb chicken and lettuce, also dolloped with a good amount of their creamy yogurt sauce. Squirt some lemon on that baby and eat to your heart's content. It is really refreshing and flavorful! I was completely satisfied and I also didn't feel guilty or overstuffed. Just perfect! 

My boyfriend ordered the steak souvlaki combo which comes with a side of greek salad and also rice pilaf. We really enjoyed this dish! The steak was cooked perfectly tender and the seasoning was just right to where you can still really enjoy the flavor of the meat. The rice pilaf was super flavorful and addicting. Also the salad had a super light dressing that didn't overpower the flavor of the meal at all. Everything went together very well. 

The greek fries were not my favorite. I'm sure it's because we ordered them to-go and by the time we got home they were soggy. But they were also lacking feta, parsley and seasoning. 

Other than that, the super lemon chicken herb pita is a winner! I can't wait to try their other pitas.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,7,3,5,MWr9E9-wY5co5xXIloRRWA

For that they lost a star.) 

My bf and I came in here and ordered the big fat gyro and the super lemon steak pita. The onions are really sharp and give you that extra crunch to your pita. Pair that with the Greek fries and you're set for an extra delicious lunch. The fries are exactly what you want. Crispy and lightly dusted with fresh parley and feta cheese. Some places can over do it. My dish was great but it was falling apart (which is why I needed the extra pita). It fell on my dish and suddenly I was full. My bf really enjoyed his meal. He typically orders his gyro without any lettuce. I keep all the good stuff in. It's a perfect hearty rainbow meal.

3015069,2010-05-16,1,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"After trying a drive-thru greek stop and a couple others on Sahara, we decided to hop on to Charleston and give this place a try.  It looks so fresh and inviting in the building it's in, and because it's one of those places that you would normally drive by on a regular day, I wanted to see if it was any good.

My husband is the Greek food lover, while I am just so-so on it.  We ordered a lot--the stuffed grape leaves, two big gyros, some dessert, seasoned fries, pita bread and hummus.  Everything tasted great--the gyro was in this soft, yummy pita with some feta cheese and veggies.  The meat was really good, too.  Nicely seasoned.  The hummus was my favorite, and I had to order extra bread to finish it off.  I didn't eat the grape leaves but my husband said it was really good and had a strong herbal flavor to them.  They made this honey pastry cake and it was mildly sweet and sticky.  

Overall, the food was great for a Greek stop and we frequent that place when we are in the mood for that kind of food.  The owner is there working once in awhile, and his son is there all the time.  Having a family work the business is a great sight to see, and ensures for me that they care about their food and therefore the quality there will always be good.

If you like Greek, you should give this place a shot and see if you become addicted to it or not.  Lots of yelpers are fans, and although the good was great, I'm not a total fan.  For me to give four stars it has to haunt me in my dreams.  Still, great food.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,2,3,Jz5GcBivjZUEFDV5p1hYVw

**2016 YELP 100 LV CHALLENGE #1** 

SO I thought I had tasted the best Greek cafe mom & pop shop, but w/ the new year I have found another GEM in Las Vegas!! Although it is a bit far I am willing to drive the distance! We even saw the owner working his but off in the kitchen which you know that the food is being prepared at it's best!! 

The staff are SUPER HAPPY all the time it seems & enjoy what they do. You can definitely see it in the food. You order your food at the redigister & pay then they bring out the food to your table.

The restaraunt is nice & big w/ outdoor seating as well. One thing that I LOVED was that it was SPACIOUS & clean cut... not too much decoration clutter everywhere. The high ceilings also a plus. The kitchen is an OPEN kitchen so you can see all of your food being cooked & you get all of the yummy smell of the food being prepared as well. One more thing was how CLEAN the freaken bathrooms were. 

BIG FAT SPECIAL W/ FRIES & SODA $10.59 - the flame broiled beef & lamb is something I don't usually get but that's an automatic meat that comes w/ the big fat special.... I be so SURPRISED at how DERICIOUS the darn meat was & how much meat came in the gryo! You can make another gyro out of it. 
SMALL GREEK SALAD $3.99 - I will have to say this was the least of my favorite.... I like my dressing a little more salty & acidic but this one was more olive oil than I would want. Still protiom wise it was pretty big for a small salad.

HUMMUS $4.99 - absolutely PERFECT flavor!!!! Just the right amount of garlic & oil w/ citrus... the pita bread was warm & fluffy

MEDITERRANEAN PIZZA W/CKN $8.99 - they use a 9"" flat bread & make a pizza out of it! The ratios were all EVEN! Chicken pieces in every bite... an OCD person's dream pizza ahhahaha",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,8,9,5,GrC5cWAH0jNnKurvyggzSg

Much more charming to have your meal indoors.  Cultural music is played, sorta gives the feel.  Their walls are white and blue as you would find iconic in Greece.  Although it was extremely warm walking in, they turned on the a.c. and it cooled up pretty quickly.

Yassou is busy during lunch hour, and they do work fast.  I saw them brooming up under tables inside and outside, cleaning off tables as guests were through.  Not so spic and span, but average dining areas.  It's great that they have outdoor seating especially right now in November afternoons, Vegas still has pleasantly warm weather, sunny and blue skies.

I'll give yay points for their food being tasty.  We ordered Greek pasta with gyro (spaghetti with brown butter imported mizithra cheese) and a Gyro plate.  They're winners; again a lot of food on one plate and average prices.  Cannot get over their yellow rice - so yummy!!!",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,33,33,4,ZSDCdjT-kyjwTlzBLPfUTg

We found this gem because it is located next to Hottie Hair Salon.  We came during lunch last week and the place was BOOMING!

We had to pile into a line that was poking out the door.  Every table was taken (except for outside) and we were worried that we wouldn't be able to find a table big enough to accommodate our party of five.  Luckily, we came a bit later than noon.  By the time it was our turn to order, the tables had cleared out some and we were able to grab a seat.

I was torn on what to get, but I was kind of hungry so instead of opting for the ""My Big Fat Gyro"" which comes with fries and a drink, I ordered the ""Gryo Plate.""  The plate came with beef and lamb, greek salad, rice, pita bread and tzatziki sauce.

It took about 10 minutes for our food to come, but the sign at the counter says to please allow 15 minutes.   At this time I was so hungry that I grabbed a piece of pita, put some meat in it and tzatziki sauce.  I took a bite and I couldn't help but be startled by what I did next.  I uncontrollably said ""WOW!""  I had surprised myself when I did that, but it really was that good.

The food was fresh and delicious.  The plate offers very large portions.  I felt like I got a bargain for the price that I paid.

The employees were efficient and friendly.  The place was really busy and I could TASTE why.  Next time I come I am getting the ""My Big Fat Gryo"" special with american fries and a drink.

I had to drench it in tzatiki to make it somewhat enjoyable. The fries were hard--not crispy but hard and there was zero flavor as well which is hard to imagine.

First and foremost the staff and atmosphere is great.  The cashier who is there almost everyday and is most likely a member of the family, is fluent in Greek.  One of my friends is studying the language and soon found himself being schooled by the cashier.

The food is quite good and I have had many items on the menu.  I still prefer Market Grills Gyros because you have the option of hummus over the normal spread.  It is also slightly more expensive then market grill so be prepared for that.  But I think the experience here is more authentic.",cMZVJdi_fKG7rp1no_2ZvA,1,0,5,SEsafsDyUGqIieFjZ9k71g

I consider this place to be far superior to Paymon's and all the other Americanized versions of Greek food that you can find here in town.  As for Lapriel H., that yelped about the man behind the counter was a Will Farrell look-a-like, etc. etc....................if you had read the literature on the wall, you'd have noticed that the man you're referring to is the owner, originally from Cyprus,  and  he spends 14 hours a day there both cooking and interacting with the patrons.

~I recommend the Big Fat Gyro.......oh my, it's AMAZING!  It's a mixture of lamb and  beef and the meat is sooooooo tender!  The veggies are fresh and crisp and the feta is of a good quality!  The size of this thing resembles its name.......BIG & FAT!
~The Greek fries are fantastic..........a taste of lemon, parsley, salt and feta!
~And lastly, the Baklava.........what!!!!!!  I compare every single piece of Baklava that I eat to my mother's, who in my opinion, still makes the very best, but this was fantastic in so many different ways!  For those people who like Baklava for its traditional flakiness........this will satisfy your taste buds but with quite a twist.  It's covered with a honey sauce that makes it mushy to just the right degree......almost a cake like texture.  I can't describe it, can't put it into words.....
~It's a casual, near fast food type place with a very homey atmosphere!

After the disaster that is the Mad Greek, I was afraid I would be inclined to allow my distaste to taint my review of Yassou, so I made sure to try it a couple of times.

Don't ask me to remember the names of my orders, other than there's always a gyro and usually some dolmades. What I do remember is that they always put my Tzatziki sauce at the side. Don't get me wrong, I love the stuff, just not always slathered on like they do at some places.

The gyro was really good, with the perfect combination of ingredients so you could enjoy each bite, with sauce or without.

The dolmades are always wonderful - just knowing they're hand made is a huge plus n my book.

I am so looking forward to the festival next month, I hope the food there is as good as Yassou does it, or better even.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,1,1,4,MCrzZWFWy318Pn3dNKy8ww

It also reminded me of my time spent at the Wine Spectator Restaurant at The Culinary Institute of America at Greystone where the menu items we made covered flavors from the Mediterranean Regions, from Paella, Moussaka, Dolmades, Kofta, and Skordalia, to Avgolemono, Lavash, Taramosalatta, Spanokopita, and Baklava we did a little of everything. Also taking Cooking courses with Mediterranean food authority and chef Joyce Goldstein was a great bonus.

Wifey's not as big as a fan as I am, so I kinda had to sorta beg and plead and twist her arm to check out Yassou Greek Grill Cafe since we were close by...(It worked!)
Yassou was a good find! Perusing the menu, I see Taramosalatta, a dip made from cured fish roe, potatoes, lemon juice and olive oil. I love that stuff and I order it as a starter.""Whoa!?!?!? you even pronounced it correctly!?!?! Great choice!"" The guy behind the register says with a surprised look...(Refer to above paragraph)

We also shared a Lemon Herb Chicken Pita and a Souvlaki Combo. The Taramosalatta arrives and we dig in. Yassou's version was okay, but I'm used to a stronger taste of the cured roe, and I didn't really taste the potato in there, more like overkill on the olive oil. Every bite of the pita was delicious as was the combo, but the beef skewer was a tad on the dry side. Overall, a solid meal, and I still have to try out a few other spots that were highly yelped (Paymon's, Zaytoon, Parsley, Great Greek, etc.) ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,7,4,3,vhnsXxEO_rpYW_cIe4DcMw

The gyro sandwich is very generously stuffed with lamb and pork.  The french fries are meh.  The Greek fries are not quite right, either.  But get the hummus and pita instead, which is much better than the grocery store variety (if you've been getting by on that kind.)  The baklava is quite nice, rich, and not too sweet, but really sticky--in a nice way.  Try the sparking Greek water.

Call ahead and order for pick up.  It is much better than waiting, if you're going to take out (the best way to do here).

Although I've lived in the area for over thirty years and they have been open for seven, this was the first time I walked in the door (due to the yelp reviews I read on my phone). The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars, was that it looked like my home office at tax time (a bit unorganized and cluttered) with half of the chairs upside down on the tables in the middle of the afternoon.  The service was friendly, and was told that they get very busy at lunch time.

The food was superb.  It was the best Greek food I've tasted since I left Chicago thirty years ago.  The dolmodes (thank goodness not vegan) had it's ground lamb and rice spiced to perfection, and was treated to love in its lemon sauce.  The spanikopita was probably the best I have ever tasted, with its filo dough layered and flaky, and very pleasantly spiced.

My boss introduced me to this place for lunch one day and when I tried I just couldn't get enough. She always orders me the Chicken skewer plate which comes with 2 skewers, rice, Greek salad, pita bread, and hummus. There's not one thing I don't like from that meal-- first off, the chicken is so juicy and flavorful, the rice pairs so well with the chicken, Greek salad is my favorite, and you can never go wrong with pita and hummus. Not only is the food delicious but they aren't greedy with their portions either-- it's a lot of food on that plate and I always end my meal with a happy tummy. I want to try more things on the menu but that chicken skewer plate is sooo good I feel like I just can't steer away from it.

It's a smaller place and not fancy, but it is VERY clean and is quite attractive.  The only negative is that they close rather early for my tastes (around 8 PM), and I really like to eat around 9 on weekends.

Good Greek food right off of Charleston near Summerlin.  Lots of folks visit, can tell you're in the affluent part of town because of all the cars parked outside!  Our lowly Acura was parked between a new BMW and a Mercedes coupe.  Dang did that make me feel poor.  Oh well, suck it rich people I can eat at Yassou too!

Upon entering the restaurant, it definitely reminds you of the diner from that movie ""My Fat Greek Wedding"".  White & blue dually represented!  Nice little family run place.  Wasn't particularly busy in the place that day, noticed that lots of folks were doing take-out, or picking up large catering trays for glitzy parties.  

Menu is displayed prominently on huge boards right above the service counter.  Kinda hard to miss!  Menu was varied, went from traditional Greek fare to items of a more modern palette.  We of course, stuck with what the Greeks know.  And what they know is pretty darn tasty.

Throw the spanakopita, dolmades, and hummus aside...show me the meat!  Although I'm sure those items on the menu are probably pretty good, I was here for some carnivorous action.

The wifey and I went for the Souvlaki Combo - one beef and one chicken skewer marinated in the house lemon herbs & spices.  Our plates came with a Greek salad, rice pilaf, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce.  Overall the plate was good.  The skewers were a nice serving, and you could definitely taste the lemon and herbs throughout.  My beef skewer was juicy, but the chicken skewer was a little dry probably because it was breast meat (which tends to dry out).  The Greek salad was good with feta, tomato, cucumber, olives, and lots of red onion (which the wifey didn't really like), topped with their house vinaigrette.  Tasty.  Pita bread and the tzatziki sauce was good too, pita being warm and soft, with the tzatziki being a good complement for dipping things in to.  I wasn't a fan of the rice pilaf though, it didn't do much for me.  It's probably because I'm more of a sticky rice kinda guy.  Overall a decent plate.

What I really should have ordered was what our kids ordered.  I almost wanted to switch halfway though our meal!  They got the popular My Big Fat Gyro - gyro sandwich with flame broiled sliced beef & lamb, feta cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and tzatziki sauce.  Along with a large order of Greek fries - fries with herbs & spices, and feta cheese.  This stuff was delish!  The thin sliced beef with the lamb, all combined into that gyro made a wonderful dish.  Was hard to put down after a few bites!  I will definitely have this instead the next time I visit Yassou.  

Prices were kinda on the high side for me (I'm a cheapie eater) but I guess if you want quality food you gotta pay for it.  Our plates were about $9 each, and the gyros were a tad over $7.  Fries were separate, and cost us another $3 or so.  Servings were generous though.  On the plus side, they serve Coca-Cola!  Figure it would have been Pepsi since of the blue motif and all.

The restaurant has two different seating sections, one is in the restaurant, but there is another area on the outside in more of a patio setting.  Nice if the weather is good outside, or if you have a large party of folks with you.

Their hummus, gyro, saganaki, all the best! But besides the food the owners are super friendly and nice. We were referred by Pete and while we were there all we saw was him interacting with customers, cooking, helping everyone out, and working hard! For me personally besides the food, good customer service is very important to me. I love small businesses and I prefer going to a family owned place over a chain restaurant. My mom works at a local Walgreen's and had Pete as a customer who told her about his store and that's how we ended up learning about it.

If you haven't been yet, go RIGHT NOW and get one, maybe two!  The meat is tender and packed with flavor!  The pita is so soft and fluffy. And the tzatziki sauce is amazing!  Yum, yum, yummy!

4155449,2011-01-22,0,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"IMO this is one of the very best Greeks I have ever been to, and I've been to plenty in England and here in Vegas.  Here's what I think makes it stand out:

1) It's a family run business with the owner always on hand to make sure the quality stays perfect and consistent.  Everybody we have dealt with there has been super friendly and makes us feel at home.

2) I know, it's really all about the food.  Well everything we've had here has been great:  

Everything is made to order, so when you get the chicken or steak kabob, it's not been sitting around then zapped in the microwave like some places I've been to, instead it's cooked perfectly on the grill, the chicken moist and tasty (I recommend you squeeze a bit of extra lemon on it for a final taste burst), the steak unbelievably tender and cooked about medium rare for a fantastic juicy chunk of meat you'd be happy to find in your best steak house.  The donner kebab is nicely browned on the outside and very tasty; I've been to far too many places where they don't make the effort to brown it before slicing it off, it makes a huge difference to the taste when it's done right.  The rice is super moist and flavorful, I imagine they are cooking it in some sort of broth.  The side salad on the plate has a nice amount of dressing and a good variety of feta, olives (but only a couple), cucumber and onion to go with the lettuce.  The pitas are not home made (there are hundreds of them on display in packages) but they are very yummy, more doughy than the usual thin ones.  If I had one recommendation I'd like the option to have them warmed on the grill.

I think the prices are extremely reasonable considering the large portion size.

Friendly family run business, reasonable prices, great food.  We can't wait to go back.",L4K7pl3gL9ZwJcIX--L3-g,1,0,5,MBWVlo2-_5jqmJV-TTMKaA

I went here for lunch with a bunch of other ladies for a meetup group last Sunday. Whoever got there first was to find seating for all of us to sit together. There were 14 of us. My friend and I were the first to arrive, so took a look around and saw that there are three options for seating. Most people sit inside which is the same place as where you order (at the counter). But they also have an outdoor patio and a separate dining room enclosed in glass which was not open. So I asked if we could all sit in that room and they said sure and opened it up for us.

We were able to get about 4 tables put together where we all sat in a row on each side of the tables and on the ends. They brought everyone's order out to us in a reasonably consistent time. We didn't wait too long for the food either. No one had any problems with their order as far as I could tell and we had a great time with great food. Lots of the ladies were saying the food was very good.

Personally, I ordered the Super Lemon Chicken Pita. It is the larger of the two Lemon Chicken Pitas but not much more money that the smaller one. It was delicious. I forgot to tell them no onions, so I picked off the slices of red onion. I was glad they were not chopped fine!

When we left, they were loading up a van for a big delivery of food. I was impressed that they handled all of us unexpectedly at the same time they were preparing a catering job. And just as they did with us, they brought the food out to the van quickly with several people carrying things out.

We always order the ""My Big Fat Gyro"" or the Gyro Plate. So much meat! I'd recommend one of these your first visit because I believe you can soundly judge a Greek joint by its gyro. 

The plate is fun, but the gyro wrap is hands down the best beast you'll wrangle during your work week. They are massive. And I can't believe I'm saying this since I know it's an abomination, but sometimes I find myself picking out slices of meat there's just so much. Seriously, I have to prepare before ingestion, like putting down newspaper or eating outside near the hose. My husband can go to town on it without much of a mess, but he has man hands and a man mouth. 

The traditional gyro meat is a shavers gift--how gyros or shawarma should come off (if you ask a foreigner like me), consistent like meatloaf. I'm always prepared to get one bad piece, just one. Maybe a piece of fat or ligament, but nope, hasn't happened yet.

I was immediately greeted by a friendly staff member who explained what the Greek Fries were and the combos and stuff. The Greek Fries are worth the extra dollar and change. I finished the fries before even touching the gyro. The whole meal was about $12 for a really good gyro (not too soggy, plenty of lamb or whatever meat, fresh lettuce, and onions mmmm), the awesome Greek Fries, and a fountain drink.

The atmosphere is great too. I enjoyed the Greek music and look/cleanliness of the establishment. There's an area outside and a closed off area. 
I didn't see the bathrooms but I bet they're clean too.

I just spent tons of time in Greece and didn't think I'd ever be able to recreate the experience of eating the most delicious, homemade, WARM dolmades. At first I ordered the lemon chicken salad which was to die for but then I figured I'd try an order of the dolmades. Best decision I've ever made! The food came out quick, was reasonably priced and truly outstanding. Jack was helpful, nice and answered lots of my questions. He was fantastic, polite and patient with me. What a great experience- can't wait to come here as much as possible and become a regular :) thank you for such a lovely and authentic meal.",9GXI01ZGRqkKiSJnw7KGxA,0,0,5,wjVUS33wJzWuJSchdVUTvQ

Chicken well done am I insane? No! Trust me when you order the chicken well done, it ends up being crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside because of the marinated lemon juice.

As for the Gyro being well done, that should be mandatory at all gyro places due to the questionable meat, but I make it a point to do so. Plus, i like my gyro meat that way because it ends up tasting like bacon.

""To go"" because of the Panda Express rule. Your just get more and  It is served in a nice container with dressing on the side. If you order to eat there, it's served on a plate and the dressing is way too wet for the salad.   

So the whole order is sort of like a chopped chicken salad with feta instead. I forgot about the small bits of fried pita that taste like heaven!",PAzgMhSXGokkOw2CMZUI1w,2,3,5,YILLZCxovSByw_BTCHkLMA

I'm so happy to have found a go-to Greek restaurant here in Las Vegas. I like that it's casual and quick but you can opt to sit, take your time, and enjoy yourself if you'd like. 

I called my order in for pick up and it was ready it about 10 minutes. For $26 I got the Big Fat Gyro with a side of salad/rice, the Gyro/Chicken Souvlaki combo, a side of Spanakopita, and a drink. 

It was delicious and filling with enough to eat for lunch the next day. The chicken skewers is a definite recommendation as the chicken breast is so juicy, flavorful, and tender. The spanakopita side came with 2 large pieces which was very delicious. 

They have a cafe to the side which I plan on trying sometime soon. I'll definitely be coming here often.",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,1,0,5,-k15gDrHBmke1GXa9yzP6g

Since I had eaten prior to our lunch date, I told my husband that I would just share with him.  We shared a Gyro plate and baklava.  This plate was full enough for the both of us.  Lots of lamb and beef.  It comes with pita, rice, and greens.  The beef skewers had four large cube pieces and it was not over cooked, it was cooked medium well, just the way I like it.

4600728,2014-05-22,1,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"Best Greek Food in Las Vegas!!! Seriously the best ever! Whenever I get the cravings for Greek food or if anyone I'm with asks where to find good Greek food I always bring them here. 

So if you've never been to Yassou and want recommendations on what to get I'll give you a few of my personal favorites. 

As far as sides go, I always get either the Greek fries which are perfectly seasoned with big chunks of feta though out or my favorite the spanakopita which is perfectly flaky with the spinach always hot and the feta blended into it and melted all the way through. If you want to stay traditional then they have great hummus and soft pita as well. 

On to the main course, I always get the super lemon herb steak pita which is amazingly tantalizing. The pita is always fresh and warm with tender with juicy bits of perfectly marinated steak and chunks of ripe tomatoes and slices of onions and lettuce and feta. It comes with a slice of lemon. Sooooo good! Also the Chicken Souvlaki is pretty good too. But the pitas are always bomb! 

For dessert I always get the baklava. Theirs is the best! Fresh honey dripping off every bite. 

Like I said if you want the best Greek food than try Yassou. I think it's as good as it is because it's family owned and you can tell they really care about giving their customers the best food and service they can.",bXsfN7onULUNd1-5W1U62Q,2,0,5,J6TPneBXNfARyKUuq33Xuw

The Plate consisted of rice pilaf, greek salad, pita bread, two small stuffed grape leaves (I think it was grape leaves), and containers of spread. 

Rice pilaf and pita bread dominated the plate, making it a hefty serving of carbs. In my opinion the rice pilaf was bland, lacking flavor. The greek salad was a ordinary salad, though the dressing was also bland. Keeping it consistent, the hummus was bland as well. 

Like I mentioned in the beginning, I was left feeling ""meh"". I have definitely had better. Perhaps the positive reviews from my fellow Yelpers are as the result of meat plates?

Both times the meat was dried out,was not moist or tender and was just an overall uninspiring meal. I also don't like being nickle and dimed for extra sauce is it really gonna break you guys? offer a proper size of sauce with each meal then customers wouldn't need to ask for it and be charged 50 cents extra. I guess i have been exposed to much better and therefore I am more critical. It seems that in las vegas anything approaching average is considered out of this world,I have seen this at many restaurants here.",O5VAQ-dbR2Bk0OZLL1L0Ig,5,2,3,13xE5uEMzdj0uddhwuZP7w

The food: the gyro literally is big and fat, but the perfect combination of meat (beef & lamb), veggies, tzatziki and feta. It's not too big that you can't pick it up, but literally perfect. A top 5 gyro among the many I've eaten in life. The salad and rice was good, but nothing too special.

I ordered the Steak Souvlaki ($8.99) from their lunch special menu from 11 am to 4 pm.  It came with a side salad, rice pilaf, and pita bread.  There were four pieces of meat skewered along with a side of tzatziki sauce.  First off, I think I was expecting something else.  I was expecting more of a souvlaki wrap, as this is how I used to have it.  So that part was different for me.  It was okay, nothing spectacular though.  (I soon learned that most souvlakis served here are with pita bread, and not wraps.  So I'll have to keep my eyes out for that.)

The Husband ordered the Moussaka ""Ground beef, eggplant, and potatoes layered and topped with Bechamel sauce"" ($8.99)  It did sound a lot more appetizing and once I read it off the menu, he was easily sold.  It was okay and he said he's had better.

We also downed it with a Greek soda - blue raspberry.

Overall, Yassou Greek Grill Cafe was a decent Greek food experience.  You go up to the counter and give your order and pay.  They'll give you a number and you take a seat and your food will arrive a few minutes later.  They were pretty busy the weekend we went, so they are doing okay.

 I also saw that there was a coupon for $5 off $20 here: http://www.citycoups.com/yassougreekgrillcoupon.html so we were sold. When we got there, the lady at the counter is firm that you MUST print out the coupon off the website. Kinda a bummer considering I was already in front of their place, saw that ad and because of it decided to come in. 

We shared-

Super lemon chicken pita sandwich ($6.79)- the difference with the super and regular lemon chicken is theres more meat and feta cheese in it. I think the super is the way to go since the feta helped meld the chicken, lemon, tzatziki all together. I think this is definitely something I'd get again and recommend getting here. 

Gyro and Spanakopita plate ($8.59)- the gyro meat is pretty standard good, salad greens were fresh, pilaf is good, pita is soft. I appreciated that the spanakopita wasn't greasy, but it was just missing something for me so the plate over all was just okay. 

It's order at the counter and find a seat so I don't have much to say about service other than what I stated above. Prices are reasonable and it's a cute little place If I'm in the area, I might stop in for that super lemon chicken sandwich but so far my overall impression is that this isn't I'd go drive all the way down for.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,4,3,Rm9kL3om5PQJhBq7IbppFw

Overall very disappointing, the spanokopita was just bland with crappy pastry, the greek fries had a pinch of herbs and feta and otherwise tasted worse than fries from burger king. The gyro sandwhich was ok but didn't stand out and the baklava was mostly pastry with little filling.

Every single one of these dishes is done better close by at Mad Pita Express on Durango between DI & Sahara with comparable prices. But by far the best greek place in town is The Fat Greek on Flamingo & Decatur. If you try the spanokopita at Yassou then go have the same thing at fat greek you will just laugh at the difference as it's not in the same universe.

Back to the food though. Ordered the ""My Big Fat Gyro"" and it was delicious. I wanted to get another one. Had Flame broiled beef & lamb with feta cheese. Also comes with Tzaziki sauce but I'm not a fan of that so had them hold it. Didn't need it anyway. 

Kacey ordered the Souvlaki Combo with Chicken and Steak. The chicken was really good. Steak was just ok I thought. A little tough for my liking but that may be the way its supposed to be made in that dish.

Thought about trying the baklava but it was just sitting out uncovered on top of a display cooler right next to a table where people were eating. I'll pass.

KABOBS: Doesn't Mediterranean food revolve around grilled meats? The steak souvlaki was a little tough, quite flavorless, and dry. Given I did take my order to-go, but the 15 minute drive home exasperated an already existing issue. The gyro meat was pretty tasty! It was thinly sliced and quite flavorful unlike the beef chunks they threw on a stick.

SIDES: The combo plates we ordered were supposed to come with greek salad, rice, and pita. The pita was stone cold and they were out of rice--they replaced it with extra salad. We also got an order of the garlic fries. Basically, french fries packed with feta and some garlic powder. I've eaten better at the greek festival. 

The kabobs and the rest of the sides were somewhat lack-luster. But we really enjoyed the calamari. It was just as delicious as the stuff I get at Firefly. But the dipping sauce it came with was disgusting . It was some stale tasting butter concoction.

I love everything about the food - plain and simple. To give some perspective, I eat Greek/Mediterranean cuisine 3 times a week on average; and I refuse to order from any other restaurant in this category. Why? Because Yassou has thoroughly impressed me every single time. 
Let's start with service quality. I would give these folks 6 stars out of 5 if it was possible. From my understanding, Yassou is a restaurant run by multiple generations of a single family - a family that is truly passionate about what they do. As soon as you step foot in the restaurant, you get the feeling that every employee loves where they work. In a perfect world, every restaurant would evoke these sentiments in their customers.
And how about the food? Outstanding food quality and generous portions makes Yassou my absolute favorite Greek restaurant in Las Vegas. Always fresh and high-quality ingredients make every dish a winner. I'm a huge fan of both the greek salad and the gyro + chicken kebab combo plate. The protein is perfectly seasoned and bursting with flavor, and the rice is nothing short of delectable.

I went with the combo, gyro, fries, and smoothie shake for $10 and change.  The gyro was great...I think the feta cheese puts it on another level.  The fries were kind of plain...wish they had a sauce or seasoning....just get another cucumber sauce to dip the fries :)

The smoothie was surprisingly good...a nice touch, instead of offering a soda with the combo.  I would have went with water otherwise.

5167219,2010-12-04,1,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"I was tired of McDonald's, Burger King, and all the other fast food restaurants I was eating from.  So, I yelped for places and found this with some good ratings and others not so good.  Needless to say, I had no expectations for this restaurant.  I figured anything that doesn't have anything to do with American fast food will be good for me.

Our order were as follows:
1.)  My Big Fat Gyro 5.79
Flame broiled beef & lamb with feta cheese.  This was tasty and had a lot of flavor to it.  Because it was so fat, it was hard to put my mouth around it.  That didn't sound too good, should I have written this differently so it doesn't so graphic?  All jokes aside, this is definitely a no joke gyros.
2.)  Greek Fries  $2.69
I have had better greek fries.  For some reason, this was more bland than the other ones I've had in other restaurants.
3.)  Veggie Spreads Plate 7.49
A delicious assortment of Hummus, Tzakziki, Taramosalata & meatless Dolmades.  
I felt this one was lacking something.  The rice was just so bored on its own, and I found the salad to be just okay.  Everything else on the plate was pretty good.  As for texture, there wasn't much added to it.  

I rated it A-Ok because it's just that, A-Ok.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,3,2,3,l2JOynl6cBQN4rU5QABFIw

My wife often makes fun of me when we go to Greek restaurants because I complain that they don't serve enough meat on their gyros or gyro plates. Not this place! It'd be fair to say that they even serve to much. I ended up forcing myself to eat all of the meat and left the trimmings because I didn't want to waste any of it. It's so good, that no matter how full I was, I still wanted to eat more. 

I had the traditional beef and lamb gyro, and my wife and I split the gyro pasta. The kids had the beef skewers. Awesome!",y2_-wOBaF8Gi1Ql6MRoCnQ,0,0,5,8baIqm1K6nJ6f2iKOCV25g
5205867,2018-06-17,0,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"My family and I used to come to this restaurant regularly about 10 years ago. It always served excellent Greek food and today for Fathers Day we were in the mood for Greek and thought we'd revisit...only to be really disappointed. 

The first thing we noticed was how dirty the floor in the dining area was and the bathroom's poor condition. One restroom was out of order and the other was disgusting, in the most literal sense. It smelled very strongly of urine (it was so intense it actually reminded me of cat urine ) and the floor was covered in dirty marks, paper towels and long hairs. I have no idea how so much hair has accumulated in a restaurant bathroom unless someone literally washed, blow dried and styled their hair in there. Additionally, the bathroom hardware was dirty, rusty and in pretty bad shape. 
Next we ordered our food and were surprised not to see any actual Greek ppl behind the counter or on the line. We always felt like we had a genuinely Greek experience when we previously came as the person at the til and the cooks obviously had either a hand in ownership or had a personal connection to Greek culture and cuisine. 

As for pricing, we were expecting it to be slightly overpriced, as good Greek food can be. If you aren't eating at Del Taco, you can't expect those prices. Unfortunately, Yassou's prices no longer represent the freshness or quality of the food. The food came out very sporadically and some entrees took an exceedingly long time. There were 9 of us eating and all of our meals came out at different times, which is awkward for a family meal with kids who get their food last. I had requested that my Greek Fries be extra crispy and when they were delivered mine didn't look any different than the other normal Greek fries we had ordered. When I asked the food server about my fries' appearance she said that mine were definitely the extra crispy ones and that they all are, in fact, prepared extra crispy. It was a weird comment and didn't really make sense since none of the fries were very crispy anyway, but it was obvious that she didn't have much of a say behind the counter and was trying her best to help the customers in the dining room. The hummus portion was generous but only comes with 1 pita cut into very small triangles, so unless you plan to eat your hummus by the spoonful, you'll have request more pita. Lastly, the meat on my gyro plate was shaved very thinly and the slices were dried and hard before I was even half done. The only thing redeeming about our experience was the excellent customer service of the food runner. She was very friendly and helpful. Offering a cup lid for my young daughter's water and bringing extra napkins, etc. She was great. Overall, we are very disappointed in the current condition of what used to be a fantastic Greek meal AND experience in this part of Las Vegas.",VGxM_ALIfKRL648FDs-xrQ,1,0,1,gBRX8c28_rKCmHnL7hzlzA

Gyro:
Not as heaping with meat as my favorite gyro place in Henderson. The meat was more cooked and saltier than what I'm used to. I couldn't finish it. More tzatziki to mask the saltiness please. 3.5/5

Greek Fries:
I love fries. Crispy, crunchy and hot with a little bit of feta cheese and parsley. Not the best Greek fries I've had but still good. They only give you a handful so you might want to order another side of fries. 4/5

Strawberry Banana Smoothie:
This is absolutely great since I don't drink soda. They have strawberry, mango, banana, etc. I asked them to make strawberry banana smoothie for me if it wasn't too much of a hassle and they did. Yay!  5/5

But for what you get with the combo, it's definitely good value. I'd much rather drive 3 more miles to get here than eat at G Time. Plus, the service was great.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,4,4,x-tNHr1Z0jHY13sjSdymzw

5333643,2017-08-15,7,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"What a nice Greek spot in the middle of the desert. For many years I would pass by this place but never got the chance to check it out. After work, I finally decided to complete another restaraunt that was bookmarked in my app for awhile. I'm so happy that I did, because I had great experience at Yassou. The moment you walk in this place, you'll notice the Greek artwork and typical blue and white motif that is allover the restaraunt. There is a cool story along the wall about the history of the restaraunt. Greek music in the background is played throughout and the open kitchen provided a cool interaction between guests and employees. 

Onto the food, everything was simply delicious from the Lemon Chicken Pita combo with Greek Fries to the Chicken Souvlaki meal was spot on. They make really good Pita bread and the Tzaziki Sauce was delicious. The Chicken was tender and really seasoned just right. Every bite of my Lemon Chicken had a refreshing taste yet balanced savory flavor. Another item that stood out was the fresh Baklava, very good and made just right. Great amount of sweetness and crunch with a moist texture. I would come back to try out more of the other dishes that they offer in the near future.

Another cool thing about this place was when I went to use the Restroom, I notice that there is a Patio to the left side facing Charleston Blvd was a cool dinning option during days when Vegas has mild weather. The Restroom was clean but I had to share this experience because when I used one of the Restroom. I immediately notice a blue bottle to the corner and couldnt contain myself because it was Windex. All I could think of was, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding!"" LoL.

5363193,2012-07-27,0,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"The first thing that drew me to Yassou Greek Grill Cafe in 2008 was the building.  I'm a fan of Greek Mythology and had only had Greek food once before, and thought this place with the Greek lettering and broken pillar logo looked quite inviting.  Plus, it was very close to CSN.

My favorite thing to order is the My Big Fat Gyro w/o onions... because, well, who likes onions?  You get a great, heaping helping of lamb, tomatoes, lettuce, feta, and tzatziki sauce.  The Greek fries are also yummy-- I think they are sprinkled with a touch of lemon, and then lots of feta cheese.

The owners are amicable and if you're unsure of what to order, they can make great recommendations.  One of my friends hadn't had lamb before, and they sliced a sample off the rotisserie just for her to try.  They also sell the pita bread they use on their gyros.

A combo with American fries and a smoothie comes in at a cool $10.99. It might seem like a lot for fast food, but once you see the gyro it is not outrageous. What is ridiculous is the thought that any single person could finish this colossal pita sandwich alone. 

Yassou does give a generous portion of meat, veggies, feta, and tzatziki sauce. I was torn about the meat, because I love the crispiness, but it was also a little dry. With the amount of yogurt based dressing, it is easy to overlook. I am glad that I split this meal with my sister.

My chicken souvlaki was nice and moist, but the salad was drenched in dressing that seemed to be dumped on top of the lettuce and not tossed through.

We had lunch here and it was unremarkable. A Greek salad and gyros sandwich were both without any standout features. French fries were obviously from a bag, frozen. Not worth the calories. The sandwich had too much lettuce and not enough onion on the gyros sandwich, so it was bland, and tomato diced, and on top, which made the sandwich unnecessarily messy.

I don't care if the staff doesn't hug and comfort me in times of need, I just want good food which is exactly what Yassou provides. 

Their prices are fair given the quality and size of the plates they serve. I usually end up spending 10-15 dollars a meal. The thing that really sets them apart for me is their meats. Cooked perfectly, not dry, not tough, and definitely not bland.

The gyros were not bad. They are a mix of beef and lamb and definitely worthy of the Fat name. We did not find them to be better than the gyros we've had in Ohio, but they were still good. I think much of the flavor came from salt, to be honest.

I was surprised by the rice pilaf, which gets high reviews. All I got was rice cooked in chicken broth- basically, yellow-hued rice with nothing more in it. That's not pilaf.  The Greek salad came with no vinaigrette- no salad dressing whatsoever. It was Greek by virtue of the feta and single olive that came with it, I guess.  The American fries were fine- just normal.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,3,1,3,C6lqbxbA8nqNxS_6uAeReg
5517878,2016-05-20,0,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"I.Just.Love.This.Place. I've been going here for probably 5 years now, if not more. They are consistently good. It's worth the drive from Boulder City (where I live) if that tell you anything!

Produce on salads and gyros is fresh, as is the meat - always well seasoned and cooked well. I've tried several things here, Spanakopita is fresh, truly made by hand (no pre boxed frozen stuff here). Fries are perfectly cooked and it's worth the upgrade to Greek fries. Feta cheese on salads and fries is creamy and tangy. Pitas are soft and delicious, and the gyros are made with generous portions. Sauces are delicious! The Baklava is made daily, SUPER fresh, warm, and the perfect balance of sweetness with the richness of the pastry and nuts. One word of warning, they do not serve pitted olives so watch your teeth! 

The staff are attentive and fast. This is a true family owned business and I see the owner and his son working their butts off every time I'm in. The eating areas are kept clean, and there's lots of natural light coming in and a nice outdoor patio area if you like.

My absolute favorite thing in the world (other than maybe koala bears) is koobideh/luleh/lula/ground beef kebab. They didn't have it here!  Major fail.  We ordered a chicken kebab plate, their special fries, and a gyro salad.  
The chicken was dry.  For me, that's inexcusable at any med place.  Their whole deal is grilling things.  If you can't grill meat, don't open a restaurant that specializes in grilling meat. Period.  
The fries were kind of nice with the spices, and feta bits, but the cut was a bit too thick, and they were overall a bit greasy (even for fries).
The salad was pretty good.  I would eat it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it either.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,1,1,2,R4O0uRciXGvGT6ks2MBLOQ

5534308,2015-12-11,0,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"So decided to check out this place after seeing all of the great reviews on Yelp.  I'm a fan of Greek food, despite not having eaten at all of the Mediterranean restaurants in the valley.  For my initial visit, I decided on the Big Fat Gyro combo which included ""Greek"" fries (garlic and feta) and a fountain soda ($12). Their menu was quite large and encompassed a very nice range of specialties I look forward to checking out on future visits.

I arrived on a Thursday around 11:30 and was greeted by a friendly cashier.  After paying for my order, it magically appeared about 10 minutes later. Opa!!   The gyro was neatly wrapped in foil, and about a third of it was poking out, revealing tasty looking meat topped with tzatziki sauce and feta crumbles.  I was disappointed the meat didn't seem to have very much flavor; typically used to stronger Greek spices and flavors in the gyro meat, this was much more mild.  The pita was decent and definitely not fresh made, as stacks of pre-packaged pitas were displayed 10 high.  Anyway, it was pretty good.

I did notice the owner, Mr Pappas, to be working his tail off preparing nearly every dish himself.  This proud owner only had the assistance of another guy who helped him out when he had a chance.  His red faced determination was evident as he rarely stood still and ensured every dish was prepared as it should be.  Las Vegas needs to continue to support local, hard-working businessmen like Mr Pappas. 

Look forward to my next visit when I plan on ordering Souvlaki platter with side of hummus.  Can't wait.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,1,1,4,aW5C7h1I6HPWaXYvvexkpQ

They don't skimp on anything the comes in the gyro.  The lamb is well seasoned.  The tzatziki sauce it's refreshing.  Living in NLV, it's always worth the drive to eat here.

We arrived with plenty of time to eat but because of this we got our food very close to closing time, and felt like we had to rush to eat.  Not cool.

I hope they will be around whenever I make my yearly trip back to LV",j3Xr0XifJTb43Hdmue8b9A,2,2,5,da-6CZ2ECAZpHUB1qEU5VA

Yassou maintains consistent quality and has a good variety of menu selections. Family owned and operated. Pleasant staff.

They cater too.  Easy and simple.   I eat here 3 times a week.  I stopped eating meet for almost 300 days, but the thought of missing out on not being able to have a gyro brought me back to being a meat eater.   They have delicious spanakopita too...",oGvBJbb39wZruLocmYMcpw,0,0,5,va-VHTsR08Wy4BKa9PurfA
5944441,2013-03-02,0,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"Stopped by here for lunch with a colleague to grab a bite to eat. First of all, their customer service is TOP NOTCH! As soon as we walked in, the guy behind the register greeted us and chatted with my friend (he's a regular there). He was very polite and went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable and had everything and anything I could have wanted. He was like that with every person who walked in. KUDOS! It seemed like most of the people who came in were regulars, or they treated them that way. I can't say enough nice things about how awesome the service was. Now to the food. I had a Big Fat Gyro Sandwich that was yummy. My only complaint was that it needed more tahini sauce (again, you can never have too much!) but I stole some from my dining partner. It was a great, light meal. I definitely will be back!",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,1,0,4,BD-qaWX6XwVxPqA2p4b_mg
5960176,2015-03-15,6,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"Attempting to eat a little better than usual, I had my eye on a salad for lunch. I have wandered by this restaurant on many occasions and finally decided to give them a shot. 

They were packed for lunch, so I put in my order and found a seat to sit and wait. It took a good amount of time since there were a number of orders ahead of me, but once it was ready I was so excited to dig right in to my lemon chicken and gyro Greek salad. 

There was tons of meat, feta, onions and kalamata olives to accompany the lettuce. I didn't even feel the need to pour any dressing over it, since it was packed with so many delicious toppings. The salad really hit the spot the well-cooked gyro and chicken made my day, it was so delicious. 

I plan on making this a regular on my lunchtime rotation and I look forward to trying many more menu items in the future. I might call my order in ahead of time to save time.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,8,4,FG7djpTOeOsDBd0HQ-iauw
5968695,2016-08-02,1,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,"Love the food. Usually service is great too   Today service was terrible- the cashier, which is what dropped the rating down. He argued with another person who said her order was incorrect then went and tossed it back with the rest of the food with a visible attitude about it. Was t very pleasant when our order was taken. Owner wasn't in as he usually is- must have a big impact",c5oYE9tK0Rb0lSUREw1lxQ,2,0,2,KwI86yr16FADb2_g0OU68A
5972455,2014-10-04,0,65eDIQ8bpMJFtgdyX7ulVA,Service/Owners are always friendly and smiling.  Hands on ownership with father and son team that take pride in their work.  Food is always excellent.  Most people love their chicken kabobs the bust but many other great things on the menu.  I usually order the steak and gyro combo plate.  Their calamari is absolutely incredible when they have it but they have been unable to get a supplier to get them the quality of calamari they want/used to get so they haven't been serving it anymore.  Their greek pizza is also terrific.  Hard to find places where they make the food from scratch after you order and is so fresh and tasty and inexpensive.  You order in a line and they bring it out to you but you don't have waitresses so a bargain and aren't required to tip.  Consistently good place that is a once a week place for me.  Don't forge to try the Lemon Soup!,Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,1,0,4,hd74m2V2koDQ-V8vuirJ9g
