TO START.....DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE  YOU WILL GET SICK!!!!!!  We were visiting Las Vegas, and were lounging around outside our hotel when a man came by to hand us a flyer and had a shirt on with the logo Soul Food Express.  He was very personable and began to talk about his food and that it was cooked daily by his great aunt from Alabama.  He said that they deliver to any hotel and it is 24-hours.  He seemed very pleasant and gave off a nice impression.  Well shame on us for falling for this mess!!!!!  We called when we got in that night and ordered the catfish, mac and cheese, and potato salad.  
The same man arrived dressed in a t-shirt and jeans and handed us our food.  We opened it up and it was a complete joke.  The ""catfish"" was not catfish, it was maybe tilapia if we are lucky, that was salty and undercooked.  The macaroni and cheese had no flavor,  and honestly, you could absolutely tell that it was not made from scratch.  Velveeta shells and cheese tastes better!!  I am not a huge critic of food and have never ever reviewed anything on yelp as usually I don't have a problem.  But this could not go without me warning and trying to make it known.  I spit out the mac and cheese in the napkin, and the potato salad was not even edible.  The food was so salty, even the little I tried to eat made me sick.
About a half hour later after throwing most of the food out, my friend and I felt nauseated and I had a raging headache.  I definitely got food poisoning and was sick most of the next day.
Please do not order from this place.  
TO ADD, after he left the room, the next morning, he had texted the phone we ordered the food from to say.....""WOW!!"" and ""WHEN ARE YOU GUYS LEAVING?"" Very creepy and inappropriate and not to mention scary.  I was afraid he was going to return to the room and harass us.  I had to block his number.  
This place needs to be shut down.  I appreciate people trying to work and start a business, but not when it is at the expense of people's health and not when you try to hit on the people you deliver to.    DO NOT ORDER FROM HIM!!!!!!",e4Xrgp87ZQQKg7Ng20VRKw,3,0,1,T_Mtm3MMhcsU2BEyMd0bXA

2453381,2015-03-22,1,G7yeF8yMra1_kymdxPVCWQ,"I ordered from this company today I had the catfish.  This was a huge surprise because who delivers catfish? Well this place does. The catfish was golden fried to perfection. 
 Also had a cool opportunity to taste a new menu item the fried shrimp. These people are on to something new fresh & yummy. I was able to text my order in and they delivered it with in about 20 minutes. Thats super fast because I live on the Vegas Strip & traffic is always bumper to bumper. The husband totally agrees with me to give them five stars. I will order from these professional chef's on wheels ASAP. Oh yeah the deserts are wonderful!",6ZC-0LfOAGwaFc5XPke74w,0,6,5,MkH23wdGoZ6aX4AsPGNrcg

Like why have ribs on the menu if you only make them once a week. they should do like rib Wednesday if that's the case, but the food is good and the price is right. Just order a hour before because they take a long time &call before ordering or taking a drive to order because they are always missing something off THEIR menu but then again that's soul food restaurant for ya",we0yUxjMZMrXvA6IoT4oAA,0,2,3,3Y6XYC769mmecRp1SrtIgw
3019658,2015-02-26,5,G7yeF8yMra1_kymdxPVCWQ,"I haven't had some good soul food in a while when my family & I were approached by the owner of soul food express with an enticing offer of delicious soul food & free dessert with our first order. We ordered 5 dinners that night & threw out 5 dinners & 5 desserts. My fried chicken was dry & my mom & sister's pork chops were under cooked & still bleeding. When my cousin finally received her catfish (it wasn't with the original delivery) it was too salty. The potato salad and sweet potato pie were store bought, the cornbread was a crumbly,  dry mess & the banana pudding was a complete & utter disaster! GREEN BANANAS in my pudding! 

The owner was nice with seemingly flawless customer service but the food was atrocious. But it all made sense when after some research I discovered that the business was operating without a license & the food was being cooked & packaged in one of Vegas' most dirty & unkempt weekly apartments complexes. It is my strongest recommendation that you DO NOT order or eat from this delivery service.",ld2cztRL0XnBhSXkuZ9JGw,19,6,1,6fZoqDUr_kbVRLz0Z_a5QA

On both occasions the food was ... good ... not great, but its hard to judge because my meal was cold. The driver promised a 40 minute delivery ... both deliveries took about 2 hours. The first time I order the fried catfish meal and the fried chicken meal; both with yams and mac & cheese. Not only was our order late but we received yams and greens; not mac & cheese. The second I patronize this business I order the fried catfish meal and the chicken and waffle deluxe meal with a banana pudding dessert. Again; the order took about 2 hours and once the again my order was wrong. The waffles were burnt, the chicken was dry, and I did not receive my banana pudding dessert that I paid for. The driver is very nice and well dressed and the food was far from bad but seriously ... who cares if it's cold or the order is wrong. I don't think I'll be patronizing this business in the future.",X38qtPO2gwJ4TklDtJEc_A,4,3,3,9vdEVToXm6M-vyjru6Tqxw

We were approached by a well dressed gentleman with a great story. One that included him lying about ALOT of things...like there actually being recipes from his grandmother. Sigh.

We were stupid. I wil admit that. We placed the order and an hour in a half later he arrives at our room dressed in ...i mean i cant describe it. He looked high off of drugs. When i asked him about the 1 negative review he said oh it was just a hating ex girlfriend...turns out..THATS A LIE. I wish i would have done more research.

One look at the food and we were like hmmm okay. Maybe. You know how it is. Tipsy ready for some decent food. The catfish looked okay on the outside...the mac and cheese was literally runny and like some boxed ish...the potato salad basically had a price tag on it still from the grocery store! the mac n cheese was not edible. The catfish while it looked appetizing...omg we both dug in at same time and NOOOO! HAD TO throw up 2hrs later. It literally made us sick! It was NOT cooked and i honestly know catfish...that wasnt catfish.

He then continued to text us the next morn and following day. Harassing us asking if we were still in town and not leaving us alone.

I LOVE to support black owned businesses. But this isnt a business. This is a hustle ran out of an apartment. Do yourself a favor...find one of the hundreds of other places to eat in Vegas. Fucked up our entire morning. :*(

These revies are very very clearly fake. DO YOUR RESEARCH!  DONT MAKE SAME MISTAKE WE DID!",50fZwzVTSZc1BWidw0Puvw,16,1,1,Wq2FXnSgUmNMRiE-5d6i4w
