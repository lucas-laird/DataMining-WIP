I tried both sauces that they had in the crock pots and they were very good and added a lot to the meet.  I really enjoyed the hot and spicy sauce.   I had the pulled pork and Texas brisket.  They were good, but definitely not the best I ever had, but then I am now used to NC BBQ.  If you are on the strip and want to get some decent priced BBQ, go to Dickeys.

When I ate here...everything was dry. As in, it shouldn't have been served as its shelf life expectancy had long passed. Nothing was fresh. NOTHING. It was THE worst cafeteria food I'd ever eaten.  And I paid good money for it. 

Sadly this place doesn't live up to the quality and deliciousness of the original. It barely lives up to being called BBQ.

If this place is franchised, they are destroying a good name & brand. If its owned by Dickeys themselves, shame on you for allowing this place to ruin your name, reputation, & BBQ. 

What is truly sad? People who have never had true BBQ think this place serves up great food. They don't. They simply do not. (Although, I can see why someone might think its good.)

Fact: meat with sticky, tangy, brown sauce does not make it BBQ. Its a process, an art form, mastered by few, having left numerous delusional...just like Dickeys.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,6,0,1,C6HxK7wLkTLOGTzuPyAjBg

I would have given 5 stars but they mistakenly forgot to include a big part of our meal in the bag for takeout.  Once home, we were too far to go back . They did reimburse us the money on our CC.  

The brisket here is about as good as you are going to find in Las Vegas.  Believe me. Trust me.  I have tried them all.  The sauce is excellent.  And they are one of the only places in town that automatically provides pickles and onions - a necessity for a brisket sandwich.  

Today we also ordered the fried okra (pretty good) and the tanglers (aka, fried shoestring onion rings).  Both were good.  

The meat is very tender and falls apart easily.  It's not the ""rubbery"" brisket you might find at other places in town.  All in all, I wouldn't travel to Las Vegas looking for good BBQ.

For a fast food place, the brisket was amazingly good. The fries were crispy but the side caesar salads were too small.  BBQ sauce is self serve, you have 3 bubbling vats to choose from, original, spicy & I forget what the third one was.
The big jar of pickles would've been a nice touch if they were edible...we took a few to eat with our leftovers...big mistake.

636081,2009-12-06,0,bzyoY6HHZJS39fspg-6DrA,"Dickey's is a small but clean restaurant located in a strip mall next to the Factory Outlet Center.  You walk in, order your food and have a seat.  They will bring it to you if you are dining in or call your name when your takeout is ready to go.  They serve Texas BBQ with the traditional accompaniments: dill pickles, raw onion and jalapenos if you choose.  

I find the brisket to be good.  It's very tender and juicy.  That's no small achievement with brisket.  One odd thing though.  I've been to Dickey's several times and never experienced the smoky flavor the other reviewers describe.  I'm not complaining because their meat is really good.  The outside of the meat is black, and you might think it is what BBQ fans call ""bark"".  Not so.  Even if you eat a small piece of it with nothing else, there is no smoky taste.

You can help yourself to a small selection of BBQ sauces.  Their standard sauce is good.  It is not as sweet as typical Texas BBQ sauce.  It has a little sharper taste.

The sides are ok.  I've had most of them and can't say they are particularly remarkable.  The do have fried okra which is a nice choice.

The Great Mystery Continues

Another trip to Dickey's and still no smoke. It's bizarre. The sign on the wall says ""Big Yellow Cup And Hickory Smoke"". They have a smoker. And yet, the meat is not smoked. It's not bad, but why not smoke it? The brisket is more like roast beef that the fabled Texas BBQ brisket. I have no idea why this is the case.",pI1mlfKEb8dbhuOuEKj4fA,0,0,2,B2CVJ7syp7cwtDV3GzZUzw

So my husband and I went he ordered the 1 plate and I ordered the quarter plate. On these plates come to sides , a biscuit ,onions and pickles. I got ribs potato salad ,baked beans and I ordered a side of macaroni also the biscuit and pickles and onions, my husband had brisket ,macaroni, baked beans ,the biscuit ,pickles and onions. The cashier discounted my food which I'm not sure why but most likely because he knows that the food is horrible.

My ribs tasted like leather and jerky combination the sides macaroni and baked beans were only lukewarm, they most likely cook the meat the day before and put it in the refrigerator and heated up to order which makes it get even more dry and hard. My  husbands brisket was dry and we already live in the desert so it sucks to get cottonmouth from meat !! also there was a hair on my husbands biscuit. So if you like dried meats and leather tasting ribs this is the place for you also if you don't like your sides to be heated up hot or to even have your food barely hot at all this is definitely a place for you was for sure a waste of $22.

I don't know what happened to Dickey's. They used to be very good a few years back. But based on the quality of their ribs, clearly the cooks have left the building as no one there has a clue about food.  

I guess I should have clued in when the guy cutting the ribs, kept tossing racks to the side and grabbing other Saran wrapped sets of ribs from this big steel rib box. He settled on what he thought was the best worth serving.. NOT!!

I'll start by stating that the Beef and Cheese Baker (stuffed baked potato) was actually very tasty.  But it's a baked potato stuffed with extras.  I also enjoyed the fried okra and coleslaw.  Was wishing for a little more bite or horseradish in the slaw, but I like the chunky cut style.

The sliced brisket and pulled pork were both very dry and somewhat bland in flavor.  I wasn't really getting the layers of smoke and spicy rub I would expect at a BBQ joint.  I did appreciate the sauces being heated for serving, but they were all kind of sweet with different levels of spice.  

This place is not terrible.  Very clean, and the service was just fine.  It just reflects more of that ""big chain"" bbq shop that doesn't put the extra love into the food that's plated.  It's obvious that there is a play book that is followed where the meats are prepared early in the day, and likely sit in a heated area waiting to be served.  By 7 PM, smoked meats get pretty dry.

With some of the other choices in town, this is likely my first and last visit to Dickey's.  Good BBQ is worth the drive.",6x3aIb8SLZcOFcHEcWBLog,1,0,2,OMNNbaITrE0NYLPJSoczYw

The weird thing about this experience was that our order came up but my plate was hot and ready to eat but my fiancé plate was cold lol.

Rainbow Blvd. I pass this place on my way home from work everyday and since there are really no good BBQ places in Las Vegas I thought I should consider trying this place. I called a friend of mine that lives in Texas and asked him about this place and he said Dicky's is very good. This week I just happened to get a coupon in the mail for a buy1 get 1 free so I figured what better time to try. Me and my husband went in at 8:00 pm on a Sunday night. They close at 9:00 pm.There was no one in the place but when we entered we received a warm welcome from a man who seemed to be the manager. He asked us if we had ever eaten there and we said no. He immediate replied. Well you know what that means . You will be back again. I told him I really hope so. We then ordered. My husband got a huge baked potato with chopped brisket and cheese on top and I ordered the chicken. The man said they were out of chicken and ham. I then ordered the chopped  beef brisket and two sides. Mac & cheese and coleslaw. We decided to take our food home. The sweet tea is the bomb. The man who gave us our to go order advised us that since he didn't have the meat I requested in the beginning of my order he gave me extra meat to make up for it.he then thanked us and we said hope to see you again .once we got home and started to eat we couldn't believe how tender and delicious the beef brisket was. My husbands baked potato was huge and I had enough meat to feed two people. The Mac and cheese was great . The coleslaw was awesome. My husband kept eating my coleslaw.Overall from going into this place on a Sunday night an hour before they closed. They exceeded my expectation and have new customers for life.

It was hard to decide what to order for the first time since they had so many tasty sounding dishes. Well, I decided to try a little bit of whatever I was feeling and save the left overs for later. 

Meat Orders:

Sliced Beef Brisket: Wowsers! Meat just rips apart with no effort, mild but evident smokey beefy flavor.. Just smother their bbq sauce and enjoy!

Pulled Pork: A mound of thinly shredded pork, doesn't explode with flavor but has a good sublte porky taste to it

Polish Sausage: Plain ol' sausage goodness. comes sliced and doesn't need any sauce to accompany it

Side Orders:

Green Beans with Bacon: When I saw Bacon I was sold! Goes great with the green beans

Baked Potato Casserole: Its like a Baked potato thats been mashed. Goes hand in hand with any of the meats mentioned above

Macaroni & Cheese: simply a southern comfort side you can't go wrong with

* Their Deli Style PIckles bathed in their jumbo jar aren't bad 
and their Bread/Dinner Rolls are so buttery, a must have!

The barbecue sauces are not added and not cooked in. You need to add your own sauces to your own taste. People who say this food is too mild or tasteless are people who don't know how to season their own food. They slow cook the meat until it is perfect and still tender. You then add your own barbecue sauce, which you can dipper as much sauce as you want. They have Dickey's house sauce and a spicy sauce. They have a lot of free stuff. Gigantic dill pickles or jalapeno peppers in large jars, extra large souvenir cups for a self-serve drinks. There is a soft-serve vanilla ice cream dispenser for the customers to self-serve themselves with small cups or ice cream cones. Their biscuits are tasty too, and fresh-baked.

The brisket was dry and the smoke taste was I think injected, I could not locate a smoke ring. The ribs were drown in sauce and for good reason, the hog was overcooked, sad. The sides were nothing to cheer about, I have had better beans and slaw from Walmart, and that is truly sad.

A few observations I have about this so called ""BBQ""

You never see a smoke ring on ANY of the meat.
No smoke taste, ever.
Drowning food in BBQ sauce does NOT make it BBQ.

I ask of anyone to tell me if you have ever seen smoke coming from any Dicky's restaurant? I sure haven't!! This is because IT'S NOT REALLY BBQ!

Several co-workers and I started to feel ill a couple hours after lunch.

Their chopped brisket is amazing. As is their pulled pork. I was pretty dissatisfied with their ribs though. They weren't ""fall off the bone"" tender as I hoped they would be.

The baked potato casserole was so scrumptious, as a matter of fact, I liked it better than the meat, which is saying alot. The green beans were fair, not out of this world but good. The Jalapeno beans are a must try, smoky, not too hot, just right in accordance to southern style cuisine.

We liked it so much, that we got food from here 3 times during our stay...Twice we ate the daily specials in restaurant, and one time we got the family xl pack. It was all good.

Being from Texas, I used to eat at Dickey's quite a bit, especially during lunch when I needed a quick bite, along with other fast casual or quick service BBQ joints off course. Although this one's a bit smaller and slower than the ones back home, the food more than makes up for it. Most of the time I'm here the meats are well smoked and flavorful, although the pulled pork and brisket could be a little more moist and less lean, which makes it dry when you smoke it. The sides are pretty delicious and I tend to go with the mac and cheese and bacon green beans, but half the time I can't even decide which 2 I want to pick. 

If you stop by on a weekday during lunch, they have a special of the day now and for $8.99 you can grab a BBQ sandwich or entree with 2 sides and a drink! The most recent time I was here I opted for this deal and I felt like there was more than enough food I could barely finish. They also have a free ice cream machine here, as does every Dickey's location, but I wouldn't recommend it except for kids...it isn't very good ice cream...but hey it's free right?

There are typically only a couple front line employees and 1 register so it could take a while if you come in during lunch rush.

Don't let the shopping center location and chain restaurant appearance fool you. This place is the real deal...For certain items.

I ordered the full rack, the guy turned to a warmer and grabbed a rack of wrapped ribs. Yes they were already saran wrapped. He didn't even throw them on the grill, just chopped them up and into the box they went. the ribs were so over cooked it was difficult to tell when the meat ended and the bone began. When I could find a decent rib the sauce was so bland it took away from the meat. My 2 sides were the creamy coleslaw (I think someone owes K.F.C for stealing the recipe) and the loaded potato casserole (mashed potato's with melted cheese on top).

I went in here after a long hike one time with a group of coworkers and absolutely pigged out.

Service is FAST here because they already have the various meats cooked. Even with this, the meat is very fresh. 

The only thing I'd ever ordered from here is the westerner because it is a roll and you can choose two different meats. I usually get the westerner with a beef brisket and pulled pork. Cheese, pickles and onions are also what they include in this but are optional. My favorite side items are carb loaded though with my usual mac and cheese or garlic mashed potatoes (with chives and cheese). 

They have a wealth of condiments such as 3 flavors of barbeque sauce: spicy, sweet and their special combination sauce which I love the most.

Also, they do have weekly specials from Monday-Friday.

Love how these guys cater as well.

Free vanilla ice cream on your way out at the exit is the bonus!

2748484,2010-02-13,1,bzyoY6HHZJS39fspg-6DrA,"My friend and I were on our way to the infamous Studio B Buffet at the M Resort when we realized that we only had an hour to eat. I had a plane to catch at 3pm today and I was debating if I should miss my flight so I can enjoy my meal at Studio B. Alas, we knew it was impossible. In the end, we came upon a strip mall and decided to eat fast food. It was a choice between Dickey's and Buffalo Wild Wings. Instantaneously, we chose Dickey's, only because we just had Buffalo Wild Wings recently.

Walking into Dicky's, we realized that we probably picked the right choice because it was super packed!

This was another casual restaurant. The first thing I did was get in line. While in line, I checked out the big blown out menu. There were a lot to choose from.  I ended up with the Big BBQ Sandwich combo with 2 sides ($7). 

Now, my order didn't end there. I now gotta order the type of meat. There were a lot of meats to choose from and I ended up with the beef brisket. As for the sides, I added waffle fries and fried onions. I also added a side of fried okra to my order. The total bill came out to be $9.19 ($1.50 for the third side, plus tax).

The condiments were at the self serve station. At the station, you can get unlimited dill pickles and BBQ sauces. There were 3 kinds of sauces:

1. Dicky's special sauce
2. Sweet BBQ sauce
3. Spicy BBQ sauce

Overall, the sauces pretty much taste the same. The only difference was the flavor of the sauce being more bold, spicy, or sweet.

The brisket itself was ok. It was lacking flavor and it wasn't tender. The sides definitely made up for this. 

Overall my experience here was ok. I came to the conclusion that the reason why this place was packed was because the patrons were just like me: we couldn't make it in time for the buffet at M Resort!

Tip: The Big BBQ Sandwich itself costs $5, BUT on Mondays, it is only $1 !!!!",-AJlByb8daR97XtiHKqQUA,1,1,2,qJ7GaPB83LQM_UBFjqPWrQ

I usually go in on Ribs Tuesdays and it's a hit or miss when it comes to the quality of the ribs. Still worth the price. Sometimes the ribs are hot, sometimes cold.
However, the meat always falls off the bone and I can get into the marrow.

For $10 3 ribs, 2 sides, a biscuit, and a large drink in a big #yellow cup is a great price for the convenience, that is if you don't want to pay a little bit more and wait longer for ribs from Ellis Island. The staff is usually pleasant and the restaurant is clean. 

I especially enjoy the free ice cream cone, and the fancy plastic dinnerware!

The barbecue sauce is decent. I've done a taste test and there is a mild difference between each of the sauces.
You can taste a little bit of a kick in the hot barbecue sauce vs more brown sugar in the sweet sauce.

The reason for my 4-star rating is sometimes the ribs are a hit or miss. They aren't the best ribs I've ever had, but they aren't the worst. The fried okra isn't the best, I usually prefer the baked potato salad for my side.

Plus they have a 5 gallon vat of pickles, and I am a pickle freak, and they have free ice cream bye the door on your way out.

They usually run some good specials, so keep an eye out and you can score a sandwich for under a buck.

3044371,2013-11-23,0,bzyoY6HHZJS39fspg-6DrA,"I was working in the area and in the mood for BBQ.

I ordered the two meat plate, two meats and two sides, and a drink. Price just under $15.

For the meats I had pulled pork and sliced brisket. For the sides I had bbq beans and baked potato casserole (loaded mashed potatoes).

I'll start with the sides. One of the things I like about bbq places is trying the different sides each place offers. The baked potato casserole was excellent, the bbq beans average at best.

Before I get to the meats, a little background is needed. I have three smokers at home a vertical, a side box and a gas vertical. That being said, I'm no stranger to bbq, so my bar may be a little higher, than the average bbq eater.

Both of the meats were dry from being over cooked, they needed sauce to make them moist. Good bbq is kept moist while cooking, it doesn't need sauce, after cooking, for moisture. The sauce, after cooking, is something you add to personal taste, if at all.

The pulled pork was less dry,  I tried it without sauce and it had a decent taste on it's own. I still ended up putting sauce on it because it was dry and I wanted to sample the sauces. The portion was generous, I had leftovers of the pork.

Now the brisket, totally over cooked and dry. You have the option of sliced or chopped. I ordered it sliced, though it didn't make much difference, you couldn't cut it without it breaking into little pieces. It's suppose to be tender, but retain it's structural integrity. You should be able to cut a piece off and pick it up with a fork, not a chance. I tried to pick the bite up with a fork and ended up with little pieces on the tines of the fork, the rest of the bite was sitting in the basket in pieces. It was so dry it absolutely needed sauce. The portion was less generous, no leftovers.

Since I mentioned the need for sauce, they had three sauces, normal, hot n spicy and sweet. Since I had plenty of dry meat that needed sauce, I tried all three. They were all three good sauces. I liked the regular, the hot and the sweet, in that order, but that's a personal taste. I don't care for sweet bbq sauces in general, if I'm using store bought sauces, I prefer Chris and Pitts, to KC or SBR's sauce, because it's less sweet.

Summary:
The above being said, the place is not terrible, I've had far worse bbq. Would I go there again, probably not.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,2,0,2,GWLS2NlaEta4wU4SostawA

I've found it next to impossible to find any excellent barbecue in Vegas since Lil' Joe Orduna's Texas BBQ closed years ago, and while this place doesn't even come close to Orduna's, it does an alright job of BBQ at a cheap price.

There was hardly anybody in the restaurant, so I was able to make an order pretty quick with a friendly server at the counter. I had the 2-meat plate with Chopped Beef Brisket and Pulled Pork. For the two sides, I ordered the Waffle Fries and the Mac N'Cheese. It came out as $10.80, which wasn't too bad since the meal filled me up completely.

I was pretty pleased with the meal overall, though the Pulled Pork was definently better than the Beef Brisket...and the Mac N'Cheese was pretty bad. TOO much cheese with really soggy noodles.

My girlfriend and I went in to the store around 230pm for a late lunch on Saturday.  First, there was no one in the dining inside the store.  A young African American girl was at the far end of the cook/prep area and said she would be right with us.  We waited for about 5 minutes while my girlfriend saw her struggljng am attempting to open #10 can of product.

She finally comes up to counter and asks if we will dining in or take out.  I said it will be take out, she then replied ""thats good.""  Next my girlfriend ordered the classic brisket sandwich special of the day and mentioned she received an email for a free birthday sandwich.  The girl replied stating ""well your coupon is good until the 13th so you have time to use it.""  My girlfriend said we will not be back before then.  

Next the Dickeys girl said ""well that coupon is just for the sandwich and doesn't include sides.""  My girlfriend  said she understood and why couldnt she just order sides?  The Dickeys girl said with an argumentative tone in her voice ""but the coupon doesnt come with sides.""  My girlfriend said I understand, but why can't I order sides?  As the Dickeys girl was prepping the brisket for the sandwich, she had a grumpy look and then my girlfriend told her to nevermind the sides and it would only be the sandwich.

As we stood there waiting, the girl started to aggressively chop the brisket, several pieces of meat came flying over the service order counter and pieces landed on both my girlfriend and me.  We were standing about a foot away from the ordering counter.  After this my girlfriend and I looked at each other and then walked out.  I turned and said ""no thanks, nevermind"" as we walked out the door and went somewhere else for lunch.  This was the absolutely the worst experience possible, especially at this location.",VEWMzlzcDf5G3mwJzEGN2g,3,0,1,tPSjVva4W0YMEo9DJjpyUQ

What you will find at Dickey's is decent BBQ with super prices. When I think of Dickey's BBQ Pit, I think of having that ""wine taste, with the beer budget"".  

Dickey's was a last minute decision for us.  We were looking for BBQ, but wanted somewhere quick and close to our current location.  Dickey's fit the bill.  I ended up getting their 2 Meat Plate which consisted of 4 oz of sliced beef briskets, 4 oz of chicken breast, waffle fries, and beans.  All of this was only $10.50, which is a steal of a deal to me.  As for taste, I've had better.  Both the briskets and chicken was a bit dry. However, a huge plus was that both were lower in calories than the other BBQ joints out here.  The waffle fries were also dry and the beans tasted like they were just out of a can.  The kids had good ol' fashion mac n cheese, but good was far from it.  Both teens stated that Kraft Mac N Cheese was better.

Looking for great tasting BBQ, Yelp other places around town or go somewhere else. Looking for quick BBQ and cheap prices, then give Dickey's a shot. 

PS:  Was overcharged close to $10 on both Mac's.  The Manager took care of the issue by crediting my debit card.  My advice, check your bill.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,4,5,3,hP_UvJI9ABYF0PgXTeiMtw

I adore the green beans with bacon side and I usually get a double order. The chopped brisket is the best thing here, followed by the chicken breast.

I've tried a few in Vegas and only like one other place in north Vegas (a small drive through place), but today we decided to try Dickie's for Mother's Day because my mom wanted ribs for lunch. 

We almost decided to go to a chain place, but we knew it was going to be busy. I'm SO glad we decided instead to go here-- a small business, family friendly, clean, fast and super generous spot. 

The employees were amazing! They were so nice, making recommendations, giving us honest opinions/samples about the food, and being very amenable when we changed an order. All 3 employees behind the counter were friendly and went out of their way to ensure we were satisfied. Plus, Sundays, kids eat free! 

I paid about $40 for 3 adults and 2 kids. And we had plenty leftovers. The adults had the 3 meat combo and a rib plate. The baked potato casserole and fried okra sides were awesome. You could actually taste the okra. They weren't over fried and greasy. The fries also were nice--the oil for the fried stuff was not old or overwhelming. 

 Even the kids apologized for thinking they weren't gonna like it. They both had the chicken nuggets and mac & cheese with a drink. For dessert, there's free soft serve ice cream. This place was almost perfect.

 The only thing I didn't like was a huge Ronald Reagan photo on the wall. I'm assuming with the owner. I'm not a republican and not a fan of this racist, classist president. Although all the workers were white and most of the patrons as well, they were all nice. So I hope Reagan is not representative of the politics or bias of the owner.

I was in on Saturday and the daily special was a chopped brisket sandwich, two sides and a big yellow cup (drink).  I ordered BBQ beans and potato salad for my sides.  The entire order was up very quickly.  I was almost disappointed with the apparent size of my meal for the $10 and change I paid.  I was mistaken though.  The sandwich was actually filling on its own.  With the beans and potato salad being as heavy and dense as they are by their very nature, I was more than full when lunch was done.  And it was all good food.  I could taste the smoke in the brisket and it was chopped wel enough that it was easy to eat.  I generally prefer sliced brisket but its not a deal breaker to have it chopped.  The beans were awesome.  Full flavored with a bit of spice.  Mixing in some BBQ sauce elevates them to that next level.  The potato salad was about the most average part of my meal.  There was nothing wrong with it but it didn't stand out in any way either.  Just your run of the mill deli style potato salad.  I might go with another side like green beans and bacon next time.

My office ordered this for lunch. We noticed other departments in our office order from here a lot for meetings and thought we should give it a try too. Dickey's offers online ordering which was convenient for placing a large order. We ordered the largest package which includes three meats, four sides, rolls, and BBQ sauce for about $60. The pricing was reasonable for the amount of food. We did add an extra meat since our office appreciates its meat. :)

Since meat is the main subject of this meal I'll start there. The ribs were flavorful and very meaty. The pulled pork was tender and one of the more simple meats. The hot cheddar sausage was indeed hot and loaded with cheddar cheese. If you like hot and you like cheese you will love this. Lastly, the brisket was a tender meat cut in thin slices. My favorites of the four were the sausage and the ribs.

For sides we chose macaroni and cheese, fried okra (I repeat fried okra!), green beans, and baked potato casserole. The macaroni and cheese was not my favorite because the cheese sauce didn't taste awesome. It tasted like it might have Velveeta in it. The fried okra was one of the highlights. I don't see this offered enough. It was really good, slightly hot with a nice fried breading. I didn't even bother with the sauce that came with the okra because it was unnecessary. The baked potato casserole was good and had plenty of flavor.

The rolls were not the most exciting, but were soft and the perfect vehicle for sopping up extra sauce. The BBQ sauce was also really good and I was surprised at just how much I liked it.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,1,0,4,grz479JF5SEW2MNJBelPRQ

-Never once greeted upon arrival
-Were told to ""stick and move"" - then forgot we had 4 orders and not 3
-Stood at the counter while the order taker kept his head down for 5 minutes before acknowledging we were even standing there
-Ran out of BBQ sauce - how does this happen? I get running out of meat, but sauce?

Just a few of the highlights. Definitely not somewhere I would want to continue to patron. I'd rather spend the gas money and drive across town from Silverado Ranch to John Mull's in North Las Vegas.",J3OIm59Uhfmd0pVVNDd2IA,4,0,2,ypxtzelRzKaFtDJ0IpXFxA
4501992,2010-01-06,0,bzyoY6HHZJS39fspg-6DrA,"If your looking for 'real home-style BBQ', go BBQ at home.

But for strip mall Vegas style BBQ, Dickeys is alright. 

The ribs are decent and the sauce is worth a try. If your a rib snob, try the brisket. If your a brisket snob,  just eat a napkin as a sauce vehicle. I'm sayin' the sauce is pretty good. 

However, If managements goal is to attract less costumers to the restaurant, then they have succeeded thanks to recent changes in their menu. 

I used to get a rib plate and a drink / side for under 9 bucks. 

Now i get a rib plate, and 2 sides. With no drink for over 11 bucks. W?

I just traded my drink for an extra side, for an additional 3 bucks. Do the math. 

But it doesn't take a Mathematician to know that sitting in that place for 30 minutes listening to pop-country, isn't worth the best BBQ in the world for free. 

Another thing that bugs me is the plastic yellow cups. They encourage costumers to take these home, but look inside the trash bin on the way out. Filled with plastic cups. Waste of money.

Aside from this, the place is clean and service is prompt. Also, It is in every restaurant owners best interest to install a self serve ice cream machine. Good call here. Its a great gimmick and it works. 

Advice to stay alive: Hire a business major, kill the PA noise (silence is the savior) and spend less on high-grade plastic cups, charge less for low-grade BBQ.

The problem I have is their service. I think it stems from the fact that they only have ONE cash register to take orders. The person behind that register was extremely slow. In addition, I didn't even get one of the side dishes I ordered! I didn't realize until I got back to work (I took it to go). Fortunately, the place is on my way home, so I stopped by again.

4934554,2011-10-14,0,bzyoY6HHZJS39fspg-6DrA,"Not a bad place to go for the great American epicurean feast of SMOKED meats...I have used this place for both single meals, family meals and even catering for business meetings.

1.  Parking - Strip mall parking, it is what it is. 

2.  Ambiance - Nice sized restaurant, about 21 tables approximately, so usually it can accomodate most busy days.

3.  Food - Very nice overall. The pork ribs, pulled pork, the sausages are awesome. The chicken is nice too.  The sliced beef brisket is very dry, however, I have not had the ""texas"" style chopped brisket which they claim is ""juicy"".  That I will try next.  My kids like the kids menu, the mac and cheese and all the sauces.  Next time, I am trying the ham, the cheese sausage and turkey. I will be back as it is a good priced deal overall.

4.  Prices - I find it overall that the prices are reasonable. Besides all the meal deals and combo's, you are paying roughly 12.00 per pound for the meat, any meat and if you have a large family, the 42.00 XL Combo deal includes 3 lbs of meat, 3 sides, bbq sauce 8 rolls and that is reasonable.  This can feed a lot of people and at least 5 adults.  Be careful though, as if you all order a drink, they do charge 2.00 and that is an additional 10.00. A good deal is that at the exit, they have a soft ice cream maker and you can get a free dessert. That is a good deal.

5.  Service - Interesting. I find some of the cashiers are very friendly and knowledgeable. Some of the servers that deliver your order to your table are also very friendly and hard working. I find that the cooks or food prep people, and even the managers are not as efficient as the cashier or server. I spent 100.00 there in past two days for two group lunches and on the second day, it was take out and I ask for a serving tong, and the manager did not even look at me, but told the cashier ""Well yeah we have them but he has to pay 1.00.""  Why not address me when I am 5 feet away and instead marginalize me by telling the cashier who is right next to me?  Then the cooks had to be reminded by me that they left out the rolls, the extra pound of meat I ordered. Do you think that they were apologizing or service friendly?  Nah. I am concerned as this was a take out order and if I left without checking , it would have been an issue.

Overall, the food is about a 3.5 to 4, and the service from the top, their manager and cook, is about a 2. And, by the way, I actually called used them three months ago, called in an order for a meeting while I was on vacation in Hawaii for a business meeting coming up and you know what, the manager told me to call back when they were less busy.  

For sure i will be back, I just have to be careful to manage what I order to ensure that I am satisfied, since the management here is a bit challenged.

One of the bigger pluses on our visit was that I had an Entertainment Book coupon for BOGO free!  Score!

We both decided on the 2 Meat Plate to maximize on the coupon and the variety of food to try.

* The 2 Meat Plate ($10): Signature Chopped Beef Brisket and Sliced Beef Brisket, Waffle Iron Fries, Mac N Cheese - Although it's their signature chopped brisket, the Husband preferred the sliced one more.  The waffle iron fries could be seasoned too.  The mac n cheese was very creamy though.

* The 2 Meat Plate ($10): Spicy Hot Links and Fall Off the Bone Pork Ribs, Fried Onion Tanglers, Baked Potato Casserole - The spicy hot links weren't all that spicy or impressive, sadly enough.  And the pork ribs were just okay.  We were expecting something different from the baked potato casserole when all it ended up being was mashed potatoes with some fixings.  The onion tanglers were just limp onion rings and were only okay as well.

Both orders came with a bread roll and you can help yourself to dill pickle slices and barbecue sauce.

They also offer Sweet Tea in their signature plastic yellow cups that you can take home.

Ultimately, it sounded like a lot more food but in reality, it wasn't all that much.  

Overall, it was just an okay experience with only okay food.  On the particular day we went, there was a line going out the door because of a promotion they were offering.

The wait to order was very long.  We spent about 15 minutes in line before we got the opportunity to order our food.  Here's what I got:

2 choices of meat and 2 sides for about $10.  After we ordered, the food came super fast!  I got the Texas Style chopped beef brisket and pulled pork with the fried okra and the dill potato salad.  The pulled pork was delicious and nicely smoked.  The brisket was nicely marbleized, but didn't have as much of a smokey flavor as the pork did.  The okra was crunchy and super good!  The dill potato salad was too sour for my taste.  My plate also came with a couple of pickle slices, onions and a butter roll.  The roll was ON POINT!  So light and fluffy!

I think the BBQ sauce tasted nice and sweet.  This places offers free ice cream to all guests.  Not the best BBQ I've tried, but it was good.  Overall a cool southern vibe that makes the experience comfortable.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,3,1,3,mJ5-yQkfSaHxxuUYUPPMSw
5198840,2014-08-19,3,bzyoY6HHZJS39fspg-6DrA,"I expected more from this place even though it's a chain restaurant. I ordered a half a rack of pork ribs and brisket sandwich. The meat on the ribs was dry and had the texture of the kind of ribs you get when you buy a precooked rack of ribs at your local supermarket. The brisket sandwich didn't impress me either. Maybe I just came here on a bad day.

As for the prices they are reasonable, but I can not justify coming back here again for the food. At least the BBQ beans where good, but then again it's hard to mess that one up. 

Famous Daves or Lucilles BBQ is much much better in my opinion. And the best BBQ rib joint in Vegas is John Mulls road kill in North Vegas.",Hze9r06sEb-EXEFPwwBTIA,4,3,2,-477G6Y0UIgJQakdaCRzFQ

No? OK, moving on: a meal will run you about $7. The meats are smoked and tasty and come in a multitude of combinations (the pulled pork was my favorite) and instead of soaking the meat in sauce all day waiting for you, they pull it out of the smoke and cut it up and hand it over to you where you are able to dress it with one of 3 sauces. Also, there's a jar of pickles the size of your wrist on the counter, how good is that?

My Texan was moaning and saying that it tasted just like it did back home, seriously, how can you argue with that?

So pardon me if I don't tear this place to shreds for being imperfect; None of us are, after all. All I know is it was a really friggin' good lunch for a decent price and it put a smile on my friends face.

Fast forward to today. The order taker was beyond weird and I felt like I was bothering him by being here.  The ribs, if you can call them now still, are now tiny and very dry.

Dickey's can not get an order right to save their effing lives.

Every time I've had takeout from there, something has always been missing. Sometimes it's something small, like the onion and pickle that are supposed to come with every platter but only show up about half the time. Sometimes it's something medium and annoying like a missing side. Sometimes it's something mission-critical, like the bacon on a baked potato. They did, however, make sure to include BBQ sauce! With my baked potato, so the bag had a smoked meat aroma that taunted me in the absence of the missing bacon. #fail

It's a shame too, because the food here is actually decent. At $4, those giant stuffed baked potatoes are a great deal. Their BBQ isn't the best I've ever had, but it's certainly good for a quick-service counter joint, and I'd sooner eat here than the flavorless Famous Dave's and the stupefyingly overrated Memphis Championship BBQ. And they get bonus points for serving smoked turkey year-round.

Other good meats include the pulled pork and the hot link. The best sides here are the waffle fries, cole slaw, potato salad and baked potato casserole. The sweet tea is as it should be, and they offer complimentary pickles and soft-serve ice cream, which is a nice value-added touch.

The BBQ sauce is perfectly acceptable but nothing special. They have sweet and hot variants for a little spice of life. I prefer the hot, although I don't think it even has the slightest bit of heat to it.

Bottom line on this place? Decent BBQ, especially for the price, but be sure to audit your order, because the only thing you can depend on with their service is its complete lack of dependability.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,0,2,v1CKRvBCrDqwwimXDLgKxw

-Ham - Asked if I wanted it glazed. Even with glaze and sauce...the worst I've ever had
-Pulled Pork - Dry. Did I say dry? Dry...
-Brisket - Not a bad taste, but a little dry
-Chicken - Ummm...Didn't have any because they were out...

-Roll - Hard
-Beans - Average
-Mac & Cheese - Very ""Krafty""
-Fried Okra - What's the hype? It was ok

I mean all the meat was awful. The ribs were old and had no taste other than wet pork. There was no glazing or any kind of preperation to the meat that would rate as barbecue. The brisket was completely tasteless and had the appearance of sitting on a steam tray for hours. As they do catering, perhaps it was leftover from a recent event.

VERY nice people working there.

Got a half order of ribs ( around 13.00) and some potato salad, and fried okra. This was for two people. Decided to try the cheese sausage. Like I have said before I don't like to eat a lot of pork , so it has to be GOOD when I do. 
The ribs were so-so. A little fatty, sauces all kinda tasted the same. ( sweet , hot and original) The cheese sausage was GREAT. Next time I come I will def order this again.

We tried a piece of pecan pie, was pretty good. 2.50. Not bad at all. 
They have a DIY drink bar with different teas. and BBQ sauces. Thats cool.

Over all its good for sundays,and pool days, when you don't want to cook.

I have been twice now within the span of one month. The first time I ordered the brisket meal with sides of coleslaw and BBQ baked beans. It was good and resolved my hankering for some barbeque.  I really enjoyed their sweet tea.

My second visit I decided on the pulled pork sandwich combo with sides of coleslaw and macaroni and cheese. They were skimpy with the brisket though, I paid $12 for this meal, I expected a little more meat. Their macaroni and cheese leaves a lot to be desired. It is much the same as the processed cheese macaroni and cheese that they serve at KFC. I make a  delicious 50's style macaroni and cheese and if they used my recipe I know they would be tops! It is a common and wanted side that should be really good, I was disappointed with theirs.
