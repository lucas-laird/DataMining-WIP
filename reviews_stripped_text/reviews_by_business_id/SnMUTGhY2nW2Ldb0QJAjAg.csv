the buffet is not one of my favorites, the food is horrible. Soups taste like canned foods, indian food taste frozen, the rice was very dry and hard, Chinese station was okay... I can go on and on how bad it is. 

I wouldn't come back, they charged us 39.99 for this buffet, I think it's more like a 12.99-14.99 type of buffet.",e1e1ckcOnjJvnUKQNBTvSA,4,0,1,ctQYxWAJYbGoN5Hcwx2I2g
89518,2014-09-05,1,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"My husband and I went there for buffet on the opening day August 23 (Saturday). We went at dinner time. The selection of food wasn't very wide but the food tasted good. We liked the prime rib a lot and they have good seafood like cioppino, clam chowder (both red and white), shrimp and crab legs, etc.They also had pasta which tasted good; there are also chinese food, dim sum, and sushi, etc. I took pictures of some food stations so you can check them out. I like their dessert as well, the gelato was awesome, it is tasty, light, not too sensed like ice cream, not synthetic tasting like some other places do. They also have canoli! According to my examination, I  think they used mascarpone cheese instead of ricotta for the canoli filling. (I hate canoli with ricotta cheese as filling). We had a full happy stomach that night. 

We actually sat for long and no one gave us any stink eye. Our server was courteous the whole time, and the food station servers were polite and courteous for my questions and request. I wanted fresh horseradish for my prime rib but there was none at the station. So I asked them about it and they sincerely went to the kitchen to get some for me. 

I hope they will continue to be courteous in the future and not only on the opening day. We will go back again maybe after next year to see if they maintain or even improve the quality. =)",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,6,2,4,qGtgE7F0tlrzeXSxtARBgg

The hot surface plate to keep the food warm neat, only thing lower temp needed on veggies so I don't over cook or burn. 

Like that the long crab legs were split. Services staff was very attentive to there guest. 
 
These are some of the food I liked and the way it was seasoned, shrimp stew or gumbo, chicken stew or gumbo, sword fish, broccolini and whole seafood selection. We can not for get the desserts the brownie and the cookies.

The tables and chairs silverwares plates bread on the table great touch!!!!! I am not a big fan of sushi but my husband loved it. 

The front of house manager walked and check spoke with guest made her self visible.

The price worth the food that's there and plus it keeps the RIFF RAFF OUT!!!! 

This is what's needed at this end of the strips. Don't change a thing just better it!!!!

433155,2014-09-30,0,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"From reading everyone review make me thing I could be wrong. But after trying this over-price buffet I would give it a zero if yelp would allow me. 
For starter, they were under staff on Sunday night. The food selections was EXTREMELY small in portion. Which does not meet the qualification of ALL YOU CAN EAT. They kept running out of foods. I had to go back three times before I got any crab leggs. They ran out of spoon for soup. Had to go back to ask for spoons. In the dim sum section, they was nothing but empt bamboo container. No dim sum. I see everyone else with fried noodles, sushi, pork hash. Yet when you get there. There's nothing left. Like I said I had to go back three time before I got what I want. Not a lot of option on food items on this buffet. The Indian section was poor selection. Cauliflower curry? Really? Not enough flavor in any of the dishes. 
Also it was an hour into my meal before I got my drinks refill, I didn't even know who my server was. The hostess took my drinks order when I got back from getting my foods the first round my drinks was there. 
As for the desert, twenty thumbs down. I got crepes which was poorly made by the pastery maker. The batter was not mix right. Mine look like it's been drop and poke with twenty forks. He had to confident to give it to me. Wow! My mouth dropped. I can't bake. I could of done a better job. I would of been embarrassed to service myself yet someone else with crepes that look like that. I really like the small portion of the deserts but again, it took me forever to find spoons to eat those tastely deserts. The red velvet cupcake was hard as a rock. Everything else was so bland. Not enough flavor, sugars to call it deserts. 
For the price they charge you're better off at Wicked Spoons.. better yet pay the extra $20 more at Bachannal. Get your money worth. I'm a local and I work in travel industry myself. I like to explore different restaurants to recommend to my customers. Unfortunately I would not recommend SLS buffet. I was truly disappointment I was $43 plus tips. The quality of the foods where not there. I can't think one single items I was in wow off that makes me want to go back.",aOEsycZmDUzHLmzN-ycfGQ,2,0,1,AZh6PW3Z4T50wbnlucf2TQ

590703,2014-10-24,0,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"This review is extended because I've had some time to think about how I really felt about it... and there's really a lot to talk about.  

In the sea of buffets in Vegas, there are a few that stand out... Bacchanal at Caesars, Wicked Spoon at Cosmo, and now, the buffet at SLS.

The SLS buffet is not as big as the other two and there's not as much variety, but some of the things that they do well, they do very well.

Before we get into it though, I will mention that they just opened not very long ago, and so I'm sure they are changing and making tweaks every day.

The buffet's variety is limited as I mentioned before.  And at times, it feels unbalanced.  

Ok, let's get to the Chinese section.  Dim sum.  Whose bright idea was it to bring dim sum to Las Vegas buffet?  Was it Bacchanal?  I don't care.  I love it  I can't get enough of it.  I'm from Hong Kong so I know my dim sum and this is legit.  They come in cute individual bamboo steamers too.  I love a good presentation.  Oh, and something about their spring rolls.  They're like crack.  Crispy and the vegetable filling hits the spot.  I'm not sure how many of those I ate.

They had XO Rolled Rice Noodles.  I have never seen that at a buffet before.  This is a very Cantonese dish.  Rolled rice noodles woked with spicy XO sauce.  Delicious and comforting.  And then there's the chow mein.  Ho-hum.  Chow mein.  WAIT!  No, this is no ordinary chow mein.  This is Cantonese style soy sauce chow mein (""soy sauce king"" chow mein).  Clearly, they've got a Cantonese chef back there!  Hello!  I can eat just in the Chinese section of the buffet and be happy.

With that said, there are some very specialized dishes there.  Namely, the pork knuckles and chicken feet.  They're not for me, but I know people who like them.  But I also know far more people who don't... and this might be one of those things that can be sacrificed to make room for more variety.  Even the XO Noodles and soy sauce chow mein are pretty niche in my opinion, as much as I love them.  But I'm not complaining that there's good Canto food here.

Let's move away from my variety issue, and get on to what else they have.  Sushi is well represented here, and surprisingly fresh.  Buffet tuna can often be a little mushy.  But the tuna here has nice texture, and tastes great.  Definitely go get yourself some sushi here. 

The meat station... I tried the prime rib.  I have yet to find a buffet that has decent prime rib which is why I avoid it if I can. But they nailed it.  It was juicy, tender, and well seasoned.  I'm pretty impressed.

Unfortunately I wasn't a fan of the cold seafood station.  Peel and eat shrimp... It was overcooked and having to peel shrimp shells was a pain.  I get that having the shrimp shells on provides more flavor (I often cook shrimp with the shells on myself), but when you overcook the shrimp, the shells won't save you.

The crab legs were good.  On par with Caesars.

Let's move on to the desserts... The good: salted peanut butter ice cream.  It is exactly how I imagined it to be, and it was delicious.

But unfortunately the rest of the desserts were disappointing.  I didn't try their cupcakes and brownies or the many variations of them (blondies).  They just looked dense and heavy, and after a big meal, that's not what I'm looking for.  I did try their tiramisu, and that was pretty sad.  Likewise for their chocolate mousse and cannoli.  The desserts just seemed very one-dimension.

I would have appreciated maybe chocolate dipped strawberries, maybe something tart?  Lighter desserts.   I think they can benefit from a new pastry chef.

Let's talk service.  Service is amazing.  Top notch.  Attentive and friendly wait staff, and the manager was always visible.  Can't ask for more.

So let's go back to my obsession about variety.  During the meal I felt the buffet was missing a station, and I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  I think it might be just snack/finger foods.  As silly as it sounds, one of my favorite things to get at Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal is snacks.  Fries, sweet potato tots, chips... whatever.  Simple stuff, right?

Overall, I had an enjoyable experience, and I know this place can (and will) get better.  I will be back (especially since I have 2 free buffets from their player's club! :)",zpTP5V_53AJyW4ITdi4nBg,9,4,4,sMsbHmBxubPqHeFL8tu-2A

1032772,2014-09-09,0,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,Great buffet! It's kind of hidden-you have to walk down lots of halls and around corners to find. But worth the search :) We went around 11am and it was empty. Tons of different foods to choose from-highlights were the crab legs & shrimp and I loved the dim sum selection. My favorite was the bloody mary bar (extra $12) and all the delicous desserts & pastries. I normally prefer the Mirage buffet but this one is great too if you're staying at the SLS. I don't know if I'd venture to the SLS just to try it though. The other buffets on the strip are just as good and more convenient if you're staying that way.,0NNBYWXPDr_CR3ZoU15NiQ,1,0,4,mVfj9BQoFt0eWPbKoWInEQ
1041524,2014-08-27,0,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"With the opening of the newest casino on the Las Vegas Strip, I took my family out to dinner this evening to give it a try.  I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. I would rate this casino buffet a 8.5 out of 10. 

The selection variety in my opinion falls under 5 categories: Asian, Mediterranean,
Seafood, Italian, + Prime Rib, Chicken, & Pork. Although the variety is not as big as some of the other casinos, they do make up for it in the quality of the food.  Everything that I tasted, was fresh,clean, and vibrant.  I attempted to give as much food as I possibly could a fare taste. I was surprised at how well the Asian & Mediterranean food was prepared as this is not something I usually head for.  

Props to our server Sonny!  He was friendly, courteous, and attentive. While making his rounds at our table, me made an effort to make some friendly chit chat which made our experience a bit more personal.  Being a local here, I know that is not usually found in the casino restaurants/buffets on the Strip. Thanks you Sonny for a job well done!

The Dessert station was pretty nice!  A wide enough variety to fulfill any sugar craving, including the sugar free section! Plus having a crepe station was a welcomed addition. 

There are 3 topics that I believe can use some improvement.  1) the food temp was mildly warm at best, nothing comes to mind as being ""hot"" by the time I returned to our table. 2) the Buffet Execs need to have a sign out front which shows the serving times.  3) At $37 p/p for dinner, it's a bit pricey for the amount of selections you actually have to choose from, having stated this now, they do put out some really tasty food!  Perhaps a few dollars cheaper would make that a bit more in line for the value aspect.

Thanks again Sonny for making our first impression a positive one. We look forward to our next visit!",iSD-cPCUFNfXkCNgTKCz5w,12,3,4,Q3VU9pMg9bv7Umn8LU-WQw

1803773,2014-09-29,0,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"This buffet is definitely off the beaten path and quite a hike from the casino floor, in comparison to the majority of Strip casinos.  Thank goodness my meal was comped through a gaming promotion or I may have been quite disappointed.  

Things got off to a rocky start when they weren't able to find my promo code on my CODE card, even though the CODE rep at the membership desk told me exactly what to do/where to go to redeem.  The wait after paying was about 20-30 minutes, which was extremely disappointing since they only had half of the dining room open.  The hostess ""guarding"" the dining room made it clear that they didn't have enough servers scheduled to open the other half of the dining room.  When I was getting seated, the seating hostess apparently wasn't paying attention to her radio earpiece and tried to seat me at a table set for 4; I was dining alone.  

The selection of items offered on the buffet was pretty good, definitely not the Vegas standard, though.  There were absolutely NO fried foods, which was a really nice change.  I particularly enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken, the sausage flatbread pizza, and both of the pastas that I tried.  The Prime Rib was good, but the wait to get a piece done to my liking was a little frustrating.  The pork dish that was being served at the carving station made me leery, so that went untouched.  There was a great selection of desserts available as well, including gelato and individually plated gourmet desserts.

My service was decent, but my beverage did sit empty twice during the course of the meal.  All in all, it was a good experience, but it will probably be a little while before I try it again - especially with their reduced hours!",fnQ267d2i4eT2wrZ6Xe48w,0,0,3,4EDRtOuN3aW524fUUS5lIQ
1856458,2014-09-13,0,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"I just had dinner at the SLS Buffet with my husband and 6-year-old son and all I can say is WOW.  I should qualify my opinion a bit -- I love Asian food, and my son loves steamed pork buns.  Well, this place hit the spot.  The dim sum selections were hot and tasted freshly prepared.  In fact, everything we sampled tasted freshly prepared.  I usually pass on buffet sushi, but the tuna nigiri and salmon nigiri were melt-in-your-mouth luscious.  My husband sampled the Indian food and pronounced it tasty.

Everything was beautifully presented and the staff working behind the counter were constantly freshening up the buffet.  I felt a bit like a bull in a china shop when I came slopping through, but someone always wiped up after me.

Eclairs were served warm, like someone just made them.  What a treat!  I slipped a cookie in my purse for later.

No one seems to know about this place yet.  Friday night around 7pm and the place seemed only a quarter full.  Hmm.

By the way, we got two free buffets for signing up for a slot card and putting 500 points on it.  Six-year-old got in half price.

I echo another reviewer's comments in saying that service was excellent, from the cashiers, the buffet cooks and servers, the waiters, and the bussers.

2206242,2014-09-28,2,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"The Skinny: meager selection with 2 outstanding items for a regular $30/person brunch or $40/person dinner (2) service/ambience: okay, kind of inconsistent service with bad live music at dinner (2) value: okay if you are a local and take advantage of their 2 for 1 deal...otherwise too pricey for what you get (2)

FYI - they serve Pepsi products here.

We came here to experience the 2 for 1 locals buffet deal. We came in at the tail end of the brunch to take a look at their brunch items and their dinner selection.

Considering the bounty of high end buffets on the Strip, the relatively meager offerings for the price was the first thing that struck me as I checked out the selection. However the main question is does the quality make up for it?

The hubs tried their cold cuts and cheese selection which were a decided pass. The salads were okay while the smoked salmon selection were surprisingly bland. Snow crab legs were plentiful. Oysters and cooked mussels were offered during dinner that I did not try. Checked out their Italian section which consisted of 3 types of pasta (meh) and some really anemic looking pizza.

Sauteed vegetables were not good. Zucchini were cut  haphazardly and too large to cook evenly. Not a fan of the super charred cauliflower. The broccolini with almonds were okay.

The Indian offerings of chicken makhani(poorly spiced, not smoky and not rich enough), cauliflower curry (bland), chicken biryani (dry and scary looking) cannot compare to any standard $11 Indian lunch buffet in terms of quality not to mention price. And this takes up a good amount of space. Sushi was okay - your standard AYCE joint off Strip is still way better due to pre made too long factor at the buffet. The Chinese food was slightly better quality than your regular buffet offerings however still not great. 

For roasted meats, I was surprised that the prime rib was so overdone. The closest to rare was basically medium well. Ribs were too dry.

The only savory thing that was outstanding for me was their Peking chicken (yes, chicken! No duck) The five spice powder/ crispy skin made for a flavorful combination.

During brunch they did have some fruit available however with dinner there was no fruit to be found.

Dessert was a disappointment in general. For the diabetics, there are no sugar free options.Their brownies were more cake like. The peach cobbler used canned peaches with too much nutmeg and it had this really bad greasy pie crust on top. That is not peach cobbler! To be honest I am not sure what to call it. Bread pudding was too texturally mushy while the panna cotta was overly solid.

Cupcakes were a wash. The so-called Boston cream cupcake were plain flavorless yellow cake mix with substandard chocolate frosting. No custard or pudding....WTF? Red velvet with cream cheese frosting was also quite bad and rather bland. Yeah, don't ask me how that happened but there it is.

The crepe batter was weird. Not enough butter and eggs made for a poorer texture. The cold goopy caramelized bananas did not help as well and would have been better just cut fresh. The crepes themselves were misshapened and relatively uneven in thickness.

The ice cream/gelato selection was limited to about 6 flavors of which none were really worth going back for (tried Nutella, mint chip, strawberry, cookies and cream). Artificial and icy in texture, Haagen Daz or Talenti from the supermarket tastes better.

The best thing here was the fried mini donuts with cinnamon and sugar. Light and crispy, we waited an hour into dinner service before this was available. Glad we waited for it.

Our server was quite good in the beginning however she was slow to refill glasses and remove our plates after about an hour. Seeing as how the restaurant was only 50% capacity, it was kind of weird. Ambience wise, they brought out some bad live music performer who did crappy covers of Eric Clapton and George Michael during dinner service. Unfortunately it was rather loud especially when he failed to hit the high notes.

Given how we paid half price, the experience was okay for what we paid. However at full price? Definitely not worth the price of admission. Considering your plethora of options out there, I would rather pay more for a better quality product. Instead making rather poor renditions of various ethnic food that is done better and cheaper elsewhere, they should really focus on improving the quality of their basics first (ie, roasted meats, pizza, pastas, ice cream offerings) and add a few kid friendly items like a really good macaroni and cheese.

The buffet shows signs of struggling as they now only open 3 days a week (Friday-Sunday). I guess that is why they are offering 2 for 1 for locals. As much as I'd like the new kid in town to succeed, I still would have to give it a 2 star review in comparison to much better options around town.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,8,3,2,1IN1qVT56imXzL4WtcpQ0g

Well the SLS buffet doesn't have that kind of journey as before but still it's a some what a walk from the main casino. Maybe it's not such a bad thing. 

The hours and days are weird for a Vegas buffet. They only do brunch and dinner Fri, Sat, and Sunday. The prices are decent especially if you have a Nevada ID and sign up for the CODE card, 2 for 1 prices.

The interior is nice very nice. The selection and presentation of the food are also nice however some of the food seemed like it was sitting out for awhile. The plates are small. 

The crepe station was nice except it was poorly made. The fresh made waffles were nice except the guy making them didn't know how to use the waffle maker, it was funny watching him break the machine and see the batter spill out. The fresh made donuts were also nice but when it's slow, which it was, seemed like they made to much and when I wanted them they were cold and hard. Liked the seafood selection there were oysters, shrimp, crab, various salmons, sushi, etc. They had dim sum served in individual steamers. The meats weren't the greatest but they had a good selection prime rib, ribs, chicken, etc. During brunch they have fresh made to order omelets.

I hope whoever is in charge of SLS and their buffet reads into not just Yelp reviews, but any type of feedback they can access to.

Personally, I don't think it's the location that made SLS Buffet version1.0 a failure. I mean, look at the other popular buffets locations in other hotels on the strip. Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon buffet comes to mind. Isn't their location out in the boonies? Or look at Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet. They, too, also have to take an escalator to get to their buffet area. All in all, it's really the  QUALITY and VARIETY of what you bring to the table (literally). 

Once entering into the buffet dining area, I noticed a change of...theming. All of a sudden....I thought I was eating at some restaurant in the cabin/woods. I thought I even saw some deer or buffalo heads mounted on the walls??? =/ What the...?! Tables looked very picnic-esque. 

Also, it felt like just because it was the last night, employees were slacking....or they simply just don't give a F%*# anymore. Case in point: soup section. Here I am....seeing two different types of chowders all dried and crusted. But my crazy ass still wanted to give it a try. Okay but um...where are the spoons?? I told the girl that was behind the counter they were out of soup spoons. She said okay and disappeared. I waited for 5-7 minutes. There was no sight of her. I'd still be there waiting if they didn't close this place down. So I drank my soup like a barbarian...basically I slurped it up. LOL! And omg...it tasted like it was STRAIGHT FROM A CAN and it was probably two days old. I was horrified.

Nothing looked fresh. They labeled some chicken to be curry chicken. I thought, great! I'm a big fan of curry. Once I got to my table, the chicken was 100%  NOT curry!!!!!! It was full on tomato sauce chicken. WTF!? Ugh...disappointed once more.


Seriously, QUALITY, QUALITY, QUALITY, SLS. I'm glad we went when they had a 2 for 1 locals special. Don't charge a general price of $40 per person for dinner when really....tourists WILL go to somewhere that's at least 3x better; even if they have to pay an additional $10. 

Charging Wicked Spoon pricing for a Station buffet. Wow. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?!",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,9,7,2,e4vRJXexJ8Uyym6l-GS44A
2677491,2014-09-28,0,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,My husband and I went to the buffet on a Thursday night. It's located on the 2nd floor. ..kinda secluded. I could smell the aroma of fresh doughnuts down the hall. The buffet is a bit pricey about 40 a person but we're locals so we got a buy one get one! The selection isn't as large as most buffets but the quality was on point!!! The food was very flavorful. .even the pizza..so darn good! I loved the pasta and the grilled cauliflower with bacon yum! They make there own pastries...I wanted to take some cookies n cream Gelato with me and the gave me a to go cup and filled it up:) One of the guys working named sonny was so friendly and he talked with us for a bit...thank you sonny for making a great night more memorable!

2873126,2014-09-16,0,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"This is my new favorite Buffet.  Reminiscent of the Wicked Spoon Buffet at Cosmopolitan.   I went twice in 2 days! That says something because  of all the food places in Las Vegas I chose the SLS Buffet; not once but twice in a 24 hour period.

The food is fresh and bursting with flavor and  appears to be prepared in small batched rather than mass produced and is served tapas style. My favorites where the variety of grilled veggies.  

The meat selections were well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  I saw the crab legs and prawns and they looked fresh and seemed to be quite popular.

They also brought over a bread basket but I did not partake.

The service was a little on the over kill side.  They were VERY helpful and asked constantly if there was anything we needed (even if I was mid sentence) but my glass was never empty and the dirty plated were cleared promptly. So to complain about too much service, seems silly.

Make sure to save room for dessert because their desserts are wonderful.  Warm cookies, fresh crepes, freshly made donuts and gelato.

It's pricier than some buffets and and less expensive than others.  I thought it was worth every penny and I look forward to going back.",wlvyqW9J2ivNj-9lW0pkUw,1,0,4,zVqzdHG7qrWxnHmuXZlmuQ

Smoked salmon with capers, lightly salted shrimps and snow crab legs, very fresh and tender, I mostly just ate those with some grilled brocolis, I just wanted a very light brunch.

Other stations I have browsed by:
Breakfast items
Salads and Pizzas
Assorted Cheese and Cured meats
Cooked seafood 
Dim sum 
Sushi
Roasted beef
Baby back ribs
Roasted Chicken and Duck
Desserts 

I didn't have any of those, hubby liked the roasted beef, pork dumplings and shumai, duck and chicken were okay. 

There was no line at all, otherwise I wouldn't have agreed to eat buffet, only $30ish per person, good valued brunch. If you only like crab legs, it will do for you, for other things? Not so much.

Upon walking down the buffet line, you realize that the dishes make sense and complement each other...it's like the chef is telling you a story, and it's a delicious journey!

The buffet doesn't have the varied selections like Bacchanal or Bellagio, but it has its own personality. There could be more cold options, but the meat and cheese display is fantastic! I love soups, and there was an abundant selection of soups...4 types if you count the cioppino.

The prime rib is fantastic. It beats Wicked Spoon hands down, and it's perfect! The seasonings are excellent, the meat is naturally tender and the flavor is exactly the way prime rib should taste...heaven!

The crab legs were kind of unimpressive; and the shrimp cocktail was slightly overcooked but seasoned well. The seafood boil was overcomplicated, and the oysters were standard fare.

I was a bit confused with the Indian cuisine...I remember when Aria tried to do Indian, but Aria had delicious naan bread!

The best section was the Chinese section...it felt like an authentic dim sum restaurant! Chicken feet, pork knuckles, and other tasty Asian treats. Most impressive!!!

We got to meet Adam, the GM of the SLS Buffet. What an awesome guy! Service was good because of Adam. Adam explained the concept, decor, and the whole thought process. There is so much potential for this place!

Now, if you were ever at the buffet when it was the Sahara, I am so sorry.  I made that mistake once and never again.  There was a reason they were doing dinners for $6.99 lets leave it at that.  As part of my wanderings I went past the buffet and the delicious smells made me decide to give it a go.  

They did not move or add any stations from the old Sahara buffet but they did update them and the food is on the complete opposite end of the scale from the old.  Everything I tried there was either very good or excellent.  It is small compared to a lot of the other strip buffets but it still has a decent variety.  

They had both the large platters to serve yourself and small plates available for other items.  They also offer their signature cocktails in a menu on the table along with beer and wine for purchase.  My server was friendly and attentive and so were the others from what I could see.  

Was it a bit on the expensive side for what was available? Yes, which is why I only gave it three stars.  I got there just before they switched to dinner so I paid the brunch fee of about $33 with tax.  If you wanted champagne you could do a bottomless glass for an additional $12 but it did not come with the brunch.

A loooong walk to Buffet from Casino.

We received BOGO with Players ""Code"" card @ local id, $40 for 2.
I believe can also get BOGO if a Hotel Guest?

You be the judge whether this buffet is worth the regular price of $40?

It's a very small buffet, yet Not crowded at all for a Friday night. Very few people there.

I would suggest a walk through before paying because the selections are very limited & may not be to your liking?

Because we were within 1 hour of closing, the food items were not refreshed/maintained. 

Funny, but the Rice with chicken layered on top was refilled/refreshed about 9pm.
But was mostly without (only a few pieces) chicken from the time we got there. 
Rather than mix the chicken in, they lay the pieces of chicken on top. 
So people pick the chicken off the top with little rice & leave a pile of rice.

No Salad Bar to speak of.
Skinny Crab Legs, kind of not worth the effort? Pictures of Crab Legs look bigger/better than in person.

No great selection of items to speak of.

Sushi was decent. Very good rice compared to most buffets.

Dessert selection & freshness was very good.

It was ok-good for the $40 BOGO.

LOCAL SPECIAL
if you make the players card and go to the buffet it is 2 for 1 price special.  I paid $33 and change(including tax) but please do not forget to tip your servers for price of two NOT discounted price. 

Staff: They were very nice, courteous, and had common sense.  They were little bit slow from my standard but I am bit harsh on those rules.

Kitchen Staff: NEVER put your back on your station and chit chat with your coworker!

Food: Mediocre quality food and nothing really special about the items. it was like local casino $10-15 selections or less but little better quality.  

Crepes, Pancake station, waffle station - (made to order.)  They also had omelette station who just made crappy omelette that was just folded egg fries.  Crepes were dried probably because heat was too high it was just drying them.  Pancakes were decent, Waffles under cooked. 

Meat Section - BBQ and Roasted ham, chicken, brisket, ribs.  Brisket was extremely dry.  

Other buffet Items: I guess they were okay but most of the foods were bit dry when we were eating.  

********Brunch had $12 per person for unlimited alcohol drinks, mimosa, bloody mary, house wine, and draft beer. (Mimosa and Bloodymary was premade so mimosa had no fiz bubbly wully.)  

Service: Fantastic plates were removed quick, asked for refill, did great job explaining about other services.  It was a great experience.  I think 3 stars are mostly reflected on service part of the whole experience.  

You really do get what you pay for($15 per person with local special) but $30 per person for brunch is over reach.  I think local special is only way for you to enjoy this place.

However, the dessert area was exceptional for lunchtime. They had crepes, cereal, waffles, and parfaits. This beat the lunch selections ten times over. I will say, though, that the yogurt used in the parfait was way too sweet. It was close to being sour.

First time around the service was atrocious. Second time the service was excellent. Some lazy people on staff and some really good ones.

On both occasions the place was empty (on the weekend)...this creates a problem because you want the food to be fresh...dry rice on the sushi rolls, extremely dry basmati rice in the Indian section.

The selection is small for a $40 buffet and if I were paying regular price I'd be pissed.

The prime rib was decent and rare just how I like it. The snow crab is cut for you so minimal work (although it was on the salty side).

Crepe station was nice, although the first time I went the guy burned my crepe and still served it to me, it was dry and crackly...shoulda been throw out and restarted. They have warm cookies and molton lava cake...add some vanilla gelato to hit the spot.

Panna cotta wasn't set correctly, kind of drippy.

The asparagus was overcooked.

The sushi section is ""ok"" for buffet sushi. Just pluck the strips of salmon off the rice mound to make it more than ""ok"". 
No ""Must Eat All Rice"" policy here.

They had the exact same food out for dinner 3 weeks ago as they did tonight so don't expect anything to change if you revisit.

3 stars because I had a 2 for 1.

To pay $40/person though is ludicrous, this is NOT a high end buffet.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,7,3,3,a1_BiXKuwKFyWZZ4rwvEzw

5240128,2014-09-06,0,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"Hotel just opened last week, so this buffet is brand new. So place is still very clean. I tried the brunch, cost per person  $31 plus tax. 

Service is good. Staff is friendly and very attentive, which always a plus these places. 

Food selection,  I feel they need to add more selection or spread.   Flavor is good though . I am comparing to  My favorite buffet which is Wicked spoon, next is Bacchanal. 

I think we need to come back for dinner. This place looks promising.",2SLzz7CHvmVMhKuISyqKtQ,0,2,4,tiPTUmhyWNEBvyjmDk5NNQ

Being that it's $40 for dinner and they still have no clue which market to go after, I can see why there's no line, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go.

Yes, the selection isn't great (forget making a simple salad) but everything I tried was really good, especially the crepes and gelato.

If you're a local, it's 2 for 1, so that makes the sticker shock a little easier to handle.

Don't think I would go back unless I had another comp or the price comes down, but it was nice to go try it out.",DR6dNFhKppNrSyRZn1CWLg,0,0,4,lbUnMUCGVX8p6I5n9oRi7Q

Beautiful decor,  Friendly staff , handsome managers & great food.  Must spend the extra $12 for the unlimited bloody mary and mimosa!  crepe station was a lovely touch you don't see everywhere. Love great customer service, so when manager greets us & asks how we are doing. ...it's a big plus.  Can't wait to come back for dinner.",MKPyT6McTEGdtVIHXx6MQg,0,0,4,KnoVp6RZXdwwsrGl_Z0eNQ
5545341,2014-09-18,0,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"Pretty much what a lot of other people are saying, the food tastes pretty good, but there isn't a very big selection. I think the price is too high, $37 for tuesday dinner, should be about $10 less compared to the other $40 buffets on the strip. I don't see this as a destination buffet. The food was tasty, especially the ribeye steak, but after the first plate didn't get much the second plate because not too much selection. A good portion of the buffet is for asian food, but i come to vegas to eat meat and seafood, not chinese food. 
     Our server was pretty slow, and since this is a new buffet they're still learning. Lemme first say, our server had a really good attitude and was really friendly, and he was haulin' ass. I think his technique is not efficient though. Its like a cocktail waitress on the casino floor who takes everyones order at once and comes back with all the orders. So you wouldn't see the server for like 10 minutes. He should serve a couple of the tables at a time instead of the entire section. 
     So overall the food tastes good but limited selection. Probably wouldn't come back unless they lowered the price or had a coupon or comp.",c0OkIu5MrOYowcTqiBXGrw,1,0,3,pqB0ZnfvzW_KdCVvR7Nuog

It was also very inexpensive and had no wait whatsoever. I presume that is why they closed - the location was harder to see and not in a prime spot of the casino, so it probably did not get enough foot traffic. Bummer!",ibvH1Y7Rh_tstiWgH0OFTA,1,1,4,_96nwXvnI2IdTv0RFwJ-8w

5918751,2014-08-24,12,SnMUTGhY2nW2Ldb0QJAjAg,"They (countless Internet people with sexy six-pack abs I follow on Twitter & Instagram) say that the secret to having a six-pack abs is not the workout sessions at the gym, but mostly (let's say 75%) because of what you eat.  With that said, all the gym rats and fitness minded folks with goals of obtaining or maintaining their six-packs, you do not have to avoid the SLS Buffet... on your cheat day.

The rest of the people that are normal (even extra normal) and more well rounded (pun intended) in the waistline department, come as often as you like (Note: You can earn 2 complimentary SLS Buffet passes with 500 slot points).  Having a few meals here will definitely help you maintain your corpulent rotundness, making you just that much more beloved by Jenny Craig. 

So I know I been watching what I eat recently. So if it wasn't for the SLS grand opening and the ""obsession?"" to check out new places and leave a trail blazer report for the rest of the Yelp Pals, my better judgement would have grounded me and kept me on my granola with dried blueberries diet.  But I suck at being rational when it comes to food and women. So here I am at home now, writing my review.

First of all, SLS being the latest casino property to open to the general public in LV (as of Aug 23, 2014), with nice modern facelift to update what used to be the Sahara, of course has a modern looking buffet.  It is not huge or fancy like Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, but it is still way better than the one at the Palms.  On opening weekend, the dinner is $40.  So it is not cheap. But still in the same ballpark as the rest of the also ran buffet contenders.

The dining area and also the serving stations look pretty good.  The decorations seems (okay, not gonna sugar coat it), is half complete for the serving stations.  The shelves above is only decorated on about 60% of the buffet (Asian dim sum section to just past the mid point (carving station). Not sure if it was a budget thing, or not getting in all the decorations elements (enameled cast iron cookware), but the bulk of the decoration is noticeably lopsided. Not a big thing, and will not affect the quality of the food served, but it is just one of those attention to details thing.  The seats and tables in the dining area is comfortable and spaced well, so you do not feel cramped or boxed in (Good job!).

The buffet has the usual snow crab legs, some fresh clams, cooked shrimp, prime rib carving station (prime rib was good), dessert station (it is a large island of baked goods, not too much variety though, with some special highlights I will discuss later), a large Asian & dim sum section.  But overall I was not really impressed.  No serious WOW factor. But it is not terrible either.  Pretty A-Okay,with definite room for easy & significant improvements.

Let me cover what I do like about this buffet.

* Layout of the savory stations is straight forward. No lines per say to wait, just go in for the prize, wherever you see what caught your gleaming eyes.
* Plenty of large plates on the bottom shelf for you to pick up and pile on your build your own feast.
* Small portions available for self service, which is refreshed with newer back ups. So you get fairly fresh dishes throughout your meal.
* The line was very short. Hardly any wait, but you do have to look for the buffet or wonder successfully to this part of the SLS property.

* Fresh fried doughnuts tossed in cinnamon sugar. [Highlight of the meal]

* Dried Blueberries [Not sure what you would eat this with, but I was happy to just snack on these plain]
* Sushi was fresh.
* Pastas are all good.
* Gelato was tasty & serving was generous (compared to all the buffets I tried further south of SLS).

Could be better:

* Crepe maker's skill is really at the novice of novice level.  I think he is dreading it, and it shows in the final odd shaped product. The batter is spread thin and overcooked in sections, while thick and under-cooked in others.
* Crepe station ingredients are not stored properly for service or needs to be reformulated. (Chocolate and Nutella are so thick you can't portion it let alone make designs with them. Mixing it with 10% oil or holding it at higher temperature (melting point) would make more sense.
* Dim Sum section has great variety but sometimes you just like a lot of shumai (just an example). So should I leave with 3 bamboo steaming baskets or just consolidate right there.
* Dim sum portions for some items seems too big (chicken feet, the steam buns), I know I opted out, since I don't want to waste food.
* Steamed Basmati rice was dried and crusty. Maybe smaller portions is better or have a cover for it.
* Dessert selections is fairly limited. It looks full, but the same desserts are scattered on almost all sides of the large dessert island.

For $40 (weekend dinner) I thought it was okay, and worth checking out for the sake of checking it out (even some SLS employees agreed).  $30 is a no brainer. $35 is a toss up. 3 stars!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,19,13,3,vljS8vcTlZhUG9DX9PZzDg
