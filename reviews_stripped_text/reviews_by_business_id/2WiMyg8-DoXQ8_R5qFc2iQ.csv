Today was their soft opening, I tried their make your own bowl, which was the best I've had by far. The ingredient choices were diverse and great. After my lunch I went back to work and had to run a service call as I do air conditioning but the whole day I was fantasizing about another poke bowl. I returned for dinner. Had another great meal.

Service: Nice pleasant staff I give 4 stars.

Food Quality: Tops, fresh and full of flavor there are items in the menu I haven't seen at any other poke like the lemon bites which make the whole meal better wow. I rate 5 stars for good quality.

Portions: large I was full afterwards and I can eat. I Rate 5 stars.

Cleanliness: 5 Stars 

Overall I'll drive to eat here. Will recommend and return.",xMKXkBWyohOA8_Z_W0AaNA,3,0,5,_0gGUP2kI_RV6Z-LuX4HRQ

When I walked in no one greeted me and my husband we were ready to walk out when finally a young guy took our order. They had a handful of staff and they all seemed like they didn't know what they were doing walking back and forth and never greeted anyone or explain it was a soft opening. I've never had a poke bowl before and I didn't know exactly what to order so I ordered the wrath bowl. The lady just served me rice and tuna and was ready to charge me and I asked her what about the fixings it says it comes with, she apologized and said they didn't have half of the things so she only put avocado and cucumber, it was very plain.

When we walked in it smelled like fish, which immediately put me off. I went out of my way to make sure I chose fish that was cooked to out on my burrito. One of my choices of protein was the crab. I thought it was tossed in some kind of cream sauce when it was scooped up. 
It was mayonnaise. The mayo was so strong I couldn't taste anything else in my burrito. It over powered everything and was just gross!!  
I'm so disappointed!  I don't recommend. 

Update after comment from management: I didn't get yum yum sauce, so holding it on the side won't fix the fact that the crab had an overwhelming amount of mayo in it.",zrcDKyuZzFEBiGK-gFKGkA,0,0,1,Cqx642nUCKr8_Bj29SAmzA

What's even more frustrating is I didn't have cash, so I tipped 20%. In total I paid $18 for a salad that wasn't right.

The Dragon Poke bowl is sooooo bomb. All the flavors just perfectly melt into each other. 
I sub out seaweed salad for the pineapple (because eww). But next time I mosey into here, I'm going to sub edamame for the red onion.

Five stars for having a vegan ""set"" menu. 
Us veg heads LOVE this kinda shit so we don't have to ""build-shit-by-customizing-the-whole-world-of-vegetables"" and look like some picky asshole. 
It will just turn into a bland dumb salad and not be cool...thus we shall return again and again to try our very own special menu. We love that. Yes I am speaking for all vegans in the whole wide world...


I really like that Ginger Twist Sauce.

This is considered a cheat day for me because I'm pretty sure there is metric ton of oil going on...like even the brown rice seemed oily to me. Carb up is fine but I can do without all that oil sheesh! It's sesame oil to be exact.

The smiling young lady asked to ""sauté"" swirl twirl my tofu around in a bowl of Ginger Twist Sauce to marinate and of course I said ok! Hell yes do it all fancy, marinate the hell out of those tofu bean squares! But I think next time I will opt for the sauce on the side because its oil.

I love how she offered 1/2 greens 1/2 brown rice...but next time I will pass on the rice because I personally think its too oily.

At the end I asked to add that crispy garlic to keep those sexy vampires away. I always love that fried garlic at these places...but I regret it later...I'll never get vamp'd at this rate. Darn.

You can add a tip (it will ask you the %) to your card transaction.

The first two times I went the service and food were okay but it was only a few weeks after opening. In my mind I assumed this is because staff is new and getting familiar with the process. However tonight when I went in it was the exact same thing. Not only is three scoops of protein equivalent to one scoop of just one protein everywhere else, they charge extra for veggies and everything else you can think of. So I told the kid, go ahead and add some edamame for the extra 50 cents or whatever it was. He did an even smaller scoop then the first free one. When I asked him, to keep putting more he gave me the dirtiest look. I'm honestly really disappointed that this is the closest poke bowl place to my house because I will not be returning. The only good thing about this place is their spicy mayo sauce. Hence the two stars. Why oh why is Jaburritos so far from me? Sigh!",u9V-FZZAkP2DyW99YJ4UVg,0,0,2,hRO3-iQnhJDrxij9mzVDvw

The menu is decent but when you go to order.....their verbiage can make it confusing. For example, choosing the toppings, I asked how many toppings can I get without extra charge. The answer was confusing. It was something to the effect of I can choose all of them but for any extra topping it's an extra cost. Ok so what does that mean? After some clarification, I can choose any toppings or all of them, but if I want to double up on the same topping it's more $. Same goes with how much protein I can choose. It's up to three choices for protein. The verbiage should be more clear and on the menu as well. The guy who helped me mumbles and talks under his breath so I could hardly hear him. Plus if you're short (which I am not) you would have to speak over their tall glass sneeze barrier. Over all it's clean, nice and a decent portion size for $14 with my Arizona can tea.

THINGS I LIKE:
+ This is the only place like it to offer significant vegan options. There are five or six options on the menu you can have as bowls or wraps, instead of doing the DIY route with all the veggies and then having to guess about the sauces. Major pro!
+ Nice topping selection, including shredded carrots and radishes, fresh herbs (cilantro!), pineapple, and ""lemon bites""!  Haven't seen this elsewhere. And I love their crispy garlic. They also have ice cream macaron sandwiches.

However... over time, there appear to be consistency issues. Protein portion varies, and the signature bowl options aren't the best. You're better off customizing, better value. Service is also hit or miss, with super friendly staff (like Kim) and others who barely say a word. And as others have said, some ingredients don't match the description- like red onions being described as ""sweet onions,"" for some reason.

The ingredient selection was good and the flavors were great. I feel the fish portions were a bit small compared to other places like this and I didn't think the spicy seafood options needed to be mixed with the offered sauces.  However, an offer of sauce for the top of my base would have been great as it was a bit dry without it. I realize that today was their first day open and they will work out the kinks in time.

I see your preset menu BOWLS for 7 Original sins.  Well geez, sinful addiction to poke fish sounds a little contradictory, but we'll leave the discussion out.  Most likely this is forgivable.

While there is no preset menu for a build your own bowl or Sushi BURRITO, it can be done!  Just say it.  

In case you kinda wanna try my burrito, it has these ingredients: Seaweed wrap: ahi, salmon, yellowtail, cucumber, masago, avocado, cilantro, red onions, seaweed salad; sauces: spicy mayo and wasabi ranch.

Nice system: writes on trays for bowl orders
Always clean: tables, chairs, fountain drink area
Service: still new - learners doing good so far

THEY'RE STILL HIRING!  Get your skills big kids :)

BYO salad bowl:
Yellowtail, salmon, spicy tuna (They give 2 scoops of this)
Toppings: Avocado, masago, Seaweed salad, cucumbers, red onions, cilantro
Signature sauce (great spice), cilantro jalapeno

Sooooo next poke craving in Summerlin, I'll hit you up with my addiction stamp card.  And by the way, the new workers... you'll do fine after some routine experience.  Best to you kids!

Note: CANNOT combine 50% off regular bowl with your Yelp review, with the stamp card; either for new stamps or use of card.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,28,29,5,qBVxYnF5RpMbIDpgDldeVA

They have 7 signature dishes, or you can build your own. All made right in front of you. You choose a base (including white or brown rice, tortilla chips, all kinds of options), then your protein in 3 or 4 oz sizes. MANY to choose from. I chose 4 oz of Ahi. Then choose your sauce, again MANY to choose from (including Teriyaki, Garlic, Ginger, too many to list), and I chose Poke. Then you choose your toppings. I had  ginger, pineapple, scallions, avocados, sweet onions, carrots, lemon bites, and cilantro. They also had edimame, chick peas, corn, broccoli, mango, and mushrooms, plus many more. Then you can choose from 4 different spice toppings, or a combo of all four, which I had. The rice was perfect and warm. The ahi, and poke sauce were awesome with all the toppings I chose, and the topping spices were  delicious. Very reasonably priced at $12.94 which included tax. The food prep area was immaculate and very organized and tidy. The while store was immaculate, including seating, condiment area and soda fountain. I didn't use the restrooms. Nice pop music in background, not too loud. They have a punch card after 10 punches you get your next bowl for 99 cents, and March is double punch month. I also noticed s sign that said ""Happy Hour 2-5pm where you can get a free Miso Soup it one scoop of Thrifty Ice Cream. I didn't partake, but pretty cool nonetheless.

The combination of yellowtail, cucumber, sweet onion, masago, avocado, pico de gallo, lemon bites, furikake, creamy wasabi sauce, ponzu garlic sauce was good mix of savory flavors with acidity, sweetness, and some mild heat.

There's a huge board that shows a selection of pre-made poke bowls (named after the 7 deadly sins??? So strange/what's the theme?) and a section that walks you through creating your own bowl. Also, I had no idea they sold fruit drinks or anything other than poke bowls till the very end when I paid for everything. I was offered a tiny watermelon/cucumber sample at the end.  

Drew was my server who created the bowl, very nice and patient with me, honestly the 1 star is just for him. He seemed to be the only one actively connecting with customers and actually guiding those confused.

The bowl itself was just bleh... the presentation was alright because drew actually made it look presentable. I was there with my friend and her bowl honestly looked unappetizing and she was visibly dissatisfied with everything during checkout//dinning in. Not really anything here that makes me want to come back. I compared this to ""To See Roll"" and just the atmosphere itself separates them.

Every time I go to a poke place, I usually steer towards the bowls. I've probably tried every bowl all over Vegas. And this is hands down my favorite one. First of all, their rice is warm. Idk about you but I think it makes everything better.... the fish itself (I had ahi tuna, spicy tuna, and yellow tail) it was fresh af. And the topping that stood out to me the most is the fact that they have diced pineapples as a topping. What?! I don't think there's any other place that has offered that. If they have, I've overlooked them. 

This is a place -- I would definitely make the drive for. Seeing how I live in the southwest side of town and this is up north ish. Y'all need to try this place. Forreal though. You won't regret it! Promise. (:",0g6iEeYOujmIT7tFdECLwg,4,0,5,rCoXyS3FQJ25J4-m-xSWGg

I ended up ordering the Lust bowl. I did appreciate the choice between white or brown rice and how friendly the staff member was who helped me was. The fish and shrimp were good and fresh, but the rest was kinda meh. Way too much rice and not enough meat & also it was super dry.

This poke place is located in the same shopping center as Whole Foods, and Edible Arrangements on Lake Mead and Tenaya. We were the only customers when we walked in at lunch time. And they had 3 employees manning the counter and the 1 chef in the kitchen. Service was soooo slow and lots of mistakes on my food.

I ordered a Wrath Poke Bowl with brown rice. It's supposed to have salmon, spicy tuna, edamame, cucumbers, sweet onion, lemon, avocado, rice puffs, and cilantro jalapeño sauce. I was given tuna instead of salmon, and I didn't get rice puffs in my bowl. The guy preparing my food took 10 minutes reading from a list and still messed up! I watched him put one edamame at a time. Portions were very skimpy. The onions were red not ""sweet onions"". The fish was not that fresh and they were small pieces like they don't really want to feed you but they just want to take your money.  

I also got the Sloth Sushi Burrito. I've had better. Honestly, the only thing that was good here was the fruit water/ juice. I tried watermelon and that was pretty refreshing.

The employees look scared/ stressed and I don't know why when the place was empty. They didn't seem happy to be here. No smiles, no nothing. Needless to say, I won't be rushing to come back even to redeem my 50% discount after writing a Yelp review offer that they have.
