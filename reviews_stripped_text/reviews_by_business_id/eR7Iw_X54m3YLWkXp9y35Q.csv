It was bright inside which was a bit too much. I think the place would be better with better lighting IMO. Overall not bad.

Hubs and I both ordered the Tonkatsu sandwich, which comes with a nice side of Japanese potato salad (didn't know there was such a thing), and a bowl of miso soup. Little man (4 y.o.) had the karaage chicken.

Service was fast and nondescript. 

Each guest gets a mortar and pestle to grind up sesame seeds for their katsu sauce - gave us something to do while we waited for our food and was a fun activity for little man.

The Tonkatsu sandwiches...huge, tender, and just the right amount of crispness. Japanese potato salad...pretty tasty, coming from someone that doesn't like apples (has small chunks in the potato salad). And yes, weird I'm not a fan of apples. 

Good miso soup, nice flavor and didn't seem like it came from instant miso packets; seemed like the same quality you get at sushi restaurants. 

Karaage chicken...not as tasty, but this is in comparison to the tasty as heck Tonkatsu. Little man seemed to like it though, basic enough to order for kids. If your little one is a picky eater, just ask that they put the chicken on a separate plate because the order usually comes with a little salad and places the chicken on a bed of cabbage. The actual katsu entree portions looked huge, so next time I'll probably just share an entree with little man. I could barely get thru the sandwich! 

We'll be back!!",rA6NyEcAKLzD8PWPF7caNQ,0,0,5,zDQeiGLeFm3KVbHDMoee2w

The portions of the main meal was also decent. You get a nice big piece of katsu along with the rice and miso soup and it really fills you up. However their side dishes are a little overpriced. They taste really good but the price is just too high for the quantity you get.

If you've been to L&L or any other Hawaiian joint, you have probably had the tough, greasy, heavy chicken katsu. THAT is not real tonkatsu. It should be light, moist, crispy, and flavorful. That is exactly what you get here. They have different options such as pork, chicken and salmon. They also have curry tonkatsu, which is what I ordered. Omg. It was amazing. The curry was so flavorful and creamy while the pork tonkatsu underneath was light and tender. They also give you a mortar and pestle which I was a bit confused about since the waitress did not explain what it was for, but with a quick glance around the dining room, I realized that it was to crush the sesame seeds for the tonkatsu sauce! It was actually a bit fun to do because honestly, how often do you get to grind sesame seeds?! The katsu sauce was amazing as well. 

I seriously crave their tonkatsu every day because it's soooo scrumptious. Their menu isn't very extensive, but it doesn't need to be because you know that every single item is delicious.",_1v9g99OAWJJlQPOcYNuFw,0,0,5,QOZ1EFtWfTRLpG7N7JOfVQ

The miso soup was solid and the seaweed salad was perfect (fresh, crunchy, great dressing).  The sesame that you grind on the spot for yourself added a fresh flavor to the excellent tonkatsu sauce.

 I have had Curry Katsu, which is nice portion of steam white rice, curry sauce, and of course the pork tenderloin Katsu. It is always cooked perfectly and the portions are large. 
I have also had the Salmon and Shrimp Katsu, Chicken Katsu, and Thick cut pork Katsu. All done and cooked masterfully with the right amount of crispiness on the outside and juiciness still retained in the meat. 
The appetizers also very delectable and not too over sized, which I personally like. Need I say more about this place and its food. Moving onto the service, service here is always fast, friendly, they strive to make you feel welcome and its a very laid back and cozy place.

Every time I decided to go to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, it happened to be a Sunday. Haha Just my luck right? Luckily, this time it was a Thursday. 

Parking is never an issue in Las Vegas. This location had their own parking lot. It was not pack at the time I went.

The atmosphere inside the store was very causal. I like that there was a Daruma good luck doll. I saw a bunch of those when I went to Hawaii so I thought they was cool that they had a huge one there. They have a ""bar"" seating area and 6 tables inside the restaurant. Five tables were seated but it didn't feel PACKED. The place is small with can hold a good amount of people without feeling crowded. 

There was only one service and two people in the kitchen. The server was quiet for the most part. He would just take our order and it took him a while to refill our water. When I went to pay my bill, he was very friendly and joked around a little.

The food was the main reason why I rated this place 2 stars. I ordered the Tonkatsu Don. Although the slice of pork was thick, it was very dry. There was nothing special about that dish. We also order the Chicken Karaage which was $6. There was only 6 pieces of meat and they were pretty small. I can't believe I paid $1 per piece of chicken. There was nothing special about the Chicken Karaage either. I felt like I could live without it and regretted my order. We got the Melon Float as well which is a drink I could make on my own. 

If you're looking for a very good Tonkatsu Don, I recommend going to I-Naba. The location of the restaurant is a little weird but I guarantee their food is good and very authentic! :)",5RZ7l8EqNJEssIhiEOtARw,3,2,2,ktwU5gYdeuw0l2FOOXxssw

This is THE tokatsu place to go to. You can taste the oil is changed out frequently which I appreciate.  The apps are just ok.  I'd say just stick with the tonkatsu since it really is the star.  The shredded cabbage with the tangy dressing is a nice compliment to the fried meat and carb-y rice. 

Love that you can make your own dipping sauce.  It's also good entertainment (and may help build your appetite) while waiting for food to come out.  Order the melon float after if you have room to spare.  Kind of reminds me of a Melona bar - not too sweet or heavy. 

The restaurant is always clean and service is always nice.  Sometimes a tad slow but it's ok - it's a small family run place!  Just relax and enjoy.

We decided to go and check this place out during our vacation in Vegas (we're from Honolulu, HI) when I saw all the awesome reviews on Yelp and the pictures of what appeared to be authentic Japanese-style tonkatsu!  What makes it look authentic, you say? Well, they use the little wire strainers on the plate under the katsu to keep the food from soaking in any excess oil that may remain after frying, keeping the katsu crunchy and tasty!  After studying the menu, noticing how reasonable the prices were for authentic katsu and getting a thumbs up from my wife, we went for lunch.  Upon arriving, we figured the place must have opened recently, since it still had a huge ""NOW OPEN!"" banner hanging above the restaurant 's name over the front door.  We entered and saw it was not a very large place--maybe six tables that can seat 4-6 each and a counter that can serve another six customers.  It was, however, very clean and authentic looking with the lacquer dishes, numerous decorations and Japanese kanji characters abound.  A large man behind the counter greeted us with the familiar Japanese welcome phrase, ""Irashaimase!""  After grabbing a few items, he then made his way to our table, served us some ice water and handed us menus. My wife ordered the chicken and shrimp katsu combination dinner, while I chose to have the beef tataki appetizer and hire katsu dinner.  After placing the order with the kitchen, he came back and showed us how to make our own katsu sauce by grinding up the sesame seeds in the special grinding bowl using a wooden stick, which we already knew how to do because we experienced it in Japan two years ago.  After making our katsu sauce, the beef tataki arrived, and man was it delicious!  Well-marbled beef is seared slightly on the outside, thinly sliced then served rare on a bed of finely grated daikon and a shiso leaf, accompanied with ponzu sauce for dipping--I was in beef-lovers heaven!  While enjoying my appetizer, we found out that our server was none other than owner Kiyoshi, who learned the ropes about tonkatsu and Japanese cuisine from his grandmother while he was growing up in Japan as a boy.  He had also gained invaluable experience about Las Vegas and the food scene there through his nine years of experience working at Bellagio, but decided a few years ago he wanted to branch out and own his own place.  After some discussion with his investment partners, they decided to open Tonkatsu Kiyoshi in November, 2013 at its present location, and he said he is pleased with how things are going for the restaurant for the six months since.  A few moments later, our dinners (lunches?) arrived, and they were fantastic!  Each dinner was accompanied with miso soup, savory and full of pieces of tofu and seaweed--warm and delicious!  Also served with our dinner was a hot bowl of white rice, shredded cabbage and rakkyo--little pickled onions that are tart and lip-smacking yummy!  The cabbage was accompanied with an oriental salad dressing, while my wife's shrimp katsu also had a separate sauce.  The tonkatsu I ordered was awesome--the panko crust nicely browned, not at all oily and nicely crisp, and it paired really well with the katsu sauce we concocted earlier.  My wife's shrimp katsu was crunchy, tasty, made with very fresh shrimp and also paired well with the special sauce Kiyoshi brought for it.  Her chicken katsu was tender and moist, not firm like the tonkatsu I was having, but just as delicious.  I am already home in Honolulu now, but drooling just thinking about our wonderful katsu meal at Tonkatsu Kiyoshi and very much looking forward to visiting there again next time I'm in Las Vegas!",xF1F4AhhdzhVVhpRKgXtuw,0,0,5,NHvmnr6J9OQasqOxkwG43w

Great quality appetizers such as chicken karaage, octopus balls, croquets, fried spam musubi's and a standard, yet thirst quenching Asian beer selection.

The staff is extremely friendly with roots in guest service from one of the best properties on the strip (think Ocean's 11 to avoid any trademark issues). The location itself is a bit small however the only time this becomes a problem is the lunch and dinner rush.

There is no way to describe the best breaded Chicken Katsu in town until you've dipped your piece (chicken piece that is) in their sauce and let your taste buds do the talking. 

They're set up for six - 4 tops and  bar seating. They do to-go orders but I highly recommend you take your time with this and done in.

I promise you, you will not find better Katsu in Las Vegas.",PVtVyPPZvNpjw6j3rFOc_g,2,0,5,wCPTvQ2VZ8XlObUXn7T6zA

I've been visiting since before they had their liquor license. It's a bit of a hike for me and every time I'm in this side of town, this is my go to place for lunch or dinner. 

I had the shrimp this time with a side of curry. There curry is amazing for dipping and also with rice! The usual self ground sesame with tonkatsu sauce was skipped since I had a serious curry craving!

For a dollar more I got the shrimp vs the chicken and shrimp combo. Maybe I got bigger shrimp? I don't know but even tho I was satisfied I kinda felt like the 2 shrimp plus chicken for a dollar less was a better deal than my 3 shrimp for a dollar more and no chicken. And my server did recommend the chicken and shrimp combo. Should have listened to her!

Educate yourself and rent these movies - Jiro Dreams of Sushi, The Ramen Girl, and Tampopo) pork tenderloin with a delicious curry sauce with chunks of potato and carrot over white rice. You also get a bowl of miso soup. It's the perfect hearty meal that will warm you up and leave your tummy so satisfied. If my tummy could talk it would tell me how happy it is. Having traveled to Japan twice and eating my way through the country, I'll vouch that the Katsu Curry is just like in Japan. It's one of those menu items that is so good that you order it every time. One of these days I'll have to force myself to try something else on the menu to mix it up. The service is very nice and the restaurant is very clean and neat. The times we've been there, we noticed Japanese patrons - always a good sign at a Japanese restaurant! They have highchairs for the kiddies. They have Calpico on their beverage menu which is fun. It's a popular Japanese soft drink. Want to finish off your meal with something sweet? Get a scoop of red bean or green tea ice cream for dessert.

This place is amazingly skilled at frying food. As far as the tonkatsu, I've only had the hire tonkatsu (pork loin). I don't know how they tenderize the cutlet (or even if they do), but it's incredibly tender without sacrificing texture like marinating can do. 

Their ebi katsu are very large black tiger shrimp - we joke they are size U1. The shrimp is also fried to perfection.

Today, a creamy crab croquette was a special. It was full of crab and very creamy, but I don't know how they fried it so perfectly that the insides weren't spilling out everywhere. Like I said, they are fry masters.

But what totally takes it over the top is the self-service katsu sauce. I like tons of sesame seeds ground to a rough paste before dumping their version of Bulldog sauce. The sesame seeds adds an incredibly nutty flavor and texture. 

I believe most of the meals come with rice, miso soup, and a gargantuan mound of finely shredded cabbage to make it seem like you're not eating everything to raise your cholesterol and clog arteries. Their rakkyo (pickled scallions) is good as well.

We ended up ordering 2 Katsu Curries, Salmon Katsu, and I had the Rosu Katsu.  Also had to get some Shishito Peppers on the side.  All dishes were delicious!  Super light and crispy katsu crusts on every dish, and not at all oily or soggy!  The generous portions and fresh side of cabbage salad was a perfect compliment.  Nice miso soup with the meal.

The lunch crowd was not super busy, and our servers were extremely friendly and helpful.  I love it when they offer up some unsolicited guidance on mixing the ingredients to compliment your dish.  Even if you think you know what you're doing, it's a nice extra step to get the recommendations from the experts.

The restaurant was super clean and nicely adorned with just a few touches that made it feel very comfortable and welcoming.

Obviously compared to authentic tonkatsu found in Japan it's not going to be quite to standard.  The cuts of the pork were too lean.   Would have been nice if the portions of the cutlets were a bit larger. The rice was not Japanese rice (authentic Japanese rice with tonkatsu is key in my opinion), and the potato salad was what you could find at a supermarket.  The miso was so-so.  They charge for hot tea which was very surprising since it was lukewarm and not particularly of high quality.  Typically a tonkatsu place would not charge for basic hot tea.  All in all, it's fine, a bit pricier than I expected.

Service was friendly but the place was understaffed.  It may be one of the better katsu places in Vegas but Vegas is not really a hotbed for Japanese cuisine so it's all relative. I find the katsu here about the same as served at Yu-Yu.",5xkAl6XSLqLRjxwElz7hlQ,0,0,3,BSZWKiGjW23ShXtrszt70g

Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is oddly surrounded by houses, located on a secluded corner on Jones & Robindale. It's a small place with only 6 or so tables of 4. I love the simplicity of the decorations & lighting. Also, thanks for playing good ass music!

Anyway, onto the food. It's customary to grind your sesame seeds and put a dollop of katsu sauce. Really good paired with their delicious katsu. Check in on Yelp for your free potato salad btw, one per table. It was pretty good. 

Appetizer: Takoyaki- Crispy skin and creamy batter inside with yummy tako, each one swirled with the sauces and topped with yummy bonito flakes. Perfect meal starter!

Entrees: Hire Katsu Curry & Chicken Katsu Curry- Holy ish, they're not a curry house but their curry paired with their crispy, tender katsu is AMAZING. It really is the ultimate comfort food. The curry was the right amount of mild spice & if you prefer spicy, they'll suggest to bring cayenne pepper to spice it up. Honestly though, it's already good without it. The curry had a few pieces of carrots & potatoes too. 

Hire, apparently, is a thinner, more tender cut of pork. It was so good, not salty & super crispy. The chicken was cooked very well too! Entrees come with hot miso soup & salad (dressing wasn't really my favorite but who cares at this point). 

Basically, we found a new go-to spot! The customer service is excellent cause they're really the sweetest & the prices are worth the amount & quality of food you get. Can't wait to come back!",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,1,1,5,tmcsSsrmtEAvKZszjcjkfw

He explained it as a Japanese / Hawaiian spot, so I was immediately interested!  Wasn't quite sure when they were opening as I was just eavesdropping on a conversation, but as soon as it popped up on my yelp ""nearby,"" I had to go and check it out!  My daughter and I went this past Sunday night. 

The decor is awesome with Japanese accents.  I really thought he did a great job. The owner explained that his mom helped with some of the cranes and such. It's clear they put a lot of thought into the decor. I love it!  

We ordered the Katsu curry and asked for chicken instead of pork, as I grew up on chicken Katsu!  My daughter also wanted the edamame and I ordered shishito peppers to start. The peppers were a little crispier than I am used to, but they were delicious.  I would just like to see them cooked down just a little more next time. Delicious, none the less.  My daughter said the edamame was great. 

As we waited for the entree he taught us how to make our own Katsu dipping sauce with sesame seeds. How cool! 

The Katsu arrived quickly after we finished making our sauce. The curry was perfect, exactly what we would expect at any Japanese / Hawaiian restaurant. The crispy Katsu breading was great! Crispy and tasty. The chicken was juicy and not over cooked.  We really loved it! 

The dipping sauce is the best Katsu sauce I've ever had, which is crazy because I have been eating chicken Katsu all of my life!!! 

We left full and very happy. We almost went there for dinner on Monday night (the very next evening) but my daughter decided to go tonight instead (Tuesday) with her friend.

Scoring it a perfect five because aside from the great food and the attentive lady owner, this place is a working man's diner. Yes, after a hard day at work, you can come to this place and just eat and go. 

This is probably the only specialty tonkatsu place in Vegas. Yes, it is the best tonkatsu in town.

The tonkatsu is crispy on the first bite but juicy and soft on the second. It is well seasoned and I noticed there is a thin layer of fat in it. I've said it before, fat adds flavor. Love it.

I always order the Katsu Donburi (Katsudon). If you like rice, egg, and pork, then you would do well to order the Donburi.

For appetizers, I circulate between the Karaage, Takoyaki, and Arabiki sausage. All equally good. It's a mood thing that decides which one I order that day.

We have  only tried Hawaiian style tonkatsu but this place has a different take on their tonkatsu, they serve it with grounded sesame seed with tonkatsu sauce, the cabbage that comes along with tongkatsu is splendid, its a nice pairing of deep fried meats and salad with ginger miso dressing.

 The food is not oily and greasy, the Hire katsu is perfect and comes with rice, miso soup and shredded cabbage with a dressing on the side. The miso soup is the best tasting that I have ever had! I have been to a lot of Japanese restaurants, fancy ones and simple ayce types!!! None of them compare to this place... As far as the miso soup goes. If you are into Japanese food and love miso soup must try..


Let's move on to the Hire katsu.... Perfect portions and juicy! The breading is perfect and so good. This place has it down to a science. The sesame seed katsu sauce is perfect to compliment.. Don't forget to grind the sesame seeds!


Now let's move on to service... The girl that was servicing us never came back to check on us? Not once, just dropped off the food and left..... Hmmmm strange considering that the only other table in there was sitting at the bar.... The other couple on the side table was just talking and drinking water, they were done eating ages ago!!!!!

We had two appetizers. The karaage and the gyoza. The karaage was okay. I've had better but the chicken was still quite juicy. I really like the gyoza though. Might be because of the sauce. The soy sauce had some yuzu flavor to it which really brought out the gyoza. Not to mention that the gyoza had a light skin and a good stuffing. 

I had the tonkatsu pork and shrimp. You are given all the sauce ingredients like the sesame and the grinder on the table. Personally, part of the fun is to be able to grind the sesame itself and I always feel like it makes it legit when you have the sesame seeds to grind for Tonkatsu places. With that said, it was a big portion for a good pricing. You are given two pork(that are already cut for you) and 2 big shrimps. I personally thought the shrimp was really good, might be even better than the pork in fact. They fried it to perfection with the panko and it was the perfect proportion of the skin and the big fat shrimp. 

Service was pretty good. The server actually had a mishap with our order and she gave us the appetizer as an apology.",SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog,1,1,4,pe0AeOGBrprPiDbs7nUD_Q

During my visit, we ordered Hire (pork tenderloin) katsu & Ebi fry ($16), Tori (chicken) katsu & Ebi fry ($14), Rosu (thick cut pork loin) katsu ($12), Takoyaki ($5), Deep fried spam musubi ($3.50), and Kaki (oyster) fry ($5). With your yelp check-in, you can either choose between an order of potato salad or seaweed salad for free! We chose to try the potato salad.

All of the katsu dishes were fried to perfection and did not have an overly thick crust. The chicken and pork cutlets were tender and juicy. They have the best katsu I've had in Vegas so far! Other places I've tried tend to overcook their katsu resulting in a dry cutlet. Another nice touch is that you can grind up sesame seed to your liking and mix it with the katsu sauce! The ebi fry tasted great! Large prawns are fried in a light crispy batter resulting in a nice crunch. Two came with the combo plate and was more than enough!

The takoyaki was pretty straight forward. Nothing to rave about, but was good nonetheless. 

Four words...DEEP FRIED SPAM MUSUBI. The proportion of spam to rice was well balanced and was great with the crunch from the panko batter.  Everyone at the table loved this appetizer and will be a staple to order on our next visit!   

The kaki fry came with three to an order and was nice and juicy.

I usually order one out of the three: tori katsu, chicken katsu curry, or chicken katsu donburi. Everything is so good here and it's all because of their breeding of the katsu! Has the perfect texture and crisp. I love that you can adjust your katsu sauce to your liking by crushing your own sesame! I may or may not be the only one but I also really love their cabbage salad that comes with the tori katsu set!

1. Irregular hours (only open for dinner, I want to be able to eat your food at least for lunch or dinner, but that's beyond my control)

I never get their curry since they're not really known for it (and there are better curry spots in town imo). This place is an absolute must though if you enjoy eating pork or chicken cutlets. Their breading is perfectly crunchy and the meat is very tender and juicy. I like that the food is not oily either. Plus the katsu comes served on top of a rack so it's not soggy. I also like how you can make your own sauce by grinding their sesame seeds & mixing it with their katsu sauce. They offer free refills on the rice , miso soup and shredded cabbage.

Very friendly Japanese customer service too. It would be awesome if they offered brown rice & was a bit cheaper.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,6,6,4,nW605jEWEvncvt-6-7IVZg
1781984,2014-04-23,1,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"Honestly, I didn't even realize how hidden this place is for a restaurant with such a reputation. I pass by this intersection every day and didn't think twice about going by here until by recommendation from some classmates.

So I head down the street, park up front, and enter to find this seemingly simple designed eatery. Nothing grand. A simple bar. Maybe enough seats for 30? It's small. The menu itself is simple too! It's a front and back menu which focuses on mainly katsu. I was really curious at this point.

I order a chicken katsu at around $9 and my boyfriend the salmon/chicken katsu close to $14. It's a really good portion of food. You get a salad with dressing. Katsu fried in flakey japanese style breading that has a satisfying crisp. I think some Japanese pickles (which I didn't try) and a miso soup. The miso soup was a thoughtful touch. I could never finish a whole order by myself and I went here twice!

Overall, I ended up having a pocket in my heart for this place. The restaurant is simple, not because it doesn't put effort, but because their showcase is really their food. It has personality to it that is unique to Tonkatsu. Service has always been friendly there too like we're all just neighbors.

Note: I'm often a budget eater so $9 for chicken katsu was like, ""Eh.."" but after trying it, I say it's a reasonable price especially if comparing it to a $6.50 hawaiian bbq regular plate because you can account for the salad and miso soup...plus the breading of the chicken was delicious at this place. It definitely converted what I thought katsu should taste like.",fGRzUxh3oDdLbhkr1Lr8Cw,2,1,4,BdfH3NZB96Zt17ELTkVZvQ

CHICKEN KARAGE: Japanese fried chicken, decent portion for the price ($5) but a little on the dry side. I've had some amazing karage in Vegas and this one fell short of my expectations. I preferred the side salad this is plated with to the actual dish.
TAKO SUNOMONO: Octopus and cucumber salad. This was perfect for the hot Vegas day, light and refreshing with a light dressing.
BEEF TATAKI: $7 for 9 tiny strips, served on a bed of radish with ponzu sauce. Pretty good flavor, liked the dipping sauce with daikon. Small portion is shareable but barely so.
CHICKEN KATSU SLIDERS: Ordered this because I saw another diner eating the across the room and it ended up being my favorite dish. Two fresh Hawaiian rolls with a halved chicken katsu cutlet and a tasty wasabi-infused sauce.  

Service was basic. I like that they have iced green tea available as a beverage.

I asked for an extra side order. The server then tells me that they are running low on rice..im like WTF??? All along while waiting for my son's food to come out. We ended up giving him portions of our chicken so he could eat in the meanwhile. Then a few mins later the server now tells us that their rice cooker is not working...well great fucking timing!! Our whole lunch mood got thrown off. The server offers other options but we just wanted to get the fuck out of there. We paid and got out of there and ended up at zen curry for my son's lunch.

1. I've been once before, and then this makes the second time because it is delicious and indulgent.  
2. This is a specialty ""tonkatsu"" restaurant.  What makes it special is the fluffy/marshmallow like tenderness of the meats: chicken and pork mainly.  Biting into it is the tenderest pork and chicken I have ever had.
3. Also, you are given sesame seeds to grind and tonkatsu sauce.  Combination of the two come together like foodie ""heaven"" - as in so addictive 
4. Served with rice, miso soup/tofu, shredded cabbage and unique dressings like ume and yuzu lemon.  
5. They have a number of other offerings like gyoza and chicken karaage but the tonkatsu is the real showstopper.  Usually also get 'ebi fry' fried shrimp to make it an extra special occasion.  

Service:
1. I met Meredith for the first time, she is a familiar face here.  One of the friendliest and funniest business owner/restauranteur I have met here in Vegas. She has monopolized this unique style dining I have only had in Asia known as ""Saboten"".  
2.  I wanna go back soon!

3. Quaint, small and cannot seat many.  Makes the restaurant feel like there are never enough tables and is constantly busy from what I have seen.  Sometimes wait time can get lengthy, but I do believe it is worth it.

The employees right off the bat were welcoming, friendly, full of smiles and so courteous. Kinda felt home like, we were seated right away and greeted soon after. We went during lunch so there were a good amount of customers. 

We enjoyed quite a few dishes. Excuse me for I am not sure of the names they are called on the menu but I'll do my best. We shared a chicken katau meal, which is quite a large portion. We enjoyed the soft shell crab with tgis amazing ponzu sauce, octupus & cucumber salad, fried squid legs and these octopus cream type balls (no clue what it's called). Everything was so good and quite filling. They were all served fresh and hot and quickly too. 

Cutest thing is you get to make your own katau sauce. You grind the seseame yourself and then add the sauce. Different right? I like different.

2261978,2014-05-04,2,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"It's been a busy month, with two Japanese restaurants in the area that I haven't tried yet, I am thrilled and filled at the same time....

I can always have Tonkatsu for any meal; it's comfort food for me and if you go to Japan, they make it so light and crunchy, you almost can't believe that its fried.  Almost...

But alas, we're not in Japan, and for the most part, Tonkatsu here is a heavier, oilier version of the original, and if you're lucky, the Pork doesn't taste like your belt.. or is as thin...

And then Tonkatsu Kiyoshi come into town, and all is good.  Located in an area that no matter where you live, takes a butt long time to get to, since it's in a residential-ish area with rudimentary access (Vegas, could you hurry up and upgrade the road conditions already)?  I was a little trepidatious at first, I really didn't want to go if it was just another L&L BBQ or Ross J's... (no offense)...

The venue is not big, under 40 seats total with a great counter for single dining; the interior is pretty bare bones, but understandable considering its location and casual service.  

Its always a good sign to see Sesame and Tonkatsu sauce on the table with your own mini mortar and pestle.  You grind the Sesame seeds and then pour the tart sauce over to create a goopy concoction to dip your flaky fried Tonkatsu, I prefer to add a little hot mustard to give it a kick!

As mini starters, we ordered the Crab and Cucumber Salad and the House made Potato Salad.  I loved how the dishes came in ceramics authentic to a Japanese Tonkatsu House, and looked forward how the dishes would taste.

The House Potato Salad had Cucumber, Apple and Japanese Mayonnaise (Kewpie).  Although it was good, It was a little watered down and not as creamy as I was expecting.  But then again, with all the fried food that was about to be consumed, maybe creamy was overkill...

So the next dish we ordered was the Crab Cucumber Salad.... which to my disappointment, was not with real Crab but with Crab Sticks or 'Kamaboko' - basically imitation crab made from white fish meat.  But, for $3.50, I should have realized that the fact that this wan't going to be a real Crab dish.

Oddly enough, there was a disproportionate amount of Crabstick in comparison to Cucumber.  It was an odd dish for sure.

As for the Tonkatsu, I got the combination set with  two pieces of
Tenderloin (Hire) and two Fried Shrimp.  You have two types of cuts to choose from: Hire and Rosu (Thick cut Pork Loin).  Usually I get the Hire; it's a softer cut that comes installer, thinner pieces.  If I'm really hungry, I'll get the Rosu which is thicker and bigger but a little tougher to chew.

I was thoroughly amazed at how soft the Tonkutsu was, it was fried perfectly too, not greasy in the least, it was very light and easy to eat.  It was a authentic as I could ever have imagined, like being back in Japan.  The Miso Soup was the real thing as well, and the Rice was spot on (yes, you can fuck up Rice...)

The Fried Shimp was ok, again fried to perfection but I wasn't sure about the freshness of the Shrimp.  I would get it again.

But all in all, its definitely worth going back to for the Hire Katsu.  And with a couple of combinations you can get as well as Katsu Curry, It's a place I can back again and again!

2303955,2013-09-28,0,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"Another local style restaurant near my house! I am loving the ninth island. Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is strictly all about the self described Tonkatsu. One of the many local kine food grew up on. Besides the fact always been fan of any kind of breading that uses panko. It done right nothing better then light crispy golden brown crust on the outside and juicy hot meat on the inside. At Tonkatsu Kiyoshi they do fabulous job comes too the Tonkatsu.

 It was my first time so on this visit only got too try the pork katsu although they have other proteins from shrimp, beef, and chicken. Most of the entree comes with rice, couple pieces of garlic (makes no sense, I never asked so sure has its compliment), and miso soup. The house miso soup was good. I liked the fact that it was on the hearty side with decent amount of diced tofu and seaweed. I heard about the Curry sauce from friend recommendation. So I got the Katsu Curry try the best of both worlds. Japanese Curry reminded me of the curry houses back home in Hawaii. Especially the fact that in curry comes with big diced cuts of potatoes and carrots. Think traditional Japanese style just the curry then you add extra items or other curry places around town that just the norm. I have no problem with just pointing out difference. The curry sauce base its solid. Other places around town the base curry is better but here curry sauce does have its flavor all its own. Its more darker in depth not more on the yellow/orange color use too. The tonkatsu was ON point crispy golden brown and hot moist on the inside. Portion size is LOCAL style. Very reasonable price too. One plate between half filled with rice, nice size portion of katsu, and my case curry sauce. Miso soup that full full lunch. 

It small restaurant easily hold under hundred peeps. I like the bar action up front holds around ten seats. They have tables on both sides up front. The decor is simple couple of japanese art work on the walls. It just open so for sure has that brand new restaurant smell too it. Couple other business around it that not quite open yet so don't let the lack of action around mislead you. It tucked in the back of mini shopping mall so easy pass it.

Ate here not long ago for the very first time when the daughter mention this place.  Simple menu (all tonkatsu), side dishes were very selective and good, appetizers were good, as well as the deserts.  Only grip I have is there is to much shredded cabbage on the plate that takes the place of the rice (very small serving of rice bowl). Swap out the rice and cabbage portions and it would the number one place to eat.  To much cabbage will give you gas.  Donburi was a little dry but still very good.  This is the second place that I know of that offers Katsu-don here in the valley.  I've been trying to find a really good Katsu-don place since I first ate this dish way back in the Vietnam war (best one I've had ever) in 1968.  The only place better than this place is my sisters house in Tampa, Florida, but its so far away so I gotta go here to get my dish.  Another gripe is the tonkatsu portions are very small compared to other Hawaiian/Japanese restaurants in the valley plus the price is a bit on the high side.  Single slab of meat versus two slabs for the same price.  Increasing the portions size will surely help enlarge the customer base.  Curry katsu is very ono so you gotta try this one.",fYBwTpuyK5ujW2vZs9OWlQ,0,0,5,buHTrVi-O7UXIQ8mFsIApA

So, I went without her, with my friends and family.  The ratings looked so good!  But I was disappointed, yet glad I didn't come with my friend.

I checked in on Yelp, and scored a free potato salad.  It was the first thing I did when I saw the server, and she congratulated me on it.

We then ordered the tonkatsu, tonkatsu with curry, edamame, takoyaki, shishito peppers, and fried spam musubi.

The shishito peppers weren't special.  They were lightly coated with salt.  There was no other taste.  Everywhere I go, if I see it on the menu, I'll order this dish, so I'm not new to shishito peppers, but this was the most boring.  But I forced myself to eat them all.

The musubi was small.  I didn't try it, but I didn't hear anything about it from those who ate it.

The takoyaki was just ok.  There weren't many pieces of tako in it, and even though I like it that way, the flavor even with the sauces wasn't there.

The food comes out at different times.  Halfway through the service, we decide to ask about the potato salad and the edamame, which somehow must have been stuck in traffic....The server acknowledged the missing items without an apology, and at some point later the potato salad arrives.  It was blah.  It wasn't special.  We all tasted it-but none of us were impressed.

But where did the edamame go???  We waited and waited.  At some point my sister saw it hanging out on the counter, just waiting for someone to bring it over since it didn't have legs.  We waited and waited, and I could feel the tension at the table-someone was going to burst, it was just a matter of who and when!  You know the feeling....

But alas, we took some deep breaths and out came the edamame.  It was a small serving, but what was worse, was it was cold, and dry!  I mean, the outside was moist, but the beans inside were dry and hard.  We supposed and gathered they must have been precooked and frozen then thawed or reheated.  Regardless, we only ate three pods before we just gave up.

The tonkatsu wasn't bad.  If it was all I ordered and experienced, I'd probably rate it 3 stars.

The 1st thing I noticed was the small menu, and there wasn't really much choice besides various katsus...hence their name. We ordered chicken katsu and a pork katsu curry. Both katsu entrees were very crispy the breading was a perfect golden brown. I liked the chicken a little more since it was lighter and juicer than the pork. Definitely some of the better katsu entrees I've ever had, but I thought the pricing was a little steep for some fried meat, rice and miso soup.  

I was a little confused on how to make the katsu sauce and I found myself mashing up a concoction of sesame seeds and sauce together which apparently isn't the way it's supposed to be done? I also thought you were supposed to mash up the little shalots/onions they give you...Eventually I gave up and just ate everything plain...I still have no idea how to properly prepare the sauces, shalots, etc.

Dining experience here is ok...while the service was great, it was super hot in the dining area which made it uncomfortable since I felt hot and sweaty the whole meal. Is there not a/c that can be turned on during business hours? I felt like I drank 4-5 glasses of water because it was so hot and then I pretty much lost my appetite from filling up on water instead of food.

I would come back again but it wouldn't be my 1st choice. Their food was good, but maybe next time I'll grab it to go instead of suffering through a 80-90 degree dining room.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,1,3,q_bGMKuJ-EjdjNRqusYaXg

The pork, chicken, and shrimp are perfectly cooked. The breading is perfectly fried and crispy, not greasy at all.  Every table has a condiment tray with two mini mortars and pestles in which you grind white sesame seeds and add tonkatsu sauce.  What a perfect touch!  They even give you rakkyo (pickled scallions) with your dish.  Very authentic.  The miso soup was delicious, too.  The finely shaved mountain of cabbage with a light and delicate yuzu (Japanese citrus) dressing is a perfect accompaniment to the meat.

If you have room, try one of the homemade desserts, beautifully prepared by Kiyoshi's wife.  Today, I had the raspberry yuzu panecotta, and it was the bomb!

In addition to delicious food, the restaurant is decorated with homey Japanese touches that make it a very comfortable place to enjoy one of the tastiest comfort foods of Japan--warm woods, good luck cats, and homey framed artwork.

I ordered the pork katsu for him and chicken katsu for myself. The pork and chicken cutlets were perfectly cooked. Just the right amount of crispiness with moist and tender meat. It was a generous portion of meat with rice, salad, and miso soup. 

My second time, we decided to dine in with our friends. It was neat to ""make"" your tonkatsu sauce. I'm not sure if I did it right as I never grinded sesame seeds to make tonkatsu sauce before. It turned out good so that's all that mattered to me at that point.

My husband ordered the same dish and I opted for the katsu donburi this time. We ordered the chicken karaage and the panko crusted soft shell crab for appetizers and sampled my friend's beef tataki. Small, tasty portions but sufficient to whet our appetite for our main meal. 

I was pretty much satisfied with my donburi. One minor complaint. I noticed I got half the amount of meat as the pork katsu dinner which was the same price. So I thought it was a bit overpriced. It was still good though. I will have to try the curry katsu next time.

The service was just OK both times. Another minor complaint that I like to mention-Our friends had ordered chicken karaage too. I'm not sure why mine came out first when they should come out at the same time. I don't like eating by myself and having hungry people staring at my app where I feel obligated to share.

There are only a couple of options in Vegas for quality katsu...Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is one of them. I love the pride they take in their product here. I once asked if they were able to make the curry in the katsu dinner spicy, that was when I was told, ""We're a Katsu House, not a Curry House."" At first you might be taken back from that comment, but as you spend any time here it is readily evident that they are highly passionate about their katsu...and that comes through in the quality of their food.

They will recommend the Hire (Pork Tenderloin) Katsu if you ask. I shared this the first time I came here, and, while good, I haven't ordered it again. Instead I usually get the Tori (Chicken) Katsu Dinner...I like the flavor of the chicken more, but I eat a lot more chicken than pork, so I may be biased and you may need to try them both and decide. The last time I was here was my favorite visit and opened me up to even more possibilities. I came in with my love and her daughter and we shared Tori Katsu, Ebi (Shrimp) Fry, and Salmon (Salmon) Fry. The salmon was the hit of the table, but everything was absolutely enjoyed...so we may need to come again with 3 or 4 of us to continue to be able to share a few items.

We also enjoyed the opportunity to make our sauce by grinding the sesame seeds with the pestle and mortar. I brought my sister here previously and the simple act of grinding the seeds was memorable part of that experience as well.

There are curry options in the specials section of their menu...they are solid options...definitely not to be avoided...but again, they're a katsu house, not a curry house, and there are slightly better curry options in town IMHO.

Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is certainly worth trying out if you like pork or chicken cutlets...and an absolute must if you like katsu as it's one of the best in town!",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,16,12,4,6KIN9v7TJjjSwTGcPo2KCw

Today I stopped by a special of some fried spam musubi 5/5 and an order of chicken karage with their signature hand ground sesame seeds and barbecue sauce 5/5. I also enjoyed a bottle of the Mio sparkling sake with my meal, very crisp and refreshing and served in an iced carafe to keep it chilled. They still have the Yelp check in offer for a free Japanese potato salad.

So we decided to check this place out, I was so happy we did. Upon arriving I thought we were lost, but this is somewhat hidden in a complex of little shops. 

The first moment I walked in, I was very pleased. It smelled so good, it wasn't just the aroma of the food, but there was a slight sweet smell. Almost like flowers. Hah, that's kind of weird, but trust me, when you walk in, it brings you right in! The people there are super friendly! At first we sat down at a table, but we decided we wanted to sit at the bar. There is a place you can hang your purse from, that was a nice touch. The menu's were simple and to the point. Sometimes looking at too many items can be overwhelming. We ordered the chicken katsu and the pork tonkatsu. It came with all the trimmings!

The katsu was amazing. The right amount of crunch, everything that was on the plate complimented each other so well. I wish I could eat here all the time. Hehe.

It seems they do take reservations. 
Not sure why people are saying this is the best tonkatsu in town. 
The serving sizes were LARGE with dishes around 12-17$ depending on you meat choice. 
Pork Tonkasu was dry and not seasoned at all. The meat had no seasoning and it def needed salt. 
My favorite part is the smashing and grinding the sesame seeds and adding the sauce!!! So much fun, idk why! Guess even as adults we like to play with our food
My other concern with the place was the curry consistency. It was kinda watery and not thick and if you look at the photos, the curry has about 2 pieces about potato and 2 pieces of carrots. 
Other than that the service was ok, very friendly especially the manager.

Not only are the cuts of meat made up of actual meat (as opposed to the other places that over-bread), but it's cooked to a masterful crispy-brown perfection each and every time.

I also enjoyed having the ability of creating my own sauce, which to my surprise, wasn't such a hard thing to ""get right"". 

The miso soup was a warm and very welcome addition to the meal, and the cabbage salad was cool and refreshing with every mouthful of food I inhaled.

2688262,2014-05-27,0,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"I forgot to ask who Kiyoshi was!  All I know is that it is a common Japanese boy's name.  Tonkatsu on the other hand (which I often confuse with Tonkotsu) is deep fried panko-breaded pork cutlet.  Just like breaded pork chop, Japanese style. When you enter the place, it looks very Japanese with the set-up and décor, but there was summer-y Hawaiian music playing in the background.  The place is tiny and I'm glad we went at an odd hour.

If we came more hungry, I would've wanted to try their beef tataki and daily special off menu agedashi tofu.  But today, we went straight to the entrees.  We had... 

1. The miso soup which came with both our orders.  This was awesome, definitely a notch above your standard bowls in Jap restaurants.  

2. The Katsu Curry which has 2 pork cutlets, lots of rice, lots of curry with chunks of potato and carrot.  Their katsu preparation is good - thick cuts that maintain their juiciness with breading that is light and not greasy.  Their curry sauce has much stronger flavors than your typical Japanese curry, in fact, it really reminded me of the Indian version.  Hubby enjoyed it.

3. The Katsudon (Katsu donburi) has katsu over rice topped with egg and katsudon sauce (which is a savory-sweet sauce).  There were a couple of grilled shishito peppers on the side as well.  The katsu itself is not salty and is meant to be dipped in curry or tonkatsu sauce so I wish this thin type sauce was tastier.  It was, however, still very good. 

4. Chicken Karaage for the lil man.  This was a very different preparation from the karaages in ramen joints.  The batter is not as light and the piece of chicken is denser.  Although good, I prefer the ramen joint version a lot better. 

5. Japanese potato salad.  This is a sweeter version of a classic with eggs and cucumbers.  A refreshing side to cut the fried goodness.

6. Melon soda.  It comes in a bottle and I didn't care for this too much because it has a Yakult after taste.  But hubby loved it so much he asked for one to go.  Try it if you haven't had any melon soda yet.

7. Their tonkatsu dipping sauce.  I love places that serve condiments.  I really do.  Each table comes with sauce and roasted sesame seeds which you grind yourself with a wooden pestle.  The tonkatsu sauce tastes like the Bulldog bottles you buy in Jap grocery stores.  If you haven't had this condiment, you might really love it or find it weird because it is slightly sour.  Kinda like catsup meets soy sauce meets sugar meets Worcestershire sauce.  I like it though.  And normally, I don't care much for sesame seeds but man!  The roasted sesame flakes on this tonkatsu sauce really elevates it to another level.  Real good stuff.

We enjoyed our meal a lot, and service rocked.  However, for the 2 entrees, 2 sides and 4 drinks, our bill was already over $50 with tip.  It's not cheap, and I wish it was so I can keep coming back.  But if you are a fan of fried Japanese goodness, then you might end up being a Kiyoshi groupie.",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,1,2,4,pYqhXzeAWy9_ZA9MWiPpag

But I must say this tonkastu is one of the best I've had in a long time! The Hire Katsu (thinner cut of pork) and Rosu Kastu (thicker cut of pork) are both prepared perfectly with just the right amount of panko breading and very tender.

If it's your first time visiting this place, I would recommend the Hire over the Rosu Katsu as most of you will probably enjoy a thinner pork cut. The shrimp Kastu is a must! I wouldn't be suprised if these were more tiger prawns than typical jumbo shrimp as they are huge! Good thing they have a Hire & Shrimp Katsu combo ($15.00).  

As far as the Chicken Katsu goes, I'd give it a 3.5/5 so I wouldn't recommend trying this on your first trip.

We've had their beef tataki multiple times and just tried their chicken karaage, both of them are excellent.",snlqKmmGviVUdK9sCY-2eg,0,0,5,mTURrpmLVhUD4S3wAn_XPg

While their Japanese curry isn't my favorite in town, everything else intertwines perfectly...you know, the way grounded Sesame seeds and Katsu sauce go together...oh, and by the way YOU grind your sesame seeds here the way you like, as fine as powder or as corse as sand...then you put the Katsu sauce, mix it together, and just wait until the very professional and warm server brings you your tray full of fresh and crispy Katsu. 

Every table is already set to make your Katsu sauce...Sesame seeds and Katsu sauce. A server will bring you a bowls and wands to grind the sesame seeds according to the number of people in your party.   

You can have traditional Tonkatsu (pork loin), Tori Katsu (chicken), Ebi Katsu (shrimp) or Sake Katsu (salmon). 
The set menus all come with a bowl of white steamed rice, miso soup, and Japanese pickles. We also had Tori Katsu Curry...comes with a miso soup and salad. 

You can cool down with Ashahi beer, other varieties of alcoholic beverages or just water.  Four of us came this time and shared all different kinds of Katsu except for pork loin...but I am sure it is as great as the other Kastu, after all, their name Tonkatsu Kiyoshi represents the pork.

People say when in doubt, you fry it or put bacon on it...Tonkatsu Kiyoshi does work magic with frying and pork...so when you are in mood for something you can count on, come on in. A well deserving thanks to the servers who accommodated our seating needs during our dinner, as well as the gentleman who gave us his seat...",doGsaahbqD7ePHP19UsDsg,16,11,4,UfODEUeGL2TzNg7qIahqIA

The location is pretty weird, I drove passed it once, so if you're coming from the 215 it'll be on your left kind of behind a gas station.

It was pretty empty when we came, no problem. It was cool that you could make your own sauce by grinding sesame seeds but I wish the lady who was acting as our server told us approximately how much to grind. She asked if it was our first time and when we said ya, she just pointed to the containers on the table and was like here, you can make your own sauce! & walked away lol thankfully we had yelp to guide us.

My brother and I both went with the pork tenderloin & shrimp katsu combination. Sooo good omg. Definitely the best katsu I've had in a long time. I loved that they also served the katsu on top of a little wire rack so it didn't get soggy on the bottom and it's also been a while since I was served cabbage so thinly sliced with an amazing citrusy vinagrette. The shrimp we received were enormous. Thank you! It was also served with miso soup and pickled onions. Some might say that $16 is a little much for this combo, which I kind of agree but it was definitely worth it. When I'm in the area, I'll definitely come back to try their salmon katsu!",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,3,2,4,rsiSA9ylNIozqeytNGtw8Q

3015053,2013-10-25,1,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"Krazy for Katsu
There are some days where comfort food makes everything better.  I was not in the mood for meatloaf or some heavy fried chicken, even though I was dying for fried food.  On the way home, we stumbled on a small eatery called Tonkatsu Kiyoshi on Jones and Robindale.  Tonkatsu sounded wonderful for dinner.  Crispy, marinated, fried pork was just the thing to make my frown turn upside-down.

Upon entering the small eatery, there are about 3 tables that seat up to six people, and a nice, large counter seating 5.  We sat at the counter and was greeted by a very nice gentleman who explained the menu layout.  The menu is very simple--it's katsu, either chicken, salmon, thick cut pork, or pork tenderloin, ebi furai, curry combos, and apps.  The appetizers are the typical karaage, cucumber and krab meat salad, seared beef with onions and ponzu, and edamame.  We ordered karaage, krab meat salad, and seared beef.

Before the food arrived, the server explained their sauce tray seated in front of us.  There is a container of sesame seeds, one of katsu sauce, hot pepper, salt, pepper, and soy sauce.


We were told to put sesame in the grinding bowl that doubles as our dipping sauce bowl, and to grind the sesame seeds to a powder.

It was quite fun grinding up the sesame seeds and taking in the scent of the nutty oils releasing in the bowl.  We mixed in the katsu sauce and some hot pepper with our chopsticks, then awaited the main course.

The apps came out quickly.  First up was the cucumber salad with krab meat.  It's sweet and tangy from the vinegar, balancing the sweetness of the shredded krab stick.  The cucumber was a nice, crunchy, and fresh element to the app.  It also acts as a great palate cleanser.

For $5 you get a ton of salad.  I almost ate the whole bowl without sharing with my husband.

The next app that arrived was the seared beef with onions and ponzu.  We were told that some people like to roll the onions into the meat then dip, which I tried.

I added in the radish (on the right) and some chives into the sauce, rolled the raw white onions in the meat, then dipped.  It was delicious and very cold, which was refreshing.  The meat was good quality and seared beautifully.

If there is anything in the world I love, it is fried chicken or karaage, and this eatery makes the lightest, crispiest, and most flavorful karaage I have tried in Vegas.  They marinate the meat in mirin, soy, and other ingredients for a day or two, then they lightly batter it with seasoned rice flour and serve with a vinaigrette salad and lemon.  I squeezed lemon over the chicken, gently dropped soy on each piece, and took a bite.  The crispy, light exterior was just heaven.  The salad on the side balanced the hot fried chicken pieces, providing tasty, cool relief from the hot and crispy chicken.  


With a burst of cherry tomato in my mouth mixed in with the salad, this could be a great lunch dish on its own.  Just lovely.

After all those appetizers came the combination plate that I ordered -- fried shrimp with tenderloin katsu.  It's served with Rokkyo (Japanese pickled onions), miso soup, hot rice, and ponzu for the cabbage.

The katsu is served on this awesome metal rack to keep all sides crispy.

The katsu was juicy and crispy, with that lovely coating that wasn't too thick.  The shrimp (ebi furai) was delicious.  I love ebi furai and they make it very well here.  With the cabbage covered in ponzu sauce, some Rokkyo to cut through the richness of the katsu, and some hot rice to compliment everything else, I didn't look up once through the entire meal.  It was just so much fun to dip in the katsu sesame sauce and then reach for rice, then drink some miso to balance everything.  In the end, I raped my plate of all its parts and tapped my tummy in approval.

But what--we cannot end a meal on entree alone.  A light, sweet dessert is required here, and what better to eat than a cream puff.  A cream puff that is made fresh, powdered with sugar, and filled generously with a whipped cream made in-house was the perfect way to end this ""ichiban"" meal.  The cream was silky and had just the right sweetness, with a puff that wasn't crispy as it was chewy and light.  Perfect ending to my day, indeed.

After paying the good man $56 for 2 drinks. 2 entress, 3 apps, and 2 desserts, my husband and I shuffled our cartoon-like full bellies into the car and headed home to hibernate.  I love places that have simple menus, provide good food and service, are very clean, and are priced well.  Tonkatsu Kiyoshi hits all those marks, which only means that they are on my go-to list when I am in dire need of a katsu, karaage, or ebi furai mix.  Thank you, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, for making my day brighter and my belly full.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,5,2,5,E90Gt6Xste9gcQCETibLrw

The inside was bigger than I thought. It was pretty spacious and there was a bar area for people dining alone. On the table is a jar of sesame seeds and a jar of katsu sauce. The server then gave us a tiny mortar and pestle that you use to grind the seeds. You can add this later on to the katsu sauce. That was an interesting experience for sure! 

So we ordered the gyoza to start. I had the Pork Curry Katsu and my boyfriend had the Chicken Katsu. Both of the katsus were delicious. They cooked it crispy on the outside while the meat remain moist. I hate dry katsu so they really hit it spot on at this place. What I think made them stood out the most from other Japanese places is their Katsu sauce. It is delicious with the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. I loved it so much that I even dipped my pork katsu more on that sauce rather than the curry sauce that it came with.

I highly recommend this place. I love their matcha green tea too. It was perfect.",F1_WWxCjdHhMKBjPS9ljvQ,2,0,4,lyYDOjBEtx9GMasjFFqq7A

Am I ashamed for knowing immediately that the restaurant was playing Az Yet? Maybe. 

Did I keep on living my life knowing my Az Yet secret was revealed at a tonkatsu house? You know it. 

Fortunate that my family lives pretty close to this place.  It's inside of a strip mall in a quiet, residential neighborhood. Definite must-try if you are in this area, which is kinda far from the Strip.

The first thing you do when you sit down is grind your own sesame seeds to make your dipping sauce. The mortar-and-pestle workout I call it. Then add katsu sauce to your creation.

We tried the panko crusted soft shell crab to start and it was excellent.  The shrimp and chicken katsu dinner was not at all greasy and very tasty. I think having the katsu rest and served  on a metal grate keeps it from getting soggy.  It comes out light and crispy.   I don't think you can go wrong with ordering any of the katsu they offer.

The staff is friendly and the prices are alright in my book. When we left the ipod was playing Shai. Are you serious?! I fully expect to hear some Jodeci or Hi-Five when I go back.",rzpbbpb_oBW42aJxL6ixlQ,0,0,4,0JZ0btUp4o8oLKtrQw-_-g

3087745,2018-06-15,0,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"I finally got around to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi when I was on this side of town. It's hard to go to a restaurant that only specializes in one aspect of Japanese cuisine but I really enjoyed the meal. From their specials board we ordered the chicken and corn croquette and fried spam musubi as well as an order of potato salad. I can't say I noticed much chicken in the croquette but the texture of the soft potato and crispy breading was comforting and delicious. I was skeptical of ordering the musubi cuz how much fried food do we really need in a meal but it was AWESOME. Very light breading with aonori seaweed flakes and a spicy mayo dipping sauce. It was really, really good. The potato salad was exactly what I wanted: cool and chunky potatoes with slices of celery and apple..? for added sweetness and crunch. 

Not that we needed any more food but I had the chicken katsu and my boyfriend got the katsu curry. The sets come with ""rice, miso soup and pickled vegetables"" which I guess are unlimited but I didn't need any more than I was served. I was a bit disappointed that ""pickled vegetables"" was only a few pickled onions but otherwise the meal was excellent. Make sure to mix the hot mustard with your katsu sauce and sesame seeds. They served a different sauce with my meal that I found tasted a lot like gin.. which was weird. My boyfriend loved the curry and it was a huge portion. 

Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is a bit of a specialty meal and not something I would crave more than a few times a year but it does katsu very well and the restaurant seems to do a swift business. I also appreciated the pacing of the meal, with dishes being brought out at the right time to enjoy the started before getting the main course.

The panko batter on both the chicken and pork was light and crunchy. I liked the chicken more because the pork lacked flavor. The curry was no different than the curry bars I have used at home. The rice was overcooked and mushy. I did like the well developed flavor profile of the miso soup and the ginger dressing on the salad was refreshing.

I went with my mom to try this place out because my mom is always down to eat Korean or Japanese food with me, so why not right? I heard about this place from some other yelpers and I was not disappointed! 

One thing I saw pictures of was grinding your own sesame seeds and putting in your sauce or something, so I was curious. What you do is grab a bowl, put in some sesame seeds, and you grind it yourself! You can grind it to the consistency of your desire and I thought this was a fun little activity to do while we waited for our food. 

I ordered some karaage with my mom, and surprisingly, it was not greasy or too oily, it was actually really good. The outside was really crispy and the inside was soft. This is a highly recommended appetizer! When our actual entrees came out, it comes with the meat you ordered, rice, soup, and a salad. I ordered the pork and I don't remember the name of it because there were two pork katsu items with different names... But they are the same thing, that's what the server told me. I was confused and so I ended up getting whatever that was. My mom got the chicken and my mom got double the meat I did it seemed, for a dollar less. Nothing to complain about there, just get the chicken next time! Like saw their combos, but from the pictures, I didn't think the extra piece of shrimp was worth the 5 bucks, so I passed. 

The food was amazing my gosh! The breading was so crispy and the meet was tender and juicy. This is definitely the place to get your katsu fix! You might miss the turn though because it's not in a big plaza, but if your food is good, people will find it, and you will find those people.

3353065,2015-11-28,4,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"As a native and local of San Francisco, being at my second home away from home can be a scary thought when it comes to food.  SF is hands down the best when it comes to amazing food packed into a small little city.  Anywhere you walk can potentially land you at an award winning restaurant... Even if not, the quality and flavors wouldn't be far off from being some of the best in the US.  The contrast would be Las Vegas.  The city is large and desolate when away from the busy vegas strip, and plazas w restaurants are plenty...... Getting your money's worth of good eats can be a real gamble.  Well, what did you expect?  You are in vegas after all.  When it comes to your money, everything is a gamble here.  Even a good bite.

If you intend on gambling your hard earned money on a good japanese curry, I'd say Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is a sure bet.  It's run by a family of Hawaiians serving up some really tasty dishes of curry.  Decor is inviting, simple, and clean.  Energy is good.  Expect to greeted in warm friendly fashion.  The lady whom I'd assume is part of the ownership was very caring when it came to their patrons from what I saw, as she engaged myself and others in a good old fashion chit chat.  As we spoke of random things from Hawaii to Las Vegas real estate, she slides over 2 wooden containers to me along w a pestle.  She says, ""Use this and make your own sauce.""  One was filled w toasted sesame while the other contained a sweet savory tangy Japanese bbq type sauce usually used w Tonkatsu or other fried foods.  So I took the pestle w one hand and scooped a mini ladle full of sesame into my little mortar w the other.  Mid way thru the grinding, the earthy and peanutty aroma began to release, caressing my appetite.  What a pleasant way to start my lunch.

My long awaited curry finally came my way.  The colors n the smell of curry was enough to make me throw my face into it... What etiquette?  None.   That first spoonful of fluffy japanese rice smothered in curry and crispy Panko crusted porkchop aka tonkatsu w a golden creamy runny yolk just made my entire day.  It was only a matter of minutes that I realized the plate was empty.  The struggle between being stuffed and wishing there was more.  The struggle was real.  

Although on the pricey side I feel at 19 bucks after adding an egg n tips, it was a very solid plate of Japanese comfort.  Writing this review just made me want to go get some curry for lunch... Ok I'm getting curry for lunch.",JwlHgkZuXS6rNE9Za2IVMA,8,4,5,J9FKqOr-TQnO8fbSJwS5CQ

3367967,2013-10-17,7,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"The tonkatsu here is so fresh and crispy!  It reminds me of the famous tonkatsu restaurant in Waikiki, Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin.  This restaurant just opened up 3 weeks ago and I have already been here 3 times... I think I like this place.

The owner Mark and his family run the restaurant.  He is from Japan originally but lived in HI before moving here to Vegas.  He is super nice and remembers me every time I come in.  I have had a chance to try a lot of their menu over the past 3 visits.

Appetizers:  The 2 most popular ones are the chicken karaage and the beef tataki.  The chicken is really good served with the lemon.  Beef comes with a ponzu sauce and tons of onions!  Yum.

Entrees:  The Hire katsu is a classic pork katsu that is juicy and not dried out like a lot of the pork katsu's I've had before.  Simple and delicious.  The Katsu curry is nice because it is the same pork as the Hire katsu but served with Japanese curry and veggies on the side.  It gives you the option to use the curry sauce or the tonkatsu sauce to dip your meat in.  The Katsu-don is a bowl of pork katsu and rice served with an egg cooked on top of it with onions and a soupy sauce.  I preferred the other two dishes more because the cripsy crust is slightly soggier with the egg and onions on top.  The salmon and shrimp katsu is a nice option if you want to mix things up.  I have never had salmon katsu before!  

Dessert:  I have only tried the melon floats but they are delicious!  Green melon soda with ice cream!

The funnest part about this place is that you get to make your own tonkatsu sauce... sorta.  You use the little mortar and pestle to grind your sesame seeds and then you mix the seeds with the tonkatsu sauce.  Their sauce is soooo good!   I think it is the best tonkatsu sauce I have had.

There are six tables and a bar-type area for seating. You're welcomed immediately with a nice ""Irrashaimase!"" and it sounds like they've practiced because the pronounciation sounded almost native Japanese. The tables are a good size and the seats are comfy. In the middle of the table is a nice set up where you can mix up your own tonkatsu sauce and roasted sesame seeds. Pretty damn brilliant.

For starters we got the karaage chicken and beef tataki. Excellent dishes. The presentation and portioning are just right, and so is the price. For the main course, I had the Hire & Ebi combo and let me tell you, the breading and texture were just like back home in Japan. The presentation was just like you'd walked into a tonkatsu place in Shinjuku or Yokohama. These guys pulled it off legit. To finish things off, you must, MUST try their yuzu pannacotta. Get there early and order it quick, because they'll sell out.

I had the chicken katsu and ebi katsu combo dinner. It came with breaded chicken and breaded shrimp, cabbage salad, a bowl of perfectly cooked, fluffy white rice, Japanese pickled daikon and miso soup.

This made my husband almost lose his cool. $1.25 for a can of soda is very un-American for a restaurant. If the soda machine is broken or if you don't have one, I think the customer should know beforehand. Lastly, our server yesterday was very unhappy.

The restaurant is very new (opened Sept. 2013) and clean. Simple decor. When you walk in to the restaurant you are greeted enthusiastically.

My son ate the pork tonkatsu and shrimp katsu combo and I ate the pork tonkatsu curry and rice. Delicious. You grind sesame seeds and mix it with the slightly spicy tonkatsu sauce. This sauce mix sets this restaurant apart from the rest. My son tried the melon float which was very yummy.

Price is a little more than the average ""plate lunch"". My dish was $13 and I believe my son's was $16-$17. Spend a few more dollars eating there instead of in the slot machine!

Decorated with those ""good luck"" bamboo plants/trees, various Asian prints and curtains. What a difference interior design makes in a place...It's hard to believe that Rice Trax was here.
 
Of course, the 1st thing I did when I sat was make my very own tonkatsu sauce. Kinda fun as I've never used a mortar before. My nephew (who doesn't like sauces of any sort) even had me make some for him.

We ordered the katsu curry, chicken karaage, beef tatake, edamame, and salmon katsu. 
- Beef tataki was the winner for me. Seared beef and ponzu sauce are always a win.
- Chicken karaage had a nice breading on it, which also made for crispy ""fried chicken."" But, the chicken wasn't burnt. Thin pieces of chicken which made for fairly juicy chicken.
- Katsu curry was nice. Wish the curry was a little more spicy but nothing a few chili peppers (on the side) can't solve.
- Salmon curry was breaded as nicely as the chicken karaage and katsu. Salmon was pretty thick and didn't fall apart when bitten. The best part of that salmon katsu was the salad that came with it. Standard Asian cabbage/slaw but, the yuzo/ponzu dressing was amazing! The owners came by to give us more dressing =)
- Pickled onions, cucumbers on the side were delish. You can tell the freshness and that it was homemade. The owners were telling us that they get many requests for kim chee so, that may be a possibility.

Overall great experience an the food was very good. Nice to have a tonkatsu spot in the area as tonkatsu this good is few and far between.
Service was great. You can tell it's a family run business and the owners take pride in the food they serve!",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,5,4,4,nBjhhZDg_VJb4J_z3dTbFA

3759775,2017-11-30,0,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"A nice little spot in the southern area of Vegas for Katsu (cutlet) connoisseurs,Tonkatsu Kiyoshi provides a nice change from the many little restaurants in the area by specializing in a dish served in many Japanese restaurants consider mostly to be an afterthought (or an alternative to whatever they specialize in). 

Customers are given the option to create their own katsu sauce at their tables,and the katsu itself is fluffy and rich -- unlike the cheap imitations you get at certain Hawaiian spots. 

I prefer to order to go instead of dining in (I get the Donburi,which already has its own sauce) as the restaurant is fairly small (only 6-8 tables). 

Although the service is good (and the owner is very friendly!),the close proximity of the venue makes for a somewhat uncomfortable setting as the low benches and the servers walking around get a little awkward. 

The location of the place -- off of Jones/Robindale in a tiny strip mall -- is also a little hidden,making it somewhat of a mission to go to and parking sometimes a challenge. 

Hopefully this place takes off! Would be great in a more central location and in a bigger space because the concept (and the food!) is great.",uCK07bLSTIWP4K88VvGW_g,0,0,3,BZeeA78cHZrD1NC5IC10rg

I'm a big fan of Tonkatsu Kiyoshi. The workers are always very friendly and attentive.

I usually go for their tonkatsu curry plate and I've never been disappointed. Their curry even has veggies in it! 

They do the mortar and pestle to grind up your sesame seeds for the katsu sauce. It's a fun thing to do and kill time before your katsu arrives! Besides the tonkatsu, they also have chicken, different cuts of pork and ebi fry. I've also tried their Japanese potato salad and gyoza. Both were good. Nothing spectacular but I would expect their katsu to really shine, and it does!

FOOD
I orderd their chicken katsu plate which came with rice, miso soup and shredded cabbage salad. It is little bit over $10 and is a good portion. While you wait for your order, you can grind up the sesame seeds that you can mix in with katsu sauce for that extra touch of flavor. 

Juicy and crunchy katsu. Add that sesame seeds you ground up with your heart and soul into their katsu sauce. Dip your katsu in that sauce. Bazinga. Goes amazingly well with their fluffy bowl of white rice. Mmh.

Today I chose the pork katsu don which is a bowl with a bunch of sauce, grilled onions, and an egg on top. It was a big portion for a bowl which I was glad about. The meat was a bit over cooked in my opinion but the flavors were there.

Ever since we told the server about that particular dish being a little too salty, he stopped coming over to our table. We asked for extra plain noodle on the side to offset the saltiness and I had no problem paying extra for it but man..  Given the circumstance, the entire time we were being as polite as possible, the attitude we received from the server was unacceptable.

4107207,2016-03-24,5,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"I went back to another business that has seemingly been forgotten by Yelpers, including yours truly. It should not remain overlooked.

I was in the mood for something comforting today. With plenty of fried goodness, the menu at Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is pretty much Japanese comfort food. It's also not too far from some of my favorite sweets spots on Rainbow Blvd, which is always a good thing.

The first thing you do after ordering is load up your sauce bowl with sesame seeds from one of the hexagonal containers at the table, grab your pestle, and start grinding away. When you're satisfied with the amount of sesame powder, ladle katsu sauce from the other table and stir (probably with chopsticks). Eat this mixture with your katsu, or just nibble on it while waiting for whatever else you've ordered.

Takoyaki ($5): best rendition I've had yet. These morsels are served hot but not scalding hot, and they has that crispy exterior, soft interior, and chewy yet tender octopus. The bonito flakes and the creamy and sweet sauces complete the delicious flavor profile.

Agedashi Tofu ($4): my friend's pick from the several side dishes. Nice soft tofu and miso broth, but the skin is overly chewy. Note that it's not straightforward to share this dish because it's one big cube of tofu.

Hire Katsu ($13): a nice portion of breaded, fried pork tenderloin, served with miso soup, rice, thinly shredded cabbage with what seemed like a ponzu sauce, a dab of wasabi, and some pickled pearl onions. The katsu itself is a bit bland, but it's obviously meant to be eaten with the sauce and sides and contributes all the meatiness and crunch that you could want in that comprehensive mouthful. The cabbage was refreshing and the ponzu was so useful. I missed that in my first visit because the donburi lacks it entirely. It's a great entree for a big lunch or as part of dinner.

My friend is already planning to go back to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi tomorrow, and I'm sure I'll be around significantly more often. It's an excellent katsu restaurant and is worth the drive even without its proximity to some of my other frequent stops.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,12,11,5,f8nnEzMhNPf7WB10tOq-nA

You pour the donkatsu sauce over the ground seeds and dip each bite into the mixture. The katsu sauce is sweet like a plumb but not overpowering. A small side salad and bowl of Miso soup comes with the meal. The Katsu is presliced but not too thick where you can't bit a piece into half or thirds to enjoy!
My son inhaled his so I know he enjoyed it. I am not a huge rice eater but the fried egg, seaweed and katsu mixed together was a good bite.

I remember being overwhelmed by how expensive this place was for basically a rice bowl. Yeah you get a miso soup and a salad, big woop. 

I had ordered the Hire Katsu dinner which was slightly undercooked. My friend ordered the Katsu curry, which is a joke, because they use the same curry base from the box you get for $1.50 at 99 ranch market. So to be charged $11 for something i can make by heating up in the microwave at home bugs me. I also remember wasting a lot of time and effort grinding the sesame seeds to not even use it in the end. 

So I tried to give it another try a couple years later, and am still not impressed. Not sure if the prices have been the same or got even more expensive. My friend and I ordered the chicken and the Katsu donburi. This time a little overcooked but nothing to be upset about.

We took a little long in deciding and ended up arriving at 9:55- they close at 10. I really didn't want to be THAT jerk, but I was so set on katsu at this point that I poked my head in and asked if they were still open and they graciously gave us a table. The owners here are from Hawaii and the service definitely reflects that- genuine, helpful, and you can tell they take pride in what they're putting out.

The potato salad we started with was more vinegary than I'm used to for Japanese style, but delicious nonetheless. It was smooth with cubes of crisp apple and cucumber throughout, and distinctly eggy from the shredded egg lacing through it.

The katsu was a work of art, truly. Perfectly cooked cal rose rice with crispy golden sliced katsu over the top. My sister had the chicken and ebi combo while I opted for the katsu curry. Miso soup comes with all meals here, and it was definitely a robust version. 
The chicken and shrimp came with cabbage salad with Yuzu to dress it on the side, as well as some pickled shallots. The cabbage salad was a perfect fresh compliment to the crunchy fried katsu goodness. Everything was cooked perfectly and the shrimp were gigantic and absolutely incredible! The menu stated that they use black tiger prawns and they weren't kidding.
The katsu curry was very flavorful and the curry itself was thick and could stand up on its own. This dish came simply with pickled ginger and was enormous! All portions here are enough to make two meals out of, unless the katsu is so overwhemingly addicting that you just eat until you pseudo-hate yourself.

Being that it was my first time here, I was a noob to the whole sauce bit. I've never ground my own sesame for katsu sauce, it's just always arrived with my meal!

When we first walked in, we were sat by a gentleman who didn't say a word to us except sit right over here. There was no language barrier, he just seemed entertained with the people he seemed to know instead of dealing with other customers. 

He came over about 10minutes after seating us and asked us what we wanted to  order. Explained to him that this was the first time here so we didn't know what to do with the sesame seeds and sauce. 

Instead of explaining it, he just put everything into the grinding bowls and started to do it with no smile on his face. 

Still this seemed like a cute place so we can overlook the depressing man. We ordered our food and it was good and tasteful. The Donbari, I believe it was called, was flavorful and had a thick cut of pork so worth it.

Service was the thing that knocked this down the furthest. We had to wait FOREVER for our check and then had to called them over to remind them to bring it back...

I personally love their in-house Tonkatsu sauce and sesame seed combo where I can grind and flavor my own sauce.

Price:
With the surrounding places nearby Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is on the pricer scale. With my one curry order (no soft drinks) at $14.00.

Overall I would go back when I have a hankering for some Tonkatsu.",Ei22-dnNo0xPXx472sQJGA,0,0,4,BZ20lfTU5cJ9wCTFs9LP6Q

Couple things I noticed about this place... First, it's deep on the south side of town. It doesn't bother me as much since this is my neighborhood. However, if this place seeks to be a busy business, it's a far reach. Second, if it wasn't for word of mouth and a flyer, I probably wouldn't have found this place. It's literally hidden. The strip mall itself is brand new and it's located in a residential area. The place itself is small for a restaurant but it's cozy. 

Now... For the food... I'm a fan of Katsu dishes. For the price that you pay on this joint, it's pretty loaded. You get a decent amount of food for your order. It comes with Miso soup as well. I was lucky to have met the owner during my visit and he was very accommodating (asking if it's your first time and what not), introduces you to the menu and lays you the details. As soon as your order is taken, you have the chance to make your own Katsu dressing. They have all the ingredients laid out on a small tray on every table. This allows you to set your own sauce for your liking. 

I forgot the name of the dish I ordered but it came with shrimp tempura and the Katsu itself, paired with rice, cabbage and Miso soup. I'm a very simple guy when it comes to taste. I believe my dish was served well. The amount of breading used wasn't overboard either. Seasoning is just right and not too salty. Unfortunately, i went here on a Monday night and I was the only one eating. It made the experience a little awkward since everyone was pretty much just staring at me while I pig out. 

I would definitely give this place another go. It's the type of joint you won't go to as much considering the prices of their food but it's a thumbs up in my book. The place has potential. It just needs to market itself more due to its location. Hopefully, it will pick up business when the sports bar next door opens.",A872opA-l6OeCy9x1b2QFw,2,2,4,LrViCDwNhoqnR6vzOVTJ-g

She was about to seat me at one of the free tables in the front and asked how many were in my party. I told her it was just me and she suddenly had a party of 10(!) coming in and refused to seat me. This is not exactly the type of restaurant one makes a reservation at, not to mention there were only 8 free chairs left in the entire place. Something sure stinks, and in my opinion it smells a little like RACISM.

I will be telling everyone I know NEVER to patronize this establishment.

--- 

Since it looks like Yelp doesn't post responses to responses on the review page, I wish to point out that every single website I've been able to find listing this restaurant, including yelp itself, indicates that the restaurant does not accept reservations. This is as of 11/16/16. Be sure that this will now magically change in order to fit the story Meredith has put forward about a 7pm reservation. 

I think the ownership needs to take a good look at the reviews for their business. There are several on here that note one of the employees yelling across the restaurant at customers. Additionally, I don't appreciate the lie about not being able to hear. You asked me straight to my face how many were in my party and then when I said it was just me, which you seemed to hear just fine, you told me oh we have a reservation for 10 coming in. Why would you ask me how many were in my party at all if you weren't planning to seat me? Where were the other 2 patrons in the party of 10 going to sit? There were only 8 free chairs in the entire restaurant - trust me I looked around and counted seats when you told me there was a party of 10 coming into a 25 seat restaurant. This is about as ridiculous as making a reservation at the L&L or Grand Sign Kitchen, 2 of your local competitors.",xFWfc4ZaUJFHbIgtBWhEaA,1,0,1,sYYIaFYMOsbDPPyUt3uLOw

The breading/crust on the katsu here is a winner for sure~!!!
Light, crispy, not oily & DELISH.

The restaurant is made up of like 6 tables and a countertop for solo diners. 
You get seated, grind yourself some sesame seeds using the mortar and pestle provided and create your own katsu sauce.. Cool idea but the germaphobe in me got a little creeped out by all the possible sharing of germs that happens during this process since you spoon out the seeds/sauce rather than shake/squeeze out.. Also, do you put the pestle back in its place after using or give it to the server to wash?!?!? 
LOL ok enough with the mortar and pestle ;ppp

-Chicken Katsu ($9) Comes with miso soup, pickled pearl onions, rice, salad & 2 chicken katsu breasts. The chicken katsu was juicy and tender and like I mentioned before the breading was on point. The shredded cabbage salad comes with ponzu dressing which was ok but fills you up without eating the rice. 
-Chicken Katsu with Curry ($12) Comes with miso soup, pickled ginger, rice, 1 chicken katsu breast and curry. The curry has some potatoes and carrots but tastes like something out of a box. I say skip the Katsu Curry plate and just get the Katsu plate because you get more katsu, you get salad & it's cheaper!!! 

Service was friendly. Food took about 10 minutes to come out. I wish they had some zaru soba or udon on their menu & oops I forgot to ask if they have brown rice!",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,5,2,4,wb0_OoyCTtI9sBRVHeE0bQ
4934629,2014-02-23,3,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"Try this place now! If you are in the south part of Vegas south of the 215, this is a great place to stop and try.  We drove out here to try it out from Henderson and it was totally worth it. As usual, I read reviews before trying this place out / driving 15 miles and the reviews of Rod U, Lawrence C and Jennifer D caused me to be quite ready for this evening's quest.

a. Normally - I am normally getting Tonkatsu or Chicken Katsu from a place like L and L Hawaiian.  Oddly, there was an L and L a few blocks away from this place.  While I find it extremely convenient to get it from L and L, I also know it is like me getting chow mein or fried rice at Panda.  Edible, comforting, but just not the same.  Here at TK, this is the real deal in Tonkatsu.

b.  Ahhh Curry - There are a few pleasures in foodie life and Japanese Curry is one of them. I love all types of curry, = Thai, Indian, Chinese, Japanese.  From the hottest to the mildest.  However, I find that the Japanese Curry like what they have here is simply the best. If you like mild curry over rice with carrots and potatoes, this is it.

c.  Miso Soup - I pretty much always have miso paste at home and make plenty of variations of miso soup from hearty vegetables soup to your basic miso.  I consider myself a Miso fan and the miso here is pretty darn good. Finished mine and most of my wives.  Yep, and I slurped it all without using a spoon.  Just slurped away and used the chopsticks.  Now, while I am not Japanese, I find that eating the soup like they do in Japan, by putting your mouth to the bowl and drinking, using the chopsticks for the bits you cannot swaggle down is a great way to enjoy the soup. Here the soup was just right. Be sure to chuggle it down while it is hot. I also keep getting spell check warnings here, so I am sure swaggle and chuggle are not words but that is what comes to mind with this Miso Soup.

d.  The TK Sauce - What am I to do with the sesame seed and the tonkatsu sauce, mortar and pestle?  See, I have been trained to eat tonkatsu at L and L and am used to having the sauce in a little plastic takeaway thingamajig.  Here you get to pour out a good spoonful or so of sesame seed, and use the pestle to grind down the seeds to mix it with the sauce.  That was fun and since I did not have a clue, I had to ask the waitress how on rudimentary tonkatsu sauce preparation.  I am so glad I did, i love learning about foods and processes and tradition. And, this was FUN!

e.  What to order - I was totally befuddled in what to order. While my wife ordered the ""Hire"" tonkatsu, I was stuck between the Hire,, the Ebi and the Curry. Reading the reviews and all, I wanted to try them all.  So, I asked the waitress, what to do what to do.  See, there relatively small but perfect menu did not have this combo on it.  So she said, order the Hire, Ebi, Curry combo.  Yep, they said they could put that together no problem!  That was cool.

Hire Katsu - Plenty big portion and very tender and crispy, light and delicate.  I really enjoyed it, okay, compared to my norm and limited experience.

Miso Soup, Shaved Cabbage, Scallion and a sauce for the cabbage round out this dish. All was just right. I could have ate a bunch more of the pickled scallion, Rakkyo, they give you.

Curry - The plate was in a yin yang fashion with Japanese rice on the yin and the curry on the yang.  Then, a bit of Hire Katsu and Ebi Katsu on the rice.  If you are ancient like I am, it was like that old tootsie pop commercial where the kid is trying to find out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop.  (See this youtube if you are too young).  Anyhoo,  I was pretty darn anxious to get to the curry and rice so I am not sure but I did a David Copperfield on the Ebi and Hire Katsu and they disappeared quickly. Then I got to the curry and rice.  I have not been eating white rice for a long time and here I made an exception because this was like the best ono thing to do!

Hot Tea - I ordered hot tea and got an ever filling cup of ocha, that was pretty darn good.  Could have been a bit hotter, but it was full of flavor.

f.  How about that service - Now, the last place I was at, was Bachi Burger for the wifey's birthday and well, the service from the maitre'd, shift manager and server was absolutely horrendous, I can tell you that the service here is the exact opposite!  WE have very attentive service, from the host, the waitress, to the big guy checking on us.  I mean, I felt like I was at a five star dining service or flying first class on Singapore Airlines.  It was just right. 

In the end, we were so happy with the food, the service, the experience, we actually ordered two more dishes for take out. We are thinking about sharing this with the kids who were out with friends while we were basking in the glories of tonkatsu delight.

Three - That is how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,14,7,5,A-UXpu3Xr4QHk9Ii81x-kw
4939658,2013-09-26,1,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"It is with great sadness that I have to give them 3 stars, but I have to stick to my guns and rate the restaurants based on food.  

I am passionate about Tonkatsu.  Please...don't confuse this with tonkOtsu as in Monta ramen.  Ton means pig.  KAtsu is something fried with panko.  KOtsu is bone as in pork bone broth you make Ramen out of, so please get it straight.  Katsu NOT Kotsu.  

When I was in Japan this spring I must have had 3 or 4 tonkatsu meals.  Tonkatsu restaurants are ubiquitous there, not quite as many as Ramen ya's or 7 11's, but you won't have any difficulty finding one when you are in the mood for it. Tonkatsu is a very narrow niche, they only serve fried pork loin (rosu katsu), pork filet (hile katsu), and some places may serve fried prawns and such, but that's usually about it.  Most places do fried oysters from Fall to spring.  Tonkatsu restaurants are somewhat different from other genres like sushi or ramen because people don't/can't make nigiri sushi or ramen from scratch at home, but tokatsu is not very difficult to cook at home.  Then how come tonkatsu restaurants are so popular?  Well...it's because they tend to be cheap, and it's a mess to make at home with deep frying and all, but the most important factor is that SOMEHOW....it tastes so much better when the pros do it.  It's just pork, salt/pepper, egg, flour, and panko deep fried, but I just can't make them like they do in Tokatsu restaurants, that's why I go out to Wako, Saboten, Maisen, etc, with their soft/crispy fried panko layer, but when you sink your teeth into it it oozes with all that nice pork fat juice, that's why!  Somehow it doesn't turn out like that at home.

As I have been saying for years that Vegas needs a tonkatsu place, I was ecstatic to hear that Kiyoshi opened.  it's in the SE corner of Jones and Robindale and it is a cozy clean place with great friendly service.  

The menu was a bit busier than I liked but seemed legit and there was rosu katsu as I wanted.  You go to Tonkatsu place, you get rosu katsu.  Tonkatsu restaurants live or die with rosu katsu.  

Each table has a sesame grinder and a pot of tonkatsu sauce.  You grind as much sesame you want and add a tonkatsu sauce to make your sesame flavored sauce.  

Rosu katsu set looked authentic and promising.  What didn't...was the katsu itself.  It looked a little too brown, dry, and the outer panko layer has separated from the meat and fell apart as it was picked up.  It tasted dry and I could not enjoy any of the juicy pork fat as I bit into it.  It's like going to a Ramen place and having a broth that was tasteless with floppy overcooked noodle.  

As I mentioned earlier, it's not hard to cook your own tonkatsu.  In order for me to go and pay money for it, it has to be better, MUCH better than what I can make at home and this wasn't the case.  I'm hoping that perhaps mine was a flop.  But the appeal of eating pork/tonkatsu is in the fat and this particular rosu katsu was not fatty/juicy enough, partially due to overcooking.  I would highly recommend them to keep on working at it until when cut into katsu, a nice juicy pork fat flows out and that meat is ever so slighlty pink.  In japan they use ""mukin"" pork where there is no concern for parasites so some tonkatsu places serve their katsu pretty pinkish.  Doing so in the U.S. probably won't fly, but it certainly does NOT need to be overcooked as they did.

This place has potential, but they need some work on their katsu, perhaps a lot more than ""some"".   I will visit again and hope to see something that doesn't shame their existence as a tonkatsu-ya.  Until then....I'll keep cooking tonkatsu at home.",I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,9,3,3,r0VIfEC1R8U4hE3Ct6uzMg

4974755,2017-06-23,2,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is a small family-owned restaurant that can be easily missed if you don't know where it is.  With a handful of tables and a few counter seats, it would be smart to call ahead to check how busy they are.  Weeknights can be pretty busy for them.  We've been fans since the beginning and are happy to support mom and pop shops.  

We usually get the Hire Katsu Dinner ""pork tenderloin katsu"" ($13) and the Ebi Fry Katsu Dinner ""black tiger prawn katsu"" ($16).  All the katsu dinners come with rice, miso soup, cabbage slaw, and pickles.  Apparently there are free refills on the rice, soup, and slaw.  Be sure to ask though. I personally love the cabbage slaw since it's refreshing against the heavy katsu sauce.   While you are waiting for your order, you can grind up your toasted sesame seeds into a fine powder with the provided mortal and pestle and mix it into the katsu sauce.  We also add the Agedashi Tofu ""deep fried tofu with dashi sauce"" ($4), the Shishito Peppers ""lightly fried and salted"" ($4.50), the Panko Crusted Soft Shell Crab ""breaded fried soft shell crab"" ($7), the Ika Geso ""fried squid legs"" ($5.50) and/or the Gyoza ""pan fried pork, chicken and vegetable pot stickers"" ($5) to round out the meal for us and the kids.

The Japanese curry dishes are pretty tasty and popular as well.  They have pork and chicken options for that.  One of their newer items that have been getting some attention is the Fried Musubi ""served with teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo"" ($3.50).  I have yet to try it, but musubis are pretty loved in this house.

Some of the desserts we've enjoyed have been the Melon Cream Soda Float and the Yuzu Panna Cotta (which I don't think is available anymore).

Service is great.  Staff is super friendly and it's nice to see the same people working throughout the years.

4986648,2014-09-21,0,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"Tried Tonkatsu Kiyoshi last night. It was recommended to us by our sister-in-law. When we first arrived, the place was packed. Both the bar seats and tables were full. There was one group of 4 waiting for a table ahead of us, but we were able to squeeze into a seat at the bar. The decor and atmosphere of the tiny restaurant did not seem thought out too well. I think the main turn off was how incredibly bright the place was. I think if there's one major detail to dining out, it's good lighting. The waitress was handling all the checks at the bar, and there was really no separation between the back counter and the bar, so that was a little odd too. We could see the employees personal things piled on a chair in front, along with what looked like a bug zapper. Weird. There was also a basket of pens and crap on the bar too, which I think was a little distracting at first. 

We ordered the edamame and beef tataki to start. The beef tataki was served with shredded onions and citrus ponzu that I mixed with grated daikon. I really enjoyed that. So good. 

For dinner I ordered the Tonkatsu and shrimp combo which is a pretty good deal, considering it comes with miso, rice, shredded cabbage salad and pickled onions. It's a good size portion as well. You mixed your own katsu sauce too at the table (which is basically just grinding sesame seeds, then poring in Tonkatsu sauce) The shrimp was huge too, like prawn size. And they lay the fried katsu meats on a wire rack to keep it crispy, which is always a good thing. I thought my meal was delicious and worth the $16 that it cost. 

My bf orders the katsu curry, which came with miso, rice, curry and katsu. He devoured his dish so it must have been tasty. 

For dessert, we got the green tea cheesecake, which was good too, but a lot of Japanese restaurants carry that as a dessert item. I was happy with the meal, just wish they could create a better ambiance by fixing that damn lighting.",WRnqI0l71Bi9wK2wsnETSQ,0,0,4,nzMKt_iMC0ZXroit2_NSRg

I don't imagine many tourists come out to this place, as noted when the business owner seemed surprised we were there. We wouldn't have known this place existed either if my cousin didn't know locals and ask them for recommendations while in town.

It is away from the strip in an unassuming shopping center. The place is small and cozy. We sat at the counter where we had the opportunity to chat with the owner occasionally.

After waiting for 20 mins we got seated.  Our waitress was super bubbly and friendly from Taiwan.  I ordered the chicken  katsu curry, and my friends both got the pork katsu curry.  Food came out relatively quickly but because they were busy we had to remind them to get us lemons for our water and bowls to put our sauces in.   The funnest part about this meal is that you get a grinder to grind up your own sesame seeds for the katsu sauce.  You can grind it as coarse or as fine to your tasting.  

When my chicken katsu came, I was really disappointed at how small it was, hence the 4 stars.  I wish the chicken cutlet was bigger.  Nonetheless, the fry on my chicken was excellent.  The outside was light and crispy but the chicken was moist and flavorful on the inside.  The curry was basic.  Tastes like the ""golden curry"" you can buy at stores and make at home.

They have exceptional service. Whenever my water was empty the waitress would run over and fill it immediately. The interior was really cute, a few tables and a large bar. They don't serve beer yet which is a shame because I guess they're a fairly new restaurant and still awaiting on their liquor license.

It came with miso soup and this yummy shredded lettuce salad. Also, we got the beef tataki $7 which was cooked perfectly, and decorated with a bed of onions and some weird sauce. Lastly, we got the soft shell crab $7 which was ahhhhhhmaaaaaaazzzzinnnngggg! I will definitely be getting that again.

Our total bill was 30$ which is a steal. I was definitely be back, I want to see if they will make me a chicken katsu curry because I do not eat pork!",c2MQ_LPuvtiiKFR_-OY9pg,2,3,4,XY9EVr6Eb87gZpDPDEvVHg

The BF and I got the Hire (pork tenderloin) and the Rosu (thick cut pork loin) to compare the two tonkatsu offerings. We both liked the hire better which is thinner sliced, a bit more tender and had more crunch to meat ratio. The rosu is good if you like a meatier, pork chop type cut. If pork isn't your thing, they have seafood and chicken katsu offerings.

Each meal comes with thin shaved cabbage with a refreshing yuzu dressing, lovely sticky rice, rakkyo pickles, and a stronger than average miso soup. It makes for a simple and comforting meal. I thought the portions were good as we were both comfortably full. Your katsu sauce is a interactive type thing. You grind your sesame seeds and mix with the katsu sauce to your liking from a tray on your table. I don't know if it is homemade sauce, but I thought it was balanced flavor. 

Service was friendly and decent. There was chatter of Japanese patrons enjoying their meal which was comforting. It definitely is one of the better katsu to be had in this city, quite on par with some favorites I have outside of Vegas.

Usually I eat at Indian restaurants and occasionally I have some Thai curry but this was no match for either. 

We started with appetizers, of course. Their special fried oysters(5$) and some seaweed salad(2.50$) 
The oysters were AMAZING! The sauce that it comes with just melts in your mouth. Definitely top 5 oysters I've ever had. The seaweed salad was pretty standard, it was delicious but not a MUST-HAVE. 

I checked in on Yelp for their free side of potato salad and never received it but we were already getting full from the appetizers so we wouldn't have been able to enjoy it fully. 

I ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry (11$) and the portion was humongous! It came with a side salad, and miso soup. The soup was fantastic. Finally, a soup that tasted fresh and not frozen from a bag! 
The salad on the other hand had barely a sprinkle of any sort of dressing. That's something that needs to be changed. 

The curry itself is a must have and I can't want to try the rest of the items on their menu! 

Last but certainly not least. The Green Tea Cheesecake! It was a small portion for 5$ but the cheesecake was so delicious I didn't care about the price. It comes with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream as well.

Tonkatsu Kiyoshi makes the most tender and meaty on the inside and crunchy on the outside chicken katsu.  I've been to many Hawaiian/Japanese places and nothing is comparable.  The chicken katsu curry ($11) was served with a generous amount of rice, and a side of miso soup and salad.  The curry was excellent with chunks of carrot and potato.

The salmon katsu ($15) was also very good. It comes with a cabbage salad with delicious ponzu dressing, side of pickled onions, and miso soup.  I love that you can customize your own katsu sauce with the provided sesame seeds and katsu sauce at the table.  

The melon soda float was good, but for me a one and done kind of thing. 

The menu offers appetizers like karaage, shishito peppers, and sliders, which I will have to try on a future visit.  They also have a dessert menu that includes a green tea cheesecake, which I also plan to try next time.

Service was on point here and super friendly.  Staff was attentive and knowledgeable and made great suggestions.

Service is excellent!! Upon arriving we are always greeted   with a warm welcoming smile & hello from Meredith (Owner) and the rest of the staff. We see the owner every time we dine in or come in to pick up our take out order we placed over the phone. She is very nice and attentive.

Price is a bit up there $10-16 per meal but the portions are pretty big depending on how hungry you are of course. Katsu meals come with miso soup, rice, Japanese pickles, cabbage salad, and your choice of Katsu. 

Ebi & Salmon Katsu - Great! Ebi are Tiger Prawns so are pretty big. Salmon is delicious! Perfectly cooked not dry

Chicken Katsu - Good! Moist not dry

Pork Katsu - Great!

Curry - I love their curry here. It's nice and thick like how Japanese curry should be

Beef Tataki - perfectly seasoned. Smaller sized portion

Croquettes - really good! Same batter as the Katsu 

Potatoe salad - good

Deep Fried Spam Musubi - Excellent! Only place in town I know that makes this here so far. 

We come here all the time. Food and service is delicious. My kids love coming here also bc they get to make their own sauce by grinding up the sesame seeds to mix with the Katsu sauce.

5094954,2013-10-29,18,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"Lost in translation?

What it should be:  A working businessman's meal.  100g-150g of high quality, heritage pork, coated in fresh bread crumbs and fried golden brown.  The small portion is accompanied by AYCE rice and cabbage.  Do it yourself sesame based sauces for the tonkatsu and to dress the cabbage.

What they offer:  A simple menu.  Choice of either the softer, less fatty tenderloin of the slightly more firm loin from an everyday pig.  Served traditionally or as a donburi or with curry.  Rice, miso soup, and cabbage completes the meal (not AYCE).  Make your own sauce, grinding your sesame seeds and mixing in the house sauce which has a good dark soy background and hints of plum perfume.  

What I got:  Tried both the tenderloin and loin.  An oily, excessively thick eggy crust of not freshly made breadcrumbs (taste like store bought panko) surrounding an over cooked piece of pork.  Hawaii yeeps, think L&L quality.

Ultimately it's better than your average plate lunch place and not a bad deal for the novelty and price.  Tonkatsu snobs, look elsewhere.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,28,19,2,hVTriUQwOkAiTDGlbklRuA

Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is of the first variety. Succulent, perfectly cooked morsels of pork, chicken or salmon. Here, you get authentic Japanese tonkatsu, but in Las Vegas, NV, of all places! And in a nondescript mini mall out in the suburbs. 
The portions are large, with delicious white rice, miso soup, pickled onions, salad, and a nice dollop of potent mustard to accompany the table-ground sesame seed tonkatsu sauce.
I have eaten at this restaurant at least 15 times and I often take out-of-town guests. It never disappoints.

Tonkatsu Kiyoshi absolutely knows what they're doing and serves up some of the best katsu and donburi I have ever had.  The place just opened a few months ago but it has a great story and family tradition of delicious cuisine from Japan.  

The mega surprise was the Tonkatsu (Pork) Katsu Donburi.  Thoughtfully garnished with tender roasted sushito peppers, the savory bowl is layered with thick, JUICY cuts of lean pork covered with perfectly golden and crisp panko breadding.  To finish it off comes a smothering of a flavorful collaboration of  delicious egg, onion, dashi soy sauce and other seasonings.  This simmer of flavors was poured on top of the rice and settled to the bottom of the bowl making the rice SO DAMN TASTY!  

Curry Katsu and chicken Katsu were delicious too.  Don't forget to order some sides.  My favorite was the potato salad with diced apples to add a little sweet and crunch to an already good salad.  There is katsu sauce tableside and you can add some roasted sesame and mix it up with your own mortar and pestle .

This place is good, no doubt.  It is now on my list to visit every time I go to Vegas.  It was a hit with the kids.  Come for a late lunch to avoid the crowds.  Show this place some love and give it a try and you might become a regular too.",7J6Hb7VuTsJq50iiNwqvCg,10,8,5,y0hKBPjp4bh2qwtOFJKXPQ

Katsu Curry ($12): Pork Tenderloin Katsu with Curry Rice. Pork was PERFECT! Juicy, tender insides with a crunchy yet soft breading on the outside!  I really don't know how else it could be BETTER...seriously, it was as good as it gets for simple Katsu!

The Curry itself had much more FLAVOR than the ""other"" Japanese curry house as well.  The other tasted like a boring gravy that I had to sprinkle tons of seasoning into  for something to really stand out.  This one is good on its own, but even better with a little bit of love!  

Also tried the Melon Cream Soda Float ($3.25). Nice change of pace! The soda itself is super sweet esp combining with the ice cream, but it is pretty tasty overall.  Give it a shot if you need to calm a sweet tooth!

I thought prices were fair and the portions were pretty large.  If this place was in Chinatown, it would be packed!

5220918,2017-03-20,0,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"For starters, I hate katsu and I am not a fan of it at all. However, my friends wanted to go there and I figured I'd might as well work with something new. We came in right before the dinner rush and was seated within 5 minutes. We were given menus to look over and they did not ask us for our drinks until 10 minutes after seating. They didn't take our order until 25 minutes after being seated. It was frustrating because like I have mentioned, I hate katsu and having to wait for almost half an hour wasn't giving me a good impression to want to eat at this place. The dinning area was full I understand and there were two of the servers walking around. 

After just waving one of them down we ordered our food. I ordered their ""Tori Katsu & Ebi Fry"" and my fiancè got the ""Rosu Katsu Curry."" Looking at the menu your food comes with white rice, miso soup, and a type of pickled veggie on the side. They set it up on a serving platter for each plate and they do have good presentation. My friends ordered the Rosu Katsu as well and had some sides with it. There's a Yelp check-in where you obtain a free Potato salad. All four of us were yelpers and found this place from Yelp (of course), and when we wanted to redeem each check-in for ourselves our guy server said we could only use one. I understand there's a limitation BUT do not offer a check-in incentive to people if it'll be one per table, keep in mind that your business attracts a lot of yelpers so I hope they accommodate in the future! It was our first time here and we chose this business because Yelp suggested you so it would have been great to experience an individual bowl of potato salad. We split that bowl between us 4, literally one bite. It was good and I wish we individually got to experience our own bowls so we could all equally enjoy the food. 

Anyways, that issue aside we waited for another 20 minutes for our food. I don't know what was going on? Short staff or lack of urgency? Because our guy server wasn't up to par with us, barely served us and we sat at the front but the lady server was hustling. She ended up checking up on us more than he did (thank you!) Katsu was delicious, this place did turn me into a katsu lover to be honest. Their miso soup was just as good and perfect to start or end your meal. During our dining experience there was also flies flying around. It was an annoyance, couldn't enjoy my katsu without tryna slap the air. Lol towards the ending the lady server served us more than our original server and she was such a sweetheart! We came in around 7:30pm and left a little before closing so that's an idea as to how long it took for us to wait for our original server to get or drinks/ orders, to deliver our food, and give us the bill. I could have came on an off day but the lady server was busting her butt ensuring we left satisfied so there should never be an excuse as to why the first server's customer service/ urgency wasn't good. 

For the two plates my fiancè and I ordered cost about $33 with tax. It's bittersweet. The food is delicious and our second lady server was awesome. However, it just bothers me how they have the check-in offer and limits it to one table, their wait time is pretty long, and their other server wasn't up to par.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,1,1,3,V35lmEIriX9umm8ur11-Ug

If you get the side of Japanese mustard in your meal, which you can add to the katsu sauce, I have to warn you,  put too much and the katsu sauce is too hot. Kind of like wasabi.

It appears to be owned and operated by a family and they really show it with their politeness and smiles when you enter in and as you dine in. The kind of service they provide couldn't be any better. They have about 6 tables (can sit 4 each) and a bar top at the end of the restaurant that is right next to the kitchen.

At the table, there are empty bowls provided along with a sesame grinder so that you can grind some sesame seeds and pour some katsu sauce in after. It's almost a tradition for me to do that while I wait for my food to arrive! Depending on what you order will determine if you would need it. Even if what I order already has sauce (like the curry) I still grind some sesame seeds and use some katsu sauce on some occasional bites! 

My favorite dishes:

-Tori Katsu Dinner (Chicken Katsu Cutlet) which include: Chicken katsu laid on a raised metal grate so that it doesn't get soggy, some finely shredded cabbage on the side, along with rice, and a side of miso soup.

-Chicken Katsu Curry which includes: Chicken Katsu laid above a serving of curry that has potatos and carrots, and rice.

Food: While there may be many restaurants in Las Vegas which focus on katsu curry I feel like it is a breath of fresh air to have a restaurant that focuses on tonkatsu.

Panko-breaded and deep-fried chicken, comes with rice and miso soup only. This is not on the menu but you can definitely ask for chicken instead of pork. The katsu itself was great but the curry is better at Zen. 4/5

Hire Katsu and Shrimp Katsu:
Panko-breaded and deep-fried pork tenderloin katsu and shrimps. 

Tori Katsu Dinner:
Panko-breaded and deep-fried chicken. 5/5

Salmon Fry Katsu Dinner:
Usually, when you deep-fry salmon, it gets pretty dry and flaky (kind of like dandruff). But here at Kiyoshi, they know how to do it right. 5/5

Pineapple Panna Cotta:
This was so good and had the perfect pineapple flavor to it. I'm tired of plain old panna cotta and creme brûlée. This has whipped cream and coconut shavings on top...like a pina colada panna cotta. 4/5 

Green tea Cheesecake:
I've had green tea cheesecake that have been pure fail where you can hardly taste green tea. THIS is how green tea cheesecake was meant to taste like. 5/5

The service has always been great. Friendly and very attentive. The food comes out within 10-15 minutes after ordering.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,4,3,4,WC87m3Silz9Wr3m31oOzGA

The only thing i can critic was the size, the port cutlet curry set came with two teeny tiny bite size cutlets!  Really?  Someone was still hungry!  The Jap curry tasted ok, tasted like one of those store bought curry block.

It was fun to grind your sesame seed and mix with the katsu sauce, the katsu sauce was pretty sweet, i tried not to add too much into it, but if i didnt, the sesame katsu sauce would look like paste... hmm.... maybe i did it wrong?? 

The complimentary potato salad was delicious, thanks to Yelp check in special.  We also had the octopus salad, that was a meh, too much citrus not much flavor.   

The green tea cheese cake was ok, not much of mucha flavor, just cheesecake...

5361317,2014-03-26,1,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"**Summary**
       - Meals - The meals come with rice, miso soup, cabbage, & pickled pearl onions. The rice & cabbage are unlimited. You just have to ask them for more.
       - Preference - I prefer either the Hire (3 pieces of pork) or Tori (chicken) Katsu. The Hire for when I'm hungry & the Tori for when I'm not as hungry. I like my katsu crust crisp and these two dishes provide that.
       - Picked pearl onions - A pallet cleanser. Never had it anywhere else, but it was pretty good. It's like a mild onion soaked in sweetness.
       - Sauce - At the table there are two containers. Sesame seeds & katsu sauce. They give you a mortar & pestle. Traditionally, you'll take the sesame seeds, crush them with the pestle, and pour the katsu sauce over it and mix. Very authentic.
       - Cabbage - The shredded cabbage is given with a Japanese vinaigrette on the side. I usually like ordering a side of Curry so I can pour that over the cabbage and eat it with that. I don't like the sour taste of the dressing as much.
**Ordered**
       - $12 Hire Katsu Dinner - 3 Pieces of pork katsu. Perfectly breaded. Crispy & delicious. A hungry man's meal.
       - $10 Rosu Katsu Dinner - 1 Larger piece of pork katsu that's a bit bigger and oilier.  The oils also make the bottom of the katsu a bit soggy. I preferred the Hire.
       - $8 Tori Katsu Dinner - Chicken katsu. Pretty good for a pork alternative.
       - $15 Hire Katsu & Shrimp Katsu Dinner - 2 pieces of pork katsu and 2 huge breaded tiger prawns. 
       - $12 Katsu Donburi - Caramelized onions & egg on top of pork katsu. The egg & onions makes the breaded katsu crust soggy. I think this defeats the purpose of katsu. The added flavor is not worth this trade-off.
       - $12 Katsu Curry - The curry makes the katsu crust soggy. I don't really like that.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice local Katsu place. They only serve Katsu, but they serve it well!",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,2,1,5,O7eaPHvWSpu6wN8vBvO-8Q

You're immediately greeted when you walk in and they promptly seat you. We came at a perfect time (~8pm) because it wasn't busy at all. It took us a while to figure out what we wanted so our server was very patient and got our drinks. He was very enthusiastic -- which is hard to find in some servers nowadays. He made sure he was available for us when we did decide what we wanted.

*Check in on Yelp to get free potato salad OR seaweed salad (**one per table though!). I'm still iffy about any kind of potato salad and it threw me off what there were little pieces of apples in this potato salad. It was still good, though. 

Once you get your food, the server shows it how to make your own mixture of katsu sauce. There are two bowls -- one with katsu sauce, one with sesame seeds. You put the sesame seeds in another bowl and grind it, then add katsu sauce! I love sesame seeds so I grind a lot for me. 

I ordered the ebi (shrimp) katsu curry. Yum, yum! The portions were good sized: half the plate was rice, the other half was curry (with potatoes and carrots) & two jumbo shrimps (I wish I got one more shrimp for it being $15). The plate also came wth salad and miso soup on the side, so I guess that made up for the price. 

I love this place and the food is amazing, but I'd probably only come when I've saved enough money to spend $15 on a plate.",7mjpX2eYbcCt1pcNnN3Hrw,5,2,5,EiEhUHijP5OzpClGcAMjKA

Being the only specialty katsu I know of in the valley, it definitely does not disappoint. One bite of their katsu and you can immediately tell the difference in terms of theirs, and any other katsu meal you can find in a Japanese themed restaurant.

My go to meal is the classic Chicken Katsu. I sincerely believe that the get the krispiness spot on, as well as the texture of the chicken. I love how it's such a big meal too, as it definitely makes you feel like you've spent your money's worth. Every meal comes with appetizers such as miso soup, cabbage or salad depending on your meal, and a side of rice. I also recommend their donburi. It's one of the better ones I've had in the city.

One of the things that makes this place so great is the authenticity of your experience. One step into this place, and you can immediately tell its Japanese. A lot of people may say that this place is small and cramped, but if you have ever been to Japan, all the shops there give exactly this small, cozy and whole in the wall kind of vibe.

If someone opens up a tonkatsu restaurant in Japan, the owner is convinced that their tonkatsu is fucking awesome and the best around.  While there's certainly no market for upscale $30+ tonkatsu meals on the corner of Jones and Robindale, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi does a decent job of breading, frying and serving meat.  They're definitely the best around...since they're the only place around!!

My wife got the hire (pork) katsu dinner which was better than the ebi (shrimp) katsu.  The shrimp was quite large which was a plus.  I went with the ebi just to have a variety but I should have just gotten the other pork option (Rosu).  After all, there's a pig on the freakin sign so that should give you some hints on what to order.  The meal comes with miso soup, rice and a little onion.  

After you grind the sesame seeds, transfer the amount you'd like into the black dish with the sauce, don't put the sauce directly into the grinding bowl.  That's the wrong way to do it and you limit the size of the piece you dip by using the small bowl.  I noticed several people doing this while we were there.    

The quality of their pork is better than Japanese Curry Zen and they give a substantial amount more.  I plan on trying the katsu curry next time for sure and I'll be ready to bump it up a star or two if the curry is great.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,28,11,3,3wDsxejWiu38HMQLlKZAzQ

Breaded fried pork cutlet sounds delicious to begin with, but I was not prepared for how well Tonkatsu Kiyoshi executed on the dish and at such value! You get two big pork cutlets with a standard order. They are fork-tender and served on a little rack to prevent sogginess and ensure maximum crispiness! They also offer a combo plate for a couple bucks more which comes with 2 cutlets plus 2 giant crispy, tender shrimp. And did I mention that every main course comes with miso soup and white rice as well? I really enjoyed the tonkatsu & japanese curry, which adds a nice mild spice to the dish.

A unique part of the meal is the grind-you-own sesame seeds for the ""bbq"" sauce. The sesame seeds mellow out the flavor of the sauce, which starts out a bit tangy like A1 + BBQ Sauce + Worcestershire Sauce. As you customize the flavor to your liking, it's fun to have different people at the table all tweak their sauces differently then share and compare.

On a final note, they have a nice selection of appetizers in the $3-6 range and authentic Japanese tea (Asahi beer coming soon!). 2 people, 2 apps, 2 drinks, the 2 biggest entrees, and 2 full & happy customers came to $40.

Be forewarned, this is a SMALL restaurant... I'm talking about six tables.  Usually this would deter me a bit, but somehow, it worked toward the charm of this place.  It is comfy and cozy, and the Hawaiian music playing in the background made me very nostalgic as I longed for another trip back.

Now onto the food.  I ordered the salmon and shrimp.  It was amazing!!!  Everything was super fresh, the miso soup was perfect, and it's so fun to get to make your own sauce!  The breading on the salmon and pork is seriously outstanding.  Not greasy at all... Nice and light, and crisp.  I later found out that this is due in part to the owner's sourcing of fresh panko... Not the hard, dry kind we buy at the grocery store.

And please, if you like potato salad even a bit, order it here!!!  It's the owner's grandmother's recipe, and it's so unique and delicious.  Potato salad with chunks of apples and slices of cucumber?  Somehow, it totally works!

Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is a small-sized restaurant that offers tasty Tonkatsu at a reasonable-ish price. The portion size is quite filling and food quality is superior. I was surprised at how homey I felt during my experience at Tonkatsu Kiyoshi-- both the ambiance and service played a role in that. 

Pros:  Attention to detail to service, restaurant, dishes, presentation; quality food; great taste. 

Cons:  Menu options (maybe adding a Chef Special item would bring diversity to customers); adding history to the brand (how Tonkatsu Kiyoshi started) would definetley benefit the already homey feel to the restaurant;  more engaging service.

I called in a phone order and the girl who answered the phone was extremely rude. She made me feel like I was bothering her. After taking my order, she did not thank me or even say good bye. She simply hung up on me. I was so upset that I ended up not picking up my order. Foolishly I thought maybe she was having a bad day, and decided to give this place another chance. We went for dinner while they were full and waited a few minutes for a table to open up. Once a table left, we started to walk towards it and the same waitress (I recognized her voice) yelled ""Can you wait so I can clear the table"" from across the restaurant (while rolling her eyes). We weren't planning on sitting, we just wanted to stand next to it in case another party walked in. And even if we were about to sit, you should NEVER yell at your customers, let alone from across the room. I believe this is a small family-runned restaurant and maybe she's just there because of her family, but she should probably be working in the kitchen instead of with customers. She obviously doesn't know anything about customer service or perhaps just doesn't care. She seemed irritable as I observed her dealing with other tables as weIl. I find it disappointing that the owner is ok with her treating customers so poorly. He obviously does not care about his restaurant or surviving in this competitive town, which is sad because I love supporting small businesses.

Real Japanese food! 

This is not your  L&L fast food katsu or island style (sorry not bagging on my 808 people) that comes to mind when most people think of katsu. This is katsu straight from the motherland. The mark of a legit Japanese katsu-ya: suribachi and surikogi for grinding fresh sesame for katsu sauce at the table. Once I saw this, I knew we found a legit motherland katsu spot. 
Unlike most katsu-ya in Japan the cabbage salad is not unlimited (which is fine) and karashi (spicy mustard) is not served by default. I recommend that you ask for a bit of karashi for you katsu. 

Here is the breakdown of the eats:

Karaage: legit Japanese!
Rosu Katsu: legit Japanese!
Curry: Homestyle legit Japanese!

I don't know how to explain it any better. If you want REAL Japanese katsu, come here!

For those of you who are hesitant on giving this place a try, think of it this way; when you want a quick burger you go to McDonalds, when you want a good quality burger you go to _______________ (insert favorite burger boutique name here). This is the same thought process you should use when debating over katsu. If you want quick food; go to L&L. If you want a good quality katsu; go to Tonkatsu kiyoshi.

 It's really that simple.

5918757,2013-10-24,5,eR7Iw_X54m3YLWkXp9y35Q,"Tonkatsu is a Japanese comfort food commonly prepared at home.  In its simplest preparation, a piece of pork loin is tenderized and the flattened pork is breaded and deep fried until cooked.  It is traditionally served with a tonkatsu sauce, but it is jut as common served with Japanese curry and rice.  However you eat it, a good tonkatsu meal will fill your belly and bring a smile to your face.

At Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, the same Japanese tonkatsu is wonderfully prepared and served here.  And like many of the specialty tonkatsu restaurants in Japan and much of Asia, they offer a variety of different preparations (although the selections overseas is significantly greater than what is available here).

The tonkatsu I have tried thus far have all been fried perfectly, where the pork is still cooked but nice, tender and juicy inside.  It is so flavorful that you don't even really need the tonkatsu sauce (you can customize it by grinding toasted sesame seeds and mix it in with their pre-made tonkatsu sauce).  The portions are good for the price.

On my first visit, i tried their Tonkatsu Donburi. Which is just tonkatsu served over rice in the style of a traditional Oyako Donburi (Mother Daughter Rice Bowl or something like that, because they kinkily served the chicken with the egg. Get it ;P).  It was very good!

One of the things I wish is available is the choice of breading for the tonkatsu.  In Japan and in Taiwan, where I ave visited everything from high end premium tonkatsu restaurants to very good fast food tonkatsu chains, they all have more options than what is available as is on the menu.  It is not a huge thing, but sometimes a little more choices make the customer just that much happier.

The miso soup was excellent too, even though that is never the reason for me to ever go to any restaurant.

For what is available in the area, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is unquestionably the best. (Voicing the same sentiment as Philip T in case it is less obvious in this paraphrasing).

The batter was light and crispy, and I like how it wasn't greasy. Since I've been craving a lot of curry lately, I ordered the Katsu Curry. I wasn't expecting the curry to be awesome since this is not a curry house, but it was still pretty good. The Pork Katsu was cooked well and easy to eat. The curry wasn't too thick or too watery and it had a good flavor. I also liked how it only had potatoes and carrots, would have been disappointed if they had like big pieces of onions in it! For dessert, we had the Green Tea Cheesecake which is not recommended! It was tiny, bland and it didn't taste anything like Green Tea!!

I am not big on cabbage that gets served with it, so they actually let me customize my order and exchange for more rice instead! Customer service is good, i think its because the owner tries to make it a point to always greet their customers coming and going, only one comment though, the single server that is working the shift kind of moves too slow and fails to acknowledge you if you need anything else, but hey that was only one time. Also the only thing that irks me a little is that they open your can of soda and pour it in a glass for you, which is just not my preference, but hey i wont let that spoil my party!

I literally stumbled into this place by accident. We were actually looking for an Italian restaurant, and close by was more of a pizza place, not so much pasta. 

Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is definitely a hidden gem. It is next to the Euphoria Wellness dispensary. It is a small family owned restaurant. They have bar style seating along with normal restaurant seating. They have a specials board and a normal menu. Their menu ranges from $5-$18. 

They literally have the best katsu in Las Vegas that I've tried so far. Depending on how I am feeling I either get the Chicken katsu or one of the tonkatsu. It's a hefty serving! It comes with rice and salad. The salad is just shredded cabbage but whatever the dressing is made out of is the best! It pairs well with the katsu! You also get a side of miso soup and a little pickled shallots. Everything is so good. You also get to make your sauce with the tonkatsu sauce and crushed sesame seeds. 

The tonkatsu donburi is my second favorite. When I order food to go or for pick up, I always get the donburi mostly because if I ordered the normal katsu, it might get soggy. The Donburi is really good! It also comes with the miso soup. Make sure you try it out!

Let a lone restaurants who were doing specific Items really well. Tonkatsu (pork cutlet, Panko breaking and deep friend served with a dipping sauce) is one of my favorite japanese comfort foods and a dish that my mother does very well. 

The owner/chef goes to the market every morning to pick up ingredients for the day. No frozen meat or left overs from the day before. This shows in the quality of the pork and the freshness of the greens. The tonkatsu is cooked perfectly and the pork is tender, not chewy like you may find at some hawaiian plate lunch places or lesser quality japanese restaurants. For the sauce, they recommend grinding up sesame seeds at ur table and mixing it with the sauce. I've never had it this way before and I'm now a huge fan. For their salad dressing they made an in house ume boshi and ponzu sauce. Two of my favorite flavors. When ever I'm in the area I make sure to stop in or take out.
