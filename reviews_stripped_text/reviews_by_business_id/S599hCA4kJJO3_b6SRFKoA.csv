This time I ordered the chipotle lengua (cow tongue), I know it sounds nasty but hey it taste good. The lengua came with rice and bean's, guacamole. The rice was good, bean's not a bean fan so didn't get it, guacamole was good. For dessert I ordered churros, came with 4 small churros and whipped cream. When I first came here I ordered the steak rancheros, I would recommend trying it. 

I would totally recommend this place to my friends and family and fellow yelpers. The service is great, food is great, and the place itself is nice and clean.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,1,4,VFRbCBXkaxpcRSQQKLYQvw

I live in California and was able to reserve their patio area for my 40 guests, they put the King robe, crown and scepter on my father-in-law (which I provided), walked him through the restaurant where we all waited for him to walk into the patio area on his red carpet (I provided) to yell ""surprise"". They allowed me to come an hour and a half early so that I could decorate the patio with my own decorations and even provided me with 2-extra 6 ft. tables to put my collage pictures, cake, and presents on. They even enclosed the patio and set-up portable heaters to keep us warm; due to the cold weather. 
 
The accommodations were amazing!  I was able to choose different options from their menu for our guests to choose from and they made me personalized menus for my guests which kept the cost low to fit my budget. We had chips, salsa, guacamole and nachos as our appetizers and our guests had the choice of: Fajitas for 2, 3 Tacos plate (Carne Asada, Pollo Asado, or Carnitas), Burritos, along with a kids menu and much more. Once our servers took   everyone's individual orders, our food was out hot, fresh and Delicious within 30 minutes. We had family and friends fly in from: California, Arizona, Oklahoma and Colorado and every single one of my guests complemented on the food and service they were provided. They even cut the cake we brought and served it to each of our guests and made sure my father-in-law was served first!! 

I have my own Mexican food catering service in California (Baja Style Tacos Catering Service) and I have very high standard and I have to say, I was very impressed with everything they did for me, their food was great and I highly recommend Michoacan!  

I can't thank you all enough for taking so much stress off of me while I was trying to put this birthday party together for my father-in-law from California and made it a special day we will all never forget. 

Thank you,

141469,2013-05-21,3,S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA,"gour*met (grme, gr me) 

n.  1. a connoisseur of fine food and drink; epicure.
adj. 2. of, characteristic of, or designed for gourmets.
3. of or involving fancy or exotic foods.

They should remove the word ""gourmet"" from the restaurant sign. 

The chips were pretty good. The service was lacklustre and ambivalent (would it kill you to smile, mr waiter?). The lighting was too bright. The chile relleno was soggy and swimming in tomato saucey water (whuuuut?). The burrito was huge but also swimming next to the relleno and a bit soggy (I felt guilty for having had an animal live and die just to go into that). 

I don't know what the high reviewers see in this place...maybe other reviewers have assessed it rightly that they just don't know good quality food. Maybe the giant portion sizes impress them; for me, it's just more bad food. I actually prefer Taco Bell to this overpriced underwhelming ""gourmet"" restaurant. I was craving Leticia's but they were closed. Next time I'll just wait. This place has Leticia's prices but not even fast food quality.

Also the atmosphere is awesome with live marriachi/rancheras music! The service is also top notch, and the waiters are very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu!

We have recently discovered their brunch buffet and I'm now amiss that we hadn't been going for years prior. Most of their best menu options are available but the best thing is the pan dulce. I don't know if they make it in house or have it brought in but the conchas are to die for.

It's not like there are tons of screaming kids and is dark so can be a nice little date place but oerfect for family dinner too. They cater too for events! Btw if you wait outside ,just let the host know so they don't skip you when you're called. They get busy because it's good! LIndo resturaunts have been a well known family owned resturaunt name in town for years. This location is smaller but great service. Their pick up service is super fast and always right and good. Even the sides and extras. My fam has eaten at the original for years (before the original fire even in the 90's) I can remember being a kid watching them make handmade tortillas. All the locations are good but my favs have to be the original location and this centennial location. FYI it's next to Red Robin (it can be hard to see from street but has same parking location). Cute dark place and covered seating outside avail w/ heated lamps in the winter if needed on patio area. Has a great little bar inside too.  Staff is very nice. This place has lots of regulars.

One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to.  It was as high end as it gets for a Mexican restaurant without being stupid.  The handmade tortillas (which you see being produced in the window) are to die for.  The service was very helpful.  My go-to, enchiladas, were fantastic.  Take it from this Southern California Latino, Michoacan is a must-do.  If Michoacan want to come to Long Beach, I'd be happy to help!",bZd4DoNXFsHvY1kdKp3zvw,3,1,5,zVyl83Gengod2fnKVvx6jQ

The plan was to go to Olive Garden but the wait was an hour so my husband and I decided to give Michoacan a shot.  We walked in and there was a small empty table right by the server station. The hostess told me it was going to take 30 minutes to an hour with only a large group waiting.  When I looked at the table than looked at the hostess she corrected herself than immediately sat us. We thought we got lucky until I realized she told everyone it was a hour wait but could be 5 minutes then everyone including a table of 11 was quickly seated.  I noticed on both the food and drink menus that there are extra charges for almost everything.  I got flautas and had to pay extra for flour tortillas and any flavor additions to the margaritas cost more and all thru the menu its $1for this or $ 2 for that.  I thought it was a little tacky.   My husband got a shrimp burrito and said it was rubbery.  The flautas were just Ok.  The guacamole was good. My husband actually ate it which is rare for him.

I ordered a 12oz chicken breast with cognac sauce and  my husband ordered the orange roughy.   My chicken was sooooo over cooked I couldn't even cut it. Beans were dried out and crusted over.  Rice was crunchy. So either they had it done and kept it under the light so it over cooked or the chef really doesn't know when to take food off the grill.  The fish was filled with bones.  I actually left the bones in the bill holder to show them.  I have eaten there before many times and it has never been amazing but it was fine.  Last night was terrible it has made it so I will not go back. The owner knew and something was up.  He kept coming around apologizing to people.

The good: it was a weekday afternoon so it wasn't too busy. The hostess is always friendly as was our waiter this time. Fresh chips, warm bean dip and tortillas being made just a few feet away.

The bad: ordered a chicken enchilada but was served beef. When I brought it to the waiter's attention, he informed me I could find chicken in the other half of the enchilada and then walked away. Really? 

The ugly: the sopa tarasca was extra oily. So much so, I could only take a few bites. We asked for the check three times and every time was told ""oh my god I'm so sorry"". 45 minutes later we got our check after our party of four stood up to walk out because we couldn't wait for it anymore.

As before, the first time we were there, the food itself barely made mediocre.  Mexican cusine is one of my absolute favorites and this one repeatedly falls short.  There is no life in their plates.

I had tried this place years ago when we had a Vegan Eatz/V Animal Sanctuary dinner and.......I was not impressed.

Hubs and I were craving refried beans, some table side guac...the works.

The table side guac was yummy, I kinda wish I would have asked for more cilantro and some jalapeños (we were afraid it would be too spicy. But know we know. 
Just speak up and ask for it exactly the way you want it.

Hubs got the vegan burritos they had grilled and sautéed veggies, beans with optional red sauce on top. It came with a side of refried beans. I tried it and it was very yum.

I wanted to FINALLY try a tamale. I'm not sure if I have really ever eaten a tamale? I'm not a fan of ground mushy maize. (It tastes like a wet dog smells to me for some reason.) 
Well, this didn't. And it was vegan. It was full of mushrooms and garlic. You can choose either red or green sauce to go on top. It was yum. And big! One was filling to me. I got a side ""salad"" of tomatoes lettuce and onion with cilantro vinaigrette and it was too much food for me.

1438611,2015-01-02,0,S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA,"Food:  Below average.  I tried the rib eye steak, lacked seasoning. My wife had the milanesa, it was crispy and slightly above average.  The fresh guacamole was also just average, not great.  The fried icecream was terrible. Nothing like stale soggy cornflakes to ruin good ice cream.

Service: Terrible. After sitting unattend for the first 6 minutes a server brought us chips, salsa, and their bean dip; he left before we could ask for drinks. Five minutes later someone came and took our drink order. About 20 minute in we got our drinks and ordered. They brought my steak without a steak knife and forgot my tortillas, but I didn't notice till the waiter stepped away. Since they were no were to be seen, I mushed through it with a butter knife.  Later in the meal they did refill our waters a few times.  As we were finishing up, they were very quick to clear away our plates.


Overall, the food is far from special.  The service was slow and unattentive. I would not recommend this place to a friend and I would never return.",C1pbgjAruOJSPt2FU5hbXA,3,1,2,6NlBD1UayElyhJJAWyHXyA

We came here in the past on several occasions for their Sunday Brunch and endless margaritas, and mimosas for the great price of $12.95.   However, we recently found out that their special brunch was only going to be served once a month from now on. So we made it a point to not miss this month.  I was  initially bummed that they would only have their brunch once a month but after today's experience, I'm okay if they have it once a year or never.  I mean if you are going to have a once a month brunch, make it count.

The selections were far less than I remembered, and I think they thought they could make up for it by adding 2 seafood dishes, but the seafood was completely overcooked and all the other dishes just seemed to lack flavor and authenticity.  The only dish that was decent enough for me today was their Carnitas a la Coca-Cola and for this dish alone I didn't leave hungry.

I know I always say that I won't torture myself with another makeshift Mexican Restaurant, but seriously, this place was pretty decent some time ago and I actually was looking forward to coming back here again... so disappointed and just glad we did not drag anyone else along for this experience.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,5,2,2,556oPR8yQ7X-YZU8OGHXiQ

With that being said, I wish I could say the same for the food and comfort. I'm not sure why there are sooo many great reviews on the food here. Maybe I am spoiled from being raised in a Hispanic family and having authentic food? but then again, they are supposed to have ""authentic"" food. My 5 yr old wanted a chicken taco. She loves chicken. I saw her taking the chicken out, and I asked her what was wrong? she said she does not like it. Seeing that this little girl is a meat lover, we found that odd, so my wife tried the chicken and spit it out. She even showed me how it looked. It looked old and like it was microwaved. It was terrible and tasted like poultry without seasoning. My wife and I had the Carne Asada Torta, it was edible but it was nothing to make us return. The steak could have had more flavor The fideo soup had NO flavor at all. None of us finished it. The bean dip was just okay. The rice, I will admit was good. It was the best thing we had there.  Seating is very uncomfortable for a family of 5. They sat is in an area next to the door. There was a wall but it had a decorative window opening in which all the cold air kept coming in, every time the door was opened it did not close because it would get stuck.

The tacos were accompanied by the usual Spanish rice and retried beans. Good sides but they can't stand up to the rest of the food that we ate.

Im pretty tolerant of different interpretations of it and all that being said this place has bad food.   Heres the thing though it wasn't so much that it wasn't very flavorful (it really was sorta bland) it was the the 4 tablespoons of water on the plate that sogged the taco to where it fell apart when picked up.  It wasn't the coalgluted cheeses on the the chicken enchilada in tomatillo sauce not being melted enough and just pooled on the side of the enchilada like white cement, or the fact the whole plate seemed to have been tossed together in like 3 minutes put under a broiler (not even long enough to melt the cheese).  And then brought out for me to try and eat.  It came with a chile reano that was actually pretty good but the rancho sauce or salsa it was served with was broken.  maybe thats where all the extra water on the plate came from.

Olives and lima beans in the rice?   I know every places rice is different, however this was also dry and crisp indicating it was old and had been sitting out.  The beans were ok.  Service was great and i felt bad telling the waiter i was unhappy when he asked.  I showed him how the water pooled up on the plate (again where did all this water on the plate come from?) and that the shredded beef taco was chicken and a soggy mess with no crispness at all from sitting in the plate water.   it was awful, so soggy I couldn't even pick it up before it exploded on the plate.

Disappointed. As the wife and I had wanted to eat here a long time.  Don't understand how this place has gotten anything in the way of good reviews.  maybe it was an off night.  but the kitchen should have never let that plate go out like that.  that they did indicates to me no one at the pass and it must be the status quo.

Salad with various dressings
Taquitos
Beef fajitas
Chile Verde
Ceviche
Guacamole
Pozole or menudo (can't remember which)
Fruit
Sweet bread
Whipped cream
Bacon
Potato hash
And a few other items

First nothing was fresh and second nothing was hot. Most things were warm-ish like the taquitos. Who wants a cold taquito? The beef fajitas were swimming in oil..The Chile Verde was decent it wasnt hot but it was warm enough to at least taste ok. I mostly filled up on the chips and salsa they bring to your table when u first sit down. They come with a mild salsa and bean dip which is pretty tasty and I got a big bowl of guacamole from the buffet to dip the chips into as well. I also had some Mexican sweet bread with some whip cream and it was probably the best thing I ate. I did order a mimosa which was standard nothing special buy it was nice that it was included.

The only other thing to mention was the little glass room right in the middle of the restaurant thats attached to the kitchen....an older lady was in there making homemade tortillas and it was pretty cool to watch.

Lindo was already hoppin' at 6:30, but we seemed to beat the crowd and only had a 10 minute wait for a table.  We were seated at a table in the bar area - between the bar stools and the massive booths they have.  (To be honest the booths look plush and wonderful, but are so large they seem out of scale with this rather small restaurant).

The service was warm and attentive throughout.  Complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip? Check.  All were good - the salsa even a bit hotter than what I expected, which made for an auspicious start!  House margaritas on the rocks with salt made with sweet and sour and Sauza were bright, tangy and not overly sweet - yummy.

Wow - their menu is extensive with all kinds of innovative, tasty sounding dishes like Fillet Relleno -  fish fillet stuffed with seafood and then breaded and fried.  I opted for the Enchiladas de Camaron - gulf shrimp in tortillas with red enchilada sauce.  The combination includes fideo soup - although it's just a simple tomato based soup with vermicelli noodles, I'm a big fan of any restaurant that serves it.  Love me some fideo and this one was good.

The entrees arrived and, after such an exciting stellar start, I was surprised they were a little...well...meh.  The shrimp were cooked nicely inside my enchiladas, but the sauce was kind of tasteless.  Rice and beans were fine, pretty much what you would expect to find in any mexican restaurant.  My whole entree was kind of a plate of bland.

That said, I definitely want to go back - I haven't lost faith, maybe I just didn't make the right choice off of their massive menu.  Mole anyone?",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,1,0,3,0g-eLipCn4sKwcV5ufPRPw

I had to ask for the soup because they didn't even bring it to us. So I ask the waiter about where our food was.. He said their thermal printer ran out of paper so they put a new roll in and our food will be out in 5 mins. We couldn't wait any longer because our friend had to go to work. My question is that if the printer was out of paper then why did everyone around us that got there after Us got their food? 
If the waiter would've just kept up and realized we haven't gotten our food in 20-30 mins he should've known something was wrong. The problem is, they messed up.. And now they will lose a good customer. Like I said, my husband and I eat there at least once a week. Looks like we will be taking our business elsewhere .

Lindo Michoacan is no different.  I agree with most of the posts.  The salsa is plain and way too much tomato sauce and no tomatoes, onions or cilantro.  The beans served with the salsa was as you would expect.

The best part was our shrimp dish.  The shrimp tasted like- SHRIMP.  We found that amazing.  Our server was great.  The house margaritas seemed watered down and we had a pitchers worth of them.

This is probably more a personal thing but I found a spelling error in the dessert menu, they used the word CARMEL meaning CARAMEL.  I pointed it out to our server and then tried to reach the overall manager for the chain, Gerardo at the number listed on the website.  He was too busy to take my call so I wrote to them via the supplied email address.  Three days later no email or call.  This indicates a real lack of concern and a lack of customer service that I expect where ever I eat. I would think they would be very appreciative of someone who spotted this mistake so they could correct it.  Now that I see how they ignored me, I am doubting they care or will ever correct it.

Due to a prior commitment, I arrived late (and several rounds of Margaritas) into the meal. Somehow I missed that it was a buffet: but I was so happy to be there, phobias did not take over. 

Seated next to the lovely Sylvia Q, I quickly grabbed Shrimp Ceviche, Huevos, beans & rice, a homemade tortilla and a bowl of guacamole with fixins and a spoon. I do not kid when saying eating guac with a spoon is normal for me. Our super amazing waiter Kyle kept the drinks flowing: I tried a frozen Mango Margarita, and a sip of Sylvia's Midori but he gladly switched it out for one on the rocks. Our table looked like a Margarita rainbow! The food offerings included menudo and lots of carnivore food that I don't eat, but it looked good. Safe to say pescetarians & vegetarians who eat eggs can leave sated. I'm not a chips and salsa person, but they, too were plentiful. 

This was a bargain at $13.95 per person AYCE & AYCD including ALL margarita varities and mimosas. The service was on point even though the back room we were in was shared with a second large party. Water glasses were replenished; they even had a mini mariachi group complete with sombrereo, churros, candles and a large tequilla shot because Kyle overheard it was Jieun's birthday. Now THAT'S lovely. Not too far at all from Summahood to take advantage of good food, atmosphere and service for Sunday brunch (the menu changes weekly)

Many thanks to the always incredible Jade W for hosting and inviting us all to an epic game afternoon at her home later. Great times made better by even greater company.

These guys are locally owned and operated so be sure to go out and support them.

Sunday they do a brunch with 30 plus items that always look delicious.  I will have to try that one day soon.

I got the vegetarian enchiladas which came with the entree, tortilla chips, beans and rice, little corn flour tortilas, fideo soup, and what was either a spicy sauce or salsa (not too experienced with Mexican food, so I couldn't tell if they forgot to give me salsa or if that was it).  

The fideo soup was really good, kind of like a Mexican version of ramen noodles (I mean the real Asian kind, not the stuff college students eat).  I thought the amount of food was good for the price I paid.  I filled up so much on the rice and bean tortillas that I didn't finish the entree in one sitting. 

The only complaint I have was the veggies in the veggie enchilada could have been more diverse.  It was mostly carrots and squash.  I would have liked to see some more cheese in it also.

The second time we went was for dinner, and it was busy! The food was still great, but not as perfect as the first time. Everyones dinner was a bit off. Meat cooked a tiny bit too long, some things hot, others only warm. And the $14 drinks was a bit of a shocker! Over all we had a great time.

After 10 more minutes the server finally came and took our order. Fajitas for two and kids chicken fingers for our son, and drink orders finally placed as well. 10 minutes later, the dinner salad came out, but still no drinks. We finally received our drinks several minutes later. Service at this location was awful to say the least. 

The server NEVER returned to check on us, refill drinks or anything else. It was as poor service as I have ever experienced. We waited nearly 20 more minutes after we were done with the meal in order to get the check. We asked the busser for to-go boxes, in which she brought one back and literally threw it on the table into the leftovers. That was the final straw. We asked for the manager. When all was explained to him, the manager seemed much less than interested in the issues. He offered no apologies, only dessert.  We asked for the check, and still we waited.

My girlfriend got the combo that came with a chicken enchilada, beef taco, and a tostada, which were all pretty average, except for the enchilada which wasn't that good because the chicken was slightly lukewarm and the flavor was lacking. However, the true masterpiece of this place, is their tortillas. So soft and warm. They are the best tortillas I've ever had in my life! But I can't rate this place on the tortillas alone.

My wife ordered the Novillo Al Conac which was steak with a reduced mushroom sauce, Mexican rice, beans and tortilla.  She loved it!

For an appetizer we had some awesome Ceviche Camaron.  Not too wet, not to dry, plenty of shrimp and very tasty.

For dessert, we got the Lindo Flameado (fried ice cream surrounded by banana slices).  They set it on fire right in front of us. It smelled good and tasted even better!

3266458,2017-08-11,0,S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA,Pretty good food but definitely not the best Mexican food in the area. The fajitas we got were over priced for what they were and we've been to many other places where you get more flavorful fajitas for a smaller price. Also this place doesn't have any queso cheese dip which I think is strange.

I had the skirt steak, my wife had the porterhouse covered in salsa verde. 
Both were very good, although the porterhouse was overcooked a bit. My advice is to always order your steaks one level underdone when not in a real steakhouse. 

The service was very friendly, attentive, and courteous throughout. 

The food is good, but not REALLY GOOD. And certainly not great. I'm Hispanic, it's not that difficult to make tasty rice or beans, but Vegas strikes out once again.

3496391,2013-03-20,0,S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA,"I have been dining at this location weekly since November 2012. We went in one saturday night for dinner and were hooked on the atmosphere, the food, and the live mariachi band!

We go almost every week now and at the time of this review I seem to be ""The Duke"" of this location here on YELP because I check in every time we dine.

This place is really worth it all around. It is individually owned these days and the quality of everything is superb. Family friendly and always packed on Friday and Saturday nights at dinnertime. Call ahead and they will put your name on the wait list. You can also reserve a table on their web site.

The owner told me the entire interior design and all the items were hand selected from Mexico by himself and brought to the restaurant. It's a great atmosphere and the staff is friendly, quick, and knows how to serve hungry customers.

THE FOOD:

When you are seated you get chips, salsa, and bean dip. Always great!

All of their sauces are made by hand fresh daily. I think they have 7 of them.

We have tried, and LOVE the following dishes:

- Chicken Fajitas

- Carnitas (they serve them with a rib!)

- Chicken Enchiladas (with the green sauce) This one is my favorite. The flavors are delicate, the chicken is shredded and tasty and it has me hooked. I normally ask for a side of shredded lettuce and cheese instead of the usual rice and beans. It's just my preference.

They also have a awesome dessert that consists of a huge ball of fried ice cream surrounded by caramel sauce and sliced plantains (think bananas) that is lit on fire and served to you flaming! Soo good!

I have heard their Sunday Buffet Brunch is pretty awesome, but I normally go on Saturday nights for the LIVE mariachi band so I miss going on Sunday.

I signed up for their loyalty card the second time we went back. They put 5% of the total of your bill each time you dine on a gift card that you can just save up and use towards any meal. How awesome is that? I think I have close to $30 right now saved on it.

The price of the food is very fair for the quality you get. Portion size is more than enough. All in all I can't say anything negative about this place... and no, I wasn't paid to write this. HAHA.",qnfLeoTKD45gKVoDu6ZWiw,2,1,5,dKtv6ZbhRwwA7_QA9zaXqQ

We came in on Cinco de Mayo and it was just awful.  The salsa was watered down, Fideo soup had no noodles, and the fajitas were dry and lacked any flavor.  Additionally, we had a conversation going on between three people that verged on xrated and spoke of their sex life so that four tables away we could hear them with no issue, and I am no prude.  If I would have had my children I would have left the restaurant and never returned.  Our waiter Efren appeared to have no issue and proceeded to give lackluster service.  Fast forward 20 days to today and we again have the same waiter and we again are disappointed by the food and waiter.  We ordered two burritos and a combo and received no soup and my chile relleno was raw and not cooked.  It is with great sadness that i write this as we have come here for years.  I fortunately refer you now yo our alternate mexican restaurant Viva Mercado in Village Square or any if the numerous Cafe Rio Locations, which to this point have not altered the quality of their food.  I may not come back, I will not come back for Cinco, and i definitely will not refer anyone at this point as it is just disappointing. Quality Quality Quality.

The Margaritas are not impressive and I am sure I do better with one eye open missing an arm so that is a letdown as I crave good margaritas and will choose where I go alot of the time on them as sometimes I just want a drink and chips/salsa.

The ambiance was nice, the staff attentive and the margaritas and mimosas were flowing for those that wanted them (and they didn't go light on the alcohol in those drinks either)!

I enjoyed the variety and freshness of what they had out for the taking, which not only included some Michoacan flavored Mexican dishes, but a couple main stay brunch items such as bacon and sausage.  The shrimp cerviche stood out as memorable, as did a tender beef dish I do recall the name of. Actually, everything I sampled tasted very good.

If you want any of their freshly made tortillas (corn or flour) you have to ask your waiter / waitress for them. A couple at our table bitched about this, but after I explained that if they left them out at the buffet line they would either end up dried out or soggy, depending on how they were left out, they understood and enjoyed them fresh off the grill.

Although the staff sport their ""gringo"" shirts I was not offended (takes a lot to offend this white boy), but it could others:

Recently one of our favorite Mexican restaurants closed and we were driving by Michoacan's after church Sunday morning and thought we'd finally give it a try. 

Upon arrival there were several people outside as well as standing in the doorway and once we got closer we realized why--the entrance and waiting area was tiny. I managed to squeeze myself through to get our name on the list so we had about a 20 minute wait. They were also setting up for their Sunday Brunch Buffet which seemed to account for many of the patrons. 

Although the restaurant seems small there is actually quite a bit of seating that wraps around to the bar area and even outside. The décor is what you would expect for a Mexican restaurant with nothing over the top. They have an extensive menu with almost too many options so I had a hard time deciding. But I finally committed to the Campenchana along with an a la carte shrimp enchilada. My Hubby opted for his usual: cheese & shredded beef enchiladas. The meal was very enjoyable. I was happy the black beans were actually blacke beans and not mashed with lard like regular refried beans like so many restaurants seem to do. 

Although our server was a little slow we didn't really mind as were relaxing and enjoying everything, 

I would certainly go back, as there are other items I'd like to try on the menu.",0_J-edyZgAkDPHjpZKmiMg,2,1,4,E_4SiO7dcTjGgy5kUjYKsA

If you come after 11 am, it will be jam packed.

I ordered the Nachos & Mom ordered the Playa Combo....which is a Chile Relleno & Chicken Taco.  The food came out quickly and of course everything was fresh and delicious.

I love how they have complimentary unlimited Chips & Salsa w/Beans.  The Salsa is spicy, just right and the Chips are homemade.

I was excited when I saw Squirt listed under the sodas. Ordered it. They did not have it. Decided to try a blueberry daiquiri since I saw it on the menu. The waiter came back to inform me they did not have it. For dinner ordered the skirt steak. Which is always one of my favorite cuts off meat in Mexican cuisine. Once AGAIN, the waiter came back and informed me they did not have it. I went with the NY strip instead, which was more expensive. My entire family was served their meal EXCEPT ME! Once I informed the waiter (food runners brought the meal out to my family ), it took almost 10 more minutes to get my food. What I did receive was delicious. But nothing was done or offered for the delay or that everything I ordered they were out of. Not even an offer to buy my dessert, as most places would.

Coming from Phoenix I had never seen Fideo served at a Mexican food restaurant so I knew this place was authentic! In Mexico my tia's use to make Fideo a few times a week.  It's a brothy noodle soup with a few simple ingredients that's so yummy!

Since I had company from out town, they always like to go eat Mexican and compare to restaurants back home.  I have been to this location a few times in the past and have always been a fan. I thought this would be the perfect place to stop by for lunch.

In the back of the restaurant, there's a viewing area to the kitchen where a giant comal is displayed so you can watch someone making homemade tortillas so this was a treat walking by as we were being seated. 

Hostess was friendly and sat us at the table I picked-luckily I had that option. Being a control freak I always want the best seat in the house.

The soft guitar music playing provided some great ambiance. Lots of traditional decor including ceramics, paintings and carvings, it looked like you were in a little Mexican village. Our friendly waiter was dressed like a Mariachi!  Clever! I was ready to start requesting a song!

Immediately we were served this wonderful complimentary warm bean dip and salsa. The salsa tasted great with the perfect amount of spice and a bright beautiful red color.  A basket of crispy warm corn chips accompanied with just the right texture and thickness.  Nothing worse than a thin or thick chip.

I ordered off the A la Carte menu and chose the enchilada filled with shredded chicken and beef. The red chile sauce was very good.  The fluffy rice was cooked to perfection and beans were very tasty.

Service was speedy and we had friendly, all around great attentive service.  Plates start at about $10 and go up to $22 plus.  Lots of variety to choose from, overall a great place.

I can't wait to come back to try more dishes! Next time I'll try a churro for dessert and guess what Bobby Flay? Unlike Mesa Grill-they offer churros at lunch time! Bravo!",uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,8,6,4,u37WEWjefMHsZYMyFf989Q
4012817,2013-03-08,1,S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA,"Review for Sunday Brunch!

Not to be confused with Lindo Michoacan, this Michoacan is located next to Red Robin and across the street from Sushi Loca in the far North West.  Jade hosted a UYE for Sunday Brunch and this place was packed!

Sunday Brunch is from 10am-3pm.  What a deal!  It's buffet style, a short buffet but my favorite part is the all you can drink house margaritas and champaign mimosas!  I had three plates of fajitas and tons of guacamole since I love avocado but where I killed it was the margaritas!  

The server we had was awesome, he was busy as hell so I had to flag down others to help feed me my alcohol.  And how we got a big party is beyond me but the live mariachi was awesome.  They even sang to a birthday girl in our party.  

Flavored house margaritas usually run for $5.00 each and the food combined would have cost a lot more than the $14 Sunday Brunch cost.  So this was a killer deal, the foods tasted authentic meaning it doesn't have that added fake flare to it, the tortilla machine was spinning and they were coming out fresh to the buffet line.  

$14 Sunday Brunch for all you can drink (and eat too I guess) is not bad at alllll.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,2,3,4,IhQQwN-CeT1bMg1f2fuiHQ

Upon seating we were served a big bowl of house made tortilla chips with the Lindo house salsa and bean dip.  Hey, great beginnings!  Chips were still warm, I don't normally like smooth salsa (I like em' chunky LOL) but the flavor was good in Lindo's.  But that bean dip though!  Very tasty!  We were happy to eat all of this up!  No appetizer needed!

Actually, we weren't hungry enough to order entrees for each of us - so we did end up ordering appetizers to share!

**Nachos Monarca's - Corn tortilla chips with beans, melted cheese, jalapenos, and carne asada, topped with guacamole & sour cream

**Elotes - Mexican street corn grilled with mayo, cotija cheese, and lime chile powder

Both great choices overall!  The nachos were covered in tender carne asada, and thankfully it's real shredded cheese over EVERY chip!  Not into that cheese whiz stuff on nachos.  The platter was big too!  More than enough for 2 to share.  The elote was good too but was a little light on the lime chile powder.  Gimme sour!  Gimme spicy!  Gimme gimme gimme!  Luckily the extra limes on the side provided an extra kick.  Next time I'm gonna tell them heavy on the chile powder!

I probably ate more carbs than I should have that night - wonder if I was able to stay on KETO?  Service was speedy & friendly - the place was packed on a Friday night.  We'll visit Lindo again, maybe next time for their famous Fajita platters!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,5,4,xZD4oYvGb1rRsgNornWr3A

There was a great assortment of reworked classic rock playing softly throughout the restaurant today. It was a nice touch to an already beautiful restaurant. There in no shortage of painting and carved wood at this place. And so the afternoon started well enough.

I began my lunch with the traditional chips and salsa with bean dip thrown in for good measure. So far so good.  Next came the sopa de fideo. Its like Lipton noodle soup only better and perfect on a cold day like today. For my meal I ordered chicken fajitas. They came out quick enough. My respect started waining when I saw only two under cooked tortillas for what looked like a large portion of fajita fixings. It turned out there was just enough chicken, rice and beans to wrap in two tortillas. Yet there was more than enough pepper and onion to go around. I ended up eating those plain with a fork after my chicken and tortillas were gone. The flavor was lacking. I like more citrus flavor in chicken fajitas so I squeezed the lemon from my iced tea over the sizzling skillet for that sour boost of flavor. During this meal I couldn't help but think of giving Michoacan a 3 star rating as much as it pained to do so. Then came dessert.

I ordered flan which, I was told by who appeared to be the manager, was ""heavenly."" I'll be the judge of that. I've had some good flan at many other restaurants in the past. This better be special. It  was.  It was firm and thick yet velvety soft. Rich. Decadent. Creamy. I don't know how to better describe it. It really was one of the best flans I've had anywhere.

The restaurant doesn't seat many parties, but the floor plan separated sections of the restaurant, making for in intimate setting, as do the booths with high backings and shallow seating. There's a bunch of Mexican decor on the walls, not tacky at all. 

Our waiter was warm and available. Between he and the buser, my water was always full. They started us off with chips y salsa y bean dip. 

I ordered the Filet Relleno ($20), a white fish stuffed with octopus and shrimp, deep fried, and smothered with Sarandeado sauce. The sauce was pretty much a spicy mayo. But mayo and white fish always wins. Wins! 

My mf got the Birria de Chivo ($16), goat cooked in a beer broth with chiles and spices, served with chopped raw onions, cilantro, and tortillas. It was really good. The broth is an intimidating magma-red, but it really wasn't that spicy. The goat meat was tender and tasty and very fatty ... but that's where the flava is. 

The prices were reasonable. 

I'll be back to try more.

One of my favorite Bean dips is brought to your table before your meal along with chips and a great hot sauce. By the way, save some of the hot sauce to use on your meal. The bean dip is warm and just the perfect consistency. 

I have enjoyed the Carne Asada platter on several occasions. The Carne Asada has very good flavor and the meat is tender and juicy.

We dined at Michoacan last week for our 18th wedding anniversary. On that occasion, I tried the Chile Relleno. It was an egg-batter dipped large chili pepper stuff with a wonderfully gooey melty cheese. It was wonderful and I would recommend it highly. The Chile Relleno plate also came with a delicious chicken taco. There was a large amount of chicken stuff into the taco with a crunchy shell along with lettuce and tomato. I used some of the hot sauce I saved from before to place inside the taco.

5051414,2013-02-26,0,S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA,"I hosted a UYE (unofficial Yelp event) for their sunday brunch and the food and service was awesome. I wrote up a detailed review of my last visit and this one was just as good, possibly better. Consistency and value - they get the 5 stars. I think we will come here for Sunday brunch quite often actually. 

There was a smaller back room where we were seated. We got sat right away, even though our whole party wasn't here. We were able to make a reservation for it and our table was ready for us at 11:30am. 

I wondered if the menu changed per week and this was slightly different from this week to the last time I went. If you're curious of the offerings, they actually update their website menu for that weeks brunch so you know ahead of time what is in store. They keep staples the same but the soup rotated (last week- caldo de res, this week-menudo) and one signature dish changed (last week- shrimp ranchero, this week- gallo al cognac). The rest were consistent to what I thought of last week but these two new items were very good! The menudo was so tender, almost melty. The gallo al cognac was awesome. It had a yummy mushroom creamy sauce.... I don't know how Mexican this is, but it's something similar to a dish I make at home. They ended up being the favorites, along with a lot of people shoveling shrimp ceviche and guacamole in their faces. 

The one difference I found out about this visit was about the drinks. Yes, with the $13.95 buffet drinks come with, including mimosas and margaritas and I knew about that....BUT.... I thought that you can get only the house margarita last week, but found out this week you can also request flavors! They had so many, but the popular ones for the group were mango, strawberry, midori, midori pineapple. If you get flavored, they come blended UNLESS you specify on  the rocks. I prefer on the rocks myself. 

Service was very good, considering how big our party was and that the rest of the restaurant was also busy. Kyle was our main server and he was friendly and great on trying to keep up on the consistent beverage orders of the group. We had a few hiccups with drink orders, but I don't think having EXTRA margaritas brought to us was a fault at all. If someone wanted rocks and it came blended, someone in our party would want it. One nice touch was that it was Jieun L.s birthday this week and we were talking about it and wishing her well. Our server overheard us and took it upon himself to gather up some of the staff to play instruments and sing to her Mariachi style! They donned her in a giant sombrero and gifted her with a giant tequila shot and churros! It was a really nice touch and a fun highlight in our meal. 

I feel like the more people will catch on to this buffet, there's going to be a line to get seated and a price hike. Until then, the BF and I agreed to come often for the great value brunch. This is one of those places that is in my neighborhood and I feel, why haven't I tried this sooner? Finding out about the brunch was a really happy accident.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,3,5,_kCPWNsQ2Ic-U3ruu8mvyg

Chicken fajita for two was filled with chicken pieces that looked like they were scraped from a slaughter room floor. The seasoning made the chicken orange, and several pieces were nothing but connective tissue. Onions were not on the serving plate -- well there was one small piece of onion.

5319793,2013-07-15,3,S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA,"I went here with some crazy Yelpers on a Sunday morning for brunch.  It was AYCE plus bottomless mimosa and champagne from 10am-3pm.  We had a table in the very back of the restaurant and it was a smart move on their part as things got crazier the more mimosas we had... which was to be expected.

Free chips, refried beans and salsa.  The buffet includes shrimp ceviche, chicken taquitos, chile verde,  caldo de pollo, flour tortillas, Michoacan potatoes, bacon, sausage, beef fajitas, chicken fajitas, guacamole, jalapeno poppers, rice, beans, salad, fruits, cookies and pastries.  I made 2 trips to the buffet line (I would've made more trips if I didn't have a food poisoning episode the night before) and filled my plates with beef and chicken fajitas, sausage, taquitos, guac and jalapeno poppers.  Food was tasty!

We had the most profound conversations over champagne, mimosa, Midori, pina colada, etc.  The mimosas kept coming.  There was somebody celebrating their birthday at the next table.  So, the servers sang ""Happy Birthday"", put the sombrero on the person with the birthday and gave him a shot of tequila.  I've had 4 glasses of mimosa at this point and I may have uttered the word ""birthday"" because by my 5th mimosa, the servers came to our table, put a sombrero on my cabeza and started singing!  Jesus was playing the guitar and singing.  It was beautiful like church on Sunday.  But they didn't give me a shot of tequila, what gives? My birthday is not until August though.

We were there for a good 3.5-4 hours  and it was definitely $13+ well-spent! We'll be back for sure!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,3,2,4,G6tX9bnn6BMWVh--1G5iJA

If you want to travel to Michoacan, Mexico without leaving Nevada,  go to The Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant on Centennial Center. Owner Mark Berry has a passion for the very special place.
From the moment you walk in the door you'll see paintings painted by painters admission work on, Mexican hats, the warmth of hand carved wood pillars and insets, that were really brought back by Mark Berry from Michoacán. 

From the time you open the double doors you'll be greeted with a smile as though you're family by one of the beautiful hostesses.
 
The combination plates at the Michigan gourmet Mexican restaurant showcase charming towns in Michoacán, Mexico.

The time you walk through the door will be filled with a feeling of warmth that will surround you:

When you come through the double doors you will see: hand-woven tapestries;  hand carved wood, and you'll smell the aroma of Mexican food native to Michoacan.

From the beautiful tapestries on the wall, to the wood carvings, to the Mexican hats, and hand made pottery, there is life all around the place, the taste of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas and the sound of guitar music playing in the speakers that play music throughout the restaurant. 

Not only is the regional specialties delicious from The Michoacán but the people who work there will make you want to return soon.

The people who work at the restaurant are treated like family by Mark Berry the owner and will treat you like family too.

Outside the kitchen and serving you with a beautiful smile is Jenn and Jose, who are always hospitable and fun to be around and are great bartenders at the Gringo and me bar. I love Mark Berry's fun sense of humor.

Here's some of the extraordinary dishes that The Michoacán Gourmet Mexican Restaurant makes on an ordinary Friday night...

Steak, Chicken and Shrimp Fajitas 

Shrimp Tostadas

Carnitas-MarkBerry's all time favorite dish and a Michoacan specialty.

The Michoacan Gourmet Mexican Restaurant features a fabulous Sunday buffet. For one set price you can come in and have dishes like steak with cognac sauce. Chicken Sarandeado, an omelette made to order, and a host of other not found in other restaurants dishes like Shrimp Ceviche.


Another very unique in ""must-experience"" item is their tableside guacamole, made with a whole variety of tasty ingredients like tomatoes, onions, lime and cilantro, that you can add like ripe, buttery Hass avocados.

No matter where you sit at The Michoacán Gourmet Mexican Restaurant you will want to return frequently. There are so many fantastic menu selections, it would take you a year to try them all!",vlcsGHaSPAS_Bb59EW6E8g,2,1,5,_mUoeuz1kewhyhzYZK1A-Q

The food was very good, as expected.  They live up to the self described gourmet Mexican food.  It really was gourmet Mexican food!! 

Then after checking in on Yelp we won a free Churro they cut into 4 pieces. Who knew? 

Almost everyone needed a carry out container.  (No doggie food here. )

Then I ordered pretty good cheese cake to go. They surprised me with two nice slices that filled the ""go box"". More than expected, just like the customer service.

The food was good, for the buffet.  I had a huge plate, then focused my attention on the bottomless margaritas.  Our waiter was great and on the ball.  The highlight was the singing of Happy Birthday and Kathy wearing a sombrero.

They are very accommodating for any size party. 
Use their on-line reservations and your table is ready.
Their Sunday buffets are full of different choices each week, but they ALWAYS have homemade tortillas that are the best.

On this particular day I decided to try the combination plate #1 which is a chile relleno, chicken enchilada, and beef taco($16.95).  Too expensive and the chile relleno was sooo soggy and watery.

So my bro goes ""yo kid, you way too young to begging for money. How about you get a job?"" I started lol'ing and as we walked inside, the urban youth yells ""hobos!"" I was like this cant be real tea. 

 We walked in and said ""2"". The Latinas were mirin. They knew our status. We sit down and in 2 minutes ordered waters and a beer. After grubbing on dat dere nachos with bean dip we ordered fajitas and a burrito. Chicken burrito. 

 The bar was starting to get packed with overweight blonde girls with a tattoo on her back that said ""American Girl Bada$$"" or something like that. I lol in my head and continued the conversation with my bro. Server was great and so was the food. There was an older Mexican dude playing the keyboard. Every song sounded the same. Some kind of Mariachi music. It reminded me of the time when I was in SA at the Alamo. 

 Despite the urban youths running around outside trying to hustle, I would definitely eat here again.",xkJk3dkrowsO1bVNLXpODg,0,0,4,-kWu2IcmSf00QkHwPKdsdg

5931301,2016-06-22,2,S599hCA4kJJO3_b6SRFKoA,"Vegetarians/vegans beware... I ordered vegetable fajitas and they even have a little blurb where you can ask for it to be vegetarian or vegan, and I asked my waiter to make sure my dish was vegan. To me that means there will be no animal products on the plate. There was no sour cream and no cheese which is what I expected, but when my food came out there were two big chunks of steak on it, which together were about the size of my palm, so I asked for a new plate. When the second plate arrived there were two quarter-sized pieces of what looked like ground beef, at which point I stopped digging through it because I didn't feel that I should have to pick through a dish that is advertised as vegetarian to see if there's meat in it. That they specify they can make dishes vegetarian/vegan means they're set up to prepare meatless dishes... right? The waiter was good about it and the manager offered to see that no meat was in the third plate, but I declined it because from what the waiter told me everything is prepared on the same grill. To me that is not at all vegetarian since who knows what other little pieces of meat make it on to ""vegetarian"" orders aside from the big pieces that I saw. I ended up not getting anything else because if it's all made on the same grill and no steps are taken to ensure no cross-contamination happens, that's hardly vegetarian.

That said, everything I did get to eat was pretty good. The guacamole was good and the salsa had a nice heat to it even if it was kind of liquidy. The portions are big although it's a bit expensive. My mother told me her fideo soup was bland but pretty good after she put some of the salsa in. As a vegan, however, I wouldn't feel confident that anything else I got here would be meat-free even though it is advertised as such and I had to write this so other people with my dietary restrictions are aware. At worst I consider it false and deceptive advertising to call a dish vegetarian when it's all made on the same grill with meat and apparently mixed together. 

Also at the end of the meal when they brought the check, they had taken my order off but they had also bumped the cost of my mother's meal up by three dollars from what it was on the menu and then taken a weird $4.34 discount off of that total. Overall it was a meh experience, but I am giving two stars because it's a cute little place and if you don't mind random other proteins being on your plate, you may do just fine here.",pWQNKfnnK4pJqHD29JGKqA,3,0,2,8vyPAGN5zcpCahN4fpGySg

The customer service was on point, my margarita was delicious, and my husband's pork burrito was amazing and was enough for 2 people. No complaints from him. I got a chicken enchilada and pork tamale. I asked for all rice and no beans, but they gave me beans anyways. The server took it back and within 5 minutes I had the correct order. My food however was not as delicious as my husbands. Everything was pretty bland. The enchilada was flavorless, the tamale had very little pork and was mushy, and the rice was plain. We will most likely return, but definitely getting the burrito or tacos.",zRcgTyJBqFNeGYH2TSzSIw,0,0,3,D5iqbc0T7437wRHe35c8ug

The place wasn't busy and guests who arrived after we did got their food first, the waiter was interested in serving as many cocktails as he could for happy hour instead of waiting on us. The manager who was walking around could also care less. When our food finally came out it was burnt after waiting an hour for it.

We arrived around 11 and were seated quickly. The layout of the restaurant is just awkward. The aisles are tight to say the least and the booths were even tighter. As we were sitting the wobbly table bucked up and nearly fell over. Lesson learned, hands off the table. We sat and waited quite some time before anyone approached us for a drink order. This was fine since we were catching up and distracted after not seeing each other for so long. 

Eventually a waiter came by to take our drink order but it was hard to get his attention with any more questions since the aisles were so tight as he was talking to other tables. We again sat a while, trying to figure out exactly what to do since no one told us where buffet was and we were tightly crammed in a booth across from a large family that had a child in a high chair that took up most of the aisle. Finally, we headed to the buffet area. It was jam-packed and there was quite a line. We waited patiently, but we were constantly having to move aside to let people pass and vice versa. The line was pretty slow, but we eventually filled our plates and headed back to the table. The food was ok. Nothing amazing, but I did quite enjoy the fresh tortillas and unlimited margaritas and mimosas. I didn't drink too much, but felt I got my money's worth. I think they need to have a better organization process for filling up the buffet as it got pretty sparse with the crowds of people waiting in line. Not sure if they could situate it in a better place in the restaurant but it was definitely in an awkward location since the walkways were narrow and the buffet is also on the way to bathrooms which makes for quite some congestion while people are waiting for their food and while the waitstaff is trying to transport drinks from the bar (which is also in this same small area) to guests.

The food was pretty good and I was happy with the meal. Service was slow to begin with but as we sat there longer the servers finally started coming by with refills more often. I'd come back but maybe a little earlier to avoid the rush and request a table in a more open area of the restaurant, like the bar area, that was easier to get up and down from. I'm actually kind of surprised they didn't try to fill the bar area that is closest to the buffet with those partaking in the brunch and trying to put more a la carte guests in the back harder to get to booths. That's what I would suggest for better flow in the restaurant.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,5,3,dQNDoaUWHKZlQzUbY-kLOA
