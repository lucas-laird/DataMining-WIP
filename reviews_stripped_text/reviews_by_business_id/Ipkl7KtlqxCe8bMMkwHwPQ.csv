102131,2015-03-26,0,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"I remember my step dad bringing me here when my little brother was only three, that was 10 years ago.
I have been wanting to go back for such a long time and today I finally got to take my kids and husband to this shadowed gem hiding in plain sight. My husband is so picky with where to eat but being that we both like the 50s era I knew he would appreciate the ambiance, music and feel.
He ordered the two egg special with hash browns and bacon. He had such rave reviews all he could do was look at me with a cheeky smile after each bite. I knew with or without me this is a place he would come back to. He had coffee the whole time and let me mind you that he isn't an avid coffee drinker. He LOVED it. He had three cups.
I had the large meatlovers omelet with spuds and the pumpkin nut bread-most Devine thing ever- It was soooo yummy. I was a fourth of the way done but couldn't do it. I was upset that I couldn't finish that goodness lol.
Our 5 year-old had the 2 pancake special and our waitress recommended the sweet cream batter. I took one bite.. Died and went to heaven.
Everything just had that great home cooked feel.
We ate at 9am and it's 2pm now and I am still full.

All of our taste buds went on an adventure today and we couldn't be happier. I am in strong belief every Thursday on my husband's  day off.. that this will be our breakfast joint. Service was spectacular, everyone was friendly and awesome. We were definitely satisfied.",TvP6j_rMcd1TjS4TQDbdew,0,0,5,0SPXITd_yLnF9mi6CmZFQQ

982439,2016-07-16,0,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"Darn good diner. Some places try to be something they're not; like a truck stop trying to serve good French cuisine. It could happen, but it's probably rare. This place, however, says it's a diner, serves diner food, and does a very good job. 
It opened promptly at 7am, and the place was ready to go (we've been to two places that when I've commented on the substandard early morning service, the owners wrote to me and said the staff was still setting up. I think a restaurant should be ready to serve at the time they open).  The service was very quick and pleasant. 
I had bacon, eggs, hash browns and an english muffin. My husband had a sweet cream pancake on a previous visit, this time he had the Portuguese omelette with spuds. We also shared an order of pumpkin bread.
The pumpkin bread was very good, my hash browns were perfect, bacon was great - the server asked if I wanted it crispy; it's nice that she asked- and the eggs were just the way I like them. 
My husband's omelette was tasty, the spuds were like soft potato chips and very good. The last time he got the pancake, he liked it. 
Overall, great diner food, friendly & fast service, the kitchen seemed to be well run, and comfortable setting. If I lived closer, I'd be a regular.

The staff tends to you since it doesn't get extremely packed like a dennys or Ihop, which those places are too commercial for me anyways. I like little mom and pop places like this. Food is great, and they're on top of the coffee which is awesome for a coffee addict like me. Def a must try if in Vegas, a little out of the way if youre staying close to the strip, but if youre like me and dont like to go anywhere near the strip and stay off the strip i recommend this place.",rbk7tDsCr0FNYTfg51dB8A,0,0,5,L7qnhhTPOtXyM2KFfcDZ1w

We came in an hour before closing and there was only one other couple so I'm assuming the rush was over but I'm sure this place gets packed earlier on.  We ordered lunch and breakfast.  We ordered the California Sandwich which consisted of grilled chicken breast, lettuce/tomato, mayo, jack cheese, avocado and jalapeno bacon on toasted sourdough bread accompanied by homemade kettle chips which they call spuds. Since it was our first time here without even asking us our server had the some of the spuds cooked crispy and soft so we could decide for ourselves on our favorite cooking style...wow! I really appreciated her doing this and for the record my favorite spuds are the crispy ones but my husband liked the soft one so now we know for next time to ask for half-n-half.  
 
We also ordered their pancake breakfast which comes with a short stack, 2 eggs any style, and sausage or bacon.  You have the choice of buttermilk or cream pancakes.  So we went with the highly recommended cream pancakes.  And we were not disappointed. They are good old fashion pancakes with a hint of sweetness and just marvelous!  And since there is always room for dessert we shared apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream...yumm !

Sweet cream pancakes - I had high expectations for this for some reason.  And of course it wasn't met.  Maybe it was the cream but these fell flat.  (sad face) Still, you need the carbs to offset the bacon and egg breakfast trifecta.

Unnamed Omelette - once again, an omelette so mediocre, I forgot the name.  I do remember it was quite large and the ingredients were fresh but don't expect it to blow your socks off.  It's a good gut buster to get you through the day.

Service came with a smile and the customers were super friendly too.  Older couple gave up their booth for us since we were with 2 kids.  Travelling away from the strip...you tend to meet the friendlier locals who'll do that for you.",2AmyrQ0f7ErlXYdkXKLGPg,0,0,3,ODQxVZmMN74F1GvwwvJIfQ

Dicing of course!

The die made me get the french toast combo which comes with 4 slices of french toast and 2 eggs, a sausage patty and I ordered corned beef hash on the side.

My Ex had to order hot chocolate which he said was good and he ordered steak and eggs and the steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned very nicely, Not a HUGE portion but delicious.

The french toast was soft and creamy texture, it was cooked, it just tasted cooked with extra love and the hash was grilled I believe as it had that grilled taste, awesome and we ordered a side of ham for the dog and each tried a bite. You have to test the merchandise ya know and it was yummy too.

Service was spot on, The restaurant was clean and CROWDED which is always a good sign, Prices were out of this world GOOD.   

The only negative I would say is that when you walk in, there is no sign that tells you to seat yourself or to wait to be seated so if you have never been to this location as we had not, you wont know what to do, we stood there for a minute and then I asked a customer and he said, Yeah seat yourself.

I bought the BBC Omelet (Bacon, Broccoli, & Cheese) which came served with potato slices and two pieces of toast. The small should be sufficient for someone looking for breakfast and the large would probably be best for a filling meal.

The omelet looked cheap but was very satisfying in flavor. No complaints.
The potato slices were a little overcooked but didn't give off a burnt flavor so not too bad imo.
One slice of toast was good and the other was a little burnt.

The restaurant looked like it could hold about 70 people. There were only about 10 people in when I went. It also had a free book exchange (or at least that's what I'm assuming it was), so you can bring in a book that you finished reading and pick up a different one. They're only open from 7am to 3pm.

Overall, I'd say you get what you pay for. If you're looking for an exquisite breakfast, this is not the place to go to, however, if you're looking for something quick and cheap, then you'd regret not trying out this place.",ee-AavlXAeUPjhC3CYZboQ,0,0,3,r2xnE-6XR01kBnzH4Xd_0Q

The place wasn't that busy, the service was pretty friendly, can't complain there (for once!). 

The server wrote down my order wrong (minor thing, wrote spuds instead of fries - so I got the slices fried potatoes). When we pointed it out, however, her response was ""he's so weird"" in reference to the cook. Personally, unprofessional in my book. 

I still got an order of fries, so all was good. 

I ordered fish and chips. The serving wasn't huge, but was adequate for the price (under $10). My husband got a burger, said it was pretty good. 

I got the small order of onion rings as well, which appeared to be your typical frozen deep fried variety. 

The fish and chips were decent, but there was an odd, overly sweet taste. The tartar sauce was over sweet as well and it added up to a not so great meal. 

Again, I would go back, but I would simply steer clear of the fish and chips. 

As for the actual venue, it is need of some updating. The tables were peeling apart, and the decor is just dated. All in all, 3 stars because I would be willing to try something else on their menu.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,2,0,3,l4NwRPrs2zgttMs5MIzvwg

It was nice that I could choose between a 3 egg and a 6 egg omelette since eggs aren't the kind of thing you want to haul around in a doggy bag.

Hubby & i have been coming here for years. Its a dive for sure, with kitchy 50s decor that looks like it may have been here since the 50s, but i like that sort of thing. They even have a jukebox playing oldies :)

The service is usually friendly, the food is ok but nothing to write home about. Its decent though, fills your belly, and is relatively cheap. 

Kids meals are only $2.65 each, and theyll give you coloring pages if you ask. Its a very casual atmosphere that makes me & my gang of kids feel welcome. 

Bigger portions, Lots of choices & they accomodate substitutions with no problem. Try the homemade pumpkin nut bread, also the homemade ""chips"".

We made our way back to the friendliest diner around since I haven't had a plate of Awesomeness(AKA their Sweet Cream Pancakes) in a while. We were fortunate to have Veronika wait on us again which is always great because just her interaction with customers whether they are regulars or first time customers is some of the best service you'll ever have. Seriously.

We both split  a Breakfast Sandwich Special which came with spuds(their potato chips which you can request soggy or crispy) and a two pancake special(Your choice of Buttermilk or Sweet Cream) which also came with two eggs and either a sausage patty or two strips of bacon. At this point, I couldn't decide between sausage or bacon, so  Veronika suggested some Jalapeno Bacon which they also serve in their omelettes and sandwiches and I was sold! Everything was delicious as always, and we were fueled up to start our day.

It's great to see that this place is constantly packed and that this family owned business is doing well. Another thing I've noticed is that they now have a lunch and dinner menu, and that they are open until later(I believe I saw 7 am-9 pm Monday-Saturday, and Sundays only, 7 am-3 pm) but I wasn't too sure, so you may want to call to confirm.

3754864,2014-08-05,0,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"I went for lunch on 8/4/2014.  I entered and the restaurant was busy with a lot of tables and booths full, although there were still a couple of tables open, I  decided to sit at the counter. I was immediately given a menu by a friendly waitress with a smile on her face.  I ordered the dinner chicken fried  steak but  it was called by a different name.  It came with two sides and I chose a salad and mashed potatoes.  The salad was nothing great and I would call it average.  I was given two packets of crackers, no butter, and I was not asked if I needed anything else.  The silverware was set on the counter with no napkin and I was surprised because I had no idea if it was clean or  if it had been cleaned and I pulled some napkins out of the napkin holder, wiped the fork and knife clean and set it on a napkin.  Just as I finished the salad my ""chicken fried steak"" was served and it was plain and simple.  Breaded steak patty with ""mashed potatoes"" covered in a gravy that was probably the best part of the meal.  It had small pieces of meat, but  I couldn't tell if it was sausage or hamburger, and I thought that was odd,  because I am a gravy man.  The mashed potato had what appeared  more flour than I was used to, and it stuck together oddly, like it might have been from a baked potato that had been mashed to make mashed potatoes.  The steak patty was breaded and the coating fell off the patty before I could cut it.  It must have been frozen and did not adhere to the patty when cooked.  I did eat the whole thing as I'm not one to let any Chicken Fried Steak go to waste, but I would not order this item again.  I was not asked if I needed anything while eating either the salad or the steak, even though, I was sitting at the counter and all the servers had to do was turn around while in the area and ask.  It may have been that I ordered a dinner item  for lunch,  but it lacked, anything special  that would make me return and have another.  To be fair, I'll stop in again and order breakfast, or another meal and give them a second chance, because even the best places can mess up on occasion.  My meal/with drink came to $12.99 and it was not as good as a Chicken Fried Steak, I would have gotten at the Longhorn Casino for half the price, with eggs on the side.",L5JFnETi16y2gNiESXBYeA,1,0,2,oXjeiA31feCdm82hq9zuGw

Seating myself at the counter, I was asked immediately if I wanted coffee.  That's always a good sign.

It's described as a small omelette filled with ham, onions, and garlic covered with a feta sauce and served with avocado and hash brown potatoes.

The wait was a normal time and I enjoyed looking at all the memorabilia from the 50s and 60s whether photos of classic Las Vegas places and entertainers or another wall that had 33 1/3 album covers from music of the period.

The omelette was delivered and it was good.  I didn't taste the garlic but the feta cheese sauce was good.  Serving the avocado on a separate plate was a good idea so everything didn't get mushed together on one dish.

Service was very good.  My coffee was refilled often.

Second, the service was terrible. We placed out order and I had to ask for pumpkin bread 3 times during my visit before I received it. No one came to check on us. I had to fight to get half and half for my coffee. 

Third, the food. We order the pancake special and the 2 egg special. The pancakes were decent but nothing tasted fresh like you would expect from a diner. When I finally got that pumpkin bread I was fighting to get it was terrible.

The main reason I liked this place was that it had an actual diner feel. When people in Vegas think of a diner they think of Denny's. They have the wait staff right on the front of the menu. They're all nice. I do wish they wore like a 50's themed servers outfit but oh well lol.

I had their smothered steak with garlic bread that came with 2 sides for $12. I chose their soup of the day and their spuds. It was cream of mushroom and the chips they have shown on everyone's photos.  The soup was good, nothing special. I do like their spuds. They're like home made potato chips. They're delicious. If they seasoned them they would definitely be special to me and something I would crave and return often for.

The steak came ""smothered"" in mushrooms and grilled onions. My food was okay. I don't expect much when it comes to steak at a place like this but my steak sucked. I'm so sad to say! I assumed they'd be hesitant to do a medium well and serve it pink so I went with medium and it was gray/brown in the middle. It was disappointing. I didn't send it back I just drowned it in A1 but steak really shouldn't NEED that. Also their really should have been a sauce if it were smothered. I should have known to get something easier to not mess up like chicken fingers.

Anyways I also had coffee and their 50's platter. The coffee was great and definitely refilled plenty. The platter was an appetizer sampler and was a big portion for 7.99. It came with two chicken fingers, two fish planks, zucchini fries, and onion rings. Everything was tasty. 

Overall I enjoyed my visit. I do like the waitresses. The food was decent. The prices were fair. Won't break the bank but not super cheap. For three people who shared an appetizer, 3 coffees, and three ""entrees"" we spent $40.

Would I return? Yes. I'd want to try their desserts like apple pie to see if they're home made. 

I would try one of their omelettes as they have a whole page of em! They also have all of the classic diner items you'd expect like biscuits and gravy, breakfast items, steak and eggs, and eggs Benedict.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,3,1,3,edQDOzbUC4_ka25GKYo5HA

4. Food: NY Steak and Eggs, Patty Melt, BLT

4107149,2014-05-08,2,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"I've been eyeing this place for a while now, and I finally resolved to try it today. I'm glad I did.

There's some wordage outside saying that this is Omelet House 50's Diner. One of the employees mentioned that they used to be owned by Omelet House a long time ago, and it really shows in the menu. All those omelets are pretty much the same, and there's plenty of other typical diner options for breakfast and lunch.

I was being a little budget-minded. I was sad that the ""early bird"" 1/2 sandwich and soup special advertised outside (~$5) was only available starting at 2 (and going until 6?) so I went for the two egg breakfast special instead (available all day for $4.99) with spuds, bacon, my choice of scrambled eggs, and a $0.89 substitution of the pumpkin nut bread for the toast.

That pumpkin nut bread was probably my favorite thing, with a rich flavor complemented by my liberal addition of butter and the sweetness of the baked-in raisins. The eggs were moist, the bacon was good if a little modestly sized. The spuds were very similar to what I've had at Omelet House, and they're basically really thick chips. Would've liked if they were all somewhat crunchy, but some were chewy and some were a bit overdone.

Really though, none of the menu options really will break the bank. It's solid American Food with a retro feel, including the music. I'll have to try it again some time. I think it's a good alternative for lunch in the area if you ever want a change of pace from Thai Food To Go.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,2,4,sxBChiIiRMx7qQfXmp4dHw

The place was busy at 9am, but there were a few booths available, and we quickly found one in a corner by the window. It is 'seat yourself' here, and menus were already on the table. We split an order, as we always do, and this time it was the Mexican Omelet. This has tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, jack cheese, avocado, side of salsa and topped with sour cream and a slice of jalapeno bacon. To this we added sausage inside of the omelet. Oh, and because Nelson Q said that it is a must to order their Sweet Cream Pancakes, we ordered one to share as well. 

It was a nice surprise when we received our breakfast already split onto to plates, and each of us got a slice of spicy bacon. There was a generous amount of avocado in this omelet, and that bacon has a bite! The spice sneaks up on you, but it is wonderful. 
And Nelson Q...THANK YOU!!! I almost took the entire sweet cream pancake for myself. It was so good that I didn't even use the syrup. My husband, who does not eat pancakes, loved it. He kept going back for another bite. 

We are both so glad that we tried this breakfast location. The staff was very nice, and the food arrived promptly at our table. We enjoyed the 50s music playing as well.

4260143,2013-06-10,1,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"This review is for 4.5 stars. When I think of going out for breakfast, I don't think of the chains first (IHOP, Denny's, or Coco's), I think of the little local places, like Omelet House, Jamms, and now this place. 

This family-owned restaurant is located across the street from our Vet's (DI Animal Hospital) and over the years, I've wondered how good it was, noticed that there were always cars in the parking lot. Saw the menu online, www.menusearch.net (good prices!) when I did a search recently (friday night) and wanted to scope it out for an upcoming event. 

No, it's not related to the other Omelet House restaurants, but there are some similarities. (1) You can get spuds, and (2) substitute freshly baked pumpkin bread for the bread choice @ 99 cents, you can't go wrong. There are breakfast specials, $4.99 and under, at the top of the menu (these are updated prices, from the menu online). Add 99 cents for weekend prices. Also, (3) like the Omelet House, this restaurant closes at 3 pm. But you can get breakfast for lunch here, if you like (don't remember if you can get breakfast for lunch there). 

I ordered the country scrambler- ham, onions, mushrooms, & cheddar cheese. The pumpkin bread and butter came first; it was pretty good, but only had one bite so I could eat my meal without being full. The spuds were seasoned lightly and very crispy, golden brown, (""better than theirs"" our server, Veronica said, as we placed our order), and yes, we agreed!- Sometimes the competition's spuds are a little oily and soggy at the bottom. Unlike the competition's large servings (and hence the higher prices), it was just right for me. My husband got the chicken philly sandwich, and I had a bite, it was pretty good, a little ooey gooey (melted cheese on a philly is a good sign), and he finished every bite, too, scooping up the fallen onions and peppers with a fork. Also, my husband helped me finish the bread. Needless to say, was satisfied, and glad that I did my research online friday night. 

There is a pretty good size menu, lots of yummy selections. I want to try the stuffed french toast next time, or maybe the corned beef hash (my favorite). Lots of items average about $6.00 generally for breakfast, and about $8.00 for lunch. Omelets you can have either Small or Large. Lunch is sandwiches, burgers, chili, soup, salads, and also a kids menu.

The atmosphere is totally 1950s, the decor on our side of the wall was Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, & James Dean. On the opposite wall are record covers. While there was oldies music playing, we also heard hits from the 1970s too. Old fashioned floor, black & white blocks. The bathrooms are marked ""His"" and Hers"". There isn't a baby changing station but I used the stool with a couple seat covers on top (hey, mom's have to be creative sometimes). It was a particularly hot day yesterday and there weren't too many patrons for lunch, a few other parties besides us. Clean too. This is a casual place, seat yourself- lots of booths & tables too. 

Our server was super nice and when the baby toppled over the glass of water all over the table, she wasn't annoyed, she just acted really fast, and got assistance from two others there. No biggie. With tip, the bill for both of us was $20.00.

No longer curious, eager to go back again, this is a little gem in the desert. It's one of those little places that could be featured on DDD, but at the same time, don't want the secret ot be out, either.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,4,1,4,c_Zk2AeUmBFFfaSn4EU9jw

4451727,2012-09-10,3,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"Pass. Not the best breakfast or lunch place, by the way they are only open until 3 PM. 

This ""50's style"" Omelet House is located in a skeezy kind of strip mall on the East side of town off of Desert Inn. My husband and I have driven by it countless times and once we tried to stop and eat here one evening, but then realized it closed at 3 PM. We kept saying we'd go back and try it, so we did when my in-laws were in town.

The diner itself is run-down. Seats and tables look worn, so does the floor. Their menus are terrible! I mean they're floppy pieces of decaying crap honestly. Seriously, get new menus. 

The omelet selection I must admit IS extensive. I believe there were about 30 different omelets to choose from? My husband had an omelet though, the ""Pigskin"" and he was not impressed. He said it tasted like fake eggs! I had the cheeseburger with french fries (you can decide between salad, soup, or fries). I thought the burger was nothing special. I asked for grilled onions and they were on the burnt - not grilled - side. My father-in-law got the club sandwich, he didn't say much about it. My mother-in-law got the turkey/guac sandwich. She said the guac had a weird flavor to it (but not spicy). She also had the mushroom soup, which is homemade, she said it was very good. 

The one thing that is redeeming is the fact that the waitress was really, really nice. She gave us samples of their fried potato slices AND got my mother-in-law a sample of the guac before she ordered the sandwich. She was also quick to pick up plates, ask us how everything was.

Facility:  it's exactly what you'd expect a 50s diner to be.  Simple, clean and lots of 50s retro decor.  They even have an old juke box in the corner, but it didn't seem to work. 
They had some booths and some tables and chairs.

Service: A very young lady took our order for drinks, and explained our waitress would be over soon.  The waitress was very polite and took good care of us. She was even tolerable to my 95 y/o Grandpa's attempts at flirting. He kept insisting he knew her and told her she worked at Samstown or Boulder Station. She politely informed him she had been there at the diner for 16yrs. He still kept trying to convince her.  Like I said...""attempts"" to flirt. Grandpa's still got a little game, but not much. 

Food:  the food was pretty good. I ordered the hash breakfast with over easy eggs. Then I ordered 2 slices of bacon on the side, since the YELPERS claimed you can't forgo the jalapeño bacon. They were right, it was delicious!  Crispy, smokey and spicy...just the way I like my men!
The rest of the breakfast was very good, but I was a little disappointed the hash was just canned hash.  It was still good, because I like canned hash too, but I guess I'm spoiled by the Omelet House on W Charleston, where the hash is made in house. 

Overall: we will be back.  Food was good, service was great, and atmosphere super cute. Plus it's convenient to Grandpa's house.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,2,3,4,xMKdPozmCCIlGe1-UY-ELA

4655165,2015-10-27,7,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"The 50's Diner serves more than good food. This family owned restaurant in a strip mall at the northeast corner of Desert Inn and Pecos Road where ironically McDonald's is a landmark serves as time machine that delivers people back to the rock around the 50's. As soon as you step inside the 50's Diner you are transported back to a decade where Elvis Presley was the king of the airwaves, The Honeymooners were on the air, Fremont Street was a shopping destination and Thunderbirds cruised along Durango Drive. Oops! Durango Drive was built about thirty years later.

   This looks exactly like a 50's diner. The color scheme is pink and red. The pink dominates the walls, counter, and gumball machine. Hanging on the pink walls are 50's memorbelia. The red dominates the booths and chairs. Complimenting the 50's atmosphere is a jukebox that plays the rocking oldies.

   The 50's Diner is more than 50% breakfast. Breakfast is a major part of its business. It is actually called Omelet House 50's Diner. Years ago, but not as far back as the 50's, it was owned by the people that own the local breakfast favorite Omelet House. The Omelet House influence permeates the menu. Nearly every entrée includes the choice of spuds. There is nearly a whole menu page dedicated to omelets. I counted 34. There is a horizontal menu section featuring breakfast specials that start off at $4.49 on weekends and $5.49 on weekends. Two of my three visits back to the 50's, I'd have breakfast.

   On my first visit, I ordered the $4.49 two eggs special. The plate featured two scrambled eggs, two slices of bacon, spuds, & toast. The food was good for the money. When it comes to scrambled eggs, in my book Coo Coo's Cafe in downtown Henderson is currently the champion.

  Visit two I ordered the egg salad sandwich with spuds. It was served on toasted bread with a tomato. It was a good sandwich. When it comes to egg salad sandwiches, in my opinion, Bagel Cafe is the current king. Both times the coffee was Starbuck's competitive and often topped off.

  On visit three, I tried their cheeseburger. It seems that 50's Diner extended their hours from closing at 3 to 9. There are dinner choices on the menu. It was during brunch hours that I ordered the cheeseburger that came with fries and costed $6.79 before the Coke. I didn't have to order French fries. I could of asked for soup, spuds, or salad. If Fonzie of the 50's themed ""Happy Days"" was eating this burger in Arnold's, I am confident he'd give it a thumbs up. It wasn't gimmicky. Just delicious. This is one of the juiciest cheeseburgers that I have had in recent times. The 6 ounce medium done cheeseburger was covered with thick melting American cheese. A delicious touch of tomatoes, onions, and lettuce caused me to enjoy every bite to the sounds of the oldies.

   50's Diner might be the dining experience of the future for Las Vegas. In the northeast, especially metropolitan New York City, diners are extremely popular. They are usually family owned restaurants that are open long hours and serve people a large variety of items throughout the day. They are similar to cafes but usually by themselves. Regardless, the 50's Diner will most likely be visited again in my future. They serve good food at reasonable prices in a restaurant thats bring me back to the 50's oldies when my parents were teenagers, Ed Sullivan was popular , and Thunderbirds cruised Las Vegas Boulevard in the shadow of the Sands, Frontier, and Riviera.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,11,4,e3mMkFbtVuQ2rkiKT8oyrA

This is a family owned business and it shows. But as good as it is to support small, family owned businesses it's all about the food. So does this diner get it done? Yes they do. 

They have a pretty good menu with a lot of items but I'm from the Midwest so when trying something new I tend to stick with the classics like in this case a 3 egg omelet, with sourdough toast and potato slices. I'm not a big potato fan but these slices were a nice change from the usual hash browns you see so much of. I went with a California omelet and was very pleased with it. Lots of chicken, peppers, avocado...it was really filling and really good.

4764556,2015-12-14,2,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"My friend and I was on a different part of town and we decided to grab some food. We checked places we still had coupons to and picked this place. It was both of our first time going, so we were excited to try a new place.

When we walked in, no one said anything to us. We were confused on what to do so we both went and stood by the front counter. After a minute or so of just standing there looking stupid, one waitress told us to pick a place to sit.

We picked a seat near the door. It was the only place we could find because they were rather packed. We sat down and after a couple minutes, a waitress came over and took our drink order. I just asked for water with no lemon. Long-be-hold, she brought my water with lemon back. I didn't say anything. I just took it.

Another lady came over and dropped off menus after a few minutes. She came back 3 or 4 minutes later trying to take our order, but we wasn't ready to order. After about 5 minutes, another waitress came over to take our order (I guess they don't have assigned tables).

We ordered the NY Steak (Medium Well) that came with Suds, Toast and 2 Eggs (Scrambled Hard). We also ordered a meal that came with 2 pieces of bacon, 2 Eggs (Scrambled), 2 slices of Toast and Suds. Lastly, we ordered a Cheeseburger (Medium Well, the standard) and Fries.

It took maybe 15 minutes to get our food. 20 minutes to get the Steak Meal, it came out later.

The food was hot but it wasn't that good. Most of everything was just average. The Suds were disgusting. Most of them were burnt. The steak was average. It was a bit tough and it was lacking flavor. The Burger was average. There was nothing special about it. The eggs were wet and I hate wet eggs. I asked for them to be scrambled hard. That was clearly not done. Also, the eggs were not seasoned. We had to add salt and pepper. The eggs really sucked, and that's disappointing, because it's not hard to cook eggs. The fries were average. I guess I should be thankful that they were hot. The water tasted like toilet water. I think they gave me a dirty cup or something.

In all, I was't impressed. This place was added to my ""Never Again"" list.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,2,1,2,FF2H3Nqf0mhsradKYa8QLA

As Scott said, this place is really shabby looking on the outside. It also has really poor hours. They're labeled as closing at 3, but often I've seen them closed at 1 or 2pm. I've kind of wanted to try this place for a couple months, but have never found them open when I want breakfast type food. 

As with any breakfast place, I order the Chicken Fried Steak. CFS is how I gauge a restaurant's breakfast. Screw it up, and I'll never return. This place was pretty average for it. The meat was ok, but it was a really really thin cut of meat. The CFS they serve at Blueberry Hill is much better, in my opinion. The potato chip/slice style side was really good. The eggs were a bit rubbery, though they did do a good job of the over-easy aspect of it. (gotta have my yolk to dip toast in)

We had a sundae afterward. Sadly, the ice cream (even though they have a little ice cream parlor in the place) was a bit freezer burned. For some reason, their chocolate syrup tasted heavily of vanilla. Not really sure what's going on there.

The service was nice, but a few times, my friend and I were waiting for refills or service in general. The check was dropped after we ate the breakfast portion, and we weren't asked if we wanted anything else. It's not like it was busy either.

The sourdough toast was really good too.  Everyone else with my that day enjoyed their omelets as well.  

More outstanding than the food was the service.  The second we walked in we were seating and asked for our drink order.  The refills were constant and they brought out my 4 year old's food right away so he wouldn't have to wait.  Prices are incredibly reasonable we spent $60 for 3 adults and 1 child including a 20% tip.

4835429,2014-10-31,1,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"I came in looking forward to a good meal based off the reviews and ratings for this place, but I left feeling dissatisfied. 

First off, as others have pointed out, this place used to be a Omelete House. A lot of the menu items still reflects this fact with the same type of expansive omelet selection and even how they do their potatoes.

I played it safe and got the sweet cream pancakes, spuds, eggs, bacon, and patty sausage. The pancakes were so flat and tough, they had the sweet cream flavor, but other than that they weren't that good. Only two pieces of bacon came with the pancakes,  they were fairly small and limp. The patty sausage was the kind you would get out of McDonalds, pretty disappointing for a supposed family diner. The spuds were just like the kind you would get out of Omelet House. I asked for them to be extra crispy and with extra seasoning. They came crispy but without the extra seasoning. I asked for the eggs to be scrambled soft.  They ended up being the best thing of my meal, they were fluffy and juicy.

The service was decent. I got the extra napkins I asked for, but I ended up waiting a bit for my check and I just ended up having to walk up to the register to settle my bill.

There were so many things about this place that reminded me of Omelet House, but none of it was as good as Omelet House. I dont have a urge to come back here again.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,2,0,2,4YyHsG0obcD-ORcJ6NN7BA

4958318,2013-07-25,1,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"I was expecting to like this place more.  It has a good amount of seating and was clean.  I was seated and approached nearly immediately for my drink order.  So, that was a nice start.  To eat, I had the chicken fried steak breakfast with biscuit and gravy substituted for the toast.  The gravy had a lot of sausage in it, but lacked seasoning overall.  I peppered it up pretty good and it wasn't half bad.  I would say with seasoning it could be an above-average pepper cream gravy.  But, the lack of seasoning was apparent.  The biscuit was good, but I couldn't finish it.  The bottom half was too tough to cut, so I only had a part of it.  The top half (that wasn't too hard) was a solid biscuit.  

The chicken fried steak was a decent diner style version.  It's a lot of food, but I don't think it's homemade.  The spuds are similar to Omelet House's version of this dish, as many yelpers note.  I would agree that these are better, they were larger and nearly all fully fried.  There were no soggy ones, which can be annoying at OH.  But, like the gravy, there was not nearly enough seasoning.  So, they ended up tasting like ketchup, hot sauce, salt and pepper, which is what I used to season them.

Overall, it's a solid value, but I was not blown away.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,5,2,3,7khaiuvhsStPbnXvoXtsHw

5275235,2018-03-28,1,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"I have been coming to this spot for about six years, regularly for brunch.  A few months ago, I noticed that my bill was wrong (only by a $1).  A cold tuna sandwich was ordered, but I was charged for a tuna melt, which is only $1 upgrade.  Not that big of a deal I thought, honest mistake.  I come here on average, once or twice a week, usually with a friend, so pretty often.  Since the first time I spotted the overcharge, me and my friend (another regular customer) noticed that ALMOST every bill after that had an ""overcharge"" usually only by a $1.  Just enough to go unnoticed.  This happens more often when a meal has an ""upgrade"" option, as the upgraded option would be reflected on the bill, when there was no upgrade.  Despite the times of this happening, we wanted to give the benefit of the doubt, and pass each and every overcharge as an honest mistake.  However, we just went for brunch again today.  Service was and always has been friendly, but yet again, I'm charged an upgraded price for my meal, when it wasn't upgraded.  I dislike that I always seem to have to point this out, even though I'm a regular customer.  The waitress again apologized when it was brought out to her attention, and stated it was a mistake, but at this point I'm a bit annoyed.  It was an honest mistake the first time, maybe even the second or third time, but this time it's just an insult to my intelligence.  I lost track of how many times I, or my friend, had to point this out.  I don't like making assumptions, it's just something doesn't feel right and seems kind of odd for this to be happening quite often.  If it's almost always happening to me, then is it almost always happening with the other customers? Of course to many people, $1 is no big deal and will generally go unnoticed by the time it comes to pay.  However, if you look at the big picture, if this is a honest, yet common mistake, it still has an impact.  Take this perspective for example: according to their business hours, they operate 92 hours a week (except Christmas), and let's say they have on average 50 customers per day (that's about 3-4 customers per hour); now let's say about 15 of those customers per day were overcharged by $1 each, this amount equates to around $420 per month in profits from just a lousy $1 ""overcharge"" mistake.  If this is not done intentionally, then willful ignorance is what I call this.  There is only one waitress though that makes this mistake.  Any other time I had another waitress, I never have any problems with the bill.  It seems shameful to put down a place that I used to really love.  I used to take so many friends here, and recommend this place more than others.  However, today will be my last day that I eat here.  The food/service is GOOD!  I'll never deny them that, but something feels shady.  Now I can't help but think of how many times this happened to me here, where I did not catch it initially.  I never bothered to pay close attention, as I trusted the staff since I was a regular customer.  No person likes feeling like somebody scammed them, and that is exactly how I feel here, not with money, per se, it's just there is a code of ethics between the business and its customers, of which to my current attention, is what this place seems to lack, or at the very least, what the employee(s) seem to lack.

The food is worth eating, but if you choose to eat here, just double check your tab to make sure that you are charged accordingly.  It's your right as a customer.  If the mistake is called out on more often, then perhaps this will help eliminate a simple mistake completely.",tkwb1gX0L3t77sO1y8Jn4w,2,0,1,jeUZeirAoY8XQtvo0TvW8g

Long on my breakfast to-do list, though not particularly close to home, Saturday breakfast at a space known by some as Omelet House and More, but by others as simply ""50's Diner"" saw the sort of food and scene that speaks of an era long past, and with the sounds of Chuck Berry and The King playing overhead it seems like no matter the name there are a whole lot of locals well aware that this place exists.

Owned and operated by the same family for many years, and located just down the way from Boulder City Station, 50's diner is decidedly a lowkey operation that thrusts patrons back in time with décor as well as smiley service as 'Please seat yourself' signage belies a sort of effortlessness that never seems put on, the dog-eared laminated menus speaking to oft ordered classics while specials rotate daily depending on ingredients and chef's whim.

Open 7a-3p Seven-Days a week, it was with a few questions answered that an order was formed, and omitting biscuits and compotes that were admittedly frozen or canned in order to focus on scratch made selections the first bites of the morning paired to repeat pours of coffee were of the restaurant's ""signature"" pumpkin bread, the flavor extremely natural and none-too-sweet with the sort of flavor that spoke to lots of butter, nuts, and fruit plus just a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Unable to resist pancakes that some have said to be some of the better ones in the city, but happy to set aside the pseudo-syrup in favor of 100% pure stuff from Indiana brought from home, the decision between sweet cream and buttermilk led to an order of the former and with a thinness that makes three a not-unreasonable portion for just $5.99 the light flavors and soft tooth are undeniably pleasant, the French Toast of white bread with just a bit of cinnamon egg wash and confectioner's sugar far less interesting and, as such, best passed.

Offering any number of shakes, floats, malts, and sodas the dessert menu at 50's Diner is unfortunately limited to only two options and informed that the apple pie is bought from ""a local bakery,"" but assured the Marquise is made each night in house, a small rectangle of the graham cracker and chocolate compilation was ordered and with dots of whipped cream serving as garnish the flavor proved to be quite rich with a texture not unlike tiramisu, a nice way to end for just $2.99.

Friendly without seeming fake and offering good food at an extremely fair price 50's Diner is certainly not a destination, but worth checking out if one is in the area looking for good pancakes and a whole bunch of omelets, the later seemingly quite popular with those at surrounding tables.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,4,3,EpAHTJ7yhlAORTtalyt9VQ

5353557,2012-12-19,1,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"Just when you think there are no more real homestyle-cooked breakfast spots in the Valley, you find 50's Diner. Nestled in a medium sized strip mall, this restaurant offers some of the tastiest dishes I have been able to find in Las Vegas. The fact that they pile on the food helps a ton as well! 

This quaint diner is geared towards those of us looking for food that is NOT thawed and out of a box and put on a plate, so the staff here takes pride in offering tasty dishes made with the freshest ingredients for breakfast, brunch and lunch. Their coffee is freshly ground and the taste is arguable the best for a cup of coffee in Sin City. Loli (our waitress) and Alberto (owner) are there every day (at least it seems like it!) and they make sure you are very well taken care of and that your food comes out just the way you ordered it.

My favorite item to order here is an omelette. Which one you ask? Any!  Their omelets are offered in the small and large size (3/6 eggs) and whichever one you pick will please your tastebuds with amazing flavors. Not in the mood for breakfast? Try their daily special (always good) burgers, sandwiches or their chili...just as good and awesome-tasting and their breakfast.

Went on Saturday 3-19-16 at 11am for breakfast.  This restaurant is located at the end of a strip mall on Desert Inn between McLeod and Pecos.  It's in the same shopping center as McDonalds, EZ Pawn, and Pizza Hut.

They have changed the outside a bit...it used to say ""omelet house"" on the outside and had some cheesy 50's crap painted on the outside but those are gone now.  The inside has plenty of 50's artwork and they always play music from that era.  I've only ever seen hispanic workers there....it's like a bunch of Mexican folks decided to open up an American diner...and they're doing a damn fine job.  

$29.72 got us two breakfasts, orange juice, and coffee.  I love that they have real cream, butter, sweeteners, and jellies on the table.  Our food came out really fast!  

Their biscuits and gravy are lovely.  The biscuits are soft and fluffy, the gravy is full of bits of sausage and lots of pepper!  I asked for my eggs scrambled and they came out fried but it was no biggie...and our waitress was nice enough to comp my juice.  I wouldn't have said anything but my husband did. 

The pancakes were very fluffy and perfectly cooked.  My husband loved his omelette and we both enjoyed the crispy fried potato slices.

5837872,2018-02-28,3,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"Based on Yelp reviews, I was attracted to try this place.  After having now dined here for dinner on four separate occasions, I consider 50's Diner Omelet House to be my favorite diner in the Las Vegas valley, or anywhere else for that matter.  Although it is rather dated and quite casual, with a classic 50's ambiance, I have been very impressed with the range and consistency of fine cooking in the kitchen, as well as stellar service that I have received when here.

I have enjoyed everything I have tried here, including deep-fried Zucchini Sticks with Ranch Dressing; lightly battered Onion Rings; homemade Chicken & Vegetable Soup brimming with mixed vegetables and fresh white meat chicken swimming in a very tasty broth; a rather sizable Small Dinner Salad with Iceberg Lettuce, tomato wedges, cucumbers, hard carrots, Green Onions, Cheddar Cheese, & good Italian Dressing; two large slabs of tasty Meat Loaf with well turned out Mashed Potatoes & memorable Brown Gravy, and a kick; one of the best Grilled Ham & well-melted Cheese Sandwiches on lightly toasted Sourdough Bread I have had; the best Club Sandwich that I have experienced to date, with both bacon and ham on lightly toasted Sourdough Bread; and a first-rate Tuna Salad Sandwich with fresh lettuce and tomato slices, again prepared on lightly toasted Sourdough.  

Skinny French Fries are quite well made, but I prefer the inventive, delectable, and addictive ""Spuds""--scallops of lightly fried potatoes--as an included side with a sandwich or entree.  

The only item I have tried thus far that was simply okay was a cup of Chili with White Onions, Cheddar Cheese, Kidney Beans, celery, and bits of tomato.  I appreciate that I can spike a Diet Coke with a shot of vanilla to make it a Vanilla Diet Coke, while a spurt of cherry is also available if so desired.  IMHO, based solely on my own experiences, and rated against other dining establishments of the same type--diners--this place deserves five stars.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,8,5,D5f8foiAmlgVE_DF86HL5w

5880593,2015-12-05,1,Ipkl7KtlqxCe8bMMkwHwPQ,"I went to this place because of yelp... Just so you know. It took me a long time to order because there were so many things to choose from. I finally narrowed it down to the French Dip sandwich.

When the server, who was very patient with me, was taking my order, she asked if I wanted the fries or the spuds. I was a little apprehensive about the spuds, so she gave me a free sample, which consisted of about eight or nine's spuds. The sample had both crispy spuds and non-crispy's spuds. I realized, to my surprise, that I like the non-crispy ones a little bit more than the crispy ones, so that is what I ordered with my sandwich. And they were excellent!

Now, about the French Dip..., in the past, at most of the restaurants I have been to, I have had to order more than one serving of au jus... So, in advance, I ordered extra au jus. The cup that they brought the au jus in was large... In fact, it was large enough for my sandwich to fit in, which isn't always the cas. And after asking the waitress, she said that ""yes"" she had them fill the cup more than they normally do. She said that normally they filled the cup about halfway...but as you can see, my cup was almost running over. It was the perfect amount of au jus!

The sandwich itself was probably one of the best French dip sandwiches I have ever had in my life! I don't know if it was the meat, or the bread, or the au jus, OR the combination of all three, but each bite was a masterpiece in my mouth!

I was pretty full after the sandwich and the spuds, so I was not planning on having dessert. However, when the server asked me if I wanted some Apple pie for dessert, I told her ""no, that is not as 50s as a malt."" So then I decided I was not as full as I thought. She agreed with me about the malt and she brought me the menu. When I was looking at the menu, I saw that they had something called egg creams, which is a mixture of milk and seltzer and certain flavors like strawberry, chocolate, or Creamsicle, topped off with a scoop of ice cream... And I said to myself ""that's even more 50s than a malt."" So I got the Creamsicle egg cream.
While it was good, I kept thinking ""I wish I had gotten the malt."" I have a brother who would love this (he's more into sherbet than ice cream).

Had the six egg ham and cheese omelette, with potatoes. Omelette was great, potatoes are meh, nothing special. 

Will definitely come back and see what else they have to offer.",_IcrRgXW1gtVNruseNHAJQ,0,0,5,6z7rpoZDCUX4MhkY1fYZ1g
