The porchetta sandwich may be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, and certainly on of the best in Vegas. I dream about the lemony flavor with the perfect balance of tenderness and crunch from the pork loin wrapped in crispy pork belly. Yummmm!!

Their fries are great, tri tip is awesome, tasty sauces, delicious soup. Come here and support local businesses! You won't be sorry, and the staff is so lovely.",RT5eX5LrHYI4tc1F7Us2iw,3,5,5,1Hsl0ud97-9vB0Mj9XDy0A

I have Celiac and can't eat gluten (wheat). I could tell they aren't used to dealing with that, but they did fine.

I got a bowl with rice, beans, peppers, corn, and steak. I got two side sauces: garlic (only average) and something with cilantro (excellent!). I was really surprised by how flavorful each ingredient was!

The lady who helped me was extraordinarily friendly.

Unrelated to the food: the bar stools are super cool! I took a pic, because I want them for my kitchen counter bar.

Great experience! I will definitely return when I am in the area again.",oVo19eeFMVb4tFJ2asZIuQ,4,4,5,x_WP1pbhdoA7badk9tGHYg

1340246,2018-01-17,0,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"Since the Grand Opening in October 2017, Karved has gained a significant rise in popularity for their gourmet rotisserie. They serve roasted beef tri-tip, porchetta, rotisserie chicken, and all beef hot dog. The most requested items are their tri-tip and porchetta karved sandwich. In addition, they have salad, soup, vegetarian pita wrap, elote corn, homemade karved sauces, and a delighful frozen greek yogurt that is sprinkled with baklava crumble. The menu is designed over a brown parchment with simplicity. Given how the interior space is so clean and polished, you will feel like a welcomed guest at their table served with the greatest hospitality and the best kind of freshly homemade, family meal.

I ordered the Karved Plate with 1/2 Roasted Chicken ($14) which includes Basmati Rice, Pita Bread, a choice of 2 sides: Brussel Sprouts and Roasted Potatoes, and a choice of one sauce: the Garlic Sauce. The half rotisserie chicken is delivered hot, it has a well-seasoned crispy skin and juicy meat, and is served over a good amount of basmati rice. The fork-tendered roasted red potatoes and brussel sprouts are nicely cooked. What won me over is the soft pita bread and that creamy garlic sauce that is made with olive oil and garlic. The garlic sauce is perfectly whipped to perfection which makes it taste so good and deliciously buttery.

Now at the time I was waiting for my meal, they offer if I would like to try a sample of their soup. I chose the Cilantro Chicken and this particular soup makes me want to order a big bowl of it. The ingredients are made simple. It has diced carrot, green peas, kernel corn, shreds of rotisserie chicken, basmati rice, and chopped scallions. The soup is not bland or salty. And what makes this soup so flavorful is in the broth. It really does taste like it is homecooked. What exceeds my expectation is seeing how service is made personable. They come by to each table, kindly greeting and giving one-on-one attention to the customer. Every person is treated as a special guest in their home. They make you feel like you are already part of their family.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,2,3,5,eTG4Y62GJNUE2_DqGoxluA

Came here a bunch of times, ordered a bunch of food, and everything was really good.

Porchetta sandwich was really good. It came with a good amount of pork, and the pork was cooked really well. They also use a really good bread.

My favorite was the Karved French Dip. The beef was juicy and I liked the caramelized onions that came with it. Almost had like a barbeque flavor to it. Was very nice.

Definitely gotta try the pita chips. They are warm and soft. The hummus that came with it was really well made.

Service was really good. The interior is really clean, it's nice that there is an open kitchen. I liked it a lot. Definitely a good place to get some food.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,9,12,4,0kLLX3tLfLHszaN3r8jdHQ
1435103,2018-01-22,0,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"Honestly, one of my favorite meat spots in Vegas. The staff is uber friendly, the menu is on the wall and accessible, and the vibe in the store is dope.

Next, the food. The tri tip is super tender. Great seasoning. They gave us three sauces. Honestly, the best out of the sauces was the garlic butter. How do you not like garlic butter? The chicken is super juicy and well seasoned. The Brussel sprouts are nicely made: great texture, lightly salted. The peppers were very nice. Great addition to the steak and butter. I wish they had a short grain rice option because I like a stickier feel but the long grain rice was very well made. My favorite part was the frozen yogurt and baklava. Nice amounts of creamy, sweet, sour, and crunchy.

Super nice service, super nice food. Will eat again.

Edit: I forgot... get the porchetta. It was described as an Italian Lechon. It was amazeballs. Crunchy, savory, and we'll sauced. Get that",TZCPXnoK4UeUBrgH7oxxhw,1,1,5,fE6V1QT718SyiHc4v07T6w

1559493,2017-11-07,13,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"Yes, five stars. I went in on Wednesday for lunch, came back on Thursday for dinner, and I'm still trying to figure out how I can go back again ASAP. The location is cute and clean, the service is engaging and informative, and the food is tasty and fresh!

They're marketed as a rotisserie, and their chicken plates are a highlight, but I have so far stuck to their sandwiches.  The porchetta is amazing, hearty and juicy with a nice crispy skin for contrast, piled on a hearty artisan roll with arugula, parsley gremolata, and a lemon sauce. It was a fantastic lunch, and I didn't eat for the rest of the day because I was so full.

The tri-tip sandwich was also tasty, with a heap of caramelized onions and a really great garlic sauce for kick. This paired well with their fries, and again, it was a humongous portion. They have seasonal soups; I preferred the beef over the chicken. Their warm and chewy pita chips are my favorite version I've come across; the $4 portion with creamy hummus is huge enough to be a meal in itself.

Both visits have treated me to lots of staff interaction, from answering my annoying questions about the food to trying samples of other dishes and getting detailed info about their menu and concept. Everyone here is very friendly and everything is made fresh in house, from the sauces to the breads and everything in between. Looking forward to coming back for their chicken pita next time!

EDIT: Returned for the chicken pita! It was bomb, and so healthy too. The green goddess dressing is delicious, they really do have amazing sauces here. Sided my order with the the Brussels sprouts, which are nearly the size of golf balls, and lightly roasted and seasoned. Perfection again!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,29,16,5,oOr8O1t5P4k-6_0agwZxDw

I stopped in for a little to go lunch and ordered the 1/4 chicken and a side of hummus and pita.  I opted out of getting the whole plate which includes two sides and rice, because I just wasn't that hungry. Had I been a little hungrier I would have gotten the whole thing. 

The chicken was moist and delicious full of flavor, and roasted perfectly. My favorite were the pita chips homemade crunchy on the outside soft on the inside, paired with the hummus was unbelievable! I would stop in here just to get the pita and hummus haha.

The ambiance is cool and hip,  very relaxing,  and the service is excellent.  Great little spot.",qNeMBnzJc3Kwk8Z39TDZEg,8,3,5,i8Xm_i4uP1MFl2QDHYj4pQ

I entered Karved on a scorching Wednesday
It looked to us like a hipster café
Two helpful servers were smiling away
They took my order and then they did say
How 'bout some samples of our soups of the day
We took two cups 'cuz we were really hun-gray
We slurped it down, our hunger pangs it did allay
One of the best soups to this foodie sansei
Chicken cilantro soup I could eat all day
And it was nice it was free
It was nice it was free

Then came the pita chips and hummus free too
The chips were so hot, freshly made they did do
I picked one up, to make it cool I blew
Dipped it in hummus just a bit not through and through
After my first bite, I did yell ""WOO-HOO!""
Best chips and hummus I've ever had, that's so true!
The crunchy outside/soft inside was the chips' biggest virtue
I gobbled them up quickly, my wife she did too
And it was nice it was free
And it was nice it was free

The stuff we paid for was not so exciting
The tri-tip sandwich did look really inviting
But the meat was salty tough, too thick they were slicing
The bread was not a good choice, each time that I was biting
Everything was falling out, so frustration it was inciting
The Brussels sprouts were not roasted, so the look was not enticing

The ketchupped hot dog, however, my son he was delighting
The black beans were flavorful, meat addition did some brightening

On to the food.  Their twist on porchetta, rotisserie style, makes for a fabulous and savory filling in a large ciabatta roll. The amber cracklings added some snap to the generous sandwich, topped with peppery arugula tossed in seasoned olive oil. Listen up pork afficionados, Hawaiians and Filipino compatriots--if you love porchetta, lechon and roast pig, you will love this sandwich!  If your dream sandwich includes beef instead, prepare to be happy with their tender tri-tip. My hubby was made very happy with his choice. Let it be noted that he had to take home the remaining half of his sandwich because #1, we were given samples of their delicious spicy beef broth soup and chicken cilantro rice soup; and #2, we gorged ourselves on their hummazing hummus and hot fried pita triangles, in addition to herb seasoned french fries plus fry sauce (yay, a noteworthy resemblance to yummy Utah Greek diner fry sauces).

The owner, I believe (Minnesota man who also loves hockey) let us try their frozen, fresh yogurt made today by his wife.  Creamy, tangy and lemony flavored goodness, topped with crushed honey-soaked baklava.  WOW, I would stop in here just for that!  Who am I kidding?

The staff that day were two younger women who seemed to very busy that Saturday morning so I decided I would come back later. I love community as much as food and didn't want it to taint my view.

Instead of going back I ordered on Postmates and had the Tri-Tip Sandwich. It was so different from any I had ever had before. Soft and savory in texture it was topped with a creamy garlic spread and caramelized onions.

I was so won over by the food that I started to frequent the restaurant. It is a small cafe style place with a minimalist design. I love the pristine white subway tiles and the butcher paper menus. The salt and pepper shakers are the cutest of all. I also appreciate the fact that the tables are fully and heavily lacquered. To many times I have gone into a place and the tables are sticky from years of cleaning solutions eating away at the wood.

I even got a complimentary desert from Paul, the owner when my wife began to suggest deserts on one earlier dinner date. He is very cool and fun and outgoing. Needless to say it satisfies my need for food and community.",G7uhKqR8eutNT3JPgP2FQA,5,5,5,c9RBvuly8JCZ7HVT7fIEfw

This is a fantastic spot, with fantastic food, and even more fantastic people! The service is attentive, upbeat, and professional. I walked in and was immediately greeted and welcomed. As I expressed that it was my first time I received a sample of their soup of the day (DELICIOUS), and from there I began my ordering experience. Jacqueline, Jacqui, Jaq, and all the other nicknames we talked about people giving us, was fantastic at the register. She helped me decide on the chicken pita. She was upbeat, positive, knew the product, and really represented the brand well. 

When my food arrived, THE PICKLED ONIONS WERE LIFE. I couldn't get enough. The taste was fantastic and it was well put together and a great portion size.

WARNING. Its a messy sandwhich. Your hands will be drenched in grease. Some of the pork will fall out but ITS WORTH IT. Grab a fork and extra napkins!

I also asked if the 4 dollar FRIES were seasoned. They are!! They season them their way, definitely could taste hints of oregano. It had a great crispy texture! THEN THE mSAUCE!! I cant explain thr flavor but its pink, sweet and tastey!

GREEK YOGURT WITH BAKLAVA GET GET GET for 4.50! It had a slight lemony flavor, like a yakult but absolutley refreshing!! The texture is on point as well as the taste. Baklava is one of my favorite desserts. They crush it up on top! The layers were both crispy and certain bites moist, like its supposed to be.

The SERVICE quick, attentive, inviting and nice. They seem like they always want to improve. Great people!

The employees here have been incredibly helpful and friendly in both of my experiences. In fact, most recently, while I was waiting I was offered samples of their soups which I thought was a really nice touch. 

So both times I got their rotisserie chicken. The first time was the rotisserie meal the second time was the rotisserie wrap. My big hang up on not giving them 5 stars is the price. It's not great value for the price. Now the quality is outstanding - but so is a rotisserie chicken from Costco (best $4.99 value in the world, maybe universe). So $14 for a 1/2 chicken and two sides isn't a bargain. Add a drink and lunch is closer to $20 for one. Much better value with the wrap at $9 where you get not quite as much chicken, but the dirty work is already done for you - that price does not include a side though.

The chicken itself is outstanding. The ranch that they give you to accompany said chicken is quite possibly life changing. Seriously, do not leave Karved without it. The pita's are fresh. The side dishes I had, roasted potatoes & roasted peppers were good, but didn't really stand out. The rotisserie chicken was definitely the highlight and the reason I'd come back here. I can't say I'd frequent this place since I feel the price is high for the food you get.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,2,2,4,HO2ULAchN2rQCPnMjEJ0vQ

Super refreshing than the restaurants along the strip. Ordered the chicken and beef platter which came with a huge half order of chicken and lots of sliced beef with basmati rice and large pita bread and 2 sides which we got vegetarian black bean and Brussels sprout. Kids were in love with the chicken/beef/rice/pita. But I also loved the veg black beans and sprouts! Honestly that was more than enough to feed a family of 4. Husband ordered chicken rice bowl which came with large chicken breast , black beans marinated onions and Mexican style corn!! Yummie! Also he had hot sauce which was soooo good. We are super picky when it comes to food and I can't say enough about how awesome this place it. They also let us try complimentary chicken and beef soup. My little son loves the chicken soup.

I will check in on Yelp every day if it means I get a daily supply of free pita chips and hummus.

I'm from LA, where parking usually sucks, so an open free parking lot is a blessing.

Service was outstanding. One of the workers came by our table to let me try a couple more sauces with my chicken. (Probably because he discovered I was a prestigious and highly coveted Yelp Elite.) The aji and the hot sauce were both phenomenal.

The chicken and rice were both pretty good, not amazing. But the sides were not that great. I got the brussels sprouts and the roasted peppers and they both were just meh. When I return, I'll experiment with different sides. But the pita chips made up for the actual food. The pita chips could probably even make up for my past regrets and failures.

2650674,2018-06-05,1,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"Wonderful place, there was a need for a gourmet sandwich shop in that area. 

Customer service: When I walked in I was greeted right away. I asked what some of the popular sandwiches were and she named a couple as well as what she personally liked. She also offered me a small sample of the chicken cilantro soup while I waited and it was quite tasty. After a few minutes of eating an employee came up to me asking how everything was which I believe to be the owner who also gave me a sample of their cilantro jalapeño creamy sauce, soooo good. Very good customer service. 

Food: I ordered the Tri Tip sandwich which was the special for the day with fries. It was perfectly made, the proportion of meat to the soft artisan bread was just perfect. The sweet carmelized onions in the sandwich really set it off and some fresh greens. The fries were nicely done, seasoned with rosemary and the fry sauce it came with...just what I love. When I say perfect I mean it. I was also given a little treat of their frozen yogurt with baklava on it and all I have to say is woooooow you could open up a shop just selling that... It had just the right amount of tartness balanced out with the sweetness and texture of the baklava. 

Ambiance: The interior is very clean and tasteful with contemporary wooden tables and industrial style chairs and stools. I sat by the window. The walls have white tiles about three feet high with silver ceiling tiles. The look of a New York style pizza shop or deli but way cleaner haha.

The owner, Paul, was constantly attentive asking how we liked the food how we liked the food. He gave us samples of soups they had and other sauces.  I watched him interact with other patrons, he was a fun and nice guy.

In an already tight parking lot, there will soon be less parking once the majority of Vegas learns about this delicious joint.

Quite possibly the star of the menu is their Porchetta sandwich.  One of the staff (possibly the owner?) walked me through the steps it took to create this flavorful masterpiece.  Totaling a three to four hour process, pork tenderloin is first rolled inside pork belly, then cooked rotisserie-style, and sliced up into juicy, tender pieces.  These are tossed into a fresh, chewy baguette slathered with a lemon caper gremolata spread and some greens.   If that isn't enough, pork cracklins are tossed over the sandwich to add a nice crunch to the mix.  It's just a burst full of flavor and truly makes this one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.

My wife and I also enjoyed the combo Peruvian Chicken and Beef tri-tip combo platter with potatoes, rice, and brussel sprouts on the side.  Three sauces were all sampled and three sauces were well-liked.   Hot, aji verde, and garlic all accentuated the flavors of the meat.   The portions were generous enough to eat for lunch and have saved some left over for dinner.

The staff members were attentive, friendly, and thankful.  Likewise, I am thankful for this small establishment for bringing another fantastic food option here in Las Vegas.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,9,5,5,G_d2Sg42TNDivEQO_qtufA

I also got to try the porchetta, which was basically kind of like chopped up lechon. They have their meat on rotisserie though, so it slowly cooks all day. Most sauces and ingredients are all made in house, which is great because that is the best way to control your quality.

The porchetta sandwich is heavenly. Pork-belly, crispy skin, arugula and 2 amazing sauces all stuffed into a not-to-be outdone pillowy baguette, make up this monster. The lemon spread that they use on the sandwich is amazing. 

The fries, dare I say, are the best fries that I have EVER had, anywhere - I know this is a bold statement, but this is by no means an exaggeration. They are so crispy and have some type of salt and vinegar hint to them - couple that with the fry sauce and it's a home run.

I made a few alterations to my beef and chicken combo - however it did prove to be delicious and keto approved! I ordered the beef and chicken combo with no rice, no pita, and brussel sprouts for my sides (x2). 

As soon as I put a piece of beef tri-tip in my mouth...I knew this was the best lunch decision I could have made for myself today. It was deliciously tender and seasoned to perfection. The chicken was tasty as well. I opted-in for the dark meat option. While not as juicy as the tri-tip, the chicken was still very satisfying. Both meats paired extremely well with the house-made garlic sauce (garlic, lemon, and oil). The brussel sprouts were not my favorite. I have definitely had better. However, the overall food experience I had at Karved was excellent.

I got the rotisserie chicken with roasted potatoes and peppers. The chicken was really juicy and the sides were made perfectly as well. Everything was so fresh and healthy!  I just wish there was one closer to home for me. 

Also, this restaurant is owner run and managed. The customer service and attention to detail was impeccable. The owners' and staff engagement and friendliness is definitely a major plus!! It's so refreshing to see. 

I also had the frozen Greek yogurt with baklava and OMG!!! Delicious! Totally recommend this place.",4ojNN2NSzM46hcDjgg9_dg,3,1,5,4Q-c39AP8LCVSlyIOkNAYg

We did not want to take long for lunch and we also did not want to eat the a chain restaurants. So we decided to stopped at Karved. We recommend this place to everyone. It's off the strip so you will not get stuck in traffic. The food is so delicious and staff are awesome and very friendly. My family order pulled porks and Porchetta. The pork was very tasty lots of flavor. It just melts in your mouth. Karved did not disappoint. My family was very happy!!!

No soda on tap, only bottles- but I loved the infused water they had for everyone. The staff was easily 10/10 on customer service with their friendly nature!

The place is very clean and the menu is a mixture of sides, sandwiches, salads, and wraps. There were six of us and some had the veggie pita which includes a very nicely flavored hummus, perfectly roasted peppers, cherry tomatoes, and the purple middle eastern slaw-like cabbage. Pita bread was good. We also got the side order of brussels sprouts, which is mildly seasoned with pepper and butter, and just right. One had the chicken salad, one the tri-tip salad, one the soup of the day. 
The staff was very welcoming and most helpful with the ordering process. We bought our meals at the counter and the staff delivered them to the table, pretty rapidly. Staff checked on everyone and kept our water refilled too. At the end of the meal, we were given a free sample of the dessert, which is frozen yogurt with bahklava sprinkles on top.

Paid $3 extra for the tri tip which was overcooked. My husband paid $2 extra for chicken and he almost choked on a bone. The soup was bland. We added the lemon that we asked for for our water. They never refilled our water like yesterday. My husband had to get up and ask for it. The girl started to take my food away when I wasn't finished yet. Whatever happened to asking first before reaching over me and putting your hands on my plate? Service was awful. Everyone around us was getting free samples of food or being offered free dessert samples. Not us. And the girl never came back to take my empty plate so we bussed our own table as was the custom I guess. I can't believe I asked the girl yesterday to tell the owner to consider opening one in LA or OC. They can forget it. What an awful experience today.

3388133,2017-12-17,0,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"My company has a booth at the convention center this week and I was put in charge of food for our staff. We've had the typical Chipotle, Panera, Halal Guys, etc. so I wanted to change it up. I turned to trusty Yelp and found Karved, which is close by, does takeout, AND has 5 star reviews!

Karved actually opens at 11am, but I called at 10:52am and they immediately answered my call. I placed a large group order and they had everything ready to go in less than an hour. The food was still warm when we got back to the convention center.

The service here is really great. They got all of our orders right and everyone had utensils. They also threw in some extra sauces for us to try. Because I had a large group order, the guy also helped me carry it out to my car! So nice of them.

The only con is that because they use eco friendly takeout boxes, the boxes get kind of mushy. They actually get bonus points from me for using an eco friendly takeout option, but if you need your box to last through a long day, I suggest asking for an extra box and layering it. 

Most people got the tri-tip platter and some got the salad. Everyone in my group really enjoyed their food. I got the porchetta platter and it was SO GOOD. I added the garlic sauce to it and it was on point. My coworker tried mine and actually said he wish he ordered mine instead. The porchetta also has the most perfectly crispy pieces of pork skin too. The servings of food are huge and will probably take me at least two meals to finish.

Oh, I also saw on the board that they had frozen Greek yogurt with baklava. Amazing. I wish I wasn't doing take out because I DEFINITELY would've gotten this. It's what my dreams are made of.

Whether you need something easy and fast or you want to have a sit down meal, I'd recommend Karved for both!",B95OT0Pkc8PTFm8pCtXq1A,3,2,5,kLNX23VBpWIHvGm1gpXqjQ

This place earns every bit of 5 stars and maybe more for the quality of food that is produced out of such a small location. Sometimes it's not about how much you pay for the product but it is all about the preparation. If people want to be petty we can break down the process and you will see the value in the product. First is the price of the product, ingredients to prepare product, time it takes to prepare product, cost of the employee preparing the product, the cost of the space you are sitting in to eat the product and to top it all off what is the price of not doing dishes.

We were also given some samples of the chicken soup. Not only was it delicious!... But my 6 month old baby was able to have some (it wasn't overpowering with spices). Her first taste of chicken soup! 
Over all the panchetta was good.. Loved the bread, so soft. Next time I'll probably smother a sauce on it. The chicken was good... But what made it amazing was the GARLIC SAUCE. If you like garlic and lemon and maybe even avocado...you will LOVE this sauce.

We needed to try something new and I'm so glad we pondered on to Karved. We were immediately greeted by the whole staff with genuine smiles. We were taking a look at the menu, not sure of what to order when the cashier (didn't get her name but she was the best!) offered us her help.

We ordered a porchetta and tri-tip with a side of pita chips and hummus. My husband bought a soda and I basically took posession of the complimentary cucumber water which was so refreshing!

Let me tell you guys - theeeeee bread on these sandwiches (or whatever they're called) was SO soft and warm, I really wanted to order a side of it alone with the garlic sauce  I tried both sandwiches and they both had a nice punch of distinct flavor. But my favorite was the pita and hummus.

Before this gets too long i just want to say that I really appreciate the service we were provided. The cashier was so sweet and offered us two samples of the soups they had while we were waiting for our food - which didn't take long at all to begin with. We had small checkups with the staff asking how the food was which was a nice touch. Finally when we were about leave, one of the gentleman asked us if we wanted to sample the Greek yogurt with baklava! Everyone was just having a good day today or what!?  I wasn't looking for anything free but just seeing how much they cared about us trying their menu was really inviting. I normally don't tip as high in a casual joint due to the lack of service but with Karved it was well deserved.

Angel explained the menu to us and after a few minutes of looking over it we ordered the half chicken plate with Brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes and the Aji verde sauce that Angel said compliments the chicken well, a French dip sandwich, and Karved fries with fry sauce. 

We sat at a table. Angel brought us samples of the cilantro chicken soup and the spicy beef soup. Both of them were tasty and served piping hot. After a few minutes our main dishes came out. 

The rotisserie chicken was super tasty and juicy and the sauce for dipping was so good. The chicken was served over basmati rice and the potatoes and Brussels sprouts went well with the chicken. The French dip was served on pillowy soft bread and was piled high with juicy tri tip. It was served with horseradish and Au jus on the side. The fries were seasoned well and crispy and the fry sauce was tasty. One of the owners Paul also brought us a side of the garlic sauce which was tasty and complimented everything really well. 

Throughout our meal Paul, Joe, and Angel checked on us to make sure everything was good. They also brought us samples of frozen Greek yogurt which was tangy and refreshing and it was topped with crumbled baklava. It was the perfect bite sized ending to an amazing lunch. 

I can't wait to come back and try more items off of the menu. Karved is fresh, hot, quality food with top notch service to boot. My mouth is currently watering just thinking about the meal I had. Welcome to Las Vegas and please open a Henderson location soon.

3876019,2018-02-09,0,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"Amazing. The rotisserie meat here is as good as advertised. Quite possibly my new favorite sandwich place in Las Vegas. They have something for everyone, including rotisserie plates for the carb-conscious as well as an ""un-karved"" vegetarian pita wrap. 

As I was in the mood for a sandwich, I settled on the beef tri-tip. For $11, the baguette was stuffed with a generous helping of ""karved"" beef. I loved the garlic sauce and onion marmalade. I was also surprised by how soft the baguette was as many places have hard bread that ends up cutting the roof of my mouth. The beef was tender, juicy, and very flavorful. I also ended up getting a side of fries with fry sauce, which came pipping hot. Each meal is accompanied with a small candy bar to end on a sweet note. 

I will definitely be back to try their many other offerings including the porchetta sandwich, eloté corn, and dessert. I'm curious to see how their frozen greek yogurt with baklava crumble stacks up to the baklava ice cream from Meraki.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,9,4,5,ZMazRz4-32ARhJSburgoIQ

4052563,2017-12-13,10,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"Karved Rotisserie Meats - Las Vegas (Maryland Parkway & Flamingo)

There is no denying it, Karved deserves their 5-Star Yelp Review average.  I could have easily given Karved 5-Stars after just one visit, but decided to hold off until I visited them for a 2nd time.  Karved's menu includes chicken, beef, and Porchetta plates & combos straight from their rotisserie, sandwiches, an awesome hot dog, 5 different sides, and small bites including Elote corn on a cob. Karved is perfect if you're craving good tasting food that can be healthy at the same time.  Their meats are locally sourced and carved to order.  I loved everything that I have tasted.  

Listed are my thoughts of each...

*The Beef & Chicken Combo: This meal comes with 2 sides, a bed of rice, pita, and Karved sauce.  The portions are generous, and the Peruvian chicken is so tasty.  This meal is lean and perfect if you're looking to keep it ""clean"". This will be one of my go-to meals when I start cutting the calories. 

*1/4 Pound All Beef Hot Dog: Give me two of these, please. I'm not typically a hot dog type of dude, but will make the exception at Karved.  The hot dog is served in a French roll.  The Karved garlic sauce and hummus give this dog an interesting taste to it.  Karved's Hot Dog is one of the best 1/4 beef hot dogs that I have ever had.  This is one of my favorites.

*Porchetta:  You can get this in a pita or sandwich.  If there's only one item to get here, this is it.  The pork tenderloin is cooked under the rotisserie for 3+ hours, which explains why it's so juicy and packed with flavor.  The crispy pork belly gives it that crunchy texture. Ask for a sample before you decide on it.  Or, just trust me.  The Porchetta alone is worth the visit. 

*Greek Yogurt w/Baklava Crumbs:  Tangy and crunchy at the same time.  The Baklava crumbs is addicting.  It's just too bad that they don't sell Baklava on its own. 

As for service, it really doesn't get any better than Karved.  When I arrived for the 2nd time, the entire staff welcomed me by name.  They either have great memories or they recognize me for my beautiful fork picture. It's all about service at Karved and they go out of their way to ensure that every guest is treated well.  I was on my way to the airport on one of my visits and got my order to-go. When I got to my destination, I noticed a Christmas greeting card inside my bag.  It was addressed to me with a special note from the team at Karved wishing me a great holiday and thanking me for my repeated visit.  Awesome Sauce!!

I look forward to coming back really soon.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,16,14,5,VI7GJ9L8ZYuY_-oYM9xipg

4107015,2017-11-07,5,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"The Goodwich might finally have a challenger for the local sandwich crown.

Karved is a new fast-casual restaurant focused on rotisserie meats and, thus far, a simple menu with sandwiches, plates, sides, and some other items. They're sandwiched (appropriately) between TIABI and Sakana in a fairly small strip mall on Maryland Parkway. 

My eyes lit up when I first saw porchetta on the menu photo. It's not a common if at all available pork preparation in this town (or at least as far as Yelp reviews have cataloged it). After I checked with a friend and received confirmation that it's awesome, I beelined there for lunch, finding the place fortunately (for me) not very busy.

After seeing the rotisserie at work right behind the counter, with Brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes both filling drip trays below the porchetta, I decided that I should go pick one of those as a side. Fearing a potential food coma, I kept it light by picking the Brussels sprouts ($4), which appropriately came out at the same time as the sandwich. I wouldn't outright call them mushy, but they're on the soft side and had no crunch. Also, the portion on this was a bit modest for the price. At least the Brussels sprouts are subtly tasty, likely owing to the porchetta drippings.

The owner was offering sample cups of Cilantro Chicken Soup ($5) while people waited for their orders. After tasting it, I almost had to order one to-go. It's balanced in seasoning and thickness, and the chicken was so tender that you don't even have to hear the owner say that the soup is made fresh daily. Plus, the bowl is quite generously sized.

I did bury the lede a bit, and that's the brilliant Porchetta Sandwich ($12). I was worried that the ""French baguette"" bread would be tough if not outright sharp, but it was simply a delicious and chewy container for the goodness within. That treasure starts with awesome porchetta, including juicy pork loin and the crispy skin of the belly, the latter an unparalleled textural experience. The lemon sauce (with herbs) complements everything perfectly, and the fresh arugula completes the Italian-inspired experience. It doesn't get too messy compared to some sandwiches.

The porchetta alone earns Karved a top rating in my book, and the chicken soup was memorable enough for me to overlook the Brussels sprouts. Hopefully, I'll be free to come back soon to try some of their other options, including that yet-to-be-explored tri-tip.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,16,10,5,oeJY82Q0eMfc-zO0tb6fOQ

4223959,2018-06-21,0,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"I read in a magazine that Karved's garlic sauce rivaled Zankou's. I'm from LA and felt that was too bold a statement to go untested. Granted, I was a tad hungover from the night before and my appetite was a bit wonky but knew my tummy would thank me for some needed sustenance. 

We shared the combo plate and the server gave us all three sauces to try. The chicken was moist and flavorful. And to my surprise, the garlic sauce was PHENOMENAL. Just a small amount packs a punch and, depending on your preference, might even edge out the old LA standby (sorry, Zankou!) because it doesn't linger on your tongue or make you feel like a garlic bomb went off in your mouth or have you fiending after a breath mint after the meal (note: Karved gives you a chocolate mint as part of your meal). The hot sauce also has a kick that I enjoyed. The pitas are high quality and I recommend getting an order of hummus. The pitas come perfectly warm and crispy-soft (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) without being greasy. 

Food aside, I loved the look and feel of the place. From Karved's mission statement, the hand-written menu on butcher paper, the polished metal ceiling, and even the oh-so-cute bathroom, you can tell that each decorative decision was chosen with care. 

I'm hoping to try everything on the menu one day. The service was also top notch and friendly. It's worth the trip off the strip! Trust.",JeXP78PUxcgFexBb_7hdqA,5,4,5,glTeYZOupGK9a7_4dPOydw

The Porchetta sandwich ranks as one of the top sandwiches I've ever had in my life: Perfectly cooked pork, crispy skin, pork belly, and a delicious lemony arugula salad on a perfect mini baguette. It's fantastic and I recommend it to anyone who loves pork and bread. The french fries were crispy and perfectly done. Not too salty or herby either.  Now let's talk about the masterful sauces.

-The fry sauce is tasty. I'm usually a catsup fan but with this sauce, I didn't miss the catsup.

-Hot- It is f*cking hot, but delicious. Not quite a salsa but I'd love it on a taco made with Karved's Tri-tip. The flavor is bomb.

-Garlic- Creamy, garlicky, soothing. Its like horseradish cream with garlic instead. Perfect for beef or chicken. 

The service is kind, quick, and attentive. Everyone wants to make you feel at home and they want you to return. They are all genuine and seem to love being at Karved.

My mother would at least,  once or twice a month order a porketta roast from the local butcher on a Saturday morning on our weekly trip and he would bring out a pork butt, de-bone it, layer on the spices, roll it up, tie it up, and wrap it in butcher paper, write her name on it to be picked up the next Saturday for the Sunday dinner.  I would stare thru the butcher case watching him do his magic, waiting in anticipation for Sunday dinner next week.  Two weeks ago after having a ""meh"" waffle something next door, and upon leaving the waffle place,  my wife pointed out Karved to me.  We walked in and we were met with smiles and truly friendly greetings.  I spoke with this grey haired guy named Shawn with a ball cap,  explained my frustrations about ""porketta"" in the Las Vegas area.  I told him of the porketta I grew up with, he excused himself for about 2 min and then presented me with a ""sample"" of their porketta.  No complaining, but this sample could have fed two hearty souls.  Upon my first taste of the crispy, salty, perfectly spiced pork nuggets, I actually started to cry.  This is the pork that dreams are made of.  I was made whole again with my 8 year old ""me"".  He then gave my wife and I a more than ample sample of their, chicken noodle soup...it was as if my great grandma had just poured me a bowl.

5094747,2017-12-06,27,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"Posit, all great sandwiches (that we want to eat) are unhealthy.  Pastrami, corned beef, brisket, pulled pork,  a burger, italian salumi and porchetta.  Veg?  Sigh, if you must but make sure it's grilled and hammered to death or wilting from the meat fat.

Karved makes one heck of a great sandwich.  Porchetta.  Take a lean pork tenderloin.  Roll it inside a pork belly, it's skin on the outside.  Season heavily.  Rotisserie roast until golden brown, cracklin on the outside,  juicy, and fatty in all the right ways on the inside.  Slice that bad boy up.  Shove it in a fresh baked, chewy, crispy baguette, wilt up some greens, add a generous slathering of herbaceous, lemony, garlicky gremolata.  Heaven.  The crispy pork cracklin adds great texture while the sweetness of the pork is brought out by the bright gremolata.  An outstanding sandwich.  A solid value at $12.

Also available, a rotisserie chicken and tri-tip.  Ordered as a plate, the chicken is as good as any.  The tri-tip, well seasoned, cooked medium, tender, juicy, it's flavor brought to life by the spice heat of an aji verde (Peruvian green chili sauce).  OK roasted Brussels sprouts that could use more char for complexity.  All good, this place is all about the porchetta.

Friendly local service.

While I wouldn't say it's so epic and iconic, ie drive from Centennial great, if you're in the area, a very worthy treat.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,41,35,4,amP4sYuYiGutdTUlHSYVvA

For reference, it's a $6 Uber from the stratosphere area. It's in a strip mall, but you aren't here for the location. Inside is basic and clean and looks nice. I got the porchetta sandwich, pita and hummus as well as brussel sprouts. Every ingredient of the sandwich was fresh made and you could see pork on the rotisserie in the background. It was a perfect balance of crispy and tender and salty at the same time. Bread was fresh and soft with the slightest crunch to its outside. It was probably one of the better sandwiches I have had in any recent memory I have. Portion was great and more than enough for a filling lunch. Brussel sprouts were great to have for a healthy option and were fresh and cooked perfectly in a generous portion. The pita chips were also fresh and better than I could have imagined. Usually chewy, these were almost airy and warm with a texture sort of like one of those mall giant pretzels. Combined with the smooth hummus it was an awesome side. The two girls who helped me were courteous, helpful, attentive and professional. Not much more you can say or ask for from ""counter help."" Oh yea, had a 20oz Diet Coke and that was good too.

The restaurant was very clean and inviting. We were offered a sample of their soup, both the chicken and spicy beef... and they were both outstanding! Served hot, not just warm, but hot which made it feel fresh and homemade.. I regret not getting a to-go container. We had the tri-tip plate, the sandwich, and an order of fries (with drinks) and it was almost 50 bucks.. which was a little pricey for lunch. The tri-tip was excellent, but was served with the garlic sauce that had good flavor but a weird consistency.. kinda like crisco cooking stuff... so it was weird to dip tri tip in the sauce. The fries were seasoned well, and they came with fry sauce that was tasty too! After we finished our meal the staff even offered us samples of the baklava and Greek frozen yogurt, which you could tell was homemade, fresh, and tasty!

I ordered the beef and dark meat chicken combo plate with Brussels sprouts and bell peppers as my sides. The staff member recommended I try garlic as my sauce since it's their most popular. Oh man, that garlic sauce was addicting. I slathered it on everything - the meat, the rice, the pita. I would've slathered that sauce on a piece of cake, it was that good. The chicken was so juicy and the seasoning on it was spot on. The tri-tip was tender but just a bit dry for my liking. Nothing that garlic sauce couldn't fix, though. The veggies were cooked on the soft side, which is how I like them. They added the perfect balance with the meat and rice. 

Also, when I ordered, I was given a free sample of their chicken cilantro soup. The broth on that soup had some really well-developed flavors. There were hearty chunks of chicken and veggies in every spoonful. I would've ordered a bowl of it had it been a colder day. It would've definitely warmed me up.

5876175,2017-12-18,16,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"Well hot diggty, ro-rotisserie. Karved has carved a special place in my heart and belly. 

I've been eyeballing this place for awhile and am stoked to see it's doors are finally open. I'm especially thrilled because this spot is only a few minutes up the road from my pad. I'll be here often. 

It's in the Target shopping center off Maryland Parkway, facing the street. The parking lot is small, but even on a Sunday afternoon, there were plenty of spots. The venue has a fresh decor with butcher paper menus that are easy to change and a counter that greets you instantly. It's a similar layout to a Subway, without the build it as you go implications.

The menu is mouthwatering. I shared the  ¼ lb All Beef Hot Dog with my roomate, sans the hummus. Super Mediterranean feel and loving that fresh french roll. The garlic sauce is too cool for school. Delicious. I enjoyed the Karved Roasted Chicken Pita all to myself. I may see if I can add or swap the creamy herb dressing with the garlic next time. It's that good.

The soup that day was the Cilantro Chicken. I partook in the sample she offered me and had I not already made plans to make soup in the crockpot that night, I totally would have ordered a tub of it to-go.

5893977,2018-02-19,0,cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ,"First off, the service was excellent! They went above and beyond and let me taste a side dish and a sauce I was not sure I'd like.  While we were eating, the chef came out and made his rounds. I could tell every member of staff really cared and wanted to make sure you had a great experience.

I felt like the food was decent. I had the 1/4 rotisserie chicken plate with black beans and roasted peppers. The chicken was good, except he wing was too toasted? Roasted? Rotisseried? (i.e. very dark skin) but still the breast wasn't dry. The beans were amazing. I'm guessing they are cooked from scratch and not out of a can because their texture was perfect. The bell peppers were pretty simple, but a little too oily without the char I was expecting from their ""roasted pepper"" name.

 My fiance got the tri-tip medium rare with brussel sprouts and potatoes. Both of his sides were excellent and that's saying a lot because it's very rare for me to find brussel sprouts that I think aren't over cooked and over seasoned! The tri-tip was tasty but definitely not medium rare, more like medium well (It had the tiniest amount of pink. At first glance, it looked like it was cooked well done.)

Oh and you also get a sauce. The garlic sauce was tasty. It reminded me of a good garlic aioli. The verde sauce was just ok in my book. It was creamy, not the traditional salsa verde I really like; however, my fiance really enjoyed it. (It kinda reminded me of a sauce you'd get at a Chipotle which isn't what I want from a salsa.) I thought the food shined on it's open and didn't use much of either sauce.

I don't think I'll be back because it was a pricy for us. Two plates and two drinks with tip was about $40 for lunch. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not the amazing I'd want for that price.  If you're not on a budget and looking for some high-quality ingredients cooked pretty well, I'd say this is the place for you!

Edited to add: Servings were generous, I believe had enough that I had to take leftovers home. They do have less expensive options such as bowls and sandwiches.",LF8irDgdWsNuxvLFh8cmzw,1,0,3,G0LZizNujYb0utwrzbT23g
