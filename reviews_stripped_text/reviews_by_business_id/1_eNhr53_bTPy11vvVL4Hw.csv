I had lechon asado with congri and side salad and plantano maduro for 7.00.. plus I had mamey batido which was perfect to taste not too sweet and chilled. Plus my company had cuban sandwich and other completas like pollo frito and picadillo with white rice and black beans. They said is delicious as well.. I had to travel from North town which is quite a distance but worth the travel for a delicious hearty meal.,2hbN1uDDPnsJkgWXWgAjSw,2,1,5,PtdFFEQq4orqTv4htHn7UQ

851593,2016-01-28,1,1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw,"Actually, it's 4 stars at best. However, Vegas needs more places like this and I'm grading on a sliding scale that incorporates the fact that this is a hole in the wall. 

Prices: Fantastic (likely to go up a little in the future I would guess)

Tamales were a dollar a piece. A full plate of food was $7. That came with a meat, a rice side (white rice and black beans or them mixed together), choice of starch: fried plantain (sweet chunks or thin, savory chips) or mojo de yucca (tender yucca in oil and onion), and a tiny salad dressed nicely with avocado. Yes, that's FOUR items for 7 bucks. The sammys were 6 to 7 bucks and come with fries which they would sub in another starch side upon request.

Food: Great all the way down to bad.

The sides are awesome here. If you have had Cuban food before and get dizzy with excitement thinking of the beans and rice or fried plantains, you are going to be stoked. My Cuban sandwich was also pretty good. I thought the tamales were a little sweet but my wife loved them. Think steamed corn bread. My wife didn't love her steak and my mom's pork was DRY beyond excuse. Really dry and bad and should not have been served. My advice to the owners would be to not do that. If you know it's old and bad, just say you're out. In the long run, it will pay off. There's something to be said about slow roasting for hours, but you don't wanna cold rest it for days. It may have been an off night though. Also, like my wife mentioned, what do you want for $7 really?

Place:

Shopping mall, hole in the wall that is literally family-run. You got the son taking orders, the sister bringing out the food, and the mom asking if it was good. Could be cousins and aunts or something, but you get the idea. 

I don't live in Vegas anymore, and I don't know when I'll be back. However, I hope this place has a long life in Vegas. We need more places like this. Even though we have awesome Mexican food (I'm looking at you D-bag who said Mexican food was disgusting), we could use a little more variety in Latin food.",CmVCiP6w3ULcbwk83TvVEA,2,2,5,6cyEGuPD1PYT8eEV1HePeQ

I had to order a side order of crispy tostones and tamales with roasts onions on top. I judge a place based on the food first and foremost. I would expect to pay triple what I paid if it was in a foo foo frilly restaurant.  But this place is a classic family run small restaurant.  You order at the register they bring it out.  The black beans were awesome.  Perfectly spiced and great over the rice.  If you are up to food adventures this place is great. They even had a fruit drink called Mameya that was made fresh to order.  It's a fruit I have never had and I have tried tons before.

Only reason we went was because all this great reviews that I doubt are true, this must be friends and family of the restaurant because no one in their right mind would consider this dog food edible. Sure enough a few hours after we got home I was violently sick! Sorry to be graphic but this ""amazing food"" was coming out of both sides.

We ordered garlic sauce but recieved a mixure of saut√©ed apples, onions and garlic in a cup. The salad we got looked like what you would receive as sides for a hamburg.
