The onion rings were big, crispy, and tasty! The service was wonderful! There were only about 3 people there though. There was music playing the entire time! My daughter had so much fun playing Johnny Cash on the Jukebox! There was a HUGE selection of Oldies. We didn't try the table jukeboxes, so not sure if they worked or not!

249937,2011-09-22,1,Ej_5JlAQ2He6NBu_PSygGA,"I would like to say I love this place, but I can't. I love diners. I love the 50's theme and the music. But this diner is in need of help. I have been to Shari's 4-5 times since moving to Vegas from the Chicago area. Each time we've been, we find something else we don't like. So the last time we ate there was *the* last time and we won't be going back. The food is hit or miss. I've had under cooked burgers, where they put the burger back on the grill and then slapped back on the toppings and gave it back to me. Some of the toppings were gone and the burger was still under cooked. Since when don't you get a new burger cooked for you and not picked apart and then recooked? Our final time there, we noticed a huge change in the taste of the burgers. The burger itself was flavorless. Possibly frozen variety. If you are going to be a burger joint you need to have fresh ingredients and the burger needs to be seasoned. I have noticed that while driving by Shari's (on many occasions), the parking lot is usually empty. Maybe this has something to do with the change in burger taste. You cannot keep fresh ingredients around if no one is eating them. Another point that needs to be brought up is the lack of cleaning and maintenance to the restaurant. Duct taped booths are really showing wear. The floor is in great need of a power cleaning. And we find that the  tattered napkins with comments to be overly tacky. With all the other great memorobilia there, the napkins are an eye-sore. I've met the owner, Shari, and she is super nice. Same for her daughter. Shari's husband could due with cracking a smile once in a while at the customers though. The prices charged do not match the quality of the  food. And every time we've been there we have been one of the only tables there! Weekday and weekend.
There is a show on Food Network called 'Restaurant:Impossible' and every time we see that show we think of Shari's Diner. It needs a overhaul.  Fix the booths, buff the floor, take down the tacky napkins. Reduce your menu to a managable amount of dishes to reflect the lack of business so you're not loosing money on costs. Serve quality burgers and the people will come, even those who have said they won't return.",fvwfNKeyxUdUeCyGnuH-Iw,3,0,2,MQdVPiixjSA4AZLs-7KoYg

471874,2010-12-27,0,Ej_5JlAQ2He6NBu_PSygGA,"I'm from the northeast US and have spent a large part of my life enjoying Jersey diners.  Upon entrance to Shari's Rock & Roll Diner, it felt very close to a small, trailer-sized version of a diner from back home.  Some notable differences, however, include some high energy old school rock music and the smallest rotating glass dessert rack I've ever seen (in my mind a diner is not a diner without at least 20+ types of desserts rotating in mesmerizing circles). 

Overall I had a fairly good experience here. The wait staff was very nice and quick, and the atmosphere was lovely for a Sunday afternoon. The food itself was pretty good (I'd give them 4-stars based solely on my enjoyment of the food) and moderate portions - this doesn't bother me because I don't enjoy encouraging wastefulness, but it is something that would keep it off my list as a true ""diner.""  I enjoyed the rolls and the homemade potato chips, although both were a little over the top with the grease thing. For the potato chips they seemed greasy because they had probably been fried at a slightly cooler temperature than they should've been.  The veggie burger, however, was really excellent.  It tasted homemade and fresh, and I enjoyed all of the color in the toppings.

Consequently, I would recommend this place to anyone who doesn't really feel like playing the restaurant game but would like a nice, quick, and reasonably-priced meal.",oG6zUYCWKUy46G6foXnMdA,3,1,3,4tLYDKSOIKXF2wIk6C2zWQ

Unfortunately the service is awful, the food is mediocre (at best!) and the prices are absurd for what you get. $9 for a country fried steak and two eggs?! $8.25 for a bleu cheese burger - and by bleu cheese, they mean liquidy, running fluid that looks like bull semen. Yuck.

The only plus is the $0.25 jukebox with classic 50's and 60's rock music.

In reno our 50's diner was taken over by a middle eastern owner who insisted on replacing burgers with falafal so finding Sharis which is a hop and skip down the street from us was like divine intervention lol. Theyre 4.95 burger specials hit the spot and always taste good. Last time I had a flamingo, which is cherry 7up with true vanilla ice cream. This is a great place for kids because it is quiet and the older crowd typically fawn over lucy. She can have the whole bench to herself and rock out to classic tunes from the juke box. Last time my wife took our daughter theyre she got a cool oreo milk cup.
My only complaints are they close to early on Sundays and the owners I love Jesus and other godly things scattered about on the walls and shirts of the employees as well as the church day they have kinda cramp my style. Now Im buddhist, so really everyone should be able to practice they're faith as they so choose however I do like it forced upon me at a public eating establishment.

Well when I walked in I just loved the decor!  James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, and Natalie Woods.  More to mention.....  soooo 50's!

Now, the waitress was nice, but I didn't say attentive!  There weren't very many tables she had to wait on (two to be exact), so I expected full attention.  

I was very indecisive as usual, being a newbie.  I asked her what her favorite was, she replied "" well it depends what you like"".  What the heck kind of answer is that?  So I figured that she didn't like the food there where she worked.  

I was hungary, but  discouraged after her comment ( so no food for me).  Anyhow, I ended up ordering a Brownie sundae.  The brownie was perfect! The ice cream was great.  There wasn't enough hot fudge for me so asked the waitress for some more, and she replied "" ok, but its in a package, but I'll get it anyway.""  I really didn't give a filth farn filth how the hot fudge was packaged.

Decor is of course the cute 50's style, and they had an old fashioned juke box! I LOVE those things. They also had a ""dj"" taking requests for music on the jukebox..
The place is a little jesusy, but whatever. I don't really mind jesus bumper stickers on the wall next to pics of James Dean. Weird, but ok. Just have to make sure I don't come here on Worship Friday, I'd lose my mind.
Our waitress was sweet, and very attentive, keeping our drinks full and taking our order promptly. 
Menu consists of massive burgers, sandwiches, a small collection of dinner plates, soups and salad, some fried appetizers, desserts, and breakfasts. They also have a little smaller plate menu for those who don't want to get massive portions. 
We both tried the bleu cheese burger and fries. He got regular fries, I grabbed the seasoned. Also had the fried green beans.
Fried green beans: These weren't that great. The batter they fried it in could have used a little more seasoning.
The burgers, however, were delicious. They were HUGE, and loaded with the veggies. It wasn't the BEST burger I've ever had, but it was pretty damn good. Juicy and loaded up with toppings, just like I like them. Probably will get the small plate burger next time, because I just could NOT finish this beast.

First of all, for those of you who like the decor, credit goes to 5 and Diner, the failed chain of a few years ago.  Shari's is at least the second post-5&D establishment in that building.  (You lose track, they come and go so quickly.)  it's close to our house so we'd always planned to stop in for breakfast, and this morning we did.  First of all, there hasn't been any redecorating since the 5&D days.  Oh, except that there are now little scraps of paper on just about every exposed wall.  Little notes from people who liked the food or whatever--I didn't look too close.  It was lovely, though, and by lovely I mean cluttered.  There is a heavy Christian vibe to the place, and our waitress was wearing a Jews for Jesus t-shirt (whatever that means).  Food-wise, I had the hash with fried eggs and hash browns, and my wife had pancakes, eggs and bacon.  On the menu, my hash was called ""Chicago Mike's Hash,"" but I'm pretty sure it was canned.  It had the little cubed potatoes and mushy corned beef just like Hormel.  (If that's true--that they made the hash sound special by putting someone's name in front of it, but in reality it's canned--how incredibly bogus is that?)  The rest of the food was just run-in-the-mill.   I did wonder why my toast had some unmelted butter on it and I soon learned why.  Our waitress, who disappeared for a while (bathroom?), returned to the prep area where she proceeded to slather butter on several pieces of toast that had been pulled out of the toaster a good five minutes earlier so someone else could use the toaster.

1. In my eyes, you are not truly a diner if you're not open 24 hours, and Shari's isn't even open late.

2. The place is a kitschy 50's style diner, and I'm not 12.

Nonetheless, my girlfriend was in the mood for some pancakes, and this place is so close, we decided to give it a try.  It was WORSE than I thought as far as ambiance.  We showed up on some sort of special night, and they had a DJ that was taking requests for oldies music.  Why do I know this?  Because the creepy owner came over to our table and awkwardly told us so.  On top of that, there are obvious religious ties to this restaurant, and I'd prefer my food without being preached to.

As for the food, it was delicious, though.  The pancake was one of the best pancakes I've ever had, and I don't even like pancakes all that much.  We also shared some eggs, hash browns, and biscuits and gravy.  All were really good, and our entire meal came out to just over $10.

If I find myself in the mood for breakfast food and it's early enough, I'll go to the Bagel Cafe.  If I don't mind a drive, I'll go to Blueberry Hill.  If neither of those things work, then I guess I'll be back at Shari's.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,6,4,3,dXz1HemolBX5PXNoKFwQOQ

We were featured twice on Shari's new website and I just got in some really cool mini business cards from Food Buzz  show my blog & me as a featured publisher of Food Buzz, so I thought we had better revisit this place and see what's changed. 
We decided to go for a late lunch about 1 pm on Sunday afternoon, we had just finished what we hope to be the last of the Christmas shopping. Well we seated ourselves because there was nobody and I mean nobody around. The place was DEAD!!. There was an older man who could have passed for homeless sitting off in the corner by the restrooms. After a few minutes we were given menus and ordered drinks. Last time here they had just opened and had paper menus so now to see a real menu was nice. We wanted to order an appetizer since the kid usually fills up on it and doesn't want a whole meal. Again they had NO Green Fried Tomatoes-If you are gonna offer them on the menu you should probably have a source of green tomatoes, like maybe home grown hydroponic or a vendor. So things started somewhat poorly.
I then asked if they had the Sweet potato fries w/ powdered sugar and she said yes-Isaw her write something down and then I ordered myself a Lola Special-Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich, a Happy Face Pancake for the boy, and a Sandi Melt for the wife.
While we waited for the food we took advantaged of the 2 for $0.25 jukebox filled with 50's classic rock music.
The food came out with NO appetizer-she must have forgot and I never got a chance to ask before she went away. Well the wife was extremely disturbed that the side of sweet potato fries she ordered came dusted in powdered sugar because that's NOT what she ordered nor was she informed they were served that way. The patty melt was good but the cheese wasn't quite melted. The pancake had whipped cream on it where the eyes & nose go, so the kid cried about that but was fine once it was covered in syrup. The bacon was good & crispy but small like 1 piece broken in 2.
The chicken teriyaki sandwich was great-grilled perfectly-tender & juicy but cooked. The teriyaki sauce was tangy & spicy and the onion rings/pineapple tings with the Hawaiian sweet roll bun was the perfect mix. A very filling sandwich. The fries were hot & crispy too. 

Overall the food was pretty good minus the powdered sugar , but this time around the service was a little lackluster. Halfway through our meal another couple with some kids arrived -they were the only ones there besides us. They were seated near us in a table that had syrup on it and had not been wiped down. I did notice the seats are a little grungy and some have been torn and duct taped up. The place was like a ghost town.

The burgers are huge, greasy and to die for. I've never had a better Western burger, ever. I'd love to figure out how to eat more than a third of it at a time, but after inhaling a chocolate malted and a side of their homemade chips, I'm pretty much done. They actually have a feta burger (with bacon and fresh spinach, no less!) with a respectable amount of cheese on it. I'm dying to try the Ortega chile burger (next time?), with pepper jack and chiles on sourdough.

I don't care about the decor or the so-called Christian vibe (which I haven't really noticed). In fact, I find the whole 50's thing sort of annoying. I'm here for the food!

Other than the waffles, stick to Dennys.",tt388DQMt1hhvnmyLbwvNA,1,0,3,S86sqxLwIO_N5KfVg85r0A

We visited on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed breakfast items as well as lunch. Portion size is wonderful but a little on the expensive side. The onion rings are really delisious. Now those were beer battered onion rings.....Staff was really friendly and it was nice to see the owner's greeting and talking with us during our visit......",LcEzdKpV54R-BrDhPysY5A,0,0,4,8gXyuXoYsSjl525Hk1nZ8A

The menu has variety of goods from breakfast to burgers. I took on Breakfast and it was delicious and big (classic american breakfast).  Prices are very reasonable for the food. Its a little far from where I live but if I am around the neighborhood again, I am hitting it up again.  I give 4 stars for right now until i try one of their brugers or something other than their good breakfast.",29DWe8SD_RCeZ_A6ihxnhQ,1,1,4,5IPYzxvFqq1392PsGQMYfA
