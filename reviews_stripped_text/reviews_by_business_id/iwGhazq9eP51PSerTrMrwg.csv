I spend some time there and met some very friendly people while I had a few beers. I will be visiting this local bar & grill again in the future. You won't be disappointed by visiting this local bar in an excellent location on the east side of town.,GsV1pLOMaCqmEyO6XB2CEA,3,2,5,vZrYL09PyYn66_c5qaUfFA

Wings were good but took forever to come out and on the bar side the bartender was to busy smoking and socializing to even ask for anything. They had a server who was doubling as the delivery driver so she was not even really there and not to mention everything was watered down like the ranch and hot sauce. Junk junk junk. A visit from Bar rescue wouldn't even help...",HRltLS95ivBF1kXxerO2rw,0,0,1,E8q8TSiLt5-kzyScTGOqcA

1576937,2015-12-06,6,iwGhazq9eP51PSerTrMrwg,"Used Mr G's as a rally point prior to carb up prior to heading to complete the remainder of the River Mountain Loop Trail.  I met up with Zac M. at the bar.  The bartender Ron was about as friendly as a bartender can be.  Granted we were the only ones inside the joint on a Sunday at 8:00 in the morning.  

I have been inside the particular suite under different names several times of the past decade.  Under the name of Mr. G's, it's the cleanest and most pleasant smelling I have ever experienced.  There was no smokey smell.  There was also no stall smell of a spilt beer or any other alcoholic beverage for that matter.  This includes the bathroom of which I also found unusually clean for such an establishment.

Ron was on point with coffee and beer.  We were carb loading after all. I thought the beer selection was slightly limited for my wanna-be liquid bread palate.  Ron was full of stories about the pub and tales of old Vegas.

Reggie our cook tucked away in the back somewhere was as affable as Ron.  He produced a simply glorious breakfast for Zack M and myself.  I had a breakfast quesadilla which was hearty and absolutely helped propel for my adventure to come.

MGP&G has a great staff, great food, good & cold beer, gaming, pool tables, and a safe environment.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,6,7,4,NEe6rztZQGkgUQYteR5wuw
1659113,2016-07-24,0,iwGhazq9eP51PSerTrMrwg,"Very good experience here. We live close by but never before had checked it out. Had heard good things about the food and decided on a test run. I tried a simple cheese pizza; it was excellent, a huge step up from what you get at a place like Dominos or Pizza Hut (not to disparage these two in particular). My wife had a simple BLT and it too was better than just good. The accompanying fries were excellent (I ate half of hers!) 

Service was excellent, and prices very reasonable. More than reasonable for my draft beer. $2 for a 16 oz. beer?  When was the last time I saw that, outside of some special during an NFL game in a casino sports book? Long ago! 

Yes, this place is a hidden gem. I just hope it stays in business. The shelf life of places that serve decent pub grub at these kind of prices, in Las Vegas, is woefully brief.",7xXgHmJrYK7xJxIVHFVmNw,0,1,5,1BU_tY9pKL18nwyrHzFh-Q

2081104,2018-03-07,0,iwGhazq9eP51PSerTrMrwg,"My sister, me, and my fiance went here tonight, and it was my sister's second visit, and mine and my fiance' s third visit, and we've never been so put out and disgusted in our lives. First the so called bartende took forever to come over and take our drink order, then she had an attitude,  then we told her that we wanted to place a food order, and she didn't let the kitchen know jack about us. She took my sister's driver's license and was supposed to get her a Mr. G's card like I had, but she took forever on a slow ass night to return my sister's driver's license and then proceeded to give her the bullshit excuse that she had problems with her license,  and they were out of cards, so it took almost an hour, on a slow night to tell anyone that? Bullshit! She then supposedly had the manager's wife hand my fiance his soda, and that was bull, because she was getting sloshed at the bar with the other customers,  some manager's wife. The later we were told that there was no water in the restrooms ( major health code violation) which nothing was posted about, and then my sister was told that she had to have a certain drink limit before they could charge her card, and nowhere was this posted, so yet another violation. The only pleasant experience was our server and the food, which both were great, but the so call bar and bartender on Monday-Wednesday nights needs a overhaul. I recommend people come on Thursday-Sunday nights when the bartender Stevie is working. This night was a total let down, and we were so excited about going here again.",mBpPuuktCtkleFm5yQBoxg,0,0,1,fSAUY9JVE_-lttOfMop07A

I hand my drivers license to the older bartender and he takes a quick look at my ID. To my amazement he literally throws the I'd back at me and says "" no out of state ID's"" . I've signed up for a player card at numerous pubs in the area without issue. I told him without a player card I'd just leave and he would lose my business. He didn't seem to care.

I left with my $500.00 bankroll. Great way to run a business pal. No wonder it was empty.",QusE6oEezkcqRpzVHGEHSQ,0,0,1,LQuquSHQiPcjvin5IJMVhQ
3130227,2015-07-02,0,iwGhazq9eP51PSerTrMrwg,"Mr G's Pub and Grub is the quintessential neighborhood gaming bar with above average food. As soon as you walk in you experience a friendly greeting and sense of community. The patrons are locals who welcome you as family. There are 15 machines for you to try to buck the odds and leave with more cash than you walked in with. There were only a couple to chose from when I arrived. The beer is cold and atmosphere positive.

There are comfortable bar stools and booths if you so desire. The 70's decor bleeds through the modern decoration. Several flat screen tv's are positioned so that wherever you sit you can watch what interests you. There are two Diamond pool tables positioned with plenty of room to operate and not far from the bar which keeps it intimate. 

The attentive bartenders keep the libations fresh and full as time is quickly consumed by great conversation of various bar topics. Politics, sports, or recent events, you will leave with more information than you came in with.

The bathrooms are some of the cleanest I've experienced compared to other bars located through this particular band of town. 

There are two smoke eaters that attempt to keep the nicotine at bay however there needs to be a third. I do not smoke and would find it more pleasurable if there was one more to consume the perpetual cloud of smoke. Nonetheless the ventilation provides tolerable air quality. 

Overall this bar is an unexpected gem and pleasant surprise in this area. I have made it one of my top 5 watering holes as a result of many positive experiences I've had through multiple visits. If you want a positive, old school bar experience, swing by. I've always felt comfortable and welcome every time  I've walked through the door.",0IYUEBzQR8CjdWEaFUlOSw,4,2,4,0Fq8hEOCgQ0iqo4-WSjHaA

After picking up my food I decided to stop by the bar. The bartender (who's name I don't know because he never said anything) was busy helping a guy that just walked in. After making his drinks and speaking to the other two guests he sits down and continues his conversation. 

10 minutes and 40 bucks later, no drink, no approach, no service. And that's the extent of my review because I can't even describe anything of substance. In fact the guy was rude to the one guy he was talking to. Oh well never again.",C5Qn-hpdAfMbi4HxWeBZhQ,1,0,1,3VQD-z7JjVrK-dvQsXt6Bg
