You can't go wrong with Italian or Turkey, since they're pretty standard for subs. I don't know why, but they taste so much better than subway. One thing I do know is that unlike subway or quiznos, they give you lots of meat instead of packing it with tons of lettuce! I've tried the Bobbie, and it's like a Thanksgiving meal packed into a sandwich. It's a hate it- or - love it kinda deal. It wasn't bad, but I'll stick with the Italian.

Also, for $13 you get TWENTY INCHES. Yea, 20 inches.

I ain't never goin back to subways after this.",cw1cO7zGarYJmIkdGdNdEg,1,0,5,lPgM9HQxJUKYVjnstZCCuA

My boyfriend and I called in a simple order for pick up, one cran-slam and one Bobbie both medium size on white bread .. Pretty straight forward order, at least we thought so . After being told it would be a thirty minute wait for our sandwiches to be ready we ran an errand or two and headed to pick up our food. Once inside we could already sense exactly how this would eventually play out . After waiting 5-7 minutes in line, apparently our sandwiches weren't finished yet. We paid for our food and sat and waited, and waited and waited .. 12:20 is when we called in our order and it was 1:15 by the time we were handed over ""what we had ordered"" we couldn't have been more disappointed . The order was completely wrong and ""Tiffany"" I believe, began to tell my boyfriend that he was wrong. Completely ridiculous. She should practice listening more over a phone call instead of interrupting during an order. My boyfriend repeated himself multiple times and to no avail. Good job, Tiff. The only positive thing that came out of our hour wait was the help of the manager Joseph. He refunded us for our sandwiches and apologized for the inconvenience. We wasted an entire hour, left with no sandwiches and proceeded to my first choice of Jersey Mikes ..

I've tried ""the bobbie"" in the past. It is with their homemade turkey, cranberry sauce & stuffing. Not a fave of mine, but it is definitely something different and full of yummy thanksgiving flavor anytime of the year. 

I got a small genoa salami ($6) today and it was HUGE. I couldn't even eat it all and still have half of it waiting in the fridge. All the subs come with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and choice of sweet or hot peppers, mayo, oil, etc. They don't have a lot of choices in toppings, but pretty much the basics, which is just fine with me!

The bread is freshly made in house and they are not shy or stingy when it comes to piling on the meat (unlike subway!). After a couple of bites into my sandwich, the fillings were oozing out and couldn't keep up with the bread! By the last bite, I had a little piece of bread with majority of it being meat and lettuce.

We ordered a medium capastrami sandwich and a medium hot Italian sausage sandwich and they were bigger than what I expected.  Both of them tasted pretty great and I especially liked capastrami.  The only thing is that I was under an assumption that there will be some veggies come as a base for all sandwiches (maybe because I am more familiar with subway style sandwiches) and I did not know if I needed to specially ask to add anything.  Even though I liked my italian sausage sandwiches, it was little too meaty for me since there was no veggies but just sausage and cheese.  I think it would have been perfect for those who just wanted this types of sandwiches, but personally, I prefer some veggies to add crunchiness and freshness.

I tried 3 kinds of the most popular sandwich, The Bobbie, Capastrami and Slaw Bejo. I have only one word to describe the food, ""disappointing."" Although sandwiches are not my favorite type of food, I know how a good sandwich should taste like. The picture of The Bobbie look much better than the real thing, and the ingredients was very imbalanced. The turkey and the stuffing was dry, cranberry wasn't cranberry but a mush of sugar and overall a sub par sandwich. Then I sampled the Capastrami. This was probably the best out of the three. The hot pastrami was not as juicy as a Langer's sandwich but has their own distinct flavor. However, the sweetness of the cole slaw overpowered the meat, leaving you tasting only the cold, tough bread. On the whole, there was noting special.  The worst one was the Slaw Bejo which has no flavor and the roast beef just taste like bland, uncooked meat. That was the worst sandwich I have had for a while.

I knew it was really really good because she didn't make any noise. SHe was too busy enjoying the Capastrami to think about sharing. So i had a bite and it was truly the best Pastrami.

Very good and wholesome sandwiches.  I came here by accident wanting some Greek food.  This place serves good NYC style heros.  I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a big sandwich.  The pastrami is a little salty but I would kill that with mustard.  The sandwiches are big that you won't even finish it all.  I wouldn't recommend the CLAM CHOWDER.  It's more of a potato chowdaaahh.  It's right off Blue Diamond.  It's good if you are into sammiches.

The Capastrami comprises of hot pastrami in a roll with cole slaw, swis cheese, and Russian dressing. I added cucumbers and tomatoes to add extra health value to it. Ultimately, the sandwich was oversauced. I could not taste the pastrami at all and I felt a little sick afterwards.

One of my other friends ordered the ""Bobbi"" sandwich which consisted of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce to give it the Thanksgiving theme. The sandwich was way too heavy for the quarter portion that I had. One of my other buddies told me that the Italian sandwich was good so maybe I should have gotten that.

Everything is made to order.  Most of their sandwiches come in three sizes - small 9"", medium 12"", or a large 20"".  They offer a bunch of different sandwiches in different categories, such as Cap's specials, cold subs, hot stuff, and vegetarian.  I love their cheese steak sandwich.  I order mushrooms with it too and it tastes amazing.  I get the medium size and usually I can only finish half of it because I can't finish the rest, which is alright because I have something to eat if I get hungry on the ride back.

For sandwiches, you can order brown bread.  Unfortunately, they don't have brown bread for their subs.

Take out is probably the best.  Washed our sandwiches and subs down with Sweet Ice Tea.  

If you ever stayed down in the south end of the strip by Southpointe, they would deliver as well.",EsOu51dW3UTDJTApBxwz2g,0,0,5,3eS2JGEETkukSVS3Nk_Vcg

As it is 'take out', no bathroom - not a big deal but inconvenient if traveling like we were.  Convenience store next door.",_9_NhKblrSG0k3A_2yULeA,0,0,3,PYopTZMQ2CmfNzWAeBMX5A

I usually grab their signature subs.  The bobbie and the capastrami are my two favorites.  Great staff and great prices.  Even if you're not a sub-type guy or gal, they have plenty of sandwiches to choose from -- freshly made every time.  If you live in vegas and havent tried capriotti's.. SHAME ON YOU!",7cgRyPQGjcxFz631A39AmQ,0,0,5,wCafYrKdArJpMLoMyAs7Yg

I mean, must make other sandwich shops feel inadequate. How are any of these other joints supposed to compete when $7 will get you nine fantastic inches of OFFICIAL cheesesteak. $13 will get you 20 inches. That's a lot of sandwich.

And the Capastrami ain't bad either. I have to admit that I've had better pastrami, but I lived three blocks from Katz's for years, so I'm spoiled. However, I do love the flavor combination.

The bread, the steak, the smiles, and the value here all justify the enormous wall of awards Capriotti's absolutely deserves.",ITa3vh5ERI90G_WP4SmGUQ,9,7,4,GfVQVEpznjjBiVrTzuoKFw

Great sandwiches when they're made correctly, but I won't be coming back to this location.",BioAFnx1elzi8DLq_Zra3w,0,0,2,qon6I-kH3oT40yLocgfeUA

Super friendly staff and the food was great I had the capastrami and the only issue was the  12"" is a filling sandwich.  The toppings where fresh and delicious the bread was great fresh and delicious. My wife had the 1/2 sandwich and salad enjoyed every bite and was also quite full
I recommend giving it a try",TXya9OEuxtQ1QLmLUqslTQ,0,0,5,G5zxbGD8whOHUwwkfq8d5w
