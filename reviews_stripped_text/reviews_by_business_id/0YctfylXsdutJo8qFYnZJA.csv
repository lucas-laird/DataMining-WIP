I miss the Kareokee Friday's and the loud crazy people that use to infest this place.  If the owner looks at this,  make some changes back to the old ways!!!!!",FYQQOrGtVhuScLt4Nq86NQ,1,1,2,qGADvXunYJMxhmRz8nxuBQ

1170766,2013-07-15,0,0YctfylXsdutJo8qFYnZJA,"Nice little dive bar. They offer free pool, too- But if you're a regular they take a $10 donation for felt, cues, chalk, etc. That's fine with me, it's way cheaper and less crowded than PTS and the bartenders are quite a bit friendlier.

$3 PBR pints.

They also have a kitchen and booth/table seating. I haven't eaten here yet but saw the food and it looks A-OK.

It's right around the corner from my house, maybe I'll see you around!",Gu-rR-zYcWo3mPPkUHXUrA,1,0,3,zXtP8QVvR5IXURCVoH8GJw

The staff was really nice but not what I was expecting to pay for the location and a bar with an average beer selection.

1803847,2018-01-22,0,0YctfylXsdutJo8qFYnZJA,"Tried to give this place money. They wouldn't take it. Apparently if you want to purchase food from them ""to go"" after 9pm you have to waste your time by coming in ..ordering in person .. and waiting there until they cook it. because they won't take phone orders. Which is the exact OPPOSITE of to go. Since they don't want the money I'll give it to nearby competitor instead. No big deal.",7ZLmLJsRefsct_EE8Mn1tg,0,0,1,1uaMYJt3_BH-NNhF5_u0IA

2171018,2014-12-22,0,0YctfylXsdutJo8qFYnZJA,"My friend and I walked in, not knowing anything about this place. We weren't greeted nor was there a sign as to seating yourself or being seated. We had a lady walk by and ask if we had ordered. We said no, and that was the last we saw of her. After poking our heads over the booth multiple times, a man came over and asked if we needed anything. Eating or drinking? Well, I'm the only one here, so... fifteen minutes later, he comes back, saying You're still here? What would you like to drink? Seven minutes later, he comes back. Mind you, there was barely anyone here. We were the only ones not at the bar. We've been here 30 minutes and barely got our drinks. I hope this is just a bad night, because this is a terrible experience. Btw, it didn't get better. Stay away unless you want to sit at the bar.",fK_7LRfU0yWsEiGX4l9z9Q,0,0,1,fT5DfXiUT9KP6P8jyxiCtg

I promise you that you will not be disappointed. Fast drinks that are well made and an amazing personality. 
A bartender can really make or break a business, and he will make you have a good time. I always lose track of time when I'm in there. Fun times!",Z-28nAIehZWaeQfSNwrIbA,1,1,5,EKFaEqQfV17hpq-M6yc6IA

While it looks sketch from the outside, the staff is really friendly, and even the patrons are too! The inside is surprisingly roomy and has couch seating, tables, a non-smoking section, pool tables and a large circular bar.

The first time we ever walked in we were greeted and chatted up by the bar tender, introduced to a few of the regulars and then bought a round of drinks from another couple. This was our hot spot as we came here usually on Friday or Saturday nights and Sunday mornings.",3okrWrDZxfMrF3_thV3Kmg,2,0,5,Dk02LGhoJWmj-uerA2qtvA

When they say dive bars this is def. one...they have free pool however (2) tables and the food comes from Stop & Shop next door.
