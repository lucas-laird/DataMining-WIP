Food was terrible.  Sausages were raw, eggs were under-cooked, and pancakes came out 15 minutes before the rest of the meals.  We even ordered chicken and waffles, but cancelled the order after 45 minutes.  Waiter said they just were warming it up....  We also had a sausage patty that was burned beyond recognition, to which the waiter told us that's how its done, and refused to take it back.

Only giving 1 star because we got our drinks from the waitresses fast and they were okay.",zEwIoN5u1h5G8NmC1WyOdA,0,0,1,z_s8hxIYpJAJC3eClm9nBg

The food was good, nothing to write home about. 

The servers were polite, but the food took forever!!!!  We were sat at a table rather quickly, and ordered our food within 10 minutes, but waited 45 minutes for it to come out. 

If you have young kids, it is nice because they have a play area, but still exhausting.  My son and husband was starving after an hour if waiting.",SNyDeFU-9t-zxK0PHnTrZw,0,0,3,9I8swUYbmACmwu5C0NUP9Q

It takes a lot for me to get up and walk out of a place after ordering, but everything that could be wrong with a restaurant experience is exactly what we experienced at this place. And we never did get to the food.  After 40 minutes with only beverage service, it was not worth torturing ourselves to wait.  So we went next door to chronic tacos and had a great crane asada burrito in no time at all.

We had a small child who ordered a fruit cup, and yet that took over 30 minutes too.  I got up to refill my own water cup.  I got up again to ask for a refill of coffee for my dad.   We complained.  We asked to speak to the manager.   They did little to remedy our experience, stating only that it was a new cook and the line was backed up.   There were a number of empty tables.

I had trouble deciding on what to order. In the end, I went as healthy yet fulfilling as i could. I ordered the Monterrey Griddle Skillet. Home Fries (that Do NOT come with the traditional peppers an onions, which is what I like anyway), tender chicken pieces, diced tomatoes, saut√©ed mushrooms, topped with feta cheese and 3 eggs. Also came with Biscuits and Gravy. Skillet was more then I could hope for! The feta made the while dish! Hats off to the creators of this one. Biscuits and Gravy was decent.

If you are in the area shopping at Von's, CVS or any of the other stores at Village Center Circle, you might as well drop by here for breakfast or lunch. I usually have an eggwhite omelette and add things like turkey sausage, spinach, fresh cut jalapenos and green or red peppers. The service is friendly and quick and they have a play area for kids.

They are open for breakfast and lunch.  I have gone for both.  There are plenty of tables - in my 8-9 visits I have never waited more than 15 seconds to be seated.  I have ordered menu modifications and the servers remained very cheerful and the order came out right each time.  The prices are very fair.  (There is no super cheap option like you might see at Denny's, but the food is much, much better than you'd get at Denny's).  The only thing I can really think of to make the place better is to find a way to make the interior a little more cozy.  It is bright, open and very clean, but it is a little bare bones as far as decor.

We were seated promptly after arriving and greeted by a very nice server. The Red Velvet Pancake was okay and my waffle in its flower-shape was more entertaining to look at than appealing to my tummy. But it was very pretty nonetheless. 

My major gripe is that I was charged $1.99 for my child's drink even though we bought a kids meal. That's pretty ridiculous for me. Usually drinks come with the purchase of a children's meal. I am very conscious about pricing for my kids.. and this really annoyed me. And when  mama  ain't happy ... its not good.

We were there pretty early, so it wasn't crowded. Service was prompt and friendly. Prices were a little bit more than I normally pay for breakfast, but hey, it's Vegas and I was on vacation. 

I ordered the chicken and waffle, and boy was it good. The waffle was in the shape of a flower and it was delicious. The chicken was a boneless breast that was perfectly fried. The meal was very filling and really good. 

The hub ordered an egg breakfast with home fries, toast and bacon. He ate it all with a smile on his face. The biggest thing is they got his eggs right which doesn't always happen, and the bacon was rockin'. So he was happy.

For a restaurant that only serves breakfast and lunch the menu didn't have many choices. (It was only one page for both). I also would think that you would be serving the freshest ingredients possible yet, that was not the case either. I ordered a skillet as those are usually my favorite. I couldn't even eat it. I only ate part of my eggs as they weren't incorporated into the skillet as it would normally be. (I guess that was a blessing). The potatoes which are my absolute favorite were actually freezer burned!!! They were not palatable.
The restaurant itself is very nice and appeared clean but, the service was not what it should have been. It wasn't busy and I would have thought that the server would have bothered to notice that the food was barely touched.
I have to say that I was very disappointed and had hoped that this could have been a new place for us to frequent since it was so close and convenient. I hope that they notice and make some changes.",ygkpsZ-JKp8p8hiX4PWx0w,5,1,1,_ioarl_xzXeLwOth6X04MA

I will say this though, IHOP is right across the street but I would defiantly choose this place over them any day. That still doesn't say a whole lot about this place.

I usually order waffles. If it isn't overcooked it is very tasty. I tried the chicken and waffles once but the chicken just seems like a frozen chicken finger they nuked and put on top.  The eggs are usually the only thing cooked perfect and they do taste good. I have asked for sides before such as extra ranch or mayo and gotten weird extras in the cup it was brought in. 

Basically, this place isn't bad every once in a while but to take family and friends I would go t Rachel's Kitchen or up to Bagel Cafe. I get a coupon every now and then in the mail and that is when I generally eat there.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,9,3,3,Jq7e3RBKiRSDZLLeQCwudA

We walked in mid-morning on a Sunday and the place was very empty with only 4 parties seated in the large space. That should've been a warning sign, but as we were starving  .. we decided to stay and give it a try. 

I opted for the Red Velvet Pancakes and my dining partner got the Waffle. My pancakes came out and looked ok. But the taste was not there. They were soggy and mushy, and didn't taste like Red Velvet at all. And to make it worse, they decided to top it off with some Raspberry syrup. YUCK! I ate about 1/4 of the order and just couldn't eat any more. Anyone who knows me knows that it must have been pretty bad as I love pretty much Red Velvet anything and hate to waste food. 

My friend said the Waffle was okay, nicely done, but it was ""nothing to write home about."" Our server was prompt and friendly but didn't really check back to see how we liked our food or if we needed anything else.

The only thing prompt about our service was the person who took our drink order.  After that we had to ASK for someone to take our order.  We had to continually ASK for drink refills/cream, etc.  It took about 30 minutes for our food to come to the table.  We were NOT checked on while eating.  We waited another 10-12 minutes after we finished eating until we had to ASK for our check (keep in mind every ""ask"" is us hunting someone down and/or trying to make eye contact with someone to come over to us).  They took our card and after waiting another 10 minutes we finally had to go up to the bar to retrieve our card and complete our purchase.  Even after all of this I would have given it another try until my conversation with the manager.  I told him that the food is great, but if I can give some constructive criticism it would be to hire more help - the food took forever & the wait staff, although friendly enough, could in NO WAY handle the demands of the restaurant.

I don't see a lot of places that offer chicken and waffles so when I spotted that I knew I had to try it! When it came out it wasn't what I was expecting. The waffle was beautiful it  kind of looked like a flower but the piece of chicken was disappointing. I was thinking the chicken would be like a drumstick not a chicken strip. It wasn't about the quantity ...I just think that they taste different. I would have rather had chicken that had bones in it. It would give it more of a ""down home type of appeal"". The waffle was fresh and I could tell that is wasn't frozen because it was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

I thought the restaurant's decor could have been brighter. If you are going for mustard yellow why not go a step above and make it sunshine yellow!  I just think a brighter yellow would remind me more of breakfast . What can I say I love bright colors! 

The service was fine. The food came out in a timely manner and we didn't have to hunt down a waitress for refills. I just thought my entree could have been better .",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,3,0,3,84D5IGwyo-fVsP2XS4CGjg

1. Throw all your seasonings and spices out the window. Don't forget the salt & pepper.
2. Use canned products whenever possible. Cook omelet until it reaches the consistency of styrofoam.
3. Roughly chop some potatoes and cook only until they are slightly browned on one side. Remember step #1.
4. Plate your creation.
5. Lay a Kraft Singles cheese slice on top the whole mess.

Adding one star because the servers were attentive and the patio is nice.",6ZUqLWRcu1ZuhUyZK1REgA,3,0,2,AtSSmUZrI_dCBbtxA2dxiA

The food was not bad, but I didn't see anything special to it. I ordered the benedicts eggs and my friend got the southwest griddle.  My plate was not as great as I expected, however, the griddle looked a lot better.  I will give this place another chance and order a griddle or the red velvet packages which appear to be the most popular plates.

The eggs Benedict minus Canadian bacon was pretty tasty. They get real points for personality here though. Our server was really sweet and efficient even though she was brand new. I saw lots of folks who I suspect are regulars having coffee and breakfast. It really has that mom and pop feel to it.,W0J1w2gKCfWNIARjvyYiow,1,0,4,WkZtjyRkwW2OqtTjK_8ACw

+1 for The Griddle for being extremely KID FRIENDLY!

We ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes. These had TONS of chocolate chips in the batter and lots of yummy chocolate and strawberry sauce. Good choice!   Soul eats up pancakes like there is no tomorrow, and he was very satisfied with the portion size too!

The pancakes come with a side of eggs and bacon or sausage (or both).  I chose the latter, and everything was solid but not outstanding.

I think this is a great place to get some breakfast :)

5250925,2011-12-01,0,YBNmWKk0c_yMGGv24gCrXQ,"I would not return without strong coaxing. The food was nothing special. We ordered one of the skillets. I can't remember the name but it was the only one with feta cheese. Maybe my expectations were off but, when I have ordered skillets at other restaurants, the ingredients were integrated. At The Griddle, each item (scrambled eggs, potatoes, chicken and feta cheese) appeared to be cooked, placed on the iron skillet separately and then served. Additionally, the chicken was dry. The waitress also did not charge us the correct price for egg whites but, my friend did not want to address this as it was only a $1 over what it should have been.

I ordered the French toast as I heard The Griddle on Eastern was known for their French toast. The portion was a good size and they tasted fine. Not wonderful and not bad but, they would not bring me back to this restaurant over another place.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,2,0,1,hVqkzXy5Ks-gP2qCp5oifw

One of the best pancakes in the city. The french toast was masterful. Don't go by reviews of people trying to be Gordon Ramsey! They're not. I'd looked for 2 years in the Las Vegas area for a pancake that could measure up to that of Cracker Barrel...I found it here. 

The Grand Cafe at Green Valley Ranch is the only other place that has a great pancake with awesome taste BEFORE you add the syrup and butter. 

Come to The Griddle! It's worth it.",Ptx8ghXZmVytufq6rre1Ig,1,1,5,QlGDRQwqFw94ZtTwXZ831w

The good news is the place is clean and roomy with a kids area for little ones to play in.  So that is all nice.  But the food is somewhat lacking.  The menu is not that large in the first place and then the food we had was lacking.  We had an omelet with potatoes and the potatoes were undercooked and inedible.  Also had red velvet pancakes and those were ok, but those who know about/have tried Babystacks' version, I have to say those are better by a mile.  So I am not sure I will be back there are so many breakfast places in the area that mediocre really doesn't do it.",fMfOeUAMvmRigE78zhPluA,1,0,3,UICWqDi9EnVi8vMFWnf4hg

The hollandaise sauce lacks traditional taste and actually had a very odd taste. not sure what the odd taste was but it was odd. i requested the hash browns extra crispy which only came out crispy on one side and wasn't even cooked on the bottom so they were basically half cooked and mushy in the middle. yuck! i could only choke down half the plate. the coffee is pretty bitter as well. 1 star and that's being generous.,PuT-pxgEf-dNySOaIlZm0Q,1,0,1,5Hj1TEKyGeAaoK2GyP3iGQ
