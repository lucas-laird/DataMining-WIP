2011,2014-04-28,0,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"The food is delicious. I went there with my family today and ordered the paneer chili and chili chicken as appetizers. What can i say the appetizers was absolutely amazing. Try ordering it at a level 6-7 spicy and it will burn your mouth. Loved the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Jalfrezi. They also have a check-in deal for yelp for a free lassi or soda. Last but not least one of my favorites was Gajar Halwa, it was nice and warm, and absolutely amazing. The prices are reasonable and cheap compared to other Indian Restaraunts around vegas. Chicken dishes are at $14 versus other restaraunts that have them for $18. They also have huge buffet for only $9.99. The most selections for the lowest prices. Now thats what i called a indian Buffet. I would deffinetly come back here again.",SQm5TEeF_tP9QJKg1HAN6Q,0,0,5,cYgFjoj6GpvX6IuyXAHtXw
7268,2014-10-15,0,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"my husband and I came here after the sales associate at the pandora store at the forum recommended it. 

for apps we had bhel puri, chili chicken and chicken momos. the bhel puri was nice and spicy. the tamarind chutney is as good as homemade. the chili chicken is a huge portion and could double as an entr√©e. the momos were tasty also.

we then shared a non-veg thali and everything was divine. the best part was that the tabdoori chicken appetizer that comes with the thali wasn't hot pink in color (and it shouldn't be people just FYI) it was nicely BBQ'd and spiced beautifully. loved it! 

finally, a true test for me, was the chai. perfection! I really enjoyed thai place and will definitely be back.

I only docked 2 stars since service was pretty much non-existent. We went in on a Friday afternoon for the lunch buffet, it was a slow day I suppose, there were probably only 6 other patrons eating there. After you are seated and given your drink and naan, you are pretty pretty much on your own until its time to pay. If you ever want a drink or naan refill during the rest of your meal, you'll have to get up and go look for your server in the backroom/kitchen. I had to do this twice. Its like they don't care about your refills if its a slow day and instead just go hang out in the backroom.",ktZzjG2OAccIGLWr9kXGfQ,0,0,3,cn5899X_1hWm_Pwv2SWGrA

Visiting from Texas and had an extremely bad experience two days in a row.  First day we order food and waited for 45 mins without a single dish on the table.  Since we were in no position to go anywhere else and just wanted to eat indian food, we asked it to be packed and get to-go and were told we will have our food shortly.  After waiting for nearly an hour, we proceeded to walk out at which point the food was being brought to us.  After taking the food back to the hotel, we noticed there were several items missing.  

Experience on Day 2 was similar with order placed for to-go and waiting for 40 minutes.  During our wait, we noticed two families walking out in a similar manner as we had on a previous day and also observed some patrons without menu and water for a long period of time.  Once again, we received the food after 45 minutes and took it back to the hotel.  AND THE ORDER WAS WRONG AGAIN!  

Food quality was just above par, it wasn't anything special.  Just slightly better than the popular indian place off the strip.

Overall, I will not be visiting this restaurant again.",mTesUC7-StI4R-9ZXLFmHg,1,0,1,1CdL5h1cTWzvNuFWj0WTYA

I came here at night and ordered chicken masala and samosa. The chicken masala was over cooked and dry. No flavor at all. The appetizer that they delivered at first was the wrong order and burnt on top of it. The samosa was okay, but again the seasoning was poor and there were 2 big ones for 5 dollars, which is pricey for the quantity. 

It took me awhile to get the food, and I had to get the waiters attention just to place the order. They weren't that busy, so it was disappointing. The place looks nice. The food tasted like buffet quality, and I have had better buffet food to be honest. My bill came to around 20 dollars.",i3EX1vMazB4B4wQ_Uq67SQ,0,0,2,PF8BZInP9woUcBEgT9_rhg

Her mood seemed to change quickly when we were not interested in the drink menu she provided. While waiting for our food we noticed a dead silence due to the fact that there was no music playing. A few moments pass by and a gentleman with a really upbeat attitude came over and delivered a little snack while we waited for our food.
When the food arrived , it looked amazing! The flavors were perfect along with the spice level that I had picked. I ordered the chicken tikka masala with rice and garlic naan. One garlic naan and white rice can be split between two people but the chicken tikka masala could not. 
The restaurant has a promotion going on that says "" free dessert when you check in on Yelp"" my fianc√© told our waitress that we checked in and she said we would also have to write a review. She stayed with our table to watch my fianc√© write the review and she then gave us a choice between rice pudding or a pastry.
The pastry tasted like a pancake with liquid sugar. It was really good.
OVER ALL, the restaurant could use background music, and maybe a little better costumer service, but the food was perfect for the most part.

Delivered:

We had delivery at an usual location..an RV park. Not wanting to unhook our rig we decided to risk the possibility that they may change their mind upon reading my instructions. When the driver showed up he was super friendly!! 

The food was piping hot, and was like it had just been brought out of the kitchen. Did you catch the detail that it was delivered?!? It wasn't soggy, droopy, dry, over cooked or any of the other ills that befall delivered food. Oh and they delivered 30 minutes prior to estimated time  - bonus!!

1st Started with an Appetizer, ""Chicken Pakora"" ($6) for drinks we ordered the Mango Lassi (1 free via Yelp check-in) Very delicious!  it's like biting into a very ripe mango!

My Wife ordered the ""Authentic Chicken Curry""  ($14), I had the ""Prawn Xacuti"" ($21)......

The problem with this place is that they use the same ""Base Sauce"", the Sauce used for the Prawn Xacuti and Chicken Curry dishes tasted the same!, only difference was color and spice level , that's it!

Initially I was going to try the Non-Vegetarian Delhi Thali but was told by waiter that the Chef ""did not time for that"" so I chose the ""Prawn Xacuti"" . 

The portions regardless of dish/price are the same. 

Once our food arrived we really couldn't eat peacefully as the waiting staff were constantly asking if the food was OK, like every few minutes, I avoided making eye contact after the 2nd time, I just wanted to eat the freaking food! this place was a total disappointment guess the Wife and I should of just done the Buffet, but No Thanks, you only get to disappoint us once!

It is cheap, has a big capacity for seating, and a good variety of starters, vegetables, meat, and rice dishes. The goat meat dishes are excellent cause the meat is soft and tender (as compared to chewy meat with lot of bones in some other places). Chicken biryani is standard and not too spicy. I loved their samosas as well. I have heard that they have good lassi, though I haven't tasted it yet.

644021,2014-02-24,0,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"Okay so I just don't get the hype. I was really excited - I mean Indian, buffet, good reviews, sounds like a recipe for success. It was okay... and cheaper than other places at $9.99. But I think I would pay the extra few dollars and go a block over to Mint in a heart beat. Yes the buffet takes up length wise over half the restaurant, but what I didn't care for about this place was that it lacked variety - you have the standard Tandoori chicken, Tikka Masala etc.  But maybe it was a busy day before I got there giving them the benefit of the doubt, but I had to fish around in the sauce to find pieces of chicken and not only in the tikki masala but any dish which contained sauce and meat. Don't get me wrong I love sauce, but I like to find that there is ample meat to accompany my sauce. 

Also, there was something about the ambience that felt cold - maybe it was the poor acoustics which made it feel very big and open but not in a good way or the just the set up but somehow the dining room was not overly inviting. Although, that in itself is not something that would normally concern me - hey if the food is superb I'll eat it sitting on a street corner (as used to be the case with Viva Las Arapas before they moved). Nonetheless, I thought it is something that should be noted. 

Service was average, nothing outstanding. We did request garlic naan and they brought it. My friend asked for lemon wedges for water, they forgot, had to ask again and then they brought a plate of lime wedges from the salad bar.. maybe they don't have lemons? 

On the upside I got a free Mango Lassi which was tasty with Yelp check in - so thank you Delhi Indian Cuisine for that treat. So overall I wish them good luck and I hope that they make it as I do with all restaurants that are not chains but unfortunately I am going to stay loyal to Mint for lunch buffet, and Mt. Everest as a second choice.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,1,0,2,BsKypiV7UkK3FRlF5NJK6A

A great deal for only $11/person. They had butter chicken and goat curry, which were both good and not tough or overly dry. The veggie/salad section was small but fresh. Chana masala and potatoes/cauliflower mixture were good. (Unfortunately for me) they had more of a vegetarian selection than meat selection. But all in all, a decent variety to suit any palate or diet. One plate was enough for me as I find Indian food to be extremely filling, even in small quantities.

A few minor complaints were that the naan was thin in some parts, but very doughy towards the middle. And had to remind one of the workers about my drink order. But worth it to come back again.",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,0,0,4,vBG5XIjqZBro2DNZMJXdag

I arrived first and it was empty and cavernous.  I ordered a cocktail while waiting for my friends.  15 minutes went by and my first friend arrived and still no cocktail. I was the only one there!  It was forever before she finally brought my drink and when she did it was the wrong cocktail. I explained it was a goose and side of fresh lemon juice the first time. She brought out a goose and a fresh lemonade.  When I told her it was wrong she totally copped an attitude with me, then went back to the bar only to make another wrong cocktail which was goose and a lemon soda!   When I told her she got it wrong yet again she told me she's never had somebody in there like me and she started yelling in her native language to another of her associates... and clearly it was about me lol  

Then someone came out of the kitchen, we believe it was an owner, and started accusing her of stealing keys.  It turned into an all out screaming match in the middle of the restaurant.  I mean take it outside!  The cooks even came out of the kitchen to get ring side seats, eagerly awaiting the blood shed.   Our friend finally arrived in the midst of the insanity. It was like an episode of cops was unfolding before our very eyes.  We exited the establishment post haste.  

Unfortunately we never tried the food but the ambience or lack there of leads me to want to leave a negative star rating, but I have to give it a one to post.

Went for buffet yesterday with family. Extremely disappointed. Food was OK at best. Tandoori chicken was cold and dry, It got finished and was not replenished for 30 mins. Till then we were done.
They serve bread (naan) fresh on the table. Great. We were 4 adults. Gave us 2 naans, one garlic and one plain. We didn't know the type till we were done with the top garlic one. We asked for another garlic naan and our unfriendly waitress refused till we finished all the naans. As is in dictatorship you have to follow what the Govt says so here we have to obey with the instructions. When done, we asked for Garlic naan and for a change she smiled and left to get replenishment. We waited for as long as we could reminding her but with little success. Finally after a long wait we got the naan (1 piece) only to discover that it was not properly cooked and raw dough was coming in our mouth. Called the waitress and she quickly took our naan away never to be seen again. At that point we were disappointed and done. Paid our bill and left the place vowing to never return. 
My wife paid the bill as me and kids were freaking out because of poor quality of management and lack of food. She complained to the manager who had following reasons. Got too many people, staff ran away, 3 weeks ago there was rain in Las Vegas that they are recovering from etc.. However we had to pay full price for the food while they all messed up.
Our waitress was very unprofessional and would run away when before we could finish asking her a question. I had once asked her to listen patiently. She was rude or may be helpless. Did not understand hospitality and maybe had no experience. I think if she was polite my review would not be so negative.

The menu contained numerous items that were new to us, and we started things off with a Mango Rum Lassi. The alcohol was a nice addition and did not overpower the sweetness of the lassi. For my main course I had the  Kadhai Paneer and enjoyed every bite. My wife had the Chicken Xacuti. I'll let her write about that in her review (she liked it). We shared the kashmiri naan and used it to scoop up the great food. 

Would love to come back for the buffet.

Side note, be careful in the parking lot, there was a taxi that flew by us not once but twice and darn near hit our rental car. :\",JsOZKgLrNq2XXPZu4Shesw,1,0,4,fSevTbv9UxFZL4EpOj5pDA

The lunch buffet starts at 11:00am and goes until 3:00pm. It is one of the better priced Indian buffets in town at 9.99. I came in and ordered the lunch buffet. The dining room is very clean and spacious. There is a large buffet area which is loaded with tons of food.

The yelp check in offer was for either a soda or one of their house made lassi's, basically, a yogurt smoothie. They have a sweet one, a salty one, and a mango one. I ordered the mango. It was SOOO good. The flavor was very mango-ey and it was silky smooth and had a nice mouthfeel from the yogurt.

As for the food, I would recommend anything! I especially liked their chicken, all of their versions of them were super tender. The goat stew was especially tasty as well. It wasn't too gamey and the sauce on it was fabulous! There wasn't anything on the menu that I didn't like.

One thing that I thought was kinda weak was their garlic naan. I found the taste to be a little bit bland. And for their noodle, milk dessert was a little bit too sweet.

Service was also kinda questionable. They seemed to start out pretty slow with taking our orders and getting our drinks, and after our first round of dishes they didn't clear our plates fast enough so that we were stacking our plates on top of each other. But, they were quicker at bussing our table during the middle of our dining experience.

Would I come back? Oh, you know it, because I loves me some Indian food. And the food here is delicious, fresh, and tasty. And try the mango lassi, it's really good.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,20,15,4,IpuBPVlXAKi3hFdGxFFKLQ

Goat curry is meaty with good heat to it, tandoori chicken, curry chicken, chili chicken, and biryani rice all available. Vegetarian options included samosas, pekora, chana masala, dal, and squash, along with saag paneer.
The salad section also has a phenomenal mint sauce that goes deliciously with absolutely everything- I'd buy this stuff to go if I could (I didn't ask).
Finished up with the gulab jamun, my favorite dessert of milk-cheese balls soaked in honey sauce.

I liked that the variety of the buffet was fairly diverse with a lot of lighter and vegetarian options, allowing me to sample a little of everything without totally pigging out.

It seems a new restaurant and 5 to 10 mins away from strip. I usually go to Gandhi but found this better for various reasons.
This have plenty of parking space for vehicles and plenty of area for dining. 
We are larger group with three kids and  we need a plenty of space to move around. This restaurant was perfect for us. Coming to the food it was better than other Vegas Indian food i tasted. Since it became crowded the items are fresh that makes it delicious . I wont find anything in the heating tray for longer time. It always better to go early for buffets, we went late by 2pm so some of the vegeterian trays are already over so we got a little wait time for the foods to be prepared and filled up.

The Non veg starters are more , so you will get good options. This is typical north indian resturant so you cant expect a South indian briyani or the idly at its best. But its typical briyani and an better idly served at north indian resturant.

The butter nan and garlic nan was really delicious. 

And at that time there was option to get a Mango lassi for yelp check in, Its really very good. I found this as best among Indian resturants in Vegas.",0bGTUam7d-QW1Co555YtKw,2,0,4,_9A9tDoTVjJ8EZEPDAVlDw

I ordered the chicken Tikka masala,  garlic nann, and then added in a new nann that I had never tried that had cheese in it! There was also a yelp check in of a free mango lassi. Now,  I actually have no idea what mango lassi actually is... but can I have a keg of that!?! 

The food was great.  Perfectly spiced,  great portions... my only complaint,  was that they changed my order.  I guess they were out of the cheese nann, so they substituted it for a nann that had coconut and cherries in it.

No, this is the real deal. The food is excellent. My wife and I had dinner off the standard menu and we asked for several dishes and we know indian food. How do we know indian? We were taught by an Indian from Goa who knew many dishes and taught us how to cook northern, delhi, goa, and southern styles. My wife has cooked indian, made the paneer, made the yogurt, crushed the spices, everything. So we know how it should taste and the regional spices.
So what did we try?
We had vegetable samosa chaat with mint sauce and tamarind d sauce. They also brought papadom.
We then had Rogan Josh, Navratan Korma, Goat Vindaloo, Mutter Paneer, plain parathas, and plain basmati rice. Every dish was authentic and provided in nice portions.
The dinner was capped by galub jaman which was very light and fresh and the syrup was light and sweet.
If you like indian, you won't be disappointed. If you want to try it, they will scale the heat from 1 to 10...don't be afraid it will be too hot!
The owners are one family from Nepal. We were served by Krishna and Ashmati who were informative and met our wishes exactly.

2044150,2014-08-12,0,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"I am sorry this restaurant is not closer to our part of town, for when we are craving Indian food! My husband and I stopped in for their lunch buffet. A great selection, and all the food tasted fresh. I thought the particular standouts were the Goat Curry, the onion bhaji, and the garlic naan. I love goat, and of course its not easy to find in the U.S., and this is a staple on Delhi's buffet. Goat meat is a little stronger tasting than beef, and stood up to the sauce very well. The cuts of meat are on-the-bone...I wanted to dive in with my fingers and grab each piece and gnaw it clean!  The onion bhaji was crisp and tasty; not greasy at all. And the garlic naan was light and chewy and very, very fresh.
I'm not a big fan of the bright yellow curry sauces, but my husband reported that the Punjabi curry was very good. The saag paneer was good also.. The tandoori chicken wasn't as highly spiced as I like, but it was moist enough to be tasty. Like the onion bhaji, the samosas were crisp, not soggy, and had a nice flavor. The biryani rice was a little greasy, but that was probably my only real nitpick with any of the dishes.
They also have the standard side sauces, raita and mint sauce. We could have eaten those all day long, with baskets of naan! For dessert, there was warm carrot halwah (very tasty, but a little odd to us; not quite a side dish; not quite a dessert); and one other selection. You'll have to look for the ""samia"" (I've always known it as ""kheer""), at the back of the salad table. It's not labeled as a dessert, and it's right next to the similar-looking raita sauce. If you aren't familiar with it, its a sweet milk and vermicelli-noodle pudding flavored with cardamom. I like mine with more cardamom, but this was a nice cool & sweet ending to a spicy lunch :-) 
With one soda pop, our meal for 2 was about $25, and well worth it. Rather than cook just one main dish at home, we enjoyed being have a lot of good Indian food at one meal. Oh, and the employees were very friendly as well!",0DRa4GSTSml7vpwAFfRXjQ,0,0,5,fN7FOKsdsqUQn0Rkf66YTQ

I loved the chicken mahkani and the tandoori chicken was very tasty. I enjoyed the yellow dal and the palak peneer (spinach with cheese).

2150562,2014-12-04,0,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"The Skinny: the Nepalese/East Indian cuisine is very satisfying... not to mention great piping hot naan that is perfectly crispy on the bottom with a slight chew. Only sad thing is that they do not consistently have kheer which is my fav. (4) service: always pretty good - water glasses are filled consistently (4) value: for $11.99, the lunch buffet is a great value - good for groups due to the large dining room (4).

This is our new go-to Indian Buffet joint in town. Sporting a good variety of items, they offer both Nepalese/East Indian flavors. The dining room is spacious and is capable of serving large groups of people comfortably.

Service is usually pretty good and your water glass is never left unfilled.

My favorite items include the saag paneer, chana masala and the aloo gobi. So delicious and usually always there. Their raita is nice and thick. They do not have chutney available as a condiment however the tamarind sauce does okay in a pinch. The tandoori chicken is quite moist and tasty as well. The hubs is addicted to their butter chicken and daal.

Their naan is great - loved the crispy bottom with the slight chew. Order it with garlic at no extra cost. Awesome!

Their one weakness in my opinion are the desserts. They have a rather artificial, watery mango ""custard"". This is in rotation with the vermicelli payasam which I found to be a bit too sweet and one note. I kind of miss the kheer using rice pudding and cardamom.

Overall, these are minor issues to an great buffet. 4 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,2,4,x5gWuVBwAVCQUqyaQKlbow

Naan bread is brought to your table fresh from the oven, so no problem of dried out (or missing) naan in the buffet line like some other places. As if you need another reason to wolf down warm deliciousness...ask for the garlic naan, mmmmmm, you won't be sorry.

We ended our meal with one of my favorite things - a cup of real chai tea ($2/cup). If you have  never had it, you have to add your own sweetener, which is nice because you can adjust it to your liking (and you don't have to use real sugar if you prefer artificial sweeteners).

I would have to say this is one of the best Indian buffets I have had in Vegas. We left full and happy, without feeling heavy (other buffets we've visited often had overly oily items and this one did not). I also think that for the quality and selection of items, they could actually charge a couple dollars more and still be a bargain. We will definitely be back!

note to owners:  I wish you offered some kind of drink menu. Not only would customers would know what kind of drink options were available for purchase, it would also give your business the opportunity for additional revenue during the lunch buffet time.",OcpxS8U7evLWyfw1K2pwng,0,1,5,dQOCtHCe25EpHUugA_U_4w

The location was pretty easy to find. Although if you are coming from the side it can be a little difficult because the restaurant is hidden in the back corner. The server was pretty quick... too quick I say. She would come around and grab my bf's plate 1st before asking ""are you done?""

 *sigh; honey you gotta ask if they're done before you take it* 

The buffet in my case was pretty good. I like the chicken masala, to me it was good. The spinach (saag paneer but without the cottage cheese) * I think * had a little weird taste to it. The lamb dish was kinda hard and over cooked. The soup was pretty good (can't remember the name of the dish). The chicken tandoori was severely burnt and lacked spice and flavor. Samosas (vegetarian) were pretty good. They had a slight kick to them,which I liked. 

From the guys side, they didn't like it. They say the chicken  was over cooked. The saag paneer was mixed with milk and it tasted bad. The Naan was dry, hard and slightly burnt but the dessert was okay ( the guys say it was the only dish that was good because it was brought rather than made). Overall if you're not a food analyst  will love it! But if you are one then ""enjoy"".

Also the manager doesn't really care about its customers, he could have at least asked if the food was alright, instead like most business people, Money 1st (pay 1st) ask questions maybe later.... or never.",f_-Gx1TwXtfsXqv-YX9YcA,0,0,3,RkAELGgV7PG3cAxinopGyw

Impressed by the gingery Dal Tadka, and the savory and slightly sweet Navratan (veggie) Korma. They were cool with making us Roti (whole wheat) instead of regular Naan, and I thought the size of the Tandoori Chicken pieces was encouraging. Smaller chicken pieces indicate less hormones, and a more expensive bird. It's the first dish you will see on the buffet, and is a good representation of the rest of it. Quality ingredients made with care in quantity - these are some of the largest chafing dishes you will see on a Indian buffet, ever!

Looking forward to the next visit, and hopefully an upgrade to a string of *red* stars.

Food was ok and not great taste. It was bit salty and looks like made in hurry. Also few items was missing from vegetarian thali.

Anyways Delhi Indian Cuisine is the latest Indian restaurant in my rotation. It's located in a plaza on the NE corner of Flamingo and Maryland between Toys""R""Us and Albertsons. Of course you have to do the lunch buffet I think it was $10.99 which is about the same price for everyone else, you might find someone doing it for $9.99. The food here is delicious, not my favorite for taste but maybe a close 2nd with the other business one block over. Forgive me but I don't know what all the dishes are but I love the green stuff, the orange stuff, the reddish stuff, and the chicken stuff. Nah I'm kidding, almost but I'll pretty much eat everything they have to offer, the tandoori chicken, the chicken tikka masala, the chilli chicken, the goat curry, the saag paneer, the garlic naan, the gulab jamun, etc. Well almost everything, I still haven't tried the chow mein yet.

It does seem like it can hold a lot of people, you could throw a party,  and it has been very busy each time I've been there. They have booths and tables. Customer service is alright they do seem to be shorted handed and do take a while to do thinks like getting the garlic naan.

They have check-in offer of a free soda or lassi. Each time I've been there I've asked them for the lassi but they've yet to brought be one. Good luck on getting your. Dammit I see that a lot of you are getting yours.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,9,7,4,h0d8TMUbpN6pF9Hx8Mt_uw

I myself have never had a whole lot of Indian Food and have only been to one other Indian restaurant many years ago. Being that this is the second Indian restaurant I've eaten at, this by far is my favorite!

The first time my BF and I had decided to try Delhi Indian Restuarant, we had decided to go for lunch. They offer a buffet style with lots of different dishes to from such as Tikka Misala, Tandoori Chicken, Curries, vegetarian dishes, appetizers, endless Naan bread and of course Butter Chicken. The buffet is great! Especially if you're not familiar with Indian Food than you should definitely try the buffet, so you're able to try multiple dishes and figure out what you like and it was inexpensive (I believe it was like $10 or so)

....LOVE THE BUFFET BUT.....
The BF and I came the second time around thinking it was buffet style not knowing they only served it during lunch. Not mad at all, the BF only wanted Butter Chicken and this also gave me the chance to try something new. 

Before we ordered, they give you what is called a Papadum. Thin, crisp bread served with 2 Chutneys. Not sure of the names, but the one to the left had a plum flavor, almost like sweet and sour or li hing mui flavor. Maybe even a lighter than the two. The right has a cilantro taste and it is spicy, but a tolerable spice to it. Both very delicious!

My BF ordered of course the Butter Chicken Basmati Rice. You choose your heat 1 thru 10, he loves HOT food! 7, he chooses 7 so that I'm able to eat a little bit of it too. Eeks! I can feel my insides burning already, haha. 

I ordered the Lental Soup and the Reshmi Kebab. Lental Soup was creamy, flavorful and delicious. I would order it again! The kebab comes out hot and sizzling on a plate, literally. The meat is not on a stick either, it's shaped and texture is like a breakfast sausage link but on a larger scale, sitting on a bed of onions and green bell peppers. Topped with cilantro and wedges of lemon. Do, take those lemons and squeeze it allllll over the kebab, it takes it to a whole new level. OMG, okay Reshmi Kebob I see you!! Sooooo good! The meat is ground up chicken in a sausage form, it's packed full of flavors! Reminds me of a chicken and lemon dish from back home. Although I'm not familiar with all the spices used, I'm loving every bite of it! 

We loved everything about our meal.

As the restaurant is really empty, they maybe try to cut the cost on the food, and it's scary to think what you have on your plate....

On a recent trip to Vegas, a friend recommended I leave the strip (its like 3 blocks away so not that far I guess) and eat at Delhi. I love Indian food so I gave it a shot. If I didn't like Indian food before, this would have sold me for sure! 

The food was a solid 5/5. We had the butter chicken and the malai kofta. We also started with some classic somosas. Everything was fantastically delicious. The somosas were crisp and yet fluffy on the inside. The butter chicken was a little spicy, creamy, and melt in your mouth all at once. The kofta was a dish I had never tried before but was pleasantly surprised because the curry it was in was the best curry I have had to date. We topped it off with garlic naan and life was perfect.

The servers were always attentive. This is the kind of place where you will never see a water glass empty. To be fair, we were one of two parties dining at that time (they had just opened for dinner 2 minutes prior to us arriving) so mileage may vary.

Finally, the price was most definitely right. That entire meal I described came out to like $40 which left me and my gf who I was eating with bursting at the seams. I can't say enough about how great this place is.",DYnR7n-jFmz5zKkMIraGYw,5,3,5,xEIW_pmU__sytHWRNK8yKg

Over hyped restaurant. Absolutely negligent staff and below average food. It was a wednesday lunch buffet spread. I went in with my parents for a vegetarian indian spread. The moment you enter the place it has a weird fries oil n smoke smell. The spread had bad oil smelling samosas as starters. One bite and all you can taste is oil, on the verge of puking. Idlis were warm from bottom but the top layer was dry like a plastic. Hmm proceeding further cucumber in the salad bar was bitter, raita was made from sour curd. It seemed leftover curd and to cut the sourness the chef added too much of water resulting it into a lassi rather then a raita. 

Main course was another trauma in its own. Gobi aloo was a bit under cooked, palak paneer looked a left over of saag mixed with hard paneer. Infact wasnt even mixed well. Navratan korma was actually a carrot curry with rich cream gravy. Chole and naan alongwith a gulab jamun were the only decently cooked items. Paid 43$ for it. Certainly not worth it. 

Adding to the above i communicated all of this to the staff/manager on duty. All he did was hear and walk off. One of the most disappointing experiences ever. Please donot go there and waste your time and money.",nNTmDBmNFshcgfODwDy9uw,0,0,1,g-K3chZKI07uVPTpBIen-g

If you don't think white people can handle spicy food, just don't ask us how spicy they want it. Make us think you only offer it one way. But that's not what you did. You specifically asked how spicy I wanted my Vindaloo. I said, ""Very spicy."" You looked at me like I was crazy, and asked again. I said, ""Indian spicy"", hoping that magical keyword would convince you. No, instead, you looked me in the eye and asked if it was for someone else. Had I not been ready to rob a bank for a Vindaloo, I would have left right then, but, at this point, I was committed. So, thinking that you finally were going to give me what I asked, I let it go, and we ordered the rest of our stuff. 

The Vindaloo's spice level was somewhere between yogurt and a milk shake. Granted, it had a fantastic flavor, as did the Tikka Masala, the Mahkane, and the Saag Paneer. The Kashmir Naan was so delicious it brought a tear to my eye, and the Galub Jamun was top-notch. In fact, the only thing missing from my night of Indian food bliss was some vague tingle; some heat to let me know that I had eaten some spices. It was just not there.  

I'll definitely order from here again, but I need to know what secret code I can give you so that you'll actually put some heat in my Vindaloo.",Io5GxWjhtxqiWnoA-6Fh-w,2,1,4,EYVpvk_kA_vpj3Gw2kjDIA

2837534,2014-02-12,11,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"(Review of buffet only)

Interesting choice of location to set up a new Indian buffet on the east side of town considering you have Mint, India Masala, Origin India, Gandhi, and Taste of India all within a 2 mile radius, although I think it's the others that should be intimidated, since the new kid in town has got some bhangra swagger.  Pretty much all of its rivals are in little strip malls of varying degrees of  decay, so this should not deter you in terms of its exterior.  Once you step inside, the modern decor with track lighting, single open room layout, and seemingly endless linear display of offerings along the buffet line should set your mind at ease.  

Upon being seated, you are immediately prompted if you would like naan bread with your buffet.  Not only should you say yes, but you should specifically request the garlic naan since the aroma alone with the freshly minced garlic and finishing brush of ghee emanating from the freshly cut bread removed from the tandoori oven is intoxicating enough to get your appetite revved up on the feast that lies ahead (refills are complimentary if you need more)

As one approaches the buffet line, the first wave of offerings include various meats including the standards such tandoori, tikki masala, and curry chicken along with some wild cards such as goat curry and reshmi kababs, which is a ground chicken meatball that seems a bit healthier than the sauced meats.   The latter half of the line offers a multitude of vegetarian offerings including saag paneer (spinach), chana masala (spicy stewed chickpeas), eggplant, mixed curry veggies, and lentils.  The third category of offerings is the carbs, which in this case included plain basmati, a spicy chicken biryani, mini-samosas (which gives you more of the flaky crust to enjoy, much like why mini-pecan pies are superior to regular pecan pie), idli (a steamed rice cake), and something I've never seen before, a spongy savory cake called dhokla, which I've read to be a beloved street snack in the southern part of India.  It has a cornbread-like consistency, a rich yellow hue from turmeric and mustard seeds, and is served with some chili peppers, cilantro, and toasted coriander seeds.  Add a dollop of tamarind, and it is a pretty addictive combo of flavors which I would have had more of had I not discovered it at the end of my meal.  

I almost never have room for desserts after an Indian buffet but it is a rotating mix of gulab jamun(sweet milk balls), rice pudding, gajar halwa (carrots+milk), and a few offerings of fruit which I am always a bit wary of when it comes to buffets in general.  

Service was very good in which plates were cleared and water was refilled efficiently, and the staff checked in a few times to see how I was enjoying the meal.  Compared to the local competition, price point is excellent (9.99 vs 10.99 at India Masala, and 12 and up at Mint and Gandhi), quality of food is definitely in my top 3 in Vegas (Mount Everest and Taj Palace), and highlights include the garlic naan, balance in offerings between vegetarian and meat dishes,  a few unique offerings (mini samosas and dhokla), and ambiance.  India Masala is still my go-to choice for take out buffet due to quantity (refer to my review for my patented packing technique) as well as complimentary Mango Lassi with yelp check-in, but if I'm dining in, Delhi Indian is my new go-to place for quality when I plan to go on an Indian carb feeding frenzy for lunch.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,21,21,4,8Z36IGVl5VJZ0OXfkBNx4A

It was a bit of a drive across town for us, but we would soon discover that it was well worth the drive on this blustery night in Vegas. When we arrived it was rather quite with only a few tables of guests, but we were welcomed with a warm greeting that soon transformed into thorough service in their clean space with simple yet pleasing ambiance.

We took most of our server's suggestions after talking about our likes and dislikes. Most dishes have a spice range from one to ten. We opted to stay right in the middle and asked for some separate spicy sauce to add...the spice on the side was very spicy, just the way I like.

We ordered Garlic Naan, Nepali Vegetable Momos, Butter Chicken with dark meat, Lamb Dhansak, Baingan Bharta, and Mango Lassi. Dinner also comes with complimentary Papadum & Chutney. Everything was delicious and exotic. 

My favorites were the Momos and Butter Chicken. The Momos are Nepali dumplings--folded fresh and juicy with curry dipping sauce on the side...I enjoyed these dumplings very much, especially the excellent wrapper of the Momos...not too thick and not too thin.  I am used to Japanese and Thai Curry but this Indian Curry was made of different layers of spices and full of great flavor.

We didn't get any menus, once we sat down, she told us we could start on the buffet. We didn't realize they were only offering a buffet for lunch but no problem. She also asked if we wanted fresh garlic or regular naan and if we wanted mango lassi. We went with garlic naan and skipped on the lassi just because we wanted to see how the food was first. 
We basically tried all the meat options and many of the vegetarian options and there wasn't a single dish we didn't like. They all had incredible flavor and you could tell everything was really fresh and constantly having the temperature checked. Forgive me, I forgot basically all the names as I just started getting into Indian cuisine, Sorry! But everything was delicious.

Just a week ago I went to another 4.5 star Indian Buffet off Sahara and there's no comparison - Delhi's so much better and I need to revisit Mint to see if it unseats it but I""m pretty sure it does.

Their lunch buffet selection is ridiculous with Biriyani, Goat Cury, Chicken Curry, Tandori, and many other specialties.  They switch it up as I've been a few times and everything is done better than Mt Everest Indian.  The goat curry here had better flavor and was more tender.   When they bring you the naan, it's piping hot made to order chock full of garlic.  I went to play a poker tournament after and this definitely helped me force a couple folds.

They have a great check in deal where you get a free Lassi or soda - gotta go with the Mango Lassi.

I was dining by myself so I went with the vegetable thali and mango lassi which is free if you check into yelp. My mango lassi was made in a blender at the bar so I could hear it being made from where I was sitting. The mango lassi was icy and tasted watered down. This was the first non creamy mango lassi I have had. 

The samosa filling was well seasoned, not too greasy, but breading was a tad thick. It took 45 minutes for my vegetable thali to come. I am used to Indian restaurants being abnormally fast. 

The presentation of the thali was classy and each dish tasted freshly made. My favorites were the malai kofta and the Kashmir sabji, the rest I could have done without. The malai kofta was well executed and the creaminess of the curry and aromatic spices worked harmoniously. First time I have had the Kashmir sabji and the assorted vegetables seasoned with herbs and spices pairs well with the richness of the malai kofta.  

All the food I had was thoughtfully prepared and freshly made. Hari seems to genuinely care about his customers. After finding out i didn't like my mango lassi he made me another one without the ice.

Came at 5 and was pleased to see more people in the restaurant than the last time we where here. Feels more comforting personally.  

My partner ordered the non vegetarian Dahl thali **(that take out menu, in restaurant menu and online menu all have different items listed for this- be warned) **  which was a great way to try a lot of different items. They serve you small portions dishes, plus rice, naan and a yogurt dip. Such a great deal to try new food. The menu said dessert was part of it but it never came. Out of all the dishes the only one that he didn't like was the lentils. Was too salty. Not sure it that's how it's supposed to be or if it just got over seasoned. 


I ordered whipped spinach with cheese, and goat curry at a spicy level of 7 andJeera Rice( if you never had this before, I HIGHLY recommend this)  and of course garlic naan. What came to the table was different. I got a different goat dish instead of the curry ( tomato base that was thin and soupy) and with very little spice. (My boyfriend order his spice lever at 5 and was stronger than my dishes)  new cook, different cook, waiter miss heard me??  I didn't complain because I hate that at restaurants and didn't want to waste the food. It was still good ( not amazing like last time but again, I got the wrong dish) different chef, off night? 
 
No dessert for the boyfriend 
I was served the wrong dish

Lunch buffet was all you can eat for $9.99. Great deal!

Restaurant was big and spacious so you aren't on top of one another. Service is meh. The servers really don't know the food too well. I was quite nervous eating there because I have a tomato allergy. Server didn't know the sauces too well so I had to be selective on what to eat. Sucks but at least I was smart in my food picking. I asked the server what was in the sauce like spices and such and all he kept saying was ""it's cream based"" over and over. Like I get that but what else is in it???? At least go ask a manager or a cook?!

Malai Kofti (fried vegetable balls in sauce) was my favorite part of the meal. A sauce unlike I have had in a while with yummy fried veggies in it. All around amazing.

The vegetable Samosa I expected more. The flaky part was ok but the vegetable middle wasn't what I was expecting: I just dipped it in the Malai Kofti sauce and it tasted better lol

Basmati rice was simple like most places. Hard to mess up. Mixed it with some goat stew and it came out great.

I admit I didn't hold out much hope, but it's a cuisine of which we are mutually fond, and I figured we could find SOMETHING good on the menu.

Yee hah! Turns out they featured the ubiquitous lunchtime buffet, so we could try it all. 
The tandoori chicken was surprisingly moist, the butter chicken rich and tasty, and the curry had a satisfying kick. There were lots of vegetarian options involving rice, lentils, spinach, etc., which I never got to. Not because I don't like them; I happen to believe that All Foods Matter, but I had slurped up so much sauce with that nice hot naan, that I had to tap out. Did manage to wash down a big glop of sweetened carrots that made a fine, if unintended, dessert.

Might have been a four star, but it's getting five because there was actual meat in all those steam table trays, not just the sauce with a few barely detectable chunks as is too often the case at Indian buffets. Good job.

Knowing that these places on the strip weren't worth their prices but wondering what other joints still offer good food, good service, and nice atmosphere (because, hey, you're vacationing in Vegas and you don't need to be slumming it at some filthy ethnic place to save $10 you'll just lose on a side bet anyways). Well, this is the answer. Do not look at any other reviews because New Dehli is where you want to go.

Just a few months old, it has a slew of positive reviews and -- as great as the food was (there is a mango lassi free with your check in that you MUST get) -- the pride the staff/owners put into the restaurant is apparent with every detail of the restaurant. From the decor to the menu to the EXCELLENT service, New Dehli is what comes to mind (for me, at least) when we talk about ""shopping local"". This is their restaurant and I saw in my visit that the owners truly care about this place. These folks took out a space in a shopping center (plenty of parking!) and have created a truly sincere dining experience. Maybe it's not something I can explain well -- but if you'd like to understand, swing by New Dehli on a Thursday evening and take in the experience.

There's no rice or no bread that comes with the dish(On their website there is some bread that seems to accompany the dish). Now I wouldn't be upset if this was less than $10, but for $15 this is absolutely absurd. If you want something similar you can just go to Curry Zen and for $10 you get far more food for the money.

My Butter Chicken was not the best I've ever had, but it was delicious with the perfect amount of spice.  My nephew said that his Tikka Masala was the best he's ever had.  He lives in Vegas and commented that he has a new ""go to place"" for Indian.  Our vegetable samosa's were very nice as well, but the reason I have to give five stars is because of the Chicken Pakora's.  They had the perfect amount of breading in comparison to the chicken.  The outside was just crispy enough, and the chicken on the inside was moist, tender, and juicy.

3837745,2016-03-20,1,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"The food was incredible. Flavorful, very warm, aromatic, and massive in portion. 

I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Garlic Naan, Steamed Rice, and the Aloo Tikki (Must be a minimum of $25.00 to order for delivery). Everything was packed clean and tight, no spills and no issues. 

The Chicken Tikka Masala is one of their most popular menu options. Now I know why. Creamy, smooth, rich, and especially spicy (if you order it as such). A perfect consistency with large chunks of delicious chicken. The tomato is not overwhelming, the spices don't rule the flavor (saffron is especially nice), and the chicken has a great consistency. I ordered a side of steamed rice, which was incredible for the amount given at $3.00. I expected a tiny bowl, but instead received an entire 6 x 6 to-go box full. 

The Garlic Naan is good. The flavor is not especially strong, it's incredibly soft, not insanely chewy, but chewy enough; great to have just alone as a snack. The portion is large enough to be split between three people or more, and the texture is fluffy with that infamous smoothness of naan. I would honestly prefer regular naan, but that doesn't mean the garlic isn't especially tasty.

The Aloo Tikki numbers in two for $3.00, both about the circumference of a tennis ball. They are thick potatoes cakes, with a smooth interior and an especially crispy exterior. A little on the heavy side, but still delicious. They come with two sauces, one of which is a very close relative of a green avocado salsa, and the other a thick, sweet brown sauce. I have no idea what they are. I prefer them mixed together, because the green is especially spicy and the brown is a little too sweet. Combining or dual dipping evens them out perfectly.

Overall, the meal impressed me. I'm full with so many leftovers for tonight. Everything was absolutely wonderful and the delivery was so quick and efficient. I feel horrible, by the way. I ordered delivery and gave the girl the wrong amount for a tip. I wanted to give her $6.00 instead of $3.00. *Sigh*",2YOWAF4_uQZ3ToABzRh4hA,4,5,5,rdgE_2rHdRI1UsVVvUX5eA

3966774,2014-07-15,3,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"I wanted to try this lunch buffet since reading some friends' reviews and I went today.  It's taken the #1 spot in the Indian lunch buffet spot with one restaurant yet to go.

I was there early, about 11;15, and I was the first person in the restaurant.   There soon were several other customers.  It's a very large room with lots of tables laid out well and the buffet is a large area opposite the entrance.

With a check in on Yelp, you get either a mango lassi or a soda free.  It's a good deal for merely checking in.

I ordered garlic naan and then headed to the buffet.  The naan was good but I wish it had more of a garlic flavor.  For the first plate, I had chicken Biryani, a couple vegetable pakoras, a vegetable samosa, a piece of tandoori chicken, some chili chicken, soya badi, and some saag paneer.  Everything I had was very good and I noticed that almost all dishes had a spiciness that I liked.  Of these, the weakest dishes was the saag paneer.  The crust of the samosa was flaky and the filling was very good.  The soya badi was quite good.

For my second plate, I had squash, Navratan korma, chicken curry, and chana masala.  All of these were very good save the squash which was a little nondescript.  I also tried some of their raita which was good.  The chicken curry didn't have very much of a curry flavor but when the juices from the chana masala mixed with the curry juice, it became much better.

Finally, I went back and got one idli and put a small amount of tamarind chutney on it.  It had a soft texture and was good.  I was a but disappointed that they had no dhokla.  I had read Christopher S.' review and I was interested in trying something different.

Overall, this is a very solid buffet and moves to the top tier of Indian restaurants.  The price is now $10.99 but that's still very good considering the wide choice you have with their large buffet.

Service was very good!  Several times, someone stopped by to see how things were.  A woman stopped once and asked me if it was too spicy so they know that they spice their foods.  Plates were cleared before I came back each time.

This is another stop for after hiking when we go to an Indian buffet.  It's a great addition to the Indoian dining in Las Vegas.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,8,4,fE9h-aeFxOBflIur0AkJbA

4039395,2014-11-16,1,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"I came here today 45 minutes before their lunch buffet closed and it was a good experience. 

We were sat promptly as our party was already there. They have about 12 hot dishes that range from curries to rices and then a salad bar.

The stand outs were the chicken curry, goat curry, and the chicken tikka masala. They also gave our table two orders of garlic naan. The naan was piping hot and full of garlic.

I would say the amount of meat in the curries was minimal but given it was a buffet I understood. Plus the flavors of all of the curry dishes were each so delicious and unique that the sauce with naan was enough for me.

I'm used to having curry in a non AYCE setting and I don't know if I'll ever do that again. The value of the buffet was really good for the variety.

I also liked their fried onion fritters, the veggie samosas, and their rice and chicken dish. I don't know any of the names but everything was worth a try.

The staff was solid for a buffet as in those 45 minutes I had my drink refilled about 5 times. They also cleaned up our plates before I got back from each trip the buffet line

They also had this spice mix when you leave up front that was full of spices they used like dinner mints which was cool to try.

I like the value, the restaurant staff, the decor, and definitely the flavors. For $35 after tax for three people it's an excellent value and I'll return very soon.

4106861,2014-08-11,2,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"Norm K invited a bunch of Yelpers to eat here for the lunch buffet. I wasn't expecting my taste buds to be delighted at almost every bite or for everything here to taste good and fresh, but that's pretty much what I got.

You know the rule of thumb about places that largely serve their own demographic, right? Well, I got really excited when I walked in and saw tables and tables full of Indian customers. It's such a huge place that I'd almost call it a dining hall rather than a dining room, and there were plenty of tables available for our group. Wish the lighting wasn't so dim, but that's a minor issue.

Naan, either standard or garlic depending on what you ask for (I think the garlic actually gets too soggy, but table majority ruled), is brought out by servers as needed. The rest of the food and condiments are in the buffet line. Starting from the front of the line, you run meats, veggies, and sauces/desserts. I'll just list what I had:

- Tandoori chicken: the one without sauce; luckily, only a little dry as opposed to the considerably or ridiculously dry fare at other places.
- Chili chicken: reminiscent of some Chinese fried chicken offerings, but pretty sweet, not too spicy, and definitely fresh as opposed to what you might expect at an Asian buffet.
- Chicken curry: can't recall the flavor exactly, but I'm sure it was good.
- Chicken makhani: aka butter chicken, definitely a favorite of mine at Indian restaurants. Rich and delicious here as well.
- Goat curry: tasty, somewhat fatty, typical gaminess of goat meat. Delicious.
- Chicken biryani: chicken and rice dish, kinda sour but still not noticeably dry.
- Vegetable pakora: a fried vegetable dish, wasn't very special but could pair with something like the saag paneer
- Vegetable samosa: fried pastry stuffed with potato, good filling to crust ratio, crunchy on the outside and warm on the inside, not too spicy if at all spicy
- Saag paneer: creamy spinach with cheese. Didn't even pick up cheese until round 2, so I was pleasantly surprised. Tastes good until you get really full. ""Hey ma, I ate my veggies!""
- Navratan korma: curry with cheese and potato, or at least those were the only two I fished out of the buffet tray. Pretty tasty, worth it even for meat-eaters like myself.
- Tamarind sauce: sweet sauce that you can dip naan in. Helped to combat the sour taste when I accidentally bit into something unpalatably sour from the chicken biryani.
- Mint sauce: light, and as minty as you would reasonably expect. I didn't really try pairing this with as many of the dishes as I should have, but I'm sure it would complement something well.
- Gutab jamun: I probably have had this before, but I'll be darned if any place has made it this good. Great warm dessert dumpling in a sweet sauce. Wish I'd had room for more!
- Kheer: rice pudding available next to the fruit, mildly sweet and probably should be eaten before you overwhelm your mouth with gulab jamun

I haven't gone out of my way to try every Indian restaurant around my hometown of San Jose or around the Vegas area, but Delhi Indian Cuisine serves through and through the best Indian food that I've had so far, period. The buffet thing is icing on the cake as it hardly detracted from the quality and was a tremendous value at $11. Fair warning, though: it was a busy Sunday lunch, and I don't know if the weekday holds up. Go as early as you can for freshness, perhaps?",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,4,4,5,vaYoB7xsH2L8wcW8MG3WjQ

Simply put, Delhi Indian Cuisine is average if not slightly above.  I went with a group of Yelpers for a Sunday lunch buffet.  I was impressed by the overall number of dishes to try and found the $10.99 price to be quite fair.  Not being one to shy away from new foods, I tried a sampling of nearly all the options Delhi has to offer from meat dishes to vegetarian.  I even tried the curried goat, a protein new to me.  It wasn't bad but there was nothing about it that made me think ""oh my goodness, this is awesome."" In fact, that is true for basically everything I tried.  There was nothing that I wanted to push aside but there was also nothing I wanted to go back up to serve up seconds of.  I had their chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala which are typically my favorites at an Indian restaurant.  Both were good just not spectacular.  My biggest disappointment was the saag paneer.  I got a nice healthy scoop of saag but had trouble finding the paneer.  Its a good thing I like creamed spinach because that is about all it was.  At least on my plate.  I did see others with paneer on their plates so maybe I just got the bottom of the barrel before it was refilled.  At the other end of the buffet bar, I did like the desserts quite a lot.  I tried and thoroughly enjoyed the galub jamun and the syrup those little dough balls are in.  There was a rice porridge or pudding of sorts that was tasty too.  Sweet, cool and refreshing on a balmy summers afternoon.  In the end, the food was fine but the company was better.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,1,3,-SajRsO8IFGASiYnFHHD0w

My person favorites were Tandoori chicken, chicken curry and butter chicken (that's what my coworker Safi said it was called) I was super impressed by everything! The customer service was great; the food was delicious and hot. For desert we had Gajar Ka Halwaw, my coworker loves this stuff!

We will be back!

4326974,2016-02-22,4,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"I love Indian food, definitely a favorite cuisine for me. I keep coming back to Delhi and its becoming my new favorite indian restaurant in town. 

It seems this place must do the majority of business during their lunch buffet because each time we have dined in the evening it's been dead. I don't mind a quiet restaurant...actually I prefer to feel like I have a restaurant all to my self but it makes me worried that somehow this restaurant is hurting. I hope not! I would hate to see another great Indian restaurant close. 

The service here is great, the owner is always floating around and managing every aspect. You can tell he is passionate about his restaurant and it really shines through the service and food. 

The Food

Chicken Tikka Masala
Amazing. Perfect balance of cream, tomato and masala spices. Not too oily and great depth of flavor. Chicken is succulent and juicy, only gripe is there is not enough chicken but I deal with it because their sauce is that good.

Naan
Airy pockets with doughy edges and just the perfect amount of seasonings. Heavenly! Always so fresh and so darn addicting and their garlic version is a standout. 

Tandoori 
Have tried both chicken and shrimp. By far my favorite was the shrimp. I've always preferred a shrimp tandoori anyway because there is nothing more visually appetizing than large juicy shrimp and fresh onions and lemons sitting atop a sizzling hot plate. Those sexy soft hissing and popping noises get me every time. 


Matter Paneer 
Well I have had better IMO but it wasn't bad. I think it's too forward with tomato and I'm searching for more creamy notes. Which is silly when you think about it, there is paneer in there and that should somehow be enough, maybe a touch more cream would make it better? I don't know. 

Malai kofta 
Sauce 10! Dumplings 0! Way too dense and I like when they are shaped into round balls instead of those football shaped things. I'm totally just whining here, shape shouldn't matter but the shape coupled with how dense they were just didn't do it for me. But that sauce though! Their cashew based sauces are amazing. 

Gulab Jamun
Again another too dense item but I don't hold that against them. I've experienced the same dense issue at other restaurants regarding this dessert. Maybe was cooked or sitting too long? Not sure.

Mango lassi
Dare I say this was made with canned mango? I hope I'm wrong here but I'm pretty sure it wasn't fresh mango. Still tasty nonetheless especially as the alcoholic version. 

All in all this place is excellent. Great dishes full of flavor and wonderful attentive service. I can't really ask for more!",IGBilULpgNHfKitLfrs7Hw,6,7,5,HqqpF-uActjF8DDnsCwSFw

I have came to this place several times, and I return every time I get bored of bland everyday food, and I need spicy flavors with the kind of kick that jolts me out of my culinary boredom. For that effect I specially recommend the Chicken Makhani and Malai Kofta; I usually don't care much for the meat and just get the sauce and dip the Biryani garlic bread in it, then I frantically reach for my ice cold Coke (keep it close).

4367452,2015-08-19,1,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"This buffet is very average. There were some items I liked and some that I didn't, but nothing wowed me. 

The sitting area is large and they can hold a good volume of people. The staff was nice, but a little disorganized. We had to let a couple people know before we actually got our naan. The ambiance is very casual and it makes for a nice lunch place.

In the appetizers, the Tandoori Chicken was cold on the outside from sitting out so long and only tasted okay. The Shish Kabob was tasty, but not one of the kinds that I could keep eating. I had a couple pieces and was done. The Samosa, I would rave about. Though the filling had a little too much peas for my taste, they were really yummy. In most samosas, my favorite part is the little end where there is no filling and the dough is crunchy, and in this samosa, all of the dough tasted like that edge piece. Simply wonderful!

One really good thing about this place is that they deliver fresh naan to your table. Other buffets have the naan cut up as part of the buffet, but when there isn't a high turn around, you know those naans have been sitting for a while. Not the case at this place, they offered us plain or butter, but we asked for garlic and they obliged. It did take a little while for the naan to actually come out after we had ordered it, but it more than made up for the wait with the quality. 

The main dishes is where I was most disappointed with this buffet. Chicken Makhani was pretty good. It had good layers of flavor. Unfortunately, at they tray seemed like the chicken pieces were either very small or had been picked through by other guests. The Chicken Curry had no flavor, and I only ate a little. There were a couple of vegetarian options, which was good to see for the vegetarian folk out there. I'm not a fan of brinjal, so I didn't try that, but I did try the Chana Masala, which was decent, although, not my favorite. All in all, there was nothing super exciting in terms of the main dishes.

For desert, I tried both the Gulab Jamun and the Kheer. The Kheer wasn't sweet enough for my taste. The Gulab Jamun, on the other hand, was pretty spot on. They were nice and warm too!

Overall, this buffet did not hold up to its reputation, but it was a good value for the amount of food that you get for the price you pay.",IM5f9bNoY_UrrQli1O9Riw,4,1,3,BMpyZV0B4hCYXf3MfHzGTA

I started going to this place about 2 months ago , had a gigantic biryani and mango lassi , the chef specializes in the Mango lassi as far as I am concerned! Fan ever since .
First time I went there for the buffet , the garlic bread , the mushroom were fantastic , not to mention the chicken and mutton .I had a feast , no pun intended . Only regret that day was, maybe  I shouldn`t have eaten that much .But by another 3 days the regret vanished and i duly returned ,this time ,they had another special variety of chicken , I am blanking on the name , but i was good , if you end up there just look and sausage like chicken roll,it`s really good . 
When I am not going to this one ,I am probably going to some other one :) .Imagine the embarrassment at showing up at the same buffet ,every other day ! And have to say most of them are similarly priced and probably have similar food range ,but after multiple sampling at other indian buffets I have to say that this one has more options,maybe a little bit cleaner and definitely the most spacious  in town. And would recommend it to anyone who wants to get away from ridiculously priced buffet at the big nightclub restaurants , as long as you like indian food .
As for the negative stuffs , the ambience could be better , i mean they could decorate the walls a little bit better and play some decent music like some upscale places.Sometimes they have hard time catching up with the demand supply thing but i guess this being a new place ,its something they can work on.And  yes sometimes ,there is just that little extra oil floating around in the nan-bread or the curries, again something they can work on .All in all ,for an indian buffet ,it`s bang for bucks.

We had the lunch buffet, and I was surprised by the variety of the different foods. Of course our first question to the owner was if the meat is halal or not, and it was!! *halal alert* 

The food was delicious, everything from the reshmi kabob to the warm gajar ka halwa. They had chicken tandoori (flavorful!), goat biryani, channa masala, and the list can keep going on and on. We also ordered garlic naan (including in the 10$ buffet price) and it honestly seemed to come right out of the oven! I couldn't get enough of the chicken tikka masala, and the Navrata korma (I think that's the name? LOL). The sauce (Salan) was creamy and hot. 

It became obvious that this place is going to be very popular VERY soon. We talked to the owner, and he was very helpful. He told us that although the main items stay the same during the lunch buffet, sometimes the dessert (mithai) might change, and maybe the lentil curry (daal). 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite fancy and quiet on the day that we went... But they have a very nice setup. 

I'm itching to come back again! :)

Delhi came recommended to us by a British friend who had spent two years in India as ""the best Indian food I've had in America."" That's high praise from someone from the two Indian food capitals of the world (and perhaps having a palate more similar to an American than a native Indian)

The service was almost hilariously attentive since we walked through the door right as the place opened for dinner and it was all but empty.  I love a full water glass though, so even though being asked 10 times during dinner was a bit of an interruption, I can't complain.

I foolishly filled up on delicious samosas at the beginning of our meal, but they were so tasty I can't be sad.  The vegetarian dumpling curry we had was surprisingly tasty.  The cashews in the sauce added such rich, thick, depth of flavor.  It is one of those dishes that makes you think, yeah, this is what I'd eat if I were vegetarian, and I wouldn't miss meat one bit.  ...But, speaking of meat, the butter chicken was an absolute dream. I've never had such perfectly cooked chicken in a curry.

The naan was also on point with a yummy chewy top and a crispy bottom.


To sum up how good the food was, my dining partner and I ended up eating so much of it we promptly went home and took a nap.  Bravo, Delhi Indian Cuisine, bravo.",OY2yolWFaDlrta9JJmYRYQ,6,0,5,BXJ-MIanJDqbCcdONtHrZQ

4750680,2016-03-31,1,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"Funny enough, I thought I knew all the Indian restaurants near UNLV. But this was new. The exterior is unassuming enough and fits into the surrounding businesses like a leaf on grass. But once you enter inside it looks pretty nice and clean. What I noticed was how big this place was. My go to place for Indian is Everest, but my friend told me to try this place and I did.

The service is quiet but friendly and very quick. I give the food a 3-3.5 star but the service moves it over.

Ok, stop your yammering Andrew. What about the grub? The food is actually spicier than most other Indian restaurants I been to. The butter chicken is probably the tamest entree there. Well, that and the pre-requisite tandoori chicken. My favorite go to is always tandoori chicken and goat. And that's what I went for. The tandoori chicken was pretty dry. I wasn't sure if it was the Hoover Dam drought effects but i shrugged that off and notched it against Delhi. The goat is very tender and tasty. The butter chicken is very delicious. I also had the other spiced chickens like curry. It was good but not memorable enough for me to remember much about that foul. The eggplant was cooked well but man oh man it had some spice to it. A bit too much for a rather bland vegetable if you ask me. Sometimes the veggie is best left natural with a bit of seasoning. To me, this is one of them.

My regular rice pudding dessert was a bit different, it had vermicelli noodle bits in it....glass noodle for the noodlers out there. The fruit and desserts were minimal. If you like sweets, they had this glutinous ball that was swimming in honey water. Sweet and delicate. Try it.

I did not eat the different varieties of rice there but it looked good enough. The nan bread was brought out piping hot and had garlic and cilantro in it. It was fresh and tasted great, especially after dipping it in the butter chicken sauce.

AYCE lunch was about $10. There is quite a variety but I think I will stick closer to home and go to Everest.

Business seemed pretty slow so I hope it was because we lunched at 1:30.

I will mention one more thing. There were a little too many black things in the rice pudding. Maybe 2. Imma tell myself that it was some sort of spice. It wasn't a bug. I rubbed it on the table and it was more like lint. A bug would break apart. The better half thinks it's spice so I'll go by that. She did notice that it had quite a bit of it on the tray as well. I am Chinese but an extra added bonus of tiny bug is persona non grata.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,4,4,4,Co5d2WCdnIp2YxImVP8rGw

Little did we know that we would end up waiting for 10 minutes before we were even given water and a chance to order, and another 50 minutes before our food would arrive.  And the restaurant was only half full!  After we finished eating, we called for the check and again, we were made to wait as we watched the guy who promised to bring us the check run around, refilling the potpourri bowl and ringing other customers up..basically doing anything but bringing us the check.  

I guess the food was decent enough.  But I don't care how decent your food is, if you can't get your food out within a reasonable amount of time when your restaurant is only HALF full, then you've got an issue and you can forget about ever attracting your customers back.  As such, we could have stayed at our first choice restaurant and still ended up eating at around the same time.

I have my favorite spot for that food and I am just not messing with it. Indian lunch buffet is one such thing, but after hearing some love from trusted friends, I reluctantly shook up our routine and tried out this new spot. 

It's a large open room so it's probably a better bet if you are dining with a large group as the other better buffets are rather small dining rooms. Size of the buffet is fairly good as there were 16 hot dishes, some chutney, lettuce, cucumbers, some fruit and kheer. 

We got the garlic naan, which I thought was superb and had nice garlicky flavor. 

All the food was solid, but there were a few standout dishes for me. Tandoori chicken was juicy and I appreciate these aren't huge hormone large pieces. The goat curry had a nice flavor in the sauce, though quite a bit of bones to navigate., Saag paneer was solid, a bit creamier than average. The one surprise for me is the malai kofta. In the past, I've disliked this dish at other places, but I loved it here because of the texture of the kofta. I find some places it just is dry and dough-y and full of blah, but the texture of this is soft and creamy even. There wasn't a label for it, but it was sort've cut up pieces of sausage similar to a lulu kebab that had a nice gingerly flavor to it that was awesome wrapped in naan with chutney. The yellow daal was really tasty - probably my favorite one I've had in the recent years. 

I see that there are pics of the Himalayas and seen some mention of there being Nepalese owners and Indian owners so it's reflected in the way food is flavored. I find Napalese is less spicy and more a balance with savory and sweet. 

Service was decent. We had our drinks refilled and the people were friendly. There's a current check in for a lassi or soda so we took advantage and got a free mango lassi which was yummy. 

I think this matches my usual standby in quality so I'm glad we went. I think I will alternate between this place and Mint depending on the type of Indian I feel like having.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,6,4,CDid-alXl7ly_F7lNeBKvQ

If you can read more than one word, then read on my friend cause this is one of the best Indian restaurants that I've been to. 

Some hobknobs might find the location a bit shady, but the interior of the restaurant is clean and well put together and makes you forget about all the bums across the street. Whataraya gonna do? Amirite?

This place has only been opened a week or so. The service here was good. While the waiters were new and seemed untrained in the usual customer service/waiter chatter, (family owned restaurant I assume?), they were still very polite and attentive, and boxed our food to-go for us. No complaints from me, they refilled my water glass often as I slew down all that spicy curry.

Good news for all vegetarians, half the menu is vegetarian based, which put me in a chipper mood right off the bat when we entered. They also have multiple chicken and lamb entrees if you're still craving the meat food. For me not actually being a big fan of curry, the food was amazing and I ate till I was beyond stuffed. I forgot the names of the dishes we selected, but I had a nine vegatable combo with mild spicy creme curry and my boyfriend had the traditional chicken curry. Both were just right in hotness and didn't leave a chalky taste in my mouth like most curry does.

The grand finaleeeee....Naan bread. mmm yes, that's right. the garlic naan bread here is so delicious I just wanted to go adopt a new puppy or something. Was so good that I got another frisbee shaped bread slice to-go.

With all that and an extra bowl of rice, the price for two was pretty decent. We ate there during the dinner hours where they gave us a menu, but they also do a lunch buffet which I have yet to try.

The chicken curry seemed too watery to me.  The spices were off a little bit on the light side in all the dishes.   but overall, I liked it because of the large selection and the large dining area.  The AC was off so it was a bit muggy and uncomfortable.  Overall, based on the food alone, the taste is decent but not inspiring.  It's good because they put so much effort in it, but I don't think it's quite 4.5 stars.  I'd say closer to 3.5 to 4.",SyyYQfNQ4a4Lua5RBlggmQ,1,1,3,HnDqGqwLf2cEyM9v1gEdJA

The staff was very friendly and the Garlic Naan was really good. However, allot of the food tasted bland and lacked flavor altogether. The chicken curry lacked chicken and the flavor of the yogurt was overwhelming. The Saag, Samosa's and the Dal lacked flavor. The pakoras tasted stale and the rice in the Biryani was over cooked. 

The only two things good were the Garlic Naan and the desert, Galub Jamun. I see all the great reviews so maybe I just came on a day when the cook wasn't feeling it.",gmb3kMUn6PQUhercsSQKDg,1,0,3,kbqSX9fU1hCRxjka-vmdCg

5278845,2017-10-08,3,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"Tucked away in a large shopping plaza next to the Best Buy on Maryland Parkway Delhi Indian Cuisine originally opened its doors on January 1st 2014, and although the area around it may not be the most glamorous with vagrants roving both parking lots and nearby streets those in the neighborhood around noon would still do well to stop in for the all-you-can eat Buffet lunch.

Stacked against a lot of competition in Las Vegas but more than once voted Sin City's Best Indian Restaurant, the 11a-3p daily Buffet complimented by a large a la carte menu offered both day and night, guests entering Delhi Indian Cuisine will likely first be struck by the impressive size of a restaurant easily capable of accommodating more than one-hundred diners and although many may criticize Steam Tray food for one reason or another those arriving early can rest assured that everything offered is quite fresh while service is also very attentive.

Offering a full bar in addition to Beer and Wine, the ability to order off the menu at lunch also not typical of most Indian Lunch Buffets, it was after checking in at the hostess stand that a seat was offered along the right wall in a plush booth, both drinks and the full menu declined before selecting Garlic Naan and walking up to gather the first of five plates of Food.

Playing soothing music without video throughout the Restaurant, a significant departure from the loud volume and flashing Bollywood of Mount Everest or Paradise India on the West Side, it was shortly after returning to the table that a puffy round of Bread with lightly blistered edges emerged from the kitchen and with the smell of Garlic quickly filling the air it would be hard to name a better version of the dish found anywhere in the city, the opening quartet of Chicken all proving very well made with the Tandoori Leg and Wing both moist with good color while the Chili Chicken brought a lot of heat, but not so much that it was unpleasant.

Clearly labeling Vegetarian versus Omnivorous options, a large family of visiting Indians from London soon entering and speaking loudly about how good much of Dehli's Buffet was in comparison to those back home, it was with the faint linger of Curry on the lips that a second trip was made to the lengthy Buffet, a small bowl of Goat Curry as usual made difficult to eat by splintered Bones but otherwise funky and Fragrant while the Pakora and Samosa were fairly run of the mill, thus leaving room for the tender Turmeric-heavy Cauliflower and Potatoes as well as generous cubes of Chicken Breast served in Rice perfumed with Nutmeg, Cardamom and Bay Leaf.

Moving right to left and incidentally from Meat to Vegetables and Legumes, more than 50% of the buffet focused on the latter, fans of heat would do well to focus on Delhi's Navratan Korma with ""three types of Chiles"" according to the waitress while those looking for something a bit more subtle will be better off with Dal Makhani or Chana Masala, the former a fragrant Black Lentil Porridge while the later outperformed the Chicken version by being a bit thicker and a little more focused in flavor around tender Chickpeas.

Using creamy Palak Paneer as a topping to for the Naan after discovering a lack of Chutney on the Cold Bar, the Cheese about 3/4 melted and thus a nice consistency, it was as the meal neared its end that an inquiry was made about the Gajar Halwa seen in many pictures online, the apparently ""not every day"" Buffet item nonetheless prepared special at no extra charge and served piping hot with plenty of Cardamom but not a lot of extra sweetness, that side of dessert instead left to chilled Rice Pudding with subtle Saffron notes and globes of Gulab Jamun soaked in sugary Syrup.

****Offering the Buffet for just $12.99 and full a la carte menu throughout the day it would be difficult to name a more accommodating Indian Restaurant in Las Vegas than Delhi Indian Cuisine, an early arrival assuring that everything is fresh while the staff easily outperforms even the Grand Buffets of the Strip in terms of friendliness and attention to guest's needs.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,6,4,nCTJWk7iK-CnbQ8rQ7FoYg

Mango Lassi:
The color was a bit off-putting. It was very orange. It didn't quite taste like what I've had at other Indian restaurants. This tasted artificial. 2/5

Papadum:
Perfect cracker. But what makes this exceptionally good were the sauces: tamarind and mint. Their sauces are better than anyone else's. 5/5

Garlic Naan:
This is my favorite. I can eat this stuff by itself. Warm, soft, buttery and garlicky goodness. I'm making myself want garlic naan by what I just said. 5/5

Prawn Korma:
The sauce was a bit garlicky and creamy. It has some spicy kick to it. I wish this dish had more prawns since it is in fact PRAWN korma. 4/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,12,11,4,dx4QR-p4TMxqMsnnPbwfPA

       - Value - This is probably the cheapest Indian buffet in town.
       - Quality - This ranks as one of the top Indian buffets I've had. Moist chicken/goat and good curry. What more can you ask for?
       - Service - They're absent from the front a lot of times, but when they do come over, they're very friendly.
       - Asian Influence - They have chow mein and chili chicken. I guess it adds variety, lol.
**Price**
       - Lunch Buffet $9.99
**Ordered**
       - Garlic Naan - I suggest requesting the garlic naan or they might give you the regular naan instead.
       - Tandori Chicken - Flavorful as ever cooked in a clay oven.
       - Chili Chicken - One of their Asian tasting entrees. It wasn't too spicy. A little salty from the sauce, but good otherwise.
       - Chicken Makhani - Chicken + Curry + Butter = Delicious. The chicken wasn't too dry and the curry was as buttery delicious as ever.
       - Chicken Saag - I prefer the makhani, but this adds variety to my plate.
       - Goat Curry - The goat is fall off the bone tender. A must try.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice lunch Indian buffet. It's a great deal!",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,3,0,4,Xcii9VcD_ca3de9V7lhB8w

Before i start i would like to say that i am vegetarian and i am only saying from this perspective. when we were there on Saturday for dinner it was nice and comforting everything was on point so we decided to return today for lunch buffet! But no it was a wrong choice this time. It is the worst buffet that i ever had in US. the food waa not fresh and it tastes pathetic. 
sambar was as thick as a gravy of shahi paneer, punjabi kadi was as sour as lemon and it is super thick too with no dumplings in it. 
then we tried kofta and its same no taste: very thich and same with yellow daal. BTW there were few more (aloo matar,corn saag) and they were equally horrible. we ordered breads and they were also not properly cooked we have to ask our server to cook it properly. Mind it we didnt had any trouble yesterday over the dinner. When we informed about our disappointed to the management they started giving diffuse excuses and just said sorry!

i dont think the sorry was sincere ! 
i have grew in delhi and i know how the delhi food tastes! i am not returning back again and will not advise anyone!",7g4xs47OB2Y1Mp-VmkhmNQ,0,0,2,jOy5dYrDPkqVPJi9Z9FiuQ

The naan was perfect. I like the garlic naan best but either way, you're winning. We had chicken vindaloo and a lamb dish. Both were terrific. Plus a full bar and they know how to pour a drink!

After seeing the great reviews, I knew we had to check Delhi out. We came for the lunch buffet on a weekday and it was not overly crowded (which was nice). The buffet was large with an extensive selection of dishes. Most of the food was quite good, with the spicy chicken curry being the tastiest option (in my opinion). They also had a large variety of vegetarian options if that is something you are looking for. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have chai tea on the buffet, nor did they have my favorite Indian dessert (the rice pudding... yum)... but apparently the selection changes from day to day, so maybe we came on an off day.

5640726,2014-10-01,0,3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA,"Delhi Indian Cuisine was the second Indian buffet that we tried during our last trip to Vegas. It is located not too far from the south end of the strip so location and accessibility was not a problem. Upon entering my first impression was that the place seemed pretty inviting. It was spacious with the buffet nicely spread out along the far end, tables nicely spaced apart so after having eaten in Mount Everest the previous day this was a welcome change.

The buffet again has all the standard items that you will find in an Indian buffet. Appetizers included tandoori chicken, vegetable pakodas (vegetable fritters) and samosa (puff pastry with potato filling). Entrees included butter chicken, goat curry, saag, rice, biryani and noodles. Desert included gajar ka halwa (carrot pudding) and kheer (sweetened rice pudding with milk). Taste wise what stood out to me was that everything was good but not great. Well the biryani and naan (provided fresh on the table) were both excellent but all the entrees were enjoyable but nothing popped out. The deserts could have been better. The gajar ka halwa cried out for some more mava (heavy cream) and the kheer for more sugar. Obviously they were made keeping the health conscience, not too sweet regulars in mind (another resturant which was full of locals). 

Service was good, all our plates were cleared promptly and price wise it was $10.99 which is pretty much standard for Indian buffets.

Overall I feel that the food surely needs a shot in the arm, but considering the overall package of location, decor, service and value for money a repeat visit is surely on the cards during our next visit.",HdrdiwMYkhWI49lmNPeziA,2,0,4,k4PH9hny6RGHe7nMIz2BTA

Located in a small shopping plaza, it was pretty empty when our party of 7 arrived so no problems with seating. Later more families came, predominantly Indian which is always a sign of authenticity. The goat curry was fantastic. They had a wide variety of lassis including strawberry, cherry and lychee which the kids enjoyed. We ordered all of the dishes mild for the picky eaters in our group but I was happy to find that some dishes were more on the spicy side. Usually have to order extra rice and naan but the portions here were good sized and ended up with leftovers. The manager was very friendly and helpful and came to our table many times to check up on us. I had ordered a gulab jamun to go and was pleasantly surprised later when he doubled my order for free.

BUT after yelp sending me multiple emails encouraging me to review, I figure hell why not. I ordered delivery from this restaurant and fought with myself if $50 was worth the price of instant satisfaction and laziness. $6 for delivery charge PLUS extra for taxes made two dishes and a small side salad the price of what two people could pay for a substantial dinner out together. I ordered the cucumber salad--- that listed every ingredient. Or so I thought. So to my disappointment when the salad arrived and was covered in cilantro I was pretty pissed. I am in the group of ultimate cilantro haters , and as I have started accepting it in sauces such as curries usually in Indian and Thai foods, I CAN NOT eat it raw. It makes me want to puke. So the $5 salad was inedible for me. Pissed no1. 
I ordered online - next the buckwheat bread. Knowing it may be weird and definitely unconventional I still went for it and asked if they could add garlic and butter to it - as a side note and request in the box provided online. When I got the bread it was plain, slimey, and just gross. Pissed no2. Finally I am a HUGE Indian food eater and I usually order the same things when I eat Indian. I could call myself a chicken vindaloo expert at this point. Hands down the worst chicken vindaloo I have ever had anywhere. In many states, in many cities as I travel for work. Not only was the chicken vindaloo just not authentic or good at that, it was $15+ super overpriced as usually people order more than one dish at an Indian restaurant to get small helpings of a few different plates. $15 per dish is a bit outlandishly overpriced. I ate half of the buckwheat bread, half of the vindaloo, none of the salad and about a quarter of the gigantic rice box they gave me. I spent $50 to be severely disappointed. Now I know no matter how lazy, I need to get up and drive to a better restaurant. 
Sorry, I usually don't complain. But this was just a terrible experience and a complete waste of way too much money. Pissed.",UjWDaR76xTu_pOE0jsg--g,2,0,2,4mMoNSQwujBGBJH8Cefppw

The customer service was great; because the three of us we're foreign to Indian Cuisine we had many question on what we were eating. The staff was very knowledgeable and able to answer our every question. 

The food? It was delicious!! No complaints on my end. The Butter Chicken was very well rounded. Nice and creamy curry, soft and moist chicken; put that on top of rice and you get a wombo combo! The complimentary Papadum was something else: the bread was nice and crispy, add one of the two sauces that came on the side and you get a sweet taste (black sauce) or a earthy savory taste (green sauce). We also ordered the Sev Puri which was a whole mouth full of flavor. The house made cracker was nice and crispy topped off with what seemed to be a jumbled yet organized mess of toppings and you get a nice high note of sour and spicy and a slight saltiness.

I would come back, maybe to try some new things or to check out the lunch buffet.",qorAM5n8eNMMBDTykaoCaQ,0,0,4,XrcweMTOTpTphHx7blmPDA
