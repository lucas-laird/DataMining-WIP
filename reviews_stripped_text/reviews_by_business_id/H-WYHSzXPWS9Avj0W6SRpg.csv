We arrived at 8:30 am for what we thought was a Saturday brunch offering champs, nope. Price is $21.95 but on Monday - Friday is $18.95...same food so why the increase? I can go to the Fiesta in Henderson with champs and better food for $8.99 Sat/Sun but we wanted to try something we thought was going to be an upgrade....lol what a joke. 


Food: everything I tried looked and tasted like food was leftover from the day before and reheated. 

Shrimps were all water logged, the crab legs had a brownish color to them with an odd taste. 

Pastries none..all offerings were donuts. They did have a fresh crepe bar, but then again looked very dry. I didn't want to stand on line for crepe paper.

To be honest though, I don't like paying full price for any buffett. I'm a vegetarian and I don't eat a ton so buffets just aren't a great value for me.

We had the weekend brunch buffet. I thought the selection was great. Again though, vegetarian here, so maybe meat eaters expect more? I get excited if there's more than salad. The omelet station was great. The French Toast was tasty. And when I was done with breakfast their asian section had some yummy options.

The best part was the friendliness of the staff though. From the cashier at the front, to the host, to the cooks and especially the lady bussing our section, the staff was smiling, helpful and all around lovely!",IOCjsg_z4O8lkAogZ9YcQQ,0,0,4,GNevH7xcAbPRcoobCL18pg

513814,2016-06-07,2,H-WYHSzXPWS9Avj0W6SRpg,"Mediocre buffet, but what really got me was that they have the manager calling people in like a Rosario night club.  I was reading the sign in the front of the restaurant about the multi-meal pass when the manager called me over stating something to the effect of ""I can give you better information than the sign."" I spoke with him and I honestly believe  I heard him say the meal pass was good for 24 hours. 

When I brought back my receipt the next day (within 24 hours), I was told it was not good for 24 hours and only lasted for the day before.  I spoke with the manager who at first acted like I never spoke with him (even though it was less than 24 hours ago) and swore he never said it was good for 24 hours.  

Be that as it may, I felt a little misled and felt he should have made that more clear when I spoke with him.  Had he let me simply read the sign as I was doing, I might not have had that misunderstanding.   His response was basically ""too bad"" and he refused to make any show of good faith on the misunderstanding.

1527797,2015-02-08,6,H-WYHSzXPWS9Avj0W6SRpg,"SHOCK AND AWE! Now one of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas!

As part of Excalibur's new ""adult"" theme they completely remodeled and remastered The Buffet At Excalibur! Gone are any ""draw in the kids"" ideas and it worked.

The Buffet reopened late last December 2014. This was not a makeover. It was a rethink everything and make it the best value on the strip - competitive with likes of Bellagio.

Check in is a breeze! Customer-centric, they quickly check your players club card to see if you qualify for any comps or discounts! SCORE! My meal was $4.00!

What I LOVED:

 - Bright, modern interior with bold but inviting jewel tone colors.
 - Ample space  between tables and booths!
 - Five diamond service. That is not an exaggeration. I was always being politely checked on and the staff is HAPPY and WELCOMING!
 - TWO Self Service drink stations! No waiting for water. And a full service bar!

FOOD!

- By reducing the number of offerings by about 25% they focus on the expensive and delicious things! 
 - Food is HOT! No gimmicky crap like cold or lukewarm food in a mini-skillet!
 - Everything I sampled was superb! The dim sum and pot stickers were served in authentic steamer baskets. The roast turkey wings were to die for. Especially with the portobello sauce with huge hunks of mushrooms.

 - Omelettes made to order! Nothing like a sassy mushroom, spinach and bacon omelette! 

 - The Mexican station had a delicious nopales (cactus) and the most unforgettably scrumptious seafood enchilada I ever tried. Not only HOT but SPICY HOT! SO GOOD! 

 - No stale rolls here! Breads were abundant and the onion rolls were divine.

 - A masterpiece of a desert station with fresh made crepes stuffed with every fresh fruit, berry or sauce you could imagine. REAL whipped cream. The flans were so good I had SIX! And the Molten chocolate cake SMORE cake had me licking my plate!  

 - Table service to clear the plates was unobtrusive and invisible. I scanned the entire place (and this was both visits) and never saw a dirty plate.

 - Immaculate clean bathrooms located right outside the entrance.

Most casinos have a chip shot breakfast buffet (it's hard to mess that up) and a fancy dinner buffet (they save the good stuff for night-time), but the lunch buffet is, more a less, a throwaway (the hotel guests are out on the town).

For 20 DOLLARS(!),  I expected more than a bland buffet.... no taco shells at the Mexican station, no gourmet meat dishes, too many sausage dishes, etc. One of those buffets where you have to search around looking for something you really want on your plate - they just didn't have much.

Good points: I like that I have to get my own drinks, a large dessert carousel, spacious dining room. Still, waaay waaay over-priced.

The food has been to temperature, the wait staff attentive and the price reasonable. The variety of items is vast for each meal - especially lunch and dinner. It is a well organized place - you can pay for your meal different ways (kiosk or a cashier) and then you are quickly taken to a table. The longest wait to be seated for me was 2 minutes. 

You can purchase an All Day pass for a low price which covers your meals - you get a wristband and simply walk in. 

It is a very clean place - the wait staff removes used plates efficiently and I've never seen any food on the floor. Maybe there were issues in the past and if so it appears that they exist no longer.

2133710,2017-12-02,0,H-WYHSzXPWS9Avj0W6SRpg,"Went to the Excalibur Buffet for dinner this past Friday night, December 1st and I must say, I was NOT happy, very disappointed indeed. So many things have change in just a matter of a few weeks. No more free draft beer or wine during Friday lunch nor any dinner throughout the week. Prices remain the same even though complimentary alcoholic beverages are a thing of the past. 

They added Rock Crab to the buffet and mixed that in with the Dungeness Crab. I believe this will prove to be a huge mistake and before long will impact those that frequent this particular buffet for quality food. The newly introduced Rock Crab Claws felt old, not stored properly, previously frozen and very grainy in your mouth while eating, the meat was not solid and plump such as the Dungeness Crab was. The steamed clams were also changed, very salty this time, I couldn't finish no more than 3 clams out of an entire cup. 

Sour cream continues to be watery, indicating not stored correctly and too warm on the line. Sour cream should NEVER EVER be watery, nor soupy in consistency, this indicates a risks of bacteria and an unfortunate and not so pleasant time later spent in the bathroom. There were no bread sticks, I asked and was told the shipment just didn't come in. Even the small tomatoes with mozzarella cheese were off in their flavor, I tried so hard but I just couldn't choke them down. 

There were no veal short ribs and no cold crab salad as usual. Both of these dishes were replaced by a low end seafood mixture (not fresh, over cooked) and some sort of last minute thought ham salad creation. In addition, the Chinese food was not cooked correctly, just the egg rolls, which is a standard staple on ANY Las Vegas Buffett, were incorrectly cooked, either over cooked or double cooked, again making them barely edible and not a pleasant experience indeed. Many of these new low end dishes that debuted and improperly cooked dishes, will remind you of what would normally be found on the lower end Mandalay Bay Buffet. 

Not sure what happened on this past Friday night but it was definitely a rough go for the Excalibur buffet on December 1st, 2017.  I'll give them another chance for sure and hope for the best, but if this buffet continues to spiral downward, I will have no choice but to research better dining opportunities here in a Vegas.",gjgOfC5f70ML3o4549gdTA,1,0,2,subnG_FHXzZIz8CWAWBPxw

The service from the small bar was great.

I come to Vegas pretty often and currently have a Gold players card, so I can skip the buffet lines, although I've only had to once because of the lack of crowd.
I haven't had dinner here recently, as I usually save my stomach for the ""good stuff"" in Vegas during dinner time. My last several trips to The Buffet at Excalibur have only been breakfast on the weekdays, or brunch on the weekends.
Let me just say, this place has greatly improved from 10 years ago (when I just turned 21). They have renovated the place, made it brighter, added a bit more variety to the menu and now have a egg/omelet station as well as a crepe station.
If you're here for breakfast/brunch, make sure to at least get the omelet and a crepe. Nothing else really matters here. I am pretty disappointed that they do not serve prime rib at breakfast or brunch, otherwise they would deserve at least a 3.5/4 star rating.
Although I haven't had to pay out of pocket for a while, the regular breakfast price is pretty reasonable compared to other buffets in the area.
I haven't been to every single buffet on the strip, but my order goes something like the following based on taste/price/variety:
1) Rio Seafood buffet (I think they just combined the 2 buffets now, but have 2 different price options, not MGM) Unlimited New Zealand lobster tail at dinner.
2) Wicked Spoon (Cosmo, not MGM)
3) Bellagio
4) Bacchanal (Caesar's Palace, not MGM)
5) Le Village (Paris, not MGM)
6) Aria
7) The Mirage
8) Planet Hollywood (Not MGM)
9) Mandalay Bay
10) Harrah's
11) The Excalibur
12) MGM (From here on down, it's not worth your money to go)
13) Luxor 
14) Monte Carlo (The only place I didn't feel full when I left)

I've also been to the buffet at ""M"", but you would need to drive to get there or take a cab/uber. That one is ranked up there with Bellagio. I'm just going to list that in all of my reviews for each buffet.",13L_l5JE_tYqt4UpmCNm1g,2,0,3,PncDrSinjoSW-PgDMPLKQw

Also, be sure to look for BOGO offers, we got ours from MyVegas online games. 

The brunch was $21.99 I believe and a great quality for that money. It's been ten years since I last ate at the Excalibur buffet and its good to see they recently remodeled. The food was good, all the basic breakfast foods, bacon, eggs, sausage, etc. plus they had lunch items out as well including Asian, Mexican, salads, etc.

~Someone who likes Rice Krispie treats?
~Free MyVegas meals

I had two free buffets through MyVegas, a breakfast and then a dinner so we set them up for two days in a row. I did not have high hopes because you don't really hear much about Excalibur's buffet and I've been there before without it being memorable. We were running real behind and our breakfast ended up being more of a brunch/lunch .  Shock of shockers it ended up being GREAT!

I was able to put together an AMAZING BLT with really good bacon from breakfast, bread out for toast, and spinach and cherry tomatoes from the salad bar.  I also put together a GREAT spinach, red onion, beet, craisins, pepitas & goat cheese salad.  The best thing is that they not only have a crepe station, but they have neverending rice krispie treats!  YUM!

After that, I was looking forward to the following evening for dinner so I was pretty disappointed when it was just not very good the next day.  There wasn't anything interesting to make a salad with although I did get them to drag out the craisins.  None of the meat was interesting, although they  had a beautiful display of roasted vegetables at the carving station that were only for show, not for eating.   Man, why doesn't any buffet do roasted vegetables like that???   That would be amazing!

2655539,2018-06-26,0,H-WYHSzXPWS9Avj0W6SRpg,"Honestly, the buffet at Excalibur is not bad.

We had a late breakfast here one Sunday and the only fault was the amount of time we had to wait in line to be seated. There were several large parties that had to be accommodated ahead of us. Yet, the restaurant is very large so there is plenty of seating. The price per person wasn't bad either and we appreciated that we didn't have to leave the hotel to eat.

PROS: Huge selection. Selection of meats are plentiful and quite tasty with carving section being the highlight. Eggs Benedict was very good and a surprise. Sushi, mostly California rolls, are fresh and flavorful. Mimosas are potent as is coffee. Fresh rolls and pastries are sweet. Large selection of soups. Crab salad available with a large selection of other salads. 

CONS: Fresh fruit is not very fresh. Scrambled eggs are very ""cafeteria style"" and have to be seasoned to taste. No bathrooms in restaurant so you have to exit the restaurant and go around the corner. 

Overall, you will find yourself with more than enough selections to fill more than one plate. Enjoy!",8KhlWlYgL-SvjUC1msqHig,1,1,4,vyAVdaBSLJ3INHVLOb2sbA

While the staff is nice and the place does look quite sexy and new, the food was very ""meh."" All of the stations lacked excitement and interesting good tasting options. Everything you would expect to be there was, but none of it was anything to brag about. It was all just okay. 

Keep in mind by ""all"" i mean ""what was there"" because this buffet is SMALL. Smaller than any other vegas one I have been to. You can walk the line very quickly as you browse past all of the options at a breakneck speed. 

There was a bar on the inside selling people more booze which I found to be weird. Also their beef was very weird as it was not only dry, but just unsavory. I really enjoyed the dumplings, but I had to serve myself and help rotate the dim-sum boxes because there was no one there to notice that all of the portions were missions. Also we had no idea that there was pizza until the end. 

Really the most disappointing thing might have been the desserts. They were all out of soft serve and they said it would be a while to get it replaced, which sucked. The pre-made pastries and dishes were very unexciting, like the rest of the food, and to top it all off the dude burnt a crape.

I must talk about the Friday and Saturday crab legs. THEY ARE DOING A DANGEROUS PRACTICE, AND NEED TO STOP IT! First of all, they RUIN the fun part of eating crab legs. Like any crab afficianado will tell you, the ""prize"" is getting to that last largest piece at the end of the leg, getting it out unbroken, and we want it to easily slide out. None of that happens, and here's why. First of all, they over-cook the crab to the point of it sticking to the inner shell, making it frustratingly (sometime virtually impossible!) difficcult to get the meat out. Also, their practice of over-cutting the large section into the meat and into those skinny thin bones is DANGEROUS! They need to stop it! If they want to cut into that large piece to make it easier to crack, fine. But, they should only nick the outside of the shell, not cut into the meat! By doing so, they are leaving a half-length tiny thin bone inside the last section. This gets eaten by almost everybody who doesn't realize it's there! That's when you'll gag and cough to get it out, or choke on it until you throw up in public. PLEASE EXCALIBUR BUFFET - STOP CUTTING INTO THE MEAT AND INNER BONE ON YOUR ""COURTESY CUT"" ON THE CRAB LEGS! You will end up in court fighting a case brought upon by somebody choking on that bone which YOU dangerously create by over-cutting the legs. 

100% self-serve, including drinks, means no servers. The only folks working there besides cashiers are the ones going around picking up your dishes. So, no tippping needed, since nobody is getting your refills or anything. Hint: go 1/2 hour before dinner, pay for lunch, then eat dinner. So, I cheat a little. I'm on a fixed income.

I got a pass for two free breakfast buffets here due to my lack of great customer service with the Excalibur hotels service! I decided hey why not it's free so of course I accepted and was willing to try them out! For starters if you are a platinum or I think Noir Mlife member you get to skip the line which is awesome within it self! Already off to a great start! Good selection was what I was most worried about based on previous reviews from my fellow Yelpers! Gladly every dish I had was seasoned properly and tasted excellent! Omelette station was a tad slow however this man is running 6 different skillets at once so he's the real MVP of the show here! Bartender was amazing as well with making my mimosas! I will definitely return! Oh yeah and you have to try out the Crepes station located in the desert section!

I think people come here to try it out, as it was just renovated. It is similar to the buffet at the Luxor. At $26, early Aug. 2015, it was rather expensive for the unremarkable offerings. As in: paella - wow, that was a joke. First the ladle was blazing hot to handle; next you have mussels that are unopened, meaning not fresh; then they have tiny, tiny brine to what, add flavor? Hardly saw a squid, medium sized shrimp, or clam...a useless paella.

The spaghetti is OK but soupy. The veal portions are ground veal, breaded. I did not even try the Chinese selection. I go to Vegas to eat and taste things I normally would not find in Los Angeles, Orange County, or the San Fran bay area. This buffet is a little below par because it should be grand! It is after all newly renovated. Their best offerings were the roast beef from the ""steamboat of beef"" (that's a new one, I have to look it up), and the made-to-order crepes, The dessert bar was not too bad.

Got in about 3:30pm for lunch price & already they were switching over to dinner food, which initally was frustrating as there was almost nothing out on the actual line to choose from, but soon enough the dinner food was brought out, fortunately because one of the very few redeeming things about this buffet was the crab legs which are only put out for dinner. They are cold & snow crab and not peeled like other places, they are whole but with a useless cut in each to help you open them in a mysterious way. These crab legs were watery & not nearly as good as the one's at the bellagio buffet, but were good enough that I ate 2 plates full of them and not much else. My husband had to ask a random cook behind the line for the melted butter because it was not put out, like are they hiding it or what? 
 I actually love that the drinks are self serve, if i want orange pop once, then milk, then water I'd rather get it myself than be judged by my waiter person for being a beverage weirdo. I wish all buffets had a self serve drink station.. Anyway, the rest of the food was pretty terrible, the mashed potatoes were atrocious, a label I don't give easily to one of my favorite and hard to screw up foods, but seriously, I almost spit out the one tiny bite i took. ugh! my husband tried the roast beef from the carvery & said it was pretty bad, he got a crepe from the dessert station & loved that though. I wasn't too impressed with the desserts, but they did appear to have some sugar free pies & stuff if you're into that sort of thing. Overall, I will probably not go back unless Im planning on just loading up on crab legs and am unable to get to a better place for them.

The buffet staff are very attentive and assist you promptly.  They have very cool ""pre-pay"" kiosks located to the left of the entrance, which allows to pay ahead of time and go straight to the hostess line, very nice for those busy days.

The food is excellent for the price you're paying, you have a very good variety to choose from, and they have an all day crepe station, which is nice too!  You have to consider the price you're paying for what you're getting in return and the food selection and quality is in line if not better than what you're paying for.  

I highly recommend the ""all-day"" pass, it's a great value! Plus it comes with a wrist band that grants you priority seating, which is an excellent perk.  The all-day pass is a great value, especially when you want that extra money in your pocket to gamble with.

Another nice amenity about the buffet is that the drink stations are ""all about you,"" as well, they are completely self serve so you don't have to wait for a waiter or waitress to bring you your drinks, that's terrific.

The new interior design is fresh, modern, and way more appealing than the old buffet. They even ditched the old ""Round Table Buffet"" name for ""The Buffet at Excalibur."" The inside is pretty nice and the layout is basically just a straight line of stations where you can get food from standard buffet cuisines including the Asian, Italian, Latin, a carvery (has various cuts of meats), salads, seafood, and there is even a bar! The desserts station is located near the entrance so you can't miss it.

The food selection was decent, but I was able to see everything within 2 rounds of getting food. The seafood selection is nice since there are shrimps, crawfish, and crab legs. One thing to note is that the shrimp is not fully peeled for you unlike in some other buffets. The seafood paella is also hard to eat because the shrimp still has the shell and head! Their sushi selection consists of California rolls with or without masago, vegetable rolls, and I think there was spicy tuna. The sushi was above average compared to other buffets. 

High lights I found were the salmon, crab legs, and the made to order crepes from the dessert station. You can get nutella, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapples, and powdered sugar along with your crepe! The only downer is that the crepe is not as crispy as I would like it, but that's not a deal breaker for me. You can also get your crab legs steamed, but there is generally a line for that so just be warned. 

There is a bar station located and you can get free champagne and mimosas along with your meal. All the other drinks will cost you additional money. 

Overall, I'd say you guys should give this place a try if you like going to buffets. It isn't the best, but it also isn't the worse. And believe me, it is much better than what it used to be.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,12,4,3,qqXpgW0nyvrdfeapAlfkaA

3729481,2017-10-31,1,H-WYHSzXPWS9Avj0W6SRpg,"What a disapointment our lunch buffet at Excalibur was today. We were celebrating my birthday, so instead of our usual locals' casino buffet, we decided to splurge and go to Excalibur on the Strip. Big mistake! We'd been a couple of times in the last year or two, since they upgraded their buffet, and it was pretty good then-- better the first time than the second. This time was not great at all. The salads were really bland, the carving station had turkey, ham, and sausage (not salmon, which I could have sworn the website said they served). It was the most uninspired buffet menu I've seen in quite some time. There was nothing special to even talk about, except for the excellent cream of mushroom soup. The fish and chips were OK too. I even questioned if that ""free"" glass of wine even had alcohol in it! For $20 each, I think there should be more than just soup to talk about. I could barely even find enough to make a meal, and I am not a picky person. A $20 lunch buffet should be offering some sort of beef or fish at the carving station. They should have Mexican food that isn't dried out. They should have some inventive salads, not just cherry tomatoes with tasteless oily dressing on them. The dessert section was spectacular the last time we were there, but I only found one decent looking thing to take (a Napoleon, which was really good). But no chocolate ice cream-- only vanilla and pumpkin. Come on! I remember marshmallows dipped in chocolate and inventive things like that before. We had to get our own drinks, which is kind of a pain. Honestly, we would have had a better meal at any Station Casino-- Green Valley, Sunset, or even Fiesta Henderson (where it only costs $7.99!).

They have remodeled this buffet and changed their menu so if you haven't been in a year or two you might want to try it again.  This is a great lunch buffet.  Only $18 a person (adults)!  You can also add unlimited beer or wine for $10 more.  The selections are pretty basic,  nothing fancy.  You have your standard salad bar, pizza and pasta, taco makings, Chinese food, carved meats and some seafood.  They also have a dessert area with lots of yummy treats.

Some dishes were better than expected, like the pinto beans and my personal favorite, the fresh-made crepes with macerated strawberries powdered sugar and whip cream. I'd eat nothing but those and coffee if we go back.

Some other items were sub-par to be sure. The scrambled eggs for example were obviously powdered and reconstituted, poorly. The orange juice was very acidic, like hurt my mouth acidic. 

There were lots of middle of the road options to meet all appetites. The country fried steak with biscuits and gravy  for example were well cooked, not tough and dry. The breakfast burritos were more like chimichangas, rolled at both ends and fried. They're small and crunchy with an acceptable flavor.

Basically, act like you should at any buffet: look with your eyes and judge how the food looks before impulse reaching for the spoon and you'll do fine. 

If it were a bit cheaper this would rate a four star. There's just too many other good choices in Vegas at or below this price to give them more than three stars.

Dinner:
The sole reason we even went to dinner here was because it was comped for them not having our room ready on time. I still had to pay the $6 difference +tip. Thank god thats all I had to spend on this meal as it was pretty horrible all the way around. My husbands pizza looked inedible (and after a bite he discovered, it was in fact, inedible). The roast beef was dry and honestly nothing I had was great. I finally got to the crab legs and philly rolls which were at least decent and saved the meal for me. Also, the desserts are a win. But seriously, don't eat here for dinner. Anything in the food court would be cheaper/tastier.

Brunch:
Now, here they get a bravo from me. It helps that I'm a breakfast person though. I could eat it for every meal.

The line-up for my weekday breakfast and my weekend brunch wasn't too long. I had to wait ~15 minutes to get to the front of the line where I presented my MLife card containing my discounted meal.

As buffets go, as mentioned, I would say that it is similar to Monte Carlo's buffet (maybe a bit larger in terms of area). It is self-serve for the soft drinks and juices. The drink dispensers was exactly the same as Monte Carlo's buffet so you had Diet Pepsi, Pepsi, Root Beer, etc. The machine was not as fancy as the one at the Mirage.

I'm not sure whether I would pick Excalibur's buffet if I wanted to have a relatively inexpensive buffet (when you compare it with Strip buffets).

The good:
The lady checking us in to the buffet was nice and explained our options i.e. one time vs all day. It was a free meal. 
The buffet offered a very reasonable selection of items from fruit/salad to traditional American  breakfast items to potatoes and pastries.  The selections include an omelet station and a variety of non-pork protein items.   The beverage station has soda, milk,  juices,  coffees (including lattes and cappuccinos) and tea. The omelet guy is a beast - I watched him whip out 5 omelettes at a time for nearly 2 hours without breaking a sweat or dropping any food. 

The food was edible and I stuffed myself. I liked the omelet and apple crepes. I went  back for seconds on the chicken fried steak...not that it was overly delicious - the turkey sausage links were not that tastey.

The bad:
Again,  I can't complain about a free meal. The coffee was just ok. We didn't get a lot of table service - I mean its a buffet but they make sure that you know gratuity isn't included.

4746229,2016-11-26,10,H-WYHSzXPWS9Avj0W6SRpg,"What does one pick for their 300th review on Yelp?  Do I make it a special occasion and choose a truly fantastic restaurant to heap welcome praise all over?  Or do I choose something so disappointing and vile that it crossed the boundaries of both exceedingly low expectations and all semblance of good taste?

Oh, I'm going for the latter.

Jesus, was the place bad.  I used to come to Las Vegas often with my mother and her parents, back in the day, staying at many a hotel and eating at many a restaurant.  Sadly, my grandparents are no longer with us; and, no, the Buffet at Excalibur didn't kill them, but I can guarantee you that any man who is not in God's good graces has this dump waiting for them on the other side of Purgatory.

Alright, I should probably start with all that is positive...

With that out of the way, now on to the mediocre.  The price isn't too bad.  Considering the cost of other buffets on the strip, it could be much higher.  On the flip side of that, the quality of all of the food here is so substandard that I'm not sure where the money is going.  Surely, at $20 a person, you can find some fare that's a step or two above Golden Corral.  And yet, all there is are forkfuls, glasses, and cuts of utterly disgusting garbage.

Which leads me to the resoundingly negative.  When you start browsing the stations, everything looks like it's been given a glossy sheen, a spray coating to seal in appearance like you would before doing a photo shoot for an overhead menu at McDonalds.  But, they never bothered to make the food look it's best before freeze framing it for posterity.  Using tongs and serving spoons to break that plastic veneer, you heap crap onto your plate to bring back to the table before you start pushing it around into separate, unappetizing piles before finally pushing your plate away with a disgusted and disappointing sigh.

The Beer Battered Fish is processed, every piece the same size and shape, all fried and left greasy in the tub.

The Orange Chicken is an abomination, again processed and freeze packed into chunks of mashed up meat that is almost entirely unlike chicken and coasted with some sort of thin, stickiness that apparently is orange flavored because a few slices of dried up fruit are stuck on top of it.

Macaroni and Cheese has a fake coloring to it, making it offensively bright yellow; which, by the way, also perfectly describes the taste.

The Fried Rice, while having some nice variety to the meat and vegetables in it, was still coarse and chewy, like someone didn't properly cook the rice first before frying it up.

French Fires are out of a bag, frozen and stale.

The Grilled Cheese was cut into hardened planks that were inedible.  The Tomato Soup that went with it was salty beyond belief, akin to sucking down a spoonful of alum.

The Chow Mein was alright, not good to the point of being at the average mark, but much better in comparison to everything else.

The same goes for the Carnitas, the right amount of salt and nothing unnecessary added.  Not great, but not horrible.

The beef in the Beef and Broccoli was like the kind of meat you get on a steak-um sandwich, thin and mealy.  It tastes mashed up and processed, like all other meat before it, and fell apart in the mouth in a very unappealing way.

The Chorizo Sausage was dry, a terrible taste, and only a requisite amount of heat.

And those desserts, the Red Velvet Loaf was dry, the outer edges dried into a crust that you couldn't even really cut easily with a fork.  The cookies share the same level of stale.  And all of the sugar free treats are easily a step or two below what you find at other, similar buffets.

Only the Bread Pudding was a saving grace to our lunch.  Not too bad.

So, in the end, I wish I had purged after this binging.  We all walked away grossed out, disappointed, and saddened by our experience.  Only the fact that we got a two for one deal from a casino promotion brought a light ray of sun to this debacle.  As it stands right now, the Buffet at the Excalibur has soured my time here at the casino, tarnishing the fonder memories I have of this end of the Vegas strip.  Thankfully, the Tournament was still just as good, making me not hate Excalibur completely.  But, I sure as hell will never come back here ever again.",lN7NysaTcbI2VCRub7kYOw,12,6,1,RHtw93Q56eYiX61B7gbEHg

We were curious about it as the myVegas game advertised about the re-opening relentlessly. We typically go to the more popular buffet locations at Wynn, Caesar's, Cosmopolitan, and Bellagio, so this was an interesting experience. 

We were very surprised with the wait... considering there were probably only 4 or 5 parties in front of us. The queuing didn't seem to work well. It seemed like we were all pushed to use the kiosks but then were stuck in that queue waiting to be seated. There were actually no one in line for the queue to pay with the cashier. We wished we went through the cashier instead so that we could have been seated quicker. They eventually noticed the inefficiency and allowed people to move in the cashier line so that everyone would through and seated quicker. That then caused a back up in the cashier line for people who wanted to pay... it was almost entertaining if it wasn't frustrating. Maybe the whole system would run better if it had been busier and both lines were filled and it didn't feel like there was a ""better"" option available to line hop to... 

Things that I thought were notable: there was a self served beverage island that had a special water dispenser... 3 types flavored water as well as this ultra filtered water that tasted really good. Although there was a made-to-order pasta option... there was this pasta with shrimp on the buffet line that was soo good. Probably the best thing that I had there. The decor was modern and the location seemed pretty clean.

Desserts were just OK. They had a made-to-order crepe station that I was excited about, but when I asked for Nutella (they showcased 2 huge buckets of Nutella on display), it was watered down and runny so that they could just squeeze it out of a plastic bottle. I didn't think you could ever ruin Nutella, but this buffet had found a way. Also, my husband was really looking forward to the hand-dipped ice cream station... we couldn't even find it so we had asked someone to show us. It ended up ""not working"" this evening and that was why we had passed by it multiple times. The hand-dipped ice cream bars were just small bowls of melted ice cream with a stick in the bowl. Maybe there was no attendant to work this station? I'm not sure, but my husband was disappointed.

When I visit Vegas, I do look forward (and am willing to pay) for top-notch dining experiences, so I will probably not return to this buffet. With that being said, I believe this is an affordable option for a buffet experience. I had trouble rating this between 2 or 3 stars, but went with 3 as I believe this buffet is priced to its quality when compared to other buffets on the strip.",egeDp4KcOE75oF1FQGnL2A,6,1,3,3Jqoc8jpIWk4XdO3WYsBnw
4927945,2015-08-22,2,H-WYHSzXPWS9Avj0W6SRpg,"Our first time at this Buffet.  Since they just remodeled, I expected a little more.  Instead, I found a very basic buffet.  

We went right when lunch started so the Italian station still had breakfast.  This is a plus and a minus.  If you were hoping for brunch, you loved it.  If you were looking for Italian, you were disappointed.  

What was left of breakfast was the basics.  Eggs, Hashbrowns, Sausage, Bacon, Waffles, French Toast, etc.  The Orange Chicken was slobbered with so much of what tasted like fast food orange sauce, you could barely taste the chicken.  On the other hand, the fried chicken was delish.   The made to order crepes is a nice touch.  The desserts were pretty standard fair for a buffet.  

If you are a gold card mLife holder or greater, they do have a VIP line, the sign is just at the FRONT of the line.  Kind of confusing.  They also have self service kiosks - which means only 1 or 2 people the cash register.  

And don't expect much help once inside.  It's all pretty self service except for someone who comes and cleans the tables.

While we thought it was a little expensive for what it was, overall we were satisfied with the food and selections.  However, we will not be dining their again and will be voicing our distaste for the buffet based on the POOR SERVICE we encountered.  This was my husband's family's first trip to the United States and of course it took them a bit longer to get acquainted with the buffet process/sorting their American money, etc.  First of all, the woman at the cashier station seemed aggravated as they counted their money and seemed annoyed at any questions that were being asked through translation from my husband.  But the worst employee was an older Indian woman who was borderline rude and very condescending to his family as well as mine.  All she could do was yell 'How many?!' And when we explained that there were more in our party still arriving, and to please wait a moment as we wanted to have the right total.  She also was condescending to my husband's family and seemed annoyed that their English wasn't perfect.  She even went so far as to try and 'herd' us out of the way without explaining why as we were waiting for the rest of the family who was literally at the cashier station paying.  Very poor customer service.  As the manager at 5 star hotel here in LA, I felt perhaps the management could use our experience as a training tool to perhaps teach their staff the importance of EVERY customer EVERY time as you may have no idea who the people you are shuffling about may be and who they may influence.",oEMobDwc0I-Cz1qtczwKPA,0,1,2,hM-HRyydEldQzYGS9bAD8Q

If you do not have those two I would recommend you do because it provides you with a free Buffet ticket or a BOGO, buy one, get one free Buffet. In my case I received a BOGO dinner so I went in with my fiancè. The cashier ladies are mediocre, they are not as nice as you'd expect them to be, they just take your payment and send you on your way. A host will bring you to your table where your server/ bused will greet you and give you straws, and napkins. Here you get your own drinks from an unlimited drinking fountain, there are an assortment of coffee, tea, and Pepsi brand product soda's. 

The food line is just one straight away path, left to right they categorize the type of food they have: salads, seafood, Italian, carved meat station, Asian, Latin, and the bar station. Towards the entrance of the Buffet there's the dessert station where a crepe station is located followed by cakes, brownies, other dessert bakery items, and ice-cream machine. The food is okay and I really like the Asian and seafood station, the crepes are good but the guy working it is rude. He doesn't speak to you instead uses hand motions and when I would speak to him as to what toppings I wanted he would air me out or help the people behind me where he skips over me. I have been here five times and it happens all the time with the same guy. Crab legs are cut in half which makes things easier for you but it isn't steamed, it's in a bed of ice and the crab legs are not as meaty as you'd want or expect it to be. Butter for your crab legs is located at the carved meat station, just ask and the guy will give you a cup. Our server was nice but she only bused our finished plates so we barely seen her around.

There is a lot of competition in vegas especially with the older hotels since you have all the new ones dawning over you like city center. Most of the hotels these days are going through complete makeovers to keep up with what is hip and current. The old excalibur buffet was dark old and dingy and looked like it was built during mideval  times...and  let's just say the food wasn't that great either. But this place got a huge makeover brand new everything and the food choices are so much better. I used my myvegas comps to score a free lunch buffet and it was Soo good so many choices and the dessert counter is awesome and did I mention you can built your own crepes?  How cool is that. Excalibur great job on the makeover you will deff see my buisness again!,5vo2P2YS7RjqKW8upH1r4g,5,1,5,gZgFLmubYEqkbn50qZtAdQ
5655895,2016-07-15,0,H-WYHSzXPWS9Avj0W6SRpg,"My husband and I visited about a week ago and ate here for lunch (we got there fairly late in the day, so I think that it might have been close to dinner time).

The size of the buffet is definitely nothing special. They didn't have many food options (again, not sure if that was because it was still mostly the lunch buffet) but the food that they had was fairly good. The dessert selection was pretty good, but I disliked the carrot cake. A fairly boring selection to choose from.

You can pay by kiosk with a credit card, which was cool and a time saver. The price was also fairly good, which is what helped this buffet secure a 3 star rating (if it were just the food, I would have given it a 2 star.)

Worth a try if you're in the area and hungry, but nothing to go out of your way for. Good value for the money, but the selection is so-so. Maybe it's better for dinner.",nzm6MM_2mc2TN3EyiceqvQ,0,0,3,x2kAE9MFRiWZACLXnlYqOw

The all you can drink for an extra $10 was a joke, they had champagne and one wine selection. Asked for a refund, didn't even take a bite out of that disgusting food.

5803203,2017-05-21,0,H-WYHSzXPWS9Avj0W6SRpg,Crepes for breakfast were delicious.  Bacon and sausage were also good.  Friends said the omelets were good.  I wasn't impressed with their scrambled eggs.  I also ate here for lunch one day and food was decent.  Desserts were dried out though.  Love the kiosks that make paying so much faster than waiting in line.  One of the beverage machines wasn't working (for me or another person after me) and when I told someone he treated me like an idiot.  Other staff was all very nice and helpful though.,pB8LcBFESuORoB_5pcvRBw,0,0,4,JTgDn5FzMBezSZ7JCijhww

5805361,2015-10-25,0,H-WYHSzXPWS9Avj0W6SRpg,"I'm leaving 4 stars based on the quality +  discounted price from My Vegas rewards (buy 1 get 1 free =$18.99 lunch for 2). Kids under 5 are free, which worked perfect for us because we have a 3 and 4-year-old! So hubby, me and our 2 kids ate for $18.99. Can't beat that! Buffet isn't too fancy, more like the quality of Hometown Buffet, but pretty big for the price. Dessert bar was awesome, and the drink station had many options. They also have all-you-can-drink alcohol for an additional $15 or $20, I think. Food and service were good, no complaints there. Don't think it's worth $18.99 per person, but as long as they offer the buy 1 get 1 reward, we'll keep coming back!",3yA5NjTKyImkZWQ5Qbmwjw,0,0,4,XCozmMNIHBghShR6cUW2qg

I ate a bite of every vegetarian option and almost spit out most of it. My friends tried everything, and the baby who eats everything wouldn't even touch it. In the end we had a table full of plates with almost nothing eaten.  If you're looking for a good buffet, don't go here.",hzplyxQyFLy4PycgBiHndw,1,0,1,5sd6eZDluahhnSPaNr7cxw

I would not eat here again if they gave ME $30 in game play. Gross.

Even the unlimited beer might have been a good idea, but how much can you drink AND Eat? Very plain. Nothing great. It was clean. There was dessert. They will make you a fresh crepe. Ice cream. 

Bland to please all kinds. This set up had chicken tacos, 2 sushi Styles 'smoked salmon and just a cucumber (both good btw) your average salad, pasta, Asian rice. Some fresh slab of meat they cut (pork loin this time) You can eat a lot for the cost but then again Dick's at the resort was $65 for 2 and I couldn't even finish my burger and tots!
