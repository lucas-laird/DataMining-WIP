But when I went to THIS church's on Rainbow blvd in Las Vegas, I was beyond dissapointment!  The management was ignorant.  The chicken was not seasoned as it should be.  It tasted like greasy non-flavored flour wrapped around a wasted piece of sad chicken.  It's Popeyes for me now or I'll drive to Spring mountain Rd for the good Church's chicken!!  If you live around Rainbow blvd, Take the drive to Spring Mountain Rd for REAL Church's chicken!

I drive up and down rainbow 7 days a week and finally today I happen to be with the family and decided to give this location one more time as my wife had gone about 6 months ago. I told her and the kids that I would try this place one last time. The previous time there was too much grease inside.
So we ended up purchasing the $12.99 special (10 piece chicken and 2 sides) The Indian looking guy upgraded us to the biscuits which my kids say are great. 
I think there business is on the rocks because it seems that he penny pinches everywhere he can. Well, they saved a good 2 cents on putting the biscuits in the same box as the chicken. I'm sure you can guess what happened by the time we got home. Yes, they biscuits came out soggy. All for 2 cents? Then I opened the sides. The mashed potatoes were mixed with the gravy. I don't know if this is procedure but guess who didn't get any gravy?
Then I opened the Cajun rice. Not only did he save another 2 cents because it was half full. But the rice we did get was very, very soggy. My wife took a picture of this and said he was going to show it to the owner tomorrow. I told her to be careful because after reading these reviews, he might throw something at her or cuss her out.
Now I know after driving up and down on Rainbow Blvd. why they don't have any customers. Churchs chicken I'm sure is great, but not this location.
BTW I forgot to mention the owner saved another 2 cents by not giving us any napkins.
The moral of the story: don't forget to check your order before you leave and ask for your condiments and napkins!!

I was so excited when I found out there's a Churches opening on my side a year or so ago, but yesterday I had enough.

I ordered a family meal and saw the new jalapeño cheddar biscuit bites, so I wanted to try the 5 piece. I ordered, and when I got to the window, the lady was pretty rude. Snatched my card out of my hand and just swiped it. I had seen her on the window getting my food together and saw that everything was done, but tell me why I had to wait a long time still. They just moved at a very slow pace. When a man came to the window to give me my food, I politely asked ""could I have hot sauce and honey please?"" He looked at me like I was retarded and didn't say a word. I then said, ""well is it in the bag?"" He gave me an annoyed/sarcastic ""yeah!"" So I just said, ""okay thanks, all you had to do is say so."" I took my food and left. I then wanted to try the biscuit bites and first one I had was burnt and it tasted old. So I went for the next one and I kept chewing on God knows what. I pulled it out of my mouth and placed it in my cup holder. This was night time so I couldn't see what it was when I was driving home. This morning, I saw it in my cup holder and to my surprise it was wood shavings. That's so nasty.

Chicken is pretty darn good and their biscuit has gradually gotten bigger or should I say normal size.

Came in with my friend on our way home and were told they were out of chicken for 20 minutes.  

We waited patiently for our food to be prepared.  I noticed, the place wasn't running their AC, which made it a bit uncomfortable and there was no available seating outside, so we manned up and dined here.  At least they had ice available for our drinks, which made the situation manageable. 

When our food came out, my friend and I were pleased with the size and quality.  We had extra condiments as well as napkins, all were needed as their chicken has always known to be more on the greasier side... which explains the great taste. 

I had a four piece meal, fries and their famous honey biscuit.  I left full with extra money in my pocket which was a plus. 

This place needs to improve on inventory and put on the air conditioning.  Las Vegas is hot, granted it was the first of the month, April Fools, but don't mess or joke around with people's comfort when they are dining in your place. 

Kudos to the two member team that worked on Easter Sunday.  They were friendly, hard working and honest.

Despite the line, my order came out fairly quickly and everything was piping hot and fresh. So hot I might add that I felt like I was buring my fingers when breaking apart pieces of chicken. We had a 10 piece with mac and cheese and jalapeno bombers. The chicken was crispy and juicy, and not overcooked like Smith's.

Basically the issue comes to an advertised special that I ordered. Drinks were a certain addition more. That would be fine, but when upgrading the drink from the special, they insist on charging that amount plus. All other restaurants, including fast food places I have visited charge a certain amount for their medium size for instance, and then the difference for the upgraded drink. Charging the difference only is the method in which all other restaurants work, but not this Church's Chicken.

I tried discussing this with the person at check out and she didn't want to assist. When the manager came in, he was directed to visit my table and not at my request. He asked if he could sit at my table, I said no thanks and he sat down anyway. After he kept going over the same point that Church's Chicken policy is to charge the promotional price on top of a fully priced drink, I decided it was time to collect my tray, toss out the refuse and leave.

 Meh. I've experienced better.

That is truly a good way to sum it up. 

- For all the complaints I see about rudeness or lack of customer service, I did not experience that at all. If anything, the employees were very polite and respectful. I heard lots of ""sirs"" and ma'ams"" as they were helping other patrons.

- Bottom line: the chicken is just too damn greasy! It was downright slimy and slipped around on my plate. Gross. 

All we got was the chicken, so I cannot give an opinion on any of the sides. 

With Popeye's further north on Rainbow and KFC opening very soon right up the road, I just don't think this is a great place to go for your fried chicken fix.

After that annoying waste of time and gas, I decided to call and make sure they had this advertised chicken before going there.  No one was answering, but I ran errands while I kept calling. Someone finally answered 25 minutes into calling, I asked about the chicken and he said they had it. Within 10 minutes, I was at the drive thru asking for 2 bourbon half chickens. His reply was that he only had one half chicken left, until he made more. I said I had called to make sure they had this chicken before driving over, his response was unapologetic and said it would take 20 minutes to make more. Should've told me that when I called!! 

I said to just give me the half he had, which seemed to surprise him..not sure why.  I ordered it with fried okra and a biscuit. When I get my order, I check it before driving off and there's the okra...there's the biscuit...but there's NO CHICKEN!!!  Are you fuckin kidding me?!  So here I am honking to get their attention to get the half.chicken I paid for. I would've been so angry if I had not checked and gotten home, after all that, with okra and a damn biscuit and no chicken!! This place is ridiculous",lhlvTfKX9181dowOvpVqlg,0,0,1,hinzTghhUgstSM9qNGgBVQ
5769391,2016-08-18,0,_cs_J4j8XXyBgihJs83qUg,First time in today. First impression was how sticky the floor was. With every step my shoes felt glued to floor. The place was a little dirty on the tables. Only three staff members on. One peeping food in the back one at register and one possibly in charge at drive through. Ordered my meal the wait was a little longer than expected chicken was done and sitting in basket on tray at counter but had to wait for a fresh batch of fries. About 7 minutes. So the meal itself blah not that great. Chicken was just not appealing at all Canes blows this dump away. The best part of the meal was the fries I had to wait 7 mins for. The biscuit was sub par as well. While waiting for my meal I watched another patron come to order get so frustrated with the counter help he turned and walked off and left. Should have followed him out. Don't waste your time and pass on by this place unless your looking for a semi decent fry and soft drink. I won't be back.,grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,0,0,2,_RuPYgsJ4cuP2KO0HLo8ww

1. Drive thru line is long bc of the cheap deals

2. Bunch of the workers are HS or college kids. Who does not give a... 

3. I went inside to get my chicken- saw 3 workers (1 I believe is the mgr). 3 workers manning the dinner rush?! Crazy.... 

Meh, whateva... Ppl love to rant and complain, everyone likes to be pampered, everyone is in a rush to nowhere. lol

Despite that fact- you can't knock the super cheap price for decent fried chicken. It's not better than Popeyes but I rather have Church's lightly battered chicken than KFC's more expensive and heavily battered chicken.

Tip: reheat in your toaster oven for a bit once you get home. Just wait for it! It'll be worth it. That crispy bite (!) and the waffles will be nice and toasty too! It's not roscoes but hey! It's not bad! Don't knock it til you try it!",IaOyMay2X9VmPyEnIBFb2A,3,3,3,O2Cd2DZEQOF9zMcqOEVDAg

Cajun rice
Corn
Macaroni and cheese

When placing our order the girl says ""oh sorry busy weekend"" like that's an excuse. Who does your purchasing and why don't they pay attention to the needs / business demands of your customers?",cb6PC0KrU9OFClNkPOGy8Q,0,0,1,MuDCl7k4aBgcbL8OwgeJ-g

i love the biscuits but they are way too small, the coleslaw was good but my special order was 1 breast 1 leg and shades of kfc the chicken has 4 breasts with ribs and spine attached...ugh that being exactly why i no longer eat at kfc...add to that cooking A breast that has been cut in half changes the cooking time for the rib spine section which means the meat is so dry and overcooked u will choke on it even with your drink. hopefully this manager will take the time to have staff properly trained and get full breasts and not cheap it out will give them a second chance in about a month",bJJIRFEQfI2muab6jcoReQ,0,0,2,vzZgujt02nh6CWsFDNqr_g

The biscuits here are an acquired taste im not sure I like. They are honey glazed. Popeye's definitely has them beat on biscuits and sides. 

I may just have to go there to grab a red beans and rice, some biscuits and a mountain dew from the gas station so I can have a proper fried chicken lunch! 

Its worth a stop in and the customer service is improving since their first week open. I wish them nothing but success.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,2,1,3,CIUy4qvvGx0nI6TCUMcI5w

I had a High School discount card I bought from my nephew and tried to use it there for a BOGO combo offer and the guy at the drive-in window said they don't accept those.  I said, ""It says it's good at ALL Las Vegas locations??""  to which I hear in the background from the rude manager, ""We don't do that!""  He wouldn't even come to the window to tell me directly!  I should have drove off, but Nooooo... I waited about 10-15 minutes at the window for my food, with cars behind me honking their horns!  Finally get home and NO SAUCE!  And the food isn't that great either.  Just makes me love Cane's that much more!",42LUxWiXgD6P4FHYZ3K9tA,0,0,1,REHlJCKmlNTLloKK8zY2bg
