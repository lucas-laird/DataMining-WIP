With mozzarella cheese, olives, and the veggie works!
All this on a grilled flatbread!
Yummy!
I never order my drinks extra large ever!
Hello folks, it's a soda fountain kinda thing!
That means no limits!
If I'm eating inside why pay extra dime if I could go back for more drinks! 
Besides when I'm done eating there, I don't drink anymore soda, at least for that time being...
But hey, the service were pretty quick and delightful!  I don't know what some people talk about service complaints all the time!
The complainers must have belong to the ""complain department""; they came out to eat and complain....lol!
Sorry folks, you ate it all so no refunds!! Haha
And hey sorry guys no pictures this time because I was so hungry that I ate my sandwich like water and forgot the yelp pictures!
Maybe next time!
Enjoy your meal!
Don't complain too much!
You could be that person behind the counter you know!",N1sKQSVAll7UurvCz7-RYQ,1,0,5,2Y9sDh24Hx30SL_HIWvHjA

They know me so well busy now and they know the two types if sandwiches I get and they are in the process of figuring out my hubby's. I always get asked about my school and day.  I had a bad day on Tuesday and went to go get some lunch and they really turned my day around making sure to get me to smile before I left. The facility is clean and well kept, even the new workers who don't know me as well make sure my sandwiches are perfect as possible.  I reccomend this subway :)",brFb14Fwg2U-8-9QLd96CA,0,0,5,mDNUk9zHUHEkyISDVRG_Bw

2003822,2017-08-20,0,AyKOSCyaPb7x8a9gqZ0z2A,Went in there last week and dealt with a grumpy employee who was clearly miserable working there. The machines went down while trying to purchase my sub so myself and another customer waited for 20-25 mins to try and purchase our subs all to be told in the end that unless we had cash we could not take the food. Better to leave two pissed off customers and wasted food than to accommodate for the inconvenience I guess. Also another customer walked in while they were having technical difficulties and she stood there for about 5 mins waiting patiently and the two employees didn't say a single word to her. She eventually walked back out. Today I go in and there's only one employee making about 7 subs. I left for the 2nd time without a sandwich in hand. I'll drive the extra 5 mins to buy sandwiches elsewhere from now on.,ixLBh1bYhUp6SLZ-0kj-WA,0,0,1,8NkXhEsGVmqLIAK-tNopbw

Workers are friendly but so sloooooow. 8 people in front of me at 12:30 and it's taken 25 min and I'm still not able to order.  But I do have time to write a review - probably have enough time to come back and edit this a few times before I actually get to order. Only reason I stayed is because the A/C is so nice. 
Update - I see that the sandwiches that were toasted have been sitting so long it's gotta be cold and hard.  Really inefficient. But the help is friendly

Update 2 - we had so much time some of our group changed their minds and left. I changed my rating lower as I still haven't ordered. One star.  Sad operation!",5jZBTVOXpi-QVspNQlemZg,2,0,1,XBV334gByE2HahAmFyr4Zg

My sandwich is amazing and looks better than the picture AND the girls working were super nice! There was no line on a Sunday around lunch time. Seriously, this needs to be my go-to Subway! I wouldn't mind the longer drive out here just for the service at this location. The northwest location subways are the best!",_PN5byES4XWl2vTKLAN6dw,0,0,5,gK6KCj0MjmlOFaCnsTWXFQ

Family and I are on the road and we're looking for a Subway. How unfortunate we were to have picked this one. Two girls were working today and one of which had looong beautiful dreads, however not wearing a hair tie or anything! Her hair was flinging everywhere over her shoulders! 

The other one didn't even bother asking us if we wanted our sandwiches toasted, just flung em in the oven. We didn't mention it to her that she didn't ask; we just let it be. 

Additionally, as we were being rung up for our four 6"" sandwiches, we gave the girl our 2 BOGO Coupons. She confusingly responded saying ""you can't use these coupons on these sandwiches."" What??? The coupons says ANY 6"" and it doesn't expire until Aug 31. She then accepted it and took forever to ring it up. The total sounded weird because it seemed a little over-charged, but at this point we just wanted to leave.  After we saw the receipt, we were right - She charged me for a 12"" spicy Italian and then took it off as a 6"". 

Haven't tried the sandwich yet. We'll see. 

Only reason why I gave this 2 stars and not 1 is because the girl gave me extra cheese and didn't charge me extra for it.",2-AQhftohFmWd1sjjDVhPw,1,0,2,25T3iwc90gJeStFFf3Xtqg

Not 5 star though because I wast a fan of my sandwich the steak and egg had no flavour at all. Sort of like water-meat. 
Otherwise! Was a pleasant visit.",LIduJe8nxmiBhspEKRaUAQ,0,0,4,A5aEx9X8YYllrgrd-AvH1w

Kudos to this guy for keeping his spirits up & maintaining a smile & good attitude!

Subway also has coupons both online and in the mail, typically for a buy a 6""inch and get the 2nd one free with purchase of a drink. Normally, this comes out to roughly 7 or 8 dollars depending on what you order. Its a great deal, especially if you can eat your order in 2 meals throughout the day. This restaurant location was very clean and organized. The staff that was there in the morning was super friendly. If you are hungry for subway and not sure which location to go to, you should check this one out. There is parking in the shopping center, and its easy to get to off the 215/buffalo exit.",0911xXCgLexupPGkDJusLQ,0,0,4,jztLdmDYj-9vqsCXkilEZg
