Go down the line to have your pie made and 5 minutes later it arrives at your table fresh out of the brick style oven.  I had to pass this place on the way to the monorail twice a day for a week and every time it smelled great.  Probably went here 3 or 4 times during my stay.   Highly recommend doing the ""pierise"" which adds a second half of a dough ball to make it a thick crust.

Great toppings, selection of 5 different cheeses available and the sausage is especially good.",zWZ9mRAsMD-gK_P7UCvHRQ,0,0,5,VS38_oEAXxAi8xZRlCRYfA

Adrianna made me probably three pies throughout my stay all the while flashing a huge smile and exchanging pleasantries each and every time (on totally separate days, I'm not a total glutton!) Although this was entirely not required she made sure that not only my pizza was on-point but that I felt welcome each and every time I ordered.

And Gina was ever-present assisting behind the line but also keeping the dining area clean and comfortable. When there was a snafu with my order she made sure that I felt taken care of and her consideration ultimately made me confident in returning to Pieology over and over and over.

On my next trip to Vegas I'm coming back to Pieology whether I'm staying at the MGM or not! Hopefully sooner than later and hopefully Adrianna and Gina will be working!",ISNgvTCOqdYQvJngXRp9yA,1,0,5,wH_dPBqDAGDd9LxlhkzwfQ

My better half and I tried two different pies~ The Spicy Italian as well as the Smokin' Buffalo Chicken.  I was incredibly happy with both choices.  The Spicy Italian, which we chose with thick crust, had a bounty of salami, sausage, basil, garlic and chili flakes.  Their ingredients were fresh on the garlic butter crust.  

There is no complaints about the Smokin' Buffalo Chicken pizza either.  We chose to go 'Thin' on this pizza crust.  The toppings of chicken, gorgonzola and mozzarella held up nicely even on the thinner crust choice.  They drizzle the hot buffalo sauce after baking which I'm assuming so it won't sog up the crust.  Very spicy but full of flavor.  

Both pizzas were tasty in their own right.  I am very impressed with this chain.  If staying in the MGM, it's certainly worth the try!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,6,5,4,sR-vyW3GlB_3xvYG2GqhGA

I quickly learned that Project Pie is a part of Pieology as some of the staff members were wearing Pieology shirts also their boxes has the logo on them.  The rundown is pretty much the same, but they have better ingredients like prosciutto, brussel sprouts, and garlic butter/olive oil.

I'm pretty terrible at choosing toppings that go well with each other but my concoction turned out pretty good.  The caramelized onions and pineapple perfectly countered the saltiness from the prosciutto and bitterness of the brussel sprouts.  The crust was really thin but I was hoping it would have been crispier.  I also wish that they used fresh pineapples instead of canned.

It's by far the best pizza I have ever had. Hands down. This place is a build your own. Same idea as chipotle, qdoba, etc. They do have selections of certain pizzas. But whats not to love about making your pizza exactly how you want it. You can choose a thin or thick crust. I'm a sucker for thin, it's not an enormous amount of dough where it focuses on the main ingredients. I highly recommend getting the herb garlic butter then they put your choice of sauce on top of it. (red sauce or Alfredo sauce). Then veggies and meats. It's $12 for UNLIMITED TOPPINGS. Usually at pizzerias, pie are already $12-$14 then $1-$2 per topping. If I had this where I lived (east coast), I would have this every single day. The flavors and freshness made my taste buds dance. I can't get over it.

The establishment seems a little modern which I loved. It was very clean and staff was very polite. 
The line can get a little long so watch what time you go. But nothing crazy. The last time I went I was checking out so might as well grab some lunch. It was 11:30-12 and there was 2 people in line. By the time I ordered, paid, and sat down. I only waited 4 minutes at the table and they walked over the pizza to me. 4 minutes is not bad at all! Think about it, each person they have to make a pie for. Usually the time to bake a pie, it is must longer than 4 minutes. So Bravo Pieology! This place is a must try. You won't be disappointed.

4833871,2018-03-27,0,fwZzpkSH4ZOJGzDzI2rSaQ,"As a lover of pizza, Pieology is a great concept. You get your own choice of toppings and can even get thick crust or cheese filled crusts. The dough is flattened by a machine, and you can even choose between white and red and garlic butter sauce (recommend adding this to red sauce) as well!

I believe that pizza by the slice tastes much better, but this is nice for the value.",HffJGgXdf82JYMfh0glhUA,0,0,4,V986Np7zE8ywANJcnU5fNQ
5069023,2016-12-14,0,fwZzpkSH4ZOJGzDzI2rSaQ,well it's the same workers who give you the same excellent quality that it was when it was Project pie but now that I got taken over by biology or really bummed because we lost all the motivation slogans that used to be posted on the wall the pieces fast and hard at the bottom of the escalator on the way to the entrance to MGM from the underground and it's fast quick and easy for under ten bucks instant Pizza Subway Style,mjS4hB1W4XR-y77VNYouXg,0,0,3,FlG5yqQIKIQm0MwiD0ja8g

$12 to make your own pizza & pick from different toppings and sauces. 

The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because they claimed to be switching from ""Project Pie"" to ""Pieology"" therefore they didn't have the kind of sauce or toppings we liked & couldn't make the specialty pizza we usually get. So we opted for a different kind, which still turned out great.

Hubs and I spent $30 for the both of us. More than what we usually spend at Pieology but understandable since it's located on the strip. 

If we had known they didn't have the full variety of sauces & toppings that a normal Pieology does, we would've drove to the one on Flamingo & Paradise. Service was much friendlier at that location too.",DIR7PSMWWbi2qra0VEff4A,0,0,3,hagjpoDE9J1rwypSQnb48Q

The concept is, in theory, very simple. You walk down a line and order your pizza exactly how you want it. However, it proved to be extremely difficult for the incompetent employees to get my basic cheese pizza right. 

First, the woman making the pizzas skipped over me and pretended I didn't exist. I finally got her attention and she created a pizza for me that was so small I thought it was a joke. The manager came over, looked at it, and tossed it in the trash without saying a word. 

She made me another one and I proceeded down the line. They screwed up the order of the woman in front of me so after I chose my toppings, they decided my pizza was her redo so I had to start the process again a third time. 

I paid for my pizza and sat down. I literally ordered a pizza with only mushrooms. I noticed the 4 people who ordered after me got their pizzas before me. I walked up to the counter and saw my pizza just sitting there being ignored. I'd never go back to this clown show of a restaurant.",Ar-0s6JAO3b17NWZ-_FH6w,0,0,1,34U8MdPHeMTcWZBn4-_P1g

This place was the first eatery I saw when getting into MGM from their self parking lot. There wasn't that many people when I got there around 1pm on a Sunday. The employees here were pretty friendly especially the cashier. The ingredients looked fresh, woot! The eating area was kept very clean, there was always someone cleaning up! 

It takes about 8 minutes to bake in the oven. When it came out, it smelled, looked, and tasted delicious .. Maybe cause I was super hungry... The crust was super thin, just the way I like it. 

Will be back again..!",0jr5cKupqhBQ3uhxAwZs5g,3,0,5,M78xbLLf_R8E2jbde0OuzQ

There are great choices for a personal sized pizza and tons of toppings to choose from. You choose your crust, then your sauce, then your cheese, then your proteins, and then your veggies! I like their veggie options that include broccoli and even artichokes and the fact that you can select thick or thin crust.
