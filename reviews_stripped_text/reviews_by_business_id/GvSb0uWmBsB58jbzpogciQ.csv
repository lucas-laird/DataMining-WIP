The prices might seem high, but you get what you paid for. The salmon especially had a nice flavor, and the smokiness wasn't overwhelming. The quality is much better than what you'd find at local grocery stores.",_a6fWMCWqrb3mXKg7xpu9Q,1,0,5,RQU2yAKEHiV7_uNj8BtFHQ

So I told him we should go check it out, and boy am I glad I did. There were so many smoked fish, sausages, salami, pickles, sweets, etc etc that it was almost overwhelming. My husband didn't really know where to start, but the ladies at the counter were so helpful, offering samples of everything so we could taste before buying. While literally everything in that store looked delicious, we ended up with a piece of smoked pork (our car smelled of bacon the drive home, it smelled AMAZING), some sort of coffee cake with nuts that was also incredible, and something that I don't know what to call it other than a chicken fritter (or maybe chicken pancake?), and that was amazing too. We also almost bought a piece of smoked salmon, but I think we'll come back for that. My husband would have bought everything in the store if we could have. Can't wait to come back next time. We've been living in Vegas for 8 months now, and this is by far our favorite place, and we just found it by accident. Why are you still reading this? Go there.

Tonight I prepared
2 types of sausage. Polish smoked and Polish fresh.  Fresh was simmered first then put on top of potatoes and sauerkraut along with the smoked. Baked at 350 for one hour. 

Both had amazing flavor. But then I realized, there was almost no fat. How nice to find a place that sells a more healthy sausage. 

Also purchased smoked Hungarian sausage and that was dried. Surprisingly beautiful flavor with the right amount of chew. Great for appetizers. 

Finally purchased some rice sausage that had to hit the freezer. Too much for one person 

I was offered fresh European bread baked in the store. 

I had forgotten my ice block for my insulated bag, and they were happy to give me a small bag of ice to get the products home fresh. This may seem like a small thing, but the temperature was about 110   degrees. I am certainly happy with both the products and service.",HyJUnoB4Ywv2O2x2UjCesw,1,0,5,3J2tAR7wzorlKW09KxvfNw

401429,2016-05-30,0,GvSb0uWmBsB58jbzpogciQ,"Recently, my German friends had a party and served very tasty LeberKass from Tina's Gourmet Sausage House & Deli. The following day I headed to Tina's European style deli to take home some of their scratch made food offerings myself. 

From the moment I walked in, I was offered free samples of lightly house smoked meats including pork belly, ribs, and various smoked fish. These meats weren't smoked using typical American heavy smoke BBQ smoking methods. Instead these meats and fish were delicately smoked in Tina's kitchen, which gave their smoked meats a light golden, almost orange, color. YUM!

Tina's homemade sausages are incredible. Bratwurst, both regular & spicy, knockwurst, frankfurters, Hungarian, and Polish kielbasa, are all Tina's special recipes. For a change of pace they offer chicken bratwurst as well. 

Fresh homemade cabbage rolls are sold in meat, vegetarian, and vegan versions. House made schnitzel, chicken soup, German potato salad, slaw's, European style breads, and a nice variety of European cheeses, round out the deli counter offerings at Tina's. This is all GOOD STUFF! 

Break away from the typical mass produced, overly process, meats and foods sold at most Vegas deli's. Stop by Tina's, next to Trader J's on Decatur, and take home fresh made European style food, made with the love and passion of its owners. Tina's Gourmet Sausage House and Deli is a ""REAL DEAL FOODIE EXPERIENCE"", and has earned them my support, and the support of the Las Vegas ""Good Tasting Community"". ......Taste Tina's for yourself, YOU WILL BE AMAZED!",751hDCoLdBNdR8aRb6EwiQ,2,1,5,0lngKVqnAKMkTxM2VIla1w

1543873,2015-09-20,4,GvSb0uWmBsB58jbzpogciQ,"First time here, we were impressed by the selection of Eastern European goods and a large selection of homemade sausages. We bought a lot! The pretty blonde gal at the counter was very charming and sweetly devious, giving us samples that convinced Hubby to buy more (despite my warning him that he was buying more than we could possibly eat).

First, the pork schnitzels. Hubby warmed one up in a pan for us to share (they're big). Definitely impressed by the flavor and quality, probably the best schnitzel I've ever had. Growing up in Iowa, those are more common than burgers, and Iowa is the pork headquarters of the USA. And yet, from a small shop in Las Vegas, the best! 

We bought both German and Russian potato salads. I've only sampled them so far, but both are excellent. I was a bit afraid of the Russian one, it looked like it was a heavy mayonnaise base but happily it was light.

We sampled the smoked salmons at the shop, looking forward to getting that on the next visit.

Layered chocolate creme cake - huge piece, not overpoweringly sweet, very good.

Blood sausage - I'll admit to getting this info 2nd hand from Hubby, but he says the sausage is very authentic and minerally (apparently that's a good thing).

Meat Patties - no clue what all is in them, but they look like fat hamburger patties but they taste more like meatloaf. They're very good, and apparently they're ""Just like Oma used to make!""

Lieberkaese - sampled that in the store but haven't gotten into the stuff we bought yet. It's very good, rather like a high quality deli bologna.

We still haven't tried the cabbage rolls, those will be eaten today. Based on their store popularity, I'm sure they'll be good.  Same with the brats.

Do I think we bought more than we can handle? Yep. Do we regret any of it? Nope. :D",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,4,1,5,PXs6sgkM_rWeDGwSAijrFA

I'm definitely going back for a little Polish Ham.  At $7.99/lb they're practically giving the stuff away.  

I definitely need some smoked Ahi.  It's $24.99/lb.  I'm probably going to have to save my allowance a couple weeks to afford some of that, but you gotta do what you gotta do.  Because, Ahi!

It may not be a restaurant,  but it's the even rarer treat of a specialty grocer/deli.  Not only does it have lots of packaged  Eastern Europe/Russian goodies and pickled tastiest and cheeses and soda curiosities and a feast for a curious mind but the meat counter is heaven.

Everything is made in house: from the baked goods, to the hand cured meats and sausages, to the flavorful 'salad' items. And they encourage you to try everything!

I was the only person in the store and I took my time and looked at everything. There are all kinds of fun things to try from Caviar to cookies. I wanted some of everything but I resisted. I was hungry and there for the bratwurst. So, I made my way to the back deli counter. There are many kinds of sausage to choose from as well as various sides. Everything looked good. I had some questions about bratwurst and the woman behind the counter let me try them so that I could tell which one I liked. I loved them both. She had also just brought out some schnitzel and gave me a sample of that as well. It was absolutely incredible. I bought one bratwurst and some sauerkraut for a quick dinner in my car. 

Let me just say this, I went to my car, realized I didn't have a fork, didn't care, ate every bit of it with my fingers and immediately regretted that I didn't buy at least 2 of everything she had. 

I dug around for a napkin, picked the kraut out of my hair and went back to get more. By then there were several people waiting in line and I was out of time and had to leave. I went home sad, very, very sad. 

I think I made a rookie mistake: I hadn't been there before, I didn't know what a lot of it was, I was just there to try it, I can only eat so much, blah blah... When you go, don't be me.

It's like this, EVERYTHING was good. Next time, I'll be getting as much as I can afford and just eat on it for days and I am not kidding. Once you try her schnitzel or sausages you will NOT be the same and I'm not even all that in to sausage. Even her sauerkraut beats any I have ever had anywhere in my life including Munich Germany.

Unlike most American bakery Napoleons, it did not have the powdered sugar and chocolate drizzle on top.  It looked dense, almost like cheesecake; in the display case, but the moment I put a fork in it, the flakey pastry started deflating and the creamy filling oozed out. My moans of delight made my dogs come running over.

Also worth mentioning is the diverse selection of groceries that are hard to find outside of Europe. And the pricing is comparable to American products.  For example a jar of rose hip preserves was under $4. 

Finally, I must mention the owner/butcher/chef and his niece understand customer service.  FREE SAMPLES ARE ENCOURAGED....YAY....",jjc9swFNZZSzUwkqFz_yrQ,2,0,5,dID3CFM8AMftzalxakfemQ

Most reviews have gone into great detail about the various meats: well, they are fresh, natural with no preservatives. 

But I want to mention Michael and Zoya, owner and manager, respectively.
Their courteous service and willingness to engage clients in friendly banter creates an ambience that no chain store in Las Vegas can match. 

My wife is an Asian foodie with high standards... she was very content with today's selections. Myself being Scots-Irish/German, I loaded up with a copious quantity of fresh sausage for the weekend.

Tina's Gourmet Sausage House resembles a small European grocery store, with packaged and frozen goods from several countries located at the front, and the meat department at the rear.  The ambiance I mentioned makes for a very pleasurable experience. Michael's positive attitude made us feel right at home.

She was nice and offered a sample but still not real comfortable answering questions, etc. We asked if she was ""Tina"" and she said no.

As we do... we went through the whole store... shelves were pretty bare and the products they do have, were very spread out to make it look fuller. We picked up several things from the floor and freezer, picked out some fresh sausage for the meat counter, a couple of things from the fresh salads case and 2 desserts. Everything was pretty good that we got... Sadly, not everything made it to our bags. My only guess, is when she was relocation all of our choices from the back of the store, to the check out area at the front of the store, a few things clearly didn't make it, sadly. We were not a big fan of the carrot cake... I'm guessing a good service provides this but the Baklava was wonderful. The cucumber, tomato and onion blend was fantastic. The sausage was good but would have purchased more if we had a clearer understanding of the different types from the person waiting on us.

Located on South Decatur, in the same plaza as Mochiko Chicken, Amena Bakery and Trader Joes, Tina's Gourmet Sausage House is one of those places potential patrons pass by without giving a second thought while individuals opting to take a step inside are in for something quite uncommon in society of commoditized Fast Food.

Owned by Michael Ray and managed by a young woman named Zoya, Tina's is one part artisan Sausage maker and one part importer/purveyor of European specialty goods, a quick look at shelves displaying everything from Breads and Candies to Jams and Pickles, the refrigerator against the wall loaded with imported Dumplings while deli cases sport everything from Organic Sliced Meats to Smoked Fish, Salads and Sausages, at least eight varieties available daily with more depending on special requests or the Chef's choice.

Moving the business from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in 2015, but originally learning the art of encased Meats when growing up in Ukraine, a brief talk with Michael quickly displays his passion for the craft and after discussing the subtle nuances differentiating several products the decision was made to compose an order of six items, Imported German Bread hot from the oven added last minute and split with another patron at $2.50 per half-loaf.

Unfortunately told that few of the desserts are made in-house, the majority actually frozen imports that are either ready when thawed or requiring of little heating time, it was with a bite of Sourdough that the tasting got started and with a robust crust overlying a soft crumb with gentle sours the flavor was everything one might expect from Rye, though a bit of butter may have helped in areas near the heel where the center was dried out.

Finding samples of the Portuguese Sausage less spicy than expected, the texture snappy and proper but not nearly as complex and well-composed as the Hungarian Kielbasa that compared favorably to memories from my youth, it was onward to a chilly Cod and Catfish link that was a bit *too* fishy that the tasting moved forward, only half eaten and really no better once it was warmed up.

Far more affordable than one might anticipate, the whole lot of food only $22.54, Chicken Schnitzel was an interesting dish in that it featured an amalgam of dark and light meat fried together with Bread Crumbs, the Stuffed Cabbage featuring a lot more filler and less meat than my Grandmother's with no favors done to it by the watery pink Sauce.

Passing on Brownies, Blondies and outsourced Pies, instead selecting two Cakes imported from overseas and finished in Tina's oven, dessert proved to be as mixed an experience as the savories before it, the Apple Cake almost like Angelfood with less sugar beneath slices of Fruit while the Brown Sugar may as well have needed a chisel to be chipped away from Coffee Cake.

Certainly a unique store worthy of a look for the attention to detail and a true Artisan's touch, Tina's Gourmet Sausage House is best accessed for exactly what the name indicates of it, though the imported goods may offer a bit of additional intrigue to Eastern European immigrants looking for specifics or locals more interested in novelty packaged goods.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,7,3,mMXxA8I6rlDBDfaFwDjr3g
5604197,2016-01-01,2,GvSb0uWmBsB58jbzpogciQ,"This is a rather new Eastern European market that popped up in the a Trader Joe's shopping center. Until now, Jones market was my to go spot. 
 Here are the good points- they do have fresh baked bread, prepared food and bakery goods, and house made sausage, (very reasonably priced). Their biggest plus, however, is service. The owner is incredibly friendly and accommodating, he goes out of his way by offering you samples, chatting, explaining food. I am Russian and interacted with him in Russian and didn't need any explanations, but he engaged my English only speaking spouse, called him by name and chatted him up. Such a nice change from the rays of sunshine behind the deli counter at the Jones market. 
 The opportunity- selection of product is very modest. If you are looking for a one stop shop Eastern European market, this isn't it. But I love the fact that's it's in TJ's parking lot and service is amazing. 
 Word of warning, having read other reviews- this isn't by any means a restaurant. Come here to grab some pre-made Russian and German foods or a few familiar staples like holodez, pelmeni or buckwheat (for my Russian peeps), but this isn't a ""I'll take combo #5"" place.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,4,3,5,68Yp2urQzawxaBIJ-M0bBw

First half of the store is set up to be like a European market. Don't know much about it but they seem to have a lot of British stuff. 

The back half is what brought me in. Very traditional butcher. Lots of different sausages and fish. A lot of it is already smoked. I wasn't going to buy anything but the guy working the counter gave me some samples and I was hooked. I got the spicy sausage, chicken andouille sausage, and octopus salad.

This is not so much a specialty sausage store as it is a small Eastern European grocery store with a low quality deli meat counter in the rear. Some of the gourmet sausages are still in their plastic package casing from Costco and Smart and Final! The Turkey Breast was Jennie-O! Seriously! We waited for over 10 minutes behind a single customer who was obviously a family member or friend of the clerk talking up a storm and visiting. Another gentleman came out of the back to converse with the woman and the clerk. Never once did they acknowledge our presence. This gave us plenty of time to browse the small store. Observed lots of processed and packaged dry goods with interesting looking labels. The pastry items in the deli case looked old and stale. After waiting an additional 5 minutes and getting nobody to assist us with our potential sausage purchase we left and went to Trader Joes next door where we purchased some fresh brats and went home.
