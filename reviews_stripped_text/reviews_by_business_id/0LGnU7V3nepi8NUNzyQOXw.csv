When the woman in front of me reaches the cashier after ordering, she asks the busy cashier (who is making coffee orders and getting people extra accoutrements, etc. Clearly he's ready to pull his hair out), ""Why is there a twenty minute wait?"". I'm thinking to myself, ""Why are Libyan forces conquering Tripoli?"", or "" Why is the sky blue?"". He shrugs and tells her that they have had large orders. No thank you to the cashier, she takes her food and leaves.

The cashier was pleasant to me and I went on my way; quickly grabbing a seat before someone would take one of a few last tables. I forsook grabbing a napkin so as not to loose the table. Six minutes later my Nova Lox Sandwich arrives, far earlier than said. Lox spread on a cheddar cheese toasted bagel with a great amount of lox, tomatoes, capers and red onion. This was worth the wait in line during the busy breakfast rush. I shoved it down my throat, with lox cream cheese probably all over my face due to the forsaken napkin. 

I don't care because now the line is twenty deep and going outside the door. The manager escorts a woman interested in being hired there towards the door next to me. The woman gives the manager her name. Most of the restaurant has rubbernecked to see the manager talking to the woman. Group think: ""please go back to making orders!"". The manager tells the job seeker that she will be going through applications in a week. Although none of my business I'm thinking why would she let a good candidate continue to seek other employment when this place clearly needed help? I'm from a big city and having been a retail manager myself, I personally would have told the woman I would get back to her within the next couple days. Clearly no sense of urgency here, just mentioning it, no stars deducted for perceived inefficiency. 

The woman next to me gets her order delivered to her table. She barks orders at the delivery woman. The customer does not say thank you. I just want to get the heck out there due to the ingratitude of these patrons. Perhaps I'm too sensitive but I notice details, hence a yelper. The bagel was delicious.

The wifey and I often come here on a Sunday morning as a breakfast ritual just to hang out and enjoy nice bite (and because BabyStacks Café nearby is always busy).  Funny enough, this Einstein is very occupied during the weekend!  A good size line and crowded tables often await us.  But no matter since the wifey needs her morning cup of Joe!  This location is a popular early destination for folks living nearby as well as those getting back on the road for the trek back to their home state.

Wifey is pretty basic when it comes to ordering, a cup of coffee, and a bagel (toasted) with a shmear.  Her bagel and flavor of shmear will vary by visit, but her cup of coffee is a constant.  She gets it often enough she's bought one of those refillable mugs from Einstein's, you get a nice size on it, plus it saves you in the long run on refills.  I myself am OK with the food there, I like a fresh toasted bagel with shmear, but I often go up to the menu board to get something.  Now, we all know that Einstein's does use microwaves for much of their food items because let's face it, there is no large kitchen there.  Much to my chagrin, things like their egg products and bacon and such they use gets nuked in the microwave.  So if you're looking for a fresh fried egg on your bagel (damn that sounds delicious), you're not going to find it here.  I've gotten a bagel sandwich with egg at Einstein's before and it's not usually one of my favorites.  I stick with a few things there.  For some strange reason I like their Chicken Salad deli sandwich.  To me it's yummy!  Chunks of chicken, grapes, almonds, and craisins in a vinaigrette dressing, topped with lettuce, tomato, and red onion on wheat?  Sign me up!  I like it very much, even for breakfast!  Another one of my favorites is the Thintastic Chicken Pesto bagel sandwich.  Sliced chicken breast strips, roasted tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil pesto on a thin bagel of your choice.  For not being a 100% in house made sandwich it is pretty good.  Most of their sandwiches come with a pickle, and a side of potato salad, fruit, or a bag of chips.  I opt for the potato salad most occasions because Einstein's actually makes one I like.

A bit of a downer for me is the pricing.  Einstein I guess can be considered 'gourmet', their prices reflect it!  Not the cheapest for a sandwich or any of their combos.  A sandwich combo will run in the $6 range, and that doesn't include a drink!  Luckily I just bum off some coffee from the wifey.  Even a basic combo of a bagel, shmear, and a small coffee will run folks back $3.99 plus tax.  If I get this combo I guarantee you I will be left HUNGRY.  And hungry boy = grumpy boy!  Compare this to the $3 Subway breakfast combo (6 inch breakfast sandwich and drink) right next door and you can see the gap in food portion.  I will give Einstein's their due though, the bagels are A-OK.

Service is usually good for us, as we often get the manager to take our order.  She's attentive, and quick on her toes.  The thing that takes the longest is actually getting our order.  But that's no problem, I get to hang out with the wifey longer.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,0,3,94SJzj47ApwEFzaHEyY4Tg

I ordered a toasted everything bagel with butter and a medium coffee. I paid and they gave me my cup. I figured by the time I made my coffee the bagel would be done. Nope not even close. The people that came in after us got their order but we were still waiting. More then 10 minutes after ordering our bagels finally showed up. First of all my bagel only had butter on one half. Really? I had to go back up and get butter because who wants to eat a dry toasted bagel. Second my bagel was cold. It should had just been just toasted and still hot or at least warm.

4655519,2014-07-07,7,0LGnU7V3nepi8NUNzyQOXw,"When it comes to bagels, Einstein Bagels is 3 5 star good. However, they are nothing in comparison to the Bagel Cafe and New York bagel shops. Since there is only one bagel cafe and the New York bagel shops are nearly 3,000 miles away, my tastebuds coexist with Einstein Bagels.

    Today, I stopped off at this Einstein Bagels on the way to Spring Mountains National Recreation Area. It is off the 215 Freeway along Durango Drive and just south of Centennial Hills Hospital. It was a breeze to get to.

  The experience I had at this location is really no different than the other Einstein Bagels I reviewed. I walked in. I ordered and gave them my name. I walked past the display case of bagels where I paid. The cashier handed me a coffee cup before they brought me my bagel. I had the choice of few brews of coffee to fill the cup. The coffee is on a par with the coffee house chains. The way that I could tell the coffee us good is that I don't need syrup in it. The refills are unlimited. A few minutes after sitting down, I was biting into the toasted sesame bagel with salmon shmear. The bagel was 3.50 star good. That puts it on the same league as a Dunkin Donuts bagel. The coffee and bagel with salmon shmear duo came out to $5.01. Not bad! But not spectacular! My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which is the exact one that dates back to my 2012 review on this company is that they don't include a side item like a pickle or potato salad. It takes some getting used to when the New York bagel shops would include potato or macaroni salad and a pickle with the meal. Even their more $ nova lox sandwiches don't include a side. Maybe thats why Einstein Bagels only lasted around three months in the New York market.

  When I returned to my car, I drove toward Durango Drive with no enthusiasm for Einstein Bagels. If Dunkin Donuts was on the right side of the road I probably would of chosen it over Einstein Brothers. My realty is that because Einstein Bagels is all Vegas really has for bagel shops with the exception of Bagel Cafe and a couple others, I will settle for 3.5 star bagels.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,7,8,3,Q-OrpHv3BOPNe3y_xYkE7A

Service is usually painfully slow, but today was such a pain. Ordered two different bagel sandwiches and a new stuffed bagel bite thing to go. Took forever, per usual, to get our food despite no one in line ahead of us and three people behind the counter. They bring it out, but not to go. So they wrap everything up and we are on our way. They forgot the small bagel bite. Both of our sandwiches were the same (we ordered two completely different sandwiches). And there were no napkins or forks for our fruit. One of these days I'll remember it's worth it to just drive five more minutes and go somewhere else.",ESns3CCZ8lUXOuGulnudYA,2,0,1,LljWqc1zLiHk_iQE7R3W7A

Not only have we noticed the two girl workers not doing anything besides make fun of customers who come in and leave, they treated us badly as well. I didn't know customer service consisted of ""what do you want"" no goodmorning, no upselling, no help with the menu, literally nothing. Dirty looks included. We sat in the booth/table in the back and observed. The girls stared at us, finally one brought us our food and just put it down on the table, stared at us and walked away. I don't know if the manager is just blind to all of this or just doesn't care because she does nothing about it. The manager and the nice young man working were working really hard to prep the whole store while these two girls socialize and make fun of customers and from what I notice only smile and greet attractive young men who come in.

Staff is not very upbeat, my husband was trying to make a joke, the lady did not even smile but almost started arguing....

Asking for any modifications is not a good idea - I've asked before to go easy with the cream-cheese  so they went light on everything.

I'm a bagel guy, i love me unique flavors of bagel and spread. Same goes for my mom, dad on the other hand is a plain with plain... maybe jelly if you harass him enough.

My all time favorite is the asaigo cheese with honey almond smear. Although mom got me hooked on her latest creation. Its the cinnamon crunch sliced and toasted with butter. Tastes just like the cinnamon toast my granny would make in the oven when i was a kid. Mom remembers it that way to, so somehow they are able to replicate it, Mom time to pick up your game!

I haven't had any of the coffee, but my girlfriend Beth has. She said it was good and drank it all. The yogurt it ok, im not a fan of the bagel bites.",bvr5-SZikO9DexmFmCn_4g,0,0,4,VDh70rBUVfmOCoDQjUjK3A
