What I found were streaky windows, no ambiance and no taste.  Ceasar salad was overdressed and warm. The calamari was overcooked and chewy. Steak and frites were cool not warm and just bland. The salmon was good flavor and temp but the sides a throw away. I poked fun at the dated plating style but that wasn't really bad. The chocolate soufflé was good texture but tasteless. The service asked how the entree was before either of us took a bite then only returned to clear. I debated a 3 rating but when you pay over $50 each for a dinner, I think it should be good- and this wasn't. Go follow DW to their new location at the Grammercy for flavor.",7lxEzQEcVTsuRebyA7hfhg,0,0,2,hRCzf0MMqQdT9FAHzrJ4nw

It comes with crisp matchstick fries.  Enjoyed the Cobb salad, too.  Cobb salads can get a little run of the mill, but this had the best quality ingredients all around. Nicely presented and accompanied with the perfect vinaigrette on the side. The lunch menu has the right amount of choices; they also have a great wine list.  It seems that there's a lot of care and attention in the kitchen.  Delighted to have Andre go suburban!  Look forward to trying for dinner!",Eb30s8O8vBLaREmw8ivatg,1,1,5,gSZ8eD3zEEm-ixLsu2liYw

This last visit on Friday was outstanding.  The food was delicious and our server could not have been better (thanks Nathaniel!), along with the other help.  I attribute this to the review in the LVRJ newspaper that mentioned the poor service.  What a turnaround!  

As for the food, we had lunch - French onion soup (excellent), a chicken sandwich and a burger, with, of course, duck fat fries.  The chicken sandwich was declared to be delicious and my burger was one of the best I've had.  Perfectly cooked with great condiments.  The bread and butter are both wonderful.

The next course was a stunning preparation of foie gras with thinly sliced cooked apples and a vanilla sauce, which paired beautifully with my champagne.  Our entrees were the salmon with lentils and the hangar steak with green peppercorn sauce and Duck fat fries.  Everything was flavorful and perfectly prepared.

560355,2017-06-03,0,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"Not sure I could have been more underwhelmed by the experience at Andre's Bistro and Bar. The only thing positive I can say is there was a warm greeting when we walked in and our busser was attentive when it came to refilling our water. 

That being said, the overall service was bummer. Our waiter took our order, ran over to tell us that if we wanted the soufflé we had to put the order in RIGHT AWAY, and that was the last time we saw him. 

Our cheese plate came out on a fly by with no explanation of what was on it. I had to flag someone down to ask what some of the accompaniments were. Then our entrees with the same drop off. 

The ribeye I ordered looked a lot more like the ""flat iron"" they had on the menu and was cooked all the way through. (Ordered medium rare)... I've seen better steaks on IHOP commercials. My wife's ricotta gnocchi came out surrounded by a messy plate of inedible bitter greens and a mint ""paste."" 

If you're thinking ""why didn't you send it back"" I didn't see anyone again until our water glasses were empty and wasn't going to just sit there until someone noticed us. 

I did wind up flagging down our busser again, this time to pay, after we sat there for another 10 minutes after finishing our meal. 

Maybe it was an off night as I have heard good things about Andre's but if so, it was a James Harden level off night.",lfsTIgnYl1g1lRB3CYiF4g,0,0,2,ZMhrZGY7EBGQLndSCQbodA

We were first to arrive at 3pm with a reservation- after others arrived they were served before us- the waiter told us it took so long because of the risotto. The ambience and décor are really lacking in creating an enjoyable setting to dine in. I am really surprised this is Andre's because I am familiar with his reputation for quality food. I have lived in Las Vegas for 40 years -I know his background. I find it hard to believe this venue will survive with so many choices here. An all around bad experience.

Pros:

- Lobster was delic.!  Peeps burgers and steak dishes were killed.

- Great portion for the price and good selection for lunch!

- Customer Service...as a team, they worked great together.  They even offer 10% discount on the next lunch visit with a receipt.

Cons:

- Customer Service...mixed up included green salad vs fries, but was quickly addressed and the fries was included at no charge.  Missed my lemons with my water and a bit slow on others refills.  They're new, just need more time to floss out the minor kinks.

- Fries was kind of salty...maybe it was just me having a low sodium preference.

- We were placed in the back of the restaurant when there was only two other parties there.  No biggie...just odd, but it worked out cause we were kind of laughing too much.

862823,2017-07-02,0,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"Dropped in due to the good reviews.  I liked it.  Low key, friendly, neighborhood place.  Nothing fancy, just a cool place to drop by with friends and family. 

It's a Bistro, so the portions are smaller, and you order a la carte.

I had the fillet and then added a green peppercorn sauce.  I also had the green beans with almonds.  I thought the green beans were better than the fillet.  The fillet was small - 6 oz, but I didn't really want any more than that.  I had it medium rare, but I would have preferred a little more sear on the outside.  It had a piece of gristle, or silver skin running through, but it was still good.

I also had the Caesar salad, which over dressed, but the flavor was good.

So why the 4 stars?  The service was really good, and the vibe was friendly.  If I lived in the area I would go there all the time.  Andre's has a good bar set up, so dropping in and sitting at the bar would be an option.

The beer selection is not very big, but well thought out.

1231644,2018-06-24,0,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"It seems that amazing Las Vegas has more talented chefs per capita than any other destination in the world. And the talent isn't confined to the Strip or even to the city itself. I've found outstanding dining  in every suburban nook and cranny and the prime example of this is Andre's Bistro in Spring Valley. 

Andre's is in a non-descript shopping center on the edge of Spring Valley, near the Wet and Wild water park, and is a bit of a car drive for many people living in the Vegas valley as well as for travelers staying in Strip-accessible lodgings. It's unpretentiously chic, with the ambience of a classic French bistro but, in keeping with the bistro tradition, the food is the true shining star of Andre's. 

Andre Rochat is a bit of a Vegas culinary icon. He ran Andre's, his Michelin star namesake restaurant at the Monte Carlo, until it closed in 2016. Andre's Bistro, run by Rochat's former employees in partnership with him, is the incarnation of Andre's in name and spirit. It's not as fancy or as expensive as the Andre's at Monte Carlo was - I think of it as the acoustic version - all of the quality stripped down to the essential of providing great food.

I started the night with an OG Mai Tai, prepared the way I like it; tart, not too sweet, and as smooth as liquid silk. I loved the maraschino cherry garnish, they use the real kind, not the radioactive fluorescent ones. It was the best mai tai I've ever had, the night was off to a good start. 

The menu is classic French, not Cal-French, so they don't do anything odd or extravagant here. I was pleased to see Dover Sole on the menu ($55, that's a rare find). I started with the Spring Risotto ($22, $15 for happy hour) made with ramps,  brussel sprouts, and goat cheese. It's served al dente (as stated on the menu) and, while I wasn't used to the crunch in the rice, it wasn't unpleasant. The risotto itself was hearty and vibrant, imbued with the earthiness of the ramps and brussel sprouts. I loved the burst of sweetness the tomatoes provided. Overall, it was a well-rounded dish, surprisingly, crunchy rice and all.
 
Next I moved on to the Moules Frites ($15 for happy hour), made with PEI mussels, garlic, parsley, saffron, and cream. It is served with a side of duck fat fries that were perfectly flavorful and crisp. The mussels theselves were fresh and clean tasting and greatly enhanced by a delicious broth that I couldn't stop sopping up with my bread. My dining companion got the Potato Gnochhi and it was the lightest, fluffiest gnocchi I've ever had. All the dishes were delicious, but I'd say the gnocchi was the big winner of the night. 

Andre's also has a full stocked bar and a decent wine list with French labels at reasonable prices. In summary, the restaurant is a local gem. The values during happy hour are insane and include Saturdays from 3pm - 6pm. It's destination dining for both visitors and locals looking for high-end,  Strip quality food in a comfortably non-bougey setting.

Restaurant js a good size in a strip mall. We went about 6:30 on Saturday night and it was not very busy but not slow either. We were seated immediately. Service was fast waiter came right over to take drink orders and bring bread. Bread was very good. 
 The menu has a good variety of options of French food as well as some salads and ""American"" sides/ appetizers. Prices were ok a little on the high side but the restaurant looked to be presentable.

I had the Cobb salad and a side of sweet potato fries. Definitely get a large on the salads as the small is in a pretty small extremely shallow bowl and you don't get much salad (despite asking the waiter what the size of the salad was). Other than that salad looked and tasted fresh. 
 Fries were pretty soggy and portion was pretty small for $6. 

The reason for this place getting 2 stars is, before I left I used the bathroom and it was DISGUSTING. Paper on the ground, garbage overflowing, feces in the toilet bowl stuck to the side, some brown contents all over the sink (see pictures) ... this tells me that If a restaurant can't keep a clean  public space such as a bathroom you never know what there kitchen looks like where the public doesn't see.

1373468,2017-04-03,0,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"One of the worst brunch spots ive been too in Vegas. I dont even know where to start: the drink service was quick but pricey, the food service was slow and the food wasn't all that great when it did arrive. It's breakfast for goodness sake!!!! I honestly felt cheated for my time and money. I'll stick to Paris Baguette Cafe or DW Bistro which are both about 5 minutes east of here. 

Our party of 14 were sectioned off so we couldn't gauge how busy the other side was, but it took over an hour for the food to come out and when it did it came out it came in spurts. A few people got their food and by the time they finished the other people got theres. It was a disjointed mess. At some points people from the party had to find the server and ask what was going on. She kept saying the same thing -""its coming out"". We werent in a rush but at a certain point theres only so much you can drink and you start to notice how long youve been waiting. I thought about cancelling my order and cutting my losses. 


The food arrived ONE HOUR and 15 MINUTES after ordering. During this wait no apologies, no visit from the manager, no comp pastry baskets. Nothing.  Just wait, wait and wait so more, pay and leave. No hospitality. No one even ordered a well done steak. Just eggs, a burger and a few salads. I was so disappointed when my food arrived. For one, I told the server specifically how I wanted the fried egg cooked and it came out over easy! I told her to cook it hard. The food came back made correctly in under 5 minutes. I was surprised because the entire order took over an hour! The Croque Madame was a sad dish to have waited over an hour for. I've had better at walk up cafes made in 10 minutes. This one was just a burnt piece of toast topped with a thin slice of ham, swiss cheese and bechamel sauce and a egg on top. Its typically a sandwhich with two pieces of bread and stuffed with ham and cascading with bechamel sauce, but these guys are apparently cutting costs. The top looked burnt, dried out and as if it's been sitting in the expo window for the better part of 30 minutes. The duck fat fries are NOTHING to write home about. Ive had better fries at McD's. 

Also the bottomless mimosas are more than most entrees on the menu at a staggering $24.99. I'm not sure when the trend started to charge locals so much for cheap champagne bought at whole sale prices mixed with ready made orange juice. Not even fresh squeezed or even with a garnish on the glass. 

While the server was nice i don't think she cared because she was getting an automatic gratuity. We all finished in 30 minutes and there we started the wait again as she scrambled to organize the checks. She had over an hour to get those ready.  Thankfully, i paid cash.

The new location is in a plain strip mall, but the restaurant itself has great curb appeal. It has the same layout of the former DW Bistro, but it has a French farm-to-table feel once you walk inside.

The blonde waitress we had (apologize that the name escapes me if she is reading this) was excellent and has been with Andre for a number of years. Always a good sign when the staff is loyal to the brand! We all ordered French onion soup and I had the mussels and frites. French Onion Soup was a tad underwhelming considering that we were at a French restaurant but the mussels and frites were divine. Mussels is my go-to order whenever I see it on a menu, and Andres' mussels reminded me of the time I lived in France- so good!

Of course we had to try the grand mariner soufflé which was the best thing I had all night. Make sure you place your order with your food! It was heaven.

Beautiful wine selection, by the glass is $2 off for happy hour. I ordered a sparkling rose which was light and crisp. 

Our server was very friendly and suggested some good vegetarian and Vegan options. I love gnocchi so decided to try that. It was delicious, served in a light creamy butter sauce, tender melt in your mouth gnocchi topped with crispy thin onions. My friends tried mushroom risotto which was fantastic.

The food quality coupled with reasonable prices prove that ""you don't need a silver fork to eat good food,"" - a quote  by Paul Prudhomme featured on their exterior that encapsulates what Andre's has to offer. 

HAPPY HOUR: My first visit for HH was stellar. Bar seating, TV tuned to a Spurs game, attentive but unobtrusive service, and incredible food. The frog legs ($8) were a pleasant start to the meal but Andre's burger (a $7 steal!) stole the show, with gooey gruyere, red onion marmalade, and truffle mayo coming together to combine the flavors of a burger with French onion soup. The sturdy pretzel roll held up well, too.  It was marvelous and that burger was on my mind for days. Days! 

BRUNCH: Came with a group and tried several dishes but was less impressed. Standouts were the escargots (so garlicky, request extra bread!), Artisanal Sausage Platter (loved the lamb!), the crispy Liege-style Belgian waffles, classic French Onion soup, duck fat fries, and the desserts (order the souffle ahead of time). Unfortunately, several dishes were marred by cooking errors. The Chicken and Waffles featured a great gravy but limp waffles and soggy chicken, while Andre's Classic Benedict was skimpy on the ham and unremarkable other than the side of crispy potatoes. Most of the items on a friend's charcuterie board went unfinished while a burger was received at the wrong temperature. Our server wasn't around much and refills had to be requested but he was pleasant enough. Perhaps they were understaffed. 

""First we eat, then we do everything else,"" (MFK Fisher)- The dishes I liked I really liked and would return for, while I remain hopeful that a future dinner visit will fare better than brunch in terms of execution and satisfaction. 

TIP: Happy Hour is 3:30-5:30, daily. It's the only time the Bistro Hot Dog is available; it's made in-house and regularly sells out. I've yet to have it but hear it's worth the wait.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,28,22,4,plaiQVR1Y-K1FODE8mPZVg

Cheese Board-the jam served with it was not great and they did have pickles and mustard but I think it just needed more variety with it-maybe more jams or nuts. The cheese was just ok. 

Frog Legs-my husband said he was not a fan

Andre's Burger-I really enjoyed this. I loved the fries too. When I asked for medium, they actually gave me medium. First time that has happened in forever. 

Lyonnaise Salad-way too vinegary. I am not a fan of all frisee salad I have found out. It is too boring for me. The lardons were huge which some would appreciate but I felt it overwhelmed the light frisee.

The lamb shank was better. Very large portion. I don't think they should serve it with orzo pasta, the sauce had an overpowering tomato taste.

1744058,2017-04-10,1,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"Honestly, we had a terrible time at Andre's on Saturday night. It was packed, which is completely expected for a Saturday night, but the restaurant was totally understaffed. It was 20-30 minutes between each contact with our server. We were at our table for 30+ minutes before actually ordering our food and an hour before we got our appetizers.

We ordered the foie gras app and the meat was burnt to a crisp, completely inedible, and couldn't even be cut. The french onion soup was basically salty water. Our entrees were only a little better, definitely needing salt, but it took so long for the server to come over to us that we ended up asking the table next to us to borrow theirs. When we would ask a busser or food runner for something (salt, lemon, more water) they would leave and never come back. Our server was really nice and we actually felt bad for her. It was only her second weekend there and she was totally overwhelmed. 

We finished eating and sat there for another 30 minutes, trying to flag SOMEONE down to bring us our check. The server brought the bill and we gave her our card, only to have her come back 10 minutes later to say that the register was having some sort of issue and our card couldn't be ran. She disappeared again before we could get a proper explanation...we didn't bring enough cash, soooo what would they like us to do? Again, we sat for minutes wondering what was going on. We finally flagged down the manager (who never showed up when we originally asked for her) and asked her what the deal was? We had $50 in cash and the bill was $59...could we use our card to pay or not? She didn't apologize, but told us ""...to just go."" 

I guess we got a few dollars off our bill, but what kind of manager responds like that?! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone and we will never go back. We couldn't decide which was worse, the service or the food. When all was said and done, we were there for two and a half hours and only spent about 30 minutes of that actually eating!!

So i approached the bar and finally made eye-contact with the bartender and said i was there for pick up. 
I received the bill $17 something. i paid with $20 and said just to keep the change. All she said was ""do you atleast want the receipt?"" No thank you or nothing.
Im driving and actually took a look at the bill and this is what really burst my bubble. They charged 18% gratuity ! ... for a Chicken Sandwhich! For a bill of ONE PERSON! FOR AN ORDER FOR PICK UP! Blew my mind, i have never seen any establishment charge gratuity for a one person one sandwhich take out bill. so basically i paid for TWO TIPS, in which they were actually undeserving of it given the lack of hospitality and unfriendly bartending service (blonde hair, no smile whatsoever).

- duck a l'orange: it was cooked perfectly. I was expecting more of a orange taste to it (bc name of entree) but the sauce that came with it is lightly seasoned with the orange taste. 

- lobster thermidor: omg this was phenomenal! It came in a bowl. The bottom of it consisted of mashed potatoes, and there were asparagus and mushrooms. Big chunks of lobster too. 

- creme brûlée: you can tell it's made with real vanilla beans bc there's black specks in the custard. I really liked this dessert. There was a nice crunch from the sugar coating and the custard itself wasn't super sweet.

ricotta gnocchi- we thought it was going to be in a red sauce but surprisingly it was gnocchi with lots of veggies much lighter than what you would expect. And we couldn't taste the ricotta. 

Chicken sandwich- my husband said was weak, tasteless.  We asked for a side of truffle Mayo, there is something up with the truffle here I'm guessing the chef uses truffle salt?! It was salty!!!! 

Pea Barley soup with truffle- the truffle smelled great but it was SOOOOO SALTY ! We sent it back.

French onion soup - that was yummy

Met my ladies for our semi-monthly lunch date. On first impression, I liked the aesthetic changes they made as this space was formerly DW Bistro. (Not that DW wasn't also adorable.) Glasses of sparkling rosé were clinked, and we took on the world from our table in the cozy back corner of the main dining room. 

My friends both enjoyed lobster rolls (they looked good but a bit overdressed for my taste.) I ordered the Thai chicken burger - and folks - it was so clucking good!!

The ground chicken was delightfully seasoned and served on a PRETZEL BUN (Yass!!) with a delicious aioli and sautéed peppers. Duck fat fries were an option but I went with their lightly dressed mixed greens instead. It's been 24 hours and I'm still thinking about this burger, it's that good. 

When it was time to order dessert, one of my friends placed her order for the lemon tart, and our charming waiter asked if we would all be sharing it--and we laughed and laughed. Two lemon tarts and a chocolate walnut gateau later and we were 3 very happy ladies. 

The lightly brûléed lemon wedge was a citrusy flavor explosion, and the tart itself was to die for. I tasted the gateau and it was also heaven on a plate.

We might not have been able to solve all of society's problems during this lunch date, but I'm sure we will give it a go again in the future, and I'm already planning a trip back with my husband for dinner.

We were a group of five and wanted to start with some beignets which we ordered the same time as our oysters, sad to say that the beignets never came. The French Onion Soup was nice and flavorful unlike most of the rest of our meal. The lobster roll was bland and nothing on it popped or stood out as far as flavors. The quiche Loraine was cold, soggy and mucus like. I also ordered a side of the potato salad which when I asked the waiter was explained as a potato dish with eggs mixed with mayonnaise and mustard. When it actually came out it was the same as the breakfast potato dish that someone from our table received, sautéed finger potatoes with onions. I pointed out to the busser and waiter that this was not what I ordered and they then continued to convince me that what I got was actually their potato salad. I didn't want to send the food back or argue with them so I decided to give it a try and was unpleased with how much they lacked salt, but had an overpowering taste of black pepper. When we asked to get some of the food to go one of the ladies that worked there gave us attitude since we had to ask her to wrap it up again after she had left the dish on the table for 20 min after cleaning the table off before the desserts arrived. The desserts on the other hand were amazing. As a group we ordered the milk shake, creme brûlée, the sundae and pot de creme. Mmmmm.... all of them were beautifully executed. I probably enjoyed the pudding dish the most. It was like a chocolate truffle pudding.

-My lobster roll was quite tasty, but the star of the show was the way above average roll. The lobster was well seasoned but didn't taste fresh. Part of my side salad was wilted. 

-My boyfriend got the creamsicle, and to me it was hands down the best thing on the table. 

-My water glass on the table had a lipstick stain. No one noticed. 

-The hostess literally dropped the wine list on the table... like the leaning tower of Pisa fell and crashed into the bread plate, extra flatware, and knocked the salt shaker over. And she just froze then bolted away! And we though ""good evening"" from her at 1 p.m. was weird. 

- The croque madame was solid, and the best food item. 

-The waiter was friendly, prompt, and on his ""A"" game. 

-The single espresso is one of the best I've had at a restaurant on or off the strip. 

-The ginger beer was above average.

-The bartender just stood around texting. 

-The old-fashioned was by far the worst one that I have ever had. I've had some bad ones. Some that have tasted like a bottle of bitters; others that were shaken. Dear goodness, this was an all new low. Plus, I was never asked, which bourbon or whiskey I wanted. It was like drinking Kool-aid and Maker's Mark. So sweet that I took 2 sips and got a headache. Completely undrinkable. 

I want to like this place. I used to eat at Andre's in the Monte Carlo. It was a well-deserved Michelin one star restaurant. This was like the disappointing distant relative to the original.

Andre's Bistro & Bar is the perfect neighborhood French Bistro!

The Monte Carlo lost out when they opted to move on from Andre's, but fortunately for residents on the southwest side of town, Chef Rochart and his team decided to reinvent themselves in a familiar bistro style concept the neighborhood should adore.  

Andre's Bistro & Bar doesn't bring with it all the sophistication of their former establishment, but they do bring absolutely incredible food and excellent service. The setting and ambiance are ideal for their new Summerlin hood--elevating what the former DW Bistro had to offer, while bringing along a few remnants from their previous incarnation. I really enjoyed dinning in this space. It has a warm, inviting felling, and there was a great energy throughout the restaurant the evening that we came.

The food doesn't disappoint. My love and I started with the escargot and then shared the Mushroom Risotto and the Lamb Shank, before finishing our meal off with the Grand Marnier Soufflé. We were dinning with our best friends and took the opportunity presented to try the Roasted Beet Salad as well. The menu features classic and refined French cuisine as well as a few contemporary items. The wine list nice and features some quality new world wines as well as several French wines.

Andre's Bistro & Bar is nice enough to take a date to, but it is really is an excellent choice for a double date, a small group of friends, or a business lunch.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,34,26,4,OqW_nUKtU7cPr-fxMvoBGg

Aside from the frog legs, I saw they also had escargot (which I also like) but I opted for the cheese and charcuterie board instead. The frog legs didn't take long at all. They were good but maybe just a tad bland, though that's less of the frog and more of the batter surrounding it. I would have like a little more flavor, personally. The cheese and meat board was excellent. There was a nice variety of meat, cheese, pate, fruit, and olives. On top of that, combining different things yielded so many different flavors.

The layout is pretty much unchanged, but the addition of dark wood accents and some modern lighting really make this space more intimate. 

While there are some traditional French dishes on the menu, the food is anything but old and stuffy. The sautéed foie gras is a modern dish paired with nutella brioche and strawberries to create an unforgettable combination of savory and sweet. For a more traditional dish, the braised lamb shank was a flawless execution of tender, fall off the bone meat over orzo pasta bathing in a rich, tomato based sauce. Their risotto is outstanding -- great firm texture to the rice, covered in a savory sauce and parmesan. I loved the flavors, presentation, and execution. The charcuterie board was an excellent display of house cured meats large enough to share with a few friends.

Less impressive were the gnocchi dish and mussels. The former was full of summer vegetables and ate more like a salad. The latter entree had some huge mussels that were too chewy and gritty.

Don't forget to ask about their specials. The first night I dined there they featured a lobster thermidor. While expensive, it was a beautiful display of buttery crustacean. 

I can never turn down dessert, and with a souffle on the menu I had to get it. They had both a grand marnier and a chocolate version. If you can't decide, like me, get the half and half. A light, fluffy souffle that showcased both flavors well. Another dessert, the dense, sweet chocolate gateau, was fantastic. Even though it was a relatively small slice it packed plenty of punch.

This is, without a doubt, a special place that's perfect for a date night or group gathering. Let's hope locals will fall in love with it and keep it around for years to come.

Location is great near Patrick and Fort Apache.
We decided to sit at the booth. Place is nice, charming. Waiters were pleasant. From our table I had a great panoramic of the restaurant and spacious patio. The bar well loaded and has a nice seating area.
It was our first time here so I called a friend to join for the happy hour 3pm to 6pm daily including weekend.
We ordered
- escargots de bourgogne persillés
- seared Foie Gras
- plateau de charcuterie
- salade lyonnaise with duck leg confit (in France the salade is with warm potato)
- onion soup
- soufflé half chocolate, half grand marnier

Escargot were ok, I added some salt to make it more tasty. I didn't taste the parsley butter at all :/
Charcuterie platter was well presented. Portion were too small. They could add some fresh grape fruits. Not sure if portion is smaller during Happy hour (saw other yelpers pics) the Pate was 1/4 of the one pictured on most pics posted :(
Seared foie gras was excellent ($24) and the salade lyonnaise as well. Salad dressing was delicious.
If you just want an onion soup for dinner, you might have to order 2... the portion is an appetizer portion.
The Souffle was good but little disappointed. I couldn't taste the good french chocolate at all. CPK chocolate soufflé is even tastier 

My experience was mitigé (half/half). Super happy to have a nice french close by.
The staff was nice and on top of it.
We booked a table at 5:30pm to enjoy the happy hour. It would be nice to make a last call on happy hours.
I just noticed they did not apply the happy hours on 2 items :/ not cool!",XEH2VtVx5ZYATKEM4jZOXg,2,2,4,5TJIQvU9GrdPEyQJ7HxNDA

Started out with a Calamari appetizer which was very good, though a relatively small portion. That doesn't very much concern us...if you want big portions go to Claim Jumpers. 

There then seemed to be a delay and while waiting for our entrees we noticed that no one in the restaurant was being served...kinda weird, but ultimately our plates arrived. The Artisanal Housemade Sausages were very good and they brought mustard and pickles on the side.   Moules Frites consisted of very meaty mussels in a delicious sauce but 1) there were no tomatoes in the tomato concasse...we pointed it out and they brought them out from the kitchen, 2) the duck fat fries that came with were room temperature, 3) they provided no small fork for easier access to the mussels 4) they provided no plate or bowl for the mussel shells. 

Andre's is not overly expensive but neither is it cheap so I expected a little more. But we'll certainly give them another shot since the food quality is high.",5H39aba50fPoga4MK5X49Q,0,0,3,un5-v_5vnifLE1YrM0VA-g

While the dinner experience is rather sexy and romantic, lunch time is upbeat and casual. I have been in multiple times for both lunch and dinner. On my latest visit, my girlfriend and I came in for lunch and ordered the Lobster Roll and Cobb Salad. The Lobster Roll was well seasoned, with chunks of Lobster wrapped up with warm, crispy bread.  It came with garlic French fires...I wish I would have asked to substitute with a salad, as I'm not much of a fry eater. The Cobb Salad showed up with bountiful amounts of bacon and chicken. My friend loved her salad very much. Our waiter brought us a warm baguette and butter as we finished our meals...almost felt like an after thought.

All the dishes I've had over 4 times visits has been nothing but delicious. I would like to come on a Wednesday for their mid-week brunch between 10am to 3:30pm.

I am both proud and grateful that Vegas locals have chef Rochart and his team off the strip and in this neighborhood.

2967899,2018-05-15,2,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"Well, where do I even begin!!! And I wish was saying that because my experience was great, but it was FAR from great. It was actually ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. 

My sister made our Mother's Day reservation via OpenTable for 6pm. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and we were seated WITHOUT any menus. Waited about 10 mins before a waiter came with the menus. Not sure if our waiter even introduced himself. 
We ordered some appetizers while we waited for the rest of our party. When they brought us our waters they mentioned that they would bring us bread. Mind you that we had already been sitting there for quite some time. 
Appetizers came still no bread and butter and two glasses on the table didn't have any water. We had to ask for bread  since they never brought it in the first place. We finished our appetizers and still no bread so we asked for it once AGAIN. 
We began ordering our main courses and to our surprise there were a few items that were no longer available. (At most other restaurants, when items are not available waiters let guests know beforehand, like when they are seated, so that the guests can find other options.) 
Ok, so we've placed our orders and the bread FINALLY got to the table. They couldn't even get that right! We were an 8 top and they serve one half of the loaf (serves about 5 people)! Are you kidding me! We had to ask for more bread! 
The first of the main entrees finally get to the table- they served the kid's chicken fingers and fries and the rest of the table had to wait about another 5-10 minutes before for their food. Of course the orders were messed up. Cobb Salad, which you would assume is a lot easier to make than steaks, arrived LAST! I personally ordered the Flat Iron Steak with béarnaise sauce, cooked medium, and a side of mashed potatoes. BUT I got a WELL DONE steak mashed potatoes and NO sauce. Also, typically when you order steaks, the waiter brings steak knives but just ANOTHER thing we as the diners had to ask for! Oh the reason for my steak being OVERCOOKED?!? Apparently it was sitting under the heat lamp too long! ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! WHAT KIND OF HEAT LAMPS ARE THEY USING!!!! They said they were going to re-cook the steak but at this point I was so anger that this was the experience that I lost my appetite completely. 
They served the filet steak medium rare when it was asked to be cooked medium with a side of mushrooms- of course they didn't get the side right for that either! Instead of mushrooms they brought mashed potatoes! WHAT ELSE CAN GO WRONG!!!!! 
FINALLY, I go find the manager to let him know what's going on. He was going to fix the problem by offering free desserts but at that point we all just really wanted to leave! 
We were seated next to a family who had to be friends or family of one of the waiters so of course they were attended to without any problems. .
THE BEST of all the excuses!!!! Our waiter told us that they had been there all day and that were short staffed- what an excuse for the WORSE SERVICE I HAVE EXPERIENCED!
(Mind you my family and I eat out at plenty of different restaurants all over the city and this by FAR IS THE WORST!) 
I would normally say I would give Andre's Bistro another try, but after everything that happened I AM ABSOLUTELY TURNED OFF. 

I have NEVER EVER jrefused my food be remade. I normally let them fix the mistake BUT this was not going to fix anything. Between the wait time, having to ask our waiter for everything, and messing up on orders. I was over this place!!!!! 

SUCH A SHAME!

2977940,2017-04-02,0,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"We walked in on a busy Sunday morning. This place was filled with people and seemed so promising. Our server was kind and cheerful and seemed eager to serve us. 

 First bad part, we were sat down in the middle of two other tables when there were other tables that were open. The people to our left seemed to be planning a bridal shower and were talking loudly. I came to eat a good brunch, not listen to other people's plans. 

Then, the food took some time to arrive and honestly, it looks way better than it tastes. We ordered the lobster roll, chicken and waffles, and also the chocolate soufflé which added up to about $50. A friend recommended this place so we had high expectations and we felt nothing but disappointment. The lobster roll was covered in mayo, and seemed more like a lobster slaw inside a bread bun if anything. The waffles were super doughy and soft and the sauce made it even worse. The chicken wasn't crunchy what so ever. It was super mushy and I believe it was the sauces fault also. In my opinion, replacing the sauce with maple syrup on the side would have helped make it somewhat better. The soufflé was just nothing special. 

The sad part about it all, was that the complimentary bread and butter tasted better than the meals we had ordered. 

There was also a server walking around, asking different tables if what he was carrying was their order. Sir, you should know where you are bringing your food to.

3011721,2017-04-02,0,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"I will start by saying SOME of the food was tasty however, service was incredibly slow. We were dining with kids and every other restaurant makes sure to at least try and have kids food out first however, the kids waited just as extremely long to get their food as everyone else. Our server asked if we were going to wait to have our food come out so we could continue to enjoy the appetizer we ordered so we he kids wouldn't starve and when I replied that we would like the food, he stated it would be right out ...20 mins later, still no food. It is a shame because there was definite potential here however, the staff seemed confused and were not very efficient. There was no effort to apologize for the long wait times or to even offer anything for the kids who were quite audibly saying ""we are starving"". Once the food finally did come out, it came out one separated dish at a time with the kids food last. Though our wait was over, sadly our disappointment did not end there. 

The food:

French toast: brought out cold. When we sent it back, they microwaved it then walked around confused unsure of which table it went to taking it first to a different table (they sat it down in front of a different person) before picking it back up, going back to the kitchen to figure out where to take it. Once three staff discussed the conundrum, they finally brought the nuked, rubbery, dry French toast back over to our table.

Veggie quiche with side salad: they should change this to side lettuce. A plate full of mixed greens with scarce dressing. The quiche was lukewarm but had a good flavor. 
Kids mac and cheese: this was an adult dish that was put on a kids menu. Most kids don't like 5 different kinds of gourmet cheeses and as a result this dish was a fail. A bubbly pile of cheese with macaroni buried inside was not a hit with the kids.

The beignets, French onion soup, and charcuterie plate were very good. 

Overall, extremely long wait for food, one person in our party got nothing, and  we had to take the kids to lunch after lunch. We even had a delay getting our check and had to enlist the assistance of another server since ours was dealing with yet another complaint and computer confusion. There is potential if they figure out their servers but I won't be back any time soon. 

Note: there was also a circulating gentleman with a beard who appeared to be a manager but I wouldn't know since he made no effort to check on anyone even when they were visible distressed.",QXFn2-Yp3NclQCNr8jyl3Q,0,0,2,1RFR9y4ckxWeB9QOAdg7OQ

I selected Andre's for the three course restaurant week dinner because the menu was a tribute to Anthony Bourdain.
Appetizer - Escargot
Entree - Duck a l orange
Dessert - Chocolate Walnut Gateau

We had reservations and seated immediately. The dining room was nearly filled. Our server Nate was on point. He took our cocktail order right after we were seated and in a few minutes after the cocktails arrived he took our dinner order and provided a loaf of bread with butter, olive oil and balsamic.
The escargots, six to an order were plump and tender in a tasty garlic herb butter sauce. The bread was perfect to sop up the sauce. Yum

The duck breast was cooked medium rare, sliced and sitting on a bed of spinach and  along side the dauphinoise potato cake with duck confit topped with orange slices. Surrounding the plate was a pool of gravy. Wow it was a rich brown delicious gravy.

The chocolate walnut gateau  was chocolate glazed caramel, walnut torte with crème anglaise. A marvelous finish.

A minor glitch during the evening was that a side order of green beans was not delivered with the entree and arrived later after our server was advised. Removal of empty plates was slow which appeared to be the need for additional support staff as the servers were working flat out.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,0,0,4,EHQlHLKKEQH9cSfQPK_hIQ

I came here twice in three days-- once for dinner the second for brunch. I'll start with dinner. 

My boyfriend says I'm in too much of a rush, but I just felt like service was sooooo slow. I'm all for having a nice sit-down meal but I think the first impression should be that you're getting the ball rolling as soon as the guests sit down. I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes left little to be desired and were disappointing. My boyfriend had a filet cooked medium, but it came out medium well+. It was also really thin. When I think of a filet I think of a small but thick cut-- this one was simply flat. For dessert we ordered the apple tart which was underwhelming. We expected more of a crust which is usually the star, but there was hardly any which made us both pick at the apples and leave it alone. 

On to brunch. My latte took a while to come out, and a left it unfinished which I can honestly say I've never done to a cup of coffee/espresso before. There was hardly any foam or steamed milk. The chicken & waffles were weird. The waffle is a cornmeal waffle (not expressed in the menu or else I wouldn't have ordered it) and it comes loaded with gravy. It was good, but not what you think of when ordering this particular dish. My boyfriend's eggs Benedict was so tiny. I'm not looking for American super-sized portions, but everything comes out meek and disappointing. Our dirty plates sat in front of us for a while before they were cleared. 

The salmon was so good, and there were so many other desserts that sounded fantastic, that I think I need to give this place another chance before I decided whether or not this is going to be a regular place I visit.",dLoUSe9E25agXphQjx8Svg,3,1,3,CuZxL-PcOnEgL_eW1VzguQ

Andre's really impressed me. I had never been to the strip restaurant but when I heard this place had opened I had to try it. The sausage omelette was one of top 5 omelettes I have ever had. Ingredients inside were generously portioned and perfectly cooked. The accompanied potatoes were great with a sautéed onion extra included. Accompany that with $25 bottomless mimosas and you'll surely enjoy your meal. The best part is brunch lasts until 3:30pm so your mimosas won't go to waste even if you get a late start to your Saturday or Sunday. 

The only couple of things knocking this review down from a 5 is the bread tasted a little stale/hard and the waiter disappeared for times. He was great when he came around and was very nice, but we couldn't track him down when it came time to order some extras like hot sauce or drinks.

We were seating in what seemed like overflow seating. It was where they may host catering events, etc. I am mentioning this because there were glass racks everywhere and this is where a kitchen door was. Not the most appetizing area to be seating but I can understand why they do it. 

We started with mimosas and bloody Mary's. We did not get the ""bottomless"" option but they're available for a few of their drinks. We then ordered beignets. They were so yummy! Piping hot too. 

We ordered eggs benny, croque madame, and chicken and waffles. They were all delicious! Their fries are fried in fuck fat...need I say more?

3491793,2017-10-07,0,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"We decided to give this place a try for my friends sending off before deployment brunch. The decor is nice and simple and they have a spacious covered patio. We opted to sit outside since it was a nice breezy day. At first the waitress seemed standoffish but after some time she warmed up to us. 

We ordered beignets as appetizers and they were heavenly! Light and fluffy just how they should be made. They have two all you can drink options 1) is mimosas for 24 pp and 2) is the henny sangria for 25 pp. I thought if I paid 25 I could get either or for a nice little mix but I was sadly mistaken. Although the difference is only a dollar, you cannot mix between the two even if you opt to pay the more expensive option. Maybe they should include that as a choice for those looking to experience both.

Now I know you are reading this thinking wow, why only 3 stars everything seems great so far. Well, it's because of my main course. I ordered the Steak Frites and while presentation was to die for the steak was BEYOND bland! Not even the garlic butter on top could make up for it. Having a steak look so marvelous and be so tasteless is really an enigma. Fries were nice and crunchy but could not save this dish. 

My friend ordered a lobster roll and enjoyed his food very much. Other friend had the chicken and waffles which he states wasn't very special.

Our server Nate was really attentive but also allowed us to enjoy our meal without bombarding our table every 5 minutes. We sat further back in the restaurant which was nice because it was still light outside and there are a lot of windows in the front - being tucked back there was a darker and more intimate.

Started off with the charcuterie plate. And a couple glasses of the Sonoma Chard. I'm not joking the meat + cheese portion was soooo small. One roll of prosciutto, and two slices of the thinnest coppa I've ever seen, there was a nice amount of the duck pate (my personal fav) so that was nice. Cheese - blue cheese, taleggio (so yum but just not enough), and the other two were firmer cheeses' and clearly not memorable. There were more toppings (d. mustard, cornichons) then there was meat + cheese. So there's that.

For entrees we both choose the Cobb (salads aren't my usual choice but it was super hot outside and I wanted greens) comes with grilled chicken. I expected it to be warm and sliced chicken. But it was cold and in chunks, which makes me question its freshness. My bf subbed the chicken for steak, cooked to a perfect med-rare temp. Surprisingly the up-charge for the steak was only $6 (about 4oz filet)

We are a party of 4, we ordered 2 escargot appetizer and was surprised to find them very salty, we told our waiter and he quickly returned the escargots to the kitchen, after a few minutes he brought them back and we noticed that the escargot sauce was white sauce instead of garlic butter, the chef has added cream to the dish to tone down the excessive salt, it's was awful and also the dish was cold, the manager returned the escargot to the kitchen to reheat, he personally brought back the dish and was very apologetic, we all tasted the escargot and by now I could have used it to patch a hole in my car tire.

4106841,2017-05-29,3,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"I was expecting more from my meal, especially given early rave reviews, but brunch fell flat.

Andre's Bistro and Bar is a fairly new location in Southwest Las Vegas carrying on the French cuisine of a local institution that used to be on the Strip for a time, and reportedly started out downtown a few decades ago. I was invited to brunch with several Yelp friends and leapt at the chance to try out what really should have been a better meal.

Drip Coffee ($3): good coffee, not that much bitterness, enjoyed it just fine as a black unsweetened coffee as I am wont to do these days, but I had to ask for refills twice before getting more coffee.

Bread with butter (complimentary): a very promising start, with an exceptional sliced baguette and a puck of creamy butter. It was confusing that only part of the table received this offering at the start, while the rest of us had to bide our time until around the arrivals of the appetizers/sides, but it was well worth the wait.

Duck Fat Fries (unsure of side dish price, was grazing on a friend's): the texture was reasonable good, but you'll definitely taste duck fat in every bite. Garlic was also plentiful. Ketchup was standard and came in a relatively small amount; fortunately, it wasn't necessary

Escargots de Bourgogne ($12): six snails served in those ceramic circular plates with indentations. Very good flavors from the herbs and garlic butter and not too chewy. The extra sauce complemented the complimentary baguette quite well too. Despite the cost, I'd order it again.

Andres Classic Benedict ($14): I enjoyed this in the moment, but it really feels like a small portion compared to similarly priced eggs Benedict at similar local spots. The Benedict was tasty and the yolk was runny, but the English muffin was unremarkable and the ham was especially sparse considering how thinly it was sliced. I had to do some excessive manipulation to get ham onto every quarter portion of the muffin. The potatoes were quite awesome, but a side dish does not a great entree make (and the potato portion was also small compared to something like Kitchen Table).

Chicken and Waffles ($16 on menu, but $14 on receipt): flavors were mostly right, although I just couldn't figure out how the (delicious, by the way) Southern-style gravy was supposed to be compatible with the syrup. The main issue is that the dish fell flat on textures. The fried chicken batter had the feel of flour, which shouldn't happen at all even if it's made of flour. The chicken itself was oddly too tender - not mushy, but it just didn't have the heft of being meat. The waffles - love the cornbread composition, by the way - could've been a little more crisp.

Chocolate Pot De Creme ($8): pretty good dessert. Smooth throughout, in both the chocolate and the cream topping. Didn't fall into the trap of tasting like boxed chocolate pudding, which was an issue at another local restaurant but the chocolate could be richer and/or darker. The vanilla ""cookie"" garnish was a bit ephemeral, but fun, and the mint garnish was nice but overpowering if actually eaten.

Grand Marnier Souffle ($12): great dessert overall. Fluffy, lemony, tableside presentation including a hole poked into the top and cream poured into that indentation. Pricey, but likely worth it if you're a fan of the dessert.

Small aforementioned issues aside, service was reasonable. There was a 18% auto-gratuity for our larger group. The receipt has an offer for 10% off lunch (Mon-Fri 11:30am-3:30pm) for a group of up to 6. Decor was welcoming enough, and televisions presumably can be tuned to major sporting competitions, although I wouldn't call ESPN's coverage of college softball that much of a must-see event.

Whether it was flaws in execution (such as the decidedly non-bleu cooking temperature of my tablemate's burger) or overarching recipe issues, my particular meal at Andre's Bistro and Bar did not meet my high expectations. Thus, I can't say that ""I'm a fan,"" although I'd rate my experience 3.5 stars if that were possible on Yelp. That said, I'll keep the place in mind for a revisit because of the praise I've heard and read for other menu items.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,3,3,PEJGQLtAUZqxfvxuJhwFIA

We have been wanting to check Andre's out since it opened, and finally went  yesterday for Restaurant Week, which supports Three Square. The Restaurant Week menu was a tribute to Anthony Bourdain, who we really love and miss. Wife had the French Onion soup and the Duck a l'Orange while I went with the  Beef Carpaccio and Steak Frites. We both had the Creme Brulee for dessert.
The soup was so deliciously cheesy! You could not pull the spoon out without strands of cheese following. The carpaccio was also very good, with the highlight being the parmesan and smoked sea salt.
MY wife had never tried Duck a l'Orange before, and the one time I had it was disappointing. This was absolutely amazing!!! The flavor and tenderness of the duck was perfect. Almost melted in your mouth. She also loved the potatoes with the duck confit. 
The flat iron steak was very tender and surprising thick, even though it was just a bit past my requested medium rare, and even better when dipped in the bearnaise sauce. The duck fat fries were to die for! Hands down the best fries I've ever had. Then again, I've never had duck fat fries before. 
I'm not big on sweets, but I actually finished the Creme Brulee! Perfect balance of sweet and savory for me (yes, I watch way too much Food Network!). My wife said it was the best she'd ever had.

Customer service 2 stars out of 5.
We got there around lunch time, so noonish. It wasn't busy yet, and in plain sight you can see there were plenty of runners and servers. We got seated and immediately greeted by a lovely lady offering us water.  Then our server came, Nick. He seemed loopy. And when I mean loopy, loopy that he was babbling and asking us what time it was ""what time is it, is it 3:30?"" And my husband and I looked at each other like ""it barely noon."" What the heck? Then he proceeded to tell us we should have come at 3:30 cause they have daily happy hour and the pricing was way better. I admit they were, but we were already there, it just made us seem like he didn't want us.We ordered beignets for starters, lobster roll, burger and the soufflé. The food took forever to come out.  I mean 20 minutes for 3 pieces
Of beignets. Not sure if our server had put that order in as appetizer or what. I was also very peeved that they didn't clear our dirty and empty dishes and cups right away. The servers and runners were just hanging out at the bar and chit chatting, and passing our table. But never picked it up to clear our table. Mind you we sat on a two top table so all these extra empty plates and dirty dishes easily overtook our table. After introducing himself to us and getting our order we have not seen our server again. The last time was when we were wrapping up lunch, and asked us if there was anything else we needed. I said ""more ice please."" (I'm 9 months pregnant and there was no air in the restaurant and I was so hot). My extra ice cup never came. . Not sure why there was a lack of service, but something definitely to work on. 

Food review 4/5!
There is no denying the food is amazing. Although the food did take some time to get to the table, it did come out hot and fresh. The food was amazing! Beignet was the amount of sweetness and savory. Omg the burger (very messy eat) had this umami and balance of savory, sweet, and tart which I inhaled. The fries.... duck fat cooked fries... enough said. For dessert the soufflé was delicious. Granted could get it better elsewhere, but still did not disappointed and perfect end of the meal. Keep cooking good food like this, I will come back.",7zZOZu02Mir91ikLG1RAnw,3,1,3,4feoMxPcHLgD-yMVUkIuiQ

4234353,2017-03-06,1,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"While the rave reviews continue, I remain underwhelmed by my experience here. The service was a little rough, but they had opened only a few weeks prior. The food was only average.

I tried the escargot which were standard, but the baguette that came to the table before hand was wonderful and very nice to soak up the garlic herb butter with. The onion soup au gratin was unremarkable. The salmon entree was bland and could have used some help from a sprinkling of salt. Duck fat fries weren't anything special, but fries are always good. When asked if a shrimp cocktail was possible since they offer a raw bar, it took several trips back and forth to see if they could do so, but in the end they were able to accommodate the request and i appreciated it. It would be helpful to have a raw bar menu so that you could build a seafood platter by mixing and matching. The vegetable terrine, or pate as it might have been called, was one of my favorite things to arrive at the table.

When we sat down, I had asked about a bottle of champagne and recommendations. Little was known about whether or not they had a blanc de blanc or which tended to be more pinot noir heavy. Again, they had only opened for a few weeks, and so I don't blame them for this. I was however, given two different answers which didn't inspire confidence. We also had someone join the table about 30min after we sat down and it was like pulling teeth to get another glass of water, a glass for the champagne, and an order in. The service was a little slow, but to their credit they were very busy that night which is a great sign for business.

I went here with a group of people, and got to try several dishes. 
Escargots- 3.5 stars. 
French Onion Soup- 2 stars.  I'm not sure what cheese they used, but I swear it wasn't Guyere. Maybe mozzarella. It was waaaaay too soft. It lacked the slight bitterness that Guyere adds to the dish, so I was disappointed. 

Seafood platter- 4 stars. Such a small platter for a great price. It's perfect for 1/2 person. Yes, not for 2 is my point. 
My salad with the egg on top sounded great, but I wasn't diggin' it too much, since I didn't finish it.

We were seated right away, given menus and a paper bag with the best bread I've had since moving to Vegas - 12 or 13 years of drought wiped away with a single bite.  Dense bread, with a crisp crust, just the way I love but can't find here.  See?  - it CAN be done!

Fortified with my glass of good German Riesling, despite the ""no booze"" warning on the medicine bottle, we ordered a Roasted Golden and Red Beet salad to share.  The kitchen divided it for us, plating each one prettily, and it was soooo good.  It didn't specify greens on the menu, but I was thrilled to see them there.  Just the right amount of dressing was paramount, since I forgot to ask for it on the side.  Wonderful combination of flavors.

My husband ordered Andre's Burger, medium, and it was incredible.  The red onion marmalade was perfect and plentiful, two slices of tomato were actually deep red (an accomplishment in this era of tasteless pink tomatoes), and the bun was brioche-y and lightly toasted, crisp where it needed to be, and soft in the right places.  He had them hold the truffle mayo, but that burger wasn't lacking for anything.  The accompanying basket of fries were enough to feed four.

I went for something different:  Trout Amandine, swimming in a beurre noisette, along with green beans.  I would have loved a larger portion of the green beans, but it was a beautiful dish.  I guess I've become accustomed to spicier food, because I thought it was a tad bland, but I think it was exactly the way it was supposed to be, because I finished every morsel of that sucker, something I never do.  And I was grateful that it wasn't salty at all. 

Our server, Lori (or Laurie?), was friendly and good, and the manager, Cheryl with a C, bade us a warm goodbye.  

I'd love to try their Happy Hour, but having it only from 3:30 to 5:30 makes it unlikely.  So I guess it'll be dinner again next time, and I hope that'll be soon.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,12,8,5,UFmPQm9DEnFST4-qCg-L8g

The Chilled Seafood Platter was tasty, the oysters were delicious, the lobster, however, was a little tough and not one of my favorite parts of the platter.

Well little and behold our experience was FUCKING TERRIBLE! I made reservations through OpenTable which was the best part of my experience. It was quick and efficient completely the opposite experience when we arrived at Andre's. I made reservations for 7 plus 1 child at 6:00 PM for Mother's Day dinner. We arrived a few minutes prior to 6:00 and the table was just about ready. We were seated efficiently and this was the best part of our experience. 

Upon being seated, I don't even remember our server introducing himself. We sat down without any menus on the table it took probably 10 minutes before menus were brought to the table. We ordered appetizers as we waited for the rest of our party and our server mentioned he'd drop some bread off at the table as we waited. As the remainder of our party arrived, they had to ask for waters and asked for bread since we had been waiting for 15 minutes already. As we ordered our main courses, TWO of the options I wanted weren't available, I WISH our server had mentioned that certain dishes weren't available anymore. IF our server had told us dishes were unavailable FROM THE START our party could've had our eyes set on items that were available. I'M DISAPPOINTED ANDRE'S! I wanted a lobster roll but you ran out, I wanted the lyonnaise salad with duck confit BUT you ran out as well. It's common courtesy to let your guests know upon seating that certain items were not available anymore. 

Moving forward, once our appetizers arrived, we noticed bread hadn't been dropped at the table yet and two water glasses hadn't been filled either. We asked once more for bread and water and they said they be right back. So as we waited for the water and bread we dived into our apps. By the time we finished our apps bread hadn't been served yet and water glasses weren't filled. I was trying to stay positive about our experience but I have to admit this was FUCKING TERRIBLE! 

Finally receiving bread after 30 minutes and all our apps were finished, the server brought 1 roll to serve 8 people so yet again we had to ask for another roll. We waited another 15 or so minutes for our main course items to come out. As soon as they arrived many more issues arose. All dishes were served EXCEPT the Cobb salad, WHICH admittedly is easier to make than cooking a steak to perfection. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!? Then as one of the steaks were brought out and ORDERED as MEDIUM it was cooked to WELL DONE! And the reason / excuse for the execution was ""it was left under the heat lamp too long"" YOU'RE KIDDING ME RIGHT?! It's one thing to make up a reason to a guest who doesn't know much about the restaurant industry, but for me the excuse is bullshit. What kind of heat lamps are you using?! 

After approaching the manager of the situation, he said he'd comped some desserts but at this point why would we want anything when everything went wrong. I'm livid about this experience. On a special occasioned day like Mother's Day I would like to think that management would have been better prepared for large parties by staffing appropriately. But unfortunately, we were given pitiful excuses and terrible service.",V0GV8oGj4G_u5MBZEZt18Q,3,0,2,AG_uoY39aBYVqR1JVyy1sg

As a visitor to the desert annually, we tend to venture off strip to privateer establishments to support local business

Andre's, a bit of hike from the Strip, did not disappoint

Our table of six started with charcuterie and cheese boards and ended with a souffle, creme brulee and a lemon tart

Main brunch items included were lobster roll and fries, chicken and waffles, veggie quiche, cobb salad, chicken caesar salad and spinach omelette

The weakest dish of the bunch was the chicken and waffles imo....the waffle did not hold up well to the gravy slathered on and ended up being soft and mushy

Overall, excellent attention to detail and execution

Andre's had a romantic. darkly lit vibe, great for dates and couples.  We started out with a cocktail, can't remember the name but it had ginger syrup.  The flavor reminded me of Chinese medicine tonics, not too bad.  There was plenty of french bread and butter.  Be careful not to fill up on that. The escargots was OK, it was covered in a parsley butter sauce, a little different.  The 'piece de resistance' was the Andre burger, it was moist flavorful, well seasoned and not a hint of dryness.  Definitely one of the best burgers we've ever had.  The duck fat fries were yummy, so were the sweet potato fries.  The fois gras hot dog was fine, though the burger beat it out.  The desserts were pot du creme, a fairly rich chocolate mousse and creme brulee.  Both were excellent.  We were the waitress's suggestion and took a bite from each to mix it up.  

The best thing was the bill was only $43 including tip because of the 3-6pm happy hour special.  Each entree was only $7 the burger, escargots and gourmet dog.  The main entrees were a little more.

Food: 3.5 stars 
Atmosphere:4 stars 

I have been here quite a few times for both brunch and dinner. I enjoy some of the items a lot but I feel like they need to work on consistency here. The services here I received majority of the time also turned me off. 

Services: on my recent visit, this old waiter with the accent made me not wanting to come back. He had my table before the recent visit as well. I was not a fan of him because he's not polite and borderline rude. On our entire visit, he only came to check on us once at the beginning and handed us the check. I had to get another server to take our order. And the other server was the one who came back and refilled the water. He explained to me that the older gentleman was ""busy"". He passed by our table several times. He never once acknowledged us. What was the worst was when he handed us the bill, he didn't say anything AT All! Not a thank you, not a sorry that I wasn't able to take care of you guys earlier. Just dead silence. He needs to be trained how to be a server. His behavior was absolutely not acceptable. I appreciate the other younger server who took care of us though. 

Food: I like the food here for the most part. However, they are not consistent. 

Things I have tried: 

1. French Onion Soup (3/5): I loved their French onion soup the first time I've had it and I recommended it to my friends who lover this dish. However, like other yelper mentioned, where's all the cheese? For some reason, the cheese wasn't there the second time I had it and it was disappointing. 

2. Lyonnaise Salad (5/5): I usually add the duck with my salad. It is delicious with the perfectly poached egg. They can also split into two for you. You can add additional egg for another person. 

3. Escargot (4/5): the sauce is yummy with their baguette. 

4. Seared Foie Gras (4/5): I've only had it once. It was good but not the best I've had.  

5. Moules Frites (2/5): it was lacked of flavors and a boring dish. 

6. Flat iron steak (2/5): I ordered medium rare and it came out medium well?! Did not enjoy my steak at all. Duck Fat fries was still good then. 

7. Andres burger (5/5): the burger is really good! I suggest your share the burger and get a salad with someone else. The flavor was excellent. However, it's quite greasy to eat the whole burger if you don't have a big appetite. 

8. Chicken and waffles (2/5): what happened to the whole waffle! We only got half of the waffles. The pictures from other yelper came with the whole waffles (4pc). We only got 2 pieces. Since we were not that hungry, we didn't ask the server. Even the two pieces were super tiny. I wouldn't order it again. Better flavored chicken and waffles elsewhere. 

9. Duck Fat Fries (3/5): I used to love it but on my recent visits, the flavor of duck fat was not there. 

10. Soufflé (5/5): Love the grand mariner soufflé here. One of the best in town. 

11. Quiche Lorraine (4/5): I enjoyed the quiche. But the potato on the side was meh. 

Their kitchen needs to be more organized too. One time I took my friend there to celebrate her engagement. We basically finished my dish before they were able to serve hers. She ended up getting it togo. In all, there's definitely recommended dishes from this place, however, if the consistency and quality of the services can't be provided. I foresee this place will have the same fate as the one in Monte Carlo and Alize.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,4,3,3,n5gZ02s6hoxFWTBjV5F4SQ

We were seated right away even though we got there 15 minutes early, a plus in my book. The place is minimally decorated which gives off a more sophisticated look. Even though the tables are spaced closer than I would've wanted, it didn't deter my excitement in finally trying this place. 

Along with the regular menu, a prix fixe menu was offered for the night. I perused what it had to offer and since I'm not really a big fan of oysters we decided on doing ala carte instead. 

We started with the bread. Conscious enough not to fill up on it, and making sure we had room for dessert because after all that was the main reason I wanted to try Andre's lol. We were undecided if appetizers should be ordered but ultimately gave in. Calamari was lightly crisp and served with a sweet Thai Chili sauce. For our entrees Hubby opted for the 10 oz flat iron steak with bearnaise sauce as recommended by our server, with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Honestly that sauce was not even necessary. That steak was perfection! Tender and flavorful, mouthwatering. I had my eyes set on the Roasted Chicken breast with mushrooms, bacon, pearl onions and fingerling potatoes. Moist with crispy skin, deliciousness in every bite. 

Make sure you let your server know ahead of time if you're planning to get soufflé for dessert, it takes about 25 minutes to make it. Lemme tell you, it's worth waiting for and worth all the calories! It was lusciously gratifying.

5278864,2017-05-10,3,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"Impressed from the moment Mark Purdy and Joe Marsco first opened the doors to Andre's Bistro & Bar, the transition from a fine-dining stalwart inside the Monte Carlo to a casual French bistro in the former DW Bistro space originally marred only by music that was both too loud and out of place, a recent return for brunch with out of town guests has shown the restaurant to have only gotten better in the intervening months, a shake-up at Alize necessitating a split of Mark's time doing nothing to diminish the quality of a kitchen under the guidance of Marty Red DeLeon Lopez.

Now approaching the four-month mark, early struggles to understand a new market ironing themselves out with time, Spring sees Andre's welcoming guests for both Lunch and Dinner on weekdays plus weekends at Brunch, a party of 4 met by Mr. Marsco soon after entering with seating quickly offered along a banquette suitable for six, the extra space needed as the decision was made to trust the kitchen carte blanche.

Originally decided upon based on two Southerners' desire for French food, their visits to both Bouchon and Bardot favorable on previous trips to Sin City, it was with pleasantries exchanged and Coffee from Las Vegas' own Vesta Roasters soon flowing that Chef Marty approached the tableside telling the group menus would not be necessary, ""I hope your brought an appetite"" never as ominous as it seems when it promises twenty different dishes coursed out over a total of just under two hours and twenty minutes.

Told that Chefs Rochat and Purdy were frequently in and out, the recent hiring of Joshua Bianchi at the top of the Palms likely to see Purdy back on a more consistent basis soon, brunch at Andre's once again began with two treats from Chef Tammy Alana, the Beignets dusted in Powdered Sugar still every bit on par with the best of NOLA while the Pastry Basket yielded a far more crunchy Croissant than last time, the Almond version more like the Danish terms of consistency while the Peaches and Cream replicating sunny-side Eggs remains as fun as it is delicious.

Both starting and ending with Chef Alana's sweets, the bulk of the meal a steady flow of Rochat classics and several brunch favorites, round two was comprised of two rashers of sweet and smoky Bacon as well as the Escargots de Bourgongne plus Andre's ever impressive collection of housemade Pates and imported Meats and Cheese, the Bacon-wrapped Pate as chunky and funky as many served in France while the Bermuda Triangle, Cherry Moustarda and Rillettes all went well with a Warm Baguette, still one of the Las Vegas' most impressive complimentary Bread services.

Attempting to take it easy on the Carbs, though the quality Butter and housemade Jams made such a thing more challenging than usual, a course most easily described as ""Eggs"" arrived next, both Andre's Classic Benedict and one with Smoked Salmon pitch-perfect beneath thick Hollandaise and soft-poached Yolks while the Brioche at the base of a Croque Madame was thinner than in the past and thus more typical to that served in France, a good thing for those who value authenticity as well as folks who which to save more room for the generous helping of buttery Breakfast Potatoes or Fries cooked crisp in Duck Fat.

Continuing to put its name into the hat for Sin City's best Chicken & Waffles, the juxtaposition of soft Cornbread and crunchy Buttermilk Batter plus Country Gravy admittedly more Southern USA than South of France, those looking for something a bit less heavy would be well advised to check out Andre's Maine Lobster Roll served on toasted Bread with just a touch of Mayonnaise, the duo of Quiches also both well made with good Custard and a clean-edged Crust, the Vegetarian version a bit more balanced as the combination of Bacon and aged Comte in the Lorraine came across a little more salty than some might want.

Getting full at this point, though happy to set aside any plans for weekend productivity in exchange for a truly grand finale followed by a parade of Desserts, it was alongside an Herb-Butter soaked Steak cooked Medium-Rare that two slices of Foie Gras and Nutella Brioche were served topped in Strawberries and Sauternes Glaze, the carnivorous more than happy to over-indulge while those fond of pastry thankfully held back a little bit, the Float, Sundae and Crème Brulee all quite good but difficult to gush over while the rich Pot de Crème, tangy Lemon Tart and elegant Walnut Pie with Chocolate and Caramel were all beyond reproach...and at $8 each a veritable steal for Desserts of such quality.

*****Offering a menu at Brunch that can go toe-to-toe with names like Thomas Keller or Michael Mina, the prices generally discounted by at least 25% for comparable plates, Andre's Bistro & Bar has achieved in short-order what many restaurants strive a lifetime for in a city known for rushed openings and fast shutters, a destination spot in the neighborhood that is as impressive to tourists as it is a gift to locals.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,7,5,VFU9ClgY54DCxw6XWWLCrQ

The downside is, they took the croissants off the menu for whatever reason known to man.  We hope they have an epiphany and put them back on.  Bon' Apetit, my sweets.",Sme_0jk0mJPWIMjGzKqBbQ,1,0,5,nycXE1ivjaQCECMjYTZuOw

5401112,2018-06-19,1,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"The first time I came here, it was ironically last year during restaurant week. I remember that they did not know about it initially until they asked someone in the kitchen and then brought the menus out. They were not well organized but they made up for it with good food. They were new at current location. That is why I gave them five stars at that time.
Tonight, I was let down. To begin with, there were five people in my party and I specifically put on my open table reservation that it is for a birthday and the name of the person. I even called the restaurant personally one hour before and they confirmed that they had the information that this was for someone's birthday. 
We get there on time and we are sat at a regular table. We are given regular menus. I see that the waiter is holding smaller menus, which did turn out to be restaurant week menus, but he did not give us those until I asked for them. This is the second year, during restaurant week, where they did not offer the restaurant week menu. Then, to make things worse, our waiter is absolutely clueless! First he tells us that he believes that a filet mignon is on the restaurant week menu that can replace the flat iron steak and then he tells me that there is a dorade type of fish on the menu. Neither is right. We order our food and the food is pretty good. We get to dessert, and nothing! No candle (not important), no decoration (not important), no happy birthday (important). Her dessert was as plain as ours. 
Several times we had to signal the waiter to come over to fill water glasses as they were empty for quite a while. I also had to signal someone for the check. What's crazy is that the restaurant was not full... In fact it was less than half full!
The food at this restaurant is delicious, but the service has a great deal left to be desired. I hope a manager reads this and takes this seriously because I have come to this restaurant over eight times in the last year and usually the service is OK or below par, and it has never been outstanding. I chose to come here instead of going to an incredible restaurant on the strip for convenience because we only live five minutes from this restaurant. I was really let down tonight and my friend's birthday was non existent! This restaurant needs to be careful because it may have great food but it needs to keep up good service.

This place knows how to serve up delicious French fare and you don't have to break the bank enjoying it! We enjoyed the escargot for our starter.  The garlic herb butter was absolutely to die for and is perfect for dipping your crusty and warm baguette. For our entrees we had the Braised Lamb Shank and Orzo and Burger with Truffle mayonnaise.

5498943,2017-03-06,2,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"We were big fans of Andre Rochat's namesake restaurant at the Monte Carlo, so it was bittersweet when we heard of its closing. But the opening of Andre's Bistro & Bar in the far southwest corner of the valley is much more than a consolation prize - it's pure Parisian bistro fare in a contemporary setting, with neighborhood prices. It blew our minds how inexpensive the entire brunch menu was, with nearly everything under $20 and most entrees in the $10-12 range.

We started with an order of three beignets, served hot and pillowy with a dusting of powdered sugar. With a crusty exterior and an almost crueller-like interior, they were a perfect way to start the meal.

We then moved on to the pastry basket, which included a croissant, chocolate croissant, almond danish, raspberry (?) danish, and something called ""Mr. Sunny Side,"" which was a pastry with custard and apricots arranged to look like an egg.

Choosing a main was a difficult decision (thankfully the prices and location mean we'll be back early and often!) but I went with the smoked sausage, gruyère, and caramelized onion omelet, and it was perfect, all of the elements complimenting one another in one big eggy umami bomb. I did swap out my breakfast potatoes for frites (I mean, it's a bistro) and they were exactly what I was hoping for, crisp and flavorful.

Other entrées ordered at the table included a sausage platter, served with a warm potato salad, and a smoked salmon benedict. I didn't try either of them but my dining companions looked pleased with their orders.

Amid a flurry of great new restaurant openings in the Southwest, Andre's Bistro and Bar is poised to become a neighborhood institution.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,2,5,rGSoBHUGIrjCWAo9hLNjjA

Andre's move from Monte Carlo to southwest Vegas may be a loss for tourists, but a huge win for locals.    I loved the fasual (fancy/casual) setting as well.  

Finding it difficult to commit to any appetizer, since they all looked so damn good, we chose 3 (Sorry, escargot.  Next time!).  The Lyonnaise Salad was a great start.  Busting the poached egg all over the frisee and smoked lardons provided us with our own little private #yolkporn show.  Savoring those final fork stabs of cured pork fat had me yearning for another order as soon we met the face of the plate.  

Seared Foie Gras: Baybeee, this is what I came for!  So enamored was I with this dish at the Strip location; this was an absolute must-order.   $10 less and a bit smaller in portion still delivered the mouth orgasm I sought.  The apple strudel accompaniment was new to me and took things up a notch (my belt included).

Not accounting for how fantastic the two complimentary warm baguettes with butter would be, there were concerns about not making the finish line, which was the Grand Marnier soufflé that had to pre-ordered, so we split the special of the night.  Their Coq Au Vin was rich and satisfying; filled with chicken, mushrooms, and lardons (yes, more!), it was a wonderful segue to dessert.

I was never really sure who my server was as my order was taken by the hostess (who seemed to be the one bright spot on the staff).  I ordered a ribeye and spinach and a glass of wine.  When my steak came it was not even warm (I ordered it Med rare) so I sent it back.  It came back to me in about 5 minutes and it really wasn't any warmer so they offered to make me a new one and the chef was bringing it out himself.  This one was warm, but it was the oddest looking ribeye that I have ever seen - it had a really odd shape and looked like someone took a bite out of the center.  However, the steak had very little, if any, seasoning and was the toughest ribeye I have ever had - tougher than a strip steak and it really didn't taste very good.  Maybe order the next grade up of steak from Sysco or at the local grocery store where this meat must have come from (sarcasm).  I should mention that the spinach was good - very simple, but good.  They did end up comping my steak (charging me just for the wine), but I would have rather had a good steak.

Easy to find and close to home. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly when we arrived. The hostess did ask us if we had a reservation and I could see why. The place was almost full and I was glad there was just two of us. Our server Bailey was really what made our experience a 5 Star! She was full of personality and then I found out she hails from Michigan which is where my hubby is from, so we hit it off. She was helpful with our selections. I would love to have her again as my server next time I eat here.

It happened to be National Waffle Day yesterday for those that were unaware, but I just wasn't in the Waffle mood. There were some awesome looking Waffle dishes listed on the menu to try though.

I selected the Quiche Lorraine and my friend decided on the Lobster roll sandwich. Our food arrived timely and everything was really tasty. The Lobster roll did not lack Lobster and we shared both plates so we had a chance to enjoy both entrees. The Quiche was hot and cooked just right with a spicy finish. I had a yummy mimosa and my friend had a pricey glass of Chardonnay which she really enjoyed. We decided to close out the meal with an order of beignets. Oh my! Just so melt in the mouthy were these lil gems! Thank goodness there were only three as we could have ate more.

We sat inside since there was no room outside so I would recommend making a reservation if you really want to sit outside. The great weather heading our way is a good reason to sit outside. The interior is beautifully decorated with a mixture of industrial, modern and old world. It has a very charming feel and the space is not too big. The bar area is small but cozy.

5724830,2017-04-02,0,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"I went here today with 2 friends and our children. 

Service - 1 star
It took almost 30 minutes before we were able to order and our food didn't arrive until over an hour after we arrived. No one stopped to see how we were doing. Even though we did ask if the kids foot could come out early, and were told it would, we got all of our food at the same time and at this point the kids were starving

Beignets - 5 stars
These were delicious. Hot, sweet and amazing.  If everything else hadn't t been so horrible I would be back for these. 

Kids mac and cheese - 1 star for kids, 3 stars for an adult
This is not a kids mac and cheese.  It may be on the kids menu but it's not for kids.  Bread crumbs on top and made with a strong flavored cheese.  The cheese to noodle ratio was also way off with the noodles swimming in cheese and the noodles were way over cooked to mush. Neither of the kids that ordered it ate it which was lucky for me (see below). 

Kids chicken fingers - 2 stars for kids, 4 for adults
Also and adult dish hiding on the kids menu.  My son loved the fries. The chicken fingers had some sort of spice in the breading.  I thought they were delicious but none of the kids would eat them. Also, this plate came out scalding hot. The waiter carried it out with a napkin and warned us how hot the plate was.  When I pointed out it was for a one year old and we would like a cool plate the set it down anyway and said it wasn't that hot. When I touched it I almost burned myself.  Considering toddlers reach out and grab everything I'm lucky we didn't walk away with blisters.  Despite the temperature of the plate, the food was ice cold. Lucky for me, my some likes cold food so he still ate the fries. 

Brioche French Toast - 1 star
I ate one bite of the French toast which was both greasy and cold.  I'm not sure how you make French toast greasy.  The waiter asked how the food was after I had the first bite and I mentioned it was cold. He took it back and after everyone else was half done with their meals, he brought back the same plate which was now lukewarm and rubbery.  It had clearly been stuck in a microwave.  

Ceaser salads - 1 star
Neither person that ordered one had more than 2 bites. 

My friends did get the quiche and French onion soup and said both were good.  

I ended up eating cold chicken fingers and mushy noodles swimming in cheese.  No one in the restaurant seemed to notice that the vast majority of food that we ordered went uneaten. Needless to say we won't be back.",1-W-07IsItPX792g7cVfKQ,1,0,1,TWlQdsWt1dnSyVr7P8V-gQ

I'm going to try this again soon, but only because the food critics can't all be wrong! However, I won't take a large group here again until I've had a good experience - all but one person in the group I took was disappointed and frankly, surprised at the poor execution.

Absolutely everything was wrong when I took a group of 8 here. One of our group was a chef, so I was particularly embarrassed I'd planned this dinner out.

The food was decent, but the numerous mistakes on nearly every order combined with the server errors in judgment and tactics made for an unpleasant experience. Just a small sampling of numerous mistakes made: several people got the wrong dish - when one came out wrong a second time, the server stated the first dish was still in the back and he could go get it again! I ordered mussels, and had to ask for a bowl for shells, then use the spoon they brought me instead of a fork. We had to keep picking up our plates and handing them to the server so he'd take them away. A medium rare steak was medium well. 

And what is with the space on the side that looks like a soup kitchen? We all loved the dining and bar area, but couldn't figure out what the other room was about.",eJZZWZ1eMXyjXkz4X2stPw,0,0,2,psK0KzzL_vJpPpKDIGKSDQ

Truly happy with this cozy little gem in my neighborhood with a fun French fare.  The room is warm and comfortable, beautiful wine list, delicious food, and extremely knowledgeable waitstaff.  Ask for Mike W. as he is kind, attentive, and well educated in food and wine!  We had a romantic date pairing wines with our 3 course meal all delivered in a timely fashion allowing us to talk and relax.

5902768,2017-04-10,2,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"Really great French place for date night. Review as follows ~~

Service: 5/5
Our server Nicholas was amazing. Super friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and gave amazing recommendations for sauces, wine pairings, and dessert! Water cups never reached half empty, and they were super accommodating when I didn't like the cocktail I ordered. I can't over state how amazing the service is here. 

Food: 4/5
Roasted Vegetable Terrain: 3.5/5
Personally, not my cup of tea. My boyfriend loved it, but I was pretty indifferent to it. I do like that they use quality ingredients, and the flavors complement the veggies rather than mask the taste. I didn't like the gelatinous texture, and I personally prefer richer foods. Recommend if you want something light and fresh. 

Gnocchi with pea purée: 4/5
I thought the gnocchi was a liiil' dense, but I really enjoyed the pea purée and the flavors. Really yummy vegetarian option ~

Ribeye steak with green peppercorn sauce: 4/5
The steak was overcooked. My boyfriend asked for medium rare, and it came out medium well. What really saved the meal for him was the green peppercorn sauce our server recommended. He said it was so good he could've eaten it as a soup. Separately, the steak was a 3/5 and the sauce was a 5/5. 

Mashed potatoes: 3.5/5
Mashed potatoes are always good, but they weren't anything special.

Chocolate and Vanilla Soufflé: 4/5
When our meal came out, our server gave us a heads up that the soufflé takes 20 minutes to make so we ordered before we ate. Five minutes after finishing, the soufflé came out. It was fantastically fluffy and rich, with a good rise. Plus, both flavors and sauces were amazing. 

Chocolate Pot de Créme with Vanilla Ice Cream: 4.5/5
Basically described to me as ""chocolate pudding on steroids."" Super rich dark chocolate pudding, topped with whipped cream and a sugar madeline cookie. Definitely recommend getting the vanilla ice cream to balance out the bitterness and the richness of the dark chocolate.  

Pricing: 4/5
I thought the prices were super reasonable. For one appetizer, two entrees, one side, two desserts, and two drinks, it came out to $120 before tip. The ingredients are quality, the taste is good, but I think the real steal here is the service.

Overall: 4/5
Overall, I totally recommend this place. Great place if you're craving French food, or you're looking for a cute place for date night ~",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,4,2,4,LfI2lYQxjEurlpv3uE7oog

I stop in on the weekends for breakfast, they make an amazing quiche Lorraine. I also enjoy the steak salad, which I have had a hard time finding a nice steak salad in Vegas other than Javier's.",MmeVq6bWhogNpVPuEemrBA,1,0,5,y3UA6ucDHyU2SgF9Fs7lKA

5913556,2017-07-17,2,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"We arrived right on time for our 6:00 reservation and were quickly seated. Water and bread arrived while we looked over the menu. I think we got different bread than Sheila G did because it was just okay. And then we waited and waited with no one coming over. We finally flagged someone down and asked if anyone was working our table. He said ""I can take your order"". Ok then. 

We started off with some french wine and the french onion soup. For the entrees we ordered the trout almandine and the Ribeye steak. They ask you to order the souffle in advance which we did. A short time later another server came over and apologized telling us she had no idea she had our table. It is a pretty small restaurant with only a couple servers but I let it go as an honest mistake. 

Being at a french bistro with a french chef we had high hopes for the onion soup. Unfortunately it was a let down. Where's all the cheese?? It was baked on the outside of the bowl instead of inside with the onions and broth. There was some on the bread as well but I like a lot of cheese IN the soup. The entrees came out and the trout was presented very nicely with potatoes and green beans. I do agree with Sheila G that it just needed some more flavor. It was good, but not great. The green beans were cooked perfectly crisp. The ribeye was also good, cooked as ordered and tender. 

Finally the souffle came out and looked amazing. Surprisingly, even with the chocolate sauce I thought it wasn't sweet enough. The actual souffle was lacking chocolate flavor, but it was cooked perfectly. 

Andre's was a strong 3 stars for me, but I wouldn't be in any rush to return. Nothing stood out as amazing or outstanding. It was also very warm inside which I don't like when I am eating.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,3,2,3,UGlNUf96RFMRsd2vGZX33g
5982619,2017-03-19,0,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"Poor and inattentive service!! Went for Sunday brunch and informed the waiter it was my first time there. First, he didn't even mention kids menu options when I ordered a full priced entree that I said was for my kids. He also seemed aloof and not mentally present in the sense he would walk around and totally walk right by me when I was trying to get his attention. The food was overpriced and mediocre. Ex. 22 bucks for some oveecooked mussels and fries. Shame.",m8LtB4wEarC2_RiXlkJIFA,0,0,2,rJUErwWGIJ__Hj6icLdMBg
5996357,2017-05-11,0,jaSowNITPRRCYpPb3_pjdA,"Came here one night for dinner with a group of friends because of friends just bought a new home near by and the ratings on yelp were great. This place used to be DW bistro so when we went inside and looked around it still looked similar but the dinner settings were very dim. There were candles lit on our table and we used them to look at the menu. The service was okay not super amazing. Everything we wanted off the menu our server said was not available so I stuck with the chicken which was mediocre to say the least. I was pretty disappointed a lot of the foods that were posted on yelp that we wanted were unavailable and the server kept telling us that unfortunately since they opened not too long before we came they've revamped the menu a bit so some foods they will no longer serve. Our table ordered the moules frites which was a pretty hefty portion and okay. Also,
Escargot was something everyone tried at the table. That was good. I'd like to maybe give this place another try during happy hour or lunch to see if things may be different.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,3,1eyUh0MPz4V8FbLbvv6QTw
