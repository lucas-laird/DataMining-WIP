I have been stuck behind a person that ordered for 15 people (and did not place their order beforehand) and was very frustrated when they did not suggest that I order my one little salad before the other person.

She liked that they had brown rice and agreed that she would get no lettuce next time (I don't like lettuce on mine - I just think it takes away from the bowl).

I'm not particularly clear on the difference between the salads and the bowls, given that neither has too much lettuce, but either one is way healthier than their burritos- though to be fair, I've never tried their tacos.

Staff here mostly seems to be college students themselves, as are most of their customers- not a bad thing, just an observation. Bummed that this location doesn't have margaritas the way some others do, but that probably again goes back to their primary customer base being at a college.

Got a salad today for my dinner: brown rice, black beans, chicken and fajita veggies, with pico and corn salsas. Hefty portion for a not-so-hefty price: total was under $7, not bad at all.

I get that I'm putting cold items (salsa, corn, lettuce) on what I had thought was hot items (rice, chicken) and I understand that a *little* cooling will occur when you mix them - but really... the rice and chicken on their own weren't even lukewarm. I was too tired/hungry when eating and just left each time - wondering if my mom-brain had tricked me into thinking the meal should be hot. 

But seriously, the rice, beans and chicken should be hot. Right? Tell me I'm not crazy.

I was a little leery to eat here after reading the reviews for this location, but I was hungry and I love mexican grill type places (Rubio's and Cafe Rio are my favies).

Gosh these things are huge, but yumyumyum!!  I also got chips and guacamole.  The guac rocks!!  Well, I finished almost all of my food and walked my happy yet distended belly back to school.

I dont know if I went in on a day where the girl making burritos (I have no idea her name bc she had no name tag) was having a horrible day, or if she was just trying to hurry and leave. I went in at 920 after Beatles Love and ordered my normal chicken burrito. There was 1 scoop of brown rice and 3 people, she asked what type of rice and I replied white, she then turned and rolled her eyes sooo hard I thought they were gonna get stuck. I advised her I'm fine with brown and she carried on, the chicken was wayy too charred and she put like a freakin cup full of hot salsa on my chicken. I then asked for cheese, sour cream, and gauc. She had about a sprinkles worth of cheese left, no sour cream and 1 spoon full of gauc, again there was 3 patrons waiting. She then replies, we have no sour cream, its 930 already... OK YOU CLOSE AT 10 AND I SHOW HER IT WAS ONLY 920 AND YOU HAVE NO SOUR CREAM!? She then gives me 1/4 of a scoop of gauc and proceeds to roll my burrito. I was pretty annoyed bc why am I gonna pay for something that doesnt include everything I want. She then asks the patrons behind me if they were alright not having sour cream, they also have the look of disappointment like myself,  At this point the cashier chimes in and says ""I can make some real quick""

OK, its at this point my pina colada has kicked in 100% and I say ""are you serious? I asked for some and you did not offer me any, yet you offer these folks some?"" She rolls her eyes and pays me no mind. Throughout this visit I have been patient and just went with the flow, but no way in hell are you gonna piss on me. I tell the cashier that the ladies attitude needs to be brought up to the manager and she turns and says ""I did not give you an attitude (with an attitude btw)"" and Im shocked! She says this in front of other patrons and workers! I told the cashier my comment quietly, but she went and put me on blast!

5285672,2017-09-26,0,gWlasTc2Af0VV24mCR1tWg,"Chipotle is such a fast, easy, and healthy option for lunch or dinner. In the past there was a point I was eating Chipotle at least once a week. This location was not busy around 1pm and I was able to get my food within about 2 minutes of getting there. I get the veggie bowl which is so delicious. I think the bowls are the best thing at Chipotle, but they also have other options such as quesadillas, burritos, and tacos. They also recently came out with queso which I have been meaning to try, but it would have just been too much food for me by myself at lunch. The people working were fast and very friendly. My only complaint is that I always put the Chipotle Tobasco on my veggie bowls and there was only one bottle that was left without a lid and had dried sauce on the bottle. This could've just been the person before me and the employees didn't have time to see it or clean it, but I still think that Chipotle should leave out more than one bottle. This location also has a good amount of space, so there was plenty of seating. Overall 4/5.",ShmDxFOPf2IhLbY54-OVNA,0,0,4,MuA5iYwwxknULEGJJ-Ua9g
5343179,2014-08-18,1,gWlasTc2Af0VV24mCR1tWg,"The staff here were not very courteous compared to most Chipotles. It may be because they are located right next to the community college and students ambush them daily? I'm not sure. Although it was very empty inside the establishment, the servers rushed us through the line and never greeted us upon entry or exit.",ROXy7nX-Z1S11btsuQRl8g,1,0,2,1IgSZJ-4qLfuWjDqiF_f3A

With all that being said, this Chipotle recently opened within walking distance from my work.  Naturally I offered to pay a co-worker to go pick some up because heaven forbid I get some exercise.   I was happy to see this location offers online ordering so that I didnt have to even use my vocal chords in order to get food to my mouth.  2012!   I ordered a Burrito Bowl with Barbacoa, opted for Brown Rice (which I dont believe is available at all chipotle locations, so bonus), black beans, both medium salsas, and guacamole.  The online system said it'd be ready in about 30 minutes.   40 minutes later I was presented my food and on my first bite I noticed it wasn't very hot and the guacamole had lost some of his texture due from being with the rest of the food for what seemed like a while .   This is one of my pet peeves with online ordering in that I THINK some use a default timing system of when the food will be ready, but the employees might just start making it immediately.   So if they tell you 30 minutes, your food often sits out getting cold for 10-15.   Temperature issues aside, the food tasted about what I expect from Chipotle.  The baracoa was spiced nicely and the salsas and rice tasted fresh.  I also ordered a bottled water and was displeased to see a bottle of Arrowhead when it was delivered.  As you all probably know, Arrowhead is disgusting.  Next time I will order a Nantucket Nectar instead, or have them just pour their pinto bean juice in a jar as that'd be more refreshing than Arrowhead.

So on one visit, nothing to really set it apart from any other Chipotle experience I've ever had, and I'm sure I'll be going there often if I'm ever in a time crunch for lunch.

Now if only we could get a Zabas near here...",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,2,3,W9SGMSxxAIMJiFJNAXTW-w

5516462,2013-11-17,1,gWlasTc2Af0VV24mCR1tWg,"The food itself is no different from the other places but health was my concern. I came one night and the woman taking orders kept kicking at something on the floor. After a couple of minutes she pulled out a printed slip of paper, presumably containing an order. It was dirty, wet and had shoe prints on it. She placed it directly on the counter where the food goes, and that nasty ticket slid down the counter as the orders were made. 

I called the store to express my concern with the manager. The woman who answered changed her name when I asked to speak to the manager, and said SHE was the manager (same person- didn't even put me on hold) and when I described what happened, she didn't seem concerned. When I told her it was a hygiene issue,  she asked if I was calling for ""free food for the inconvenience"".  Needless to say, I won't be going back to this particular store.  

To be fair, this is the first time I've seen poor food safety procedures at a Chipotle. Hopefully this is isolated to that location.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,4,1,2,JUS3NXyQMZZqxsi1xI91qA

I appreciate the direction of using local produce and organic foods. I feel this mission sends a positive message for my children socially, economically and nutritionally.
The dining environment was shiny and clean. The social environment was friendly and relaxed. A nice hum of cool jazz, blues or the like played in the background. 
Happy appetites. Happy bodies. Happy minds.
Feeling satisfied.

I wish Chipotle had drive thrus. Tropical Smoothie has one, how about you?

Note: Restaurant manager. Inform your commercial property owner to be on top of cleaning up the landscaping and building area outside. It's littered with cigarette butts and trash.",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,0,1,5,wp0HvYhSeIvXwiuOr4b_eQ

After a thorough check, the employee indicated that every single food choice they offer has garlic powder in it.  This is a lazy way to cook and will result in all of the food tasting basically the same (garlic is such a potent flavor that it overpowers all the others).  Chipotle needs to widen their horizons and start using some variable spices (there are hundreds more to choose from).

I work across the street so I fancy this place often because I love Mexican flavors.  The major issue I have is the consistency in portions.  I get it, it's not a buffett, but I'm also paying $8 for a bowl.  Sometimes I can get a nice scoop of chicken or barbacoa and others it's like they're trying feed a toddler.  This place needs to work on their consistency for sure.

First they were out of chicken so I had to wait for them to finish cooking some.  That was fine by me as I figured it would be nice and fresh.  Once some was cut up the girl took a tiny plastic cup, filled it partially up and put it on my bowl.  I almost couldn't see any chicken.  I didn't complain.  Then when I paid the guy behind me voiced to the girl that she gave him almost no chicken.  So I then voiced to both ladies working that I couldn't agree more with him and that they gave me almost no chicken.  I get 3x the meat at any other Chipotle.  They just insisted they gave us 4oz and didn't offer any kind of customer care solution.  They act like a little chicken is worth it's weight in gold.  No problem...I just won't go back.",Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,0,0,1,AyQu32TtaXk4WF2vtxenhg
