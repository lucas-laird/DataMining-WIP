82175,2017-11-07,0,E7WzNqwMMifJkPZtuKOgRg,My son and I had breakfast 3 weeks ago and it was wonderful.  I had the pancakes and he had the huervo M?   We were very pleased with our meals.   My granddaughter and daughter -in-laws took me there this a.m.(at my request) for my birthday.  Two of us had pancakes and they were horrible--tough-burnt and no flavor.  We did get a credit back for one pancake meal.  Explanation:  Newl Chef!   Will not refer my Sun City neighbors to you again,acj-5GdcVlgsxSae-XOHDg,0,0,1,9a2asAfFGMQr2owx8XR08Q
121412,2017-07-23,0,E7WzNqwMMifJkPZtuKOgRg,"I walked up to Eat in the Village Center Shopping area for my second visit with a Sunday newspaper and my Starbucks latte in hand and the hostess barred my entry pointing to a sign on the window ""no outside food & drink"". Having lived in Las Vegas for 40 years and Summerlin for 10 years I have never had a problem bringing in a Starbucks coffee. She suggested I finnish it outside before coming in and after some discussion I agreed to not drink it until I had finished my breakfast and left. She stated this was required by the health department as something from outside that made someone sick they would be liable for. Why management would not want to welcome and attract customers from an anchor store like Starbucks in the same shopping center is beyond me? The restaurant has a lot of windows with nice lighting, the servers are very pleasant, the food is healthy (therefore no hashbrowns available), my only other complaint is the fast beat, moderately loud rock music they play which I find somewhat abrasive & counterproductive to a relaxed sunday morning breakfast.",CZTFg94ONs0oahzxGkcK3g,1,0,3,n5KjzLJDjkYDx23deqz1hg

My mother ordered the truffled egg sandwich and said it was delicious. I ordered the rueben, I'm a lover of the rueben and can say I know my stuff when it comes to that sandwich. First off the bread was excellent, and there was a good ratio of kraut to meat. The thousand island/russian dressing  was good, nothing crazy. All around a good sandwich with no complaints. For dessert we had cinnamon bisquits with berry compote, mix between strawberry, blackberry and blueberry. The bisquits were awesome, not dry but were moist and flakey, the compote was very tasty, not overly sweet.

1513651,2017-09-16,0,E7WzNqwMMifJkPZtuKOgRg,"The only reason I give them 2 stars is for the nice decor/ambiance and really nice staff.
The food? Read the ""inspirational"" message they put on the wall above the kitchen. Maybe it should be displayed to the kitchen staff and chef, rather than to the diners.
The food was terrible. We've eaten at their downtown location several times and it's much better!
Ordered the eggs benedict and found them to be a strange concoction with chewy bread, giant roasted tomato slice which took over all flavors, a thin slice of weird chewy and dry chicken breast replacing the traditional Canadian Bacon, saut√©ed spinach that was just ""OK"" and a very sour hollandaise. I could tell they make it in house, which is nice, but there was way too much lemon in it. Made the whole dish sour. My eggs were overcooked, but staff was nice enough to quickly bring me 2 new eggs cooked the right way. 
The roasted potatoes they throw on every dish were such a ""great success"" that all of us left them untouched on our plates. sad.
The grilled cheese sandwich was so greasy it was inedible. The cheap cheddar cheese they use inside - shameful. My daughter ate barely half of that sandwich before putting it down and saying she's nauseous and feels like she's going to throw up. The tomato soup that came with it, tasted more like something out of a can, with some pieces of bad mozzarella in it, which simply turned into rubber from the heat of the soup.
The Devilled eggs are breaded and fried, which I guess is another one of the chef's attempts at being ""clever"", but it only served to make the dish greasy and heavy. The flavor of the filling was very bland, and the only thing giving it some flavor were the Sriracha sauce and Bacon they sprinkle on top. The egg itself was completely lost in this composition.
The only thing they managed to get right is 2 sunny side up eggs and 2 strips of bacon that were cooked right, but then they also came with terrible potatoes and 2 pieces of burnt toast, so no, they couldn't even get a single dish out of that kitchen without terrible flaws.

Generally, someone should tell the chef that ""more"" is not always better. Overcomplicating and throwing everything but the kitchen sink into eggs benedict, doesn't improve on the traditional recipe!

with tax and tip we paid $104 for a 4 people breakfast that left us all a bit queasy. 
Again, the place is very nicely designed, and the staff was absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, that's not enough to make up for the really bad and very overpriced food.
$12 for 2 sunny side up eggs and 2 strips of bacon, with some really bad potatoes and a burnt toast, is too much. I can get better than that at Denny's for less than half the price and they serve better potatoes and won't burn your toast!

Make kitchen staff and chef read and memorize that inspirational message you plastered all over your wall for all diners to see. They need it more than the customers do.",x_eztqDB2mvZ5uTP5v3NUA,0,0,2,PPl_PMd7vlslNnNEb0F8lw
1525025,2017-07-20,0,E7WzNqwMMifJkPZtuKOgRg,"Content with the high reviews and excited to try something new that is conveniently a short drive from our home. 

The host gave a warm welcome - we needed a table for 4, 3 adults one child - although my niece was coming from the opposite side of town, we were going to get stared to get some food in my two year old. Unfortunately, we needed to wait for her to arrive in order to be seated.. the restaurant wasn't full; in fact the other back half of the restaurant was empty and several tables were open in the front section of the restaurant. I would understand if the restaurant was packed and/or if we were a larger party, but regardless if she was to arrive or not - we would still need a four top table. Thankfully the weather was nice out so we waited outside until then. 

We promptly ordered some starters and then entrees for each of us. We had to ask twice for a paper cup for the apple juice we order for my daughter. Which is fine, sometimes people forget. No biggie. Although we also had to ask for creams for our coffee three times as well.. the third time was with the closet person around, Our host as we already gotten our entrees and still haven't touched our coffee. 

The timing on the food coming out was great. 
Cinnamon Biscuits - It's true, this is a wonderful dish. I really appreciated the fresh fruit.

Fried Deviled eggs - I really wanted to like this, unfortunately all of us didn't even bother to look up at each other to even acknowledge the dish. 

Truffled egg sandwich - Lacks that ""wow"" factor. Wasn't that impressive for the cost for a breakfast sandwich and the side of tomato salad was too strong. 

Grilled Cheese Sandwich - Best entree out of the three we ordered, as agreed amongst the table. The tomato soup was tasty and I dig the thick cut bread. 

Chicken Pesto - My niece took one bite out of it and I took the rest home as I didn't want it to go to waste. I wasn't very hungry after the grilled cheese I had. 

All three sandwiches were heavy/greasy. I'm sure the concept of the menu is great but the execution wasn't there. 
On top of everything else, we never saw our server after she took our order. The host and the busser actually took more care of us, even checked on us to see how our food was. There was a large party she was taking care of at some point, which explained her absence in the beginning, but their orders were put well before we were even remotely done with our entrees. 

I'd like to think sometimes servers are just having an off day. Since I work in the restaurant industry, I'll make excuses up for them to give them benefit of the doubt. Taking into consideration the flow of the restaurant, etc. We came in after the breakfast rush and before the lunch rush. I will definitely come back in for a second try with the service and as an excuse for those biscuits, in fact I'm craving for them right now.",JvEQ4grbxY3vpW9_LxvnjA,2,0,3,BiskW7t4DOUKFuSQBq4UOw

Walking up we noticed there was a lot of people dinning which is a great sign because i believe the last establishment did not have very many people who went there. I think because many ppl are familiar with their downtown location. The Location is kind of hidden in a shopping plaza by the Trails community but saves a drive going all the way downtown.

The restaurant itself is situated in a strip mall, so parking is pretty easy  convenient. The decor had a cool, casual hipster vibe to it and service was friendly. 

We started our meal with the cinnamon biscuits and deviled eggs. The biscuits were served with strawberry compote and fresh berries. I like that it wasn't overly sweet. The deviled eggs were very tasty, probably because it was partially deep fried. Then we ordered the shrimp and grits and the chilaquiles. The shrimp and grits were flavorful and had a good balance of flavors (also no substitutions for the grits), and came with bacon, over easy eggs, and pico de gallo. The chilaquiles was also very flavorful and I liked the different textures the dish provided.

By the time we had the creamer, the coffee was already cold and the entrees were out. The boyfriend's Shrimp and Grits had great flavor, but my truffled egg sandwich was pretty bland.

Heard could be a long wait, but arrived a little after 11:00 am to a ""ready to seat two"" availability. Husband was not eager at first for the food options, basic omelette kinda guy, has a comfort zone, but I offered that he could always eat at the other spots, to try something new. He relented. Ordered the Truffle Egg Sandwich, he had the BLT with a side of potato salad. Service was primo, everyone worked the room which is refreshing to see. Food arrived and presentation was photo perfect. I immediately had to sample my husband's potato salad because honestly, my mother makes the best in the world. BUT.....OMGosh......this was amazing. Fresh and flavorful. Not heavy with mayo as is with many others. My sandwich was delicious and the truffles added a zest to the eggs. I did jazz mine up a bit with some hot sauce and it seemed to accentuate perfectly the flavors of the bacon, egg and truffles. The side of potatoes and onions was a perfect compliment. 

I found that this place is unique in that it has a very bistro feel, with earthy, wholesome, organically flavored cuisine. For the first time since I can remember I did not immediately feel tired post the plenty of potatoes served. I wondered if because they were not ladled with heavy grease and artery clogging substances as other breakfast foods. It is amazing when food is fresh and prepared as this is, how much better you feel AFTER you eat!!!! 

The staff was attentive, responsive, and kind. Our server offered the perfect suggestion when as I was ordering the Truffle Egg Sandwich she offered ""with avocado"", I hesitated, wondering, should I or shouldn't I? Her offer, ""either way you will not be disappointed by it"". SOLD, no avocado. She was right. It was delicious absent avocado.  

I understand ""alcohol"" is in the works for here. The only item missing was some Champagne to sip with the fresh yummy ingredients offered by this most delightful eatery, Eat. 

We will return, with family and I will share my excitement for this fresh, new spot for our breakfast and lunch options in Summerlin. My husband, the one who sort of needed more convincing to try, is a ""thumbs up"", fan now. He was not disappointed. It reminded me of a large, happy home with a very big family style kitchen where sounds of laughter, clanking dishes, flavorful smells and favorite foods are being served.

I ordered the country fried steak and it was so tough that not even a steak knife could get through it. When I finally managed to cut a piece it took about 2 minutes just to chew that piece because of the toughness of it. I decided to take a break from eating the steak and have a bite of my toast to only find a hair on top of it. I addressed it the server and she said she would address it with the manager. It was never brought back to our attention nor were there any accommodations made for the mistake. Still charged us full price and didn't bother to make any of it right. To top everything off we were shorted our change by almost $15, I guess attention to detail is not a priority on the list here.

Arrived for breakfast shortly after 9 AM and the restaurant was very busy. We submitted our name and waited about 5 minutes for a table. Once seated service was prompt. The kitchen was slammed but the wait time for the food was acceptable. With a full house it was a little on the loud side, border line conversation friendly.
 
We ordered the Huevos Motulenus. Two eggs over easy, with red and green New Mexico Chiles, black beans, peas and pico on corn tortilla. This was a very tasty dish. The eggs were cooked to my satisfaction. A little heat from the red chili and the addition of peas was a welcome addition. The dish is served with Chive Potatoes which were crisp on the outside and soft inside. Soaking up the potatoes in the sauce was enjoyable.

The menu offers Pancakes in three sizes, full, short stack and one pancake. On this day the one pancake and a side order of Chive Potatoes was the right amount for breakfast. The pancake was fluffy and moist.

No dinner just egg and sandwiches galore. Prices are around $10-15 for the most part but the sizes are generous so could bring some home for sure. 

I had one of the best BLTs here. Thick toasted bread and some fantastic bacon. The avocado was good but might have been to slimy, making the sandwich fall apart. The large sandwich came with a side which I like as many places now a days are a la carte only. I had the tomato soup which was nothing spectacular but nonetheless perfect for dipping the great bread. 

Service knocked my review down. We had 4 separate waiters before ordering. 1 have us specials, 1 took drink orders, 1 took food orders, and 1 was going to take food orders then just disappeared. Getting seated our table was for 4 when we had 5 so we had to squeeze in. At the end, we sat on a check with a credit card sticking out, ready for payment for literally 20 minutes.

3617402,2017-11-04,2,E7WzNqwMMifJkPZtuKOgRg,"I'm such a fan of eat's downtown location so was eager to try the new Summerlin location on this last trip.  I'm very happy to say that it's the same quality of food but with no line for a seat! ... well, on a weekday anyway, haven't tried it on a weekend which I bet is crowded.

We got here right as they opened and were the only ones in the restaurant for most of the meal.  The interior space is larger than the downtown location with some funky decor.  The service was also super friendly and welcoming.

We both got the Chicken Fried Steak and both thought it was really good, nice crispy coating with a creamy pork sausage gravy.  The one critique about the dish when compared to the same dish at the downtown location are the country potatoes, while plump with a soft interior, didn't have that slightly charred exterior and caramelized onions and garlic like the ones at the downtown restaurant has, I love those potatoes.

Another thing to talk about, the toast that came with the breakfast was worth mentioning.  The sourdough toast and the toasted whole wheat english muffin were both better than the toast you'd normally get at other places.  I don't think I've ever mentioned in a review the side of toast that comes with a meal before so that should be an indicator of how good they were.  

There are quite a few uninspired restaurants in this area so Eat is a great addition to Summerlin.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,7,6,4,At0AxHU1pC4ZpTTqWH57Ew
3622951,2018-02-20,0,E7WzNqwMMifJkPZtuKOgRg,"New location, who dis ? 

I will start by saying I'm not a huge breakfast person. Brunch I enjoy, but breakfast isn't very exciting to me. That is of course unless you're asking me to join you at Eat. Here you will find the absolute best pancakes. Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy inside... they are amazing. I recommend the pancakes to all you waffle lovers out there. 

The location is in a busy shopping center in Summerlin. I do like the vibe of the downtown location a bit better but this location is a lot closer to home. It is kid friendly however I can't say it was stroller friendly. 

Minus one star for their hostess: We have been here a few times, she both seats parties and takes orders. She is overall a bit high strung and abrupt. We never get a hello before she comes to our table and gives off a very unwelcoming and rushed demeanor. I've seen patrons shocked at her briskness. If she slowed down just a little bit she would have time to smile, say hello and wouldn't have to pick chairs up in the air and slam things down on the hostess stand while clearing tables. 

Mom Rating 4/5 
As a parent to a little one who will soon be eating table foods they do offer high chairs. I did not visit the restroom to see if they have a changing table. The atmosphere is welcoming to young children.",rTydTPQKKXoysaVPC0CLxw,0,0,4,5Ge8Z58fqtqT00hTRnJFvA

I'll divide this into 3 sections: vibe, service, and food. 

Let's Go!

Vibe:
I loved this place the second I came in. I guess you could let me fall into the hipster category sometimes. When it comes to objects I fall in love with vintage or more bluntly things that are old. This place has a lot of vintage decor which I love but it was very Instagram worthy. Some things were very aesthetically pleasing.It was very open and it had a bar area.It's very casual and comfortable.

Service:
The service was lovely. Our server came to the front right as we entered and lead us to our table. She was nice but she wasn't very talkative.

Food:
Now the cream of the crop... The food! I ordered the Truffled Egg Sandwich. Presentation was lovely but there was a lone strawberry that kinda confused me. The sandwich was good but a bit to much mushrooms even for a mushroom sandwich. It was very tasty though. My meal came with potatoes but I wished it was a bit more seasoned.

When we asked if there was Dairy in the Pancakes or the Cinnamon biscuits she said I think there's eggs.. She thinks eggs are vegan but also Dairy? Lol, Anyways she was nice and that's not that big a deal. However with a new business in an area that has 2 other Breakfast Restaurants, this place has to stand out to become the Favorite, it's got the vibe, the interior just needs to have better options then the other 2 chains have. The Turkey Bacon and Apple Chicken Sausage are a huge start. I, like others would rather support local and small businesses however those small businesses need to stand out, have what the big retailers don't, and that's customer service, and healthy, sustainable options. I'm sure the investors nor the owners will care about this as the most important for them is revenue, but caring about the product you give your customers is very important.

No refills for coffee, very poor attention to our table and they weren't even that busy.  Their management didn't even attempt to apologize.

I developed a huge appreciation for this Summerlin location the minute I pulled up and realized there was no line outside! (Hallelujah...)

I decided to go out of my comfort zone and ordered the Huevos Motulenos $14 (scrambled vs. over easy eggs) and I'm glad I did. There were so many different flavors and textures my taste buds were all over the place in a great way (red and green Mexican chiles, black beans, pico, feta and saut√©ed bananas on a corn tortilla) . The chive potato's are my favorite guilty pleasure; they are the bomb! Our server Dominic was pretty smooth upselling us on avocado for a nominal fee of one dollar per order. 
 
The Truffle Egg Sandwich $14.00 (1/5 stars) was very disappointing. The truffle oil was extremely excessive; the ciabatta bread was drenched. Truffle oil poorly executed to the point the sandwich was not enjoyable. No Bueno for such a pricy ingredient!

Of course I'll be back Chef Natalie and her establishments are overall a great addition to Las Vegas.

I had eaten the oatmeal with pecans at the downtown location, and thought it was fabulous, so I ordered it again at the Summerlin location.  Blah.  It was nothing like the oatmeal I remembered from downtown.  Tasteless, and three pecan halves and 3 strawberry halves with the green tops still on.

The warm greetings that we received upon entering were, in retrospect, the highlight of our brunch.  As a group of 6, we had come for a late lunch about 40 minutes before they closed. The menu was mostly breakfast food with the addition of three sandwiches and there was no children's menu.  While trying to find something that our son would eat, we asked if he could have a simple grilled cheese sandwich.  We were directed to the $11 adult size Sourdough grilled cheese and told that the chef refused to make children's size portion.  After getting the manager involved and pointing out that the had both white toast and cheese on the menu, we were able to twist their arm enough to get them to produce the saddest grilled cheese sandwich in existence.  After that, we were all hungry and hoping that our lunches would be worth all of the hassle.  Much to the dismay of all five adults, our entr√©es were mediocre at best.  The chicken on Cesar was dry, but on the sandwich it was soggy.  The adult Sourdough grilled cheese was decent, but not worth $11.",vSvExVQxL-mAXybatSQBvQ,0,0,1,BK4xnMxCtaLM0TUHULu-Uw

The fantastic food and service we know and appreciate from her first eat location in Downtown Las Vegas can now be had in the Summerlin area. This location is about twice the size of the first location which is even better because there's no wait time, yay!

I have my own personal favorites including Chicken Fried Steak, Chilaquiles, etc. My top favorites which I HAVE to have include...

Cinnamon Biscuits:
Cinnamony, buttery biscuits with berries, and a berry compote. These are just a delight. For those times when you just have to treat yo'self! 4/5

Deviled Eggs:
Chef Natalie's version is one of my favorites. The egg white part is battered and fried without being greasy topped with some delicious mustardy yolk with sriracha and bacon. 4/5

Truffled Egg Sandwich:
Lightly toasted sourdough bread, truffled scrambled eggs, mushrooms, and bacon with a side of potatoes with chives. You haven't really had an egg sandwich until you eat this. The bread looks like it should be hard/ crunchy but it's not. It's soft on the outside and slightly crunchy on its toasted buttery side. Lots of good flavors and textures. Not your average breakfast sandwich. 5/5

The food is delicious. 

The tomato soup is my fav on the menu along with the potato salad. 

Today I purchased a Roast Beef sandwich for my boss. The total came out to 12.07 and I gave the cashier a $20 bill. I got 6$ back in change. I tipped $1 and left it on the counter for them. I guess they decided to tip themselves because I only had $5 when I got in my car. Really?! A $15 sandwich? 

The food is good and mostly homemade, the quality is good but this place is pricey.

The chicken fried steak, which is a speciality of Natalie's, was subpar. It was cold and the breading hadn't been fried entirely. 
When the manager saw that we hadn't eaten it, he asked why and when we told him, he just said ""oh no!"" and still gave us the check for the entire meal. 
It wasn't worth arguing about, he knew it wasn't good and decided to do nothing. We just won't be back.
