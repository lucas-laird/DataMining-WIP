Nothing interesting to buy from frozen area, way too small. For Olives, don't have much choice.",Tgvrli1jAtcVvkQ2aXi20A,0,0,1,z7NAJqXeUdn7zXRvIM7Rrw
1434976,2018-01-19,0,Kdr5SklsZ2otCjdJJfJ7wQ,This store has good quality halal meat and is very conveniently located. Their prices are competitive and if they don't have something in stock you can see if they'll order it for you. Their roti selection is pretty good too. Bonus that they have great customer service. :),WG-VWppD12bO_pDRiegoiA,0,1,5,i7YsoBpcJQIGy-MlI5nadw

3620452,2018-03-07,0,Kdr5SklsZ2otCjdJJfJ7wQ,This place is a ripoff and their customer service is horrible. The meat does not look fresh at least from our experience purchasing it from them. The butcher is trying to sell old ground chicken leg meat that's been in freezer for week rather than to ground chicken leg meat that's displayed in front. If you want to get fresh Halal meat at reasonably price please go to Afandi Halal Market. Trust me you will not be disappointed. Avoid this place.,z8YU0Vt6Nq3-oJKG48IBnA,0,0,1,hwmQB0OpetGD-U-PvW9sjQ
4271717,2018-04-21,2,Kdr5SklsZ2otCjdJJfJ7wQ,"Our favorite local/import store. A huge variety of spices and canned goods and seasonings, fresh produce, every type of rice and oil, frozen goods, and our favorite is the meat department. The chicken is fresh, halal, no antibiotics or preservatives. And they carry the lamb riblettes that they know I love so much. Their lamb comes from California! Their prepared kebabs are delicious- the work is done, all you do is put it on your grill! Delicious every time. Store is clean, well organized and staff is friendly. Have a look around- there is a lot for the eye to enjoy.",HvZQ9qFkRSxRCI0tMQ6nLA,6,3,5,YFJOiSDc_AZYFwkOqYeawg

4721898,2017-01-02,0,Kdr5SklsZ2otCjdJJfJ7wQ,Great place for halal meat and Middle Eastern/Indian products. The butcher section is very clean and organized and they are accommodating to special requests. You can order a specific type or cut if they don't carry it. It's a family run business and everyone is friendly and helpful. We just moved to the area and this will be our go-to place for halal meat!,Z-Zi-W05QwM0phkIVrmLoA,0,0,5,dysJsG52w1u9HYKSUYCouA
