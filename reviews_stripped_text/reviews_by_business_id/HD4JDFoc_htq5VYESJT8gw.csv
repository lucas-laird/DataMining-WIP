There were maybe 5 other families in with me.  After 20 minutes of waiting after I ordered, I saw people who ordered AFTER me were getting their food, so I asked about the status of mine.  I was told they were almost done, and waited a little more.  When I finally got the bag of food it wasn't my food, and not even close to my order!  

So I waited in line another 5 minutes to return the wrong food.  When I finally got to the counter she questioned if I was incorrect about that being the wrong order... Then she told me my food receipt didn't print.  She wasn't apologetic but offered me a refund and said they could start making the food. 

I got a refund, but didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes for the food and I left.  It was really frustrating and disappointing waiting for 45 minutes and watching other people finish their meals when they ordered after me, and not to get any food when you were looking forward to wings.

Other than that, all their wings are made fresh and come out hot right away.

The only thing is, I wish their Garlic Parmesan was better. They really don't do justice to my favorite flavor. Their Garlic Parmesan is just regular wings with a slight taste of garlic and covered in shredded Parmesan that you could probably buy at the Wal-mart next door.

I've eaten from here on several occasions but never at this location so this was my first & last physical visit.

About the food - it's not bad. I've only had the boneless wings & a variety of the sauces which have been good. The fries & veggies are decent as well and with that said this isn't one of my regular go to's. 

Here's the reason for my one star review - 
Walking in I immediately noticed how filthy this place was. There was trash on the tables, as well as the counter. That worried me because that's always a bad sign. Next came our ordering process which wasn't the greatest as the girl at the counter was having a bad day and wasn't the friendliest. We repeated our order several times as she seemed to be having issues with the system they use. Afterwards we walked away after she told us it would be approx 15-20 minutes. This seemed odd to me because nobody takes this long. 

We sat around for about half an hour & I finally went up to inquire about our food to be told the order didn't make it into the system. She wasn't apologetic or nice about it either. She then told me everything would be out in about 5 mins. 10 mins later I went back up & asked for our money back. She was really annoyed by this & took her time doing whatever they need to do. No apology, no care in the world & after wasting about 45 mins we walked out. 
 
Everyone can have a bad day, we all do. But when you're in customer service you can't treat the people who pay your bills like crap. My wing cravings will go to Buffalo Wild Wings.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,44,36,1,OZZ0iYlkcFqKD7w5sE-2Ug

She repeats the order at the end asking ""So you want 8 Korean bbq, Louisiana rub, and lemon pepper?"" We go to pick it up and she asks for his name and she says ""We don't have an order for Kyle."" She then realizes that what's supposed to be our order is set aside so he's ready to pay only to find out she charged us for 8 wings total. He explained that he ordered a total of 24 but 8 in each flavor. Rather than admitting to her mistake or apologizing and fixing the problem, she copped an attitude and said ""Well, that's not what you said. I even repeated the order to you."" Maybe it was our mistake by not specifying that we wanted 24 total, but it was rude to automatically point the finger at us. Anyone with common sense would realize that 8 of each 3 flavors means 24 total. So he asks her how long it will be til the rest of the order is done. I ate some of the wings as we waited and my boyfriend asks her for a water cup. She says ""We ran out of water cups."" He asks,""Would you be able to give me a regular cup to drink some water while I wait?"" She says ""I can't just give you a cup and we are low on water bottles."" Then he says, ""you can't just give me a cup to drink some water while I wait for my to go order that didn't come out right?"" She then hands him the cup and says ""In the future, you can't just get a cup."" I work in the service industry and know that you should never get defensive and blame your customer.

My first impression was how loud the place was with only 6 people dining. But wasn't just the diners. The kitchen was loud too and the gal taking my order had the kitchen to her back so I had to keep having the server repeat herself because she spoke so softly and the establishment is so loud (or maybe I hit ""old"" today, or both).

We made our order to go. The wait wasn't overly long: I figured it wasn't like I was driving through Caine's fast food style so I had high hopes that these chicken wings would rock my world! 

I ordered the Hawaiian dipping sauce with my meal, partly because it was low on the hot meter and partly because it sounded like it would be awesome-sauce. 

When I arrived at home, after enduring the wonderful smell teasing my nostrils during the quick drive home, I was disappointed at the presentation of the wings: they appeared over-cooked and the container they were in made them seem small so it felt like I wasn't getting a full serving. 

Well, I dug in to eat and loved the fries (tip, if you can eat their fries fresh, they're amazing). Then I dipped into that Hawaiian sauce I mentioned. My world was rocked alright: the sauce was so hot it burned my tongue and I was shocked at the rubbery texture of the wings. After my eyes quit watering and I was able to take a second bite, this time using ranch dressing (I'll never do Hawaiian again!) I was still just as disappointed, if not more. In addition to being overcooked and rubbery, they were extremely salty. 

I definitely won't return to this Wing Stop again. Hopefully I'll have a pleasant experience at other locations. I never write off a company as a whole without first trying other locations too. 

PS I Love Caine's more now. Just sayin'.",7znuQ3Vay1oGBYvUvM6kyw,1,0,2,gmIIA6aMZhdGiZVssjb_EQ

2811907,2014-04-12,5,HD4JDFoc_htq5VYESJT8gw,"Was feeinin for some wangs and these guys just happen to be in the vicinity so off we went. I love the fact that their hours are 11 am to midnight everyday.

I usually get the 8 piece traditional meal combo that comes with fries and a drink for around 10 bucks which is a good deal to me. When I say traditional I mean bone in. I have tried the boneless and honestly it just doesnt taste any better than bone in because I think the bone gives the chicken more flavor. Kind of like ribs. If you have ever had boneless ribs you know its just not the same.

Anyways, for the 8 piece you have your choice of two flavors. I usually get the Garlic Parmesan and Lemon Pepper and sometimes the Mesquite Barbeque. This time around they had the Chile Lime wings as a limited time flavor so I got that and Garlic Parmesan.

As usual, they always tell you it takes about 18 minutes for your order to come out regardless if you are the only ones in there. I guess thats a good thing cuz that means they cook it from scratch and not heat up precooked ones! While you're waiting for your order, you can kill time by deciding what flavor drink you want from the technologically advanced Coke machine. Want Diet Coke? How bout different flavors of diet coke like vanilla, raspberry, cherry , or lime. Yes, whatever drink you pick there is different flavors for it. I think even water has different options. This soda machine should be STANDARD in every restaurant. Whoever makes that decision this should be a no brainer.

When they call you up to counter, make sure you grab a long strip of paper towel that is conveniently next to where you pick up your tray. There is also a ketchup pump machine there where you can pump some ketchup into little paper cups to dip your fries in. 

So me and the wifey dig in. With so much greasy goodness, you cant help but think of when the last time you had an appointment with your cardiologist. What is that saying? All in moderation right? Not sure if grease was included in that conversation. Speaking of grease, the fries are good with the skin on them. I wonder why they cant flavor them with the sauces as well? I have another wing joint I go to that has over 60 flavors and they can flavor their fries at your request. My favorite is sweet chili. You dont know what flavored fries are until you try them! Hit me up or just look at my wings list. You're welcome.

Wingstop and Buffalo Wild Wings are tied with 4 stars from me for they are both good. Both will always be in my rotation from time to time.

My addiction to Wing Stop began gradually.  Those succulent french fries, the spicy and flavorful buffalo sauce, the fresh baked yeast rolls.  I used to go only on big game nights, a nice finger food to bring home.  Slowly though, I the thought of 20 wings and some fries began creeping in on random mondays in class or at work.  I even have the number programmed in my phone for call ahead orders!  My parents have tried to talk to me about this.  You should cook more at home, its healthier and can save you money...blah, blah, blah.  Sometimes I feel the wings love me more.  
 
The low point came this last month when I went on a 30 wing eating binge.  My friend came over and found me in a food induced coma reeking of blue cheese and buffalo sauce having not shaved or showered in 2 days.  He was like you cant go on this way.  And then he found my secret stash in the fridge.  I knew the gig was up.  I agreed that I needed to control my urge for their amazing wings and fries.  

Who am I kidding...I cant do that.  Im in this for the long haul.  Wing Stop and I are linked indelibly.  So mom and dad, friends....put away those notes asking me to get help.  I ain't going to treatment!

Located near Krispy Creme Donuts. Known to be the place where groups come to watch the games - especially super bowl!!

Last night was the first night I ordered wings (""on my own"") from this spot. The menu wasn't difficult to understand - I wanted wings and a lot of it. Luckily my cousin had a to-go menu at his place so I looked before hand before coming (since it was 11:30pm). 

My cousin would bring the Louisiana Rub, mango habanero and Garlic Parm home and it's the three bursting with flavors that turned me addicted to the wings. 

I ordered the family pack mix and match - 24 wings (8 mango habanero - 8 Louisiana rub and 8 mild), a large fry (switched it to twisties), 3 dipping sauces and veggie sticks. 
My boyfriend and I went over board with this order and ended up having a bunch of leftovers after. 

Mango habanero - let it cool down and it won't be as spicy spicy. I couldn't handle it burning my lips so I know to stay away from the Atomic flavored wings. But it is still delicious!! 
Louisiana Rub - oh my goodness... The crunch gets me going back and back! The flavor is great! 
Garlic Parmesan (had it a few times before) - at first when I opened the box it smelled like seafood drenched in garlic sauce but once I bite into it I am reminded that it's chicken. If you don't mind seafood then you're good on this dish. 
Mild - eh. Not a fan. It was okay. L

Their meat on their wings are actually a decent amount , unlike some places that sell wings. Customer service was friendly and helpful with questions I had.

The wings here are awesome. The meat is a good quality, the sauces that they have are really good, and the fries that go with them are delicious. I love to get the classic hot wings, or if I'm not feeling spicy, I go with parmesan garlic. The parmesan garlic isn't a greasy sauce, it's more of almost a dry rub. My husband loves their spicier sauces (spicier than I can handle) and says they're pretty good. 

The fries are seasoned really well, the cajun is a nice spicy option, but the seasoning on the regular fries is what gets me. They're perfectly salty, but also has a hint of sweetness. They're best if you eat them in the restaurant, they get soggy quickly (but are heavenly when eaten fresh). 

I eat here once every few weeks, usually calling ahead for pick up. This location has yet to mess up an order, they always give accurate time estimations for pick up, I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for wings, and the service is friendly.

SERVICE
Hit or miss. Fortunately I got a very friendly server on my recent visit. Other server on the next register over looked like she was ready to murder someone. 

FOOD
I always get their boneless chicken wings. They have 6,8,10, or 12 pieces options for the combo which comes with their hand-cut fries and 21oz. drink. My 6 pieces boneless chicken wing combo came out to be $9.72 with tax included. 

They have 11 flavor options with various spice level. I don't like anything spicy so I tend to go towards the bottom of their spice scale. My favorites are their garlic parmesan and lemon pepper. 

They make the wings fresh to order so there is a wait, usually around 20-30 mins. You can order online or call them for pickup to minimize the wait time.

*It's odd that this place doesn't have a trash bin anywhere. However, employees here are constantly checking and cleaning the table so leave all your trash on the table lol

Ever since one of my die-hard-LA-Lakers-fan of an Aunt shared the ""Official Wings of the Los Angeles Lakers"" (funny enough) to my family one day - that was a set of 10 lemon pepper flavored wings - my adventurous side smirked at the idea of experimenting with a few other flavors. Thankfully, this branch is located barely 10 minutes away from where I live so when the opportunity to pick a new flavor presented itself, I went with  'Garlic Parmesan' and 'Hickory Smoked BBQ' Both of which were undeniably tasty. 

My father and I have grown to become huge fans of this place and always opt for the 20 piece wings (that comes with 2 flavor choices) He continues to stick with lemon pepper while I've branched out to Garlic Parmesan...by. a. mile. Not only does the texture make the wing so savory but the garlic really does compliment the parmesan in a way that makes the overall taste so rich, the world converges towards it. 

For $13.19 (+ tax), you can choose to get 15 or 20 pieces (I'd be insane to let an extra 5 pieces pass!) and for an additional $2, you can go for wings only (no mini legs) not that it really matters. There's a drive-thru in case you're in a hurry and the staff is very friendly, not to mention humorous (we joked about how they couldn't pronounce my name) There're seats in the restaurant - not the more spacious, I have to be honest - but other than that, this place gives you all the reason for a stop - great food and great service!

The Coca-Cola Freestyle Machine!  Wide varieties of different soft drinks all with a touch screen menu!  The best thing ever for me...Diet Vanilla Coke!!!!

Always go boneless, that's how I roll.

I LOVE their smoky bbq flavor along with their Hawaiian sauce, sometimes if I'm feeling a bit adventurous, I'll get the Louisiana Rub for a bit of a kick.  To this day though, I've yet to try their Original Hot.

The fries...man, I don't know what it is in that seasoning, but sometimes I think there's a hint of brown sugar mixed in!!!  There's definitely a bit of sweetness to them fries!

The dipping sauce...oh my God!!!! Their honey mustard is like a drug, I can't get enough of it, and their ranch....oh man, the creaminess of that stuff when you dip your fries/wings in it...-Christopher Walken voice- Wow...wowie-wow-wow!

Food poisoning is a possible solution and I would't doubt it.

I think WingStop may need to hire more staff. Maybe then their food would get cooked to the proper temperature.

They do a great job of making sure that my order is done at the estimated time, and the food is always tasty. However, the last time I ordered, I was disappointed that I only got two out of three of my ranches that I ordered with the family pack. I drown my fries and chicken in ranch, so I was sad about that. Also, I was maybe 6 minutes late picking up the food, and it wasn't kept as hot as usual. You could tell it had been sitting out of the warmer for a while. Overall, this is my favorite location and I will continue to order from here. I would just appreciate getting everything I paid for and my food still hot when I pick it up.",OnlKp0BkuthhtC6igmvPyw,0,0,4,CsdAEGVGG52646a_EZ4U7A

I called in a phone order, they said 15min; so I went in after 10 mins. They brought my food out from the BACK like it had just got done cooking.. But it was NASTY! I got the 8pc boneless, and I received 7 pcs.. As I paid for my food, I ordered an extra side of fries.. It took another 15 mins to get those fries.. FRIES!!! 15 mins!! Luckily the girls at the register were polite.. Otherwise I would have raised hell in there. I was hungry. I couldn't complain and wait ANOTHER 15-20 mins. These cooks SUCK. The ONE star is due to the cashiers ONLY. The other non existent stars are due to the crappy food.",nl2o0kovLXXU1faZ9H-xYg,0,0,1,5ekxBmuVL4UyGnFHe_4EoA

Other than that, the girl on break who jumped on the register who helped me was very nice and the food was fine like usual. They just forgot my honey mustard.",ltognjv8eo5w0kgLfuBHnw,1,0,3,Ac5tL8rrrj5ioXNDAhkEaw

Their fries are yummy and different as well, they have a delicious ranch dressing that I just want to dip like crazy. Mmmmm juicy fresh made to order wings, they never let me down, have been here multiple times and always a success!


Wingstop you rock!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,7,4,4,JrCa0znPKrAKChj8dak5Ng
5929005,2011-10-01,1,HD4JDFoc_htq5VYESJT8gw,"I have given Wing Stop a try twice so far. The first time I dined in and the second time I ordered take-out, but unfortunately, I did not enjoy the food here. 

Garlic Parmesan Wings (regular and boneless) - the taste is not too bad, but after eating two wings, I feel like I have to stop because it becomes too salty!

Smoked BBQ Wings (boneless) - the chicken was very soggy, both times.

Seasoned Fries - pretty soggy, some were not cooked very well. 

Sweet Tea - I usually love sweet tea, but this was very bland. I should have just filled up my cup with unsweetened tea!

Also, I thought it was weird that when you dine in, the ""napkins"" that they provide is a community roll of hard brown paper that you have to tear off (located next to the drink machine) Really?!?!

The only plus is that they have very friendly employees who are more than happy to explain the menu to you or make any suggestions. 

Sorry Wing Stop, I'll be going elsewhere for my chicken wing fix!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,2,0,2,6lIemRoDGOy0-z6tudHvew

I'm always interested in a discount but unfortunately this deal only applies to boneless wings, which I'm not don't really like, but a deal's a deal.

This location is good for some takeout after a long shopping session. I prefer the spicy or Hawaiian and you have to order fries, that's the best thing at Wingstop. I just wish they had more variety of flavors.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,3,3,FCCX5aPkTk65fBrhl_ixiw

The wings are never too greasy, the fries are delish especially when paired with their honey mustard sauce. The only thing is the wait. Yes I'm a bit impatient but knowing that they come up fresh does make up for it and now that I can pre-order online, even better.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,18,16,5,B-FDgBHfmWlv1Pqir5N5Bg
