My girlfriend got the chicken with mixed veggies and I got the Philly cheese steak which was really good. A great meal for around $30 and enough food for breakfast before we roll out of Vegas. We thoroughly enjoyed. Don't let the exterior of this place fool you. The food is great.",XSyxQjI2pncRJSZtUiVh-A,2,1,4,i72OA9lvBrPfqQNM7Kk_Qg

Not a place you wanna hang out unless you dont have enough money to hit the stratosphere. Place only good for hardcore gamblers. Bar is a joke and half stocked. As long as you gamble,you get one $2.00 poorly made drink for every $10 you spend,trust me they watch you like a hawk!!!. You are seriously better off just oaying the 2 bucks. Food area is a joke,i wouldnt eat that if it was the last place on earth. After seeing the bathroom which you need a key located behind the bar...you would be a fool to eat anything. Juke box is from the 60s with no updated music..eeehhh",LOjwhKd3PjmhPipOBPfYvg,0,1,1,k8A8JJCzqv84PFfCTVdM0Q

We went to use the internet cafe and after we paid we went on computers to print out airplane tickets. Then the security guard comes by and then tells us to stand back and he will get us a refund because the machine wasn't working. THen he comes back and doesn't give us the refund and tells us the leave. We short money and left without printing out tickets. 

I would rate this place 0 stars on service if I could.

Where the restaurant is located, there is a small bar and about ten slot machines. I highly suspect the majority of the females there were prostitutes. Idk if we missed the actual casino, but there is def not one here. The people at the bar seemed to enjoy the video poker.

OMG!!! very good and a heaping stack of amazing French fries. pleasantly surprised that I can have all this in Vegas for about $8.",SG0TgJ2o7a8sdmbtTUfVOQ,5,2,4,kXIfSX5r7M-OyFd2wCH20Q

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing spectacular about the place, but the prices are actually affordable, which is a rare jewel in the tourist areas of Las Vegas.  I stopped here for food twice on my trip, once for breakfast, and again for the pizza buffet, and was glad I found such an affordable place close to my hotel.  I even stopped by the Subway at the Circus Circus and couldn't believe they wanted $10 for a footlong.  This place is a must for a budget minded traveler staying at the Stratosphere.  The omelet was decent sized, and the pizza buffet had huge amounts of salad and pasta as well.  I only wish that the Casino section of the establishment had some low stakes table games as well.  I would certainly have preferred to hand a small operation like this my money as opposed to the big casinos.",0elFmyyrLaYjbTHa6LMudQ,3,0,4,CRo3yEAzAtfv0hFx88ou-w
1459604,2014-04-18,14,PsRvJffbQdaHhK9xHxB06A,"Sometimes you hit magic. You know what I mean, that hole-in-the-wall joint that where you would never think to walk in the door, but somehow (for whatever reason), you go in that door, order some food, and you experience some of  the most amazing food that you've had in a long time.. e.g. Rollin' Smoke BBQ, Fat Choy etc...

OK, this is not one of those places.

This review is for the Asian/American cafe that is located inside of the casino. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but sometimes, it just needs to happen (if you don't believe me, go in this place and check it out).

I personally thought that we have moved past this type of food. Maybe like 20 years ago this might have been accepted as mediocre food, but now, I,Don't, Think, So!

I was thinking about giving this place 2 stars because the cashier lady was so friendly. And, she seemed genuinely concerned about making sure that I was alright. But, the food was speaking loudly too me, it was actually SHOUTING at me! So, here we go...

5$ Pho: Ok, lets talk about the broth. I'm talking Top Ramen here peeps. Like, water + powdered soup base. That's it. Mental picture here. Noodles: Pad Thai noodles. It looks like they weren't soaked and cooked properly, or possibly they were old because they had that slight woody taste.. The rare beef? Overcooked, well done (meaning past medium)  thick slices of flavorless beef. Finally, cilantro on top. That's all folks. Plus, i've had a tender stomach last night and the whole day today.

The owners seemed very nice so it pains me to do this. But I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I've been very fortunate to hit a lot of bullseye's in my foodie quest in Vegas. I've also hit some ducks along the way. Quack muthatruckin' Quack!",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,10,8,1,asIPXc7zkYG8NydTYeAiLw
1917361,2015-07-10,2,PsRvJffbQdaHhK9xHxB06A,"Across the street from the Stratosphere hotel and casino is this dive bar of a place. If it's an Inn, I missed that part of it. Looked to fit in more with the seedier side of the neighborhood surrounding the Stratosphere. When you go in you get the gist of it. Looks dirty, worn and with a somewhat sleaziness that can be unsettling to someone who appreciates more. 

BUT....

They serve $3.50 Bloody Mary's so I was hooked. The beer was for $1 and the bartenders were nice. Had no issue with anyone who was there. Had a buffet or some sort of food options I didn't explore.

FOR ME....the drinks were enough to be A-OK. It's location is convenient (If it were anywhere else I doubt I'd even set foot inside). While the Bloody Mary wasn't the strongest, it was enough for me to keep things moving.",2fx9sNxxTtsvb8KXaYJITQ,1,1,3,0zmL8Amm2JIUclHy5jNWPA
2101953,2018-03-29,0,PsRvJffbQdaHhK9xHxB06A,"This review is solely based on the food and environment.

I ordered Beef Pad Thai and it just didn't cut it. 
I'm big on Thai food and I just didn't like it. It was far from the traditional taste I'm used to. It was.. ketchup-y. The sauce for it was just off / not to my liking. 

Secondly. The place reeks of cigarettes. Now this is Vegas, so a good number of places here specifically Casino's and Inn's like this, the smell just offset my appetite even more. If you don't mind the smell then by all means. 

They do have a wide variety on the menu. From burgers to Mexican food etc. maybe I just made the wrong choice that day, I'm sure the burgers are fine.

Thai Tea was good. Good portion too, unlike other places that fill up a glass with 85% ice. 

They also have desserts here. I almost ordered a cheesecake. 

Service was very decent, considering I was the only customer but he looked like he was handling some of the gaming side as well. Experience went well.",MzjELU4yRjRj6pFZkpyPDw,0,0,3,CSSgm0LOo2N-x5xc3u2oxg
3580802,2015-01-31,0,PsRvJffbQdaHhK9xHxB06A,"This place reminds me a a hole in the wall seen in a Vampire movie. The people were nice. Avoid the timeshare people since they are not honest. Alex the owner did not even try to resolve the mis communication made by his staff and Michael tried too change offer to our disadvantage. My opinion of cons. They offer a dinner vouchers but in fact it's a restaurant.com discount certificate which most of the certificates were out of stock, and not at value in which they offer you for attending a presentation. The seller reps were nice and apologized. This is a TLC presentation selling RCI foreclosures.

5060156,2012-06-21,6,PsRvJffbQdaHhK9xHxB06A,"INEXPENSIVE Pizza-Salad-Pasta Buffet!

SITREP

There is NOTHING Spectacular about this location (across the street from the Stratosphere) nor it's menu (QUITE ordinary).  And though that does not sound like a stellar-recommendation for someone to ""go-out-of-their-way to come to"", it IS what it IS, and if you are close by and hungry, this is a stop definitely worth poppin for. 

SETUP

As a guest in the Stratosphere, I first noticed Aztec Inn when I was walking to the Circle K (and I should review this Circle K, cause IT is very cool too), and saw that they had a $6.95 all you can eat Pizza Buffet.   I pay this when I do the pizza buffets at Roundtable and Mountain Mike's back in Sacramento.

THE MENU

This buffet was so much better with:

*  A big selection of pizza slices (including a substantial amount of veggies & pesto based-sauces);
*  A big selection of leafy greens, lots of different salad toppings and options;
*  A pasta bar with a couple of different selections, usually one with a meat sauce, and then another with a marinara or an alfredo-based sauce; and,
*  The bottomless soda was also a great plus.  

Being in the casino also allowed many patrons to take advantage of the FULL bar nearby which was it's own separate cost (but usually spirits beyond normal beer & wine are available in most pizza establishments, and sometimes not even the beer & wine).

THE LOWDOWN

Sure, it's very quaint, not at all elegant, but if you're trying to mind your money, and don't want to get stuck putting out $50-$70 for a buffet wristband on the strip that will anchor you to only a handful of food & diversity options for three days, then these little out of the way places are true gems to enjoy.",3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w,13,6,3,ie_S8DiML3zHN0RMVM5OcQ
