The other few Filibertos around aren't a whole lot better. This place is actually pretty damn good! It's easy to think that every single one of these places is exactly the same but each one has just a touch different flare to their menus and this place is no exception. The prices are much more reasonable than Filibertos, and the actual spices that they put in their products make the food tastes so much better.

This place is consistently very good, and I'm even more of a fan now that Robertos jacked their prices way up all across town. Now this place is roughly the same price, but the food quality is a small step up from Robertos.

If you like a mostly meat-filled burrito this is the place to get it, for a fairly reasonable price of about 6.50 after tax given the size and quality. They also have some daily $1.50 rotating specials on weekdays and street tacos are always $1.50 each (and pretty good if on the small side).

The fries were also unseasoned, although that's particularly common it was still disappointing. They were served as a layer of fries and gray, bland meat on the bottom followed by miniscule layer of guac and sour cream. A final layer of melted shredded cheese was thrown on top.

We eat here frequently. We are a house divided. Our adult children prefer Robertos. We're older and have more money, so we win, unless they are treating. If you have adult children, then you know that we mostly have Rilibertos.
We always get drive though. Honestly, my husband gets drive through. I get served at home, because I'm a pretty pampered wife. The order is always correct; service is pretty fast; and the food is hot.
I ordered the fajita salad. It was more fajita than salad. I loved the onions; well cooked and a nice amount. There was a lot of chicken. Sadly, the pieces of chicken were cut pretty small. It needed more chips or tortillas. I would order this again, but with steak.",DwtArpGbgdqWOWnJzNGTpg,0,0,4,iIaPkf265xW7vsZWHMdDtA

I gave em another shot. This time I tried their chicken tacos special. Packed full of chicken with good flavor, even the rice and beans were tasty.  Went inside this time and had much quicker service and got to sample all of their salsas from the salsa bar. Everything was hot and tasted fresh. Will be back to try more!",6sevi2Wr-TrCi4KANT7XeA,3,2,4,jvuhy1yCQyJkxXT-1r5i9Q

The portions were smaller than Rivas. I'm on the hunt for the best Mexican food near me. As of right now my all time favorite is TACOS HUEVOS at Charleston Blvd and Main Street. Their portions are huge, prices are cheaper and the food is VERY flavorful!",LZWK3ilsvimioMrG-fIvbw,0,0,3,yy5q3qdFdeKqBDYQzssX1A
