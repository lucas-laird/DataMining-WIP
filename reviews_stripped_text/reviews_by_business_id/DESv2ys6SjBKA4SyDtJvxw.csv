I had the calamari appetizer which was awesome and I don't say that very often.
Their cappuccino is also very good. I would definitely recommend this place for a date or date night. It sure beats the place that use to be there before it was Ferraros.",TtV527nQhO9ziCMEIhGEKg,1,0,4,g7pqunFg4KmcT6Er8vMfeQ

First we got the wine list, waiter was very pushy, trying to get us to buy the bottles. Took 15-20 mins just for him to take our drink order, and doesn't even ask me if I would like a drink. Even the water took awhile to get. The waiters attitude didn't change all night. Pushy, short answers, and just not pleasant. I give this place two stars because of the fact that I was my girls bday, and no one should be treated like this on their special day.

The food is still amazing.  My dad is a big fan of osso buco and he said this is one of the best.  I would definitely recommend the pasta I got, the Pappardelle Mimmo which is a seafood and truffle pappardelle.  We ordered a different ravioli this time and it was also delicious.  I would recommend the pasta here, even though the meat dishes are very good, the pasta is really where this place shines.  Oh and also there was a really beautiful soft mozzarella and prosciutto salad, but the menu changes seasonally so it may not be there when you go.

Also as a heads up, the building is in a strip mall and doesn't look like much from the outside.  But I promise it is so great you won't even notice that the next time you go.",mlgiry9XO2wYxqfWDDVsUg,1,0,5,YvXNEZnssAiOFJPYmDhzqQ

We showed up about 20 minutes early and got a table immediately in the back room of the restaurant next to a table that was set up for a large party. Our server, Kimberly, greeted us and went though the water preference, specials and ""things we needed to know"" spiel. My boyfriend was currently doing a water cleanse and was not dining. She was very accommodating and VERY nonjudgemental, engaging him in questions about the cleanse and alerting the bus boys to not fill his water glass throughout our visit. Our friends ordered a nice bottle of wine and I ordered a glass of white (told her I liked sweet and she immediately suggested Moscato which I could not drink fast enough!). I had a caesar salad before my meal  and it was delicious. We shared a beef carpaccio which Kimberly cut and served to us. Again, delicious. Then, on to the main courses. I had lobster ravioli topped with a nice cream sauce and shaved asparagus. TO DIE FOR!!!!! My friends had the rabbit and veal both of which did not disappoint. Dessert was also amazing, we had cannoli, tiramisu, crepes with nutella (!!!!!!!!!!!!) and poached pears. I loved that my cappuccino came with a rock candy sugar stick to sweeten, I have never sent that before. Although Kimberly's large party arrived while we were mid-meal, she remained attentive as did the server assistants. I was more than pleased with my experience and cannot wait to dine here again. Everything was perfect from the first impression, Kimberly's service and to the maitre d' sending us waddling into the night with a handshake. Not going to dinner here is doing yourself a HUGE disservice. Do not miss out on Ferraro's! *** Also they LOVE locals!!!!",LVRSwy0ZJIT464mmkjwi5A,1,1,5,_stYd35e7auT_r3Ht6zUIQ

99768,2011-06-18,0,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I had heard of this place once before but just in passing. So this time when one of my colleagues suggested we go there for their Osso Bucco, ""it's the best"" he claims, what kind of Italian would I be to turn that down? We were at the Hard Rock Hotel for a meeting and made our way across the street to a strip mall where this gem is located. It was lunchtime, late lunch, and we were hungry!

First I will say, the service was excellent. Courteous, efficient, and always with a smile. The atmosphere was just right, matched the quality of the entire experience. The menu and wine selections were well varied, not too much, not to little.

I had ordered the same glass of wine my friend did, and he came back with the wine he informed me that there was one glass left in the bottle they had on hand. He said it would be 10 minutes before they would have another bottle on hand and would l like another glass complimentary of something else while I wait? But of course! And it was more like 5 minutes until the other bottle arrived. You could not wipe the smile off my face.
Similar thing for my friend who ordered a Martini, they poured him whatever extra was left in the shaker into a second glass and brought it to him. THAT is service!

Ok, now for the food... It was literally the best Osso Bucco I have ever tasted. It melts in your mouth, in fact I don't think words can describe it. We had commented that it had to take longer than 4 or 5 hours to prepare and cook this masterpiece (not while we were waiting of course, it's an ordeal to prepare this dish). Just as we were talking, the chef & owner Mimmo came out to check on us and he told us it was an 8 hour process. Thank god someone knows how to take their time and care for food as much as Mimmo! We showered him with compliments, our other 2 friends with us had the veal ravioli special and raved about it as well. Not a single person at our table had a complaint. We all swore it was the best.

How can this experience get any better you might ask? Well, when Mimmo sent out a complimentary dessert plate for each of us we about died! A small piece of the tastiest Tiramisu and a mini Cannoli took em back to memories of my Italian grandmother's skills. They were perfection.

If you are in Vegas, do yourself a favor and dine here. You will not regret it. It can be pricey, but it's well worth it. I think the places outside of the hotels & off the strip work harder to provide better food and service than the swanky places in the big hotels, and this place proves my theory right. 

I will be back to work my way through their entire menu.

If you visit, tell Mimmo hi for me!

139268,2016-11-25,0,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Every experience I have had prior to tonight's Thanksgiving dinner at Ferraro's has been wonderful. I brought my parents for the anniversary tasting menu during their visit this past summer, and they loved it so much they brought a group of friends from Illinois out to try it a few months later. So when I saw the ad for the Thanksgiving dinner offering, and my parents were visiting again, it seemed like a homerun. 

Sadly, we were all very disappointed. The menu was set and you were not able to order anything but the special menu--no substitutions. We all decided to try the Thanksgiving menu: 4 courses including soup/salad, pasta, turkey dinner, and dessert. The salads were great, and the pasta dish (sweet potato gnocchi) was bland but ok. The turkey dinner was horrible. The turkey was a turkey roll. No doubt about it, clearly heavily processed and more than likely frozen. The mashed potatoes had zero flavor (which was strange given that there was garlic chunks in them) and it was hard to tell what was saltier: the gravy or the turkey roll. 

When I spoke to the manager he stated that the turkey was fresh--the cook deboned the turkeys and rolled them--but it was obviously processed. When I expressed my disappointment, the manager stated they had sold 300 dinners and had no complaints. This was odd as we could clearly see those who ordered the turkey were not sending back empty plates. More than anything it's just a huge disappointment as we decided not to make a traditional home cooked Thanksgiving dinner based on our previous experiences at Ferraro's; none of us finished our meals this time and it's unlikely we will return. 

For Italian food, they are great. But they need the stick to what they know.",kVYgUMclv_p3IM4AFTMqIQ,0,0,2,gBS4MTiosdMJEQo7gzDQag

Looking for some ""real"" Italian food after moving from NYC 6 years ago, we came here on the recommendation of a waiter at another restaurant while on vacation. Joaquin was a consummate host - asking if we had any food allergies or food we didn't like - and then brought out an excellent sampling of 4 dishes to choose from. So difficult, as everything was prepared so well.  Reminds me of the fancier italian places we used to go to in NYC that had creative menus. The owner came out and thanked us for coming - asking if there was anything he could do. Other than make by stomach larger so that I could eat even more, there wasn't.

Fought are way through the homeless people to get to the restaurant and we were told due to our being late our reserved table with the waiter who recommended this place was gone. When I explained we were late because your valet service was non existent it didn't matter and the gentlemen never did investigate what was going on with his valet as it was chaos when we left an hours later.

The food was incredibly disappointing my fiancé had Lasagna which was small portion and flavorless honestly a frozen grocery store bought lasagna has more flavor. I had veal scaloppine which was again a small portion and again had no flavor from the sauce. The veggie that came with it was awful. Service was outstanding as was the atmosphere. 

This place is an enigma as to why it has such a large following with average store bought Italian food level quality??? As hilarious as it sounds Olive Garden has better food?

Once we finished we move into one of the beautiful dinning rooms and began the main part of our meal.  I had the Colorado Rack of Lamb, which was exquisitely prepared although I can also say they have one of the best Osso Bucos you will ever expirence!

That is such a shame, when there are quite a few unemployed people who would be happy to take over for him.  AND, to top it off, we were there for HAPPY HOUR, where they advertise 25% off of all drinks during that time.  NOT ONE of us received our tabs with the discount on it, and we all had to give the checks back to the server so he could correct them.  PLEASE, he didn't seem like he was new at the job, so the only conclusion I could come to was that he was trying to rip us off intentionally.  The difference was a few dollars, but it's the principal.
It's a shame a bad server will probably prevent me from ever going back.  He must have been the same server Staci G. had on 6/14.  Sorry I didn't get his name.",9kV4tmBcE-l5tJqzgKjZRA,0,0,2,tE6jJANLY_8TwFI31qCNww

I can't afford most high-end restaurants in this town often, but when it's not my money I will certainly go all out!!  It was a bustling Thursday night and the service was excellent - exactly what you expect the service to be when you are paying those kinds of prices.  

Our party of 3 started with two appetizers - the calamari and the anitpasta meat/cheese platter.  Both were very good.  I've had better calamari elsewhere and would love to try something else next time.  We enjoyed the house wine, which is a bit cheaper than the others but still tastes very good!  

For my main dish, I ordered the Papperdelle Mimmo - served with lobster, scallops, and truffles.  It was by far the best Italian dish I have ever had.  BEST DISH EVER!  Okay, so I'm not Italian, have never lived in an Italian city, and have never had an Italian friend.  So to me, this was straight-up delish Italian food.  I would have licked the bowl if not for the fact that a.) I was interviewing a job candidate who I want to take the job and b.) I didn't want said candidate to know it was such a rare occasion to eat at a place like that on our salaries, which was not yet disclosed to her!  

WORD TO THE WISE (and budget friendly diners) - this place is EXPENSIVE.  For my party of three with one person not drinking alcohol, our bill was $222 before tip.  Do I think it was worth the money?  YES.  

I am looking forward to trying some lunch specials - which are less expensive - in the near future.  And according to some Yelp reviews here, they offer a LOCALS 50% off - but I wasn't aware of that until now, which is too late.

Additionally, the ambiance is OK, basic wines and little green shrub things and some wood stuff.... nice decor. It seems very generic Italian high end though. Where is the true character?

It was not an overly busy night in the restaurant and service was good. We ordered the stuffed peppers, tripe, osso buco, spaghetti with garlic and olive oil, rabbit, veal milanese, a special pasta that was supposedly excellent (friend liked it so much he was unwilling to share).  I'm sure I left something out but all in all the meal was fine. The standout for me was the tripe. It was absolutely delicious. Cooked perfectly with tremendous flavor (maybe a littler hotter and spicier would have made it best ever), so much so we ordered another with dinner. The specialties were where they fell a bit flat. The osso buco was fairly bland and the meat a bit stringy, almost as if they did not have the best quality meat and not braised long enough. Not bad, just not great and far from a specialty. The same could be said of the rabbit. Fairly bland and unremarkable. All in all it was a very enjoyable evening with friends.

My waitstaff of choice since my very first visit at the new location has been Walter. Ferraro's has excellent servers and bartenders throughout the house, but Walter has been my choice from day one one Paradise. Mimo, the owner is without a doubt the penultimate hands-on owner whose one focus is for his customers to be treated like family, and served a meal they cannot wait to tell their friends about.

All of my guests that have enjoyed the Ferraro experience ask during the year if we are going to  go back again when we are in Vegas. I love this, bcause it has been my calling card. While my competition spends way too much at one of the Strip Hotels for a meal not even close to Ferraro's, I am creating memories of a first class dinner with a perfect wine for every meal.

Due to many circumstances it has been three years since I have seen my friends at Ferraro's. But, I am back this year and cannot wait to see the entire crew. My biggest problem is deciding between the Osso Bucco, the Pasta with Caviar, and which Brunello to complete the deal.

Fortunately, at the time, my companions made it a point to post positive reviews of the restaurant.  So, when I had relatives visiting from out of town, looking for a late night meal, I proudly recommended Ferraro's. 

The restaurant could not possibly have made me look worse than with the sad events earlier tonight.  The back patio - normally quiet and sane - was booked for a private party and it was loud and rocking.  No problem by itself, but I wonder if it left the dining room understaffed.

Not to belabor the details, but the meals we were served would have been terrible by Olive Garden standards.  Each of our three entrees were served cold (you'd have to heat them a few degrees to get to lukewarm) and were mostly inedible.  The fact that all three of us left 80% of our meals untouched was clearly lost on the busboy who was surprised that none of us requested a doggy bag.  After waiting 45 minutes for our food to arrive, none of us was in the mood to even consider a re-order even if it had been offered - which (it's important to note) it was NOT.  Our waitress simply dropped off our check and rushed off to the next table.

I don't know if any of this was because the kitchen was overwhelmed, or if the one lone waitress in the dining room didn't bring them out quickly enough - and quite frankly I don't care.

It may have been just another day on their schedule and - oops - they messed up during a pre-booked party, but it was a very important event in my life and that meal was simply unacceptable.  

Certainly by my previous experiences, and by the reviews of others on this page, your odds favor a good experience.  But I like to leave my gambling at the tables and - now that this restaurant is clearly not a sure thing - take my business elsewhere.

Oh, yes... shame on you, Ferraro's.  When you stop caring about one customer, how long before you stop caring about them all?  Keep offering 1/2 off deals for locals and then treating us like crap. It's a guaranteed long-term recipe for failure.",KVGxs-NiT5g-8uiHzu2bEw,7,0,1,XiPCjRLoKQBB9ThHw7bOFg

I was stunned!  (My husband had returned to the table) to see me, and the others in a shocked state. I would like  to take the higher road and say that I don't believe she realized what she had said to me.

So in short we settle for the over priced $98 bottle of Ruffino Chianti Classico. The water was great but it lacked the lemon we asked the waitress to bring and received none until we asked the server to bring us some. (With a smile still). 

The menu's came and my husband who never complains about anything was taken back by the prices. Thus adding insult to an already injured evening we ordered our perspective appetizers, and meals and carried on conversations to pass the time.

From the ordering of an over priced bottle of wine, ($98) to a menu of food that was good but not off the charts, we could have gotten the same quality and better serve elsewhere. My friend order the Risotto the price was $30.   Risotto!!! Not only was this one the most expensive restaurants, for the quality of food but the service unfortunately didn't add up.  Speaking of service: This evening was so slow that they had a table with a party of 7 who ordered their drinks and their meals up and leave.

Anyway the highlight of the evening:  We found out that if you are a Las Vegas resident you could get 50% off your meals (Alcohol not included of course). Oh! but the waitress forgot to tell my son that...who is a new resident and had left early because of the time. Thank goodness for great friends we met their for dinner. They told us! So that whopping over $400 and then some bill was reduced by the great friends.  So all in all the evening blessing was we got to spend it with our son and our friends who met us their for dinner. No we didn't get dessert!

Being thankful for good and bad experiences teaches us much about life.",oj7KGvd-JnLGpTr-yvi2SQ,3,0,2,9T25jdvZ0zK7wlO2ZEpsXA

The restaurant is cozy, they have an extensive wine list, and despite the ""dressed up"" atmosphere, the vibe is relaxed.  The food was great!  Simple Italian preparation with tons of flavor.  I had the Veal - the meat was juicy and tender, and the sauce was deliciously tangy.  I ordered the Grilled Asparagus as a side, which was perfectly cooked.  Everyone in our table enjoyed their meals as I heard a lot of yum-yum noises throughout dinner.  Paolo took care of us and was very helpful with wine suggestions (the Chianti he recommended went beautifully with my dish).  At the end of our meal, Paolo surprised us with complimentary dessert!  We each had a tiramisu and canoli - light yet luscious and tasty!  

This next part of my review is all about customer service.  Aside from being charming and attentive, Paolo went above and beyond his job description.  He called us two cabs (there were 10 of us) to take us to the Luxor after dinner.  One came and turns out, the second one never arrived.  When our friends finally met us later, they told us that Paolo ended up driving them to the Luxor!

Their food is so delicious, everyone is very friendly, and they have a wine list second to none. If you come when it's not 100F in Vegas, I highly recommend getting a table in the patio, especially if you're on a date ;) Your date will be impressed.

This is a family owned place, real Italians. Chef Mimmo is a great cook, and he always comes out to the dining room to check on everyone. His brother Walter is the best PR in town, he practically knows everyone and he's always happy to make your Vegas stay more enjoyable and memorable. Joaquin is our favorite server, he knows the menu top to bottom and he always has a couple recommendations off the menu that will knock your socks off. 

As far as the food goes, I don't know where to start... My all time favorite is the ribeye, which is actually not on the menu, and is not always available... That piece of meat is better than any steak you will have at any of the top steakhouses, word. The pappardelle Mimmo are also to die for if you are a seafood lover.

737605,2014-05-28,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I struggled with whether I want to write a review about Ferraro's or not. It's like talking about a broken relationship which started with beautiful moments and ended on a really sour note. It's almost painful to talk about it. But for the sake of yelpers, here goes...

I've been a customer of Ferraro's for more than 10 years. Since it's days on Flamingo. I'd held business lunches, family dinners, business dinners, happy hour gatherings, etc. at Ferraro's. The food was good and the service was impeccable. That all ended one fateful March evening in 2014.

I was hosting a party for 18 business associates. Of course, I had hit up my trusted Ferraro's and made a reservation with them 3 weeks ahead of time, requesting a private dining area. They said OK, it's available. When I got there, I was informed that they at a problem with the reservation and the area was being used by another party. So they sat us at a long table right by the bar. Hmm, I didn't quite like that, but brushed it off. Well, that was the start of the end...

Service was incredibly slow. We couldn't get the attention of our server to get our drinks refilled or orders placed. Then, surprise, surprise, appetizers arrived at our table. Chef's choice. Who ordered those? No one from our table. Ooooh...must be compliments of the chef? But no, I was charged a hefty sum for that, I found out later.

Our server finally came around to taking dinner orders at 8:30pm. I ordered a filet mignon, medium rare. When my steak came, it was so overcooked, there was only a slight hint of pink. At best, a medium well. Definitely not medium rare. I spoke to the server and she said flippantly said ""oh, that's how we do medium rare at Ferraro's."" What?? Excuse me, even culinary school dropouts know that that ain't medium rare. So I sent it back.

The next time it came out, it was blue. It was seared 2mm on both sides, the rest of the meat inside was as rare as sashimi. Everyone at the table was appalled. I think one of them heard my steak moo. As for me, I was beyond words. Surprised, appalled, angry, disappointed. I try to see it in every positive light possible (steak and eggs breakfast!) but it comes back to one cold hard fact: this was a loud f-you from the chef, to a loyal and very nice customer of 10 years who had spent a lot of money at this joint. 

At this point, I realized that our relationship is over. Time to move on. Plenty of fish in Las Vegas...",awiOW-gm261UFBQTrq30WA,0,0,1,9DiQoUae5WJzMwSsvtRJMg

The risotto Nero is nothing but rubbery old lobster Zatarain's rice from a box!! YUCK!!! My husband got the osso buco. It was bland in a generic sauce with no vege's or tecture. Slimmy meat. Our son's pasta was also bland and very undercooked and I know what al dente means. When I sent back my HORRIBLE RISOTTO NERO that acted rather pissy to me and the waiter just walked AWAY without even asking me if I would like something else. I guess in a very vain attempt to try salvage a tip they sent out 3 little sloppy desserts with very melted sloppy ice cream never even asking us what we might have wanted for dessert! But the creme de la creme insult (excuse the pun) was they actually had the nerve to put a 3/4 burned USED CANDLE on my husband's dessert!! How RUDE. I think when you spend 250.00 on a bottle of wine you should be treated with some respect and hospitality not like the people whom you are trying to insult.

What a treat!
The restaurant is in a strip mall so we were not expecting how nice it was inside.
We started with meeting Gino the owner -- fun and friendly. Then his staff. We were laughing and having a good time even before ordering wine (very extensive list) and appetizers.
We started with the meatballs, arancini, salad, and rigatoni Bolognese. We could not believe how wonderful every item was. We scarfed everything down and ordered more plus a pizza appetizer. I guess we should have just had dinner but this sure was fun.
My husband and I go to Italy every year and this is the best Italian food we've had in the USA.

903689,2015-05-13,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I reserved to have my girlfriends birthday dinner here on April 25th , 2015 . it was her 30th bday so I wanted something special for her and to have  a good time , good food and good memories . Well we got 1 of the 3 . The food was very good and depending on what you got the portions were perfect . However our server ( tony)  ended our night on a bad note and we will definitely never be going here again. 

At first when we arrived we loved the look of the place and the welcoming atmosphere from our waiter and servers. We had a large party ( 16 ppl) and spent  $700  in this restaurant. As we finished dinner Tony brought the check out as 1 bill, as a courtesy  to him I said that was fine and we would just try and see who had what and let him know what to charge on which card. Well the amounts on the check were not adding up to what people purchased and it was becoming very difficult to distinguish , after about 30 minutes myself and a friend  asked Tony if he could please just separate the check so we could see why the amounts weren't adding up and also to make it easier on us to be able to pay separate checks for each party , I explained to him that it had already been 30 minutes after we had finished dinner and we just wanted to be able to pay and leave and continue our night , as we had plans and places to be . He just straight out told me no he could not and would not do that because it was not possible . I asked him then "" Can you ask a manager to see if they can help us out , since the customer is priority and this trying to figure out the bill is becoming a huge inconvenience  for myself and my party "", he then responds with  "" No I cannot because then I must run 7 different cards and do separate transactions and that would be you inconveniencing me as a server and take up time and before I could get another word out he simply walked away from myself and my friend. I was completely taken back that he would even speak to me in that way , me being a customer who just had a party who spent a good amount of money  in the restaurant. We did find a manager on duty and explained to her what just happened and she apologized on his behalf but said that there was nothing she could do as the max cards they could run were 6 cards . We had 7 and they would not even make an exception and find a way to help us. 

What really irritated me was that he had made that comment that it would inconvenience him and take up time  and the attitude he had that went with it  and he did not even try to get a manager to help or assist . 

Funny thing is...I didn't just look up the restaurant  on Google or yelp, a local in Vegas ( a  good friend ) recommended it and when I told him about my experience he was so embarrassed. 
Also when Tony took our cards to pay the bill, it took him 15 -20 minutes to come back . Therefore , it still took him a while to run the cards we did give him, so why not just separate the checks like I had asked and let us pay that way , as it would've taken the same amount of time to just accommodate my party. 

Luckily this did  not ruin the whole night , but I believe it was  an unacceptable and embarrassing situation for this restaurant owner, The  staff should be better trained than to argue and be rude with customers. we would have  loved to try the wine bar or happy hour next time , since we are in Vegas a few times a year.. but we will not be going back here again.

Ambiance - Ferraro's is not in one of the casinos which is typically our preference and the overall ambiance was nice. A bit noisy but comparable to many other places.
Food - A bit on the expensive side compared to the Italian restaurant we frequent.  Lasagna was good but not great.  My wife and step son had the ""half chicken"" and both had to be the smallest chickens we have ever seen.  We actually joked they were game hens.  They said the flavor was good but the portion size for the chicken and sides was very small. 
Service - service was okay but a bit slow plus when we asked the waiter about items on the menu he said it was new and couldn't really impart much knowledge.  I had also said something to him about the chicken after it was served and he just chuckled and opted to do nothing about it. 
Wine corkage - we had brought our own wine and hadn't thought to ask ahead of time about the corkage fee since they are typically around $20 or so.  Here it was $50 which is ridiculous plus their wine list was overpriced.  For some of the wines we knew it was 3x to 4x mark-up.  Once again, I expect 2x to 3x but this seems excessive. 
Bottom line we won't be back.",VKCHVb_iOTrxhmJ3b5_PqQ,0,0,2,kcmeOaHuALF6RUYwOqMDcw

Came here for dinner two nights ago and got seated immediately in the bar area. Considering it was a Friday night, I didn't expect to get seated so quickly. The waiter quickly let us know that if we were locals, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on the menu was 50% off. 

Carpaccio Torcello: Amazing! All the flavors melded so well together. The argula added a nice peppery bite, while the parmigiano added just enough saltiness to accentuate the beef...and the truffle oil....well, truffle oil just makes everything better!

Carpaccio di Tonno: Again, this was amazing! None of the ingredients in this dish over powered the other. They seem to only bring out the beautiful flavors in each other. A must try if you love ahi tuna.

Funghi Misti al Forno: Delicious! I'm not sure how the pizzas are cooked, but by the looks and taste of it, I would think it was brick oven baked. The edges were crispy, the mozzarella was perfectly melted and the mushrooms (not sure what kind of mushrooms they were) but they still had a nice bite to them (kind of like enoki mushrooms). PERFECTION!

Fettuccine Pomodoro: Fettucine with Fresh Tomato, Basil, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil topped with Fresh Ricotta. The noodles tastes as if they were made fresh. This dish has no meat whatsoever, but you definitely do not miss the meat with all the great ingredients and flavors going on in this dish. The ricotta was a great addition as it added a silky creaminess to the dish without being too heavy. Again, to me, this was PERFECTION!

Pinot Grigio - Veneto, Italy, '09 - Slightly sweet and the perfect pairing to the pizza and pasta

Pinot Noir - (not sure of the location or year) - delicious, warm aromatics and was a perfect pairing to the carpaccios.

Ruby Slipper Martini - delicious! There's definitely alcohol in this! Even though it tastes like fruit punch, it definitely creeped up on us a little later.

Ordered sparking water and the waiter kept filling my glass with tap;( and then bringing me a new glass each time.
The lobster ravioli wasnt bad, but nothing special. My friend had spaghetti and meatballs and it was BAD. How does an Italian restaurant screw up spaghetti and meatballs???? The noodles were crunchy and the sauce was like canned tomato sauce heated in the micro and the meatballs smelled like canned dogfood. As we left, an older gentleman( owner? Manager?)  asked if everything was ""ok"" and I said "" it was ok"" and he was offended and questioned in his hammed up Italian accent ""where we'd had better food?""

We started our meals with wonderful warm bread served with balsamic vinegar, olive oil  and caper mixed.  One of our party had the special of the day Sea Bass which Virgilio highly recommend and turned out to be the best Sea Bass he had ever tasted and coming from the NW that says a great deal. I had veal with a caper sauce which had a balance of flavors paired with broccoli rabe. The bitterness of the broccoli  really balances with the creaminess of the sauce and the brine taste of the capers. The others in our party also spoke extremely high of their meals and stated it was the best meal the have had in Las Vegas.

Our server Virgilio was not only a very gracious waiter but was informative with suggestions, recommendations, knowledge of the food and preparations but also was easy to get along with in a teasing manner and would ask for him next time we dine there.

I must mention that we did receive a very special treat from a gentleman who does a fantastic private magic show randomly at tables, if he offers to do one at your table make sure to watch closely it is excellent.

My date ordered the Half-chicken and said it was delicious; I had the filet because I am an asshole and a very expensive date.

My husband and I were in town for a relaxing weekend after a week-long business trip that I had, and we wanted to eat at a non-casino place. So we googled ""best Italian food, Las Vegas"" and Ferraro's came up as #1 on a Best Of list. So we made reservations and gave it a try.

We have visited Italy several times and can honestly say that this is the best Italian food we've eaten outside of Italy. My mouth still waters just thinking about it!

The hostess was so friendly and nice when we arrived. We thought we might want to eat outside since they had misters, so she took us out there to get a feel for it and even with the misters it was way too hot. She didn't mind letting us decide, and happily brought us to an inside table.

Our sever was fun and hilarious. Friendly and attentive. I wish I could remember his name. We asked him to choose the wine for us to pair with our entrees (Fettucine Alfredo and lasagna) and the choices he made were perfect. We chose Fettucine Alfredo because their menu stated that they make their pasta fresh in-house and that is the best way to have Fettucine. It was PERFECT. Also, we love a homemade lasagne that is made fresh with a bolognese and béchamel sauce and again - SO GOOD. We also had the caprese salad (amazingly fresh and delicious) and even just the olive oil and balsamic they prepared with the bread at the table was over the top - with a scoop of fresh pesto in the center - OMG.

 We just cannot say enough about this place. We will ALWAYS return when our travels take us to Las Vegas. The owner came to our table and asked how things were - and I don't know if we just gushed about our experience, or told him it was our anniversary recently, or just he is a very smart restauranteur, but he brought us a complimentary dessert sampler too!

I stumbled upon this restaurant on the weekend of my anniversary. My boyfriend had asked me where I wanted to go and I had told him to surprise me. Well, he sure did and he did a great job by picking Ferraro's. We had reservations but arrived about 30 minutes early. Regardless, they seated us right away. Within a couple of minutes, our amazing waiter grabbed us some drinks, bread + olive oil and left menus for us to review. 

We ordered the cheese platter (Formaggi) as an appetizer & pasta (Fettuccine Pomodor con Ricotta Fresca) for dinner. The pasta itself was more than enough and the ingredients were fresh. 

I think what topped it all off for me was the fact that they seated us in an area that was away from the more ""casual"" dining. We didn't have to ask, they just did this. Our waiter created a short lived relationship and shared some stories about his hometown in Italy. 

I might add that the Wine Bar has such a large selection. I've seen some reviews on here that complain about how much wine they get but, really? If you're looking to get shit faced off wine with a full ""glass"" of it (lol), you probably don't belong here.

My wife ordered the lasagna, after much deliberation. She said that it was the best lasagna she'd ever had. I managed to get one fork-full away from her before it was gone and she was right--it was outstanding. I ordered the SPAGHETTINI SCOGLIO, which Gianni D said was his ""Friday night plate."" I don't care if he lied to me or not, because it was amazing--filled with lobster, scallops, shrimp, with a sauce that had a little bit of a kick to it but wasn't too spicy. 

There were two gentlemen singing/playing music next to the bar. I appreciate live music, so this was a welcome touch. The restaurant was hopping and a little noisy, but not to the point that I couldn't enjoy a conversation with my wife.

This was one of the places he recommended.

Located directly across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel, on Paradise, we found Ferraro's to be a FABULOUS find.

We shared TWO appetizers... absolutely heavenly.  They make their own fresh mozzarella (soft and creamy with the savory prosciutto)... and the balsamic glaze was sheer perfection!

   Burrata, Prosciutto, Rucola 
   Fresh mozzarella with a creamy center wrapped
   with Parma prosciutto over arugula salad

   Caprese di Bufala 14
   Imported buffalo mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, basil,
   extra virgin olive oil, balsamic glaze, pine nuts

Dinner... we went in two different directions:

   Pappardelle Mimmo for me
   Long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter,
   sage, truffle

   Filetto di Manzo for my husband
   Prime filet mignon topped with roasted peppers, mushrooms,
   onions over arugula

My pappardelle was delicious.  A lovely balance between the seafood, the light sauce, asparagus, and the truffles.  After having split two appetizers, I took home half of my main course.  My husband said his filet was perfect!  He is quite picky and is not afraid to express any disappointment or hesitation.

Our waiter, Edward, was grand.  He spent time with each of us, explained the specials, the locals favorites, and asked about our preferences.  The additional table staff kept our glasses topped off, the bread replenished, oil and balsamic (and herbs) refreshed.

Excellent, all the way around.  I recommend Ferraro's without hesitation and greatly look forward to a return visit!",ryxYbcfM79QYT8YA-oK1Aw,0,0,5,-uY3wEAxhG5cTuEKyS8zCQ

The environment is both very elegant and welcoming...you can absolutely let your hair down and have a great time, while being certain that everyone who works there is a professional. I read with great interest the comment posted by ""Mike N"" on 11/22....it stands out as such an anomoly among the reviews of this restaurant....and it always makes my ears perks up when someone says he never writes a review, then proceeds  to write a really negative one!  Some people only speak up when they have something negative to say...and for people like that, almost everything they say IS negative.  

I am very glad to see that the overwhelming majority of reviewers are commenting on both the outstanding service and food -- beause that's what Ferraro's has.  We've been enjoying this restaurant since its former location on the West side...it is one of our highlights in the city.  My husband and I eat at Ferraro's at least once a week...and I can assure you that Walter and Piero, as well as the GM, Adam, Mimmo, Gino, Jeff, Rick, Ali, and everyone else are 100% professionals. We have truly never had an experience there that wasn't amazing...and we've had lots of experiences!!!  The osso bucco, halibut, sea bass, filet, raviolo (just to name a few) are on our frequent flyer list...as well as many appetizers that I won't mention because I don't know the proper Italian spelling.

The bread and olive they offered were phenomenal. I ordered Agnolotti which was cooked in a delicious tomato sauce that i can't describe until you try .
The pizza and the crispness of the dough were amazing . The only reason I wouldn't give 5 because I was not too impressed with their appetizer that we tried  ( octopus and mozzarella cheese ) .

First of all, before moving to Vegas, I had never heard of reverse Happy Hours.  Are you kidding me?  HH at 2 am?  Good lord, I LOVE VEGAS!  Also, a bonus is that everything on the late night menu is 50% off!  Whaaaat?!

Their Italian dishes are the real deal.  Authentic, large servings and 100% pure delizioso!  My favorite being their Caprese di Bufala..  The Mozzarella is incredible!

Onto the pastas and Risotto.. Oy Vey!  So good!  Growing up in an Italian household, I know my Risotto.  I'm never fully happy with ordering risotto in a restaurant, but I always make an exception for Ferraro's.  The consistency is perfect, the rice is always al dente and they have a plethora of risotto dishes to choose from. As far as pasta goes, I love to keep it real and stick with Spaghetti but their stuffed ravioli Agnolotti dish would have to be my favorite.  So good! 

Lastly, the service is great!   The servers know Italian food and have personally tasted every item on the menu..  About 90% of the servers are from Italy, so the accents are always a plus to the dining experience.  They know it all and you have to respect that.

All in all, great environment, fun crowds, perfect service and delicious food!  

Ferraro's is right off the strip, so it's just a short cab ride away..  And, if you're a local trying to show your out-of-town friends a nice late night meal, go here!",0uo7LHVMFaDf1PkcGZprNg,14,9,5,gUYj86pJSLP1Px_ZrCaFVQ

Our server was a joke on the other hand, he asked us what we wanted to drink and he never ended up giving it to us. 

The busser noticed we had been sitting there for awhile so he took it upon himself to fill our waters. The server came by and noticed and yelled at the busser in the middle of dinner for doing such. Then when the server offered fresh Parmesan cheese for my mans salad, he said coming right up and once again never gave it to us. My man had to flag him down and then he tells us it's the bussers job to give us cheese when he offered and yells at him again. After dinner he brings dessert which was okay, we sat there for about twenty minutes with no sign of our server we ended up walked to the host desk and asked for the check there.

The service here was absolutely top-notch. We never had to ask for anything whatsoever. This place is class class class all the way. The ambiance was very soothing and romantic. 

But the food was the true star of the show, and man did we go nuts. We got two appetizers - risotto balls and the caprese mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. Both were absolutely delicious beyond all comprehension. The caprese - my god. The amount of cheese you get with this appetizer is mind-blowing. The only problem I had with the risotto balls was there wasn't enough, and it's not ideal for sharing because there are 5 of them - make it even! Six would have been ideal, especially for the regular price ($14 - ouch, but sooo worth it!). But I was a very good girlfriend and split the 5th one up evenly instead of devouring it myself ;D

We also split a house salad, which wow - this thing would have been enormous if I would have had it on my own. Heirloom tomatoes and the right amount of dressing made this dish delicious, and I'm glad I got my greens for the day! 

Our entrees were also ridiculously huge and I'm amazed that I finished every last bite. I got the gnocci with vegetables, and there was an excellent ratio in my dish, about one veggie per gnocci. Very tasty but once I got toward the end of the dish I realized it was just a teensy bit on the salty side, but still very delicious. Matt ordered a ravioli dish that he enjoyed very much. 

Even with all this food and being full beyond all reason, we couldn't pass up dessert - white chocolate raspberry creme brulee. The presentation was amazing and it was beyond delectable. 

I am very happy we decided to change up our Dad's Grilled Cheese anniversary ritual for Ferraro's. From the setting, to the service, to the food, everything was absolute perfection. I will definitely be coming back again!",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,6,7,5,X0QBlGl9NlsRlQLHxOgrvg
1512883,2015-05-24,0,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"This is the best meal I've ever had. I don't say that lightly either because I typically am underwhelmed with that state of Italian food here in the states. We were not only greeted by the owner Gino, but son Mimmo came out with each course and talked us through each dish. Even his nephew came by for a visit. It was that same hospitality and attention to detail that left me in complete awe in what I just experience.
Gino came by as we sat and asked if he could do a prepared menu special for us with a different wine pairing for each dish. Without hesitation we both agreed and began our culinary journey through Italy. He left us by saying ""you know this is the best Italian restaurant in the world right?""
Now, as you may already know, I'm not a foodie...and I'm the furthest thing from a Sommelier. I know enough about wine to know reds go with beef and whites go with pork and seafood. Gino knew everything. He has a cellar filled with the best and top wines from the old country. Nothing comes into his restaurant without his approval. He's visited all the vineyards so who am I to question this. He's also certified to do so and has the sophisticated palate to provide these choice selections with the dishes his son pairs to go with.
I would also like to add that all the seafood and meats in Mimmo's kitchen are 100% non-steroid/hormone, grass fed and Safe Harbor Certified Seafood guaranteed to be on you plate in less than 36 hours from being pulled from the ocean. It doesn't stop there because even the pasta, breads and dessert are all made in house, your choice, gluten free, and whole wheat. Impressive right? Incredible. The fact that I hadn't heard of this place until today left me feeling a little disappointed in myself.
I left here with a new appreciation for Italian food. I've been to Italy; I've dined at the high-end Italian strip restaurants and Ferraro's made them all look stupid. This place gave me one of the best meals of my life (and I've had way to many good meals to count). It is truly a family affair. In fact, Olive Garden should be sued because when you're at ferraro's, you really are family and they will never steer you wrong.",89kfxDjh6GqFg7LVRaL0Hg,1,0,5,qLXw1xcxgC1nh30CWI8oSA

My brother had the ""Signature"" Osso Buco and had to spit it in his napkin because it tasted so bad. 
As for the rest of our meals .. well they were not much better
As a matter of fact we ended up going to Subway afterwards because no one really wanted to make a scene in the restaurant but it became a joke while we were in the car.... not that my dad appreciated that much, since he had paid a pretty penny to feed the eight of us.

Our server was super nice and took great care of us all night. He made wine suggestions, all of which were right on point.  I should make a special point about the wine - the list is enormous and is about 98% Italian wines.  I had a wonderful Pinot Grigio that was almost honey colored, and was freaking incredible.  My HOHH tried a couple of different Barolo's, each of which was better than the prior one.

We ate a LOT - grilled asparagus wrapped with prosciutto and fresh mozzarella, a delicious Caesar salad, veal piccata and sea bass with a saffron/lobster sauce.  The sea bass was so good I almost wanted another portion, but managed to control myself.  I don't know how they did it, but the broccoli rabe served with the entrees was almost mellow flavored, rather than the usual bitter taste (which I happen to love).

I've been here about 10 times, I come to Las Vegas often (poker tables!) and I almost always come to Ferraro's once each time.

For starters, I got a half portion of gnocci in gargonzola sauce and the toothiness was perfect. There is not a doubt that it was made within the day.  
The specials of the evening were a whole fish, deboned table-side or a poached fish. So as not to offend the non-fish eater, I got the poached whitefish.  My French is good enough to know that Beurre Blanc sauce and what the fish was poached in means butter!

Even the bartender was very nice when we sat down at the bar. Our table was ready before we could order a drink but she was so sweet and had a great big smile on her face.

The Caprese is to DIE for, I highly recommend it.
The bread is soft and delicious.

Being vegetarian, I was a little intimidated by the note at the bottom of the menu, asking customers to ""Please Not Alter Our Menu""

However, when I told the waiter I was vegetarian, he offered up a modification of their Risotto, with mushrooms and artichoke and snow peas included. It was delicious, and the perfect match to the Riesling wine I had just ordered.

He was very polite, helpful and attentive.

Cute too ; )

The meal was a good price for a high-end Italian restaurant. I've had MUCH more expensive dinners here in Orange County, with comparable food but nowhere near as good of service as here at Mimmo's.

Like other secret gifts ... they come hidden away in surprising places ...  this one looks like an unassuming strip mall but once you enter it is an amazing and fantastic establishment.

Our waiter Alin was wonderful at helping us find something from the ridiculously comprehensive wine list ... it seems they have around 20,000 bottles on site so finding something needs a knowledgeable guide. 
I fancy myself a bit addicted to pasta and meatballs ... one of my guilty pleasures and trying a new place it is one of my go to items simply because I feel safe trying a basic dish. The inhouse ""made from scratch pasta"" and sauce were simply the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD ! That says a lot as I have eaten in probably every state and have become a little bit of a snob regarding pasta. It was perfectly 'el dente' and the sauce had just the right amount zestiness. My girlfriend Stacey has a lactose limitation and they were happy to accommodate her and she was thrilled with her papparelli and meat sauce as well. 
At the end of our meal Stacey asked if perhaps we could peak at the wine cellar and surprisingly despite being a very busy night the owner 'Gino' decided to personally tour us through the cellar and his kitchen! 
Simply put ... a FANTASTIC dining experience ! Thank you Gino and Alin for such a memorable night!!

I had lunch at Ferraro's today, and I must say, this place is a true gem in Vegas.

I'd been here once before for an Elite event, and remember the good times, and great food, but I wrote a review for the event. Now, I am proud to write this review and share this lovely restaurant with you.

The lunch menu is fairly simple ($10 per dish). Each item comes with house salad or soup. Get the salad with their house dressing. It's a fantastic balsamic vinaigrette. The plate is glazed with a balsamic reduction for show. And it's sexy.

My Dad and I ordered the Chicken Parm. It came with a side of rigatoni. It was so nice, The chicken was nicely breaded and crispy. Not oily, but had a baked in taste.

My angel of a mother had the Salmon which was topped with a lemon caper sauce, and also had a side of rigatoni. It was a fantastic combo.

The dinner menu is a bit more upscale ($25-$50), but I recommend this place for any special meal. The restaurant has been in business for over 25 years, and they know what they are doing.

Come here for the following:

A special date. Don't bring an ONS here. 
An announcement dinner: ""We're getting married:
A business lunch or dinner with clients.
Bachelor party looking for a classy dinner before a night of debauchery.

They have several wines available (and even wine lockers for the ballers). The beer selection is pretty good too.

Make it happen. This is your spot.",Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,1,1,5,7bgpHHfQtlibstpHTk0_VA

Walked past Ferraro's, figured we'd give them a shot. Typically not a fan of Italian food, because, like Mexican food, it's basterdized and dumbed-down considerably in the interest of ignorance and economics. Very rarely do you find a place that actually makes authentic, no holds barred cuisine.

This is one of those places. It's a real old-school genuine Italian restaurant. Lot's of dark wood, low lighting, a menu with names I can't read and some very apropos live music in the bar area. If you're into wine, the list is phone book thick. We flipped through it just for fun, but seemed like lots of depth.

Absolutely outstanding service. Our waiter, Mike (who looked like a close cousin of Vin Diesel), was a true pro. He, along with his support staff in the dining room, were great. Drinks never ran dry, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time, and everyone seemed happy to be there. We do not have service this attentive and friendly very often.

Pretty big menu, much more than what I initially perused on their website. Daily specials sounded solid, and Mike was able to make some suggestions for me. Girlfriend had an outstanding ribeye, perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered. I had some really great tortellini; very rich, great flavor and texture, perfect size portion. You can really tell that the pasta is made everyday in house. Best pasta dish I've had in years.

This place is a true gem, and was certainly the highlight of our quick weekend trip. Highly recommended, and certainly worth the quick drive off-strip to get to it.",F3B0UEWvx6Yj2FSdzj5g_Q,3,0,5,aVKdj30F7SLTXGCgpZFB0A

The not so good-The prices were really high. I was not expecting to pay 26 dollars for lasagna and 12 dollars for a dessert. Yikes! The bread was 50/50. It was a mix of a dinner roll and what seemed to be fococcia. The roll was good, but the fococcia was so dry, that the oil mixture didn't even soften it.

The food is exquisite! Hands down one of the top meals I have had in my life. My husband always orders the Osso Buco which doesn't require the knife they provide, as it falls right off the bone. The best part is the tiny fork that given so the marrow can be eaten. It's cooked perfectly and is heavenly on the palate.

Any of the Risotto dishes are classically prepared, rich and creamy and full of flavor. The lobster ravioli is heavenly and light. Like little pockets of clouds bursts with bold flavor.

Most importantly, I cannot forget to mention Mr. Geno, the owner of this fine establishment. He is truly passionate about his restaurant and his customers. He is a genuinely nice guy and actually sits with his customers just to see how they are doing and to ask if your meals were to your liking. At our last visit in May 2015, We had an amazing waiter Joquain, who was always there for any of our needs and provided unparalleled service.

I merely asked for dessert and the waiter gave a whole schpeal about how he's risking getting fired to give us a complimentary slice of cake for the birthday girl -- I'm not sure he was telling the truth or not, but I found it more annoying than flattering.

He also called out a roaming magician to perform tricks for our table. I guess is night, but I felt a little invasive.

Um, I guess it was alright.",37Hc8hr3cw0iHLoPzLK6Ow,5,3,3,Xh-Jy8T907VsERZ1r54u7g

This was my first time going to this place, as I live in LA and was in town for a few hours for a business dinner.  My clients suggested this place as they have been frequenting the business for over a decade.

As you walk in, you will see the many awards and accolades that this place has received on the wall to your right.  (The stretch from basically the floor to the ceiling lol) and the place is just warm.  on the opposite side is a family portrait (as this is a family owed restaurant.)  

As you walk to the host stand I was greeted by everyone from the host to the servers which was very inviting.  My clients had not shown up yet so i sat in the lobby and waited till they showed.  

Once we were seated the waiter was amazing.  Had an accent but explained everything very well and suggested one of the 3 specials for the night.  I cannot pronounce or even remember the name for that matter of the dish however it was 8oz of lobster, w mushrooms, homemade fettucini with a white wine butter/garlic sauce..BEYOND WORDS.  Was heaven in my mouth.

During dinner Mimmo Ferraro came to the table (the son of Mr. Gino Ferraro) who was the Exec Chef? to check on everything.  Was a very nice touch of class. And then about 20 mins later Gino came to the table as well.  I love the personal touch of the service from the owners.  Tells alot about a business.

I did not order desert, however next time i probably will.  This place is definitely on the higher end price wise but worth every single penny.

Gentlemen if you are looking for a place to take your date, this would be a great place.  We had a pretty great dinner meeting, not to loud, great ambiance just overall this place gets a 10!!!

This is my new spot in Vegas for dinner.  Cannot wait to come back.  

Thank you Ferraro's for a delightful dinner experience.",HnACS8alv8d9YBqhau7V_Q,1,1,5,Hhl6IvTl8_QNehFrDuCYtw

1942106,2016-06-28,9,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Came in for HH with friends when other plans fell through: called the Ora Sociale, from 4-7pm daily, there is a food menu and 25% off drinks in the bar and lounge area. I've heard great things about this place, and their HH in general, and was surprised to see that they weren't busy.

DRINKS: The Chianti by the glass ($13) is tasty, as was the Ciao Bella ($14) cocktail that I sampled from a friend. The drink discount is helpful, because HH food prices are only valid with a drink purchase.
ARANCINI ($6): Portion of four rice balls served with a truffle-tinged dipping sauce. These were a solid carb-o-licious option. 
POLPETTINI ($5): Portion of two meatballs, really tasty. Save the red sauce for dipping for your bread basket, it's good.
CALAMARI FRITTI ($8): Nicely crisp, mix of rings and baby squid, tasty marinara dipping sauce. Hard to go wrong iwth this dish.
CAPRESE SALAD ($5): Tiny and somewhat boring portion, two pieces of buffalo mozzarella and a wedge each of red and yellow tomatoes. Maybe their classic Ferraro salad is a better option.
SALSICCIA PIZZA ($10): San Marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, sausage with rapini and Calabrian oil. The sausage is not spicy, don't let that turn you off. Pizza is a decent size for sharing, crust is thin and crispy. Overpriced though IMO.
AGNOLOTTI ($7): Got this after seeing it recommended in a recent article, portion is two large ravioli stuffed with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, and mortadella with a light tear-drop tomato sauce. Not sure I'd get it again necessarily but it was good to try and the pasta itself was fresh.
CREPES ($12): From the dessert menu. Two rich Nutella crepes served with vanilla ice cream. I'm not  a dessert person, so this wasn't my pick but it was good. I'd see if they have a lighter fruit-based option instead.

Service was attentive, especially when it came to drink refills. Food came out fast, most prices were fairly reasonable (exceptions being the salad and pizza). They weren't busy for HH but definitely picked up around 6:30 as the dinner crowd started coming in. Note that there are several small dining rooms/nooks for a special occasion or family dinner. There's also a bathroom attendant, which I found odd. Undecided on whether I'd come back for dinner.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,18,4,x0E6u6fNR23wXIIhynwu9g

The smell was horrible, full of vinegar, I threw it in the trash can. I'm not sure if I was skimped by the restaurant or the delivery driver ate the most of it. The salad was mere lettuce with one large white onion chopped on top. I hate onions!! It was also a waste. I will never order from this restaurant again. When reading the ingredients, it noted that red onion were used. I didn't expect a whole onion chopped on top of it. Very disappointing.",ls28JLXa7ltUvnecWxUPyQ,0,0,1,hv0PWyGxASIgjS1y9RXIiQ

We started with: 
Fritto Misto $9
Fried calamari, shrimp, fennel, zucchini

- The calamari was delicious and the red sauce that comes with it is so yummy!  It was a huge plate... enough for 3 people to have a great appetizer!

For the main courses:
I had: 
Salmone Checca $14
Grilled salmon, fresh tomatoes, basil, fresh garlic and kalamata olives

- I feel like there should have been more kalamata olives for more flavor.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the whole thing, but it didn't have alot of flavor.  I think if they added maybe some more salt & pepper it would have tasted even better.  I would order it again, because it was light and I think could have more flavor next time.

My friend had:
Pollo Parmigiana $14
Chicken breast, mozzarella and tomato sauce served with a side of pasta

- He said it was good... but wasn't sold on it.  It looked really good!

We sat outside on a beautiful day and had excellent service!  They let us each use a $10 coupon for our main courses!  I can't believe it!

First, our waiter, Apollo, was incredible. He had no idea it was my birthday, but went above and beyond to make our general experience there memorable. He was always there to answer questions, our drinks were never empty, and his upbeat personality was contagious. He brought us a few things to sample, just because. I also couldn't decide between two entrees and he mentioned he would try to get me half of one and half of the other. And to my surprise, he followed through.
 
The food was amazing. We started with the Burrata salad and my taste buds were doing tiny little dances. I'm a Burrata freak (one of the reasons I went to this restaurant was because it was on the menu). My boyfriend had the lasagna, which is unlike any lasagna I've ever tasted, but in the best way possible. I can't remember the names of the pastas I had, but based on what I ate, I think one would be hard-pressed to find one they didn't like.
 
The night ended with some live Jazz music (which may have been our favorite part). I'm not really a Yelper, I don't really write many reviews, but I was so blown away by our experience there I had to make sure this restaurant gets the great review and Apollo is recognized for his amazing service.

Yes the place is in a strip mall but DO NOT let that deter you. We didn't dine off the menu instead we had the chef prepare us a 4 course meal based on our discussion of food when he came to say hi at the table. I immediately said that I was in the mood for pasta, love risotto, love arugula, proscuitto, cheese and that I am an eater... little girl with a love for food. 

First course was a sampler of risotto (best in my life ever) agnolotti pasta AMAZING, and a pesto risotto OMG incredible. 

Second Course: arugula salad with sliced proscuitto and buffalla mozzerella that was a ball of heaven. Perfectly dressed with a hint of lemon. Incredible!! 

Third Course: Oso Bucco which is what the restaurant is famous for. Literally falls off the bone and I'm not a huge fan of Osso Bucco but if you are don't leave this place without having some. It's cooked superbly. Chef also brought us linguini di mare with mussels, scallops, shrimp, octopus. Delicious. I was so full from the other courses that we had much to take home.

2086770,2012-10-03,0,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar is a unique get-a-away, to a land of wonderful, fresh, Authentic Italian Cuisine.

There are very few places where you may have an ""all - around"" experience. With each of your senses tantalized, you cannot help but enjoy Ferraro's Italian Restaurant.

This family owned establishment has boasted over 25 years in Las Vegas, Nevada.

As one of the most influential, top quality, ""Zagat Rated"", Fine Italian Restaurants in the State of Nevada (and in my opinion the U.S.A.), Ferraro's stands out from the rest.

Ferraro's has won many ""Best Of.."" Awards, and I am proud to say that I give them a Five Star Rating as well. To name a few of their ""Awards"", Ferraro's has been named ""Best Recommended By Michelin 2009"", as well as, ""Wine Spectators"" ""Best of Award of Excellence"" From ""Distinguished Restaurants of North America"" in 2008, and ""DiRoNa"" ""Award of Excellence"" 11 consecutive years in a row."" Just to name a few.

The staff is professional and knowledgeable about all of the menu items. The Family always makes sure that each guest is well taken care of and happy. When you walk into Ferraro's, you get the feeling of ""home"". It's a family atmosphere, with a flair of excellence. Just by looking at the decor in this establishment you know you are in for a treat. I sometimes forget that I am in Las Vegas, Nevada and feel as though I could be right in the heart of Calabria. That is where Gino Ferraro is from. Since 1985, Gino and his Family have taken Italian Cuisine to new heights. In 2003 Gino's Son, Mimmo, took over the kitchen operations and helped transform his families recipes into the very dishes that are served to each guest. This family is not new to the restaurant business, they are just re-inventing it. Having been involved with other family restaurants, they know what to do and how to do it FIRST CLASS!

Have you ever had a server come up to your table and eloquently tell you the specials of the day? Or, when your server remembers all of the menus items verbatim? It is a gift when each server has been trained so professionally. Most of the staff have been with Ferraro's since they opened, and they are considered part of the family. These are some of the small touches that make Ferraro's my favorite Fine Italian Restaurant in Las Vegas. This is a place to see and be seen. If you know good food and you're in Vegas, don't be surprised if you sit near someone famous.

While sitting at the beautiful table in the ""Main Dining Room"" with Walter Ferraro (another important asset to the Family & Ferraro's Restaurant), overlooking the casual ambiance of the rest of the restaurant, my food was ordered and arrived. It was picture perfect. I almost didn't even want to eat it. The dishes were bold and bright with color. The portions are not too big, and can also be family style for sharing. As if I were sitting in Italy the vegetables were so brilliant. The appetizer I ordered was the, ""Carpaccio Manzo"", Thinly Sliced beef, arugula salad, shaved parmigiano, truffle oil. It was so delicious.

My second simply scrumptious dish was the, ""Salsiccia Calabrese"", Ferraro's Homemade spicy sausage grilled, served with crispy polenta, and roasted peppers. As well as, the Imported FRESH Mozzarella.

Did I mention that Ferraro's has the best Homemade Pasta and Pizza to order? It's the real deal! This is what you would order if you were someplace in the middle of Italy.

As I took a bite of my, ""Agnolotti"", Ravioli filled spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, tear-drop tomato sauce, I was enjoying every minute.

On to my last course (before dessert). ""The Ferraro's House Speciality"", Osso Buco and Baby Lamb Chops. One word for both, OUTSTANDING!

The ""Osso Buco"" fell off of the bone and it was so perfectly cooked I was in heaven. If you love ""Osso Buco"", you should not be reading my review right now. You should be on a plane or in your car on your way to ""Ferraro's Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar"".

If you're a ""Wine Enthusiast"", the selection of wine at Ferraro's is one of the most notorious around. Ask, Joe Pike, the Sommelier to accommodate you. He is happy to help you find the best selection. Ask to see the wine cellar, if you're into that. It is phenomenal.

For those VIP guests, Ferraro's also offers private wine lockers for your special selections.

For dessert, my two favorites are the, ""Authentic Homemade Cannoli"", Trio tower of cannoli filled with smooth ricotta, sugar & cinnamon, with chocolate & raspberry sauces, and the, ""Tiramisu"", a Ferraro's favorite...classic Italian dessert made with lady fingers, Mascarpone cheese & espresso, also homemade.

Ferraro's Wine Bar is absolutely gorgeous. The bar area wraps around from the inside of the dining room to the ""one of a kind"" outside patio. The Patio is well decorated, simply classic, like a summer Italian Garden. Probably one of my favorite spots to sip on a glass of vino and relax.

As a ""Food Critic"" I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Ferraro's.",dnTasFNKRkoF_JtCdz--Lw,0,0,5,EQpGi7NQsY5hE7JQoNgzFw

We are a group of about 10 people, potentially interested into bringing business to this restaurant, with our professional network and on a private plan.
Well, this is NOT going to happen!
They offered us a nice table to sit at. We placed our food and drinks order. Then the waiter came back to us saying we had to leave because this was kind of a high-end table, and each of us would have to spend at least $200 if we wanted to stay there.
Let's have a quick maths lesson here: 10 people, $200 each. That makes $2,000 during a supposed happy hour time. Plus the place was empty, nobody was waiting for this table.
Anyway, $2,000. Now, let's have the ten of us coming back... Let's say at least 5 times a year, to be fair. With at least 2 other people each time. With an average ticket of about $75 per person. $11,250.
Dear manager, you just lost at least $9,250 within 15 minutes.

Funny enough he said he was nervous because when he comes to Denver I take him to super good places. 

We got there on a Thursday afternoon after the lunch rush. The server seemed very excited to have people who were ready to dine and drink wine. I can only imagine he was use to people rushing to get back to work. 

We had such a great experience and the food was amazing. We were there for several hours and just didn't want to leave. The ambiance was beautiful and we were able to enjoy the shaded patio. I love going in ethnic places and the staff still have their accents. It made me feel like there might have actually been Italians in the back cooking. 

In the end we were all debating over dessert. We finally decided on the creme brulee, but the server was so great he brought a second plate with samples of all the other desserts. That was the cherry on top of an amazing sunday. 

Would I go back? Definitely! Would I recommend it to others? I already have. I never knew that place was there when I lived in Las Vegas and now I'm sad I missed out.",tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,2,1,5,vdRO0r70_4wOzerLSwatHw

ever since nora's wine bar's sad closure, i've been desperately looking for a comparable replacement to their offerings.
ferraro's may cost a bit more but their ambience and service most definitely make the entire experience worthwhile.
from the moment we entered the restaurant, we felt as if we were being treated like royalty.
the hosts were friendly and welcoming, the servers were knowledgeable and attentive.
the live entertainment was great too - a very charming gentleman playing jazz and standards on the piano.

and the food!!!???
oh my.
an italian restaurant that hand makes all of their pasta?
yeah, i'm all about that!

my hubby ordered the osso bucco and it was falling apart on him.
tenderoni!!!
and the farro was delicious.

i had the sea bass.
each bite just melted in my mouth.
albeit, sea bass is difficult to overcook.

1 friend ordered the rigatoni polpette o salsiccia, another ordered the     spaghettini carbonara and another ordered the pappardelle mimmo.
the pastas were clearly handmade and hand cut as they were not all uniform in shape or size.
they were cooked perfectly al dente and the flavors were spot on.

desserts were delicious as well.
we had the tiramisu and creme brulee.

sure, it's not the cheapest of restaurants but it's definitely worth every penny.
all i know is that i'd much rather spend our hard earned money here than somewhere else like olive garden, macaroni grill or maggiano's.

if you're not willing to spend the money, just get a certificate from restaurant.com.
they also have a $10 lunch special.

Now they just make it too complicated.  It's only 50% off food and only certain items, not the specials.  No splitting checks.  They add a mandatory 18% gratuity.  No Restaurant.com certificates.  And no happy hour when opting for the 50% off deal.  The food is overpriced to begin with so 50% off just gets it down to a normal price.  

I've been here a few times for events and it takes them forever to set up and seat us.  And the last time I came for lunch on a Friday, it was almost completely dead and they seemed kind of perturbed that I was even there.

It has been more crowded when I've been there for dinner.  Occasionally, I've seen a live piano player there, which is a nice touch.  But it did make the place very loud.

We ordered the burrata appetizer, my husband got a salad, I had the bucatini, he had the rabbit, and we split a side of rapini. I had the pistachio dessert and he had death by chocolate.

I got a glass of prosecco after seeing there was a free glass of wine with yelp check in, and our server said great, I redeemed the offer, and she brought it out. (I was surprised later when it was on the bill, and she said it was her second day and she would need to ask. Then returned to tell me the offer didn't apply to anything but house red or white...okay, well that would have been good to know. Whatever...too late at that point.) 

The burrata was good, as was the sopressa, but there were only two very small slices of meat, 4 would have been more appropriate for the $18 price point, imo. 

The bucatini was very good, and I brought half home with me because I overheard the next table discussing the pistachio dessert, and decided that was happening.  The sauce was perfect, and the fresh pasta had an excellent texture. I noticed they had paleo pasta on the menu that I thought was interesting. 

My husband enjoyed his rabbit, though he thought the portion was a little small. 

Loved the rapini, it needed chopped or something because it was awkward to eat. 

We agreed I made the better dessert choice with the pistachio dessert. His death by chocolate was good but we both loved the pistachio. He ended up conning me out of over half of mine. 

Overall I would probably come back for happy hour, or dessert, but for the price (around $175) I think we could  have had an equal or more impressive dinner for much less $$, at another local place like Chef Marc's or Nora's, or on the strip at Giada.

The staff were really attentive, almost to the point though that it was uncomfortable - at any given time I felt like someone was watching us eat. Maybe it was just our table placement in the middle of the room, but it felt awkward.

2338817,2011-03-08,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"First of all, Ferraro's is located in a strip mall next door to a smoke shop. Because it's so close to the strip, there isn't a strict dress code. I saw customers walk in dressed in everything from Mickey Mouse sweatshirts and denim shorts to cocktail party attire.

Ferraro's is almost dead around 5:30PM on a Saturday but that doesn't mean the service is any faster. In fact, the service was outrageously slow.

I'm not one of those people who walks into a restaurant like Ferraro's and expects to be in and out in 30 minutes, but I would've liked for my visit to be under 2 hours considering it was just my husband and me and 75% of our time here was spent searching and waiting for our server.

It took at least 15 minutes just to get menus even though when we first arrived there were only two tables seated (including us). Our server was extremely friendly but we spent most of our meal sitting around and waiting for him to come back. It seemed as though the busser did all the work! I'm pretty sure the server forgot to bring our entrees when they were ready because the busser ended up bringing it out and it was almost room-temperature with cold, slimy and thick sauce as if it had been sitting out for a while. (We both ordered pasta.)

Our server never came and checked on us to see how the food was or if we needed anything else. Completely not even exaggerating-- he didn't even glance at us from the time he took our order to the time he came and dropped off a dessert menu (literally 20-25 minutes AFTER we had clearly finished eating).

THE FOOD: The portions are very small compared to many other Italian restaurants in the area. The temperature of the food was completely unacceptable and I would've said something except (as I've already indicated) we couldn't get our server's attention unless we wanted to cause a scene. 
I got the Gnocchi Zafferano and I usually love gnocchi but whatever I got tasted like the little dumplings in Campbell's Chicken & Dumplings soup. I asked my husband how his food was and he just shrugged and said, ""It's okay."" I tried a bite of his pasta and had the same kind of shoulder-shrug feeling. The food wasn't bad, it was just boring.

All in all-- I hope our server was just a bad apple or having a rough night because he was awful. The food was less than decent-- not even worth half its price. I definitely wouldn't recommend going to Ferraro's.",FycUYNTz4fswU8PE62Ybtg,3,1,2,4L6MI6wrW5iiWtI3zlDhDQ

I have to say great customer service from phone communications when I made the reservation and the restaurant following up with me. We also brought a bday cake, which they refrigerated for us during dinner. They brought it out with the candles I provided, had my son blow the candles, then brought the cake back and came out with plated slices for everyone. This was all done without an added fee. We've been to other restaurants where they charge you a high cake fee, which I think is quite ridiculous. Our servers were all very friendly and attentive. Most restaurants have you select from a very limited menu made for large groups. We didn't have to. They only do that for private events. I really appreciate that.

Gnocchi- one of the best gnocchis I have ever had. This is a must order whether you get an appetizer portion or as your dinner entree. It just melts in your mouth. The sauce is a light tomato sauce with basil which was perfectly seasoned. Get it!! (One person at our table got it with the bologna sauce instead. Fabulous in its own way!)

Octopus appetizer- This was one of their special appetizers of the night. It came prepared like a salad with really good olive oil, olives, fried capers and some herbs. Amazing dish, perfectly tender octopus. Simple to bring out the flavors of the dish. 

Branzino-yummmm, this Branzino was cooked perfectly. It was moist and seasoned lightly. Underneath was a sweet potato puree and on the sides were mushrooms cooked alongside figs. First time having it that way and it was a delicious combo. This was a very well prepared Branzino!

Seafood tagliatelle-again the seafood was cooked perfectly. You could taste it's freshness in the dish. You see a pattern here at this place, it's all good! 

Veal parmigiano- This dish came out prepared slightly different because Gianni said the octopus and following with this dish could crash the palate. So he had it prepared fried then a fresh tomato, arugula and truffle on top. Amazing!! So glad they love their food so much they recommend different ways to get it.

So for dessert, we wanted the crepes and a pistachio cream dessert, but couldn't decide. But guess what, no problem because Gianni will make it happen. He had them make a dessert sampler for us with those two options. Everything came plated separately for each of us like a sampler. You learn quickly that at Ferraros they make it happen. Or should I say Gianni can make it happen. Please ask for him to be your server, he will make your experience even better.

Here's a cool tidbit, Gianni also plays the drums in the band. So he take care of you and in between he plays drums. This place is so cool. We have now also decided we are going to stop here every time we are in Vegas. They really make you feel special here. 

Thank you Ferraros and thank you Gianni Montreal!",6_Z0-yY4HWz1bg7MwaZGrQ,3,3,5,BfULv8gCrtc-gOHWmDJAfA

Firstly, our server didn't look too happy and was totally out of it. We asked for a drink menu so he got it for us alright. He plopped a THICK drink menu and just left. No recommendations, no nothing. When we finally got his attention and asked for recommendations, his response was ""There's a table of contents here."" When we gave up, we ordered a bottle of house red cabernet sauvignon (which was still 60usd, so not cheap). As for the meal, we made it easy for the server, we each got the valentine menu (90USD, so not cheap again) even though the restaurant still offered their regular menu (which probably cost less too).

When the first plate arrived, presentation looked nice. So I was excited because at this point we were so hungry. However, I got excited too early. The food was cold as if it was sitting in the kitchen for awhile. First course, we ordered was the bone marrow. It  was tasteless; not seasoned well. Second course, the best course of all, was the lobster ravioli. This dish was salty but it had fresh chunks of lobster and at least it wasn't soggy. Third course was the medium rare steak. I'm a huge fan of steaks but this steak was so tough and chewy that I lost interest in it. Lastly, is the dessert. It is a trio but only one out of the three was yummy. 

Because the server was so out of it and our friends were in a rush to a show, we didn't say or complain about it. Since it was on Valentine's day, it was even more disappointing. I'm just glad the busser for our table that day was friendly. I do not understand how this restaurant has such a high rating. I recommend you to add a few bucks and eat at a celebrity chef or Michelin star/ Forbes rating restaurant. Sadly, in my opinion, this place is not worth wasting your calories on.

We arrived earlier than expected for our dinner reservations but were seated promptly. Service was perfect from water to dessert. Our server took her time explaining the specials, how they were prepared, she checked on us regularly and basically made us feel like we were her only customers, which we were not.
We started with the fried calamari which was perfect. For my entrée I chose the homemade gnocchi with pesto. My wife opted for the lobster ravioli. You sometimes forget how delicious and lite homemade pasta is... The pasta at Ferraro's is just that.

Ferraro's provided desert as we were celebrating a special occasion, which was very gracious of them. I capped off the dinner with an espresso and Sambuca, nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention their wine book, it's not a list. I'm kinda clueless when it comes to Italian wine but others have told me that their wine list is A++.

My wife ordered some chicken dish which was out of this world I've never had anything like that and I ordered some spaghetti with garlic and chili's again out of this world so so good.

To me, it's a hard combination to get right. When you go to a nice italian restaurant, you could very easily pay a lot of money for very basic plates, or, on the flip side, a *ton* of money for fancy bullshit California-italian-nouveau food. At Ferraro's, you can get a nice experience, atmosphere, and food that you'll never confuse for the Olive Garden or some chic LA pan-italian-fusion place.

Ambiance-wise, the place has low lighting, and can be very romantic, but can also work well enough for business or more casual meals. Service is usually excellent, and on most nights I've been there, Mimmo or Gino has been around saying ""Hi"" to people.

It's not particularly cheap, but it's not outlandishly expensive. If you avoid falling into a classical multi-course italian meal, your check will end up very reasonable. There are a lot of italian restaurants in Las Vegas where you can impress a girl, or overpay for a decent (at best) meal, but Ferraro's makes it possible to go to a nice place and get food on par with what you're paying.",21KWy-JENq6xVEly5xki0A,0,0,4,h4YgVgg8LtZFaDFvSQpzfA

The wine list is stellar, as well.

The restaurant, located in a strip mall across from the Hard Rock Hotel, is very classy, lots of dark woods. The Maître D'  and staff at the door were very polite. We sat in their outdoor seating area which has shrubs on the fencing blocking passerbys from bothering you. Our waiter was, Apollo, who was very attentive and answered any questions we had about the menu. We had the Calamari appetizer, lightly breaded, and Pasta with Seafood. The pasta is made fresh there and the seafood is flown in everyday. They also have a wonderful wine cellar and extensive wine menu! They have live music (great vocalist/musician) which can also be heard outside via speaker system. The prices are moderate to expensive but worth the visit, especially for any special occasion. **One word of caution if sitting outside! The restaurant is just north of the airport and if their using the North/South runway it can get noisy.

2833254,2015-05-09,2,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"So, my wife found out that they were going to be serving vitello tonnato for Mother's Day weekend. Since I've been searching for a place which offers it for the entire time I've lived in Vegas, I was happy to try it. I was so excited to go there last night.

First of all, our waiter, Virgilio, makes you feel like you're an old friend who came over to visit rather than a guest at a restaurant. You're instantly comfortable around him, and he's fun, he's engaging, and he's just a delight. He introduced us to Chef Mimmo, who is the one who decided to add my favorite food to their menu. 

And OH MY GOD it was good. It was just like being back in Italy. Absolutely delicious. If you've never had vitello tonnato, it sounds disgusting - veal with tuna, mayo, capers, and lemon? Why would you eat that? But, if you HAVE had it, you know that, when done right, it's quite possibly the nicest thing you could do to your mouth. Chef Mimmo hit it spot on. 

We also got the beef carpaccio as an appetizer. Delicious, heavy on the greens to give it a nice bitter taste. No disappointment there. 

My wife got the ossobuco. I got to sample a tiny taste of it, and it was fantastic. I would have sampled more of it, but the expression on her face led me to believe that would not be good for my health. An angrily placed fork in the eye tends to sour an experience. 

I had the fettuccine mare manzo. The mushrooms were amazing, the crab was cooked PERFECTLY. I would argue that the truffle oil was unnecessary in the dish, as there was already enough earthiness from the mushrooms. Other than that, though...

Lastly, we finished with the pistachio cream. Oh. My. God. It's just like my mother used to make. I didn't WANT to finish dessert, because I'm already fat enough, but a gun to my head wouldn't have gotten me to stop before I finished. 

Absolutely, go here. Yes, it's spendy. But worth it.",Io5GxWjhtxqiWnoA-6Fh-w,3,3,5,kUu859R0J6pmXB02ZAF6LQ

When we went to wash our hands before eating, there was no hot water in the restrooms. The attendant informed me that he was instructed to run it for a half hour, as an attempt to get the water hot. After asking a server for a manager, I was pointed in the direction of the owner. When i leaned into his ear to whisper that it was pretty disgusting that he had no hot water (I whispered because I am in the industry I know how embarrassing that this can be)  he responded by yelling ""There is nothing fu***** disgusting about my restaurant"" so loud, I was stunned by his volume and tone as I was just trying to help. I responded by saying I just wanted to let you know I cant properly wash my hands. He then asked me if I wanted to re-wash my hands and i said yes that would be great. As he stormed past me I followed, thinking he was leading me to a different area where the water was hot. Unfortunately he goes into the same bathroom, and while two customers are using the facility and another washing his hands , he screams  at the bathroom attendant! Saying ""I WANT THIS FU***** WATER RAN, RUN THE FU***** WATER!"" and then stormed out of the restroom never to be seen again. Unfortunately  this did not heat up the water as he intended. We had hand sanitizer so we decided to go ahead with our meal because it smelled amazing in the establishment. When my wife's gnocchi and my fettuccine came out I was surprised to find mushrooms were a major component to my dish. The menu did not say,or maybe I could not understand the Italian, but I am allergic to mushrooms. My loving wife offered to switch entrees with me. The gnocchi was good, and she loved the fettuccine. Unfortunately later that night my wife became violently ill. I am awfully curious as to if any foul play involved, but I am honestly more curious as to if the kitchen had hot water for dishes... were we eating off of clean plates?

So many Italians down there, so many good types of homemade pasta.  The gnocchi at Ferraro's is easily the best I have ever had that was not homemade, simply because it tasted homemade.  The sorbet?  To die for.  Truly, every single meal was spectacular, from pasta to steak to sea food.  The salads were delicious and not too large of portions, the wine was exquisite, and service was great.  From the moment we walked in we were well taken care of, the servers were friendly and helpful, and good at their jobs.  The head guy even stopped by to say hey, which was pretty awesome.

They have a huge wine list, over hundreds of wines to choose from. The food menu is quite large as well. The service was just so, so.

It should've been a dessert drink.

The bread basket was warm and we began with an appitizer sampler: 1) lobster ravioli with asparagus was my favorite thing I ate here. Luckily, the Mrs. doesn't eat seafood so I got hers, too. 2) Mushroom risoto was cooked al dente. Very good. 3) Sausage had spice. Very good. Then I got the scallop appetizer. It was perfectly seared and seasoned. I could've ended the meal there, but my main dish was brought out: Osso Bucco (The house specialty) $43.

I was a bit disappointed here. The meat was fall off the bone tender and beefy. It was the tomato based sauce that just didn't seem to go well with the meat. I like my braised meats with garlic & rosemary, so I ate the rosemary garnish with it. I did eat the bone marrow on the bread. That was extremely rich. The barley side was kinda bland, but a plenty. I tried my wife's filet. It was kinda tough and dry. Nothing special.

The tiramisu was perfection, but it was way too small. I make mine from scratch, so I'm used to giving myself bigger slices. This was about half the size of a deck of cards. I recently read that the owner comes in everyday and personally makes the Tiramisu though. 

Limoncello was STRONG. I could only take a few sips and gave it to others who could handle it.

Overall, I did enjoy it because it was FREE!",j5kD6MSrT63G2i6q9P2eaQ,0,0,4,dPwdXe-InV6hswKgufxbSQ

The risotto with black truffle was unbelievable. They also offered ""white"" truffle on any dish for an additional $50. Not cheap, I know.

The service was impeccable from the minute you walk in. The staff look like they stepped out of a Al Pacino move.. I mean that in a good way by the way...

The ambiance and the vibe were so up beat that just looking at their menu mad my mouth water. They make all their own pasta fresh, wow no Chef Ragu/Prego working there..

We ordered the antipasti appetizer. It was filled with different kinds of cheese, olives, pickled artichokes, prosciutto, spicy ham. I'm not a fan of olives but the red ones weren't all that bad. It was really good and pair that up with the bread they bring you at the table and you practically have your meal right there. But better save some room for your dinner because you have to try their pasta dishes. I ended up ordering the seafood spaghetti meal that had scallops, huge pieces of shrimp and calamari. I admit it was good but a little too much on the seafood. My BF had the Sea Bass and it was really melt in your mouth type of meal. The fish was cooked to perfection! 

I would have given them five stars but I wasn't that crazy about my meal but I am more than willing to go back for more and possibly change it.

Highly suggest this restaurant when in Vegas. It's located behind the Hard Rock Hotel off of Paradise in shopping center that has CVS in it.

First the Good : nice atmosphere, welcoming staff, and Great service. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The quality of the food was above average, seems they make there pasta in house. the tomato sauce was very tasty and fresh and the meatball was light and flavorful. Now the bad : in my opinion. First the portion size for the Happy Hour menu is very small. $8 for a burrata and tomato salad. Two small wedges probably 2 ounces served with 4 tomato slices. Next up spaghetti  and meats ballS on the menu it states the plural with the S in meatballs in reality you are serve a small portion of pasta which was undercooked ( being a foodie I know the texture of al dente and this was crunchy pasta with on golfball size meatball. The menu also states bread with a pesto type oil is $4 however is complimentary if you order other items with it. They charged us anyway and stated you must order off  the dinner menu to receive comp bread even though it is listed on the happy hour menu. The drinks for happy hour are 25% off however they are overpriced to start with.

I'm not crazy about vinaigrettes to begin with, so when it was only sparsely on the mixed greens, I wasn't thrilled, but I was hungry after an afternoon of libations at the pool, so I ate up.  

The entree on the other hand, that's another story.  De-lic-ious.  The meatballs tasted like the ones I remember from my Italian, great-grandmother's kitchen; the sauce wasn't over powering or under-seasoned--simply perfect; and the noodles were cooked just right.  The portion was satisfactory as well.

Our waitress was delightful.  Polite and attentive, but not pandering for tips.  Just a doll (I wish I could remember her name, but I do know she work's the bar and has a tattoo on each inside wrist, so look for her next time you're there).

Dinner entrees were the 8 oz Filet Mignon, Osso Bucco and Dover Sole.
The filet was tender, juicy and cooked as requested, well done butterfly.

Osso Bucco is a house specialty and this time was ordered with polenta instead of faro. This is one of the best brazed veal shanks in Las Vegas. The polenta served on the side was nice and creamy. One word describes the marrow -Yum.

Dover Sole was de-boned table side and served with a warm butter sauce. Several wonderful light savory pieces of fish. The entree included several tiny whole red potatoes. The Dover Sole was a special this night and should not be missed when available. 

A shared dessert of Tiramisu was as good as it gets. It had a perfect balance of flavors and was served on a plate with drizzled chocolate. The perfect finale to an excellent dinner. 

Our wine pairing was a wonderful bottle of Oregon Pinot Noir.  It was a great complement to the entrees. This Pinot Noir has a scent of ripe strawberries with a mild overlay of lees. Its flavors stay in the red fruit spectrum.

Let me back up for a moment so we can put this review into context: I JUST arrived home after a fun very ""Vegas-y"" trip to Vegas and despite how tired I am, I just HAD to write about my experience at Ferraro's. Yes. It was that good.

First, the restaurant is beautiful. It is large and open with dining rooms branching off from a gorgeous and inviting bar area (which is framed by their impressive wine vault!)

We started by having a cocktail in the bar where both the drinks and the service were fantastic. 

We sat and started the somewhat painful process of narrowing down our menu selections to a handful of items. Everything both on the regular menu and the specials sounded great (they even managed to make tripe sound appetizing) but we settled on a burrata with proscuitto for a started and the buccatini and mushroom risotto for our ""secondi."" The buratta some of the best I've ever had and all three of us finished our risotto and pasta as they were both so flavorful with layers upon layers of depth of flavor. 

Main course was a seabass on the special menu and I fear I've run out of adjectives (be nice- I did just return from Vegas!) to describe how fantastic it was. Ethereal and perfectly cooked in texture with a light and flavorful white wine reduction. 

I could wax poetic about their vast wine selection for hours. Some of the bottles they have- and reasonably priced, I might add - you'd be challenged to find anywhere else in Vegas or even the western U.S. ENORMOUS Italian wine collection and the owner and staff are available and well-versed in their offerings and can guide you to the perfect selection. The only thing I'd change, and this is such a small little gripe, I'd love to see more Argentine wines on the menu as I think they could fit with the food so nicely!

Yes, it's off the strip- TAKE A CAB! You will want to drink enough wine to challenge the legal limit without a doubt. It's worth the journey and I doubt there will ever be another trip to Vegas, no matter how short, where I won't make a point to eat here. The place is magical in a way so few restaurants can achieve.",8TYNR25ifvwrwYcyKNx1BQ,1,1,5,RXImZcDtVhKf3C5TmwcZpQ

We sat at the bar and had lively service from the two bartenders. The atmosphere is very classy and elegant without being stuffy. The food is delicious! I had the sweet potato gnocchi off of the vegan menu (love that they have vegan options). I also had a glass of Merlot after the bartender made a couple recommendations and had me taste a couple of their reds. 

Definitely a great spot to escape the hustle of the casinos and have a more intimate, upscale experience. Prices are fairly high but not exorbitant, they fit with the overall atmosphere.",_qENy6tpHQP024U82hkLYw,2,2,5,PpM7LWQ_S9B6jhyWtr2EKQ

For $14 total after tax, you are able to choose from 3 different lunch special entrees and house soup or salad.  I went with the pasta with short rib and mushroom and the house salad.  The mealbegan with some fresh bread, which was solid Italian bread with great accompanied oil.  The starter salad had fresh ingredients and flavorful dressing.  Very good portioned for a lunch as well.  The pasta dish was fantastic.  3 separate types of mushrooms were included and the rib had a ncie spice to it.  The pasta was outstanding and prepared perfectly.  

No wonder Ferraro's has been a staple in Las Vegas for so long.  There's a nice outdoor seating area if the weather is nice, the wait staff is great.  The restaurant seems like an ideal choice for an affordable yet delicious business meal as well.  And they have nice lunch and Happy Hour deals until 7pm.

The first course was fish, Chef prepared Salmerino Alphino--a wonderful Arctic char (a cross between salmon and trout, fresh cold water fish) in two methods. A sashimi style and a chopped with green apple bits. The dish was very fresh, light and very delicious.  Wine pared was a clean, dry Pinot Grigio 2015, which was excellent.    The next course was Insalata Di Granchio--a lemon and olive oil marinated lump crab salad, with a selection of delicate vegetables and flowers.  This was pared with a crisp and refreshing Fattoria Sardi Rosato 2015. The pasta course Parppardelle al Cinghiali--was a very hearty homemade wide noodles with a fabulous wild boar and vegetable ragu with pecorino cheese.  Very enjoyable and this was pared with Blue Label Chianti Classico DOCG 2012, almost a pinot style wine, this had the black cherries and spiciness but a great mildness to it.  The last course was Cervo in Crosta--hazelnut encrusted venison loin--done to perfection and very tender--with porcini mushrooms and a hearty rainbow chard.  This course was great and the wine pared was a hearty, complex Chianti Classico Riserva 2012.  The food was excellent and the wines were very enjoyable, another great time of learning about the Italian wines and food.  Thank you Ferrero's had a fabulous time.

3358459,2015-11-18,3,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Long wait for the table. Very slow service. We waited approximately 10 minutes to be greeted. I expected more from a restaurant that is open for 30 years. They featured a 4 course meal for $30.30 in celebration of their 30th anniversary but the menu was a big disappointment. Appetizers were good. The mini baguette was very good. The intermediate course, a house salad was the most rustic and an item that should not be in a fine dining restaurant, mixed greens tossed in an over acidic balsamic vinaigrette. The Lasagna was mediocre, you can even see the comparison with other pictures on Yelp, they hold the garnish to save some pennies. The dessert was nothing special, a small piece of tiramisu and a hard to eat cannoli. 
The wine list is super over priced. I was looking for a good value Barbera or Langhe Nebbiolo for about $50 dollars but it was a mission impossible. They have the most expensive Italian wine list I've ever seen. If you can afford Gaja and Masseto this might be your place.
I am sure there are a lot of great Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas Strip to try. 
The owner is famous for his hospitality, however we sat in the waiting area for 50 minutes waiting for our table with our baby and he never came by even to say hi.

It is made with Homemade 30 yolks Taglierini pasta  with sea urchin and a ginger carrot sauce. It was perfect! Highly recommend. I was super nervous as I've only had sea urchin in sushi, but I wanted to be a little adventurous... It was totally worth it! So good. 

The waiter also chose a selection of deserts for us. The Amaretto Pistachio cookie was my favorite. This is definitely a great place for a nice meal but also perfect if you want to impress someone. They also have a very extensive and impressive wine list. Don't be intimidated!

3398472,2014-06-16,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Ferraro's is getting a solid 3 stars from me.

The restaurant is decked out in nice rustic Italian fashion with dim lighting and white table cloths. My party and I arrived about 10 minutes earlier than our reservation slot, but we were seated immediately anyway.

As per the norm of most Italian restaurants, warm bread was brought to the table in a basket covered with a napkin. Brought along with the fresh bread was a ramekin filled with a delicious concoction of what I believed to be olive oil, a bit of roasted garlic, and perhaps a hint of pesto. For appetizers we went with the calamari fritti (fried calamari) which was adorned with a lemon and marinara topped with red pepper flakes. Overall the calamari was mediocre, in my opinion.

For my entree I went for the Bucatini Corti all'Amatriciana. A $24 plate of thick, but hollow bucatini noodles topped with Italian bacon, onions, red wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes. I've had variations of this dish in the past but this particular one did not rank up near the top with the others. Don't get me wrong, I knew exactly what I was getting into with my order however for the price I was expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately, I was not. I am making a general assumption in that the dish prices are predicated upon the restaurant's proximity to the strip, and I am certain the cost of the bacon is something to take note of.

The waitstaff certainly deserved 5 stars. Friendliness, knowledge of the menu, and attentiveness were definitely their strong suits that evening. I did feel bad for the bussers who had to constantly refill the tiny water glasses in front of us, but I suppose I could've just asked for a larger glass.",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,3,2,3,cyEtK7H0NFQYlW7aYV3QPQ

Our party of four adults (and two kids) ate family-style, which was a great way to sample several dishes. The carpaccio ($14) was well seasoned and topped with arugula and shaved parmigiano. The star of the scallop dish ($16) was a delicious chiffonade of brussel sprouts with pancetta and pine nuts. The two scallops lacked a good sear.

Following the two apps was a hearty gnocchi dish ($28) topped with plenty of slices of grilled chicken and heavily doused with pesto. The risotto aragosta e tartufo nero ($36) was rich and creamy, but the lobster was slightly overcooked.

The filet ($42) was as tender as expected and topped with roasted peppers, mushrooms, and onions and accompanied by potatoes, broccoli and carrots. The rib eye ($48) had a bold, beefy taste and was nicely charred.

They don't have a kid's menu, but willingly prepared grilled chicken breasts and buttered penne pasta for the two kids ($10 each)

The six dishes provided plenty of food for the adults, but we still managed to down two desserts. The tiramisu ($12) was beautifully presented -- a large square of creamy goodness that didn't have an overpowering taste of espresso. Finally, we had the white chocolate Montenegro creme brûlée ($12). The best part of a creme brûlée is cracking the caramelized sugar coating and this one didn't disappoint as the exterior yielded a delicious custard underneath. Although the white chocolate flavor was too subtle for my liking.

For a Sunday night the place was busy. The interior is upscale with it's white linens, dark wood accents and classic vibe. It's fit for a date night, power lunch, or just a fun night out with friends if you're looking for something that isn't too casual.

It was 11:30 pm on a Saturday and we were trying to find something to eat other than fast food or bar bites.  Ferraro's had the best late-night menu I've ever encountered. I was expecting some Italian comfort food (spaghetti, lasagna, you know the type) and instead they offered first-class, authentic mediterranean cuisine.  I had the sea bass (branzino) and my friend had the calebresi.  The food was absolutely delicious and of completely unexpected quality again because of the late hour.  

The environment was perfect for either a romantic date in the dining area, a group dinner, or just grabbing a glass of wine at their bar.  I had the house white, which was a more than generous portion.  Toward the end of our evening, the manager, who appeared to be on a first-name basis with several of the other customers, brought us out a complimentary plate with cannoli and tiramisu.  Our total price for the night, including salads, 2 entrees, and wine was only $70- half of what I would expect for such an excellent meal for dinner.  

4 stars instead of 5 since service was a bit slow, but it was also extremely busy and there were only 2 bartenders, so that's understandable.

Fritto Misto:  just like what we had in Northern Italy.  Fried calamari, shrimp, sardines, endives and some red pepper was served with a creamy tangy dipping sauce.  Simple but delicious.

Caesar salad:  Whole leaves tossed with parmesan and a creamy light anchovy dressing.  The side order of anchovies was plentiful.

Bolognese:  Ground beef in tomato base with al dente green & white taglatelle.  Delicious!

Tarajin with Crab and corn in a creamy uni sauce:  The only time I've had tarajin was in Alba during tartufo season last year.  The pasta is exactly the same (made with 30 egg yolks)!  It was delicious.  I loved it paired with the house pinot grigio.  Only negative?  I wanted fresh truffles!

Romantic and cozy ambience
Out of the hustle and bustle
Private lot to park in
Nice bar area
Welcoming hosts and waitstaff
Decent wine selection
Friendly and attentive service
Modern & clean restrooms
Delicious food

The highlight of the night and the reason to return, is Ferraro's fall of the bone and melt in your mouth Osso Buco. They compliment it with the creamiest most delish risotto on the side. To die for!!!!!!! After a yummy salad there is hardly any room for desert unless you take it to go.  

My husband tried the house lasagna. Now let me preface this by telling you that ALL lasagna dishes at restaurants have stiff competition to overcome. My mother-in-law's amazing sauce takes 2 days to make. When you combine that with real fall off the bone meat and layers of various cheeses and fresh pasta you have the most incredible flavor sensations in every bite.  Honestly, it's hard for restaurants to even compete.

Having said all that it was decent lasagna, but I think he was jealous of my Osso Buco and it was just too good to share more than a bite or two! he he he

3818170,2015-12-14,3,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I love Italian food, and had been craving pasta for several days.  When I checked into my hotel I searched for Italian restaurants close by. Ferraro's immediately popped up.  I noticed that they had happy hour until 7 PM.  Perfect.  I was greeted by both the hostess and server.  I looked over the menu and asked for the wine list.  None of the pasta dishes on Happy hour were served without meat, so I ordered off of the regular menu ($25-$70). The wine I had planned to order was not recommended, so I went with one several dollars more per glass.  

The salad and bread arrived quickly, and were very good.  I sat without the pasta dish I had ordered for 40 minutes after the salad was cleared.  I wasn't looking for something super fast, but the wait was excessive. I ordered another glass of wine while waiting. I probably wouldn't have ordered a second had my meal arrived in less time.  When the server passed by half way through the second glass she noticed the pasta hadn't arrived.  She admitted she had forgotten to put in the order. Things happen.  It arrived a few minutes after she noticed.  

Having been in the service industry for close to 30 years there would normally be a comped glass of wine or something for the wait.  No.  Full price.  While the service (except for the forgotten order) and food were good, it would seem that they would try to make things right at a family owned restaurant.  I don't have an issue with dropping over $50 or more on dinner. However, this was not what I expected to spend for happy hour. Especially since the restaurant is in a strip mall. Overall I spent an hour and a 45 minutes as a solo diner in the bar waiting for a two course meal.

Even if I had planned on having a regular priced dinner, the entree prices were at least 25% higher than they needed to be, though the food was good. I would most likely take a cab elsewhere next time, or grab a sandwich or slice by the hotel.  Las Vegas has many great restaurants, and I'm here on a regular basis.

3835159,2014-06-15,2,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"We made a reservation for Valentine's day and even showed up 30 minutes early to ensure we got a table. The place was practically empty around 6 p.m. so we tarried by the bar. I ordered a vodka martini and my boyfriend got a scotch neat so we can't say much about the quality of the cocktails. The bartender didn't offer us recommendations or selections, much less talk, so this might not be one of those places to strike up a conversation.

Food: Excellent. We started with a charcuterie plate of cheeses and cured meats. Nothing fancy or worth stating. It was pretty plain: a plate of meats and cheeses. For dinner, I had a lobster ravioli and my boyfriend got steak. The pasta was al dente and lobster was just right. The sauce wasn't heavy or too light either. Finished up with some creme brûlée which wasn't stellar, but good for flamed custard. 

Service: Up to par. Since it was Valentine's day, the restaurant got busier later in the evening. However, this did not diminish our server's presence nor her service. She gave us a wine menu and suggested pairings which I appreciate because sommeliers can be nerve-racking if you don't know your wines. 

Overall: It might've been the wine talking, but I enjoyed myself. The food was lovely and my mouth waters thinking about the lobster ravioli. 

Less one star because booths and tables are really close. Upscale Italian? Meh. It felt like an Olive Garden on steroids. Less kitschy Italian homeware replicas, but still that sort of faux interior facade.

3843105,2008-07-26,2,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I came here on my company's dime for a dinner with the execs and sales people during a weekend at a tradeshow.  When I heard Ferraro's was off the Strip, I rejoiced because it was nice getting out of that scene; at the same time, I thought wtf are we going???  When we pulled into the strip mall and spied the ""massage parlor"" again I thought wtf are we going?  However as soon as we walked in my concerns were put to rest.

The atmosphere was cozy and romantic, darkly lit with a small trio playing music.  Not too small and not too large, like Goldilocks said just right.  The staff at Ferraro's was great, being that we were a party of 25 at 8PM on a Friday which is a nightmare for a restaurant you're not expecting much but everyone was quite gracious. The servers took their time to tailor their suggestions for what everyone was looking for, whether it was more information about a particular wine or suggestions for appetizers.  

Food and wine were delicious, well from what I saw and heard from my fellow diners.  I didn't taste what was on everyone else's plates (cuz um yea I'm not going to ask the CEO if I can try his osso bucco), but my food was delicious.  I took a different direction from my co-workers and went with the ribeye, cooked medium with rapini.  When my plate came to the table everyone else got a lil bug eyed because it really was quite large.  My hunger got the best of me though and after being up for 12 hours at the tradeshow I inhaled my steak which was perfectly cooked with a warm reddish pink center and charred on the outside just like I like it.  Rapini was a bit bitter and could have used more garlic but hey who cares about that with a delicious steak.

I have no idea how much dinner would have been, but if I was to come to Vegas again and wanted a change of pace from what you can find on the strip I'd definitely come here again.",TmePGlLL1LWQgYoybuftCg,2,2,4,hMgiRzEtUhR7aacl_1dCtA

I used the Yelp Check In coupon for a free appetizer.  Instead of being allowed to chose an appetizer from the menu the waiter brought us a small serve of spaghetti bolognese and one ravioli to share.  The food tasted bland.

I ordered the scallop dish which comprised of only 4 scallops for $29.00 with some crunchy bits of tiny chopped veges underneath.

The highlight of the meal was the salad, insalata mimmo, which was very flavorful but I didn't come here for salad!

Because the restaurant was less than half full on a holiday weekend the wait staff circled the table relentlessly like flies looking for crumbs.  They totally lacked a sense of acuity and were intrusive which took away from the dining experience.

By the way, the small parking lot was full but I was able to find a parking spot without too much trouble.

I was in the mood for a light dinner and headed to the strip mall where Ferraro's is located.  I entered and was immediately floored by the prices.  They do realize they are in a filthy strip mall, sharing space with a Piercing Emporium and a shady looking massage parlor?
I was by myself and, although there were tables in the dining room, the hostess clearly wanted me to sit in the bar, so I followed her there. 
She asked me if I needed the wine list, but I did not; I then sat for SIX minutes, no menu, no drink, no food, no bread, nothing.  Doesn't sound like such a long time but when you are hungry, it seems like FOREVER.  Maybe they were hoping I would leave??
I eventually placed my order and a bread basket came.  My server was courteous but semed a little distracted, subtly implying that she had bigger and better tables to get to.  She was helpful with menu choices and I placed my order.  The bread basket arrived and fairly quickly my salad arrived.  I had a chopped salad which was a delicious blend of iceberg lettuce, black olives, Italian meats and a light oil and vinegar based dressing - very good!  Unfortunately, I stumbled on my next order, you see, several of the items (pasta, pizzetes, etc) had both Italian sausage and BEANS on them. My server explained that this was due to the chef's Tuscan influence. When I ordered the pizzete, she recommended the white pizza ( blend of garlic and cheeses) but I went with the Pizzete Toscani with the aforementioned sausage and beans.  Bad choice.  It was neither tasty nor appetizing.  Food 2/5, service 4/5, 3/5 stars overall.",3XIe46L4_ucO__bW970I6g,0,0,3,Wxc58EMW0XoERI4Gv5sHfQ

3946662,2010-05-17,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I've got a bone to pick.

I had always heard rave reviews about Ferraro's, but just never made it.  I guess it's that everyone says that Ferraro's Osso Buco is THE best.  For me, when I see Osso Buco on the menu, that is what I get.  I love the stuff and would eat it every day if I could.  But, I also don't want to be disappointed, as I've had waaay to many  bad instances.

Let's start with the wines.  After much discussion with our waiter, who either was very knowledgeable or was pushing stuff the restaurant hasn't been able to get rid of (I do give him the benefit of the doubt and think he was quite educated), he recommended the 2003 Palari Faro.  I hadn't even heard of the grape, let alone the region it comes from.  It was enlightening and tasted pretty good, too.  For a second bottle, I ordered the 2001 Pio Cesare Barbaresco.  This was a relative bargain on the wine list.  Over all, I have to rate our server pretty high for his expertise and ability to navigate the list.  Where I have to subtract is from the wine service itself.  While our glasses were never empty (definitely a good thing), our server continuously poured wine to top us off.  It felt rushed.  I would have liked to see the bottom of my glass at least once.

Anyway, I'll skip to the food...that IS why you're reading this, right?  We order three appetizers:  (1) Carpaccio Torcello, which is basically beef carpaccio - the color and texture exude freshness, like it definitely wasn't sitting pre-sliced in the cooler for days (like at some other places).  It was good; however, it just didn't have enough beef flavor for my taste.  (2)  Carpaccio di Tonno (tuna carpaccio) - this was really fresh and the accompanying salsa-looking mixture was refreshing.  The tuna itself had a nice crust that gave the tuna an earthy aroma and flavor.  (3) Burrato, Proscuitto, Rucola - this was like a salad with melted mozzarella and proscuitto.  Interesting mix of crunchy, creamy and chewy.  Good stuff and my favorite of the three.

For dinner we had the...Osso Buco.  All three of us.  The shank was nicely tender, which is where too many places fail miserably.  IMHO, it could have been a little more moist, but soaking the bites in the sauce definitely made up for that.  The sauce was really nicely done and very balanced: it was rich but not overwhelming, it wasn't salty but had good flavor and, most importantly, it did not counteract with the wines.  Impressively done.  The grains on the side (I can't remember what it was called) were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle and was a nice complement in texture to the rest of the dish.  

Ah, but how can I end the review without mentioning the bone marrow?  I picked that bone dry.  It was buttery and fatty and just was astounding with the flavor of the sauce.  My companion never ate marrow before, but convinced him to give it a try.  While I don't think he's completely hooked, I did see him picking a lot of marrow out of that bone.",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,3,1,4,onWuBntxjZByHcwLlDlrew

Shortly after being seated, we were brought drinks and we took awhile to peruse the menu to agree on the items we all wanted to try.  We were brought a bread basket with ciabatta and focaccia.  We then ordered the following:

House made meatball with a fried stick of polenta and a rice ball
Imported Italian meats and cheeses
Spicy eggplant
Risotto with Italian arborio rice, tomato, ricotta cheese, black olive powder
Pesto gnocchi
Capellini puttanesca
Artichoke spaghetti with caviar and cinnamon
House made ravioli filled with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, light tear-drop tomato sauce
Tripe in spicy tomato sauce
Osso buco with farro
Farm raised rabbit with sautéed spinach
Flourless chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and strawberries
tiramisu

Noting we were sharing dishes, the house opted to serve our appetizers and initial four pastas on separate plates with a small serving of each.  The imported meat and cheese plate on the menu as affettati e formaggio was outstanding with a good selection of meats and cheeses.  Along with this, the off menu item, sliced eggplant was excellent.  

We then moved to the pastas.  The risotto was not cooked enough and was chewy.  The pesto gnocchi and house made ravioli with spinach, ricotta, mascarpone, and mortadella were the standouts.  The puttanesca was also good.  A fifth pasta was brought, an interesting and very tasty spaghetti with artichoke, caviar, cinnamon, and brown butter.  I never expected cinnamon and pasta to be together but it worker very well with the butter and caviar.

For the main course items, the peppery tripe and osso buco were excellent.  Their menu notes that the tripe is ""awesome"" which it is.

We finished with two desserts--a flourless chocolate cake and chocolate mousse with strawberries.  This was OK but we ordered one more dessert--tiramisu.  It was excellent.  Soft in texture and not overrun with alcohol, this was a perfect ending, along with a double espresso over ice--to a very delightful two and a half hour dinner with good friends.

Service was excellent during the meal.  The individual plating of some of our dishes made sharing easy but sometimes the food appeared lost on the very large plates.  During the second half of the meal, the servers opened the extenders on four sides of the round table so we had more room.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,14,4,OTrUw1OIReL5y3R3WiYn-g

If you are looking to go to to this restaurant on the weekend, I would highly recommend making a reservation because they do tend to get pretty busy. 

Gluten Free: Offer a variety of gluten free options and also offer paleo and Vegan options!

We ordered a few food items including two ginormous charcuterie boards. Arancini, meatballs, Margherita pizza,    and calamari.  The olives, mushrooms etc. on the charcuterie were drenched in oil. Not a fan.  The pizza was very tasty and I would order it again.  Those meatballs were very bland and tasted like some frozen Trader Joe's.  Big bummer because I love a good meatball.

Somewhat gaudy room, live band doing mediocre covers of pop hits, a magician (!) going table to table doing tricks, and a slightly hyper waiter who wildly exaggerated how wonderful everything was going to taste. I expected to see Dean Martin and Joey Bishop at the next table.  The food was . . . fine, but no better than that.. Fried calamari were an unremarkable rendition of the traditional appetizer, but a bright spot was the marinara sauce for dipping, which tasted fresh and with a good balance of fruit and acid. A buccatini with meat sauce was less interesting -- seemed a bit under-seasoned to me. Veal piccata was a pretty good rendition of that classic, but could have used a little less butter and little more lemon and caper flavor -- it lacked a certain zing. The pricing was very reasonable.

Just off Strip, opposite to the Hardrock Hotel we found this place. Of course through Yelp ;). After burgers, pub food and more of that kind during our three weeks of travelling through the USA I craved for real Italian. Not Americanised (don't no if that's a correct word), but real European. And besides the size of the portions (real American) it came very close. And if one thing stood out is was our waiter Eric.

Eric surprised us with his charme, his knowledge and suggestions on the food but most of all with his timing. In all the years in the USA it was the first time we didn't feel rushed and met someone who almost filled in all our needs. Even realizing that we probably needed a cab to get back he arranged one. And detail that probably wasn´t influenced by Eric, whe never had such a nice cab driver =).

We we're welcomed with an Yelp appetizer (for checking in) that consisted of Angnolotti and spaghetti. Nice, but so much that we almost regreted ordering an appetizer. Which of course was also big. Glad we shared the charcuterie & cheeses. My love had the rabbit as a main course and I the Angnolotti. Both nice, but with the peperonata and side order of spaghetti way, way to much. Drank lovely wine with it, enjoyed the espresso. All together a beatifull night. And I believe we paid somewhere in the range of $150.

Oh, and don't forget to check-out the bathrooms. And bring some tipping money. They deserve it.

The evenings specials were all unique to the original menu. I went with the 20 ounce rib eye and the gf went with the Chilean Sea Bass. The steak was cooked to perfection and the side of rustic potatoes were crispy thru the end. 

I tried her sea bass, and I can honestly say that it was the best fish dish I've had in my life. The fish had salty roasted peppers on the side and it perfectly complimented the delicate fish. It was literally melting in my mouth. My steak was perfect, but I could not stop eating her Chilean Sea bass. 

The service was one of the best I have ever experienced. I am not just saying this because the food so good it blinded me. The service was really top notch.

Our waiter, the older bald gentleman, sorry I can't remember his name. Was really attentive and genuine with his speech. He wasn't over bearing or overly friendly to the point where it annoying. Straight to the point and very prompt with everything. 

I been to  masteros and it is one of the most pretentious places on the planet. I am pretty sure masteros gave my gf a usda choice cut of steak and charged us for prime because they thought we are young and wouldn't notice the difference. I have a feeling a lot of high end restaurants do this. They have cheaper cuts on the side for suckers that they think won't notice the difference.

Our server was great! He was full of suggestions and had a great attitude and smile, but not too in your face. Very professional. 

I ordered the Osso Buco. I was so happy to hold my baby marrow fork! It was delicious, inside and out. My friend had the bucatini, which was exploding with fresh flavours. The pasta was freshly made in-house, and you can definitely tell. Bravo. We finished off with tiramisu, even though the entrees were so filling. Glad we did because it was divine.

The bread was delicious and they killed the dipping oil. So good and my table mates kept asking for more. In fact, they all pretty much scraped their lunch special plates. 

My salmon was amazing. Light and perfectly cooked and the vegetables were tender but not mushy with a nice lemon sauce. I am glad that I went with that lunch as I did not want to carbo load up. I was nervous but pushed through those tummy flutters because it was so good!

Restaurant is much bigger than it appears on the outside.  Host staff were extremely friendly, and made us feel special from the moment we walked in.

I don't know if I should start with food or service because both were beyond excellent. We had a reservation and we were promptly seated upon arrival. Our waiter greeted us quickly and he gave a nice overview of the menu options. He informed us that the restaurant actually makes all of their pasta.

We started with the pesto gnocchi and risotto caprese. I've never been so impressed with pasta. The gnocchi was so delicate and the pesto so creamy and flavorful. I didn't think I liked risotto, but now I realize I'd just never had it prepared well. The next course was salad. I had the Ferraro salad which had an Earthy flavor. My husband loved his caesar salad. For the entrees, I had the ossobucco and my husband had the chicken parmesan. The ossobuco was so tender and flavorful. I loved the sauce that surrounded it as well. As good as my occobuco was, I think my husband's chicken parmesan was even better. Lastly, we had a sampler of a cannoli and tiramisu. The cannoli was really good with a slightly sweet taste and the shell was something I could eat alone it was so good. The tiramisu was have a moment good. Yum!

The service is deserving of its own note. It's obvious that the restaurant has made great service a priority and dedicated time to training to achieve this. The staff is very attentive. Our water glasses never went below half a glass, with each course a gentlemen with parmesan and black pepper appeared and the way plates were placed in front of us was very deliberate and polite.

We were sat and was offered a book of their wines and drinks. We asked our server (I forgot his name because he was never around) to give us a minute to decide what to order. He came back and we were struggling what to order because I was unfamiliar of authentic Italian food. We then decided to get their appetizer combo, which are: shaved carrots with mozzarella, grilled octopus and beef tartar. After ordering, we were given pieces of bread, no utensils or napkins, I even had to get the attention of one of their bussers.. don't understand why are they not being attentive to their guests and needs.. anyway, we also ordered two drinks which are the Mediterranean mule and blood orange martini, (ALSO TOOK 15 mins to come) our food came and we were surprised that we got one of each of the appetizers because our server didn't bother explaining that it is not shareable and both guests are getting the same thing. Mozzarella with carrots was so bland, grilled octopus was just too oily and the beef tartar is just a slice of meat and some leaf... VERY DISAPPOINTED! We were so unhappy and frustrated that we couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant!! We were supposed to order an entree and dessert but we both totally lost our appetite. We asked for our check and our server asked if there was anything wrong because he can see that our food was barely touched and eaten. I then, explained to him that we did not like the food at all and all he did was shake his head and say awww... IM SORRY ABOUT THAT.... we spent 75$ for 2 combo appetizers and 2 drinks and our server didn't even try to make us feel better, because if this happened in other restaurant, the food would've been comped or we were asked if there is anything else we would like... thanks to the amazing employees for making our 4th anniversary the MOST MEMORABLE ANNIVERSARY yet!!! NEVER EVER GOING TO RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHER PEOPLE.. DONT EVEN BOTHER. I don't ever leave such bad reviews but our time spent here was a waste, money down the drain SO we are never coming back. 

Our dinner was at 7:30 today (MAY 22,2017) in the patio. I don't know the server's name, I hope next time you can make your guests happy and have a memorable night with great food and experience.",ucPpBTbZuOACb_xHDVHX8w,1,0,1,TtKIayggAt-NCotchxXC8w

Then received a free risotto and ravioli appetizer which was so tasty I just wanted more. I opted for the osso buco which was more than incredible and my gf had the scoglio which she informed me was also fantastic we decided to try the beef Manzo appetizer and it was superb will deff be making more trips here in the future very attentive staff warm romantic decor.,k5XFyzSbP1yW2nXkrh6ZCw,1,0,5,xYmhOsCArvcFmNTDAbYxZg

4659827,2015-12-15,2,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"This review is late but definitely needed.

Let me start be saying I adore Ferraros- the food and staff have always been awesome. Until this visit for the 30th anniversary...

Super deal on a 4 course meal- $30 and change! Awesome!

Called to make a reservation ahead of time letting them know we wanted to do the happy hour and the anniversary special and would like to be seated accordingly- the gal who took the reservation said no problem.

Checked in for the res the night of and they put our table on the dining side where you can't order from the happy hour menu. Talked to the hostess about the reservation and she said it'd be a 20 min wait. At this point, fine. We'll just wait at the bar until they figure this out.

A friend had a $100 gift card and bought our first round of drinks! Awesome! Well by the time she was able to order, they had the table ready for us. So half of us never got our drinks. Bartender did acknowledge that he owed us our drinks. Problem is, the drinks never came.

Well, neither did a server. The bussers were quick to bring water and bread which was nice. But we waited 20 minutes and no one came to give us menus or help us. I went to the hostess letting her know that no one has helped us, she said she would get someone. 10 more minutes passed and I had to stop someone to help us. He gave us menus & took our app orders and never came back. 15 more minutes passed and we had to wave another person down because we had no food & no drinks and were ready to order our entrees and beverages....and the guy who initially helped us was nowhere to be found. Add insult to injury, from the moment we were sat, there were a number of servers who just passed us by without checking on us. Even the table next to us was being helped. That's unacceptable.

Finally we got a female server to be our ""regular"" server. Explained about the drink situation and she said she'd get those for us. She was nice but still didn't really check on our table. One of my friends had to search for her for the check as we were just sitting around waiting for quite some time, long after all the plates were cleared and the glasses were dry (including water).

When we got the bill, they charged us full price for everything AND charged us for drinks that we had already paid for at the bar. One of the staff was trying to explain to my friend that they can't honor the anniversary price since she was using a coupon. But she wasn't using a coupon, it was a gift card. They came back with a somewhat corrected bill and told my friend that they took off certain drinks since she used her ""discount"" on it at the bar. DISCOUNT?! Since when is full tender in which you use to pay for services a DISCOUNT?! It's not.

Not to mention our reservation was for 5:45pm and we didn't walk out until 9:40pm. 

As much as I loved this place, this experience created such a foul taste that I don't think I'll be able to give it another chance for quite some time.

Additionally, they have a ""rewards"" program that doesn't work. The average I've spent on visits here has been $150+ and I'd come several times a month, sometimes several times a week and not once has a reward come through. So if you see the paper in your bill to sign up, there's no point in wasting your time with it.",ufOZcCPOu_qky0aDeeKmlw,8,0,1,LRW3qh0wKtoHkg0xnX0gRA
4678858,2018-06-17,4,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I've been going to different restaurants near the Strip for over 20 years now.  I'm not sure that I've been more disappointed than I was here.  It's not that anything in particular stands out as been awful but, rather that nothing at all was good.  We started with happy hour drinks at the bar...not bad, a little pricey but, then there was some kind of mixup with the receipts I was overcharged and then they brought a bill to the table which is pretty disruptive and confusing during my dinner.  Now, I gotta check credit card records to make sure everything is copasetic. Also, there are some tables near the bar area that look much nicer than the tables in the dining room. I requested to be seated at one of them but we were told that it was reserved.  From the start to finish when we left I noticed nobody had been seated at the table we asked for.  As for our table, it seemed small and the chairs uncomfortable.  At one point when the bread came to the table they had to remove the red rose that was placed there in order to accommodate the bread basket :-(  I just thought that was little bit strange too.  The Food: The menu is a little shady & it appears that the pasta is the way to go (Italian place,) but they don't push & prefer the higher ticket items.  Unfortunately, what looked to be the feature pasta ($43,) was the tagliatelle with lobster and scallops.  The seafood in the dish was noticeably fishy (probably a day or two behind what it should have been.)  Did read the famous article that Anthony Bourdain wrote, so We probably should have known better.  I ordered the pomodoro, which looked nothin like pomodoro & more like marinara with a hint of chilli flakes... boo.  When they brought our wine we noticed that it wasn't the same vintage as on the wine list...another miss.  Most of the items including the pasta, salmon,  stuffed pepper and even the desert (with the exception of the cookies,) were pretty underwhelming.  Our server was good though.  For $300 plus there are far better options if you ask me.",XxTf-dF1lfOBgLGV-mbyfg,0,0,1,e900m0oZXaCQiHp1_UIIxg

All of the Italian classics and typical favorites are well represented and very well prepared here. The wine list is truly extensive, and the staff's recommendations at least at my table during my visit was perfect.

It should be noted that the decor of the place (which tries to upscale it's location at the end of a strip mall  and almost pulls it off) could use some attention to detail. One should not have torn artwork hanging on the walls as I found in the side room I was in. And while the wine recommendations were spot on, there were times our table felt ignored...drinks were not tended to, plates were not cleared in a timely manner...in short Ferraro's is a good experience when you're enjoying what's on your plate, but when I'm sitting there with 2 empty glasses for over 15 minutes...at this price point that's not acceptable.

During the previous summer, Ruben and I dined with one of our best friends, Randy. We were delighted to discover that they were offering locals 50% off the bill! Whoa right? So we took full advantage of it and did a full Italian dinner! ANTIPASTI: Calamari Fritti and Salsiccia Calabrese e Rapini (housemade spicy sausage grilled with polenta triangles). PASTA sampler course: Gnocchi with Boar Ragu, Lobster Truffle Ravioli, and Agnolotti (ravioli filled with spinach, mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella, tear-drop tomato sauce). I SECONDI: Osso Bucco, Fettuccine Pomodoro Con Ricotta Fresca, and Agnolotti (Ruben liked it so much, he ordered it for his entrée!). DESSERT: Pistachio Passion (layered pistachio cream, cream cheese custard & whipped cream atop a rich walnut crust) and Tiramisu. Everything was phenomenal. We all ordered drinks as well and the bill was around $150. Amazing.

Today, we visited for lunch and had to get the Calamari Fritti again. Very nice. Light breading, large, fresh prices of calamari, and delicious, spicy marinara. It definitely outshined the Calamari we had just two days ago! I opted for the Spaghetti Vongole e Pomodorini (housemade spaghetti with clams, olive oil, garlic & cherry tomatoes) and Ruben had the Penne Pesto e Pollo (penne with a light basil sauce topped with chicken breast). Both were really wonderful and the pasta was seriously good (also, cooked perfectly al dente)! I also don't remember the bread tasting so good last time! They were little baguettes with an oil dipping sauce and I couldn't get enough.

SUCH BAD BUSINESS...
We got menus but were so irritated with their choice to ""cancel happy hour"", charging everyone (including locals) more money, we left.

If you are looking for an extensive wine list, almost an encyclopedia of wine, this is your place.  They appear to have it all!

The food was fresh, but was very heavy.  We probably should have shared a salad and an entree between the two of us.  We finished the meal with a raspberry cheesecake that was divine.

The atmosphere was very busy.  There were a lot of staff and patrons coming and going around our table.  There was a lounge singer warbling out Christmas tunes, backed up by a piano player, but due to the volume of the chatter in the bar you could hardly hear them.

I gave Ferraro's 3 stars because our service , the atmosphere, and food were only so-so compared to the prices you pay.  We went in well over $100 for our meal and it was something I could have gotten at a chain Italian restaurant.

Didn't take the order. He came back only walked past us to deal with another table. At this point we had been there an hour. So we walked out. Kaizen Fusion Sushi was across the parking lot.

The food was pretty expensive and only average. Imagine Olive Garden at the double the price.  My spaghetti and meatballs were $28 I think and I didn't even want to finish it all.  The worst part was the VERY overpriced wine list.  I am an experienced wine drinker as I travel and collect wines.  The list was not very creative and most bottles I recognized had a 3x markup.  After carefully reviewing the wine list, I decided to order a beer as I have a hard time paying such marked up prices.  My buddy commented he will also not return.

Arrive 25 minutes early for our reservation and are immediately seated. Place is very modern upscale Italian eatery with various rooms, nooks, crannies, side rooms etc that gives each type of patron from an intimate 2 top to a larger party options.  

Quickly presented with the bottled water option, the wine list etc and two wonderful valued Sicilian wines are offered and IN VINTAGE.  Some garlic bread and rolls are presented with an Olive Oil garlic dipping sauce but the bread is Not hot and garlic bread simply cold.  

Various specials are given and many lean hard on White Truffles which are an additional $80.00 to any entree BE CAREFUL HERE on this part. If you stick to the basic menu you will be very satisfied. 

Appetizers in no particular order:

Shrimp Lemon butter Garlic two large shrimp in a delicate sauce were very fresh and extremely tasty. 

Stuffed pepper ""nonna's"" with beef, veal, mozerella, and eggplant topped with an unassuming marinara sauce was very much top shelf. 

Ceasar salad was very authentic with hearts of unbroken romaine lettuce with large slices of cheese covered with dressing heavy on anchovies and a hard boiled egg for esthetics. 

The Real winner was the Meatballs which were absolutely outstanding. 

Entrees:  No particular order

Veal marsala was two pieces of nice tender scalopini with a delicate sauce roasted potatoes and brocollini.  Thought the amount of veal was a little light for the price point but a 7 out of 10 taste wise. 

Two Special Veal Osso Bucco one with ""Faro"" not quite sure what that is were absolutely fresh and outstanding, quality and taste wise. $45.00

The best thing on the table was the Grilled Veal chop hanging off the bone it was by far one of the best Chops I've ever tasted.  With some nice mushrooms it was clearly one of the finest dishes presented. 

LOSER: My entree  Pasta Carbonara was almost cold as you can see the cream sauce congealing as it sat.  The peas were almost not cooked as the were hard like rocks and the overall taste of the dish was lacking in every facet on a 1-10 this one gets a 1 Really NOT AT ALL what was expected as they rave about home made pastas.

Skipping desert and coffee - it took some time to get the check and the appetizers came quickly while there was a significant delay in delivery of dinner entrees. Place was packed but still a little slow on delivery. 

Also was told our Taxi was waiting outside and we go out and nobody has any idea what we are talking about. 

All and all a definite repeat they need to tighten up a few things to get my 5 star rating. 

NOTE LOCALS with Nevada ID can get on their local club which gives 25% off the ENTIRE CHECK... That alone with mostly wonderful food will get us back there.",ic3Lw9nuyESd5wFRH7TFpw,4,2,4,XDeIi-iyzVyAj-MMoam3gQ

4820455,2016-01-11,2,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Decided to check out this place last night since it was open late and I was dressed quite nicely so I wanted a dressier ambiance. Came in a little after 11p and it was their late night menu which was the full menu minus 5 items. Everything was full priced but you receive 25% off your entire check if you dine between 11p-2am. I came as a party of 2 and we sat at the bar. At that time there's only bar and lounge self seating available. The bartender was friendly and attentive but maybe that's because there were only 7 people at the bar and 2 in the lounge area at the time. 

Fritto misto: I really enjoyed the breaded calamari and there were 2 pieces of shrimp along with 4 pieces of smelt fish. Being Asian, I liked the smelt fish thrown in there. It was different. 

Spicy sausages: 2 small-medium sized sausages served on a bed of greens. Good flavor but a little on the pricey side just for 2 sausages. 

Branzino: highly recommend this dish! Served over garbanzo beans I believe it was? And the skin on the small sea bass was crispy on one side and the meat was juicy and tender. It was easy to eat too. Bones were only found in the tail so I think they deboned most of it before cooking. 

Seafood pappardelle: very seafoody.. The sauce had a tangy flavor that blended well with the lobster and scallop in there. The thinly sliced asparagus provided a good crunch to balance out the soft scallop and the noodles were al dente! Only downside was that the lobster was rather tough and not tender, probably because it's not fresh.

I was in the mood for a light pasta and also accepted a recommendation for a pesto sauce; again, delicious.  

Service was perfect, friendly but not overly so, knowledgeable, and timely. Decor is upscale and tastefully done.  

While we each enjoyed a cocktail and did not order wine and did not talk with the sommelier (again, it was 
Late), this appears to be a spot for serious wine lovers, particularly Italian wines.  The wine list was in a two-inch leather-bound notebook and nearly all of the offerings seemed high end.

Let me set the scene - nice ambiance, attentive service, zero vegan options.  Lots of vegetarian, but nothing vegan (with the possible exception of a salad.)  However, our server was on the ball and they rustled up some egg-free pasta in the back of the kitchen and left the ricotta off the linguine pomodoro.  

I had the pasta ($19) and a glass of Sangiovese ($14), which made for about a $40 dinner with tax, tip, etc.  The pasta was pretty delicious I will say.  Definitely high quality tomatoes, olive oil.  Very simple but well executed.  But I felt like I didn't have $40 worth of dinner.  

Bottom line - not worth it to me to pay that much for that little, but I would gladly go again if someone else were footing the bill or if I got in on the 1/2 off locals deal that Adina mentions below.  

Everyone else in my party raved about their food, so if you eat eggs and cheese, you'll probably enjoy the food and feel like you're getting your money's worth.",C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw,4,1,3,Wkejhe3f8hMLLOKbJOOD3w

I love going out to fancy dinners and splurging every so often so I was super excited. Basically, the ambiance and food were awesome, but the service was so blah that I just couldn't enjoy the restaurant much.

We arrived right on time and were seated right away. Our server came over and my bf showed him the certificate, but he told us they had stopped taking them. We said we didn't know because restaurant.com usually informs you if that happens with a certificate you've purchased. We were not rude or upset with the server at all and in fact were totally nice about it. After that little exchange, he basically treated us like we didn't exist. We had checked in on Yelp and saw that there was an appetizer offer for checking in and didn't even feel comfortable bringing it up as he had seemed so annoyed about the restaurant.com certificate.

I think this sums up everything he said to us that night: ""Wine? (takes our order) Great."" And then later, ""Ready to order? (takes order) Great."" And once we were done with our meals, ""Dessert or are you done?"" To which we replied, ""we are super full, so ready for the check whenever."" And that's it. When he dropped off the check after running our card, he didn't even say thank you for coming in or have a nice night or anything. Just dropped it off quickly on his way to another table. 

Needless to say, I don't even need to go into details about the food, but I will say that one of my fave places is Gaetano's in Henderson, which has a swanky romantic ambiance and the food is even better AND the service is TOP NOTCH.

a. Location - On the NE corner of Harmon and Paradise, this place is easily accessible to all areas of Las Vegas.  Plenty of parking and although in a strip mall, very well placed to streets and the freeway.

b.  Ambiance - This is a fairly large place that has some private areas, some normal areas, a bar area. I think it will be able to handle groups of all sizes!  Comfortable, roomy and elegant yet casual.

c.  Service - This is one reason I come back. I bring my friends from Middle East and Europe here and they really love it. We usually ask for Alessandro to wait on us and we don't use the menu. WE just describe to him what experience we are looking for, and he and the chef bring stuff out for us. It is great.  Friendly, professional and very attentive.

d.  Food - As you know, we just yap and the waiter and chef bring stuff out. Antipasto, sharing three types of pasta on a tasting plate, a bit of meat, small bits of dessert.  It does not get better than this!  Love it and everyone that comes here enjoys it as well.

e.  Price - A tad bit more expensive, because we are trying lots of stuff.  Usually ends up about 50.00 per person without alcohol. OK, so at Olive Garden you may spend about 25.00 per person, however, the price is relative. This place is unique,and the pasta's are great. The last time we had lobster ravioli, gnocchi, and risotto. We had antipasto, calamari, then we had osso buco and a bit of cannoli and tiramisu.

We used to get into town and have dinner that first night at the old location on West Flamingo.  The veal osso bucco is the best version of this dish I've ever had, my favorite Italian dish in town, and my 2nd favorite dish overall in the Valley (narrowly losing to a mighty competitor, the reserve ribeye at Carnevino).  But, Ferraro's is so much more than its most famous dish.  They have had, on occasion, a lobster risotto that will make you forget your spouse's name.  We've ordered it more than once and it's worth twice what they charge.  

The ambiance is very fancy, but the servers are fantastic and make you feel at home.  Wine list is long and can be high, but you can find some good Italian selections that won't force you to eat off the value menu for the rest of your trip.  It's well worth the short cab ride from whatever strip hotel you are staying at, and if you are a local, you MUST come during restaurant week.  The full portion osso bucco is offered for only $50, and it includes a starter and dessert.

The waiter who was assigned to our party was just like Alfred from Batman!  He was at our beck and call.  He was attentive to our needs, very knowledgeable of the Italian food lingo and he wheeled n' dealed us on the most prestigious dishes on the menu.  Not to mention his team of bus persons who hawked us for any breadcrumbs to be immediately scraped off the table.  
Honest to say, I've been tired of the Italian food fare.  If it wasn't for a deal breaker I found on Restaraunts.com, I would have never considered dining at this stallion of a venue.  Needless to say, The menu items were more on the Bucket O' Gold side, but because of the quality and taste of the food, it was money well spent.  We ordered a number of items on the menu, but the one most memorable dish, out of all things, was the calamari!  The squid was fresh and fried to perfection!  If ya gotta PYT, take her here to start things off.. the ambiance is very dramatic.  If you're coming with a sizeable party, I suggest you order numerous items and have the chef portion the food to the number of people in your party.

Other than that, my experience was less than gratifying.

The calamari fritti was good, sauce was pretty good.

I was pretty upset to find that the menu on the website is not even a representation of the menu provided in the restaurant. The website says copyright 2012, but Ferraro's does NOT serve Eggplant Parmigiana as stated on their website, nor is their Chicken Parmigiana $20. It was $24.  Also, I've NEVER been to an ITALIAN restaurant that serves broccoli, carrots and POTATOES (potatoes!? seriously?!) with ANYTHING in marinara sauce. Especially since the menu both on the website and IN THE RESTAURANT says ""served with pasta.""

The Food:
- The anchovy caesar salad was perfect.  Had a nice bite, but was smooth at the same time
- The octopus appetizer was perfectly garlicky.  The octopus was firm, yet tender.  Very good
- My main, a pasta dish with spicy sausage and uni, sounded unique and inspired.  It wasn't very good.  A B for trying, but it just didn't meld.  At all

The bar maid was not the best and the bartender made some mistakes while we were there, and he just poured it in another glass and added soda water to it.

5022472,2016-08-24,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"my wife and i visited this place at the bequest of a friend, ex friend now, lol.

the restaurant was sparsely populated and we made a reservation for our 36th wedding anniversary, anticipating a full house. as there was plenty of seating, we were quickly taken to our table and sat in virtual isolation for what seemed like an eternity. well after around 15 minutes the waiter  finally arrived and asked if we were interested in a bottle of wine. when we told him we weren't the big freeze was on as our cost of dinner would be relatively below his expectations. not seeking to mask his disappointment, he annoyingly grabbed the wine glasses off the table and disappeared. 

interestingly enough, this was a reoccurring theme, which may have been related to the huge magician convention in vegas, perhaps our great disappearing waiter was  practicing his act?

our appetizer order called for their fresh mozzarella with prosciutto. what we got instead was a tiny dried out single piece of mozzarella, surrounded by a ton of prosciutto, wtf? one may be the loneliest number but this mozzarella was in the same situation!  

our second appetizer of meatballs never showed and we had to wait for the waiter to ""reappear"" which took another half hour as he was now perfecting his act.  news flash from the local dj, if you're coming here for either the single slice of mozzarella or meatballs don't bother as they both were well below par!  in the case of the meatballs, we were served three miniature balls with a tasteless acidic tomato sauce, which should be served with a side of rolaids! these meatballs did not disappear  but our waiter did, again! wtf x 2

at this time i decided to go ""back stage"" and find this gentlemen, who was on the other side  of the restaurant cow-towing to the big  budget wine customers. i understand a waiter has to make a living but give us a little love in lieu of food, which we were clearly not getting. 

when ""criss angel"" finally made it back to our table, he asked what we wanted for our main course and we literally forgot, since it had been so long since we looked at the list of entree's! 

deciding that discretion was the better part of valor , we politely declined to have reacquaint ourselves with the menu. this was actually an historic event, as this is the first time in my life or my wife's that we have decided to pass on the main course as a result of spotty service and less than mediocre appetizers! 

what a way to spend an anniversary! wtf x 36!

in closing, las vegas is filled with some great italian restaurants which i have reviewed on yelp. they deserve and earn your attention by providing excellent service, quality food and no disappearing waitstaff!

5042217,2013-02-18,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I've never had the amazing opportunity to have a Valentine's date on February 14th.  Never, so you can imagine my excitement when I found out I had not 1, but FOUR other beautiful dates joining me this year on that special day.  Tonight, we decided to do it big, not only because it was Valentine's, but because this was my 200th Yelp review!!!  We wanted to check out a fine dining restaurant close to the strip so we stumbled upon Ferraro's.  

The minute you pull up, you can tell you're going to be treated to a dramatic evening.  The outside is accented with stone and the low lighting shows a sneak peak of this intimate restaurant.  Red and white awnings add a little color and pizazz.  When you walk in, the first thing you'll notice is the very dramatic chandelier. The restaurant's red and yellow combinations offered a very passionate dining experience which made me realize this was an excellent choice for couples on Valentine's Day. The hostess stand included granite counter tops and etched glass.  I knew this wasn't my typical restaurant visit and that I needed to be prepared to throw some cash down that night!

One thing that did turn me off was the fact that we had reservations for 5:30pm and still had to wait for 15 minutes.  A party even got sat before us.  I didn't want to say anything because I didn't know the complete story, however, my perception made me a little irritated.  After the wait, we were sat in our own little room, close to the bathroom.  Our reservations were for 5 people, we got sat at a table for 8.  Kind of big, but I still appreciated having our own room.  Our server assistants were super nice.  My water glass was never empty and our table was constantly kept in an organized state.  Another thing that bothered me was the fact that our actual server didn't have much patience with our party.  It almost seemed as if he didn't think we belonged there.  I mean, he's probably right.  We love humble places, but let us enjoy it!  It's a special occasion!

One very impressive thing was their extensive wine list.  67 pages long!!  They also have an option to tour their wine cellar which I thought was super amazing.  Our party ordered two bottles that evening:  A Sauvignon Blanc and a Pinot Noir.  I don't exactly know what kind of Pinot we ordered, although I know it was from California and about $50 a bottle.  As for the Sauvignon Blanc, we ordered the Ferrari-Carano, Sonoma County '10 for $45 a bottle.  It was light and crisp.  Not sweet like a Riesling, which I LOVED!  Great choice.  

Now onto dinner.  I decided to get the Risotto Funghi, Prosciutto e Porcini for $32.  As described on the menu, Italian vialone nano rice, porcini mushrooms, proscuitto.  No joke, THE BEST risotto I've had to date!  I love a great risotto and this dish did not disappoint.  Probably the most creamiest rice, huge pieces of porcini mushrooms and stems.  Add in the smokey flavor of crispy proscuitto and I was seriously in heaven.  I had to eat this slow, just to savor every bite.  That's how amazing it was. A good friend of mine had the chef's special, a Chilean Seabass with champagne sauce and black truffles for about $50.  There were other dishes ordered, however, those are the two that really stood out to me.  The food made me take a step back and realize how good life was.  Nothing better than food that makes you sit back and think of life's many wonderful things.  Super cheesy but it really made me feel that way!

Now I'm not a person who can afford this type of dining every night.  Every person on the table paid $75 each that night. Definitely somewhere you can visit on special occasions like Valentine's Day.  If you want to try an amazing Italian restaurant on a special night, please come by and check out Ferraro's.  The food alone makes you kiss your fingers and yell, ""delizioso!""",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,3,2,4,gx9FrGfbHlngpHyOUKTuXA

Got Arancini Tartufo for appetizers because those are ultra noms.

Mom and Gma had the same thing as last time- the porcini rubbed ribeye, mac n cheese and green bean sides. It was a little too red for mom in law so they had to refire it. We are barely convincing her that at a minimum to get it medium (pink) and not well done so a bit of red gets her bothered still. After the refire she was fine. Grandma didn't care if hers was a bit more red and enjoyed it.

I grabbed Pappardelle Mimmo (Long wide pasta with scallops, lobster, asparagus, butter, sage, truffle) $39 this time around. It was pretty good, a bit rich. The scallops and lobster was cooked perfectly and pretty generous. What I liked is that they had slice truffle on it and not truffle oil. 

BF got Costolette d'Agnello (Double cut premium, Colorado lamb chops served with Sicilian caponata) $39. The lamb was quality but the BF felt it was under seasoned. There are like 5 items the BF has been dedicated to learn to cook perfectly and one is pan seared lamb (chops and racks) so he isn't a kind judge on no seasoning. It was the first thing he ever learned about cooking was how to season. If you put the caponata with a bite of lamb then it does give it flavor but the BF did not like the caponata so he ate some of mom and grandmas green beans and mac with it. 

I got a beer this time since last I saw they had some rare and interesting beers that are not distributed to stores. I grabbed Bière Du Boucanier Red ($8 for a bottle) which was a lovely Belgian Pale Ale that was a bit hops from the red pale ale style, a bit the familiar Belgian taste, and was a dry champagne like finish with a bit of sweet. I know there are a bunch of lovely wines, but you know what? I'm in a beer phase and don't fucking care. Craft beer can be high end and refined and it perfectly paired with my dish. 

We got some desserts this time around.

White Chocolate Navan Creme Brulee w/raspberries ($7.50). I love creme brulee and this was cooked perfectly. Most places just do vanilla bean brulee so the slight change of flavor was nice. 

Poached Pears w/ grapes and vin santo wine sauce and ice cream ($7.50). Nice, light dessert. I wouldnt think cooked grapes would be good, but I like them. 

Our server was decent. Nice and kinda funny in a cheesy way. 

I loved my birthday dinner, but this one had a few hitches with the food so I can only give this experience 4 stars. I still think it's a good spot though so a future late night Happy Hour will be the next visit.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,4,4,mY41iAb-5Vn30Xi40bz8Gw

I had the CASERECCE, and my fiance had the SPAGHETTINI AGLIO E OLIO, both of which were delicious. The bread was so savory with the olive oil, vinegar and what tasted like a garlic pesto.

Waiters I talked to were all 3 Italian, or mastered a fake italian accent, o e or the other, which was nice. I got a free appetizer sampler by checking on on Yelp which had a bologna ravioli and a mushroom pasta dish that was all right. 

I ordered the Bufala mozzarella and  prosciutto  appetizer, which I have provided a photo of, and it was amazing. I wish it had more cheese but it's real and expensive ($21). The prosciutto was very good as well.

For the main course I had the Lobster Asparagus ravioli (also supplied a photo) in a light wine cream sauce which was also good but I could tell the lobster had been frozen. However, that did not stop me from eating every bite.

For dessert i had the white chocolate Montenegro creme brûlée, which tasted fine however I couldn't taste the white chocolate, just tasted like normal creme brûlée to me.

Overall a nice restaurant a little on the pricy side, although this is Vegas, and good service.

Its a deceivingly big and upscale spot, nestled between a gentleman's club and a tattoo shop in a strip mall. Don't be put off by the neighbors.... This place is the real deal.

We were whisked to our table in seconds, quickly honoring our reservation, even with a full house.

Our waiter, Eric, was fantastic. Charming, knowledgeable, friendly and as excited about telling us about the food as we were about eating it. It adds so much to the meal to have great service..... Kudos to Eric.

After picking some wine from the 2"" thick wine list (with Eric's guidance), warm bread is brought to the table, with a bowl of olive oil and spices for dipping.  A great start!

Next we shared a carpaccio appetizer. A full plate sized sliver of perfect lean raw beef, garnished with a mound of lightly oiled and seasoned greens is rolled tableside with freshly squeezed lemon juice. With Eric's commentary as he rolled the beef with flair and an experienced hand, the prep was as much fun as the food. This was an outstanding app - meat tender and fresh and the balance of acidity from the lemon with the crisp greens highlighting each bite.

I asked for and was easily accommodated an off menu entree. One of my favorite preparations is spaghetti aglio olio (garlic and oil), with shrimp.
The prep here was spot-on.

The house made spaghetti was thin and cooked perfectly al dente, bathed lightly in olive oil with slivers of sautéed garlic. This, topped with 4 tail-on shrimp, broiled to pink perfection - crunchy but not rubbery. To say that I cleaned the plate is an understatement - I even mopped up the remaining garlic and oil with the last piece of bread!

My companion tried the veal piccata. This was 2 nice sized medallions of thinly pounded veal, lightly breaded and sautéed in a light, flavorful stock, butter and lemon sauce and garnished with capers. Another excellent rendition.

The tab for 2 with 3 glasses of wine was $135, very reasonable for an outstanding meal in a town filled with hi profile restaurants. I highly recommend Ferraros, you won't be disappointed.",Yy5uYBI7PH5fVtfQjYI76Q,6,3,5,2997Evj-0weLzd6hhKu3dA

Nor do I try to pretend I know how to pick the best food or wine from the menu.  That's where Apollo came in handy.

It is good and it is a nice restaurant. If you're looking to take out some on a fancier date...then yes. Splurge to impress. 

They have a very large wine selection, and that's always a plus. 

We had the cesar salad - you can definitely tell they make their own dressing. It had a fresh garlic taste and it made for tasty breath. 

For dinner - 
Osso Bucco - Of course, very tender. I wasn't a fan of the sauce and I'm also not a fan of veal. My boyfriend did like it though and he did order it. If you love veal, I'm sure you'd enjoy this dish. 

Pappardelle Mimmo - I liked this dish a lot. It wasn't overpowered by butter or oil like a lot of places do for their butter sauces. It had a very distinct smell of truffles and they also serve a large portion of lobster in the dish. They served it with two large scallops which I would have preferred it to be pan seared. They were steamed very well to where they were not chewy though. Overall - very tasty dish. 

The service was good - it wasn't extraordinary. They were very good at making sure we had water/wine at all times. The server was nice a polite. I kind of noticed that this place has a lot of older people and they seem to cater more towards that crowd. The reason I say this is - there were two tables with older couples in nicer attire and they were served much quicker than we were. There was a table of four (same size party as us) that was sat about 10 minutes after us. Within 2 minutes, they were served water, bread and the drinks they ordered. We didn't even get asked about drinks other than wine until after them. 

The other odd thing is, the waiter gave us our tab and we told him how we wanted it split up. He took the two cards (our tab was over $300) and then he brought it back with his 18% gratuity on there. It was not listed on there before. Not that we wouldn't have tipped him. My bf and I typically tip 20% in most cases, but that was definitely a turn off. I didn't remember seeing this anywhere, but in a nicer place like this - I think it's a bit tacky. 

So I'm half and half on this place. Maybe I'll go back....maybe I won't. :)",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,3,0,3,-2fPucZo8R3RvUNFolQrDA

5131775,2011-08-02,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I discovered Ferraro's by attending a Las Vegas Woman's Magazine networking event held there. They were serving these appetizers called Arancini Tartufo also known as a mouthful of heaven! Basically, they are risotto and cheese formed into balls, fried and served with a cheese dipping sauce.  Each person dining should have their own serving. That same night I ordered their Italian meas and cheese tray with olives and pepperoncinis. To die for! I wanted to go back but the opportunity never presented itself until months later when I received an email that Ferraro's was offering summer deals for locals. So I took them up on their $9.95 lunch special which included a salad and entree. I chose the house salad that was sprinkled with their house balsamic vinaigrette which was sweet and tangy at the same time and the Pollo Vesuvio with Rosemary Sauce. If I wasn't in a high class restaurant, I would have licked my plate. I instead opted for the olive rolls that were served with olive oil and herb dipping sauce to capture the remaining rosemary sauce on my plate. I was too full to partake of dessert. But I have a plan- upon my return, I will the skip lunch special and just do the same appetizer and then dessert. This place is so fantastic! You can tell it is run by a family who puts their heart and soul into every dish!. If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting on? I'm pretty sure even in this economy you can afford $9.95 lunch special from 11a-4p until Sept 30 and they also have other specials for locals.

We probably didn't need them, though, as we walked in and were immediately seated by the hostess. Gino Ferraro and his wife Rosealba greeted us at the door and remained there at least until we left, welcoming every customer that walked in.

Immediately after we were seated, our server Eric came over and began taking care of us. He described the daily specials, got our drink orders, and even helped my wife make up her mind as to what to order (she's really indecisive when it comes to getting dinner at a new place).

I got the Filleto di Manzo with the Pasta e Fagioli appetizer, my wife got the Risotto Arogosta with a side order of Insalata Mimmo. The food took a little while to get out to our table but the staff kept us busy with our appetizers, bread, and their delicious garlic oil. The Fagioli was a true Italian fagioli, with chicken stock and short pasta. It was delicious and flavorful. The Insalata was caprese-style with chunks of mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, and avocado. The wife raved.

The food, once it arrived, was well worth the wait. The Filetto (a 10-ounce tenderloin) was deftly seasoned and seared to a  perfect medium rare. It came on a bed of winter greens (with rapini, Brussels sprouts, green onions, and asparagus) and a delicious beef reduction sauce. The wife's Risotto was cooked perfectly al dente. The lobster was fresh and her only complaint was that the marscapone-based sauce was very rich and she was too full from the salad to finish the whole thing. 

After dinner, we were too full to even contemplate dessert, but Eric insisted in bringing out a sampler plate of two of their desserts: tiramisu and cannoli. Both were wonderful. Had I the room, a full order would have happened.

Bottom line, Ferraro's is one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. From the family atmosphere to the friendly and attentive service to the superb food, Ferraro's did not miss a note all night. We will certainly be going back.",2_REXj53rwlHZW1nICP72g,2,1,5,zc3WL-zsZDPv6gz0gWXUYw
5139873,2013-09-08,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Came here for restaurant week!

Semi casual Italian restaurant, off the strip, that caters to locals!  Not sure if they offer the menu at 1/2 price for locals year round, but during our visit it was still going on!  That's EVERYTHING on the regular menu at half price for locals!

We supplemented the RW menu with Calamari Fritti ($15 / $7.50 for locals): Fried calamari and Spicy Tomato Sauce. This was good, very tender pieces of squid. Lightly breaded with not much flavor/seasoning...almost plain!  Wish these was a bit more zing/kick in the flavor dept.

The Complimentary bread...nothing crazy here, but the pesto/olive oil combo was nice.  I dipped the calamari in it to add flavor lol.

Tasting of Agnolotti : Ravioli Filled with Spinach, Mascarpone, Ricotta, Mortadella, and Tear-Drop Tomato Sauce. Good, but wish there was more to the tasting lol.  They gave up one ravioli, so it was a pretty light portion.

Tasting of Gnocchi Bolognese : House Made Potato Dumplings with Bologna Meat Sauce. This was perfect! The dumplings were super soft, tender and meat sauce was flavorful! This was the highlight of the night for me actually, and I would come back for this dish alone!  Gnocchi doesn't usually do too much for me, but this actually wow'd me!

Mista del Casa: Mixed Greens with Balsamic Vinaigrette. This was actually pretty good, coming from someone that doesn't enjoy eating salad lol. Simple but flavorful salad.

Caprese di Bufala: Bufala Mozzarella, Heirloom Tomatoes, Basil, Pine Nuts, Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil. I only tasted the Mozzarella, which was good. Not my kind of dish.

For main entrees, Osso Buco ($45 or $22.50 for locals): The House Specialty, Veal Shank Braised in Red Wine Reduction and Faro. This was super tender, fall off the bone, and melt in your mouth! Sauce was a good consistency, but a bit rich...couldn't finish it!  Tried the bone marrow...ok, but I guess I am not a huge marrow fan.

Pollo Piccata: Chicken Breast, Capers, Lemon, Butter and White Wine. Good chicken, a bit heavy on the capers with a strong mustard taste, but good overall.

And for dessert, a Tasting of Tiramisu and Cannoli. Tiramisu wasn't overly strong tasting, but good overall. Cannoli had a crisp shell and light filling...good! 

Service was very friendly, and our waiter even entertained Little Foodie Dude while he ate :P

Prices would be great if you are local, and fair if you aren't...just not as much bang for your buck on certain dishes.  Go with the pasta since everything is made in house!  Give em a try :P

5141739,2012-07-25,0,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"After my meal at Ferraro's, I found that it could be viewed in one of two ways...as a local or as a visitor/tourist.

As a local I could go as high as a 4/5, but as a tourist it could be as low as a 2/5, so I split the difference.  The main reason is price.  Before going to Ferraro's I checked out the menu online and thought, ""man this places must be fancy, maybe this is an off-strip gem"" (since it was suggested by a long-time Vegas resisdent, myself being new to the area).  The decor was nice, staff friendly, the bar wasn't bad either.  For me there is always that bit of hesitation when all the starters, salads, soups on the menu are $10-$20 because it tends to cause expectations to go up.

I will say the apps were pretty good.  My brother-in-law got a pizza which looked like nothing special but he did clean his plate.  I went with the sausage and peppers which was definitely good, but not a $14 app.  I mean sausage and peppers should be about as cheap as it comes.  My wife went with the Chef Mimmo salad which was also good.  The avocado was very fresh as is common in this parts and the balsamic and mozzarella was good as well.  It was a different take on the salad because all the ingredients were served as cubes or chunks and tossed together.

For my entree I went with the Filet.  It was probably below average.  Cooked right but very plain, not a lot of flavor at all, not a $41 filet. The veggies were standard, nothing special there.  However, the mashed potatoes were clearly of the instant variety.  The only reason I took a second bite was to confirm the first was actually that bad.  My wife went with the porcini rubbed rib-eye.  This was much better than the filet but still not a $48 entree.

Now for the savings grace...locals get 50% OFF with a local ID.  I didn't scour the bill in detail since the wife took care of it, but I'm not sure if the discount applied to all food or just entrees.  Either way, this made the meal much more tolerable.  I went from thinking her meal at $48 was wildy over priced and thinking I'd much rather pay an extra $10-$20 at a high end place on the strip, to thinking, this isn't a bad meal for $24.

If I were to go back, I would probably try out some seafood or pasta options versus the beef, but at 50% I can say that I could see myself going back.  However, if you are a tourist staying across the street at the Hard Rock and looking for other options, I might try to look elsewhere for some better value.",mnoe2vwouRADn97dTDkw4A,2,0,3,OfvuRxQEUzUFt6skAuD35Q

I must say for being a wine bar, there were no wine menus or suggestions or even asking if we wanted anything other than water from the person who took our order. We waited for over 15 minutes for a server to come take our order. Meanwhile we were filling ourselves with bread. Finally our server, on his way somewhere else said I'll be with you in 2 minutes. For the restaurant to be as empty as it was, this guy was running around as if he was slammed. He comes up, no introduction, no offerings, no welcome... NOTHING, all he said was you ready? My boyfriend said hello to him, and he just stood there as if we were taking his precious time away... gave him our order and he took off... running around like a chicken with no head. We felt very rushed by him. Finally our food came, which was ok not worth the price in my opinion. We made a comment to one of the bussers and he was apologetic but he just said that that's how the server was. For it being our valentine's day dinner it was very lackluster. Kinda ruined our night.

5182463,2015-05-20,0,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I never do this, but after an epic 5 day trip to Vegas for the ICSC conference, I had one of the best and most memorable meals that I have had in some time at this great family-owned spot off the strip on Tuesday, May 19th, 2015.  Steered here by a taxi driver, my friend and I could not have lucked out any better.

To start, the team was gracious and professional, helping me by holding my bags (seems like this happens a lot in town, especially because it is 5 minutes from McCarron.)  With no reservations we were prepared to sit at the bar, but were lucky to get a great table on the well designed patio.

Tony, our server and friend of the family, was great as well.  He guided us to an unbelievable Barbera, and then helped with a 5-course meal of:

- Nonna's Stuffed pepper, a special that night, but something that reminded both of us of our own grandmothers' cooking.  Solid and a nice portion to share for two.

- Caesar - split - served as a Romaine Wedge, with dressing perfectly and attractively applied by squeeze bottle, a huge, think peel of the Parmigiano Reggiano and a dusting of crisp bread crumbs rather than croutons.  Also a masterful and creative take on a traditional Caesar.

- Now it gets interesting:  the Spaghetti Scoglio was OUTSTANDING.  With shrimp, clams, scallops and calamari, this take on a friutti de mare was balanced nicely with just enough of Chef Mimmo's homemade spaghetti, so it was a dish of seafood, rather than a dish of pasta with some seafood.  Truly one of the best fruitti's I have ever had.  The red sauce balanced with just enough roasted garlic, cheese, and what felt and tasted like a tiny hit of cream at the end for added richness.

- Finally, we shared the Veal Chop Milanese, which was not only huge and beautifully prepared, but the arugula, cherry tomato and ricotta salata salad balanced everything perfectly.

- Dessert was likewise a standout, sharing the Pistachio Passion, a layering of mascarpone, pistachio pudding and whipped cream.  Just light enough but very well executed.

5199371,2010-03-25,2,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"The new location is swanky but in a kind of ""I have to order a glass of red wine"" way. Do you know what I mean? It is just a little stuffy, but this environment definitely serves a purpose. For example, this is a perfect restaurant for your parents from out of town or for a first date, especially a blind date, or for some men in suits. There is nothing offensive, edgy or loud about the experience. 

They actually have happy hour specials on drinks, but we arrived past 7pm--too late for deals. The cheapest glass by the wine is around $12, but they also serve wines in ""tasting"" volumes, i.e. one ounce and five ounces.  

My buddy and I sat in the bar area, which I like. The high-top tables are comfortable, and there is entertainment. They actually have a stage, and when we were there, there was a pianist singing some standard piano songs. I am not a fan of this live music genre, but it does enliven the atmosphere. I think on Friday and Saturday nights they are going to start having a DJ, which could be worth catching. They even have a special late night ""tapas"" menu from 10pm-2am. 

I must say given the current state of breadbaskets, the goods here were above average. The bread was warm, fresh and served with some lovely oil, vinegar and pesto. I had the fettuccine pomodoro with ricotta. The pasta is fresh, and I really enjoyed the texture and thickness. The noodles themselves were well executed, and the flavors were unfussy, but delicious. 

I am probably in a minority, but I have a hard time spending $19 on a pasta dish, especially when there is no meat. Thus, I am torn. I think the food is tasty. The atmosphere is acceptable, but the prices are a tad high. I am going to go ahead and give it four stars because I think it definitely serves a purpose well, but the next time I want noodles, I will more than likely head to Spring Mountain Road (aka Chinatown)!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,6,4,fJVJKPesCfd2_cb_jWfByQ

You sure as hell wouldn't expect it when seeing their location, a strip center on the corner of Harmon and Paradise. But once you walk insie, you immediately forget you are in a strip mall. Someone clearly put some time, effort, and money into the place, right down to the beautiful Italian Murano-glass lighting fixtures.
Long story short, everything about the menu is the real deal. Killer wine selection, classic menu, and almost overly attentive waitstaff.

This place gets busy, so make a reservation. We had one on a Saturday night and still had to wait about 15 minutes, but we got a drink in the bar and had no complaints. Also, use a restaurant.com gift certificate to save yourself some cash.",m0Y9cnGMwIuqxQq92Z0YCQ,1,1,4,U41AU4OAhziDIukImCp8Kw

5279480,2018-01-02,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Now an industry leader for over 31-years, the old-school Italian classics, great service and expansive wine list all well known with Chef Francesco Di Caudo slowly building a name for himself by way of elegant creations not dissimilar to what one might see from the kitchens of Tuscany or even Milan, it was as a party of two that dinner was enjoyed at Ferraro's Italian Restaurant and Wine Bar on Friday.

Nothing short of an icon in a city of constant turnover, the Ferraro family dedicating their lives to the restaurant they built with both Gino and his wife present once again on this night as a lounge singer serenaded patrons while College Football entertained guests at the bar, it was minutes prior to a 6:30 reservation that seating was offered in a semicircular booth behind the hostess podium, familiar servers stopping by with menus and Gino soon standing tableside with a bottle of Prosecco.

Recently transitioning from Autumn to Winter, the classics still present but more than eight new items including several housemade Pastas joining a wide-ranging menu more than capable of pleasing gourmands in addition to those simply looking for a great Meatball or Red Sauce, it was with carte blanche deferred to the kitchen that Dinner began with three Antipasti including imported Burrata at the center of Carrot Salad slicked in Mr. Ferraro's private-stock Olive Oil, the clean sweetness subtle in the setting of Persimmon Gel but far more noteworthy atop tender Octopus and Beef Tartare with cured shavings of Egg Yolk plus Herbs.

Moving along briskly to four more Antipasti paired to Sauvignon Blanc, the crispness of the Wine playing well off bitter Rapini served alongside a coil of Sausage as well as Happy Hour Fowl sweetened by Figs, it would be difficult to say which plate from this course was best when comparing these to a creamy house-smoked Salmon Terrine or crispy poached Egg and shaved White Truffles since not a bite of any went back to the kitchen uneaten.

Sopping up the last of the Egg Yolk with a Roll, the scarpetta of Sauce soon to continue in earnest, it was with a glass of Italian White Chardonnay that five Pastas and one Risotto arrived in two rounds, Gino's favorite Spaghetti Alio & Olio as impressive as ever with plenty of Garlic while thin Noodles topped in Uni and aromatic Carrot Juice dazzled in its complexity, as did plump Broccoli-Cheese Ravioli set-up against similarly sized Clams beneath a quenelle of Tomato Marmalade.

Once again resetting share-plates, the same Chardonnay proving rich enough with Oak to stand up against Beef but a glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo even better, those looking for the city's best handmade Pasta will find themselves challenged to top Chef Di Caudo's Pici amidst tender braised Boar Ragu, the Oxtail Tortellini unfortunately getting a bit lost in the pool of earthy Sauce while the subtly sweet Risotto attests to a kitchen functioning with both skill and confidence.

Veering partially off-menu for Secondi, the must-have spicy Tripe served in a demi-portion alongside two additional plates, it was unfortunate that not enough stomach capacity remained to finish the whole Mediterranean Seabass served simply alongside sautéed Kale and Sweet Potatoes, that space instead reserved for a stylish stack of seared Pork amidst visually indistinguishable layers of Sunchokes and Bosc Pears.

Enjoying a collection of cover tunes ranging from Phil Collins to Boyz II Men as the Buckeyes finished off USC, a double Espresso refreshing the palate and fortifying spirits for a few more bites, anyone visiting Ferraro's without an order of Rosalba's Cookies might as well just say they've never been to the Restaurant, though Mimmo's childhood favorite Pistachio Passion Cake and Di Caudo's impeccable Rhum Baba are also well worth the calories.

***** In a city of re-brands and implosions it speaks volumes about Gino Ferraro's eponymous Restaurant that it has not only managed to survive but thrive for three decades, the service and Wine List speaking for themselves while the addition of Chef Di Caudo has incrementally advanced a menu that will please the traveled and adventurous just as it has those still seeking long-heralded favorites.

RECOMMENDED:  Battuta al Coltello, Salsiccia Calabrese, Uovo Fritto, Spaghetti Alio & Olio, Taglierini ai Ricci, Pici al Cinghiale, Maiale, Trippa Satriano, Pistachio Passion, Rhum Baba, Rosalba's Cookies.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,12,5,WLPdtJZR58HBa8ja9ahRRA

Salad: Mista del Casa OR Caprese di Bufala OR Cesare

Entree: Osso Buco OR Pollo Piccata OR Vitello Saltimboca OR Salmon Marecchiaro

The appetizer option was a bit confusing because it says ""choice of 2"" - so we were thinking each person gets to pick 2 appetizers - nope! It's choice of 2 appetizers per table. So, what if you were eating  by yourself? So, we ordered calamari on top of the RW items. Appetizers and certain menu items are 50% off for locals.

The service was great. Very kid-friendly. They have high chairs and our server, Paolo was entertaining kids. 


Calamari (regular menu):
Tender pieces of squid lightly breaded and seasoned with a side of marinara. This was not chewy at all. 4/5

Agnolotti:
Ravioli filled with mascarpone, ricotta, mortadella and spinach, topped with cherry tomatoes. 4/5

Gnocchi Bolognese:
Potato dumplings with Bolognese meat sauce. I love gnocchi and theirs is freshly homemade. Tender potato pillows with tender pieces of meat. Although I prefer alfredo sauce, the Bolognese meat sauce was yummy. 5/5

Mista del Casa:
Mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette. Nothing that tickles anyone's pickle...it's salad. 3/5

Caprese di Bufala:
Bufala mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, basil and pine nuts drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The usual caprese. 4/5

Osso Buco:
Braised veal shank with farro. Very tender meat and good marrow. The sauce was perfect and not thick. 4/5

Pollo Piccata:
Chicken breast, capers, lemon, butter and white wine. The 2 pieces of chicken breast weren't that tender but the sauce was great. 3.5/5

Dessert Sampler:
Tiramisu and cannoli. The tiramisu wasn't super soaked in alcohol - I didn't taste alcohol at all. The cannoli was one of the best I've had.  Crisp shell and the filling was just divine. 5/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,2,2,4,NDgFoJiFA1ttVR80_IfVKA

5342023,2016-04-06,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"One of the few restaurants in Vegas that lived up to its hype. My boyfriend and I wanted to find a nice italian restaurant and came here for lunch. The interior decor is romantic and has a modern rustic italian vibe. We were immediately seated by the hostess and our server came to explain the menu to us. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. 

CARPACCIO DI MANZO- thinly sliced prime sirloin, arugula salad, shaved parmigiano cheese, and truffle oil
Our server recommended this appetizer and it was amazing! The meat was sliced so thinly and it was so fresh and I loved the earthiness of the arugula and the creaminess of the cheese. The truffle oil added a nice creamy and savory touch to the dish. The lemon was a nice addition to the meat as well because it provided a nice tangy acidity. 

SPAGHETTI VONGOLE E POMODORINI- homemade spaghetti with clams, olive oil, garlic and cherry tomatoes
This dish was very fresh. There were plenty of clams and the spaghetti was cooked perfectly. I only wished that there was more flavor. The olive oil didn't provide much flavor and I tasted a hint of garlic. The cherry tomatoes added a nice sweetness to the dish, but it wasn't enough to coat the whole dish. 

SALMONE GRIGLIATO ALLA CHECCA
Salmon grilled with Fresh Tomatoes, Basil, Fresh Garlic and Kalamata Olives
This dish was very flavorful and saucy. I especially liked the home made sauce and the cherry tomatoes because it added an extra layer of acidity. The salmon was cooked nicely and tasted very buttery and tender. The rigatoni pasta was soft and flavorful.

TIRAMISU- classic italian dessert made with lady fingers, mascarpone cheese & espresso
This dish came out beautifully and it tasted as great as it looked. It was creamy and moist and I especially liked the strong espresso flavor. The lady fingers were soft and soaked up all the flavor and the mascarpone cheese was so creamy.

i definitely want to come back here when I'm in town. They have such great service, the food is fantastic, and it's such a cute place to go to on a date.",2s27wyX1hn2lL1jv5Sn36w,4,4,4,2Jl0WKpwNkeczo0l4zAX4w

I took my husband here for his birthday dinner. It was between this and his favorite Italian restaurant,  Rao's. I figured I'd take him for something new and exciting. First, I was upset that I had made a reservation specifying that it was a special occasion,  my husband's birthday, and the greeters did not pick up on this or mention it. I was also disappointed to see that they stopped offering the locals' discount as of the New Year. 

Next, we were seated without menus and sat for 5 minutes without them. The waiter was not cheerful or pleasant. 

I was hoping for a cheese ravioli but the only options included lobster or meat.  I wound up with the gnocchi, which was actually very good. It tasted authentic and homemade. 

Dessert rolled around. I had hopes that there would be some nice birthday presentation but, no, they missed the mark completely.  

The bathroom was beautiful and spotless but I'll just say this: I hate bathroom attendants. That is all. 

The off the strip location was nice. I liked not having to walk through a casino. But this is one instance where I would rather have gone to the strip. No more locals discount and couldn't even go slightly out of the way to make my husband's birthday a little special? You had potential, Ferraro's, but I'm not a happy customer.",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,6,1,2,GJZYkxb3n51CSu1msPfiAQ

Our waiter was a handsome nephew from Calabria, who made sure our wine glasses were always full and was never away from the table too long.  

My friend and I both started with the Insalata Mimmo...Heirloom Tomatoes, Avocado, Red Onions, Fresh Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Aged Balsamic Vinegar in a Radicchio leaf.  Absolutely delicious.  The guys had Cesar salads and said they were great.  I had the Gnocchi di Patate with Pomodoro sauce and freshly grated Parmesan and it was perfect!   Our friends had Lasagna and Pappardelle Mimmo...which consists of Lobster, Scallops, Asparagus, Butter, Sage and Seasonal Truffles.  They both said their entrees were outstanding.  But the real star of the table was my husband's Osso Bucco, the specialty of the house.  O.M.G.  My Gnocchi was delicious but I kind of kicked myself for not ordering the Osso Bucco.   I kept sneaking pieces from his plate, which I normally don't do but yes, it was that good.

Their wine prices are a bit inflated so we stuck to something inexpensive but with food that good, it really didn't matter.   And darn it, we were too full for desert :(

And I can't forget the live music a few feet away from our table.  We joked that their band consisted of guitar, saxophone, piano and defibrillator, LOL!

Two things that have never changed, and in some ways have gotten better and better, are the food and owner Gino's hospitality. There are new menu items, a wider range of appetizers and side dishes and more nightly specials.

5458216,2017-08-31,2,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I originally choose Piero's for our last dinner in Las Vegas.  A local bartender at the Venetian convinced me otherwise.  Overall, we had a positive experience here.  Here's some of the good things and not so good things. 

Our waiter was nice enough but a little rough around the edges for a fine dinning restaurant.   Caesar salad and fried calamari were brought out all at once.  Dinner started out rushed.  We were in no hurry to celebrate our 28th anniversary dinner.  The pace slowed down as dinner went on. 

I went to wash my hands before dinner.  Maybe it's just me, but I absolutely hate it when I enter a rest room to find I have a new friend in there waiting for me.  Yes, the dreaded bathroom attendant!  No!  I haven't come across one of these guys for over ten years.  

Of course he wants to chat me up, offer a second paper towel to dry my hands.  I can't wait to get out of there.  I just find a bathroom attendant unnecessary and uncomfortable.  Thank God I just needed to wash my hands.  I'm a big boy now, I can do it all by myself.  Thank you.

I really wanted veal parmigiana for dinner.  It's not listed on the menu.  No chicken parmigiana either.  We called and they said yes, we have the veal, bone in as a special.  Great I thought. 

When I went to order our waiter said it's not on special but we can make it anyway.  I guess you can always get it but you have to ask for it.  Why not just list it on the menu along with the chicken parmigiana which I'm sure they can make all the time as well?  I found that to be a bit confusing.

That being said, that veal parmigiana was one of the best I've ever had, ever.  Phenomenal!
When it was brought to the table the first thing I thought was where's the pasta?  

No pasta with this I was told.  Only broccoli rabe which was fine but not what I would serve with a parmigiana.  Our waiter should have asked me what I wanted as a side I think.  He did not.  I've never been to a restaurant that did not include a side of pasta with a veal parm dish.

I asked the waiter and he said a side of pasta was going to be an additional $12.00.  A little 2 oz. portion of pasta would have been perfect.  $12.00?  No thanks.

My GF had the lobster risotto.  She said it was good, but the rice was a little under done but good none the less.  

Our waiter brought out some Tiramisu that had ""Happy Anniversary"" written on it.  Thank you for a nice evening Ferraro's!

Nice restaurant.
Good food.
Good drinks and wine.
Okay waiter.
Should add more available options as to what's available on the menu.

5476665,2012-10-16,0,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Feeling a little peckish late at night, but not wanting to hit a casino, we checked Yelp, it came up with Ferraro's, it also showed that there was a late night menu that was 50 % off, worth the risk.

The food was ok, it could have been great, but the small things were off.
My wife had the Carbonara, I had the Gamberoni pizza.

The carbonara was ok, there was just a little something missing, I couldn't place my finger on it, but it lacked something, I still can't place my finger on it, if I do figure it out I will edit this review. I will say, the pasta was cooked perfectly.

The pizza intrigued me, I had something similar at this place :

http://www.yelp.com/biz/oreganos-pizza-bistro-scottsdale-2

It is a pizza, with potato,  pancetta, shrimp, mozzarella. Oreganos makes it without the shrimp.

To be 100% frank I was worried about the combination, I couldn't get my head around shrimp being on this pizza, but I was happily surprised, the shrimp turned out to be the best part. This could of been a great pizza, except the potato was cut to think. If cut thin like Oregano's makes it the potato gets a little crispy adding a great texture to the pizza.

We really did like the setting, we sat outside by the fire pit, it was a nice way to have a late night dinner. The service was very good, attentive without being intrusive.

The 50% deal meant a check of just under $50, not a bargain for sure (including a glass of wine) but an ok price for what we got, if it had been at full price I don't think I would have been happy, so take advantage of the specials.",5XKjVehgGzb5dJocdI-36Q,2,0,3,D4LdNEMhAMpBG8V5w55jdA

5495321,2014-01-21,0,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"I left Ferraro's disappointed. Good service could not make up for lackluster, overpriced food. 

I had the Caesar Salad and the Risotto Aragosta e Tartufo Nero (Italian vialone nano rice, lobster meat, seasonal black truffles, mascarpone, truffle oil).   The Caesar salad was good. Two hearts of romaine topped with a decent Caesar dressing and shaved Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. 

The Risotto was a total disappointment. If there was any lobster meat in it, I couldn't tell. I could neither see any or taste it. To make matters worse, I could not pick out any truffle taste in the Risotto.  So, essentially I had what amounted to a $38.00 bowl of rice. Even though someone else paid for my dinner, I felt cheated!

On a brighter note, the three people in our party that had the Seafood Pasta absolutely raved about their dishes. The four others in the party neither complained  nor expressed anything positive about their meals. 

Finally, Ferraro's does not allow any outside wine. So, if you have a special bottle for a special occasion, plan on going somewhere else!

The best way to sum up Ferraro's is: Michelin-rated prices with Yelp 3 star food.",KvSTWIp4Gjbml8gwcUtKdQ,0,0,2,y-4reQMm99tRq4w3BUwBhw

We arrived early and were immediately met by Mr. Ferraro and Greta. Gino offered us a tour of his kitchen (cleanest kitchen I have ever been in) and wine cellar. During the tour, we got to observe some of his pasta being hand made (daily activity). 

Dinner then started. Our server was Mr. Ferraro's nephew. We were told at the table to not bother with reading the menu, as Mr. Ferraro was preparing everything for us (food and wine selection). After being carefully quizzed about any possible allergies and how we like meat typically prepared, the meal started! 

We enjoyed (4) courses and (2) bottles of wine. The food was absolutely amazing and the wine paired perfectly. As good as the food was, the service exceeded. Each dish was explained to us in detail and there was much follow up asking how we liked the evening. 

I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone visiting the area. It is convenient and easy to get to, and the overall experience is something we will not soon forget.",eCBBZ9vTxQ4O5mJ5T8gB5Q,0,0,5,1KRj8kAs2PcP1nVeyNE6OA

You could easily spend $100 by yourself.  The guy at the table next to us did by ordering a half bottle of wine, crab cakes, osso buco and the crepes for dessert.  He also inhaled the whole damn thing but that's another story....

How can you possibly beat homemade pasta???  You can't.  We opted for the pasta sampler for the appetizer which consisted of gnocchi, ravioli and risotto. I've never had gnocchi so tender.

My wife went with their version of frutti di mare which was amazing and I went with the squid ink pasta w/ clams.  Did I mention how good fresh pasta is???

The waiter even brought us a couple small desserts on the house which consisted of a small tiramisu and cannoli which was really cool of them.

I guess the only thing that would hold me back from coming back here would be the price.  I'd be interested to see how it is for lunch.  I know we'll go back again before the coupon expires.

Wanted to be in Vegas for only an hour and stay out of the fray of the strip without losing the fun and a quick drive down the strip! This was the perfect stop!

First of all, the food is so good and very distinctive with unique ingredients like cucamelons. It's real Italian with hand made pasta and very fresh ingredients. I will not fully review the food, as it's already known for its stellar food, but the caprese salad, lasagna, butter lettuce salad and ravioli were some of the best we've had.

Posting this just in case there are people looking for that Vegas road trip stop without drama, just a little bit off strip (It's across the street from Hard Rock Hotel). At 4pm it was nearly empty and the staff was so attentive and friendly. There's a ton of easy parking. The waitress explained that they get busy in peak season (Jan., convention season) but off-season and before 7:30pm it's easy seating and quick service, without losing the fine dining quality you expect from a night out.

The prices are appropriate to the fresh handmade pasta, location, quality service and atmosphere: $100 for two people with tip.",NhG9YxCxhrkCwZvZtDd-Tg,3,3,5,j4DLdVawXFMtRY2Y-6ICJg
5538011,2015-12-04,1,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Having an Italian born and raised mom makes finding any Italian restaurant off the charts delicious very hard - well I found one. This place was amazing. The ambiance was perfect - the staff was seriously impressive with their service and knowledge. But the food, oh but the food. Keeping with Italian the dishes were simple yet so full of flavor. I started with the pasta fagioli soup - it was made with more of a chicken broth than tomato and the beans were cooked al dente with just the perfect amount of Parmesan to top it off. Although different sauce base than I was used to this light soup will become something I try at home. I couldn't decide between the Chicken Parmesan  or a specialty item a friend was ordering off menu so I lucked out and got my sister to split both with me so I could sample each. Let me tell you the off the menu dish was a pasta carbonara with Italian sausage and was probably one of my favorite dishes I have ever had. I love Italian sausage for all its flavor especially the fennel and spice. This dish enhanced the flavors in the sausage and allowed them to dance beautifully with the light sauce. I paired it with the Martin Ulisse Montepulciano Rose and the fruit of that wine paired beautifully with the spice. The Chicken Parmesan was very good as well and we paired that with the Martin Ulisse Montepulciano Signature Collection which was a nice bit of tannin to compliment the tomato sauce.  My only regret is that no one at the table got the salmon risotto that was a special of the day, I'm sure it would have been rich but based on their skill level I'm sure it would have been fantastic. We finished the meal with some shots of espresso and of course the Pistachio Ice Cream - OMG if you've ever had pistachio ice cream you know it doesn't always have a ton of flavors but this blew away anything I had sampled before. How they managed to get the pistachio to be the soft but sensational star of the show yet not over power the delicate ice cream is beyond me. It was delicious.

The food was average, with the pasta being overcooked. There is a ""local"" discount on some entrees, but they added a service charge (even though it was only a party of 5) that didn't make the discount worthwhile.

Was in the mood for Italian but after reading all of the average reviews for the major hotels on the strip, I decided to venture off the strip and take a chance with this place.  It wasn't too much of a risk since the avg. review was 4 stars.  The restaurant is right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel.  Parking is in the strip mall.  So we didn't have to spend extra on the valet.  Always a plus in my book.  
The restaurant was modern with a classy flare.  Service was fantastic and our server was very helpful in aiding us on our wine selection.  He was very knowledgeable.  They have an extensive wine selection by the glass, half bottle or even sample tastings 1oz, 3oz and 5oz.  
We decided to start with the fritto misto (calamari, zucchini & fennel).  The batter was light and well seasoned.  Not greasy at all.  The marinara sauce that accompanied it was a great compliment.  
I got the 18oz. rib eye medium and the gf got the risotto with truffle and lobster in a cream sauce.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  It had a nice crust and the balsamic glaze made it easier to eat the steak to the finish.  It had a nice burnt crust just like what you get from the grill.  The risotto was al dente and the truffle added a great aroma to the dish.  The recommended wine pairing cut through the creaminess and made it easier to consume.  
I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas.  It's better than most of the restaurants on the strip and the service is not stuffy.",WpCqwLoXyRL8Yx0NbPzxDw,1,0,5,T7JMzwsXgbbjMZRnCNTBdQ
5550026,2011-09-02,3,DESv2ys6SjBKA4SyDtJvxw,"Again - another place in town that I don't understand the hype.  

This was my first meal after doing the Buffet of Buffets Yelp event - and I was really hating food, so this review might be a little biased somewhat.  I am unsure however if I would go back and try it again.

My husband and I had a friend in town, and choose this place to take him to because we were armed with a $50 off certificate from restaurant.com.  We figured for that much, we'd get a lot of food and wine between three people.  Instead, I felt that he prices were really inflated for what we ate and even with the discount, it was one of the most expensive meals I've had in town.  I don't mind paying a ton if the quality is there (see my gushing review for Carnevino), this wasn't really worth it.

This was a few months ago so I don't remember everything we ordered, admittedly.  My husband ordered a simple spaghetti and meatballs, I ordered the Dover Sole, and we had one more entree that escapes me.  But between the three entrees, two salads, and a glass of wine, and with our discount the bill was about $250 dollars which I felt was not real reasonable when I remember all of the meals where I have paid that much.  The quality, while certainly somewhat tasty, it was not remarkable enough to warrant those prices.  

I can think of many other Italian restaurants in town that are equal or surpasses the quality here and is priced much more reasonably.  Don Vito's in South Point, Pasta Shop Ristorante, is another.  And I hate to say it - but Bucca de Beppo and Olive Garden was more preferential to me than eating here.

This might be a good place if you are a tourist, but for the money I would stay on the strip and try some of the high-end Italian places like Bartolotta, Sinatra's, Rao's, or Nove.  You'll pay in the same range as Ferraro's but have a much more satisfying experience.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,12,2,2,F7BdBXwnxLlouoCNpmUFig

After a long day of sightseeing, sometimes, the last thing you want is another club sandwich or late night pancake special. There's those times when the only thing that can satisfy you is the taste of a home-cooked meal. When that craving hits, head to Ferraro's Italian Restaurant and Wine Bar, conveniently located across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. 

A family-owned Las Vegas institution since 1985, Ferraro's features elegant yet hearty Italian fare. Owned by native Calabrian, Gino Ferraro, and run by his family and Tuscan-trained son, Mimmo, Ferraro's has a taste of Italy you can't get find anywhere else in Las Vegas.

Along with an extensive wine cellar, and Safe Harbor Certified seafood, Ferraro's boasts of house-made, fresh pasta, along with house-made bread and desserts. Also available are whole-wheat and gluten-free pasta.

With a lunch menu that features Salmon Pesto and Chicken Marinara for less than $10, as well as an assortment of salads, pizzas and Panini for less than $15 - their lunch specials are some of the best you can get for the money.

Ferraro's features two distinct happy hours - one at 4-7 p.m. which features a special menu and 25% off drinks. Ferraro's Late Night features 50% off the regular dinner menu from 11 p.m. - 2 a.m. For less than a show ticket, a late night feast for two, featuring an appetizer, entrée and drinks awaits. The deal is incredible. 

Highly suggested are the incredible Nonna's Stuffed Peppers, which are easily a meal in themselves, and the house-made Gnocchi Bolognese.

Friend arrived in town with a recommendation for Ferraro's. I had been here for happy hour before and had no complaints, so we thought we'd try dinner.

The service was very very bad. We were greeted by a grump and it all went downhill from there. We had to go to the bar to get our water glasses refilled - more than once. The waiter took our order, our desert order and brought the tab. Other than that, we never saw him. For our party of six, we were brought two spoons for the creme brûlée desert, which we had informed our waiter we would be sharing. There was no inquiry as to whether any after dinner drinks were desired. We got up to find additional spoons on other tables.

Fine dining, this is not.

Now to the food. It was absolutely flavorless. And we had to get up to find salt and pepper in an attempt to make it edible.

The tomatoes in the Caprese salad were not even ripe. The ""Cesar"" salad dressing was blah. We actually all left food on our plates and that is a rarity for this group.

The two highlights were the grilled octopus appetizer and the pesto dipping oil for the bread. (We drizzled that stuff all over everything so we could eat it.)

On top of it all, tip was automatically entered and we were planning to leave only 5% for the bus help and servers benefit.

Avoid this place and go to Pasta Ristorante in Henderson instead.",G1e6UEGRWQiyCQW5mqGFZQ,2,0,1,yqj6qFA2clauHfwkoAaZww

Part of the trip took us to Las Vegas, NV where we had dinner on 17 April at Ferraro's Italian Restaurant.  WOW we were so glad we did. The menu selection was vast, the wine selection amazing.  Our waiter was Eric.  To start off ordered a bottle of wine.  Always a good way to begin a dinner.  Next was a Classic Caesar Salad for each of us.   My wife and I are retired, and have had many Caesar Salads over the years, and we both agreed this was the best salad we have ever had anywhere!!   Amazingly fresh and tasteful, and the presentation was superb!  

For the main dish my wife had LASAGNA ALLA GINO...with house made pasta, Bolognese sauce, Bechamel sauce with ricota cheese and tomato sauce.   I had the RIGATONI CALABRESI....with house made rigatoni pasta, rapini, house made Calabrese sausage, Calabrese peppers, cannellini beans, olive oil, garlic  Both dishes were amazingly good.  Excellent from the first bite to the last!!

Eric was our waiter and we could not have been more pleased...for sure!   He did an OUTSTANDING from beginning to end.  He shared with us a lot about the history of the restaurant, and its owner, the menu items, and chatted a bit about our trip.  Excellent service though out our dining experience.  I learned that he is a golfer and lived in Portland, OR.  Which was a surprise since my wife and I worked in Portland for many many years (lived in Vancouver, WA)  He shared that he played gold at Camas Meadows GC  which is where I have played many times.  He was the best!!!

If you like great Italian food, good wine, and superb service, then this is a must place to visit.  Oh yeah, it is not in one of the casinos ....which is a plus for sure!",9PaY3szh25JOCf9E9BFBwg,1,0,5,EeaAsKBGH6YQ3dlnWurDdw

The food was good and authentic, but way over priced. I have ate at many places that have better and more authentic food in Vegas. You do pay for the ""wine bar""atmosphere. Very nice place, elegant, but a little too snooty for my liking. Italians are some if the most welcoming people and I like to get an Italian atmosphere when I pay as much as I did.

I stumbled across this swanky Italian joint as there was a huge, yellow banner advertising their $9.95 lunch specials. I made a sharp right and decided to give it a shot.

I had heard about this place and had basically wrote it off because I have heard how expensive their dinner menu is (that holds true and I still wouldn't ever be able to come for dinner) but that's why I was delighted when I saw a lunch banner. You can choose from 3 different pasta selections that rotate daily as well as your choice of a cup of soup or salad for $9.95. I'm in!

Now did the food hold up to this Italian girl's high standards?

The answer is yes, yes, yes. I was given a bread basket to start with rolls nestled warmly in a blanket accompanied by a stained glass-like painting of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. These scrumptious little pillows held my anxious stomach at bay until my main dish arrived. Fettuccini alfredo with grilled chicken....ahhh.

The luncheon prices were actually a bit low for the quality and quantity of the food. I started with a lovely glass of prosecco. The complimentary house bread is available in white or black olive. My main course was a delicious pollo milanese with arugula salad. The only small hitch was that it was served with a pasta that contained an ingredient to which I am allergic. We had mentioned this to the waiter several times, but it wasn't a serious matter since the pasta was on the side. Actually, we were surprised when we saw the pasta on the plate because it was a lot of food for only $10. My companion quite enjoyed the penne bolognese which was also $10.

The next night we returned with friends, but found the restaurant quite crowded, so we ate at the bar where a full menu is served. The bartender checked twice to make sure that I could have the shrimp and bean appetizer. It might have been the best thing that I ate during our stay in Vegas.

The pizza was a 6 slice 9 inch personal pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mearballs - the crust was thin enough to be crispy and thick enough to be pizza crust and not a cracker. The ravioli were delicious, but there were only 2 - the light sauce and thin pasta were excellent, and I could have eaten 10 or 20 of them. The gnocci were light and airy with a gutsy sauce. All of the sauces were delicious, and all were different savory delights. All of the food was served hot. We both were delighted to share the pistachio creme dessert. It was light and creamy and served cold (one of my pet peeves is when you order a cold dessert and it is lukewarm or frozen when it's served) - not too sweet, and really delicious. The service was excellent, and the piano player/singer  music a real treat. Definitely try this gem for a night out that is classy.",47We7Jq06tuYtnGzaMCdmQ,1,1,5,S5rbtDqh1hfLckTOt2Tb6g

The food was authentic, creative and delicious!
Service was off the charts!
They have wine flights, tastings and pairings. Their lunch and late menus are a super value.
I was saying at the Hyatt across the street a s wandered into the place and was VERY pleasantly surprised. Great wine list too!
Happy Foodie, I'm coming back!",iyZRVesDBcV-lm56-_7MRw,1,1,5,Dfo_FlSqypzrvtimd6UgUw
