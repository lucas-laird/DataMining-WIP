I inhaled my cheeseburger and half my fries when my supposedly little cousin inhaled his burgers and both of our chili-fries. burger is ok but the hotdogs are really good. I'm craving it right now.

They are open pretty late for a late night snack. I always go to the one on st rose parkway!",3yPrXlvbECGKHSZTy9usWA,1,1,4,TUsk_60lKOWqGsqdsw_vyg
