The girl that finally took my order 16 minutes after I got behind 2 people who only ordered simple combo meals. She tells me that it's basically always like this. The manager who doesn't seem to care has been sitting in the dining area doing nothing the whole time. I will never be coming here again and I hate myself for waiting 16 minutes to order. Stay far away from this specific location. 
Took 35 minutes to finally get the food after walking in. They did provide me with a free unsolicited drink while I waited which was nice and extra piece of chicken they told me.

She then says due to the long wait she is giving us a discount on our food. We hear her tell her crew our order se hands is our order and says sorry again. We get home the order is completely wrong we call back and speak with her on the phone she sounds just as disappointed as us that the order was not right and apologized again and took my name and advised when we come back she will make our order again. Fast forward to today July 10th we advise the people at the window. Our order was going to be replaced they asked us to pull to the window the manager (now forgive me because I am probably spelling it wrong) Klyshaun greeted us with a smile apologized again and went over our order with us again and made sure it was correct!

At any rate we ordered an 8 piece spicy chicken only meal. The clerk, in pigeon English says ""we ain't got no spicy wing"" so we say ""ok fill the box.""

On the way home the car started to have a burned smell to the point I thought it was overheating. Well, it turns out that the chicken was so burned that it stunk up the car. When we got home, the chicken looked all withered and dark brown. One bite of breast demonstrated that it was severely burned. We had to throw the entire box of chicken in the dumpster.

I ordered my daughter a shrimp box with a side of mashed potatoes. Watched the young boy bag a canister that I assumed was mashed potatoes and stick it in a bag. A woman seemed to be double checking the order (she did a horrible job) as she opened the lid, looked inside, shook her head and walked down a little ways like she was going to change whatever was in the container. Instead she paused and then just walked back to the bag and stuck it in. That tells me she knew it was wrong. So instead of fixing the order she just handed it to me. I tried calling when I got home but it just rang and rang. Basically the food we got was fine, but not what I paid for and it was completely disappointing.

My first job at 16 was at a grocery store bagging groceries but I desperately wanted to work at Popeyes.  Every time I move, i dont tell anyone but Popeyes has a role in my moving process - I need to be within striking I mean driving distance to my spicy chicken.

So this is currently the closest Popeyes to my house and it is the worse Popeyes I have ever had.  I've been here about 30+ times and probably 1/3 of the time they bait and switch me.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.   i ask for spicy and they give me the mild.  And it's not fresh out of the fryer mild.  It's the mild that no one orders - that gets dried up over time.  I should report their store manager.  I think he/she tells his staff to purposefully serve the mild chicken especially if you go through the drive through.....And why do they even offer mild here?  The mild is the worse fast food chicken...it's even worse than KFC.

Anyhow despite the fact I am let down 1/3 of the time i always come back.  Popeyes is part of my life and always will be.   There's Raising Canes - far superior but I have life long memories of Popeyes.  Maybe i'll now be forced to drive a few miles further to 215/Rainbow but till then i'll return here and cross my fingers I get my spicy chicken.",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,4,2,2,O6YkGVB5Yw3ctSLFx_J-Gg

They have a leg and thigh Tuesday special but it no longer comes with the biscuit. Sad face.  Make sure you order biscuits in their buttery goodness with grape jelly.  I like mine with local honey.

Last time was over a 15 minute wait which caused myself and multiple cars to leave the drive thru. This time was not that long of a wait to order. But after I ordered I was told it would be a 10 minute wait for the chicken. Whatever I already waited in line and I was too tired to go elsewhere. Got home and got a tinkle of fries. I will give them credit maybe they're concerned for my health?

Putting the icing on top, I've never had anything but outstanding service from the employees. Today, they forgot to put a spork in my bag for the mash potatoes (simple mistake, not a big deal!) so I waited until someone came back to the window, before I left to ask for one. The kind lady who came back to the window had a big smile, apologized, and even gave me an apple pie. I'm not one to take advantage of others or businesses, but even after refusing the apple pie, she said, ""oh no! I'm giving you the apple pie for having to wait! :)"" I wish I had asked this kind lady what her name was, but I completely spaced doing so. In a world where genuine customer service is becoming more rare, this was a really refreshing experience, and I would like give all the workers at this Popeyes a huge thumps-up!",uGgglB7pQeXKwFOI_pXvYA,0,0,5,nNSvDjD5IR361HtOYVxiyA
5771328,2016-12-23,0,mAIPUQPJiWXudRbOaBX33g,"This Popeye's is the WORST in town. The staff are rude, thoughtless and careless & customer service sucks. The management couldn't care less about the customers. 

The only reason we've gone back is because we have guests in town for the holidays; they love Popeye's but it's not available in their area. So we've eaten Popeye's 4 times in 11 days. There has been a problem with our order EVERY single time. Wrong side orders - how do you confuse red beans & rice with coleslaw? Wrong drinks. Worst of all, we always order the 12-piece family meal. Now, there should be 3 breasts, 3 wings, 3 legs & 3 thighs; everyone knows that. We never get that in our order. Strangely, there is always only ONE BREAST. 

My husband believes that the store is cheating the customers with cheaper pieces of meat instead of providing the expensive breasts, which are being turned into the 'boneless wings' which are clearly white meat. I think the staff is improperly trained & can't tell the difference between a breast & a thigh, because we generally get 4 of those or 3 or 4 legs or wings.

We've talked to staff, we've spoken to management we've expected the problems to be remedied - an extra side, replace the missing pieces of chicken, even a simple 'We're sorry', but we've gotten nothing. 

The food is delicious & we'll continue to buy it but we'll be driving the twenty minutes each way to go to the second closest Popeye's store to us.",lNKGOFyGDVjUKsmnC1r3cg,0,0,1,earfOyRIPKhl0Em6tazdhQ

The previous reviews for this location are CORRECT! It's dirty, so don't plan on dining in. Which makes you wonder how clean it could be where the food is being made. Service is SLOW and orders are filled out of order, so a lot of frustrated people standing around. 

Not only is the customer service horrible (the biscuit Nazi kid was super rude while taking our order and would not allow a biscuit to be considered a side dish. Other locations don't have a problem with it) our basic order was wrong (ordered chicken strips, 2 out of 3 chicken strip orders came out with fried chicken with bones instead of strips and the biscuits were hard and cold). Unfortunately, they handled it like they didn't care and we did not want to wait for chicken strips to be made. We rarely grab fast food, and won't be returning to this place ever again.",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,1,1,1,OPAfPKC-bOmTb8NDH8KNJg

She put my order on hold to keep her drive thru times down. I was ordering for a family and the drive thru was a single to go order; pray tell which one should be more important?
