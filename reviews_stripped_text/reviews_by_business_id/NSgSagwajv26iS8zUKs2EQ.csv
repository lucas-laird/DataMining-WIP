The food is amazing I tried the Ahi Tuna Tacos and the Chicken nachos both were full of flavor and reasonably priced compared to other vegas restaurants.

As for service, It was awesome!  like I said they have really pretty girl servers in cocktail dresses who were super nice and got my order out quick and correct and made the whole experience at this bar very pleasant! 

Another thing I like about this bar is located just inside The Golden Nugget by the Shark aquarium pool So you get away from the casino atmosphere and can have a booth looking out towards the pool!
I give this place 5 stars!",Bx8Z6pUQmxR_VPAFV7H_zw,3,0,5,s1450pOByJW8KjexugG1_w

Mine was as spicy as my husband's, who requested his that way. I had sausage with my breakfast and it tasted like a hot dog. My husband ordered the omelet with chorizo in it. It looked like a hot dog and tasted nothing like chorizo. The manager came to our table and asked how things were and my husband mentioned how he had asked for chorizo and not gotten it. She responded that it was ""sausage patty chorizo and they just cut it up"".

Service here was ok.  Our waitress could have come over to check on us a few more times.  I realize it was a bit busy for happy hour but when you are eating something spicy, your drink tends to run out quickly!

It was also nice to have a choice of a high table or to sit on a couch with a coffee table.  TV's can be seen from anywhere making it a hotspot to be during certain games (this mens if a big game in on, you wont be able to get in).

2505288,2016-08-03,0,NSgSagwajv26iS8zUKs2EQ,"I'm going to try and be accurate and choose my words carefully.  Being a Mexican, I certainly didn't expect this to be authentic and I was correct. The food is similar to an El Torito or that type of Mexican food, but its what we expected. My husband and I both ordered margarita rocks, the drinks came in glasses that looked like they should hold a hot fudge sundae instead of alcohol, but that could have been excused if the drink was good. The margarita was so sweet we had to order a separate shot to lessen the sweet, and when we got the bill, that one tiny shot cost more than the entire margarita and it was only house tequila, which just tells me how little tequila was actually in the drink. OK, on to  my next complaint. I had a combo plate which included a chicken taco and enchilada, rice and beans. The taco shell was a pre-formed shell similar to Taco Bell's cheapest dollar menu taco, except Taco Bell adds way more filling, this taco was so measly, at least El Torito fries their own shells, it was ridiculous. 

The other complaint with my meal was presentation. It seemed just slapped together, the rice came on my plate, but the re-fried beans came in a little dish on the side. There was no shredded lettuce or guacamole or sour cream, nothing, just blah. My husband had the same complaint with his meal, average taste, like a chain restaurant, but nothing else on the plate. My last complaint is that they don't serve complimentary chips and salsa. That's usually a given at Mexican restaurants, but not this place. We  are members of Landry's select club and all Golden Nuggett restaurants are included, so when you dine at one they send you a survey to complete and I didn't exactly give rave reviews, but I'm being honest, presentation is everything when the food is mediocre. Well apparently the manager saw my review and chose to phone me at 8AM that next morning to find out why, the only problem was that we were on vacation and obviously stayed out very late the night before because its Las Vegas, so when the blasting cell rang, I jumped out of bed and basically blasted the manager for calling me so early. Needless to say he was sorry and said he would phone me back later, but never did. I should have called him back to explain, but I just let it go.

On happy hour you can get beers for $3-4 and margaritas for $4!! I recommend the peach margarita. Very tasty! And if fruit flavored isn't you style they can do drinks on the rocks or frozen as well. 

Also on the happy hour menu is a combo plate of salsa, guac, and queso. The queso is the star here and reminds me of my time spent in Austin, TX. It is not too runny, nor too gooey, but a perfect texture that sticks your chips. It is also not too spicy, but provides enough heat to be memorable. I can also recommend the quesadilla and the taco's. The quesadilla is a bit small, but enough to share with another person. And the tacos are similar to small street tacos, and can be ordered with chicken, steak, or carnitas. 

My favorite dish here is the Rellano de Camaron. This is a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, onion, cilantro, salsa, and cheese. I get this every time I go and would highly recommend this. The pairing of the pepper with the shrimp is perfect!! We have also tried the fajitas and the Tacos al Carbon- which are fajita style chicken already placed into tacos for you. The Fajitas come out on a steaming hot plate and served over a bed of onions. The smell is amazing!

If you like Elote (street corn) then order it here. My wife can't get enough! Super authentic! 

If it is your first time here I would start with the happy hour. You get a better deal on drinks but you can still order from the main menu.",-Fb4gB1z0OKuo42NOoX9pQ,0,0,5,IjlQbtNoJSluT4i3mqO87w

So bartender gets a no salt order and makes with salt. I get it, it happens.

The Relleno de Camerones is not like it used to be. I will not order it again. It came out somewhat warm and the poblano pepper was not roasted enough so it tasted raw. I am certain the staff at night rushes the food verses making it to standard. I know that Edna rang in no rice, it came out with it.

We went to yelp to read reviews, and seeing the poor ratings of the nearby sushi place, we went to this place with a solid 4 star rating. 

This is the best choice I have ever made.

We sat down, and we're promptly greeted by our very fast and patient server, named Brianna. I ordered us the chips with salsa and guacamole. I have always hated guac, and refuse avacado laced foods. Today however, I enjoyed a good portion of their guac. But I am a true salsa fan, and their chipotle dipping salsa exceeded all expectations. Pleasingly spicy, and very hearty and fresh. Their excellent chips and dip appetizer can not be over stated, and they arrived as quickly as our drinks. 

The tacos we ordered were excellent. We had the tuna tacos, which were excellent (once we removed the ginger, personal preference). I had the carnitas tacos myself, and found the salsa served with it to be a perfect medium salsa heat, a truly excellent taco experience. 

And just when I thought it was over,, I inquired of dessert. Of which I was told they had only one thing. She described them as some sort of sweet puff, so I said sure and ordered it. Surely if they have only one dessert, it must be both very fresh and great tasting.

My guess was rewarded by the best Mexican dessert I've ever had. I can only describe it as sweet pita bread, coated in sugar like a churro. Served with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and a sliced up strawberry. This dessert found its way into the hands of everyone who assured me they were full before.

Both times we split appetizers which had large portions. We had the chips with salsa & queso and a chicken quesadilla. As far as cocktails, we enjoyed their house margaritas and Vegas tea. We did order their 45 oz Cadillac Punch which tasted good but at $20, we thought we would have at least gotten a buzz.

This is a joint, after all, that offers pints of decent beers for $3 (!!!) between 4:00 and 7:00 Monday to Friday. I mean, who can resist that?

So we tried the Cantina Beef Nachos (""Cheddar cheese and chips with spicy beef, refried 
beans, jalapeños, pico de gallo and guacamole"") and I'll admit these are much better than your typical cheap nachos. The cheese is plentiful, while the spicy beef and other toppings are generously peppered throughout. The dish is maybe not quite as heavy on the nachos as one might've liked - we would often wipe out the entire plate in less than five minutes - but you just can't go wrong with the $6.99 price tag.

We also tried the Cantina Chicken Nachos (""Monterey Jack cheese and chips with grilled 
chicken, refried beans, jalapeños, pico de gallo and guacamole"") and they too were quite tasty, although I'm not sure how well the Monterey Jack cheese worked. (Cheddar seems like a better option.)

The service was admittedly not the best - it would take a while for the waitress to make her presence known, which got frustrating when one was waiting to order another cheap beer - but overall I'd say this is a decent joint that I'd visit quite often if I lived in Vegas.",iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ,1,0,4,P7uGPC5YiMwy04bdF6x3Ew

Second, my cousin ordered a glass of sangria and not only was it terrible, they charged her $14 for it instead of $6 like the menu says. When she questioned the waitress she got super rude about it. In the end the manager adjusted the price but it left a negative impression on both of us.

4670142,2014-08-08,1,NSgSagwajv26iS8zUKs2EQ,"This is a restaurant having an identity crisis if there ever were one.  It's a Mexican (food) restaurant with the TV's of a sports bar, night club tables and chairs to ensure eating is uncomfortable and blaring classic rock (when I was there).  Service was also poor, but it was mid-afternoon on a Monday so perhaps I just hit it at a bad time.

Anyway, we'll go through all of the above one item at a time.

Food: my party of five had fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, and wings.  Two people in the party wanted burritos, but this Mexican restaurant has no burritos.... huh?  The food that they do serve was not bad; Americanized 'Mexican' but it was pretty reasonable in portions, taste and price.  Everyone was satisfied.  The chips and salsa were the highlight though; they had several options and the chips were hot.  Those stand out in my memory more than the run of the mill food.

Seating: there is one high top, you should fight for it if you want to eat.  The rest of the place are low couches surrounding low tables so everyone can awkwardly hunch over to eat and spill things everywhere.  It's like they had some leftover night club seating so decided to re-use it.

TV's:  they are everywhere.  There is also a sports news and scores ticker that runs the length of the place.  I guess they figure everyone in Vegas wants sports scores 24x7 so they did their best to make it look like a sports book.

Music: nope, not Mexican, it was best of the 70's and 80's classic rock when we were there.

BOOZE!!  Tried their original margarita, cadillac margarita and barrel aged margarita.  All were pretty light on the tequila and pretty heavy on the mixers.  We all gave up on trying to get drunk off their margaritas or we'd have ended up in a diabetic seizure.  The ""Vegas Tea"", which is really just a long island with a dumb name, is much better.  It's a pretty large glass of reasonably strong long island; we were all happy with those.

The place could really improve if it switched to music that matched the theme, pour the margaritas properly (use Hussong's Cantina at Mandalay as an example) and added burritos.  Seating, whatever, is what it is and I'll eat and booze somewhere I like regardless of seating.",vhMMA4vymXwtoTbIrD1g6A,4,1,2,IJ1S30z5YADsPUlcCGu5xA

After a night strolling around Fremont street, we landed at the Golden Nugget's pool lounge chairs staring at the fish tank. I wanted to relax and chill so twas a perfect place.to do such. 

I began craving a margarita and with Cadillac conveniently located to the right of the pool's main door entrance, why not. 

We were.immediately greeted by our hostess turned waitress. She offered us a table.or the couches. We opted for the couches. We knew we weren't getting anything serious since we were spending hours of drinking here and there.

The couches are.seated right at the entrance so it wasn't much of a walk in. The place itself was very dark, however, their walls lined of flat screens and tickers which helps illuminate the restaurant. It isn't a big place at all. Somehow I memorized their maximum seating capacity is 137. When we were there around 9pm, there was a good amount of people eating and drinking at their bar. Mostly depressed looking couples  with the exception of us. Lol. 

I had their Cadillac Margarita which is the one served with the 1800 tequila. We also ordered just the chips and salsa. The chips were way better than the salsa as the salsa had no flavor. Seriously. I've never had bland salsa in my life until this night. Twas 5.99 for that and 10 bucks for my small.glass of margarita. The bartender definitely made the tequila evident in my drink, but at 10bucks...I would've been able to enjoy a bigger glass that wouldve last me longer at the same quality elsewhere. 

Perhaps that's why everyone looked depressed. If the salsa is a sample.of what their food may taste like...I'd look depressed too. Even our waitress didn't seem too enthusiastic. I usually advise anyone to give a place a try,but there are sooooo many options in the vicinity...I'd say skip it. Sorry. =S",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,3,4,2,P8Ejb6MjcD44CioL8xB9hg

We were a bit early for lunch so we waited while they finished setting up and got seated pretty much at 11am on the nose. 

We ordered quickly with my partner choosing the chicken fajitas and I requesting cheese enchiladas with a red sauce of some kind. We also each ordered a specialty margarita as there were several interesting flavours kinds available! Sizzling fajitas came out quick and my enchiladas arrived with beans and rice on the side as well, so there was definitely a lot of food to go around. 

The margaritas were delicious and strong, the food was delicious, and holy geez, the sauce was SPICY. It was a lot hotter than I was expecting, and I honestly can't remember if I'd specified the heat level, but never have I encountered enchilada sauce that hot before! I managed to work my way through most of it, but I did chug my way through the tequila pretty quick. 

It was a pretty good lunch and we had no complaints. Service was fast and it was what we were looking for after just arriving at Fremont, being slightly delicate after a day of hangover recovery and needing some good solid food to get started on exploring the less fancy side of Vegas. The price is a bit more on the upper end of Fremont prices but well within reason if you're coming from the Strip.",kk2oFTBSU9C2XshIVU7tXQ,2,1,4,UXcON9oovWRxv4Dq6pzCrQ

Edna and Binay  and even the chef Raul have gone above and beyond to meet my dietary restrictions and deliver exceptional food and service .   We have now eaten here twice since getting here and the food is amazing .  Some of the best salsa I've ever had and I'm Mexican !  Keep up the good work !,ee6GRZbJdu41SF2jmb9c_Q,0,0,5,srNmVBGj9dNS-NwMWb5LVA
5659861,2014-06-19,5,NSgSagwajv26iS8zUKs2EQ,"Can people stop bringing their kids to bars? For real, there was a gaggle of 5 girls under the age of 13 and a GIANT baby stroller with a baby crawling on the seats of this bar when Ife A. and I went here for dinner on 6/13/14. Unfortunately they came in and were seated after we were already here.

So let me just get this out of the way, a sports bar, with few actual tables, and seating more like a night club, is NO place for kids. I don't care if it's 7 PM, get your kids out of this bar. And bar owners, do not let kids into this place. Some places aren't kid friendly, and your customers don't want to be surrounded by a gaggle of kids. 

This place is SO loud you have to scream to have a conversation because TVs line the perimeter of this place. Food, is just whatever. I had the tortilla soup, Ife had some sort of expensive enchiladas that she said weren't good. My soup was fine, but it was simply a bowl of soup for $7. 

There's no chips, no extras whatsoever which I find strange for a bar. Chips and salsa is $4. Don't they want you to eat salty foods to get you thirsty so you'll buy more drinks? Am I the only one who has heard of this tactic is the food industry? Ugh.

I told Ife that I felt like I was eating on my couch because you have to either hold your food in your lap or awkwardly eat over a coffee table.

The fact that there was a parade of kids in this place totally turned me off from coming here again.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,8,5,2,P_4gNQ8oDr6VXHWucvCF0Q

Portion was smaller than the average Mexican restaurant but was one of the best fajitas I ever had.  My companion had the ahi tuna tacos and loved them.  Sangria not the greatest I ever had, but ambiance was nice, excellent spot to watch all sports/games, service by Ruby was great!",1A-qx244tLoFo4AdT-xAQQ,0,0,5,jzOJMKycFRbOuzkzFQFIjA

The margaritas weren't all that good, so we ordered beer for the rest of the meal. Service was good, and the queso we ordered came out quickly. We ended up ordering chicken fajitas and split them between the two of us. Everything tastes alright, and our waitress was very attentive.",KHpL8YLZ_mYy-WtqqICgWQ,1,0,4,K6kkVZQ8iDl491A4y8hpFQ

We waited 20 minutes to order drinks while the waitress ignored us and took orders from people that arrived after us. I got her attention and said we hadn't been helped and she walked right by me. We decided to order our food from the bartender. She was really cool about it and the drinks and appetizer were really tasty. The waitress just walked by us again, though. She missed out on the nice tip we gave the bartender.",-wE8vpFmsvIwcbD9j-mUrQ,0,0,2,hBo7t7ncx5EyfkJnw0bDWg

Our bartender was more like a guide explaining when the restaurant opened and the different options. It really turned our weekend's experiences around as we had pretty bad food in Downtown that weekend. 

Chicken tortilla soup was really good. I asked for no cheese,  but it still came out with some. It didn't ruin it though. Margaritas were good too.",A-5jm-xU47BHYVZi-YFmog,2,1,4,s8FZESF1mDRCsPR2k7qwPg

The squad and I were lucky enough to get 4 bar seats since it was super busy. Though it was busy and the Niners got their butts beat by the Seahawks, the service from our bartender/server was amazing. The prices are typical hotel resteraunt prices, but it wasn't too bad for what they had going for them.
To drink I ended up getting a Cadillac margarita and the barrel aged tequila. Both were deliciously crafted and definitely on the stronger side. Everything looked delicious on the menu, but I ended up going for the Mexican burger. This monster of a burger comes with a beef patty, chorizo, bacon, roasted peppers, onions, jalapeño cheese, lettuce, avocado, pico de gallo, chipotle mayonnaise a side of steak fries. DELICIOUSLY EPIC BURGER!!! Seriously one of my favorite burgers ever! Overall, if you're in Downtown Vegas you must check out their drinks and food, but especially the burger.",78c_llOEjlJ5lW35bL137w,5,5,5,pj0UrFYVDOJmiiKs4YpiUA
