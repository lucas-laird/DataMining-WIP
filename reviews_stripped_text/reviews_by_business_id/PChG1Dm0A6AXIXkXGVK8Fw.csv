A regular. 
I will never go again!!! First of all waitress both of them were drunk or on something 
I was ignored sat myself down they took 30 min to notice us I stood up to grab my own menus!?!?  they didn't take our order due to the fact that they were busy taking shots and drinking beer..... Employees wasted on the job. 
And i asked for my check they ignored us 3 times, I could have walked out with out paying... 
Then to top off the night, I was walking out waitress threw up outside in front of the restaurant..... 
It was really bad, I never ever review any business and this was just so disappointing.

I'm totally cool with mistakes were all human but it was almost like they were doing it on purpose? It wasn't just one thing it was numerous things like placing a tempura shrimp in a hand roll with the tail pointing up in the first bite what really? The octopus was so thick it couldn't be chewed literally had to spit out in my napkin (the ones I usually have to go in the back to get myself, on more than one occasion) Then we ordered a couple of special items (they made us these dishes on their own for us to try when we were trying this place out) fail. If you make someone something special to try and they like it, and they order again and again and then it's not the same or even close to all the other times ... What changed? People like consistency We were so disappointed. FOH servers are below average, it's like they do the bare minimum I've seen tables leave due to lack of attention, there is no consistency here.

We drop $75-80 for two AYCE  that always included 20% tip! We never overstay or overheat and are pretty low maintenance. So now we have to find a new place to drop that money. 

I love it when people break up and say it's not you, it's me. In this case it's you!

My fiancé and myself decided to dine in at the sushi bar and do all you can eat for lunch. Not knowing the new staff  on board i gave it a try. 

Our chef was Nick and let me tell you he is one proud sushi chef! there was not one roll he made that did not impress not only my fiancé but my taste buds as well. We tried rolls we never even herd of and would of probably never even ordered and with out a doubt left us wanting more. There was no need for us to even look at the menu. He knew exactly what to make to keep our taste buds happy. The combinations of not just only his rolls were impeccable but also his other sushi dishes as well. Letting him make and show us his culinary skills was by far the best idea we had that day with out a doubt 

One of the perks that came with all you can eat was the sake! 
The staff was great and welcoming. The place looked nice and comfy with a clean environment.

My stomach got very upset and I started vomiting. This went on all night to the point I had to call in sick to work. I'm guessing it was the ikura nigiri I had ordered since my bf did not eat it and he was fine. I did not eat or drink anything other than water after we dined there so it was definitely the ikura gone bad. Sad to say we thought we found a decent AYCE sushi place but we will not be returning.

Customer service was terrible. Once the food was delivered no one ever came by the table to see if we needed anything nor to refill drinks. There being only three tables in the whole restaurant, the other two just waiting on checks.
To top that off, their register broke and it took half an hour for checks to be made.. They even had their owner come  to the restaurant and he only agreed to a discount after a disgruntled table were stuck there due to no check and no explanation..

I've honestly never experienced such poor customer service.. I understand if a register breaks but there are easy ways to appease customers and none of those methods were employed..

Friends and I thought we would try a new sushi place near by but that seemed to have been a mistake. Showed up at about 8:45 and by the time we were there, they claimed to have ran out of salmon skin rolls (they only told us after we waited about 15 minutes and asked about it) and different ice cream flavors. When we're paying the price for all you can eat, I would expect to get everything I wanted... especially when the menu doesn't have much to offer compared to all the other all you can eat sushi places. A couple other things too... one of the male waiters seemed a bit rude and we felt rushed when we were putting orders in and our waters were refilled only when we were sucking nothing but drips of water through the straws.

Better TV programming, I love eating sushi and watching sporting events. You could get a better selection of channels. Especially sports obviously, once that occurs you could get one or two reasonable sized televisions. Considering football season is about to begin that will be a major draw for fans of the game and sushi. Just a suggestion.

 Now on to the food! The rolls were different than what I've had at other Sushi bars, but to be honest, I enjoyed that. We both ordered the AYCE, which by the way includes 5 pieces of sashimi. Haven't been to a place that includes that with your AYCE! We started out with the Tracy II, which was pretty good. I kind of lost track of the rolls after that point. Oh I did enjoy the texture of the Lisa Lisa. Ended with the Sasa and Alex's Munchie rolls. Both were delicious! 
 The staff were extremely nice and one of the waiters even asked us if this was out first time here. He was very informative about the menu.

Nothing is worse than paying $60 to get sick.

Took some friends and their small children to dinner and was told they have a kid's price for AYCE. When our chef, Arnold, saw that the kids really didn't eat that much, the bill was adjusted to a much lower price.......a gesture that will not be forgotten.

My wife has unique dietary needs, they were more then happy to leave out sauces and ingredients that she's sensitive to which i'm sure is a total PITA.

Can't stress enough that I think the fish is on par with a good non-AYCE place. Drinks are never empty and dishes were cleared quickly.

Since nothing is perfect, I will comment that after the change in owners and the remodel, one prominent wall was left mostly a plain white; in dire need of some beautiful themed paintings...........like maybe some Christian Lassen works.

I was however sad because one, i'm used to have having nearly 2 full pages of sushi options, and this time i had about 6/7 of one page. Not to mention nearly everything was a bit too sweet for my tastes and the spicy options werent exactly bursting with flavor. Not to mention the red bean ice cream which is my favourite ice cream wasn't all that great. Aside from that though the sushi was pretty good, it tasted fresh and was good quality.

Our mussels took 30 minutes. Had to ask for refills on Sake and beer 3 times. I was LESS than impressed with the dynamite and eel sauce.

Manny & Donald are great! They know exactly what we like & don't like & most of the time, will have already prepared our orders before we tell them what we want. They are fantastic! If anyone ever asks me for a recommendation, I ALWAYS refer them here. 

The only reason I am not giving Sasa a full 5-star review is because of the wait staff (especially Erin in particular). In the year & a half we have been dining here, I have never once seen him smile. He walks up to customers with a very sour expression & a clear vibe of disinterest. He never comes to refill you drinks, unless you flag him down (I have actually walked my cup up to him before & asked for a refill), he never remembers to bring us lemons for our water, he slides/slams our plates down in front of us, never says excuse me, & constantly complains about everything. My boyfriend & I have said to the other staff, more than once, ""if he is so unhappy, why hasn't he just quit already?!""

Other than his bad attitude, this place is the best. You can't beat the AYCE prices, the atmosphere & the delicious fish! My love for this place is far greater than my hatred for the poor server.",1uqvx5F547clKSyUZpMMhA,0,0,4,1MaejeUqQVIWaJR3K_cA9w

We stood in the door waiting to be seated for over 10 minutes even though only 2 tables in the whole place had people to serve, and there was 8 staff not assisting us (2 at sushi bar, 6 chatting together ignoring their jobs).  I ordered and so did my kids.  Despite asking for chopsticks, a fork, water, and napkins at least 6 times in 30 mins & not being able to eat this whole time because we didn't have stuff to eat the food with (we had cooked food, soup, and sushi) or drinks, we got most of it ourselves because they openly and rudely ignored us and attempts to get their attention.  When we did get the waters we were constantly out of water to drink (cup was 90% ice and had little water to begin with when they brought to us), we sipped ice cubes for relief because despite the fact there was more than enough staff, they were too busy chatting about their personal life issues.  They actually looked at us, then ignored our arms in the air trying to wave them over or even when we got up and asked for service!  The soup was good but is was mostly liquid and not much content in it so not filling at all, the meat was overcooked to almost beyond eating (think dried jerky meat), and the sushi was good quality cut meat but warm.  At the end of the meal a nice man joined us from returning from his break and relieved who we had.  He more than tried to make up for things, but by then (after an 1.5hrs) after all that we already knew we were not coming back.  We tipped well, but only on the condition that he get all of it and it not be shared with the others that were there.  It also took so long in between our food items that we ordered arriving that we did not even get it all in that 1.5 hrs and we ordered within 5 mins of sitting down because we already knew what we wanted when we got there.  Because of this, we left hungry and had to get drive thru!  OMG. 

 Unless you like being ignored, not getting your food or service, and have hour to kill while you pay someone for this, don't bother with this place.

Had the pleasure of Nick as the sushi chef and Joe as our server.  Both were courteous, friendly, and efficient with our orders.  All food was very good.  Had poke salad, nigiri, and for our first visit Nick made most orders a half roll so we could try many items.  Everything was very tasty.  Only thing I did not like was that some of the rolls that were torched were tasty, but had a little fuel after taste, and as some other reviewers have mentioned, the nigiri was microscopic in size.  I have only come across one other sushi joint that served this way.  The salmon belly was very tasty, but four pieces were only equal to one regular order that you would receive elsewhere.  Other than those minor issues we would definitely go back again.  

Nick also surprised us a couple times with items we did not order.  He made an off menu item called the 10K, and another one called The Black Widow.  Both very tasty.  Will give a second try later and see how it goes.  A tad on the high side price wise compared to other sushi places along this Cheyenne Ave. corridor.  $21.95 lunch, $25.95 dinner, both AYCE.

You do have to be looking for this place as it is tucked behind a line of buildings.  Once found, however, *it is a great find.*  I was so pleased to still be accommodated for all you can eat at 10pm (in a local neighborhood).  The interior is simple and clean, the staff was warm and inviting.  The music is contemporary, but, kept a level condusive for conversation, allowing for a nice, sophisticated vibe.  The server was knowledgeable, explained all the essentials from the onset, and, stayed posted at the front of the restaurant facing guests.  I happened in to this place on a night where I was dining by myself, and, and, felt not one bit out of place as there were several other women also dining solo, and, none of us were distracted from our meals in any way. 

I ordered a series of items, the sushi chefs were quick, and, personable.  My choices included the poke, the salmon handroll, and, the house specialty (half) roll.  All of my dishes tasted so light and well prepared - with no heavy sauces or mayonnaise.  I truly wish I was capable of eating more - as the chefs continued to encourage.  I felt I'd had a most satisfying meal, and, left with a re-exhuberation of all you can eat.  I was completely satisfied, and, not in want of anything.

Upon entering, an employee in regular street clothes was standing behind the sushi counter.  It took literally 30 seconds of myself and my wife standing there at the entrance before he even acknowledged us.  No hostess was present or seen at this time.

Upon being seated, this same employee came to get our drink order and asked if we wanted to order anything from the kitchen.  The hostess finally came out after almost 10 minutes and took our sushi order.  

Very sub par food.  Rice for our nigiri sushi was smaller in size but was cold and chewy, as in just came out of the refrigerator cold.  Maybe trying to use up some old rice that was left over?  Salmon and tuna was just ""ok"", quality not up to par with other ayce sushi places.  Against our better judgement we ordered 1 more order of tuna nigiri.  Rice was better but not really.  We mostly got filled on appetizers, of which the selection is very small.

Needless to say we will not be back nor can I recommend this place.  Service is severely lacking, along with serving cold and chewy sushi rice.

I was kinda anxious about their AYCE rules with 1 hr and 15 min time limit for dinner! Haha! Not that I plan on ""camping in"". I can't eat as fast I want to! No one wants to choke while eating their meal! 

Appetizers: 5/5
Poke salad was garnished with some seaweed. It was fresh and delicious with just the right amount of dressing in it. Other locations dredge their poke salad with the sauce and that's one of my pet peeves. 
Tuna carpaccio was super yummy! Love the mild sweet sauce with a kinda garlicky taste to it served with mayo underneath.
Amaebi was one of the best I've had! Love the lightly breaded flavorful shrimp heads! 

Nigiri: 3.5/5
Salmon belly, eel, and tuna were really fresh, but my first few pieces of the nigiri, sushi rice was a little bit undercooked. Rice to fish ratio was awesome! Perfectly sliced thickness with VERY small amount of rice! We will see IF the second visit will be the same ratio.

Sushi Rolls: 4/5
The only sushi roll I ordered from the menu was the Sasa. It has shrimp tempura, spicy crab, cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. The sauces were mayo, sriracha, and eel sauce. I really like it a lot, but it could have been better if the shrimp tempura had some crunch to it. The rest of the special rolls I've had were made by Nick who was superb! I was game for anything he can create! And oh boy did he impress me! 

Small cut of sashimi served in the traditional Asian soup spoon with a sweet hint of sauce was delicious! This creation was repeated, but this time it was served on fried crunchy edible leaves. The next roll he whipped up was a tuna roll with tuna, crab, and scallops. It was garnished with super creamy sauce and jalepeno for added heat.

Deserts: 3.5/5
Yuzu sorbet! It's about time someone gave me a full scoop of this goodness! Most places either give you about a tablespoon or it looks like a full scoop, but it's hollow inside. Really? You think I can't tell the difference?!? LMAO! 
Green tea tempura ice cream was just ""okay"". Green tea was weak in flavor and not as creamy as other green tea ice cream I've had.

I would definitely come back since I barely tried out their menu selections, but I would probably not come here with a large group since there is a time limit of 75 minutes. BTW, they have happy hour with 20% off their a la carte sushi rolls from 2pm-5pm.",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,6,6,4,9WaiSzHKY_hMODa8_C4bug

They have specific rules as to what you can and cannot due when ordering all you can eat. You can only stay for 1hr 15minutes when choosing AYCE. 

We had the volcano roll, fireball, bank and Alex's munchie. They were very delicious. Of course they were on the specialty style sushi. 
They make the sushi pretty fast. Its smart to just sit at the bar if you're doing all you can eat sushi. 

The server was pretty attentive. She came around to refill our drinks. The sushi artists weren't very engaging, they just kept to themselves So not much interaction if youre gonna eat alone. 

Speciality sushis were around 11 to 14 dollars. You'd get your moneys worth with AYCE if you just order 3!

1643257,2015-02-28,0,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"I'm writing this review because I feel like this place has a few small problems that if were fixed would turn it into a top tier sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. 

We showed up at 6 pm on a Friday night. About a 15 minute wait. No problem, it's a small place. We were seated and given menus and we placed orders but didn't receive our first roll until nearly 30 minutes after we ordered. 

I believe the reason for this is the place was just slammed. They got unlucky and a whole bunch of people showed up at once and the orders poured in. Nobody left for the first half and hour we were there. They've got to streamline their back of house to take care of this situation. The food was trickling out of the bar when there were four guys back there. 

The servers did a great job of making sure everyone was as happy as possible but there is only but so much servers can do when there is no food. On top of it more than a few tables got rolls they didn't order, I myself got a double order when I clearly placed one order. This kind of stuff just snowballs inefficiency and really adds up. Some of the rolls were very tasty. My favorite was the mango crunch. It was fresh and new and different. On the other hand other rolls were very lazily made. One of my rolls wasn't sealed and fell apart every time I picked up a piece. Another roll was sloppy and clunky and made eating a mouthful at a time impossible. 

The food was good though. The nigiri was fresh and the portions of fish were generous. The free house sake with check in was great. 

At times some of the servers seemed a bit unprofessional and were scratching and moving in odd ways. Nothing devious of nasty, just not the demeanor a pro server should have. 

Overall If this place tightened up the rough edges just a bit this is an easy 5 star for me. It was worth the money to try. I'd recommend going when it's not busy. Lunchtime or a weekday.",5Q3J19sYxOMqXtQklNo50g,1,2,3,QKooFW8tJU2LzbR5kAJ6kg

Serioulsy, today's Sasa Sashimi lunch combo with its accompaniments was delicous and the perfect size too  - the miso soup was hot, the salad was green and the draft Asahi was cold of course, like it should be.",W3bquWQPb_wBeEw8xyPYbA,0,0,4,sbTZpibWtGTTWAZHdIncRg

We came on a Friday night and the place was pretty busy. It is very apparent that the staff does not know how to handle busy peaks. We had three semi clueless people servicing our table. It was very bizarre. 

We ordered three rolls, an order of nigiri, and green mussels. One of the three servers brings out the ""Mussels"".I point out that we ordered mussels and he informs that's what was in front of us.  I politely inform him that in fact I have seen a mussel or two in my day, and this was some type of a leaf tempura, not mussels. He looks confused, then he rushes off and comes back to inform us that it's really a complimentary chef's creation, and our mussels were going to be out shortly. Wow. I mean how could you even confuse the two? 

The fish was not fresh and the creations were pretty much all the same thing. The service was extremely lackluster and a toddler slipped and fell as the family was leaving. They promptly grabbed the ""wet floor"" sign and put it up. They did check if the tot was okay, but then rushed to cover their butt. I mean, when the kid slipped it was apparent there was spilled water on the ground. Someone could have seriously injured themselves, or as a pregnant woman I shudder to think what could have happened.

For all-you can eat menu, it's much less than other similar venues that offer a bigger menu and better quality.  The real trick here is assuming you have steady service throughout your meal.  Here however, they like to disappear for long periods of time.  Seems convenient for an all you can eat option that they want to slow your ordering.  I'd say this was just coincidence, but again second visit with the same service.  For $26 each, I expect to be able to order more off of your lesser menu.  My bad, but no worries, we won't be back.   We brought family here from out of town and had to apologize for our selection.  Lesson learned.  Mango Mochi at the end slightly improved the experience, but not enough to move out of the 2 star rating.  PS--Waiting on Check now for 20 mins without anyone approaching the table.

It has a combination of tuna, yellowtail, and salmon along with some seaweed salad. Which is why I always get it whenever we come. Their mango crunch roll is also a good one to try if you're into the sweet and savory, the first time we went there, our waitress recommended it and I was skeptical at first because of the mango and cream cheese combo, but I was sold on it!

Food:
I've had better quality of fish but this was a cool place to try out; they had flying fish roe which I've never had before but don't think I'll come back just because there are places that have better fish for the same price. 

Service:
Sat at the sushi bar and ordered AYCE sushi for their lunch price. I'd recommend sitting at the bar so you can ask the sushi chef questions and give precise orders.

I cannot believe she the first person customers have to encounter at Sasa.  I'd suggest the owners/manager provide her some training in customer service.  She did not make us feel warm or welcome at Sasa.  We decided to stick it out and are glad we did.  The rest of the employees we encountered were fantastic.  The food itself was all very tasty and presented well.  I like that they don't cram everything with as much rice as possible.  All of the rolls were pretty good and there wasn't any food that we did not enjoy.  The desserts offered were pretty decent alsol

The ambiance was okay and it is clear they have a lot of regulars.  I think this place would do better if they made first timers feel welcome and perhaps talk up the place a little.  Maybe recommend some of the rolls that are unique to Sasa.

We almost walked out and said ""F-It"" after our encounter with the host during arrival.  I'm happy we stayed and may consider coming back.  I would gladly take a poor host and great food over a great host and poor food.",hPCanQMW8QvhRN6gOowxDQ,0,0,4,trqsnfY4R0OQS6pL3f07tQ

The SASA 99 BENTO BOX is a great value- it's on the lunch menu but they allowed me to order it at 6PM. Order consists of 9 pieces of chef-selected sashimi, 9 pieces of nigiri, a choice of one basic roll (I went with the California), soup and salad. The cuts of fish were generous and thick, and noticeably fresh. I was pleased to see that the California roll was packed with crab and used minimal rice. Soup and salad were forgettable, but for $17, this was a great deal and a giant amount of food. Added on a 3-piece of gyoza (tasty but the wrappers were thicker than I'm used to) and it was enough for dinner AND lunch the next day.

I wasn't blown away by my order but I was decently surprised- so many AYCE places shaft you by packing on the rice, giving thin cuts of fish, etc but I would come back here again, either for the same order or to try something different.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,4,4,AXTf9dyWGSs1rk0VTZNSvg

2133712,2016-02-06,2,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"Sasa Sushi is a joke, because of them I need to go back and re-evaluate Tokyo Sushi House that I evaluated yesterday and up them to a 2 star, unfortunately Sasa Sushi is much worse and they truly deserve the covenant 1 star. 

I'm on a quest to rate all of the sushi establishments within 5 miles of where I work.  When I went to Sasa Sushi today for lunch, I walked in at 12:10pm and I was the only person in the restaurant, other than 2 sushi chefs, the host/waiter and what I believe to be the owner. 
So there I am one person with the honor of having 4 individuals tend to my sushi needs. Under these circumstances, you would believe the sushi I was about to ingest would be amazing, why not, without any other tables or orders to distract the sushi chef from my order, I was sure I was in for a sushi experience like no other. 

I immediately asked for extra wasabi and my waiter Ronald was quick to respond, nothing fancy mind you like you would normally see in other restaurants, just a small round plate with ginger and wasabi just thrown on the plate, very messy presentation. So I began to mix my normal soy sauce with wasabi and noticed the wasabi had no heat, so I added even more wasabi in an attempt to make it hotter and to no avail. The wasabi was clearly not fresh; I ended up with a paste so thick in an attempt to get some heat that you would have thought I was mixing grout for bathroom tile work. 

I ordered the Poke Salad and it appeared very nice but I was a little taken back by the sweetness.  I then ordered the Kamikaze Roll and my usual Unagi Hand Roll so that I can gauge the quality of fresh fish to come by sampling the fresh water eel, oh my god, I nearly passed out with disgust as to what was brought to my table.  The eel was burnt, cold and just simply hard to chew; the only other eel in my life that tasted even remotely similar to this was what I once found in a can in the supermarket. Being the only person in the restaurant, the eel should have been freshly broiled and come to my table still warm, instead it was cold, burnt and had a consistency of beef jerky. I would be embarrassed if I took a client here, ashamed really. 

I ended up sending both the eel hand role and the spicy tuna hand role back when they arrived because nearly 80% of the roll was rice and virtually no protein. Again, the eel was horrible, If I had to lay money down and bet, I would say the eel came from a can and was not fresh at all.  

I went on to order Albacore and it came out dry and looked like someone had already chewed it and put it back on the plate (cuts all across the fish). I also ordered the Surf Clam and this came out slimy, surf clam never has a slimy sheen on it unless it's old. 
I was trying so hard to make this place work, I tried as much as I could to see if I could find something on the menu to make the trip to Sasa Sushi enjoyable and worth it, but I just couldn't. 

I ordered the Salmon Skin hand roll and it was the worst I had ever tasted in my life, the Salmon Skin was pieces of skin about 4-5inches long sticking out of the hand roll, not 1 or 2 pieces but what appeared to be the whole damn salmon, it was truly overkill. When I bight into the Salmon Skin hand roll, there was such a load crunch I believe people were looking around to see if metal was crumpling from a car accident outside. It was awful, I felt like I was eating a pork rind hand roll, it was way to crunchy and just too much of it. I then ordered the PCH Roll thinking, not too complicated, it's a roll with only three little letters for a name, so I thought to myself, as long as there wasn't any more of that dreadful eel in the roll, maybe this roll will be a winner. Who knew, how do you screw up a roll that has Tuna, Salmon, Cream Cheese and Avocado; simple, cut the pieces so big you need someone without just in case you need someone to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on you when you choke. Only 6 piece came out where there should have been 8 and possible 10 for a cut roll, the pieces were just too thick to be enjoyable, nobody wants that much cream cheese in their mouth at one time, unless you're sitting down to put the hurt on a lox bagel. 

Sushi is about freshness, textures, flavors, combinations of flavors and the perfect balance of vinegar rice to raw fish. If any of these are not correct, it ruins the entire sushi experience.  

Sasa Sushi reminds me of amateur hour at the Laugh Factory, although they did get a laugh out of me, as I said when I opened, what a Joke. I couldn't believe I was actually paying money for this crap, just about anyone could read a book at home and learn how to cut, prepare and assemble better tasting sushi than Asaa sushi. Don't waste your time and money going here, there's just not enough customers for the fish to be fresh, hence the Unagi in a can, slimy Surf Clam and already chewed Albacore.",gjgOfC5f70ML3o4549gdTA,4,1,1,_7QuW3K0eywr-JQmyXK49g

I put in sushi near me and this place popped up. It had good reviews for the most part, so we thought why not? 

I'm glad we decided to check this place out. The food was amazing. My boyfriend is very picky. He only likes to go to Yama Sushi, but I convinced him to try this place and try new rolls and he was amazed. We asked what rolls were recommended and tried all the ones they told us about and I dont have anything bad to say about any of them. We just went for it and tried a bunch of their rolls and all were worth it. I like red bean ice cream, but am iffy about the grainy beans in it, but I tried it here and it was better than I've ever had at any other sushi place. There were a lot more we wanted to try, but ran out of room in our bellies for anymore. Lol

One complaint I had that dropped my rating down, was the time it took to receive our food. We ordered a bunch of stuff right away because we knew some things take longer than others to get. Well, a few things we waited and waited for, at least 30 minutes, and nothing. We finally asked and they forgot to put them in, yet never came to check on us after they saw all our plates were empty for awhile. Their service could definitely be improved, to make sure customers are getting waited on quickly, but we will definitely try it again. By the time we were leaving the place was packed and people were waiting outside, but when we got there, there were a lot of open tables, so you may want to go on an off hour and not dinner time, if you don't want to wait.",uT88e0NuTpxcqcv3cAyUKA,1,2,4,9q4d0awgs0t-f3D55hoZ-Q

Two, my rolls just weren't that good I threw the rest away. I got a rainbow roll and two orders of nigiri. Their spicy mayo wasn't mixed and tasted terrible. 

Please take more time to quality control your food and take care of your restaurant! If you have maintenance issues close the restaurant, don't let people eat in a bad smelling environment.

We walked in and went to the ""bar"" area, ordered two beers and one glass of ice water.  As always the waiter said, ""are you having AYCE?"" As always we said no.  Between the two of us we only need one or two rolls and getting the ayce is a waste of money.  Well the guy who we have never had before said that we will regret not getting the ayce and then laughed.  So we went on to get a salmon roll and japanese lasagna.  The salmon roll was delish (as always) the japanese lasagna on the other hand was hideous.... GROSS!!!  Then we ordered yellow fin tuna roll and that was also really good. 
Then here came the bill.... our bill was over $40!  we figured around $25.  The rolls are usually $4 the beers around $3.50 and the yukey japanese lasagna was close to $8.  Well after looking at the breakdown after the sticker shock!!!  They charged us for the sushi on the other side of the menu and not what we clearly pointed to on the menu.  The Hawaiian roll $9.95 and the $8 for the lasagna and Hamanchi Lover's Roll $10.50!  Making our total bill as much as the ""AYCE"" he was right we would regret not getting the ayce!  Ayce is $21.95 each but we only ordered and pointed to the rolls we wanted.  This was not our first rodeo here and we know what we order and have done so for OVER a year. The sushi chef knew what we pointed to and the waiter rang it up the way he wanted to.
NEVER AGAIN even though we do love this place but buyer be aware!!!!  Make it VERY clear what you are ordering and double check!

My family makes it to Sasa on average twice a month because the food is so good, but last night there were so many minor issues that they added up to one lackluster visit.  First, it smelled bad as we walked in.  Then we ordered green tea and that even smelled stronger than usual that night.  We order 4 rolls and 3 appetizers but we finished all our rolls before we even got our appetizers because service was so slow and then when our first appetizer came, another foul smell of burning metal came from the kitchen with it.  The teriyaki beef, a go-to favorite, was old and dryer than usual.  Their new recipe fried calamari which was so delicious on our last visit was inedible this time.  The sushi rice was old and the wasabi was not its usual bright green color.  Again, I know Sasa so we will probably go back in two weeks despite this one bad experience but if we have this same low quality food next time, it will be our last visit.

Their menu isn't as big as some other similar styled restaurants, however, we weren't disappointed with the majority of the food and service we received. 
Me and my boyfriend came in fairly late, around 10:30. On Friday and Saturday, they close at midnight, and last call is about 11:30. The waiter was very kind about letting us read over the menu (the entire menu is available for AYCE!) I'm a huge fan of eel, and many of their rolls feature this delicious fish. Among our meal, we tried mainly their specialty rolls, the Mardi Gras being my personal favorite. 
I must say though, I was extremely disappointed with the baked Volcano roll I had. The rice was mushy, and mayo tasted overly sweet, and the scallops were rubbery and overcooked. Maybe it was on off night, but it was very off-putting. 
The waiter also brought us an oops roll. The chefs made a extra Screaming Orgasam, which was thoughtful to give to us, but we couldn't eat it! I'm horribly allergic to the green onions on the roll. So yay and boo :(

Freaked out for a minute cuz my kids and I weren't hungry enough for AYCE and I thought regular plates were also available.. Asked about ramen- and told the waiter I thought they had other plates and he said ramen was a special and pointed to a board.. Ok, so if he wasn't going to tell me the specials, I guess I had to get up to read them.. He finally offers the other menu.. Just seemed a little odd, but ok... Like, it was bothersome to get it...
So I ordered the Sasa 99, which was beautifully presented, but the sushi seemed warmer than what it should be.. It's sashimi and nigiri and a small roll of your choice of tuna, salmon and something else.. I ordered, and SAID, ""2 Pork Katsu DON"" pls.. The Katsu Don came with miso soup and salad, which I was totally impressed with and the bowl didnt have an egg.. I told the kids it's what I ordered though... 
So I asked the waiter why their Katsu Don didn't have an egg, he said it did.. I said that's what I ordered then..he said no you didn't.. Uh yes, I did.. I said pork Katsu Don.. He said no- you said pork Katsu only. That's fine.. U can argue with me.. No problem.. 
So, I went on to Yelp,  simply to see if I would get some sort of discount for checking in, and saw only the sake with an AYCE. My waiter, Tyler, approaches me again and says, ""I see you're posting a review on Yelp.. Even IF you ordered the Katsu Don, the kids already started eating the food so I would have to charge you extra."" Charge me extra for EGGS?!? Ooohhh... I told him I know what I ordered, and he again said, no- that's not what you said. I said You didn't need to come and argue with me. Seriously?! WTF?! 
Needless to say, water was never refilled,  checked up on us once, had to ask for napkins, and surprisingly, for the bill. They were getting 3 stars before the waiter approached me about the  Yelp review, so there's your 1 star..

I've been to almost every single AYCE sushi place in Vegas and this place is hands down the best AYCE sushi place I've ever been to. The thing I love about this place is that they get our order correct every time. I can't stress how important this is because almost every other sushi place tries to skimp on their food. For example, if i get 2 sashimi salad, they'll use one fish portion and split it between 2 salads, or if I get 4 orders of shrimp tempura, they'll only give 4 or 6 pieces and not 8. But this doesn't happen at Sasa Sushi. They give the correct portion and correct amount every time. They also don't forget our orders like other sushi places frequently do.

The food is all excellent and tasty, the ama ebi (sweet shrimp) was sooo good and they use the biggest shrimps I've ever seen in a sushi restaurant. Everything was extremely fresh, the uni, salmon belly, and even the crab sticks were excellent. Service was excellent as well and our waters never fell below half the cup the whole time. The food wait time was extremely short even though the restaurant was packed.

One thing though is that their rolls selections aren't that good, and 90% of the rolls are shrimp tempura rolls with cream cheese. I didn't see any lobster rolls or soft shelled crabs rolls which was disappointing. So if you are into rolls then I wouldn't recommend this place, but if you are into nigiri with huge fish to small rice ratio, sashimi (yes they serve sashimi for AYCE!!), appetizers like oyster shooter, spoon specials (ask the server for this), and desserts (UNLIMITED MOCHI!!!), this is hands down the best sushi place you'll find in Vegas.",bmmgelxV1eBpWmT32F3xhA,2,0,5,5SOmsGMW_MfPD0cdvAmqMA

Finally went up front, check was almost 60 dollars for maybe the thirty dollars worth of crap that was impossible to order. What a horrible experience. First time in twenty years I have ever not left a tip. The bald sushi chef was absolutely the most unfriendliness and unprofessional We have ever encountered. This was our first and last visit to this dump. Nice experience for Mother's Day?!",Joi6v-YzRisF8xrJuxLBdQ,0,0,1,-9lAydqgr36RwnOEUFTyhQ

I've eyeballed this joint for sometime: on Yelp, when driving by, etc but for some odd reason was skeptical. Skeptics like me, be advised, this joint is not a joke. 
Fair prices, excellent service, the sushi chef made our visit. Such a friendly guy with great jokes. I love going to sushi places with awesome chefs that pride themselves on customer satisfaction. He went above and beyond to recommend rolls and make me something special!

I also had the kamikaze which had nice sweet eel and crab (though it didn't say that on the menu and I usually don't like crab) but it was good too. Super white tuna was pretty fresh and buttery but less ponzu sauce than I usually like. Cajun was awesome & not dry like I've had at other places...great spicy Cajun sauce too.

She said it as if miscommunication is a justification for being rude.

3455282,2013-05-20,2,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"Sasa Sushi's AYCE option really filled me up for $21 (lunch price). A bargain when compared to some AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. 

Here's an overview of their AYCE:
There's a 45 minute time limit for lunch; 1 hour for dinner, I believe.
AYCE menu options are decent. Plenty of rolls and hot food items.
Excluding deep fried rolls, you can order 1/2 rolls.

FOOD
Pain in the Ass Roll:  The name did make me laugh out loud, so I had to order. I do like this roll, but I thought there was *too* much sauce on my plate.

Masago and Tako Nigiri: The masago was meager and not ""robust"" as others I've had. I do like how you can request quail eggs to top. The tako was too chewy and the rice vinegar for the sushi rice was strong, so I didn't enjoy the flavor-texture combination.

Japanese Lasagna: I thought there was too much cheese. It's difficult for me to figure out if there was too much cheese in the rolls or on top -- both, maybe? But being a cheese lover, even that was excessive.

Unnamed Roll: The sushi chef created two pieces of sushi for us on the fly. The pieces had imitation crab on top of rice and were wrapped with a thin slice of tuna, which kind of reminded me of bacon. Not bad, we enjoyed it.

SC 7 Roll: The roll is wrapped with soy paper and has drops of srirracha sauce on top. I thought I would like this roll, but the flavors didn't meld well. As much as I love srirracha, I thought it was what threw the flavors off-balance. 

Tempura Ice Cream: Tempura battered vanilla ice cream served with chocolate syrup and a spray of whipped cream. Didn't care for the texture of the thick tempura shell. I also thought this was underwhelming when compared to the tempura ice cream that RA sushi has, which is the best one I've had so far in Las Vegas. 

SERVICE
The service here is terrific. Staff is friendly, competent, and attentive. 

OTHER
Sushi that isn't tightly rolled = contents will fall out. 

Maybe I'm just being picky, but one of the rolls ordered wasn't arranged neatly. I bring this up because I've before never seen sushi rolls presented sloppily. It reminds me of what my plate looks like when I hit up a sushi buffet and grab sushi pieces and plop them onto my plate. 

OVERALL
My rating for Sushi Sasa  is a 3.5/5.0. The service is wonderful and the price for the AYCE lunch is awesome. The rolls are fine, but I wouldn't order the same items again.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,3,3,9QoP7zfECAJltMp2EJmVpQ

We sat down and she brought us the menus, she immediately asked for our order. We order drinks and asked her to give us a second to pick the roles, she replied, (I'M NOT LYING) ""Ok as long as is not too long, since is Friday and we get busy, we might have to ask you to leave if you don't order soon""... So we laughed, thought it was a joke, right? No it wasn't, she had a straight serious face...  

Later, she came back to take our order, we had AYCE. Sushi was okay, nothing memorable. Earlier, when we placed our drink order she suggested $5 all you can drink beer, so my friend got that. When he finish his first glass of beer we asked the waiter for a refill, when she brought the sushi, which she replied (AGAIN, not lying) ""hmm I might have to ask someone else to bring it to you because I am not going to be in this side (restaurant & it is not big by any means) for a while""... She left to attend other tables. She never asked anyone to bring that drink. Some other guy, helped us for the rest of the night, he was slow but  not rude...so it was an improvement. At one point during the night they brought us the wrong sushi rolls, when we told some other waiter that it wasn't ours he did not said a thing, just picked them up and left.

3623046,2015-05-09,4,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"It is very rare that I give a place a 1-star review, but given the circumstances, it must be done. Here is why..

1. We walked in asking for a table for 6 and the server immediately asked us ""Is this your first time here?"" We replied with ""Yes."" You know, thinking she was going to be like ""Oh, welcome!! We're so happy to have you with us tonight!"" Instead, she responded with, ""Oh, next time, can you just make sure you call in to let us know that you have a big group coming in? As you can see we're quite small so it will just be better for both of us if you called in..."" Did I not just tell her that it was our first time? Was I supposed to know that you were a small restaurant? I thought this was like any typical restaurant that I can walk in with a party of 6 and you can accommodate us, even if it meant for us to wait a little? o_O? 

2. I checked in on Yelp and received a free sake, and what's some sake without some Asahi amirite? So we order a bottle of Asahi. Almost regrettable because it completely confused the crap out of the server and had her asking her coworker if that was allowed multiple times. Back and forth she went asking questions and thinking we were looking for a free bottle of Asahi with our sake when we repeatedly told her we just wanted to order a beer with our sake..! Just take my money already and give us the bottle of Asahi! 

3. The server continued to remind us she was new. The first time was a pass and understandable, but mistake after mistake after mistake and the excuse of being new does not fly with me. I give you the benefit of the doubt that you're a smart cookie, you don't have to keep telling me that you're new. I understood the first time. Just do better. And by better, I don't mean spilling water on our phones...which is exactly what she did -___-"" ohh laawwd. 

4. The upside and downside is that if you wanted any roll wrapped with cucumber you can do so, but only ONE roll when you're doing the AYCE option. Bummer because those are the only type of rolls I fancy. 

5. Obviously our server wasn't favorable but just in general I feel like the place is rather small where all servers are taking care of all tables. I personally like to have one attentive server when I dine because then you run into multiple servers asking you if you're doing okay in 5 minute rotations. But that wasn't the problem here, it just seemed like no one was being attentive. If possible, just dine at the sushi bar so you can get your orders in right away and not have to deal with that mess.

6. Lastly, the reason why I'm like EEK! Methinks not! about Sasa is because I don't live in this area and don't see myself driving 20 minutes to visit here again. The food was OK but the service is really what left the bad taste in my mouth.",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,6,6,1,LN-nzWwJvX2cIHUueyxrWA

3648979,2017-05-21,0,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"This review is regarding the Yelp Order Online option for Sasa Sushi. I ordered the food 1.5 hours before the restaurant closed, paid via credit card and received email confirmation for pick up within 10-30 minutes.

Showed up at the restaurant 20 minutes after placing the order and the restaurant wasn't open, and likely was closed for some time since there were no staff closing the restaurant, everyone had left already.

I can only assume they closed early cuz it was dead, but now I paid for food, it was late at night and I was stuck trying to figure out what was still open for dinner and how I was going to get my money back. 

I called the restaurant to get a refund and they've redirected me to Yelp, who I guess has Eat24 run their online orders. So we'll see how it goes.

So I would not recommend using their online ordering service if it's even a couple hours before the restaurant closes, because they may not be open when you try to pick up your food.

3960322,2014-02-17,2,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"Ok, I gotta say SASA disappointed me a more than just a little bit during my last two visits. I was so excited about the new Sushi place and I think I will even give it one more chance. 

Both times my order was incomplete so I had to keep asking for the same thing. It gets more irritating when they forget it again. It might be that they were very busy but this would never happen at Sushi Koma on the south side of Vegas or Sushi goyemon, probably one of the busiest AYCE sushi joint in town. 

The biggest thing though, and this is serious, the fish quality has been very inconsistent. The scallop tastes very dried and the salmon is sometimes hard to digest. What offended me during one of my last twos visits was that the salmon came with whole bunch fish bones in it. This is unacceptable in a sushi restaurant. Also, the sushi rice kept on falling apart and the rice tasted very dried and blend. While I do not expect a 5 star sushi experience at a AYCE place, I do expect the basics are met. Having bones appear in your sushi is just embarrassing imo. 

I really love the people here and sasa was really good when i first tried it. I am willing to give it another chance and i hope things will get back to what they were used to be.",96GpOsmTQa0UJSo_9JEOog,5,1,2,n559RdU4CIM7EL7IbQOn_Q

I deliberately waited for him to ask me whats next and he completely ignored me. With so many competing all you can eat sushi places around, this place won't be missed by me.

**plus every time I go there there is always shit flies flying around. You know the flies that you see around dog shit on the street. One time I went, there was a problem with so many bugs by the cooler that the sushi chefs were scared to go next to the cooler.**

4031962,2018-01-06,0,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"I really enjoyed the food here! It was fresh, well prepared, and had a nice aesthetic. The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is that I believe very small restaurants like this one shouldn't be taking reservations for small parties. 

Not only that, they weren't even sure which seats at the bar area were actually reserved or not. We were waiting for 35 mins for first available for two and once we sat down and got halfway through our meal, the hostess looked at the 4 bar seats next to us (that had been available since before we got there) and had to ask a chef if it was even really reserved or not. And it was extremely irritating to hear that they weren't even actually reserved for anyone! So we waited 35 mins to be seated for nothing. 

All that aside, the food was great and I am definitely willing to come back and try again. Hopefully the service will be more capable next time around!",jn9IpG4psgKdR1ULRbMEWw,0,0,4,l2y0rnPzoDD9-aQqz7NTwA
4038071,2018-02-17,0,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"Pros: The waitress was nice, extremely polite, and accommodating. 

The sushi rolls did come out quickly (but we were the only customers there on a Saturday around 1 pm).

The price is reasonable ($25 all you can eat)

The mochi ice cream is cheap and decent.

Cons: 

They need to fix their booths. The booth we sat in has a hole.

The rolls weren't very impressive. The rice was dry and sticky. 

When I asked for spicy mayo (one for myself and another for my boyfriend-mind you they were small containers) the cook (based off the pictures he wasn't the usual cook) told the waitress ""I only have this bottle."" (Rude much! You shouldn't be addressing the waitress or customer like that. Plus I'm pretty sure if you have a sushi restaurant you should have more spicy mayo in the back.)

I also disliked the menu. When you order all you can eat they don't give you a sheet (like most sushi spots do) to make it easier to order. 

I'm not sure why this place has 4 stars.",Jp-l04f3zXqVR37vcwzs9A,0,0,2,06Ndj-dJSItcSgYH9KfUKA

4043795,2018-02-28,0,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"My go to place for AYCE sushi. I've eaten at a lot of AYCE places in my day, so that says a lot.

Pros:

1. The first and most important thing is the quality of the fish. With one exception where there was a bad batch of mackeral (which the chefs and I now have a running joke about now), I've never once been disappointed with the fish I've been served. Always fresh, always generously portioned, never over temperature or dry. Fish to rice ratio is also always right on point. 

2. The staff are great, especially the chefs. If you sit at the bar, they're always on point with getting you taken care of, and are a really fun bunch to have conversations with while you eat. Manny is a rock star. Seen the owner a handful of times and she's very nice.

3. Their AYCE pricing is fairly standard, but the real deal comes from the AYCD bonus for only $5 extra. Even without it, the house sake is super cheap at $1.50 for a small and $3.00 for a large. Most place charge double or triple that. They also have a nice, fairly priced selection of cold and bottled sakes as well.

4. The place is clean and doesn't smell funky. There's a lot of sushi places where you walk out smelling like an abandoned fish factory, but not here. Never had a dirty table. Bathrooms are well maintained. And, most importantly, to my knowledge they have never once had a health department grade lower than A. That's a huge deal in this town.

5. They have shiso. This isn't something you'll commonly see in reviews, and most people don't even know what that is, but that's a big deal for me. Also known as perilla, its plant leaf that really enhances the flavors for certain nigiri items, especially squid and yellowtail. They even have a really rocking appetizer called Japanese Nachos that has deep fried shiso with a lovely fish mix on top of it. One of my favorite things there. 

More often than not, if I ask for this at other places, they either don't have it, charge extra for it, or don't even know what it is (blasphemy!).

Cons:

1. Generally the appetizers aren't bad, but aren't great either. Some things like the calamari and popcorn scallops are overcooked, small, and rubbery. They get the job done, but could be improved. Selection for them is also a bit limited. A minor complaint though, as I'm there primarily for the sushi, and the Japanese Nachos as stated above make me more than happy enough to not really care appetizer wise.

2. Sometimes there will be a lot of reservations, so seating will be limited. Kind of a bummer when you're walking in on a Friday or Saturday night and there's a really long wait. Can't really knock them for it though, so this is more of just an FYI to call ahead on those nights to make sure there's seating available.

3. Minor quibble, but there's no menu options for riceless rolls (i.e. the ones that use cucumber instead of rice).

In summary, I'm happy to be a frequent customer here and will continue to be one for as long as they're around.",v0QQFY3i8IkCMHtGik4rTw,0,0,5,_BSboqt9WKJi6tGjJktldA

My girlfriend brought her own Stevia sugar packet one day when we went out to eat here and then a few days after, we decided to stop by and get dinner, our server pointed out that they had new sugar and their new sugar was 'Stevia in the Raw' I thought that was really thoughtful of them!

-Food-: The sushi is top notch, fresh and there are plenty of rolls amongst other assortments on the menu to choose from. (Reccomended rolls- Tracy 2, Paradise, Alex's Munchie, Mikes Mardi Gras)

-Service-: This is THE fastest most efficient sushi joint in town. I dont believe Ive had to wait more than 8 minutes (at the max) for a roll. I would highly reccomend sitting at the bar as the chefs (Manny, Kevin, and NIck) are nice, friendly, fun and energetic. The most important aspect in a restaraunt to me is engaging your client and this is exactly what they do.

-Environment-: The restaraunt is a smaller yet efficient setting. As soon as you walk in, the bar will be right in front with booths to the left of it and normal seating tables to the right. The inside is clean with white and bright green tones along with other fixtures.

-Prices-: The prices are comparable to other locations in town. I believe about $26 for AYCE dinner and $21 for AYCE lunch and add $10 for all you can drink. Individual rolls can run between $8-$12.

Overall if youre not looking for a fancy sushi bar on the strip but want something more conveniant, while still getting great quality sushi, this is the place to be.",tY-qxmMp81dkwyfKS7Gh8g,4,3,5,HLXA0qwmTvfnfQysEFu6qQ

Couldn't go to our normal spots so had to find something close by. Yelped sushi places and this one came up. Reviews and pictures looked good so we tried it. Restaurant is at the corner backend of a shopping plaza so curb appeal is not the best but we still proceeded inside. No one was in the restaurant so they said pick anywhere to sit. Sat down and we were immediately asked for what we wanted. No customer service whatsoever. We decided to just do a few rolls since we didn't know the place well and didn't want to do ""all you can eat"". Ordered and food came out very quick. I would recommend the Mexican roll, so good. I took a picture of it and the Cali Royale. Other then that nothing was great. The edamame was soggy and seemed like it was steamed a few too many times over and over again. The tiger roll, not on their menu but they can make it was so gross. The spicy tuna was mushy paste like, definitely did not have a good taste to it. 

I would come back only if we were stuck on this side of town like we were when we came here and only do those 2 rolls that I mentioned.",RfqZhUKaKKRf_wkqWm1JsA,1,0,3,-KjrxZeWJDoAb_BUQXWzsw

Some friends of ours turned us on to this place and it is absolutely AWESOME!  The fish is always fresh and the all you can eat is incredible. We have eaten at other all you can eat places and they all limit what you can have.

For example, I have to limit my starch intake because of health issues. We asked for sashimi. No problem. They didn't force the nigiri as other places do. The yellowtail jalapeño is one of our favs. The cucumber salad is to die for. The oysters can be done as shooters or on the half shell. 

Other pluses are all you can drink saki or beer for $5, or both for $8. The tuna or yellowtail collar is really good if they have it.

He handed me a few dishes ""something with fried onions"" and ""something different"". Refer to my pictures!

Well the waiter decided it was a good idea to question us about the ammount of fish we were ordering and charged us for the soup we ordered for the little one which they never had in the past they would just include it with one of the all you can eat because let's  face it the kids don't  really eat that much , then when we got the bill to my surprise they had stick me with the 18% gratuity because it was 6 people..... I had no idea kids counted as adults when they hardly eat!!! 

They just lost one of their most faithfull customers i never went anywhere else for sushi for 12 years even when they raised their prices i kept going back because of the service and the fresh food but as of my last visit i am looking for a new sushi bar where i will be treated better and with a bit more respect!!!",8-_sSbrc66JHOztUZZnsmA,4,0,1,ArIn5e-voRxW3PF_ieT1yg

Now to sushi - it was subpar, (worst eel), don't remember anything above 3 out of 10 on any sushi and sides we had and we tried quite a bit.. Nothing stood out...

He made a 2K roll, a tuna carpaccio, an amazing mint leaf dish and other things that he said were not on the menu that would he thought I would enjoy. The presentation of the dishes were also suprisingly nice. Nick even made things off soup spoons like they do at higher end restaurants! Nick truly made this experience a pleasant one!

Ended up ordering salmon avocado rolls, 1 salmon  hand roll and a Japanese lasagna. Picking up my order I noticed that there was a regular salmon rolls but not the salmon hand roll. I told the guy ringing up my order and they saw on the order it didn't say hand roll and that both salmon roll and salmon hand roll were the same price but the ""hand roll"" wasn't specified. They went ahead and gave me the rolls and made a hand roll in a few minutes with no charge so that was pretty awesome. Everything was pretty good expect the Japanese lasagna it was okayish and that is my usual favorite.

Another 5 minutes went by, still nothing. Eventually a sushi chef finally acknowledged us and asked if we were still waiting and how many in our party. The sole server (that we could see anyway) finally appeared, and asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or table. We said bar. Then he told us to each sit at the corner of each other by the end of the bar, and just pulled the chairs closer.

3.5 stars, but I'll  round up to 4.  

Supposedly the fresh fish at sushi joints on certain days of the week is just a myth, but I will say the fish was NOT FRESH this sunday.  Not sure if it was because it was slow, or leftover, but my tuna was not fresh, and my salmon was slightly slimy and falling apart. 

Also, I was extremely disappointed because the Sasa was served on a plate instead of the bed of ice...it's a lot of fish to simply have sitting out at once, it's as if they just had given up on the presentation of fresh fish. 

The only thing good about my Sasa 99 was the yellowtail.  worse, the service was pretty slow even though we were the only people in the restaurant. 

I love Sasa and I've brought coworkers and so many friends from out of town, but the inconsistent quality of fish and spotty service is what stands between it's ranks of an average sushi joint and an outstanding one. 

Overall: I'd recommend going on the weekends or lunch hour, it might be busy but you'll know the quality of fish shld be up to par.  Also be prepared for extremely spotty service if/when things get crazy.

So,

We went sushi hunting again. This time closer to home so we can hopefully reel in a location where we do not have to travel so far to. Sasa came up. 

Hm.

OK so we couldn't find parking. Although located inside a big plaza, Sasa is hidden in a small corner where parking was limited to about 4 maybe 5 vehicles, and 2 of them theirs. 

Ok.

Walked in and we were greeted, seated, and given our menus. If you follow me, you KNOW I KNOW, what I want. So we ordered right away.

What ordered:

Appetizers - 
Shrimp tempura
Baked green mussels 2 orders
Tofu agedashi 
Calimari
Poke salad 2 orders
Cucumber salad
Salmon kama
Miso soup

Sushi -
Sweet shrimp with head
Bank
Birthday
Uni
Masago
Ikura
Tobiko

Chef special - 
5 piece salmon sashimi
Oyster shooters 2 orders

Soooo,

Let's start with the appetizers. Calimari had good flavor but had the texture of paper. Sorry Amanda G. In fact I felt that everything that was supposed to be served hot, calimari, agedashi, and mussels,  came out warm or nuked. 
The poke. Oh the poke. They used a vinigerett sauce that made the fish not seem so fresh. I mean it was an OK mix, but poke is not suppose to be sour meh. The cucumber was not traditionally made. I mean maybe they were going for something different, but a mayo like sauce, nah, divorce the two, marry the mayo witthe poke, and the vinigerett on the cucumber salad and that may just be the match.
Salmon kama came out great. In fact everything post appetizer came out fresh. Traumatized by the way the poke came out, we were pretty concerned about the well being of the rest of their food. I mean, uni is fresh sea urchin, so it has to taste right. To our surprise, their sushi was up there with some of the places we've been to. In fact the 5 slices of salmon sashimi that came out were 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick displayed on a banana leaf atop ice in a bowl.  Only 2 orders allowed btw for special dishes. The roes were not only attractive in color, but tasty as well. In fact, Sharo left surprisingly full by the end of the meal. 

So why 3 stars Mikey?

We came in at the end of one servers shift, and the beginning of the other. And we all know how I rate. Customer service + food + overall experience = rating. Well, we did not get the best of service. Despite there being only 4 tables in total and 2 at the bar, we did not get the same overall treatment that we get in a restaurant that has 1 server to about 7 or 8 tables. I do not want to go in depth, but customer service can use some sprucing up.

Will not be our first place to go if other sushi spots are open, but may be worth a second chance if we just need to pick up. 

Don't take my word for it, different strokes for different folks.",R6eX08IXP4Vsw2Tbee3aGA,8,3,3,RuwQp1MupfKrBnM_mukwKA
5093405,2013-10-11,1,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"Well, about a year ago, I was going to my favorite and closest sushi place, Sushi of Summerlin, and to my chagrin, they were shut down. The sign said ""Closed for Renovation - Will Re-open in June.""
Of course, in this economy, I thought they were over and done with, and I was upset, to say the least.
Then about 6 weeks ago, I decided to see if another sushi place had replaced them and I saw that the sign said SaSa Sushi. I was happy, but who knew if the food was any good.
So I went in and the inside was spruced-up. It was more up-scale looking than the old place, but I really only cared about the food.
The banner that showed the prices (in the old place) was gone, so I asked them how much the ""all you can eat was"". It was about $5 less than the old place.
This was about 3PM, and I saw a chef from the old place walk in to start work. Then I knew things would be okay with the food. 
The ownership, host, waiters/waitresses, and a few of the chefs had changed, but the waiter that was there that day was excellent and one of the new chefs was amazingly fast. He was the first chef that could make sushi rolls faster than I could eat them, which is good when you're doing ""all you can eat"".
So, better atmosphere, better host, better waiting staff, the same good chefs and food, and slightly cheaper prices. 
I would've have given it 5 stars before the switch, so definitely 5 stars now.
Oh year, I almost forgot...At 3PM a small saki is included in the price. I don't drink alcohol, so they gave me unlimited Iced-tea instead. So it's actually $7 or $8 dollars cheaper than it used to be when it was Sushi of Summerlin.

I got AYCE and the first thing that arrived was the amaebi nigiri... I took one bite and was absolutely certain the shrimp was spoiled. I eat authentic Japanese food all the time, I grew up on it, so I know what amaebi is supposed to taste and look like. This was the worst shrimp I've ever had in my life; it was slimy, overwhelmingly fishy-tasting, and the outside was starting to disintegrate. What really concerned me is that when I told the waitress, she just wordlessly took it and tossed it out... No apology, no reaction, no concern... Which makes me suspicious that spoiled fish is a regular problem at Sasa Sushi. I ordered sushi rice for my daughter when she first took our order but all my food came out and 20-25 mins later I was still waiting on her food. The waitress also had a scowl on the whole time she served us. At first I was sympathetic because she and the only other server seemed overwhelmed but after a point it just became ridiculous, especially after I pointed out that their shrimp was rotting. Everything else was mediocre at best. I actually ordered so little that paying for AYCE was more expensive that if I'd done a la carte. I have no idea how this restaurant is still open...

Not only is there so much competition, but there is GOOD competition out there...and of course we all compare one to another.

So let me start off saying that Sasa is GOOD.  It's far from bad, but it's not great in my book either.  Some notes :

Nigiri was hit and miss.  Some (like the sake) tasted fresh.  The Unagi was not cooked very much, so it was missing the slightly crispy edges I love.  The Ahi was SAD.  It was probably the pinkest colored ahi I've ever had, and the fish was FALLING APART.  They probably gave us the worst cut of the fish, one that most others would have THROWN out.

The Calamari was great though!  Light breading with salt/pepper seasoning.  I think this was the highlight of the meal...we ordered a second round! 

Hamachi Kama. Very good, flavorful collar! It's a very SMALL one though, but at least it's done well!  Yum :)

Soft Shell Crab Hand Roll. Very good, and I love the presentation on their hand rolls!  Tasty :)

""Pain in the Ass"" was probably my favorite roll : Deep Fried Salmon, Tuna, Avocado and Cream Cheese. Heavy, but good overall, with a nice kick from the wasabi mayo.

And to finish, I ordered the Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream. I didn't think it was bad, but Cathy really disliked it. Hit or miss? 

So if you are in the area, give it a try!  But I'm not sure when I will be back...

Employees and the owner were friendly and patient with our questions about the business and the menu.

We had the Chirashi Bowl and the Bento Box with beef teriyaki.  Both were really good!  The sashimi was chilled for freshness, and the sushi rice was flavored just right.  The beef teriyaki had the taste of back home in Hawaii, not just soy sauce and sugar.  We later learned that the chef is from Hawaii, so no wonder!

Definite mistake!!

First of all the service was crap. I have never had someone stick there arm and shoulder in my face so many times. I actually had to scoot back and move or they would have rubbed their arm across my face. 

Secondly I got salmon that was so tuff that I was able to bite down and rub my teeth together and it wouldn't bite through. 

And lastly my sister ordered squid that she gagged upon eating. She actually had to spit it out in a napkin. I checked it and the smell alone almost made me gag. It smelled rotten. While moving the plate the squid actually stuck to my finger a bit. 


The only good part of my meal was the dessert. Which only tasted good because it came pre-made and pre-packed.

Although the service was pretty good (it better be since there was hardly anybody there), the food wasn't 4 or 5-star quality. Filipinos run this place (not that that really matters). $22/person for AYCE.

We ordered edamame, calamari, a bunch of rolls and nigiri, and dessert.

Tracy II:
Salmon, avocado, jalapeño topped with salmon, lemon and sriracha. 3/5

Mountain: 
Shrimp tempura and crab salad topped with  salmon, tuna, yellowtail and snapper with eel sauce. 2/5

Sasa:
Shrimp tempura, spicy shrimp, cream cheese topped with salmon, toasted mayo eel sauce and sriracha. 4/5

Pain in the Ass:
Salmon, tuna, avocado and cream cheese...deep-fried and drizzled with wasabi mayo. For some reason, it tasted like banana. 3/5

Nigiri:
We had salmon (the cuts were good but slightly thin), tuna (we were given the worst cuts - end pieces that looked like several slices put together on top of rice), hamachi 2/5

Handrolls:
Soft shell crab was good. Salmon skin was too meaty and was not crispy at all, the juices from it were dripping. Presentation was great. 3/5

Calamari:
Lightly breaded and seasoned. Peppery has a light sauce at the bottom. Tasty...we ordered 2. 4/5

Strawberry Mochi and Green Tea Tempura Ice Cream:
Mochi and ice cream are pre-made and store-bought items but the green tea ice cream they used tasted like medicine. 2/5

The server told me they have sashimi, uni and amaebi for dinner AYCE. Good to know but I'll probably go somewhere else.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,1,3,j9U4sOp333mAHuvSuZXxnA

Our server was attentive and even took back the Cajun albacore that didn't taste so great. The volcano roll was yummy. The salmon, super white, and scallop nigiri were all fresh and plentiful on the fish to rice ratio. I used my Yelp checkin for a free sake! I went back again less than a week later and the service was horrible. It was a Wednesday night about 9pm and there was only one server handling the 3 tables there.

Everything delicious and no real complaints. Service was excellent from the sushi chefs and server. The fish slices on the nigiri were on the small side, but that's ok, just order more.

The sushi roll selection is similar to most places and my husband liked the rolls he ordered.  I was a little upset that they brought over a plate of tuna carpaccio and asked if we would like it.  I mean it's AYCE, if we wanted it, we would have ordered it!  Apparently the chef made it by mistake and was trying to offer it to different tables.  I saw them eventually take it to the back....since no one wanted it.  I also ordered yellowtail collar, although the outer cooked parts were good, most of the inside was raw and unedible...  They did have a sashimi option (1 order of one type of sashimi - about 5 pieces per person), which was a bonus that some other places do not offer.

They do have an all you can eat and drink option for about $32 bucks which I thought was a bit steep until I saw their specialty roll prices. For 10-13 bucks per specialty roll if you can eat at least three it's a bargin. 

I had the shrimp tempura roll and the California roll. Both were okay but the shrimp tempura was better for sure. I was not super impressed by the quality or the crazy amount of rice though. Give me more I the insides please!!!!

Tako was one of the best I've ever had. Superwhite and cajun albacore were probably my least favorite here. The chef prepared some off-the-menu, specials for us and they were DELICIOUS!

The chef was very friendly and took our orders quickly and produced plate after plate of tasty nigiri selections with nice sized portions of fish and easy on the rice (I'm sure this was due to the influence of my friend). Either way, the sushi was good for a neighborhood sushi restaurant and we ate our fill. The only hiccup was when we went to pay, nobody was keeping track of what we ordered, they just ""assumed"" we were on the AYCE. So we ended up paying the AYCE price for 2 people for dinner when we were being careful not to over order so it wouldn't be too expensive.

5733019,2016-10-22,0,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"I came in for the lunch buffet as soon as they opened (11am). I brought my appetite with me and had some time to kill so decided to write a detailed review. This is a LONG post, don't say I didn't warn you, lol. 

First of all, the people complaining about the staff/service must have come in at peak hours (when it can apparently get real crazy). For lunch on a weekday though, no one else was there but me. So of course, I got great service. Just putting that out there so other diners know what to expect. Also, for those doing AYCE, order HALF ROLLS so you don't fill up too quickly as most of their rolls are 8 pieces. 

Now for the food. Their (Ahi and Salmon) Poke Salad was one of the best I've had. Nice and fresh INCLUDING the seaweed. Many times I've ordered this at other (more expensive) places and the quality was sub par. So I've been kinda wary ever since. But Sasa Sushi's Poke Salad has restored the faith. 

The Miso Soup was just ok. There wasn't that much flavor but it wasn't too bland either. Safe to say I've had better. Next I had some Baked Green Mussel. This dish is a MUST TRY. I savored every bite! Their Shrimp Tempura was not that big but their Tempura Sauce is to die for! It's probably the best Tempura sauce I've ever tasted. Definitely recommend their Tempura selection if not for the sauce alone. 

Now for the rolls. I had two specialty rolls and one regular roll. First, the Spider Roll -- I've never seen it presented like this. They had it wrapped in yellow soy paper (as per the chef), and it was sweeter than most of the Spider Rolls I've had. Their soft shell crab didn't taste as natural (I guess) as what I've had before. Not to say that it wasn't fresh or tasty, it just didn't have that soft shell crab taste that I'm familiar with. 

Then I had the Volcano Roll -- which is baked, with scallops and sauce on top. Another must try! Their baked selection kind of has a distinct aftertaste that comes off as burnt foil I guess, but I only noticed that after I scarfed it down because it was just THAT good. 

At this point I was getting filled up so for my last order, I got the classic -- Rainbow Roll. This was much bigger than I expected and tasted as awesome as I thought it would. I gotta say, their raw fish selection is nice and fresh. For dessert I had the Red Bean Ice Cream only because I'm starting to get tired of the Green Tea it's like everywhere I go there's green tea flavored something but I digress. I also had the Mango Mochi which aside from it not being firmly frozen, was amazing. I recommend it!

That's about it. Parking is available right out front and they have a TV at the bar. The bathrooms are nice and clean and the chefs are awesome and attentive. This place is definitely worth a try. Overall, I give them a 4/5 star rating.",BWbVd6q6-Beu_NTamzkRjA,0,0,4,lrDtmxVfPBjtJxGZbHgJOQ

Service: PHENOMENAL. I'd probably go back JUST for the service. 

Food: the sushi was really bland. Didnt have enough flavor and rolls were not rolled tight so it fell apart. The pork belly appetizer was delicious, but it comes in many pieces so make sure not to over order because it does get heavy in your stomach. **They also offer one order of sashimi when you do the AYCE, but unfortunately we did not know about that until we were too full to eat any more.

That's really all I have to say about this place.",uutnjYooQZBURPx-BypvHw,0,0,3,YsShNdXjjWqiiKgIjuK1jQ

The chefs invent on the spot and when they're not busy will whip you up a creation based on your likes. The staff was friendly and funny! They have garnish and sauces I've never seen before and best of all the prices are reasonable! A must go!!!!,pp8rh_mWHhWPOXizPOagJA,0,0,5,SgC2gWZ0gf_KZ-yJNKnOpw

Checked In with Yelp! and received a FREE sake. The staff was helpful and friendly. My children were welcomed. The environment was cozy and inviting. 

Wish:
I hope Sasa Sushi extends to patio seating. (Hint: I let the itamae, sushi chef, know outdoor seating would be great with heaters and cool misters).",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,0,0,4,piBSI0s75hikq3e-5ltUoA

The rolls didn't impress me too much as they tasted a bit bland.  I think the rice was overcooked and under seasoned. 

I did like the nigiri as the size was great.

During this time my boyfriend decides to order a Sapporo. Their new Waiter Josh asked for his ID, no problem, and then takes 15 min with it up and down that small restaurant. Only to come back and tell us they're fake IDs. What? We clearly had no problem ordering one before and our IDs are clearly no fake. Listed every possible thing wrong with his ID. We decided to walk out and not even bother waiting for the sushi any longer.

My family and I just walked in to eat. No greeting,  no host, no server. So the sushi Chef points us in the direction of a table and let's us sit. Then the server walked out, asked how many in our party, then walks away shaking his head at us.
In walks a single patron after us who sits at the bar and he immediately gets her a drink....still we have yet to be greeted. Then he decides to take a phone order and help another guest all before greeting us.
I'd like to say that this is the first bad experience we've had at Sasa but since his arrival to the team it's been consistently terrible. I really wish I knew his name but he's 30ish, tall, dark hair, and the worst attitude in the industry.
We will never return. So disappointed because the sushi chefs and good are always wonderful.",h4X30KkTuSOX9hxmZDsNZQ,3,0,1,xkDDdH5lJoyuRqbUdTo7NA

5852759,2018-05-03,0,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"My experience was ""Meh"" at best. Upon reading the reviews with overwhelming positive reactions, I decided to eat here. The place wasn't busy at all and the servers were quick in response. Quality of fish was very poor. I always lower my expectations since I've tried sushi in Japan but this was considerably lower than that expectation. Nigiri was all I ate and the fish was definitely sub par. There were a few pieces that definitely had a sliver of fishiness to it. (Fish aren't supposed to taste ""fishy"" when fresh or handled correctly.) Although, the ratio between fish and rice was fine. I can't complain about price as it is average.

I've had better in the Valley at the same price. This was close and convenient though so I'd thought I'd give this place a try. I'll definitely be going somewhere else next time.",F7Vge_e4lEXtyBr6si5-2Q,0,0,2,M9Cl4ZYTdP-aJyJXqNwO3Q

5879493,2013-05-01,1,PChG1Dm0A6AXIXkXGVK8Fw,"My girlfriend and I were visiting some friends in Vegas last week and were told we had to check out this brand new AYCE sushi restaurant called Sasa (pronounced saw-saw). 

I liked this place from the moment we walked in. The interior was beautifully decorated, everything was clean and modern from the tables and chairs to the light fixtures. We were seated promptly and our server could not have been nicer.

Since we opted for the all you can eat option, we went to town and probably tried half the menu. We ordered all kinds of nigiri and sashimi including yellowtail, salmon, salmon belly, super white, and several types of tuna. We also got the fried tofu, a few orders of gyoza, yellowtail shoulder, and some miso of course. I rarely say this but I can honestly tell you that every single item we ordered was delicious! The fish was definitely fresh and of high quality, also the presentation was excellent. You can tell the chefs really love what they do because everything looked picture perfect. All the dishes appeared to be carefully pieced together and there were plenty of cool Japanese style garnishes that made for a nice presentation. My favorite items were the yellowtail sashimi and the ""Tracy II"" roll (if you like citrus and jalapeno flavors then it's an absolute must). Also the yellowtail shoulder was so delicious, it came out fully cooked but was remarkably flavorful and tender. We also ordered a bottle of cold sake which went unbelievably well with the food. I normally don't drink sake but the beverage menu was huge so we had to try something.

As for the service, everything came out fast and our server was really good about keeping our drinks topped off. The whole experience was just perfect, my girlfriend and I want to go back to this place as soon as possible. It's so rare to find food this good, especially for the price.",80lJs7ruIsQQgv7SezUeCA,4,2,5,UwsPnNjuZgK-nbiNAJsUtQ

I ordered take out from here and while I did get everything I ordered they also put some random nigiri in the box that after a lot of googling I think is squid. That might be lucky if you eat fish but I'm a vegan so it was kind of a problem for me. I didn't want to eat the rolls that had touched the fish so I ended up tossing out food that I paid for. Not that it really made a difference because my yellow radish rolls tasted like straight up fish too which was entirely off putting and I didn't really eat them either. I didn't eat anything really except my normal-tasting inari. Lesson learned - don't eat sushi in Vegas, I guess.",pWQNKfnnK4pJqHD29JGKqA,1,0,2,2MxIg5IlkndTRzpGlKvJ-g
