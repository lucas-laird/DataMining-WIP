242849,2015-08-28,2,h_NnD6TPuhIFy2ZdqOlUgQ,"Best sandwich in town for $4.99. Combo adds $2. Great desserts also cheaply-priced. Hidden behind a Jack-in-the-Box. Friendly owner/store manager guy.

Fantastic baklava!

Good call on the provolone. Be back real soon!

The person who left a 1-star rating is obviously a competitor or someone with a personal vendetta. Sandwiches are delicious and ingredients are fresh.

2 people who left a 3-star review only thought the deli's signage could be improved and that they didn't have enough Polish options. People have weird priorities. These are scores for the public, not your personal record. Weird.",4S2TVX7iiCws9vAYG9T0Ng,4,2,5,wLbIBf4n0RhmrBU93U9Eeg

All the regular deli meats are Boar's Head and reasonably priced. All the meats and cheeses were good and sliced super thin. For me through the real treasure is the baked goods. A large Cheery Apple Strudel for $1.75. A Euro desert sampler for $2.49. A chocolate on chocolate brownie that was amazing for $2.49. My Aunt got Tiramisu that she said was fantastic for $2.99.
They had lots of other imported grocery item, but I had to get out of there before I spent anymore money. I'll be back for sure.
Oh and try the Hot Cappy.........",NoONN8dswjSPnPKhtHgPjQ,0,0,5,Hi8cvNCL2dgJOjIL8n2tzg

1899243,2015-01-22,0,h_NnD6TPuhIFy2ZdqOlUgQ,"I actually found this place on a fluke.  I stopped by the good year to get my tires re inflated with nitrogen and was hungry and did a quick yelp search and saw this place.  

I walked in and was NOT impressed.  LOL  It just looked like your average gas station store until you walked in further and started to really look around.  They have the Milka brand chocolates from Europe.  A friend of mine introduced them to me and I have been in love ever since.  Now I have a quick spot to get them.  Yay!!  Yummy in my tummy!  =)

Sandwiches are all made with Boar's Head Meat and Cheese!  And they are not shy about piling on the meat.  I've had the sandwiches on their ciabatta and normal hoagie bread and both a awesome!  The ciabatta had a good crust and the hoagie had a great chew throughout.  They were both great compliments to the meat.  (5/5) for both sandwiches.  

Why the -1 star?  They have baklava which I LOVE but it was not your traditional one which they did not specify and it was soupy. . .and it was ok but not what I was expecting.  So that was -.5.  Now the other -.5 was for this Kreatopita kind of thing.  They called it something else but it was ground meat wrapped up in phyllo.  The phyllo was slightly still raw in the center.  =(  I was able to bake it more and it was delicious BUT they should make sure that all their pastries are full baked before selling it to their customers.  

Other then that, they did have a nice selections of other european style pastries and eurpean style goodies.  I will definitely be back to get another sandwich and to do a little shopping.  =)",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,3,1,4,5C-pgEK_8bRx7jYU75Z_UQ
2010538,2014-11-28,4,h_NnD6TPuhIFy2ZdqOlUgQ,"This European market is a new find for me- I usually just take my business to Jones Market but love to stumble upon and explore other options around town. Heads up that this place does not have a produce section, but they make up for it by having a deli with sandwiches baked goods. 

Exterior needs some work- appears to be a generic convenience store. Inside there are several rows and a few refrigerated sections, the aforementioned deli and a dine-in seating area, a ton of sweets/baked goods, and a large section of alcohol/wines and smoking paraphernalia/products. 

Staff is laid back, store is clean. 
Highly recommend the deli section- they have a bomb Italian sando, as well as a really good turkey BLT option that's great with mozzarella. The meats and cheeses are cut to order. Baked goods include breads (day-old for as low as TWENTY CENTS) as well as sweets (giant cupcakes for under $2). Pricing is good, selection is decent.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,3,3,L7P8Kvu-PCQToc743lTl2g
2040936,2017-03-23,2,h_NnD6TPuhIFy2ZdqOlUgQ,"Sandwiches are all $6.99 (even though the menu says $4.99). The price revamp means that their sandwiches are now bigger than before also. 


Carry Boars Head products in addition to several more specialized brands (names sound like they specialize in European deli meats. 

Deli is in the back of the store, store sells pantry groceries,  has a small Eastern European cheese section,  and also deals lots of odds and ends. Pipes, hookahs, incense, piercing jewelry, decorative knives (maybe they're not just decorative?) ,  regional coffee (I bought a strong Turkish blend), and chocolates among other stuff !",K8byELF3mfZxbVA_FPVo9w,5,2,4,PH9BOyQadzGD1RrsQ_GeFw

I went in looking for Polish food, but was sorely disappointing. They seem to have more Greek and Other European ideas going on.

The shelves are crammed with so many rare, amazing Balkan spices, canned/jarred foods, and treats that my eyes popped out of my head.

They have a cute seating area if you want to lunch.  My biggest thing is the quality meats & cheeses here,  they have boar's head I'm sold!  To top it off they have wifi while you wait. Ordered an Italian combo for $5. Some fine cheap eats.

 I can already see I may go here for most of our meats from here since it's 2 minutes away. If you call ahead they will have your order waiting for you. I was just checking out their website & they will do online orders as minimum purchase of $25.  WOW!

What really got me was it's a true European market, the vibes here make me feel at home. Even if they don't carry Portguese products, I'm still floored at the selection and wide varieties in such a seemingly small store. Great job.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,4,0,5,tb7zgRFnKIRzoemnsTD4Cg

Although they have quite a good selection of European goodies.  We bought some German and Lithuanian sausage.  They were both so tasty and were priced good.  
   They have local made European style breads.  We bought the Matnakash from Sugar Bees and it was delicious.   Their selection of European chocolate is impressive.  I still had some left from a recent trip or I would have stocked up on several varieties they sell.  
   The store is quite clean and easy to navigate the shelves filled with goodness.  The young lady behind the counter was very helpful and super friendly.  Looking forward to my next trip to acquire some more European goodies.",6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw,17,9,4,19HLIR_ciUD_ZCIuvNBPnQ

The Euro market is a mini super market that carries European goods. They have a pretty good selection of items though they are quite small. 

I'm usually browsing the snack aisle when I come here but they also have a baked goods sections with baklava and other pastries that look great as well. 

They carry a good selection of cold meats and cheeses that I'll eventually try one day.
