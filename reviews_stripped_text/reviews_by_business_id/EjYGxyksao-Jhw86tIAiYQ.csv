So i hit this today for lunch. Read reviews before and its near the J-O, so why not.. $4.50 lunch specials and the portions were BIG.. now i can destroy some food, but when they were bringing me my food, i was like Ohh Yeah, i'm going to sleep as soon as i get back to my desk.. Headphones + ITIS = ZZzzzzz... so i went with the pan fried noodles and chicken... My bad.. the lunch menu has a variety, and i plan to work my way through it..but that dish was just too bland..i mean it definitely wasn't my cup of tea..even with my cup of tea..but i will find something on that menu that will put a smile on my tastebuds..

This is arguably the best noodle house in Las Vegas. 

Best dumplings (or 'Water Dog' as my sister in law calls it. From Cantonese pronunciation) in town and surpass many restaurants in Los Angeles.

Try the 'Minute Chicken Cake Noodle', Garlic pan fried chicken on grilled noodle cake pieces. Very flavorful.

The rest of the items are average. Very good quality consider Las Vegas is not known for good Chinese food.. Very good service, courteous and helpful waitresses, an unusual attribute in Chinese restaurants.

Saw Noodle Palace.

Didn't feel like any compromise at all.

We (party of 2) were the first customers for the Dinner crowd.
And by the number of tables, crowd may be an understatement.

Service was spot on as one would expect being #1 & #2 customers.
Very sweet and attentive. Glad LV has a Chinatown!!

Didn't get any noodle dish this time, stayed with the basics.

Hot & Sour soup. 
Tasty. Unique from my experience, gelatinous base.
Waitress's  ""favorite"".

Chicken Curry over rice. 
Good portion, but quite frankly the least curry I've ever had on any Curry dish. Very pale yellow, pastel in color. Bring On the Dark Mustard Yellow quantity. I want to feel it.

Beef Tenderloin w/ Black Pepper sauce. 
 YUM!! 
Nice spice level.
Tender, Tasty, Try it!!

Great portions.
Great prices.
Great location.

No beer.
No fortune cookie?

Must try their noodle dishes next.

As for their Minute Chicken Cake Noodle it's not really a big deal.  If you're wondering what it is, it's actually pan fried noodle compressed into a cake style and they just put chicken and syrup over it.

A nice fried ball of dough, light and fluffy on the inside with a wonderful crisp outside dusted with powder sugar.  

Noodle palace has excellent lunch specials that start at $4.50 whether you want a hot bowl of wonton noodles, dumplings in soup, some fried rice, or chow fun.  You can't go wrong with chow fun for $4.50, especially when it comes out good and tasty.  

If you like roasted pork (the stuff with the nice crispy skin), this is the place to order some.  Forget the specialty chinese BBQ places like Sam Woo or BBQ King, at this place, the chef always gives you the best part of the pig.  A nice hunk of pork skin, minimal fat, no bone or bone chips like those other cheap chinese places, and some tasty meat.  Eat it with the hoisin sauce, and you will order it every time.  

Other dishes to try is the Salt and Pepper squid (chinese calamari), Salt and Pepper pork chop, Clams with black bean sauce, any vegetable with XO (don't really know what it means) sauce, or if you are craving noodles on a hot or cold day, the wonton egg noodles are delicious.  
Portions are a generous size, and the wait staff is always friendly, with quick service.  They are smart enough to take your order in english and help you decide what you want.

Overall, this is a nice cheap alternative to eating on the strip with good chinese food, good service, and always leaving with a doggy bag.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,0,0,4,nCpEToOzl8dlzp7EyCl_4A

*Pork and Shrimp Potstickers, dough made from spinach: never thought I'd see green potstickers in a fairly typical-looking noodle house, but these were a tasty take on an old favorite. 

*Cake Noodles: basically clumps of crispy noodles and gravy with fairly tender chicken perched atop. Not mind blowing, but you can't really go wrong w/ crispy house-made noodles.

*Pan Fried Noodles with XO Sauce: any idea what ""XO Sauce"" is? The only XO -- as in XOXO, as in Hugs and Kisses -- sauce I know isn't usually mixed with noodles, though sometimes it is consumed or swallowed. Anyway, Noodle House's (the Chef's?) XO sauce was subtle with a bit of kick at the end, and the dish was essentially a fairly straighforward chow mein with bbq pork and shrimp w/ veggies. Solid.

Can't go wrong for $30... Packing up our leftovers, I mentioned to our waitress ""Too bad you can't find good Manapua(Cha siu bao) here""

She slapped me on the shoulder saying 'We have Manapua AND Pork Hash!"" I hadn't seen it on the menu, but its posted along the back of the restaurant along with other off the menu items, such as your ghetto style Malasadas(Fried Pilsbury Biscuit dough) so for any of  you looking for Manapua or Pork Hash, they serve it at Noodle Palace. Next time, I'll take an extra 5 minutes to read their other off the menu items and to avoid another possible slap....ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,2,1,4,RXo_5TUvw-l_MJizJ2PjpA

Got the Shrimp dumpling noodle soup, dad got Malaysian chow fun, and another dish, the wet beef chow fun (you know). It was all good. I'm not sure if there was any shrimp in my dumpling, nothing like Wonton House in SF,CA. The noodles were okay, they say all the noodles are made by one company for all the Asian restaurants in LV. I tried soaking it in the soup a little longer, but the soup wasn't hot enough to make it softer (the way I like it). 

The Malaysian chow fun was good, they kind of just added yellow curry powder to show fun and called it Malaysian, it was still tasty, the flavor is probably different for people who haven't had that curry before. The wet beef chow fun was very good. A lot of sauce for all the noodles. 

The place has good lighting and a very relaxed feel. Good place for lunch.",kmxA9_lUmg7lmwJvMVJN7w,1,0,4,cRlpQRUypWHzD3wBnK66lw

Went during lunch and had the shrimp dumpling with noodles for $4.50 and saw that they had chicken feet for $1.99 so got that too.
The dumplings were actually very good, good enough to bring mom's here when she comes to town- I think she might approve!
The chicken feet were okay, I've had better but these were good enough for the price.

The place was half full when I arrived and only had one person waiting on everyone but service was somewhat attentive and they spoke pretty good English.  Most of the patrons spoke Cantonese so that's always a good sign.  I also noticed that they had a lot of Hawaiian entrees posted on their walls..will have to bring my Hawaiian friends here next time also!

Spice it up with their oil based hot sauce and I'm a happy man.  Try the pan fried rice noodle with beef in brown sauce, it's yummy.   If this place was closer, I'd go there everyday !
      If you come on a holiday weekend, they have NO lunch specials, just the regular menu.  I've seen people (regulars, I suppose)  get up and leave because of this.  It's funny because the regular menu is only $2 at most more.  It'll be hard to beat those prices unless you go to Micky D's.

It was a bit bland, but that was not a problem with a little pepper and chili. I like the price of all the food, and the portions were big. There was 5 of us, and we had 5 entrees and hot and sour soup.

The duck was very good. The shrimp fried rice was ok, was nothing special. We did clean this plate first. They did have a milk tea w/ boba for 2.50 and it was a large! A couple places now a days charge 4-5 bucks for a large. Service was good and food did not take that long.",3yPrXlvbECGKHSZTy9usWA,1,0,3,7nJHak-z4gZl6MgswyM13g

We ordered so many things, I don't remember it all. All I know is that it was all good. Family style dining at its best! In particular, I enjoyed the Minute Chicken Cake Noodle and the Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodle (that one is an old favorite of mine and it's been years since I've had a well-made plate of it).

I had a simple BBQ rice plate first time and the 2nd some Walnut Prawns and we shared some simple Chinese broccoli and roast pork. I even took a green onion pancake to go. It was cheap and solid. 

Went back with my BF and it was actually kinda yucky. Got some mixed meat and seafood crispy/dry style noodle..I bit into raw shrimps and squid tasted too ""seafood-y"", definitely not fresh at all. We also had the porkchops and those were alright. 

I guess I'm staying away from the mixed seafood for a bit, but maybe too it was an off night. Still it's enough for the BF not wanting to go back. I'll try to try it alone and weigh in on it again.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,1,3,2MbDLL_EouNffExDBbsBzg

Salt and pepper pork and Vegtables dishes. 
they do offer some dim sum stuff here but not worth it, go somewhere else if you really want dimsum.

Service is typical of a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown; friendly and simple. The prices are very reasonable.

Their made-from-scratch noodles are delicious in every way. Their Hawaiian Noodle Cakes are one of the most popular items on the menu and it deserves to be. They have many varieties of noodles such as spinach, tomato, or carrot flavored noodles. And let me point this out, that glass jar full of chili in the condiment basket on every table is a ONE-of-a-kind awesome! Slather some on your dishes and you'll know why (if you're a spicy food lover). The X.O. Chow Fun is good but it's oily good.",2QKg3LZWOCWNZhKNulShHA,0,0,5,l7ifACzupkV97mGEbsZkog

To find a really good Chinese place, you want to keep it to your self, so no one else goes, but it's not easy to keep it on the down low, when a place is really good. 

I love their minute chicken with cake noodle. The chicken is small bite size pieces crispy on outside, with good flavor through out, then the cake noodle is cut into blocks, fried until crispy but remains soft inside, and they add the sauce, it's too good to describe. 

My other favorite here is their eggplant with pork, the sauce is so good, you can add It to your rice and make it a meal. We will usually get sweet and sour something, tonight it was shrimp, it was tasty, but I can leave it, it's my hubby that insist we get it every time. 

Overall, we have been here many times, and even when it's just him and me, we order plenty, the flavors are consistent and they way we like em, they do remind us of the Hawaii Chinese we miss.

Definitely worth the trip and inexpensive to boot.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,2,4,tNcCaJPtJoh76It6K0rAkQ
