Once my order was taken the lady brought the money to the cook he counted it and stuffed it in his pants. After that he never change his gloves and continued to cook people's food. I asked the register lady to have him change his gloves and she dismissed me like a child. So then I took it upon myself to tell him to change his gloves after handling money. He got all pissy and slowly changed them after was told twice. Gross! Food is good but the service sucks at this location!,CzFAS7VI2-MuEiEduGJrJw,0,0,1,Tw_zXzuJ70GBkSjeM5lf6A

Purchased a Groupon for $14, but it is supposedly worth $28. The Groupon will print two, therefore, you'll have two $14 Groupon Vouchers. We were approached by John (Asian young Guy). While we are looking at the Menu up above on the wall, he was getting impatient. We asked him questions about the menu and he was Curt on answering. I finally gave him the two Groupons vouchers and he said he can only use one per visit. I told him why does the website sell two vouchers at the same time if you can only use one per visit? He doesn't know?

Since there are four of us, wife and two kids, my wife will use one and I will use the other and make two separate receipts. He told me I already know that you're together so he can't do that! I can't believe what I'm hearing. So I just used one Groupon and proceeded the order. This person does not have any customer service skills and tact to deal with customers. Since we're from Cali, we've basically going to throw away the other Groupon voucher.

The food was okay, but the large plate should be a Medium. The steak has a lot tendons that you can't eat.",uHWjQ_ZJSs9aVbL4P7Xszw,0,0,2,VZ1nsumj3D7MwfutGoUsIg

Second time I've been in here I chose the beef and rice bowl and two spring rolls!The bowl was quite Ok, again, but the spring roll was the softest spring roll I ever saw.So, asking about the state is in at the counter, first of all the guy was having an attitude , like how can I ask about this, why the roll was so soft and watery?
Seconfd of all, I asked for two, I paid for two and i got one!I presume the guy was too busy watching the football in the kitchen then to take care of the customers.
Now i'm not making a fuzz because of the thing that I paid for something and I got something else, it is all about the attitude!
There are just too many food joints around for me to ever go to this one again!
I don't want to get attitude for my money, that's it!
I don't care I paid more than I received , but receiving crap attitude instead of goodies is not Ok for me!

This dish visually was not super appealing and did not even come close to the picture on the menu; it also looked very dark and almost burnt. That old saying looks can be deceiving, well in this case they weren't, the steak was over-cooked and the rice tasted like it had been sitting for awhile. This dish got better once I smothered it in Sriracha and some extra teriyaki sauce. The broccoli was actually cooked well and tasted fresh, which besides the extra sauces, is what probably saved this dish. 

The egg rolls here are very interesting. Normally egg rolls are filled with veggies or meat or both and fried. Theses were stuffed, fried and then toasted? I'm not sure if they did this to heat them up or keep them crispy, but they just came out burnt and tasting bitter. The Samurai food gods would be displeased with such disrespect for the egg roll. 

This was almost a two star rating, but this place is very clean and the customer service here is quick and helpful. I might give another location a second chance.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,3,2,3,5WKGwcjuKLVZ2EPvIRQ3CQ
2982785,2018-01-26,0,dYpnpMZowfGsCisHhABPZg,"Samurai Sam's would have gotten a 4 or a 5 star review, as the food is actually pretty consistent, flavorful, fairly healthy and at a good price point.

The issue I very often find, is that there is a HARD up sell at the register.  

At the register and outside the building on banners, they advertise a $5 bowl of dark meat chicken, white rice and veggies.   It's very clear what comes in that dish.  What happens nearly every time I go, is that the person at the register attempts the up sell, asking you if you want to add white meat chicken, steak, brown rice, noodles, extra spice, etc.  Each of which come at an additional charge.  Choosing these options push a $5 bowl up to the $10+ range.  Mind you, the menu has all of these options is other dishes available at their respective price points.

When a customer doesn't know this, they are caught off guard by the price, yet often times don't protest or even mention it.  I witnessed this twice in this location today.

When I order and clearly state: ""I'd like a $5 bowl, as it comes, with dark meat and white rice"" that is exactly what I desire.  Why the additional hard up sell?  

This aspect makes it hard to keep coming back.",8SA_kXfjEm58EgjvO3LbYg,0,0,3,_RgwMEJ7fIdrC3DhVPZw4A

This place is located on Las Vegas Boulevard not too far from 15 and the strip/outlet mall so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself has a typical fast food layout, and can get a little crowded at times so you should maybe avoid the lunch and dinner rush hour. Keep in mind that this place is rather small.

We had chicken teriyaki bowls and salmon bowls and they all tasted ok even though some of the items could have used a little more effort in the cooking process. The rice was ok, but not amazing and the meat was a bit overcooked. The price is quite reasonable for what you get. Expect to pay around $8 for most items and also expect to be filled after that. 

In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it, if you can overlook the little cooking issues. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",JR7AYVUJ1_Nq36UBW3XHYw,1,0,3,t_idrOVAwvayGayIxElINg

Samurai Sam's is known for their large $5 teriyaki bowls. Though NOT the best I've ever had, it's reasonable enough to continue coming back for. You have a choice of white or dark meat, white or brown rice, all with a side of veggies. It's served insanely quick (which always makes me question the shelf life hmm) but it's consistently filling and healthy-ish.

The employees are kind and efficient, which is why three and a half turns into four stars. Yay!

Additionally, this place is a Surf City Squeeze hybrid. The coconut pineapple orange smoothie is pretty good. A little thick, but still makes you feel like Seth Rogen and his healthy AF meme.

A few recommendations...
- The large bowl is only $5. (it comes with rice AND veggies)
- Go for double meat. It's not much more and it lowers your carb-to-protein ratio.
- Brown rice is worth a few extra cents.
- Upgrade to a combo which gets you a drink & a side. I get the crab puffs. YUMMY!
- If you get all veggies and no rice, they tack on several dollars. I think they over charge for this. Just my humble opinion. ;)",EpD7gvvA7z0XhksxIqe9vg,0,1,4,HJIyDdvAy0hG98XrValbKg

3891275,2013-02-14,1,dYpnpMZowfGsCisHhABPZg,"My buddy and I went here for a quick lunch because we had a buy one get one coupon. Actually we had two of them. One came from the Entertainment Book and another I found on the website. We walk in and its lunch hour. It's busy. It's noisy. It's chaotic. The guy at the counter is getting stressed so someone I assumed to be a manager relieved him and started taking orders. 

It comes to our turn and we order according to our buy one Teriyaki bowl get one free coupon. We were told that we couldn't use the coupon there. So I said well do you take other coupons. The guy at the register tells me, ""If they are for our store then maybe."" Well, I'm not trying to pass off a grocery coupon here guy.... so we try another Samurai Sam's coupon. He looks at it for a minute and points out the small print. 

""See? At participating locations only."" 
""So I take it you are not a participating location?""
He just shakes his head no. 

Now, I dunno... I'm no big business person. But This just got us off on the wrong foot. This and a few other reasons is why I won't go back to Samurai Sam's. I live about a mile from the place too. It is highly likely that if the food was good and there were no hassles with the coupons when ordering. I would have come back many times - without a coupon even! So wouldn't it be worth the say... $5 Teriyaki bowl to retain someone that is going to return and spend far beyond the cost of the bowl you gave away with the coupon I was trying to use? 

It just doesn't make sense to me but oh well. 

We were already there so we order anyway. Now keep in mind I'm irked about the coupon situation so my outlook on the Samurai Sam experience could be a bit tainted. 

We get our food and my rice was really dry. It didn't seem done. The veggies were ok. Just blech. Not much flavor. The chicken was decent and fortunately the whole thing was coved in Teriyaki sauce which made it edible.
