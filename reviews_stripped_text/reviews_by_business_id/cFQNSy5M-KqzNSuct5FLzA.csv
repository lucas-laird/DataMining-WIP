Got a chocolate malt, a manhattan ( ? ) - chili, cheese, mustard and onions ( or was it a brooklyn ? ) fries and onion rings.  Total cost $10.56

The highlight ...not many ...fries were decent.  Onion rings - very good.  

lows - the hot dog was somewhat boring - chili is ok;  The malt is disappointing in that the malt was clumped into lil mini malt balls - which meant a large portion of the malt was more of a shake.

I did the drive thru - the place is smaller in size then Sammy's 

I won't return.

Lets talk about the most positive and latest visit I had.  So I go to the drive thru and I ordered three dogs.  One chili cheese plain, another the same type of dog but with onions, and the last was stacked with all kinds of stuff to include peppers.  

The point being is that I went to the park west of Oakey and Rainbow to sit and eat the hotdogs and when I went for a bite the buns were already soggy and the hotdogs ripping through the bun without effort.  I can't imagine what it would be like for everyone else who has to travel farther with their hotdog.  

But what I come to find out from this place: cheaper is better.  Seriously, the cheaper item on the menu tastes better and hold their own altogether.  And sure I can just sit in the same parking lot and eat my hotdog but it would be nice to have some small tables and chairs out if I wanted to walk up and eat it right there.

Came back for more torture, got one hotdog but this time I ordered the rings.  Should have stayed away from the grease but I'm doing double time at the gym now.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,3,1,2,B-bnk5-iqPeOa0x7gCQuLQ

If so, I'd love to talk to them and tell them the mistakes I think they are making based on my personal experiences. The links themselves were good, but the polish was only so-so.  The buns got soggy and they really seemed like the basic hot dog bun you get at the store. Find a local baker to make you some premium buns.  You are charging a premium price so don't cheap out. The auto fry is only good for the occasional batch, the fries were crispy, but the rings were undercooked. They probably would have been great had the oil been at frying temp. It would be nice If there was some place to sit. Convince the landlord to let you take up a couple spaces and put in a patio.  Maybe these are just growing pains. I will try this place again in a few months, but right now Sonic has a better New York and Chicago dog.  That being said, I am rooting for you guys to succeed.",XPNiTbrKL7f0_6L0lrbZlg,2,0,2,8GwIkl6DbwNE1zSQ0k-myQ
