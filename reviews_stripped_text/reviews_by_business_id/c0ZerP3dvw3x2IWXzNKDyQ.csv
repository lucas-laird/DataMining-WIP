The quality of the steak is pretty bad and is always well done no matter how you order it, but who cares, you're probably drunk. Unfortunately, the price was recently raised to $8. Yeah, I'm complaining over $3. That's a 60% increase!!! You may think that's not very much. If that's the case, then you won't think a 60% decrease in my rating of this place is very much.

Hint: Go to Hard Rock. If you're going to pay a little more, then you might as well put it into a taxi ride to the Hard Rock and get a better quality steak that's actually medium rare. You'll need a players card to get it for $5 though. Worth the trouble for me.

Note: Ignore everything I said if you go to Drai's. Location and convenience outweighs the $3 lol",9ELoiypn3xPBSlyIfkOygw,0,0,2,VCojJ9NoJgMeLDPKBundag

And here is my review: Puke!

Their main feature is a $5.99 steak and eggs breakfast.  Right away I know that $5.99 is not going to get you edible meat unless you're in Argentina or someplace.  And even then....  I didn't order the steak and eggs but based on the faces of those who did (contorted, painful faces with valient jaws working their way through the meat) I can tell you skip the steak.

In fact, I can tell you, skip this place altogether unless you don't believe that any restaurant can screw up breakfast.  If you do go, try the skillet breakfast, that looked edible at least.  The toast was pretty limp, more like a shoe liner after standing on it for 4 hours at the craps table than a piece of toast.

I had the eggs benedict.  Idiot! Why would I order something like that? Eggs were overdone and cooked the day before.  You get your money's worth of canadian bacon because it was a slab (as opposed to a slice), and the English muffin never met the toaster in person.

the late night menu has bar food type apps and there's a few breakfast options, Chinese food menu and i believe fish and chips and a steak dinner option. but its pretty much the norm to come and get the late night steak and egg special for 6.99, the special consists of a thin but large steak, hash browns (think grocers freezer isle), large buttered toast slices, 2 eggs (your way) i sometimes omit the eggs for more hash browns. 

it's certainly not the best quality food, but its pretty decent and a great option to come relax your feet and soak up some of the alcohol after clubbing.

It's cheap, too, especially if you go during the hours they offer specials, which for me is when I wake up, which is 5 AM no matter what timezone I'm in. It's fun to get up in the morning, go right to a casino and see people who are still several hours away from winding down for the evening. Then over to cheap breakfast. 

I'll admit I didn't go to EVERY place in Las Vegas-- it has gotten just enormous, out of control. It's a nice vacation from New York because it makes you realize just how much worse New York could be. Instead of a couple people every block handing you advertising flyers and cards, you have a HUNDRED guys lining the blocks, so it's like running a gauntlet-- forcing these cards in your face, which you then see littering the sidewalks. Glossy business cards with graphic pictures and descriptions of sex with children and animals. Even for someone like me who is occasionally amused by the extreme, I was nauseated. 

There used to be famous cheap buffets where they pretty much paid you to eat, assuming you were gambling. There are some pretty amazing buffets, sure, but they cost much more now, and to me it just doesn't make sense to have Thanksgiving dinner more than once a year. Unless you bring you pants with plastic pockets or you have a hollow leg or something, how much do you really want to eat at one sitting?

Also, I was looking for a real, actual slot machine where you put in an actual metal disk, whether a coin, which would be preferable, or a token, which would make some actual mechanical things inside spin around, and if you won, send coins cascading out the bottom. I should have done more research on this, but all I could find were slot machines that faked the sound of gears turning and printed out little receipts like an ATM. Occasionally they might have a lever you could pull that did nothing-- except make you feel like an idiot.

A low key restaurant located at the back of the casino had a very old fashioned vibe with their old red leather booths and knick knacks.

I was surprised that they had a bunch of Chinese food on the menu, but I didn't trust it so I opted for the open-faced turkey sandwich. This dish was basically Thanksgiving on a plate; tender sliced turkey topped with gravy on white bread served with delicious mashed potatoes, steamed veggies, and sage stuffing (which was actually quite good). There was even a small side of cranberry relish. While the bread was the weakest link, everything else was good. The boyfriend felt daring and ordered the sweet and sour chicken...surprisingly, these chunks of breaded fried chicken had a very crisp exterior, little breading, and a good chicken the breading ratio. It definitely beat out the quality you'd get at a chain like Panda Express. Not the best or more traditional dish, but if you're looking for some fried food to nurse that hangover, it can get the job done. Service was incredibly friendly (we had one sassy waitress) and the overall our light lunch was good enough for us to consider coming in here again.",gvyYZgFdBbcT3xGjWOvZag,4,4,3,epzJ1o-sJwRnV-G_Ot3cnw

The special comes with a nice sized steak, hash browns, 2 eggs and toast. I ordered my steak rare... since I figured at a place like this it would come to me perfectly medium rare and it was soooo good.

Well some guys might argue with me but I think it's the best thing you can get at 3 am on the strip at that price haha. 

Keep in mind that the wait can get long around 12-3 am. You can always put your name down though and go play a few games in the casino which is literally right there. I don't recommend waiting around near the restaurant with the other drunks... Last time I was there my group of girls were in the middle of a fight between 4 drunk guys and it was scary. I'm not saying we were to blame but it really came across as a buck fight. Boys can be stupid. Hello, it's a casino. There are security personal everywhere AND cameras!

Every time I've gone since my 21st, the quality has been the same. I like consistency. My steak always comes straight from the grill piping hot and dripping with fatty goodness. I always get my eggs over easy since I like eating it on top of my toast and having the creamy yolk spill everywhere. The eggs are decent as are the hash browns. I love that they are crispy on top.

It's about 5am on a Friday morning. My bf and I are at Flamingo, ya know..drankin' and gamblin' a bit...Then it hits me: I'm hungry.

Hmm, well he HAD been stuck on trying some ""steak and eggs"" in Vegas. (Why? Your guess is as good as mine. lol). More specifically, steak and eggs from Bill's (which just happened to be RIGHT next door to the Flamingo). All the ads we had seen said that they had some breakfast specials from 12-8am. Perfect. 

So we head over to Bill's and as we get closer to the Victorian Room (It's in the far, back, right corner of the casino) I notice a line. WHAT?!!? Then the thought crossed my mind: Could this place be...GOOD?

No. It wasn't. 

First of all we put our name on the wait list, and the hostess told us that they would call us within 10-15 minutes on the overhead speakers. So we agreed to gamble for a bit until they called us. 20 minutes later...nothing. 

We go to check, and there was no more wait or line. WTF? Our name was never called or anything. So we get seated and I ask for the 3 egg special that they advertised on the side of the building. I ask for egg whites and the waitress, shook her head and said ""No, sweetie. The eggs have to be regular for the special"". Seriously? If you can't do egg whites, fine...but you really don't have to be condescending. Get outta mah face. From that moment on, I knew it was NOT gonna be good. 

In short:
-The table next to us was REALLLLLLLLY loud. Screaming/laughing..the works. It was just really annoying.  Not my type of crowd. 
-The AC was on FULL BLAST. I was shivering! I get that it's Vegas and it gets hot outside...but at 5am? =(
-My eggs were awful. They were watery and seemed like powdered eggs. Very gross. I had to DROWN them in ketchup just to stomach them. =/

I've always wondered if I had the potential to become a boozy, loud-mouthed gambler who would think nothing of eating a $4.99 plate of rare meat at 3AM. 

Well, I had to settle for eating here for lunch before boarding my plane back home to San Francisco. The price at a reasonable dining hour is $14.95 - since I assume the owners think you're too sober to judge the price too strictly. Bill's is meant to look like a Barbary Coast gambling hall, so the Victorian Room couldn't be anything but red naugahyde booths and faux-walnut walls. I think it's a stitch that half the menu is meat and potatoes and the other half is a Chinese buffet selection. 

Naturally I went for a slab of their prime rib, which was blood-rare, no questions asked. It came with a bowl of fluffed-up butter, a bowl of au jus sauce, and a small baked potato dwarfed by two containers of sour cream. Oh but first were the house salad, iceberg lettuce and croutons covered liberally with a ranch dressing, and a roll with a couple of pats of frozen butter. Yeah I ate it all.

In search of cheap eats, everyone was dragging their feet while complaining about walking too far for breakfast on our last day in Vegas.  ""There it is!""  I pointed to the poster ad in front of Bill's Gamblin' Casino.  ""They have $4.99 breakfast special!"".  I went way over my budget as I painlessly withdrew the last $80 dollars to hopefully cover part of our meal.  We walked through one of the oldest casino I've ever been to, still set in the aged dark wood and red leather upholstery that's never seen or ever a reason for remodel.  Leaded faux Tiffany style mirrors lined the bars, olfaction of endless cigars, ubiquitous Dry Manhattans and Martinis, betraying gambling coins beckon indulgences of yesteryear.

We found the cafe and lined up right behind the octogenerians who seem to frequent this place.  I went up to the hostess and told her we have a party of eleven.  Without skipping a beat, with a little empathy on her face, she said  ""You know that the $4.99 special is only from midnight to 8am, right?  It's regular price now"".  Did I look that transparent?   Was it the look of despair on my face she often sees in many who end up here, right in this very casino?   Good gosh, that is why I don't play poker! 

""How much cash do you have left?""  I asked my hubby.  Whew, what he had will cover the rest, if needed be.  We were all seated promptly at a comfy circular booth.  Our sweet server came out with our coffees...not bad at all.  I went for the homemade Corned Beef Hash with eggs overeasy($12.99), which is comforting to me as it reminds me of my Mommy Dearest's. Hubby decided on the Big Deal ($12.99) and litte cutie pie had the sourdough toast with jam and a bowl of strawberries ($4.99).  I looked around and everyone was tired and beat, but happy and content at the same time.  

Several weeks ago I was having a discussion with a girlfriend about our trip.  Knowing how frugal I am, she scrunched up her nose and told me ""Girl!  This is Vegas.  Go get crazy and wild.  Live it up and you won't regret it!""  It was a great advice.  My Mommy Dearest told us that this is the best birthday party she'd ever had.   

The bill came and Mommy Dearest snagged it!  She paid for the whole breakfast.   Afterwards, we all headed down the strip to our passenger van and head back home.   I, a trasplanted island girl from the Sonoran desert, with my hair in a pony tail, a coral summer dress, $5 slippers from Old Navy, cheap sunglasses and turquoise D&G purse, had my party dress and heels all packed away and glad to be on my way home.  The unspent $80 dollars were burning a hole in my pocket...but my frugality prevailed this time.

Just as a side note - I am not snobby at all, I do have a lower set of standards when it comes to cheap steaks like this. But really, I've had better steak at this price. If you want good cheap steak & eggs, go to Ellis Island for $4.99 steak & eggs - it's two bucks less, and actually good.

The waitress was a little less than keen on serving. She kept me waiting, then spilt water on my phone and generally just annoyed me. I may be expecting too much, but the place was pretty empty so it's not like she was crazy busy.

May be the fun is being drunk and coming her early in the morning.

Especially ideal since you are probably broke and/or drunk from gambling all night and somehow stumble into this place. Plan on waiting around 20 minutes to get in, and then plan on eating some moderately questionable steak if you are sober, otherwise deliciously unquestionable steak if you have been drinking. Furthermore, its in Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon, so that right there is reason enough. The crowd in the Victorian Room is a great mix of passed out people eating by their sad-sad selves to groups of people coming down from their X-induced dance-fests at some stupid club where they waited 3 hours to get in only to pay $20 a drink after spending the afternoon putting their faces on.",d3hJX_LRO5bIgeRN_wgwEw,0,0,4,k_O1ZZrGIDhQCUPFuhLZwA
4462400,2009-03-12,6,c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ,"When those in my generation look back on our childhood, we nostalgically remember television jingles for soda pop, tobacco and laundry detergent (e.g., ""I'd like to teach the world to sing..."", ""Winston tastes good like a cigarette should"", and ""Ajax - laundry detergent - is stronger than dirt""). Etched into our memories are also iconic moments such as listening to Jim McKay intone, ""the thrill of victory...and the agony of defeat...,"" whilst watching a hapless skier have the worst wipe-out of all time. Another such memory is hearing Earl Scheib drawl, ""I'll paint any car any color for twenty-nine ninety-five!""
 
One of the first ad signs I noticed when I arrived in Las Vegas during a recent vacation was posted in bold letters along the side of Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Casino: 
 
$4.99 Ribeye and Eggs. Midnight until 6:00 AM.
 
I immediately felt a stab of nostalgia and thought of Earl Scheib whose paint jobs were infamous for their cheap quality as well as their cheap price. I tried to imagine just how terrible this meal could be and turned to my wife and friends saying, ""We have got to try that!""
 
The following day was filled with the stuff most tourists do when they visit: walking a lot, shopping and gambling, taking a ride on NYNY's roller coaster (three stars), eating an excellent dinner at Olives in the Bellagio (four stars), watching the odd but very entertaining fusion of ballet, Olympic diving, synchronized swimming and circus acts that makes up Cirque du Soleil's O (three stars), and dancing on Cleopatra's Barge at Caesar's Palace (four stars).
 
As midnight approached, we were working up quite an appetite for late-night munchies and decided the time had come to try out the ridiculously cheap ribeye and eggs at the Victorian Room. A lot of other people must have had the same idea. I'm guessing that midnight is the peak hour for this place. We had a twenty minute wait to be seated which we spent throwing money away in cheap slot machines near the entrance (the back of Bill's) so we could hear when our name was called.
 
Once ensconced in our booth, our order was taken and the food was delivered extremely quickly. I requested that my eggs be cooked over easy and the meal came with hash browns. The moment of truth had come--just how bad could it be? As it turns out, it wasn't bad at all. Their secret is simple: the ribeye is about 1/8"" thick and heavily seasoned which is a good tactic for making mediocre meat tasty (it was too thin to be chewy). I thoroughly enjoyed swirling bite-sized chunks of steak in my runny eggs and mopping the whole thing up later with the delicious hash browns. It was the perfect way to end a long day in Vegas.

Its stained glass windows, flowered curtains and red patent leather booths give this restaurant a reasonably ""Victorian"" feel. What catches you by surprise is that half the menu is Chinese fare. I was only able to resolve this dilemma when I realized they were styling the place after Victorian-era San Francisco and this was the Chinatown element.

Part of the nostalgia that drew me here in the first place was based on my previous Vegas trip 30 years ago. Back then, $1.99 steak and egg specials were being promoted. I suspect that this $4.99 ribeye and egg special is the closest you're going to get to that, which isn't bad when you realize that it now costs at least $359.99 for Earl Scheib to paint your car.",3q-JsCIOag6nlZaXRLNa4g,5,5,3,diva5l8SDyrf7CySfHW11w

This restaurant is located in a small, I'm guessing low-star hotel & casino. It's ambiance is like a small version of Marie Callender's and its food is like Norm's.

The bf and I both ordered the steak and eggs special and both of our orders came out LITERALLY 2 minutes after we put it in. Wow, 2 minutes to cook a medium well steak? If it sounds too good to be true, it's because it was! My steak was cold and both of our eggs were not fully cooked. It's pretty obvious here that they precook the steaks.

After waiting on the list for a while, he was seated in the corner and they all ordered the $4.99 steak, hash browns, and eggs special.  The rib eye steak was a poor excuse for a slab of meat, and even the toast they served was thicker.  The eggs were mediocre, and the hash browns were greasy and soggy.  Even while drunk, it was not a very good meal.

After leaving for a minute and sitting down again with another friend for another meal, they waited over 10 minutes without getting service.  Thinking hard about the combination of poor food and slow service, they got up and left the restaurant, vowing to never return again.

So we skipped going to Drais and decided to eat here. The place was packed and waited about 10 minutes for our tableS. Yes, table is plural because they couldn't find us a table for 7 but two tables for 3 and 4. We were hungry women and honestly didn't care. 

After my table got our order, a nearby table became vacant. We asked our waiter if it was okay if our friends could move to that table. He said yes and the ladies moved there. Next thing you know, we get the hostess, who was this old lady, come over to our table and gave us a thing or two about the other group moving, AFTER we told her the waiter said it would be okay. I guess she had a rough night already, but seriously, she didn't have to do that to us. 

Any way, we didn't want that lady to spoil our night or appetite, and we were so happy when our food arrived shortly after her tantrum. Steak and eggs, hashed browns, and guess what?! BUTTERED TOAST! The toast is already buttered for you and it was mm mmm good! With a slab of jelly on that it was delicious! Eggs were yum, as well as the hashed browns and the steak was okay, but that's what you get I guess when it's $5.99.

It's juicy with a moderare fat, cooked right, comes with fries or a potato. At the Victorian, all of the servers are Asian and they even have a part of the menu that's dedicated to Asian cuisine. Either Asians are taking over or this place may be suffering from an identity crisis.",c9PwtsNozIxJ5NDMT5C9qQ,1,2,4,YSTxdz_-DgxaeiLH5A8ORg

i waited til a minute past midnite to come by here due to lent and this being friday nite. and by ""waiting"" i mean, drinking. if i can't eat meat, then i'm drinking. a lot. 

the appetite that develops when one spends an exorbitant amount of time drinking and not eating is indiscribable. kind of like trying to describe the beauty of a newborn child or sunsets. 

left and right the steak and eggs were flying. it was THE thing to get here. considering the price (even though i apparently paid more), you get a pretty good sized NY steak. it comes with hashbrowns and toast, but we ordered fries too. sunny side up yolk is soppy bread goodness. steak was tender and the table has A1. damn, i almost wanted to order another one. had i  been able to find my wallet, i probably would've. 

great late nite drunky food.",R12GCq7XczBpP99KzenLAQ,0,0,4,y0rK53ZqDg-0Y659xOSCfA

The only reason we came here is because our regular spot for steak and eggs was far from Caesars and this was right across the street.

1st: There was a 15min wait, never had to wait for steak and eggs EVER

2nd: Service sucked, it took the waiter another 15min to come over and greet us and take our order

3rd: our food was just nasty the hash browns were like noodles which was weird! Never seen anything like that. And on top were soggy. Good thing they have A1 sauce to go with my steak or else I would've been pissed

4th: Looked at their regular menu and everything is WAAAAAY OVER PRICED. I was checking out the side menu and it was $3.99 for an egg. I can buy a whole dozen for that. Couldn't believe it.

Definitely wont be coming back here. Go to Marilyns at Tuscany. No wait and their steak is actually decent for the price. Plus its $3.99 there!!",C7qczjBIVlJaUmvSGJdoFA,0,0,1,3bvB0nNdDR9AyK3VUrj6rQ
5383766,2013-01-02,0,c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ,"My family wanted to eat a good and cheap Christmas dinner as we were going to hit the buffets the next day. Known for the prime rib and steak and egg specials, Victorian Cafe was our destination that cold Christmas night. We got there around 9:30 PM and although there were a few empty tables, we were seated about ten minutes after we got there. Something about having to wait for the waitress to seat us. 

Anyway, I scanned the Yelp reviews on what was good, and decided to go with their prime rib special, which is usually $12.99 but on that day, was raised to $13.99. Too bad the steak and egg special is valid only after 11 PM. Each prime rib special comes with a salad or soup and fries, mashed potatoes or a baked potato. And of course, the table gets a basket full of hot rolls and butter. 

The salad and rolls were delicious, but we all wanted to save our appetites for the prime rib. (We all ordered the same thing, haha). The prime rib comes out a while later, which made us all think that ... man, they must have run out of prime rib, so they're cooking us some good fresh one! When it arrived, each one was pretty darn big. Mine was a little bigger than the size of my hand! Unfortunately, the prime rib tasted really weird. It didn't even taste like meat! I felt like I was chewing on some weird variation of prime rib (almost like a vegetarian prime rib). It tasted like an imitation, and not at all like how prime rib usually tastes. Needless to say, my family and I were all very disappointed. We had to force the prime rib down, and this was the first time we actually had food left on our plates that we did not take back in a to-go box. 

Good service, good salad and bread, but sucky prime rib! The crust was too salty and the meat was too rubber tasting. We were confused as the meat was pink - not overcooked, but just not tasting the way it should. The ambiance was nice with dim lighting and booth seating (tables as well), but that prime rib was a shame.",t3cu9DxXtGyaPIWNvPOXxA,1,0,2,eQCBr3bOZKibUiXhDObmPw

The Cafe was one of the last cheap eats on the strip and I'd walk past it all the time and forget it even existed. My family wanted to eat here because they had an affordable chinese menu and didn't want to pay high prices lunch at one of the bigger hotels. The style of the restaurant is Victorian (1837 - 1901)  thus being called Victorian Cafe with it's stained glass windows and wood paneling. The service was just average and the food was below average, we had the lunch specials that included dessert and was just bland in my opinion. 

I'd come back for cheap breakfast if the place was still open but not for the below average Chinese Food.

Went to Bill's Gamblin Hall to see Big Elvis.  Great show not to be missed.  Now we're hungry.  The Victorian Room is right there, so we figure why not?  Good decision!  No wait to be seated.  Beautiful room with dark wood and stained glass.  Red upholstered booths.  Pretty classy for a 24 hour café.  

Almost the second we sat down, our waiter appeared.  Smiling guy with a great attitude.  He must have checked on us 5 times during the meal.  We left him a nice tip.

I ordered the Prime Rib, rare.  Salad was served on a cold plate - nice touch.  My Prime Rib arrived rare and hot.  Baked potato on a separate plate - again a nice touch.  The Prime Rib was excellent in flavor and very tender.  A truly good meal for $14.95

Hubby ordered a hamburger - It had been 4 days since he'd had a burger.  This one did not disappoint.  He thoroughly enjoyed his burger, fries and a side of cole slaw.  His meal was around $10.00",0_ImqV5kJJC01CBX7uk8cQ,0,0,4,mdA8CBhcfeo9YRI4dCbRJg

What will attract you to this place is:

#1 The Amazing deals after midnight!
#2 Open late

So you're starving at 1 am and for whatever reason you don't care for Pinks, Mc D's, Denny's, etc...

well here the current special is $5 Steak+Eggs+Hashbrowns+Toast

and $15 Prime Rib.

If you're hungry, you should check this out! But if you're not drunk you'll unfortunately be able to realize that you really get what you pay for...

The $15 Prime Rib deal is actually not bad at all...you get a simple salad and fries/baked potato. Not a bad deal.

Now what you probably would buy though is the $5 special....the steak is think and bland...hashbrowns...bland x 2...eggs....worst eggs I've ever had...watery and over buttered, I never thought someone could mess up eggs. But the toast was fine.

And get this...a cup of coffee is like $3...more than half your special.

Despite any awards it might have won and the 30 minute wait....STAY AWAY if you plan on getting the $5 deal and get yourself an extra value meal at Mc D's. At least you know what to expect.
