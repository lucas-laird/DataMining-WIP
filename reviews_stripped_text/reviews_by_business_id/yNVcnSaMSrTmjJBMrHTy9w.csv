For whatever reason my friends get a kick out of eating here, so every once in a while we stop by.  During my last trip in the middle of last month, a bunch of us stopped in for dinner.  

The food here is just really average.  The decor is cool and the location is really popular.  If you go, make a reservation and be ready for crowds.  

I ordered the Veal Marsala and my veal wasn't the tender cuts of meat that you might expect.  Instead it was chewy.  Chewy veal?!?  Come on...  

I do like drinking the endless house red wine out of the Godfather glasses, but that shouldn't be the only reason to go here.",r1or_2ck3sylcZJJ9BX9ug,2,1,2,ymV6L8ziRAplNuZ2KA8OPA

I went there for dinner with my friend, his mom, and sister. We're seated almost immediately and greeted by what I think was the busboy?

One thing I thought was strange was that the waiter touched our table a total of maybe two or three times? The busboy or back up waiter consistently came over to check our table to see how we were doing. 

When we sat down white and red wine was dropped off.. Bottomless wine? Why not? But it's obviously not the best stuff. I barely touched it. The menus are posted on the wall, and at first glance I thought the prices were a bit high.. Then when the good came the portions were MASSIVE. The food was just okay, nothing outstanding. 

For the price you're getting a soup or salad an entree and a dessert drink and bottomless wine while you dine. I guess it's not so bad.",DAcgZNElA1cc_MP7GbfWlg,1,1,4,g7YSeAik7r_b9G1CGXsxPQ

59393,2017-01-14,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Service and the atmosphere are great but the food lid a little sub-par.  There is a roaming accordion player that is adorable and charming. The menu has a wide variety. My husband I chose classics: manicotti and cheese ravioli- $25.95 each. They tasted frozen and processed- not authentic. 

Each meal comes with a house salad, red and/or white House wine, garlic bread and a cappuccino.  The salad was so-so. It has a slice (like you would get at the deli counter) of salami in it with a hunk of processed mozzarella cheese and is slightly overdressed.   The wine was for sure cheap, but I wasn't expecting anything fancy considering it was included. The meal, depending on what you picked, doesn't take too long to get there but again, isn't anything to write home about.  It seemed like previously frozen, processed pasta- not homemade- with processed cheeses and canned sauce. I've had better at chains. The garlic bread wasn't fresh- seemed like it had been sitting a while and was hard. I tasted the cappuccino and it was ok but had a strong nutty flavor, almost like pecan. 

Again, the 2 stars are for the ambiance and the accordion player than came by our table to entertain.   It's Vegas- there are so many places with much better food for the same price.",k7Zjd36zIIZZPX-KdivZlw,2,0,2,aBvHeQfROBZyNXdsUwL4Jw

We went this past Monday at 5:30 - not exactly what I would call a busy time. We had bread, salad, and food within 30 minutes, so we were feeling very rushed. I wasn't even halfway through my entree when the server was already coming by asking if we wanted cappuccino. The food was sub-par, nothing to write home about (the salad was DRENCHED in dressing and inedible). They gave us two carafes of wine - one white, one red. There were 5 of us, and we were never offered any more. From seating to signing the bill was exactly 1 hour. We asked our server Gerson for another carafe as we still had quite some time to kill before our show. His response was, ""I can absolutely give you more wine; however I need this table so you will need to drink this in the lounge."" I have NEVER in my life been asked to get up from a table, ESPECIALLY after only one hour.

68222,2012-07-07,3,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"I'm 100% Italian-American. I grew up on Italian, home-cooked food, I've spent a month in Italy and literally ate my way through the country, and have an eleven-letter Italian last name that people constantly butcher when they try to pronounce it.  It is that experience that prompted me to sign up for Yelp and give Battista's its deserved one star. It was dismal. 

The main reason I am writing this is to dispel myths circling around (from LOCALS no less) that this place is fun and has good Italian food. Neither is true. Though our wait staff was attentive and prompt, the good service we got just didn't outweigh the bad food. 

The decor is kitschy - crap all over the place. The food pricing is way too expensive for iceberg salad, adequate garlic bread and mediocre wine. I ordered a chicken dish and had minestrone. They were both way too salty (a trick used by restaurants to hide poor quality or good-tasting food). And yes, the accordion player was awkward to say the least. 

Over-priced, overrated and a tourist trap with a miraculously good reputation. My advice? Go to Maggiano's for GREAT Italian food. Or Olive Garden. Or Buca di Beppo's even.  Just please, don't go here. Don't perpetuate the Battista's myth.",T5_FMBxak-fMCVM4SC_hTg,7,3,1,KOB2HDgbkkEqe8cDeqnvAg

82241,2009-07-28,3,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Synopsis: Want a respite from the Strip? Here's a cozy place that serves up generous portions of Italian food. Menu is all inclusive and the prices are just as hearty as the dishes you're eating.

Unabridged:""Hole in the Plaza"" would be a more appropriate title, but who cares when their front door is made from a huge wine barrel? There are several signs advising reservations but our party of two was seated within five minutes on a weekday night. 

Pick your entree from the many menus posted on the walls. Just because you went a block off the strip doesn't mean prices are cheaper, but they do include their well-known bottomless wine. One sip of the red (or white) wine will tell you that it is not choice but you can drink copious amounts of it. Get into the Vegas spirit and try to finish your carafe, you could even pour it over your head for a wine shower. It's bottomless so they'll bring you another. 

Garlic bread - our first basket was a bit stale but the second one was fresh, warm, and delicious. I went with the minestrone as my appy, my companion went for the salad. The salad was a bit of a let-down, iceberg lettuce and a bit of sliced veggies on top. The soup was hot and while it wasn't astounding, it was a nice starter. My eggplant parm was a huge slab of eggplant/cheesy goodness on a plate. Perhaps it's because I had skipped lunch that day but I was satisfied with my meal. My dining partner got about 2/3 through her lasagna, then threw in the towel. 

I don't care for coffee, but I passed my cappuccino to my companion who happily polished off two. She said they were very good.  

Taste-wise Battista's is like a hybrid of Olive Garden and Bucca. Decor-wise it's a bit like a time capsule: signed pics framed on the walls, memorabilia, and the friendly booths that are comfortably broken in from patrons over the years. Our server was cordial and down-to-earth which was refreshing after dealing with aspiring showgirl/gold-digger waitresses earlier in the day. There was an accordion player who we found slightly annoying but the regulars kept requesting him to play bits of songs sprinkled with corny jokes. (I know, I know, I'm heartless cause I didn't find this elderly man's vocation engaging, but I'm trying to chat with my fam while stuffing my face. Accordion's gotta go.)

For a memorable experience and laid back surroundings, this is it. For mind-blowing Italian cuisine, you may want to look elsewhere. Vegetarians - you're limited to several pasta choices and the eggplant parm. Vegans - pasta pomodoro: that's it.",TGmHGr2rIddZONGj77oujg,5,3,3,P2qoJKdIx0eNTW9osviQsg

Much has been written about the food, so I won't spill more ink on it (the spinach was the worst I ever had and the free wine reflects what you pay for it).

Just for the record, I have been working in the restaurant industry for several years from Michelin rated to casual. Therefore, I know good food, and bad food, when I see it.

Battista's Hole in the Wall is the absolute worst restaurant I have ever been to. Listed below are all the reasons why:

1. The Hostesses. All the hostesses were cold and unfriendly. Did not smile or welcome us. When asked to be seated they told us we had to have our whole party there (understandable for large parties) but we were a party of 4, 2 of us were there. When asked to see a menu, they handed us a paper menu with ZERO descriptions and when asked about the descriptions, they informed us that our server would inform us.

1. The Server. When seated the was extremely clueless. He asked us several times if we had any questions, yet when we asked him questions he did not know. We asked him to explain the menu, and he pointed to the menu on the wall and told us to look at it. When asked what beers there were he told us all kinds, then only mentioned 2. He was very un attentive and took forever to do anything. 

3. According player. As you ""enjoy complimentary"" soup/salad and bread, Gollum from The Lord of the Rings comes to your table and tells you (not asks) to play your party a song. Then, he awkwardly stands there until you reluctantly reach into your pocket/purse to give him a tip. 

4. The Food. The food was awful. The dishes are pre-made ($25+) meals which are extremely unappetizing. Literally, they tasted like TV dinners. We had Chicken Alfredo, Chicken Parmesan, and Beef Ravioli. Everyone hated they're dishes.

5. Cover Charge. Considering I hated my meal, I returned it to the server assuming he would take it off the check. He did not. Only after requesting it's removal, the check is returned with a ""cover charge."" He did not tell us what this was and when asked, he informed us that ""when someone doesn't order a dish a cover charge is done to cover the ""included"" soup/salad/bread. In my case since I sent my dish back, they decided to charge me $12 for their awful starters. 
 
From start to finish I had the absolute worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant and left hungry. Please do not waste your time/money on this place. I would give it no stars if I could. At this rate, Battista's will surely go out of business.",fhv_kRMaa2VZ4Mi9VgncUQ,14,1,1,sfuiz2QOiegpyk-Jfay8Zw

Get the minestrone soup. The salad is fine, but it's a generic salad--though it has salami and pepperoncini in it. Nice. 

Forgot to review it when I was there this week. Absolutely the best Italian place in terms of ambiance and food. The place is old Vegas, clean, and fun. Most of all, they leave you the hell alone without the fake waiter upsell/tip earning crap at a chain restaurant. They don't care what you think, they're just going to bring you the best food imaginable. I suggest everyone order something different--that way you can share. 

The wine is fantastic. People complaining about it being table wine are probably the types of folk that swish $80 cab blends, make up some loosey-goosey adjective about its smokey aromatic legs, and spit it in a bucket at country club events. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life. 

Make sure you have $1 or $2 in cash to tip the accordion player. Stop bitching and just do it. He's earned it. 

As spineless as it sounds, get the spaghetti and meatballs. It's cheap and wonderful. The steak pizzaiola is a good backup. Veal parmegiana [sic] is a good 3rd, if you are cool with eating children. I was. 

Cover that shit in red pepper flake--being Italian in the 21st century means not an ounce of spice in the prep, sadly. It'll kick it up a bit, unless you're the sad sack that thinks sea salt is exotic.",e7RwiaghLlnoV0Tvxk_PpQ,4,2,5,d-n8jI1r23ES4iA_pqgmZQ

3 of us rolled in with a reservation and even though it was busy they sat us close to our time. Loved the concept of the menu and the minestrone soup was excellent, they dropped one red and one white wine on the table, the girls liked the red and the white was to my liking except I had to drop ice in it as it was room temperature, but since it kept flowing I didn't care.
Service was spot on and not intrusive and there was a nice break between the appetizers and main course that allowed the garlic bread (which felt like it was made right in the back) and soup/salad to works its way in a downward direction so that you didn't feel like you had to rush to eat because they wanted your table and your money. 
Chicken parm was goooooood, not typically oversized like you find in so many restaurants these days, normal people eat normal meals for one person not 5. Not everything in life needs to be supersized and I think they've found that balance.

We got there a few minutes early and were seated right on time for our reservation.  The first thing they did was put a big bottle of wine on our table and say that we could have all we could drink of it (yay!).  The menu is pretty simple, different kinds of delicious italian food separated by price range (about $21-30 a plate, including soup/salad, wine, garlic bread, and meal).

The garlic bread was delicious and the wine was decent (but free, and for some reason I liked it more and more as the night progressed...).  The salad was a pretty average italian salad, but the lasagna was wonderful (although by that point I had quite a bit of wine in me, but I think it would have been great anyway).

So I would definitely recommend this place, I found myself disappointed when I was full because there was plenty of food left on my plate and I wished there was room for more of it in my stomach.  It was a night ender though because my friend and I were both completely trashed from all the free wine by the end of the meal.",Tq0MMj_Y0E7pv_jEElem4g,2,1,5,tvDFgK0_z3FNHK1Y8ElS2g

The salad was good.  My boyfriend hates salad so he had the minestrone.  I didn't try it but he said it was good.  Both our entrees (lasagna, chicken parmesan) were fine, but nothing to write home (or a yelp review?) about.  The bread was pretty good.  ""Cappucino"" or as other reviewers have correctly identified it - Swiss Miss was not hot... not even warm actually.  I guess they fill the mugs in large batches?  How hard is it to pour a cup when it's time to serve it?  

We went through a carafe of the white and a glass or two of red before hitting the dusty trail back to Bill's Gamblin Hall.

Anyway, I like this place... but come on - $22 for lasagna and $26 for chicken parm?  Who are they kidding?  I'd rather pay a more reasonable fee (knock off $10) and then pay a separate price for all you can drink wine.  Because if you don't intend to drink the wine **Read** you are wasting your money.

The atmosphere is just so old school. The menu's are on the wall, and simple. They start you off with white and red wine included in your meal and garlic bread. Then comes the house salad which is super yumm. I had the chicken alfredo and i must say it's the BEST i have ever had. They finish you off with a cappucino. They even treated the happy couple with a wedding cake after. We were basically finished after this meal because it was a lot, but cannot wait to go back, will never go to Vegas without a stop at Batista's. Oh and got a tid bit from a cabbi, the reason it's named HOLE IN THE WALL  is because back in the day during prohibition they used to have a fake brick wall in the back and when the police would come by they would go through a trap door with thier alcohol. Just had to add it, thought it was a cool story. And Thanks Vito for being the best waiter!!!!",EstCufH7b8NtEIOPn6asQw,0,0,5,9UbM45-OaTHVUXsbUi8wWg

439942,2016-03-25,1,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Everyone seems to love Batista's, and there must be a reason. But I sure didn't see many reasons to like it last night. It was my first visit---I went with out-of-town relatives who absolutely love the place. 

The pluses first: The atmosphere is great, it's vintage Vegas and there are photos galore of everyone who is or was anyone. I love the carafes of house red and white wine they give you, and constantly refill. It's house wine, yes, but I really liked the white chablis. They also give you big baskets of garlic bread, and the Italian salad was quite good.

Now the minuses: My biggest problem with Batista's last night was the wait staff's attitude and the feeling I got of being rushed. Everything they did and said---and how they said it---screamed ""We want to move you out of here as fast as we can."" No smiles from the waiters, nothing friendly about them, just all business get-you-out-of-here attitudes. Our waiter brought an armload of salads to the table (yes, stacked on his arm), and said ""Anyone here who doesn't want a salad?"" We all did, and he dealt them out around the table, just like a 21 dealer. He took our orders and soon our food arrived.

I had steak pizzaiola. My plate was 3/4 steak covered in sauce, and 1/4 creamed spinach. It was mass of liquid. Frankly, it looked unappetizing, but the steak was very good. I didn't eat the spinach, though, I couldn't get past how it looked. They never brought my side order of pasta (the menu says you get soup or salad, garlic bread, a side of pasta, and cappuccino). I didn't realize they'd forgotten it until I was done eating because I felt so rushed. They dropped capuccinos on the table and the rush feeling really started. That's when I realized there's no dessert menu! I guess they don't want guests lingering over dessert. Since the family in our group hadn't seen each other in a couple of years, we were all talking over our coffee, but they kept trying to get us out of there! So we finally obliged them.

My dinner was $29.95, and I've certainly had far better for that price or less. Although the food was good, the presentation (at least of my dish) was just awful, and forgetting the pasta side just shouldn't have happened. And the truth is they weren't really all that busy. There was no line out the door, and I'm not sure anyone had to wait for a table if they didn't have a reservation. Normally I would have had a better steak, like a ribeye or a NY strip, but those were $39.95 on their menu, and I don't pay that much for a steak that's just a steak (it's not like the menu said it's kobe or even angus). I can't speak at all for the past dishes since I didn't have any, but those who had pasta in my party liked it. 

Overall, I was pretty disappointed. To me, it seems like so many people come to Batista's (perhaps just so they can say they've been there) that Batista's no longer cares about the customer as much as they used to. Or, for all I've written, it might have just been a bad night. Whatever the case, it was a disappointing enough experience that I won't be going back, and I won't be taking guests there. Hope you all have better luck than I did.",2Y0zQA_86H0UtXK-oaWCdg,0,0,2,OsuX0v3j1ilwJT9QkmiqYg

This place has a really fun atmosphere AND all you can drink wine. That's a definite bonus for anyplace on the strip. For about $20 you get wine, soup or salad, garlic bread, main dish and a cappuccino. You can split the entree for an extra $10 and you both get the extras, including the wine. 

The food is certainly not the best but it's not at all bad considering the portion size and ambiance. Seriously, I've paid close to $20 for a crappy sandwich and fries on the strip and it didn't even come with a soda let alone all you can drink wine...even if it is two buck chuck. I don't care what the rest of you Yelpers with your one and two stars think!

We didn't ASK you to join or conversation nor did we desire you to corner us at our table and shove your accordion in our faces.

You get your choice of standard Italian entrees (My favorites are the Lasagna and the Veal Parmigiana) and meals include, salad, great garlic bread, your entree, hot chocolate (they call it a cappuccino, but it's hot chocolate) AND, oh my god, are you sitting down for this? ALL THE CHEAP WINE YOU CAN DRINK!!! They'll ask you if you like white or red. If you're smart, one person at the table will say ""red"" and someone else will say ""white"", that way they'll bring two carafes right off the bat... then they just keep bringing them!

Now for the prices? And I ain't cheap by any means, this place is a joke...but we order anyway thinking small menu, high prices he has to use top of the line products...yeah not so much...I order eggplant Parm with a side of Meatballs...my buddy ordered chicken rio, ok so now the garlic bread comes along with my complimentary salad and his soup, he said the soup was average and my salad was good, crispy romaine sliced Mozzarella not fresh but restaurant depot or Sysco crap...ok no big deal...now 7 min after ordering our food comes out...yes i time the order to the time I'm served....RED Flag...right away...no way that's cooked to order...it came out my gravy tasted like pure sugar and dark...which means he uses a shit tomato and that gravy has been cooking all day down to a thick transmission fluid like state...and full of oil..the Meatballs were hard as rocks, means he only uses a shit beef in them and then bakes them off which is ok if u use the right mix...they where dead to me not soft and firm like a good Meatball should be and tasteless no garlic or fresh Grated Parm Regg in them just BLAH...my eggplant itself was ok...but the gravy ruined the taste for me...my buddies chicken rio was dry and bland and fell apart which means it was made earlier in the day and sat in a cold drawer and just put in a pan with that cream sauce over rottini macaroni.....awful to serve that shit....take pride in your food...
Now we decided to order a slice of taramisu ok store bought shit or made last Monday it was sour and smelt like what ever fridge it was in....and the complimentary ""cappuccino "" was that Swiss miss hot chocolate and cappuccino mix...with a shit load of whip cream on it..actually best part of the meal....this joint sucks...this ain't italian food....save yourself the trip....will I be back....only against my will....sorry guys if u read this...take some pride in your food and taste it before it leaves the kitchen.",y8VRHAox7QOgoZ-msufLBQ,3,1,2,HZdgov2_JC8rSE4C3LI1vA

Honestly- this place is way over priced and the food not so good. Only good thing going was the decor and the ambiance.

Here's the breakdown:
1. Food way over priced. Yes, you get salad or soup, garlic bread and free red & white wine. But when you're paying min. $21, the main entree better taste good. And it didn't. Granted the portions are HUGE but still not worth if if the food is bad.
2. I ordered the linguini seafood- the seafood part was good but the sauce was bland and tasted too much like tomato paste. The pasta itself was way too al dente. 
3. My sister ordered the cheese ravioli- the sauce was also way too bland and there was too much sauce on the dish. 
4. For dessert, we sampled the cheesecake- tasted like a frozen cheesecake from a local grocery store. 
5. The ""cappucino"" is really not cappucino. It's more like hot chocolate. Also, as an Italian restaurant, the owners should know better- in Italy, cappucino is a breakfast drink. In the evenings, one drinks espresso with or without liquor in it. 
6. Nothing special about the salad or the wines. I can definintely say I have had better wines.
7. The guy with the accordion was a little creepy.

1224711,2014-05-03,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"If you want to find a little piece of heaven just go to Battistas Hole in the wall.  When you first arrive you will most likely notice the decorations. It reminded us of almost an Old Italian mob scene. It was all so interesting to look at and entertaining! I have never been to a restaurant that I found it entertaining just to look at the walls and ceiling. Old black and white pictures covered the walls and they hung pots, pans, and baskets to the ceiling, which I felt gave it a very Italian feeling. 

Now the food; AMAZING. Seriously, I don't think I can ever, I mean ever, eat at another Italian restaurant again. First we were offered breadsticks, salad, and soup. The garlic breadstick, to die for! I have never tasted bread that has tasted so delicious; I practically filled up on those before I could even order. For the main course I ordered cheese raviolis. Those where also the best I have ever had. The cheese literally melted in your mouth like butter. I couldn't stop my self from eating! My boyfriend got the eggplant Parmesan. Now that is some good food. I highly recommend that. It is now my favorite dish out of all the restaurants we go too. Its that kind of amazingly perfect good taste that can't be described.

After we ate we thought we would go out for desert. That didn't happen though! They brought out delicious cappuccinos. (They are apart of the dinner course so you are not charged for them) They were better then any hot chocolate/coffee/cappuccino I have ever had from anywhere else. It was the perfect amount of sweet and even though I was stuffed I drank the whole cup! (Which is a decent size)

Now I am really ready to go, but wait! It was my birthday and my boyfriend had surprised them and told them when he called for the reservations. They brought out a small piece of cake. AMAZING, AGAIN! It blows my mind that every course of this meal was spot on. It seemed like it was a moist sponge cake with delicious cream on top. I could have eaten like 10 of those.

The environment was also wonderful. I forget that on the strip people just want to have a good time. So even though we felt like the guests sat to close it was actually worth it. We joked with them and had such a good time. Our waitress was so sweet. I really felt like she took excellent care of us.


Now there are two reasons way I did not give this a 5 star. The location is the first. I would have never even known it was there. It is literally a hole in the wall. The area isn't the nicest but I am always paranoid about that.

The second reason was the ""lives music"". This man would walk table to table and plan a small 2-second snip of a song (of his choosing) and then ask YOU for a tip. I thought it was rude because we didn't ask him to come over so being forced to tip after was a little uncomfortable. I couldn't hear him sing over his accordion so I didn't get to enjoy it anyway. We only had a five so when my boyfriend asked for change back he acted like he didn't hear him and walked away. When he made his second round he made sure not to stop at our table (even though 5 dollars was probably his best tip of the night)

Over all I say GO! We defiantly will be!",27NQcRpJ0VKNyVImtsWoFg,1,0,4,12-ZCyQ31D9FxWp2OBsbHQ

  * Ambiance: This is old-school Vegas. There aren't many places like this anymore, with big red booths, dark secluded rooms, and celebrity photos on the walls. 
  * Service: From the hostess to our waitress and busser, everyone was friendly and professional. Too bad we missed the accordion player on the night we visited.
  * Price: Meals range from $23 to $41 per person. A steal, when you consider they offer tons of food and all-you-can-drink wine!

And, most of all ...

 * Food: Great cheesy garlic bread. Great salad (more like an antipasto than a traditional house salad). A tasty cappuccino after dinner. And Italian classics like chicken parm ($31) and veal marsala ($34), plus faves like spaghetti and meatballs, linguine and clams, lasagna, and ravioli. Although the underseasoned entrees are the weak links in the lineup, they are still pretty tasty. And did I mention ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK WINE?! And they aren't stingy with it, either. Ask for red, white, or both, and they will bring you a carafe or two--or more. (Just don't be a lush and spoil it for the rest of us!)

I really liked the decor and we had calamari as an appetizer, which came out really quickly and was super. 

The meal was delicious and the house wine was good, even though I shouldn't drink wine due to a sensitive stomach; my half glass was good! We all got the feeling that the server didn't really like us, for whatever reason, be it our behavior (we were actually pretty well behaved at this point in the trip) or his night not going so well. 

Keep in mind the portions are very large and the minimum charge per person isn't so bad, even if you share a dish between two and have to tag on the extra $, because you will leave full and satisfied.

RESERVATIONS - yes you need them but why bother ?? We had reservations for 4 at 8:30 pm and didn't get seated until 9:10 pm. 
HOSTESSES - hope you like to be treated like a first grader. Told the girl our whole party was present and she proceeded to say let me know when your whole party arrives !! What ?? 
FOOD - I'm either a food snob, enjoy my own cooking or know why I don't frequent Olive Garden either. This food is below sub par. Truthfully. We sent 2 of the 4 dinners back. Linguine with canned clam sauce ?? We were told they ran out of whole clams ! And you decided that canned clams were acceptable rather than having us make a different food choice ?? Ok ... What about the steak pizzaole ?? Is the steak suppose to be tough (NO !) and is the marinara sauce suppose to be tasteless ?? NO !!! Send it back !!
CAPPUCCINO - really ?? Powdered cappuccino with whipped cream ?? Who puts whipped cream in cappuccino ??? Probably those first graders I referred to earlier.

This place rocks, (Thank you Phil Browning!)

PROS: 

OVERALL FEEL.. This place is THE authentic Italian joint! Everything from the Over sized (bullet proof?) door, to the personally signed photo of Elvis Presley (The King) and all other photos, this place overwhelmingly reminded me of an Italian restaurant out of the movie CASINO.  (WITH ALL DUE RESPECT  :)   ) I think this place is where Bucca di Beppo got its inspiration with with real food that doesn't come from a bag...

THE BREAD: FUGHETABBOUT IT.....  Just remember, ask for the oil & vinegar. Delish!

THE WINE: ALL YOU CAN DRINK HOUSE WINE. Enough said.

THE FOOD: I had the spaghetti w/ Sausage Cacciatore.  Really, really good!

THE SERVICE: Our waiter patiently explained all the ins and outs of each dish giving a well scripted definition of the dish which set the expectation of the guest. 

CONS: Be prepared to pay around $30 per person, but hell it's Vegas and every trip should have at least one solid meal.

OVERALL:

Great conversation, Great food, Great environment.

And as always friends and neighbors, when it comes to Food, Drink or Overall Value........Always trust a FAT MAN! :).

It's often said of restaurants by restauranteurs is that simple is best, and we've found it here. And right in the middle of the strip no less! What a find!

Old Las Vegas adorns the walls, wine casks abound, a dark, busy and welcoming interior, matched by a staff that's used to managing and shepherding packed packed crowds day in and day out.

You can eat in the bar area, wait for a table with drinks, or stand around and read the short menu until your reservation comes around. Either way, there's lots to see and take in.

The menu is simple, and contains simple Italian food. And yes, everything comes with bread, wine, and soup or salad. What a treat!

For $30, Sarah and I stuffed ourselves by splitting the Lasagna, the salad, basket of bread, and three carafes of wine. Including tip! What a steal, as I said, in the middle of the strip! All the menu says is that there's a $10 minimum per person, so why not split all that yummy simple Italian food!

This was one of our favorite meals from our last trip. The energy, the location. It was a truly old school Vegas experience.

1555753,2017-04-24,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,I used to really like this place. It was a must everytime I was in Vegas since the 90's. I brought someone new and I was pretty disappointed this time. I made reservations on a Saturday night for 8:30 for a party of two. We ordered two drinks a sea breeze with Shcmirnoff vodka and a gin and tonic. It was $26 for the two I was pretty surprised how expensive they were. Then we had dinner I ordered sausage Cacciatore with ziti pasta. I was surprised how small the portion was for $26 and they charge a minimum of $13 for a split fee but there is not enough food to split it. Two regular  size bowls of pasta at $26 each is outrageous?? It also comes with a salad which is also a joke it has one slice of salami which is thin enough to almost see through a few olives and one block of mozzarella about an inch and a half long. Everything is in chunks so you have to cut everything up. The plates are small so you don't have much room... The sausage Cacciatore wasn't much better. They just throw in one uncut long sausage link. My ziti was overcooked and mushy and my friend thought so as well. He wanted the spaghetti and meatballs but we were told that it has cheese in it. He can't eat cheese. Who puts cheese in their meatballs? All they suggested is it you can get spaghetti with meat sauce. How boring I felt bad. He ordered his with spaghetti and it was spot-on not overcooked it all. I was completely disappointed in my ziti pasta. I told them I wanted the the spaghetti instead since the ziti was overcooked and mushy. I could tell our waitress was not happy. No apology just brought me the tiniest little plate of spaghetti plain and then hardly saw her much after that. A different person served us cappuccinos for dessert. What they call Cappuccino is a complete joke for being an Italian restaurant. It doesn't taste anything like cappuccino it tasted more like instant hot chocolate that had way too much sugar in it. I don't know if I will ever come back again which is sad because I'm always really like this place. I was hoping to show my friend the accordion player but I was told that he was already gone for the night which was a bummer because he's been there forever... sad to say that was the worst experience I've had at Bautista's and I've probably eaten there at least a half-dozen times....,MKyxjAll-Z9lDsQHzI23Mg,0,0,2,ep71KVL7ilAamb0nSOJx5w

After a couple days of punishing my liver, we saw this place and as soon as I saw the sign, I craved spaghetti for the next 2 days.

Food- Like my tip said, unlimited red AND white wine at your dinner. Challenge accepted [insert meme]. The food was really good, not great but definitely good. The meal also came with a salad or soup which was good size. I didn't eat all my meal I think because I tried so hard to drink the wine. 

Service- Not bad, but not good either. About run of the mill. We called earlier in the day for a reservation and we still had to wait 10 minutes? This place on a Tuesday night wasn't even busy?

Those reviews could not be farther from the truth.  Another dead giveaway that this place most likely didn't have great food is the ""Free Wine.""  I was in town for a bachelor party and this is one of the places they picked to check out.

I live in the suburbs of Philly and we are used to great Italian food due to the large Italian population in the tri state area along with fantastic Italian restaurants.  The only thing I can think is that most people don't get a chance to have Italian food often. 

First the portions were not huge or even big.  They were average at best.  The highlight of the entire meal was the salad.  I had the Chicken Parm and it wasn't terrible but I would not send anyone there to try it.  The chicken was bland and the sauce wasn't much better.

In regard to the value...  $30 for a small salad, chicken parm, watered down wine and what they called cappuccino is far from a value.  If it was $12.99 i might agree.

Free wine!  I'm not sure you could even call it wine.  It was more like water with a taste of wine.  

Cappuccino... it was closer to powered hot chocolate

The service was good so they earned two stars.

Note that actual ""hole in the wall"" restaurants don't name themselves as such.  Similar to how girls named ""HotChick6969"" in AOL chat rooms were rarely actually hot, or even chicks, for that matter.

Anything a block from the strip is not geared towards locals.  If you really want a locals experience, you have to get far enough from the strip to where you can't walk back without your legs hurting.

The food is mediocre.  Not horrible, but if you're expecting a solid, surprisingly good meal from a hidden Italian locals joint, you're going to be disappointed.

I remember when I came in and found out about the free wine.  My heart sank when I heard that.  I knew the wine would be terrible if it was free.  Indeed, it wasn't good.  I didn't even order a second glass.  I felt weird NOT drinking it, because it was included in the price.

Look, if you just want to visit for the accordions and the funky photos on the wall, have at it.

Location/Parking: Battista's is a quick, easy walk from the Strip in a little strip mall across from Bally's. Look for the big sign. You can't miss it. But don't even think about driving there, because by the end of dinner you won't be able to drive home. 

Atmosphere:  Always crowded. Always a wait. Plan ahead. Seriously. Don't just show up when you're hungry on a Friday evening and think you're gonna waltz right in. Not even on a random Tuesday night. It's always packed with at least an hour wait. Call ahead. 

That said, it's totally worth the wait. Very friendly, cozy, warm atmosphere with a wandering accordion player. Nice touch, that. Not too loud, not too stuffy, no screaming brats. Nothing fancy and it probably hasn't been renovated since well, ever, but it's a nice place for dinner with friends or a long, relaxing date. Just maybe not a first date.

Cleanliness/Service: Decent enough service. No issues regarding cleanliness. I've been here half a dozen times and have never had a bad experience.

Food/Drinks: It's not authentic homemade Italian like your Grandma used to make, but it's not high school cafeteria crap either. Huge portions so don't fill up on the bread. Well, unless you're already on your second carafe of wine. Think Olive Garden or Carrabba's quality with unlimited wine. 

So far I've tried the Lasagna, Chicken Parmegiana, and Chicken Rio. They're all good but the Chicken Rio is my favorite. A friend of mine had the salmon (fresh fish of the day) and said it was very good. I keep meaning to try something different, you know, to give a more thorough review, but the Chicken Rio is just so good. Maybe next time. 

And the after dinner Cappuccino. Best. Cappuccino. Ever. Yum. I mean seriously. I would go there just for that. It's delicious. Very hot chocolate-y. Not sure if it's a legit cappuccino or not, but honestly, who cares?! 

Price: About $28 per person, but that includes your entrée, unlimited hot garlic bread, salad or soup, and wine. Yes, wine. House red, house white, or both if you ask nicely. The unlimited wine makes the price much better. It's definitely a good value for the money. You'll never leave hungry. Or sober. 

I love this place and try to visit two or three times a year. It never gets old. Don't forget to tip the accordion player to play you a tune. He's old. He might not be there next time.",PP7mV3SKVhtkuhwUDHUJXQ,3,1,4,Rdz0Ku8aobkcH2YDD7dFAg

Then the waiter came over to take our order within 5 minutes, not too shabby! 
Then the BEST part was the little old iconic man (36 years) came by too sing a song of someone's home town, but he was quickly told to move out of the way by another waiter bringing our food to us!

Once we shoveled down our supposed great food prepared in 10 minutes or less with the most bland ""homemade sauce"", the plates were quickly scooped up and our overly sweet cappuccinos were brought (no chance to order anything different) which we tried to enjoy, but the waiter then came and politely told us ""they needed the table and we had to leave!"" 
The sad thing was we already paid the bill with a generous tip! If I had known that we would be told to leave because they needed the table and 3 other tables were also empty, I would have left them a tip equal to the quality of the service and food...$1.00!
I have been in many places on very busy nights and NEVER told we had to leave to make room! 
Maybe they should convert the place to ""take-out"" only, where one could go through the line, look at pictures of how they USED to treat customers, place your order, look at more pics while being serenaded by the gentle little old man in a cage high off the floor (so he's not in the way), pay and pick up our fast food and leave!

Things continue to slip here & that makes me very sad. We've been here on a handful of occasions and really enjoyed it but the last few times haven't been up to par. 

Let's begin with the good stuff. Wine, wine & even more wine! This is how the conversation goes with the waiter ~

Waiter: White or red?
Me: Both please
Waiter: (laughs) So you've been here before...

You get wine with your meal & I'm happy to say that I've never once left here not tipsy :) 

Does the food taste better when you're tipsy? Sure it does...

We always order the same two meals; cheese ravioli with a marinara sauce and Chicken Rio (chicken breast smothered in a creamy white sauce over noodles and veggies on the side). Both are usually good but on this last trip both were barely warm and our chicken dish had hardly any sauce on it. Each meal comes with a soup or salad and we get one of each. My man gets the minestrone which was sent back this time because it was lukewarm & poorly seasoned and I get the salad which is really consistently great. This time I noticed they added croutons which is unnecessary and they were so hard that one of them left a little cut in my mouth :( 
Please get rid of these hard croutons....

The garlic bread is fantastic here and always comes out straight out of the oven and you also get sweet cappuccinos with whipped cream for dessert. I love the sweet ending! Let me also mention the old school ambiance that looks like a hoarders dream. I dig it and it's fun and on the dark side which is always extra romantic. 

Service has always been great and not sure what's going on in the kitchen but we hope they get it together. We might give it another chance but no more after the next try if things don't improve.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,42,40,3,kNjBjmtx0r5-MsDFZAsv6g

A week before the trip, my dentist told me I absolutely had to go to Battista's.  Sure thing.  Then-boyfriend and I checked it out.  We thought it was great.

Fast forward four years... my brother is now living in Vegas, and my immediate family decided to meet there for Christmas.  Having remembered my wonderful experience at this restaurant, I decided we should all go.  BIG mistake.  The wine tasted like 2-buck Chuck that had been opened five days before.  The salad was comprised of iceberg lettuce and topped off with a hunk of salami.  I'm pretty sure the sauce was Ragu.  My brother, an erstwhile captain in the Army, said he'd rather have an MRE (meal ready to eat) than dine at Battista's again.

1746955,2014-07-16,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"I recently had my destination wedding in Las Vegas at the end of May and had about 40 guests fly in from Chicago with my husband and me. Of course we wanted to do something nice as a thank you for everyone, so we decided food would be the best thank you. We also didn't want to go into debt by having dinner at some place on the Strip with 40 people because let's be honest, we could spend a small fortune on drinks alone. Enter Battista's!

On a previous trip to Vegas, I convinced my now husband and another friend to try out Battista's Hole in the Wall. I had heard about this place for years, but never made it there and finally wanted to try it. Yes, it looks a bit sketchy from the outside (I think one of our guests who could see the building from their room in Bally's said, ""it looks like a place where the prostitutes hang out""), but it is truly a fine, upstanding business. Live a little people!

Anyway, since we had been to Battista's and really enjoyed the food previously AND you get all the wine INCLUDED with the meal, we decided to have our wedding dinner here. And I will always be happy we did.

There was already a large(er?) group that had reservations at 7pm on that Saturday, but since we were only going to have 40 people they were able to get us in at the same time. We were not all at one table, but in a room with other diners where we basically were sitting in an L-shaped table configuration. I thought it was fun to have other diners in there as well, and I hope they enjoyed some of our speeches/toasts. 

Now, the important part - the food. We had one couple that is pretty much on the pulse of everything chic and cool tell us they were so happy that the dinner is at Battista's since it had been recommended several time to them. And for good reason - I thought the food was excellent. I had Eggplant Parm and wish we I could have taken the large portion I had leftover with me. Everyone I spoke to gushed about their food and especially the cappuccino. I don't drink coffee, so I opted out, but those who do said it was the best they ever had. 

In addition to the dinners and all the extras that come with them, we asked the servers to bring out dessert plates with assortments of what they had. Sadly, there was no cannoli, but they had tiramisu and spumoni. As mentioned, I'm not a coffee girl so I didn't try to tiramisu, but the spumoni was excellent! And they knew how much to bring out so there was nothing left! 
For those of you looking to have a large dinner at Battista's, I believe our total bill was about $1400 all in. That's not bad for 40 people who were somewhat sober when they came and left full and tipsy! We let everyone order whatever they wanted off the menu, so it wasn't like there was a condensed menu to keep the prices down. I highly recommend Battista's Hole in the wall for large and small groups!

PS - the accordion player visited us several times and was such a cute man! It's too bad our group didn't know more of the words to That's Amore!",K4GdUZg_8QJ0byqTHuGEzw,3,0,5,uR_U4GuLXLxvr_42HV17XQ

For those who complain about the prices at Battista's, I think it is important to point out that you get a bottomless glass of red or white wine included in the price.

Parking is easy to find right outside of the building and there are plenty of spots available. It's kind of dirty, but its not a big issue unless if you are planning to eat in the lot.

Ambiance (1/5):
Light is very dark. When I walked into the restaurant, I felt like a navy seal trying to break into Binladen's compound using night vision goggles. They seriously need to lighten up this joint. Noise level is average for your average Italian restaurant.

Service (2/5):
I had reserved a table for 4 and we were sited immediately when our full party arrived. I would recommend reserving a table ahead of time, especially on weekend. The server was very good, he got us the wine and garlic bread right after we ordered and he wasn't annoying like other places where waiters keep bothering you to see how you are doing. Also, avoid the musician whom goes from table to table literally playing nothing but a small tune and you feel obligated to give him money. 

Food (4/5):
Food is pretty good.  Meals range from $23-45 and they courses contain salad/soup, garlic bread, house wine (red/white), entrée, and a cappuccino. I ordered salad, which was good; it wasn't drenched in dressing like many other places. House wine is all you can drink, but you get what you pay for.  Garlic bread was pretty good. It wasn't overly laced with garlic butter, so it complemented well with the main entree. My main entrée was sausage with penne and meat sauce. Meat sauce was delicious, not to sour, and just the right amount of sweetness. The spicy sausage was amazing in flavor and it was cooked to perfection. The best part of the meal was cappuccino, which comes with all meals and it was one of the best post meal hot-dessert I've ever had. 

Overall (3/5), it's a decent off the strip joint. The prices are very reasonable for good meals, but the ambiance and service does need some work.",kwIhn1_cnQeUaLN0CuWWHw,2,0,3,F2zYApdDRvBDKeh4Dbd3wg

I ordered the lasagne which was just mediocre. Portion was huge I probably only ate a quarter of it. My hubby got chicken Alfredo which was DELICIOUS!!!!! Definitely recommend that. My mom got linguine with clams and garlic. And her husband got the NY steak. The noodles were okay but my mom really didn't enjoy the fact they didn't have any freshly grated Parmesan cheese or freshly grated cracked pepper. And the steak was supposed to be well done but came out medium and almost raw.

Also they never took our drink order I had to personally ask for iced tea and waters even though the table next to us was asked immediately after being seated what they want to drink.

Garlic bread is very good!!! My daughter ate about 7 pieces instead of touching any pasta. The salad had waaaay too much vinegar my tongue felt very tangy after each bite. The minestrone was great though!!! 

For desserts we ordered a spumoni and tiramisu for the birthday boys! The spumoni was delicious. The tiramisu however, not so much. It was made with layered yellow cake instead of sponge fingers and I hated it!!!! Didn't taste anything at all like tiramisu and I know my tiramisu. Not even a strong coffee taste at all.

The plates we received were not exactly what we ordered.  OK, perhaps the wait staff is overworked and missed a detail (twice) - easy to do if you don't write down the order.  The garlic bread was embarrassing - too much garlic and so drenched with something (oil or butter?) that it could't possibly toast well.  Garlic bread should have a slight hint of a taste of garlic, not be a weapon of mass Dracula destruction.  The green salad was drowned in dressing.  The pasta came sticky, an indication that it wasn't freshly prepared but had been sitting around a while.  The red sauce tasted no better than cheap jar sauce you can buy at any grocery stores.  The sausage had no taste.  The veal piccante (piccata) had no taste.  The red house wine is truly pathetic.  

In Italy, this restaurant would be run out of town!  In fact, I'll go as far as saying that Italian stray dogs would turn their noses and run -  the absolute worst food experience EVER!  Just in case I wasn't clear enough, we were extremely disappointed and much poorer for the experience.

We were able to walk there from the Flamingo. One block up past the pool.  At first glance you would probably just drive by as it doesn't look appealing. Inside the place is very old school lots of celeb pics on the wall.  
When we were seated at our table 2 carafes of wine were included (1 red, 1 white) all you can drink house. The menu seems a little pricey $28 for chick parm but with wine,salad,garlic bread and a cappuccino following your meal its not that bad.

The salad was dressed with a House Italian dressing which was tasty and also came with a few pieces of salami and a nice hunk of cheese.
Garlic Bread was very good.  Plenty of garlic and butter and seemed to be very fresh.
The Chicken parm was tender and juicy and thick.

Now the sauce - It was a little sweet and bland which is why only 4 stars.  We had them bring a little garlic powder to the table to give it a little more flavor.

The cappuccino was a nice touch for after the meal. Topped high with whipped cream.

If you want free wine, fun decor, an accordion player that plays at your table and food like your Italian grandmother used to make, then come here.

I got the Chicken Cacciatore and it was better than some other fancy places I've been to. I can't say I love the Marinara, which came with my boyfriends Veal Parmesan (it's on the sweet side), but it wasn't bad.

You start off with a basket of hot buttery garlic bread, followed up with a big bowl of Italian salad with their excellent house Italian dressing (or Minestrone soup if you want it) and then you get your meal. 

I did think the plates were a little small... I would have loved more pasta to use with that delicious Cacciatore sauce.

Your meal is followed up with a hot chocolate-esque flavored Cappucino. By this point you would have realized you're not getting Starbucks here.

Gordy the accordion player comes to every table and asks you where you're from. Then he'll hit a few keys and attempt a song related to your state. Ask him to play more and he will, just don't forget to tip!

Coming from Chicago with numerous decent Italian restaurants and restaurant chains I can be picky with my Italian meals and this place really gave the biggest bang for my buck hands down...when it comes to Italian food.

This isn't exactly the place to go after downing cheap drinks next door at the Stage Door Casino, but it is what it is...and well I dined here after, my friends half in the bag.  I wish they could have enjoyed this meal as much as I did along with the wine that came with it.

We arrived there a bit later than dinner time, there was about a 15 minute wait so we grabbed a glass of wine at the bar.  The place was still pretty hopping.  The  memorabilia is worth checking out while waiting as well.

The menu is straight forward and on the wall...all meals come with house wine - red & white, delicious garlic bread, soup or salad.  Two of us got salads, one got soup - we raved about both.  I ordered ziti with meatballs for my meal - I honestly have no idea what the others had.  I enjoyed the white wine with my meal and just tasted the red, that was good as well.  I read complaints about the wine... they don't advertise it being high end wine, thus why it's HOUSE wine...and if that meal was al a carte anywhere else, you'd be paying more.

The ambiance and decor are just totally awesome. The walls are packed with all kinds of pictures and autographs and other things to look at. It's got exactly the kind of character that I love. There's even an elderly man with a accordion thing that walks around and serenades the tables. (Tips are encouraged.) I just absolutely loved it.

The menu is posted up on the wall and is pretty straightforward. You get unlimited red or white wine. You get a house salad or minestrone soup. You get garlic bread. You choose your entree (there are about 5 different price levels ranging from $22 to $40), everything from spaghetti and meatballs to ribeye. If your entree doesn't already involve pasta, you get a side of penne with marinara sauce. You get a cappuccino. For the amount of food and drink involved and the quality, it's a pretty good deal for your money.

The wine was pretty good for being house wine. (We went with the red.) The salad was tasty - I liked the dressing. The minestrone soup was some of the best we've had. Our entrees were large and filling and yum. I opted for the steak caruso. It was a perfectly cooked steak on top of pasta with mushrooms and other veggies and just a little bit of a kick. The cappuccino was good. And we even got a free dessert, complete with a candle, since we mentioned it was our anniversary when we made our reservation. And that was tasty too.

As for me and the 35 guest that either drove in or flew in from as far away as Australia, we all loved it. The restaurant had suggested a great bakery to make a wedding cake and they also were great. All my guests and my daughter as well as my new son in law had a great time and they couldn't stop talking about all the fun. 

To all the staff at Battista's we just want to thank you so much!

this is the place i have my annual viva dinner. we meet some friends here and do the town right, well, or wrong if you look at it as the drunks takin' over. this year was no different, except for the fact that we were seated in the same room as two wedding parties. no problem....we were all loud and we were all drunk. i like the food here and for a flat price you get soup or salad, main course, hot chocolate or cappuccino, and FREE vino! so everyone who didn't like the food, shut your pie holes and drink up, everything gets better the more you drink!

so, we drank through six carafes of white and red vino and through two wedding parties. by the time the third walked in we were on the topic of hula hoops, skip its, and bondage ball. we're a diverse group....what do ya want? we somewhat quieted, through giggles, as the best man gave his speech. however, once the praying started our eyes got wide and we felt as though we were in the wrong place at the wrong time! hahaha! whatever! jesus turned water into wine for a reason.....we were just drinkin' it up with the lord!

lastly, my man sings there. he's so cute and old with his musical talent. normally i hate the old, amongst other things, but this is one elderly man that i love to see once a year. so, needless to say i will be here next year again and i would recommend it for the experience and the FREE vino! take advantage kiddies! it is FREE!!!",vMnTPh-HffasFFaqZJNuZA,1,0,4,ZS-Npr9z2r0Vn_Ne4B5ZxQ

2089845,2017-12-08,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"This is definitely a fun little spot for a mom and pop feel Italian restaurant. Located (basically) underneath the High Roller next to the LINQ, it's rather easy to get to for locals and visitors alike. It is a very quick Lyft from the strip, and for locals they have their own private lot. The lot is FREE. This is of course now rare when dining on the Strip (so it is HIGHLY appreciated). 

Battista's is always busy, so you should absolutely make a reservation prior to arriving. Especially if you plan to visit on a weekend, or when there is a large event in town (so basically always). You can make a reservation directly on their website, and they'll email confirmation of your reserved time, very convenient. 

Note that they do not split checks here, so if you plan to bring a group, either all bring cash to pay, or know one person will need to pay the tab and be paid back by the group (my personal friend circle uses Venmo and it works wonders). 

When you arrive, you will walk through a mini corridor and into a mood lit place that is much larger than it appears. The hostess stand will be right in front of you with the small bar area to your left (you can sit here and order apps, but you must be seated to have dinner). We always sit here first and order drinks while we wait to be seated. It works well. Once your table is ready they will announce it over the speaker and lead you to your table. Once seated, they'll direct you to the walls to see their menu and specials. Its pretty much everywhere so no matter where you sit you'll be able to have a view of the menu. ALL of their dinners come with soup or salad, bread, and for dessert a cappuccino! So fun! The food itself is definitely above average. Not the best Italian I ever had, but still delicious and the servers are always friendly and quick. Did I mention the meals also included unlimited house wine??? You read that right, free red AND white house wine with dinner. Is it the best wine ever? Yes, because it's free wine!

2140421,2017-12-03,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"3 stars for the food, rounded up to 4 stars for great service! 

First of all, the concept of this old school Italian restaurant is different. There is a minimum $13 fee per person, but each entree is around $23-$41. This means that you can either choose to have a ton of food, or to pay the $13 fee which includes salad or soup, wine, garlic bread, and a cappuccino. 

For the 4 of us, we decided to just get 4 entrees so that we had extra to bring home. If you are just visiting and don't want leftovers, then I'd suggest just paying the $13 per person. I'd say that 3 entrees for 4 people would've been a good amount to order for us, since the soup/salad and garlic bread were pretty good and filling.

We really enjoyed the chicken parmesan and the lasagna. The spaghetti and 2 meatballs was pretty standard. We also got the linguini with chopped clams in white sauce and it was not very good.

I'd definitely come back for the ambiance, unlimited carafes of wine, garlic bread, and to try other pasta dishes. The service was great and they were very attentive in refilling our wine and bread.

2170575,2013-12-09,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"We happened across this gem after stopping by an info booth at Paris and asking for a good italian restaurant recommendation inside Paris or Bally's so we didn't have to go outside in the cold. The woman coyly asked ""Do you want a good place?"", which of course we answered yes. She told us about Battista's, mentioning more than once that it was the best in town and it was owned by the mob. We asked if it was expensive and she said no, because it was owned by the mob and it wasn't in one of the casinos. We were sold and were happy to make the quick walk outside and across the street to check it out.

The ambiance is charming. A sweet man was working outside and opening the door for guests to get in from the cold. Once inside, it was dark and cluttered with random memorabilia of all kinds. We knew immediately this was going to be good. It's what a lot of restaurant chains try to accomplish but this place did authentically. It was going to be an hour to an hour and a half wait, but neither of us seemed to mind, so we grabbed a seat in the bar area and had a glass of wine and some calamari.  The calamari was very tender and a good snack while we waited. 

We were seated about an hour later, taken to the back corner of one of the seating sections. Every meal comes with soup or salad, garlic bread, free house wine (red or white) and a homemade cappuccino. All for about $25 for the basic half of the menu, up to $35 for some of the fancier options. They only have 25 items on their menu, and I'm sure they make them all exactly like your sweet Italian grandmother would. It was comfort food at it's best. The salad was simple, but a nice start to the meal. The garlic bread was perfect, toasted so it was crunchy on the outside with a garlic mixture and cheese on top. Once the entrees came, we were just so pleased. The portions were hearty, and you could taste the tradition and love that went into the food. It was simple and classic and delicious! The wine isn't incredible, but it's not bad either, and pairs very well with the food (I'm guessing they use the same wine to cook with). And where else on the strip can you get a full meal for $25 that includes all the wine you can drink?!?

Then, the perfect ending to the meal was the cappuccino they bring you (also included). It comes topped with whipped cream and has a lovely flavor (maybe amaretto?) that just made me melt into my seat in our cozy little corner of the restaurant. It was the perfect ending to our meal experience, no additional dessert required (though it's available if you want to add it on). 

And Gordy! Gordy is the sweet, little (seriously, he is tiny) old man that walks around playing the accordion (and has been since 1981). As he approached our table, I wasn't trying to avoid making eye contact like i would most musicians in restaurants when I'm trying to eat. He was just cheerful and pleasant and adorable. He played a short song for me and my friend and was just cuter than words can describe. 

If you are looking for deluxe, high end italian fusion, Battista's in not the place for you. If you are looking for a great, classic italian meal experience, you don't want to miss this place (my friend said she hadn't had cooking like this since she was in Italy about a year ago). AND, all for a total of about $25! This is definitely on the list of places we will always stop by when we come to Vegas!",G28--Z6abvlpqf6oopPSsg,2,0,5,wIPxtxaDppqLKjL-jxMXTw
2174358,2011-05-17,3,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"I should have read the yelp reviews first...

I'm surprised at the people who believe this is an authentic Italian restaurant.  I admit, I was pulled in by the sign...I was given the impression that this was an old school italian joint so I thought maybe the food had a chance.

I'd rather go to Olive Garden and that's pretty sad.  Beware of any restaurant that has a bunch of bullshit on their walls and some dancing monkey doing tricks.  It's usually a sure sign that they're trying to distract you from their mediocre food.

This is pretty much standard SYSCO food supply.  I ordered the cioppino, my girlfriend got the veal parm.  The cioppino was acceptable, but still a bit bland.  Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.

My girlfriend's veal was very bad.  Had a strange aftertaste that for me, made it fairly inedible.

Everyone mentions the garlic bread.  Sure, it's good, but it's garlic bread.  If you go to an Italian restaurant and your lasting impression was the garlic bread, the restaurant has failed.

I didn't need the accordion guy.  Again with the gimmicks.  I know people think that guy is cute and funny, etc, but personally, I found him very uncomfortable.  He bets on that uncomfortable to you pass him some money so he'll go away.  I felt kind of bad for him.  In a town where selling your soul for the hustle is standard practice, I didn't need it in my face while I'm trying to have a good meal.

It is a kitschy place, where every square inch is covered by either a photo of a celebrity, a cluster of plastic grapes on a trellis or a drippy candle in a wine bottle. Even before you walk through the front ""barrel"" door (built to resemble half a large wine cask), you are greeted by aroma of garlic and other fine Italian fare.

It is always busy here....reservations are recommended, especially for a big party. If you don't have reservations, be prepared to wait. (They do have a full bar though, and there is plenty of seating).

Now to the food.....the food varies from various pasta dishes to chicken marsala/parmigan, veal, steak pizziola, fillet mignon, etc. All dinners come with either soup or minestrone soup, a pasta side, all-you-can drink house wine (red or white) and a cappachino for desert. (which is unbelievable.) Maybe my palate gets more sophisticated the older I get, but I used to think that Battista's had excellent food....now I can honestly say, it is just good.

We live in Vegas and there are so many delicious Italian restaurants to go to, specially so close to the Strip. I had a Groupon and figured we would give this place a try. It wasn't worth the $100+ (before groupon was applied) for a party of 4 and a baby. 

The unlimited wine was absolutely nasty, the red as well as the white. The garlic bread was greasy and don't get me started on the cappuccino that was just a water down sugary instant coffee mix of some sort...

Now for the main dish. I had the veal parmigiano. It was really big but a bit soggy and the breading was thicker than the meat itself. The side dish of pasta marinara was so small my 21 month old son ended eating all of it as well my husband's and still wanted more. At least he enjoyed it, but I couldn't tell you how they were cooked since I didn't have not one bite, that's how small it was...

I'm very disappointed and would not go back there again! Spend your money on the Strip or even at Buca di Beppo right down the street. I would give this place a big fat 0 star if I could... just sad food",77LIFtkV2FlVbiSP4tHs1g,3,0,1,qmzekF9exxTnqs3SACGHBA

I have been coming here once a year or more for almost 20 years and it never changes.  Ever.  This is a good thing.  Prices really aren't that bad for what you get especially when you look at many other choices in Vegas.

I just have to laugh and shake my head when I see bad reviews of this fun little place.  Oh boo hoo the wine isn't top shelf, the waiter took too long, the prices are too high.  Seriously?  Take the stick out of your ass, try to smile and enjoy this gem of a restaurant for what it is.  It is a legendary, fun, kitschy, classic old Italian restaurant that isn't trying to be something it's not.

Relax, and take some time to look at all the decor and pictures on the walls.  Everyone from Elvis to Ol' Blue eyes to Liberace and everyone in between has eaten here.  That's just cool old school.  Soak in the ambiance and the low lighting,  Get tipsy with the free wine.  Yes, the 2 full carafe's of both red and white wine and the bread is FREE.

The dinner is standard Italian fare and is always delicious if not predictable.  The bread is always fresh and the bring you a nice cappuccino to complete your meal.  

The very best part of eating at Battista's however is Gordy.  This 90+ years young gentleman is the salt of the earth.  He will play you a song on his accordion that will make you smile every time, guaranteed.   Wearing a baseball cap?  He will play take me out to the ballgame.

In spite of my 3-star rating, you should go here because:
1) The little guy with the accordian singing ""When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, That's Amore"" is PRICELESS.  And followed by the Chicken Dance song.
2) The wine flows, and doesn't suck.  In fact, I liked it!  The red anyway, didn't try the white.
3) The several course meal in the dark rooms, walls covered with photos of icons of the past who used to hang out here... it's great for chillin' with your friends, drinking, relaxing and stepping back from the standard Las Vegas vibe.

Salad - spring mix salad in a bag, like you get at the grocery, with a little added mozzarella cheese, 1 olive, and 1 tomato, with Italian dressing. It was okay.

Wine - I'm not sure you can call the house wine real wine, more of a win-like-fluid. The best I can say is that it's drinkable, and forgettable. It tastes like it's been watered down but I don't know if that's the case or not.

Garlic bread - The accompanying garlic bread was like that you would get in your grocer's freezer section. Meh.

Entree - We had the mussels in red sauce and enjoyed it. The pasta was perfectly al dente. The tomato sauce is a little spicy and I liked that. It tasted somewhat fresh with whole basil leaves. The mussels were a tad over cooked, but not so much that I didn't enjoy them. 

Cappuccino - I don't know what was in my plastic mug, but it sure as hell wasn't cappuccino. Took one sip and it was awful. Very sugary sweet and tasted of chocolate. I'm guessing this is some powder mix in a mug. Yuk.

Service - our waiter existed, but we hardly ever saw him. I would actually say it was poor service. He hardly even spoke and wouldn't even look you in the face. We waited over 20 minutes for him to pick up our payment I gave up and went to the host desk.

Atmosphere - this was the fun part; there is so much to see and read on the walls and ceiling you could be there for years. One small downside was that our tablecloth was freshly stained with the wine-like-fluid.

If you like wine and can eat a lot, this is a pretty fairly priced option.

In any case, I had the minestrone with my meal which was pretty ordinary. Tasted a bit like it came out of a can. For my entree, I had the veal parm. Again, it was pretty ordinary. The veal wasn't particularly tender. The ""cappuccino"" at the end of the meal wasn't cappuccino. It really tasted like some sugary powdered coffee-like drink.

The food is fine (but crazy overpriced).  Our service was excellent.  The accordion guy is amusing.  The decor is kitschy and colorful.  The gals at the hostess stand were standoffish and definitely need personality transplants.

Look, I love great service and the service was really friendly and attentive.  So, they get points for that.

The food was perfectly edible.  It's not great and it's not bad.  But with a million great restaurants in LV, I'm not sure you need to be eating average food anywhere.

The lasagna was about as good as you can buy in the frozen food section of your local supermarket.  It was fine but nothing special.  The chicken parmigiana was a much, much better dish and, if you must eat here, I would go for that plate.

You get two pitchers of wine (white and red) on your table and you pour it yourself and drink as much as you want.  It's all included with the overpriced food.  It's drinkable stuff but nothing special.  You do realize there are bottles of wine out there for sale that are $2 and $3 a bottle right?  This is probably that stuff.  So, don't get too excited about the ""free"" wine.

You also get a ""homemade"" cappuccino included with your meal.  It's an absolute sugar bomb and unlike any other cappuccino I've ever had.  For me, this WAS the dessert (and honestly, even though the sugar levels were off the charts, it was pretty darn good).

The salad was wonderful and included with the meal.  We weren't offered a choice of dressing.  However, the house Italian was light and delicious.  The garlic bread was pretty standard.

The wine.  I can't say it was great but it went well with the meal.  It's free so you can stop your whining if you have issues and go to the nearest casino and pay $10 a glass if it makes you feel better.  I felt happy with the FREE unlimited wine provided.  Thank you.

This place is basically your family owned Olive Garden with a kitschy decor of trinkets and air/railroad liquor bottles. Free flowing jug wine can turn this $20 pasta entree place into a pretty good deal if you drink enough of it.

Pros
-All you can drink red or white house wine 
-Meal comes with your choice of soup or salad
-All you can eat delicious garlic bread
-Service this visit was the best ever received and I have been here numerous times
-Salad was light & flavorful just the right amount of dressing

Cons
-Quality & taste has gone down the last few years the meals we ordered were bland
-Portions are small for the price 
-Price has gone up just like everything else but $24.95 for lasagna and $21.95 for spaghetti is a bit much 
-Wait time is terrible even if you do make a reservation before hand.

2542773,2018-03-03,1,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"OK, where to start.....

I appreciate independent family restaurants, and in most cases they cook with recipes passed down through generations. 

This IS NOT that place. The kitschy decor with old memorabilia gives the air of a certain authenticity and non commercialized feel unlike the rest of the strip. The food however is a completely different story. 

I am shocked by the amount of 5 star reviews! I have come to the following conclusion, either these reviewers are:

1. Friends and family
2. Have never eaten in a restaurant better than a McDonalds 
3. Don't know how to cook from scratch
4. Exclusively eat Stouffer's freezer lasagna and ""make"" pasta by boiling dry noodles and pouring Ragu jar sauce over top. 
5. Have recently taken part in Las Vegas' new legal marijuana laws before going out for dinner 
6. Are completely sloshed from the cheap ""house wine"" they serve BEFORE they serve you precooked low quality and mass produced food. 

I am still in awe that the place was full and kept turning over tables. I can't imagine that any of the diners, (us included) could have ever been repeat customers. 

There is excellent food in Las Vegas. If a celebrity chef restaurant is too pricey, do yourself a favour and go to something like Maggianos where although it's a chain, the food is actually good.",DY3E2ElLACn2N6_PQlhQog,1,0,1,J9EQ0sEEASt8bmsZ6VmIWQ

I also enjoyed the convenience of the ""pre-fixe"" menu, in that you get the wine, bread, soup/salad and entree included with every dinner. The only downfall to this is if you aren't hungry enough for all of the food that's coming your way. It would be nice to be able to order just an entree or soup/salad, but I the current system works as well. 

  The bread was AMAZING!!! The eggplant parm was AMAZING, even though it didn't have spaghetti included, but I wasn't hungry enough for that anyway. 

  Stay away from the white wine if you like things that taste good. It's all about that red wine. Unless, of course, the red wine carafe is empty, in which case drink up that free booze!

-First off, I'm not a fan of being served on old PLASTIC plates and cups versus glassware..
-Second, the older waitress did not even offer us the menu, she simply passed by and said "" the menu is on the wall"" yet, the table that sat right next to us a few moments later where greeted with much more delight...
-Third, we noticed that all entrees come with a TEN OUNCE meat of choice...therefore my we decided to ""split"" one entree since it comes with such a huge portion of meat, a salad, a pasta dish, bread sticks, wine and a cappuccino.  However, we were told we were NOT allowed to do so or we would incur an additional $13 charge for doing that...it's absolutely absurd that a restaurant charges you for wanting to share your plate with whomever you choose. 
-Fourth of all, the wine was horrible.  Not near a quality red wine at all!
-Fifth, the food is by no means FRESH...it is evident that the bread sticks were previously frozen and not freshly baked.  My fettuccine entree was absolutely disgusting, It was smothered in sooo much nasty sauce that I had to ask for an additional plate just to scoop all that extra sauce off my plate. The sauce seemed as if it was straight out of can, I'm almost certain that it was not prepared in the kitchen either.

Four stars? Yes, for the Rigatoni with white clams (on menu as linguine, but I enjoy when the chopped bivalves get inside a tubular pasta, at home I use cavatelli). But yes, the dish is THAT good. Huge portion, well executed with both clams in the shell & chopped. Some pepper flakes & grated cheese = mangia! Also, I leave with a to go box with at least two snacks worth of leftovers. 

The atmosphere is loud and lively and every inch the eye can see is covered in some tchotckes. Gordy the adorable accordion player is charming and is as much a fixture as the unlimited red and white carafes of wine and accompanying soup, salad, sides & cappuccino. 

Others have enjoyed chicken, veal, steak and various menu options and the fun vibe you can't help but find infectious once you open the wine barrel door into this unassuming strip mall spot (no curb appeal) behind the Flamingo. 

No, you're certainly not going for Chateau Margeaux or artisan plated food. Instead, go with a date or a fun group (make reservations because you will wait otherwise)  eat, drink and be merry in this Las Vegas institution.

2629499,2012-03-14,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Simone and I have always loved Battista's Hole In the Wall located just off the strip in Las Vegas. It has an old Vegas vibe, and always has very good home cooked Italian food.  We first went to Battista's during our honeymoon on the advise of a travel book and we have been back three or four times since. With our vacation winding down and the reality of going back to our everyday world creeping in, we decided what better way to cheer ourselves up then to visit our old standby.  Although located in a easy to miss small strip mall behind the Flamingo Hotel and Casino Battista's is always busy, no matter what time or what day you go, be prepared to either make a reservation or wait for at least 15 minutes. They are only open for dinner and locals and tourists alike fill up the many tables quickly.  Waiting for a table at Battista's is torture for the soul. As you sit and take in the many pictures of celebrities, the mini Liquor bottle collection and the strange Knic-knacks that fill the ceiling you are overcome by the delicious aroma from the kitchen of fresh baked Garlic Bread and Ripe Tomato Sauce.
After about a 15 minute wait Simone and I were led to a table in one of the side rooms. It was only a few seconds before the waitress got to our table with two full pitchers of House Red and White Wine. This is one of the wonderful surprises that you get at Battista's. With every meal comes lots of House Red and White wine, and while a wine snob may not find this to be the best they have ever tasted, to a Maine redneck like me, it is perfection in a pitcher. Also free with the meal is some very toasty Garlic bread that is pasted with crushed whole cloves of garlic. Don't worry about saving the bread for dinner, when you finish it they'll bring you more... Each meal also comes with Minestrone Soup or a fresh Italian Salad with house made vinaigrette, salami, cheese, tomatoes and an olive.  We have never had the soup ( don't want to fill up on all that broth) but we do enjoy the salad. To finish off the free stuff you also get a side of basic pasta with your choice of sauce.
There are no menus on the table at Battista's. They are posted on the wall of every room. Although the prices at first glance seem pricey ( chicken at 27.00- insanity !) keep in mind you are getting endless wine and bread, fresh soup or salad, pasta and oh yeah, the best damn Cappuccino ever to finish the meal. More on that later.
For her meal, Simone had Spaghetti and Meatballs and I ordered Veal Parmesan. While we waited for our meal we were greeted with a song from our favorite little old man accordion player. It is rumored that he has been going from table to table performing since Battista's first came to Vegas more then 30 years ago. He looks to be in his nineties, but he plays a damn good accordion, and in my opinion ( which is always correct) He really just puts the icing on the whole Battista experience. Italian wine, Italian food and Italian music. You get it all when you are here. The food arrived shortly after our evening serenade and although I have seen prettier dishes, they were cooked perfectly. The Veal was literally drowning in melted Mozzarella and fresh ripe tasting Tomato Sauce. If you do not love your cheese then avoid this. If you do love cheese ( and also baby cow) then this is the dish for you.  Along with the Veal was a side of intense flavored spinach seasoned with spices including a good dose of nutmeg. This was different but good. Simone shared her meatballs which were also very good. Large, tender and well seasoned they mixed perfectly with the tomato sauce and al dente spaghetti. Surprisingly we finished everything ( including most of the wine-yow!)   After some deliberation we decided to finish the meal with the Italian specialty Cannoli, with of course two (free) Cappuccino's. The Cannoli shell was crispy and mildly vanilla flavored while the smooth and creamy cheese filling was rich and dense. 
The Cappuccino is not to be missed, it is unlike any other - Its not at all like coffee. Its not bitter but slightly chocolaty sweet and it is the perfect way to end your meal.  
We love it here and would suggest it to anyone looking to get away from the craziness of the strip, get drunk on cheap wine, and have some damn good Italian food while being brought back to the old",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,1,0,4,qZTQsXZV_AqGmeZRBoQzNQ

Each meal includes wine, garlic bread, salad, the entree, a side of pasta and a cappuccino. So it's a full-service joint.

The servers are usually on the ball and the hosts handle reservations well. Their 90-year-old accordion player is a rare treat but sometimes he lingers too long for tips, which can confuse first-time diners who don't know they're supposed to fund him.

Most importantly, you'll never go home hungry. Opt for this place over the usual chains and you'll be glad you did.",cJ8hIsBgxBMivCI640bX8Q,1,0,4,HVs2zp8_nHhkDqDKA1dj5g

The menu is limited and posted on boards on the wall.  You pretty much just pick whatever item you want and it comes with soup or salad, beverage including house wine, and a cappucino thing after dinner.  Most meals are about $22 and include everything I just mentioned, so pricewise its a good deal.

I've always found the food to be good but I usually just stick to the pasta dishes.

If you're a high maintenance or trendy type of person this is not the place for you - you'll be unhappy as soon as you walk in the door.  If you're laid back and like things a little retro or different then you'll really appreciate this place.",4krT9JxgkdxLKo7slwOKkA,5,1,5,KBG1EujDTqlzohnFlg-Kaw

2668895,2012-01-29,5,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Long Long ago Battista's used to be one of the Better Italian Restaurants in Vegas. It has now taken over as the WORST Italian Restaurant in Vegas (knocking Capo's to second worst). I can't imagine that Battista or Desi or any of the Battista family member have anything to do with it anymore because of how terrible it is. 

It has expanded over the years and still has the look and charm of its better days. The hostess doormen are friendly. ""The future is in your hands"" sign next to the mens urinals is still there. I took a friend here that has never been but always wanted to try it. I hadn't tried it for 7 years so I was happy to revisit again with my BFF. I remember 7 years ago, the food was going down hill and was average at best, but everyplace deserve a second change and especially since it had been so long. 

It was just the 2 of us and we were seated shortly after our 7pm reservation in the section to the back left as you face the kitchen.  The meal comes with your choice or Minestrone soup or salad, garlic bread, wine  with whatever dish you order. The wine is in large carafes on the table when you are seated. 1 is white the other a red blend. It comes with the 3 ounce glass. The wine is drinkable but its basically church wine.Even though I'm not usually a white wine fan the white was better than the red. Shortly after our server Brittney came over explained how the ordering and options work and took our orders. We both chose the Minestrone soup. I was split between that or a salad but on Brittney's suggestion I chose the soup. The soup comes out fairly quicklyand took the first sip...It's FRIGGEN' Progresso Minestrone or canned stuff for sure. It was closer to luke warm than hot but I eat about 3/4 the soup since I was starving. Its not that the soup is bad it just not good and canned soup is never okay to serve without at least doctoring it up.  I was unimpressed but so far not bad just not good. The garlic bread comes out and it was the highlight of the meal. It is probably the frozen garlic  hated as the consistency was not fresh baked or from a bakery at all. The pre perforated slices were a give away too. It was  fairly good though. We both order the Cheese Ravioli. They give you quite a few Ravioli unlike most that give you 5 or 6 at most you get twice that here. Unfortunately just like the rest of the food, it was just frozen Ravioli heated up and covered it what was most likely Ragu or some jarred garbage sauce. There was nothing home made tasting about the entire meal. Asked if we wanted the Cappuccino at the end , I couldn't stomach it after the disappointment of what I was put through the rest of the meal. 

The highlight was the service and the original decorations/pictures hanging everywhere.  Brittney was a sexy, attentive and good server.  The busser was also quite good and of course the accordion player who was built with the place.

Even with the service and atmosphere pluses I can't give Battista's any more than 1 star because the food does a disservice to Italian food and now Las Vegas. They exist now solely to trick the poor tourists into buying crappy food and cheap wine making them believe it is a deal. They need to close up shop or if they want to stay in business move shop to the Circus Circus Buffet.  I can't believe the Locatelli's would have anything to do with Battista's anymore and they just handle the real estate they own around the Valley now. That's what I believe at least.",40m0541Z_KexYkdvvqHJIQ,5,2,1,2MYPMvYuiIzLXkrVnt5wZw

2687059,2017-07-08,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"I'm giving this establishment a solid three stars. I have been told about this restaurant by others who really seemed to enjoy the food and the ambience. This is not a chain restaurant and it is off strip so I did not know what to expect. However, I have eaten at places such as Olive Garden and Maggianos enough to have a certain expectation. Unfortunately our expectations were not met.

When we first entered, we noticed that the lighting was low and it became very evident once we were seated. Not only was it dim but the lights themselves are orange in color casting that orange lowly light over everything.

The menus are on the wall and most of your meals include soup or salad, the entrée, a side of pasta and a cappuccino.

We decided to split the chicken Parmesan for $30. When you split a meal they will tack on the additional charge. For our trip it was an extra $13 to cover the second person. My wife had the salad with Italian dressing and I tried the minestrone soup. Both were fairly plain. They tasted OK but nothing to write home about. Garlic bread also was decent but I would've traded for some OG breadsticks.

The entrée portion was nice and large. We expected a good size portion that we could split. They say the chicken comes out at 10 ounces which is fine because we each are comfortable having about five or 6 ounces of meat separately. It tasted pretty good but seemed a little thick and heavy. The side of pasta seem like something my eight-year-old would give me at home. The pasta itself was cooked al dente but had no flavor. The sauce on top was probably homemade and tasted good but not good enough to finish the small side portion.

During your dinner you have your choice of white or red house wine. We tried the red wine first and our impression was that we were drinking communion wine at church. So we decided to try the white which was lighter in tone and had a little more fruit on the nose. Both wines could have been third crush. I would not have paid separately for these wines but they were included as part of the meal.

My wife and I both agree that the best part of the entire meal were the cappuccinos at the end. My wife doesn't drink coffee but she really enjoyed these drinks. They tasted more like hot chocolate then true cappuccino.

About four hours after the meal my wife wasn't feeling so good. She had an upset stomach which could've been a result of not being used to acidic red sauces.

I'm glad we visited just so that we can say we been there.",Uat9b59jjIOAlCYIaJG42w,3,0,3,A9TQoxNsDYdgHaoVLQrolQ

Despite the name, (and that the location and atmosphere match up to the name) I enjoyed my experience. The menu is simple and the dishes are delightful; keeping in mind that most of the dishes are
made in bulk.
Bread: average
All you can drink wine: white- blah, red- fine (all you can drink I'm not going to get picky
Spaghetti and meatballs: delicious 
Cappuccino: more like a dessert (served with whipped cream)
Soup: average

Mostly this restaurant earned a four star because I enjoyed my experience. Got sat right away (Monday night around 8:30) and the ambiance was good: dark & swanky! Not four stars for the food. Food: 3 stars.

It overcompensates for its really mediocre food by all the other kitsch items they have and the all the wine you can drink feature, for those that are interested in that.  I think the service was ""middle of the road,""  as well.

I have had better Italian food at the chains out there (Carraba's, Macaroni Grill, Olive Garden).  They do serve you a filling meal but it's just not that great.  I guess people go try it because of its novelty value and its long history, being adjacent to the Strip.  Sorry, but that's not enough for a return visit.

The garlic bread, while plentiful tasted like that frozen bread you get in the grocery store, with too much seasoning. Still not that big of a deal. I ordered lasagna, my husband spaghetti and meatballs and my daughter chicken parm. Well, I guess we drew the short straws, because my daughters was above average and our was not great. My husbands spaghetti was equivalent to junior high cafeteria food. And for $25, it should be a heck of a lot better.

The only reason I can see people hyping this place up is because they're drunk off the all you can drink red/white wine. I personally am not big on wine so I ate sober... 

Salad: It had a rectangular shaped peice of cheese on it and I think a cold cut slice of meat, which i was surprised by as I was asking about vegetarian items just 2 minutes before the salad came out... my mistake, I thought the salad was safe!

Bread: nothing special. Wasn't gross but it wasn't super offensive. 

Eggplant Parmigiana: I just have had better. The red sauce was bland and the eggplant was covered in cheese which was overwhelming. There was soooooooo much cheese.

Side of pasta: literally,  a side dish of penne pasta with more bland red sauce on it. 

Cappuccino: you know that machine at, like, all gas stations? Then you already know what this tastes like.

Service: not terrible,  but not super friendly or welcoming. Would it hurt to show some personality or ask some nom-invasive questions? Is this your first time here? Would you like to hear some customer favorites? Etc... no one explained the menu or asked us if we wanted anything other than the wine. We had to ask for a drink menu.

We came in for dinner and the place was absolutely packed. The 2 girls working the front desk could not have been any more nonchalant or rude. They couldn't care less if we left or stayed when they quoted us a 1.5 hour wait. 

Luckily, they managed to inform us that the bar area was open seating, and there were 2 seats available at a high top. The only drawback to this area is that the menu is a lot smaller. We both just wanted Spaghetti and Meatballs, so we went for it. Our server in the bar was awesome. I wish I remembered her name because she was friendly and quick to get us our food. 

The meal was average, but just right after a day of drinking. If I wanted something quick to coat my belly, I would come back and sit at the bar. But the food isn't good enough to warrant a 1.5 hour wait for the main dining room, and putting up with the attitudes of people who clearly don't want to be working there.",gZHCbDOkHdHIk2d02FN3kw,23,17,3,hdgzCVtt0z39vd6G87nW_w

The place was jam packed with people and took forever to be seated because, unless your whole party is present, they won't seat you even with a reservation.  Once we got seated, it was a quick explanation of the menu and if we needed any time to order.  We ordered our food and ""Wham-O"", our food was there immediately.  We had Chicken Cacciatore and Veal Parmigiana as our main course.  The chicken was dry and the veal was thin & fatty.  The sauces were thin and seemed watered down.  At the end of our meals, the server, who had the personality of a wet mop, immediately threw down the check without asking if we needed anything else or if we wanted dessert.  It would have been a shame because the Cannoli, which wasn't the best, was the best part of this meal.  We also ordered a side of sausage, which were thin sliced pieces covered in a pasty tomato sauce for $8.50!  
Parking sucked!! It was a nightmare to get there, the parking lot is small and they park limos right in front of the entry making it impossible to get by.  We had to park at a nearby hotel and walk to the restaurant.
I don't know if the original owners are involved or even care about the place anymore but it SUCKED!!  Obviously, they are only catering to tourists and their past history.  I can't see how locals would keep going there with so many other good Italian restaurants in town.
Unfortunately, we will never be back there again.  I'd rather remember the past good times there than the feeling like I just ate at a Furr's Cafeteria!",jFstakj1H7l3zuVESp0Ygw,0,0,1,TE62iPw4w_r2l-Hwx7lLvA

The food is already prepared and plated (think airline food) and is brought out seconds after ordering. All the food is moved from table to table on carts, and when you order they pull a plate off the cart and serve you. They're simply trying to move as many people through as possible. We thought we'd have a nice, relaxing, long Italian meal with family and friends but after less than 45 minutes the waiter asked if we could leave because they needed the table for another party. Unreal. Half of our party wasn't even finished with their meal. For a bill in excess of $300 we should've at least been afforded the opportunity to order dessert or finish our wine. 
It's super expensive. No dish cheaper than $23...and that was for simple spaghetti. The better dishes are $35 and up.

First of all, if you look up ""tourist trap"" in the dictionary, you will find a picture of Battista's.  I speculate (emphasizing the word ""speculation"" and not ""allegation"" here) that, in a nod to its alleged mob past, someone is greasing the palms of every cab driver and concierge in town.  Whatever they are doing, it is working.  The place seems to be mobbed (pardon the pun) every night.  (Make a reservation!)  People seem to like the complimentary wine, garlic bread, and soup or salad.  Personally, I thought they were worth every penny, so to speak.  The only exception was the complimentary cappuccino, which was pretty good.  I would have ordered a different salad, but the very sparse one-page menu has no other salads, or soups for that matter.   Or wine list.  You eat and drink what they put in front of you.

I ordered the sausage cacciatori, which consisted of a pretty bland sweet Italian sausage link in a bed of some very weird sauce.  My guess is that the sauce was mostly green peppers, with a touch of tomato and garlic, run through a blender for ten minutes.  Yuck.  I also tried the side order of meatballs, which were also bland but at least the sauce tasted more or less like canned tomatoes.  Time to start thinking about drive through at McDonald's on the way home.

The service was okay, I guess.  Kind of slow and kind of disinterested, but the food got to the table.  The ambiance was busy, with lots of knick knacks and photos of entertainers on the walls.  The prices were not a huge bargain, but were acceptable if you count some of it as going to the complimentary wine.  (Here's a secret:  If you sit in the bar you can order a version of the full dinner menu without the ""complimentary"" wine, at a much lower price.  And also avoid the wait for a table.  They don't trumpet this deal, so you heard it here first.)

So, anyway, we won't be going back to Battista's.  If you are willing to wait 45 minutes for a table at an Italian restaurant, I would recommend going a couple of miles west on Flamingo Boulevard and eating at Nora's Italian Cuisine.  Much better food at comparable prices.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,3,wTAU8ZYSErr-S3TdY_6irg

The place is filled with pictures and autographs of stars and singers from the Vegas heyday. What is amazing as soon as they seat you they bring two kinds of house wine which is included with your meal. The wine is very good as well.

You also get oversized garlic bread and a great Italian salad with really good dressing before your meal. The seats are very big but the waiters and waitresses are awesome and friendly. I had the egg plant Parmesan which was fantastic and I also was thrilled because they brought out cappuccino with whip cream to end the meal.

Having just been in NY a couple of weeks before, I was looking forward to seeing how the food compared to by Patsy's Italian Restaurant NY experience which was amazing! I have to say, it really didn't compare. The free red wine was not good at all. It had a vinegar taste. No one at the table liked it. I didn't get to try the white though. I ordered lasagna which the waiter said he thought was the best thing on the menu. I have to say...it was pretty delicious. The side of meatballs I got were average. No one else was thrilled with their main dishes either.

The good parts of Battistas are good and the bad parts are expected.

First off the decor is totally dated -- and this is a plus!  When  you walk through the door you are transported to New Jersey circa 1978. 

Secondly, this has to be the best order and dine system in Vegas. All entrees come with either soup or salad, side pasta and an after dinner sweetened cappuccino. In addition carafes of house wine are yours to drink for no additional charge.  This also makes reading the bill easier. Another win for Battistas.

Third up is the food. This one is not so good. My party tried spaghetti with meat sauce, lasagna and a steak dish.  All were edible but ho-hum. I really thought that they would be special due to the longevity of the operation. Oh well.

I don't remember the prices since I came here over a year ago maybe 2, but even if they were high you get so many other items with your meal. The wine isn't the greatest but it comes bundled with your meal so why not. 

They do have an old old man that goes around playing the accordion, it's actually very sweet and comedic at the same time. But I prefer people not to go around soliciting for money and entertainment while I eat.

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan and I believe it was a huge piece of meat. The pasta was just okay, slathered on sauce onto spaghetti noodles. The garlic bread was more just buttered french loaf. Not really a fan of the food. But the cappuccino was yummy and a nice ending to the meal.

The restaurant is dark, decorated with old photos on the walls, the menus are posted on the walls. The restaurant is divided into rooms. We got a nice little cozy table in a corner. We were brought over water, the server asked what kind of wine we wanted, red or white, we went with both. After he took our order warm, delicious, garlic bread was brought to us. OMG I could have skipped dinner and just eaten the bread. YUM! Our meals came with a soup or salad and we both went with the house salad. It was very good. 
I went with the chicken Alfredo and it was on point. My bf had a steak caruso dish and he was impressed with it. It had tender pieces of steak with sautéed veggies. We both enjoyed our meals and I can honestly say that it was the best meal I had in Vegas. At the end of our meal we got complimentary cappuccinos that were to die for.

From the outside, it looks like a sleazy bar, maybe an extension of the liquor store next door. The inside looks like a low-rent version of Buca di Beppo, walls cluttered with photos and inscrutable memorabilia. I was worried that the food would taste like Buca, but my fears were assuaged. 

They start you off with the ""free"" wine and tiny glasses; my large party had carafes of white and red. The white was perfectly pleasant ""chablis,"" and though I didn't sample the ""burgundy,"" my companions pronounced it to be nearly palatable.

Then the garlic bread appeared. Like an idiot, I gorged myself on it. It was quintessential - fluffy but chewy, loaded with salty garlic-ness. 

The minestrone soup (also included) tasted fine, though the base was a bit gummy. Most of my tablemates opted for the salad - I just do not understand.

By the time my lasagna arrived, big as a brick and covered in molten cheese, I was so full I could only take two bites. But man, was it good! 

The food is very straightforward, American-style Italian, cooked to generally pleasing textures. Very appetizing stuff. So good that I took several more bites of lasagna than I should have. 

To cap the night, they offer you this little mug of cappuccino topped with whipped cream. Honestly, it tasted like hot cocoa, which is fine by me!

The prices were outrageous, of course, this being just off the Las Vegas Strip. At $25, my lasagna was one of the cheaper entrees on the board.

Sure you can eat at one of those restaurants on the strip that is owned by some famous chef that I never heard of, and pay $50 a head. Or you can go to a family style restaurant that doesn't take itself seriously, has a casual atmosphere about it and get a good meal for the money.

I've been several times before yelling and overall pretty happy. Service can be real hit or miss, usually just okay so have to lower my rating. The server today left mid meal and never came back, needed water, didn't put dressing on the side of the salad like asked or come back to check in. Even with that I was still happy because of the decent value and fun atmosphere.

You get lots of tasty bread that comes with butter and garlic. Entrees include either salad or soup but I like to get both. Entrees include wine and also a cappuccino at the end. 

The lasagna is just right portion of meat, cheese, noodle ratio and good flavors. Nothings really super amazing but I've been happy overall and like this place a lot.

Everyone has to rate it on their own experience and let me tell you about ours...it was the highlight of our food experiences while in Vegas!

We had NO wait...we came early (5pm) by Vegas standards since we were meeting friends later..and although it filled up quickly, we were seated immediately.  Hint: go early.

Solid value...Not sure if bad reviews about price are from folks that frequent McDonald's, but I thought price was fine.  We spent more money at a couple casino food courts that had absolutely horrible food....and spent 4 x the price at a steak house that, although good, did not satisfy us like batistas.  

Food and wine were super!  I am not much for wine...my wife is a good bit more discerning in this area...but we both enjoyed the complimentary red and white.  If you have to have high end stuff...buy it...but batistas version is fine and heck, it costs the same amount to have a sip or to have multiple carafs...we chose the latter approach and enjoyed a bunch of red and white...and it tasted better with every sip.  As for the food...we come from a solid Italian community with lots of good home grown restaurants that make olive garden seem inadequate...and we really enjoyed our food at batistas.  I had veal, my wife had some type of shrimp dish... we had a good bit of it before the wine clouded our judgement, and it was well prepared, large portions, and very tasty.

3262029,2009-02-03,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"My experience with Italian restaurants is that the best ones are not overseen by some chef wanting to make his or her mark on the cuisine, but by an immigrant who had spent the majority of his or her life feeding the family, and now that the kids are grown, has taken those skills to care for the restaurant's patrons. These establishments are usually holes in the wall, garlic and tomato-scented spots inserted into strip malls between a convenience store and a dry cleaners.

With that in mind, I chose Battista's Hole in the Wall when I went out to dinner with a group of convention-goers in Las Vegas last week.

First off, this place is FUN! The walls were as crowded as the restaurant itself with pictures of Las Vegas royalty from years past. Trinkets and chotchkies hung in the room's nooks and crannies. Entering this restaurant is to enter the home of a person devoted to living life around the dining table, for that is where the day begins, pauses for respite, and ends.

Once seated, a stern waiter placed carafes of wine on our table, announcing that the wine and garlic bread are free, and the menus are on the wall. And indeed they were, but we hadn't noticed them until this fellow had called them to our attention.

During our meal, a petite octogenarian traversed the dining room with an accordion as big as he (if not bigger), playing various tunes on request and hamming it up for the crowded tables. He focused on the pretty lady at our table and played her the tarantella, pausing to point at the black buttons on the left hand of the accordion to passionately cry: ""The BASS! Nobody plays BASS anymore!"" This was indeed dinner and a show.

I had the cannelloni. It was OK. The accompanying spinach reminded me of frozen spinach, the kind that came out of a box and most of us generally detested as kids. A similar complaint came from another member of the group, who'd had the salmon and expressed concern that it had freezer burn. I'm not an expert in meat, so perhaps group-think has since led me to believe that the meat in my cannelloni was similarly spiced.
Another member of the group called the cappacino that the restaurant gives for free at the end of the meal: ""truck stop cappacino,"" referring to the machines that make it. It's no Starbucks drink, and it does taste like hot chocolate, which is why I liked it.

Would I come here if I were dining alone? No. Would I come here with my date? Not a chance. This restaurant is not suited for such moments in our lives, neither where food nor ambiance are concerned. However: would I come here with a bunch of acquaintances who want to have a good time and perhaps eat a little food in the process? Sure. Battista's Hole in the Wall drops the pretentions of normal dining, challenges us to not take things as seriously as we normally do, and pay attention to those oft-ignored things that we rely upon throughout life.

For, in the words of the restaurant's owner: ""The BASS! Oh, NOBODY plays the BASS anymore!""",mQo3ip0w2t7ESFAAuFf0_w,0,0,3,m4jl8q0bMj0mnVTUWg__lA

I was told by one of the assistant managers to ask for Doug the general manager because he's very good at approving coupons especially for brand new customers and upon calling them today the inflection in his voice and the way he handled the phone call was very arrogant and very careless and did not seem to care that I would not only lose money on my coupon but also the fact that I was a new customer and would rather argue then make an exception even after I was told he is good at these things and has no issues whatsoever but apparently he does not care about customers especially new ones.

Walking up to the restaurant, it was good to see that they still have a doorman that welcomes you inside...a nice touch. Once inside, it was pleasant to see that it literally has not changed ONE bit since I last ate there however many years prior. It's still extremely dark and the walls are covered with a plethora of random memorabilia. 

A polite older woman at the hostess station greeted us and we only had to wait five minutes or so before we were taken to our table. The waiter promptly came up to the table and took our drink order, and the drinks were out in a flash (along with the complimentary wine). 

The next items that came out were a basket of garlic bread, an Italian Salad for myself and a minestrone soup for my date. We both LOVED the garlic bread...it was extremely soft and very tasty. The salad was pretty good and she loved the Minestrone.

As for our entrees, she ordered the Lasagna, and I had a New York Steak with a side of Ziti and Marinara sauce. She thoroughly enjoyed her dish, and I thought mine was decent. The steak was a little on the bland side, and the sauce that accompanied the pasta wasn't too great.

The desserts we had were excellent though. First, we had the cappuccino that comes as a part of the meal...and in addition, we had the cannolis. They were quite delicious, though not the best we've ever had.

This is a great place for a romantic evening, and it's not too terribly priced. You can expect to spend around $25-30 a person, but you have to figure in the unlimited wine as well as the salad/soup, garlic bread and cappuccino.",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,0,0,3,fL78grvguVvhiokRjYkYDQ

My wife's chicken was certainly ""cooked"" and very dead...No juice was saved in the killing of this fowl. :-)  Still full meal on the strip for two with unlimited wine for less that $75 including tip has value.

3287268,2012-11-14,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"We waited almost 2 hours for a table of 6 and it was not worth the wait. Food is overpriced for the quality. (entrees are at least $22) We saw our busser/food runner more often than our waiter who only came to take our order, bring our food and bring the check. He didn't even introduce himself or ask us how the food was. 

The bad: You're entire group has to be present and then your wait time starts. It would have been a lot better if the hostess told me that crucial fact when I put my name on the wait list. She quoted us 45 min, that passed, then she said another 20 min, that passed, another 20 min, that passed, 15 min, finally a table. Get a reservation if you really want to try it.
Got the pomodoro and the sauce was runny and watered down. My friends got the lasagna which is massive and the eggplant parm which was ok. The white wine tasted watered down, and didn't even smell like wine.

The good: unlimited wine. The red wine was actually ok, it's more sweet than dry. The salad and garlic bread was bomb. The ""cappuccino"" (it's hot chocolate with a shot of caffeine and whip cream) was good. The portions are big.

3315890,2011-09-26,2,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"The first time we went here, it was one of my favorite stops to eat at in Sin City. But after our last visit, the novelty has kind of wore off. Battista's is located about a block off of the strip behind the Flamingo. Plenty of parking right by the door. Expect a little wait, but it's worth it. We usually pass the time by stopping at the dive bar in the same parking lot for a couple cheap PBRs.

Like other reviewers have noted, it is a bit overpriced. You can expect to pay in the neighborhood of $60 with tip for two adults. But hey, it's Las Vegas, who cares!? You wont leave hungry or without being at least mildly buzzed. My wife usually gets fettucini and I'll order Spaghetti and Meatballs. As soon as your wait-staff approaches your table you are offered a craft of house wine. Its good enough, you wont be disappointed. The garlic bread is very very good and i'm usually not that generous with garlic bread. My wife gave the salad a thumbs up and you can sub applesauce for the picky eater in your crowd. The entree portions are large and we have no complaints with the food at all. The complimentary desert Cappuccino is AWESOME. I don't drink coffee or cappuccino and I love it.  I think its closer to hot chocolate than any kind of coffee/cappuccino. But seriously, it's a tasty way to round out the meal.

The biggest bummer is the increasingly creepy accordion player. The first time we went to Battista's we were entertained and thought it was a neat touch, the rest of my family loved him as well. He'll ask you where you're from, pretend to play a song associated with that place and mumble out-of-tune some lyrics for 20-30 seconds and then stand there uncomfortably until he sees some money. I didn't really have a problem until our last visit. Being that we were on vacation, I didn't have any bills smaller than a $50. We hoped to avoid him, but he was unavoidable. Once he was done singing his 20 second off-key rendition of ""Back home again in Indiana"", we thanked him as he tapped on the money clip on his Accordion. I explained that we appreciated it and we would catch him later in the night once we paid our bill. We got a snide, ""Well I guess we'll just see about that"" back at us. Super awkward and embarrassing moment in front of my wife and others seated near by. Really!? We're here eating $30 plates of spaghetti, do you really think i'm trying to cheat you out of a couple bucks for a tip? We're on vacation and only have large bills/credit cards. Once we paid our bill my wife tracked him down and gave him a tip, but made sure to tell him how disappointing he made our stop.

It wasn't until I read a few reviews on here that I found out I was not alone. We decided we're just going to decline as soon as he steps up to our table if we go back in the future. Though it would be fun to try out some new places and see if he has a song for Madagascar, Bokoro, or somewhere else equally obscure.

I'm not saying I wouldn't recommend this place to someone else, but the accordion guy can suck one. If you try somewhere exotic, post and let me know what he plays.",T1sosuVrATFnPn1sNlwVAA,4,2,3,7MSmuX-5VKocX56bfOKTig

3326206,2009-02-22,6,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"This place is SURREAL.  I strongly recommend you visit it at least once just to experience it.  You'll feel like you're having dinner in the 1960s.  Surprisingly, it's my second dining experience in the last two months that involved time travel.  First, there was the world famous West Shore Diner . . . (http://www.yelp.com/biz/west-shore-diner-lemoyne#hrid:DHBdTFfMrO-QCOqxjxFx1Q), and now - Battista's.  Holy flux capacitor, Batman!

We came here at 5:30 pm last Monday, because my friend had a coupon for a free dinner for two.  Didn't I tell you it helped to know the right people?  The restaurant brags about its ""hole in the wall"" appeal right in its name, although in reality it is much nicer than that.  This restaurant is located directly behind The Barbary Coast, or Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon as it's known today.  Battista's even has its own parking lot - enter on Audrey St off Flamingo Rd.

When you walk inside, you feel like an Applebee's opened a new location inside Abe Lincoln's Log Cabin.  There are so many tchotchkes on the walls, you don't know where to look first.  The gems of their trinket collection, in my humble opinion, were tiny liquor bottles neatly arranged inside a glass cage.  The ""Maximum occupancy: 8,000 people"" and ""Parking for Italians Only"" sign were nothing compared to the sign above the urinals in men's bathroom: ""Your future is in your hands.""

We were seated at a large table with red vinyl chairs and a white tablecloth.  The waiter came by with the menus and waters, although the menu was posted on the wall.  It looks as though it hasn't changed since the 1960s anyway.  You can only get complete dinners here.  You pick your entree, and the rest is included.  The entrees range in price from $20.95 to $31.95, depending on what you choose.  Since our meal was free, I went with the more expensive option of veal parmigiana for $29.95.

You meal includes a salad or a cup of minestrone soup, garlic bread, a side of pasta, a post-meal cappuccino and unlimited house wine, red or white.  ""Hold on a second!  Did he say 'unlimited wine???'""  He sure did.  I don't know anything about wine, but I'd venture a guess it's not the best wine you've ever tasted.  Still, you can't beat the price.  FREE is FREE.

The meal also includes a serenade by a 5' 3'' 75-year-old man with an old accordion.  The serenade is pretty much a must, since there's nothing you can tell him that would stop him from singing it.  Hey, he works for tips.  We weren't on a date, but he still said he had ""something special for the beautiful lady.""  So, I was guilted into paying $2 for a so-horrible-that-it's-funny rendition of:

""When you're smiling, when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you;
When you're laughing, when you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through.""

The food wasn't very good.  I'd say it's Olive Garden quality at Las Vegas prices.  My veal parmigiana was tasteless with loads of cheese on top.  The garlic bread had so much butter, I am surprised it didn't seep right through the basket.  The salad was pretty good, and the cappuccino was delicious.

I'd go there in a second for a free meal.  However, now that I've tried it, I wouldn't rush back.  You have to go at least once though.",Z7PaVxobw44iejw3hR0UoQ,6,6,3,A5KbwRH2_SgPu6MlyOgfxg
3326428,2011-11-28,3,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"For years, DH and I have wanted to visit Battista's when in Vegas.  Finally, on Wednesday, November 23, the day before Thanksgiving, we came to have dinner.  It definitely gets a star for environment.  It's like stepping into Old Vegas.  You expect to see Sinatra and his Rat Pack sitting around the corner.  DH and I commented that our parents would have been right at home in this replica of the 1960s Italian hangout.

We were seated and immediately offered red and white wine.  As the waitress said, ""It's on the house.""  Of course, it's on the house.  It's common red table wine, a bit vinegary for my taste but what the heck!

Immediately, DH said, ""Look at the tablecloth."" I glanced down to see old food stains on the tablecloth.  Don't they wash their table clothes??  Yuck!   Should have gotten up and left right there.

We saw our waitress three times.  When she brought the wine.  When she took our order.  And, when she brought the bill.  The second star goes to the young man who was the bus boy.  He took it upon himself to serve our food and check up on us.  

Now, let's talk food.  Having the menu off the wall was a cute gimmick.  DH ordered the Chicken Cacciatore and I ordered the Manicotti.  His soup was ok but a bit watery with a few veggies floating on it.  I had the salad.  Really liked the dressing that came with it.  A bit strange to see a piece of lunch meat on the top of a green salad, however.

Our entrees came.  Extremely generous portions.  Both of us commented that we could have shared one dish.  DH's chicken had a very interesting sauce on top.  I've never seen an off red sauce on Chicken Cacciatore before. I had a bite and the sauce tasted like it had tons of celery.  DH liked it.  Whatever was placed in front of me was definitely not Manicotti.  Manicotti is a long tube pasta.  I got what looked like a round ravioli filled with way too much ricotta cheese.  We didn't have their dessert drink because it doesn't come decaf.  The nice bus boy brought us decaf coffee instead.  Overall, average food if the prices were low.  But, considering the prices ($20s and $30s), it's outrageously  and inexcusably bad.

Finally, I want to say something about the creepy old man with the accordion.  I know that some people think he's absolutely adorable.  Sorry, I don't share the feeling.  He really made me feel very uncomfortable by leaning into me.  I even told DH to quickly tip him so he could leave us alone.  Thankfully, he never came back for more.

This restaurant has been around for quite some time. The walls are covered with everything you could imagine. Pictures, memorabilia, license plates, street signs, etc. Even the menus are on the walls. 

You get unlimited house wine, soup or salad, bread and a cappuccino with every meal. Please, keep in mind that the wine will not be the best you have ever had. In fact, I think they changed it? Or maybe my taste in wine has evolved since the last time I drank it. The garlic bread is so good! I could have eaten that all night. The salad is large and the dressing is flavorful.

I had the eggplant parmesan and LOVED every part of it. My roommate had the lasagna and ate every bite. The cappuccino at the end taste more like hot chocolate but it's a perfect end cap to a great dinner.

Everything is always fast here. Even the food. For food that is so fresh and delicious, I can't believe how quickly it comes out. The service was great from the host to the waiter.

3388182,2011-05-29,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"1. Overall, a mediocre mix of food and generic experience. It is truly, by all definitions - a tourist trap. One sign of this is that it is only open after 5 pm daily. Literally, a bus or two will come through every evening as far as I can tell. (I am a 36 year resident of Las Vegas.)

2. First, the food. Olive Garden is at least two levels better in quality. My wife and I believe the sauce is simply canned, nothing more or less. The lasagna, again, normal. Any degree of spice or uniquity is simply altogether missing. Strangely enough, the garlic bread was good and so was the expresso - small victories for a higher, mid-level priced dinner.

3. I think the 'never-ending' free wine basically makes many customers happy in lieu of good food. It's normal.

4. The wait was was long - 30 minutes, because of the tour bus. The bar drink we had while waiting was experience.

5. With all due respect, the accordion player with the disability, was playing off of peoples emotions. He would play a few seconds literally, say the same thing to most of the tables in the room - most of it was geared towards how beautiful the female was, everyone would give him money,and then 30 minutes later, the same routine, and same peddling for money. It's not right. We felt pressured to do as the other tables did and give him a few bucks each time.

6. Of all the Italian places to eat in Las Vegas, I would never suggest this place to eat. Fast-food or sit-down are all superior to this. 

7. As I read in another review, it is true that the decor is somewhat interesting with vintage Las Vegas pictures. But does this overcome the shortcomings? No. I am torn between 1 and 2 stars.",k_eKYlkhI11VGzb5RxHmOA,1,0,2,jjAA4v67uFQ2Td49ozTrEw

We got a reservation for two and were seated on time after a short wait (we arrived early)... The ambiance is great... Kind of like what some chains emulate, but true to the name reminded me of some of the authentic hole in the wall spots back in Chicago... Anything feeling authentic in Vegas is a welcome treat.

Wine and garlic bread were brought to the table right away and we ordered shortly after. I got the special - a grilled swordfish over pasta and my wife got the cioppino. We enjoyed the as accordion player (who's been wandering table to table for 33 years!) while eating our soup and salad.  Salad was a petty basic house salad with salami and a hunk of cheese in it. The ministoni soup was really great.  Both our dishes were large and quite good.

The after dinner ""cappuccino"" was nice but not really deserving the name... More like a hot cocoa with a splash of espresso in there. Wasn't bad though.

3444529,2017-03-10,1,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"I would never call this ""haute cuisine"", but if you want a slice of old Vegas, some fun seniors who know how to drink and some good red sauce, then shut up and go to Battista's. I have been there many time over the last XX years (too many), and it's always the same and that's part of the charm and why I will always feel at home. And that's a good feeling in Vegas sometimes.

The cocktails are good, skip the complimentary wine. It'll give you a headache but it works for an expense account and hey, it's part of the deal. We always like to sit in the bar area for at least 30 minutes just to calm down, chat up some old folks and take in the show. It's dark and clubby, TV's on the wall, really old cracked Naugahyde stools and Formica bar tables. No upscale design elements, thank you very much.

The menu is on blackboards all around. Just get what you like and maybe add a meatball. I always get Eggplant Parm and a side of two meatballs. You get pasta included and the iceberg lettuce salad or minestrone. Right? You're with me now, I feel it. I think the gravy/sauce is right on, slightly sweet, tomato-y, thick and rich. Of course the Parmesan cheese is in a little shaker along side the red pepper flakes.

Veal is good, lasagna is wonderful and since I always get the same thing, I can only go by what my colleagues tell me. I think you can get garlic bread instead of the ""white Italian loaf"" that comes with the meal.

If you are a little tired of how hard Vegas tries to be au courant, then relax and go to the Hole in the Wall. Then take a long walk back to your hotel or casino and enjoy the sights with a full belly and a happy countenance!",K0ez3ARiHLHrbazeJAw1rQ,1,0,5,P4H9d09QkHEenuHZ5_ReAw

There's only one dressing. .Italian, that tastes like cheap Wishbone.  The table wine ..burgundy or chablis..both tasted bitter and cheap.

Also included with dinner is soup or salad, and garlic bread. The garlic bread was good, nice and warm. I really liked the dinner salad, but I had to pick some of the stuff out before I could eat it (no lunch meat or unpasteurized cheese), it was perfectly dressed though. The soup was run of the mill, nothing memorable.

I had spaghetti with meat sauce and a side of italian sausage.

Tony and Georgio (GiGi) did a fabulous job making us feel welcomed. 
We ordered lasagna and it was some of best I have ever had.  The salad was refreshing and the garlic bread fresh and yummy. I like the red wine that was on our table. They give you a small cute glass and you drink whatever you would like to have. They put both a carafe of a red and white wine. Very nice touch.

No doubt next time I am in Las Vegas I will be retuning to my favorite new spot!!

Thanks again Tony for your fabulous service!

So good place for groups - but bad because they REFUSE to split checks so bring cash.  Menu is fairly simple and it's like a set menu - you choose an entree, and it comes with salad or soup and garlic bread and cappucino to top it off at the end.  Price varies based on what you order.  People love it here because all meals come with bottomless house wine.  The house wine was eh... I mean, if you're a zinfandel type, you may like it though.  The food itself was eh.  There's an accordian player who comes to each table - I swear he's been there since the restaurant opened.  Cute man, but somewhat annoying because he obviously plays for tips.  And while that's okay, if you don't tip him, he literally taps on your shoulder until you give him money.  I think that's pretty inappropriate. Tips are tips.  Not required. I didn't like that at all... and his cute-ness went away after that!",kNV9dPP9EQod-x0SSVaV5Q,1,0,3,hwV2dnY7MUnWUoyXyZnmmQ

We asked in advanced when making the reservation if separate checks were okay as we are here on business and company policy dictates this... and were told yes separate checks were okay. At the end of our meal they brought out 1 check with the normal additional gratuity added for large parties. Which we expect. When we asked the server for the separate checks he said that they could not do that.  We asked for the manager, who rudely told us no even after we explained the hostess had said it was okay.  She stated that she did not have time to deal with this as she was busy operating the house and walked off. The server was able to accommodate us eventually by running our cards for the individual meals we ordered..  Due to the manager being uncaring  and rude we will never be back again..

at the end of our meal, the server brought everyone a cappucino (comes w/every meal) which tasted like hot cocoa.. and dropped the check. he asked if we had any questions, which i replied ""do u have any desserts?"" and he said why yes, and he mumbled them off real fast... hmmm... that was odd, he shouldve offered some to us before dropping the check, but in his mind was 'get em in, get em out!!' i figured they must re seat the entire room every hour or so.

I live in Vegas, so I have passed by this place more than once. I never actually heard if it was good or not, and never bothered to try it out. 
This past weekend, my aunt and her friends were in town and one of them likes this place and made a reservation for us to eat there before seeing a show. 
I had the option of joining them for dinner or just meeting them at the show...well, I wish I would have just skipped dinner at this place and gone to the show. 
I love Italian food and grew up with real Italian food being cooked by my grandmother.
I really have no idea how some people are giving this place 5 stars. 
I was really confused at the menu--it's posted up on the wall and I had to crane my neck to look at it from my seat so I just settled on spaghetti and meatballs.
The meal comes with a side salad, wine, garlic bread, your entree, and a cappuccino.
The wine was not that good. But I figured since it was included in the price. The white tasted something like grape juice and the red seemed watered down. 
The salad actually made me laugh---1 grape tomato, 1 black olive, 1 piece of salami, 1 chunk (yes, chunk) of cheese, mixed greens, and to be honest, I'm not sure if there was any dressing on it or not.
The bread was okay, nothing special but it was more like slices of toast than what you normally get at a restaurant for garlic bread.
When I got my spaghetti and meatballs, I was disappointed to say the least. The sauce was bland--needed garlic and more seasonings. The meatballs left something to be desired. I got spaghetti and meatballs because it is such a fail-safe dish. I honestly make better spaghetti and meatballs myself. I make my sauce, pasta, and meatballs all from scratch so I know it can be done and be good. This tasted like a TV dinner.
Lastly, the cappuccino. I don't normally drink cappuccinos, so I will be honest and say that I might not be the best critic of this part of the meal, but I feel like it tasted like it came from a mix. It was overly sweet and for some reason made me think of Honey Maid graham crackers. 
Also, during our meal Gollum (perfect description by reviewer below) did come over to play the accordion for us which was more annoying than anything and I did my best not to laugh.
Overall, I wish I just passed on this place and if I want Italian food I will either just make it myself or find a better place even if it is a chain restaurant (sadly, most chains I can think of would have been a better bet).",xb6wXsO1tnH6fX-eVO3_Vg,6,1,1,ompxqJefCH12g8DTVYgSzA

The ambiance in the place was cluttered and cloistering.   I get what they are going for, an obviously have been working on it forever, but the place could really use a sprucing up after all these years...

There are no menus they are just plastered on the walls ...EVERY wall. Entrees run $28 to $38 dollars and include free house wine (which should be a trigger) soup or salad, garlic bread, a pasta side if your entee does not include pasta, and a cup of cappuccino.

Maybe I'm a food snob, but this place needs Kitchen Nightmares called on it!  To start with, the free house wine tasted like grape juice and vinegar and was completely undrinkable. The salad was served overdressed in Italian dressing, which made the lettuce soggy.  This was the oddest salad I'd ever been served.  It included a single black olive, a single grape tomato, one whole pepperoncini, sliced carrots, a huge slice of salami, and a big chunk of cheese.  The ""garlic"" bread did not taste of garlic at all. It just tasted like Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning on really greasy bad bread.  My husband ordered the shrimp scampi and he said that the shrimp was pretty good but the rest was just average. I ordered the chicken parmesan. The pasta side dish with cooked fine and the sauce was not bad. The chicken was cooked properly but the giant hunk of melted mozzarella did nothing to cover up the fact that the breading on the chicken soggy and tasteless.   The topper was the side of creamed spinach... call 1973 they want their side dish back!  Our water was served in plastic cafeteria cups and the cup of cappuccino at the end of the meal was served in a plastic mug.  It tasted like powdered cappuccino mix, but was honestly probably the best part of the meal!

I would give Battista's 1 star for the food but the service was not bad so I'm giving them 2.  What we thought might be a rare gem off the strip turned out to be nothing to write home about...  Don't bother wandering off to a bad part of town looking for good food... stay in your hotel.. there's bound to be better food there!",-UKZIGX3Br7fHFrt0AWYxg,2,0,2,ztqfODcsObGJcBM2VPCjmw

Would I go back? Never, the main course was so bad (chicken alfredo, sauce not to be identified, wife said it tastes of vomit and the meat sauce was anything but Italian). 
Sorry guys, you can do so much better with less and keep the wine and the price and get rid of the corn sirup. 
Classic Vegas???? I would dare challenge that as Vegas has a bit more to offer than a dark ambiance.

3767657,2017-02-27,1,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Went there last night with family. I had always wanted to try the place out because of the nostalgia. It's comfort food, plain and simple. 
I was expecting that for a family type restaurant that has been in the city as long as this one has that the customer service would've been better. Sadly, it wasn't. 
The waiter came to our table and simply asked ""Soup or salad?"" A member of our table had to remind the waiter that he should greet us first, perhaps maybe even welcome us to Battista's before simply bombarding us with ""Soup or salad?"" But that seemed to be the norm for the place. Nonchalant attitudes from everyone there. Like, they could care less that you were there in the first place. 
I'm debating whether to give this place a 1 star, but I have to remind myself it's ""Sunday dinner, at your family's house."" and sometimes family members have bad days. So I'll give 3 stars because I did enjoy my food.

The food was good overall. Delicious garlic bread. The minestrone was tasty, and the italian salad was fresh. I decided to try the special for the day - veal osso bucco. The veal was amazingly tender, but the orzo pasta base was a bit lacking in flavor.

3787571,2017-09-12,1,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Gotta admit, my expectations for the food were really low walking in as a lot of reviews praised this place more for the experience/atmosphere and nostalgia rather than the food.  We were happy that we experienced the best of both tonight. My husband and I are both chefs in Vegas, not judgy up tight chefs, we're pretty easy to please. We got: 

All you can drink red wine: 3/5 
I'm pregnant so I didn't indulge in this part of the meal. I had a couple sips and it was pretty watered down like a boxed wine. But don't get me wrong. If there wasn't a baby in my belly I would have slammed it down. Why not 

House salad- 4/5
I was expecting a run of the mill iceberg salad but was surprised when it came with a sexy mix of lettuces. Dressing is prefect, salad was crunchy and satisfying. 

Garlic bread- 3.5/5 kind of tasted like processed garlic bread. It tastes like they took the garlic and herb seasoning packet you get in Pasta Roni and baked it on the bread with butter. The old college kid in me loves some Pasta Roni so I dug it. Was good to mop up extra dressing from my salad and sauce from my entree. 

Chicken Parmesan- 4/5 
10 oz breaded chicken breast topped w/ melted mozzarella, marinara (I think the marinara might just come from a can, but it was decent) and creamed spinach. They typically serve it with a side of penne marinara but I asked for fettuccine Alfredo ($2.50 up charge)  instead as I knew there would be plenty of marinara already on my plate. Here's a great tip, mix your creamed spinach in with the fettuccine Alfredo, sooooo good! The plate was solid, simple and to the point. Nothing out of the ordinary but it was satisfying for sure. Enough for two people. 

Shrimp scampi- 4/5 
Generous portion of shrimp and pasta, comes with mushrooms and lots of garlic, butter and fresh lemon which gave it a nice zip. I was surprised at how well seasoned and flavorful it was since other reviews  said it was bland. Would definitely order again. 

After dinner ""cappuccino""- 4/5
I'm pretty sure there's no coffee in here, but it was damn good! Tasted like Mexican hot chocolate w/ cinnamon. I love the old school mugs they serve it in too. 

I'm so mad at myself that after living in Vegas for 12 years, this is the first time I've been to Battistas. Will definitely be back.",gUu0uaiU7UEUVIgCdnqPVQ,5,0,5,3b258e_bQs4zHQnm6ZCkug

The best part of the meal is that it includes table wine, salad, bread and cappuccino. Even just off-strip you could expect to pay $20-30 for just an entree, not including any of the extras. The place feels very kitschy and has a lot more character than anywhere else you can go, if that is what you're looking for. 

This particular night I had the veal, which I can't say that I recommend due to its intense saltiness! However, I tried a bite of each other dish--fish ravioli, chicken alfredo, chicken rio, chicken parmesan--and they were all tasty.

3801865,2013-09-14,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"This place was recommended to me by a friend who comes to Vegas frequently, and I was not disappointed. It looks a little shady at first, right next door to a liquor store in a strip mall. But the staff were all very nice, and we were seated right away (at 7 pm on Friday night). 

You can't beat the value- there are tiers to the menu, depending on your entree. I got the ziti with pomodoro sauce, which was the lowest tier at $21.95. The pricier options include steak and veal and can go as high as $38.95. Whatever entree you choose, it comes with house wine, garlic bread, soup or salad, and cappuccino.

The garlic bread was delicious and plentiful (we went through two baskets...there were two of us). The salad was great, surprisingly large and had great leafy greens, not just a bag of iceberg dumped into a bowl. My pomodoro sauce wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either. The cappuccino WAS amazing. So, so good. My mom who doesn't ever drink coffee/espresso tried a sip and we ended up splitting it.

The real attraction is the ambience and the adorable accordion player, Gordy. He found out we were from Missouri and played the Missouri waltz for us! Very sweet and he gives the place a lot of character.

The food is nothing earth-shattering but it's all tasty and you get SO much for the money. Definitely check it out, if only to be serenaded by Gordy.",-cvrhCPCKHUkEsDak_fY4g,1,1,4,f4h21XEswWmnahyDmr532g

Ambience: Very kitschy and dark, lots of old photos and vintage cans, signs & baskets.  Equal parts fun and tacky.

Drinks: Free bottomless house wine.  Not a drinker, but apparently its passable but no memorable.

Service: not friendly, just efficient.  Not super helpful either.

Salad: (included with the meal) 2 stars, boring, lightly vinaigretted greens with a chunk of cheese and a slice of pastrami.

Garlic Bread: (included) Superb, 4 stars.  Warm, fresh, crispy and soft.

Chicken Alfredo (entree): 3 stars. The sauce was fine, the grilled chicken was good.

Filet Mignon: (entree) 1 star.  I eat steak all the time, this was awful: tasteless, under cooked, & dry.  It's hard to mess up a piece of meat but Battistas has done it.  Almost identical to the memorable time I ordered steak at an Applebee's in 2006.  That bad.

Manicotti: (entree) 2 stars, the cheese was fine, but not much taste, and the sauce was pretty boring, kinda sweet.  Just bland overall.

Cappuccino: (included) was really just hot chocolate with whipped cream.  Good, but not what you expect.

Spumoni Dessert: 3 stars, it was tasty layered ice cream.  Can't mess it up, delicious and recommended.

Tiramisu: overstrong flavor, but it looks pretty.  I can't rate it with justice because I don't like tiramisu.  Most at the table did not eat much of it.",b4necRC4ra6rlQFinve3YQ,5,3,2,2WxPGpxtHsMZ4zarSEeQ6w

The all you can drink house red and white were already in carafes on our table and we were ready for more merriment.  Fairly loud restaurant (or maybe we were the ones being loud) that can easily accommodate large groups such as ours.  I'm actually surprised that we weren't kicked out with all the f-bombs that we were dropping.

The food seemed well rehearsed, as the bread came out quickly, as well as, the standard single-serving sides of salad or soup.  Our pasta orders were placed fairly quickly and the meal arrived on room service carts.   The after dinner cappuccino, with a healthy dollop of ""whipped cream"", arrived just as quickly afterwards.  Food is not too spectacular (seemed fairly Costco-y if you know what I mean) but the service was quick and they have a doorman that can take care of your after dinner entertainment.   

Parking lot was right in front of the restaurant and fairly safe despite the look of the neighborhood.  They let me leave my car there, overnight, and it was alright the next day.  

Made reservations and had to put down 10% on a credit card due to our large party size.    ~$32.5 pp including autograt of 20%.  I probably won't go back for the food, but works for large groups, not interested in buffets but interested in drinking copious amounts of cheap wine in plastic cups.

I've gone here with big groups on trips to Vegas before we go out.  Always make reservations if you have large groups!  The place is huge, but usually pretty crowded.  

They have their food menus written on the walls, and they have these meal combinations that include an entree, salad or soup, bread, a hot chocolate type drink, and of course... as much red and white wine as you want!  I believe they range $20-30.  But again I repeat... unlimited wine.

I usually go with the eggplant parmesan, which is delicious.  Cheesy goodness.  Probably a 3.5 star, but gets the job done for a dinner before a night of dancing and drinking.  Other things that friends have ordered just looked okay.

The decorations are kitschy, but that's part of the charm.  The tables are a little crammed together in some areas; this is more a homey, friendly atmosphere than a quiet, romantic restaurant.

I have to preface this with the fact that I wasn't expecting much since my expectations were so low it wasn't hard to exceed them. 

I thought the food was great! I had the fettucino alfredo and it was decent, flavorful and fresh. Was it the best alfredo? No. Was it good, yes. 

This place is more about the ambiance and history. It's an all inclusive price for each meal (ranging from $22 - $40). My dish included all you can drink red and white wine. The red wine was ""meh"" but it was free so no complaints here. Not a fan of white wine so I didn't really enjoy it. 

The salad was surprisingly simple and tasty. The garlic bread was fresh and tasted great. The after dinner cappuccino wasn't very good, super sweet and luke warm. 

All in all, I would recommend this place especially if you're with a group of people. If you want an amazing, fancy dinner this isn't your place.

Fool me twice....

I originally went to Battista's around 2006, when I first moved to Vegas and had heard about how it was this awesome old Italian joint. Ok, checked it out. But the food sucked. I'm no chef, and I remember walking out of there thinking, ""I could have made better ravioli than that! And it wasn't even cheap!"" I vowed never to go back.

Fast forward to 2015. I read a glowing review of Battista's from Rick Moonen in the LV Weekly, and thought, ""maybe they've changed the food!"" We were in the area a couple weeks ago and decided to return, give it another chance.

The inside still has that cool mob hangout feel and there's an old guy walking around playing an accordion. That's why they get the 2nd star.

Overview for those who haven't been: everybody orders a ""dinner"" which comes with entrée, soup or salad, garlic bread, unlimited house wine, and coffee. If you choose not to order an entrée, you still have to pay for a dinner: $19 since you could be cheating and drinking out of somebody else's baby wine glass of $3 wine (what they serve is on par with 2 buck chuck, no question).

I wouldn't even care about the weird setup if the food was actually good. The salad (a handful of lettuce with a piece of salami and shredded carrots on top) came out about the time the words ""I'll have the salad"" were coming out of my mouth. Soup was fine for minestrone. Where they really failed was the entrée. I asked the waiter what was their signature dish, but he seemed baffled by the question, and instead asked, ""you mean something you can't get anywhere else? That's the chicken rio."" Ok fine, I'll take the chicken rio. It's chicken and pasta in a white sauce. Only the chicken is blobby and the white sauce isn't really sauce. More like straight heavy cream they poured on the plate. It seriously has no taste, just a fatty consistency. 

My original review stands: I could make better Italian food at home. Or purchase it at Fresh & Easy and heat it up. And it would be 10 times better. I honestly think they paid Rick Moonen to write that review. Or maybe he got some special food?

Because the pricing was inclusive (hers $28; mine $32), the hit wasn't bad. But the quality was middling, at best. If we return, I'll look for something (perhaps lasagne?) more in their wheelhouse. But we'll likely just skip this in the future.",ft-Lu2Uvymc_rgFUBg-VVg,0,0,3,jaHqRJDoRHTFtWIufJY-Gw

The server was extremely nice and pretty attentive, especially for such a large group. The salad and garlic bread were both pretty good. I wish I had tried the minestrone soup, it looked yummy and my friend seemed to like it. Then my entree came and I was pretty disappointed. I chose the cannelloni with meat and definitely would have preferred something else. There was a weird cream sauce on half of it, luckily the other half had the normal red sauce. Still, the filling wasn't very good and I only ate a little bit of it, opting for more garlic bread to fill me up instead. 

Some of the girls did like their food. After trying some of their choices, it was better than mine, but I still wouldn't be likely to recommend Battista's based on the food. 

So what about the all you can drink wine? Well...along with everything else, it was mediocre. If we had visited our first night rather than our last, maybe we would have been more into the wine. 

Overall, if you're not expecting much, go for it. It doesn't hurt to try once, especially if you're up for drinking a lot of average wine and eating unremarkable Italian food for not a bad price.

And all it took to get me here was a cousin visiting from another state who heard about it from her customers there. For shame. Nevertheless, we came here tonight to celebrate our birthdays. Our birthdays are just a couple of days (and 11 years) apart. So it was a mutual dinner celebration. She likes to make a bigger deal than I do so she wore a birthday sash. Almost as soon as we were seated the little old man who plays the accordion came by to play for us. He ended up playing Happy Birthday (twice throughout our dinner). That was a real treat.

The menu here is not extensive. And it is broken down by price. That is to say each price point has a handfull of options to choose from. There were five of us tonight. Three lasagnas were ordered. One chicken alfredo. I ordered eggplant parm. 

Aside from the entrees, we were also served our choice of soup or salad. Its hot out so most of us ordered salad. It was a good salad too. Basically an anitpasti salad with meats, cheese, olives and pepperoncinis with a tangy Italian dressing. Standard but good. The minestrone looked good too but I did not try that. 

Also on the table for our enjoyment was garlic bread and wine. Both red and white wines. They were both house wines and nothing spectacular but they come with the meal. I can live with that. I enjoyed the red more than the white. I usually do. The garlic bread was crisp and buttery. Garlic bread done right.

My eggplant parm was of a generous portion. Several slices of fried and layered goodness topped with sauce and a lot of cheese. It came served with a side of penne and marinara. The lasagnas and chicken alfredo looked good too. Again, generous portions. They all had left overs. Me, being the fatso I am, did not. 

Finally, to cap off our already fantastic dinner, we were brough capuccino. Really more of a rich hot chocolate. Its a bit warm in August to be drinking a hot beverage on top of a filling meal but it sure was good. We all agreed it was about the best hot chocolate we had ever had.

This place may be called Battista's Hole In The Wall but it really is not. The place is huge. Deceptively so. It is dimly lit and full of kitch. There is a certain amount of retro charm that just feels right. Now that I have been here I want to come back. I want to share this with other members of my family. It was more than just dinner.

First and foremost, the ambiance is way cool. I love all the trinkets hanging from the ceiling, the showcase of all the mini-alcohol bottles, the signs on the walls, etc. It is a tad bit dark, but it is called a ""hole in the wall"", and I feel like it fits perfectly. Think Buca Di Beppo, but way more authentic and awesome looking. 

Second, the staff is/are really nice and helpful. Our waiter was very informative, patient, and efficient with his service. There's also a sweet older gentleman that walks around playing the accordian at each table--and he takes requests! 

Third, the food is amazing. We were informed by our waiter that it does take awhile to make and get your food because they do take their time and ensure that everything is done correctly and deliciously. The food was indeed awesome. We are big garlic lovers, so to us, even the (unlimited) garlic bread was pristine. What was very cool about this place is that literally everything is included in the price of your meal--unlimited red and white house wine (Burgundy and Chablis) carafes,  garlic bread, your choice of soup or salad, and a delicious cappucino to finish the meal. I was sold on the fact that I could essentially have my own personal carafe of red wine since no one else at our table drank.

Good: 
- the garlic bread
- the waiter (Doug) was polite and nice 
- unlimited red and white wine 

Bad:
- the salad was terrible, way too much lime juice was added to it. It was inedible. 
- the vegetable minestrone soup is made from beef broth. The server didn't mention it until we specifically asked. Why call it vegetable soup if it isn't vegetarian?? 
- the capacino served at the end is diabetic inducing. It has way too much sugar. How about not adding sugar and giving it on the side?

Ugly:
- the clam pasta had 5 clams each the size of a dime. The pasta sauce (olive oil and garlic) had very little flavour and taste. 
- the vegetarian Pasta (Tomato based sauce) was bland and flavorless. I've had store bought pasta sauce that tasted better. 
-the lighting in the restaurant is horrid. It's a mix of dark yellow and orange. At first we didn't mind it, but as we spent more time in the restaurant, we started getting headaches. And we couldn't enjoy whatever little taste the food had.

Seriously, living in Las Vegas, you could eat 3 meals, plus 2 snacks a day- everyday for a year and NOT even make a dent in the places available to you.

We lived in Summerlin for a couple of years and Battista's was really a restaurant I enjoyed, we ate here about once a month (maybe twice) and I preferred an early dinner seating. I could go on and on about the decor and cool stuff everywhere, but it's the food I am Yelping and decor is not something you eat. I was just crazy about the garlic bread here, not sure what they do, but I have not found a restaurant that makes it the same way as Battista's, it is delicious and perfect in it's simplicity. 

I know it sounds cheesy and all, but dunking this bread into my bowl of Minestrone soup just made me happy, I also asked for the salad because I love my crunchies and the salad here is crisp and tasty. Hubby likes the chicken parm dish and the NY Steak. I am about the veal dishes and the shrimp w/garlic butter, again, soppin' up the sauces with that garlic bread, I couldn't have been happier, except for that the red wine which is included in the meal and lets face it, wine and Italian food just go hand in hand. Service was quick, friendly and attentive and the many times we went when I was pregnant with our daughter (I didn't drink wine), the servers checked on us, but just let us be, to enjoy our dinner together.

However, after his suggestion, the wife and I gave it a shot. First, its not the best Italian food in Las Vegas..but it has the best atmosphere by far. When you eat at BHIW you will be taken back to a time when the mafia had more control than the giant corporations. The pictures on the wall include all sorts of famous people, and each little dining area has a bit of a different feel. The menu is basic, and written up on the wall. Dinner is an all inclusive deal, with soup, salad, bread, entree, ALL YOU CARE TO DRINK HOUSE WINE and a cappuccino. The price is higher than other places, but you have to pay a little for the authenticity and proximity to the Strip...as well as the free wine. I've never had anything bad here, and it has become a favorite of my very picky family. The wine isn't the best, but its included! My favorite dish is the manicotti, but I don't dig the spinach that comes with it. 

The atmosphere is also improved by a little old Italian man who plays the accordion. For a few dollars he will play you a tune. Some people may think this is creepy, but I think its charming.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,1,1,4,aKp-8bVDJdU863SLPrtU6g

Unlimited wine was a hit with our crew, and our waiter Gerson kept it flowing. He was such a professional with all of our special request, hopefully he waits on you when you visit!

I also need more wine too!!!

Yes if you are looking for that in Vegas, then you will find both here. And honestly we do need more of thesr things in the shadow of Sin City to have a good time. 

The name here is cute but it is not really a whole in the wall.  It's not a dive restaurant. It just happens to be a restaurant off the strip and hidden behind the Flamingo Hilton/Barbary Coast Casinos. 

You will find a wait here. In fact, make a reservation if you can.  This place is simple.  Order a meal and for a fixed price you get salad, main course, cappuccino and all you can drink wine. It is a deal. 

I've had many memorable dinners here.  One of my favorites was with my wife, who happened to be my girlfriend at the time. We had a great meal and the carafe's of wine were flying off the table. Honestly by the time we left here, I'm not even sure we ate food. That was the wine talking. Long story short we ended up at the Bellagio with a private concert with Wyclef John. I am going to give Battista's and there bottomless wine the credit here. We must have looked like a fun couple standing in front of the dancing waters.  My words of advice...fun things happen to people having fun!

Okay back to Battista's...the food is not going to win any awards.  It is just basic old school Vegas Italian. If your looking for a 5 star reality show winner chef experience then go somewhere else. This place is about having fun. 

I've also had a few work dinners here too and we've had some great times. I attribute that to the wine again. The wine sitting on the table is hard for anyone to resist it. So people who normally don't drink will pour themselves a few wines and why not because its on the house. 

I want to mention the accordion player because it is big part of this place.  He is so cute but all he wants is that dollar or two.  He walks from table to table working the whole room. He probably makes a $100,000 per year. I remember once he walked up to our table.  Asked me, ""Where you from kid?"". I said, ""Chicago"". And he jumped in and started playing the song, Chicago by Sinatra.  And when he finished the song he threw out his hand like gimme 5 but he didn't want my hand slapping his unless there was a green bill in it.  This is a novelty here and I think it keeps people coming back for more. 

So if your looking for something different from the usual Vegas Strip drama, then I highly recommend you check this place out. It is a fun time and if your not having fun, then have some more wine!",CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,18,13,4,F8nv_mlmIkigvOoBFyMV8g

Came in about 545 pm and checked in with the hostess. She advised us of an hour wait since we didn't have a reservation so we decided to put our names on the list and have a drink at the bar. 
The place was not busy, in my opinion. A few people at the bar and what looked like several open tables. I decided to check OpenTable.com just for kicks. I was super surprised to see 6:00pm available as accepting reservations. 
What the heck, why not? I filled out the reservation request and it confirmed us as having a reservation for 2 @ 6pm. 
My husband approached the hostess at 550 to ""check in"" for our reservation. Immediately, they brought us to ""our table"". Seriously? The hostess was beyond annoyed. I've got a hungry husband, don't think I'm beyond using my OpenTable expertise to our advantage. 
Our server Ryan was very sweet and efficient, even when his section was bustling. 
Husband ordered spaghetti with meat sauce. Holy herbs and spices! A little overboard but still edible, I suppose.
I ordered cheese manicotti. It was definitely only ""okay"". Very bland- a vast difference from the overwhelming flavor (and not in a great way) of the spaghetti. 
So what was good? Can't go wrong with three free wine!  In all seriousness, the bread was delicious, as was Husband's salad and the to-die-for cappuccino.

I was very disappointed in the food as well as the lay out of the seating, when they seat you you are basically sitting with the table next to you in like a small room, I didn't get to witness the little hi who goes around playing music but I doubt that would of change my opinion about the place, the food was ok, nothing impressive, I had a steak that I honestly felt like I could of cooked it in my back yard and thrown some sauce on it. You get complimentary house wine but trust me no one is going there for the wine, my girlfriend who loves wine had to have her wine with water after every drink she took ( never seen anyone do that before ) so yeah the wine, not good. The coffee at the end was ok but again no one is going there just for that, I also felt everything was over priced but it makes sense because they really are charging you for their "" complimentary "" wine and coffee, at the end of the night I was disappointed but was happy I tried it because it's one of those Las Vegas things you have to do, I wouldn't go back or recommend it but if you are one those people who just has to cross it off your things to do in Las Vegas list then go for it.",ozRmur_LnSmuzr1mI70mxQ,0,0,2,tkQbAZg_myDj-AlhDrViNQ

They serve it with a side of some green stuff I couldn't make out what is was. Maybe spinach. Tasted like dirt. It also came with a side of pasta. Under cooked. I tried my wives pasta, it to was under cooked.

All I need is mildly decent service and pretty good, inexpensive food. This place didn't even come close to that. It was seriously laughable. 

For starters, there isn't a normal menu. It's this weird small menu stuck to the wall that is crazy overpriced and the food wasn't even mildly decent to justify it. You have to order an entree dish and it comes with garlic bread, soup or salad, some pasta dish, a coffee, and a complimentary glass of red or white wine. No a la carte or appetizers possible. 

Our waiter was the most socially awkward person ever. He didn't make eye contact and would walk away from our table as we were placing our orders. We would start talking to him and he'd start walking away from the table every time mid-conversation like he had somewhere else really important to be and he couldn't be bothered with us.

I kind of feel like we were on the show boiling point from
MTV. We kept expecting someone to pop out with a camera telling us it was all a huge joke. It was that uncomfortable. When we finally got our food, our waiter forgot our complimentary wine and when we asked if he was going to bring it he stared aimlessly over our heads and responded saying yeah, like he was really confused and then finally brought it over. We also asked for bottled water and he brought us a carafe of tap water when we specifically asked for bottled water.  Also, even if you aren't eating, if you have a bite of someone else's food they charge you $13.... Wtf is that?

There was a 70 year old man who came to each table serenading you with his accordion hoping for a tip which was just so sad and awkward. It made us feel so uncomfortable especially when he finished and none of us had cash. So weird. We just wanted to eat real quick, no serenade needed. The food was nothing special either. My boyfriend ordered the meatball dish and asked our waiter to have his meatballs cut into smaller pieces and they came in full form. So clearly the waiter didn't listen to his request at all. Also, we never received any side pasta dish like the menu said you would get with your entree. (Not like we wanted it anyways with how horrible the food quality was).

 I've lived out here five years and heard this place was a legend. Maybe once it was a good place to eat but you really gotta hate money and food to go here. Overpriced. Tasted like tv dinner but worse. Can't stress how bad it is. ""Cappicuino"" is actually some powdered sugar coffee drink like nescafe with whip cream. The bring like 20 on a cart and just let them sit until people are done eating. Salad had sliced up lunch meat, flavorless shredded cheese and some sour dressing.

Meal took turn for the worse when a scary old man the size of a child with accordion comes uncomfortably close to us, party of three. Says creepily ""I have the perfect song for 3 guys."" Proceeds to play ""take me out to the ball game"" and replaces the word peanuts with penis. Super weird. Just not the right time at all for that kind of humor. Wanted to leave right there. Should have; we were there to eat not have some creepy old dude talk about penis while we eat. I am not offended by it specifically it's just in really poor taste. Kids within earshot. He made sure to get really close in to our space when he said penis; as if we didn't get it.  He ends the song obviously expecting a tip. Says ""thank you guys so much"" three or four times but in an insincere way. I have a tip; stop making sexually awkward jokes like that with strangers in your place of business so they don't out you on the internet. I have seen other posters say he is the owner. 

If so you're put on notice; your restaurant sucks. Your food sucks. You suck. Your wait staff is solid; that's about it. Didn't even try your garbage wine. Your restaurant is selling nostalgia and a lot of crap on the walls. 

Hostess and server were both attentive and polite. Swear they both knew the food was crap and were embarrassed for us. Fat tip left for staff. Other than that please do not support this business. They are ripping people off with their low quality food and that old guy is a creep.  

I'll never understand all these positive reviews. Spend the $$ and go to maggiano's. Or just go the grocery store and get some Stouffer's. Both are better options especially since you won't have some strange old goon pretending to play the accordion and making bad jokes while you eat. 

Just can't possibly imagine how low someone's standards have to be to give this place a positive food review. It's terrible especially at the price point of about  minimum of 40 per person after tip. Really some of the worst food I have ever eaten in my life. Could not finish anything served from the salad to the ""cappicuino.""

Anyone giving this 5 stars for food quality is either lying for some reason or is absolutely unqualified to judge the quality of food. Just absolutely shocking to me than anyone with $40 dollars to spend on dinner could possibly find this acceptable. It's terrible. Do not go here.",UTQPv-mWOdEnNtI5T2nnRw,0,0,1,2DaIMn8r8vgO6NRfixKdtw

As a fan of Italian food and wine, I wanted to see if it was any good here. I went with a group of 6 or so on a Friday night and there was a wait of 45 minutes. Once seated, we were offered house white and red wine. Average wine of course, nothing special. Since it was busy, it took a while for our food to come out but we didn't mind as we had wine to preoccupy us.

The ambiance is warm and cozy, the place pretty dimly lit (view pictures to see).

4462394,2009-03-15,2,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"AMBIANCE:

Eclectic, casual and fun. It starts with the stuffed moose head over the receptionist's station dubbed, ""Moose-olini"" and spreads to the walls filled with tiny airline-sized bottles of booze, pictures of celebrities and anything else one can think of except the kitchen sink. Who knows everything that is stuck in the ceiling. I was almost afraid to look. One thing I am sure of--it's all been there for a very long time.

ENTERTAINMENT:

A tiny, wizened, ancient little man who is seemingly dwarfed by his big accordion. He comes around every half hour for about two minutes, plays very badly (in a ""it's so bad it's great"" sort of way), panders shamelessly for tips and then disappears (probably to get oxygen and rebuild his strength for another two minute appearance a half hour later).

CONCEPT:

Charge double the value for run-of-the-mill Italian meals that are posted on a board and then try to compensate with free vino by the carafe. In a similar vein to Olive Garden, you can stuff yourself with unlimited garlic bread too. If you drink enough wine and chow down on the garlic bread, you'll enjoy the accordion serenades, go away full, and really not care about the quality of the meal and the price tag. If you're with good friends, it probably will be an enjoyable experience.

OUR EXPERIENCE:

We walked over to this little hole in the wall before a Penn and Teller show based on our concierge's recommendation. We drank the ""free"" wine, ate a lot of garlic bread, sang a lot of ""Happy Birthday's"" to various folks in the room, listened to the little old man butcher ""O Sole Mio"", and ate pasta dishes. I ordered linguini chopped clams in a white sauce for $26.95. The other dishes were all priced in the mid-twenties. My clams and linguini were of the $11.95 caliber. The wine was simply bad.

In summary, Battista's must have a very good working concept to stay in business for over 3 decades. That concept just doesn't work for me. I'd even recommend the place for those in a Monty Pythonish mood and looking for ""something completely different."" If this is the case, just go in with the right expectations which shouldn't be centered around their culinary excellence.

Battista's was the only recommendation by our excellent concierge that I don't heartily endorse.",3q-JsCIOag6nlZaXRLNa4g,3,2,2,MsdpO9Kb8eC1f5VPgnr_Bg

We had reservations and despite the extreme amount of people at the door we were seated right away, which I loved. Thank you for observing a reservation!!

As the other reviews mention, you get for the price of your dinner, unlimited wine, bread, a dinner salad or soup, entrée, and cappuccino. 

The wine was of course cheap and not anything close to what you would get at another restaurant that charges by the glass or bottle.... but seriously, its unlimited and free???
if you expected a good quality free wine in Las Vegas.... You also thought you were going to win at the casino, right??

The garlic bread was good... Salad was okay (no choice of dressing, house dressing or nothing)
I had the spaghetti and meatballs.... ugh.... pick something else... this was so bland and tasteless. 
I really wish I had tried another entrée!!

I would call this ""meat and potatoes"" Italian.   If you are looking for high end, delicate/innovative italian, this isn't it. This is old school italian.   It reminds me of what my grandmother used to make.  Stated another way, this isn't the  high end italian you would find in New York or San Francisco but it is eons above what you would find at Olive Garden.

I can tell a lot about a restaurant by the salad and dressing they serve.  So many restaurants in Las Vegas serve iceberg and drown it in gloppy dressing.   This restaurant  used a variety of greens and didn't drown the lettuce with an inch of dressing - good first start.

Service was friendly and prompt.   Server recommended the lasagna, and it was excellent..  They don't use cheap cheese here either.  And, unlike some of the other reviewers, I enjoyed their red sauce.  

Wine was fine - reminded me of some hole in the wall italian restaurants in Rome I found myself in a couple of decades ago.   If you are a wine connoisseur and belong to three wine clubs in Sonoma, you are going to have issues, but for standard table wine, it was fine.  

In sum, I would say good value for the money.   Efficient and friendly service, solid food, with quality ingredients.  For a strip restaurant, I didn't feel it was over priced, nor did I feel like I was eating at a chain restaurant.  We'll be back.

I made a reservation for 6:30 p.m.. The hostess who took the reservation was apathetic at best. She didn't repeat back the information on the telephone to ensure that the time and name were correct, she just said, ""Yup.""

Upon arrival to the restaurant the hostess who showed us to her seat just motioned for us to go to our seat  and did not specify which seat. She should have just walked us to  a row, containing six different tables to show which table specifically, but instead she rudely pointed and had us guess which table she referenced. Seriously? ! 

 We waited 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us, and when I asked whether or not a worker who walked by was our server, he simply replied, ""NOPE! "" in the most apathetic fashion possible.

At this point in time, my better half went to speak to the manager regarding the atrocious service we'd received thusly. The manager simply stated, ""Well, I've never had any complaints about him before, all I don't know what to tell you."" 

I continued to wait for water/acknowledgement from our server who had already walked by me 3 times without so much as a ""hello, I'll be right with you."" 

At that time I requested to speak with the manager ""Doug"" myself. I explained the situation that no one at the restaurant seemed to have any interest in providing any level of satisfactory service, and he simply shrugged it off and said, ""Well, I hope it gets better."" Instead of taking ownership of the problem and asking how he could MAKE things better, he apathetically walked away and did nothing.

At this point in time we had lost our appetites and our desire to dine at a restaurant who simply didn't care about the quality of service they provide. This is level of laziness is  usually reflected in the food as well.

""Doug"" watched us walk out without any concern for losing our business, and I guarantee that I will NOT be back. As a professionally trained chef, I do not go out for the great food as much as the service, as I can create any dish I desire in my own gourmet kitchen.

This place is completely unacceptable any longer. This was my 6th and final visit to this restaurant. I used to recommend this place time and again to all of my friends who visit this fine city. I am flabbergasted that a city built on hospitality could have an entire restaurant full of staff who just simply doesn't care about their customers. Obviously they learned it from their manager Doug. These things always start at the top.

Lasagna was rather tasteless and way too tomato-ey, whist the linguine was extremely salty and just too overpowering on the fish side.
Cappuccino - delicious but basically a cup of sugar.
Cannot complain about the service. However, I do feel let down after having looked forward to trying the place out following recommendations from friends.

On both of these visits, I am pretty sure that I did a whole lot more drinking than eating, and my memory is that the food was good, if not downright tasty.

When we went back to Las Vegas, I figured that we had to visit Battista's again, so we stopped by - with the same friend who was married on our last visit.  As it turned out, none of us really drank (other than to taste the wine that still flows freely).  We found out that it's really pretty bad.  Sure, it is included, but the reason for that is that it's just not very good.

The food portions don't seem to be as large as I remember, though the prices haven't really changed that much.  All-in-all, it brings to mind that old saying ""you can't go back again"".",62GNFh5FySkA3MbrQmnqvg,0,0,3,S2aTr3An_9EVknrHRE1NZg

BAD SERVICE. BAD FOOD. BAD MANAGEMENT.  

So, we order the chicken parm and spaghetti with meatballs. It comes out and my chicken is dry and sauce tastes like they put all the garlic they could find in it so they could cover the can taste. My bfs  meatball was  ice cold in the middle. We both ate about 2 bites then stopped eating and waited for our server. 

And we waited... 
 
And we waited ...

And we waited...

Finally 15 mins later he comes over and brings the check. Didn't even notice that we didn't eat our food until I spoke up and asked for a manager.  He got kind of insulted when I said we had been there multiple times  before and have never had such a bad experience. He got loud and said ""Oh so what, the food is just horrible?!"" So I responded ""well I wouldn't say it that way.. but yes"". 

He scoops our $100 off the table with the check then comes back 5 mins later and says ""The manager took off your entrees but charged you the cover charge of $13 each. So you got more than half off."" Throws down the change and walks away. 

No apology from the server and Manager never even came over. 

We paid $28 (after tax) for food we didn't eat. Which comes down to us basically paying $28 for water and bread since we don't drink alcohol so we don't drink the ""free wine""",WQv6zHBlSy_zMX3pZaq01w,2,1,1,k3829bLQHte_H9J78inagQ

Ambiance and service was good.

The bad:

We had the linguini chopped clams, sausage cacciatore and meat lasagna 

Linguini chopped clams:
Bland bland bland. You can barely taste the clam and it's also very soggy. The serving bowl was also unappealing. It was placed on a stainless steel bowl

Sausage cacciatore:
The sauce itself was ok. A little on the bland side. The sausage was a different story. It has a weird taste. It tasted like they tossed a whole bunch or herbs and hoped for the best. 

Meat lasagna:
Pretty average. Nothing special. Taste like lasagna from other Italian restaurant

The ""free"" wine is a NO for me. 
It taste like red wine as if it was bought from the dollar store.

Cappuccino was ok I guess. A little on the sweet side.

The price didnt reflect the quality of the food. 
$30 + for overpriced cafeteria tasting Italian food.

First off we had to wait for a table for 30 minutes in a half empty restaurant! 

What's that about? Some sort of marketing ploy to make people think they were doing better then they are?

They winded up giving us a tiny booth in the back of the place in a dark corner where we could not even read the menu! Super depressing.

Now, Let's start with the food. 

First off, the bread. YUCK! The place used to give you really good italian bread and now you get cheap supermarket italian bread that is called ""garlic bread. It's looks to be greased up with cheap margarine and topped with way too much parmesan cheese to disguise the cheapness of the bread! We had to send it back! It was gross! As the saying goes, you can always tell a meal by the bread!

The next course was the salad. It looked and tasted like it had been sitting for a week. The lettuce was all wilted and brown and they tried to disguise it with extra croutons and (again) that same parmesan cheese. It was one of the worse salads I have had in my life!

For the main course I had eggplant parmesan!  It looked and tasted like 3 day old fried eggplant, and was chewy and flavorless. I wonder if it was fried in canola oil, which is a GMO.
That would explain why it tasted so bad! 

My partner had the chicken parm. It was barely cooked and tasted like cheap fake plastic chicken that you would get in some fast food joint. Definitely not quality food.

We left most of our dinner, paid the $75 bill and walked out. 

It had to be the worse meal we both ever had! And will never return!  

When we got home we both got so sick from the little that we did eat. We believe it may have been food poisoning or way too many GMO's being used in the cheap food!  

The place is not the same!  Something happened to it! Maybe new management, maybe new ownership! They are cutting corners big time! And in the end, it will be this restaurant's demise!

It's a darn shame, because this place is part of Las Vegas nostalgia. They just want to be a tourist trap now. Forget the locals! They want to get them in and don't care if they come back!

The service was so fast I was stunned. Now the food:

I ordered the Chicken Parm, which came with free unlimited house wine (red and white, both quite good), soup or salad (I got the salad, kind of a cross between a regular Italian salad and antipasto; it had lettuce and dressing and olives and also salami and pepperoncini), a pasta side, garlic bread, and cappuccino.

4878826,2016-03-07,2,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"I grew up in Las Vegas and have heard about this place for many years. My brother is a huge fan. We had so much hope and expectations. There was an hour wait but it was Saturday so that's expected and we anticipated the food being great so we stuck it out. We were really really disappointed.

Pros: Old school style, big portions, very cool (but busy/tacky) decor, real mob family type motif which was cool. Menu was on the wall and very simple, which is convenient.

Cons: Food. We didn't have a single good dish. Mozz sticks were not hot, and the outside crust was ""homemade"" but tasted like stale cardboard. The salads were Hurricane Katrina flooded with dressing, I like dressing, but dang the lettuce was floating! The free wine was very watered down, but what do you expect for free? We had Lasagna, one of my favorite dishes at every Italian restaurant, and Ravioli. The sauce is absolutely gross; It tasted like canned tomato paste, and not even the good kind. The sauce was so bad, I only ate about 1/4 of the Lasagna and that was a struggle. The raviolis weren't bad if you scraped off all the tomato paste. A good sauce is like one of the main guarantees you can expect at a good Italian place. For the sauce to be THAT bad, it was just utterly shocking.

We will not be eating here again or giving them another chance. Unless they come out with some sort of press release saying they've completely overhauled their sauce recipe.",w5bnlvDwF-vhsA6ENqxQAA,2,1,2,uBspDTQQ5o_Qzk8xpVXkJQ
4880596,2017-02-24,1,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Perhaps the WORST ""Italian"" restaurant in which I've ever eaten.
* Dark and noisy.
* Ridiculously expensive - the cheapest dish was in the neighborhood of $30 AND there's something like a $15 fee for sharing
* Portions are small
* Food is tasteless and uninspiring
* ""Wine"" that was probably watered down - we joked that it was either a) old grape juice that had fermented slightly, or b) colored water that they showed a picture of a wine bottle to and told it ""you're not the wine they want...you're the wine they need""

On the + side:
* the little dude wandering around and playing accordion was hilarious.
* the bread was good

Never going back there again.  This is a hole in the wall that should be spackled over, sanded, painted, and then set on fire to collect the insurance money.  Because that kind of thing NEVER happens in Italian restaurants.",hW_HLHqc4N59mYnV7oq9ww,2,0,1,tc96gL92Q-wSYdnCTWyx-Q

An hour wait on a Wednesday night at 8pm. That shows you how hoppin it is. I had Chicken Parmesan with spaghetti - $28.00 (That came with a side of spinach). The chicken was HUGE!  And for me to carry food home, it must have been big. Before your meal, they serve you you get a choice of soup or salad (I got the salad, yes it was amazing), including the most delicious garlic bread ever (puts olive garden to SHAME), and for dessert included a cappuccino. I'm not a fan of cappuccino's but it tasted just like chocolate milk, I couldn't even taste the coffee-ness.

Like I said, it's unfortunate I live a 5-hour plane ride away. But when I'm back.. I'll be sure to spend money there, again! Next time I'll be smart enough to call in for a reservation.

The menu and ordering system is a little confusing. Supposedly it's family style, with large plates, but then we were told the plates would really only feed about 2 people so we should order one thing for every two people in the group. But there was something about a minimum order charge or split plate charge -- I can't remember but it wasn't explained to us very well. 
Either way, the salads and soups were good (each person gets their choice of one or the other), and the food was good too. Nothing spectacular and nothing stood out enough for me to remember specifically, but it was good enough to please a crowd. Probably the best part was the ""Cappucino,"" which was really more like a hot chocolate than anything else.

Here's the thing, if this place was in a little town in the middle of nowhere, I'd say okay but it's just off the strip in Vegas. The culinary capital of the world people. There are at least 100 superb restaurants within a mile radius, so WHY would you ever go here??? lol but people do and my guess is, they're tourists and they don't know any better. I can pretty much guarantee if you are a local you would never ever choose to go here! 
The place was packed! We had to wait over an hour, which didn't bother me because there was plenty of seating. The atmosphere is kinda cool but there are plenty of restaurants with that type of atmosphere/decor. The service was not very good. My friends raviolis came out ice cold. I had the chicken parmigiana, it was okay, kinda bland - nothing special. The ""free wine"" (I use the term free very loosely since I paid $28 for a piece of chicken - I'm sure the price of that nasty free wine was compensated for with the overpriced piece of chicken) was disgusting....the red smelled and tasted like red wine vinegar and the white wine was warm - yes white wine warm!? There was spinach that accompanied my chicken that as soon as I took a bite I wanted to spit out....but of course didn't. It was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. I sat and tried to figure out this distinct (overwhelming) flavor in the spinach and when the server came over I asked her if anise was in the spinach. She looked at me in surprise and said you're the only person that has ever guessed what's in that. She said people either love it or they tell her to get it off their plate. I'm guessing the former group is a small group, so I'm wondering why they serve it? Oh gawd it was gross. Black licorice flavored mushy over cooked spinach.....not my idea of good food. Sorry but if you're planning on going, I'd say go across the street to McDonald's and save yourself some money......seriously!

and a mishmash kitschy decor of a Chotchkie's apron with flair, 
the place is oddly perfect for a romantic date night, 
a family dinner that pleases everyone, 
or a raucous party (the endless wine helps). 

The portions are huge and yummy.  
My lasagna was so cheesy it was like queso fundino with sauce.  
My wife's cannelloni was a bucket of fresh ricotta wrapped in a pasta blanket. 
 My sister's sausage (wasn't that a CBS show?) was yum.  
We ate for a long time and it looked like we never started.  
Make sure your room has a fridge.  
And we ended up with uneaten garlic bread.  
Who doesn't finish off a basket of garlic bread?  
I mean, besides the Lost Boys. 

Oh, and personally I'm glad the endless wine isn't super awesome wine. 
I don't like wine, but this stuff was slightly watery and slightly flat 
so I was able to throw it down.

Hey, here comes Gordy, the accordion player!  
He's like a mariachi band only it's one guy, I understand the words, 
and I don't shrink in my seat when he comes by.  
Keep a fiver in your pocket to give him - 
the guy will need a second hip soon.

The service is great, too.  I didn't like much my minestrone soup. 
 It had, like, every vegetable in it.  
I could point out so many it was like a Richard Scarry book.  
So I asked if I could get the salad (mmm with a slice of salami) instead.  
""No problem!""   
Can we get more garlic bread?  
""Sure, please make room for a shoebox size basket of garlic bread"".  
Hey, since this wine is endless, can I leave my car here?  
""Please do.  Would you like us to fill it with garlic bread?""

It's not a matter of being cheap its quantity.  This is why I am so-so on this place because the food was ok in my opinion.  My wife thought it was good.  We got the eggplant parmigiana.

One last note.  There is a $13 charge for the additional person that doesn't order a meal in addition to the cost of the plate but you get a salad/soup and all the wine and garlic bread.

Located off Flamingo and the Linq, Battista's Hole in the Wall has all the character of an old school Italian restaurant. The entryway makes you feel like you're in a giant wine barrel, and the area by the host stand is a feast for the eyes. From floor to ceiling, Battista's is lined with interesting tid bits and knick-knacks (like an extensive collection of mini liquor bottles!). Lighting is dim and like any good Italian joint, patrons are greeted with the sound of raucous laughter and conversation. Reservations are a must - we arrived on a Tuesday evening with reservations at 8PM. We were lucky to find parking in the crowded lot. Amid the hustle and bustle, we ended up being seated at 8:15PM. 

CHEESE MANICOTTI ($25.95): Like all meals on the menu, this entree comes with a salad or minestrone soup, garlic bread, unlimited house red and white wine, and a cappuccino at meal's end. I opted for the salad as my starter, which was heavily dressed in Italian and had sparse toppings (1 olive, 1 slice of mozzarella, 1 sweet pepper, etc.). Though lacking creativity, the salad was fine. The accompanying garlic bread was warm, fresh, and delicious. The manicotti was served with a side of creamed spinach, which helped to break up the overwhelming amount of cheese on the manicotti. Instead of being served in wine glasses, guests are provided with small shot-like glasses to use for the wine. Kind of odd, but after a few glasses I cared not. The cappuccino was a sweet treat that I enjoyed every second of. 4/5

CHICKEN RIO ($29.95): ""Superb"" according to my husband. He said the sauce was quite similar to jagerschnitzel sauce. Served with a side of shredded zucchini. He'd order the same thing again! He didn't leave a speck of food left on the plate and was so full he couldn't drink any more wine. 5/5

SERVICE: Food came out quickly and in order. The waitress was a bit over flirtatious but she took care of us overall.     

Worth a Return Visit?
On the whole, I rather enjoyed my meal. I wouldn't order the manicotti again, but will definitely come back to order another menu item at Battista's. For an Italian meal with Vegas panache, you can't beat the deal Battista's offers. Dinner for two cost $60 pre-tip, a bargain for Strip prices.

Restaurant can get pretty busy (30-45 minute wait), but no prob, just pop on over to Stage Door next door for a quick drink. Mamasan (the best bartender ever) gave us a $10 off coupon. Thanks!

5291375,2017-12-05,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"An interesting style restaurant for special occasions.

Environment: Just as the name suggests, the restaurant itself is a hole in the wall. Right off the strip near the LINQ, the restaurant could be easy to miss from the outside. The interior, however is fashioned to have several different sections of the restaurants, with the tables and booths being sectioned off into little nooks of the restaurant. Additionally, the designing of the restaurant is nice. There are plenty of wall decorations as well as mirrors, painting, figurines, etc. to give the restaurant a more casual, homey feel.

Food: The style of ordering is a little peculiar in that it is a cross between traditional ordering and buffet style. Complimentary bread, soup, salad, and wine is given with any one entrée ordered, for one person, and for each other person, they either must also order an entrée or pay a flat price of $13. Between four of us we were not sure which would be a better deal, order 4 entrees (which seemed like a little much) or just pay the $13. In the end, we just decided since we are already paying we might as well get another entrée even if it means potentially just boxing it up and taking it home. Our speculations were correct and by the end of the meal we had plenty of leftovers. We tried the linguini and clams, the lasagna, the chicken parmigiana, and the spaghetti and meatballs. Everything was tasty although I would not say any one thing particularly stood out to me. The garlic bread was very good though.

Service: Our server was very accommodating in walking us through the process of ordering and suggesting courses of action for us to take since all of us had never been here before. Additionally, he was very good about refilling our water and especially with making sure that our carafes of wine were always full.

Overall, this is the type of restraint I could only see myself going for certain occasions, however it was a fun experience and I can see why this is a classic place to go on the Las Vegas Strip.",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,0,1,4,xHx54wNUqhANGAhnm7I62Q
5291887,2009-08-24,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Yelpers, I love ya, I really used your feedback to plan my latest trip to Vegas.  So take it from me, this place sucks.

We were staying at Bally's, upgraded to a great suite, having a great time.  Also having fun finding the best low-cost meals (see Ellis Island and Gold Coast reviews).  But we had a hankering for Italian and the restaurant inside the Bally's (for which we had scored 1/2 price coupons) was closed (!).  We had seen Battista's on our way to Ellis Island, and decided to try it, despite not-so-stellar reviews.

The outside is ugly, but the inside atmosphere isn't bad, typically Italian, pictures on the wall, old menus, photos of old Vegas, whatever.  Oddly, fishing nets on the ceiling -- did this used to be a fish joint?  Impossible to know.

Now one of the problems with this place is -- entrees are expensive.  But, that's because salad and hosue wine are included.  Big deal.  We order, and the waitress asks us if we want red or white.  Me -- white, wife -- red. So she brings two full carafes!  We barely drank 1/10 of each -- there goes most of our money.  The wine wasn't that good, BTW.

Then the fabled little man with the accordion stops by.  Seriously, he is old and bent over.  It's like having Gollum come to your table to play music.  To be honest, he wasn't as creepy or disturbing as we feared, given previous reviews, but he definitely plays a few moments of a tune and then wants a tip.  I gave him three bucks and thankfully he went away permenently.

Then we got our food.  I got fettucine alfredo with chicken, and I did not like it.  It tasted like the kind you would get from Sbarro (a place we had considered) -- not cheesy enough.  Admittedly, the wife really liked her eggplant parmesan.  But I almost immediately started feeling sick.  We got the check, and hopped the monorail to the tropicana to see Bobby Slayton, but by then I was feeling pretty bad and we ended up skipping the show.  We didn't care -- Slayton was a cheap ticket and just a way to fill time. 

But as far as Battista's goes -- I don't recommend it.  There must be better opportunities.

We had 5 woman and couldn't decide how to order.  The bus boy who helped us seemed confused that we were asking.  Maybe people could figure it out, ha ha, but we couldn't.

Next, I take my first sip of the fabled bottomless wine. I can only describe the taste as a combination of the cheapest jug wine mixed with grape juice - not only sweet but also dimensionless and nearly non alcoholic. I try both red and white, they are identical.

Salad=overdressed lettuce, single huge slice of salami, single solid chunk of mystery white cheese, intermittent shaved carrots/cherry tomato/olive.
Entrees=too salty and acidic tomato sauces with no other flavor, boiled chicken that is also overcooked and tough, and vegetables that have been accompanied by a healthy portion of water onto my plate.

5322475,2015-01-04,12,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"What a waste of $60. Seriously, I rarely pay that much for a meal out per person and this was spent on the blandest most subpar Italian experience of my life.

Let me break it down list style.

1. Menu is limited. Think In-N-Style. You select an item and it comes with: unlimited red/white wine, soup or salad, garlic bread, and a dessert cappuccino (aka a hot chocolate). $24.95 - $49.95 per person, based on meal option.

2. Since a friend and I arrived an hour early, we waited at the bar, I ordered a diet coke and she a beer, and two apps: fried mozzarella & fried zucchini. Total: $34 The fried cheese and zucchini weren't anything special and we're $9.95 a piece and we're just average.

3. Once our full party arrived, I learned I couldn't transfer my diet coke to the table, which was annoying. Our orders placed, soup, salad, garlic bread, and wine came to the table quickly.


4. Since it was late (9:45 PM & they close at 10:30 PM), our table was seated in the only room with other patrons. It was packed and loud and we all felt squishy.

5. My friend and her sister split the Veal Marsala ($31.95). It cost them an extra $13 for splitting a plate (because you get those included extras) The veal was overcooked and rubbery. I ordered the Steak Pizzaiola, which is basically a large piece of meat with marinara served with a side of garlic cream spinach. The steak was the blandest, least flavorful slab of meat, ever. The tomato sauce (calling it marinara would be a grave misjustice  to Italians everywhere) was also lackluster. Price point for this disaster $28.95. These two entrees came with a side of ziti and more of that tomato sauce.

6. Lastly, the check came and so did the post meal cappuccino which tasted like a hot chocolate. This stuff was delicious. Rich, chocolatey and creamy. Nothing reminiscent of a cappuccino, not a hint of frothy milk.

The service was weak, the food was tasteless, and prices were gauged. Don't eat here. You'll be full, but you'll feel like you were just ripped off.

First off, I would like to state that the reviews that talk about the portions being small are not true, the wine tasting like grape juice or that it is has been watered down not true and that the food does not taste authentic this is also not true.

When you step into this building you immediately travel to Old Vegas, yes the price is not cheap but it's not over the top either for the overall experience.  Please keep in mind when you dine here, you are truly having an experience, it is such a treat.  You can be serenaded by an older gentleman with an accordion, he played a Disney tune for my children.

Food: Now the food.  We did not have the wine but have on previous visits, it is just your typical cheap wine not bad for all you can drink red and white built into the price.  We had the spaghetti and meatballs, the lasagna, Hubby had the chicken picante and a rather large portion of ravioli off the kids menu.  Hands down the red sauce is authentic and very addicting!  The portions are large, we took food home.  Every meal comes with all you can drink wine or non alcoholic beverage, soup or salad, delicious garlic bread, the main entree and cappuccino to finish.  My kids absolutely love this place, it makes them feel fancy!

Service: Needs a little work, not that they aren't efficient but could definitely be more warm to what they are trying to accomplish.  The Manager was seen walking around helping seat, table touching and greeting guests, this is a plus in my book and very much appreciated.  Now the hostess needs to be addressed.  When I called to make reservations she was a bit rough as well as hard to understand.  Seeing her in person I now see why because she talks with the phone away from her face and is quite gruff, wouldn't hurt for her to smile and thank the patrons.  Really it just seems like she hates her job.

We were told to make a reservation in advance, but a party of 3 came in without one and was seated within 5 minutes. I assume weekends are crazier than a weekday [when we went].",kKezjz-EAfLG2y-GXWV_Gw,1,1,4,TrOZ44t7xKKePCS6bKjZqg

Battista's is all about its convenient location to the Strip and all the stuff you get with your meal.

Your entree comes with a soup or salad, cappucino, garlic bread and UNLIMITED wine!  The cappucino is delicious in my opinion, a great way to end the meal.  

I've had the spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parm and ziti w meat sauce.  I will recommend that you stick with the meatballs / meat sauce.  The chicken parm is not worth the extra 5 bucks or whatever.  It is good but not high tier for chicken parms.  The meat sauce is definitely above average, along with the meatballs.

Some people here say it is too expensive.  Sure, I can go down to South Las Vegas and get unlimited wine and beer from Studio B at the M Resort, but Battista's gets you filled up and full of wine 1 minute from the strip.  It is right behind the Flamingo.  

I milk it a bit, take a while to order while I enjoy the wine.  I get my money's worth.

We arrived a bit early for our reservation, so we went to the bar to grab a drink.  The drink was nice and strong, but I suspect they do that so you don't complain about anything else.

I ordered a cake to be delivered, which it did.  I had to ask the host if it had arrived, even though days earlier, they said they would make a note of it in our reservation.

The wait staff barely said 5 words to us.  Seemed like they were being forced to work under sweat shop conditions or had no grasp of the English language.  No idea, they never communicated to us.

The accordion player was a 90 year old man who did the same ""act"" to everyone.  I felt bad for him.  Being as that I had ordered a cake for a birthday, you would have expected him to sing happy birthday.  So sad. So much potential, but it fell flat on its face. 

The garlic bread was soggy and old.  The salad was drenched in so much vinegar and oil.  The lasagne and other dish we ordered was very bland and lacked flavor.  You could tell they just made a bunch of food ahead of time and just reheated it.

I had to track down someone to find out when the cake was going to come, since we had finished our dinner.  It finally came, after we were about to leave.

As the wait staff, who still has not spoken more than a few words to us, cleared our table, the waiter dumped a full glass of water into my crotch.  He handed me towels.  No apology whatsoever.  

I thought this would be a fun, quirky place to celebrate a birthday.  BIG MISTAKE!

Oh, they let you take your wine from your table in Styrofoam glasses...classy...

This truly is a HOLE IN THE WALL...

We went as a large group and ordered apps including fried ravioli, fried zucchini, calamari, meatballs and fried cheesesticks.  I was surprised that the apps were not hot, but it seemed they were luke warm at best.
Then I ordered the cioppino.  Although it was full of various pieces of seafood, it was bleh.  The fish was overcooked and did not taste fresh.  The broth was a thick mush of slurry tomatoes - it was odd.
The person I was sitting next to ordered the ""catch of the day"" and had the blackened swordfish.  It was burnt and as thick as dvd container.  He said it was the worst fish he has ever had - I believe him.

Let's keep everything in perspective.  It's a $25 meal, all-you-can-drink wine included, a 2-minute walk from the strip.  And you get what you pay for in Vegas, just like everywhere else.  With that in mind:

The highlights:  

- The food isn't Gordon Ramsay quality, but it's not bad either.  The lasagna is better than a lot of restaurants I've had, and the Chicken Rio is worth trying.  Tons of garlic bread helps to soak up the wine so you can still do enough math to leave a tip.

- The wine isn't really that great.  But I'm usually hammered from gambling and drinking all day, so it's not like I'm looking for a $50 bottle anyway.  It's definitely quantity over quality here, but you're not going to even notice it after you polish off the first bottle.

- The service is average to above average.  I've never had a problem there.

- RESERVATIONS.  It's usually crowded, so save yourself a long wait and call ahead.  

- The atmosphere is laid back and old school Vegas.  It's dark, there's stuff all over the walls.  Whoever decorated this place probably isn't even allowed in the Venetian, but it's a nice change from most upscale strip restaurants.

- Pay the old accordion player to play you a song.  He doesn't look like he'll be around a whole lot longer.  

Once, I didn't want to leave half a bottle of wine (can't waste that stuff, you know), so I asked for a to-go cup.  They gave me one, no questions asked.

It came with cream of spinach and the portion was also really big. You will be full no matter what you get here. Plus the wine is unlimited!

5573792,2012-01-27,1,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"The atypical Italian Restaurant, huge portions, wine, checkered tablecloths, wine bottle centerpiece holding a candle. 

When last in Vegas, my friend John had said he came here a few years earlier and raved about the white clam sauce. He mentioned at least a pound of succulent little morsels of clams over a full pound of linguini. It was our last night in Vegas, and frankly, I was sick of buffets.

We arrived, and if I hadn't been shown how to find this place I would have never found it, It literally is a hole in the wall. But when you enter the place is a full sized eatery. It's like Bucca De Beppo without the clutter. 

Our waiter arrived just seconds after being seated, dressed in black pants and a white shirt, slicked back hair, looking around, all the waiters looked like clones of each other. With him were two carafes of wine, red and white. Then he expertly explained the daily specials, including an eggplant lasagna that sounded amazing. But I had my heart set on this amazing linguini with white clam sauce. John ordered the eggplant lasagna, and I ordered the Linguini, and we said we'd share since the portions were so huge. John also got a meatball.

We sat a bit talking about our success at the blackjack table and how we were always so close on the Roulette table. I had a good day at the sports book, picking the Steelers over the Browns (duh) and picking the rams and teasing them with Buffalo. So yeah, I was picking up the tab. Not bad wine for being free. Garlic bread was delivered, nice and cheesy, garlic out the wahzoo! Very good indeed.

Our waiter arrived with two HUGE, oversized bowls, one containing my linguini, the other the eggplant lasagna. and two smaller plates for us to share. (no extra charge for sharing!) Can I say I come from a big Italian family, I saw my father eat healthy amounts of pasta at one setting, but I had never seen a bowl of linguini with clams as big as this for one person. I even said to the waiter ""are you sure this is mine and not for a table of four?"" He assured me this was a single serving. I swear it was over a pound of pasta and a pound of clams. Fresh grated Ramono cheese was dusted over the top, and plenty of cracked pepper. He even left the cheese grater and a healthy block of cheese at the table for us to help ourselves.

The pasta was perfectly al dente, a bit of bite and wonderful flavor from the clams. The clams were very tender, meaty and succulent. John's Eggplant Lasagna was very dense, flavorful, but a bit greasy from frying the eggplant. There was a lot of different cheeses used, I could taste ricotta, Parm, Romano, and a smokey cheese, maybe Provolone? Aside from the grease, it was delicious, rich and tasty. The meatball was very dense, stuffed with all kinds of fresh herbs and garlic. It was easily six ounces.

Battista's is a great place in a great city, after you've had your fill of buffets and quick bites, go have a wonderful sit down meal at an Italian restaurant that does it right.",UsmTxWbobLsI6WR1Db0W7A,9,3,4,JcRxtFtULCU15iCTEWoVMA

Bloated prices and quite frankly mediocre food have reduced what was once a must see for visitors to a place to avoid.  Even the portions are shrinking.  We started with the garlic bread which was stale and had almost no garlic flavor.  The salad was what i call a lazy salad.  It was essentially lettuce and some fillers and instead of shredding or chopping the cheese and unidentifiable salami like substance, they simply put a block of cheese on the salad and one round piece of salami.  Clearly a chef who takes no pride in what leaves the kitchen.  The kids got a small bowl of ravioli for 13.95 which was boring.  The adult menu starts at 24.95 with a high price over $30.00. I tried the chicken parm.  It was ok but the chicken was not moist and the sauce watery.  The side of ziti was  flavorless.  The spaghetti and meatballs were ok but the meatballs were overly dense.  

All in all a disappointing meal.  I used to recommend this place to out of town guests but no longer.  It also appears that they raised their prices when the High Roller arrived which makes this place no longer an affordable value.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,8,4,2,Lae4qLaqvxrejBZ7ySi7KQ

5597976,2013-11-14,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.

It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.

Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again.",kYddxyOJD_vELH6Vr_ytyw,1,1,4,Tv87VbmTrCVlGukNUvdAsQ
5598376,2018-06-25,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"The food was good, but my overall experience was subpar. Prices are too high; the lighting (at least in the back corner room near the kitchen) was so low that I wanted to go to sleep; and the lack of customization of your meal choices is a big downside. Each meal comes with house wine, garlic bread, soup/salad, and cappuccino - which probably explains the overly priced plates. However, it felt like we were almost forced into getting all of the extras. For example, besides trying it out, we didn't drink any of the wine - which makes me wonder, how much wine do they waste in a night? Similarly, the cappuccino is served to you whether or not you want it. Some people in our group didn't drink theirs, and I probably would have passed on it too had they even asked us - especially if it would lower the price of the meal!

The biggest area for improvement, though, would have to be the service. Simple things (or what I think is simple or even common sense) like introducing yourself, smiling, and pointing out useful information can go a long way (e.g., the menu is on the wall, but we initially thought it was just part of the decor. It would have been nice if the hostess pointed that out when showing us our table.) Our server was decent and a little more friendly, but he had an assistant (or maybe he was the food runner?) that was uncomfortably awkward. It's hard to put into words what he was doing, but basically, he and the hostess could definitely improve on their customer service skills.

I want to like the restaurant - especially because it seems like it has a lot of history and the main dishes are good. However, I don't think my future visits to Vegas will include going to this hole in the wall place. The staff has plenty room for improvement in their communication and customer service skills.",8SJXJU7DoAl-PA1lnRFCiQ,1,0,3,r30DeRKzgM3dIaP8rP-YkQ

The bar was nice, but not fancy. We did not have a reservation, so it was really nice to sit, at the bar, and have a drink while we waited, for a table. 
I guess since we didn't have a reservation, we got the booth we got; in the corner kind of squeezed behind a booth, and next to a table. 
But, that was fine, since we didn't have to get up too much, since there was no way not to knock into the woman's chair closest, to us. 
The service was friendly. 
They have complimentary house wine, which is a very nice touch. If you are picky I am sure you can buy a bottle, as well. 
There was complimentary garlic bread, too. 
The house salad was really nice. 
The Chicken Parmesan was good, but the spinach was incredible. I could have eaten a huge bowl! There was also a side of pasta. 
The Spumoni dessert was different than I had ever seen. It was like a slice of cake. It was much too cold, and hard. I would have liked it better, if it had sat out for  about 20 minutes. I love Angelo  Brocato's Spumoni, in New Orleans, so I was comparing. 
But, the star of the meal (dare I say, even better than the spinach) was the complimentary cappuccino. It was out of this world.

Seated immediately and were greeted by our service staff.  Wine (red or white) is AWFUL like horrible cheap in a box but worse stuff.  Still, due to someone daring someone else to drink we killed 2 carafes of white and 1/2 of red.  Blech....still tasted bad and it didn't get any better!

Ambiance was OK, not super 'old school Vegas' as others would recommend; however, the wait staff was pleasant and not in a hurry to shuffle us out the door at 10pm when they closed.

The first course included soup or salad, and we mostly got the salad - mixed greens from the bag at the grocery store, complete with bottled dressing and crappy bread.

Food included spag with meat sauce (extra sauce requested and it came on the side, a-plenty), Aurora sauce (not the best, not the worse), Filet of something that basically was Fajitas minus the Tortillas and the fish stew, which had two small halves of tough, chewy crab, shrimp that was equally unappetizing and overcooked, perhaps purchased in bulk at Sam's Club,  

Seriously, the ONE saving grace was the cappuccino - homemade and amazingly wonderful - honestly, the best ever.

So, if you're looking to spend a few $$ for a great after dinner drink come here.  Otherwise, skip it.  Wish someone would have warned us more sternly!

Sure, as the reviews say the entree prices may seem high but when you think you don't need to order anything else I found it was cheaper than going to other restaurants.  I ordered the Chicken Marsala, my husband the Veal Marsala.  It was absolutely wonderful.

5701080,2018-05-08,1,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,Been going to this restaurant for years. It is a staple of Las Vegas. Been here since the 1970s. The accordion player has to be 90-plus years old. We always enjoy this old school type restaurant that offers some pretty darn good Italian food. People on here that say it's frozen stuff from some Supermarket are just over zealous morons. Anybody who says this is not authentic Italian food is just comparing it some sort of chain restaurant that I don't enjoy. I had the cannelloni with meat and my wife had the veal marsala and the veal was very good. It also included garlic bread a soup or salad and cuppocino . It came with complimentary wine which was not a hundred dollar bottle of wine but it was still pretty darn good and very rare to have it included. That is why I like these old school restaurants the way it used to be. It is not all that expensive if you figure what you get for the price of their dinners. Anybody under 30 should probably forget about coming to this place they don't know too much. I am not an elite yelper so I don't meet the criteria for kissing butt.

I am a local looking for favorite little places to put on a 'go to' list when I want a night off the Strip.
ATMOSPHERE: Great, Old Vegas Feel....had me with eager hopes for good food to match....SIGH....
SERVICE: average - with many 'points to the MENU on the wall'.
FOOD: Ok, the menu on the wall brags of 'Free wine (white or red)', 'free soup or salad', 'free garlic bread', 'free sugar/syrup cappuccino' -ALL of this ""free with your meal"".  
The Lowest meal is $21.00 --this for a plate of pasta, sauce and two hard little meatballs.  Humm,  think we are really paying for all this crap.  I'm blonde but not stupid.
OK, IF the food was GOOD-I would pay twice the price for all that 'free stuff'.  But, I think I could get better pasta at one of the cheapest Buffets in town.  The spaghetti and meatball dinner was bad, but the eggplant parm was like a Banquet frozen dinner and I think $24.  hahaha   How do you spell RAGU?  
The wine is watered down cheap red, which I expected.
The garlic bread, was not toasted, but warm and dried out like it sat around in the oven and turned to hard crumbs.
Soup, canned.  Salad, blah. 
I am  totally shocked to see the high stars and great ratings for food.  I guess pasta lovers ...just plain love pasta, no matter how crappy?

Set aside the food and the menu for a second and you still have a terrific vibe. I haven't seen a live polka with accordion since hector was a pup! I could walk around this place for hours just admiring the photos and history. I imagine that this place has stories that would make the Vegas Stories Hall Of Fame!

Once your seated and comfortable, I suggest you start looking around. There's local memorabilia from floor to ceiling. It's worth walking around the halls, just to catch a couple ""oohs"" and ""aahs""!
   We eventually put in our order and the meal started to unfold course by course. The carafe of wine and garlic bread came first and the table got instantly happy. The bread was warm and delicious and with the red wine flowing, the mood started to really lighten up. The salad came out and we started to nosh even more and talk less. It was a standard Italian salad with big chunks of salami. It tasted great and to have garlic bread with Italian salad is an amazing start to a meal. The bread, salad and wine and company were all part of a joyful experience. This polka guy came by and gave us a happy medley to lift our spirits even higher. 
  I order the chicken parm and when it arrived it was cooked through with the texture remaining crisply while the cheese and sauce was still sizzling from the oven. The side of pasta was standard with a simple red sauce. I'm really happy with my choice and even happier with the location and the experience we had.

Living in Las Vegas I can deal with having a crappy restaurant experience and paying too much because sometimes you just don't know or have a choice.  Unfortunately, I had never been here and had a couple of out of town guests who googled Italian food on their phone and this one popped up and was close to their hotel.

I tried to steer them away from this place as restaurants on or near the strip are usually incredibly overpriced and the food is usually at best mediocre.   Well my attempt at steering them to a known commodity did not work.

Battista's it was.

I'm not going to get into details on this place as they have been discussed ad nauseum on Yelp.

The food in this place is not only unpalatable but is probably dangerous.  Chemical tasting food that I can picture being cooked up in large tubs in the back is what this place serves.

The 'wine' they serve is not quite up to the same quality someone on food stamps would buy to use as cooking wine.  Don't get me wrong I don't mind cheap wine but this stuff was not fit to be consumed by humans.

To top it all off they serve a Nescafe Corn Syrupy type chocolate drink at the end.

This place has a cozy ambiance according to other review but that's where the positives end.  This place preys on unsuspecting tourists who don't know any better until it's too late.  I can't imagine anyone ever going back to this place.

This place treats its customers like cattle, well, maybe worse actually.  They could care less about your experience and possible return business since they are located in a spot that see's a few million new visitors each year.  This restaurant wouldn't last 3 months in another city that must rely on return customers and positive word of mouth.

Please people do not go to this awful place with these awful people.  This restaurant represents everything that is wrong with the Las Vegas dining scene.",pHQcEJbsYThyl_861tc8ug,14,8,1,lMkSplIHpr6CkJTk_96U_w

The food is decent. I've had better. I've had worse. The wine is what you would expect unlimited house wine to taste like. Having said that, for twenty something dollars, you can have garlic bread, salad (or Minestrone if you're not into the greens), a heaping bowl of pasta, and cappuccino that sort of tastes like maple syrup infused with chocolate (in an absolutely incredible way). Did I mention the unlimited wine part? You can drink loads and loads of wine here - it's light, and refreshing, and though it's not the best tasting, you get used to it. This place is about an incredible experience. It's about taking a breath of fresh air and enjoying a slow and luxurious dinner, filled with wine and a musician who will come to your table and play you a song (he did a rendition of California - like the older song, not the one from the O.C.). It's not just a dinner - it's an experience - one you'll come away loving. And as a bonus, you may not need to pay for food for another 24 hours because you will be stuffed!

Bonus - two separate people told us we were a cute couple. That's right, people went out of there way to be very nice for absolutely no reason other than to be nice.

To rub it in my face in the end it came to over $70. Olive garden isn't authentic Italian but if you want better quality food I suggest going there or any other Italian place.

I bet back in the day this place was the place to go, you will see  old pictures on the walls. 

When seated you will see The menu is posted up on the wall and is pretty straightforward and  easy to understand. Now how neat is that?
You get unlimited red or white wine. Plus a house salad or minestrone soup and garlic bread. When you choose your entree there are about 5 different price levels ranging from $22 to $40 ~  example spaghetti and meatballs to a steak.One thing nice if you don't order a pasta dish you get a side of penne with marinara sauce. 
You also will get a cup of cappuccino. For the amount of food and drink involved and the quality, it's a pretty good deal for your money. Especially unlimited wine!

Funny story took a friend there and he loves Italian food. Well he also loves wine and loves good Italian bread. He kept drinking and eating tons of bread(The bread is so good!). By the time we were done eating he was so full could barely walk, I think the bread expanded with the wine making him even fuller! He went back to the room and had to lay down for hours! 

Over all this place has been here for years that tells you something! If you like Italian food try this place out. Or if you want to see a piece of old classic Vegas which is disappearing go here

And as a added plus a elderly man walks around with the accordion and serenades the tables. He plays some things by request.  Its a nice added touch ~ if you see him make sure to tip..
Overall its a old favorite of ours ~ One of the first restaurants we ate at when we first came to Vegas! Check it out we highly recommend it!

Food is no where near worth the price of what you pay for it. Basic pasta with canned tomatoe sauce the bread was stale and hard and we could never find our server for anything. The table next to us never got greeted so they it up and left. They give you complementary cappuccino from this machine that taste like hot coco.

We had the STEAK PIZZAIOLA and decided to share it. We were charged an extra $13 for sharing even though we only wanted 1 of everything:(  the pasta was over cooked and the sauce was bland and terrible.  The steak was the worst we have ever had. It tasted like it was made the day before and microwaved before serving it to us.  The wine is cheap crap but even if the best wine was served, it wouldn't make up for the terrible food.  The garlic butter on the bread tasted spoiled.  The ice water that they gave us tasted like sewage water.

But for some this can be a trip to one of Dante's levels; to start, by sitting at the table you become part of a factory-style service with explanations coming at you like an auctioneer, the food is served with efficient repetition and the quality is on par with chain Italian restaurants. That is you can understand and taste the concept of the dish made long ago, but the shortcuts have eviscerated the essence. If you are lactose intolerant--sucks for you. The included wine, garlic bread and cappuccino while nice for some make it too expensive to buy a nice bottle of wine or other sides.

""Super""cocktail waitress Kayla took our drink order and served us from the bar menu, our request. Which consisted of Chianti (me), Moscato (wife). She had the Calamari frit appetizer, I had lasagna (best ever). This was as much food as we could handle Along with some garlic bread and salad, we were very full & happy campers. We've gotta get back soon to listen to the roving accordion player, as we dine Italian style. 
Battistas food is very good, and reasonable. We also loved the old school vibe.

5947773,2016-07-20,0,yNVcnSaMSrTmjJBMrHTy9w,"Yelp lists 2 stars as Meh, I've experienced better and that's the most fitting for Battista's.  

Walking into the ""Old Vegas"" institution I thought this might be a great find, or a mistake, you can say that about many things in Vegas.  I had a glass of wine at the bar before sitting down to get the feel of the place, lots of folks had reservations.  I should have stayed in the bar and ordered there instead of venturing into the dinner fixed price menu.

Service is great, the wait staff is the normal drink and food, union deal you find in Vegas.  Both servers were attentive.

The fixed price menu offers normal Italian fare, which is OK, the salad was OK, the pasta and meatballs were OK, the garlic bread was OK.  I've had better salads, spaghetti, meatballs, and sauce in many places.  Got - it's OK, just OK, not great, or good, just OK.  

The dinner menu includes ""wine"", you get to choose red or white, the waiter said their house wine is a burgundy, I'm thinking something between a drier malbec and a chianti, then I noticed it was refrigerated like a white.  It didn't taste like wine, it tasted more like a MD red, watered down with grape juice and water with a dash of vinegar thrown in for acidity.  I like wine, I'm not a wine snob, but I do know some, this was bad stuff, impressively bad.  I sipped through a full glass of this swill, attempting to determine if it was indeed that bad, and then what one would mix to make such an abomination.  

I don't see how the hole in the wall maintains a 4 star rating on most websites, they must have a small army of very dedicated folks entering great reviews to counter the actual reviews.

If you must eat here, stay at the bar and order a la carte, unless you really want to experience the house wine, if you do venture in to sample this liquid darkness, please post a response and tell me what you think is mixed together to make such a concoction. 

So to summarize - Great service, OK Food, old Vegas atmosphere, incredibly bad house wine.",Aadvfj7CT9x3wEHvszHn2Q,1,0,2,1nfW_MZjJNyVYfq3zZt8ow

I've been here a few times with large groups and it always come down to the group on how I enjoy my visit. 

The food is ok at best. it's simple, not fancy and does come as a full meal with house wine. Let me restate this is nothing fancy, including the wine. What Battista is good for is delivering a good deal. On all of my visits the service was middle of the road. There's nothing special in that area. It's slow but does deliver.

If you have a large party of friends and family who want a deal on mediocre Italian and cheap wine, this is your Hole In The Wall. If you're looking for something more, stick closer to the strip.",-B-QEUESGWHPE_889WJaeg,3,1,3,pAWFd556A5EYUs3gXIAE6w

I had the veal parmigiana and my wife had the chicken parmigiana. I had the salad and my wife had the soup. Both came with garlic bread, house wine, a side of pasta and a capacino. I didn't realize it came with the side of pasta and wanted to order a side of spaghetti, so I was really happy that it came with the meal.

Both dishes and all of the sides tasted great. I don't like wine, but my wife said it was pretty good. Kind of about what you'd expect for a house wine that is included with your meal.

The side to the main course was spinach. I personally don't like spinach, but I did try it. It had good flavors, but I couldn't get past the texture. My wife thought it was good though.

Overall, I was very impressed with Battista's and would happily go back again and will be sure to tell my friends to go there.",XW11B3GhCl31Otx-oOfVkg,0,0,5,cTPSWnaT6A6lrRLtU3V5qQ
