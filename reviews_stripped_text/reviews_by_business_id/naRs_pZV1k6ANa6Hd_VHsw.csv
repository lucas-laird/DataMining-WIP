Perfect for on the go and take back to your room snack.",qZfMILmXeiTGiZQXJ15iBw,0,1,4,4Jgg26MAIeJliGmZTsQNlQ

Overall compared to fast food restaurants it stands well but definitley is too far to be compared to pf chang for example. Pricewise, it was abit expensive , 11$, but ok we are in vegas and everything costs legs and arms. :D",Np0pwf1Tu15gHwvmWQVKiw,0,0,4,VeL-VeyW9Nrzvbuj_UxkvQ

Having stayed at Elara multiple times which has allowed me the ability to walk here in 5 minutes or less, Panda has come in clutch every time I needed food quickly and at an affordable price. Despite being in Miracle Mile, the prices are more or less the same as you would find at any Panda. Food is always fresh and staff is always friendly. I'm always in and out of here very quickly, which is exactly what I'm looking for when I come here.

Bottom line, I know there are better food options in Vegas. Panda is only ever used when I need food quickly. And this is always the case when I come here!",aXuxyyTDs5RGoFrhajPLYg,1,2,4,5IZFahZ6QARQqyibmgO2CQ
2344946,2017-08-22,0,naRs_pZV1k6ANa6Hd_VHsw,"Came in at 11:30, half an hour before closing time. They were out of everything and Richard refused to make anything fresh for the long line of customers they had. I was starving so I just chose some other items that weren't my first choice. Paid $12 for my food only for it to taste like it had been under a heat lamp for 6 hours. Literally tasted so bad I couldn't eat it. When another few girls went up to get food I told them not to waste their money because none of it was fresh. Richard and Melojane stood their behind the counter loudly talking crap about me knowing I was right there and could hear them. Bottom line.... don't waste your money. Go upstairs... McDonalds nuggets are always fresh.",OZQ8rTGhI0Vvy77NHefdLw,1,0,1,vHc59waly7s5AV3AYBGDwQ
2554636,2016-07-20,0,naRs_pZV1k6ANa6Hd_VHsw,"Had dinner at this Panda. I always enjoy their food, but had a couple of minor issues at this location. The first was the portion was smaller than average, and it left me hungry. Normally I'm stuffed after I eat at Panda, but this one left me a bit hungry. Also, they didn't have any hot and sour soup, which is a favorite of mine. Lastly, the food court was a bit dirty, and the trash can was overflowing. Id go back because it's the cheapest place around and the food is always enjoyable, but this panda is worse than most others.",s_JR9k7NiSzPMcw6e_-RQA,0,0,2,QIb22T_3ef1EsfQaL4fBVQ

3474354,2017-01-05,0,naRs_pZV1k6ANa6Hd_VHsw,Horrible. The quality doesn't compare with other Panda Express places. The cheese wontons were hard and stale. The chowmain didn't have any vegetables and the noodles were hard and cold. I almost tossed it. The furniture  is dirty and cheap and ugly.  I was here 4 years ago and the quality was really bad but I decided to try again since it had been such a long time. Never again.,DpxQMLs-SjzQNMs7sFaTEg,0,0,1,kV5-T2nJJlbpEIAnlbCqdw

They are the only one who works till 2 am in the morning and it's life saver . Price is the same with all other pandas and no parking , you need to walk in or take taxi . Make sure you don't drive cuz it will take you hours to get from parking to here",550gcGIXeM6YouF1ZgHglA,0,0,5,fxfi1xLZA11LngcK1E67lg
5057585,2014-11-25,0,naRs_pZV1k6ANa6Hd_VHsw,"Sometimes I just want Westernized Chinese food that's a little greasy and good.  We went to see a show and didn't want to figure out where to eat so decided to get food at Panda Express and bring back to eat on the dining room in the hotel room.  It was 9PM and there was a short line and seating in the food court.  The woman behind the counter was giving samples of the steak and it was tasty.  

I got the 2 item entree with a side for $8.15.  The side was either a noodle or fried rice and I picked the rice.  For my first item I picked the honey walnut shrimp and was told it was a premium item and would be an extra $1.25 which is fine as it is seafood.  The other item was honey sesame chicken.  They also charged extra for the angus steak that my husband ordered.

The batter on the shrimp was a little thick but tasty.  The green beans in the chicken dish was dried and not good but chicken was good.  Lots of food to fill me up.  Not a place I would frequent if I was a local, but ok once in a while.  The price reasonable too compared to prices I have seen for Chinese fast food places in my hometown.",wfi0T-xq_P5sKQvwQitlYg,0,0,3,yJkeKyWTlSRSl6PvCPWD1w

I am fuming as I am eating my beef and broccoli with fried rice. Apparently it's a huge issue to order a one entree meal instead of two? Sorry I didn't want the bowl cause I don't like my foods touching..... Is that a fricking crime?? I asked very politely but got the eye roll by the entire line of workers. They made such a small request seem like a huge inconvenience. Is it that hard?? Like what is that?!?? Do your fricking job and don't be a bitch people!! What ever happened to customer satisfaction. If the manager is reading this, all those bitches should be fired. Most bizarre and weirdest experience I've ever had.",qyOZssXOpBCTG-wNyb5GcA,3,0,1,5JhwuQQdFP2nEFy42y0R8A

Then, she asked if i want to round up my bill which i again politely refused by saying no thank you. She rounded up my bill for donation. Line was quite long so i just let it go. Last one, i asked for an extra spoon for my daughter which she put in. Guess what she put in the spoon but no other utensils were provided. Legalization sure have its effect...:)",szLoYw96dh14fHmSKxbcOQ,0,0,1,nwi6dyivrGSTLmGM29wKtg

I ordered a meal with vegetables, Orange chicken, Beijing beef and rice. It's not too bad but all is prepared quick and you are not be able to enjoy your foods also, there are too much people in this restaurant (december 2017). Just to calm your belly but not your stress, your digest will be bad.",HAdISaU63tVxeGFbNEvLDw,1,0,1,gR7uGCog-D_l5memA1LRGw
