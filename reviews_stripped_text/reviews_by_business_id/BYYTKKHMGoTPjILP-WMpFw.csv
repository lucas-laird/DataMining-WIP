Run of the mill chinese fast food, but extra greasy.  They don't drain the oil off their fried foods so it puddles at the bottom of the trays so all the food soaks up the oil.

The mongolian barbecue was decent, liked the shrimp.  Not many choices on vegetables though.  And not many choices are sauce, but much more than most in Vegas, at least you can put it in yourself.",KMH0-vcV0atzuNN0LABsRQ,0,0,3,1eOJlIBJAj35Z9-v3dUxEQ

Hubby and I were in Vegas trying to find cheap places to eat, came across china star buffet, the dinner was $8.99 per person, and since it was a buffet I thought it's cheap for 2 both of us ate for under $20. 

There wasn't much to choose from, food overall was dry and salty... The ice cream cones were placed out in the open, I find it unsanitary.. But like I said, you get what you paid for at that place.. The waitress wasn't particularly friendly, so we just paid the bill and left..

But now those items are gone, and there is actually sliced tomatoes and hard boiled eggs available.  The service has gone down also.  You have to ask for things like refills now.

The food was pretty old- I had to spit out a couple bites of my food because they tasted funny or I could not chew it. The ""Mongolian BBQ"" portion was okay though. 

The service was severely lacking- it took asking to get water refills, and the girl at the front desk was a little nasty.

1320989,2013-05-15,0,BYYTKKHMGoTPjILP-WMpFw,"Unfortunately this is not my first time here.  On previous times I've been here the experience has been more than sub-par... but today I couldn't figure out what to eat so I landed here.  Figured there's a banner outside that said under new management so I'd give 'em yet another try.
    On first glance the joint looks glammed up a bit more than on previous trips here.  You know a lil extra decor here, a lil decor there... I end up making my way to an available table, got my drink order in then made my way to the buffet line.  At that exact point I realize my mistake of giving this place another shot.
    I opted for the broccoli beef, bbq pork, general Tsao chicken and some vegetable fried rice.  All except the rice looked fairly unpleasing (like they been left in the tray too long and yet those were their best options).  Got back to my table and dug into the pork and found it was so overdone, it was dry and hard.  The beef was so rubbery, the broccoli way overcooked and dark.  And the rice although good looking was so hard and undercooked that I almost broke teeth and lost a few fillings.  Left that after a few bites, then noticed I'd get some shrimp they had just taken out and figured I'd take advantage of something fresh.  Fresh it was and salty as heck too, making me sip my Pepsi away in two gulps to counter the Salton Sea I had just ingested.
    In all this not a good place to eat.  I've been here 3 times.  As the old saying goes, ""3 strikes and you're out.""  Yes it's under new management, but it must be the same crummy cooks and perhaps the same motto applies to this management of leaving old food in the tray and making it look so unappetizing that they don't care.  They must be rich to not care to make a quality product, scratch that, decent product.
     2 of 5 for their decor and their attentive waiters.  I so wanted to give this place a shot, but alas, fool me three times shame on me...",FaeY4ILFh6r1WpJDWc19Tw,0,0,2,_e6FUNzXWDUfr4vbnilR-A

The service sucked and when I attempted to point out a problem to the cashier (who said he was the manager) he didn't take the complaint seriously. They use dark meat chicken instead of white meat, which by the way tastes absolutely NASTY! The only reason this got one star is because their interior is decent. They up the price on weekends and holidays which isn't worth it. Even the normal price of $9 is a lot for a crappy buffet that serves nasty food. I'll certainly never be returning ever again and I encourage you to not go there either. It's not worth even going.

Why?  Well the buffet items alternate between tasteless and awful.  The meat in the Chinese dishes is stringy and fatty and has random parts of bone in it (at least I hope it was bone.  It might have been a pebble).  It's the kind of buffet where you end up eating only fried food because that feels safer.  And at least there's some taste if the item is fried.

Bottom line: don't get sucked in by the cheap-as-dirt pricing.  Even at rock-bottom buffet pricing, it ain't worth it.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,1,1,1,MupgJtBP_GopkYdKB6WQDg

What I feel it does is fill the stomach after great workout at the gym. NOT all the stuff is blah, average, or no flavor. I had the salt and pepper shrimp got two servings of that yummy. I enjoy the hot and sour soup. It pretty diverse for small buffet in comparison too hotels. They have all the standard ones kung pau chicken, fried rice, and goes on and on. Like said it hit or miss find couple of good ones. Times some maybe not going through as much so it was warm at best. The popular choices they tend not too replace them as quick as the other ones. They have mongolian bbq section pick your protein and some assorted vegetables cook it up for you. I was hunger not feel like waiting but it look good. The food nothing going too wow you but it is WHAT it is cheap chinese buffet food. Ok.

It just changed management so the interior is lot nicer then before. It been while came here for lunch couple of times. The management tell greeted with great smile and sense the enthusiasm like new ownership in the building. Drinks I could not even get it halfway down before server filled it back up. Something that liked compare too hotels the server really on it came too each time went back up came back took old dishes away.

You have to pay extra for drinks, don't ask for water cause its nasty. They don't refill the good stuff, like the oysters and crab. You could be there at least and they won't refill them. I think its more of trick if they don't want to refill them they should just stop serving it cause thats why we are there for. Their egg roll are huge. Mongolian station is pretty good and fast.

Is this the best buffet in all of the world? No.
Is this the best buffet in all of Las Vegas? No.

What it is though, is the best Cheap Eats Chinese-American Food for under $10.

With the recent change to management, means completely new everything. 

New Wait Staff.
New Menu.
New Prices.
New interior decorations.


Wait Staff - I am not sad to see the old wait staff gone. Some of the girls were not the most friendly. The new staff seems to much more helpful, attentive and friendlier.

New Menu - You still get the basics. However, the food has changed in the flavor. There is definitely more pizazz to some of the food items. At lunch the other day, I had deep fried pork ribs, eggplant, fried tofu, baby bok choy and pad thai. All of it decent and pretty tasty.

New Prices - After tax, I paid $8.48 for AYCE lunch buffet. Price increase, but now you get a drink included. Before it was separate price for drink.

New Interior Decorations - I posted some pics and it is definitely more easy on the eye on the inside. 

We went right at 11 am for lunch and they had hot, fresh food out and just kept putting more and more food out. For lunch and the price, they had a pretty good choice. 

Now, I am not saying that this place is going to make your taste buds slap your mouth.

The price is the same whether you eat their buffet or take a small box to-go. Not sure why, since you're obviously going to get a smaller amount of food.
