If I'm craving kare-kare or lumpia sariwa or adobo or pancit or pinakbet or anything else Filipino, I pick up the phone and call Mom or I make it myself. But..... Ito'y Sariling Atin has made me have to rethink this rule of mine. I had lunch there with family yesterday and it was so yummy! Lots of dishes from which to choose. I was craving kare-kare that day so that was my main dish. My eyes wanted to order so many things but one's stomach can only hold so much. They re-offer rice if you still have ulam. One gentleman had ordered the halo-halo special. Topped with mango ice cream it was huge and looked amazing! That will be the first thing I order on my next visit there! For 5 adults, the total price was $42; very reasonable. (Thanks for treating, Auntie.) Highly recommended.",aTl9sD-HRP8mwTn5vd4PXQ,4,4,5,sQBARW-nYrZdu-XYIAYCmg

When I got up to take a piss, he politely asked me if I needed more rice.  Surprised the sh_t out of me  and I told him I didn't need any. He didn't know I was on a low-carb diet, but good that he was there to address my needs.

I got to the bathroom and noticed there wasn't any toilet paper, so I told the filipino dude there was none. Next thing you know he hustled and restocked the TP with the quickness. Im thinking this guy is on Adderol or something, which is good. I gave him a tip when I left, because I never get that kind of attention in Filipino restaurant. 

The decor of the place is above average for any Filipino restaurant.  Its all about presentation, so don't be afraid to bring your non-filipino friends here.",63SbuWbBzeZdGr4f5VS10A,0,1,5,5dt8PbeRQOJRSdE031-TsQ

Some of the food are not worth the price like for instance the chicharon which is mainly full of flour and doesn't taste as good as the price..Staff behind the counter is very sarcastic and was very rude! Also the staff at the counter who's giving the food. We asked if they can give some soup and someone from the staff asked ""how many?"" My mom said for 6 people And the guy who's supposed to be giving the soup said to the other staff: ""anim? Eh ano naman kung anim? Ano gusto mong gawin ko?"" I would understand if its just some private jokes between staff members but for them to make us here that comment.. That was kind of rude..

This is not buffet and went here for breakfast. Found breakfast is $3.99 for any ""silog"" and the amount of food was more than enough. If you are craving anything else, you can order a small size for 3.29 or get there other combo which is not expensive at all.
The server was very polite and social, even though she spoke to me in tagalog and I spoke English back.

2 item combo: ordered the lechon and coconut milk chicken. I thought the lechon was pretty good, the skin was crispy and not chewy, the fat was soft and the meat was pretty tender. I thought the coconut chicken broth was pretty good as well. Unfortunately it was loaded with tiny bone shards and fragments. The rice was slightly over cooked but ok. The soup was ok as well.

So i suggested Hot Dog Haus and the group agreed. Drove over and would you believe it...out of business (scene from Return of the Sith where Vader goes 'NOOOOO' and destroys everything in the room). Buddies suggested Ito'y Sariling Atin so i was like sure.

The place looked fine as we walked in. Not being familiar with this restaurant, our curiosity led us to ask questions about what the different types of dishes that were on the steaming table.

They place her shu-mai on a plate and preceded to microwave it. Each of our order were followed by ""this is delicious"", by the ugly old hag servers.
As we went to the cashier to pay for our food, the cashier tried to sell us drinks, cookies and various desserts. When we sat down the bus boy asked us if we wanted dessert. They were constantly trying to sell us extra items. As we started on our meal all four of us noticed that the food was luke warm. I would think that food should be at least warm to hot or cold as to avoid bacteria. The food was not palatable . The rice was somewhat dry.

First of all let me give you a quick background on me. I am half filipino (from my dad)so I have SOME knowledge about filipino food. The problem is I am also half white and extremely extremely americanized lol. That being said I know the basics of filipino food only from eating at my grandmas house (yummmmmm). However, I cant prononuce anything in tagalog. No accent. By looking at me you cant even tell I am half so obviously coming in they think I'm just some straight up white girl walking into their restaurant. 

When I walked up to order thats when I realized how rude the lady was. She was completely irritated that I was pointing at certain dishes asking what type of meat it is (i can only point out  loganisa, adobo, annddd sinigang). Other than that I  have nooooo idea. She had an attitude problem and all I wanted was some good food. 

So this makes me wonder..... do all customers have to have an accent and know the ins and outs of this type of food to come here???? In order to give good service do I have to bring my grandma along. 

Its not like the lady didnt speak english or didnt understand me. She was just mad that I didnt know what was what. 

Ruuuuuuude!!!!!!!

I would say I would never come back but the only reason this place gets 2 stars is because their halo halo is bomb! I'll come back for that since I know how to say it lol

Food was decent. Prices were slightly too high for the quality and quantity of the dishes. 
 
We ordered 2 rice trays to go boxes of steamed rice. And no it's the Togo boxes your thinking of, the 7x7 box. It was. 3x5 box. Each box was $3.50. I thought that was kinda pricey. Next we got kare kare in a medium container 5.99, and secondly we got caldereta also in medium 5.99. The sizes of the containers looked so small. Like I mentioned earlier portions were small for the price. 

But blehh,food was okay. Nothing screamed ouuuu I have to come back for this.

Worst of all, the overall experience was just ehh. The ladies behind the counter were just  rude. Simple questions were easily not answered, and right before we left we asked for 4 sets of utensils for the food we just purchased and the response of one of the ladies is "" we don't give utensils"", and I said I just saw the lady rolling up utensils in the napkin.

On to the good things, this is a great place to bring someone new to Filipino food. This place is the cleanest compared to the ""other"" Filipino restaurants neighboring the area.

By comparison, this place puts all of the Phoenix area Filipino places to shame. They have a wide selection of choices and the prices are reasonable. My review is based on the American palette as opposed to the Filipino palette.

Their breakfast menu consists of rice, longanisa, and eggs. I'm not really a fan of the breakfast so I nosh on the Turon. Which is a fried banana with jack fruit rolled up to look like a 8-12 inch eggroll.  The Turon is excellent and I always buy a bunch to go. These are $1 each and easily my favorite Breakfast item.

Came here after a long walk on the strip. We called in and asked what time they close. Also checked yelp for good measure. Then when we walked in, the employees were literally closing the place. Few food was still outside but they were scrubbing soap and cleaners on the counter.

As soon as I said ""hi"". The other lady said ""just take out now"". And I was shocked, we still have 45 minutes to eat right? Wrong. And other of the employees said "" you can eat outside if you want"". WHAT? They want us to eat outside when it's literally 40 degrees outside. There are snows in the mountain tops of the nearest mountains in vegas!! And lastly just to put the experience over the top. The other lady jokingly said "" unless you will pay us overtime sir?""... yeap. That just happened.

For a Filipino place that caters for our culture they have negative way of trying to make you ""feel at home"". This place might have good food. But they get zero manners. Not a way to represent the Filipino culture. 

Hope no one ever experience the same thing. And I hope the owner checks the attitude of his workers. If If I own a business, I won't kick people out that way.

One of the good things about this place would be their TFC on a flat screen that the other patrons were enjoying. Other Yelpers might find this cool, which is why I mention it.

Unfortunately, they serve it in a small cup for $2.18 each (after tax).

The reason why I deducted two stars is not only because of their mediocre selection of food, it is also because they have an employee, the male busboy in his 40s I believe, who would not stop staring at me the whole time I was there; it creeped me out so much that I almost got up & left a couple times.

Why? can not think of anything else nor compare it with other places but it just fills and completes my Filipino food palate's needs! 

Pluses: 
This is a  family-friendly, laid-back, fast-food type restaurant. Want to see the interior? see the restaurant's own video on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9ahwcj5mw&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL 
The atmosphere is cordial and conducive to just eating. Sometimes it's filled with diners on peak dining hours and sometimes I dine in with only 2 or three tables occupied. I like that, too, so I can concentrate on my meal and savor it without rushing out (so others can seat and eat on the table I just vacated, so unlike other restaurants). 
There's televisions to watch Filipino programmed shows or sometimes sports is on the monitor. If not, just eat!
It's not hot or cold inside. Guess, it has an A/C and fans swirl around, above from ceiling. Well, I feel comfy while dining, not un-climated.
I have dined in the restaurant when ""Pork Binagoongan"" was on the buffet line (see photos). Other favorites of mine like ""Laing"", ""Pinakbet"", ""Sinigang"", ""Kare-kare"", ""Bicol Express"", ""Ginataan"" are waiting to be had. Well, I stop the enumeration right there because I have many favorites. It could get on and on, including soups and desserts...that said, it would take up so much space here on this page. Any favorites you can think of? Many Filipino food favorites are presented for you to have, to taste. A variety each day. Not the same served on the buffet line everyday. Isn't that exciting? Each time you visit, it ain't the same foods for the day. 
Finely sliced, scrumptious, well-seasoned and deliciously spiced up meals. 
They serve breakfast food. Though my regular choices were simple, my breakfast meal is always delightful of Garlic Fried Rice, a double nice sunny-side up eggs and delectable ""Longanisa"" (sweet and spicy sausage). 
An array of finger food delicacies and packaged candies or mini-desserts for your sweet fixing need. 
For just less than $10, a generous choice of 2 entrees in a combination with a heaping, steaming white rice and a small side of soup is a good deal. There are times I get a really good appetite, an extra serving of rice is given free of charge.
The buffet line staff are friendly, helpful, and cordial. And they serve with an attentive smile. Although the staff is Filipino speaking, English as you all know by now is spoken by most Filipinos.
Food is made fresh daily, hot, and straight from the kitchen.
A ""to-go"" styrofoam box and plastic bag is given when taking home the rest of the meal is an option.
There's a bathroom to wash my hands or peruse it for other purpose, you know what I mean.
Parking space is abundant outside the restaurant. Choose your space.

Un-Plus, but See the Good Side Of It: 
No wait staff if you are looking for someone to attend to you while you eat. It is a fast food restaurant. What did you expect? A tip is not even expected, unless you were really served by one of the staff. 
Just don't expect the same Filipino foods made for each day. The buffet line offers you delectable choices that varies each day. 
Later in the course of the day, the buffet trays are replenished; nevertheless, it's made fresh each time.

Back to Plus: The tables are attended to after the diner(s) leave the table by a cordial cleaning attendant resulting in a nice clean table if the diners before you do not clean up after themselves, you know how some people are.

Overall, I enjoy my meals and ""masarap talaga"" (that means, really tastes good!) Mmmmm! Mmmm! Mmm!

I really like this place because their food makes me nostalgic of my mom's cooking. Of course nothing ever beats what your family makes, but what they have here should suffice!

The interior is quaint, clean, and well-maintained. They definitely have the home-y feel to the place... It's easy to order here, you literally tell them what you want and they make the plate for you. I got the chicken afritada and the lechon kawali.

The chicken afritada was close to how my family makes it when they have potlucks. The chicken was tender and flavorful. You can't go wrong with the sauce from the afritada mixed with your rice!

The lechon kawali wasn't as good as the afritada, though. It was hard to the touch, and a lot of the pieces made it feel like I was chewing on rubber. I think that's forgivable because everything else was pretty great. Honestly, lechon is a hit or miss at some places and I guess they missed the mark here this time.

Despite all the buffets and cheap eats, I guess my family needed to find some home food.  This place is great!  A little over priced (about the price you pay at Goldilocks) but it's worth it.  A 3-entree rice plate set me back around $7 and for my first and only visit here, I had the Chicken BBQ, Chicken Adobo, and Chicken Afretada.  Normally when I eat another Filipino's cooking, I think to myself ""wow this is inferior to my mom's cooking"" but quite honestly, this place measures up!

One of the workers there even offered to give us more rice and sinigang broth while we were eating, which was really nice of them.

Definitely out of two times eating there and a few other cafeteria spots, this is probably the better of what I've tried in the area.

The people who work here are very friendly too. 

This though is great because many of these dishes take so long and I normally dont want to cook it.  I particularly don't live ""very filipino""- I dont have TFC at home, or cook/eat out filipino often or have much flip friends to talk Tagalog with.

The Lechon Kawali was a good meaty version here...not nearly as much fat as the other place I had it at, but the flavor isn't as good here...the benefit of all that fat! It's a catch 22 

The Sisig...a little different than I've had. This was a bit more soupy on the bottom, versus a more dried consistency. Good though...just prefer the dried/more fried version myself.

And of course, the Chicken Adobo...very tasty and flavorful, but there were tiny little splinters of bone that distracted me from loving the dish. They need to sharpen that Butcher's knife! It was fall off the bone tender though, with a strong soy sauce flavor.  I'd skip this personally.

So bang for your buck, this is good food for the money! BUT :

I hit the restroom on the way out, and saw DEAD BUGS on the ground...GROSS! So I told myself, at least they are dead...the pesticides must be working right? But now I am worried and start looking around on the ground...noticed a live one walkin around in the middle of the day.

""This is our very own."" 
That's what the name of this restaurant, Ito'y Sariling Atin, means.  I know because I asked my mom, who was born and raised in the Philippines, unlike me, who was born in Akron, OH, raised in Cerritos, CA, and have parents who didn't teach me Tagalog.  Now you know, too.

As the Halo-Halo Challenge winds down, contender #9 brought us to yet another Filipino fast food place that we've never visited.  One thing Mel and I have learned in this short period of time doing the challenge is that Las Vegas has A LOT of Filipino food restaurants.  We're only going to review ten of them for this go-round, but there are still many beyond that number.  ISA is a ""turo-turo"" style place where you ""point-point"" at the food you want, just like those other places where you line up at the counter and can get two or three-item combos with rice. We didn't have any food, but I thought I'd let you know in case you want to eat here.
We didn't see halo-halo on the menu, but just ordered it anyway, knowing that they did offer it. The lady behind the counter starting speaking to Mel in Tagalog--uh oh.  When this happens and you don't understand what's being said, you just keep answering in English.  She got the message and finally told us that it would take ten minutes.  Oh, okay.  The price here is $5.25 for the icy dessert and theirs had:

Ube ice cream, kaong, azuki, one piece of leche flan, nata de coco, white beans, jam, and chunky ice, again.  What's with the chunky ice?  Challenger #7 also had chunky ice.  I am not a fan of little icebergs in my bowl that I need to stab with my plastic spoon.  
No macapuno, langka, ube, or pinipig in this version.
Other than the chunky ice, this halo-halo is not too shabby.  It's only missing a couple of ingredients that I prefer to make it one of my favorites so far. HALO-HALO+TURO-TURO=YUM-YUM - 9 down, 1 left!

We wish we had a place like this in Maryland! 

They pile on a generous portion of food to fit the entire carryout container. My husband and I got tocino, longanisa, extra egg, fried rice, and sinigang pompano. Devoured it all in less than 10 minutes. Food was so good, we felt like we were back in the Philippines. Lots of options here, and we would have come back for more if we had been in Vegas longer!",BJtawjDT6HBYjbAwyGCk9A,0,0,5,I8lRo4RZDqo0m_c06wk3fw

When I'm missing them and missing their food, this is where I come to fill my void. Though it's nothing compared to mom & dad's cooking, it is still good!!! I've been here a few times and though it's about 40 minutes from my house, it's worth the drive for me!! I get sooo much food for sooo cheap!! They have a huge selection of food options. I really like their sinigang and constantly crave their fried chicken skins (omggg yum) and anything they have is pretty good!! I think I might make a trip there today actually - just writing about it makes me hungry!! haha.",e9wfoS-pYUNrloa6VZBgNw,1,0,4,1x5FkQ7n_WYpxGqAeXdU7w
