Both employees were very gracious in explaining the NV law and offered for us to wait in the foyer if we wanted something to go (which we didn't). A few other reviews mention the smoky atmosphere which it true but again not there fault since that's there decision on how they have licensed there business. Vegas could use a family friendly Stieners because there food is consistently excellent (on all my previous visits).,_vJOnMTXV5fyVkKO1ICO-A,0,0,1,Arb3jd8Sn2OL7KR9kQ8FtQ

169590,2017-02-23,2,jdAdf7keZac1idbgNKG2pw,"First impression: I sat down at the bar which had a not so friendly reminder to not sit at the bar unless your playing max bet and stating you can't ""sit on a $20 bill"" that is what it is, I get it. The bartender came over and brought me a drink promptly  I ordered the chicken fingers as recommended from the bartender. The bar top ""bar buddy"" table adapters are unstable to say the least. After eating one of the 4 fingers, I put a bit too much weight on the front end of the bar buddy and the entire basket of wings, fries, and a hefty amount of ranch dressing came spilling onto my lap/ ground, immediately I felt embarrassingly sober and childish. After I came to terms with what had happened, about a minute passed and someone came over and swept up my nearly untouched basket of goods, to whom I apologized for my mistake. As any normal human would after wiping up the food on my lap, I wondered what's next? Will the bartender say ""Hey man, no sweat I'll get you another one"", or, ""would you like anything else?"" Something I feel is the respectable thing for a dining establishment to do, but after 40 minutes of sitting at the bar and running another $60 through the 4-card keno machine, nothing...NOTHING. Not a single word of the 1/10 of the meal I got to enjoy. I'm not self centered nor do I buy into the strict reality that ""the customer is always right""
I realize I made the mistake, but it really didn't sit right with me that the bartender never said a single word about it, the company I was with commented on the same thoughts that were running through my head.
Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we thought maybe they wouldn't charge for it, maybe half-off, something. But in the end... nope, full price charge, never said a single word the entire time we sat there. 
The food was quite good (for what I got to have) but the complete lack of empathy/ general customer service will assure I will never be attending their establishment again.",fCBEggmYM1g7Cm-knLUr1g,4,0,2,5blFjwWdUKV1L9rzDgEn-g

After waiting until after 7PM so that we could sit at the bar (my wife broke her back as a kid and needs a chair with support), we sat and ordered dinner.  We had already been there an hour when the bartender informed us that we had to move because someone wanted to play the video poker game I was seated at.  Instead of telling this other person to wait for a bit, they caved when she said that we weren't playing and shouldn't be sitting there.  This is poor customer service.  While we love the staff there, and will miss them, we will not be back because it is obvious that gambling revenues are more important than the clientele.",fOnHE75CHXMBSZ4NK7aV6A,4,0,1,jR3hOLmVUWk8rx2n-eGMcw

She recommend the wings which were phenomenal. Also ordered the Kobe burger. Took it home, opened the box and found two ROTTEN tomatoes which smelled worse than organic fertilizer and just as mushy. Took it back to get a new one, where I was told it was normal for that kind of tomato to smell, look, and feel like a decomposed body. This asst manager clearly has no idea what food or customer service looks like. Luckily the GM was there to smooth things over.

Your glass wouldn't be 1/2 way gone and it was refilled. For 7 years we never had a bad experience until recently. We went for breakfast a new waitress was on the morning staff friendly at first but not attentive only greeted us and gave us the check. She didn't even notice we were not eating our breakfast except the toast as the hashbrowns were burned and the eggs were extremely undercooked when we asked for medium. We thought it was just an off day.... Then we went back In last Saturday for dinner around 5:30 fearing we would hit the rush we were surprised how dead it was.... The 3 waitresses saw us come in as we debated where to sit. We waited 15 minutes and no one came to the table. But they all walked past us many times and then were chit chatting at the counter in front of the kitchen laughing.... We decided to leave. As we got up the waitress walked by who saw us come in and said have a good night we turned to her and said you never even waited on us. No apologies or nothing like come back were sorry will take care if you. So we went to timbers were we were greeted right as we walked in and had a waitress at our table less than 30 seconds. 7 years of being loyal customers, we even went on their bus trips, had birthday parties there....

1264266,2014-04-27,0,jdAdf7keZac1idbgNKG2pw,"Steiner's calls itself a ""Nevada-style pub."" But this food is so good that it would work well anywhere.

I have been here a half-dozen times, and I always get the same thing: a small order of the Mediterranean salad with lamb chops. It's basically a souped-up Greek salad topped with three grilled lamb chops. But, man, are those lamb chops tasty! And although you can order the chops by themselves as an appetizer, I think it's a better deal to get them as part of a salad.

My husband had the Cobb salad; the full order was huge, but he nearly ate it all. We each had a large draft beer (Miller Lite for him, and Blue Moon Belgian White for me), and if you're just there to drink, you can't go wrong with their extensive beer menu. It looks like they have a pretty good happy hour, too, and I know several people who like to play video poker here and at the sister location down the street.

It's funny I don't come to Steiner's more often; maybe that's because it's not that close to my house, so it's not in the front of my mind. But I like this place well enough that I'm going to try to remember to stop in next time I'm in the mood for some good bar food. And maybe next time I'll try something else off the menu: a burger, perhaps. Or maybe the Cuban sandwich... (Naw. Why mess with a good thing? See you later, lamb chops!)",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,1,0,4,98-qcumwFrjT4UjmCbx59A

Lot of reasons am fan of Steiners not only cause of the food, Best Happy Hour in Vegas, tons of television for sports entertainment, great service, and one of the few sports bars non casino has the NHL package. Just for the NHL package worth star all its own. 

I came for some Thursday night football with my roommate and some NHL games (specifically see my roommates Rangers). I surprise packed the place was considering was Thursday. Not sure if always that busy cause we barely found spot at the bar too hang out. MLB playoffs going on, NFL, College football, and NHL full night of sports on. More into the drinking mood. We did get HUGE pretzel too munch on with our beers. It was pretty good! The presentation is one of those WOW just because of the size of it. The pretzel was nice moist, hot, and warm from the first piece break off. Choosing the best way take it down that story for another time. It came with three different dipping sauces. Whole grain, honey mustard, and darker one (really out of the three least favorite; not distinct flavor, looked burnt, not very good). I have had food here before mostly the sandwiches and really not had bad one. 

The beer selection is Huge its whole another menu by itself. The best part is Happy Hour ALL THE DRINKS  are two for one whether big or smaller draft or even bottle beers. It covers the world from micro brews both coasts, craft beers from all over the world, ciders they have vast selection too choose from, and always adding new ones so am sure there beer for any beer lover! Me! Me! Happy Hours 5-7. 

Sports bar this is the place just cause the way they have the televisions set up from the ones above the bar area. This area like best in the middle of the restaurant (same set up as the others) row of bar stools, bar tables, and on one side decent size widescreen main games on and both sides smaller televisions. Look at the other side up in the corner two more smaller television. Most part different game going on all of them. Depending busy you can ask them change the games. Your own personnel sportsbook!! NHL package just like the NHL is game that not everyone fan of. I love HOCKEY. Few bars that every year gets the NHL package. If looking for favorite NHL team this is the bar too hang out at.

Promotions they always have something going on. I never knew but NFL games they give out free shots evert touchdown.. Sure its free taste ok but catch nice high scoring game some of the best free shots!  

Service never had bad one. Servers are attentive, usually come for HH make sure remind you get that last HH order in whether fill or not, and managers there very much present checking up on guests really on it.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,2,4,7b_xzjMNQWOi76q4P-jdkw

2659689,2012-05-06,4,jdAdf7keZac1idbgNKG2pw,"No, don't roll your eyes at my 4 star review of Steiner's. At least take a gander of the beautiful Caprese Artisan Tomato/Fresh Mozzarella with Grilled Chicken accompanied by watercress, arugala and basil that is the Tuesday Special Salad. Yes, they have daily salad specials and this one was so perfect I ordered a second to go for lunch Weds. 

Steiner's has always been a go to for better than average bar food, and now they are offering creative healthier fare (and delicious - I didn't even use the dressing. Each bite was like summer garden freshness in my mouth) They still have the yummy baby lamb chops, burgers my carnivore friends rave over (and any burger can be ordered veggie or turkey form) breakfast, and buffalo shrimp among a very eclectic menu. 

Four stars is also for the service. Though you seat yourself, usually someone greets you as you find a spot. I like the community table away from the main bar, but close enough to see a game on one of the many TVs. If no game is on that interests me, there's free Wi-Fi. You get the feeling that there's a regular crowd as my very helpful waitress Stephanie (pointed out the new salad, and on another occasion filled me in on the Steiner's card, which earns points for food & drink for non gamers like me) seemed to know most of the folks who came in. It's the small touches that I appreciate: water glass is always filled, I'm asked if I want a to go box before asking for one and on this occasion, she even let me know Happy Hour was about to end in case I wanted to ""freshen"" my cocktail. She was very busy with said regulars but I always felt looked after. The manager was on the floor and seemed equally familiar with the regular crowd, interacting with guests warmly. 

Many late nights I'll stop into the bar to grab a salad for work the next day, and the bartenders are always welcoming and food comes up quick. 

For all of these reasons, and especially price to portion ratio, Steiner's is indeed a 4 star joint I'm happy to have in my neighborhood go to options. 

Now, remember, a different salad every day (""my"" salad on Tues) summer is coming just in time to cool off with a cold drink and refreshing salad. Enjoy!",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,10,5,4,sL1b4Hj1IBrAMgThj2busQ

They have a crazy amount of beer selection! I'm not much of a beer drinker but I do like trying fruity ciders or ales. Decided on blackberry cider ($5) and pear cider ($4). It's 2 for 1 so basically we got 4 beers for $9. That is a steal! It's pretty much a beer lovers heaven. 
 
During happy hour appetizers are either $3, $6, or $9! So for Food-- I decided on the steak nachos ($6). These were pretty damn creative. On top of each tortilla chip is all the ingredients in nachos and the cheese was melted on top surrounding all the ingredients. So it wasn't messy like nachos usually is. You just pick up the chip and eat it. Of course the portion isn't as big as they usually are but it still filled me up. 

The beau got the chicken wings with fries ($6). Pretty good. I liked how the wings were just the right amount of hot. The fries stood out to me. It was crispy and seasoned just right. They weren't just regular ol' fries you find at a bar. 

Atmosphere is pretty laid back. There's bunch of TVs for the games. It was pretty packed when I got here but our server, Jose, did a good job checking on us.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,5,3,4,6c_bKFeySgBv4yt0BNCBZg

The shrimp are huge (16/20) and lightly battered which will remind you of fried chicken. It is perfectly fried to a crispy golden brown. The shrimp is perfectly sauced so it not so messy. The dressing is awesome! Tastes like homemade and reminded me of Bob's Big Boy. The fries are done to perfection with tender potato inside. Rating: 5/5

Death Valley Chips are homemade, crispy waffle cut potato chips tossed in Yosemite Sam Steiner's Spicy Seasoning blend of Lawry's Seasoning Salt and paprika. These chips are criss-cut thinly on a mandolin and fried to light crispy perfection. Ask for some ranch or bleu cheese dressing for dipping! Rating: 5/5

On Fridays, New England Clam Chowder is on the menu. It is creamy and chock full of clams. The blend of vegetables adds a great flavor to the creamy base. There is a unique kick of cayenne pepper to keep your taste buds happy. One of the best clam chowders I have ever had! Rating: 5/5

Oasis Cobb Salad is crispy iceberg and romaine greens with rows of diced chicken, avocado, bleu cheese, bacon, tomato, and a halved hard boiled egg. The greens are fresh and crisp, laying the foundation of one of my favorite salads. The chicken is tender and cut into perfect bite-sized pieces. The flavors of creamy pungent bleu cheese, smoky, salty bacon, creamy avocado, and rich yolky egg come together for the perfect Cobb salad. Ranch or bleu cheese dressings are perfect on this salad.

Sea Breeze Mediterranean Steiner's Pub Salad is a mound of crisp romaine topped with a dressing of marinated cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, jicama, and green peppers mixed into a balsamic and herb vinaigrette and served with crispy pita chips, kalamata olives and sprinkle of feta cheese. You can choose to top this salad with 3 lamb chops or grilled chicken breast. We went with the lamb and a fine choice it was. The lamb chops are fantastic and grilled to perfection. They are tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The gaminess is subdued by the rosemary and olive oil marinade (I personally like the rustic flavor, but tasted great all the same). The Greek compote dressing on top has just the right amount of flavor to flavor all of the vegetables. There is no need for extra dressing. All of the vegetables are crisp, fresh, and vibrant. Rating: 5/5

Flamingo Chicken Sandwich is topped with homemade bourbon barbeque sauce and a mound of fresh coleslaw. The sandwich packs a 6 oz. skinless boneless chicken breast that is tender and juicy. The coleslaw is creamy. You can ask for it on the side if you don't want it on your sandwich. The bourbon barbeque sauce works perfectly with the chicken and coleslaw. Rating: 5/5

Sinful Frozen Cappuccino Sundae Pie is coffee ice cream layered with fudge on a peanut butter rice krispy crust and drizzled with Hershey's Chocolate Syrup and fresh cocoa.

The coffee ice cream and fudge layers meld together into a mocha flavor which is always great. I can't wait to order this again! Rating: 5/5",aGUZKSRPA-MHHj6b8GhOww,3,0,5,3xasoKgT2bXHraziK7wH8A

Service here is just as good as the south location, which means great service.  I ate at the bar where service is always good since you have a bartender there.  Food was just as good and you can't go wrong with their Kobe anything.  

Like the other Steiner's, it's a little dark inside.  Like other pubs, the air inside can be a little smokey.  These are the things I notice now that I no longer smoke.

Little did I know that I was coming on the same night as the NBA finals last game.  I don't follow hoops.  So I was kind of frustrated when they switched the channels from a baseball game and a hockey game I was watching in favor of the NBA finals.  How dare they!  But nobody else seemed to mind so oviously I was in the minority.  Regardless, I was here for a sandwich.  Not sports.  And a sandwich I got.  It was not the kind of Reuben I was craving.  The sliced thin and stacked tall beef with cheese, sauerkraut and dressing like at Jason's Deli.  It was thicker sliced beef and not stacked as high as I wanted.  Still, this was a good sandwich.  Great flavor. Plenty filling.  Dry rye bread with just the right amount of dressing to help it down the gullet.  Actually more cheesey than what I had wanted.  And that is not a bad thing.  Cheese is good friend of mine.  Although this was not what I had pictured in my mind,  I did not leave disappointed.  And that is a win in my book.  Also, the coleslaw on the side was respectable.  Not the best slaw I've had but nothing to scoff at.  Service was also commendable. I was seen by at least four people.  One who took my drink order.  One who took my food order.  One who brought my food to the table.  And one who removed my empty plate.  They were mostly quick to my table.  And friendly.

But if I could, I would give them 10 for what I witnessed tonight. Of all the bars I've been to in Vegas, I have never seen a manager leave the establishment to bring a customer back inside because they were too drunk to be driving. And then they went above that, gave the customer a menu to eat any item on the house. That was probably one of the best things I've ever witnessed. 

Afterwards, my family and I noticed the lady was still stumbling on her way out after eating and after a few minutes of convincing, she eventually let us drive her home. When we got back the employees and managers thanked us and even offered us some dessert or drinks. Huge kudos to you guys. You made our night.",Q_DTTi0hrfE2PPPQ7r5x1Q,3,2,5,G3AhyMouzYTPqh21DUAPDA

My husband was disappointed to see that his favorite chicken dish was no longer on the menu, which seems to have fewer entrees and more sandwich choices than before.

I was happy to see that the Sunday special was a salad with shrimp and mango, with banana bread croutons, with a ""lemony vinaigrette.""  It was supposed to be served over field greens, but the waiter said it was no problem to change that to romaine.  So far, so good.

My salad was served with the dressing on the side, the way I'd asked.  But when I started to dig in, I realized that it was also in the salad!  The waiter said it was the kitchen's mistake, but who knows?  I didn't want to wait for another, since we'd waited a long time to be served, so I kept it.  I shouldn't have.  The shrimp were totally overcooked and dried out.  The mango was completely unripe.  And I was halfway through before I realized that the kitchen left off the banana bread croutons, too.  What should have been delicious was a total abomination.

Hubby ordered Chicken Picatta, and he liked it a lot.

It was hubby's birthday (which we'll celebrate in a bigger way next week), so on my way to the ladies' room I asked the waiter to bring him their special dessert at the end:  vanilla ice cream with dark chocolate syrup, and banana bread biscotti.  Mmmm, it sounded good, and they brought it out with a birthday candle ablaze.  I sampled it and realized that those biscotti were probably the basis of the missing croutons, and I wasn't missing anything!  They were inedible. I was already home when I realized that the dark chocolate syrup had been left out, too!  

They comped us on the dessert, so I really shouldn't complain, but somebody needs to be drug-testing the kitchen staff.  Just too many lapses for comfort.  If it weren't for the decent service and my husband's enjoyment of his meal, I wouldn't have given this the rating I did.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,1,1,3,U3UQ6J0QWrxaU3tRsJgd6A
