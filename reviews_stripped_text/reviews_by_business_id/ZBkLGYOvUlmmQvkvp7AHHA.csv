Coming from NYC (and especially after visiting Seoul), it's so easy to be disappointed in my quest for good Korean fried chicken when traveling.

499319,2011-06-17,0,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"The first thing you need to consider is the fact that you're not in K-Town (as in LA's K-Town) so we need to look at this place through the Las Vegas lens.  

Let's look at three things: food, drinks, and ambiance.  

The food is very good.  Authentic dishes combined with some newer fusion items.  I was here with some Korean friends from LA and they were pretty satisfied with the food.  I would suggest the fried chicken, it's different from what you would normally get at a K-Town restaurant, but plenty good!  Also the chicken gizzard is a must!

The drinks.  We went there for diner, but what diner would be complete without some soju?!  The bottles are very reasonably priced.  I can't say much more about the rest of their bar though.  

The ambiance was also definitely on the good side of average.  We got their relatively earlier but the feel of the place made you forget you were in a 100+ degree desert.  They did a good job of instilling a sense of true Korean-American restaurant/bar environment. 

Overall, if you're in the mood for some Korean food, and you don't feel like stinking of bbq the rest of the night (not that that would be a bad thing) then this is the spot to go!  It's in Chinatown so you're still close to everything else you would want to do in town.",eBvrTvDr3UjlAwQRtVVOOw,1,1,4,DiTU11lcvnAhuYZX-bsdoA

There was a chicken place in Greenland, but it closed down, and it wasn't that great. We have never gone to the Norebang (karaoke) there, but it looks nice.

1701353,2014-04-19,2,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"The first sign of trouble should have been that this Chinatown plaza was almost dead at 11PM on a Friday night. The hours were incorrect on 1900's Yelp page, and almost everything else in this plaza was closed- but we went in to this place when we saw the Chicken & Beer banner.

Bizarre to walk in to a club-looking place but we were seated right away.
Concept of buzzing a doorbell to get service is odd. And again, the fact that it was completely dead at 11PM on a Friday, should have been a heads up.

The menu is ridiculous, composed of pages of Clip-art festooned specials with nonexistent descriptions and then traditional menu pages with dish listings, prices, and photos. Speaking of prices, the ones in the menu range from high to insane: $8 to $24 for soup, $9 for a 7 piece wing order, and shaved ice desserts for $15? 
Don't even get me started on the beer listing, which shows pricing for your beverage based on CCs- as if they're going to give you an injection or something. Side note, who on earth spends $50 on Miller Lite? ANYONE?

Anyway.
Tentatively ordered the tempura udon soup and two 7-piece orders of wings (deri-q and mild), and considering there were few to no other customers, it was a considerable wait for our food.

While we waited, we were provided with what appeared to be a vase of sticks, and a set of very dated and very dirty/cloudy water glasses. I'm the first person to down copious amounts of water when dining out, but the age and cleanliness (or lack there of) of the waterglasses skeeved me out.

But we finally got our food.
The tempura udon soup was too hot too eat for a good half hour, by which point the tempura was soggy. Which was irrelevant, considering this $8 bowl of soup consisted of just one piece of shrimp tempura and noodles, with some green onion thrown on for color.
The wings though, were a surprise: the first batch (the deri-q) were smaller and served with tiny dishes of some grainy green stuff with a thick, dark brown sauce, almost tasting like soy sauce.  It was surprisingly delicious.
Second batch of wings (mild) were about twice the size each, very crunchy/crispy, and had a sauce on them that smelled amazing but didn't pack the same punch in flavor. 

Not sure how this place is open with this pricing and lack of business.
Service was spotty- not sure why they had three employees chilling, if only one person is needed to listen for the buzzer and give one-word answers to our questions.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,1,2,5BoWpynVsU-a18nGGA4i5g

1825035,2012-07-03,1,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"Being from LA, my criteria for a Korean bar is highly standardized. However, this place was able to make the cut even when its outside my hometown.

What I truly love about this place is the fact that they incorporate more than the standard Korean bar food. Their fried chicken is cooked to pefection! Almost as if it's from the South. Why go to KFC when you can get better quality fried chicken to complement the variety of beer you are given at this joint?  Who can argue? Beer is also not only served by Oz but also by CC. Depending on how many people we're with, my friends and I stick to around 3000cc so that we don't bloat ourselves. Along with our chicken and beer is the very tasty corn & cheese. Tasty but not high in quantity. They put some kind of salt in there that makes me want to order seconds if not thirds. I have also tried the Kimchi(ish) pizza. It wasn't bad but I personally don't like the fusion of Korean and Italian foods. If anything, keep them original and separate. Not only that, but the pizza was undercooked and it went cold quick. If you're drunk, you wouldn't care, but I take my food seriously so cook it to near perfection please. 

On to the traditional soju. Personally, I enjoy chamisul the most, mainly because it's authentic. And at Bazic, chamisul is only $9.99! In comparison to other bars, you save about a couple of bucks for the same exact soju.

Service is inconsistent. Even though there's about like 10 tables, they only have one waiter a night, or so it seems. There are times where I alert them multiple times and the server walks right past my table.

When I compare this joint to other Korean bars in the Clark County, this place has the edge when it comes to food because they serve such a diverse variety of foods that you won't find at every Korean bar. This place in itself is a bar, restaurant, karaoke.",jCUqHcg4xvFtsG6ah6RcRA,0,0,4,YUXd5RcSpTwXa-Qttl-4ag

Pure drinking establishment With lots of drinking. 

Fried chicken is flaky and juicy on the inside. Not sure if it was the frying but the wings and drumlets looked huge.

Kimchi tofu and kimchi rice were REALLY good especially the kimchi tofu. Who knew stir frying kimchi and serving it warm would taste so friggin good.

Now the booze. Flavored sojus were large in size and were quite tasty. The beers...Where to start with the beers...

640ml bottles of korean beer (Cass & Hite) were 7 dollars i think. I prefer OB but given the choices Hite is more to my liking. They also had japanese Asahi as well as an American Sam Adams. 

The best bang for your buck has to be the 5000cc super big dispenser thing that comes with free 5 piece of chicken.

I had the ""Pure Chicken"" in Deri-Q, which was essentially fried chicken nuggets in a teriyaki'ish sauce. They were decent, and while the cost was $9 or $10, at least they gave me a basket full. Unfortunately, that's where the up-sides ended. Service was lame to say the least. The menu wasn't particularly attractive in any way, neither was the atmosphere. Plus a 20 minute travesty at the end because their CC machine didn't work - and they pretty much treated it like it was the patrons' fault!

The only reason I erred on the generous side with 2 stars is because at least, toward the end of the CC debacle, they had the wherewithal to bring us some free fruit desert plates. It was much too little much too late, but a shred of common sense is better than none at all.

Watermelon soju was yum!  Soup out yo drink out of the watermelon. Thats fun.  We had the mango, yogurt, lychee sojus!  I'm not big on sweet drinks.  They were all sweet.  Yogurt and lychee were my favorite.  Kim chee fried rice was awesome.  Lots of kim chee with a good spice and a fried egg on top. YUM.  Pork katsu platter was of course huge.

Foods-- They're really known for their chicken wings. Their hot wings is defiantly spicy but extremely good. I can never eat it all because it's so damn spicy. I love LOVE their sweet potato fries. They are really thin cut fries and they put sugar on top of it.

Drinks-- soju soju soju! My favorite! They have all the delicious flavors. Mango is my favorite. They have pineapple soju in a pineapple fruit!

When we went there it was really dead. We were their only customers. But the ambiance is cool. We ordered some fried pork cutlets, Korean bbq, sweet potato fries, shrimp tempura, watermelon soju, and of course their wings since it's the most popular there. But I've had better and cheaper of all of those food. Now, let's talk about their wings. They have I think 3 different flavors for the wings and we tried them all. The wings are chunky pieces. It's not like wingstop or buffalo wild wings size wings. But as far as taste goes, it's alright. Didn't really like it actually.. And as far as the service/staff, they were really nice and on point.

2956048,2011-07-26,1,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"Whenever I think of karaoke, I think of Bazic.  Yes, it's first on my consideration set for those of you familiar with marketing vernacular.  Bazic is probably one of the few karaoke bars I can stand in Las Vegas.  After being dragged to almost every single karaoke venue in town by my friends, the number of mediocre to just plain awful karaoke rooms I've been to has been mind-blowing.  Fortunately, Bazic has six rooms with flat screen TVs, great sound systems, and a good variety of songs.  It almost makes a three-hour karaoke session tolerable.

For those of you who don't give a booty for karaoke, Bazic has some great food as well. During the last few years I've been to Bazic, I only recently tried their food.  I knew for a fact that the fried chicken was their famous dish, but I wanted to try something different.  I looked at their selections and ordered the squid salad instead.  It was actually very good, and tasted almost exactly how it does back at the homeland.  I would say the fried chicken is a ""safe"" order, but if you want to try something a little more experiential, ask the waitress for a recommendation.  My classmate asked about the seafood pancake, the waitress informed her, and she really enjoyed it.

I know Bazic is famous for their fried chicken, but I think there's other great dishes that flies under the radar.  There's some great bar food available on their menu that you can find rarely outside of Korea, at least in the same style and setting.  The full order of the squid salad is perfect for sharing with friends while enjoying a nice beer.  If you ever decide to go, don't lean too much on the fried chicken.  Try a new dish!

No Kirin (this is a Korean not Japanese establishment) but they did have Sapporo. 

The jokes were flying, the music was awful but we had a great time and I might do something like this again but now I know what to and what not to expect.

3026283,2010-07-08,0,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"Met up there tonight for the Late Night UYE, while I got there a little after everyone, I have to say I was quite impressed with the place.

I went to college in a small town in kansas, the small town didn't have much, but it did have 4 amazing chicken restaurants, 2 of them have been featured on the Travel Channel, so it's safe to say, I've eaten some damn good chicken in my day.

I have been on a BBQ quest in town this year, but I am always looking for a good piece of chicken, so far Church's was still winning, but today it took a back seat, and I have to say I was shocked that Bazic was the place that is now the leader in my Chicken Quest.

I know....I'm saying the best fried chicken in vegas, is in a place in the middle of chinatown, and no I'm not smoking crack...the chicken is that good.

Granted it may take a while for them to serve it, (I worked in a deli in college, good fresh fried chicken should take atleast 10mins), but it's worth the wait, and the fact that you can get 10 pieces of chicken and a 32oz beer for $16 is an added bonus.

The chicken comes out hot from the fryer, the meat is moist and juicy, and the breading is crispy and well seasoned. I also was able to try some of their ""Pure"" chicken (boneless chicken bites) that were tasty, and the fruit and other desserts were pretty good.

They were having an issue with their POS and credit card systems, it was bad timing their part as it may have upset a few yelpers, but the chicken more than made up for it in my books.

My only complaint is that the beers are a little costly, I mean come on 11.50 for a 32oz beer, is a but steep, yet you can get one and 10pcs of chicken for $16 (still not sure how that math works out). 

Plus the place is worth a trip just to check out the bathrooms!!!

I know I'll be where I will be going whenever I'm hankering some Chicken and Beer, who would have ever known that the place would be in the middle of Chinatown

While this is basically a Korean place with a full menu the star attraction seems to be the fried chicken with a liter of beer for $16.  So Angela H and I shared one order and it was more than enough for us.  It was pretty good chicken and it is hard to screw up a Newcastle.  It came with a side of cole slaw and some pickled radishes.  Our serving did not come with the Kimchee that two of the other servings did.  They must buy their chickens from the same place KFC does as not all the parts were recognizable as normal parts.

The service during the time I was there was pretty good.  The fiasco with the credit cards was just starting as I left with Bobby being told his card was no good.  Being a merchant I fully understand machines and networks can go down.  If you are up front and open about it writing all the info down is a perfectly acceptable way to handle it and I don't know anybody any more that cannot go online the next day to verify they were charged the expected amount.

My favorite is their orange chicken. Same size as their fried chicken but, with a spicy orange chicken taste. Imagine Panda Express' orange chicken but, when you eat it your lips burn from the spiciness of it. YUM!

They had endless flavors of soju - lychee, strawberry, yogurt. The bottle sizes are RIDICULOUSLY huge and cost only $11. My favorite is the lychee!

I have had a few dishes here like the spicy chicken soup and the fried chicken and, although pretty good for what they were, it was nothing to write home about. They have a full bar here and can make whatever you want from well to top shelf. However, we usually get up on some soju or hit up the beer tower whenever we roll through as our go-to. As far as the karaoke rooms go, they cater to different size parties and accommodate different types of singers such as your pop singer, rock singer, k-pop singer, and so on. They do their best to keep up with new jams that come out and the popular stuff on the radio they heard just before they came to belt out some tunes, but most times it's sorely lacking. Nonetheless, if you're looking into something a little older or those couple of fan favorites that you continually practice in the shower, then odds are they have the jams you are looking for.

Oh, don't worry, I don't think their fried chicken is THAT fresh, it's just me singing karaoke in one of the back rooms.  Yes, I openly acknowledge that my singing sucks and has been compared to a menagerie of croaking critters and not just fowl (ha, ha...ok, bad joke).  

This review is ONLY for the karaoke rooms and drinks, NOT the food.  

With that in mind, let me say I'm thoroughly disappointed in this place.  I love the vibe and setup of the rooms.  Two flat screen tvs, pretty sweet system setup and comfy sofas just make the space really inviting.  However, on two separate visits, the sound just wasn't right: the first time we had trouble with one of the mics and the second time the echo was on overdrive.  Both times we asked for help and both times were told there's nothing that could be done.  Really?  This is a business, right?  Unless I'm mistaken, businesses usually try to please their customers.  They really need to have someone on site that can tweak these little problems before a customer tries to do it and breaks the whole system.  

The drink menu is well-sized, with a nice selection of mixed drinks and beers.  While they didn't have some of the alcohol or mixers that I'm used to ordering, the soju options made up for it...at least I tried something new, eh?  Unfortunately, unless I can be assured that the minor problems with the sound systems are fixed, I can't say that I will be back to try something else new.  At least that will give me some time to work on my pipes so people won't think the livestock is being killed off in back.",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,1,1,2,hg0xoOM_u8lWFsrhtokV9w

Lots of loud music, laser lights, korean music videos on projection screen and ESPN on several flat screens.  This place is definitely a drinking establishment and that should have been my first warning.

I didn't feel like fighting with bones, tendons, and ligaments so I ordered the ""Dari-Q Chicken nuggets"" and since it was a cold night, I added an order of kim-chi oden.

The chicken nuggets were more like chicken fragments, but there were a lot of them for the $9.95 order.  The dari-q flavor was pretty good though, mildly garlic, soy sauce, and sweet.  The coating on the frgaments was very crispy and dry, the meat itself was also very dry like they had been left in the fryer too long.  A small order of pickled daikon also came with the chicken.  It was very crunchy and cool, but too sweet.  The oden was pretty good, no complaints.

Service wasn't bad.  Even though the waitresses were out of view, they did check on me from time to time.  Plus there is that cool little bell!

Overall, 2.5 stars, but they do get an extra 0.5 stars for no credit card hassles!

I know Bazic is also about karaoke and whatnot but the food has to have some semblance of 'good' as it is a restaurant as well ...this was not the case on my recent and most likely last visit. We ordered fried chicken wings, sauteed gizzards and bulgogi. 

The chicken wings were good enough, fried and battered, ok sauce. Crispy and I can see why people always say how awesome it is. Not overcooked, not over-battered.. just right. Basic, if you will. 

The gizzards -  were not good. I have grown up with a style or two of gizzard dishes ..and these were simply over cooked and not flavorful. Dry and seasoned sooo spicy that it wasn't enjoyable. I love spice, Korean spiced food and peppers in my food. These were not good at all. It was just little pieces of meat overcooked and overly seasoned to the point of nearly inedible.

 As for the Bulgogi.. Ok Bulgogi is marinated meats, beef usually in my experience.. and often has a nice flavorful finish of sesame and a bit of black pepper. It's usually a crowd-pleas'r. Good  and flavorful, marinated and then grilled is usually the setup.  This particular version we had was waaay over cooked and dry. Its supposed to be marinated beef, and it was really bland and dry. 

Never again. When we mentioned it to the server, she said it looked over-cooked.. though she was the one that brought it to the table. The saving element was the beer. Good cold beer, even in Winter is a good thing.

So It's a shame, because I had heard so many thing that were good about this place. Maybe next time, maybe if I am brought there for the chicken and singing only :) Happy Eating!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,11,12,2,U1uXz3oz4ziameChnk6G0A

today was the grand opening of Bazic. i got one of their fliers while leaving the western market. it looked like it was straight from Korea. they have fried chicken, marinated chicken, and lunch specials which include pork katsu, chicken katsu, cheese cutlet.. which comes with rice, miso soup, chicken curry, and a salad. 

they start you off with a bowl of sesame seeds and a stick to grind it yourself.. then the waitress comes over and pours your katsu sauce in it. they brought out these sugary pretzel like sticks.. after i ate a piece i wondered if it was just for decoration cuz it tasted horrible. maybe it was just for looks.. oh well!

i ordered the cheese cutlet.. it was chicken and mozz cheese. the cheese was so fresh it wouldnt stop stretching. it was a bit troublesome taking bites cuz the cheese ended up all over. lol. but it was tasty. pork was juicy.. and not from oil. gets points for that. the curry and rice could have been a meal on its own. it was japanese style curry with potato and carrots and chicken. tasty! the salad was shredded with a white dressing similar to the taste of potato salad. deeeelicious! this was all for $9.. i thought i was only getting rice and meat. it was a delightful surprise. my friend got the regular chicken katsu and it was just as tasty as mine. breading was crispy but not so crispy it cuts the roof of your mouth.. just as juicy too! we had a bottle of OB beer and it was perfect. pictures!!

::EDIT::

i went back 2 days ago and the waitress informed me that the curry that came with the lunch special was just a special for opening day. its $1.99 to add the curry onto the lunch special now. but its still a pretty good price! and they had the marinated chicken which i had as a lunch special and it was great! very juicy and tender. not dry at all. you could tell it wasnt sitting there for a while before they cooked it. and i dont know if it was just that day but they closed at 4pm so i would call to check if they have new hours. i hope its not cuz they arent doing well cuz this place has so much potential.",SssXdhbeYJOCF6sfSFwC-Q,6,2,4,LoOtrcY_Q6QPwP3nXQhfLQ
4925990,2012-07-03,1,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"To say the least, Bazic is a quirkly karaoke bar and restaurant.  To start, my friend and I had an argument on the name of the place.  Is it Bazic or is Basic with a backwards ""s""?  We saw both ways of the spelling everywhere in the place.  Finally, I asked the harajuku dressed waitress what it was called and she said.....Bazic.  Now that we know that the name is, Bazic....what does Basic mean?!  

The waitress led us to the back of the bar/restaurant to the rooms where they had the private karaoke sessions.  We started off with ordering drinks and food.  Our group of 6 had thought that getting the huge self serve beer tower would be the best bang for our buck.  Can't remember the price but, it wasn't crazy expensive.  The food on the other hand wasn't the greatest.  Some of the food on the menu wasn't available which sucked because based off of the reviews on Yelp it looked delicious.  We ended up getting French fries and these deep fried chicken niblets that were coated in Korean sauce.  Luckily I was a little tipsy and more into the singing but, the fries were okay and the niblets could have been better if they didn't come to us cold.

  But, I can't knock the service.  There was a bell we can ring on the door whenever we needed something and the wait was never to long.  As for the song selection it was up to par.  Usually found what we wanted but, I'd say half of the song selection was written in Korean and the other half was English which was limiting.  Oh yeah, the tambourine!  For those that maybe shy to sing, they have a tambourine that looked like it was from the Electronic Daisy Carnival.  More cow.....Tambourine?  

The bath rooms were really funny.  The men's bathroom walls were painted with skanky  anime chicks that were half naked.  Eh, can't hate that.  My wife had said that the woman's bathrooms had the same but male cartoons.  

Overall, the night was quirky and super fun, especially after having a bunch to drink.  We ended up with a pretty high bill and for that reason I'll give this place 3 stars.  I'm really glad we went but, I felt the food wasn't very good and was overpriced.",CLBDMeEs5mONY5uXZ2QRNQ,2,2,3,pKlATFKV8eX4mPdGP8-xMg
4974474,2008-03-14,8,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"Bazic Bar & Restoyaky serves up what I would call Korean bar food.  It's located on the second floor of the Pacific Asian Plaza.  They have a bunch of random Asian dishes that are meant to be shared with friends over a few drinks.  

Their specialty though is their fried chicken deep fried in olive oil!  As a result, we had to try it!  We got the Leg and Thigh Special, 5 pieces for $7.95.  It came with a basic cabbage salad with Thousand Island-like dressing and a side order of pickled daikon.  The BF is the connoisseur on fried chicken and he thought it was pretty good.

We also got the Sweet Rice Crust Soup with Seafood for $17.99.  It's good enough for about four people to have a small bowl each.  The waiter will come with a big bowl of about four to five rectangular pieces of rice crust.  And then he'll pour the thick soup (more like gravy than broth) onto the rice crust.  It's filled with octopus, calamari, and veggies.  Pretty tasty and the rice stays crispy because the soup is so thick.  (There's a Chinese version called sizzling rice soup, except that soup is more broth-like and the rice may not be in rectangles.)

We didn't get any kind of bowl to grind our own sesame seeds like lena d. or Mike C., so maybe that's only if you order the katsu, which we didn't.  And we also came for dinner which I think is a different experience too.

I'd definitely want to return to try out their other Korean goodies, but I would prefer going with a larger group so you can order more stuff.  Their portions are meant to share, so it's hard when it's only the two of you.

The artwork in the bathrooms makes for interesting conversation (especially the men's room) and there's also a Luxury Music Studio in the back.  (Is that for karaoke?)  

There's also a little bell to buzz from your table should you need the staff, that way you don't have to wave them down or go looking for them yourself.

5049739,2010-07-09,3,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"We had a Late Night UYE with my Yelpies.

Yelpalicious Dish we kept hearing about is the fried chicken so of course that was my priority. They were doing a promo special of $16 gets you 10pc chicken and a 1000cc(big ass mug, probably a liter) of draft beer so almost everyone grabbed that.  

Winner, winner, chicken dinner! It was lightly battered, crisp and came out piping hot. It wasn't very greasy like most joints so that was definitely a plus. They serve the order of chicken with small banchans of sweet picked daikon radish, cabbage kimchee (we had 4 orders at our table of the special and only 2 got kimchee?), and a ""slaw"" of thin cabbage with a thousand island-esque dressing.  I shared one of these with my buddy Nins and needless to say we gobbled it up and I know that bitch was eying the last piece hoping I'd say I didn't want more! LOL  All went very well with it, but I was talking with Nins and seem to agree that maybe we should have gotten a side of something (Rice! Yeah I'm totally ""Filipino"" in this sense!)  or some sauce to break up the dense chicken flavor in my mouth. Again, we gobbled so lack of sauce or another side didn't stop us from enjoying though it could be even better. Will ask for sauce and rice next time. Definitely, some of the better fried chicken offerings in Vegas and I do love me some fried chicken. 

Other than the chicken, there are a few rice and noodle dishes and plenty of snack plates. There are some oddities on the menu like snails so if you like the bizarre to be your late night eats then this place is worth exploring. There are more traditional items than their are ""friendlies"" (bulgogi, fried rice, etc) and I like that they keep it real like that. 

Now here likes the rub....

Some people were ready to go so he brought out all the bills even though some people were still noshing. It was taking so long that people were wondering what's the hold up in bringing back all our checks.  Later we found out card machines were down....if maybe some of us were told earlier some people could have mustered cash and gone on their way or at the very least let people know what's the situation to keep people patient. Also some of our late comers ordered food and was first sitting on a separate table, as other people left we moved their empty plates to their original table to make room for them to sit with the leftover group. Because of the empty plates on their original table, they didn't get food since they thought they already got food and ate it. Err...well the order was put in so something should have came out so where did their chicken go? The server though was very apologetic about everything and tried very hard to make things right. Even made some fries and taters while our compadres waited on their forgotten chicken order. 

My chicken was a 4, the service was attentive in serving/checking in and tried very hard so even though there was some major in house mistakes that normally would be a no go, I can appreciate a place that tries their hardest to make it right. No one is perfect and sometimes there is just an off night. I know they are under new management and I am not quite sure how recently that happen so they very well can be still smoothing out the kinks.  I had trouble figuring out what star rating to give it, but after some thought I think 3 is fair. It was an OK night based on what went on. 

Still, I think this place is a interesting environment (please look at he bathrooms and make sure to READ the song lyrics/ text on them- hilarious and very random song choice are meshed into the art!) and has some adventurous plates that are a must do very soon as well as a solid ""Bazic"" with their fried chicken goodness (now if only they had waffles I would DIE).

 I will be back soon with the BF since he would like to try the chicken, but after much thought...I'm going to do this CASH only and wait a while. For now, I think the Yelper crew is chicken to try this out again. 

UPDATE- So I didn't know part of the story of the credit cards when I wrote my original review and that alone makes me bump it down another star. To not communicate with all us that the cards are down and then proceed to write everyones credit card numbers to do it later is very unprofessional even if the intentions weren't shady. Sorry, but even though that didn't happen to my card these are all the people I am with. Now I understand why Matthew C wanted to burn the place. I also forgot that one Yelper went off with their card thinking it was paid for and left and later we were told he hasn't paid. Angela had to call him to figure out if they were pulling something sneaky on us. It was very weird that now they were able to swipe Angelas card just fine to pay for Joe's bill when a few minutes ago it wasn't working for the other Yelpers. 

Whatever was going on, it wasn't handled/communicated well and that's the bottom line.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,5,2,5TGOxBF6hn-cICZQY_KIJA
5060137,2012-05-21,9,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"Vegas Yelp UYE Karaoke Extravaganza!

SITREP

What a good time it was at Bazic Bar & Restroyaky.  After the wonderful Fremont Street Experience, we knew there would be some Yelping madness we would want to engage in after Midnight.   But after that crazy fantastic time, we indeed wondered if we would have any ""juice"" left to manage this task as we planned to attack the early morning (Midnight - 3AM) with renewed vigor!!

SETUP

Organized by our very own Seattle Yelper Clover A., this proved to be a good location to have a ""meet-up"" with Yelpers from different cities.  [First we had to get there!  LIMO RIDE:  While at Fremont Street Experience, we went by the Golden Nugget, and there was a bored limo driver who looked at our crazy group and decided then and there that he wanted to be part of our madness.  We had to get to Bazic QUICK for set-up, and so we negotiated with him, and he shot us over to our Korean Karaoke Bar destination in no time.]

BAZIC ROOMS

If you are familiar with the Rock Box in Seattle or Rurulala in Sacramento, it is a very similar set-up.  Big rooms.  Nice physical plant layout of couches and sectionals.  Decent serviceable equipment.  It had the potential to be Karaoke at it's very best.  

KARAOKE BOOKS & EQUIPMENT

However, the books were JUST in Korean!  There were some English-language inserted pages, but that was an obvious afterthought.  In addition, we were somewhat limited in our selections it would have appeared, but we did manage (for the most part) with those selection of English-language songs in the narrow band of yellow and green pages.  

And then there was the tech itself - such as the controls - which was all overlaid in Korean language and no English to be found.  Made it difficult for us to read the stereo & equipment controls and it did become a nuisance to have one of the guys come and adjust/modify sound levels, feedback, distortion-issues whenever they did arise instead of being able to take care of the issue ourselves.

MY PERSONAL FAVES

I got to belt out my Def Leppard and Linkin Park Standards, so I was dam happy.  I even smoothed out the end of the evening (er, morning) with the Beatles ""Michelle"", so it was all good.

THE FOOD & DRINK

There was an ample supply of all kinds of chicken appetizers, beer and sake to keep our energy up, so no complaints in this department.  There were also some sweet-potato fries which were powdered with sugar so that they were sweet, and not savory the way I prefer them.  Ah well.  I still ate them and enjoyed them because I haven't met a sweet potato fry I do not like.

PRICING

Interesting to say the least:  unlike the Karaoke I hit in Sacramento, San Francisco, and Seattle, this establishment has a sliding-mechanism that takes into account the consumables factor.  If it was just Karaoke, the room rental was $40 per hour.  However, if we consumed more than $100 in drinks & food, then the room rental would go down to $20 per hour.  Since there was a group of about 14 of us, and we were there from 11am to 3am, we made sure to get more than $100 in consumables that we would probably have gotten anyways, but Clover and I did buy drinks at the end to ""get us over"" that last bump to $100 so we could default the hourly rate down to $20 an hour.  [Note to self:  I HATE doing math when I'm trying to concentrate on singing!]

KARAOKE CABBIES!

Now this was different: it was 3AM at the end of our stint, so this place does something interesting for it's customers - the servers / chefs double as cabbies!  SERIOUSLY!  Since we are ""quite a way into"" Chinatown-Vegas, it would take a while to get a cab out there.  However, two of the establishments associates got two vehicles:  one to take part of our group back to PLATINUM, and another to take my group back to STRATOSPHERE.  A total win!

THE LOWDOWN

All-in-all, a good experience.  I don't like to nit-pick the little things, and also have great respect for cultural traditions and cultural business-choices.

HOWEVER, given this establishment wants to do business with a mainstream English-speaking demographic (it's in Vegas, USA, after all), and given that one could reasonably expect that there would be a preference for more mainstream English-language music by a significant customer base of English-speakers, I'm just saying it would be prudent (as a BUSINESS owner or BUSINESS manager, etc.) to make sure to supply better books and readable tech that is readible in English.  

If on the other hand, the point is to discourage English-speaking patrons from coming here to enjoy Karaoke, then don't change a thing.  Frustrated customers just won't return.  However, we hardcore Karaokers will find a way to manage, even if a bit more grumpily.

All-in-all, a 2-STAR experience.  However, I'll be honest & say I am bumping it up to 3 STARS because of the courtesy the gentlemen showed us in getting us back to our hotels at the end of a lonnnnng night in the weeeee hours of the morning.",3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w,14,11,3,8opxx2kDww9fk7y5Z4HwaQ

I get a call from these chicks that I work with and they are going out drinking. Drinking? On a Monday night?! Freak! Apparently, its their ""Friday"" since they have Tuesdays/Wednesdays off. Sure I answered. I don't start work until noon the next day... So it should be fun.

They chose Bazic, which I have seen many times before but never eaten, so I had no complaints. One of the chicks is Korean so she will know what to order... And they've been there many times before... I arrive there around 10:15ish and the place is pretty crowded. Not standing room only crowded but most of the tables were full. The Korean chick asks if I like beer, and I tell her that I'm not a big fan (due to an incident when I was younger) but will drink hard liquor if we order it. Whats cool is that they have this large beer tube (google it) if you like a lot of beer. 

Instead of the beer tube, we just ordered a 40 oz bottle of Hite, which is Korean beer. I've never had this beer before and was pleasantly surprised how clean it tasted. There was absolutely no after taste. Leo likes it! The Korean chick also ordered food for the table and the rest of us just went with it.

We ordered the sliced pigs feet, spicy raw squid, spicy ramen noodles, udon noodles, and two more bottles of Hite beer. The food was amazingly good. To be honest, I personally wouldn't of ordered these dishes if I was ordering, but I'm thankful that the Korean chick knew what she wanted and knew what was good.

Overall we had a good time of eating, drinking, laughing, and drinking... Haha. They actually have Karaoke rooms in the back which you can rent out to get your jam on. Unfortunately, we didnt get a chance to put on a show. Darn. Maybe next time.

Yes, it's true - every karaoke joint with room rentals will forever and ever be held against the standard of Rock Box (in Seattle), my one true karaoke love. So Bazic (Basic? It's just a backwards 's'.) does tend to suffer by comparison. But let's start with the great things!

1. Big private rooms with cushy couches. Super comfortable.
2. A call button so you can get a server when you feel like ordering anything, which is extremely convenient, if a little upstairs/downstairs.
3. CHICKEN. Ugh, the ""pure chicken"" (boneless popcorn chicken, essentially) was so good. Both the plain and the deri-q (sweet bbq) were delicious whether dipped in the sweet chili or gochujang or eaten alone. I could not stop eating it, I swear to god I tried about four times before I gave up and embraced my pigginess.
4. Cheap. Not sure how it's so cheap, but it is SO CHEAP.
5. The people running the joint are enormously kind. Very friendly, very sweet, even calling us some oddly cheap flat-rate cabs at the end of the night.

And now, the not so great things.

1. Everything is in Korean, which for our non-Korean speaking group was a touch difficult. We weren't sure how to work the controls, how to queue up songs, how to fix the earsplitting volume...although with a little help from the staff we did mostly get there in the end.
2. The books have only tiny slivers in English, and they're sorted by song title, which makes it much harder to find something in the already limited selection.
3. Don't know what was up with our mics, but they never responded to the controls, so the feedback did prompt some shrieks and some cowering in the corner of the couch.
4. The bulgy leering characters painted in the ladies' room were, frankly, frightening.

Anyway, Bazic is a very solid karaoke joint. If it weren't for Rock Box I'd probably judge them a 4, even, but what can I say? I'm spoiled for life.",swt6YSli4EjOSZ_UBNa4bA,4,5,3,JYdEcwZBMb1i7w5bGCCOQg

There is something about how crisp the outside is, moist the meat is, and the yang nyeom sauce is a nice balance of sweet and spicy. Bazic meets all of the standards, but was over priced.

My group also got the Bazic combo number eight. It was fishcake soup, an omelet, pork hock (thinly sliced pigs feet), and warm kimchi and tofu. This plate was not bad and was good enough to feed three of us. For twenty dollars this was one of the more reasonably priced items. Everything else you can go to a place that is not centered around a bar for a fraction of the price.

Overall, I had a good time and they really did go above and beyond for us and the atmosphere there was a fun party (WOOO HOOO that hot 'Paul Pope' style art in the bathroom was nice) and open so late that well, try it and order the chicken but don't go expecting the nicest set up and song selection and I think you'll be pleased.",KuQihTwMfE8pd9vwNyaNaA,4,3,4,tZpHC3rX3WaF9boDX8fxwQ
5492445,2011-11-03,1,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"I was also duped by the BBQ Chicken logo....it's the same logo used by the BBQ Korean Fried Chicken place in Irvine, CA.  Not the Korean fried chicken I was hoping for but the chicken skin is as crispy as it's going to get in Vegas and the meat is moist.  I've been spoiled by Bon Chon and UFC on the east coast....so it doesn't quite compare, but it will meet my chicken cravings until I can escape to another city.  They have two flavors of their fried chicken...the spicy sauce version and the regular fried chicken.  Obviously the spicy sauce makes the skin a little less crisp...so I would say go with the original.  The rest of the korean food is pretty typical (Korean seafood pancake, spicy rice rolls, etc).  

So in terms of fried chicken, good for Vegas...not so good if you're coming from Cali or east coast.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,0,0,3,_hoZ3NQ5GhkAwycWf717Qg
5796602,2013-02-22,0,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,Finally I have time to review this restaurant after I've been there like 5 times already. The reason I go there because I love their fish roe soup. I always get the hot pot one and my bf loves their special omelet. The food is good. The price is a little bit high but their potions are good for the price. Why not 5 stars?! Because the food takes soooooo long. I have no idea why 3 dishes took for 30-40 mins to prepare or maybe they only have 1 chef and the service is slow. Everybody seems so nice and polite tho. I'll go back for sure but its be perfect if the food comes out faster.,kKsiXVSMjX3swu1He2326A,0,0,4,t-ZFAuF0PrQuBbt6GMC1gA
5821657,2009-04-16,0,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"Bazic has really, really good fried chicken. The olive oil does make a difference. There are other items on the menu, but I only have tried the fried rice and it was tasty, but it is not for everyone (There is a very distinct after taste - maybe garlic. I can't really put my finger on it.). 

I see myself coming back to try other items off the menu but it would probably be during a time when the prices are cheaper, like during happy hour. 

Random side-note: There is a doorbell on the table that is used to get the attention of a waiter. (I've only seen this at a couple restaurants.) Also, when you go, you have to check out the bathrooms. There is some pretty crazy, cool artwork.",xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,1,0,3,-iJGjdHhYILSHnEDyL3lrg
5932373,2013-01-21,5,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"When we found out that our #1 late night sober joint was closing at 3am, we turned to Bazic, a Korean Bar with Karaoke.  But it wasn't the bar or the karaoke that we came here for.  It was for their specialty food which was Korean fried chicken.

I love me some KFC, no, not the colonel Kentucky, the Korean Gangnam-style.  They offered various flavors and sizes.  You can do the regular legs and thighs or wings.  Either way you are going to need a wheel chair at the end to roll back to your car.

The wings sort of remind you of Hooter's.  It was thick and super crispy.  We ordered the classic Korean spice, garlic, and some other thing and all tasted very nice.  Will be sure to fill you up!  The seafood pancake was crispy and good.  I never got to try their leg and thighs but my friends seemed to enjoyed them.

Perhaps next time, we'll try their Karaoke.  But for now, if you are craving K-wings and thighs, definitely stop by here.  And best of all they are open past 3am.",8DGFWco9VeBAxjqsuh1aSw,5,4,4,c8fur37RbWr4rsQI_5XzMg
5939193,2013-02-04,15,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"So after midnight me and Ife walk in here. There ain't no seats open so the host guy tells us that we have to wait approximately 5 minutes. I was like ""NO F*CKING WAY! 5 minutes? I don't got the patience for that!"". So we walk up to this random Korean couple and nicely told them to ""get the f*ck out or I will knock the kimchee out of your f*cking mouth!"" Even though the chick at the table quickly got up and ran out the door, Ife still thought it was a good idea to punch her in this face and poor her Soju all over her head. So, with that problem out of the way we got a pretty good seat. We got into another fight with the staff when it literally took like 2 whole minutes for our server to get to us.  What kind of slow ass service is that? Obviously, the server didn't know he was dealing with very wealthy and sophisticated people here. We told him to do the Gangnam Style dance or we wouldn't tip him. Eventually I waved a $1 bill in front of his face and he gave in and started dancing. Just to be nice, I threw his tip off the balcony where he ran for it, down the stairs, as fast as he could. Unfortunately, the Chinese girls at Shuseki had already gotten to it before he could get down there. Seeing how i'm one of those people who love to drink and get wasted, I ordered like 3 bottles of that Orange Soju stuff. At the end of the night, the service was still so bad that we did not pay the check and just walked out. In the parking lot, I decided to use my skillful ""womanizing"" techniques on Ife and I was like: ""Hey bitch! I am totally good at the sex and gonna like totally do the sexing on you!"" That line usually works on every chick at Lewis Family Park, and I just don't understand why it didn't work on her. She gave me a beating that was worse than anything I had experienced during my boxing days. While I was completely lifeless on the floor, she took my keys and drove off in the 1992 honda civic that my dad bought me for my 25th birthday. As I was laying on the cold asphalt of the parking lot, I had started crying because I realized my pokemon card collection was still in the backseat, and also I was Forever Alone...

None of that story above happened. 

The real story was that due to the superbowl crowd and all the other sh!t going on Saturday night in Las Vegas, we literally were having a disasterific night and just needed a place to hang out. I hadn't slept in 3 days, and was so incoherent and zombified. The conversations I was having with Ife were so awkward and strange. My words were slurring and my personality was totally loserific. We found Bazic because of a review that Tien had written. Ife loves K-pop and Korean culture so we thought it might be a fun place to hang out. When we walked in, no one assumed I was Korean. I took too much after my Japanese side, and none of the servers in a million years thought I was even 1% Korean. Our server was actually really great, and I tipped quite a bit. Ife ordered this giant bottle of Orange Soju which didn't even come close to getting her buzzed, while all the other people in the club who ordered it were totally on the floor, puking their brains out. Ife is so f*cking rad! She can literally outdrink the country of Ireland. I on the other hand, being Straight Edge was sitting there and thinking to myself ""I wish I had a coke"". And then suddenly the server brought me one of those fancy ass cokes from the metal bottle. It was the happiest day of my life. Overall, it was a really great experience! Next time I'm gonna rent one of those Karoake things and invite all my yelp friends.  Can't wait to hang out with Ife again, we are going to that Commonworld(spelling ?) UYE event on Wednesday. So, if you are one of those business owners or yelpers who hate me, this is your opportunity to finally get me. You'll know me when you see me, I'm always the hottest guy in the room.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,6,10,5,5tjLzjz_WFHFTlYMVdQT1Q
5945107,2011-02-11,1,ZBkLGYOvUlmmQvkvp7AHHA,"what can i say about bazic?  it's like a korean bar on steroids taking xanax while pounding soju.

their take on korean pub cuisine puts NYC ktown bars to shame. i wouldn't mind having a coronary if i could eat their crazy fried chicken every day.

i'll never forget my experience at this spot, or the day after. vegas baby!",6vwQZZC8ySFuENqFJVeZWA,3,2,5,Ha5lzWAlus9NvJWUMmyj9Q
