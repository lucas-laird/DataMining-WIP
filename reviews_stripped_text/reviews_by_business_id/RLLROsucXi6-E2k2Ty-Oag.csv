204602,2016-02-12,0,RLLROsucXi6-E2k2Ty-Oag,It's convenient to order from this location but now I will drive a few more miles to get some better customer service. The employees here could care less about their jobs and same with the manager. They get orders wrong and if they mess up your order you're responsible to drive back with the food so they could make another order without any refund or discount. Very dirty and unsanitary.,rVlt3l8Kf0lSYh8oL_RzwQ,1,0,1,d5PNa8HFwjt9UfUI3yZBGQ

The pizza was hot and the ingredients fresh and tasty.  What puts Papa John's above other takeout pizzas is the slightly sweet sauce they use.

1524020,2016-12-07,0,RLLROsucXi6-E2k2Ty-Oag,"I can see why this location only has two stars I would give it a negative -5 if I could. 

I walked at about 3pm to get a menu and noticed how dirty the place was. The Prep Station where they make the pizza was filthy all kind of stuff all over the counter.

There were pizza boxes all over the place left right everywhere, the fire department should come in and do an inspection that bad.  

The place would be closed if the health department came in. I would never recommend ordering anything from Papa Johns especially seeing the 2 star rating.
 
Corporate should come in and redo the whole place and train everyone there.

However, we frequent the other local spots too due to the problems at this location: They arent part of the other locations so those discounts dont apply, you have to order online to get through and make sure the order is right, they never seem to add extra cheese no matter how you order (adding 3 cheese or extra cheese as a topping doesnt work), and there is not enough cheese on pan pizza. On the positive side, they deliver quickly and the lady delivery driver is awesome. We will keep ordering as my 5 kids prefer it to the designer pizzas elsewhere, but I wish they would start managing better.",-3ViiZlPJTqMFgaDvl7m4g,0,0,2,BfOi2d6n9XgAVQkPyEJEsA
1606539,2013-09-15,5,RLLROsucXi6-E2k2Ty-Oag,"Why am I giving another pizza chain a 5 star review? Because they have a rewards program then keep earning me free pizzas that actually do taste good. I order online and every time you order papa point accumulate. It only works if you order online for the papa points. Not only do I earn points when I order but they just randomly give me enough points for a free pizza for ordering. Once over super bowl last year I did a coin toss online and guess correct so they gave me a free large 3 topping pizza then too. They also often have a promotion where when you buy a pizza online you get a free pizza on your next order.

I usually always pick up my order because I feel like a lazy ass having them deliver me free food. I still give a tip as a thanks. They always open my pizza and show it to me to make sure it is right. The pizza here is good and the ingredients are fresh. the crust is tasty and goes well with the free garlic butter in each pizza box.

Stay away from the chicken poppers. They are gross and taste like something you got from the cafeteria in grade school. Maybe worse.",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,7,6,5,-lS5vj7mG8Y76Yk3ztLelw

Problem was....... I have 2 hungry 8 year old boys bugging me for food and it doesn't arrive until after 90 minutes (How does it take 30 minutes to ""Box"" pizzas?). Not to my surprise, it arrives cold, stale and lacked toppings.

I walked into this location and as I was opening the door the cashier look at me in the face,  laugh and walked away to pretend that he was busy with a pencil.  Seriously?  So this was on our second time visiting this location because when I originally picked up my order they forgot to provide me with everything that i had paid for.  I called and was informed that i could stop by, pick up the purchased product, and to compensate for the inconvenience they would give me a free two litter of soda. So I drove all the way back later and was greeted with the nonsense as other employees were laughing at the cashiers behavior. I picked up my purchased product and didn't even bother with the free soda. If rather drive 10 miles than to continue giving this location ANY of my money.

Their online ordering system confirms that you will get your pizza before their real location even opens and knows how many orders that they have for the lunch rush. If you call because your pizza is over 45 minutes late, you get attitude--maybe because others have been calling with the same problem. Use another location.

Ordered half bbq wings and half buffalo easy right. Okay after an hour the driver gets to the house all the wings are buffalo. Okay no big deal maybe they will give me a discount oh no that was to much to ask for mind you my 6 old son can't have buffalo but who cares. The manager called me a liar and said I never in formed her and only the distract manager could discount.  Really geez I guess we were born yesterday.  I've worked for a pizza place don't give me that then she told me to give the food back to the driver. Or pay full price since I didn't want a credit. Can I say customer service.

I just called and before I ordered I verified whether they had my credit.  The lady said no and transferred me to the manager.  

The manager could've nicely said that the other restaurant wasn't authorized to give me a credit but he was a total a$$hole.

If you don't tip, then they go back to what they're doing and make you wait.  

Also, what's up with the delivery drivers parking in the handicap parking spots.  I'm watching people who legitimately have the right to park there to go either Big Lots, the dry cleaners, or Papa Johns, and they have to park across the parking lot and walk through traffic to get to where they need to be.

Without fail, it takes three to four phone calls to actually get through to someone to place an order. Then most of the time I get thrown on hold for over 15mins or even hung up on. I live in a two mile radius of this store and delivery takes a good hour to an hour and half.

Not sure what the deal is here but this store never seems to have a line up out front, so I'm a little confused as to why they struggle.

When we get the pizza it's actually not so bad.

Was told it would be 7 min to make the pizza and 7 min in the oven. Then would make it out on the next driver.
