I've never had a problem with my bagel to cream cheese ratio, but my bagel was not even covered with a thin layer. I went to ask for more and the cranky girl behind the counter said I would have to pay extra... 
Plus, there were hardly any bagels left and it was only 10am!

A few weeks ago, I called in a day ahead for 2 dozen pre-selected bagels, shmears, and coffee. I even called back to make a change and Tiffany was really sweet when I apologized for having to call back. When I stopped by the next day on Saturday, my order was ready and correct - and everyone was very friendly.  I just went back today with a coupon I got in my email, and yes, it took a little longer than the last time, but more than reasonable considering the volume. I think it was Emily who helped me, and even when the coupon I printed wouldn't scan, she kept her cool and got it taken care of, all the while still being sweet and smiling.  This isn't a boutique bagel shop where the ratio of workers to customers is 2:1 or anything like that!  This is high volume, and must be stressful to manage and work in. Is it perfect? No, but for what kind of business it is, I have to give them 5 stars for their hard work and friendliness despite many customers who expect things in under 5 mins and for everyone to act like they're working in Disneyland.  It's not realistic. I'm not downplaying that people might not have had poor experiences, but if you haven't worked in high volume retail or food service settings, you don't know what it's actually like to be that person trying to multi-task while maintaining health code standards, customer service standards, and corporate expectations, all while making not-so-awesome wages.

2592278,2017-09-26,0,RC4oyPNX3FVTCfxsDeJI6A,"Amazing bagels! If it weren't for the awful service, I would be more inclined to rate with a 4 star.

Menu:
They have a pretty wide variety of flavors that can come in bagels, sandwiches or their smears. Depending on what you get, a bagel can be as low as 2 dollars or upward to 5. 5 or more dollars for a bagel is pretty weird to me but they are delicious! What I decided to get was 2 bagels (Sesame Seed & French Toast) and 2 smears (original & honey almond). The sesame seed wasn't as impressive but the french toast bagel was so freaking tasty! Once I paired that with the honey almond smear, something changed my entire mood about the place. What was this mood? It was irritation from the service.

Service:
Granted, not every employee was horrible, but the ones at the registers definitely were! First of all, that little process they have is completely redundant and causes them a lot of confusion. I placed my order at one register and was told to pay at another. Once I got to that one, the woman did not know what my order was so we had to go down a list of like 12(her words). When we got to my order, there was a mistake; I asked for the smear to be on the side but the man at the first registered forgot to put it in. She immediately got irritated for having to change one tiny thing... and it wasn't like the bagel was already made or anything.

I would definitely try it again, at a different location.",BwVuXyUaB5vk3l6upF3GrQ,0,0,3,V_uAvklc01rjOcCRxMJezQ

Sometimes they taste like they were just thrown together.  There flavors aren't balanced.  The dining room can get a little messy but it is very small and probably just can't handle the rush volume.  The staff is generally very pleasant.  I usually go a little later in the day so there is usually less of a selection.  However I have noticed this with multiple locations and it is expected.  The cream cheese flavors are good.  I'm a fan of the pretzel bagel with garlic and herb cream cheese or the hashbrown bagel with smoked salmon cream cheese.

Years later, I got pregnant and I thought that I had to give up my delicious cream cheese shmear. Soon-to-be moms are limited to cheeses that are fully melted or made of pasteurized milk and you wouldn't how difficult it is to find cheeses that have been labeled with this information. You'll see on einstein's shmear tubs that their cream cheese is made of pasteurized milk. It's delicious and preggie friendly. Their tubs are also made of plastics that are bpa/hazardous free (not numbers 3, 6 and 7 which are known to cause miscarriages).

To top off this exciting news, I lost my phone today at Einstein bagel and you wouldn't believe how helpful they were. They took my information and let me know that they would contact me after they check the cameras. Luckily one of the employees was able to find my phone in the back.

With that said, this place is just like Noah's, in that it's a chain with that super sleek, clean and impersonal feel.  If I lived nearby, it would seriously deter me from becoming a regular.  It's not bad, but it's too inorganic with too few crotchety old guys hanging out front bitching about how much better things used to be.

However, they make up for it with the fact that they aren't Noah's, and they actually sell pretty good bagels.  Not great bagels, but pretty darn good.

I stopped here a few times while in town a few weeks ago.  I liked some of the varieties of flavors, and they've got some pretty good spreads.  The lox and cream cheese didn't need the capers since the lox is already plenty salty enough.

Oh yeah... the staff was very good.  Very friendly, very personable.  I was impressed.

So, the next time I'm in town, I'll surely go again, not for a great love of this place, but because they have good enough bagels, and I am thoroughly addicted to bagels in general.",M52x7rxBwpH6luf4SOxw0Q,2,1,3,kwlHl5wzMwVa2_8-Vg7Tvg

This location has been a quick breakfast stop for the wife and I since we moved to this part of town. I haven't had any problems with the quality of food at this location, but literally every time I go into this store, the same people are working, and they are always grumpy. It doesn't matter if its busy or slow, they are grumpy and running around like they have their heads cut off. 
Like I said, I've not had a problem with the food, but the service isn't up to snuff because of the attitudes of the staff. I can't say I won't come back, because I know I will, some days start better with a Spicy Elmo and a cup of their Fair Trade coffee...but if I can find another quick breakfast spot in the area, I will be a happy man.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,2,0,2,RYe2t709kn7tJmfjcdRzqw

I do like the selection of bagels Einstein offers, and they are pretty good
I only rated the place 2 stars because of the workers

I went in around 8am, so well after the morning office rush, so the place was not busy at all.
There were 2 girls behind the counter for ordering, neither acknowledged me even being there?
Like they were real busy??? doing what???? so I asked one of them, who seemed to be bothered for a few different bagels....I should have apologized for making her actually do a bit of work....b*tch.

so after making my selection, I went to the cashier.  Now this numbnuts was busy doing something on his CELL PHONE, and didn't look up til he was done.  GEE, sorry for being such a bother guy, but I just wanted to pay??? Joked with him about the dog bagels at the register too....zero sense of humor.

Nothing worse that poor/bad customer service.  Even a decent product will not overcome such rudeness.  Definitely will not return to this location, will just stick to Ronald's Donuts from now on!!!!",XnI-AHs6Sf323o913vXObg,3,3,2,2ZuQ5Myr8anGaHSnEkqKPg

On this most recent visit, this particular location was out of Lox so they improvised and used some of the retail stuff instead. It was a nice gesture, but just didn't quite taste the same.

The salmon was a little bit too much portion wise for me and the cream cheese was pretty skimpy. I felt the ingredients just didn't mesh together like they normally do. The service though was great, super friendly workers and relatively quick.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,2,0,3,Cnuf5p05rwEQENBxCBa97Q

During the fall, they have delicious offerings like Pumpkin Walnut Gourmet Bagel and Pumpkin Shmear (YUM!), adding to the fun.

At my house, they never make it past the first day.  But I've managed to hide a bagel and it stayed fresh and soft for at least a day and a half.
My only complaint, if you could call it that, is that because they are soooo soft, they get smushed in the bag.  OY.  To complain is human.

He was helped by a different girl, who's name I unfortunately did not get. She yelled out ""Phil, your bagels are done"" and the man behind my husband informed her he was Phil but that he hadn't ordered a half dozen.
