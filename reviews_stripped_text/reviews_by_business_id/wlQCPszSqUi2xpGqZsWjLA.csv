The food. My friend had 2 eggs over easy with bacon and hash brown. There isn't a lot that could go wrong with an order like that and it was well presented. I went for the Biscuits Brisket Benedict with red potatoes. Very bland Hollandaise sauce, potatoes were, potatoes and the brisket some thin sliced deli meat with lots of fat.

Service was excellent once again, food came out quick, portion is generous. Only complaint is that the bacon was overcooked and dry but my focus was on the biscuits anyway. They were tall and had a nice light texture. Gravy was ""ok"" and probably ""great"" to some but I've grown up with homemade country-style peppered gravy and this wasn't it. I added s&p and it was good.

My fav part of the meal however was the biscuit with fresh raspberry jam/jelly/preserves (been meaning to look up the difference but this one was thinner with the seeds). A tasty finish to my brunch!",0qka5xnvBpBm7ZfGsU9oCg,2,1,4,9UAvJLs0sreouz1DMh75CQ

Bad decision...not sure if they were understaffed or just couldn't handle the amount of customers, but it took 40 minutes for our food to come to our table. I ordered corned beef hash with eggs over easy - the whites of the eggs were not cooked - the white part was still raw and runny. When I told our waitress, she asked what I would like her to do, did I want more eggs?? Seemed like an odd question - of course I wanted eggs that were cooked! Instead of taking my plate and bringing it back with cooked eggs, she just brought me two more eggs. The silverware that comes wrapped in the napkin contained a dirty spoon, but that's what I had to scoop the raw egg off my plate and replace with the cooked egg. Disgusting...When we went to pay our bill, the young man at the register asked us how everything was. We told him about the uncooked egg. His response was unsympathetic (similar to our waitress) - said ""that's too bad"". Really??? A restaurant that wants my business would have handled this entirely differently - maybe taken my plate and brought back a fresh one, maybe offered some compensation on the bill, maybe cared that it wasn't a quality dining experience...We won't be returning.

He took our order and brought it but unfortunately our drinks and refills were left up to the hostess/cashier girl. She never came by to offer refills. When we did flag our waiter down for more drinks after leaving our empty glasses on the edge of the table for awhile, he passed the task on to her and she forgot and brought it towards the end of our meal and it was very frustrating.

When we walked in we waited about 5 minutes before anyone greeted us.  A server finally came out of the dining area to seat us.
It took an hour before we finally got our food.  Server said that our ticket was lost.  Other customers that came in after us had finished their meals and left before we got our food.
When we finally got our food it wasn't what we ordered.  One entree completely wrong and another one incomplete.
Very slow refills.
Had to wait on our check.
Cashier asked how our meal was and I said not very good.  He never said anything - no apologies - nothing!
Never saw a Manager or Owner during our visit.   Maybe that is part of the problem.
I left the server a tip only because I know that she  needs them to make a living.
Taking care of the customer is definitely not important here!  We always try to support small businesses but they have to at least try to take care of their customers.

My husband ordered a veggie breakfast burrito and when they delivered the food it looked so tasty and filling, but the veggies made it so watery and was near impossible for my husband to eat it! I tried my sister-in-laws veggie omelet and it tasted as if they cooked the veggies better in hers because the veggies did not water down the eggs.

I'll say this, the amount of food you get here is insane. I can never finish anything. My favorite part of the meal are the great biscuits that come with butter & a variety of jams, best ones are the strawberry & raspberry. 

The service is always extremely friendly & I love the fresh OJ they serve. My man really likes this place & it's literally across the street from our home so it's always very convenient. 

My food isn't always cooked the way I like. For starters the potatoes tend to have softer & harder bites. Slice them up more evenly & that'll allow them to cook the right way. My bacon tends to come out on the very crispy side and I've asked them to not do so. Lastly I get my eggs over medium & always find the white parts still gooey.

1729408,2014-08-12,10,wlQCPszSqUi2xpGqZsWjLA,"Any place with breakfast tacos on the menu automatically garners my immediate attention. Growing up in Texas, bfast tacos are a diet staple but outside those state lines you can only find breakfast burritos- which are totally NOT the same thing. At all. 

Plate here includes two massive tacos on double-layer corn, with options to add sausage, chorizo, or bacon to your eggs, cheese is included and condiments of sour cream and salsa are provided. You also get a potato side (reds or browns).
Huge portion: tortillas were overflowing, removed over half the filling before I could even pick up the tacos to eat properly (not a complaint!), and the corn tortillas held up so well that I was able to stick to a single layer and used the extras to make additional tacos with the overflow!
Not following? You can easily make 4 good sized tacos with this plate.

Chicken fajita omelet is a good pick too- potato side and bread side included (toast, english muffin, or biscuit). Servers have no problem with substitutions, and easily changed out my bell peppers for extra mushrooms. Sadly, the mushrooms seemed canned, but there as a more than generous portion of veggies in the dish. Hashbrowns were undercooked, but we didn't come close to finishing.

Now for my gripe. You're the BISCUIT Café- not the breakfast taco café, not the omelet cafe. The biscuits here were lackluster and dismal, with little taste and an oddly crunchy exterior. Fluffy interior was great and the raspberry jam we received was off the charts, but when we ordered a side of gravy ... well, that was bad, too. Virtually tasteless and gluey, like a poorly made box mix. 

I didn't expect the breakfast tacos to knock it out of the park like they did (highly recommend the bacon and chorizo), but to fail at making your namesake dish? Really bummed by that.

-good food to price ration- a breakfast is like 10 dollars and is more food than I can eat in one setting. Meals come with eggs, potatoes, and pancakes in addition to your main entree item. Its a solid deal

-Brisket Benedict - this is a special that is only available sometime but if it is snatch it up

-Country fried steak- one of my all time favorites and its good here- excellent gravy

They told me it would take 20 minutes. I arrive 30 minutes later to find out they forgot to put my order in.

You guys didn't put in my order and you have the nerve to give me an attitude? While I was waiting for my food to be cooked, I heard the phone ring and that same waitress said to her co-worker ""I'm not picking it up, I already took two phone orders."" Is she kidding me? She works there! And it was a busy Saturday morning.

The manager was really friendly, and told me it'll take a few more minutes because the order wasn't put it in. By that point, especially after dealing with that waitress, the least she could've done was give me something on the house. 

Finally got my food after waiting 30 minutes. When I got home, there was a long and short strand of black hair on my french toast. I was too annoyed and tired to call back and complain about it, and I doubt they would've done anything about it anyway.

My girlfriend told me about a place called Biscuits Cafe after she saw it on Yelp. We made a mistake and tried it out.

We were one of the few tables that actually had customers, and yet drink and ordering times were slightly ridiculous. On top of that, our table was dirty when we sat down. We asked the waitress to clean it and she did (half-assedly) as it remained dirty. When she left and did not come back for 20 minutes, we asked the bus boy if he could clean it. He did (half-assedly) as it still remained dirty. We eventually received our food. I think I had french toast and eggs of some sort. It didn't really matter, because it was plain, tasteless and just not very memorable.

2302946,2015-05-02,2,wlQCPszSqUi2xpGqZsWjLA,"I go here for breakfast once a week (usually on a weekend) with my boyfriend. We started going here just because it wasn't as crowded as other breakfast places. Waiting for a table at a restaurant is the bane of existence, I would rather just leave and eat somewhere else 99% of the time. Also, I always want a booth because I hate sitting at tables- and this place almost always has a booth for me. The food for the first few weeks was just average, decent breakfast food. Then about two weeks ago we tried the bacon breakfast tacos. Pretty good!! They are seriously simple, but so delicious. Try them if you ever go here!

There are a few things I would like to see changed. 
1) I always order a coffee and a water, and my water comes in this dinky little blue plastic ""childrens"" looking cup. This has always been surprising to me because it is not like I am ordering water in place of buying a drink. I am buying a drink too, so give me a real water. It bothers me every time, I just can't figure out why the policy would be to give people who want water and coffee a shot of water. I want a real cup with a lemon!

2) It is always really bright. I think some kind of window coverings would be nice, maybe just some see through screens to dim it mildly. Sometimes I wear my sunglasses inside this place. 

3) I think some people who work there are confused about their rewards system. The first person who explained it to me said that rewards you earn with points don't expire. This makes sense, because it's basically a ""spend X get X free"" system. Then the other day we went in and had a birthday reward and a points reward, and the girl told us we should use the points reward because it expires. In actuality, the birthday reward should be the one that expires as it is only good for the month that it is your birthday - which was ending soon. If I had used the points reward like she wanted me to, I would have lost the birthday reward all together. As far as I am aware right now, points rewards don't expire. I could be wrong- but I would hope they would put it in an email or something if they do expire so we know when. Either I have to be reeducated or someone on the staff does. I don't really care which of us is wrong but I don't like the confusion.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,5,3,4,rUP_m_Q0GPS6JMoTzE6OIA

2641253,2015-01-14,8,wlQCPszSqUi2xpGqZsWjLA,"Guys, today I had the most amazing thing ever! Cinnamon roll french toast. Let that sink in for a little bit. Brunch changer! 

Imagine this: 2 giant house baked cinnamon rolls, flattened, dunked into a special egg batter and then griddle'd up like classic french toast, but the end results are wild! 

I never knew that I desired some crunch on my french toast, but the crispy parts on these french toast were absolutely phenomenal. Plus, my teeth appreciated that it wasn't overly sweet. 

You also have a choice of bacon, ham, or sausage and 2 eggs any style. I requested to have my bacon extra crispy and they made it perfect! The price of $10.59 is not bad for the amount food that you get; It's enough to cover your breakfast for 2 days! 

On other occasions, I have also tried their Sweet Potato Pancake Combo $10.59 - 3 large and moist sweet potato pancakes, with your choice of bacon, ham or sausage and also 2 eggs. I chose sausage and 2 sunny eggs. Everything was perfect and I also really enjoyed the subtle natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes in the pancakes. The pancakes are different and I like that option. Flavor rating: 4/5

Smoked Brisket Benedict $10.59 - The brisket is tender and adds a great variety to the world of Benedicts. However, the meat failed to have presence in flavor and was lost in the hollandaise sauce. Flavor rating: 3/5

Country Benedict $10.59 - a country classic crowd pleaser. I felt that the sausage gravy had a slight watery consistency, but my date didn't have any complaints. You really can't pass the giant portions. It's truly enough to feed 3 adults comfortably. Flavor rating: 3/5

Biscuit and Gravy - They are called biscuits cafe, it only makes sense to try it! I really enjoy their homemade thick and creamy gravy with sausage bits. However, their biscuits were a little dense for our preference. I found that soaking the biscuits in the gravy longer until they soften, is an ideal way to enjoy this dish. Flavor rating: 4/5 

P.S. If you don't like soggy hash-browns (like me) I would suggest requesting to have them extra crispy! 

The bustling diner feel is charming and cozy; it's a real local's joint. I also really appreciate the wholehearted honesty of our waitress when she gave us her opinion on certain menu items - she really knows her food!

The prices are competitive and the portions are indulgent. These portions were meant to be shared. Bring your appetite and leave your boring toast at home.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,10,9,5,NQ_E-S1bhjWpvCIWKIMmBg

2703431,2017-04-22,5,wlQCPszSqUi2xpGqZsWjLA,"Get to know this place!  Biscuits Cafe is a breakfast and lunch place featuring home style cooking and which is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest.  However, they also have some locations in the Sunbelt, such as this one on Las Vegas's west side.

I was given a Biscuits gift certificate and, instead of using it locally, I used it at this location.  This Biscuits is in a dime a dozen strip mall off of Sahara where the tenants are now but a blur.  What I do remember is that there was plenty of parking.  I also remember that, while close to Summerlin, it was not at all like Summerlin, though that fancy high rise residential tower was fairly close by.  It was on one of the major brash thoroughfares with three lanes in each direction, with lots of retail, and with people driving briskly, as is often the case here.

While a Biscuits in some place like the Pacific Northwest may choose to be homey because the area sort of likes that vibe, this one in Las Vegas is spacious, comfortable, clean, and awash in natural light.

And, because I surmised that they might do breakfast well and to get more mileage from the funds on my gift certificate, my friend and I went for breakfast platters at approximately the lunch hour.  That was a good decision.

The breakfast platters were very good, featuring traditional staples and with ""plenty of meat on their bones,"" figuratively speaking.  Breakfast food can be heavy and sort of bog you down.  Here, it was filling without doing that.  I don't know how the kitchen would ""lighten up"" the breakfast fare, but it hit the sweet spot.

The service was amicable and casual.  We got to sit were we wanted.  The air conditioning worked like a charm and, in addition to our beverages, our glasses of water were also kept filled.

The experience at this Biscuits was essentially seamless on all levels.  They know how to put together a good breakfast.  I'm betting that they also know how to put together a good lunch.  I wouldn't mind finding out.",_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,5,7,4,5h7sOywykClN2fvbLliNGA

The Bad:

Too toasted bread, I ended up scratch the corner of my lip trying to bite into it.

Parts of the bacon were so hard I literally could not bite into it. 

The fries tasted like fries you would get from the freezer section at Walmart and bake at home and they didn't cook all the way. 

The Good:

Good Service
Not extremely packed 
Variety of options
Fresh vegetables-on a BLT having fresh lettuce and tomato is key and they had it. 

I may give them a second chance eating , but I definitely ordering  some of their biscuits to go as I am eager to try their namesake.",nzOooOkkeESGC_HGXWYWeg,0,0,3,wKnLPa_bw1UfM-oiRsn03A

I would really suggest trying them if you're a fan of that! The eggs and really anything we've tried is very good, and they really do cater to your specific preferences. I personally am not all that crazy about breakfast but they have a ""keep it simple"" section on their menu! The service is good, they are always nice and they are efficient.

Ordered steak and eggs over easy with hash browns with a biscuit. First off the steak wash not even cooked it had zero seasoning at all, I guess they cook it on the flat top she said with no seasoning. Rise and Shine in Summerlin has way better steak! No grill marks wtf! I had to send it back, next the hash brows had no flavor, I get they are simple but how do you mess that up ? Anyways asked for sausage links instead, brought me patties. So basically didn't eat meat I asked to remove the meat all together as soon as I saw, which they did. As for my boyfriends his cheesy eggs looked like liquid disgusting. I think my 5 year old could do a better job. I told the person checking us out how horrible my meal  was, you would think she would remove it. Clearly they don't care!

My friend and I came in for breakfast. There was only one other customer there and one waitress. The waitress was having a full on conversation with this customer. We waited for about 5 minutes. We were just ignored. We finally just sat down. This waitress continued her conversation for another 10 minutes. Then finally came over gave us menus, went back to her conversation for another 10 minutes. I wanted to leave, but my friend wanted to wait. We finally got served. The food was good. I decided to give it another try today. It's close to the house. Same friend. We went. They were busy. We were seated right away. Good sign, right! Nope. We were waiting for literally about 15 minutes to give our order. This entire time the manager was standing in the isle beside me talking to the people behind us. She was loud! We had to hear about her daughter's college, how she shops at Walmart, what kind of snacks her daughter wants for college. On and on she went! We shot her a few looks like, first of all, can you take our order and 2. can you shut up? She was literally giving me a headache. I don't know who these people were, the owners or frequent customers, but it was ridiculous! You want to talk, sit down and talk. Don't yell out your business in my ear!! Better yet, do your job and make sure customers are taken care of! Then the waitress who brought our food finally came to see if we wanted more coffee. Our cups were empty so of course we said yes. Instead of going to get the coffee to fill our empty cups that she's neglected, she starts chatting up the same people behind us! The manager had finally stepped away for a moment comes back and starts again, now she has pictures on her phone! So now we have the two of them yakking! My friend finally interrupted and asked her to get the coffee.  This was not an enjoyable experience to say the least. Then we get to the register. My friend pays the bill. The boy running the register punched a wrong button and had to make change the old fashioned educated way, using your brain! Well, he couldn't manage that and my friend had to tell him what the change is. Needless to say, I will never go back there and I will definitely pass on my experience to others. I can't imagine how this place stays in business. If you like slow service and want to know more about strangers than you ever cared to, then this is the place for you!

We went in for breakfast around 10:00 AM on Sunday morning and it was busy, but not packed. We were quickly seated in a large booth and served coffee right away in an oversized coffee mug. We didn't have to wait too long before our waitress took our orders.

The menu had great selections for breakfast and of course their specialty...biscuits & gravy. I ordered the  Black Oak Kielbasa that came with two eggs, choice of hash browns or red potatoes and choice of biscuits, toast or pancakes. I had my eggs over easy, hash browns and of course biscuits. When my food arrived I was pleased that the food was prepared just right. The biscuits were very warm and seemed fresh out of the oven. The Kielbasa was tasty and the biscuits were definitely good! 

Overall, my friend and I enjoyed our breakfast...we had no complaints with either the food or service. The restaurant set-up was very spacious, bright and clean. They even have newspapers available for the customers to read. In addition, it's located in a nice area of town in a strip mall...so parking is plentiful & convenient. Check out the photos I posted...

As a side note, we liked it enough that we went back the following day for breakfast again...we were in the area & it was just convenient. It was a Monday morning around 9:00 AM.

If you're a healthy eater, or salad fan, they have great salad menu with really generous portions. In favor of being healthful, get the dressing on the side. My favorite is the SW Chicken salad. 

This place is a real gem, especially because of the newness and cleanliness. My theory is, once they get on google maps, and discovered by more locals, they will blow up, and then there may be a weekend wait. 

I'm docking a star because I had the personal kielbasa breakfast sausage one time, and it was so salty it practically wasn't edible. I think it might have been a fluke though, and that's not something I normally order. 

They have a super friendly and robust staff. Everyone has the attitude, ""I'll get it done for you"", which I think is important especially on crowded weekend mornings.

3167824,2014-07-26,5,wlQCPszSqUi2xpGqZsWjLA,"I gotta say, my initial impression of this place wasn't a good one. We walked in just after noon and found only 2 other tables in the entire place to be occupied. Then when we got seated, we had a super weird start where we basically got juggled around with 3 separate waiters/waitresses coming up to our table. Luckily, it was smooth sailing after that and I was extremely surprised with Biscuits Café.

The restaurant itself is located on the SE corner of Sahara & Durango. Inside, they've got a really big, spacious dining room and they seem to be doing a great job of keeping it clean and organized. Instead of getting too into detail on what it looks like, I'll shamelessly plug my first opportunity to try out the Yelp video function. ;) *Although you might have to go to the business photos on the mobile app to find it*

As far as the food goes, they have a fairly large menu with choices for both breakfast and lunch. I ended up going with the Zesty Chorizo omelette and was really impressed. The chorizo was cooked perfectly, had great flavor and just the right amount of spicy heat. All the other ingredients were fresh and aside from tasting great, the portions are huge. They literally put what looked to be an entire avocado inside the omelette and it's served with a side of your choice, and biscuits. The salsa appeared to be fresh made and was easily one of the best I've had in a breakfast joint. My only complaint on my plate would be the potatoes. They were cooked well and also served as a huge portion, but they were lacking in salt. If I were to order this omelette again though, I'd ask for extra cheese. 

Now, with a name like Biscuits Café...they better have some good biscuits! Were they the best I've ever had? Probably not. But they are solid and in my opinion, far superior to what you'll find in most other restaurants in town. Buttery, flaky and served with both fresh butter and jam. You can tell they are fresh made every day and even though I'm not usually one to get biscuits for breakfast, I'd make sure to get one every time I'm here. Biscuits and gravy fans will love the version here.

Aside from the weird start, the customer service is great too. I could be wrong, but it looks like a family run joint and even if they aren't, you can tell they put a lot of love into their food. As others have mentioned, it's only a matter of time before this place starts getting busy and you're waiting for a table. It may have started off bad and a dead restaurant at peak times, is almost always a red flag...but Biscuits Café is serving up huge portions of killer food at great prices, and I'll happily be a repeat customer!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,5,4,4,q1tP_pcTIJD8LgpgUlZN_A

I had a western scramble, with red potatoes and pancakes.  Meal was delicious and it was served with a few small tortillas which was unexpected but loved them.  Pancakes were also yummy.  Coffee refills were coming around frequently which was nice.
Only thing I would recommend was that the manager should spend more time table touching or checking on the customers instead of micro managing her staff.

My dining experience at BC was a home run. My only regret was that I did not try the coffee which would have made my review complete. I will definitely have to go back and include an addendum.

A colleague of mine and I hit up BC for a quick bite while on lunch break. When we walked in I quickly noticed the place felt fresh. All of the decor was simplistic, clean and appeared new. I was very surprised at how big the restaurant was as well. We were quickly greeted by one of the smiling waitresses and seated. I opted for the Country Benedict and my colleague went for the Chicken Fried Chicken. When our entrees arrived I could not believe the portion sizes that were heaved onto our plates! There was probably enough gravy on my plate to fill my water cup. No complaints here! The quality of the food was par for my expectations and my colleague's as well, and the price seemed just right. The servers were also really on top of their game and not overly attentive.

Sweet, cinnamon filled, doughy and delicious, there's enough sweetness without being overpowering. The portion is large and included eggs and bacon. You'll probably skip lunch after eating it.

My kid's order of chocolate chip pancakes ($4.99) was obscene. Way more than any nine year old needs to eat. It's two large buttermilk pancakes full of Ghiardelli chips with whipped cream and chocolate syrup on top.

Service was a little slow even with the place nearly empty early in the morning. But, that was the only downside to our meal.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,4,4,c_VC0bswKKAU5foKSu8uGA

More than 2 employees for every table, your kidding me.  Additional  5 employees sitting on break in dining room.  Order given, asked server (who is always friendly we get her alot) looks like u are the only server, she says yes it does... what are the other 7 doing?  Neglecting customers and dirty tables - l9ts of hanging around and talking.  NOTE:  we were not the only ones grumbling and shaking our heads as the SO OBVIOUS  lack of direction, leadership, organization, total disfunction.  By now 10 tables total in the dining room, at one point 6 needed to order WITH 14 employees on the floor.  Now maybe some were getting ready to go home but seriously who goes home when the dining room is dirty, in disarray, and customers are being neglected... leadership promotion of teamwork  NOT HERE... but to be expected by the middle aged hag of a general manager.  We were treated so rudely by this woman.  I am embarrassed for this restaurant to have such poor representation of management and leadership with one of those rude people who smile and say have a nice day with a lot of disgust and dismissal and keeps on walking away hiding behind that sarcastic have a nice day... like we all haven't seen that move before, no academy award for her performance... should be completely ashamed of herself for her unprofessional behavior  and shortness at her age she should know better, but based on the leadership that was nowhere to be seen it makes sense.   Our food arrived at 1:45.  Open kitchen showed a breakdown occurring and french fries were barely warm and soggy and chili not warm.  Food dumped on us server rushed off, no soda refill  (half empty) no extra napkins,  no check back... gosh 14 employees and thus server is buried.  Got up and walked food back to kitchen to be fixed myself.  10 minutes later new fries arrive on a tiny plate while eating sandwich off a napkin, no offer for another plate or napkins or refill.  Now fries are hot, but white and raw and our sandwiches are cold.  Wave server down to say, we don't want this food, in a disappointing way not rudely, she needs to get manager.  She arrived and the rest is history.  What's the problem.  Not a hello, my name is... we respond we don't want this food (sandwich has 2 bites so don't think anything else) we brought u new fries (ok, so u knew already we had an issue and said come on don't play that game) ya but they are raw we respond... ok, have a nice day... but she really meant ok, go F-OFF ... you'd have to be deaf and blind not to know what she meant.  And she abruptly walks away, our reply you are being rude... HAVE A NICE DAY as she runs her passive aggressive poor excuse of a manager self back to hide in the kitchen where she was planted from the time we arrived.

Not the first time we had a poor experience but the last.  DON'T GO HERE!  and if you do, tell the manager she should be in uniform not her ugly street clothes she always wears.  Tell the young blonde we don't need cleavage in our face it's vegas yes but this is a breakfast joint not Hooters.  Tell the cashier that you are suppose to smile and walk faster than my 90 year old grandmother in a walker.  

No wonder this place sits half empty at all hours when other places have a line out the door.  ONE REASON ONLY - YOUR GENERAL MANAGER.  With 25 yrs food and beverage experience, we speak with experience.  

Watch your camera footage and pull labor reports if you don't believe me.  Shame on you for treating  us this way and ruining Father's day.  Hope u r proud of yourself.",5dlicDH2o5XvO6Kj2c4s1A,6,0,1,nNQKa5LGUCAtwiVFGw3rLA

So I decided to stop by here for breakfast and was hesitant to try this breakfast place because of the mixed reviews of fellow Yelpers. However, I stumbled across Antonia M. review and she mentioned the best item is their Cinnamon Roll French Toast plate. By now, your probably wondering...why did Marlon got this particular item when clearly it's called Biscuits Cafe. First and foremost, I have a sweet tooth and anything cinnamon sugar is gonna get my attention. As my server Brenda took my order, she was very knowledgable with the menu and history of biscuits cafe. She made my visit a pleasant morning and was very attentive to my needs. Water cup was filled constantly and my black coffee with small amount of cream was filled a few times too!

Onto the my Cinnamon Roll French Toast, from presentation and to the very last bite was amazing! The French toast was soft in texture with a good amount of cinnamon flavor throughout. The best part was that it was moist and not dried out. It included your choice of eggs and bacon or sausage. Both side items were good along with the side of hash browns that I got to contrast with my French toast. I would definitely come back for this dish and to try out other items.

I was not expecting much when we pulled up, but the exterior is misleading because once you step inside this place is large, bright, and airy.  I found it very refreshing.  We stopped by closer to lunch than breakfast, so the rush was over and we were seated right away.

We ordered the Smoked Brisket Benedict  $10.59 and the Joe's Scramble $10.49.  Both were eggs-cellent (haha).

The Benny comes with mesquite smoked brisket, English Muffin, 2 poached eggs, and hollandaise with a side of hashbrowns or red potatoes.  The brisket was fantastic- tender, moist, with rich flavor.  The hollandaise flavor fell a little flat, but was okay.  Hashbrowns, standard diner fare.

The scramble comes with FOUR eggs, spinach, onions, tomatoes, bacon, potatoes (in the scramble), and parm  on top.  This thing was massive and dense and all the flavors played well off each other.  But, man, it fills you up fast because it is so hearty!  I would likely 86 the potatoes in future.  They were unnecessary (IMO).  As if the dish itself were not large enough, this scramble comes with a side of biscuits, toast, or pancakes.  Since I'm obsessed with finding the perfect pancakes, I went for those and they were pretty darn good!  Fluffy with crispy edges.

3970124,2014-04-15,7,wlQCPszSqUi2xpGqZsWjLA,"Short review:

It's an automatic fail when I come for breakfast and am there for at least 30 minutes and not once during that time did anyone come around to offer a coffee refill.  Not once.  

Longer review:

I saw Biscuits Cafe on Yelp and since it's close to home I decided I'd have to give it a go.  I wouldn't have ordered the biscuits and gravy combo but when in Rome... This is their signature, their biscuits.  The combo includes a choice of meat, I chose sausage, and two eggs any style.  I opted for over easy.

The order was done quickly.  I am not a connoisseur of biscuits and gravy.  In fact, I can't remember the last time I ordered this.  The biscuit was OK.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be house made but I'm pretty sure it wasn't.  There was nothing special about it.  The gravy was OK, too, with a hint of ground pepper.  I'm certainly glad I didn't order the breakfast with two biscuits.  The sausage was two links that were sliced horizontally and grilled.  The eggs were done over easy.

All in all, breakfast was OK.  I should have stuck with an omelette or Benedict--my usual go to breakfast dishes.  But, I'll never know what they're like because I won't be back.  

When I paid at the register, the woman asked for my member number.  When I told her I didn't have one, she asked me if I wanted to join their club.  My answer was a polite no.

People, when you have three servers covering about 7 tables, it's not hard to bring a carafe of coffee around and offer warm ups or refills.  It should be something you dream about at night.  If one of your two specialties is breakfast and you fail on service for that, there's not much hope for you.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,17,6,2,hb-Hm0y5ECpAGgbOAAkqPg

My group ordered our individual meals but shared family style so we could sample all this new place had to offer. Their corned beef was made in house and shredded. It was slightly seasoned and needed salt and pepper. I like that though since many times I have ordered and it was just too much salt.

They're sweet potato pancake was really good. Light and fluffy but not too sweet.  

My only real complaint is the gravy they use for their biscuits. It tastes more like a chowder than a gravy. It could use more sausage too.

The only local location of a small chain out of Oregon City, Biscuits Café had long been on my breakfast 'to-do' list and with a $5 voucher arriving via E-mail for my birthday I finally decided to play the West Sahara Breakfast and Lunch venue a visit, a seven o'clock arrival finding a few customers already present with the staff bright-eyed and bushy-tailed to say the very least.

Larger in size than one would anticipate from outside, the space easily capable of seating a hundred with at least half that present when I finally departed at 8:15, it was literally as I was being walked to my table that my drink order was taken and by the time I'd actually sat down a full cup of coffee was present, a glass of water joining later and both kept brimming without once requiring reminder or request.

Using their own proprietary batters, as well as coffee from Oregon's Edenway and Sunfresh Organic Jam, but for some reason taking the low-road with artificial syrup where 100% Maple would have been a far more logical choice given the otherwise high commitment to quality, the menu at Biscuits Café does little to reinvent the wheel but with many options for customization including the ""Keeping It Simple"" Pick 3 it was with little effort that a large order was crafted - the total still less than $30 before coupon, tax, or tip.

Beginning with the eponymous biscuits, a small and fluffy duo rife with buttermilk that somehow became even more poignant with the addition of butter and raspberry jam, it was these same tangy notes that highlighted a pair of fluffy hotcakes served alongside two pieces of golden-griddled bread, and as much as the custard soaked slices from Wheat Montana Farms and Bakery were indeed delicious beneath butter and Maple Syrup brought from home it was in fact the pillowy pancakes that stole the show, each bite rivaling those at DuPar's for the best 'plain Jane' Buttermilk in town.

Moving next to the Chicken and Waffles, a quartet of peppery hand-breaded tenderloins served over a crispy Belgian Waffle made with Sweet Potato batter for only $9.99, both the chicken and the waffles proved to be far better than one would have assumed for the price and with good brining to the bird plus the aforementioned spice all of the flavors really 'popped,' the savory notes a much needed departure from all the sweetness of the pancakes and waffles, not to mention the nearly 12oz Cinnamon Roll that makes the one at Mr. Mama's seem pale in comparison, the cream cheese frosting spread so thick that some simply had to be set aside to prevent it from being 'too' rich.

Setting aside the syrup 'issue' that seems to mar nearly every breakfast joint of this ilk nowadays Biscuits Café is one of those rare chains that feels entirely home grown and 'mom n' pop' in all the right ways.  Great food at a great price, smiley service that never leaves the diner for want, and a menu that executes the basics with ease while offering diners any number of ways to customize to tastes - that's a breakfast worth going out for any day of the week, not to mention the free Wi-Fi and the fact that they were playing Pearl Jam and Soundgarden while I dined.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,7,5,eP8aSIIC0W_1PUi3Uy7tcQ

""We don't serve fast food, we serve fresh food as fast as we can."" is sprawled across the wall. Biscuits Cafe delivers and they deliver it well.

Since we arrived around the noon-ish mark, I decided to give the lunch fare a go this round. I ordered the Fiesta Chicken Salad and a cup of the Tomato Basil soup. My family and I were seated right by the kitchen, which is wide open, and you can see right into (and it's immaculately clean), I saw our waitress crushing up avocado and adding ranch to it. That is how FRESH the dressing was! My sister ordered the Breakfast Burrito and subbed sausage for chorizo (with no problem) with hash browns. My mother loved the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs so much last time, she ordered it again today.

Our food came out quickly and it was all delicious. So much better than I had remember on our first visit! My soup was perfect. It wasn't overly salty and was the perfect blend of tomato and basil. My salad was not just made of iceberg and romaine, it had spinach and field greens. The salad was huge, too. I have half of it left over to enjoy later. My sister's breakfast burrito was also on point. Loaded with eggs, sausage, onions, peppers, cheese, and served with a side of sour cream and fresh salsa (which was so good, I got a side of it too for my salad - for no additional cost). It was big, filling, and delightful. My mama finally let me try their country gravy. I'm from the South. I know about Biscuits and Gravy and Biscuits Cafe is right up there with the best of them. Creamy, savory, slightly peppered. It's the country gravy that dreams are made of and is probably an old family recipe. It's REALLY that good.

Biscuits Cafe is a large space, ample seating with booths and tables alike. It's clean, open, and warm. There's really no special ambiance or decor, but it has that diner feel and is just as friendly. Customer service here was phenomenal. Our drinks were never less than half full and our orders were precise.

I never had the biscuits and gravy so that might be a popular place.  We came here two weeks ago and it was pretty good.  I ordered the bLt and it was yummy.  My husband got the pancakes and hash.  Plentiful food that day.

Sadly my visit his time was not as good.  

I ordered the steak and eggs.  The steak was cook perfectly to medium rare but there was no seasoning or any taste.  Maybe some people like it that way.  I felt that I could have made it at home much better.  We go out to eat so we don't have to cook but this encourages me to stay home and cook atleast it would taste better.  Nothing was outstanding it's just steak breakfast for like 12-3 dollars not with it.  Coffee 2.59 wow a lot of change for coffee.  It isn't even worth it.

The keep it simple for like 8.00 is not even worth it just simple like it states. 

The coffee cup was nasty it still had the sugar and cinnamon from before.  My son said the coffee is good did they put sugar in yours? I told him what sugar and then we see the dirty cup.  He thought it was part of it.  The waitress apologized nice but where the discount or one free coffee.  That would have been nice policy.

5368226,2016-08-06,1,wlQCPszSqUi2xpGqZsWjLA,"Based on today's lunch experience, disappointed. They seem to have better breakfast options than lunch...

Service was very slow in-spite of not having many tables seated. Staff and manager are all on there phones, distracted, socializing and seemingly uninterested in their jobs. While we were waiting forever to get our orders taken the manager was sitting at a table close to us playing casino games on her phone with the sound blaring.... Regardless if she was on a break.... Not appropriate for her to be sitting in the dining room playing games on her phone...

We've been here twice and it's very clear where the staff's lack of ambition drive customer service and interest comes from. 

The manager wonders about the restaurant... ""Looking busy"" but not doing anything. I've not seen here make eye contact nor acknowledge a single guest or touch on any tables.

The one table she did spend 15 minutes at were ""friends"" again socializing comparing pictures on her phone and her patrons. 

I could tell that they were simply trying to get through their meals, but she kept on showing pictures and lingering...

We got 2 cokes and after about 20 mins someone finally came over to take our order. James had the California club which I tried a bit of and liked, James being a avid Club sandwich guy, prefers the real deal, not their version.

I thought it was pretty tasty and yum, I would order that perhaps in the future.

As for my Brisket dip sandwich.... A dry small brisket tasteless with brown water as the dip... Very disappointed... I would not try it again or waste money on this sandwich... Waste of time...

The plate arrived, I looked at it it, looks boring, like the manager, passed through my mind.... 

The dipping jux, did nothing but subtract from an already bore me to sleep meal...

After 2 sips in our still full drinks our waitress asked us if we would like refills.... Uhm no were good for now thanks....

After we received our meals and had two nips on my pickle and James had no more than 2 fries, again, how is everything? Well the pickle bite was pickly thank you for asking  and the fries were well fry-y, come back and check on us when we've had chance to try the actual meal perhaps? Or not....

Combined with the service experience and the actual food... I give today's visit a barely 2 stars.... You guys have some work to do.....",X6wbOm865HPjS94-yMXT9Q,2,0,2,uf2LLax4jktJ6mGPmB3sPA

It had been a while since he looked and after my insistence, we tried it. We came early morning. Not a soul in the place but the staff. 

After looking over the menu we made our selections, for me, my usual scrambled eggs, bacon and biscuits with gravy. My husband got a scramble, ham, sausage, bacon, hash browns and biscuits with a side of sweet potato pancakes. 

The biscuits where soft and flaky. The milk gravy very good, almost like momma made! The pancakes not that good, a bit flat with no real flavor and I wouldn't try them again. 

I was really happy with the tea, I love my tea! This was a tropical fresher brewed and very fresh. I can tell when a place forgets to clean the tea spout! Or brews the tea through the coffee maker! No thank you! But their tea was really good.

Service was good, but not GREAT. They never refilled our drinks and they forgot the pancakes I ordered with my meal, so it took a while to get them and even though they were fresh when I got them, I was already pretty full.. 
Over all their food was pretty good. We got the country fried steak breakfast and the Country Omelette breakfast. I am assuming it is because we both ordered ""country"" breakfasts that 70% of our meal was smothered in gravy.. BUT it was really good gravy so I can't complain!!  I got the biscuits by accident but I tasted one with their raspberry jam, and DAMN THAT JAM WAS GOOD!! And they must KNOW they've got some damn good jam b/c they sell it by the front register.
The only issue I had with the food is that with a name like Biscuits Cafe their namesake could have been a little more.... Epic, but they were alright.. 
We've been trying to get here for breakfast since they opened a couple months ago, glad we finally did. I recommend them as a breakfast spot if you are wanting a good breakfast for reasonable prices and don't want to do a run of the mill Denny's or IHOP...",EmB8MbDkxaV0aeF96Iz_wg,2,2,4,x5PXNwh3dcd8J-xMLIuJMQ

The air is so cold I couldn't really stand it longer then I had too. Our server was nice, got our order in quickly but then at the end of our meal he was very adamant to get us out of there. He even went so far as to tell us he had to leave so we would pay, but then we were sitting there and 10 minutes later he was taking another table?? Yea that was weird and uncalled for. 

The food itself was good. I had the french toast combo, french toast was really good, eggs were average so nothing special, and sausage patties were gross I left them on the plate after trying them. My friend got the biscuits and gravy and she seemed happy with her food, but when I tried them again I was not super impressed by either the biscuits or gravy- I thought my french toast was better. So note to self- next time a place says they are known for something do not be so easily fooled.
