2140997,2017-12-20,0,2wv9ocE3VS2MbBRany2Zyw,If you're looking for charcoaled chicken this is the place to go to. This style of chicken has a Mexican style which by far the greatest and delicious chicken I've ever had. You can order by the piece and they have other things on their menu if you're not feeling the chicken. One Saturday's and Sunday's they serve pozole and menudo which I thought was super cool and not a lot of places serve these kind of dishes.,LD3iuqoMys9HAeExdgazmA,0,0,4,ESdIUoh8AZBEcil5E1Cz5A

Dishes are served with simple rice, refried beans, soft tortillas and shredded lettuce. Horchata and lots of glass sodas to choose from.

Kick it up by notches with their help yourself salsa bar and pickled veggies.
