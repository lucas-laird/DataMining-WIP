Just discovered recently how great is the cappuccino here. Definitely like caramel  flavored coffee. 
So, when you decide whether to get only coffee or something else too, this is the perfect place to try. It's located in the beautiful Downtown of Las Vegas.
Besides coffee, there are many different pastries and various entrees to choose from.
After entering into the restaurant, you get in the line to the cashiers, where the drinks and meals can be ordered, and paid for. Afterward, the cashier gives you a number, what you place on your chosen table, where you will be served by waiters or waitresses.
Pretty easy process!
I visited Rachels twice last week, while I was doing business in the Area.
Both times I ordered a Cappuccino (large) and Chocolate Cookie (warmed up), and my friend ordered a Grilled chicken  Salad. 
According to my friend, the salad wasn't too bad, but unfortunately not very good either.
I absolutely loved the cappuccino and the cookie!

1. Look at menu and have a hard time deciding between the good options.
2. Order is always taken quickly.
3. Find a table and prepare to wait a little more than you think you have to because they are making things fresh in the back. Sometimes this wait gets aggravating.

I've eaten at this Rachel's Kitchen several times since it opened a few months ago.  I generally stop in when I'm downtown for a business meeting or to meet with the City or County.  Usually I just pop in for a quick smoothie since they're so good, but twice now I've found myself there around the lunch hour.  The place has a decent lunch crowd and it seems a steady flow of people ordering take-out.  I even noticed they have little delivery bikes out front! Very cool...unique to Vegas for sure!  Anyhow, both lunches I've gotten sandwiches (once the 440 and once the curry chicken salad) and both were excellent, with the 440 being a new favorite I find myself craving.  I got sweet potato fries on the side both times.  They get em crispy here and just ever so lightly salt them with what looks to be like coarse sea salt or something like that.  Maybe I'm the only one that pays attention to things like that??

Everything I've ordered has seemed very fresh and made with good ingredients.  Maybe some of the other reviewers caught them on an off day or when they were just getting momentum, but after stopping in here about 10 times, it's been very consistent for me.

On my next trip, I hope to give the mac-n-cheese a try...I saw someone eating it and it looked great!  I'm a sucker for a good mac-n-cheese!",hMheTqz8gXt3fBAaM4SviQ,0,0,5,ZMS5iyqo6we3ILi1xerrxA

As most of you know, downtown is known for bar hopping and the famous heart attack grill. So if you're looking for some healthy refreshing food, Rachel's Kitchen is the place to go to make up for all the greasy dining! Great for vegans/vegetarians. 

I was craving some greens and needed something refreshing so I got the Spinach salad: It came with fresh baby spinach. bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, caramelized pecans & goat cheese tossed with lemon herb vinaigrette. You also have the option to add chicken or tuna. I added on the grilled chicken. The salad definitely hit the spot for me. The grilled chicken was perfect, not too dry and it went well with the goat cheese. To be honest, I'm not really a goat cheese/feta cheese kind of person, but it wasn't overwhelming as I expected it to be. There was a balance with all flavors and I appreciated that because I really don't even like dressing on my salad sometimes. 

For beverages I tried the Energizer it comes with beets, apples, carrots, lemon and ginger root. I absolutely love ginger in my juices because it always adds a ""ZING"" to the juice. I recommend this juice for people that aren't really familiar with juicing, its similar to regular juices and doesn't have that (sometimes overwhelming) green plant taste.

2202917,2017-02-27,0,xk-fOf_M39kDTgzfVgu0Tw,"TL;DR:
+  Location, freshly prepared foods
0  Gluten free options but they're not on the menu
-   Fresh juices not really ""juices"", lack of consistency in products

I was keyed up for some breakfast, but the buffet options in DTLV were just leaving me dejected.  Fired up the Yelp machine, and boom! Rachel's Kitchen pops up.  I wanted something delicious and healthy, but also was looking for some fresh juicing, as I needed to get some potassium to remedy some serious beveraging from the night before.

Imagine my surprise when it was a very short walk down the street.  Walked in, I was maybe the only person there around 8am on a Thursday.

Opted for the fresh watermelon juice and the protein lover's scramble.  I didn't see a mention of gluten-free bread or other on the menu so I told the cashier to leave the bread off.  She mentioned that they do, in fact, have GF bread, so that was nice.  The food took a bit to prepare, assuming as it's all made fresh to order. 

The scramble and potatoes were very tasty and the two slices of bread were standard GF.  I was not impressed with the watermelon ""juice"" - as it ended up being more watermelon-mash, and after the juice was gone, I had about 1/4 cup full of pulp - similar to when you get to the bottom of a slurpee and you have some thick slurpee-ice at the bottom.  I have had cold-pressed watermelon juice or even just juiced watermelon and was expecting less solid matter in my cup.

Prices were average or a bit higher, and I did enjoy the quality of food and the location - I ended up visiting twice more before I left town.  

Second visit - felt it took a longer than normal time to churn out a grilled chicken salad, but it was pretty dang good so I'll let it go.

Third visit - got the same thing as visit #1, only this time I got one slice of bread, which I didn't notice until I got back to the hotel.

Suggestions:
-Put your GF offerings on the menu, or state ""GF toast available"" or something
-More juice, less junk
-Unlike the juices, Rachel's needs more consistency in product served.",0IdfzFwxhtQd0Trs5DWWSw,0,1,4,ddGdD1wWwcC5mqmo0bu7Eg

What a joke and Rachael you should be embarrassed. You need to put more into the quality and taste of your food or your going down.  There was nothing right about what I got on my plate. What kind of fries are those ?!?!?- skinny little pre frozen shoestring fries that tasted like filmy grease and had a stale texture.

Prices are absurd, being it's the only place I know of to get a protein shake downtown, I have been known to grab one here every now and then. Things is, I get your standard banana/peanut butter protein shake and it's $8 bucks here when it's $5 at any other smoothie shop on earth. Needless to say, I've stop coming in.

I live downtown and I'm all for supporting local establishments, but when I go to a restaurant and ask an employee questions about menu item, I expect an answer, not, ""hold on, let me ask"". I hate that. Why don't you know your own menu, you only work there? 

I've had the turkey burger here, it was very forgettable, I've had an egg wrap here, it was even more forgettable. My wife has had the pancakes, i think she kinda liked it, but the other time we went together, she got the ""veggie burger"" or ""garden burger"" or whatever they call it and the patty was full of cheese tho the menu made zero attempt to make you aware of this. She ordered it without cheese. If you worked there would that raise a flag that this person doesn't want any cheese? And then wouldn't you want to make your customer who is paying $10+ dollar for a shitty meatless burger aware of the cheese riddled patty? The answer is no. Also if you worked there, you wouldn't have known about the cheese in the patty, cause no one that works there knows anything.

Walked in on a Saturday at 1pm. Three people besides myself inside the restaurant. Three employees behind the counter. I walked up to the register. I was not acknowledged or even looked at. One employee was on the phone and the other two were talking to each other with their backs to me. A minute passed and nothing. At that moment I should have realized it was going to be a bad experience. 

One employee eventually comes to the register and doesn't say ""hi"" or ""sorry for the wait"", but just says, ""for here?""  (The one on the phone still feet away never acknowledging me).  

I ordered at 1:04pm. I ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich. I sat down. At 1:28 no food or service telling me they made an error. In that time several employees from the kitchen go behind the counter and talk relaxed to each other. Working is an afterthought to all of them. I go to the front counter and ask to speak to a manager because I have yet to get my food. An employee goes to the back and never returns. Another employee standing there eventually comes up and says, ""I am in charge right now, what's wrong."" I said I want to get refunded and want to speak to an owner. She goes to the phone. Talks on it for two minutes and then hangs up. Then proceeds to go back to work and not acknowledge me again. I confront her and say, ""where is the manager."" She said, ""he is not here and will be here in 15 minutes. You can wait for him."" 

The audacity for her to suggest that I could wait after I waited 30 minutes for a grilled cheese that was never made. I walked out. I doubt I will ever return. 

I had stopped going there as often due to two previous health violations from the SNHD and poor customer service. Today solidified my desire to not return and make sure people know they have work to do.",J-9qnfKNaiqS0N2IE1RwKg,3,0,1,NYJKWUH78OHr-0phfPxodA

The parking situation here is a pain and even though there is a spot to use a credit card, the parking machine only takes cash and coins. 

I sampled the tuna and curried chicken salad before deciding what to order. The tuna had an excess amount of mayonnaise and the chicken was dry. I looked at the menu for an additional five minutes because I did not know what to order and was skeptical because I did not think the food was up to par based on the samples. I decided on the chicken sandwich on the light menu and my friend chose the tuna even though she tried it as well and was not impressed.

The sandwich I had was poorly stacked and because the lettuce was placed on the bottom it became wilted. I did not enjoy the seasoning of the chicken which is all I could taste when eating my sandwich. My friend said her tuna was overly watery which made the tortilla soggy. She also thought there was too much tuna and additional ingredients were needed in order to combat the mushiness of the tuna.

I eventually ordered the steel cut oatmeal ($5) with added strawberries and bananas ($2.25). I waited about 10 minutes for my oatmeal. My to go bag had everything I could need; unfortunately the food was not worth the wait or the price.

The oatmeal was watery and bland (even for my taste). There was 1 sliced strawberry and about half a banana sliced on top - that's it. The fruit was so flavorless I'm guessing it was frozen and thawed in the oatmeal.

For example, the mushroom burger apparently comes on multigrain bread, whereas one might expect it to be on brioche at most restaurants. I understand that there is maybe a health-bent to it (and hey, I'm from Santa Monica, so all the more power to that!), but I certainly never got the impression that I should expect it to come out like that. The breakfast omelette too came out, well, just fine. 

Again, it's not something that I'd consider that terrible, but I just definitely think you have other options available, being that Vegas is Vegas and all. So why not go to those places?

I usually order the Chicken Caesar Wrap with a side of their sweet potato fries. Like the name suggests, it's a Caesar salad in a wrap. They don't get greedy with the chicken, which is sliced thick, and the contents aren't drenched in dressing. What I like especially like about the wrap is the option to substitute the flour tortilla for a wheat tortilla.

Their pecan and chocolate brownies are sweet and fudgey. They're a little on the heavy side, but they make the perfect, shareable desserts to top off a meal. 

Lunchtime is full of diners, making it difficult to find a seat. Plus, parking can be bit of a pain. Although, you could place an order for either pick up or delivery.

I travel and in the US, especially LV, in the sea of All You Can Eats, Fried Meat chains, and 14 for 1 pizza, it's even more difficult to find heathy options. I'm not a vegetarian but like to eat plants when I can on the road. I often search out Vegan restaurants just for healthy options, like I did the previous night.

I'd eaten breakfast at Rachel's last year and just recalled being stuffed(!). Swung by this time for a lunch sandwich or something. WOW! Forgot the great choices offered! Ordered the smoked turkey/ Avo sandwich and took a chance on the side salad. No chance whatsoever with this choice! No typical US 3 leafs of iceberg/2 tomato wedges, and a crouton smothered in bottled Ranch, here!!! Hallelujah!!! A base of dark leafy greens, diced tomatoes, nice pile of julienned carrots, cucumber slices, with a soy based sauce (I think). Awesome! But, I'm pretty sure even my turkey sandwich had more vegetables on it than my ""vegan"" meal the night before! Nice pile of dark, fresh greens, tomato slices, and the avocado.

All of the other locations get great reviews but I failed to see where all the hype comes from. The Ultimate Grilled Cheese... was not very ultimate. Thin-sliced white bread, some cheese, a couple tomato slices. I expected thick crusty bread and really quality cheese... what I got was like, boring kid's menu grilled cheese. I could have made something way better for myself at home for wayyyy less than nearly $8.

The french fries and breakfast potatoes are not made fresh, they are frozen. The turkey on the turkey sandwich isn't a nice piece of turkey breast, it's boring lunch meat. They use a light hand to apply seasonings so there is not much flavor.

The service is really friendly, though. That and the smoothie I had are the reasons I am giving 3 stars instead of two- the peanut butter blast is delicious and the non-fat yogurt it's made with at least gives me the illusion of eating healthily. Since this location is literally right downstairs, I will probably stop by in the future to pick up a smoothie, but there is nothing on the menu that I couldn't make a tastier, fresher version of upstairs for way cheaper.",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,1,1,3,I7UcJL4u2BmcmayO4qTgpA

It's counter service, but they bring your food to your table, so a win-win in my opinion. The wraps are so big they must have like 5 eggs in them, and come with the most delicious side of little fried breakfast potatoes. And multi-grain banana chocolate chip pancakes with fruit for $8?! It's a steal! Pancakes are rich, moist and full of toppings.

Smoothie and juice bar is a wonderful addition if you're looking to do a lighter option. They also have a selection of baked goods that I'm always too full for but look delicious!

I am definitely an independent girl and can have a meal solo so downtown spots are perfect for that. I decided to give Rachel's Kitchen a whirl since I often went to the one in The District in Green Valley. Unfortunately The District got turned into The ROAD o CARS so I have been avoiding that area. I realize Downtown is no different, but The District *used* to have charm... not so much anymore.

Anyway, enough of my ranting - I like the fact this RK is Downtown. I like that it is in The Ogden, what I don't like is me driving past it twice looking for a place to park! *shakes fist* Well, I ended up metering, but I have gotten over that hump of going Downtown. So I meter. I don't care, pretty much every major city EXCEPT Las Vegas has meters everywhere for parking so I have come to terms.

This RK is set up quite the same as the one in The District with the great looking green-tiled tables and the nice snuggly cafe vibe. The employees were very sweet when I was here and offered honey/lemons for my tea and answered my questions regarding the soup of the day.

I really was hankering for soup/sandwich combo which RK has for $9.75. I say that's a decent price especially since you get a bowl of soup, not a cup. 

Turkey/Bacon/Avocado Sandwich (on sourdough) & Potato Cheddar Soup - The soup startled me because when it came out it was bright orange. I was like, ""What is this trickery potato soup?"" But, as I spooned the deliciously pureed potato and cheese into my mouth I decided it was quite delicious. I am sure the orange hue comes from copious amount of cheddar cheese, so ya know, fat girl status up in here! As for the sandwich it was a bit of a let-down. The bread was dry dry dry and did not have the richness I was expecting from a nice sourdough. I have a suspicion it was day(s) old bread. And there was an extra piece of bread in it which I didn't care for and removed. The turkey was all right and in my wold avocados make anything better, so it saved the sandwich a bit but not much.

Peach & Ginger Black Tea - I would come back for their teas to be honest. Sitting downtown sipping this amazing tea they have would be perfect on any winter day. I can't remember the name of the teas but the next time I go back I am writing it down in case I can get it for my own enjoyment at home.

Overall - Food-wise could use a little work. I hope when I go back the next thing I order completely redeems the dry bread. Ambiance, service, and overall experience was positive. Four stars it is for now.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,4,4,YO0xJHQv9GNg2uQkGi-qxg

The sandwich should not be called chicken salad. There was barely any chicken. Basically you get diced apple pieces, sliced grapes and mayonnaise, with a tiny amount of chicken here or there. For $9.95 cold fries and fruit on stale bread. No thanks. 

I do plan to go back. I want to give them a second chance just because everyone else seems to enjoy it. I think I'll try breakfast next time. Maybe it is served hot. Wish me luck.",Gu3kjquTVyyHF4M0pPRQiQ,1,0,2,fNS5r8ijZJvkxTwMzTjy5g

My company is moving downtown in September and it's nice to know there's a Rachel's Kitchen around the corner.  On this visit, me and my work team came for a quick lunch before our quarterly company meeting.  

I love the look of this restaurant.  No matter which location, you will be treated to a nice, clean bistro style restaurant.  This location has little round tables and high bar tops lining the front window.  The front counter is truly the star of the show, has a huge menu for your convenience and a viewing window for pastries.  The staff is friendly and very attentive.  You order, pay, grab your number and find a seat.  Your food will be brought to you when it's ready!  Super convenient :)

For lunch, I got the same gourmet sandwich I get in every visit:  The turkey club on wheat bread.  Smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and mayo served on three slices of your bread choice.  For me, what makes this sandwich is the avocado and mayo.  I love a sandwich with both.  It ties it all together and because of that, it's the best for me.  The turkey is nicely smoked, they give you a lot of slices and makes this sandwich super flavorful.  For my drink, I always get the Wilshire Smoothie.  It's filled with peaches, bananas, pineapples, fresh squeezed orange juice and nonfat vanilla frozen yogurt.  I always add kale to it for my serving of a super food.  Such a great smoothie, blended with all my favorites!!  Definitely a must try.  

Overall, a great bistro place!  Remember, on Sundays, mimosas are only $3.  I hope my review has enticed you to visit.  If you're looking for clean food with great service, come check them out.  You will not be disappointed!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,1,0,4,9WFcT53BEuSPXAetQDCsEA

The breakfast was standard for the price. No flavors were bold or stood out. The onion rings were big but scarce. They made the plate look large there were so few. Smoothie: Eh. Unimpressed. The ingredients looked fresh. 

I had a great conversation with one of the delivery guys. He rides a bike toting meals. His tips go into the tip jar to be divided up with the rest of the staff. Bummer he rides all over in rain and heat and has to share his tips with the other employees who stand at the register in air conditioning.

There was no regular black iced tea. There were several teas including green tea. Not regular black tea.

It's not a place I'd recommend for a quick bite to eat, however. It's located on the bottom floor of a nice condo tower, right on the corner of Downtown Las Vegas and Bum Central. Don't be surprised to see a homeless person sleeping on their patio. 
The environment inside is very clean, although a bit cluttered in the seating arrangement. It's more like communal dining at your own, separate table. Their bathrooms are always spotless, which is a clear indication that they value cleanliness. They even bus your tables for you (on a side note, I'd recommend using glassware for dine-in guests to save on waste. You're already bussing the tables and washing plates and flatware). 
Back to the food. Huge menu done right. Again, I cannot stress how fresh everything always tastes. They cook everything to order, and the menu boasts some familiar foods with an upscale twist, without the upscale prices. Everything is very moderately priced considering the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere.

After staying in the area for a few days on a work trip, I felt desperate for the kind of food I make at home... dark greens with minimal dressing, nuts and fruit. My hubs wanted a breakfast burrito.

I opened up Yelp, and there it was. Some other Rachel before me had opened a kitchen here. And there were salads, and they were good!

The food was inexpensive relative to the quality (less than $25 for the two of us) and there was a young woman singing and playing guitar while we ate. I don't always like live music, but her voice was really good, and it was really nice. 

If you're in the area and craving some whole food, this place is worth a stop.",2y4EC2UKWwzj33OpK17Edw,0,1,5,07XNh4sKee2cJikeQGzHow
5847462,2015-07-23,1,xk-fOf_M39kDTgzfVgu0Tw,I called asking for nutritional information about some of the food on the menu. They said they didn't have any nutritional information. Based on the fact that this place is catering to a certain demographic it seems like that would be readily available to the customer. Without it I really don't trust the food. I would like to know what is in my food and how much of it I am eating. This could be another Red Velvet Cafe situation (they were misrepresenting the calories of their food). Not worth it to go without knowing what I'm getting. Thanks but no thanks.,kM70xTwz9sAJ3Zc6AdCLHg,0,0,2,TaYL0GF9Kw0QTJSsaXbHyQ

I love their fresh ingredients and how if I get a omelette with bacon and avocados, they deliver on hefty portions of each. The staff is really friendly, always willing to throw in homemade salsa if you ask. They are also helpful when picking out a juice or smoothie made to order. The restaurant is always clean, colorful and inviting. Pro tip: If you check in you on Yelp, you get 50% off of beer and wine.",lA6PQt7mkZv7ucejytih3Q,0,0,5,LDCmz9z2pMKmydydaXNd4w

There was one persons still ordering and I was just stared at when trying to open the door. I understand wanting to leave but if your hours are till 3pm I expect to be able to come in at 3pm. Dumb.

I also ordered a sandwich from them that was not listed as having nuts. When it arrived at the table, I saw the nuts and was immediately disappointed (as I am severely allergic to tree nuts). But upon seeing my disappointment, the server apologized profusely, and had them make me something new on the spot. Very nice! Also love that they deliver :)

EDIT: Come to find out, the issue with the chicken salad sandwich I ordered was an honest mistake, and none of their sandwich contain nuts. So the menu was not incorrect in the listing of ingredients, it must have made it way into the sandwich on accident!",Q1s8saWck0a5pGbi4Xe0cA,1,1,4,n_E19Ja8sNxvscVJ884H9g

I ended up waiting 33 minutes for it. Three ingredients: egg, bacon, and potato.  They were nice staff but did not warn me the wait would be so incredibly long. I could have made it myself in half the time. I was disgruntled and let them know politely and they said sometimes things go a little slow in the kitchen. I was VERY disappointed they did not offer me even a cupcake or anything to show they genuinely cared about the frustrating delay.   Summary was a 5 minute order took 6 times longer than expected and they simply said sorry, things like this happen sometimes.  Boo!!!!",X5FIEbHqC6nbUIDB4h2zQQ,0,0,2,6mZ2RyB7eki1D9j9bivbgQ
