804428,2010-05-18,0,8zh9Uts1H32Cqfbar44TLw,"A Torta Ahogada has to be one of the last culinary gems that has not become exposed yet. Perhaps good reason for it; the provenance makes Guadalaraja, Mexico the place of origin (having done business there for enough years we genuinely believe the history), and even in other parts of Mexico it is not easy to find. But we are starting to see the sandwich show up on some Las Vegas menus, and we have to give a shout-out to El Birotazo for making the best that we have found so far.

Torta Ahogada literally means ""drowned sandwich"". Roast pork in a salty bollilo (the latter preferrably just a bit stale), dipped into a spicy chile arbol-based sauce. Add some pickled onions and a squeeze of lime. A fantastic combination if the meat is roasted properly and the bread sturdy enough to have a little staying power (especially if eaten from a cart in Guadalaraja).

El Birotazo does it right. The owners are from Guadalajara and take a lot of pride in their product. Generous with the meat, and the bread is crusty and has just enough oomph to get about two-thirds of the way through before it collapses. But no problem - they serve it in a shallow plate with a spoon, so that you can enjoy to the last drop. As for the rest of the small menu, we do not have a clue - all trips have been for this sandwich, and it is difficult to think about taking any other direction.",UXmddgoTzmOZAZTaZf_efA,4,2,4,NRXryohP9WvIEjMN9rVSow

Once I went to the restaurant, I was excited to try everything to see if it was as authentic as it seems outside. However, I was greeted with a rude server who just looked at me as if I was confused. He told me and my party to sit anywhere and so I tried looking for a place where it was clean and not crowded. Once I was ready to order, I asked the server how big the tacos were and he said ""What do you mean how big the tacos are?"" as if I was stupid.. I mean there are small tacos where I need to order at least 4 to fill me up or the slightly larger ones that I don't need to order as much. I had to use my hands to explain to him what I meant. When I finished ordering, I just realized that they were closing in 5 minutes and maybe that's why he was so rude. Once I realized that, I decided to just take my food to go thinking that it would be easier for everyone at the restaurant. The server was saying it was okay-- but i'm sure he was just saying that. I hate being the last customer eating.. I already felt like I was unwanted in the restaurant, so I wanted to leave as soon as possible.

The food came out really fast and everything was packed in a plastic bag.. including the sauces and literally... EVERYTHING! When I got home, it was more like... build your own taco, tostado and an ahogada. 

Tacos en Barbacoa- It was amazing! I really really liked the taco and the meat.. (oh, it is the larger tacos, btw. twice the size of the small ones) I ordered two which filled me up! I guess I liked it because I didn't really have to build my own taco. It they just put the sauce on the side and the condiments so I just placed it inside.. probably the ONLY thing that I liked.

Tostado en Carne- I had to make it myself... would probably have been better if I was there, but it wasn't as good.. the portion was huge! I definitely like the one from Tacos El Gordo better. They have smaller portions which makes it easier to eat and melted cheese... yum!

Tortas Ahogadas- did not look as good as the picture. I just didn't like it, period. I don't see what the hype was about. 

Overall, I give this place a 3 STARS. If it wasn't for the delicious tacos, I would have given this place 2 STARS. Service can definitely be better. I felt so unwelcomed and if they didn't want to serve us, they should have told us that the place was closing in 5 minutes instead of looking at us as if we were lost and confused.",SWCLYANLMiXiPhW0mzicVQ,1,1,3,kajmzDLIcJFm75OaXA9C1g

My buddy and I were supposed to hit this up after snowboarding one day, but it was close by the time we got there (Close at 7pm).

This was an OK dish as i find nothing to rave about.  The tomato sauce was nothing special and meat appears to be Carnitas inside the hard french roll.  For 6.50 I thought the portion was quite small.

Since i made it this far i wanted to make sure i got the most out of this place, so I asked the server for his recommendation.  His response, the Barbacoa tacos.  I thought this was exceptionally good esp for $1.75 a pop. The beef was tender and have more flavor in comparison to Cafe Rio's.  A squeeze of lime, onions, cilantro, and esp that red hot sauce will put it on another level though.  I had to order seconds just because I love that hot sauce.  Not sure if it was taboo, but i was also picking out the slice onions from the hot sauce and eating them. That made me ;]~

4092730,2011-06-20,0,8zh9Uts1H32Cqfbar44TLw,"Wow. wow. wow. 

Had lunch today with two friends at El Birotazo and tried enough dishes to be able to write a credible review of their exceptional food.

Torta Ahogado: made with pork, this is a Mexican-dip as opposed to a French dip - and it's incredibly delicious.  They make their own bread, too, which makes this crusty bolillo surprisingly resilient - but since they bring out an additional bowl of tomato-arbol sauce, there's no reason to panic... We split this three ways and I have to say, I thought about forking my friend for her share, but I behaved myself...

Tacos de Canasta:  I did a little research before we left for the restaurant so I'd not miss out on something I'd never had before merely because I was a newb... when I read that these are steamed tacos (also called Tacos Vapor) - so that the corn tortillas are soft and pliable filled with, for one option, potato, I knew we'd have to order some.  We also tried a chicken version, but it wasn't nearly as delicious as the potato.  This is a simple dish - but a perfect foil for their amazingly spicy, onion arbol broth and their smokey salsa loaded with cilantro.

Tacos Dorados:  we ordered two beef  tacos.  These are the lovely crispy tacos - not rolled like flautas, but normal shape, filled with beans and cheese, fried crispy, then topped with the meat of your choice.  Great flavor, great texture - these were not greasy or heayy at all.  Fabulously messy finger food.  I'd have killed for a cold beer.  

When we realized we still had room to try one more thing, we followed the lead of a little girl at a neighboring table, busily working through a barbacoa taco - so we ordered three so we wouldn't have to share this time  -- and it was the right decision.  The barbacoa tacos are double tortilla'd - one plain, the other dipped in the same tomato-arbol broth - filled with deliciously tender and juicy pulled beef - deshebrada - loaded with cilantro and light onion.  If you eat these with a fork to avoid the juice dripping down your arm, you're missing the point.  One hand-held bite of these and everything you think you know about tacos vanishes. 

I really can't decide which I like better of the torta and the barbacoa, but I know I'll be back - and with more willing tasters, because they have things like Lonches Calientes, that I still haven't had, and other torta flavors- goat and lamb and pork skin plus tostadas of all sorts...prepared traditionally like they do in Guadalajara with a crispy tortilla on the bottom and one on top - 

Yes - the menu is in Spanish, their website, too - the service, if you're prepared and have taken a look at their visual menu on their website: http://elbirotazo.com/menu/, is friendly, encouraging and helpful.  Please be the same in return.

At lunch, it was packed - we got there early (before 12) and didn't wait for a table, but it was a Monday, and my guess is this place fills up quickly for their authentic, delicious, simple food.   Lots of families with their small children - which confirmed one thing we all agreed - this wasn't super spicy (unless you loaded up on the onion sauce they bring to the table...which is addictive), it's very kid-friendly and approachable which is nice to know - and great for introducing kids to real Mexican food...which I think is very important.  

Food comes out quickly. (Another plus, if you're dining with children - or a hangry adult - so hungry, they're angry...)  

Credit cards accepted. And if you go with more than 4 folks, it may take a while, most of their tables are 4 tops, and it's not a big place.  

To get there, take Charleston east to Lamb, make a uturn at the light and it's on your right a block back.  

This was definitely worth hunting for...",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,3,1,5,i3kG2om6I7OJX19sEBgF9Q

4395424,2018-01-26,7,8zh9Uts1H32Cqfbar44TLw,"So I've been hearing for a while now that this place is super good.  Why has it taken me so long to try it?

1. Sketchy area
2. Small parking
3. Their whole website is in Spanish and I couldn't figure out what to get

That being said, I finally made it with the help of my coworker who said she'll order for me.  Supposedly they're known for their Tortas Ahogadas.  

We get there and the place is PACKED! We were able to snag the last table and wait for someone to help us.  They said you can ask what spiciness you want (I think the only options is spicy or no spice.) I got one of each.  The tortas came out to be $8 a piece.  We ordered them to-go, and what we got were 3 sandwiches and 2 bags of sauce.  

I assemble them at home and I decided to serve the sauce on the side instead of laddling it on top because man was the spicy sauce SPICY!!  I tried one of the onion slices that was a part of the sauce and my mouth was burning, my eyes were tearing up, and my ears were ringing!  I have never felt that type of spiciness before.  It was so spicy, yet so addicting because I couldn't stop myself from trying it again and seeing how much I could take.  

The non-spicy sauce was also good. and that's what I used for most of my torta.  I smelled a lot of oregano.  The torta itself looks plain, its just some bread and meat. But that meat was well worth it!  It tasted like lechon shredded up and put into a sandwich.  There were no fillers, just a good chunk of meat.  (If you're looking for lechon without buying the pig, this is the place to go!)",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,13,10,4,wKBdqYLgI789vuYfARA3tQ

The only thing dislike is how small it is and there's a playing a  lady playing a guitar. Don't get me wrong I enjoy her singing and her guitar skills but it hard to have a conversation when she right next to you.

When I got there on Sunday, the place was packed and people were standing waiting.  Always a good sign.  So, I ordered to go.  Had the torta ahogado.  Fantastic.  Since I got it to go, they put the sauce and the onions in a little baggy for me.  So, I got home, drenched it and ate.  Had to finish with a fork, but the bread stood up well to the sauce, which is liquidy.  The onion/salsa mixture is HOT, but great.  Basically, it was Mexican pulled pork with the sauce and onions.  Recommended, but be prepared since it's a small place.  I was very pleased how the sandwich stood up even with driving home.  Still warm and delicious.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,2,2,4,MDfSkplBfsh3hWjLeZsj-A

5141623,2018-04-20,0,8zh9Uts1H32Cqfbar44TLw,"I've been searching for good barbacoa for a couple of weeks. I dined at a trendy modern Latin/fusion restaurant miles from here and they served something they passed off as barbacoa (tasted like mop strands soaked in mild chili sauce). Barbacoa should be done with beef cheeks and/or the meat from the head braised then flash grilled to add some crispy bits. Today I set out to find decent barbacoa.

Biriatazo specializes in Tortas in Guadalajara style.  But I came for barbacoa. Their barbacoa seems to be done with brisket and then shredded into strands. The barbacoa tacos are distinctive and satisfying with wonderful seasoning and fresh crisp condiments.  My only reservation is the barbacoa is a tad too lean for my preference.  I like a barbacoa that hits you with the power of well marbled short rib.

As far as ambiance there is none, people are here to eat good food period. The place is small and they fill up quickly, so even take out involves a little wait.",TxYvDePA67VeFBwnh-wr8A,0,0,4,6eDXuXEZ66Te2wPd8HTHPg

Let's do the bad stuff first.  Saturday afternoon around 5pm.  There was ZERO parking.  The neighborhood is sketchy at best.  Seating is extremely limited.  

Now the good.  Close access to the freeway.  Friendly cashier!  Quick ordering to go.  Busboys turn over tables quickly too.  Inexpensive delicious food.  

$1.50 for Tacos Al Vapor (Beef, Beans, Chicken or Chicharron).  

If this restaurant was closer I wouldn't have to cook.  Wish there was more seating.  Would have loved to have sat and are with the family.  Drive home 35min later and the food was still hot!",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,2,2,5,5uzSPemzo50bdXlepesU1w
