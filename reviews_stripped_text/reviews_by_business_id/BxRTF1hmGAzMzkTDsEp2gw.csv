After acting offended after explaining that I intended to eat in rather than take out, she served a STONE COLD souffle and refused to heat it up.  She didn't even suggest using the microwave (which, admittedly, I was familiar with them being avialable for customer use) and opted to lie about how their souffles were always served hot.

Bottom line:  if you've worked a hard week and want to have a relaxing Saturday breakfast, please stay away from this place -- you will at best enjoy sub-par food and likely leave frustrated at their obnoxious level of customer service.",EgjmV2fZeonFqLY5ubmfVw,0,0,1,gn1xD1DhzaOtFqUEXrYRFA

That's great considering I've waited almost 30 minutes in drive thru at a fast food resturant before having to be to work. I ordered a complete meal for my fiance and i, & it was very good. The only reason i am not giving a 5 star is because the woman i dealt with when i ordered an extra pastry upon my arrival, was very ride,  & seemed irritated with the fact that i wanted more food. .

I had just a bowl of broccli cheddar soup since they have limited veggie options. The sandwiches looked small but I guess paninis are not supposed to be super big? I don't know.

I went in recently to pick up food for my girlfriend, who was distraught after having a tough day at work. I ordered the customary lemon orzo soup, all was well, but then the manager came out nicely to explain to me (after the order was placed) that they have discontinued that soup completely. ""Forever?"" I gasped with the air of a fainting maiden. ""It's my girlfriend's favorite!!"" He was (kindly) caring about the whole thing as I struggled to think of something different to order for her. Imagine my surprise when he comped me the soup completely and insisted on refunding the $$ for it and still gave me a different type of soup for free.

I'm a big fan of their French Onion Soup. It is very flavorful and always seems to have just the right amount of onions. I recommend you get it in a bread bowl, but if you get it to go double check that they have included all of the accouterments (bread bowl, croutons, cheese). On a couple, very sad occasions they have forgotten either one or the other in my to-go bag. The broccoli and cheese soup is also very good.

The salads are really good with very unique combinations that are a nice change from the normal things you can get for similar prices at Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday. Their sandwiches are also very nice, but the Panini is a bit on the smallish side.

Oh! The bagels, especially the Asiago cheese, are great! You can even got a dozen to go with schmear  for your work staff meetings.

The chai tea is yummy - way better than Starbucks.

As a bonus, Panera offers free wi-fi. I've done some writing in here on my laptop, and even though the jazz music was a bit loud for my taste, the free wireless more than made up for it.

My only major complaint (besides them forgetting my blasted croutons) is that this location never seems to have enough registers open and the line very quickly becomes annoying, especially when people can't figure out what they want.",Uw-v0UN_g_oFvldC7HWXMg,1,1,4,JN7eXWwUUvg470EV4mqHHQ

The last time I came in here it was extremely hot.  The AC was broken and it was over 100 outside so we left.  This time it was still hot, but not as bad as last time.  Should look into getting this fixed/lowering the temp.  

I almost always get the same thing here.  A U-Pick-2 with cheddar broccoli soup, a plain tuna sandwich on a french baguette, and a side of bread.  Their cheddar broccoli soup is amazing!!  And the prices are fair. 

I came in with my friend today.  Service was friendly, but both of our sandwich orders were wrong.  First they brought out my friend's sandwich and forgot to add avocado.  While they were fixing it, I looked at my receipt and didn't see ""plain"" anywhere, so I knew my order was going to be messed up (although the cashier did repeat back ""plain"" to me).  When my friend's sandwich was brought back out, the lady asked to see my receipt, took it with her, and returned back 5 minutes later with my food.  I am guessing they forgot about mine or lost the ticket.  My sandwich wasn't plain.  Maybe I should have double checked with her when she took my receipt and left with it, I don't know..

Coming into Panera Breads' warm and vibrant atmosphere was very welcoming. It was stylish and clean! The combo deals with their bread bowls are appreciatively affordable, and just what we needed that hit the spot. My one-year-old son enjoyed their whole apple side, that I cut into slices for him to eat. 

Their broccoli cheddar soup was very tasty, and one of the better ones I have eaten in my broccoli-cheddar-experiences. Definitely plan on ordering it again.

Also, this was my first time here. It's safe to say I will be a returning customer. :)

1935796,2014-07-31,2,BxRTF1hmGAzMzkTDsEp2gw,"I know many of you will not like my review but here goes anyway.

If I was to wake up in the morning and need a cup of coffee and a tasty bagel, this would be a good place to head to. They have WiFi and newspapers. Nice couch type are for lounging. They have all the toppings for the perfect morning.

We however, had lunch here. I have also had dinner in the past. The menu is quite confusing. They have many sandwiches with great names and great breads but, what the heck comes on them? My wife asked about three before she just described what she was looking for. They told her a choice that was closest and they went from there. Add this, take away that. Much easier if you list it out. 

Bread is great! Lettuce and tomato were old. Some of the lettuce was wilted. I will tell you that if you look down on a sandwich and you see wilted lettuce before you even start, just give it back and get your money, unless your starving.

When you walk in there is one register to the left and four on the right. We were greeted with a ""welcome etc etc"" but after that the employees kept working behind the counter. Took them a minute or two to realize one of them had to take the order. That is an auto ""BOOOOOO"" when I seem like I'm bothering you. Pretty sure you're in business to make and sell food.

There were no clean tables when we went to sit down. That is another problem. If you are a busy lunch food spot and it is lunchtime, you need to be ""Johnny on the spot"" with the cleaning tables.

They did have a great little baker program for kids. Sign your kids up and they can take the class to learn and actually bake bread. Class looked to full for me though. 20 some kids seemed big.

breakfast 5 stars
bread 4 stars
lunch 2 stars

The half/half combos available for all their soups, salads, and sandwiches make this place a constant lunchtime stop for me.  The Fontana grilled cheese.  The tortellini  Alfredo pasta.  The Cesar.  All classics and all done fairly well here.

The negative: the sweeping.  Nearly every time I've been here someone has come by my table and started sweeping the carpet with a brush broom... Over and over and over.  Besides the dust that I'm sure it's putting into the air (and my food) it also makes a whole lot of noise and takes away from the meal.

2002524,2012-02-26,2,BxRTF1hmGAzMzkTDsEp2gw,"This particular Panera is a staple in my life - which I honestly don't care to make a major corporate, chain-run restaurant my place to run to on rainy days, when I have a cold, or when I just need a bowl of soup or a healthy salad to start my day.  But it is.  It's been not only that but a place of longing that various co-workers have agreed that when we hear some Chet Baker or otherwise lounge-jazz music that we'd ""rather be at Panera.""  It's reliable, the food is always good, and I always know what to expect.

That said - for those who aren't in the know of Panera, get out from under your rock and get in the 'know!  Panera is a light lunch/breakfast eatery that offers a bakery with morning bites, with jazz music floating throughout.  It's a hit with all ages, offering free wi-fi, and its very popular with everyone from children to seniors.  They have a you pick two deal which allows you to mix and match a variety of things from the whole soup/salad/sandwich/etc so you can get a pretty sweet combo for just six-ish bucks.  You typically have kids working there who remember your name, your preferences (One girl would give me a free cookie if I always wore one piece of Nintendo gear so I ended up with a lot of free cookies!)

My only complaint with this particular location is that the upholstery, carpetry, and the door handle and a few things here and there needs an upgrade.  They're worn and their age is showing as opposed to a few years ago when they looked brand spanking new.  A major warning that I have as far as just ""dropping into"" this place is to make SURE that you are not coming on a soccer afternoon!  See that field across of Rainbow?  Chances are that a lot of the players are going to flood Panera as soon as their game lets out and not only is going to grind service to a halt, but you may be finding that a good chunk of the menu is now depleted.  The upside to this is that there are other very good restaurants in this place about twenty feet away: Viet Bistro, Market Grille Cafe, and Chipotle.  

My particular favorite dishes?  I adore the Chicken/Rice soup, Chicken Almond Salad Sandwich, and the Thai Chopped Chicken salad are among my favorites.  Keep in mind that the soups change from day to day and that certain non-creme based soups do not do well in their delicious sourdough bread bowls.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,2,0,4,MUte99gZMIMi7vcLjmUMlQ

There food is fresh and relatively healthy, so I'm not sure why I don't come for often. Anyway, we passed it on our walk home from the gym and decided to stop in for a bite to eat.

We split a Thai Chopped Chicken Salad and a Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich. I really liked the fact that they had the calories posted. Especially since we'd just got done working out and I was more calorie-conscious than usual. Many of the items sounded delicious so I was able to narrow down my choice in part by looking at the calories.

The salad was big and fresh. The dressing wasn't my favorite ever, but it was okay. I did really like that the salad had edamame which was an interesting twist.

The sandwich was pretty good. It was chocked full of chicken, grapes and almonds. It was moist without being drowned in mayo.

Panera has really good, fresh salads and sandwiches. They're better than most chain sandwich places. Not sure why I don't go here more often. Maybe I'll start.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,3,1,4,9tCuOmz63P8IMYvN_anaZw

I have my set items that I get, but occasionally I'll try a new market sandwich.  Can't lose with a soup.  Broccoli Cheddar, French Onion, Chicken Tortilla: they're all very filling and tasty.

The first time I walked into Panera I walked right back out.  It confused me, I thought I was in some mom & pop bread shop.  I didn't understand the cafe service; I'd only ever done sit down dining or fast food.  Anyway, moving past that embarrassing fact, I love going to this place.  I never go to work on my laptop, I just really enjoy the food and the peace.  It's a great place to have a bite with friends and loiter for a bit.  I've never had any problems with the staff or the food.  Sometimes they forget to take out the tomato from my sandwich, but I am more than capable of doing it myself.  They're quick to accommodate, very customer service oriented.  And they start to recognize regulars, so you feel more and more welcome each time you go.  5 stars every time.",YyGhWvyw6mjJFICgq7rUxg,3,1,5,oz509VV_vA0ZmQB6G323Cg

You can choose any 2 items from the lists of sandwiches, salads or soup and it comes with a choice of chips or fruit (i think?). Soup and sandwich is the way to go.

Being a bakery and cafe, they offer lunch and breakfast. They have some tasty options when it comes to breakfast you can choose from bagels, pastries, souffles, breakfast sandwiches and fresh baked bread. It wouldn't be breakfast if coffee wasn't offered so they do have a nice variety of options for that too. The lunch menu is my favorite. I love that they introduce new salads & sandwiches, but also love that they bring back old seasonal favorites. The ""You Pick 2"" option is great. I love that I can switch it up between soup, salad, and sandwiches. I have eaten inside this location a couple times, but usually just phone my order in and pick it up. They have a program called ""My Panera"" that you should look into if you plan on eating here more then once. You can earn free food and other cool stuff. I am able to log in online and check the status of my rewards. Please note that currently if you have a freebie and don't use it for 60 days that it will expire. This last visit I saw a sign that they offer catering. I never thought of PB for catering needs, but I bet it is a big hit at most offices. 

My absolute favorite sandwich from PB is the ""Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini""and it really hit the spot last night it is so good! I get the ""Broccoli Cheddar Soup"" and love dipping my panini into it. Such a nice combo and a comforting meal no matter what time of year it is. I'm glad we have PB!

I ordered a bacon and egg breakfast sandwich on a brioche bun and coffee for myself; a plain croissant and hot cocoa for my little one. When our order arrived, the breakfast sandwich did not look anything like the picture. The bun was toasted (panini-pressed) and was almost burned making it hard. And I didn't see any bacon! A crew member was walking by and I told her that there's no bacon. Her reply, ""Oh, it's inside."" I opened the sandwich to inspect it - there was no bacon! I called the attention of the same crew member. Her reply this time, ""I'm sorry. We'll fix that for you."" When she came back, I made sure my order was right this time. It was right alright. There was a piece of bacon, broken into three and carelessly placed on top of the ""scrambled"" egg. Too bad, I didn't take a picture. I could have made a better-looking sandwich for myself at home! For $4.89 +, I think it should have been better. Then there's the coffee. Went to get my second cup, and it was not hot! Almost room-temperature! And it's not even 10:00 AM yet! I informed a staff member at the register and she said she'll ask someone to make some.

Don't get me wrong Panera has a great menu with great food, when it's prepared correctly. I work at a job where I buy my employees food occasionally, and we have ordered through the catering website a few times previously. Many times, at least three I can remember off hand, that our order was not correct. Either sandwiches were made wrong, we were given the wrong salads or even worse orders were completely left out and not in with a large group order. I'm not sure how this happens as the group order is written and the person who prepares it, just has to read off the paper order. It is just a terrible feeling when you have to tell your employee their lunch is not here. We have complained previously and have spoken to managers where we've been told to call in (after placing the online order)and speak to someone to ensure the order is seen,reviewed, and make sure it would be ready within the allotted time. After doing this, they still have left out lunch orders completely off our large group order. 
I don't recommend placing large orders online through this location! It is a guaranteed let down! Take your business elsewhere! They don't even care that they have made mistakes! No apologies, no attempts for any compensations. Not a good way to run a business.",3WdlzpsX2GsxFQyJZLrFLA,0,0,1,askzOZ2_0ySW8BVKxj4jjw

One of my salads was filled entirely of little bushes and trees and was inedible. I even asked for spinach in the salad but there was little spinach. The bushy lettuce had taken root and overgrown the spinach. The size and shape of the salad bowl has also changed and after I sans a few ingredients that do not agree with me I am left with little salad for the price. The soup is still good but the bread also does not seem fresh and is not as good as it used to be. Also the Lake Meade location was not that clean and it was fairly hot inside and I'm one that always carries my Linus blanket ( jacket) with me. I am sadly no longer a fan and look to replace my Panera habit with another chain such as Cantors deli in Tivoli Village.

Since it was lunchtime, I was hungry and ordered the Italian Combo Sandwich with Kettle Chips & a Bottle of Water.  The menu is simple and you don't get to pick the toppings of your Sandwich....so that was a bummer to me....I like to select my toppings.  Oh well, no big deal.  On a positive note....they post the # of calories for each menu item....that was helpful....1,040 calories for my Sandwich + 180 Calories for the Chips....I was at 1,220 for the meal...not bad.

The place is a Bakery and had a ton of fresh Bread & Pastries....all very tempting, but I didn't want to pass out from food coma....I had to get some work and homework done.

I settled into a small table and setup the wireless on my laptop while I waited for my food.  It didn't take long and the food was ready.  I dove into the Sandwich....the Bread was pretty good and the proportion of Meat and toppings was good too.  It was good, but not great.

After lunch I moved over to a plush chair in the corner and got to work....got some work done and hung out for a couple of hours.  It was very comfortable.

3846229,2017-08-20,0,BxRTF1hmGAzMzkTDsEp2gw,"I used to work for Panera Bread, not at this location, and I used to be so obsessed with it. Back then, 7 years ago, I enjoyed the 5.99 U-pick 2. (I didn't even mind paying the full price after I used up my employee discount) Even when they raised it up for 6.99 a year later, I considered it to be worth it.
Our family got stationed over seas for 3 years, before they raised it at 7.99. For me, I thought, heck I'd pay for that, it will be worth it.  Within that 3 years, there's no Panera Bread around. I've missed it and craved it ever now and then. Came back last year and relieved to have Panera back in my life. Although, I didn't go as often as I did before, and when I do, I would just grab my favorite sandwich (Bravo) and a cup of soup. Never disappointing. I never did pay attention to the prices either.
Today, I ordered a U-Pick2 at this Location as a Rapid Pick up, (which to my surprise they started that and delivery, that's a plus). 
Anyways, my main complaint: When did they start downsizing their portion? My half salad looks like a quarter size of the salad I used to get. 
The packaging looks nice, that's a thumbs up.
More Tea selections, another thumbs up. Super yummy btw.
Oh and staffs here are friendly, so thumbs up to them. (They did forgot my cup of soup though, but fixed that right away.)
I guess something has to give and that's the portions you buy with the money you spend. For this size salad and a cup of soup, I spent about $10. I'm beginning to think this isn't as worth it as it did before. 
I think I'll go to Kneaders for my salads for now on, at least there, i get a good portion for the money I spend.",JTGLoZfkq-28G5Bv1iz2-w,0,0,4,4oLZU0NOpsjahsiV8UX4EQ

Or, food your neighbor's cousin's sister's mom use to make when you were a kid.  The menu is basically sandwiches, soups, and salads. But there's enough on the menu to satisfy almost everyone.  One thing about Panera Bread is that their food is always fresh and price is even better.  You can even getaway with a sandwich and soup for less than $10.  My order is usually the same...turkey something.  Either I'm getting a turkey in a panini or their smoked turkey sandwich.  Also don't be surprised if I get my turkey with extra meat.  

The restaurant itself, along with their service, is always right on.  I tend to frequent Panera Breads that are located inside shopping malls, which tend to be smaller. So you can imagine the shock when I walk into a freestanding or strip mall PB.  I had a great time on my last visit, more of those great times to come.

I placed an online catering order a week in advance for 8AM pick up. I arrived at 7:55AM to pick up the order. Let's just say they started prepping my bagel order at 8:05AM. My order wasn't complete until 8:30AM. The excuse for the order not being ready was ""we received this order 10 minutes prior to 8AM"", which obviously was not true Bc I arrived at 7:55 and they hadn't even started on my order.  Not only was my order not filled, but they put the dozens of bagels in different boxes (as opposed to the large catering boxes) and gave me the small containers of the 2oz of cream cheese (instead of the tubs).

I've been visiting Panera bread for over 10 years(at multiple locations) This location has been my particular Panera home for almost a year now. Parking here is not THE BEST because its a smallish lot with a dozen little shops! Especially during lunch time there is alot of traffic in the lot. 

My usual goto is the the u pick 2 I get 1/2 the frontega chicken and a bowl of broccoli and cheddar soup. You get to choose an apple, french baguette, or kettle chips. Their french baguette is awesome especially when you're lucky enough to get it warm! Their chips are a solid option as well. When they introduced the cuban panini as an option I was a convert this sandwich is awesome ham, chicken, pickle, cheese, and mustard YUM!! I'll get the tortilla soup when I get the cuban, they compliment each other pretty well. 

SOMETHING TO AVOID I stopped in recently and tried the big kid grilled cheese it boast gruyere, vermont white cheddar, american, and applewood bacon. What I was served was a sandwich with lite grill marks and unmelted cheese. So I asked them to, you know, GRILL my grilled cheese! So they did! When I got it back it was sorta mushy maybe like the nuked it in a micro, but it was still a little crispy so I'm not positive it was that but the cheese was NOT visible slices like it was when I first got it. I really LOVE grilled cheese k but this was SO BLAND! It was the texture of grilled cheese without the complex flavors of the above mentioned cheese! And the bacon????? WHERE WAS THE BACON!?! It's as if they sprinkled 3 little sprinkles of bacon bits on this thing! Bacon is usually and a KEY flavor when added to something, not in this sandwich I didn't taste it AT ALL. So for this sandwich alone I did knock a star off =(

Now on to the sweet! They have a special if you get lunch or dinner and a drink you can choose any baked goof for 99 cents. The cobble stone muffin is AWESOME and then their scones! Oh my lord their strawberries and cream scone made me wanna scream at starbucks! When I order this I was expecting something hard and crumbly like starbucks' and what I received was perfectly frosted on the outside and SOFT AND CHEWY on the inside OMG this thing is to die for!! It had chunks of strawberries in it and isn't over poweringly sweet! This is a solid choice TRY IT!!!",JfnY0VcP63s5RF1sfOHjBQ,1,0,4,hIx6KNNkJ7YD97oO42wgoA

5390390,2014-12-02,1,BxRTF1hmGAzMzkTDsEp2gw,"I tend to avoid writing reviews for places like Panera Bread.  I mean I always figured there wouldn't be many who would benefit from a review unless I had some key intel that made it completely unsuitable.   This afternoon at this location, a man approached me while I was awaiting my takeout order and asked ""what's their specialty here?""   After I stammered something about ""Bread, soups, sandwiches and salads"" it dawned on me:  perhaps there is a small fragment of the population who COULD benefit from my review!   Here goes:

I'm all about the ""hidden menu"".   I use quotes because the hidden menu is about as hidden as escort services here in Las Vegas.  There is literally a spot on the main menu behind the cashiers that has the Chicken Hummus bowl with a blurb ""from the hidden menu!"", and the website has a link that says ""Hidden Menu"" on it.   I'm not sure the word hidden means what panera thinks it means.   So on the hidden menu tend to be low carb, low calorie options.   They're all delicious!   So much so that I find myself ordering from them at least twice a week.   

My favorite is the Turkey Mediterranean Salad.  You get your salad pre-requisites of lettuce, tomato and onion, and then some baby spinach, nice olives, peppers, and the star of the show:  delicious ""antibiotic free"" turkey.  You also get a side of bread, an apple, or chips.  I go with the apple when I'm wanting to be healthy.   The best part of the salad is its only 300 calories!  Lohan and Richie circa-Skeletwin days would approve.  

The Chicken Mediterranean salad is also fantastic, though I have no idea what is ""mediterranean"" about it.  It has lettuce, spinach, chicken, eggs, and bacon.  Haven't exactly seen anything like that at Stephanos.   Anyway as far as taste this one is probably my favorite, but it comes in at a whopping 400 calories so I save it for special occasions, like Thursdays.

The steak lettuce wraps off the same menu are really tasty and a crazy low 210 calories.  It's basically just some lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, and steak with some great pesto sauce.   It's hard to believe how much flavor you get for only 210 calories.   I do find myself feeling more hungry hours after I eat this one as compared to the others so I don't order it too often.  

For me, you can't really go wrong at Panera from a flavor level.  I've also done several of their sandwiches and soups and have generally been pleased each time.  It's not exactly groundbreaking, but simply good and consistent food.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,0,4,IGYgawJB5uiph32K5HLnOg

Personally I love their black bean soup- the tomato and mozzarella sandwich is alright. The only pastries I have had have been at the end of the day and kind of dry, but hey, my fault for getting them so late.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,3,1,3,LOi4rC2x5KmygeomkQf_xA

He told me to also order a side of bbq sauce and use it to my hearts desire. It has all the flavors you would expect of Panera, but I will have to ask them to hold the onions next time.  I'm just not a fan of raw onions and if you are not either you should do the same.

The first thing I noticed when I walked in, though, was the red velvet cookies--hmmm, those are new.  And, as you can see, sugar plays such an important role in my diet that I'm drawn to the baked goods first.  Armed with my Panera Rewards card, I had the salad, soup, a small fountain drink and said red velvet cookie, all for $9.66 (I got $2 off the meal because I had rewards on my card)--not bad, dude.

also tried the pumpkin bagel,  it is sweet..the veggies spread tone down the sweet.  or maybe I'm just not used to the pumpkin favor.

5728758,2015-12-31,0,BxRTF1hmGAzMzkTDsEp2gw,"Had such a disappointing experience here recently.  I used to love Panera years ago but hadn't been in a long time and had a gift card to use. 
  When we first walked in the cashier asked if we had any questions and I said 'Yes! I don't eat eggs or dairy or meat, what are my options?'  And the girl next to him immediately said all their bread has eggs in it.  Hm.  So no sandwiches or bread bowls.  But he said the black bean soup was vegan and I could get it  with chips.  Okay. So not super thrilled that that was my only option besides a salad considering they try to present themselves as a somewhat healthy option.  But whatever, I order it.  Another crew member comes over and reminds the cashier they were out of black bean today but did have a vegetable soup. I asked if it was vegan and he said yes. So I order that.
  It comes over to our table, with a piece of bread. I obviously hadn't wanted the bread considering the girl told me all their bread has eggs in it.  Also, there was a big dallop of pesto on top of my soup.  I asked the lady who brought it over if the pesto has cheese in it, she said no. I said are you sure because pesto traditionally has Parmesan and it looked like it.  So she went and got the manager who brought the recipe book.  Turns out- yes the pesto had cheese. They gladly took it back and brought me a fresh bowl without, which turned out to be pretty good.  Also- the French baguette served with my soup (mistakenly) did not have eggs in it according to recipe book.  Made me wonder if the cashiers had any clue about the ingredients.  It also shocked me that the general manager had to go in the recipe book to answer the question about the bread.  Do you even know what is in the food you are serving people?!  I work in the restaurant industry and the whole experience would have been a lot more pleasant had the workers been knowledgable about the menu.
  Too much trouble for what was to be a quick meal.  Not what they appear to be as far as healthy options.  But the lady who brought our food and the general manager did go out of their way to accommodate my dietary restrictions and that is very much appreciated.

It lasted for three days, with a clouded head and lack of appetite on the fourth day. 

I reached out to Panera on Twitter to make sure I got in contact with some type of corporate member, and they were very courteous. They said they had reached out to the franchise owners for that Panera, and that they would be in contact with me within the next 48 hours. The franchise never contacted me, so I contacted Panera again on Twitter, and they said they reached out to them again, saying it should be another 24 hours before I hear from them. I didn't receive a call from anyone, so I just gave up and advised everyone I knew to stay away from that Panera and their steak and arugula sandwich.",IM55JxRSkFTS97qLmtF3dQ,1,0,1,1sydmFnaVc2LKSrpyrwexw

Once inside it's PACKED! Every table & booth is full. Lots of super nice helpful staff.
I order a Chicken Cuban panini and a soda. I'm offered a side of chips, apple or bread. I choose apple, it's actually an apple , real not slices in a packet. Excellent . I wait about 2 minutes and the sandwich is ready. Simply fantastic, tasty, hot melted cheese on ham & chicken. I think a top 10 sandwich of all time in my lifetime.

Also, this is a great place to get together with others to discuss business, study, or relax on quick break. They provide free wi-fi that makes this better than stopping at any Starbucks (not to mention they have great coffee as well.)

The sandwiches were only half sandwiches. The cups were small and my chicken noodle ingredients were weak and lacking. The ingredients were gone in three bites leaving a weak and watery broth.

My GF ordered tomato soup and said it was average but nothing special. I took a taste and had to agree but I'm not a tomato soup fan. 

Our half sandwiches were good but we both desperately wanted our missing halves. It came with some kettle chips that were very good and its a shame that I believe the bagged and processed chips were the best part of our meal.

We both looked at each other at the end of the meal and said do you want to go get dinner now? 

The staff was pleasant and accommodating but I did see the delivery team walking back past dirty tables and not stopping to clear them so maybe they arent motivated to keep things clean? Makes me worried about how clean the kitchen maybe.
